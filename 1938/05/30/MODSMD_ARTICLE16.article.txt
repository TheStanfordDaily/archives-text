# Visitors To See Hanna Home
## House Designed By Frank Lloyd Wright 
### 
The home of Dr. Paul R. Hanna,
which will be open to Stanford stu
dents tomorrow afternoon from 3 to
5 o'clock, is one of five buildings on
the Pacific Coast designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright.
The residence, the only creation
of the famed modern architect in
northern California, was completed
last October.
The house is located on Coronado
Avenue, on the campus. It is reach
ed by driving to the end of the Row,
one block past the Fiji house, and
turning to the right one block.
Visitors tomorrow afternoon are
requested to leave their cars at the
base of the hill and to walk up the
driveway, since the "carport" of the
house will accommodate only a few
automobiles.
Guides will be stationed around
the house to direct the guests and
answer their questions. Chairman
for the afTair, which is sponsored by
the Student-Faculty Relations Com
mittee, is Putzie Hinrichs.
Guides will be Jane Eaton, Mary
Ellen Weer, Dick Dudman, and
Larry Livingston. This will be the
only opportunity that students will
have to see the Hanna house, which
has been called an impoi*tant and
remarkable experiment in scientific
architecture.
