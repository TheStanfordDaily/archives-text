# Trackmen Take Second in P.C.C.
## Malott, Burrows Score Double Wins To Chalk Up 20 Card Points 
### 
After floundering through their dual meet season, Stanford's var
sity trackmen finally came to life Saturday at Edwards Stadium and
pulled through to an unlooked-for second place in the annual Pacific
Coast Conference trackfcst.
As expected. Southern California's powerful aggregation won team lum
ps and won going away with a grand total of C.'{ 3-5 points. Stan-

ford was second with 40 7-10 digits,,
while California was shoved back to
third, scoring 36 1-10 markers. Oth
er scorers were as fololws:
Washington State, 28; U.C.L.A.,
23; Oregon, 23; Washington, 9;
Idaho, 1 1-5; and Montana and
Oregon State, 0.
Double Victory
Not only did the Indian team pull
the biggest upset, but also furnished
the two individual stars of the meet
in Captain Ray Malott and Edson
Burrows, who each scored a double
victory to gather practically half of
the Cards' total.
Malott, after winning the 440 in
the sensational time of 46.9, came
back to run a splendid field into the
ground in the 880 with a meteoric
finish that gave him a 1:54 triumph.
Coaches Agree
Both Stanford Coach Dink Tem
pleton and Cal Coach Brutus Hamil
ton agreed that Captain Ray's win
ning effort in the quarter mile was
the greatest race they had seen all
season. Despite the fact that the
time was the fastest in the country
this year, Malott finished coasting.
He ran an entirely different race
in the 880 than he did in the quar
ter. In the latter race he grabbed
the lead in a hurry and led all the
way. In the half-mile, however, Ma
lott was in the last place in a field
of nine starters at the end of the first
lap. Slowly he started to move up
until at the head of the stretch he
was a close sixth.
IVlalott Takes Lead
Once the field leveled out in the
final sprint for the tape it looked
like the race was between Charley
Miller and DcMott Modisette of Cal
and Oregon's Kirman Storli. Shoul
der to shoulder the trio spurted
toward the tape, when suddenly
from the rear Malott overtook them,
running so fast that he made them
look as if they were standing still.
Ray didn't get the lead until he was
15 yards from the tape, but in that
short distance he piled up a five
yard victory margin. Rusty March
pulled another upset when he hand
ed Stanford one point with his fifth
in the 880.
Ed Burrows' two wins in the mile
and two-mile were merely a repe
tition of his Big Meet double tri
umph. He held back and let the
others set the pace for him until
the final 150 yards. Then, he cocked
his head on his shoulder and am
bled past the leaders like a Packard
racing an Austin.
Burrows' Time
Ed's time of 4:17.9 in the mile set
up a new P.C.C. i-ccord, breaking the
12-year-old standard of 4:21.7, set,
by Arnold Gillette of Montana in
1926. Ed's time in the two-mile was
9:32.9, just 2'i> seconds short of Gil
lette's record of 9:30.4, which was
also made in 1926.
The new mile record was one of
three new marks tacked up, with
another being tied. Earl Vickery,
Trojan low hurdler, broke his own
23.5 record, set last year, when he
ambled the barriers in 23 fiat in Fri
day's trials. In the finals, Vickery
was leading until he hit a hurdle
and had to be content with fifth
place.
Javelin Record
Chuck Soper, barrel-chested Tro
jan, chalked up the third new rec
ord when he heaved the javelin 217
feet, 7 :t t inches. Bill Reitz of U. C.
L. A. held the old record, 210 feet, j
8 inches, made last year.
Adrian Talley tied the 100-yard
dash record when he nosed out
; Washington State's Lee Orr by frac
tions of an inch in 9.7. Russ Sweet
| of Moiitana in 1926 and Foy Draper
: of S.C. in 1936 had previously run
the same time.
I Pete Zagar, Indian discus throw
j er, couldn't add any distance to the
! toss of 155 feet, 5 r, Â« inches, that he
I made in Friday's preliminaries, but
he didn't need to. No one could bet
ter his mark Saturday, so he pro
vided the Indians with their fifth
and final win.
Although Woodrow Wilson Strode,
Ucla's Negro Adonis, won the shot
with a putt of 51 feet 6V2 inches,
Stanford nevertheless managed to
place three men in the event when
Tom Montgomery. Jack Lipman and
Stan Andersen finished two-three
five.
The Cards didn't do so well in
the other field events, failing to
: place in the javelin and broad
I jump. Russ Wulff and Ed Bernhauer
1 finished in a five-way tie for fourth
j in the high jump at 6 feet 2 inches
and Vic Boore tied for fifth in the
pole vault with Keith Monroe of Cal
at 13 feet even.
Completing the Card total, Stan
ford's relay quartet of Jerry Spar
ling, Craig Williamson, Carl Ma
hurin, and Malott, wound up in third

place behind Washington State and
California. The Cougar baton-pass
ing aggregation of Bob Littlejohn,
Curtis Ledford, Mel Pettichord, and
Lee Orr won in 3:15, which was a
new Edwards Stadium record.
High-point man of the meet was
Mack Robinson, Oregon's negro
flash, who won the broad jump and
low hurdles and finished fourth in
the 100 to grab 12 digits. Cougar Orr
also scintillated. Orr's powerful
drive in the furlong gave him an
easy victory by four yards over
Talley, while his sizzling finish in
the century just missed nipping
Talley by fractions of an inch.
