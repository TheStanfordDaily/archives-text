## Free Photos, Surprise Favors, Breakfast To Feature Program 
### 
Ozzie Nelson and his celebrated radio, dunce, and recording orchestra
were signed yesterday to play for the Senior Hull on June 17.
With almost half of the 350 hids already sold by the A.S.S.U. ofTiee at
$8.50 apiece. Chairman Ed Barnett announced last night that absolutely no
extra tickets will be issued.
Purpose of this restriction, according to Barnett. is to prevent over
crowding at the dance, which will be held in the Toyon Hall lobby from
10 to 4 o'clock.
Heading the parade of "big name bands" which has marched across
the I ai m dming the last three quarters, Nelson comes to Stanford direct

♦from a four-week stand at the Palo
mar Ballroom in Los Angeles.
Previous to that he played an ex
tended engagement at the Victor
Hugo restaurant.
Breakfast at Branner
Breakfast will be served in the
Branner Hall dining room from 1
to 3:30 o'clock so that none of the
dancers can complain of an inade
quate supply of food.
Tentative menu, as planned by
Bob Underwood, includes creamed
chicken, fresh peas. French fried po
tatoes, and chocolate ice cream rolls.
Tomato juice will be served as the
first course.
Special treat for dancers will be
3,000 Philip Morris cigarettes which
are being donated by the Union Cel
lar tobacco counter. This is the first
year that this has been done.

dered in the shape of portrait folders.
