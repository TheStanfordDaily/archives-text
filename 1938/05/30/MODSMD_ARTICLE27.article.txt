# Activities Keep Up Fast Pace

With Old Boy Bob Hartmann writ
ing the "Now That's," Chaparral has
slipped through eight-ninths of a
rather "average" year of publication.
Collie Small wrote about grooving
records, feuded with The Daily's Pat
McGuirk; Sister McGonigle, Chap
pie's No. 1 feminine writer, pounded
out "Now That Date" column; "Pop
Off" popped away; Melilnkoff con
tributed some clever rhymes; Pat
Bosqui designed some smartm etal
cut-outs; and Chappie excelled it
self in satirizing The Daily. Chap
pie's full-page peace ads were al
ways forceful, effective.
Gordy Frost herded The Daily
through the first half of the year,
gave up his office in January to Lloyd
Lapham. A year of conservative

editorial style and complete, accu
rate campus news coverage marked
The Daily. Zan Hammond and Art
Stokes were managing editors; Mags
Loud and Corena Crase, women's
editors. Newly-elected "big gun"
who will guide The Daily's destiny
through Volume 94 is Jim Stone.
"It failed to measure up to last
year's high."
This was the way campus opinion
branded the 1938 Quad, edited by
George McKenna. Though its pic
torial coverage of Farm life was
adequate, it was far from startling.
Campus Queens,' everyone agreed,
were lovely, but the idea seemed
anti-Stanford to most readers. Lack
of candid shots was another feature
that received criticism. Yet, this
year's annual was the first to appear
on time in a decade.
