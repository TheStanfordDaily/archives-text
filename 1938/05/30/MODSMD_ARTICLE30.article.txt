# Bad Precedents Frighten Excom
## 
### 
Following four days of freshman
pre-registration sponsored by the
pre-reg committee, Axe Society, and
A.S.S.U. leaders, lower division
registration opened the autumn
quarter of 1937 on Monday, Sep
tember 27, with a total day's en
rollment of 1101 students.
With President Ray Lyman Wil
bur vacationing in the mountains,

; official welcome greetings were ex
tended via The Daily by Acting
| Comptroller J. Hugh Jackson. Dr.
j Wilbur's return saw the Farm's so-
I cial events begin, on October 2. with
j the quarterly reception for new
j lower division students in the Wil
; bur home.
Handling and acclimatizing of new
I students was handed over to the
| care of living group sponsors as pre
reg activities eased to a close,
j Hardest task was that of Head En-
Jcina Sponsor Jack Calderwood and
| staff of 20, who showed 450 green
frosh the stigma attached to being a
i Stanford Rough. At Roble were
; Head Sponsor Jean Bird and her
| staff, who matched steps with Cal
; derwood.
i First major action of A.S.S.U.
| President Tom Killefer and Excom,
] Stanford's major political body, was
the approval of the proposed amal
j gamation of the four Card dramatic
| units under one heading, Stanford
I Stagers.
Following a lead of Daily editor
: ials and features, Excom made its
next major decision over a probe- of
I the Library study hour situation. A
! student poll was approved after
[Library Director Nathan Van Pat
ten termed a Daily poll "invalid,"
; and resulting count showed a stu
| dent vote of 438-47 in favor of li
-1 brary study hours on Sunday.
Farce of the year, as far as Ex
j Committee action was concerned,
i was action on a proposed "Spanish
j Aid'' dance. "Partisan action at
I Stanford," squirmed Excom, "a bad
j precedent." Plan for the dance was
formulated by the Stanford Student
Committee for Spanish Medical Aid.
