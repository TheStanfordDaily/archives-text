# Revolt Upsets Administrators
## 
### 
Leadership of feminine judicial
body, Women's Council, passes from
Caroline Hibbard to Barbara Good
rich next year.

Men's Council, under first term
leadership of John Dern, worked
i long much the same line as its
feminine counterpart. Spring quar
ter voting complications demanded
a revote for new positions, smoothed
out easily as Jack Beman took the
chair.
Celebrating its fourth birthday,
Women's Conference, chairmanned
by Sis Coonley, handled feminine
affairs capably, stepped into society
with the first Women's Conference
Fashion Show. Caroline Hibbard
will guide their activities next year.
Under Chairman Don Moulton
lnterfratcrnity Council handled ar
rangements of the Tarver Exchange
Scholarship which is to send Gordy
Frost to Heidelberg this summer.
Only change in policy was a sug
gested reorganization of rushing
pians to take effect next year. Last
term elections brought Bud McDuf
j fie to next year's chair.
Pan-Hell action ran along much
| the same trend, minus the scholar
| ship. Attempting to bring about
| more active co-operation between
| Hall and Row, Chairman Barbara
i Paine and associates worked hard,
j results are questionable. Under
I Jean Welch, Pan-Hell will try
! again next year.
Headache of the year in Pan-Hell
j activities, was the famed "Revolt at
1 Roble." After women of '41 voted
j to boycott the sorority in favor of
I the living group, a right-about face
| was executed in Roble t hat saved I lie
| day for the feminine Row.
