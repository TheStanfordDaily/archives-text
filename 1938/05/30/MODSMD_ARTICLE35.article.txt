### 
Farm dramatic moves during the
year-long season were close to
check-mate as the second month of
autumn quarter rolled in. Cause was
friction in executive machinery. So
lution of the problem, for present

Clay McDaniel decided discretion
was the better part of valor, ar

Selection of Martin Flavin's '"Blue

"Governor's Wife," while campus
critics award the April production
of "Kind Lady" the top niche.
"Murder in the Cathedral" and
"Don Juan" were spotty,
