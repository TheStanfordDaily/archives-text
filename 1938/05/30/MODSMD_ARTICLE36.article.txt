### 
r score for the year between
Stanford and Cal trackmen is at
present even—that Big Meet pasting
was equalled nicely by the outcome
of the conference meet in Berkeley
Saturday. The current question is,
what team can beat the Trojans?
Among other victories that were
soothing salve to the sundry wounds
Stanford has received in track this
year were the two doubles—Malott
in the quarter and half, and Bur
rows in the mile and two-mile. Cap
tain Ray showed the fans why he is
captain at Stanford, when he step
ped that :46.9 quarter, but he made
it a little better when he won the
880, too.
His time for the quarter must be
about the best in the country so
far this year, and bodes a record for
the Fuller'on Flyer before he fin
ishes the season. Half a second more
would have tied Eastman's record,
and under the right conditions half
a second doesn't constitute much im
provement in running.
J.t * #
FAR as the records are con
cerned, Ed Burrows is the best
miler on- the coast for 1938, and
also the best two-miler. The absence
of Zamperini Saturday isn't cause
for the unsympathetic to sour
grape Burrows' victory — an athlete
not only has to be able to perform
well in his event to get by, but he
has to stick by the rules that gov
ern the majority concerned. Bur
rows has a spotless reputation as an
athlete, as far as regulations are
concerned.
His competitive record has upon
it the blotch of last season, when
that broken ankle had him going
mentally and physically for a long
time. However, there can be no im
partial judges who will not concede
that that Seattle lad has more than
redeemed himself by winning the
distance double in both the Big Meet
and the Coast meet this year. And
if there is one who doubts that he is
a great competitor, let him cast the
first stone.

I ) 0N T let it out to those Tro
jans, but Gil LaCava, the Bev
erly Hills High high jumper who
.set a new international interscholas
tic record Saturday at Hollister in
the state meet at 6 ft. 7'/h in., was a
visitor on the Stanford campus over
the week-end.
Son of a Hollywood movie direc
tor, Gregory LaCava, the southern
California lad, ate at Encina, of all
places, Saturday night with three
freshmen who went to high school
with him. Bill Ellington, frosh
coaeh, went down to meet him with
two of the frosh who knew him,
and came home with fairy tales
running around in his head, they
say.
Les Steers, Palo Alto high school
lad and former great interscholastic
jumper, took a liking to LaCava
right off, and the two had quite a
jaw session over the week-end.
Steers will be here next year, it is
hoped.
LaCava wants to come to Stan
ford, but whether he will have the
necessary units is still in question.
But he sure can jump.

r score for the year between
Stanford and Cal trackmen is at
present even—that Big Meet pasting
was equalled nicely by the outcome
of the conference meet in Berkeley
Saturday. The current question is,
what team can beat the Trojans?
Among other victories that were
soothing salve to the sundry wounds
Stanford has received in track this
year were the two doubles—Malott
in the quarter and half, and Bur
rows in the mile and two-mile. Cap
tain Ray showed the fans why he is
captain at Stanford, when he step
ped that :46.9 quarter, but he made
it a little better when he won the
880, too.
His time for the quarter must be
about the best in the country so
far this year, and bodes a record for
the Fuller'on Flyer before he fin
ishes the season. Half a second more
would have tied Eastman's record,
and under the right conditions half
a second doesn't constitute much im
provement in running.
J.t * #
FAR as the records are con
cerned, Ed Burrows is the best
miler on- the coast for 1938, and
also the best two-miler. The absence
of Zamperini Saturday isn't cause
for the unsympathetic to sour
grape Burrows' victory — an athlete
not only has to be able to perform
well in his event to get by, but he
has to stick by the rules that gov
ern the majority concerned. Bur
rows has a spotless reputation as an
athlete, as far as regulations are
concerned.
His competitive record has upon
it the blotch of last season, when
that broken ankle had him going
mentally and physically for a long
time. However, there can be no im
partial judges who will not concede
that that Seattle lad has more than
redeemed himself by winning the
distance double in both the Big Meet
and the Coast meet this year. And
if there is one who doubts that he is
a great competitor, let him cast the
first stone.

I ) 0N T let it out to those Tro
jans, but Gil LaCava, the Bev
erly Hills High high jumper who
.set a new international interscholas
tic record Saturday at Hollister in
the state meet at 6 ft. 7'/h in., was a
visitor on the Stanford campus over
the week-end.
Son of a Hollywood movie direc
tor, Gregory LaCava, the southern
California lad, ate at Encina, of all
places, Saturday night with three
freshmen who went to high school
with him. Bill Ellington, frosh
coaeh, went down to meet him with
two of the frosh who knew him,
and came home with fairy tales
running around in his head, they
say.
Les Steers, Palo Alto high school
lad and former great interscholastic
jumper, took a liking to LaCava
right off, and the two had quite a
jaw session over the week-end.
Steers will be here next year, it is
hoped.
LaCava wants to come to Stan
ford, but whether he will have the
necessary units is still in question.
But he sure can jump.
