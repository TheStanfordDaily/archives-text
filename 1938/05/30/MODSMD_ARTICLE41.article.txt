# Golf Tourney Reaches Finals
## Doering Will Play Cannon for Title 
### 
Art Doering and Brown Cannon
will tee off sometime this week in
the 36-hole finals of Stanford's all-
University golf championship — the
definite date has not been set.
Cannon earned his way into the i
finals by nosing out Bob Breyer on i
the 18th hole, Friday, in the lower [
bracket semi-final match. For a
while it looked as though Breyer
would repeat his surprise perform
ance of last year, when, as a fresh
man, he turned the tables on the
tournament veterans, including fa
vorite Don Edwards, to meet Jack
Wallace in the finals.
After a hard-fought match, Wal
lace beat Breyer, 3 and 2, to take the
title. This year, Breyer continued his
habit of upsetting the favorites and
eliminated Wallace in the quarter
finals, two up.
Friday, Cannon and Breyer hooked
up in a see-saw battle all the way. j
They swapped the lead back and'
forth and finally went to the 18th
green all-square.
Cannon was 15 feet from the pin in
two and Breyer on the edge of the '
green with his second. Cannon took |
two putts for a par four. Breyer j
chipped, within six feet of the cup
on his third and, needing the putt for j
a have, rolled the ball two inches
from home where it stopped dead.
Art Doering rules as logical fa
vorite in this week's final. He was !
co-favored with Jack Wallace until
the defending champion was elimi
nated. Doering ran away from the j
field in the qualifying rounds, scor- '
ing a lusty 69-67—136, four under 1
par for two rounds and six strokes '
better than Pete Hass, runner-up.
He fought through a tougherj
bracket before reaching the finals, j
downing Bill Boyd, 3 and 2, Don j
Kennedy, 6 and 5, and Mac Stod- ;
dard, 5 and 3, in that order.
Cannon worked his way to the j
finals by beating his brother, George,!
6 and 5, Pete Hass, 4 and 2, and |
Bob Breyer, one up, successively.

Wallace in the finals.
After a hard-fought match, Wal
lace beat Breyer, 3 and 2, to take the
title. This year, Breyer continued his
habit of upsetting the favorites and
eliminated Wallace in the quarter
finals, two up.
Friday, Cannon and Breyer hooked
up in a see-saw battle all the way. j
They swapped the lead back and'
forth and finally went to the 18th
green all-square.
Cannon was 15 feet from the pin in
two and Breyer on the edge of the '
green with his second. Cannon took |
two putts for a par four. Breyer j
chipped, within six feet of the cup
on his third and, needing the putt for j
a have, rolled the ball two inches
from home where it stopped dead.
Art Doering rules as logical fa
vorite in this week's final. He was !
co-favored with Jack Wallace until
the defending champion was elimi
nated. Doering ran away from the j
field in the qualifying rounds, scor- '
ing a lusty 69-67—136, four under 1
par for two rounds and six strokes '
better than Pete Hass, runner-up.
He fought through a tougherj
bracket before reaching the finals, j
downing Bill Boyd, 3 and 2, Don j
Kennedy, 6 and 5, and Mac Stod- ;
dard, 5 and 3, in that order.
Cannon worked his way to the j
finals by beating his brother, George,!
6 and 5, Pete Hass, 4 and 2, and |
Bob Breyer, one up, successively.
