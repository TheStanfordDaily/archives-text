# 'Dear Stanford' Stuff

rnHERE should be something to say about Stan-
JL ford now, since it is nearly the last time I'll
have a chance to say anything. After two years
of having a somewhat inside view of a univer
sity in operation, there should be something
to sum up.
Perhaps sentimentality also should be ex
pressed, repentance for criticism, or justification
of that criticism on the grounds that we chasten
those whom we love. Like others, I might say
I'll be a flag-waving alumnus some day, and
that I'll drive back in my Packard to repay for
things I can't realize I'm getting.
But all I want to say to Stanford isâ€”you're
a damn fine school now, but don't forget to
change.
It's so easy to be satisfied and complacent
about all the things that make this a good place
to go to college, the Honor Code and honesty,
student government, pleasant surroundings,
rather accessible professors if you make an
effort to meet them, the rule against liquor on
the campus.
And because all these things add up to a
good system now, there's a tendency to feel
that the ultimate has been reached. We should
be conservative, solidify, hang on to what we
have. We tend to put up bars of tradition and
custom against change.
The liquor rule is a good example. Easily
justified pragmatically, somehow it has become
mixed up with the Founding Grant. Yet what
ever the Founders had to say, there was no
absolute ban on drink until around 1909, and
it's barely possible that changed attitudes and
manners may permit its return in the future.
And the criterion of a university is going to
change as culture itself changes. Stanford ful
fills a function very admirably now; it markets
a type of education and living for which there
is a demand. The demand, however, may fall
off.
The scope of the social science curriculum,
'or instance, has been enlarged to fulfill part
of the demand, while the real emphasis con
tinues to be concentrated on the technical and
scientific fields. Some day, that emphasis may
have to be shifted to meet a more exacting and
nerious interest in social affairs.
Student control, as now exercised, causes
near the minimum of irritation. Students 10
years from now may be a new breed, may need
io be handled differently.
Stanford will be 50 years old soon. I hope it
doesn't act its age.
