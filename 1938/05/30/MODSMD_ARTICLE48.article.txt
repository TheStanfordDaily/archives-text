ALTHOUGH it is comparatively easy to claim
thcit Stanford's activity whirl is flying apart
because it is unbalanced, it is difficult to know
what to do about it. Apparently what is needed
most is a reorganization of the calendar so that
!he pressure on spring quarter is distributed
over the whole year. Some simplification of
certain programs is in order, and less emphasis
02. njinor functions would do much to insure
complete success of major events.
Although the unbalance which now exists has
come haphazardly, it is obvious that it cannot
be righted in the same way. It will take patient
deliberation and the work of the best minds
that Stanford can find.
Probably co-ordination of activities could best
be obtained through a group like women's
"Clearing House." There, activities chairmen
meet to discuss their plans in relation to the
whole quarter's program; something similar
might work for the campus at large.
Early in fall, a committee of group representa
tives could meet, armed with the A.S.S.U. date
book. A list could be drawn up of the major
events of the year to come, their nature, and
their purpose. It would then be a matter of
portioning them out so that drives did not follow
each other too closely, so that name-band
dances were sufficiently infrequent to be suc
cessful, and so that fall, winter, and spring
quarters were equally active.
It might be necessary to cut out some func
tions which have been over-shadowed by more
important and more worth-while events. There
is where the trouble would come. Every big
wig would be fighting tooth and nail for his own
pet. Howls would arise that one event had been
killed by being held at the wrong time of the
year.
The saving grace of the shake-up, aside from
making this a much easier place to live in spring

quarter, is that it wouldn't have to be done again
for some time to come. After once straightening
out the mess that now exists, and making a few
corrections, in the following year, things could
ride on an even keel.
But the initial revolution would leave lots of
unrest on the campus. It would take Stanford
a while to get used to its new activities costume.
After that, though, it would feel like a new
man.—J. S.

deliberation and the work of the best minds
that Stanford can find.
Probably co-ordination of activities could best
be obtained through a group like women's
"Clearing House." There, activities chairmen
meet to discuss their plans in relation to the
whole quarter's program; something similar
might work for the campus at large.
Early in fall, a committee of group representa
tives could meet, armed with the A.S.S.U. date
book. A list could be drawn up of the major
events of the year to come, their nature, and
their purpose. It would then be a matter of
portioning them out so that drives did not follow
each other too closely, so that name-band
dances were sufficiently infrequent to be suc
cessful, and so that fall, winter, and spring
quarters were equally active.
It might be necessary to cut out some func
tions which have been over-shadowed by more
important and more worth-while events. There
is where the trouble would come. Every big
wig would be fighting tooth and nail for his own
pet. Howls would arise that one event had been
killed by being held at the wrong time of the
year.
The saving grace of the shake-up, aside from
making this a much easier place to live in spring

quarter, is that it wouldn't have to be done again
for some time to come. After once straightening
out the mess that now exists, and making a few
corrections, in the following year, things could
ride on an even keel.
But the initial revolution would leave lots of
unrest on the campus. It would take Stanford
a while to get used to its new activities costume.
After that, though, it would feel like a new
man.—J. S.
