# BULL SESSION
## L'ENVOI

\\/ITII term papers thick us flics these days, even
Stanford's leading commentator, reconteur, and
politico, Emery Bellwether, has been forced to aban
don his pretense of not going to the Libe. I ran into
him there last night, sweating over a copy of some
long-forgotten tome he had hauled out of the archives
at the behest of one of his more enterprising instruc
tors.
He greeted me with obvious relief, slamming the
volume shut with a vindictive finality which expressed
in one swift motion his opinion of education in gen
eral and term papers in particular.
"Well," he said. "Don't tell me they've got you
studying, too."
"More or less," f admitted. "What with The Dippy
folding Tuesday "
"Not really!"
"I can't say I like the tone of that remark."
"Nonsense! Merely expressing relief, that's all—al
though I will admit some of my classes are going to
seem longer without it. No more Bull Session for
you, hm?"
"Nope. Having held it in trust for Mr. Cobbs while
he was elsewhere engaged, 1 am returning it to his
capable hands next volume."
"I suppose you feel you've accomplished something
with it. They always do."
"f don't know, frankly. There's no real way of
judging. It's been a lot of fun, at any rate."
"And of course you feel you've presented a divert
ing diet to your readers, if any."
"I know I've tried to. I've tried to keep a pretty
even balance between what I felt on certain things,
what the campus as a whole seemed to feel on certain
things, and my comment on events and personalities
in the national and international procession. A com
paratively varied record, I think. Much too dogmatic,
in many cases, but giving an impression of knowledge,
if nothing else."
"Yes, I know. That's the advantage print gives you
people. It may not mean a darn thing, but, brother, it
certainly has a terrific authority when you see it in
the papers. Which isn't altogether a good thing, in this
day and age. However, that's not. a problem to solve
in the Libe when I'm supposed to be doing a term
paper."
"I'm sorry," I said. "I shall withdraw from the pres
ence of genius at work."
"Do," he said. "But before you go—you realize
this is probably the last time you'll be seeing me."
"Oh, that's right. Well, if I don't run into you
again, take good care of yourself. No more politics; no
more throwing dead cats at the administration."
"Me, throwing dead cats at the administration!
Look who's talking!"
"Good-bye, Bellwether," I said firmly. "Have a
good summer."
"I will," he said. "So long."
And as I looked back when I reached the door I
could see him—the man who gave a name to the Cord
Complex and favored the 9 o'clock starting hour, the
man who heckled the Libe and undertook the most un
usual political campaign in Farm history, the man
who wanted to see the Board of Trustees do some
thing about the boathouse, and is still waiting to see
the Board of Trustees do something about the boat
house—the peepul's friend, Emery Bellwether—turn
back with a martyred air to his book and his doubt
less overdue term paper.

"Not really!"
"I can't say I like the tone of that remark."
"Nonsense! Merely expressing relief, that's all—al
though I will admit some of my classes are going to
seem longer without it. No more Bull Session for
you, hm?"
"Nope. Having held it in trust for Mr. Cobbs while
he was elsewhere engaged, 1 am returning it to his
capable hands next volume."
"I suppose you feel you've accomplished something
with it. They always do."
"f don't know, frankly. There's no real way of
judging. It's been a lot of fun, at any rate."
"And of course you feel you've presented a divert
ing diet to your readers, if any."
"I know I've tried to. I've tried to keep a pretty
even balance between what I felt on certain things,
what the campus as a whole seemed to feel on certain
things, and my comment on events and personalities
in the national and international procession. A com
paratively varied record, I think. Much too dogmatic,
in many cases, but giving an impression of knowledge,
if nothing else."
"Yes, I know. That's the advantage print gives you
people. It may not mean a darn thing, but, brother, it
certainly has a terrific authority when you see it in
the papers. Which isn't altogether a good thing, in this
day and age. However, that's not. a problem to solve
in the Libe when I'm supposed to be doing a term
paper."
"I'm sorry," I said. "I shall withdraw from the pres
ence of genius at work."
"Do," he said. "But before you go—you realize
this is probably the last time you'll be seeing me."
"Oh, that's right. Well, if I don't run into you
again, take good care of yourself. No more politics; no
more throwing dead cats at the administration."
"Me, throwing dead cats at the administration!
Look who's talking!"
"Good-bye, Bellwether," I said firmly. "Have a
good summer."
"I will," he said. "So long."
And as I looked back when I reached the door I
could see him—the man who gave a name to the Cord
Complex and favored the 9 o'clock starting hour, the
man who heckled the Libe and undertook the most un
usual political campaign in Farm history, the man
who wanted to see the Board of Trustees do some
thing about the boathouse, and is still waiting to see
the Board of Trustees do something about the boat
house—the peepul's friend, Emery Bellwether—turn
back with a martyred air to his book and his doubt
less overdue term paper.

\\/ITII term papers thick us flics these days, even
Stanford's leading commentator, reconteur, and
politico, Emery Bellwether, has been forced to aban
don his pretense of not going to the Libe. I ran into
him there last night, sweating over a copy of some
long-forgotten tome he had hauled out of the archives
at the behest of one of his more enterprising instruc
tors.
He greeted me with obvious relief, slamming the
volume shut with a vindictive finality which expressed
in one swift motion his opinion of education in gen
eral and term papers in particular.
"Well," he said. "Don't tell me they've got you
studying, too."
"More or less," f admitted. "What with The Dippy
folding Tuesday "
"Not really!"
