# Band Drum Major Weds Assistant
## 
### 
The Stanford band's long-time
drum major, Bill "Red" Okker, and
his chief assistant baton-twirler,
Alice Swift, were married Saturday
in the Chapel.
Last fall the 6'a-foot leader, top
ped by his 24-inch hat, paced the
band on the field for his twelfth Big
Game. He's been doing it every year
since 1925, with one exception â€”
1931.
Both Okker and Miss Swift are
Stanford graduates, and Okker has,
in addition, finished med school.
