IN ONE of our last columns wc happened to mention
that we thought sorpe records .sounded "white"
and some sounded "black." And much to our .sur
prise we found that the use of these terms occasioned
considerable comment, and so we thought a little ex
planatory note might aid in the interpretation of these
terms as used by swing musicians.
The best way wc know of to do it is to tell you
of some records which are considered "black" or
"white." To this end we recommend that you listen
to Casa Loma's disk of "Memories of You," which
features Sonny Durham on trumpet, and to any broad
cast of Frankie Trombar in which Mannie Klien does
the trumpet swings.
In these instances you'll hear well-rounded tones,
and certain ideas that seem to be characteristic, as a
whole, of "whtie" musicians. Perhaps that is where the
term "white" came from; wc are none too sure.
On the other side of the downbeat listen to Jimmy
Lunceford's "Margie" and "Raggin' the Scale" as two
random examples. A comparison of the tones and
techniques of the two groups will soon make you
aware that the Lunceford men have a tone that we
describe as "black." How this originates we can't
really tell, except that we have heard this tone va
riously described as "mean," "wicked." and "dirty."
From "dirty" we think that the term "black" has
originated, and then, too, the fact that colored mu
sicians have almost universally adopted this technique
may have influenced the term's coinage.
♦ * * *
While we are on the subject, we can mention two
of the new releases that might add a little weight to
the discussion. On Brunswick 7583, "Hot Lips" Page
can be heard with two releases. "Skull Duggery" and
"Jumpin'" are their titles, and "Hot Lips." whose
name should have been "Iron Lips," whips out with
some nice trumpet work in the black mood. On the
other hand, T. Dorsey's weekly contribution is Bay
Noble's latest, "I Hadn't Anyone Till You. ' Pee Wee
Irwin is the trumpet, and to our taste, colorless as
usual.

By now the comments on the Senior Ball band,
Ozzie Nelson, will be getting under way. Our opinion
is that he is the typical prom band. He isn't swing in
the true sense, but on the other hand, unusual arrange
ments plus atypical orchestrations mark him as dis
tinctive and very enjoyable. His saxes don't quaver,
his brass doesn't overblow, and he plays tempos that
can be danced to without falling back on any Balboa
techniques.
We thoroughly approve of the choice made by
Barnett.

some nice trumpet work in the black mood. On the
other hand, T. Dorsey's weekly contribution is Bay
Noble's latest, "I Hadn't Anyone Till You. ' Pee Wee
Irwin is the trumpet, and to our taste, colorless as

By now the comments on the Senior Ball band,
Ozzie Nelson, will be getting under way. Our opinion
is that he is the typical prom band. He isn't swing in
the true sense, but on the other hand, unusual arrange
ments plus atypical orchestrations mark him as dis
tinctive and very enjoyable. His saxes don't quaver,
his brass doesn't overblow, and he plays tempos that
can be danced to without falling back on any Balboa
techniques.
We thoroughly approve of the choice made by
Barnett.

IN ONE of our last columns wc happened to mention
that we thought sorpe records .sounded "white"
and some sounded "black." And much to our .sur
prise we found that the use of these terms occasioned
considerable comment, and so we thought a little ex
planatory note might aid in the interpretation of these
terms as used by swing musicians.
The best way wc know of to do it is to tell you
of some records which are considered "black" or
"white." To this end we recommend that you listen
to Casa Loma's disk of "Memories of You," which
features Sonny Durham on trumpet, and to any broad
cast of Frankie Trombar in which Mannie Klien does
the trumpet swings.
In these instances you'll hear well-rounded tones,
and certain ideas that seem to be characteristic, as a
whole, of "whtie" musicians. Perhaps that is where the
term "white" came from; wc are none too sure.
On the other side of the downbeat listen to Jimmy
Lunceford's "Margie" and "Raggin' the Scale" as two
random examples. A comparison of the tones and
techniques of the two groups will soon make you
aware that the Lunceford men have a tone that we
describe as "black." How this originates we can't
really tell, except that we have heard this tone va
riously described as "mean," "wicked." and "dirty."
From "dirty" we think that the term "black" has
originated, and then, too, the fact that colored mu
sicians have almost universally adopted this technique
may have influenced the term's coinage.

While we are on the subject, we can mention two
of the new releases that might add a little weight to
the discussion. On Brunswick 7583, "Hot Lips" Page
can be heard with two releases. "Skull Duggery" and
"Jumpin'" are their titles, and "Hot Lips." whose
name should have been "Iron Lips," whips out with
some nice trumpet work in the black mood. On the
other hand, T. Dorsey's weekly contribution is Bay
Noble's latest, "I Hadn't Anyone Till You. ' Pee Wee
Irwin is the trumpet, and to our taste, colorless as
usual.
