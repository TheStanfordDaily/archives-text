# Hayes 'Impish' as Portia, But Sofaer Steals Scenes
## 
### 
"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE,''
slated for a repeat matinee, Fri
day, June 3, at San Francisco's
Curran:
There's no blinking the fact that
Shakespeare is meant to be played.
When 1 saw how Helen Hayes and

Abraham Sofaer
take a lot of fancy
Elizabethan talk
and a set of stage
directions consist
ing solely of "en
ter" and "exeunt"
and make living
drama out of them
it dawned on me
how much rope
is given the actors

by the playwright. And you can
bet your fedora that Gilbert Miller's
troupe lassoed every last scrap of
meaning, avoided hanging them
selves by ham theatrics.
After the usual Portia played by
some chesty old warhorse who
wheezes "the quality of mercy"
speech with one foot planted on a
footlight and the other in the grave,
Helen Hayes bobs up to remind us
that Portia was not a soggy blue
stocking, but a cute little trick on a
lark. Her Portia is more of an imp
than anything else. By a flick of her
wrist, or one clear, merry intonation,
Miss Hayes braces a whole scene,
sparks the rest of the actors.
However, it falls mainly to Shy
lock to snake a scene out of reach
of other players. With his leathery

skin, scraggly corkscrew beard, and
long, bony forefinger, Abraham So
faer had the most picturesque get
up in the play. And all the aspects of
this one character — Shy lock, the
stern and bitter patriarch; Shylock,
the violent; Shylock, the crafty and
stony; Shylock, the pathetic and
broken—Mr. Sofaer put across in the
most vivid performance of the whole
show.
However, I had a hunch that
"Shylock" played to the groundlings
now and then. He got a big hand for
it all right, but obvious tear-jerking
seems to me to be particularly tinny
coming from him.
Pedro de Cordoba cannily made of
the Duke of Morocco a stuffed shirt
in purple velvet trappings; Raymond
Johnson spiked the role of the fat
faced clown, Lancelot Gobbo; and
Peter Mather did a nifty job of
Gratiano.
Give "Victoria" the go-by if need
be, but by all means catch this one
on the fly next Friday.
