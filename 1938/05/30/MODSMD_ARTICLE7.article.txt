# B.A.C. Head To Speak At S.P.U.
## Thursday's Meeting Will Bar Outsiders; C.I.O. To Be Subject 
### 
Wesley Howell, chairman of the
Board of Athletic Control and a
Stanford graduate, is to be the lead
ing speaker at the Stanford Polit
ical Union meeting Thursday, June
2. He will talk about the Commit
tee of Industrial Organization and
its policies.
Mr. Howell is affiliated with the
San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce and is a member of the Com
mittee of 43 which at the present
time is negotiating with the C.1.0.
in San Francisco.
Closed Meeting
The Public Exercises Committee
would not allow Mr. Howell to speak
at an open meeting of the S.P.U.,
it was said, because such a prece
dent might allow undesirable speak
ers to be brought in at some fu
ture time. Consequently, the
meeting Thursday will be closed to
all visitors.
Arthur Eggleston, who writes
"The Labor Scene" for the San
Francisco Chronicle, also has been
invited to attend the meeting as a
guest.
The subject of the meeting is "Re
solved, that this body support the
policies of the C.1.0." The labor
party of the union will support the
resolution and the attack will be
headed by George Tyler, a senior
majoring in Poli Sci.
Hopkins Comments
Mark Hopkins, leader of the labor
party, said yesterday, "Not only has
the C.1.0. organized the semi-skilled
and the unskilled workers and giv
en a new impetus to the American
Labor Movement, but it constitutes
one of the greatest bulwarks against
Fascism in the United States."
Speakers for the Liberal and Con
servative pftrties have not been an
nounced, but the Liberal party is
expected to support the general
policies of the C.1.0. although ob
jecting to some of its tactics.
Liberals Rebel
A certain number of the Liberals
have formed an insurrectionist
movement aligning themselves with
the Conservatives, according to some
of the members of the Liberalist
party.
The Conservatives are expected
to take a stand directly opposed to
that taken by the Laborites and op
posed to the present policies and
tactics of the Labor Union.
Speeches Cut
The opening speeches have been
cut from 10 minutes to 5 in order to
speed up the meetings, and the re
plying and supporting speeches
have been cut to three minutes, al
lowing for extra time during cross
questioning from the floor of the
house.
The elections for next year's offi
cers will be held at a business meet
ing first. The Liberal party, in a
caucus last week, decided to put up
Vincent Lemmon for president and
Bob Curtis, vice-president. Slates
for the other two parties have not
been announced.
