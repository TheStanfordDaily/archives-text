### BILL MILLIS 
RATIONALISM, in the eighteenth
century and early years of the
nineteenth centuries, was a "higher
patriotism" that was not at odds with
the cosmopolitan Enlightenment and
that belief in Democracy, Science,
Rationalism and Progress (capital
ized because they would so empha
size them) which distinguished those
"citizens of the world" who thought
that in the end armies of principles
would succeed where armies of sol
diers and of diplomats would fail.
In the century that has followed,
that has not happened. Principles,
whether in government, politics, or
social ethics, have never been held
in lower esteem, and the armies of
diplomats and of soldiers have never
been more firmly in power.
The nationalism that once led to
peace has long since disappeared,
and the principle of absolute and un
questioning obedience to the will of
the state has been transformed into
a chauvinism that knows no moder
ation and a bigotry that knows no
tolerance. Two decades ago nation
alism provoked the martial spirit; in
our time it is doing the same thing
for a world that is beating its plough
shares into swords.
Yesterday was Memorial Day,
and America's turn to bow to a
spirit which dominates all na
tions—the democracies, the Fas
cists. and the Communists — and
for which none is particularly at
blame.
At Gettysburg, Va., Republican
Senator Arthur 11. Vandenberg
used the occasion to quote Lin
coln and attack New Deal "man
ipulators and rcgimenters who
would chain us to centralized bu
reaucracy at Washington," but a
more typical expression came
from Democratic Senator David I.
Walsh.

Affairs Committee said that because
"the very foundations of the mod

national defense "so strong no

Major General Paul B. Malonc,

in saying: "This Nation has but
one destiny under God and one
constitution. In the name of hum-
Mi' soldiers and great military

tons of high explosives over the
South China capital of Canton,
bringing the estimated week-end toll
to 1500 dead and 5000 wounded.
The twenty planes directed their
attack on the vital railway of Kow

remaining port of entry for war
equipment.

neither bombs nor propaganda
leaflets, were "apparently piloted

RATIONALISM, in the eighteenth
century and early years of the
nineteenth centuries, was a "higher
patriotism" that was not at odds with
the cosmopolitan Enlightenment and
that belief in Democracy, Science,
Rationalism and Progress (capital
ized because they would so empha
size them) which distinguished those
"citizens of the world" who thought
that in the end armies of principles
would succeed where armies of sol
diers and of diplomats would fail.
In the century that has followed,
that has not happened. Principles,
whether in government, politics, or
social ethics, have never been held
in lower esteem, and the armies of
diplomats and of soldiers have never
been more firmly in power.
The nationalism that once led to
peace has long since disappeared,
and the principle of absolute and un
questioning obedience to the will of
the state has been transformed into
a chauvinism that knows no moder
ation and a bigotry that knows no
tolerance. Two decades ago nation
alism provoked the martial spirit; in
our time it is doing the same thing
for a world that is beating its plough
shares into swords.
Yesterday was Memorial Day,
and America's turn to bow to a
spirit which dominates all na
tions—the democracies, the Fas
cists. and the Communists — and
for which none is particularly at
blame.

Senator Arthur 11. Vandenberg

ipulators and rcgimenters who

reaucracy at Washington," but a
more typical expression came
from Democratic Senator David I.
