Shades of a sell-out burst forth on
the Senior Ball committee last night
as Chairman Ed Barnett announced
that more than half of the $8.50 bids
have already been sold.
The number of tickets has been
limited to 350, according to Barnett,
who said that such a restriction is
necessary to avoid overcrowding.
"We can't raise the limit now," he
said, "because the correct number of
bids and the right amount of food
have already been ordered.
