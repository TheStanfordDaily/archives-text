# Daily Celebrates Witching Hour
## 
### 
Last night about 12 o'clock,
Lang Swent, Daily business
manager, came into the Daily
edit room. For a business man
ager, he was looking happy.
After generously pasusng out
ice cream and cookies to all of
the staff, he solemnly raised
his cup of ice cream, said a few
words, and then nibbled from
it. With him, the staff raised
cups, nibbled.
Then they did it once more,
equally solemnly. They were
toasting Daily Volumes 93 and
04. Because last night at 12
o'clock, Volume 03 folded.
The Daily, for one more year,
has ceased publication.
