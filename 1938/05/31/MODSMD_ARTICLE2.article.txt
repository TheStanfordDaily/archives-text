# Killefer Says Farm Needs New Boards
## President Urges Aid To Foster Continuity And Co-ordination 
### 
Recommending the establishment
of a board for co-ordinating activi
ties, and the adoption of permanent
councils to eliminate as far as pos
sible lack of continuity from year to
year, Student Body President Tom
Killefer yesterday made the follow
ing statement:
"On the eve of completion to an
other year of student self-govern
ment at Stanford we can at last push
our heads up through the din and
confusion of reorganizing Dramatic
Council, the Ski Club controversy,
Student-Faculty problems, Married
Men's Club, the Personal Problems
course, etc., and critically evaluate
our entire system.
Views A.S.S.U.
"From the vantage point of this
four-year perspective, 1 can see that
our student government is in no wise
perfect. It compares more than fa
vorably, however, with the student
governments at other colleges and
universities. The three national and
regional conferences of student pres
idents this past year in which I par
ticipated as your representative have
borne out this contention.
"Whenever student voice in the
curriculum, or student control of
this or that activity is discussed, one
finds that Stanford has usually al
ready recognized the problem and
has taken the lead in inaugurating
student - controlled machinery for
solving it.
"We have always been accepted by
other universities as a leading insti
tution with a student body intelli
gently progressive to the limits of
good taste, and we must co-operate
to maintain this position.
Human Nature Factor
"Most of our mistakes may be at
tributed to that old alibi, human
nature, but it is my belief that two
or three remedial measures em
barked upon as soon as possible may
strengthen our future student gov
ernment considerably.
"Some sort of board or agency for
co-ordinating activities, distributing
committee appointments, and oper
ating the new activity file is badly
needed.
Permanent Groups Needed
"The lack in continuity that hand
cuffs progressive student govern
ment in many institutions can be
further diminished by a permanent
peace council, a permanent leader
ship institute, and so on. These arc
merely suggestive of the type of im
provement which you might con
sider for next year.
"Before saying goodbye to you
all, may I express my sincere appre
ciation to the student body in gen
eral, and to Chuck Fontius. Barbara
Murphy, and the Executive Commit
tee in particular for the fine co-op
erative attitude which has been a
distinguishing factor in year's
activities.
Success Due to Co-operation
"What success we have enjoyed
has been a product of this co-opera
tion, and I thank you for it, as well
as for the opportunity of working
with you all in the interests of a
better and more democratic student
government.
"In 'Beebs' Lee you have wisely
chosen a man of judgment and lead
ership ability who will prove to be
a fine student body president. The
best of luck to both of you."
