## Student Manager Urges Analysis Of Policies, Activities Groups 
### 
Most significant problem facing the A.S.S.IJ. as the present year ends
is the policy toward special interest groups, according to the annual re
port of Chuck Fontius. retiring student manager.
In the report, Fontius recommends that the committee next fall make
a "thorough analysis" of the entire question and all its ramifications lt»

a definite policy for fu
ture guidance.
Of the problem, which arose when
Married Men's Club requested funds
to carry on its activities, Fontius
says:
"A very significant problem was
raised by Married Men's Club this
year in its request for a grant of
money from Associated Students
funds with which to carry on its
program. There was no question
about the reasonableness of the re
quest, either in amount or purpose,
but it was felt that a very import
ant question of principle was in
volved, as to whether or not the
Associated Students could follow a
policy of granting funds to every
special interest group on the campus
that was able to present a worth
while program to Ex Committee.
"It is recommended that a tho
| rough analysis be made of the en
tire question and all its ratifica
tions. If results of the study seem
to indicate that the policy establish
ed in connection with the Married
Men's request this year is sound,
special appropriations from the
' Women's Conference budget to
sponsors, off-campus women, and
graduate women should be discon
tinued."
Dramatics Set-up
j Turning to the new Dramatics
Council set-up, Fontius says: "It is
foolish to presume the new by-laws
I are the answer to our dramatics
i problems until they have proved
themselves in practice."
He recommends that Stagers'
[scholarship be approved on an an
nual basis to prevent a fixed ex
pense which would be burdensome
in lean years.
He strongly urges that no ma
jor production hereafter be pre
sented in winter quarter "unless
an exceptional show can be found
and good dates obtained . . . and
it is doubtful if there will be such
a thing as good dates if the in
! terest in skiing continues."
Of the Concert Series, which this
j year made a profit of more than
'$1000. Fontius explains, "the new
scale of prices used and the reduc
tion in number of attractions pre
sented were experimental measures
designed to offset the reduced seat
ing capacity in Memorial Hall.
! While the profit shown evidences
the success of these changes, it.
j would seem advisable to analyze the
(situation again in an effort to in
j corporate any improvements that
past experience and future condi
i tions render expedient."
Record Erased
Director Raymond Kendall and
Managers Oliver Cope and Alice
Allen have led the Men's and
j Women's Glee Clubs in "erasing an
other page of the unenviable rec
! ord of Stanford Glee Clubs of a
few years back," Fontius believes,
j and to him it appears advisable that
a subsidy of $f)00 be continued un
; til "the University Music Depart
j ment sees its way clear to absorb
j ing the director's salary."
Cardinals he found "justified their
j existence" despite "criticism direct
ed at the 'self-perpetuating' features
of Cardinals during the past year."
Revision of the Hammer and Coflin
Society charter, incorporating all
important rules and regulations
governing Associated Students and
i their subsidiary organizations, will
I eliminate friction which has existed
i for several years between the so
| ciety and the Associated Students
.Fontius predicts.
He finds that the present Dividex
set-up has been successful in the
experimental stage, but suggests
further analysis to determine
whether or not the structure which
has grown up can be improved.
Proposal that Women's Confer
ence get no more than $100 for its
scholarship fund and that any ex
penses over the amount required
for Fashion Show and other fund
raising programs be deducted from
the gross before money goes to the
University is incorporated in Fon
tius' report. This, he says, is a
safeguard against gradually in
creasing the appropriation until the
A.S.S.U. is advancing full amount
of the scholarship.
Part of the present A.S.S.U. sur
plus should be applied on reduction
of the debt to the University for
construction of Memorial Hall be
cause, Fontius says, interest rates
on savings accounts and on the loan
are so varying as to be too ex
pensive to the student account.
Careful handling of the Conval
escent Home Drive is urged in the
report. "It should be remembered
that the Convalescent Home is
Stanford's own charity," he says,
[ "and the interest in it should not
be allowed to be depreciated by
any other drives. It would be well
for members of drive committees
and Ex Committee to keep inter
est in the Convalescent Home para
mount in their minds when passing
upon advisability of money-making
schemes."

Most significant problem facing the A.S.S.IJ. as the present year ends

Of the problem, which arose when
Married Men's Club requested funds
to carry on its activities, Fontius
says:
"A very significant problem was
raised by Married Men's Club this
year in its request for a grant of
money from Associated Students
funds with which to carry on its
program. There was no question
about the reasonableness of the re
quest, either in amount or purpose,
but it was felt that a very import
ant question of principle was in
volved, as to whether or not the
Associated Students could follow a
policy of granting funds to every
special interest group on the campus
that was able to present a worth
while program to Ex Committee.
"It is recommended that a tho
| rough analysis be made of the en
tire question and all its ratifica
tions. If results of the study seem
to indicate that the policy establish

Dramatics Set-up

Council set-up, Fontius says: "It is

He recommends that Stagers'
[scholarship be approved on an an
nual basis to prevent a fixed ex
pense which would be burdensome
in lean years.
He strongly urges that no ma

cause, Fontius says, interest rates
on savings accounts and on the loan
are so varying as to be too ex
pensive to the student account.
Careful handling of the Conval
escent Home Drive is urged in the
report. "It should be remembered
that the Convalescent Home is
Stanford's own charity," he says,
[ "and the interest in it should not
be allowed to be depreciated by
any other drives. It would be well
for members of drive committees
and Ex Committee to keep inter
est in the Convalescent Home para
mount in their minds when passing
upon advisability of money-making
schemes."
Most significant problem facing the A.S.S.IJ. as the present year ends
is the policy toward special interest groups, according to the annual re
port of Chuck Fontius. retiring student manager.
In the report, Fontius recommends that the committee next fall make
a "thorough analysis" of the entire question and all its ramifications lt»

a definite policy for fu
ture guidance.
Of the problem, which arose when
Married Men's Club requested funds
to carry on its activities, Fontius
says:
"A very significant problem was
raised by Married Men's Club this
year in its request for a grant of
money from Associated Students
funds with which to carry on its
program. There was no question
about the reasonableness of the re
quest, either in amount or purpose,
but it was felt that a very import
ant question of principle was in
volved, as to whether or not the
Associated Students could follow a
policy of granting funds to every
special interest group on the campus
that was able to present a worth
while program to Ex Committee.
"It is recommended that a tho
| rough analysis be made of the en
tire question and all its ratifica
tions. If results of the study seem
to indicate that the policy establish
ed in connection with the Married
Men's request this year is sound,
special appropriations from the
' Women's Conference budget to
sponsors, off-campus women, and
graduate women should be discon
tinued."
Dramatics Set-up
j Turning to the new Dramatics
Council set-up, Fontius says: "It is
foolish to presume the new by-laws
I are the answer to our dramatics
i problems until they have proved
themselves in practice."
He recommends that Stagers'
[scholarship be approved on an an
nual basis to prevent a fixed ex
pense which would be burdensome
in lean years.
He strongly urges that no ma
jor production hereafter be pre
sented in winter quarter "unless
an exceptional show can be found
and good dates obtained . . . and
it is doubtful if there will be such
a thing as good dates if the in
! terest in skiing continues."
Of the Concert Series, which this
j year made a profit of more than
'$1000. Fontius explains, "the new
scale of prices used and the reduc
tion in number of attractions pre
sented were experimental measures
designed to offset the reduced seat
ing capacity in Memorial Hall.
! While the profit shown evidences
the success of these changes, it.
j would seem advisable to analyze the
(situation again in an effort to in
j corporate any improvements that
past experience and future condi
i tions render expedient."
Record Erased
Director Raymond Kendall and
Managers Oliver Cope and Alice
Allen have led the Men's and
j Women's Glee Clubs in "erasing an
other page of the unenviable rec
! ord of Stanford Glee Clubs of a
few years back," Fontius believes,
j and to him it appears advisable that
a subsidy of $f)00 be continued un
; til "the University Music Depart
j ment sees its way clear to absorb
j ing the director's salary."
Cardinals he found "justified their
j existence" despite "criticism direct
ed at the 'self-perpetuating' features
of Cardinals during the past year."
Revision of the Hammer and Coflin
Society charter, incorporating all
important rules and regulations
governing Associated Students and
i their subsidiary organizations, will
I eliminate friction which has existed
i for several years between the so
| ciety and the Associated Students
.Fontius predicts.
He finds that the present Dividex
set-up has been successful in the
experimental stage, but suggests
further analysis to determine
whether or not the structure which
has grown up can be improved.
Proposal that Women's Confer
ence get no more than $100 for its
scholarship fund and that any ex
penses over the amount required
for Fashion Show and other fund
raising programs be deducted from
the gross before money goes to the
University is incorporated in Fon
tius' report. This, he says, is a
safeguard against gradually in
creasing the appropriation until the
A.S.S.U. is advancing full amount
of the scholarship.
Part of the present A.S.S.U. sur
plus should be applied on reduction
of the debt to the University for
construction of Memorial Hall be
