# Two Major Rebuilding Jobs Planned Here
## Summer Construction Projects Slated By Sigma Chis, Phi Sigs 
### 
Striking a new low in campus
summer-quarter "face-lifting" will
be this year's construction program,
which includes only two major
building changes on the Row and j
an" Administration program which i
can be called practically "nil."
Largest single item in this year's J
program is a $;J!S.()00 Sigma Chi j
house.
Phi Sig Plans
Although permission of the Board
of Trustees has yet to be granted, in
all probability the Phi Sigs will also
be lodged in an entirely revised
house next fall. Present plans are i
to spend $30,000 in converting the ;
present structure into a "Normandy 1
farm house."
Even more indefinite than the Phi .
Sig's is the new K.A. house. Present j
plans call for a $30,000 white stucco |
building, with a high pillared front I
porch, but whether it will be com- |
pletely new. a remodeling job, or |
may wait another year, is not yet j
certain.
Alpha Phi's Remodel
The largest building job among
the sororities will be undertaken by 1
the Alpha Phi's, who plan to spend
at least $10,000 in remodeling.
Smaller construction jobs are
scheduled by both the Kappas and
the Tlietas. The remodeling of the
kitchen and back hall, and the addi
tion of a sleeping porch make up the
Thetas' present plans, while the
Kappas will "do over" their entire
second floor.
S.A.E.'s Plan New Porch
Plans for a new porch and "front"
on the S.A.E. house, costing from
$(5,000 to $10,000, are still indefinite.
The rheta Delts are already busy on
their terracing and road - grading '
program, which will extend on to the j
adjoining lot, a University donation j
this year.
The only important building item !
in the Administration's summer pro
gram is the completion and furnish
ing of the Cubberley Education
Building. The work should be com
pleted by September 1, and the
building ready for use by the begin
ning of fall quarter.

plans call for a $30,000 white stucco |
building, with a high pillared front I
porch, but whether it will be com- |
pletely new. a remodeling job, or |
may wait another year, is not yet j
certain.
Alpha Phi's Remodel
The largest building job among
the sororities will be undertaken by 1
the Alpha Phi's, who plan to spend
at least $10,000 in remodeling.
Smaller construction jobs are
scheduled by both the Kappas and
the Tlietas. The remodeling of the
kitchen and back hall, and the addi
tion of a sleeping porch make up the
Thetas' present plans, while the
Kappas will "do over" their entire
second floor.
S.A.E.'s Plan New Porch
Plans for a new porch and "front"
on the S.A.E. house, costing from
$(5,000 to $10,000, are still indefinite.
The rheta Delts are already busy on
their terracing and road - grading '
program, which will extend on to the j
adjoining lot, a University donation j
this year.
The only important building item !
in the Administration's summer pro
gram is the completion and furnish
ing of the Cubberley Education
Building. The work should be com
pleted by September 1, and the
building ready for use by the begin
ning of fall quarter.
