# They Look to the Future

### 
Today the curtain drops on another year of Stanford life as it
has been recorded in the pages of The Daily. Punctuated with
achievements and vitality, with the founding of new tradition and the
discarding of old, the year passes, and with it passes the reign of '38.
New faces will replace the old as 675 seniors leave the campus
on the great trek toward success or possible failure. In a few weeks
the campus will pause and then whirl through the swift, kaleido
scopic days of Senior Week only to revert to the lethargic drowsi
ness of summer quarter as the men and women of '38 scatter on their
various ways.
For four years the faces on this page have been closely asso
ciated with the front line trenches of Stanford activities. They have
watched while the Memorial Hall developed into reality from the
realms of dreamland, while the Cubberley Education Building rose
on the site of an old parking lot, and the Laurence Frost Memorial
Amphitheater burst forth from the fertile mind of A1 Roth.
Familiar, too, on the Stanford news front, these faces have seen
the mud fight banned and the King-Queen contest outlawed. They
have watched while the boat house collapsed narrowly missing
tragedy, while the "Vowing Sophs" kept their vows, and while
Hank Luisetti led his team to new championships.
But they have also watched the University develop, grow in size
and influence as new fields of research were opened and new
courses offered.
And now, as the year ends, these faces will find themselves
marching double file into the new born Amphitheater as they wave a
final farewell to Stanford undergraduate days.
