# Farm To Confer Degrees on 1200
## 
### 
Filing picturesquely down the winding trails of the year-old Lawrence
Frost Amphitheater, approximately 075 seniors and 525 candidates for
advanced degrees will participate in Stanford's forty-seventh annual Com
mencement exercises on Sunday, June 1J). The ceremony will be held at
4 o'clock before an expected audience of 8.000.
Plans for the exercises, as outlined last night by Public Exercises
Committee Chairman Edgar Eugene Robinson, include the main address
by Arthur 11. Young, a former vice-president of the United States Steel

Corporation. Mr. Young will spealc
on "University Men and Women in
an Industrial Society."
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur will give
the closing address to the graduating
class. His subject will be announced
in Senior Review, as will the name
of the man to deliver the invocation.
Symphony May Play
Music for the exercises will be
provided either by the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra or by or
gan music piped into the Amphithe
ater from the Memorial Church, ac
cording to an announcement last
night by Senior Class President Bob
Mc√üoskey.
Because the orchestra would cost
over $1,000, Senior Executive Com
mittee has hesitated to make definite
arrangements until details and re
spective merits have been discussed
more fully.

tickets to the Baccalaureate service

ment exercises. If any tickets are
