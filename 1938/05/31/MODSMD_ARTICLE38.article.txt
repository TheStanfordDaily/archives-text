# Program Sale Nears Close
## Seniors Swarm, Buy 8200 Announcements 
### 
Emily Post may not be quite the
goddess to Stanford seniors that she
is to Eastern finishing school gradu
ates, but nevertheless her word does
stand for what is right and what is
wrong in the world of etiquette.
And so, when Miss Post says that
graduation announcements "are
qiute the thing this season," the men
and women of '38 take heed and
storm the A.S.S.U. office, buying
8,200 announcements at ten cents
apiece and GOO programs at a dollar
per.
Good Gift-Getters
Of course Miss Post is also aware
that the announcements are tradi
tionally good gift-getters, but then
she feels that this is none of her
business.
Meanwhile Stevie and Aten think
it is their business because there are
only about 50 programs and 300
announcements left, and Stevie and
Aten don't want to see anybody
gypped out of a fair share of graft.
Available Tomorrow
With pictures by Horace Bristol,
the leather-bound programs which
contain lists of graduating students
and senior committees, as well as
the Senior Week program, will be
available tomorrow. Some students
have ordered as many as five of
these to send to friends and rela
tives.
Bristol, who is one of the highest
paid photographers on the Coast, is
familiar to most Stanfordites
through his work on "Life." Last
year he took several pictures of the
Farm which later appeared in the
college issue of that magazine. Until
this year the programs have been
illustrated by student camera men.
Announcements Simple
The announcements are simple,
engraved cards which are often sent
as freely as Christmas cards. Ac
cording to Miss Post they should
be accompanied by personal calling
cards.
On the announcement committee
are Isabel Goldthwaite and Allen
Oddie, co-chairmen; Dave Bots
ford, Harry Cragin, Curt Eaton,
Jean Hemphill, John Morrill, Dave
Rider, Elaine Seevers, Midge Roth,
and Sallee Wilson.
The noise of cannon at the Battle
of Waterloo was said to have been
heard at Dover, 180 miles from the
battlefield.
