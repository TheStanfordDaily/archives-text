Text nf the poem, "On Gradua
tion," follows:
We see time's movement in the
blades
Of ripening grain, the impetus
From green to golden, for from us
Swift time has taken two decades.
And since we have small hope of
heaven
And creeds have severed man from
man,
We take such pleasure as we can
In joys that to our youth are given,
And are not done with faith, but
trust
Ourselves without humility
To be what we aspire to be
And halfway conquer over dust.
