# Rice To Edit Class of '38's Senior Review
## Special Four-page Publication Will Be Issued on June 16, 17 
### 
Senior Review, special senior edi
tion, will appear this year under the
editorship of John Rice, Senior Ex
ecutive Committee decided last
night.
Financed by the dregs of Senior
Class funds, the four-page, pledge
issue sized paper will be distribut
ed from the A.S.S.U. office on June
16, and at Class Day ceremonies on
June 17.
Reasons for Choice
Rice has been chosen editor of
the special edition as publicity
chairman of the senior class, and
because of past experience as asso
ciate editor of The Daily.
"It ought to be good stuff," he
said, and asked that any informa
tion to be included in the issue be
turned in to him.
The paper will include all last
minute information on Senior Week
and other senior activities, as well
as the senior program. Particular
reason for the edition is that The
Daily stops publication too soon to
publicize last minute changes in
the senior schedule, Rice said.
Started Last Year
Started for the first time last year
by then Class President Mort D'Eve
lyn, the issue will appear without
advertising. It will be made up and
published at a Palo Alto print shop.
Only seniors will be able to ob
tain the paper. "With a limited ex
pense budget, we won't have enough
to go around otherwise," said Rice.
La Branconne, Belgium's national
song, was originally sung in 1830
during the revolution against the
Dutch.
