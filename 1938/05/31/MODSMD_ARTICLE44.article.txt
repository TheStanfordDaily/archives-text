# Dave Botsford Writes Senior Class History
## 
### 
If another major earthquake rips
down the San Andreas fault in years
to come, razes Stanford from B.A.C.
to Lagunita, future historians will
still be able to piece together some
what of a personal history of the
thoughts and deeds of Stanford men.
For, since 1891, as the climax of
415 class-day exercises, seniors have
sealed in air-proof metal boxes
such mementos of their four Stan
ford years as Dailies, Chappies, a
Quad, a class scroll, will and poem,
and a rather sentimental senior "his
tory."
With appropriate benedictions,
these black boxes have been lowered
into holes under the Inner-Quad
arches, covered "forever" with bur
nished bronze lids bearing the nu
merals of each class.
Two weeks from Friday another
such black box will be lowered into
the Inner-Quad cement. In the box,
among other samples of the Class of
'38's literary hangings, will go the
47th "history" of a Stanford senior
class.
Written by Dave Botsford with the
machine-made Stanfordites of A.D.
2038 in mind, the "immortal" para
graphs will read something like this:
"We, the 676 seniors of 1938, have
been a funny lot. With the World
staring us blankly and unknowingly
in the face, we have spent our last
Stanford days in sun-suits on soro
rity house roofs, in swimming
trunks on Lagunita rafts, in Palm
Beach suits and cotton formals in
top-less roadsters.
"Some of us, though not many,
have our World careers in mind—
nave arranged the niches which wo
will fill when this four-year design
for-living is over.
Our sun-baked brains have been
filled with socio-political theories

whose value you of 2038 know far
better than we. We have watched
Europe from our ivory tower, seen
Hitler change Germany during the
same four years that Stanford has
changed us. Our professors have
told us—and some of us have be
lieved—that we, if anyone, will build
a civilization fit for you of 2038 to
live in. You know whether we
have."
Botsford will read these and other
paragraphs from the Class of '38's
"personal history" at the class-day
exercises in the Memorial Chapel
June 17.
