Commending the good choice of
Stanford students for Men's and
Women's Council members, retiring
Dean of Men George B. Culver yes
terday linked with these two groups
the efficiency and ability which is
present in Farm student government.
' They have about the hardest of
the governing jobs administered by
students," he said, "and they are
doing fine work."
Any change in student govern
ment, Dean Culver said, will most
likely come through the Councils.
At the same time, Dean Culver
revealed his plans for the future.
"I don't intend to write a book,"
said Mr. Culver. "For one thing, I
couldn't write about the doings of
the student body which come
through the Dean of Men's officeâ€”
that's too private.
"What's more. I'll be too busy
taking care of my ranch, cultivating
a vegetable garden, developing flow
ers. and reminiscing.
