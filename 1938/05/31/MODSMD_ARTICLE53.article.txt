# McRoskey Writes to Classmates, Urges Continued Alumni Activity
## 
### 
Bob Mcßoskey, senior class presi
dent during the past year, strikes an
optimistic note with a communica
tion to his classmates summing up
the year. In addition to expressing
his gratitude for the help given him
by seniors during his term, Mcßos
key implores his classmates to con
tinue to hold a feeling of responsi
bility for Stanford as alumni.
His letter follows:
"During the past year in which I
have served as your president I have
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity
to make new acquaintances and to
strengthen my old friendships. I
wish to thank all those, in my behalf
and in behalf of the class, who have
contributed their time and ability
toward making our senior year and
senior activities a success. I sin
cerely feel that whatever success we
have achieved has been due entirely
to the committee chairmen, who
have taken complete responsibility
for their respective activities; and
have so carried them through that I
have spent but a minimum of effort.
Likewise, I am grateful to aLI the
committee people who have worked
with them.
Accomplished Much
"I feel that the Class of 1938 has
accomplished much for Stanford, and
has returned in a small way what
Stanford has done for it. As alumni
I expect the return to be even
greater.
"Graduation this June will bring
to a close another chapter in the
history of Stanford. The University
v/ill release a new batch of prod
ucts which are the result of four
years of careful processing. These
products will bear the label of
"Stanford"; thus the University is
in a measure pinning its future
reputation on us; for as its alumni
prosper as good citizens, so does the
University. In this sense we all
bear a responsibility.
College End
"The senior approaches gradua
tion with mixed emotions. Gradua
tion means the termination of four
happy, colorful years which will be
difficult to equal in the future.
"And so graduation seems an un
welcome event. Yet again it brings
the opening of a new chapter, a
chapter for which we all have high
hopes. The life for which Stanford

has given us four years of prepa
ration is almost here. It brings with
it a feeling of excitement and sus
pense, and so we welcome it.
"To all the seniors, I wish you the
best of good fortune and bid you
well. I hope you will meet the

Bob Mcßoskey, senior class presi
dent during the past year, strikes an
optimistic note with a communica
tion to his classmates summing up
the year. In addition to expressing
his gratitude for the help given him
by seniors during his term, Mcßos
key implores his classmates to con

His letter follows:
"During the past year in which I
have served as your president I have
thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity
to make new acquaintances and to
strengthen my old friendships. I
wish to thank all those, in my behalf
and in behalf of the class, who have
contributed their time and ability
toward making our senior year and
senior activities a success. I sin
cerely feel that whatever success we
have achieved has been due entirely
to the committee chairmen, who
have taken complete responsibility
for their respective activities; and
have so carried them through that I
have spent but a minimum of effort.
Likewise, I am grateful to aLI the
committee people who have worked
with them.
Accomplished Much
"I feel that the Class of 1938 has
accomplished much for Stanford, and
has returned in a small way what
Stanford has done for it. As alumni
I expect the return to be even
greater.
"Graduation this June will bring
to a close another chapter in the
history of Stanford. The University
v/ill release a new batch of prod
ucts which are the result of four
years of careful processing. These
products will bear the label of
"Stanford"; thus the University is
in a measure pinning its future
reputation on us; for as its alumni
prosper as good citizens, so does the
University. In this sense we all
bear a responsibility.
