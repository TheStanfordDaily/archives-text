# Spring Grid Closes With Saturday Game
## Tiny Will Warm Bench As Whites, Reds Meet in Final Clash of Season 
### 
Finale to Stanford's best spring grid season since the Rose Bowl days
will he written Saturday in the stadium turf when Jim Lawson's lied
team meets Bohhy Gray.'oil's White squad in a full-length struggle with
ail the trimmings. The kick-off is scheduled for 2 o'clock.
Head Coach 'liny Thornhill will he playing the role of the disinter
ested hystander although he undoubtedly wiil be pretty close to the
scene of action. Lawson has gath-^

ered together a majority of the
first and fourth-string men, while
Grayson is teaching all the tricks of
the trade to potential second and
third team men.
Some on Bench
While some of the Monday morn
ing quarterbacks have expressed
their dislike of having the first
string line and backfield on the same
bench instead of separating them,
those who have watched the Big
Red Machine purr through work
outs are convinced that 1938 will be
one year in which the role of "first
string man" won't be assigned to any
one man in a single position.
Even men like the sensational
Norm Standlee, who opened the
eyes of both the coaches and the
alumni with his brilliant running
and defensive play, can't bo sure of
his position so long as candidates
like Gene Coldiron and Freddie
Ledeboer are pressing him. Hamp
Pool, the 229-pound speedster at
:ight half, would seem like a nat
ural first-stringer, but Jinuny Groves
and he were putting on a whale ol
a show for the starling spot before
Groves went to the Rest Home.
Ends Plentiful
At left end, Bill McElroy and Andy
Ttojkovich are hard to choose be
tween, while on the other side old
Jack Clark, Bill Willard, Howard
Hickingbotham, and Stan Graff will
be a cinch to keep the spectators
awake.
In the tackle spots, Pete Zagar
and Stan Andersen would seem to
be the logical picks, but Corky
Donahue and By West, Ed Johanssen
.ind Claude Purkitt won't be sitting
i>n any bench very long.
Guards Question Mark
What has looked to be the one
c uestion mark of the whole spring
. i ;ason has been the guard prob-
I 'in. The choicest pairs here are
J Job Dakan and Dick Sutton, Paul
Ugrin and Steve Keusseff, and
(.'hick Orme with either Roy Ad
: mson, Carl Warnecke, or John
Herman, all frosh, as running mates.
Tony Calvelli has satisfied every
< ne at center but Jackie Thompson
has proved himself too tough and
reliable to warm a pine board all
season.
Open Against Santa Clara
But Stanford's new-found depth
'n every position except guard will
come in handy enough next fall as
the Indians set forth on one of
i ieir toughest schedules of recent
. ears. They open against the Sugar
i)owl champions, Santa Clara, on
October 1 and don't rest a single
Saturday until after the Dartmouth
;,ame on November 2G.
Six of the nine games, however,
will be played in the Stanford sta
dium.

Finale to Stanford's best spring grid season since the Rose Bowl days
will he written Saturday in the stadium turf when Jim Lawson's lied
team meets Bohhy Gray.'oil's White squad in a full-length struggle with
ail the trimmings. The kick-off is scheduled for 2 o'clock.
Head Coach 'liny Thornhill will he playing the role of the disinter
ested hystander although he undoubtedly wiil be pretty close to the
scene of action. Lawson has gath-^

ered together a majority of the
first and fourth-string men, while
Grayson is teaching all the tricks of
the trade to potential second and
third team men.
Some on Bench
While some of the Monday morn
ing quarterbacks have expressed
their dislike of having the first
string line and backfield on the same
bench instead of separating them,
those who have watched the Big
Red Machine purr through work
outs are convinced that 1938 will be
one year in which the role of "first
string man" won't be assigned to any
one man in a single position.
Even men like the sensational
Norm Standlee, who opened the
eyes of both the coaches and the
alumni with his brilliant running
and defensive play, can't bo sure of
his position so long as candidates
like Gene Coldiron and Freddie
Ledeboer are pressing him. Hamp
Pool, the 229-pound speedster at
:ight half, would seem like a nat
ural first-stringer, but Jinuny Groves
and he were putting on a whale ol
a show for the starling spot before
Groves went to the Rest Home.
Ends Plentiful
At left end, Bill McElroy and Andy
Ttojkovich are hard to choose be
tween, while on the other side old
Jack Clark, Bill Willard, Howard
Hickingbotham, and Stan Graff will
be a cinch to keep the spectators
awake.
In the tackle spots, Pete Zagar
and Stan Andersen would seem to
be the logical picks, but Corky
Donahue and By West, Ed Johanssen
.ind Claude Purkitt won't be sitting
i>n any bench very long.
Guards Question Mark
What has looked to be the one
c uestion mark of the whole spring
. i ;ason has been the guard prob-
I 'in. The choicest pairs here are
J Job Dakan and Dick Sutton, Paul
Ugrin and Steve Keusseff, and
(.'hick Orme with either Roy Ad
: mson, Carl Warnecke, or John
Herman, all frosh, as running mates.
Tony Calvelli has satisfied every
< ne at center but Jackie Thompson
has proved himself too tough and
reliable to warm a pine board all
season.
Open Against Santa Clara
But Stanford's new-found depth
'n every position except guard will
come in handy enough next fall as
the Indians set forth on one of
i ieir toughest schedules of recent
. ears. They open against the Sugar
i)owl champions, Santa Clara, on
October 1 and don't rest a single
Saturday until after the Dartmouth
;,ame on November 2G.
Six of the nine games, however,
will be played in the Stanford sta
dium.
