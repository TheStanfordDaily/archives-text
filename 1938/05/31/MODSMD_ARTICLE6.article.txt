# Scroll Missing 350 Senior Names
## 
### 
To have one's name written on
parchment and buried beneath the
corner-stone of a great building is a
privilege granted to few. However,
Stanford seniors are given a better
shot at immortality by signing the
Senior Scroll in the A.S.S.U. office.
To date, only 350 of the classes
600-odd members have signed the
scroll which will be placed, beneath
the bronze slab in front of the Me
morial Church on Class Day, June
17, along with the Senior will, his
tory. poem, a copy of the Quad, and
other documents.
On the scroll are special places for
the signatures of class officers and
Executive Committee members. No
charge is made for signing the scroll,
which was decorated by two seniors.
