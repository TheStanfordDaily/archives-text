## WALT PETERSON, Sports Editor Hopes Brighten As '39 Hoop Squad Lines Up Captain Phil Zonne To Lead Successors Of Laughing Boys 
### HARRY PRESS 
All the Laughing Boys except one
j are gone, but Stanford still will have
the strongest hoop quintet in the
Southern Division next season.
Led by Captain Phil Zonne, the
only returning basketballer of the
1 gang that topped every team in the
j nation for three successive years,
i the 1939 edition of Stanford Chair-
I pions, Inc., will present a small and
fast outfit.
Team To Be Short
Height may bother the Indians,
but there never was a day when
! speed couidn't hold its own with a
I skyscraper team. This year's squad
i averaged about G ft. in., where
as next season's quintet will mean
! der between a puny G ft, and 6 ft.
j 1 in.
! Center spot will be capably han-
I died by Don Burness. One of the
| better floor-men to pound the Pa-
I vilion hardwood in recent years,
j Burness can handle the bail as if
jit were a baseball—and that also
applies when he's shooting.
Zonne Leads Forwards
Moving to the forwards, Captain
| Phil Zonne grabs the limelight as
the snake-hips of the team. His
amazing ability to take a shot from
back-breaking positions has made
many an otherwise missed-fire Card
fast break come to a 2-point con
clusion.
As running-mate, Zonne will un
doubtedly have Darrel Huddleson,
spotrdball of the team. As sub for
Luisetti this year, Hud saw quite a
bit of action, all of which proved
him to be a much-needed quantity
j when the going gets tough.
Lyon, Davidson
Back-court will be filled, prob-
J ably, by Dick Lyon and Ken Dav
j idson. In the charity game of May
12, Davidson's defense was just
about impenetrable, while Lyon
J played a whirlwind game getting the
s ball down the court.
And that is just about the team.
I They'll be aided materially by Don
'Williams, Leon Lafaille, Gil Rahn,
j Will Anderson, and Bob Burnett, to
mention just a few.
