# Card Squads Take Graduation Beating
## 
### 
Old Man Commencement is going to slash deeply into some of Stan
ford': sports thsi year, notably golf, track, and basketball. Mrs. Alva Goesle,
K.A.C. eligibility sentry, has revealed.
Football, too, won't take any too light a blow, nor does baseball get oIT
easily, the records show. Boxing, tennis, swimming, and water polo will

have the best representation of vet
erans next school year.
Dink Templeton is going to have to
fret along next spring without this
year's captain, Ray Malott; George
Shaw, Jack Beman, Vic Boore, Ed
Burrows, Sumner Gill. Jack Lipman,
Jerry McCall, Rusty March, Tom
Montgomery, Hugh Gribbin, Grant
Stone, Jim Kneubuhl, Leo Madlem,
Ed Bernhauer, Paul Ganahl, and
possibly Jack Walton. Walton, the
grand old man of Stanford athletic
competition, will have another year
if he can stave off the graduation and
academic years bugaboos.
lloop Losses Greatest
Basketball loses the greatest ever,
of course, in Captain Angelo Lui
setli, along with Art Stoefen, H. B.
Lee, Jack Calderwood, Bob Zonne,
and Charles "Nellie" Heath. Of the
first team from the past season only
one man, newly chosen Captain Phil
Zonne, returns.
There will be gone from football
one full team, 11 men, and still Stan
ford can claim the potential cham
pionship team for next year. Captair
Grant Stone, Bob Matthews, Lec
Ferko, Louis Tsoutsouvas, Jim Cof
lis, Jake Brigham, Joe Vigna, Neil
Rasmussen, Ed Gamier, Irv Cum
rnings, and Doc Luckett won't be
with Tiny and the boys next fail.
Some May Be Back
Glenn Hamilton and Jack Walton
can play if they want to, and prob
ably will, it is agreed. Even Thorn
hill says he doesn't know where the
two veterans find their years of com
petition, but Mrs. Goesle will go tc
bat for them if their records are
questioned. Bob Dakan, whose right
to further competition has beer
doubted in some quarters, has two
years to play if he can work it out,
Baseball is still another sport that
loses its captain, in George Farrell
Menlo Park product. Spike Furman.
Glenn Hamilton, Dick Hanna, Tom
Kiliefer, Dick LaFranehi, Bob Mat
jhews, Dale Reimer, Dick Tam, and
Konetchy "Joie" Griffin can no
longer compete in college.
Golfers Lose Seven
Golf takes it on the chin with the
loss of Bill Boyd, Brown Cannon,
Art Doering, Jack Wallace, and
probably Al Hyman, Warren Mc-
Canless, and Jimmy Rea.
Hyman, McCanless, and Rea have
the right to more competition, but
they will have a tough time keeping
from getting too many units.
Tennis, Swimming Lose Captains
Tennis loses just three — Captain
Bob Underwood. Bob Braly, and Bob
Colwell. Swimming loses only four,
including Captain Dave Rider, Ma
son Letteau, Bill Tench, and Jack
Vibert.
Vibert also has completed his com
petitive allowance for water polo,
along with Bill Hanna, Cam Hall,
and George Parker. Boxing goes
into its second year under Clayton
Frye with the loss of only one man
from the rolls of the regulars, Cap
tain Mac Pope.

Some May Be Back
Glenn Hamilton and Jack Walton
can play if they want to, and prob
ably will, it is agreed. Even Thorn
hill says he doesn't know where the
two veterans find their years of com

the right to more competition, but
they will have a tough time keeping
from getting too many units.
Tennis, Swimming Lose Captains
Tennis loses just three — Captain
Bob Underwood. Bob Braly, and Bob
Colwell. Swimming loses only four,
including Captain Dave Rider, Ma
son Letteau, Bill Tench, and Jack

K.A.C. eligibility sentry, has revealed.
Football, too, won't take any too light a blow, nor does baseball get oIT
easily, the records show. Boxing, tennis, swimming, and water polo will

have the best representation of vet
erans next school year.

fret along next spring without this
