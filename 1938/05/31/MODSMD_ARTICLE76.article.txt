# SIDELINE SLANTS...

IV ALT PETERSON dealt his 113 th
hand of Sideline Slants yester
day, and this time he black
jack. So today a new regime takes
over the deck with a spotless rec
ord to keep clean. Walt has pre
sented the facts accurately and im
partially for two volumes as sports
editor, and with a minimum of com
plaints.
And when a new staff takes the
helm next quarter we shall do our
best to make Volume D 4 sports the
finest in history. There will be a
few changes, of course, not because
they will make the sports page bet
ter but because the new staff thinks
they will.
Impartiality and accuracy will
continue as the by-word of every
member of the sports staff. Our
greatest ambition is to make Page 3
interesting and readable to all read
ers, including those whose names are
not in print.
And it. is my ambition to do my
own job well enough that no 220-
pound football player will clinch his
fists and say, "If I had that sports
editor here, I'd ...."

AS the Daily goes into hibernation
for another summer, there are
two things that are making sports
fans wonder—who will be basket
ball coach next year and how big
Stanford's 1938 Red Machine will be.
The coaching problem is still in
the air .and Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
physical education director, will
make his recommendation to the
B.A.C. on June 8. If the Board ap
proves, the appointment must then
be approved by the University
Piesident, the Faculty Administra
tion Committee, and the Board of
Trustees before the position can
even be offered.
But on a long list of candidates,
two names are still outstanding.
Hill Ilubhard, head basketball
coach at San Jose State College,
and Everett Dean, who holds the
same post at the University of In
diana, have both been invited to
Stanford for interviews.
Hubbard holds two degrees,
which he earned at Stanford. His
claim to the position lies mainly in
his experience with John Bunn's
system and in the natural edge he
holds as a Stanford alumnus.
He began coaching as an assist
ant to Dud DeGroot at Menlo Jun
ior College, and when Dud became
physical education director at San
Jose, he took Hubbard along to coach
basketball and to help out in foot
ball and baseball.
During his summers he attended
Coach Bunn's coaching school and
prepared his Masters' thesis under
Bunn's direction. His record at San
Jose was very good during this time
and was climaxed last season by the
championship in the Northern Cali
fornia league.
Dean is now on his way to Stan
ford to be interviewed before
next week's meeting. Fourteen
years' experience a head coach at
Indiana is in his favor, llis team
plays in the toughest league in
the country, and has won the title
several times. His record in re
cent years, however, has not been
at its peak.
His system has not been the
same as that which has given the
Laughing Boys their fine reputation.
Although he uses a fast-breaking
offense, he keeps three men out and
two in. which is the reverse of the
Stanford system, and he uses nian
to-mun defense instead of team de
fense.

I So it will be a hurd decision.
! Which would be better—a young
1 Stanford graduate with a good rec
! ord in a minor league or an experi
! enced outsider with a good record
j in a major league?

JT LOOKS as though Stanford
will again approach a Golden Age
j in football next year, and the team
J has hard work mapped out for it
j with the hardest coast schedule pos
sible and a game against Dartmouth,
; which claims to be unbeatable.
From appearances during spring
i training, it looks as though next
I year's Big Red Machine would have
had little trouble with Cal's so
| called Wonder Team of last season.
But we'll never know, because Cal
, will be taking a back seat next fall.
| Ben Winkelman says he could
never see that Cal was as good as
Brick Morse saw it." The question
j this year, however, is whether or
: not the Cards will be able to take
I a much-improved Southern Califor
nia or Washington aggregation.
Fans seem to be losing sleep over
[Stanford's weak line, but they will
[probably be mistaken. It is simply
a problem now of putting the best
i eleven men on the field at the same
time rather than hold the bench
down with two good "tackles who
| could play guard without too much
i orientation.
| The boys look good out there now,
( and they'll look better next fall. And
i if they have improved as much or
I more than Southern California or
| Washington, fans can look forward
j to a nerve-wracking 1938 grid sea
| son.
