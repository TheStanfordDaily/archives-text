"Campus Activities," a 345-page '

Stanford leadership seminar held
fall quarter. 1936, will be published

day.
Edited by Harold C. Hand, asso- j
ciate professor of education, who
conducted the seminar, the book was ;
written for the most part by the 12 j
student leaders who had petitioned â– 
for the course.
A critical description of nineteen 1
aspects of campus life, such as dra
matics, athletics, and social life, the j
book is based on the results of 19 !
questionnaires sent out to over 250 !
colleges throughout the United
States.

were Jim Reynolds, Esther Pelton,
Roy Anderson, Barbara Kimball, j
Irvin Jorgensen, Annalee Whitmore,
Ruth Barnes, Lee Stearns, Tom Kil- I
lefer, Jackie Brown, Chick Franich,
and Bob Mallett.
Because compiling the results of
the survey was such a large task, I
the students obtained the assistance ;
of Bob Gros, Raymond Kendall,
Emilia Rathbun, Harlow Rothert, i
and Roy Thompson in writing eer- j
tain chapters.
Foreword to the book wa;, wrtiten j
by Elbert K. Fretwell, professor of

Since $400 was appropriated by I
the A.S.S.U. to cover publishing of |
the volume, royalties will go into the j
student body treasury.
