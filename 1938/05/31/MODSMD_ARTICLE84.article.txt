# Hail and Farewell Stuff

Dear jim:
A week ago the staff elected you to the
top spot of a strange organization called a col
lege newspaper. I don't know exactly what you
thought of The Daily before that day, or what
conclusion the week of rather intensive think
ing has brought.
But at some time during your term you're
going to think The Daily is nothing but a glori
fied bulletin board, to advertise campus dances
and meetings. Another time you will think it's
a great institution, the only one able to instigate
reforms in the student interest.
You'll probably be right both times, though
you may have trouble finding the necessary
reforms, or even the student interest. There
always will be meetings to leave out of the
Bull Board.
Perhaps I'm a little soured on the crusading
side of the business, because I don't like to
criticize or crusade. Perhaps it's because the
campus commented least on the things that
were most serious to me. You may have better
luck.
But whether you do or not, my advice is to
make The Daily as good a bulletin board as
you can. We may not like to admit it, but the
paper is a house organ for the Associated Stu
dents, and to a certain extent for the Adminis
tration. If the editorial columns are used only
and deliberately for seasoning, the campus will
be satisfied.
While I'm on the subject I want to thank you
and John Cobbs for supplying a very fair
brand of seasoning. And I want to thank Art
Stokes particularly, and Corena Crase, Peter
son, Sheldon, Drury, Press, Shallenberger,
White, Millis, and all the rest for an effective
job of bull boarding.
You know all of them, Jim, and you'll work
with most of them next year. You're lucky, as
I was, in having such a fine crew.
Sincerely,
Lap
