# Too Much on the Ball
## 
### 
IT jolted us a little to hear that the Senior Ball
will cost 58.50 this year. Even in these days
of war debts, WPA projects, and syllabus fees,
that strikes us as something of a high price to
pay for an evening.
Of course, the figure arouses in us no more
than detached interest, for we are not seniors.
And so we will not be forced into safecracking;
nor will we have to spend a quiet evening at
home reading Karl Marx.
Even so, 58.50 is not a sum that can be
scrawled with a careless laugh on a stub ac
count and forgotten. Translated into purchasing
power it is a bit frightening. It is the equivalent
of 10 movie dates, excluding subsidiary invest
ments. It would keep a Convalescent Home
babe out of the street for something like 3.4
days.
It is true that the $8.50 buys a lot of amuse
ment. It brings a good orchestra, a royal sup
per, and all the pomp and circumstance that is
usually found only in a Hollywood version of
a college dance. It is also true that Balls in
past years have cost even more.
But that doesn't provide much comfort for
the seniors who find that banks are not at all
interested in cashing checks when there are no
deposits.
As the sponsors of the ball point out, the
seniors pay only once in four years. The ball
will give them something to remember in the
long lean years they will face while they try
to carve their initials in the profit system.
When the senior graduates and goes out into
the world, he will settle down to an $18.50 a
week job. And then when he goes to bed
after the rooming-house dinner he can lie on
the exhausted springs and dream of the glory
that was the Senior Ball. Surely, say the spon
sors, a mere 58.50 is little enough to pay for a
memory that will be a strength and comfort in
the dark days'that are to come.
There is only one flaw in this reascning. The
men who can afford to go to the ball will be
nicely subsidized by parents and will step into
a job which will pay for a long series of $8.50
balls. To them the dream will be nothing.
And the men who will slave at an $18.50 job
don't have enough money to go to the ball
now. When they crawl into their rooming
house beds along with the thousand other bits
of animal life, they will have no dream.
If this be Marxism, make ihe most of it. I. C.
