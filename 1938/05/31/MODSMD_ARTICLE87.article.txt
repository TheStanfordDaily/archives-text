# BIRTHDAY AT DOORN
## 
### 
lIIS seventy-ninth year came to an old man in Hol
land the other day, and for the twentieth time in
as many years it was not greeted with parades and cele
brations. No guns served notice to the world that he
was a year older; very few headlines proclaimed it; and
in his own country, if anyone remembered about it,
he thought hard and long before saying so.
The old man's birthday, however, did not go quite
unrcmcmhcrcd. Various members of his house ar
rived in Doom to be with him, chief among them be
ing his grandson, Louis Ferdinand, with his fiancee,
Grand Duchess Kyra, herself a holder of a non-exist
ent title in a royal hierarchy which tumbled into the
dust 20 years ago.
Telegrams came, few in comparison with the bar
vests of happier days, but enough for an old man to
point to with pride. One came from the First Royal
Dragoons in London, whose honorary colonel the old
man had been before the War; one came from relatives
who have ignored him since 1914. It was signed
"Bertie, May, and Elizabeth," and the old man was
greatly pleased with this faintly opera-bouffc recog
nition.
But telegrams from the Windsors, and congratula
tions from Royal Dragoons trying in their desperately
British way to be frightfully sporty probably could
not make up to the old man for the glories which are
gone. If he ever pauses for a moment to look back
over the road lie has come, the thought that his pomp
is reduced to a family party and his sway over his
people to a few hushed whispers in a Nazi-ridden land
must be bitter indeed.
Not that he will ever show that he feels bitter, of
course. Still straight and handsome, his beard and
mustache turned white but still as Prussian as ever,
his withered left arm no longer sheltered in a trench
coat but jabbed firmly into the coat pocket of an
ordinary suit, his whole attitude seems to express com
peltely the words of an old enemy: "lis ne passeront
pas"—They shall not pass.
And the old man seems to be saying that to the
world, to all who laugh at. him now, who ignore the
shell of a power which once threw real and utter
terror into more than half the civilized world.

For he has been a great legend in his time, this old
man in Holland. Probably no man in all history has
been so haled as he; probably no man has had heaped
upon him the vilification and abuse it has been his lot
to receive. That must be one of the things which
amuses him now—if he has had time to develop a sense
of humor during the years he has been in exile—the
fact that he lives almost forgotten today, tolerated,
harmless, unfeared.
And he must be lonely, the old man, as he realizes
that all the great, names and figures who fought with or
against him in the savage attempt to remake the sur
face of the globe are gone. Franz Joseph of Austria
. . . Von Hindenburg, last representative of the old
Germany . . . Ramsay Mac Donald . . . Ludendorff
. . . George of England and Albert of the Belgians
... all the angry brotherhood of power which took
its stand across the opening years of the twentieth
century. All but Lloyd George, the man who wanted
to hang him . . . and the old man himself.
And looking at what has followed the cataclysm in
which he played so great a part, he must wonder some
times just what lay behind it, just, what were the rea
sons which prompted and justified it. In a world again
on the march, there must sometimes come echoing on
the wind the sound of other marching feet, long stilled,
and other guns, long dead . . . and the old man must
wonder . . . wonder . . .
But he will probably never tell us what conclusions
he comes to, what answer he finds. For he cannot ad
mit that he was wrong, or his whole life collapses in
an empty bubble. He can only remember—remember,
remember, and never forget—that he is Wilhelm. An
emperor.
Toward harrying doubt and the disregard of the
world, the old man must turn always his uncompro
mising, unyielding stare. And to them he must always
say the desperate words which were spoken so long
ago.
They shall not pass. —Allen Drury
