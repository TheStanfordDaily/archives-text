# GOIN' MY WAY

speaking, it has been a great
year. The campus has been humming with activ
ity, and San Francisco has given ample outlet for
Farm boomers. Conventionally, it is time to look back
on the year, pick out high spots. Many of them flash
by, and it would be unwise and impossible to pick
out a single show, dance, person as the top. But we
remember . . .
Marco Thorne and Ed Kerr, dead-panning their way
through a screamingly funny Gaieties pantomime,
lampooning some of Stanford's tried and true insti
tutions . . .
J. P. Cahn, standing in the little balcony at the
left of the Memorial Hall stage, delivering the "Christ
mas sermon" in "Murder in the Cathedral," lifting
us out of our scats as we wondered if he could ever
finish it . . .
Pete Fay singing at the Labor Day show, complete
ly unaware of certain omissions in his sartorial ap
pearance . . .
Bud Cady, forgetting Bud Cady to make Johnny
Johnson one of the top performances of the season
. . . Kay Campbell and Melba Rae Toombs hitting
the high spots of their year on the stage in "Kind
Lady."
* * * *
Shirley Jones, singing her way through "Gaieties"
and "Is Europe?" with top honors . . .
Marian Anderson, sending shivers down the backs
of a Concert. Series audience, using a voice that
should belong in the Heavenly Choir . . .
House dances in costume that were more like
Bachanallian revels than staid Stanford frolics . . .
The Sophomore Carnival, which always brings back
the old days when Circus Day was the big event of
the year . . .
The float parade down the How for the Big Game
Rally, and the ensuing Bonfire with the band swing
ing "Tiger Rag" . . ,
* â€¢ * *
And in the City . . . Helen Hayes, waddling and
popping her way through "Victoria Regina" . . .
The opera season, with Kirsten Flagstad's last ap
pearance on the coast opera stace . . .
And on and on. It was a good year.
