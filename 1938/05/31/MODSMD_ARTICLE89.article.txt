# Job Openings Decline, Says Bureau Head

### 
Placement opportunities for grad
uates arc not so good this year as i
they were last year, although they j
are not so bad as during the do- j
pression, according to Miss Ruth
Tracksell of the appointment office, j
Although it will take more effort j
on the part of the student to get a j
job, seniors who know what they j
want and have the necessary prepa- j
ration will find the opportunity to r
fit them, she said.
Teaching Outlook Good
The outlook for teachers this year
is good, because of the state tenure !
and retirement laws. In calls for j
engineers there has been less of a ;
let-down than in calls by business in
general, and finance in particular.
The latter condition is caused pri- \
marily by the market conditions. In
business, however, the calls for j
salesmen have held up best.
Especially low are calls from busi
nesses where activities have been I
afTectcd by trade union strikes.
Salary Range to $150
The salary range this year is $75
to $150, with general officc workers
on the low level and engineers and
those with special technical train
ing on the high level.
According to Miss Tracksell, em
ployers seek, first of all, students
who "know their own minds," who
have maturity and know what they !
arc interested in and what their
capacities are. Other qualities fa- !
vored by employers are leadership,
enthusiasm, and the ability to get j
along with fellow workers.
