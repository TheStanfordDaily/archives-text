All students who have not
turned in their NYA hours are
urged to turn them in at once,
according to Mrs. Irene Coverly,
head of Student Employment
Bureau.
"Contrary to the general im
pression, the payroll period closed
on June 19, Mrs. Coverly de
clared, "and both graduates and
undergraduates will not receive
any pay unless their time sheets
are in by today."
