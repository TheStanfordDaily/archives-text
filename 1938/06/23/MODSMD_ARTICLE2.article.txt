A word of greeting to the Summer
Quarter students: The Summer
Quarter at Stanford is different from
the other three quarters of the year.
It offers more opportunity for inti- i
mate and friendly association with j
the faculty and with the other stu- j
dents. The days ai£ longer, and the j
weather is almost sure to be good, !
so that there is time for outdoor j
activities, including social activities. J
In many ways, we could call it our j
outdoor quarter.
During the Summer Quarter there
is no interference from intercollegi- j
ate athletics and from many of the j
other pleasant but time-consuming 1
distractions of the rest of the aca- '
demic year. I am glad, then, to give
you greeting on behalf of the faculty
in the hope that you will find your j
work interesting, and that you will ;
be able to spend all of the rest of I
your time in getting acquainted with ;
your fellow students, the members
of the faculty, and this part of Cali
fornia.
The smaller size of the Summer
Quarter reminds some of us of the
very early days of the University.
The campus always is of good size;
but during the Summer Quarter its
range seems to be greater, and the
winds of freedom seem to blow with
a gentler caress.
