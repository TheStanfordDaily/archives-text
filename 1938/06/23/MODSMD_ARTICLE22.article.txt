# Ogburn To Tell Social Changes
## Chicago Sociologist To Talk Here July 6 
### 
j Social and economic changes to be
wrought by today's and tomorrow's
! inventions will be described by Dr.
; William Ogburn, distinguished Chi-
I cago University sociologist, at Stan
j ford's forthcoming conference on
| "Social Education," July 6-10.
j Dr. Ogburn prepared the report
! on technological trends which was
j submitted to President Roosevelt by
! the National Resources Committee
I under the chairmanship of the Hon.
; Harold L. Ickes. In his report Dr.
Ogburn asserted that governmental
j agencies should "anticipate" social
j changes caused by invention and
1 seek to ease the tension caused by
; change.
The 1500 educators expected to
attend will be challenged by Dr.
f William Kilpatrick, "dean of Ameri
can educators," to utilize these data
: and prepare youth for the present
and future rather than the past.
Schools, by anticipating techno
-1 logical changes, might introduce an
element of stability and intelligent
! social control into a society now
badly disorganized by haphazard
changes, Dr. Kilpatrick believes.
Other speakei"s at the conference
include:
Lewis Mumford, social critic and
author; President Ray Lyman Wil
bur of Stanford; and Homer P. Rai
ney, director of the American Youth
! Commission.
