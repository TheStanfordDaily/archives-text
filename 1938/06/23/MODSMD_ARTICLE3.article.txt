# Young Speaks At Graduation
## Stresses Graduates' Position in Industry 
### 
Because business today is fraught
| with such complex social responsi
| bilities, it has never stood in so
! much need of men and women with
I university backgrounds and train
ing, said Arthur Howalnd Young,
former vice-president of the United
; States Steel Corporation, in the main
address, "University Men and Wtrni
; en in an Industrial Society," deliv
i ered at the 47th annual commence
| ment address last Sunday.
Young stated that industry which
! demanded and got marvels in the
| physical sciences is now conscious
i of the need and actually demand
| ing like marvels in the social sci
! ences.
"The American schools and uni
versities have done a marvelous job
jin producing in the graduates of
today the potentially capable mas
ters of human events of the future,"
he said.
As the correcti%'e for social ills,
1 Young suggested a steady emphasis
I and build-up of the positive needs of
society rather than the application
i of new and startling shake-ups in
j social usage.
Young urged the graduates to
regard situations as challengers
rather than problems, to deal with
j people so as to bring more content
j ment into their lives, and to livt
! their religion of the Golden Rule.
