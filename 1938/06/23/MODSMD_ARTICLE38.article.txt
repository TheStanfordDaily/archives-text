# Stanford Press To Issue Many New Books
## Professors' Works Among Those Ready For Early Release 
### 
"The Daily Newspaper and Higher
Education," a book by Dr. Rex G.
Harlow, Professor of Education at
Stanford, is one of the outstanding
books to be released by the Stan
ford University Press in the near
future. Dr. Harlow's book presents
the findings and conclusions which
came out of his investigation of the
shortage of "quality news"—news
of university studies and research
achievements—in American news
papers.
Dr. Harlow's study, which was
sponsored by George W. Kleiser, of
Foster and Kleiser, a San Francisco
advertising firm, indicates that uni
versity men are reluctant to give
information to newspaper reporters
because news stories often misrepre
sent the work of the faculty. On
the other hand, Dr. Harlow points
out, reporters charge that the stories
given out by university men are dull
and unnewsworthy.
Study lo Continue
In "The Daily Newspaper and j
Higher Education," Dr. Harlow sug- j
gests two important measures which
would encourage the publishing of
"quality news" stories. First, he be
lieves that better releases should be I
selected by the universities, and!
that, if possible, the selections should i
be made by men with an under- i
standing of news value. Secondly, i
Dr. Harlow suggests that college!
trained men should be employed
by newspapers to report university j
news. j
Dr. Harlow's investigation, which j
covered many west coast newspapers i
and colleges, will probably be con- j
tinued for two more years.

eral important factors which must
be considered when planning a .sys

children. Among these he lists con
figuration of roads, principal features
of the school, and population den
sity as being the most important. I
