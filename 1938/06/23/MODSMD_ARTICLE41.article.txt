Minneapolis Saturday, as he sped
to a record :46.8 in the 440 event,

the meet standings.
With only four men placing, Stan
ford defeated every school entered
except University of Southern Cali
fornia, N.C.-2A. champions, which
placed 14 men.
Malott's victory was around two
turns. Around one turn, the time
might have approached Ben East
man's world record of :46.3, western
experts agreed after the meet. Later
in the afternoon, he came back to
grab a second place in the 220 be
hind Oregon's Mack Robinson, who
won in the fast time of :21.3.
Pete Zagar successfully defended
his discus title when he tossed it out
to the 162-foot marker.
Only other Stanford point winner
was Stan Andersen, sophomore
weight man, who put the shot 50 feet
5% for a fifth place. It was one of
his best efforts for the season.
