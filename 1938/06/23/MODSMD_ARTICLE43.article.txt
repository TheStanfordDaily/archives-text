who are interested in diamondball
are requested by H. C. Hand, "self
appointed Diamondball Czar," to be
present at Room 50 Saturday morn
ing at 9:30 o'clock for organization
purposes.
A sufficient number of teams will
be organized during the meeting to
give every man who wishes to do so
a chance to play. If there are any
groups of men who wish to play
together on a team, they may do so
if they are represented at the meet
ing.
All Errors, Fun
"Men new to the campus should
not be backward in signing up be
cause of any lurking suspicion that
they might look bad," Hand stated
in his announcement. "We pride
ourselves that diamondball has never
been played with more errors, or
with more fun, than at Stanford."
.'"lhe first round of games will get
under way at 5:00 o'clock June 28.
Thereafter, the games will be played
from 5 to 6 o'clock on Tuesdays and
Thursdays.
Assessment Due
According to Hand, an assessment
of 50 cents will prove sufficient to
care for all necessary expenses, bats
and balls.
The purpose of the games is for
the men attending the University to
become acquainted. "Besides," stated
Hand, "there is nothing like steal
ing second with the bases loaded to
wake a man up after several hours
of uncomfortable near-slumber on
the Inquisition-like benches which
our Alma Mater provides for those
who would sit at the feet of her
professors."

During 1936. more than 100,000
piano accordions were sold in the
United States.
