# Athletic Stars Get Diplomas
## Next Year's Chances Hit by Graduation 
### 
Graduation took a heavy toll from
the ranks of Stanford athletes last
Sunday, and especially hard hit was
three-time Pacific Coast Conference
basketball team when Ray Lyman
Wilbur handed out sheepskins to
Captain Angelo "Hank" Luisetti,
John Smith ''Jack" Calderwood,
Charles M. "Nellie" Heath, and Rob
ert Zonne.
Not present to receive their degree
were three tracksters who had gone
to Minneapolis for the National Col
legiate Athletic Association meet in
which they placed second. They
were Captain Raymond Malott, en
gineering; Clayton Edson Burrows,
journalism; and Hugh Gribbin, edu
cation.
On the football team five mem
bers were awarded A.B. degrees.
They were John T. "Jake" Brigham,
Leo M. Ferko, Robert E. Matthews,
Joseph A. Vigna, and Louis S. Tsou- I
tsouvas.
