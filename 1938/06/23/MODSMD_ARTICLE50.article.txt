•strange how some people can ac
r oniplish so much in a short space of
, ime such as that between Spring
mrt Summer quarters, but Mr. Wal
<iemar Johansen makes it look sim
ple "Jo," as he is affectionately
known to his students, has been
down at San Juan Bautista, sketch
«.np the landscape and buildings
hereabouts for use in the coming
production of "Gringo's Gamble."
vVhile there, he had access to the
Pla/a Hotel, California's oldest hos
telry, and sketched its famous bar
3nd gambling rooms.
A.s though this were not enough,
Mr Johansen returned to find he
had been awarded a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation enabling
him to tour Europe and study the
(heaters for use in his forthcoming
bouk on the Technical Equipment of
World Theaters.
Library Display
At present, there is a display of
. tudent work at the San Francisco
Linrary, which includes costume
plates designed by Mrs. Helen
Green's classes, and the drawings
ana photographs Mr. Johansen made
vit San Juan Bautista.
There will be a local display of
his same type of work in the Farm
Art Gallery beginning July 5.
in homas Wood Stevens, Acting Di
li eetor of Dramatics, returns to the
•ampus after a few months at his
home in Santa Fe. Mr. Stevens, for
sne» Director of the Globe Theater
Company at the Chicago World's
and one time head of the Drama
Department at Carnegie Tech, will
direct his own adaptation of "Ca
milie" and Bret Harte's story of
' Luck Roaring Camp," and
' rom advance dope, it should prove
to be an hilarious hit.
Lange Assists
Gordon Lange, we are told, is
keeping busy assisting Felton Elkins
n nutting the finishing touches on
his forthcoming play "Gringo's Gam
ble.''
J. Miles Heberer, who is directing
' Uncle Tom's Cabin," has conceived
he idea of projection of scenery \
.since there are approximately
wenty-five scene changes in this ]
jiav. Ordinarily, the machinery i
needed for such projection is too ex
pensive for amateur use; however, '
he- technical department has sue- ,
eeded in simplifying the process ,
uid has adapted it to fit the sum- :
Jner budget.
Bud Cady, the shining light of ;
Johnny Johnson," will be on the j
campus this summer, and is at pres- :
•m rehearsing in the role of the
villain in "A Murder Has Been Ar- j
ranged" to be presented soon by the f
Palo Alto Community Theater.
.
Austin in Role
~ Austin, the Clem Mc- !
'arthy of "Is Europe?" is slated for j
.i tumbling role in "Uncle Tom's i
Camn."
Tanet Dole and Joe Lawry are
rumored to be rehearsing in "Spring
time for Henry," also to be presented
h'fi summer by the Community
Theater.

J. P. Cahn, star of "Kind Lady,"
and a director in his own right since
his production of "Is Europe?" will
also grace the theater, and may be
expected to do some good work in
"Uncle Tom's Cabin."
The grapevine has it that Stagers
are planning three readings this
quarter, but until Prexy Paul Crary
can be reached for more dope, the
titles and dates remain a mystery.
Gordy Williams will be directing.
Fitts To Light
Charles Fitts, who formerly
worked with Professor Ross on his
study of Psychology of the Theater,
has returned from his position at the
Pasadena Playhouse, and will be
Assistant Technical Director in
charge of lighting.
Bill Basset, accomplished designer
of sets, will be in charge of scenery
construction, and has made a fine
start in designing the settings for
"Camille of Roaring Camp."
As soon as the theater gets under
way, me too.
