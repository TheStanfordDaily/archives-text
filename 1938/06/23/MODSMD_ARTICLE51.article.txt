### DON BROWN 
It could happen to you. Say you'd*
been off in the hills, say Plumas
county, parsimoniously doling out
ungrammatical misinformation to a
couple hundred of God's own,
mixed, for ten months. You've come
back to the farm by way of Nevada,
Lake and Del Norte counties, and
you've fixed a tire at 2 a.m. some
where near Scotia. Say you wheel
up Palm Drive, wondering if the
No Picnicking signs were there last
year and if Gordie Davis still knows '
no friends in a traffic jam. You're
tired. You hope you get the same
place to live you had last year, but
you know you should have written.
You guess you'll stop at the fire
house, chat with the chief and the
boys and see if you can't shake a
pretty seedy feeling. You turn in
by the filling station where A1 Webb j
gives you the Shriner's grip and I
tries to grease your car before it
comes to a stop. He says your tires

*look bad. You don't feel any better,
but Chris Baldo pops in view, and
you manage to shake Shell for a i
minute. The chief is out pulling
boxes. As an old fire eater, you feel
you ought to remember what it;
j means so you don't ask. Is Louie
| still around? He is. Bob Houston?
i Yes, but not in and maybe leaving.
How about Barney Greenlee? Leav
| ing tomorrow. Nobody on tap to |
1 battle flame but Chris and the j
! chief's abominable pooch, Prince. '
Funny nobody ever ran him through
a fire siren. You see Officer Davis, j
Everything under control, but a |
wistful vacation light in his eye. J
Says he saw Barney heading for the |
Administration Building. You fol- I
! low. No Barney, but there's Mrs. I
j Coverley. A fond dream becomes j
reality. You tell her you don't want
| a job. No hashing, no piano playing, j
no gardening, no bookswabbing, !
janiting, tutoring, typing, nothing. |
You smile triumphantly but she's
phoning again. You droop out. Ah,
you say to yourself, and life burbles
high again, there's Bill Gunther.
| That'll do it. You waddle down the
j steps and up to the counter. You
| get it from Bill's own lips that the
I old man is slipping. Falls asleep
j over the evening paper now. and
, hair thinning rapidly. This, you re
j member cheerfully, is the prelude to |
j a good old spicy Gunther narrative.
| There was a guy in here the other j
I night. By Gosh, it made me laugh.
A hand on the shoulder. Why it's
Ballard! Good old Ballard. Brown,
jhe says, just the man for the first 1
I guest column. Have to have it in
fifteen minutes. Sure you will. Just j
whip over to the office and knock
out a column or so. Old Timer's Re
turn. You know, greeting old pals,
old faces, cars rolling in covered .
with desert dust, and what-not.
Thanks a lot. I'll teach him.
There are about 1450 movie extras |
in Hollywood.

Flashlights were used long before
electricity was discovered. Fireflies,
placed in hollowed-out dishes, fur
nished the "batteries," and the light
was extinguished by closing the
box-lid.
