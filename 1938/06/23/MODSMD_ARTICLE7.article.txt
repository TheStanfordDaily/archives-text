# Summer Director Welcomes New Students
## 
### JOHN A. SELLARDS Director of Summer Quarter 
This year's summer qiuirler marks the 21st anniversary
of organized summer work at Stanford. Some of you are here
for the first time; others are already members of the Stanford
family, having studied here during the preceding part of the
academic year or during previous summer quarters. This is a

university, and you
i are all urged to enjoy the dis
tinctive community life which
our campus affords.
In addition to carrying through
your programs of study, we hope
you will find here opportunities to
broaden the scope of your interests
as well as to find pleasant recrea
tion. A program of lectures ar
ranged for you during the summer
covers subjects in many fields of
culture. In addition to the various
lectures in English, students inter
ested in improving their knowledge
of French will have an opportunity
to follow a series of lectures in that
language.
Our program in music for the
Summer Quarter is more important
than any we have had in the past.
As resident members of the Stan
ford faculty will be the world-fa
mous Roth Quartet, and they will
offer a series of concerts open with
out charge to members of the stu
dent body.
Those of you who are not familiar
with this region of California will
I find many interesting spots at the
seashore and in the mountains easily
accessible from Stanford. We want
you to take advantage of and to
profit by the many offerings of the
campus for summer recreation, such
as the use of the swimming pools,
the tennis courts, the golf course,
j and boating and swimming at Sears
ville Lake.
It is hoped that you will all have
a pleasant and profitable time at
1 Stanford and will enjoy the recrea
i tion and culture offered by our com
! munity life, to which we all join in
I welcoming you.
