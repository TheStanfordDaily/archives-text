# News Editors, Publishers End C.N.P.A. Meet
## Will Rogers, Jr., Talks On Spain; Current Problems Discussed 
### 
More than a hundred publishers,
editors, and their wives attended the
first Editorial Conference of the
California Newspaper Publishers'
Association on the Stanford campus
over the week-end. Technical talks
by newspaper men and talks on
topics of general interest by profes
sional men were featured at the
meeting.
"Franco will win, but he has sown
hate, and he will reap hate in Re
publican Spain for generations." This
was a prediction made by Will Rog
ers, Jr., who spoke at the Saturday
evening session of the publishers'
conference. Rogers, who is the pub
lisher of the Beverly Hills Citizen
and the son of the famous American
humorist, has recently returned
from Spain.
Pollock Speaks
Also a speaker at the Saturday
evening meeting was Dr. James K.
Pollock, of the University of Michi
gan, who is teaching in the Depart
ment of Political Science at Stanford
this summer. Speaking on "Cam
paign Funds in a Democracy," Dr.
Pollock told the journalists that im
proper financing of political parties
is a basic source of evil in our gov
ernment. He said that the great ex
pense involved in American political
campaigns, a major difficulty in the
problem, is due to our complicated
system of government and to the
apathy of the electorate.
"If an Englishman had to vote for
a country councilman and a mem
ber of Parliament on the same bal
lot, he would be flabbergasted," Dr.
Pollock asserted. The American
ballot, and particularly, California's
ballot, is far too long, Pollock said.
Thomas Speaks
At the meeting of the C.N.P.A.
held on Saturday afternoon, Pro
fessor Earl C. Thomas told news
papermen that the driver, the car,
and the highway must be controlled
and co-ordinated by a central or
ganization of qualified experts if
the highways of California are to be
made safe.
Speaking on the topic, "Why Your
Readers Are Dying on the High-<
ways," Professor Thomas, a member
of Stanford's School of Engineering,
said that the answer to the accident
question is rather simple; it can be
answered in one word—SPEED."
Changes Needed
"Only through the active and in
telligent support of good citizens"
can America hope to end highway
killing, Thomas told the newspaper
men. He pointed out that "selfish
interests will impede progress," and
he emphasized the need for drastic
changes in the administration of
highway affairs. Thomas cited the
present supervisor-controlled county
road system as examples of the re
sults of inadequate and uncoordi
nated administration.
Professor Thomas suggested that
strict requirements for drivers' li
censes, more reasonable traffic laws,
and a double standard of speed
rules—one for day driving and one
for night driving—would greatly
simplify present traffic problems.
Health Services \
"Make the health officer a person

of some importance in the commun
ity," was the advice of Dr. Russel V.
Lee of Palo Alto in his address to
members of the C.N.P.A. editorial
conference on Saturday. With
"What You Can Do to Combat So
cial Disease in Your Community"
as his topic, Dr. Lee pointed out
that there is a need for better train
ed, more capable individuals in the
field of public health administration.
The work of the health officer should
be subjected to constant scrutiny,
he said.
"We can easily purchase freedom
from syphilis," Dr. Lee continued.
It is the place of the newspaper, he
said, to give information on the
causes of and cures for syphilis and
gonorrhoea. This information, Dr.
Lee stated, is readily available to
the newspapers through such organ
izations as the American Social Hy
giene Association.
Elicl Talks
Dr. Lee expressed his fear that
public interest in the problem of
social diseases might die. He called
upon the newspaper men to keep

"the public alive to the importance
of the situation."
Following Dr. Lee's talk, Professor
Paul Eliel, of the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business, spoke on
"What the Editor Should Know about
the Wagner Act."
More than a hundred publishers,

"What You Can Do to Combat So
cial Disease in Your Community"
as his topic, Dr. Lee pointed out
that there is a need for better train
ed, more capable individuals in the
field of public health administration.
The work of the health officer should
be subjected to constant scrutiny,
he said.
"We can easily purchase freedom
from syphilis," Dr. Lee continued.
It is the place of the newspaper, he
said, to give information on the
causes of and cures for syphilis and
gonorrhoea. This information, Dr.
Lee stated, is readily available to
the newspapers through such organ
izations as the American Social Hy
giene Association.
Elicl Talks
Dr. Lee expressed his fear that
public interest in the problem of
social diseases might die. He called
upon the newspaper men to keep

"the public alive to the importance
of the situation."
Following Dr. Lee's talk, Professor
Paul Eliel, of the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business, spoke on
"What the Editor Should Know about
the Wagner Act."
More than a hundred publishers,
editors, and their wives attended the
first Editorial Conference of the
California Newspaper Publishers'
Association on the Stanford campus
over the week-end. Technical talks
by newspaper men and talks on
topics of general interest by profes
sional men were featured at the
meeting.
"Franco will win, but he has sown
hate, and he will reap hate in Re
publican Spain for generations." This
was a prediction made by Will Rog
ers, Jr., who spoke at the Saturday
evening session of the publishers'
conference. Rogers, who is the pub
lisher of the Beverly Hills Citizen
and the son of the famous American
humorist, has recently returned
from Spain.
Pollock Speaks
Also a speaker at the Saturday
evening meeting was Dr. James K.
Pollock, of the University of Michi
gan, who is teaching in the Depart
ment of Political Science at Stanford
this summer. Speaking on "Cam
paign Funds in a Democracy," Dr.
Pollock told the journalists that im
proper financing of political parties
is a basic source of evil in our gov
ernment. He said that the great ex
pense involved in American political
campaigns, a major difficulty in the
problem, is due to our complicated
system of government and to the
apathy of the electorate.
"If an Englishman had to vote for
a country councilman and a mem
ber of Parliament on the same bal
lot, he would be flabbergasted," Dr.
Pollock asserted. The American
ballot, and particularly, California's
ballot, is far too long, Pollock said.
Thomas Speaks
At the meeting of the C.N.P.A.
held on Saturday afternoon, Pro
fessor Earl C. Thomas told news
papermen that the driver, the car,
and the highway must be controlled
and co-ordinated by a central or
ganization of qualified experts if
the highways of California are to be
made safe.
Speaking on the topic, "Why Your
Readers Are Dying on the High-<
ways," Professor Thomas, a member
of Stanford's School of Engineering,
said that the answer to the accident
question is rather simple; it can be
answered in one word—SPEED."
Changes Needed
"Only through the active and in
telligent support of good citizens"
can America hope to end highway
killing, Thomas told the newspaper
men. He pointed out that "selfish
interests will impede progress," and
he emphasized the need for drastic
changes in the administration of
highway affairs. Thomas cited the
present supervisor-controlled county
road system as examples of the re
sults of inadequate and uncoordi
nated administration.
Professor Thomas suggested that
strict requirements for drivers' li
censes, more reasonable traffic laws,
and a double standard of speed
rules—one for day driving and one
for night driving—would greatly
simplify present traffic problems.
