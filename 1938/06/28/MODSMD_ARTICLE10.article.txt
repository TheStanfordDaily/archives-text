# Wilbur Claims U.S. Sororities Now Outmoded
## 
### 
Speaking to the National Conven
tion of Gamma Phi Beta at Del
Monte last Sunday, Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur told delegates that "the type
of grouping that the sorority offers
seems to me to be out-moded when
one views the life of women of to
day in our republic."
Charging that sororities had "el
bowed out" the woman who is self
supporting, he said that unless the
sorority ceases to be only a "self
admiration society with everybody
else looking in, it will fail to pro
vide leaders for the democracy its
members will live in."
Speaking of the place which wom
en may hold in a democracy, Dr.
Wilbur felt that "women have been
a great disappointment from the
standpoint of the conduct of the Re
public. Our women must now face
frankly the need for developing
themselves so that they will be able
to maintain themselves," he added.
"The question as I see it is whether
the sororities can mold their mem
bers to fit into the difficult situations
they will meet in life as it is today.
As I watch some of them operate, I
feel that they are as much out of
date as in the grandmother who in
her fifties retires to her rocking
chair to crochet, to eat soup because
she has no teeth, and to use knitting
needles because she has no glasses."
