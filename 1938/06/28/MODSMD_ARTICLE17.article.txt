### MARGERY BAILEY 
It is dark, with that uncertain and
irritating darkness which makes the
stranger suffer a plunging heart and
that sudden spasm at the spine
which means a mis-step, or the
dread of a mis-step; the place re
sounds with echoes shocking each
other into a rattling mumble, which
flakes itself into a pinging buzz be
low the crash of new sound; there
is an indescribable smell of old
shoes, of chill cement, of tepid lino
leum which has been foully mis
treated with something which is
either oily or sticky or both. The
corridors are lined with locked

doors; the mere presence of fresh air
is something one forgets. But this is
in the dungeons.
Upstairs the plasters flake down
from untended walls; the cobwebs,
weighted and visible with the dusty
accretions of months, tangle at the
corners or lift and fall with horrible
soundlessness against the walls;
down the iron stairs comes a clang
ing footfall, which echoes in an iron
repetition of itself to the very top of
the dark stair-well. At the end of
the drab passage a flicker of paper
lifts in something that must once
have been a breeze.
The place is hollow, spiritless, im
personal with the weary vacancy of
something untenanted, but invaded
with a restless and nervous horde of
passers-by, who tramp through it by
necessity, on their way somewhere
else. When the footfalls, the shuf
fling passage, the clangor of battling
voices, stop for a moment, the place
is quiet, but it is the quiet of decay
rather than repose; it is not the still
ness of a place lived in or loved. It
is a plant, a warehouse, simply walls
with an aroma of what has been
there and been passed along.
It is not the concentration camp
of any undemocratic power; it is not
an East side tenement; it is not the
setting for some horror story. I
write, dear Jerusha, from the Eng
lish building at Stanford University.
This is the home of truth, beauty,
intellectual light, and all, mind you,
in the modern manner; but we get
it filtered through the drab im
pressions forced upon us by a set
ting which would satisfy the most
exacting anchorite. This is a house
fitted for machinery rather than
life; it is little wonder that all of us
succumb to the effect of it sooner or
later. Come in, get photographed
and numbered, slog into the as
signed dens, sit oppressed and sulky
through the drone of the inquisitors,
offer evidence of these hours of pen
ance, slouch out to get other ticket
ing, and be gone. In most shabby
places where people have lived and
learned fof any length of time there
is a certain quality of comfortable
peace, of friendly placidity; a love of
learning is supported by the kindli
ness of surroundings, by well-worn
pleasantness. There is in these dank
halls a forbidding coldness, and
something of it is repeated in the
Stanford spirit. At the core of the
graduate there remains something

hard and unlovely, a quality of the
machine-made, which at its best is
the beginning of that excellent phe
nomenon, the successful man. There
is no nonsense about us or our plant;
we don't go in for pretty pictures or
these mural affairs. We tend to the
business in hand. I write, dear
Jerusha, from the English Building
—get in line, you!—poetry in 200K,
novels on the main floor—stay where
you belong, can't you, and let the
guard examine you thoroughly be
fore you try to get out, mind.
