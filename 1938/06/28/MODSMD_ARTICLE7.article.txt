# To Perform Here

### 
After a pre-view program Satur
day night, the world-famous Roth
Quartet of Budapest will open its se
ries of Wednesday "Intimate Mati
nees" tomorrow at 4:15 o'clock in
Memorial Hall.
Led by Feri Roth, and presented
by the newly organized Friends of
Music, the string ensemble will open
its program with parts I-111 of
Bach's "Art of the Fugue." Complet
ing the program will be the modern
"Rispetti e Strambotti," of Malipero;
and Schumann's Quartet in A Minor.
Program notes by Alfred Frank
enstein, music critic for the San
Francisco Chronicle, describe the

opening number as the last work of
Bach, uncompleted when he died.
"Rispetti e Strambotti" is de
scribed as the work of Italy's out
standing modernist, and dispensing
with the customary devices of mu
sical form. It consists of 20 "stan
zas," short, independent, but con
tinuous movements. The title is de
rived from the traditions of Italian
folk poetry.
The concert will be open free of
charge to students registered for
summer quarter, and to resident
faculty members. Tickets are avail
able in Room 173 of the Adminis
tration Building before 3 o'clock to

morrow. Tickets for later concerts
may be obtained at the same office
on the Thursday preceding each
concert.
Other persons desiring tickets
may purchase them from Keeble's
in Palo Alto, or from the office of
the Friends of Music, in the Vestry
Tomorrow's concert will be the
first of five Wednesday afternoon
concerts by the Roth Quartet, with
a second Monday night series open
ing a week from Monday, July 11.
The concerts have been sponsored
by Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge,
and partially underwritten by the
Friends of Music.


"Sitting sedately
in a charmed
circle, this en
semble of
virtuosi, these
wonder workers,
give a celestial,
transfigured
quality to
compositions—
classic, romantic,
or modern
—that few
quartets seem
able to achieve."
This is how
P. K. Thomajan,
eminent critic,
described the
world-famous
Roth Quartet,
which is soon
to play on the
Stanford campus.
