# Registration Hits New High
## 1006 Enroll for Summer Session 
### 
Stanford yesterday wiped out all post-depression registra
tion records when, in a 201 membership leap over last year's
record total, 1938's summer registrations surged over the
1000 mark.
Figures compiled by the Registrar's oflice at the close of
the third day of registration indicated that 1006 booklets had

►been issued, topping last year's total
of 805 by 20 per cent.
"I honestly don't know what to
say," remarked Registrar J. Pearce
Mitchell in commenting upon the
increase, "only a careful analysis
will disclose the reason for the rise.
However, at this point it is notice
able that there is a larger registra
tion in the School of Education, and
that there are more freshmen reg
istered."
This year's gain shows that the
men have a slight upper hand, go
ing from last year's 520 to yester
day's 634. The women show almost
as large a gain, coming from a 1937
mark of 280 to this year's 372 total.
Last year's statistics indicate that
the men gained 84 in total member
ship, with the figure for the women
being increased by 24.
This summer's registration is the
! high point of a gradual increase
since 1929's record breaking regis
tration of 1408.
Karl M. Cowdery, associate regis
trar, was also unable to explain the
increased registration figures.
"We can't tell until we have made
an analysis of the figures," he said.
"When that is done, we will have a
basis upon which to work."
Statistics announced yesterday are
for fully registered students, not in
cluding auditors.
