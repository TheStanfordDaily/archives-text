# Roth Quartet Scores With First Concert
## String Group Plays Varied Program To Large Hall Audience 
### JIM STONE 
Before an audience that left hardly
a seat vacant on the main floor of
Memorial Hall yesterday afternoon,
the Roth Quartet opened its series of
summer concerts in a fashion which
should leave little doubt that this
will be a gala summer for music at
Stanford.
Their initial program, ranging
from classic Bach, through a modern
work by the Italian, Malipiero, and
concluding with the romantic Schu
mann Quartet in A Minor, amply
demonstrated the smooth precision,
the incredibly unified richness of
tone which this ensemble possesses.
Opening Work
The opening work, parts I-IV of
Bach's great "The Art of Fugue,"
the quartet handled carefully, re
strained yet compelling in its
breadth. Academic in scope as this
last work of Bach is, meticulous
phrasing and intelligent interpreta
tion brought out its full beauty.
In their second offering, Mali
piero's modern "Rispetti e stram
botti," the quartet was given full
opportunity to demonstrate the ver
satility of their interpretative and
performance skills. Ranging from
poignant quietude to brisk folk
melody, the work was played
throughout with a sure intonation
and melodic fullness that left little
to be desired.
Schumann Quartet
But it was in the Schumann Quar
tet that the Quartet's incredible rich
ness of tone reached its moving
peak. Not four, but one instrument
created a haunting tapestry of tone,
now full and vigorous, now rich and
mellow, but always a whole.
In their second concert, Wednes
day. July G, the Quartet will con
tinue "The Art of Fugue" with parts
V-VII; in addition, the group will
play Bartok's modern "Quartet in
A Minor"; and will conclude with the
"Italian Serenade" of Hugo Wolf.
Students and faculty members
may obtain complimentary tickets
by applying to the Summer Quarter
office. Room 173 in the Administra
tion building. The concert will be
gin at 4:15.
