Briefer Case by Ped Gogue's Child
I carry the Brief Case for Peda j
Gogue. I am terribly impresesd by: '
core courses, socialized activity, the ;
word matriculate . .. when my
mind is guilty of wishful thinking I i
dwell on Dr. Kilpatrick's lovely '
white hair, on Dr. Eurich's hand- '
some shirts and ties, on Dean Ke
fauver's boyishness and pink ears, i

on Dr. Bell's smile-plus-white
teeth, on Dr. Bennett's pint size and
Dr. Henderson's attractive speech.
. . . Joyce Kilmer marveled at God's
making a tree. I marvel at the man
ner in which the Education Grad
uates spend hours discussing the
question, "Is a stone an organism?"
... I have inside dope on the fact
that Dr. Brown's bite is no indica
tion of his bark. ... I am grateful
for nice, friendly profs, the privi
lege of being here, banks who agree
that Stanford's summer session is
worth a personal loan, the Cellar's
Dividend Plate when I'm hungry.
