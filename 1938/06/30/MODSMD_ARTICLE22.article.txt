# College Life Goes On In Spain Despite War
## 
### HARVEY YORKE 
Although a violent war is being
raged in Spain, university life is
continuing at an almost normal rate,
according to Professor Angel Gon
zalez Palencia, visiting professor
from the University of Madrid.
Professor Palencia said that at
present there are eight universities
under the control of the Franco
government, each teaching the regu
lar courses.
Too few professors constitutes one
of the most pressing problems in the
eight universities. In more than 1
two years of fighting enough pro- ;
fessors have been lost to leave some
schools short.
To relieve the situation the facul- |
ties in all the former academies j
(such as mathematics, philosophy. |
and education) have been coneen- !
trated to supply each of the eight
universities with the men it needs. !
While one university may have too !
few philosophy professors, it may
have more than enough mathematics
professors, and under the new sys
tem it will move its philosophy de
partment to another university.
Secondary education has also been
reorganized to take care of students
who will enter college in the next
few years. High schools have
adopted a system used in Ameri- :
can schools where students expect- I

ing to go to collcge take one course
and those not going to college take
another.
Too many women is another of the
university problems. The war has
taken many of the young men of
the country leaving a surplus of
women. This, said Professor Palen
cia, will be taken care of by more
strict entrance examinations. While
the problem is bothering the fac
ulty, in all probability some of the
students are not worried.
Professor Palencia claimed most of
the professors in Spain favor Gen
eral Franco. This was shown, he
said, at the beginning of the war
wh?n 4500 professors in loyalist
universities requested positions in
insurgent universities and only 50

asked to be sent to universities held
by the Loyalist government.
Professor Palencia is teaching
three courses this quarter, and
when asked how he liked Stanford
students he said he was "pleasantly
surprised" both by the number in
his classes and their attitude. He
said that they were very interested
in the study of Spanish and seemed
very well prepared.
