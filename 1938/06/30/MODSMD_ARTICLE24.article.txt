week-end, when 125 million heads
(roughly) will be turned skyward
to watch thousands of skyrockets
soaring through the heavens. Stu
dents at Stanford are going to take
advantage of the rare opportunity
(the administrators of this Univer
sity are not liberal with their holi
days) to join their fellow-citizens
in celebrating Independence Day
(July 4).
If you are undecided about what
you're going to do over the week
end. there is submitted herewith a
list of suggestions:
Newcomers to the Coast might
enjoy browsing around San Fran
cisco and vicinity. The eating places,
theaters, shops, spots of scenic in
terest (Chinatown, Fishermen's
Wharf, Telegraph Hill, Mission Do
lores) offer wonderful opportunities
for spending time and money.
Bay Region
A circle trip of the Bay Region
should be interesting. Cross on the
Sar. Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge
to Metropolitan Oakland (don't .say
"East Bay" 01* you'll get into trouble
with the Chamber of Commerce).
Thi 11 go, via the Richmond ferry,
to Marin county, taking in Muir
Woods and Mt. Tamalpais—wonder
ful views—and return to the city
over the Golden Gate Bridge.
Towns on the shores of Monterey
Ea\ are featuring big celebrations
over the week-end. Santa Cruz will
have big fireworks displays, big pa
rades, big battleships, a big water
carnival, a big horseshoe tourna
ment, and a big crowd. If you like
your fellowmen in large bunches,
this is the place for you. On the
Monterey Peninsula, Del Monte,
C'armel, and the historic old town
of Monterey are the best bets.
Pajaro Valley
Close by, in Watsonville, Pajaro
Valley is staging its annual Fourth
oi July celebration. Old-timers' pa
rades. barbecues, and bicycle races
will be featured.
In Southern California, Santa Bar
bara's Semana Nautica celebration
and Orange County's big party at
Huntington Beach are expected to
draw large crowds. As the name im
plies, Santa Barb ra's show is de
voted largely to sailing races, battle
ships, and marine pageants.
Towns in the northern part of the
state—-Willits, Eureka, Weed, and
Quincy—are going in strong for ro
deos, pioneer pageants, and hoi'se
shows. Crescent City's Pirate pa
rade, and Alturas' Modoc rodeo
should provide lot;, of fun.
American necks, which have re
cently been strained by the upward
flight of the stock market, are to
receive further punishment over the
week-end, when 125 million heads
(roughly) will be turned skyward
to watch thousands of skyrockets
soaring through the heavens. Stu
