# China Morale Fine, Quaker Report Shows

"The morale of the Chinese people
| is splendid." Thus spoke Mr. Harry
; T. Sileoek in an interview granted to
The Daily last night. Mr. Sileoek has
| just returned from a two and a half
months' trip of investigation in China
1 for the Society of Friends.
Mr. Sileoek was 011 campus to tell
of his work to a group of faculty
members and other interested per
sons at the home of Dr. D. Elton
Trueblood, University chaplain. He
felt it unwise to make any predic
tions but believed there was a dis
tinct probability of an epidemic out
break, with the possibility of famine
in the refugee - infested Shanghai
area. He hopes his Society will es
tablish a center there from which
relief work may be carried on.
During his sojourn in China he
had interviews with the president
and premier, as well as meetings
1 with many university heads. He
formerly taught at West China Union
University in Cheng-tu, provincial
j capital of western Szechwan.
His opinion is that the Chinese
people will keep 011 fighting indefi
i nitely, hoping in time to wear the
Japanese down until they are forced
|to give up. He feels the war may
! drag out for many years, but that
, the morale of the Chinese is equal
to the struggle.
Continuing his tour he spent sev
eral weeks in Japan, where he was
met with great friendliness. He
found that the Japanese believe
Great Britain is their worst enemy,
i and that the Chinese have managed
to escape many times by their aid.
The Japanese can get absolutely no
news through their censor board and
learn only what the government
leaders wish them to know. They
are virtually prohibited from having
short-wave radio sets that would
enable them to find out news for
themselves, Mr. Sileoek declared.
The Friends' Service Council, of
which Mr. Sileoek formerly was Sec
retary of the English Section, will
meet in Philadelphia next week to
decide on recommendations for
warded to them by Mr. Sileoek and
a companion who accompanied him
! on the journey. The Society is inter
; ested in doing all it can in a practical
] way to express its feeling of good
will and love for mankind. The
Friends feel that in this time of
strife and hatred some gesture of
goodwill is a necessary effort.

All ships which arrive at Sydney,
Australia, are searched for British
coins; the coins have a greater value
in Australia than in Great Britain.
