# Group to Read 'Elektra' as Drama Opener
## Stanford Graduates Taking Major Roles In Well-known Play 
### 
The cry for vengeance which
echoes from Room 100 tonight at
8:00 o'clock will arrest the attention
of music-lovers as well as those who
love a play. Hoffmansthal's "Elek
tra," in Arthur Symons' translation,
is given in formal group reading as
first item of the Dramatists' Program,
a series of readings and lectures sup
porting the art interests of the sum
mer.
Energetic and terrifying as a play,
the beautiful verse was also the basis
I of Strauss's opera on Elektra, which
j is to be presented this winter in San
Francisco; this group reading is pre
sented as a means of acquainting
I audiences with the material of
i Strauss's work.
Elektra, the part which has been
j made famous in music by Rosa
Pauly, will be read with tragic force
by Lucie Bentley, and the spiritually
torn Orestes by Joseph Whitaker.
| Both are Stanford graduates, whose
training and present profession have
i made them for several years favorite
; interpreters of fine drama among
Stanford and Palo Alto audiences.
Other familiar readers in the cast,
who return for performances worthy
of their past records, are Harriet Mc-
Causland, Myna Hughes, Don
Brown, George Wilson, Sylvia Ones
ti. The reading introduces for the
| first time Dorothy Adams and Eliza
beth Voshall. Dr. Margery Bailey,
who has directed the reading, will
read the directions which set the
atmosphere for the play.
The reading is given under the
auspices of the committee on the
Maxwell Anderson Award; admis
sion will be ten cents.
