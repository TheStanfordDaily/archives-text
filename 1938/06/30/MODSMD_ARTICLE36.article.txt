# Prize Offered For Historical Drama Sketch
## Readings To Be Used By Recital Team Of McGaw and Knox 
### 
Baldwin McGaw of the Fairmont
School of the Theater in San Fran
cisco offers through the Verse Drama
Committee of Stanford University a
new prize for dramatic composition.
Open to all students and friends of
the University, the contest is limited
to the 15-minute dramatic sketch
for a man and a woman, and the
material preferred is romantic or
tragic episodes of historical signifi
cance.
Sketches, accompanied by suitable
cover and return postage, should be
in the hands of the Contest Proctor
of Stanford University on August 7,
J938. First prize will be $25, second
prize $15, with possible arrangements
made for less effective sketches
which still are usable.
The sketches are to be used by
McGaw and his charming recital
partner, Emma Knox, in their recital
series, which has become so suc
cessful as to carry them beyond west
coast audiences; the new materials
will be presented throughout the
East, in the Town Hall and forum
engagements for which Mr. McGaw
has contracted. The McGaw per
formances have always been marked
try both charm and dignity, and for
the most part the actors prefer verse
to prose, the imaginative to the real
istic.
Costume pieces are used because
the glamor of pictorial effect pleases
the audiences they address. Mr. Mc-
Gaw hopes to receive sketches deal
ing with unhackneyed historical fig
i.res, and frankly has no interest —
i"or this purpose — in Washington,
Lincoln, Henry VIII, or Richard 111.
Without any wish to dictate sub
jects, McGaw believes that sugges
tions cannot come amiss- and has
Mentioned as pleasant subjects for
these sketches, such personalities as
David Garrick and Peg Wo'ffiington,
Charles I and Henrietta, Flora Mac-
Donald and the Young Pretender.
The prize-winning sketches will
bccome the property of Mr. McGaw
for three years, at the end of which
feme further business arrangements
may be made with the author. Ad
dress all contributions to Contest
Proctor, Office 200 M, Stanford Uni
versity.
