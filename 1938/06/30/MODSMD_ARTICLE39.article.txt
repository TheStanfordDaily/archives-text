## Jim Corner Describes 'Luck' in Big City 
### 
"I'm the luckiest boy in New
York," maintains Stanford's Jim
Corner, who after only three months
in that city landed the villain's part
in George Abbot's current Broad
way production, "What a Life."
Previous to this time and immedi
ately after his graduation in '37, Jim
worked with the summer stock near
Boston, following which he played
the country playwright's part in Ab
bot's London production of "Room
Service."
"The Londoners really appreciate
American gags," said the young
comedian. "They've bepn condi
tioned by the movies. But in the
country the punch lines rolled over
the footlights, and it sort of slowed
us up."
Jim, who is on the farm now for a
.short vacation, has just arrived from
Hollywood where Paramount was
eager to claim him for a new picture.
"But Mr. Abbot has been so kind
to me I wouldn't think of breaking
my contract," said Jim, "and besides
I feel I can get more experience on
the stage."
