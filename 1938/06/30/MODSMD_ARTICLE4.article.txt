# Stevens Speaks On Stanford Hour
## 
### 
The increasing importance of uni
versity theatrical productions was
i emphasized by Thomas Wood Ste
vens, acting director of dramatics at
i Stanford, on the Stanford University
radio hour last Monday evening,
i After pointing out that strife be
[ tween university-trained men and
) professional actors had existed from
Elizabethan times until the advent of
[ the moving picture, Mr. Stevens
' traced the recent development of
I different forces that have forced the
! professional theatrical school of
S "hard knocks" to recognize the im
portance of university training as a
background for acting in Hollywood,
; on Broadway, or for directing.
"In all three fields, the opportuni-
I ties go to the young people who have
! had a thorough and all-round train
| ing," he said.
University theatrical activity has
| become more pointed and more prae
j tical, Mr. Stevens claimed, saying the
purpose of college dramatics is "to
give the students a first-hand expe
j rience of the drama in its historic
place." primarily to student actors
1 and secondarily to student audiences.
Next Monday evening, Dr. Eric
| Liljencrantz, assistant professor of
' medic ine assigned to radiology, will
! discuss "The Cancer Patient Today"
ton the Stanford University program
to be broadcast over KGO at 9:15
' o'clock.
