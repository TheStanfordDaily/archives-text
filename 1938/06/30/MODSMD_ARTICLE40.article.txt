# Harris Addresses Kiwanis Meeting
## 
### 
Speaking to the International Ki
wanis Club convention in San
Francisco Tuesday, Professor David
Harris of the history department
presented dangers facing present
day democracy and formulas for
world peace.
"The price of peace," he said, "is
rational, unemotional thinking and
acting with regard to the funda
mental causes of international an
archy and the welter of patriotism,
each of which suspects the rest of
the world and looks upon it as a
potential enemy.
The builders of the famous lean
ing tower of Pisa, Italy, intended it
to be vertical, but one side sank
when it was only 36 feet high, and
they finished it in the slanting posi
tion. *
