# Farm Softball League Starts Pennant Race
## Next Dean of Men Aids Slave Drivers To Cop First Game 
### 
Softball in the Wheel Chair
League got off to an auspicious start
on Tuesday with some close scores,
and some not so close. Under the
guidance of Professor Hand of the
Education Department twelve teams
put in their appearance.
Perhaps the best game of the day
was between the Slave Drivers and
the Outlaws with the former finally
getting the nod 9 to 8. In names
alone the Slave Drivers had the ad
vantage, for they could boast such
worthies as Bobby Grayson, John
Bunn, Larry Rouble, and others.
While errors abounded in most of
the contests, there was one contest,
however, which showed that the
players had had a fair amount of
previous softball training. In this
contest the Bushmen used their
hickories with enough dexterity to
eke out a 5 to 4 victory over the
Foreign Legion.
From the showings the first day
it is safe to predict that the now
favored Slave Drivers will probably
go down to defeat several times at
the hands of such teams as the
Legal Eagles, the Vultures, the
Bushmen, or the Vantors. The Van
tors are a particularly strong com
bination, being made up of the
champion Vandals of last year and
the first division Toreadors of last
season.
The scores for other contests are:
El Toro 11, Prune Pickers 8
Legal Eagles' 11, Accordians 6
Vultures 13, Wildcats 3
Vantors 7, Cardinals 4
