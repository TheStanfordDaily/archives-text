### 
Test flying recently of the nation's !
largest aircraft, the Douglas DC-4
and the Atlantic Clipper, is aviation I
history in the making. Hailed as two j
of the greatest contributions lately
made to aeronautics these planes
made their initial flights three weeks
ago, the Douglas at Santa Monica,
the Clipper at Seattle.
The DC-4, forty-two passenger
land plane with tricycle landing gear,
is reported to measure up to all ex
pectations. Designed for substrato
sphere flying it is expected to facili
tate the reducing of airline fares. The
Clipper, 72-passenger flying boat, i
nearly twice as big as those now I
flying the Pacific, is the first of six
ships of its kind to be built by Boe
ing for Pan American Airways.
Transatlantic service will begin in
September, it was announced by
Col. J. M. Johnson of the Depart
ment of Commerce, at which time
Pan American will be ready to carry
mail, and probably passengers, be
tween New York and London, a 24- [
hour hop. Eventually Pan American
and British Imperial Airways will
fly two round trips weekly.

In many cities the right to carry a
