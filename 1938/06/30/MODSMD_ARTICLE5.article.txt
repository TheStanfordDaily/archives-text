# Paly, Campus Police Tough On Speedsters
## Farm Traffic Laws Outlined To Help Unwary Motorists 
### 
In Palo Alto they really mean it.
That big yellow sign telling the
world how strictly the traffic laws
are enforced Ls serious about the
whole thing. There's no mercy to
anyone when it comes to speeding
violations. It'll make you pretty
cross to have to poke 'slowly like a
snail' along the Embarcadero some
night when you know well there
isn't a car within two blocks of you.
Officers Burns and Davis may be
seen all day and most of the night
cruising around in a black and white
Ford coupe working hard at en
forcing campus traffic laws.
A traffic ticket on the campus this
summer means the case will be tried
before either the Men's or Women's
Council, which consists of students
appointed by President Wilbur. The
main penalties are fines or the for
feiture of driving licenses. Fines are
fixed and vary only in exceptional
cases. The following rules are en
forceable here:
1. All state laws.
2. Twenty miles per hour within
the campus proper with special cau
tion to be exercised near the Post
Office, Library, 8.A.C., Chemistry
building, and along the Row.
4. As to parking, most of the re
stricted areas are marked by signs
or paint and should be obeyed both
night and day. Most important of
the parking areas is on the north
side of the Quad, i.e., on the side to
ward Palo Alto. Both here and in
Palo Alto pedestrian rights are
strictly enforced.
5. No riding on the outside of cars.
