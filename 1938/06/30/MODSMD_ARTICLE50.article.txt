He staggered into the Cellar of
the Union, wooden-faced and
glassy-eyed. Whatever it was he'd
just been through, it appeared to be
food he needed. He wolfed roast
beef sandwich, apple-pie and ice
cream, gulping coffee between bites.
Face still expressionless, eyes fixed
in a far-away stare, he turned like
an automaton from the stool, groped
his way like a sleep-walker through
the Cellar, past the cashier's win
dow, up the stairs, out into the sun
light and away—the check for his
meal fluttering helplessly on the
counter beside emptied dishes.
That's what the aptitude test does.
I know—l'm the guy.

During introductions, in 290 a:
She arose in order, gave her
name, where she taught and what.
The man in the next seat arose
in turn. "And I am the principal
of the school in which she teaches
—and half the faculty. And the
other half is my wife."
Dr. Bell: "Any trouble calling
faculty meetings?"
There was a sympathetic ripple
of laughter as another M.A. as
-1 pirant explained he was from the
! San Joaquin valley, "where it's
! usually pretty warm," and the
ripple bccame a roar when the ex
planation was detected as emerg
ing from a figure buttoned from
heels to chin in an overcoat.

"The name," interjected Dr. Bell,
"was Coats!"
The course is appropriately
titled. It's "Introductory Master
of Arts Seminar."

"And Lashley, whom we may
properly regard one of the half
dozen leading psychologists," con
cluded Dr. Terman in the opening
session of Psychology 224, "had had
only one course in psychology."
As class was about to adjourn
there was dubious scrutiny by Dr.
Terman of the cards on which stu
dents had noted their previous work
in psychology, and the suggestion to
one or two that a more elementary
course might be advantageous.
From the back of the room, clutch
ing at a straw: "And it was Lash
ley, Dr. Terman, who had but one
course in psychology?"
"His," warned Dr. Terman, "was
a laboratory course."
But there was a twinkle in his eye
and the Lashley disciple is still in
the class.

If' first impressions are the last
ing ones, what many bewildered
(or is it befuddled) embryo-edu
cators will remember longest about
the School of Education is the un
failing courtesy accorded those
j trying to blaze the shortest trail
through fields of concentration and
forests of requirements with a
credential cliff or two along the

way. One might be shunted from
secretary to dean to adviser to
adviser like a hot potato, or per
functorily, or something—but quite
the reverse is true. Even on reg
istration day, the least impatient
appear to be those who are on the
lines all day long—and at the busy
ends. No one could actually be as
concerned about the troubles of
others as they appear to be—but
there's nothing like a gracious at
mosphere to resolve difficulties.

Wondering, after a vow that 20
years of newspaper harness was
long enough, just how Ballard roped
me with this "guest columnist"
halter.
And what you're wondering is
why.
