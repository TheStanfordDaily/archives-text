# Roble to Hold Nitery Jolly-up
## Club Schedules Dance For Tuesday Night 
### 
Roble Club will sponsor a jolly-up
in the Nitery from 7 to 8 o'clock
next Tuesday evening, it was decided
by a meeting of the social committee
yesterday. The committee has not
decided whether the jolly-ups will
i be continued as weekly affairs,
Norma Watkins, Roble social
i chairman, urges all undergraduates
to come and get acquainted.
I For the benefit of new students the
J Frosh Handbook for last year de
! fined a jolly-up as follows: "A jolly
i up is a peculiar seven to eight dance,
] to which both men and women go
'stag.' It is definitely no-date, with
I cutting-in allowed. At jolly-ups you
j will probably meet the men and
! women you will afterwards date.
Just cut in on that good-looking
blonde and say, 'My name's Jim
i Smith, etc., etc.,' and if you're suf
j ficiently impressed, 'May I take you
I home?'"
