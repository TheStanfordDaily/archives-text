# Kiwanians, 1500 Strong, Invade Farm
## 
### 
"Wheah's the house o' thet Repub
lican, Hoovah?" The gentleman was
from Alabama. There were also
gentlemen, ladies and moppets —
droves of them—from every con
ceivable place in the country. It all
started yesterday afternoon when
members of the national Kiwanis
convention and their families in
vaded the summer quiet of Stanford,
1500 strong.
Leaving San Francisco at 9 o'clock
in the morning, a caravan of 400 cars
crossed to Berkeley, toured leisurely
down the Bay, and finally stopped at
Castlemont Country Club.
Fortified with a stout lunch, the
army successfully crossed Dumbar
ton Bridge. Leaderless but unafraid,
they split up into ask-me-another
groups on reaching the campus, and
poured from the entrance to the
Chapel, covering everything with
cameras and questions.
The law, to wit Gordy, was re
duced from its rightful white-car
dignity to a mere traflic cop in order
to prevent a jam in front of the
Administration building.
"I've been telling 'em where the
Hoover home is till I'm hoarse," he
grumbled, loosening his Sam Browne
a notch and running a nervous finger
around his drooping collar.
The Kiwanis convention will have
daily meetings and tours until Satur
day with headquarters in San Fran
cisco.
