# Child Teaching Methods Given By Kilpatrick
## Dr. Anibal Tells Need For Parent Education In Teaching Children 
### 
"Society's concern for early
childhood education follows two in
teracting lines," Dr. Wililam H. Kil
patrick, of Columbia University, told
attendants at the concluding session
of the Conference on Early Child
Education Wednesday morning.
"Each child shall live now the life
proper to it as a consummatory good
and foundations shall be laid for the
future living of each child," Dr. Kil
patrick stated. "Parents and teach
ers must learn how to get both for
children."
"Ninety-nine per cent of all learn
ing goes on in order to carry on the
thing we are already doing. We
learn what we truly live and accept
as our way of living," Dr. Kilpatrick
concluded.
Forum Sessions
Forum sessions were held at 9
o'clock Wednesday morning. Out
standing among these was Professor
Fred Anibal's address on "Early
Childhood Experiences in Science
Education." "Every child is a po
tential consumer of scientific inven
tions but few are producers," Dr.
Anibal stated.
Among the other sessions were:

Rhythm: Dr. Maud Knapp pointed
out that the child should be encour
aged to share his creations with
others as a matter of course, and not
for the purpose of "showing off."
Freedom in Discipline as Growth
Factors in Early Childhood: Chair
man A. H. Horrall introduced Pro
fessor Ruth Henderson, who assert
ed that the boundary between the
child and the environment is less
defined than for the adult and, there
fore, necessitates first-hand experi
ences for effective learning.
experiences which seem to serve
best in remedying deficiencies and
fostering the complete development
of the individual child, were recom
mended by Dr. Meek. Differences
in individual children, caused by
valuations in physiological maturity,
intellectual ability and personality,
should be given utmost considera
tion by parents.
Dr. Reginald Bell, Herbert R.
Stolz, and Florence Goodenough
assisted in the panel discussion.
Afternoon forums brought out
these points:
Growing children vitally need
three good meals daily and the schuol

noon meal was adequate, according

Department of Health.
Early childhood is a period of
rapid body growth, maturation of

body and neural systems, storing of
