# Softball Second Round Started
## Four Teams Remain In Undefeated Class 
### 
With their usual abundance of
baseball errors the Wheel Chair
League, symbolic of second child
hood of the old men of the campus,
moved into the second round of
play. El Toro, the Vultures, the
Bushmen, and the favored Slave
Drivers maintained their undefeated
records by victories over the Ac
cordians, the Foreign Legion, the
Wildcats, and the Vantors, respec
tively.
According to the Daily Fork, that
monument of journalism, which is
the product of several not so nimble
wits in the Education Department,
the game played between the Prune
Pickers and the Legal Eagles was as
unusual as the warm handshake of
a landlord, for the game ended in a
tie, 3-3. This is the first time such
a thing has happened in four years,
due mainly to the fact that in league
games play is so inconsistent that
it is indeed fortunate that the scores
are kept below the nineties.
The scores:
Vultures 12, Foreign Legion 11
Bushmen 11, Wildcats 7
Slave Drivers 14, Vantors 2
Outlaws 14, Cardinals 1
El Toro 7, Accordians 3
Prune Pickers 3, Legal Eagles 3
