### 
With the entry list closed and'
pairings posted, the Summer Session
Men's Tennis Tournament got under
way. All first-round matches must
he played by July 11, and the second
round by July 16.
Mr. Bugge of the Physical Edu
cation Department asks that each
player get in touch with his oppo
nent and that in the advent of any
confusion the players should im
mediately get in touch with him at
the Men's Gym.
Many notables are entered such
as John Bunn, Coach Shipke, and
the dynamo of the Business School,

'Ed Proctor, who in an interview
yesterday said that he was "a sure
winner." As is customary in past
summer tournaments, the loser sup
plies the balls in each match.
