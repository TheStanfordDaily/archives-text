Blessed event of the week occur
red recently in the workshop of the
Memorial Theater when Mr. and
Mrs. Squirrel announced in no un
certain terms the birth of multup
lets. The Squirrels, who have been
residing in the large tree used to
landscape the set of "Star Wagon,"
are rumored to be contemplating
moving into "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
upon completion of that set.

nolds on the Redwood Highway
near Willets.

Dropped down to the Community
Theater late last week to watch the
rehearsals of "Springtime for
Henry" and was glad to see that
Olive Krauthoff is cast in a role
which gives her every opportunity to
show her talent.

Janet Dole, who plays the lead in
"Springtime for Henry," was re
cently appointed an assistant in the
Department of Speech and Drama
and is teaching Vocal Expression to
teachers.

J. P. Cahn, who is assisting
Charles Fitts in the lighting of the
set for "Camille in Roaring Camp,"
may be seen driving his renowned
Model-T truck — the one used in
"Blue Jeans." How he ever got it
running again is as much of a mys
tery to him as it is to his friends.

A scarcity of potential actors to
fill the numerous parts available in
the department's various plays leads
me to remind anyone interested in
acting that the only prerequisite is
that the student be enrolled in the
University, not necessarily in the
Department of Speech and Drama.
The directors of the plays urge those
interested to get in touch with Mr.
Barker, 205 M.
