# Drama Group Gives Reading
## Tragedy Scores With Emotional Appeal 
### KATHERINE PAGE 
Last Tuesday night in Room 200,
Symons' translation of Hoffsman
thal's tragedy, "Elektra," was pre
sented by a capable group of read
ers under the direction of Dr. Mar
gery Bailey.
Hoffsmanthal treats the single
episode of Elektra and Orestes, tak
en from the tale of Atreus, empha
sizing Elektra, the embittered pas
sionate girl who struggles to avenge
a father's death against the fero
cious old queen, her mother, and
against her hesitant sister, Crysothe
mis.
The emotional feeling of the play
gradually rises, reaching its peak
with the return of Elektra's brother,
Orestes, who is able to accomplish
the murder of the queen, thus end
ing the former restraint and con
flict, and resulting in Elektra's com
plete emotional abandon.
The play was an excellent selec
tion for reading since it has a mini
mum of physical action, the real
dramatic struggle being conveyed by
the actor's words alone.
Former Stanford students Lucie
Bentley as Elektra and Myna
Hughes as Clythemestra did an ex
ceptionally good job of interpreta
tion. Don Brown, who read the
small part of Leander, also deserves
special mention for his reading.
