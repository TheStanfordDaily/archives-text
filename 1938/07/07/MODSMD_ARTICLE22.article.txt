# Bailey Willis To Read In Father's Play
## 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis, Stanford's
eminent geologist and emeritus pro
fessor, will read the part of the Duke
in his father's play, "Tortesa, the
Usurer," to be presented as the sec
ond in the Dramatist's series tonight
at Bo'clock in Room 100, Inner
Quad.
The galloping action of the play
is concerned with the interesting
triangle of stern parent, timid love,
and gold, providing great opportu
nity for sudden revelations, violent
reversals of feeling, situations
which Shakespeare has proved de
pendable, and speeches surcharged
with passions of all sorts.
Written in 1839 by N. P. Willis,
the romance oddly enough echoes
the modern demand for social sig
nificance, since the villain forces his
gilded hand upon the lovely heroine
as a means of asserting the power of
the common man over one of the 60
families of his province.
By showing what Victorian Amer
ica demanded in the way of romantic
comedy and bravura acting, "Tor
tesa, the Usurer" serves to intro
duce the summer season of American
drama.
