# Enrolment Soars To New Heights
## 
### 
Summer Quarter registration lifted
itself out of its depression slump
with a total enrolment to date of
950, 189 more than last year at this
same time. There are also 77 special
students, about the same number as
last year.
The greatest increases came in the
Graduate School of Business, the
Department of Education, the De
partment of Chemistry, and the
School of Social Sciences. One of
the big factors in this rise is the
fact that there are 106 new under
graduate women registered, which
is an increase over previous years.
Dr. Sellards, Summer Quarter di
rector, attributed the increase to
four general channels: This marked
increase in undergraduate women,
the increased offerings of the Grad
uate School of Business, the De
partment of Chemistry, and the
presence here on the campus of the
Roth Quartet.
Five experimental stations to pro
mote the development of Alaska are
maintained there by the U. S. De
partment of Agriculture.
