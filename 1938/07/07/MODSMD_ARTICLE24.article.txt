# Roth Quartet Scores Again
## 
### JIM STONE 
Continuing their series of Wed
nesday afternoon concerts, the Roth
Quartet presented a program of
Bach, Bartok, and Wolf before a
large audience yesterday.
Opening, as before, with "The Art
of Fugue," the string ensemble
played parts V-VIII of this last
work of Bach. The Quartet met the
increasing complexity of the fugual
mosaic with smooth dexterity of
phrasing which brought out the full
intellectual and emotional scope of
the work.
Traveling ahead to contemporary
music, the group performed Bar
tok's Quartet No. 1. From the bit
ter-sweet dissonences of the Lento,
to the capricious Allegro of the last
movement, the modern score was
made palatable to even the most
conservative ears. To the rest, it
was perhaps the high point of the
afternoon.
Hugh Wolf's "Italian Serenade"
concluded the program, putting a
sugar coat on the pill of dissonance
which was presented just before.
Next Monday night, the quartet
opens its series of four evening
concerts, with the asistance of guest
artists. On the first program are
the Haydn Quartet in D; a modern
work by Casella; and Franck's Piano
Quintet, with E. Robert Schmitz as
sisting.
