# Mumford Warns Modern Society of Dangers
## Author Discusses American Culture 
### 
"Our society is In a state of dangerous disequilibrium," warned Lewis
Mumford, author and lecturer, in his address, "Science and Technics in
American Culture," to the Education Conference in Memorial Hall last
night. "The age of the one-sided pioneer is passing: the age of integra
tion, settlement lies before us.
"The plainest symptom of this disintegration is in the recurrence during
the last generation of deliberate, systematic barbarism, not only in totali-

■carian states, out m large patcnes or
so-called democratic communities, a
barbarism accompanied by contempt
for intelligence, a glorification of
the brutal and irrational, an aban
donment of objective science."
Of the mechanization of American
society, the emphasis upon indus
trialization with the human element
is being considered secondarily, if
at all, Mr. Mumford said, "In the
effort to achieve, by this new means,
a mastery of the physical world, hu
man interests were disregarded and
belittled unless they submitted to
quantitative analysis. As a result,
the immediate gain in mechanical
efficiency was immense, but the or
der that was created was a one
sided and partial one. To under
stand the immediate task of science
in our own day, we must realize
how much of the real complex uni
verse the seventeenth century sci
entists emptied out of their scheme,
with its practical short-cuts, its too
facile simplifications."
Early Scientist
The early scientist was not alone
in his scientific approach to prob
lems, Mr. Mumford explained. The
merchant, the soldier, the mechanic
pursued in their own way the same
methods and concentrated upon a
similar type of experience. Out «f
this search for order the methodical
man admired by Benjamin Franklin
came into being.
"The machine has become a sym
bol of this new order; and rightly
so," the speaker continued. "The
emphasis upon impersonality, regu
larity, efficiency, and an inhuman
capacity for repetition and perfec
tion crystalizes a whole world out
look.
Desire for Power
"The machine is the outcome of a
deliberate human desire for power:
for power even at the sacrifice of
life. The impersonal order achieved
by science has been in the past as
sociated with one aspect of human
personality, the desire to master ex
ternal environment and control by
mechanical discipline the actions of
other men.
"When we dream about the fu
ture of technics," Mr. Mumford ex
plained, "we think lazily in terms
of widening the province of mech
anism. But our triumphs in mechan
ization have taught us that every
other part of the environment must
experience a similar discipline if
the machine itself is to be a bless
ing rather than a curse."
Machine Worship
This point was enlarged upon fur
ther when Mr. Mumford demon
strated that modern worship of the
machine has resulted in the pur
chase of machines even when sacri
fices were necessary in order to do
so, and that, while this was true,
the home, where human relation
ships in living are carried on, has
suffered and is "a sour caricature of
human environment."
Of the modern conception of
time, the speaker remarked, "By
treating time purely as a mechan
ical process, in which speed is a de
sirable end in itself, we have per
haps lost as much in human satis
faction as we have gained in pro
ductive output."
Need of Leisure
"Time-saving without the leisure
to live more extensively in the past,
through memory, reflection, and his
tory, and more extensively in the
future, through plan, forecast, and
anticipation — time-saving without
these accompaniments is a meaning
less futility—a deliberate shrinking
of life," he told his audience.
Through speed of communication,
the contraction of space through
transportation speed, the world has
been brought back, in one sense, to
its starting point, "where social in
tercourses take place by voice to
voice and face to face contact." So
ciety must, Mr. Mumford stated, re
alize that the underlying facts of
personality have not changed, and
in achieving power to diminish space
and multiply the number of neigh
bors a person has, men have not yet
increasing by moral discipline and
intellectual preparation the ability
really to command these new possi
bilities for social intercourse.
Rational Excuse
"The rational excuse for labor
saving is not that it increases profit,"
he pointed out, "but that, for the
same expenditure of energy, it frees
time for other activities, thus leisure

becomes potentially the possession,
not of a privileged class of renters
or beggars, but of an entire com
munity."
What scientific research will con
tribute to society through its atten
tion to biology, psychology, and bio
chemistry will be more in the na
ture of information about living than
in furthering the power of men over
machines.
In closing, Mr. Mumford empha
sized the fact that specialization in
science, to the exclusion of the hu
manities and knowledge of how to
live a full life, is passing as Amer
ican culture and society pass into
the new period of settlement, of
social integration and correlation
which lies before them.
Robert Swain was chairman of
the session; Fred Anibal and Louis
Wirth led the discussion which fol
lowed the speaker's address.
