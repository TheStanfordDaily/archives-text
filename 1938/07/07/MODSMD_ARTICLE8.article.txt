# Mumford Warns Modern Society of Dangers
## Author Discusses American Culture 
### 
"Our society is In a state of dangerous disequilibrium," warned Lewis
Mumford, author and lecturer, in his address, "Science and Technics in
American Culture," to the Education Conference in Memorial Hall last
night. "The age of the one-sided pioneer is passing: the age of integra
tion, settlement lies before us.
"The plainest symptom of this disintegration is in the recurrence during
the last generation of deliberate, systematic barbarism, not only in totali-

■carian states, out m large patcnes or
so-called democratic communities, a
barbarism accompanied by contempt
for intelligence, a glorification of
the brutal and irrational, an aban
donment of objective science."
Of the mechanization of American
society, the emphasis upon indus
trialization with the human element
is being considered secondarily, if
at all, Mr. Mumford said, "In the
effort to achieve, by this new means,
a mastery of the physical world, hu
man interests were disregarded and
belittled unless they submitted to
quantitative analysis. As a result,
the immediate gain in mechanical
efficiency was immense, but the or
der that was created was a one
sided and partial one. To under
stand the immediate task of science
in our own day, we must realize
how much of the real complex uni
verse the seventeenth century sci
entists emptied out of their scheme,
with its practical short-cuts, its too
facile simplifications."
Early Scientist
The early scientist was not alone
in his scientific approach to prob
lems, Mr. Mumford explained. The
merchant, the soldier, the mechanic
pursued in their own way the same
methods and concentrated upon a
similar type of experience. Out «f
this search for order the methodical
man admired by Benjamin Franklin
came into being.
"The machine has become a sym
bol of this new order; and rightly
so," the speaker continued. "The
emphasis upon impersonality, regu
larity, efficiency, and an inhuman
capacity for repetition and perfec
tion crystalizes a whole world out
look.
Desire for Power
"The machine is the outcome of a
deliberate human desire for power:
for power even at the sacrifice of
life. The impersonal order achieved
by science has been in the past as
sociated with one aspect of human
personality, the desire to master ex
ternal environment and control by
mechanical discipline the actions of
other men.
