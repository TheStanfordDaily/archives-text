### 
Setting the keynote of the Confer
ence on Social Education which
opened yesterday afternoon with a
general session in Memorial Hall,
Dr. Paul R. Hanna indicated that
the task of education is to serve as a
laboratory in which the culture is
examined for ways of improving it.
Dr. Hanna stated that our society
has changed from an agricultural
one to an industrial one, but we are
forced to operate under standards
and institutions designed for a prior
culture. Education, he believes, is
not confined to the schools, but, he
concluded, "the problems immedi
ately confronting us in public schools
is that of selecting for learning,
those experiences which will con
tribute to this central task of edu
cation for social transition."
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, head
of the history department, stated at
the opening session of the confer
ence, that, because our heritage is
one of social and economic democ
racy, the United States will find it
comparatively easy to maintain its
political democracy.
