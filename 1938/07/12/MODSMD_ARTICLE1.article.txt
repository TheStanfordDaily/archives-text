# Educators Told To Fit Children For New Order
## Dr. Kilpatrick Brings Teachers' Conclave To Close Sunday 
### 
Emphasizing the need for educa
tion to prepare the child to meet
problems of a changing society, the
Conference on Social Education
came to an end with two general
assemblies on Sunday morning
The sole purpose of teacher con
trol is to make more freedom for the
student, Dr. William H. Kilpatrick,
acting professor of education, told
visiting educators. Speaking on
"Teacher Control and Student
Freedom," Dr. Kilpatrick said, "It
is easy to see how the teacher may
err on one side or another; either
too much control in guidance, or
too little and ineffective guidance is
often present." Student freedom, Dr.
Kilpatrick said, means primarily the
opportunity to live and to grow.
Chaplin Speaks
"Real study is one activity in
which one cannot completely fail,"
Dr. Kilpatrick asserted. The use of
controversial issues must be en
couraged, and these issues should be
taught as disputable.
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, Univer
sity chaplain, addressed the final
general session in the Memorial
Church at 11 o'clock Sunday morn
ing. He spoke on "Religion in
American Culture."
Teach children to think creatively
and act co-operatively in the face
of rapidly changing conditions was
the challenge to education voiced by
I. James Quillen, assistant profes
sor of education, at the general ses
sion Saturday morning.
Friday Session
Speaking on "An Educational
Philosophy Basic to Social Educa
tion" at the Friday morning session,
Dr. Kilpatrick offered eight essen
tial principles of educational philos
ophy. Among these were: person
ality as such should be cherished
equally in all men; democracy is
necessary for education because it
proposes to respect personality and
intelligence; and free play of in
telligence is man's final resource â€”
education frees him from prejudices.
Striking a rather pessimistic note,
Dr. William F. Ogburn, from the
University of Chicago and director
of research for President Hoover's
Committee on Social Trends, stated
that something, but not very much,
can be done in the control of so
cial change. In his conference ad
dress on Thursday morning, Dr.
Ogburn indicated that society may
best be adjusted to changing tech
nology through the anticipation of
new inventions and the analysis of
their probable social influences.
Karl W. Bigelow urged teachers
at a Thursday afternoon forum to

enter into as many of the community
activities as possible and to get rid of
the prevalent feeling that they nec
essarily have to assume leadership
in these functions.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's speech
on "The Extent and Use of Natural
Resources" was delivered at the
fourth general session of the Con
ference Thursday night by means of
phonograph records.
