"It is a beautiful idea that Stanford University is in the country. In
Furope the univeristies are in cirics." This is one of the many things about
the United States that delights Mine. Suzanne Charlier-Tassier, history
instructor of the University of Brussels and wife of Dr. Gustave Charlier,
literature professor at Brussels and acting professor of Romanic Languages

at Stanford for the Summer Quar-<
ter.
Mme. Charlier-Tassier, who is do
ing research in the Hoover War
Library, specializes in the history of
the eighteenth century, having writ
ten tWv/ books on the subject: "Les
Democrates Beiges de 1789" and
Histoire de la Belgique sous l'Oc
cupation Francaise en 1792 et 1793."
Mme. Charlier-Tassier, who is
living this summer in the French
House, gave the first in a series of
lectures in French Thursday af
ternoon. Her subject was "L'En
seignement en France et en Belgi
que." Next Thursday she will
speak on "La Femme en France et
en Belgique." The lectures, which
are given in the French House
(Manzanita), are open to all persons
interested.
"You in the United States have
done many beautiful things in what
we call 'urbanisme'—the science of
building beautiful towns," Mme.
Charlier-Tassier observed.
First Visit Here
This is her first trip to America.
When she speaks of the United
States, the predominating word in

her descriptions is "splendid,"
which she applies to American roads,
libraries, buildings, and the Grand
Canyon.
"You have such large landscape in
your country," she remarked in
adequate and charming — though
strongly accented—English. "In Eu
rope the countries are so small," she
pointed out, marvelling that she and
her husband had traveled for a
week continuously in this country
without having to show their "pa
pers." "In Europe we would have
had to show them 20 or 30 times in
a trip of similar length," she de
clared.
"Your deserts made a deep im
pression on me," she stated, de
scribing their colors as "lovely," go
ing on to say that most European
books concerning the United States
give the "wrong idea" of the
country.
Commencement Impresses
Mme. Charlier-Tassier also was
much impressed by Stanford com
mencement exercises in the Lau
rence Frost Memorial Amphitheater.
"•It makes a good impression. It is a
poetical idea that is symbolical,"
she observed.
"You have created a new kind of
beauty in architecture," she ob
served, making special reference to
the gigantic new bridges in San
Francisco and in New York, which
she admires for their beautiful sim
plicity.
Business men giving money to fur
ther the arts and education seems
to Mme. Charlier-Tassier a pecu
liarly American trait which she
much admires.

done many beautiful things in what
we call 'urbanisme'—the science of
building beautiful towns," Mme.
Charlier-Tassier observed.
First Visit Here
This is her first trip to America.
When she speaks of the United
States, the predominating word in

her descriptions is "splendid,"
which she applies to American roads,
libraries, buildings, and the Grand
Canyon.
"You have such large landscape in
your country," she remarked in
adequate and charming — though
strongly accented—English. "In Eu
rope the countries are so small," she
pointed out, marvelling that she and
her husband had traveled for a
week continuously in this country

had to show them 20 or 30 times in
a trip of similar length," she de
clared.
