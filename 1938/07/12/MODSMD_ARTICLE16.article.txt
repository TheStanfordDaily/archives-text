# Prune Pickers Trounce Eagles In Tie Play-off
## Teams Enter Third Round; Accordians Take Hard Victory 
### VARICK MARTIN 
Because of the Education Confer
ences no baseball was scheduled in
the Old Sour-Puss League. How
ever, members of the Prune Pick
er and Legal Eagle teams took time
out from educational pursuits to
play off their previous tie game.
The game was a massacre. The
Pickers sent everyone to bat four
or five times, even some of the
players' wives, and when the whole
orgy was over the Eagles were on
the very short end of an 18 to 8
score.
In a practice tilt the Accordians,
a muchly trampled-on cellar team,
eked out a 14 to 7 victory over the
poor excuse for a ball team, the
Cardinals. Eversmiling "Pa" Ken
nedy stood out for the winners
with three magnificent strike-outs in
three times at bat.
The teams move into the third
round of play today. The Slave
Drivers will have no trouble in
making mince-meat of the Wildcats,
while the Outlaws should best the
Vantors. The Legal Eagles should
blindfold themselves when they play
the Cardinals in order to even the
match. Even with "Pa" Kennedy
getting a hit the Accordians could
n't hope to get within sneezing dis
tance. The Prune-Pickers will
completely overwhelm the Vultures,
while the game between the Bush
men and El Toro should be a toss
up.
