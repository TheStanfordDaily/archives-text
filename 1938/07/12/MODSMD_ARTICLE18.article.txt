### LYNNE ASHTON 
Dear Boss:
The idea for that column is no
nearer than it was. Perhaps the
over-capacity-load of mental stimu
lation last week (there was a con
ference, remember?) was too many
for me.
What happens, anyway, Boss, to
the ideas set loose when people get
together like that? Everywhere I
saw groups of people in huddles,
fighting out some point brought up
by one speaker or another, and in
some cases (knowing the people) I
know perfectly well each person de
parted with his original little brain
child clutched to his bosom. Par
ents are often over-proud of little
Junior, whom all the neighbors
know is a brat!
Anyway, someday I'm going to call
a conference, too. And I'm going to
get speakers, and panel-discussers.
But I'm not going to stop there. I'm
going to serve beer and pretzels and
invite the audience to practice some
of this progressive education in 'bull
sessions'. College would lose its
best aspect if bull sessions were out
lawed; and how the fur does fly if
men who know their facts and their
authorities sit in!
I know these people come here
for six days and try to cover the
world, but it seems to me the
conclave might better have lasted
five days, or seven, because being
six, there was too much similarity
to a six-day bicycle race. 'Round
and round she goes; and where
she stops, nobody knows.' Unfor
tunately, no one was empowered
to ring a gong.
When I was in grammar school
(and had to learn discipline from a
graduate of the castor-oil school of
thinkers), I used to ask a lot of un
popular whys. The word is still one
of my favorites—perhaps you could
supply the answers:
"Why go to such lengths finding
out what the 'whole child' should
have in such detail — food, love,
training, stimulation of principles
and interest, and all the rest—when
getting these things for more children
is so much needed? I mean, young
teachers learn what Lizzie and Henry
need, yes; but do young teachers
learn what they can do most ef

fectively to help Lizzie and Henry
get them, when they are beyond the
power of one individual to give?
"Why do teachers stand quietly
by and watch ccrtain boards of
education pursue certain policies
for the interests of the builders,
the property owners, the few,
when the most needed policy is a
closer relationship between the
parents and teachers, again at the
teachers' instigation? (How many
teachers look upon P.T.A. meet
ings as necessary evils, where one
sips tea and tells Mrs. Schmaltz
why little Adolph is not doing so
well in his Algebra?)
"Why do teachers not know more
about their community, the office
holders and seekers, and do more
than tsk-tsk when a local merchant,
say, (who stopped school with the
eighth grade) guides the purse and
destinies of their community? 'It's
criminal, that's what it is,' they say,
and continue to worry—about how
to save enough to get to Europe
next summer."
You see, Boss, I can ask questions
like that—and some of them more
embarrassing, if you like, but I do
not know the answers. I do not
know just what explosive or roman
candle to set off under these people
to hint delicately that their place
of work, a school, is not a monas
tery, not an Ivory Tower, but a
place to learn. And if you have
ever seen Teech out on a picnic
where little Oswald in 6A has had
to show her how to build a fire, or
tell stories, or find names for the
flora and fauna of the region, you
ought to know why it is werry,
werry funny to have Teech "tell
ing them, and them listenin' so
quiet-like."
When you look back on your
school years, Boss, what do you
remember most—besides the un
pleasant things? You remember,
I'll wager, the two or three out
standing men and women who
were, in the truest sense, teachers.
They were wise, weren't they?
They found out what you were
interested in and tried to make it
a PPIy to the course they had to
' teach—or cncouragcd you to learn
I something no one else had ever

been able to get you interested in.
Are they born, not made, these
teachers? Maybe. But whatever is
the true picture, those who came for
the conference alone have taken
their own ideas away from Stan
ford, and heaven and the future
alone can tell just what the little
'guides to action' will make their
possesors do. Water runs under
bridges, and has for some time. It
runs uphill—and with tremendous
weight and force when it's in a pipe,
going somewhere definite. I know,
Boss; you're going to say, "So what?"
So do I.

of my favorites—perhaps you could
supply the answers:
"Why go to such lengths finding
out what the 'whole child' should
have in such detail — food, love,
training, stimulation of principles
and interest, and all the rest—when
getting these things for more children
is so much needed? I mean, young
teachers learn what Lizzie and Henry
need, yes; but do young teachers
learn what they can do most ef

fectively to help Lizzie and Henry
get them, when they are beyond the
power of one individual to give?
"Why do teachers stand quietly
by and watch ccrtain boards of
education pursue certain policies
for the interests of the builders,
the property owners, the few,
when the most needed policy is a
closer relationship between the
parents and teachers, again at the
teachers' instigation? (How many
teachers look upon P.T.A. meet
ings as necessary evils, where one
sips tea and tells Mrs. Schmaltz
why little Adolph is not doing so
well in his Algebra?)
"Why do teachers not know more
about their community, the office
holders and seekers, and do more
than tsk-tsk when a local merchant,
say, (who stopped school with the
eighth grade) guides the purse and
destinies of their community? 'It's
criminal, that's what it is,' they say,
and continue to worry—about how
to save enough to get to Europe
next summer."
You see, Boss, I can ask questions
like that—and some of them more
embarrassing, if you like, but I do
not know the answers. I do not
know just what explosive or roman
candle to set off under these people
to hint delicately that their place
of work, a school, is not a monas
tery, not an Ivory Tower, but a
place to learn. And if you have
ever seen Teech out on a picnic
where little Oswald in 6A has had
to show her how to build a fire, or
tell stories, or find names for the
flora and fauna of the region, you
ought to know why it is werry,
werry funny to have Teech "tell
ing them, and them listenin' so
quiet-like."
When you look back on your
school years, Boss, what do you
remember most—besides the un
pleasant things? You remember,
I'll wager, the two or three out
standing men and women who
were, in the truest sense, teachers.
They were wise, weren't they?
They found out what you were
interested in and tried to make it
a PPIy to the course they had to
' teach—or cncouragcd you to learn
I something no one else had ever

been able to get you interested in.
Are they born, not made, these
teachers? Maybe. But whatever is
the true picture, those who came for
the conference alone have taken
their own ideas away from Stan
ford, and heaven and the future
alone can tell just what the little
'guides to action' will make their
possesors do. Water runs under
bridges, and has for some time. It
runs uphill—and with tremendous
weight and force when it's in a pipe,
going somewhere definite. I know,
Boss; you're going to say, "So what?"
So do I.
Dear Boss:
The idea for that column is no
nearer than it was. Perhaps the
over-capacity-load of mental stimu
lation last week (there was a con
ference, remember?) was too many
for me.
What happens, anyway, Boss, to
the ideas set loose when people get
together like that? Everywhere I
saw groups of people in huddles,
fighting out some point brought up
by one speaker or another, and in
some cases (knowing the people) I
know perfectly well each person de
parted with his original little brain
child clutched to his bosom. Par
ents are often over-proud of little
Junior, whom all the neighbors
know is a brat!
Anyway, someday I'm going to call
a conference, too. And I'm going to
get speakers, and panel-discussers.
But I'm not going to stop there. I'm
going to serve beer and pretzels and
invite the audience to practice some
of this progressive education in 'bull
sessions'. College would lose its
best aspect if bull sessions were out
lawed; and how the fur does fly if
men who know their facts and their
authorities sit in!
I know these people come here
for six days and try to cover the
world, but it seems to me the
conclave might better have lasted
five days, or seven, because being
six, there was too much similarity
to a six-day bicycle race. 'Round
and round she goes; and where
she stops, nobody knows.' Unfor
tunately, no one was empowered
to ring a gong.

tery, not an Ivory Tower, but a
place to learn. And if you have
ever seen Teech out on a picnic
where little Oswald in 6A has had
to show her how to build a fire, or
tell stories, or find names for the
flora and fauna of the region, you
ought to know why it is werry,
werry funny to have Teech "tell
ing them, and them listenin' so
quiet-like."
When you look back on your
school years, Boss, what do you
remember most—besides the un
pleasant things? You remember,
I'll wager, the two or three out
standing men and women who
were, in the truest sense, teachers.
They were wise, weren't they?
They found out what you were
interested in and tried to make it
a PPIy to the course they had to
' teach—or cncouragcd you to learn
I something no one else had ever

been able to get you interested in.
Are they born, not made, these
teachers? Maybe. But whatever is
the true picture, those who came for
the conference alone have taken
their own ideas away from Stan
ford, and heaven and the future
alone can tell just what the little
'guides to action' will make their
possesors do. Water runs under
bridges, and has for some time. It
runs uphill—and with tremendous
weight and force when it's in a pipe,
going somewhere definite. I know,
Boss; you're going to say, "So what?"
So do I.
Dear Boss:
The idea for that column is no
nearer than it was. Perhaps the
over-capacity-load of mental stimu
lation last week (there was a con
ference, remember?) was too many
for me.
What happens, anyway, Boss, to
the ideas set loose when people get
together like that? Everywhere I
saw groups of people in huddles,
fighting out some point brought up
by one speaker or another, and in
some cases (knowing the people) I
know perfectly well each person de
parted with his original little brain
child clutched to his bosom. Par
ents are often over-proud of little
Junior, whom all the neighbors
know is a brat!
Anyway, someday I'm going to call
a conference, too. And I'm going to
get speakers, and panel-discussers.
But I'm not going to stop there. I'm
going to serve beer and pretzels and
invite the audience to practice some
of this progressive education in 'bull
sessions'. College would lose its
best aspect if bull sessions were out
lawed; and how the fur does fly if
men who know their facts and their
authorities sit in!
I know these people come here
for six days and try to cover the
world, but it seems to me the
conclave might better have lasted
five days, or seven, because being
six, there was too much similarity
to a six-day bicycle race. 'Round
and round she goes; and where
she stops, nobody knows.' Unfor
tunately, no one was empowered
to ring a gong.
When I was in grammar school
(and had to learn discipline from a
graduate of the castor-oil school of
thinkers), I used to ask a lot of un
popular whys. The word is still one
of my favorites—perhaps you could
supply the answers:
"Why go to such lengths finding
out what the 'whole child' should
have in such detail — food, love,
training, stimulation of principles
and interest, and all the rest—when
getting these things for more children
is so much needed? I mean, young
teachers learn what Lizzie and Henry
need, yes; but do young teachers
learn what they can do most ef

fectively to help Lizzie and Henry
get them, when they are beyond the
power of one individual to give?
"Why do teachers stand quietly
by and watch ccrtain boards of
education pursue certain policies
for the interests of the builders,
the property owners, the few,
when the most needed policy is a
closer relationship between the
parents and teachers, again at the
teachers' instigation? (How many
teachers look upon P.T.A. meet
ings as necessary evils, where one
sips tea and tells Mrs. Schmaltz
why little Adolph is not doing so
well in his Algebra?)
"Why do teachers not know more
about their community, the office
holders and seekers, and do more
than tsk-tsk when a local merchant,
say, (who stopped school with the
eighth grade) guides the purse and
destinies of their community? 'It's
criminal, that's what it is,' they say,
and continue to worry—about how
to save enough to get to Europe
next summer."
You see, Boss, I can ask questions
like that—and some of them more
embarrassing, if you like, but I do
not know the answers. I do not
know just what explosive or roman
candle to set off under these people
to hint delicately that their place
of work, a school, is not a monas
tery, not an Ivory Tower, but a
place to learn. And if you have
