# Play Reading Wins Acclaim

### KATHARINE PAGE 
"Tortesa the Usurer," a romantic
drama in verse, was presented here
last Thursday night as the second
in a group of play readings by the
Dramatists.
Typical of early Victorian taste, it
follows closely the pattern of
Shakespeare's romantic comedies.
By making the mainspring of his
plot not love, but the bitter strug
gle between inherited privilege and
natural endowment, Willis succeeds
partially in reviving the stale mate
rial; but he, too, succumbed to the
common dramatic weakness of his
time: that of character depiction and
motivation. The comic part of the
servant, however, was widely ap
preciated by the audience.
If the plot and characters were
typical, the dramatic verse with its
energetic cadence and rippling nor
mality of phrasing was far above
that of the dramatist's contempo
raries.
Probably the greatest interest of
all for the Stanford audience was
Dr. Willis who read capably the
part of the Duke in his father's play.
Others in the group were Dorothy
Tully as Isabella, Myna Hughes as

er's page; Joseph Whitaker as An
gelo, Harry Jones as Falcone, George
Wilson as Tomaso, Glenn Reed as
the Counsellor, and Mr. Robert
Cathcart as Tortesa.
