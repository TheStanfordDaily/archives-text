Congratulations to Director Wells
and the cast of Springtime for Henry
for their flawless production of a
thoroughly enjoyable fast-moving
comedy. The studio style of pres
entation lent an air of intimacy that
night otherwise have not been ob
tained. Olive Krauthoff's poise,
Janet Dole's naturalness, Joe Law
ry's consistency, and Ernest Men
denhall's characterization of a re
formed roue were the highlights of
the performance.
