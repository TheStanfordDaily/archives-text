### LEE CHAPIN 
(Editor's Note: Dr. Chapin, on
leave from Stanford last year, re
ceived the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy from the University of
Edinburgh in June, 1938.)
In 1583, the citizens of Edinburgh,
annoyed by the harsh treatment
which Scotsmen received at Oxford,
and concerned with the worldly at
mosphere of the Continental Uni
versities, organized a "Towne Col
lege." Soon the university received
the support of the king, and was
called "Acadamecia Jacobi Sexti" by
Robert Rollock, the first principal
(president), who was bound by con
tract to speak to students in Latin,
even at tea-time.
The constitution of the University
of Edinburgh is a most complicated
document. The University is a cor
poration, consisting of a chancellor,
of a vice-chancellor, of a Lord Rec
tor, of a principal (president), of
professors, of registered graduates,
and of matriculated students. This
corporation is known as the Gen
eral Council. This year the General
Council held two elections. Lord
Tweedsmuir, the governor general
of Canada, was elected chancellor of
the university, filling the vacancy
caused by the death of the former
chancellor, the late Sir James Bar
rie. The second election was for a
member of Parliament, to succeed
the late Rt. Hon. J. Ramsay Mac
donald, who had been the universi
ty's representative in Parliament
during the last few years.
The Edinburgh University student
is an individualist. He does not
understand why Americans talk so
much about "student body spirit."
In the early days the students
brought a sack of oatmeal from his
home and prepared his meals in
"digs." Every month there would
be a Meal Monday Holiday, when
the student would return to his
home for another sack of oatmeal.
Edinburgh is still known as "the
city of pride and poverty," and the
great majority of students still live
in "digs." Meal Monday is still a

university holiday. Last year a large
sum of money was left the univer
sity for the purpose of building
dormitories and developing the cor
porate spirit. The students have
shown little enthusiasm for the
group plan of living. They prefer
to remain intellectual individualists.
Many of the students study in
France or Germany during the
summer months. The classical schol
ars often spend some of their time
in Greece. Many English students
who cannot afford Oxford and Cam
bridge matriculate at Edinburgh.
Three graduates of the University
of Edinburgh, Rush, Wilson, and
Witherspoon, signed the American
Declaration of Independence. Among
the class rolls can be found such
names as Oliver Goldsmith, Thomas
Carlyle, and Robert Louis Steven
son. For over three hundred and
fifty years the university has held a
particularly prominent place in the
British educational system, and has
attracted students from India, South
Africa, Canada, and other distant
parts of the British Empire.
