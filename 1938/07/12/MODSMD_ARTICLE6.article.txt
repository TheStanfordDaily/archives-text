# Cast Selected For Stevens' Western Play
## Janet Dole, Jack Gillis Will Star in 'Camille Of Roaring Camp' 
### 
Except for the small parts, the
final cast for "Camille of Roaring
Camp" has been selected and re
hearsals are in full swing, accord
ing to Chester W. Barker, speech and
drama secretary.
"Camille" will be presented in
the Memorial Theater July 21, 22
and 23.
The swashbuckling comedy, writ
en and directed by Thomas Wood
Stevens, combines the wheezing old
stage tragedy, "Camille," with the
setting of Bret Harte's "Roaring
Camp." A road show company pre
sents this tattered tear-jerker in the
incongruous surroundings of a
western saloon. Unexpected action,
typical of the booming West, but
frighteningly new to the uninitiated
traveling company, roughens the
progress of the beer-house produc
tion and promises to keep Mr. Stev
ens' play a laugh riot.
Janet Dole, blonde star of many
campus shows, plays the part of
Camille. Her languishing lover, Mr.
Keen, is played by Jack Gillis. The
part of John Oakhurst, Bret Harte's
smooth gambler, is taken by Bill
Lucas, while Bud Cady of electric
razor fame plays Mr. Clifford. Hu
bert Staffelbach acts the pompous
character of Col. Starbottle.
Other members of the cast include
Miriam Reinhart, Carl Diesenroth,
Aubrey Austin, Walter Brash, Rob
ert Doerr, Ten Hatlen, Paul Crary,
Vergil Bergman, Joe Whitaker,
Shirley Jones, John Hove, Harriet
Touton, George Campbell, and Ted
Curtis.
Tickets for "Camille of Roaring
Camp" are on sale in Mr. Barker's
office, 205 M, at 50 cents, 75 cents,
and $1. Season tickets may also be
secured from him at three shows
for the price of two.
Most of the cast for "Uncle Tom's
Cabin," which will be presented
August 4, 5, and 6, has also been se
lected. Barrel-voiced J. P. Cahn
will play Uncle Tom, Nina Jean Heb
erer will take the part of Eva and
Harriet Touton will flee across the
ice as Eliza. Vergil Bergman is
practicing whip-cracking in order to
make a convincingly nasty Simon
Legree, while Shirley Jones, star of
the Spring Show, "Is Europe?" will
blacken up and drop her R's as
Topsy. H. Miles Heberer will direct
| "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
