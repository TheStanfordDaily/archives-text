# Austrian Film Shows Famed Vienna Choir
## 
### 
"An Orphan Boy in Vienna," a
recent Austrian film, will be shown
at the Memorial Theater tonight at
8 o'clock as the third in the series of
Tuesday evening programs spon
sored by the Committee on Public
Exercises.
Depicting the adventures of an or
phan boy adopted by a wandering
street singer, the film brings to the
American screen one of the best of
the foreign musical pictures.
Toni, the homeless waif, is be
friended by Hans Olden, the street
singer who, when he finds the boy
has a remarkable singing voice, con
trives to get him into the famous
Sangerknaben choir. Toni's adven
tures with his new friends in Vi
enna and the Tyrolean Alps, his
finding a warm maternal devotion
in Sister Maria, and his exoneration
from a suspected theft in which he
has accidentally been implicated, all
provide an unflaggingly humorous
and dramatic foundation for the su
perb music and photography which
embellish the film.
Although the dialogue is in Ger
man, the English subtitles make the
film perfectly understandable, ac
cording to the New York critics who
reviewed it recently.
The critics praised the Vienna
Choir Boys and the performance of
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra,
which they say furnishes excellent
musical accompaniment. They also
credit Max Neufield and Hans Thay
er for their excellent direction and
photography.
