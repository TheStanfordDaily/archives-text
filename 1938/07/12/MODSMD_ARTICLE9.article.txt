On Lasuen Street, next to the li
brary, a many-windowed, cofTee
with-cream colored building is be
ing constructed. This structure, gift
of Stanford's investment-wise edu
cator, Dean Emeritus Ellwood P.
Cubberley ,is a symbol of progress
on the Stanford campus.
No less a symbol of progress were
the 1938 Stanford Education Con
ferences, held under the auspices of
the School of Education, which
ended Sunday morning after six
days of sessions.
This year's summer gathering of
educators, the sixth since the meet
ings were originated in 1932 by pro
gressive Dean Grayson N. Kefauver,
head of the School of Education, dif
fered from previous sessions in that
two short, conferences rather than
one long one were held. The Con
ference on Early Childhood Educa
tion, commemorating the one-hun-

dredth anniversary of the founding
of the kindergarten, and the Con
ference on Social Education, which
drew such famed participants as
Lewis Mumford, lecturer and author
of "The Culture of Cities" and
"Technics of Civilization," and Wil
liam Heard Kilpatrick, Columbia's
able educator, were attended by
well over a thousand persons.
Once a year American doctors
gather at a meeting of the Ameri
can Medical Association to exchange
ideas, to learn of advances in the
field of medicine, to be sociable. In
essence the Stanford Education
Conferences serve a similar purpose
for western school teachers. Each
year the conferences take up a new
and particularly important phase of
the total educational program, and
so, by spending one week each sum
mer on the Stanford campus, teach
ers are able to keep abreast of new

developments in education—a field
which today is undergoing rapid in
ternal changes.
The Stanford Education Confer
ences are in keeping with the phi
losophy of the School of Education.
This philosophy is an advanced one,
based on the ideas that education is
an extremely complex field requir
ing extensive training, that educa
tion should be "functional" and
should train the child in a realistic
maner for the realities of life.
This philosophy holds that teach
ing should be directed toward seek
ing out the needs of the child and
aiding him to grow and to develop a
well-adjusted personality. In a
sense the summer meetings seek to
aid the development and growth of
teachers in a similar manner.
To the School of Education must go
a great deal of credit for a good
piece of constructive work.

The Stanford Education Confer

losophy of the School of Education.
This philosophy is an advanced one,
based on the ideas that education is
an extremely complex field requir
ing extensive training, that educa
tion should be "functional" and
should train the child in a realistic
maner for the realities of life.
This philosophy holds that teach
ing should be directed toward seek
ing out the needs of the child and
aiding him to grow and to develop a
well-adjusted personality. In a
sense the summer meetings seek to
aid the development and growth of
teachers in a similar manner.
To the School of Education must go
a great deal of credit for a good
piece of constructive work.

of Stanford's investment-wise edu

Cubberley ,is a symbol of progress
on the Stanford campus.
No less a symbol of progress were
the 1938 Stanford Education Con
ferences, held under the auspices of
the School of Education, which
ended Sunday morning after six
days of sessions.
This year's summer gathering of
educators, the sixth since the meet

head of the School of Education, dif

two short, conferences rather than
one long one were held. The Con

drew such famed participants as
Lewis Mumford, lecturer and author
of "The Culture of Cities" and
"Technics of Civilization," and Wil

able educator, were attended by
well over a thousand persons.
Once a year American doctors
gather at a meeting of the Ameri

ideas, to learn of advances in the
field of medicine, to be sociable. In

Conferences serve a similar purpose
