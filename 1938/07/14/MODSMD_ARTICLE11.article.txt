# Last Rites for John E. McDowell, Former Alumni Head, Held Here
## 
### BOB O'DAY 
Private services were held yesterday afternoon for John Ezra Mc-
Dowell, 66, retired Stanford executive. A man who literally knew all
other Stanford men, McDowell's passing was viewed with much grief
hy his associates and friends. Leland W. Cutler, president of the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees said:
"J. E. McDowell was my friend for over 35 years, and with other
Stanford men and women the world over, I will always miss him."

• Mr. McDowell died last Tuesday
morning after a short illness. On
June 29 he suffered a slight cere
bral hemorrhage, and a week later
suffered a more severe stroke, re
sulting in a coma from which he
never recovered.
The extent of McDowell's personal
acquaintances was tremendous. He
made it a point to know everybody
at Stanford, and it can truthfully be
said that he knew more Stanford
men and women than any other
alumnus.
Born in East
"Jack" McDowell, as he was af
fectionately called by his friends,
was born in Ashland, Ohio, gradu
ating from the high school there in
1891. He worked for four years in
Ashland before registering at Stan
ford, which was still in its first
decade. While an undergraduate, he
asissted in the Registrar's office,
where he began his great knowledge
of Stanford men and women. Grad
uating in 1900 with a degree in eco
nomics, he stepped immediately into
the position of assistant registrar of
the University. He remained in this
capacity for 19 years, becoming aca
demic secretary in 1919. Also in
1909, Mr. McDowell was elected sec
retary of the Stanford Alumni As
sociation, at which post he remained
until 1931. During the years 1910-
20, he filled the office of dean of
men. He retired from the faculty
only a year ago.
Widely Traveled
In his long connection with the
University, Mr. McDowell followed
the lives of Stanford men and wom
en from the time they matriculated.
He frequently made trips to all parts
of the country, and his presence al
ways brought new life into the Stan
ford club of that community. The
children of alumni became one of
his special interests and he took a
fatherly attitude toward them dur
ing their undergraduate days.
McDowell was the first student to
enter Stanford from Ashland, Ohio.
His great popularity here and in his
home town has brought over 50 stu
dents from the small Ohio town since
his matriculation. There is now a
scholarship bearing his name award
ed each year ot a graduate of Ash
land High School.
Family Survives
In 1906 Mr. McDowell married
Alice Nagel (Stanford '07) who sur
vives him. Also surviving are three
sons and two brothers, all but one
Stanford graduates. Mr. McDowell
was a member of the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity.
Robert A. Hamilton, successor to
McDowell as alumni secretary, made
the following statement:
"No alumnus ever loved Stanford
University better than Jack McDow
ell. He enjoyed the personal friend
ship of thousands of graduates and
former students through the many
years he served so well as alumni
secretary. We affectionately looked
to him as one tie binding all Stan
ford generations."
Speaking as acting president of
the University, Edgar E. Robinson
said:
"He lived in everything he did and,
as so often in the case of those who
give themselves in their work, he
had the affectionate regard of all
who knew him. He gave his days
and nights to Stanford University."
Books and documents contained in
the libraries of the University of
California now number over one
million.

Stanford graduates. Mr. McDowell
was a member of the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity.
Robert A. Hamilton, successor to
McDowell as alumni secretary, made
the following statement:
"No alumnus ever loved Stanford
University better than Jack McDow
ell. He enjoyed the personal friend
ship of thousands of graduates and
former students through the many
years he served so well as alumni
secretary. We affectionately looked
to him as one tie binding all Stan
ford generations."
Speaking as acting president of
the University, Edgar E. Robinson
said:
"He lived in everything he did and,
as so often in the case of those who
give themselves in their work, he
had the affectionate regard of all
who knew him. He gave his days
and nights to Stanford University."
Books and documents contained in
the libraries of the University of
California now number over one
million.
Private services were held yesterday afternoon for John Ezra Mc-
Dowell, 66, retired Stanford executive. A man who literally knew all
other Stanford men, McDowell's passing was viewed with much grief
hy his associates and friends. Leland W. Cutler, president of the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees said:
"J. E. McDowell was my friend for over 35 years, and with other
Stanford men and women the world over, I will always miss him."

• Mr. McDowell died last Tuesday
morning after a short illness. On
June 29 he suffered a slight cere
bral hemorrhage, and a week later
suffered a more severe stroke, re
sulting in a coma from which he
never recovered.
The extent of McDowell's personal
acquaintances was tremendous. He
made it a point to know everybody
at Stanford, and it can truthfully be
said that he knew more Stanford
men and women than any other
alumnus.
