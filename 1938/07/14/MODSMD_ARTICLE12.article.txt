CAN YOU DO A LITTLE "TIME
SPACING" and visit the following
before you leave California? Parks
and picnic sites: Yosemite, Big
Basin (only a short distance from the
University and a fine place for a
picnic and a natural history lesson.
The youngsters always like to see
the attendants feed the deer at 5
o'clock), Alum Rock Park near San
Jose with lovely big barbecue pits
and tables, merry-go-round and lots
of wide open spaces, Calaveras Big
Trees in the foothills of Calaveras
County, Marin County (across Gold
en Gate). Theaters: Clay Interna
tional in San Francisco, Federal
Theater Project at the Alcazar in
San Francisco. Eating meccas: A
Bit of Sweden, Russian Tea Room,
Swedish Applied Arts (reservations
required—delicious food, arts and
crafts, folk dancing in which every
one joins), all in San Francisco;
Ripley's Restaurant, a French res
taurant in Chinatown (believe it or
not), Brookdale Lodge near Boulder
Creew on the Skyline. Thrills: Drive
down the Powell Street hill in
San Francisco, ride the cable cars,
visit Golden Gate Park, swimming
pool and zoo, aquarium and muse
ums (be sure to take the kiddies
along, ages 1-100). LUNCHEONS
on Thursday give 228 souls a chance
to eat, think, see and be seen.
DOWN WITH ABILITY GROUP
ING! why not try sitting with some
one you don't know at the next
Thursday luncheon? WHAT do you
do with all the time you save rush
ing from the Library at 10 p.m.?
ROTH QUARTET CONCERT tick
ets may be obtained one week in
advance from the Public Exercises
Committee (office on balcony of ad
ministration building). If YOU need
a lift, get a thrill from meeting Mr.
Roth and then having him remem
ber you next time you see him.
When we told him that the quartet's
first names almost made at Latin
declension—Fero, Ferenc—he con
fided that his own first name is not
really a given name at all, just a
pet or "nick" name.
HARASSED PROFESSOR, fum
bling through post-conference con
fusion, "Come in, but close the door
before you come in!" HONESTY is
the best policy, or so says Dr.

(frankly, I wasn't listening) Sears.
It's news when a professor sleeps
through a professor's discourse!
HAND reports that after travelling
all over Europe where the trades
men bowed and scraped to him, he
was relieved to return to America,
where a waitress can tell you to "go
to hell" and the barber will look
you square in the adam's apple—
man to man. FIRESIDE READING:
Dr. Davidson heartily recommends
Phillips Gibbs' "Adventures in Eu
rope." FOR THOSE uninformed, a
Kaffee Klatsch is a foreign tea. Pi
Lambda Theta invites all women to
enjoy one in the lounge of the Wom
en's Clubhouse Friday evening from
10 to 11 p.m. . . .* UNSUNG HERO
INE of the hour, Marian Flagg con
ducting the Campus Sing with one
arm in a sling.
