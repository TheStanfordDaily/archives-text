# Hand, Students Publish Book On Campus Life
## 
### 
"Campus Activities," a new book
by Dr. Harold C. Hand, associate
professor of education, and several
of his former students, will be avail
able here today or tomorrow, ac
cording to Mrs. Sterling of the Stan
ford Bookstore.
Dedicated "to all student leaders
and faculty advisers who would
make their campus a laboratory of
democracy," the book takes the po
sition that attitudes, appreciations,
and modes of behavior as well as
information and skills are learned.
Containing 21 chapters on all the
important phases of campus life,
the book presents a survey of com
parative phases on religion, sports,
university leadership, publications,
and living groups in various Amer
ican universities.
"I have no intention of setting up
a regular course on campus lead
ership and activities," said Dr. Hand
yesterday. "If the course is to be
given again, I would recommend
that Deans Yost and Bunn be in
charge." He added that he would be
glad to sit in on such a course and
offer suggestions.
The information contained in the
book was received by surveys sent
to every college containing a stu
dent body of 350 or more. The sur
veys were made up and sent out by
the student leaders enrolled in the
class, and the money was furnished
by a subvention of $400 from the
funds of the A.S.S.U. It was also
established by the A.S.S.U. that all
of the proceeds from the volume
would go to the treasury of that
body.
Among the prominent student
leaders who helped with the writ
ing of the book were Tom Killefer,
Jim Reynolds, Irvin Jorgensen, Jac
queline Brown, and Chick Franich.
Two reviews of the book have al
ready been received by Dr. Hand,
one from the University of Minne
sota which mentioned that it will
be a required text at the University,
and the other from Harvard which
indicates that it is being used during
the present summer school session.
Cooled cars for the transportation
of perishables were first used in
1857.
