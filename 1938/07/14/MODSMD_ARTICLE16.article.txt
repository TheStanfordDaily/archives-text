# Fenton To Lecture On Drama Tonight
## 
### 
"Camille" was not the only play
that came to Roaring Camp and
other settlements in the early days
of California. Everything from
Shakespeare to minstrel shows was
hailed with gusto, and Frank L.
Fenton, in his lecture, "Verse Drama
in the Days of the Gold Rush," to be
given at the Women's Clubhouse
tonight at 8 o'clock, will show how
great a place the poetic play had in
the programs of those days.
Money and nuggets rained on the
stage if the play pleased, and riots
began if it did not; it was the actor's
business to touch the heights and
depths, and that without omission of
a line from the familiar plays. Mr.
Fenton has made extended studies
of early theater history in California
and will deal with productions as
well as plays. His droll but authentic

anecdotes make the Fifties vividly
present. Third item on the Drama
tists program concerning verse
drama, the lecture serves also as in
troduction to the period of the
summer's dramatic season.
