# Pa Kennedy Shines for Accordians
## 
### 
Last Tuesday most of the fa
vorites in the Wheel-Chair League
came through with expected victo
ries in their baseball games.
Surprising was the victory of the
Accordians over the Foreign Legion
by a one-run margin, 9-10. With his
old bones creaking at every step and
a do-or-die look on his withered
face "Pa" Kennedy stepped up to bat
for the Accordians and drove a two
bagger which eventually brought
big A1 Chuchman in for the win
ning run.
El Toro had very little trouble
subduing a listless team of Bush
men, 13 to 1. The Slave Drivers
maintained their unbeaten record
along with El Toro by knocking ev
erything the Wildcats offered all
over the diamond to emerge with an
11 to 2 victory.
Louis Peccetti starred as the Out
laws and the Vantors played the
tightest game of the day. The best
third baseman in the league poled
some long ones to aid the Outlaws in
their 5 to 0 victory.
The Cardinals and the Vultures
kept up their losing streak as they
fell before Legal Eagles and the
Prune Pickers, respectively, 4-13 and
3-17. Both the Legal Eagles and the
Prune Pickers claimed they might
just as well have spent the afternoon
on the track.
Several good contests are slated
for today. The Slave Drivers should
ease through the Legal Eagles. If
"Pa" Kennedy recovers from the
shock of getting a hit in the last
game, the Accordians should beat
the Vantors.
The "terrible" Cardinals will be
pummeled by the Bushmen while El
Toro will badly spank the Vultures.
The Prune Pickers will have a field
day at the expense of the tamed
Wildcats.
The best game of the day should
be between that up and coming
team, the Outlaws, and the hard
luck team of the I ->gue, the Foreign
Legion, with the foi igners having a
slight edge.
