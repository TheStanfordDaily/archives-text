# MINORITY REPORT
## 
### LYNNE ASHTON 
Dear Boss:
Much as I regret to say so, you're
right. I honestly believed that some
one of the thousand persons on the
campus would, of his own free will,
take advantage of his prerogative
and The Dippy and start the Campus
Opinion column. You said it would
have to be started by some member
of the staff.
We did receive one communica
tion, but it could hardly be called
an opinion, since there were no
two ways about it. The writer
had "paid to the order of" and
chose to be placed on our mailing
list.
Heaven alone knows why, be
cause I thought people automatic
ally picked up The Daily en route
to brunch and used it for a coun
ter mop. That someone would
spend three cents to remind us to
send one amazes me—but the let
ter could hardly serve as a pre
miere for Campus Opinion.
Just what we can do about it, I
don't know. I could insult some
one, or get out on some contro
versial limb or other—but I still
have faith in the democratic ideal,
and as long as life is not perfect,
here or anywhere else, I'll wager
that someone will become articu
late—if only to object to the service
in the Cellar. Any takers?

Tuesday's edition announced
grandiloquently that something
was "to take place on the ump
teenth of June." Well, we know
better, but science failed us at the
eleventh hour ,and we were forced
to set type with our hands—a very
messy but fascinating job.
Johnny Cobbs used to say that
on occasions of that nature, there
would be hurried telephone ex
changes between here and Paly;
then two men in black derby hats
would coine down and peer into
the linotype's innards, look at
each other enigmatically, shrug,
and spend the rest of the night
strewing its 15,000 pieces—more or
less—all over the place.
We were denied—or spared—that
pleasure, but the June that should
have been July had to stay June.
Several Stanford coeds have ven
tured into politics, and the winds of
freedom will soon be wafting "Mer
riam for Governor" campaign-mate
rial to the assembled multitudes.
Those who so greatly desire that
the young shall learn what is going
on and participate in the actual se
lection of the "Peepul's" represen
tatives might look to this as an ex
ample or something. Just what it

shows, I don't know, but I do know
"Merriam for Governor" stickers
flash by on the highway—attached
to Buicks, Cadillacs, Packards, Cords,
and beer trucks.

Johnny Cobbs used to say that
on occasions of that nature, there
would be hurried telephone ex
changes between here and Paly;
then two men in black derby hats
would coine down and peer into
the linotype's innards, look at
each other enigmatically, shrug,
and spend the rest of the night
strewing its 15,000 pieces—more or
less—all over the place.
We were denied—or spared—that
pleasure, but the June that should
have been July had to stay June.
Several Stanford coeds have ven
tured into politics, and the winds of
freedom will soon be wafting "Mer
riam for Governor" campaign-mate
rial to the assembled multitudes.
Those who so greatly desire that
the young shall learn what is going
on and participate in the actual se
lection of the "Peepul's" represen
tatives might look to this as an ex
ample or something. Just what it

shows, I don't know, but I do know
"Merriam for Governor" stickers
flash by on the highway—attached
to Buicks, Cadillacs, Packards, Cords,
and beer trucks.
Dear Boss:
Much as I regret to say so, you're
right. I honestly believed that some
one of the thousand persons on the
campus would, of his own free will,
take advantage of his prerogative
and The Dippy and start the Campus
Opinion column. You said it would
have to be started by some member
of the staff.
We did receive one communica
tion, but it could hardly be called
an opinion, since there were no
two ways about it. The writer
had "paid to the order of" and
chose to be placed on our mailing
list.
Heaven alone knows why, be
cause I thought people automatic
ally picked up The Daily en route
to brunch and used it for a coun
ter mop. That someone would
spend three cents to remind us to
send one amazes me—but the let
ter could hardly serve as a pre
miere for Campus Opinion.
Just what we can do about it, I
don't know. I could insult some
one, or get out on some contro
versial limb or other—but I still
have faith in the democratic ideal,
and as long as life is not perfect,
here or anywhere else, I'll wager
that someone will become articu
late—if only to object to the service
in the Cellar. Any takers?

Tuesday's edition announced
grandiloquently that something
was "to take place on the ump

better, but science failed us at the
eleventh hour ,and we were forced
to set type with our hands—a very
messy but fascinating job.
