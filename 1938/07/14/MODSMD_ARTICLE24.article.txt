The cast of Uncle Tom's Cabin
will include Nina Jane Heberer, 12,
daughter of Director H. Miles Heb
erer, in the role of Eva. This will be
Miss Heberer's first appearance on
the stage of Memorial Theater.
Mrs. William Lucas, whose hus
band will play the part of John
Oakhurst, the gambler, in Camillc in
Roaring Camp, is assisting Mrs.
Green with the costumes for the
play.
Among the properties which the
directors are having difficulty in lo
cating are one old - fashioned
square piano, of the bar-room sort,
and a pack of bloodhounds. Any
one having information regarding
the above will be heartily received
in the secretary's office, 202.
Mr. Johansen is exhautsing the
S.F. waterfront in his search for
coal oil lamps appropriate to the
period and to Roarin' Camp.

Judging by the early rehearsals of
Camille in Roaring Canip, the first
play of the summer program should
be a howling success. Starring such
dependable stand-bys as Aubrey
Austin as bartender, Janet North as
Camille, Jack Gillis as Mr. Keene,
Bill Lucas as John Oakhurst, and
"Johnny Johnson" Cady as Mr. Clif
ford, the play sems doomed to suc
cess. Tickets are now on sale in
Secretary Barker's office, m 202, at
50 cents, 75 cents, and $1.
Actors in "Camille in Roaring
Camp" will save the stage crew a
great deal of work as the only scene
changes will be made by the "Ca
mille Company" as part of the play's
action. These will be made on a
stage within the full stage which
will represent the Arcade Saloon.
Bill Basset applies the term "selec
tive realism" to the setting and says
the saloon is impressionistic.
The first revolving stage ever used
in Memorial Hall will soon be un
der construction. It will be used in
"Gringo's Gamble." The five sets
will be made separately and then
taken to the stage for completion.
Three of them will have floors so
that the furniture need not be
moved, and the curtain will not
close during scene changes which
will be made in a short period of
darkness.
