## HOW TO TAKE A VACATION 
### D. ELTON TRUEBLOOD 
It is generally assumed that the
way to take a vacation is to go
away from home, but this assump
tion is curiously unsupported by
human experience. The truth is that
every traveler is faced with a di
lemma, which may be conveniently
called the Dilemma of Baggage. If
you carry little baggage you don't
have what you need, but if you car
ry sufficient baggage the burden is
an impossible one. In a given
month, whether at home or abroad,
one naturally uses most of his pos
sessions at least once, and, since at
home it takes an entire house to
hold them, the futility of taking
them along is obvious.
The real trouble is that we have
to go on living even when we are
on the move. Letters have to be
written and monthly bills demand
payment in vacation time as well as
in other times. You find invariably
that the particular notation needed
is in the back section of the middle
drawer of the desk in your study at
home. All these conveniences might
be carried in a trailer, but then
the trailer would be as big as a
house, and the driver would look
more disconsolate than he normally
does, when going up a steep grade,
with the weight of the trailer mak
ing his engine overheated.
The true solution lies in having
one's vacation at home. At home you
do not mind if you use your Tux
edo only once in the month, inasmuch
as you haven't had to make room for
it in daily packings. At home it is
perfectly satisfactory to receive invi
tations for golf or tennis because
your equipment is always at hand.
At home you can enjoy, a hundred
pleasures without having the bother
and expense of reaching them, and
you can fill your fountain pen from
your own ink bottle.
This is not to say that men and
women should never travel. Of
course they should travel, but as a
duty. You should travel to improve
your education, to broaden your
sympathies, to learn more about
your job, to visit your relatives, to
hear distinguished speakers ,to be
come a world citizen. All these pur
poses are highly meritorious, but
there is no gain in confusing the
issue by the erroneous supposition
that travel is play.

That travel can broaden one's
grasp of fact no one will deny. For
example, I now know that there is
one place in our nation where you
can buy a really superb mug of root
beer. I know also that you can buy
an amazingly satisfying malted milk
in the daily in Ogallolla, and for
only ten cents. The malted milk in
cludes Guernsey milk, excellent ice
cream, and twice the ordinary
amount of everything.
I know, too, that winter lasts a
long time in Wells, Nevada, that
Cheyenne has splendid auto courts
and that Mr. Einstein looks like his
photographs. I learned all these facts
by travel, but for sheer enjoyment I
should rather play tennis at home. It
is more fun to play tennis at Stan
ford than in England or in New
England, since in those areas the
players feel the need of wearing
shirts, whereas the men of the Stan
ford faculty enjoy the sun.
I hope I am doing no harm to the
recreation business, but my experi
ence teaches me that most pleasure
resorts are disappointing. Atlantic
City looks too much like a metrop
olis, Cape May has ferocious mosqui

toes when there is a land breeze,
and most of the ocean resorts, east
or west, are so sandy that there are
no good green lawns on which to
rest one's eyes. The mountains
have grandeur, but life is strenu
ous among them and the lungs are
soon eager for godo thick air.
Moreover, tennis balls bounce in a
crazy fashion at six thousand feet.
For sheer enjoyment life at home
is hard to surpass. In our home
surroundings we soon overlook the
defects and go on unperturbed. I
realize that distinguished visitors
are shocked by the dark hole we
call the Cellar, but I really love to
drop in there for coffee, with cream.
There are some mosaics in the Me
morial Church which are very bad,
the prime example being that of
Adam and Eve, but we soon over
look these minor features and find
solid satisfaction in the general at
mosphere of beauty.
One of the chief reasons why life
here in the summer is so good is
that we have the opportunity con
tinually to contrast our lot with
that of the unfortunate tourists. We
always feel so superior to them be
cause we know already where Mr.
Hoover's home is. All I need to give
myself a real lift, is to cut the grass
of my lawn and watch the unhappy
people with stickers all over their
windshields. After all Dickens was
envisioning something deep and
permanent in human life when he
invented Mr. Pecksniff.

ence teaches me that most pleasure
resorts are disappointing. Atlantic
City looks too much like a metrop
olis, Cape May has ferocious mosqui

toes when there is a land breeze,
and most of the ocean resorts, east
or west, are so sandy that there are
no good green lawns on which to
rest one's eyes. The mountains
have grandeur, but life is strenu
ous among them and the lungs are
soon eager for godo thick air.
Moreover, tennis balls bounce in a
crazy fashion at six thousand feet.
For sheer enjoyment life at home
is hard to surpass. In our home
surroundings we soon overlook the
defects and go on unperturbed. I
realize that distinguished visitors
are shocked by the dark hole we
call the Cellar, but I really love to
drop in there for coffee, with cream.
There are some mosaics in the Me
morial Church which are very bad,
the prime example being that of
Adam and Eve, but we soon over
look these minor features and find
solid satisfaction in the general at
mosphere of beauty.
One of the chief reasons why life
here in the summer is so good is
that we have the opportunity con
tinually to contrast our lot with
that of the unfortunate tourists. We
always feel so superior to them be
cause we know already where Mr.
Hoover's home is. All I need to give
myself a real lift, is to cut the grass
of my lawn and watch the unhappy
people with stickers all over their
windshields. After all Dickens was
envisioning something deep and
permanent in human life when he
invented Mr. Pecksniff.
It is generally assumed that the
way to take a vacation is to go
away from home, but this assump
tion is curiously unsupported by
human experience. The truth is that
every traveler is faced with a di
lemma, which may be conveniently
called the Dilemma of Baggage. If
you carry little baggage you don't
have what you need, but if you car
ry sufficient baggage the burden is
an impossible one. In a given
month, whether at home or abroad,
one naturally uses most of his pos
sessions at least once, and, since at
home it takes an entire house to
hold them, the futility of taking
them along is obvious.
The real trouble is that we have
to go on living even when we are
on the move. Letters have to be
written and monthly bills demand
payment in vacation time as well as
in other times. You find invariably
that the particular notation needed
is in the back section of the middle
drawer of the desk in your study at
home. All these conveniences might
be carried in a trailer, but then
the trailer would be as big as a
house, and the driver would look
more disconsolate than he normally
does, when going up a steep grade,
with the weight of the trailer mak
ing his engine overheated.
The true solution lies in having
one's vacation at home. At home you
do not mind if you use your Tux
edo only once in the month, inasmuch
as you haven't had to make room for
it in daily packings. At home it is
perfectly satisfactory to receive invi
tations for golf or tennis because
your equipment is always at hand.
At home you can enjoy, a hundred
pleasures without having the bother
and expense of reaching them, and
you can fill your fountain pen from
your own ink bottle.
This is not to say that men and
women should never travel. Of
course they should travel, but as a
duty. You should travel to improve
your education, to broaden your
sympathies, to learn more about
your job, to visit your relatives, to
hear distinguished speakers ,to be
come a world citizen. All these pur
poses are highly meritorious, but
there is no gain in confusing the
issue by the erroneous supposition
that travel is play.

That travel can broaden one's
grasp of fact no one will deny. For
example, I now know that there is
one place in our nation where you
can buy a really superb mug of root
beer. I know also that you can buy
an amazingly satisfying malted milk
in the daily in Ogallolla, and for
only ten cents. The malted milk in
cludes Guernsey milk, excellent ice
cream, and twice the ordinary
amount of everything.
I know, too, that winter lasts a
long time in Wells, Nevada, that
Cheyenne has splendid auto courts
and that Mr. Einstein looks like his
photographs. I learned all these facts
by travel, but for sheer enjoyment I
should rather play tennis at home. It
is more fun to play tennis at Stan
ford than in England or in New
England, since in those areas the
players feel the need of wearing
shirts, whereas the men of the Stan
ford faculty enjoy the sun.

and expense of reaching them, and
you can fill your fountain pen from
your own ink bottle.
This is not to say that men and
women should never travel. Of
course they should travel, but as a
duty. You should travel to improve
your education, to broaden your
sympathies, to learn more about
your job, to visit your relatives, to
hear distinguished speakers ,to be
come a world citizen. All these pur
poses are highly meritorious, but
there is no gain in confusing the
issue by the erroneous supposition
that travel is play.

That travel can broaden one's
grasp of fact no one will deny. For
example, I now know that there is
one place in our nation where you
can buy a really superb mug of root
beer. I know also that you can buy
an amazingly satisfying malted milk
in the daily in Ogallolla, and for
only ten cents. The malted milk in
cludes Guernsey milk, excellent ice
cream, and twice the ordinary
amount of everything.
I know, too, that winter lasts a
long time in Wells, Nevada, that
Cheyenne has splendid auto courts
and that Mr. Einstein looks like his
photographs. I learned all these facts
by travel, but for sheer enjoyment I
should rather play tennis at home. It
is more fun to play tennis at Stan
ford than in England or in New
England, since in those areas the
players feel the need of wearing
shirts, whereas the men of the Stan
ford faculty enjoy the sun.
I hope I am doing no harm to the
recreation business, but my experi
ence teaches me that most pleasure
resorts are disappointing. Atlantic
City looks too much like a metrop
olis, Cape May has ferocious mosqui

toes when there is a land breeze,
and most of the ocean resorts, east
or west, are so sandy that there are
no good green lawns on which to
rest one's eyes. The mountains
have grandeur, but life is strenu
ous among them and the lungs are
soon eager for godo thick air.
Moreover, tennis balls bounce in a
crazy fashion at six thousand feet.
For sheer enjoyment life at home
is hard to surpass. In our home
surroundings we soon overlook the
defects and go on unperturbed. I
realize that distinguished visitors
are shocked by the dark hole we
call the Cellar, but I really love to
drop in there for coffee, with cream.
There are some mosaics in the Me
morial Church which are very bad,
the prime example being that of
Adam and Eve, but we soon over
look these minor features and find
solid satisfaction in the general at
mosphere of beauty.
One of the chief reasons why life
here in the summer is so good is
that we have the opportunity con
tinually to contrast our lot with
that of the unfortunate tourists. We
always feel so superior to them be
cause we know already where Mr.
Hoover's home is. All I need to give
myself a real lift, is to cut the grass
of my lawn and watch the unhappy
people with stickers all over their
windshields. After all Dickens was
envisioning something deep and
permanent in human life when he
invented Mr. Pecksniff.
It is generally assumed that the
way to take a vacation is to go
away from home, but this assump
tion is curiously unsupported by
human experience. The truth is that
every traveler is faced with a di
lemma, which may be conveniently
called the Dilemma of Baggage. If
you carry little baggage you don't
have what you need, but if you car
ry sufficient baggage the burden is
an impossible one. In a given
month, whether at home or abroad,
one naturally uses most of his pos
sessions at least once, and, since at
home it takes an entire house to
hold them, the futility of taking
them along is obvious.
The real trouble is that we have
to go on living even when we are
on the move. Letters have to be
written and monthly bills demand
payment in vacation time as well as
in other times. You find invariably
that the particular notation needed
is in the back section of the middle
drawer of the desk in your study at
home. All these conveniences might
be carried in a trailer, but then
the trailer would be as big as a
house, and the driver would look
more disconsolate than he normally
does, when going up a steep grade,
with the weight of the trailer mak
ing his engine overheated.
The true solution lies in having
one's vacation at home. At home you
do not mind if you use your Tux
edo only once in the month, inasmuch
as you haven't had to make room for
it in daily packings. At home it is
perfectly satisfactory to receive invi
tations for golf or tennis because
your equipment is always at hand.
At home you can enjoy, a hundred
pleasures without having the bother
and expense of reaching them, and
you can fill your fountain pen from
your own ink bottle.
