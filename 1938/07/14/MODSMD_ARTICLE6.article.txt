### 
The 17-year-old chemistry shark,
Edgar Friedenberg, spoke to the
progressive educators in the Stanford
Language Arts Investigation depart
ment yesterday morning in a plea
for the "Creation of Scientific
Courses in Journalism."
The young graduate stressed the
i need of popularizing scientific writ
i ing and of doing away with scien
tific jargon. "Why can't the curricu
lum of our schools be made palat
able to all students?" he asked.
Forcing children into special inter
ests narrow their future interests in
life, when at such an early age
they really don't know just what
! they want, Friedenberg stated.
Friedenberg advocated a system
of English advisers in each depart
ment of all universities to aid stu
dents in expressing their ideas in
research papers. He concluded his
brief talk by answering a few ques
tions asked about his own education
which has been largely received
through tutoring.
The young chemist was graduated
last June, from Centenary College
in Sheveport, La. He has spent the
i past two summers in school at Cor
! Nell, and this fall he is to enter
Stanford Graduate School of Chem
; istry.
Recently he achieved the distinc

ciety when he read a paper on
