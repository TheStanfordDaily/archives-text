# Pioneer Play Opening Set
## 
### HARRISON STEPHENS 
With rehearsals every afternoon
and evening this week, "Camille in
Roaring Camp," Thomas Wood Stev
ens' comedy of the West, is shaping
up for its opening Thursday night.
It will run three showings in the
Memorial Theater.
Starring such well known Stag
ers as Janet Dole, Jack Gillis, Bud
Cady, Shirley Jones and J. P. Cahn,
the play centers around a produc
tion of the famous tragedy, "Ca
mille,'' in the saloon of Bret Harte's
Roaring Camp.
Based on History
"Camille in Roaring Camp" is
really based on history, Mr. Stev
ens explained today. In the 1850's,
he said, Matilda Heron, a famous
American actress, translated the
current French dramatic rage, "Ca
mille," herself, and gathering to
gether a company of actors, played
it in a wide tour through the boom
ing mining camps of the West. Mr.
Stevens has taken the epitome of
the mid-Nineteenth Century West,
Bret Harte's Roaring Camp, for a set
ting, and placed just such a travel
ing company in its midst.
Play Within Play
A play within a play often has too
many wheels to please an audience,
but for his comedy, Mr. Stevens has
used a most effecitve device to ov
ercome this. When Ihe audience files
into the theater Thursday night it
will see not the familiar red cur
tain, but Bret Harte's famous bar
room. A shuffling Chinaman sweeps
the floor lethargically, the bar
tender wipes the counter and pol
ishes glasses, miners slouch in for
whiskey shots. All this is in panto
mime. At 8:3(1 the action begins,
but the audience is already in the
mood of the Western setting.
Tickets for the play are on sale in
Mr. Barker's office, m 202, at 50
cents, 75 cents, and $1.
