# Ebersole Analyzes Business Forces
## 
### 
"No one factor is alone responsible for fluctuations in the business
cycle," I)r. Jobn F. Ebersole told 175 Pacific Coast business men at the
opening session of (he second annual Stanford Business Conference
yesterday.
Dr. Ebersole, a professor of finance at the Harvard Graduate School of
Business Administration, stressed the need for an eclectic approach to

â–ºthe various theories on business
cycle fluctuations. No theory is
wholly wrong or wholly right, and
no one theory adequately considers
all of the many economic forces at
work, Dr. Ebersole asserted.
Credit System
Emphasizing the important part
played by the American money and
banking system, Dr. Ebersole pre
dicted that in the future the policy
of restricting bank credit will not be
followed during periods of economic
tension. "Deposit credit is borrowed
credit," Dr. Ebersole said. "If re
covery starts at any one point, de
posit credit can widely spread the
benefits of recovery."
The fact that banks now possess
excess funds is no guarantee that
these surpluses will be taken up by
investors, Dr. Ebersole continued.
There is no way of forcing business
to utilize bank funds.
Governmental policies of subsi
dizing consumption or encouraging
use of bank credit through main
taining easy interest terms will not,
in Dr. Ebersole's opinion, start an
upturn in the business cycle.
Lessons Learned
Illustrating how retailers have
profited during the 1937 "recession"
from past depression experience,
Neil Petree, president of Barker
Brothers, Los Angeles retail home
furnishing store, who followed Dr.
Ebersole, suggested lessons to be
learned from depression periods.
"Older people were not as fre
quently let out during the recent re
cession," he said, because that
would weaken "many an organiza
tion just at the time when it could
least afford to lose the value that
comes with long experience."
Other lessons learned, Petree indi
cated, are shown by the following
record:
Prices were reduced more quick
ly and inventories restored to a
healthy condition; individual ini
tiative was not. hampered by unnec
essary system; quality standards
have been maintained and improve
ment in plant, and equipment has
continued; managers have become
better acquainted with rank and file,
and the morale of the employes has
improved with a better understand
ing of management's problems.
Farm Trouble
An ever-normal granary and the
growing subsidy of farmers were
considered the most ominous notes
in the present agricultural condi
tions in Dr. Joseph Davis' lecture,
which was the final speech yester
day morning.
Speaking on "Agriculture and the
Nation's Business," Dr. Davis re
marked that "No country has yet
learned the secret of uninterrupted
prosperity," and indicated that the
idea of much of the federal legisla
tion concerning agriculture was de
signed to try to do just that.
Munro Speaks
"Business men must stop resisting
government interference and gov
ernment regulation," said Dr. Wil
liam B. Munro, municipal govern
ment expert, in his speech at the
dinner session last night.
Speaking of the regulations im
posed by the. present government,
Dr. Munro said that "It is the un
certainty and not the regulation
that is the great evil," and recom
mended that it would be much bet
ter for business men to try to help
the government rather than try to
stall it.
"We are going to have govern
ment regulation," he said, and prop
er procedure is to "lend our united
efforts to make that regulation more
efficient." Two things business men
can do to are fix the civil service so
it will be more efficient and to train
men who will know how to regu
late business.
Social Lag
Dr. Munro pointed out that this
country is one of the most ad
vanced technologically, and one of
the most backward sociologically.
The United States made great ad
vances in mechanics since the found
ing of the country but is still using
the same law-making system, he
explained.
Development of labor-saving de
vices is more rapid than social prog
ress, and therefore a gap is created
which is changed only by social
revolution, said Dr. Munro. In the
Anglo-Saxon countries this revo
lution is cultural, but it comes pe
riodically as a means of bring social
processes in line with technological.
Almost 1000 miles of standard
gauge railroad track was laid in
France during the World War, with
materials shipped from America.
