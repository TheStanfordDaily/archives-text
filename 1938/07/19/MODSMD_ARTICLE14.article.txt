# Wirth Stresses Place of Elect In Sociology
## Relation of Ideas To Group Action, New Jobs Emphasized 
### JUNIUS CARY 
"The only security parents can
give their children is an intellec
tual background that will enable
them to live rather than merely
make a living." Thus Dr. Louis
Wirth summarized the search for se
curity that characterizes the recent
rise in the importance of sociology.
He wants to create an elect in each
country based on ability to gain the
confidence of their fellow men and
deliver the goods in the form of in
telligent leadership. Dr. Wirth feels
that in the past ideas have been
studied too much from the logical
and psychological point of view, and
that the relation of ideas 'to group
action was left out of the picture.
Fields of Endeavor
Dr. Wirth feels his job is to stim
ulate people to go into new fields of
endeavor. These have been made
available in recent years in response
to the increased need of trained men
in government service. They are in
the realm of public finance, diplo
macy, housing, social security, pub
lic management, social work, and
propaganda. People in this general
field should have a deep spirit of
public service and a broad educa
tional background.
Dr. Wirth finds here much the
same spirit of pioneering in the field
of pushing out the frontiers of
knowledge that characterizes his
own University of Chicago, which
was built about the same time.
They are both very young in the
hierarchy of American universities,
but both were built in an attempt to
contribute something that was lack
telligent leadership. Dr. Wirth thinks
the most progressive schools in the
country, partly due to the fact that
they do not have to clear away the
deadwood of tradition, and partly
due to the same background upon
which they were founded.
Teaching Classes
Dr. Wirth is teaching two classes
here this summer, "The Sociology of
Intellectual Life" and "Urban Civi
lization." The first course deals
with the study of the social and po
litical action of people and the ideas
underlying this action. It covers the
dangers of thought, the disturbing
of tradition that results, the various
concepts of truth, the force of opin
ions on truth, the possibility of re
maining neutral in a world of con
flict; the role of intellectuals: who
they are, where they come from, how
they are recruited, who supports
them, how they are supported; the
role of the professions: what a group
does to attain professional status,
the rules it prescribes for its mem

bers, and the rules it lays down for
those seeking to become members.
Urban Civilization
"Urban Civilization," on which
Dr. Wirth is one of the best au
thorities, treats on the cities' roles
in modern life. Dr. Wirth was a
member of the research committee
of the National Resources commit
tee in a study of urban life and its
problems. His course is the fix*st
ever given on that topic, and covers
the control and planning of cities,
the analysis of their place in the
national life: to find what could be
done to make them more liveable
and to strike a balance between ur
ban and rural life.
