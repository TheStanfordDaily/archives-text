## LO, A CAMPUS OPINION 
### 
Editor, Stanford Daily:
While your paper is extolling the
virtues and charms of the campus,
could you find space to mention the
fact to your readers that there ex
ists the tradition of the Ride to and
from Paly?
It is getting so that it is just about
as quick to walk, yet there are
plenty of cars driving to and from
the campus. What's the use of hav
ing a tradition if no one observes it?
No doubt many of the school
teachers here for the summer would
be glad to give a fellow a lift if
they knew what he was standing
there for.
At the same time those few who

do stop to pick us up should know
that we really appreciate their
courtesy.

Down the Row came a car. It
was the vintage of '25, the year of
the big snow. At its wheel sat an
honest-to-goodness "rough," with
dirty cords and a sweat shirt cover
ing a heart of gold.
As the driver drove past the Eng
lish Corner, he saw ahead a fair
young thing standing on the corner.
His "hello" spirit and his "give-a
ride to a fellow student" spirit well
ed up in him. He vigorously applied
the brakes and brought "Eleanor
Roosevelt" (she never gets tired) to
a grinding, squeaking stop.
"Ride down town?" asked the
young man.
"No!" was her answer.
There was a deadly pause.
"Are you particular with whom
you ride," he asked.
"Yesâ€”very particular," came the
reply.
"Well," said the driver, "I'm not.
That's why I asked you!" And with
a whop of delight he dx-ove away
from the muchly abashed young
lady.

Nebraska is an Indian name
meaning "water valley."
