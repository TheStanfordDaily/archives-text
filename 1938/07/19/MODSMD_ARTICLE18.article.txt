# Card Ball Club Wins Two Tilts
## Slave Drivers Drop Game to El Toro 
### VARICK MARTIN 
On bended knees, and with heads
bowed, all former critics of the
Cardinal baseball team asked for
giveness, for on last Thursday and
Friday the oft-beaten Cards won
two games.
In Thursday's game the Cards
scored a smashing victory over the
Bushmen, 20-10. Then, while every
one was re-adding the score to be
sure there wasn't some mistake, the
Cards went out on Friday and wal
loped the Wildcats, 10-2. When
Manager Kutch of the Cards was
asked what had happened to his ball
club to bring it to life, all he could
say was, "Gosh! I don't know."
Along with other surprises of the
day came the report that the "Vow
ing Faculty," a team composed of
such past greats as Grayson and
Rouble, and otherwise known as the
Slave Drivers, had gone down to de
feat at the hands of a smart El Toro
team. The Toros played their out
fields way out in the field so that
the long hits went right into their
mitts. The score was 3 to 1.
Other scores were for Thursday:
Vantors 11, Accordians 3
Slave Drivers 14, Legal Eagles 9
Prune Pickers 11, Wildcats 2
Outlaws 8, Foreign Legion 2
