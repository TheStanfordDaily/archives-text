# Vesper Service Attracts Many
## 
### 
Following the first Sunday after
noon vesper service ever held in the
Lawrence Frost Amphitheater, Dr.
Trueblood said yesterday that he
has received many requests for
more such services in the future.
About 400 people were present
last Sunday at the 45-minute pro
gram featuring choir music and con
gregational singing. No loud speak
er was needed.
Accompanied by the Everett Elec
/ric "Orgatron the choir sang two
early American hymns, and Dr.
Trueblood read short medieval es
says from "The Little Flowers from
Saint Francis."
The chaplain was assisted by two
Palo Alto ministers, the Reverend
Lachlen and the Reverend Paul Of
fenhiser in presenting the invoca
tion and benediction.
Dr. Trueblood said that there will
probably be more outdoor vesper
services in the future and that he
hopes to have the next one on Sun
day, August 7.
