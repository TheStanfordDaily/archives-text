# Corrigan Solos Atlantic Ocean
## U.S. Papers Lacking For Flight to Eire 
### 
Flying a nine-year-old single-mo
tored airplane, remodeled by him
self, Douglas Corrigan, California
flyer, yesterday completed a sneak
hop across the Atlantic and landed
at Baldonnel Airport, Dublin, Ire
land, at 2:30 p.m. (5:30 a.m., P.S.T.),
28 hours and 13 minutes after tak
ing off from the flare-marked run
way at Floyd Bennett Field, New
York, where he had given his des
tination as Los Angeles.
On July 9 the red-haired pilot
flew his out-moded Curtiss-Robin
monoplane non-stop from Long
Beach to New York in 28 hours, ar
riving with five gallons of gasoline
still in the tanks. His flight was ob
scured by the attention given the
four-day globe-circling hop by How
ard Hughes, who pronounced Cor
rigan's flight "very, very remark
able."
In Ireland, Corrigan inquired, "By
the way, where am I?" When asked
for his landing papers he smilingly
asserted that he thought he was go
ing to California and didn't have
any.
