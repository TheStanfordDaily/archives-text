# Shelley Analyzes Labor Problems
## 
### 
Claiming that much of the fight
ing between the American Federa
tion of Labor and the Committee for
Industrial Organization is only a
front, John F. Shelley, president of
the San Francisco Labor Council,
said yesterday that one of the great
est faults of the labor system is that
there are some individuals in it for
personal gain and not for public
good. This, with the continued at
tacks of the press, is the greatest
cause for common misunderstanding
of labor problems.
Speaking of the Wagner Act,
which he called the "Magna Charta
of Labor," Mr. Shelley said that
both the A. F. of L. and the C. I. O.
wanted the same thing but disagreed
on minor points. The minor dis
agreements magnified gave a dis
torted picture.
The Wages and Hours Bill recent
ly passed by Congress was one case
where the two organizations dis
-1 agreed on basic principles. The
C.1.0. wanted boards set up which
would determine wages and hours
in areas according to local condi
tions, while the A. F. of L. insisted
on a floor for wages and ceiling for
hours. The present law, he said, is
a compromise bill.
The principal objection to the re
cent proposal to incorporate unions
is that mere incorporation would
not make labor unions any more re
sponsible than they are already,
Shelley asserted. Furthermore, their

existence, he pointed out, would
depend entirely on the personal
feelings of the individual issuing the
corporation permit.
As for the general picture, Mr.
Shelley said that it was in a transi
tional stage and constantly improv
ing. At present, both the labor fac
tions are fighting' for the same
things in different terms. That they
will eventually end up "in the same
boat" was Mr. Shelley's belief.
