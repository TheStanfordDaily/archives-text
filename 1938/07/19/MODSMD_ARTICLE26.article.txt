Members of the San Francisco
Opera Company and Opera Ballet
who attended the Division of Speech
and Drama's Tea Sunday were
very enthusiastic in their praise of
past productions and in their ap
proval of the division's summer pro
gram of American drama. Accord
ing to Mr. Johansen, who person
ally conducted the group on a tour
of inspection through Memorial The
ater, they were surprised to learn
that any university possessed such
excellent facilities. The San Fran
cisco Opera Ballet is expected here
in November, the exact date to be
announced later.

Dorothy Leverenz, San Jose stu
dent, will play the lead in Director
Gordon Lange's forthcoming pro
duction of "Gringo's Gamble." Since
the role entails a great deal of the
most difficult voice control, it was
necessary to exercise extreme cau
tion in choosing the actress. Miss
Leverenz was chosen both for her
superb acting ability and the fact
that she looks the part.

Extremely enjoyable these warm
summer evenings are the readings
being given by both Stagers and
the Dramatists. The former group,
headed by J. P. Cahn, and the lat
ter, by Dr. Margery Bailey, have
planned their respective programs
so that they dovetail conveniently
and provide an especially interest
ing variety.
Fred Clark, who may be remem
bered as Malvolio in last year's
production of "Twelfth Night," has
had 55 successive performances on
Broadway and is looking forward to
an even better season, according to
his parents.

An orchard to Carl Deisenroth for
his excellent bar-room rendition in
"Camille in Roaring Camp." Well
known on the campus for his
prowess at the piano, Carl is de
voting much of his time to the the
ater this summer and is doing a
good job. Stock phrase: "Well, if
you can't sing it in that key, let's
try this one."
Odds and ends: Gerry Schreiber
hopes to do some work at the Pasa

dena Community Playhouse this
summer. . . . Bud Cady may go
abroad to garner some practical
experience on the stages of London.
. . . The bar used in "Camille in
Roaring Camp" was made from a
hall-rack and fixtures donated by a
wealthy San Francisco family. . . .
Lee Chapin, playing the part of Ah
Sin, Chinese janitor in the same
play, is good for a hearty laugh.
. . . correction . . . Janet Dole,
and not Janet North, is playing the
part of Camille. . _ . my error

band visited the campus recently.
. . . Olive Krauthoff, after giv
ing her all for the Palo Alto Com
munity Theater, has left to spend a
week with Melba Toombs at Lake
Tahoe prior to her return to New
York. . . . The chorus of "Camille
in Roaring Camp" resembles Min

piano player makes a good chorus
boy . . . guess who.

An orchard to Carl Deisenroth for
his excellent bar-room rendition in
"Camille in Roaring Camp." Well
known on the campus for his
prowess at the piano, Carl is de

good job. Stock phrase: "Well, if
you can't sing it in that key, let's
try this one."

past productions and in their ap

Dorothy Leverenz, San Jose stu
dent, will play the lead in Director
Gordon Lange's forthcoming pro
duction of "Gringo's Gamble." Since
the role entails a great deal of the
most difficult voice control, it was
necessary to exercise extreme cau
tion in choosing the actress. Miss
Leverenz was chosen both for her
superb acting ability and the fact
that she looks the part.

Extremely enjoyable these warm
summer evenings are the readings
being given by both Stagers and

planned their respective programs
so that they dovetail conveniently
and provide an especially interest
ing variety.
