Probably the most encouraging
thing about the business men of the
Pacific Coast is their attitude as
shown in this conference. While
critics throughout the nation cry out
that the country is going to the dogs,
these men are meeting and telling
each other how much better things
are than they have been.
The best example of current
prosperity was related by Neil Pet
ree, president of' Barker Brothers in
Los Angeles. This morning he said
that he was talking to Mr. May of
the May Company recently and ask
ed him how business was. Mr. May's
reply was that the "profits are al
ready 25 per cent ahead of next
year."

Outside Meetings

However, much serious discussion
has taken place outside of the sched
uled meetings. Two men were over
heard making an appointment to
meet some time during the afternoon
to settle a problem peculiar to their
industry. It is these impromptu
meetings that Dean Jackson had in
mind when he invited the biggest
business men on the Pacific Coast
here for the week.
Another of the purposes of the
conference was to bring representa
tives of both labor and capital to
gether in the hope that meeting on
a common ground they might be
more likely to settle business dif
ferences. This aim has been achieved
in some cases as was evidenced by
the employer who thanked labor's
Mr. Shelley for telling him some
things about labor relations he never
knew, but would be invaluable, he
said.
Another was heard to say that he
had learned enough in one day to
help him in his business for the
next year.
Mutual Problems
The frank discussion of mutual
problems is one of the benefits of a
week's conference away from home.
Dropping a few formalities, rival
business men are able to lay their
cards on the table in such a way

that the solutions are often in clear
sight.
There is another side to the con
ference, though. Men in rival in
dustries are meeting and becoming
friends under conditions that could
never prevail in an office. Two new
friends were talking yesterday
about a third they had just met. The
object of their conversation, instead
of business, was the man's figure
while swimming.
Conventional Picture
The conventional picture of the big
business man drawn in motion pic
tures is one over 50 with his private
corporation leading him through
life. Instead of age and weight, the
men staying in Lagunita Court are,
on the average, under 40 and of ex
cellent appearance. Their humor, as
well as their wives, seem to reflect
an attitude of liberal thoughts and
modern methods.
Dr. Munro in his speech last night
effectively soothed the group with
his stories concerning the present
administration. Best received of
these was his name for the present
recession, which is called a period
of "diminished acceleration."
