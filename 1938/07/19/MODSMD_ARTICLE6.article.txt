# Play Reading Good Despite Difficulties
## 
### KATHERINE PAGE 
Jack Gillis has a professional vil
lain's scream. At any rate, it was
devilish enough to set Bud Cady,
the whole cast of "The Octaroon,"
and the audience into a convulsive
fit of the giggles while Shirley
Jones, the heroine, nobly exercised
control to read her dying speech.
Although J. P. Cahn's garters, and
Sylvia Onesti's satin blue slippers
were enough to distract the most at
tentive, the Stagers' reading of Dion
Boucicault's "The Octaroon," last
Friday night in the Little Theater
was the liveliest reading presented
yet this summer.
Accident Befalls Cast
Something quite mysterious hap
pened to part of the cast, too, but
all Director Paul Crary would tell
uf about it was that they had met
with an accident, and that he would
supply the parts of Ted Curtis and
read directions, while Janet Dole
would pinch-hit for lien Devlin.
Dealing with the slavery ques
tion, "The Octaroon" represents the
conditions in Louisiana in 1859. It
is the tragedy of a girl who has had
all the advantages of a white girl,
but must be deprived of the man
she loves because of eight fatal
drops of negro blood. Although the
play is tragic, humorous lines are
plentiful throughout. One of the fun
niest of these was by Paul Crary
himself, who read: "He exits swim
ming."
Play Read Well
The villain, employed to compli
cate the plot and to meet the hor
rible death executed by a tommy
hawk, was melodramatically typical,
and the hero was a little too much
on the virtuous side to be human.
Nevertheless, the play is represen
tative of early American drama, and
it reaches moments of excitement to
stir even a 20th century audience.
Even if their sense of humor is
abounding, the Stagers can read
well. Shirley Jones was admirable
as Zoe, the Otcaroon, Sylvia Onesti's
timing and shadings of voice skillful
as Dora Sunnyside. J. P. Cahn, as
the old negro servant, anticipated a
good performance as Uncle Tom.
Others in the cast included the al
ways capable Bud Cady, Joe Whit
aker, George Wilson, Jack Gillis,
Paul Crary, Dick Tate, Joe Lawry,
Aubrey Austin, Mary Leles, and
Harriet Touton.

Dealing with the slavery ques
tion, "The Octaroon" represents the
conditions in Louisiana in 1859. It
is the tragedy of a girl who has had
all the advantages of a white girl,
but must be deprived of the man
she loves because of eight fatal
drops of negro blood. Although the
play is tragic, humorous lines are
plentiful throughout. One of the fun
niest of these was by Paul Crary
himself, who read: "He exits swim
ming."
Play Read Well
The villain, employed to compli
cate the plot and to meet the hor
rible death executed by a tommy
hawk, was melodramatically typical,
and the hero was a little too much
on the virtuous side to be human.
Nevertheless, the play is represen
tative of early American drama, and
it reaches moments of excitement to
stir even a 20th century audience.
Even if their sense of humor is
abounding, the Stagers can read
well. Shirley Jones was admirable
as Zoe, the Otcaroon, Sylvia Onesti's
timing and shadings of voice skillful
as Dora Sunnyside. J. P. Cahn, as
the old negro servant, anticipated a
good performance as Uncle Tom.
Others in the cast included the al
ways capable Bud Cady, Joe Whit
aker, George Wilson, Jack Gillis,
Paul Crary, Dick Tate, Joe Lawry,
Aubrey Austin, Mary Leles, and
Harriet Touton.
Jack Gillis has a professional vil
lain's scream. At any rate, it was
devilish enough to set Bud Cady,
the whole cast of "The Octaroon,"
and the audience into a convulsive
fit of the giggles while Shirley
Jones, the heroine, nobly exercised
control to read her dying speech.
Although J. P. Cahn's garters, and
Sylvia Onesti's satin blue slippers
were enough to distract the most at
tentive, the Stagers' reading of Dion
Boucicault's "The Octaroon," last
Friday night in the Little Theater
was the liveliest reading presented
yet this summer.
Accident Befalls Cast
Something quite mysterious hap
pened to part of the cast, too, but
all Director Paul Crary would tell
uf about it was that they had met
with an accident, and that he would
supply the parts of Ted Curtis and
read directions, while Janet Dole
would pinch-hit for lien Devlin.
