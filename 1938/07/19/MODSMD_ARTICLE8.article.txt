# Fenton Recalls San Francisco Theater Life
## Speaker Describes Drama Here in '50's; Cites Performances 
### 
Recalling interesting anecdotes of
theatrical history and of such well
known actors as James Stark and
the Booths, Mr. Frank Fenton of
San Francisco State College enter
tained a small audience in the
Women's Clubhouse last Thursday
evening as the third event of the
Dramatists' program.
The first English presentation in
1849 was Sheridan Knowles' "The
Wife, a Tale of Manchua." San
Francisco taste was proved superior
by its failure. Nevertheless, inter
est was aroused, and a circus man
built a stage under his circus tent.
Next, Thomas McGuire built the
first Jenny Lind theater over his
Parker House Saloon. This rococo
theater thrived and burned twice
to be rebuilt finally with granite
imported from China. It was later
sold to the supervisors for $200,000
and used as the city hall.
"There was no cultural lag in the
1850'5," declared Mr. Fenton. The
Californians took culture for what
it was. They were not self-conscious
about it. San Franciscans slept late
in the morning and went out at
night. They spent from 8:30 to
midnight in the theaters, and went
two or three times a week to see
different performers in the same
play. They could see Othello very
seriously one night, and the next
laugh uproariously at a negro bur
lesque of it."
Mr. Fenton read dramatic criti
cisms from the newspapers of the
time, and from these the enthusiasm,
good taste, and intelligence of the
San Francisco audeinces were
proved.
Mr. Fenton was introduced by Dr.
Margery Bailey, who announced
that "Camille in Roaring Camp" to
be presented this week, is exem
plary of the subject of Mr. Fenton's
lecture.
