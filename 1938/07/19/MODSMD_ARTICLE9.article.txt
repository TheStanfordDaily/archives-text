# Stuttering Cures Told by Anderson
## 
### 
"Great care must be taken to
prevent the stutterer from thinking
that there is anything basically
wrong with him," said Virgil A. An
derson, assistant professor of speech
and drama, last, night in a discussion
on the Stanford Radio Hour over
station KGO.
Having pointed to childhood stut
tering as an hereditary character
istic, associated with left-handedness
and twinning, Professor Anderson
iexplained that, although no way is
j known to prevent this early speech
'defect, stuttering which becomes
, mere habit in maturing years may
be cured.
Dr. Anderson further emphasized
the advantage of curing speech dis
orders by restoring confidence and
by applying sound mental hygiene,
rather than by use of such false
remedies as speaking in a whisper,
whistling before difficult words, and
talking with the mouth full of
pebbles.
"There are over one million stut
| terers in the United States at the
present time." he said, pointing out
I that the majority of these were boys
j between the age* of six and ten
, years.
Next week, the Stanford Radio
Hour will present Dr. William L.
[Schwartz as the speaker of the eve
ning.
