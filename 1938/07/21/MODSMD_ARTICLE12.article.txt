# Pollock Says German War Not Imminent
## 
### 
That Hitler will not perpetrate
war in Europe at the present time
was asserted by Dr. James K. Pol
lock, professor of political science at
the University of Michigan and act
ing professor at Stanford this sum
mer in his review and evaluation of
"Five Years of Hitler" on the Tues
day Evening Lecture program.
Though Hitler gained absolute
control in Germany by taking per
sonal command of the army last
February, virtually eliminating the
office of minister of war and further
securing his own position with the
appointment of the loyal Nazi, Von
Ribbentrop, as minister of foreign
affairs, he still fears the army of
Soviet Russia. This is evidenced by
Hitler's statement, "We must re
spect the sheer force of (Russian)
numbers."
Army Peace Instrument
"The Soviet Russian army is one
of the greatest in the world and,
paradoxically enough, is now the
world's greatest instrument for peace
—for it gives Germany pause," stat
ed Dr. Pollock, who was an election
official during the Saar Plebiscite in
January 1935.
Dr. Pollock views the future with
pessimism. He sees no way for Hit
ler to accomplish his announced ob
jective of uniting all Germans in one
great Germany without war. This
belief is. apparently substantiated in
the fact that Belgium, Holland, and
Switzerland are now rearming.
Five Developments
Five outstanding developments in
the last five years in Hitler's Ger
many were cited by Dr. Pollock. A
"common German mentality," one of
the most distressing factors in mod
ern Germany, has been produced. It
is a sad commentary on German
education. "In the days of pre-
Hitler Germany," the speaker said,
"American college students consid
ered graduate study in Germany as
the finishing touch to their educa
tion; today students don't go to Ger
man universities unless as students
of abnormal psychology."
Hitler Achievement
Of the second and most enduring
major achievement directly attribu
table to Hitler, Dr. Pollock said, "He
has unified the German people in
five years, something that no other
leader has been able to accomplish."
The unique way in which the Nazi
party has been incorporated into
the German government is signifi
cant. The process was a rapid one
engineered by Hitler.
Army Effective Bluff
Economic and military mobiliza
tion has gone far in Germany. Dr.
Pollock characterized the German
military machine, which possesses
many weaknesses, an effective
"bluffing weapon." He regards
Germany not as a country which has
an army, but as an army which has
a country. He foresees no danger of
an economic collapse in the near
future.
As the last of the developments
Dr. Pollock indicated the success of
the movement for a bigger popu
lation.
Following the lecture there was a
round-table discussion in the Green
Room. When asked if he thought
Germany would make friends with
France, Professor Pollock replied,
"If they were smart, they'd make
friends with everyone."

engineered by Hitler.
Army Effective Bluff
Economic and military mobiliza
tion has gone far in Germany. Dr.
Pollock characterized the German
military machine, which possesses
many weaknesses, an effective
"bluffing weapon." He regards
Germany not as a country which has
an army, but as an army which has
a country. He foresees no danger of
an economic collapse in the near
future.
As the last of the developments
Dr. Pollock indicated the success of
the movement for a bigger popu
lation.
Following the lecture there was a
round-table discussion in the Green
Room. When asked if he thought
Germany would make friends with
France, Professor Pollock replied,
"If they were smart, they'd make
friends with everyone."
That Hitler will not perpetrate
war in Europe at the present time
was asserted by Dr. James K. Pol
lock, professor of political science at
the University of Michigan and act
ing professor at Stanford this sum
mer in his review and evaluation of
"Five Years of Hitler" on the Tues
day Evening Lecture program.
Though Hitler gained absolute
control in Germany by taking per
sonal command of the army last
February, virtually eliminating the
office of minister of war and further
securing his own position with the
appointment of the loyal Nazi, Von
Ribbentrop, as minister of foreign
affairs, he still fears the army of
Soviet Russia. This is evidenced by
Hitler's statement, "We must re
spect the sheer force of (Russian)
numbers."
Army Peace Instrument
"The Soviet Russian army is one
of the greatest in the world and,
paradoxically enough, is now the
world's greatest instrument for peace
—for it gives Germany pause," stat
ed Dr. Pollock, who was an election
official during the Saar Plebiscite in
January 1935.
Dr. Pollock views the future with
pessimism. He sees no way for Hit
ler to accomplish his announced ob
jective of uniting all Germans in one
great Germany without war. This
belief is. apparently substantiated in
the fact that Belgium, Holland, and
Switzerland are now rearming.
Five Developments
Five outstanding developments in
the last five years in Hitler's Ger
many were cited by Dr. Pollock. A
"common German mentality," one of
the most distressing factors in mod
ern Germany, has been produced. It
is a sad commentary on German
education. "In the days of pre-
Hitler Germany," the speaker said,
"American college students consid
ered graduate study in Germany as
the finishing touch to their educa
tion; today students don't go to Ger
man universities unless as students
of abnormal psychology."
Hitler Achievement
Of the second and most enduring
major achievement directly attribu
table to Hitler, Dr. Pollock said, "He
has unified the German people in
five years, something that no other
leader has been able to accomplish."
The unique way in which the Nazi
party has been incorporated into
the German government is signifi
cant. The process was a rapid one
engineered by Hitler.
