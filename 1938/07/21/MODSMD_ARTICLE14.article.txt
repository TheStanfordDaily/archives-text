# 'ROARING CAMP' OPENS TONIGHT
## Dole, Gillis Star in Play Of Old West THOMAS STEVENS' COMEDY PROMISES TO BE SUCCESS 
### HARRISON STEPHENS 
"Camille in Roaring Camp,''
Thomas Wood Stevens' comedy of
the glittering, blazing West, opens
tonight in the Memorial Theater for
a three-day run. Starring many of
Stanford's best known actors, the
play promises to be one of the fin
est and funniest yet produced in the
new auditorium.
Mr. Stevens has combined two
typical elements of mid-nineteenth
century America to produce one of
the most comic but realistic plays yet
written about this fascinating pe
riod in history. With the country's
whirl-wind expansion during the
Gold Rush days, the two ends of
America developed in almost oppo
site directions. In the East, tremu
lous, fainting ladies, overly-chival
rous gentlemen, and the subtleties
of sparkling wine in dainty goblets
were in vogue. In the West, blatant
women toted six-guns, the men
knew nothing but cards, gold dust
and profanity, and the only known
refreshment was whiskey by the
shot-glass.
East, West Joined
The East was epitomized by the
dramatic taste of the period, the
West by Bret Harte's immortal
Roaring Camp. Mr. Stevens has
brought the two together by having
a traveling company of actors play
Dumas' famous tragedy, "Camille,"
in the incongruous surroundings of
the Roaring Camp saloon.
Janet Dole plays the beautiful
Camille, while Jack Gillis is her
tragic lover. Bud Cady takes the
part of the officious Mr. Clifford and
Shirley Jones plays Camille's schem
ing maid, Nanine. The heavy, Count
de Varville, is played by Virgil
Bergman.
Saloon Is Scene
Some of Bret Harte's most famous
characters watch the saloon show
ing of "Camille." John Oakhurst,
the smooth, soft-spoken gambler, is
played by William Lucas, Jake the
bar-keep by Aubrey Austin, the
Duchess by Patty de Roulf, and Yuba
Bill, the big-shouldered stage driv
er, by J. P. Cahn. George Wood
takes the part of Dungaree Joe,
John Hove that of Stumpy, and Hu
bert Stafflebach the pompous Col
onel Starbottle.
In order to capture the mood of
Roaring Camp, Mr. Stevens has ig
nored the conventional three-act
play form and even the curtain.
When the audience enters the (he
ater, the famous saloon will be open
for business on the stage. Typical
bar-room action will be going on in
pantomime. At 8:30 the action will
begin, and it will continue without
a break through the entire play.
Tickets for "Camille in Roaring
Camp" may be purchased all after
noon today in the Union Cellar.
Prices are 50 cents, 75 cents, and $1.

"Camille in Roaring Camp,''
Thomas Wood Stevens' comedy of
the glittering, blazing West, opens
tonight in the Memorial Theater for
a three-day run. Starring many of
Stanford's best known actors, the
play promises to be one of the fin
est and funniest yet produced in the
new auditorium.
Mr. Stevens has combined two
typical elements of mid-nineteenth
century America to produce one of
the most comic but realistic plays yet
written about this fascinating pe
riod in history. With the country's
whirl-wind expansion during the
Gold Rush days, the two ends of
America developed in almost oppo
site directions. In the East, tremu
lous, fainting ladies, overly-chival
rous gentlemen, and the subtleties
of sparkling wine in dainty goblets
were in vogue. In the West, blatant
women toted six-guns, the men
knew nothing but cards, gold dust
and profanity, and the only known
refreshment was whiskey by the
shot-glass.
East, West Joined
The East was epitomized by the
dramatic taste of the period, the
West by Bret Harte's immortal
Roaring Camp. Mr. Stevens has
brought the two together by having
a traveling company of actors play
Dumas' famous tragedy, "Camille,"
in the incongruous surroundings of
the Roaring Camp saloon.
Janet Dole plays the beautiful
Camille, while Jack Gillis is her
tragic lover. Bud Cady takes the
part of the officious Mr. Clifford and
Shirley Jones plays Camille's schem
ing maid, Nanine. The heavy, Count
de Varville, is played by Virgil
