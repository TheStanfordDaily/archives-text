Slight CHANGE in subject and
speaker for the LUNCHEON today:
Leon Loofbourrow, teacher of social
studies at Menlo School and Junior
College, will defend the NEGATIVE
of the question, "Should Teachers
Join the American Federation of
Teachers?" . . . reason for change:
Willard Beatty of the Office of In
dian Affairs, who was to have
spoken, is a most ELUSIVE CREA
TURE. Have traced him from Wash
ington, D.C., to Riverside, to Ber
keley, to KYBURZ, but not to Stan
ford. . . . The DIFFERENCE be
tween SUMMER SESSION and
REGULAR QUARTERS was just
reported to Dr. Leonard. During the
year the professor comes into class
and says, "Good morning." NO ONE
PAYS ATTENTION. In the sum
mer the professor comes into class,
says "Good morning," and EVERY
ONE WRITES IT DOWN. . . .
Teacher training candidates who ex
pect to get CREDENTIALS at the
end of summer quarter MUST FILE
APPLICATIONS with the credential
secretary by Friday, June 22. . . .
Miss RUTH HENDERSON of Vir
ginia is ILL at her home and cannot
have visitors at this time. . . . Also
on the SICK LIST is Mary White
law, resident assistant at Lagunita,
recuperating from an appendecto
my. . . .
"The School of Trustees and Pub
lic Education" will be discussed by
G. L. Aynesworth, president of the
California School Trustees Associa
tion at 4 o'clock Friday afternoon,
July 22, in Room 50. The meeting
is open to the public.
