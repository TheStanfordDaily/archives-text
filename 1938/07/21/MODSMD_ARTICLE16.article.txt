# Campus to Play New Game
## 
### 
A new game, as yet unnamed, in
vented by George H. Forsythe,
father of two Stanford students, was
introduced to the campus by Coach
John Bunn Monday night at the
Women's Gym. Played on half a
ping-pong table with the paddles and
balls of that game, it incorporates
the back-board of handball and bor
rows certain rules from squash.
Outstanding feature of the game
is its ability to be played, competi
tion included, by one person. The
soloist volleys with himself each
time, returning the ball to the back
board from opposite side of the
court. The ball must bounce only
once on the table. "Just don't let
the left hand know what the right
is doing," Coach Bunn remarked.
Two players lam the ball against
the back-board alternately in such a
way that for each it lands on the
opponent's side of a center parti
tion. Side walls extend forward
from the back-board and may be
hit by the ball on its return from
the back wall. The serve, which
alternates between the players, must
land in front of the service line; a
volley is good anywhere in the op
ponent's half of the court. Game is
21 and only the server scores.
A technique similar to ping pong
is used, although the timing is dif
ferent. A lot of English and speed
may be applied to the shots. By re
moval of the excess boards the table
is restored to regulation ping pong
size. The game is at present set up
in the patio of the Women's Gym,
where students are invited to try it
out.
