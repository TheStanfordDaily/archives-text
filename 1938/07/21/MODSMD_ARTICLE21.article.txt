# Grayson Socks Homer To Put Drivers on Top
## Foreign Legion Wins First Victory, Toros Defeat Wildcats 
### VARICK MARTIN 
Coming to bat with two on in the
last inning with the score tied, Bob
by Grayson poled one of the "nift
iest" home runs ever seen in the
baseball history of the Wheel Chair
League. This put the Slave Driv
ers out in front of the Prune Pick
ers 8 to 6 for the final score, after
the Pickers had made a determined
effort to come back in their half of
the inning.
The hard luck team of the sea
son, the Foreign Legion, finally
overcame its aversion to losing
by one run and managed to
squeeze through to a victory over
the Vantors, 3-2.
To say that the game between
"Woeful" Wildcats and the league
leading El Toros was baseball would
be like saying "Pa" Kennedy got a
home run. It just isn't possible. The
Toros were at bat all afternoon and
would be there yet if the El Toro
summer table bell hadn't rung. The
"Little Pussy Cats" were on the end
of a close 18-3 score.
The Bushmen continued on their
downward plunge by losing to the
Legal Eagles 17-2 in another game
marked by beginners' mistakes.
The massacre in the Black Hole
of Calcutta will be so much
poppy-cock compared to the game
today between the Outlaws and
the "Little Pussy Cats." The
"Pussys" are weak in a helpless
sort of way, and will be fine can
non fodder for the Outlaws.
The Accordians, notwithstanding
"Pa" Kennedy, will have an easy
time with the Bushmen. El Toro
will send their third-stringers
against the Cardinals and will still
come out with a lead resembling
the distance to the sun. The Slave
Drivers and the Legal Eagles will
ease through the Vultures and the
Vantors, respectively.
The best contest should develop
between the Foreign Legion and the
Prune Pickers, with the nod going
to the Pickers.
Other scores for last Tuesday are:
Accordians 6, Cardinals 4
Outlaws 16, Vultures 1.
