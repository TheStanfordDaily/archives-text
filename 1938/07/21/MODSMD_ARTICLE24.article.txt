Gordon Davis, former director of
dramatics at Stanford, has been
back on campus for the past few
days. Mr. Davis has worked with
MGM in Hollywood, the Coburns in
Carmel, New York, and was also
director of the Civic Theater in
Portland. At present he is director
of dramatics at the University of
Arizona.
The exhibit of costume designs
and sketches at the Memorial Art
Gallery is now open to the public
and will remain so for the remain
der of the quarter, according to Mrs.
Helen Green, costume director at
Memorial Theater.

Yesterday's dress rehearsal of "Ca
mille in Roaring Camp" left the fe
male members of the audience in
silent prayer —for the chance to look
like "Camille" Dole, and no wonder.
Wearing a white silk flounced dress
and a broad-brimmed white hat,
Miss Dole must have left the male
members of the audience in some
sort of a prayer, too.
Lee Chapin has us fooled, too.
Acting the part of the Sheriff in the
same play, he was constantly doz
ing, and it looked like the real
thing—well, it was. The script does
n't call for a nap, so come, now, Mr.
Chapin, how would you feel if your
students followed your example?

Designs made by Mrs. Green's be
ginning class in costume design are
being used in "Quality Street" at
the Community Center's Children's
Theater. The play is being directed
by Roy Morgan.

Sonny Taylor, son of Biology
Professor and Mrs. C. V. Taylor,
will play the part of Eliza's son
Harry in "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Har
riet Touton, who plays the part of
the boy's mother, is said to need
practical training in the correct way
to carry a child. John Hove, the
father has a hard time acting nat
ural. (Tsk.)

Lee Chapin and Bob Ross are
among members of the faculty who
have parts in "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
Chapin plays the part of Eva's fa
ther, St. Clare, and is having trou
ble learning to die and like it. Ross
is cast in the role of the lawyer,
Marks, and may be seen carrying an
umbrella while trying to get in
character.
The quartet of jubilee singers,
composed of Chapin, Ross, Cady,
and Cahn is going to sing a group
of old-time favorites including "Ole
Black Joe" and "Call Me Pet
Names."
Speaking of the above, reminds
me that Director Heberer is still
trying to locate a pair of blood
hounds, but will settle for Great
Danes or Mastiffs.
