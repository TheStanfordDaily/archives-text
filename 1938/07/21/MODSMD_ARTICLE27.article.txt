chemistry graduate of Centenary
College, Shreveport, La. (See
Time, May 2).
The history of the western part of
the United States has been filled
with glorious incident. The con
struction of the two famous San'
Francisco Bay bridges makes as in
spiring a chapter as can be found in
the annals of engineering achieve
ment. The indomitable courage of
the Padres, in founding missions in
the inhospitable wilderness, has only
been exceeded by the more indom- j
itable courage of the citizenry in ]
preventing the tourists from spoil- j
ing them. Natural phenomena, such
as the Grand Canyon, vie with un
natural phenomena, such as Holly
wood premieres, in setting new
highs for unqualified grandeur, or
at least expense. It would be diffi
cult indeed to choose from such an
array one manifestation of native
ability of the citizens, and call it su
perior to any other.
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless, if the cordon bleu
must be awarded to some one
achievement, it could probably be
most justly awarded to the one
which had combined the greatest
heights in difficulty with the low
est depths of cunning. And ac
cording to this criterion, the educa
tion of the public to appreciate the
true worth of the West has been
the greatest feat yet.
It is well nigh incredible, but it is
true that, even in New York where
it is not fashionable to know any
thing until age has made the knowl
edge unimportant, people are be
ginning to realize that it is not nec
essary to go armed along the streets
of Los Angeles if one would pro
tect one's valuables; that business
relationships in Phoenix or Reno
are not necessarily consummated be
tween "podners"; that ability to ride
on a horse does not make one either
a hero or a villain; and that it is
not required of a person traveling
from Sacramento to Lake Tahoe that
he ride on a horse at all. This in
formation has, of course, been avail
able through observation during the
greater part of the last century, but
a hundred years is hardly sufficient
for a populace to learn through ob
servation alone. The kinetics by
which this knowledge was acquired
and disseminated would make an in
teresting story, and it is hardly fair
to keep it a secret.
Here Comes the Showboat
In particular, it is not fair to keep
it a secret from the South, for they
are sorely in need of it. Even if

people in Chicago no longer take
out double indemnity policies against
being slaughtered by Indians in an
upper berth before boarding the
Super Chief, they still refuse to get
on the Panama Limited without hip
boots, a book on How to Win Rebels
and Influence Erskine Caldwell, and
two bottles of lotion, a small violet
scented one for mosquito bites, and
a large rose one for unsuccessful
encounters with the alligators. Long
before they reach Memphis, they
have acquired a serious migraine
headache in the vain search for col
ored mammies singing spirituals in
the railway stations, and only con
sole themselves with the thought
that, since it is evening, all the mam
mies must have sailed off on the
show boats (which are likewise ab
sent), for an evening's camp meet
ing.
La Noovell Orlyonze
The next morning finds them all
atwitter with the imminent prospect
of reaching that bit of la vielle
France, New Orleans. Only, one
tourist explains to another adjacent
to him, that it must always be re
ferred to as La Noovell Orlyonze,
so that the people who live there
will know what is meant. None of
the inhabitants speak anything but
French, and very little of that;
about as much as you could learn
off a menu. Nevertheless, like the
Japanese, they are a wonderful
little people, and so historical! It is
common knowledge that the noto
rious LaFitte did not die at all, but
after making the picture took a job
as janitor in one of the dormitories
of Tulane University, under the
name of de Weisbaden. He is there
yet, except on Saturday nights, when
he serves as master of ceremonies at
Galitoire's Restaurant.
An Axis to Grind
This much can be said for the mis
understanding which will en
shroud the South—it could only ex
ist intramurally. If one nation aired
such ideas about another, enraged
notes would fly from one capital to
the other, like missiles, until war
was declared, or one capital ran out
of ink. But fortunately, although
we have a Rome-Berlin axis, we
have no Tallahassee-Trenton, or
Baton Rouge-Boston axes. When
one state offends another, there is
no ambassador to recall except those
semi-official ones occasionally sent
out by chambers of commerce, and
nobody minds them anyway. Con
sequently, it is much easier to blame
economic recessions and mob vio
lence on the South than it is to take
official recognition of the small con
tributions which have been made
along these lines by France in orig

inating the sit-down strike, an insti
tution which is amazingly effective
in inducing either of the two mis
fortunes.
E Pluribus Unum
Certainly, no one could urge the
hurling of invective against foreign
powers just to even things up, but,
on the other hand, it would seem
very logical to try the same effective
procedure intramurally which suc
ceeds intermurally. If fifty million
Frenchmen can't be wrong, twenty
million Southerners ought to be
right 40 per cent of the time, and
most of the other 60 per cent may
not be worth mentioning anyway.
It is useless to ask that people, or
regions, examine themselves before
criticizing others. That isn't human
[ nature. But there has never been a
period in history when the preser
vation of the idea implied in the
national motto, E Pluribus Unum,
was more necessary. And the
avoidance of petty misunderstand
ing among the many is the shortest
path to their unification—a unifica
tion which must be solid if it is to
endure the stresses imposed by
combatant totalitarianism.
