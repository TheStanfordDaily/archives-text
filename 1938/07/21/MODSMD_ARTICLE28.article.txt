# Reading Tested By Opthalmograph
## 
### 
Down in the English Corner base
ment there are two machines used
by A. Eason Monroe to measure and
improve the reading speed and com
prehension of children and adults.
The opthalmograph, which pho
tographs eye movements, is used to
measure speed and record any de
fects in the operation of the eyes.
Once this information is attained,
Mr. Monroe places his victims on an
other machine, known as the me
tronoscope.
The object of this machine is to
get students to read at an even rate,
taking in groups of words at a glance
instead of one at a time. To keep
them from re-reading words, cards
on the front of the machine move in

such a way that each group of words
is visible for only a limited time.
Extensive use of this machine at
Menlo Junior College last year im
proved the reading speed of some
students more than 100 per cent,
according to Mr. Monroe.
