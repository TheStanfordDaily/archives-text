# Cheese It, Kids, The Law's Here
## 
### 
Home after a two weeks' va
cation Gordy Davis, the cam
pus cop, is once more patrol
ling Stanford's shaded lanes.
So no more going around the
post office corner on two
wheels nor 40 on Palm Drive.
Gordy took a trip into the
Kettleman Hills district, where
many of his folks live. He
brought his mother back to his
cabin on Boulder Creek and
spent the rest of his holiday
there. Swimming took up most
of his time, as fishing is taboo,
Gordy states. Of course, a law
officer couldn't ignore a "no
fishing" sign. The Davis family
spends the entire summer in
the cabin away from the cam
pus.
Burns, who has been carrying
on alone in Gordy's absence,
left this week for his vacation.
