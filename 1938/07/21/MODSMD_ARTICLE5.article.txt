# Dr. Durand Discusses Trends Of Modern Air Transport
## Paul Shoup Speaks At Dinner Meeting 
### 
"We shall in time come along to
the point where we will accept the
airplane for its service as we accept
the automobile," said Dr. William
F. Durand, emeritus professor of
mechanical engineering, at the din
ner session of the Business Confer
ence last night.
Speaking on "Modern Trends in
Air Transport," Dr. Durand dis
closed some of the latest develop
ments in range, altitude, and speed
of modern passenger planes. In the
DC4, built in Santa Monica by five
separate companies co-operating, 42
passengers will be carried over a
1000-mile range at a cruising speed
of 220-250 miles an hour. Others
will be able to carry as many as 100
passengers and fly across the At
lantic.
Flying Boats
Dr. Durand also discussed the re
port of the Maritime Commission
made a few years ago in which two
airships, one superliner, and six fly
ing boats were considered. The re
port as Dr. Durand explained it
seemed to show that the flying boats
would be more practical and cheaper
for regular service.
Discussing the future of the air
ship, Dr. Durand said, "We ought
not to give up the airship entirely,"
and continued explaining that the
airship has certain definite advan
tages which should be developed.
The speech was concluded with a
brief mention of autogiros which Dr.
Durand called a "safe family
wagon."
