# PAUL SHOUP ON RAILROADS
## 
### 
"What the railroads need is more
food and less medicine; certainly
less doctors," said Paul Shoup,
president of the Southern Califor
nians, at the dinner meeting of the
Business Conference Tuesday eve
ning.
Mr. Shoup, who was with South
ern Pacific 46 years, said that among
railroad men there is a feeling that
managerial interference on the part
of the Interstate Commerce Com
misison was out of the field and
ability of the Commission.
Problems Told
Discussing "The Outlook for the
Railroads," Mr. Shoup related some
of the major problems in operation
and maintenance, explaining that
because the railroads deal in such
a large volume of business that "it
doesn't take very great change to
take it (the financial condition)
across the lines of prosperity and
adversity."
Government ownership and con
trol of America's transport system
was predicted by Roger Lapham,
chairman of the board, American-
Hawaiian Steamship Company.
Speaking of American shipping, Mr.
Lapham said that he felt the roots
of some of the present evils lay in
the shipbuilding boom during the
World War and the resulting rise in
freight rates. He also indicated that
there is a dangerous note of social-
ism in some of the present legisla
tion.
McElroy Speaks
Floyd McElroy, vice-president and
director, Loomis, Sayles & Co., lead
the discussion Tuesday afternoon on
"Current Problems of Investment
Management" in which he said, "the
problems are solved by interpreta
tion of changing economic, political,
and social factors rather than by ap
plication of any mathematical form
ulas."
It was also pointed out that "In
vestment Counsel firms stress field
research rather than statistical anal
ysis and consider most important the
application of the results of research
to the specific and constantly vary
ing requirements of the individual
plant as to safety of his capital and
the necessary return provide an ade
quate purchasing power income so
that he may, under conditions of de
flation, maintain his standard of liv
ing."
