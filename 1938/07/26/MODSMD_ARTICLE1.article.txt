# THE
						CAMPUS
## LECTURE Colonial Music 
### 
"Music in American Colonial
Life" will be discussed by Dr.
Carleton Sprague Smith in con
junction with selections to be sung
by the Stanford University Choir
on the Tuesday Evening Lecture
Series program tonight at Memo
rial Hall.
Dr. Smith, who last Monday
played his flute with the Roth
Quartet, studied that instrument in
Paris before attending Harvard
where he received his A.B. and
M.A. degrees. In 1928 he was a
John Harvard Fellow, and the fol
lowing year was awarded a Wood
bury Lowery Traveling Fellow
ship. He received his Ph.D. from
the University of Vienna in 1930
and returned to the United States
to serve as instructor in history at
Columbia University for the suc
ceeding four years.
Dr. Smith's interest and activity
in bibliographical work at Har
vard led to his appointment as chief
of the music division of the New
York Public Library in 1931. Three
years ago he attended the Inter
national Music Education Con
gress at Prague as an official dele
gate from the United States.
A member of the Stanford sum
mer faculty, Dr. Smith teaches a
course in "Music in American Cul
ture." From the materials in the
New York Public Library Dr.
Smith has unearthed a great deal
of the fine old music which has
been lost or neglected in the last
century and a half. Dr. Smith is
anxious to displace the notion that
the Puritan forefathers were un
musical. In reality music, and
particularly singing, was an im
portant part of their lives.
To revive music native to certain
sections of the country is one of
the aims of Dr. Smith's work.
Since his arrival in California this
summer he has discovered some
old mission music of a Flemish
composer which came to Califor
nia by way of Mexico.
Dr. Smith's talk this evening will
concern the origin of this early
music, the way in which it was
used at that time, and the way it
may be utilized today. The illus
trations by the Choir will include
two settings of psalms by Claude
Goudimel, one by Claude Legeune
found in the Ainsworth Psalter,
and a Fugue Tune found in the
Original Sacred Harp.
