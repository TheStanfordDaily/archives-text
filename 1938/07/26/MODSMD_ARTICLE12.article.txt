# 'Camille' Review
## By KATHARINE PAGE and HARRISON STEPHENS 
### 
If you sat it out for 20 minutes,
you saw "Camille in Roaring
Camp"; if you sneaked out for
that cigarette and somehow got
lost, you only saw "Camille."
Which is a rather cruel way of
saying that the point of last week
end's campus play was lost during
that first important fraction which
swings an audience either for or
against it.
The story of "Camille in Roar
ing Camp" was an invasion of
Bret Harte's famous mining camp
by a tremulous and destitute com
pany of actors. After the tragedy
had plugged along for two acts,
the miners in the saloon began to
react, and with the atmosphere of
Roaring Camp at last making itself
felt, Mr. Stevens' comedy hit a
lively pace that didn't let down
again.
Apparently injecting his own in
terpretation, Jack Gillis did a
beautiful job of over-playing the
languishing lover, Armand, and,
without carrying it to the slap
stick stage, got most of the laughs
of the evening. Vergil Bergman as

the Count de Varville seemed to
gain momentum in the same di
rection, and in the last half of the
play nearly twirled his mustache
as the sneering heavy. But Janet
Dole pointed to the opposite ex
treme and gave a chilly interpre
tation of the fragile, emotional Ca
mille. With all the others play
ing their parts straight, the audi
ence was somewhat bewildered as
to just what the actors were at
tempting to put across.
High point of the bar-room ac
tion was Bud Cady's playing of
Mr. Clifford, the officious manager
of the company. Stepping into a
hesitant portrayal of rough west
erners in the Bret Harte saloon,
he seemed to sweep up to the loose
ends of the stumbling action and
take over the scene with his ever
capable acting.
"Special music! songs in the
entr'actes" featured Shirley Jones,
who played Nanine, doing a swell
job on a tear-jerking ballad,
Georganna Martin swinging the
miners into a good old favorite,
and Jack Gillis sparkling again in
one of the best laughs of the eve
ning with his timid rendition of
"Frankie and Johnnie." Gold badge
of the minor role department
should go to Ted Hatlen for a su
perb interpretation of Props, the
company's handyman.
