## Track Stars Win

Surprising indeed was news
from Stockholm that Pete Zagar,
Stanford's 220 - pound football
tackle and weight man, had as
sisted nobly in winning a relay
from a crack Swedish team.
A share of the honors must go,
however, to Zagar's three team
mates, Ben Johnson of Columbia
University, Ray Malott of Stan
ford, and Freddie Wolcott of Rice
Institute, reputed to be the fastest
men in the United States and per
haps in the world.
Malott proved to be the out
standing performer at the three
day international meet by break
ing two Swedish records in run
ning the 400 meters in 47.8 and
coming within a fifth of a second
of Charley Paddock's world rec
ord in the 300 meters when he ran
that distance in 33.4.
Zagar found the record-holding
Swedish weight-tossers too much
for him and placed fifth behind
several Swedish discus throws of
over 170 feet.
