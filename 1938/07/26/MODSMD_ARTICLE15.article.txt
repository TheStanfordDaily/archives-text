New honors came to Stanford
golfers over the last week - end
both at home and in the East.
Warren Berl, a freshman of last
year, completely surprised all
those "in the know," winning the
Stanford Golf Club Invitational
Tournament by beating Bud Fin
ger, outstanding junior player from
Menlo, 2 and 3.
Perhaps even more unusual was
the earlier victory that Berl rang
up over crack golfer Peiper of San
Jose who was the pre-tournament
favorite.
Coach Eddie Twiggs watched
Berl hit long drives and make
beautiful approaches. With the
addition of Berl to the National
Championship Cardinal team, the
hopes of Stanford for next season
were reflected in Coach Twiggs'
grin.
From the East word was received
that Stanford's number one golfer,
Art Doering, had qualified for the
Chicago Open with a 73, a good
score in any league. Sam Snead
was low with an amazing 64.
