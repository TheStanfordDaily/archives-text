All teams doped by the sports
department came through with
victories last Tuesday. With two
exceptions in the games between
the Cardinals and El Toro and the
Slave Drivers and the Vultures
the favorites produced great quan
tities of runs.
The Cardinals, who have sud
denly sprung to life, battled an
over-confident El Toro team to a
standstill for seven innings, then
lost by a one-run margin on a
lucky play by the Toros, 12-11.
The Vultures surprised in turn
by coming within one run of the
rapidly slipping and at-one-time
good Slave Drivers when they lost
10-9.
The best play of the day devel
oped when big A1 Churchman of
the Accordians, who was formerly
all-conference tackle from San
Diego State, hit a nice drive to
center field and started off at a
gallop for first base. As he rounded
first, he saw a chance to make
second. Gathering his 235 pounds
into a knot of tetra-ethyl, Church
man slid for the keystone. He
reached it, but he kept on sliding,
and wound up in left field. The
play did not materially affect the
score of the game, which the Stom
ach Steinways won from the Bush
men, 19-6.
The Prune Pickers, on the re
bound after their loss on Tuesday,
took the Foreign Legion 9 to 2,
while the Legal Eagles swarmed
over the tobogganing Vantors 18-4.
The games scheduled for today
have been postponed to tomor
row. A conference at Mills College
interferes with the regular set-up.
The best contests of the Wed

nesday series should be the battles
between the Outlaws and the
Prune Pickers, both first division
teams, and that between the pro
fessorial delegation and the re
juvenated Cardinals, who have
vowed not to lose another contest.
The Accordians should have a
tough time with the Wildcats, for
the cellar club has been reinforced
by a crew from the Daily office,
who promise to make the Accor
dians fold up once more. The Ac
cordians have announced, how
ever, that no bunch of reporters is
going to break their winning
streak.
The Vantors and the Bushmen,
both teams with long losing
streaks, will have to decide which
can lose more often when they
meet. The other two games should
see easy victories for top-ranking
teams, the Legal Eagles over the
Vultures and El Toro over the
Foreign Legion.
"Czar" Hand announced yester
day that several teams are still
playing with only eight or nine
men, and any recruits can be sure
of playing a full game. Any men
who want to play are requested to
report to Diamond F at 5 o'clock
Wednesday afternoon, where they
will be assigned to a team.

The Cardinals, who have sud
denly sprung to life, battled an
over-confident El Toro team to a
standstill for seven innings, then
lost by a one-run margin on a
lucky play by the Toros, 12-11.
The Vultures surprised in turn
by coming within one run of the
rapidly slipping and at-one-time
good Slave Drivers when they lost
10-9.
The best play of the day devel
oped when big A1 Churchman of
the Accordians, who was formerly
all-conference tackle from San
Diego State, hit a nice drive to
center field and started off at a
gallop for first base. As he rounded
first, he saw a chance to make
second. Gathering his 235 pounds
into a knot of tetra-ethyl, Church
man slid for the keystone. He
reached it, but he kept on sliding,
and wound up in left field. The
play did not materially affect the
score of the game, which the Stom
ach Steinways won from the Bush
men, 19-6.
The Prune Pickers, on the re
bound after their loss on Tuesday,
took the Foreign Legion 9 to 2,
while the Legal Eagles swarmed
over the tobogganing Vantors 18-4.
The games scheduled for today
have been postponed to tomor
row. A conference at Mills College
interferes with the regular set-up.
The best contests of the Wed

nesday series should be the battles
between the Outlaws and the
Prune Pickers, both first division
teams, and that between the pro
fessorial delegation and the re
juvenated Cardinals, who have
vowed not to lose another contest.
The Accordians should have a
tough time with the Wildcats, for
the cellar club has been reinforced
by a crew from the Daily office,
who promise to make the Accor
dians fold up once more. The Ac
cordians have announced, how
ever, that no bunch of reporters is
going to break their winning
streak.
The Vantors and the Bushmen,
both teams with long losing
streaks, will have to decide which
can lose more often when they
meet. The other two games should
see easy victories for top-ranking
teams, the Legal Eagles over the
Vultures and El Toro over the
Foreign Legion.
"Czar" Hand announced yester
day that several teams are still
playing with only eight or nine
men, and any recruits can be sure
of playing a full game. Any men
who want to play are requested to
report to Diamond F at 5 o'clock
Wednesday afternoon, where they
will be assigned to a team.
All teams doped by the sports
department came through with
victories last Tuesday. With two
exceptions in the games between
the Cardinals and El Toro and the
Slave Drivers and the Vultures
the favorites produced great quan
tities of runs.
