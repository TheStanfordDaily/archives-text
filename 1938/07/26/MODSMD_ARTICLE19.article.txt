I wonder whether we in educa
tion realize how fortunate we are
in the selection of our environ
ment. Our salaries may be lower
than those of other professions, but
we have more abundant opportu
nities for learning than almost any
other group of workers. Learning
is our business. The best books
of the past and present are avail
able to us. Newspapers and peri
odicals are generally at hand.
There are many opportunities to
see good plays and to hear good
music. Then, too, we have excel
lent opportunities for conversation
with other individuals who are also
learning.
There is one aspect of learning
that we as teachers have tended to
neglect somewhat. We tend to
rely too much on reading, writing,
and talking and too little on do
ing. Many of us restrict our activi
ties to a narrow field of research
or teaching, and in our zest for de
tails we lose sight of the richness
and variety of experience that is
open to modern man. Oftentimes
specialization becomes so narrow
as to become sterile because its
meaning in relation to living is
lost. Then, too, by emphasizing the
intellectual aspects of life many of
us separate ourselves from the ac
tivities of workers in other fields.
Yet, in spite of these inadequa
cies, teachers are especially favored
in their educational environments.
Children of teachers are likewise
favored. The teacher's family of
today might be compared to the
preacher's family of an earlier pe
riod. In both children have added
opportunities to read and to con
verse. Forgetting these educational
opportunities of our children, many
of us tend to overemphasize their
intelligence. We forget that our
children may be intelligent because
they have the opportunity to get
the basic experiences requisite to
good thinking.
But the children of tenant farm
ers, of miners in company towns,
of families in city slums have dif
ferent environments. These chil
dren have few chances to contact

the richness and variety of modern
life. Often to a limited environ
ment is added poor food, inade
quate shelter, and disease. It is
easy to condemn these children by
saying that their heredity is poor.
It is much more difficult to face the
fact that their intelligence appears
to be low because their experience
has been limited, and to devise
educational and social means to
broaden and expand their mental
and emotional horizons. Heredity
is, no doubt, a conditioning factor
in individual ability. But I do not
feel that we can take the position
in America that the masses of our
people cannot think until we really
give them equality of opportunities
in securing educational experi
ences, not only in the school, but
in the home and community as
well. In many cases today we are
increasing the handicaps of under
privileged youth by adding to lim
ited home and community expe
riences, limited school experiences
as well.
The problem of raising living
standards and increasing educa
tional experiences is not one that
can be solved by teachers alone.
But we, as teachers, do have a re
sponsibility to think through our
points of view in relation to this
problem and to act as effectively
as possible, both as teachers and
as citizens, to make equality of
educational opportunity a fact
rather than a theory in American
culture.
