"Many of the corporation repre
sentatives who attended the busi
ness conference expressed the de
sire to send more men to the one
next year," stated Dean Hugh
Jackson in summary of the second
annual conference of the Graduate
School of Business which closed
Friday at luncheon after a week's
activity.
E. B. MacNaughton, president of
the First National Bank of Port
land, brought the conference to a
close with his speech, "Tomorrow
'Is a New Day." Discussing the
present situation, MacNaughton
said, "The most difficult and im
porant problem facing us is to get
an understanding of human beha
vior. One of our greatest faults is

that we have treated men as a
commodity which could almost be
turned on and off like water at a
faucet."
Arthur H. Young, until recently
vice-president of the United States
Steel Corporation, speaking in the
morning on "Management's Re
sponsibility in Industrial Relations"
advised the business men, "Work
with your men, not for them or at
them. That can be done and will
pay tremendous dividends."
The dividends, he suggested,
would come from reduced turn
over, reduction of industrial acci
dents, and the minimizing of fric
tions leading to costly disputes such
as are involved in collective bar
gaining.
"The American workman wants
to believe," Young said, "that he is
working at a good job, for a good
boss, and that he is getting a
square deal. If he is satisfied about
those things, I don't believe he will
care a great deal about collective
bargaining on a mass basis."
Speaking on collective bargaining
as a solution to the labor problem,
Almon E. Roth, president of the
Waterfront Employers' Association
of the Pacific Coast, pointed to the
work done by his organization in
the past 18 months to relieve the
situation in the shipping trade.
Roth reminded his audience that
the employers on the coast were
forced to organize by their em
ployees who wanted them to as
sume responsibility. He claimed
that good relations can be obtained
if two well-organized units are
formed. Roth also claimed that if
they could do it in the shipping
business, other empolyers could do
the same.
Forecasting future labor legis
lation in this country regarding in
timidation of men, Roth said, "I
think we're going to have legisla
tion in this country like that in
England and other countries where
certain types of union activities
are outlawed."

Warning the business men that
(he nation's oil resources would
last only twelve or fifteen years
at the present rate of production,
William H. Berg, president of the
Standard Oil Company of Califor
nia, advocated some kind of regu
lation of the oil business, but said
he did not favor government con
trol. His suggestion was some
sort of regulation of each field such
as that now used in Texas and
Kansas.
"Sales Standards and Their Ac
complishment" were discussed on
Thursday afternoon by Richard
Hillard, vice-president of the Par
affine Companies, Inc., who out
lined the system used by his com
pany and made suggestions for
general sales plans.
Other talks during the confer
ence included MacNaughton's dis
cussion of "The Banks and The
Government," Robert Buchanan's
analysis of "Federal and California
Taxes," and others.

Speaking on collective bargaining
as a solution to the labor problem,
Almon E. Roth, president of the
Waterfront Employers' Association
of the Pacific Coast, pointed to the
work done by his organization in
the past 18 months to relieve the
situation in the shipping trade.
Roth reminded his audience that
the employers on the coast were
forced to organize by their em
ployees who wanted them to as
sume responsibility. He claimed
that good relations can be obtained
if two well-organized units are
formed. Roth also claimed that if
they could do it in the shipping
business, other empolyers could do
the same.
Forecasting future labor legis
lation in this country regarding in
timidation of men, Roth said, "I
think we're going to have legisla
tion in this country like that in
England and other countries where
certain types of union activities
are outlawed."

Warning the business men that
(he nation's oil resources would
last only twelve or fifteen years
at the present rate of production,
William H. Berg, president of the
Standard Oil Company of Califor
nia, advocated some kind of regu
lation of the oil business, but said
he did not favor government con
trol. His suggestion was some
sort of regulation of each field such
as that now used in Texas and
Kansas.
"Sales Standards and Their Ac
complishment" were discussed on
Thursday afternoon by Richard
Hillard, vice-president of the Par
affine Companies, Inc., who out
lined the system used by his com
pany and made suggestions for
general sales plans.
Other talks during the confer
ence included MacNaughton's dis
cussion of "The Banks and The
Government," Robert Buchanan's
analysis of "Federal and California
Taxes," and others.
"Many of the corporation repre
sentatives who attended the busi
ness conference expressed the de
sire to send more men to the one
next year," stated Dean Hugh
Jackson in summary of the second
annual conference of the Graduate
School of Business which closed
Friday at luncheon after a week's
activity.
E. B. MacNaughton, president of
the First National Bank of Port
land, brought the conference to a
close with his speech, "Tomorrow
'Is a New Day." Discussing the
present situation, MacNaughton
said, "The most difficult and im
porant problem facing us is to get
an understanding of human beha
vior. One of our greatest faults is

that we have treated men as a
commodity which could almost be
turned on and off like water at a
faucet."
Arthur H. Young, until recently
vice-president of the United States
Steel Corporation, speaking in the
morning on "Management's Re
sponsibility in Industrial Relations"
advised the business men, "Work
with your men, not for them or at
them. That can be done and will
pay tremendous dividends."
The dividends, he suggested,
would come from reduced turn
over, reduction of industrial acci
dents, and the minimizing of fric
tions leading to costly disputes such
as are involved in collective bar
gaining.
"The American workman wants
to believe," Young said, "that he is
working at a good job, for a good
boss, and that he is getting a
square deal. If he is satisfied about
those things, I don't believe he will
care a great deal about collective
bargaining on a mass basis."
