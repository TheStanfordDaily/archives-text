# Ghosting the Stanford Honor System
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In The Daily published July 19
I found the following ad which has
made me very mad because it has
cut into my business: "Ghost
service writers help students in
preparing and editing theses, es
says, speeches, etc. Expert. Rea
sonable."
It had seemed to me that The
Daily was well supplied with ads,
but when the business manager
begins to accept ads like this, he
is either greedy or in need of busi
ness.
Here I was, sitting pretty at
Stanford. I had a nice business
worked up selling English themes,
Chaucer reports, dramatic criti
cisms, and now you come along
and spoil it all.

Of course, I realize that on one
side of the question there is the
honor code tradition, certified ex
aminations, no cheating, and such.
But as soon as I got here I found
that I was at a pretty bad disad
vantage taking an examination in,
say, the Econ department, where
the fraternities had complete files
of all the previous exams. There
was no honor code observance here
of this obviously unfair filing. Sour
grapes? Maybe.
And then I found out that I was
only the member of a huge con
spiracy of professors and parents
to get the students their children
through school at almost any price.
Some of it payable to me. And it's
not my fault that this particular
culture demands a college educa

tion for WE gifted children.
Then, too, I feel that I have been
a definite psychological help to the
morale of the students. No longer
do they have to worry whether
their term paper will get a C or a
B. I can guarantee the grade or
money back. Think what a help
that is to some co-ed when it
comes time for whole-hearted root
ing at a football game.
So Mr. Stepp, since The Daily
is one of the most prosperous fi
nancial successes on the campus,
please refrain from printing ads
that destroy others' prosperity. I
have to get some of that NYA
money somehow.
Yours truly,
Campus Ghostwriter
