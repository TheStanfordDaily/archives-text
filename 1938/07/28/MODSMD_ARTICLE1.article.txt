# Radio Dramas Banned by Broadcasting Companies
## THE 						CAMPUS THIS WEEK Plays Banned 
### 
The National Broadcasting Com
pany and the Columbia Broad
casting System have refused to let
the Stanford Dramatists put two
radio plays on the air. The plays
were "Camaradas" by Norman
Evanson and "The Last One" by
Bessie Collins. Both plays were
banned because the broadcasting
companies thought they were too
controversial and would cause too
much comment.
"Camaradas," one of a quartet of
plays called "Salud Espana," deals
with the present Spanish Revolu
tion and leans toward the Loyalist
side.
"The Last One" is a sort of con
troversial miracle play dealing with
the collapse of the universe, and is
built around the passing of the
last Jew.
According to Dr. Margery Bailey,
head of the Dramatists, "TTie plays
have great poetic interest. They
are not overly propagandized, but
pack too much punch." Dr. Bailey
also said that the two plays might
be read on the program surround
ing the presentation of the prize
of the Maxwell Anderson Verse-
Drama Contest.
