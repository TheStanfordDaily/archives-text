Speaking on "Music in American
Life" Tuesday evening in Memo
rial Hall, Dr. Carleton Sprague
Smith was accompanied by 25
mixed voices of the Stanford Uni
versity Choir.
Dr. Smith stated that the Amer
ican shouldn't try to force a taste
for Bach and Beethoven and other
great composers because an ap
preciation for American music
should be cultivated first. He also
said that music should fit the needs
of the people just as architecture
does. This applies to literature,
too, he remarked, just as we study
European literature; but real
American literature such as "Tom
Sawyer" comes naturally.
Raymond Kendall, assistant or
ganist, led the Universty Choir in
psalms and a Fuguetune.
"Music in American Culture" is
a course which Dr. Smith is teach
ing this summer. Since his arrival
in California this summer, he has

of a Flemish composer which
came to California by way of
Mexico.
