# The 						Passing of Joyce Kilmer
## 
### EDGAR FRIEDENBERG 
Science, like any other industry
governed by a stable group of cir
cumstances, has both stock and
transient problems. The deep, and
sometimes faintly ridiculous stud
ies concerning such weighty and
empire-shaking matters as the cor
relations between head size and
sex difference in the chameleon, or
the rate of heart beat in the blue
crab, Callinectes Sapidus, arise,
and are concluded, bringing inti
mations of immortality to the re
search workers who were haunted
by them, but seldom anything more
concrete. Opposed to these prob
lems are found such eternal
sources of conjecture as the origin
of life, the effect of cosmic rays on
life if any, the release of the vast
but unusable energy locked up
within the atomic structure, and fi
nally, the synthesis of chlorophyll,
and its use in the artificial prepa
ration of carbohydrates, suitable
for all the uses to which natural
ones may be put.
The final solution of any one of
these problems is capable of pro
ducing such changes in the fabric
of certain aspects of human civi
lization as to make that aspect al
most totally unrecognizable to any
person who knew it before the
change occurred. Such a denoue
ment is therefore an event to be
anticipated with the keenest in
terest, and apprehension. Research
es along the various lines men
tioned are in widely varying de
grees of completion, and it is prob
able that none of them are far
enough advanced to have serious
public implications as yet. The
last of these mighty queries, how
ever, is of particular interest to
citizens of Stanford Univei'sity,
and the Peninsula as a whole,
since it is slowly being unraveled
by the Carnegie Institute here on
the campus.
Speculation is usually a waste of

time, and is not regarded with fa
vor by those few unfortunates who
regard this as of itself sinful. Men
tal speculation, as distinguished
from economic speculation, how
ever, is usually pretty cheap en
tertainment, and has been known
to lead to any number of things.
We might, therefore, consider what
the most probable result will be,
when this matter of artificial pho
tosynthesis is brought under lab
oratory control, and put at the
mercy of all scientists, capable and
foolish, communist and fascist. If
we do have an idea of what may
be brought about, perhaps we can
be saved a number of rather un
fortunate surprises.
In the first place, it would seem
that, if we can put the poor, un
organized plant bodily out of the
economic picture, untold blessing
would result. When starch could
be made in the laboratory more
cheaply than in the field, the
chances of class-wide starvation
would be much reduced. Every
body, from Marie Antoinette to the
Wonder Baker, would be better off,
if flour were a product of waste
factory gasses and electric light.
The have-not nations would have
just as much pastry as the have
nations, even if the have nations
did call theirs Crepes Suzettes,
while the have-not nations were
content with Pfannkuchen. True,
the center of flour production
would change from Kansas to Jer
sey City, and the Kansans would
be reduced to living on the scant
revenues affoi'ded by passing tour
ists, but this would certainly make
them more hospitable. Likewise,
the tree would soon become a
relic, like the horse and buggy, or
Landon, but this could not pos
sibly bother anyone except Joyce
Kilmer and the CCC, and the
CCC could as readily chop
trees down as plant them, and
with even less training. Our cel
lulose supply would depend no
longer on the erratic fortunes of

nature, but would be constant, if
not inexhaustible. It would there
fore afford a much safer field for
economic manipulation, which ev
erybody agrees collaborates with
love in making the world go
round.
We noted above that the conse
quent cheapening of food in per
calorie prices would be inimical to
classwide starvation. Nevetheless,
those rugged individualists, the
farmers, would not find the re
placement of wheat altogether
beneficial. They would doubtless
become, quite quietly, afflicted in
dividuals, instead of, quite noisily,
a downtrodden class, for such has
been the habit of the agricultur
alist for centuries past, but they
would still constitute quite a prob
lem for the well-being of the
country. It would probably be
necessary finally to turn their
farms into landscaped gardens at
government expense, so that their
decadence might at least enact it
self against a background of gen
tility.
Of course, all this speculation
might be perfectly useless pessi
mism, for the artificial photosyn
â€¢thetic process might be more ex
pensive than the natural. In that
case, there would be no visible eco
nomic results of the development
of artificial photosynthesis, until
war, or some other isolating agen
cy, foi'ced the burden of economic
self-sufficiency on an unprepared
country. Then, by turning their
fields into factories, and praying
for the absence of cloudy weather,
they might be able to hold out for
months after they would otherwise
have succumbed, finally greeting
their nemesis in the form of pel
lagra, and other deficiency diseas
es, instead of total depletion. Be
fore this occurred, of course, the
great increase in the possibilities
of high explosive synthesis would
have made heights of destruction
possible which even today, when
destruction is a popular fine art,

cannot be attained.
Of course, the development of
artificial photosynthesis is not bad.
Nothing that science ever finds out
can be either good or bad. The
best it can be is true or false. For
this reason, science is frequently
blamed for situations which are
entirely beyond its control.
What then is the answer? Should
the research be abandoned? The
answer is, of course, no. Even if
world-wide abandonment could be
attained, thus aveiiing the dan
gers from every quarter, the an
swer would still be no. Not since
the time of Macbeth has any nation,
or group profited by letting I dare
not wait upon I would, like the cat
i' the adage.
This may sound impossible; but

it is actually only sensible. No
body expects automobiles to be
held to the 1915 level, in order to
prevent speeding. That is the work
of government, namely, the police.
Likewise, when the Stanford sci
entists reach the end of their inves
tigations, they should not be
saddled with the responsibility of
seeing that it is correctly used.
That would be not only unfair, but
impossible.
But if we carefully consider be
forehand all the possible results,
then, when the conclusions may be
revealed in the full glory of great
scientific progress, an interested
government may step in and pro
tect its people, and all others, from
any harmful repercussions. And in
this way, by supplementing sci
ence, but not restraining it, both
government and economics may
reach their most profound tri
umphs.

lulose supply would depend no
longer on the erratic fortunes of

nature, but would be constant, if
not inexhaustible. It would there
fore afford a much safer field for
economic manipulation, which ev
erybody agrees collaborates with
love in making the world go
round.
We noted above that the conse
quent cheapening of food in per
calorie prices would be inimical to
classwide starvation. Nevetheless,
those rugged individualists, the
farmers, would not find the re
placement of wheat altogether
beneficial. They would doubtless
become, quite quietly, afflicted in
dividuals, instead of, quite noisily,
a downtrodden class, for such has
been the habit of the agricultur
alist for centuries past, but they
would still constitute quite a prob
lem for the well-being of the
country. It would probably be
necessary finally to turn their
farms into landscaped gardens at
government expense, so that their
decadence might at least enact it
self against a background of gen
tility.
Of course, all this speculation
might be perfectly useless pessi
mism, for the artificial photosyn
â€¢thetic process might be more ex
pensive than the natural. In that
case, there would be no visible eco
nomic results of the development
of artificial photosynthesis, until
war, or some other isolating agen
cy, foi'ced the burden of economic
self-sufficiency on an unprepared
country. Then, by turning their
fields into factories, and praying
for the absence of cloudy weather,
they might be able to hold out for
months after they would otherwise
have succumbed, finally greeting
their nemesis in the form of pel
lagra, and other deficiency diseas
es, instead of total depletion. Be
fore this occurred, of course, the
great increase in the possibilities
of high explosive synthesis would
have made heights of destruction
possible which even today, when
destruction is a popular fine art,

cannot be attained.
Of course, the development of
artificial photosynthesis is not bad.
Nothing that science ever finds out
can be either good or bad. The
best it can be is true or false. For
this reason, science is frequently
blamed for situations which are
entirely beyond its control.
What then is the answer? Should
the research be abandoned? The
answer is, of course, no. Even if
world-wide abandonment could be
attained, thus aveiiing the dan
gers from every quarter, the an
swer would still be no. Not since
the time of Macbeth has any nation,
or group profited by letting I dare
not wait upon I would, like the cat
i' the adage.
This may sound impossible; but

it is actually only sensible. No
body expects automobiles to be
held to the 1915 level, in order to
prevent speeding. That is the work
of government, namely, the police.
Likewise, when the Stanford sci
entists reach the end of their inves
tigations, they should not be
saddled with the responsibility of
seeing that it is correctly used.
That would be not only unfair, but
impossible.
But if we carefully consider be
forehand all the possible results,
then, when the conclusions may be
revealed in the full glory of great
scientific progress, an interested
government may step in and pro
tect its people, and all others, from
any harmful repercussions. And in
this way, by supplementing sci
ence, but not restraining it, both
government and economics may
reach their most profound tri
umphs.
Science, like any other industry
governed by a stable group of cir
cumstances, has both stock and
transient problems. The deep, and
sometimes faintly ridiculous stud
ies concerning such weighty and
empire-shaking matters as the cor
relations between head size and
sex difference in the chameleon, or
the rate of heart beat in the blue
crab, Callinectes Sapidus, arise,
and are concluded, bringing inti
mations of immortality to the re
search workers who were haunted
by them, but seldom anything more
concrete. Opposed to these prob
lems are found such eternal
sources of conjecture as the origin
of life, the effect of cosmic rays on
life if any, the release of the vast
but unusable energy locked up
within the atomic structure, and fi
nally, the synthesis of chlorophyll,
and its use in the artificial prepa
ration of carbohydrates, suitable
for all the uses to which natural
ones may be put.
The final solution of any one of
these problems is capable of pro
ducing such changes in the fabric
of certain aspects of human civi
lization as to make that aspect al
most totally unrecognizable to any
person who knew it before the
change occurred. Such a denoue
ment is therefore an event to be
anticipated with the keenest in
terest, and apprehension. Research
es along the various lines men
tioned are in widely varying de
grees of completion, and it is prob
able that none of them are far
enough advanced to have serious
public implications as yet. The
last of these mighty queries, how
ever, is of particular interest to
citizens of Stanford Univei'sity,
and the Peninsula as a whole,
since it is slowly being unraveled
by the Carnegie Institute here on
the campus.
Speculation is usually a waste of

time, and is not regarded with fa
vor by those few unfortunates who
regard this as of itself sinful. Men
tal speculation, as distinguished
from economic speculation, how
ever, is usually pretty cheap en
tertainment, and has been known
to lead to any number of things.
We might, therefore, consider what
the most probable result will be,
when this matter of artificial pho
tosynthesis is brought under lab
oratory control, and put at the
mercy of all scientists, capable and
foolish, communist and fascist. If
we do have an idea of what may
be brought about, perhaps we can
be saved a number of rather un
fortunate surprises.
In the first place, it would seem
that, if we can put the poor, un
organized plant bodily out of the
economic picture, untold blessing
would result. When starch could
be made in the laboratory more
cheaply than in the field, the
chances of class-wide starvation
would be much reduced. Every
body, from Marie Antoinette to the
Wonder Baker, would be better off,
if flour were a product of waste
factory gasses and electric light.
The have-not nations would have
just as much pastry as the have
nations, even if the have nations
did call theirs Crepes Suzettes,
while the have-not nations were
content with Pfannkuchen. True,
the center of flour production
would change from Kansas to Jer
sey City, and the Kansans would
be reduced to living on the scant
revenues affoi'ded by passing tour
ists, but this would certainly make
them more hospitable. Likewise,
the tree would soon become a
relic, like the horse and buggy, or
Landon, but this could not pos
sibly bother anyone except Joyce
Kilmer and the CCC, and the
CCC could as readily chop
trees down as plant them, and
with even less training. Our cel
lulose supply would depend no

ies concerning such weighty and
empire-shaking matters as the cor
relations between head size and
sex difference in the chameleon, or
the rate of heart beat in the blue
crab, Callinectes Sapidus, arise,
and are concluded, bringing inti

sources of conjecture as the origin
of life, the effect of cosmic rays on

and its use in the artificial prepa
ration of carbohydrates, suitable
for all the uses to which natural

The final solution of any one of

able that none of them are far
enough advanced to have serious

Speculation is usually a waste of

time, and is not regarded with fa
vor by those few unfortunates who
regard this as of itself sinful. Men
tal speculation, as distinguished
from economic speculation, how
ever, is usually pretty cheap en
tertainment, and has been known
to lead to any number of things.
We might, therefore, consider what
the most probable result will be,
when this matter of artificial pho
tosynthesis is brought under lab
oratory control, and put at the
mercy of all scientists, capable and
foolish, communist and fascist. If
we do have an idea of what may
be brought about, perhaps we can
be saved a number of rather un
fortunate surprises.
In the first place, it would seem
that, if we can put the poor, un
organized plant bodily out of the
economic picture, untold blessing
would result. When starch could
be made in the laboratory more
cheaply than in the field, the
chances of class-wide starvation
would be much reduced. Every
body, from Marie Antoinette to the
Wonder Baker, would be better off,
if flour were a product of waste
factory gasses and electric light.
The have-not nations would have
just as much pastry as the have
nations, even if the have nations
did call theirs Crepes Suzettes,
while the have-not nations were
content with Pfannkuchen. True,
the center of flour production
would change from Kansas to Jer
sey City, and the Kansans would
be reduced to living on the scant
revenues affoi'ded by passing tour
ists, but this would certainly make
them more hospitable. Likewise,
the tree would soon become a
relic, like the horse and buggy, or
Landon, but this could not pos
sibly bother anyone except Joyce
Kilmer and the CCC, and the
CCC could as readily chop
trees down as plant them, and
with even less training. Our cel
lulose supply would depend no
longer on the erratic fortunes of

nature, but would be constant, if
not inexhaustible. It would there
fore afford a much safer field for
economic manipulation, which ev
erybody agrees collaborates with
love in making the world go
round.
We noted above that the conse
quent cheapening of food in per
calorie prices would be inimical to
classwide starvation. Nevetheless,
those rugged individualists, the
farmers, would not find the re
placement of wheat altogether
beneficial. They would doubtless
become, quite quietly, afflicted in
dividuals, instead of, quite noisily,
a downtrodden class, for such has
been the habit of the agricultur
alist for centuries past, but they
would still constitute quite a prob
lem for the well-being of the
country. It would probably be
necessary finally to turn their
farms into landscaped gardens at
government expense, so that their
decadence might at least enact it
self against a background of gen
tility.
Of course, all this speculation
might be perfectly useless pessi
mism, for the artificial photosyn
â€¢thetic process might be more ex
pensive than the natural. In that
case, there would be no visible eco
nomic results of the development
of artificial photosynthesis, until
war, or some other isolating agen
cy, foi'ced the burden of economic
self-sufficiency on an unprepared
country. Then, by turning their
fields into factories, and praying
for the absence of cloudy weather,
they might be able to hold out for
months after they would otherwise
have succumbed, finally greeting
their nemesis in the form of pel
lagra, and other deficiency diseas
es, instead of total depletion. Be
fore this occurred, of course, the
great increase in the possibilities
of high explosive synthesis would
have made heights of destruction
possible which even today, when
destruction is a popular fine art,

cannot be attained.
Of course, the development of
artificial photosynthesis is not bad.
Nothing that science ever finds out
can be either good or bad. The
best it can be is true or false. For
this reason, science is frequently
blamed for situations which are
entirely beyond its control.
What then is the answer? Should
the research be abandoned? The
answer is, of course, no. Even if
world-wide abandonment could be
attained, thus aveiiing the dan
gers from every quarter, the an
swer would still be no. Not since
the time of Macbeth has any nation,
or group profited by letting I dare
not wait upon I would, like the cat
i' the adage.
This may sound impossible; but

it is actually only sensible. No
body expects automobiles to be
held to the 1915 level, in order to
prevent speeding. That is the work
of government, namely, the police.
Likewise, when the Stanford sci
entists reach the end of their inves
tigations, they should not be
saddled with the responsibility of
seeing that it is correctly used.
That would be not only unfair, but
impossible.
But if we carefully consider be
forehand all the possible results,
then, when the conclusions may be
revealed in the full glory of great
scientific progress, an interested
government may step in and pro
tect its people, and all others, from
any harmful repercussions. And in
this way, by supplementing sci
ence, but not restraining it, both
government and economics may
reach their most profound tri
umphs.
Science, like any other industry
governed by a stable group of cir
cumstances, has both stock and
transient problems. The deep, and
sometimes faintly ridiculous stud

empire-shaking matters as the cor

erybody agrees collaborates with
love in making the world go
round.
We noted above that the conse
quent cheapening of food in per
calorie prices would be inimical to
classwide starvation. Nevetheless,
those rugged individualists, the
farmers, would not find the re
placement of wheat altogether
beneficial. They would doubtless
become, quite quietly, afflicted in
dividuals, instead of, quite noisily,
a downtrodden class, for such has
been the habit of the agricultur
alist for centuries past, but they
would still constitute quite a prob
lem for the well-being of the
country. It would probably be
necessary finally to turn their
farms into landscaped gardens at
government expense, so that their
decadence might at least enact it
self against a background of gen
tility.
Of course, all this speculation
might be perfectly useless pessi
mism, for the artificial photosyn
â€¢thetic process might be more ex
pensive than the natural. In that
case, there would be no visible eco
nomic results of the development
of artificial photosynthesis, until
war, or some other isolating agen
cy, foi'ced the burden of economic
self-sufficiency on an unprepared
country. Then, by turning their
fields into factories, and praying
for the absence of cloudy weather,
they might be able to hold out for
months after they would otherwise
have succumbed, finally greeting
their nemesis in the form of pel
lagra, and other deficiency diseas
es, instead of total depletion. Be
fore this occurred, of course, the
great increase in the possibilities
of high explosive synthesis would
have made heights of destruction
possible which even today, when
destruction is a popular fine art,

cannot be attained.
Of course, the development of
artificial photosynthesis is not bad.
Nothing that science ever finds out
can be either good or bad. The
best it can be is true or false. For
this reason, science is frequently
blamed for situations which are
entirely beyond its control.
What then is the answer? Should
the research be abandoned? The
answer is, of course, no. Even if
world-wide abandonment could be
attained, thus aveiiing the dan
gers from every quarter, the an
swer would still be no. Not since
the time of Macbeth has any nation,
or group profited by letting I dare
not wait upon I would, like the cat
i' the adage.
This may sound impossible; but

it is actually only sensible. No
body expects automobiles to be
held to the 1915 level, in order to
prevent speeding. That is the work
of government, namely, the police.
Likewise, when the Stanford sci
entists reach the end of their inves
tigations, they should not be
saddled with the responsibility of
seeing that it is correctly used.
That would be not only unfair, but
impossible.
But if we carefully consider be
forehand all the possible results,
then, when the conclusions may be
revealed in the full glory of great
scientific progress, an interested
government may step in and pro
tect its people, and all others, from
any harmful repercussions. And in
this way, by supplementing sci
ence, but not restraining it, both
government and economics may
reach their most profound tri
umphs.
Science, like any other industry
governed by a stable group of cir
cumstances, has both stock and
transient problems. The deep, and
sometimes faintly ridiculous stud
ies concerning such weighty and
empire-shaking matters as the cor
relations between head size and
sex difference in the chameleon, or
the rate of heart beat in the blue
crab, Callinectes Sapidus, arise,
and are concluded, bringing inti
mations of immortality to the re
search workers who were haunted
by them, but seldom anything more
concrete. Opposed to these prob
lems are found such eternal
sources of conjecture as the origin
of life, the effect of cosmic rays on
life if any, the release of the vast
but unusable energy locked up
within the atomic structure, and fi
nally, the synthesis of chlorophyll,
and its use in the artificial prepa
ration of carbohydrates, suitable
for all the uses to which natural
ones may be put.
The final solution of any one of
these problems is capable of pro
ducing such changes in the fabric
of certain aspects of human civi
lization as to make that aspect al
most totally unrecognizable to any
person who knew it before the
change occurred. Such a denoue
ment is therefore an event to be
anticipated with the keenest in
terest, and apprehension. Research
es along the various lines men
tioned are in widely varying de
grees of completion, and it is prob
able that none of them are far
enough advanced to have serious
public implications as yet. The
last of these mighty queries, how
ever, is of particular interest to
citizens of Stanford Univei'sity,
and the Peninsula as a whole,
since it is slowly being unraveled
by the Carnegie Institute here on
the campus.
Speculation is usually a waste of

time, and is not regarded with fa
vor by those few unfortunates who
regard this as of itself sinful. Men
tal speculation, as distinguished
from economic speculation, how
ever, is usually pretty cheap en
tertainment, and has been known
to lead to any number of things.
We might, therefore, consider what
the most probable result will be,
when this matter of artificial pho
tosynthesis is brought under lab
oratory control, and put at the
mercy of all scientists, capable and
foolish, communist and fascist. If
we do have an idea of what may
be brought about, perhaps we can
be saved a number of rather un
fortunate surprises.
In the first place, it would seem
that, if we can put the poor, un
organized plant bodily out of the
economic picture, untold blessing
would result. When starch could
be made in the laboratory more
cheaply than in the field, the
chances of class-wide starvation
would be much reduced. Every
body, from Marie Antoinette to the
Wonder Baker, would be better off,
if flour were a product of waste
factory gasses and electric light.
The have-not nations would have
just as much pastry as the have
nations, even if the have nations
did call theirs Crepes Suzettes,
while the have-not nations were
content with Pfannkuchen. True,
the center of flour production
would change from Kansas to Jer
sey City, and the Kansans would
be reduced to living on the scant
revenues affoi'ded by passing tour
ists, but this would certainly make
them more hospitable. Likewise,
the tree would soon become a
relic, like the horse and buggy, or
Landon, but this could not pos
sibly bother anyone except Joyce
Kilmer and the CCC, and the
CCC could as readily chop
trees down as plant them, and
with even less training. Our cel
lulose supply would depend no
longer on the erratic fortunes of

nature, but would be constant, if
not inexhaustible. It would there
fore afford a much safer field for
economic manipulation, which ev
erybody agrees collaborates with
love in making the world go
round.
