With Pat Frayne of the Call-
Bulletin saying that Stanford will
be the surprise football team of
the season it is well to take a little
time out from reporting Wheel-
Chair baseball and imagine again
the thrill that comes at the first
kick-off of a new season.
Stanford will have a first class
team. Notwithstanding Brick Mul
ler of the Chronicle, who, as usual,
claims California has the greatest
set of backs in the country, Stan
ford has the smoothest backfield
since the days of Grayson, Hamil
ton, and company, and this year's
crop is versatile.
Pete Fay should have a banner
year, and undoubtedly the prayers
of all backfield men on the coast
will begin with "Don't let Fay get
beyond the scrimmage." Paulman
will be in good health again and
Gene Coldiron, one of the most
bruising blockers on the coast,

learned a lot about pass defense in
his last season of play.
Jim Groves worked out at left
half during spring practice. Groves
seemed to find himself at that po
sition. He really looked good.
Bill Kirsch, whom Bill Henry of
the Los Angeles Times called "the
most killing tackier," will be an
other senior who is sure to see lots
of action. A1 Alustiza and Thor
Peterson are two other boys who
could make any team on the coast.
Coach Tiny Thornhill has every
right in the world to speak with a
big smile on his face about his
backfield material. And you can
add a little salt to the stew when
Muller says that Vic Bottari and
the rest of the California backfield
will stand out on the coast.
