"By Jove, I never realized that
I had such an English accent," said
Professor T. A. Richards, Cam
bridge University authority on
basic English, when he recently
heard a recording made of his voice
as a part of the work of the Stan
ford Language Arts Investigation.
Several such recordings of the
voices of those members of the in
vestigation especially interested in
speech development have been
made, during the past five weeks,
in a sound-proof studio at Menlo
Junior College.
A talk by Dr. William H. Kil-

Patrick, acting professor of educa
tion at Stanford and prominent
speaker at the recent educational
conference, has been similarly re
corded. The records are to bg
used in presenting the words of
Dr. Kilpatrick before a meeting of
the Southern California English
Association, which is soon to be
held in Los Angeles.
The recordings have been made

under the direction of Harlen M.
Adams, instructor at Stanford and
at Menlo Junior College, and all of
the work has been done in a minia
ture broadcasting studio located at
the junior college.
This recording-broadcasting stu
dio is the only one of its type own
ed by a Northern California school
and is regularly used for student
broadcasting and for studying
student speech problems.
