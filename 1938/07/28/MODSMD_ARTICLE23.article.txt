### LYNNE ASHTON 
Stanford dramatist's portrayal of
"The American Scene" as thus far
seen and planned for the future
leads us to enquire "What Amer
ican scene?" In the case of "Ca
mille of Roaring Camp" neither
"Camille" nor "Roaring Camp"
gives a true picture of it.
Setting aside the question of the
handling of the situation in the
play, we must face the problem,
"Was frontier life ever as Bret
Harte has shown it?" Our answer
must surely be "No." Patently a
comparison can be drawn between
dramatic versions of frontier life
and similar commentaries upon the
contemporary scene. "Main
Street," "Street Scene," and others
show slices—either larger or more
confined—of a total picture, but in
the case of the latter, the empha
sis was placed upon practical real
ism, which must not be confused
with the gutter-grubbing variety.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" admittedly
had a tremendous effect upon those
who read its message, but like
wise it must be admitted that such
a picture is one which was touched
with sweetness and light on one
hand and incredible heartlessness
and villainy on the other. Contrast
is fine, but in attaining that qual
ity, romanticism prevails unin
vited — and thus the American
scene is distorted.
Generalizations drawn, either
argumentatively or dramatically,
from selected and pointed single
instances are fatal to reality. Mint
juleps, faithful white-haired re
tainers and graceful Georgian col
umns facing on green lawns all en
ter our "attitude-idea" about the
old South. We in turn become
gauche "damyankees."
So what? Well, principally that is
what Little Popoff calls "Pueblo
Much High Learning," and if Little
Popoff means what he says, then
surely we may expect the drama to
trace out in its own way the gen
eral pattern of education—that of
attempting an accurate portrayal of
"the world as she is lived."
Yahbut—says another Minority,
"Blue Jeans" suffered from another
disease. The actors didn't know a
real life situation well enough to
make it truly convincing, although
the play presents dialogue enough
for it.
Right you are, Watson, you cer
tainly have your point, but you
merely confirm my argument —
that the purpose of the plays the
dramatists turn out is to get for
themselves and to convey to the
audience a fundamental under
standing of the persons, scenes, and
period they are portraying.
That is not to say that there

should be an immediate rush for
the library copies of "The Weav
ers," so that the cast may harry
the next Memorial Hall audience
with five acts of weaving, starving,
and dying.
Somewhere in the middle of the
road there is a fine line between
Little Eva crossing the ice, pursued
by dachshunds on stilts and, say,
"Waiting for Lefty."
"Night Must Fall," although
slightly off-side for the present
discussion, nevertheless fills the
bill for the next point. There are
plays which do not "sing a song of
social significance" (and if you like
them that way, "Pins and Needles"
moves to S.F. soon) and do not at
the same time present to a 1938
audience the raucous lung-tearing
of a perishing Camille.
We of the Minority register a
complaint: If we are to see the
American scene, let us not view it
through a rose-tinted telescope,
but more personally, in full-face,
plays which show us the past as it
really was, not as its romantics
chose to depict it.
