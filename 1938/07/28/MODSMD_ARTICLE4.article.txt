The Editor, Sir:
It has been brought to my at
tention that the "Campus Ghost
writer" wrote a letter to you in the
last issue of the Daily objecting
to the business staff publishing an
advertisement for a commercial
Ghost-Writer. Besides cutting
into his own business, the ghost
writer complained that the adver
tisement undermined the Stanford
Honor Code.
Personally, I worship the Stan
ford Honor Code as much as any
loyal Stanford man does, and the
rest of the business staff holds
similar reverence for it. This is
evidenced by the fact that we of
the business staff did not under
stand the meaning of the term
"Ghost-Writers" when we signed
the contract to run advertising for
the firm in question. Had we been
as familiar with the type of busi
ness as the local ghost-writer
seems to be, we certainly would
have torn up the contract bit by
bit.
In order to prove to you that I
mean what I have been saying, I
will quote to you from a recent
letter which I wrote to the presi

dent of National Advertising Serv
ice, Inc., the firm which solicits
national advertising for the Daily:
"Although we did publish the
two insertions of the advertise
ment for "Ghost-Writers," in the
future we will not be able to ac
cept orders from that firm, for at
Stanford we are very proud of
the successful operation of our
Honor Code, which places each
student upon his honor not to
receive unpermitted aid in do
ing his school work. The service
offered by "Ghost-Writers" in
their advertisement is in direct
violation of the spirit of the
Stanford Honor Code."
Thank you, local ghost-writer,
for writing your letter. The next
time a prospective local advertiser
tells me that the students do not
read the advertisements in the
Daily I will show him your letter
to prove that they do. If you are
considering running any advertise
ments in the Daily to increase the
volume of your ghost-writing busi
ness, please don't be surprised.
