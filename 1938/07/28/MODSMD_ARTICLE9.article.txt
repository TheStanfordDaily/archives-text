# DRAMA
## Uncle Tom's Cabin 
### 
With "Uncle Tom's Cabin"
scheduled for a three-night show
ing in the Memorial Theater Au
gust 4 to 6, H. Miles Heberer, who
is directing the show, has started
a series of intensive rehearsals for
this week and next.
Because this immortal play of
Harriet Beecher Stowe's epitomizes
one of the most important periods
in American history, the Speech
and Drama Department chose it to
carry out their program of early

American drama. "Camille in
Roaring Camp," presented last
week-end, showed both the East
and the West of the mid-nine
teenth century; "Uncle Tom's Cab
in" pictures the South and the
slavery issue; while "Gringo's
Gamble," which will play late in<
August, portrays the Spanish in
the Southwest to round out the
summer season.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" will star
some of Stanford's best actors and
actresses. J. P. Cahn plays Uncle
Tom, Shirley Jones, Topsy, and
Bud Cady, the Deacon Perry and
Phineas. Simon Legree will be
portrayed by Virgil Bergman, and
Eliza by Harriet Touton. All of
these had prominent parts in "Ca
mille in Roaring Camp."
Other members of the cast for
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" include Anita
Uhl, Catherine Forbes, George
Taylor, Carl Diesenroth, Charles
Hildebrandt, Edwin Arnold, Wal
ter Brash, Robert Ross, George
Campbell, Ted Curtis, Powers Cam
