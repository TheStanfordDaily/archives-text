Former Students Lost

The fate of two former Stanford
men who were among the 15 per
sons aboard the Hawaii Clipper,
unreported since last Thursday
evening, remains unrevealed in
the search for the 26-ton flying
boat still going on by sea and air
under army and navy direction.
Mark A. Walker, first officer of
the Pan-American sky-ship, was
graduated in economics from Stan
ford in 1931. Flight Steward Ivan
Parker, who had aspired to an
aviation career long before ob
taining his position on the clipper,
attended the university in 1917 and
1918.
Captain Leo Terletzky, in com
mand of the clipper, has resided in
Palo Alto for the past two years.
He began his aviation activities in
1919 and has been with Pan-Amer
ican for 11 years. The 43-year-old
Russian has been considered one
of the company's finest pilots. Last
winter Terletzsky spoke to the
members of the Stanford Flying
Club.
Only clew to the clipper's dis
appearance was a huge "oil slick"
on the ocean surface 50 miles be
yond the plane's last reported po
sition and on its course. Hope is
still held that the flying boat may
have landed successfully some
where outside the zone of search
and that its radio had failed.
