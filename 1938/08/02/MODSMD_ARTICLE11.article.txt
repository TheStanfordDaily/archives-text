Felton Elkins, author of Grin
go's Gamble, isn't superstitious, but
—he made a bee-line for the phone
to inform Director Gordon Lange
that the cast numbered 13. Not
only that, but there were 13 scenes
in the original script. Since the
title of the play suggests risk, Mr.
Elkins feels inclined to set super
stition aside and let the cast ride
as is.

One of the most brilliant skits in
the Labor Stage's production of
"Pins and Needles," opening at the
Geary Theater Monday, Aug. 8, is
the "Four Little Angels of Peace,"
satire on Hitler, Mussolini, An
thony Eden, and the Japanese mili
tary command. The following is
an amusing chorus of the song
sung by the "Four Little Angels"
just before murdering each other:
"Four little angels of peace are we,
Reeking with odor of Sanctity;
Though we slaughter the meek
We confer every week..
And we talk it over peacefully!
Four little angels of peace are we,
There is one thing on which we
agree;
With shot and with shell
We give each other Hell
Just for peace, peace, peace!"

One of the most brilliant skits in
the Labor Stage's production of
"Pins and Needles," opening at the
Geary Theater Monday, Aug. 8, is
the "Four Little Angels of Peace,"
satire on Hitler, Mussolini, An
thony Eden, and the Japanese mili
tary command. The following is
an amusing chorus of the song
sung by the "Four Little Angels"
just before murdering each other:
"Four little angels of peace are we,
Reeking with odor of Sanctity;
Though we slaughter the meek
We confer every week..
And we talk it over peacefully!
Four little angels of peace are we,
There is one thing on which we
agree;
With shot and with shell
We give each other Hell
Just for peace, peace, peace!"
