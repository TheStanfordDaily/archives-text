chemists.
Speakers will include James
Franck, Nobel Prize physicist of
Johns Hopkins, who is at Stanford
this summer as acting professor of
chemistry; G. K. Rollefson, Univer
sity of California; Edward Teller,
George Washington University;
W. A. Noyes, Jr., Brown Univer

"We do things because we want
things," asserted Dr. Florence L.
Goodenough, acting professor of
psychology at Stanford, in a radio
address last evening pointing out
the various desires that are the

causes of human action.
Dr. Goodenough further warned
against too great a projection of
personal wants in the relationship
between parent and child. She
pointed out that the normal devel
opment of the child is retarded by
too stringent control of his actions.
As proof of her conclusions, Dr.
Goodenough cited a research being
conducted in a Minnesota high
school which has traced non-social
characteristics in children directly
to desires for non-sociablity shown
by their parents.

Hospital Insurance

The Palo Alto Medical Society
announced yesterday that they
have formulated a plan of hospi
talization insurance which will
begin with a campaign to enroll
residents of the vicinity at a rate
of 85 cents per month.
The Pacific Employers Insurance
Company has drafted a special
plan by which the program will be
open to all residents of Palo Alto
and the surrounding communities
including those on the Stanford
campus where a group plan for
persons connected with the uni
versity will be worked out.
According to Dr. R. V. A. Lee

the success of the program will
assure adequate occupancy of the
new wing of the Palo Alto Hospi
tal and will reduce the number of
indigents on the county hospital
roll.

Radio Hour

"We do things because we want
things," asserted Dr. Florence L.
Goodenough, acting professor of
psychology at Stanford, in a radio
address last evening pointing out
the various desires that are the

causes of human action.
Dr. Goodenough further warned
against too great a projection of
personal wants in the relationship
between parent and child. She
pointed out that the normal devel
opment of the child is retarded by
too stringent control of his actions.
As proof of her conclusions, Dr.
Goodenough cited a research being
conducted in a Minnesota high
school which has traced non-social
characteristics in children directly
to desires for non-sociablity shown
by their parents.

Hospital Insurance

The Palo Alto Medical Society
announced yesterday that they
have formulated a plan of hospi
talization insurance which will
begin with a campaign to enroll
residents of the vicinity at a rate
of 85 cents per month.
The Pacific Employers Insurance
Company has drafted a special
plan by which the program will be
open to all residents of Palo Alto
and the surrounding communities
including those on the Stanford
campus where a group plan for
persons connected with the uni
versity will be worked out.
According to Dr. R. V. A. Lee

the success of the program will
assure adequate occupancy of the
new wing of the Palo Alto Hospi
tal and will reduce the number of
indigents on the county hospital
roll.
