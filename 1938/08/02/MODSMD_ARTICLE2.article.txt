Quartet on Air

Following its policy of giving the
public the best in musical enter
tainment, the National Broadcast
ing Company last night presented
the Roth Quartet in a half-hour
program over its Pacific Coast
network.
The quartet, accompanied by
Ernst Toch, Viennese composer
pianist, played for the first time a
"Piano Quintet," Opus 64, com
posed by Toch. The "Quintet" re
cently was composed by Toch at
the request of Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge, to whom it is
dedicated.
The Roth Quartet has concluded
its concert series and makes it
final appearance as guests of the
Tuesday evening series tonight
in the Memorial Church with a
Mozart concert under the aus
pices of Dr. John A. Sellards, di
rector of the Summer Quarter.
The Quartet will be assisted by
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist.
The program will be: Quartet in
E flat major (K. 428), Allegro ma
non troppo, Andante con moto,
Menuetto (Allegretto), Allegro
vivace; Fantasia in F for organ,
Adagio, Allegro, Adagio; Quartet
in A major (K. 464), Allegro, An
dante, Menuetto, Allegro non
troppo.
The quartets are from the fa
mous six dedicated to Joseph
Haydn. The organ fantasia was
written for a mechanical organ at
Vienna exhibition.
The public is invited to attend,
no tickets being necessary, it was
announced today. This program
finishes a group of concerts given
during the summer quarter which
were sponsored by Mrs. Coolidge.
It will begin at 8 o'clock.

"The progress of the local com
munity must come from the ini
tiative and enterprise of the busi
ness men of the community,"
John W. O'Leary, chairman of the
executive committee of the United
States Chamber of Commerce,
said last night at a banquet held at
the Stanford Union.
The banquet was held as a part
of the program of the Western
Conference for Commercial and
Trade Executives. The conference
was opened yesterday morning at
Lagunita Court in a general ses
sion at which C. E. Amey, Jr.,
commentator of Totem Broadcast
ers of Seattle, spoke on the sub
ject "Politics and Organized Busi
ness." Immediately following, Dr.
V. Orval Watts, professor of eco
nomics at Carleton College in
Minnesota, discussed "True Liber
alism for Labor."
Asserting that labor's position
has 'become increasingly worse
since 1929, Dr. Watts attacked the
actions of labor bosses and em
phasized the need for conscientious
labor leaders.
"The danger to labor at the
present time is that by organizing
for a monopoly on its side, it has
forced a similar monopoly among
employers, and this may eventually
lead to a loss by labor," Dr. Watts
said.
The opening addresses were fol
lowed by two simultaneous ses
sions. One dealt with problems of
chambers of commerce, and the
other was confined to a discussion
of trade association difficulties.
R. C. Edlund, manager of the As
sociation of American Soap and
Glycerine Producers of New York
City, led one group in discussing
"The Trade Association and Busi
ness Planning." The chamber ses
sion was conducted by Ralph Brad
ford, of the United States Chamber
of Commerce, and dealt with
finance.
Lane D. Webber, tax counsel for
the Southern California Edison
Company, spoke on the western
taxation program at a luncheon
session.
"The Obstacles to Economic Lib
eralism" will be the subject to be
discussed by Dr. Watts this morn
ing. "Answers Liberals Must
Know" and "Oh My Countrymen,
Dare To Be Great" will be the
topics of his addresses on Wednes
day and Thursday mornings.
Chamber sessions and trade ses
sions will be conducted each morn
ing of the remaining four days of
the conference.
Lagunita Court, headquarters
for the conference, reported a
registration of more than 185 at 1
o'clock today. The Menlo Country
Club will play host to all of the
members at a buffet supper to be
held this evening.

Play Impressionistic

Although the forthcoming pro
duction of "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
which will run for three nights be
ginning Thursday, is to be done
in the good old-fashioned way,
modern techniques of stagecraft
are being used throughout.
''Still movies" will be projected
on the cyclorama to show sky,
sunset, and iceflow. Eliza will ap
pear, however, not on projected
scenery but on a sled in front of
the iceflow shown by the crossing
of plain and pebble glass from op
posite directions through the pro
jectors.
The projectors magnify the
original slides 9210 times, accord
ing to the calculations of Bill Bas
set, who has been working with
Waldemar Johansen on the scen
ery for the play
H. Miles Heberer, director, de
scribes the production as impres
sionistic rather than realistic and
this theme is further carried out
by so-called space-void lighting.
This consists in partial lighting of
the stage so that the actual seen-'
ery used in the foreground need
not be moved at any time during
the play.
Tickets may be purchased in
Room 202, Memorial Hall, and at
the box before each performance
for 50 cents, 75 cents, and $1.


SHIRLEY JONES will play the
part of Topsy in "Uncle Tom's
Cabin," which opens Thursday
night in the Memorial Theater for
a three-day run. Shirley, now an
education graduate, is well known
to Stanford students for her act
ing and singing in four years of
campus productions.

Play Impressionistic

Although the forthcoming pro
duction of "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
which will run for three nights be
ginning Thursday, is to be done
in the good old-fashioned way,
modern techniques of stagecraft
are being used throughout.
''Still movies" will be projected
on the cyclorama to show sky,
sunset, and iceflow. Eliza will ap
pear, however, not on projected
scenery but on a sled in front of
the iceflow shown by the crossing
of plain and pebble glass from op
posite directions through the pro
jectors.
The projectors magnify the
original slides 9210 times, accord
ing to the calculations of Bill Bas
set, who has been working with
Waldemar Johansen on the scen
ery for the play
H. Miles Heberer, director, de
scribes the production as impres
sionistic rather than realistic and
this theme is further carried out
by so-called space-void lighting.
This consists in partial lighting of
the stage so that the actual seen-'
ery used in the foreground need
not be moved at any time during
the play.
Tickets may be purchased in
Room 202, Memorial Hall, and at
the box before each performance
for 50 cents, 75 cents, and $1.

Following its policy of giving the
public the best in musical enter
tainment, the National Broadcast
ing Company last night presented
the Roth Quartet in a half-hour
program over its Pacific Coast
network.
The quartet, accompanied by
Ernst Toch, Viennese composer
pianist, played for the first time a
"Piano Quintet," Opus 64, com
posed by Toch. The "Quintet" re
cently was composed by Toch at
the request of Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge, to whom it is
dedicated.
The Roth Quartet has concluded
its concert series and makes it
final appearance as guests of the
Tuesday evening series tonight
in the Memorial Church with a

The Quartet will be assisted by
Warren D. Allen, University or

The program will be: Quartet in
E flat major (K. 428), Allegro ma
non troppo, Andante con moto,
Menuetto (Allegretto), Allegro
vivace; Fantasia in F for organ,
Adagio, Allegro, Adagio; Quartet
in A major (K. 464), Allegro, An

Vienna exhibition.
The public is invited to attend,
no tickets being necessary, it was
announced today. This program
finishes a group of concerts given
during the summer quarter which
were sponsored by Mrs. Coolidge.
It will begin at 8 o'clock.

"The progress of the local com
munity must come from the ini
tiative and enterprise of the busi
ness men of the community,"
John W. O'Leary, chairman of the
executive committee of the United
States Chamber of Commerce,
said last night at a banquet held at
the Stanford Union.
The banquet was held as a part
of the program of the Western
Conference for Commercial and
Trade Executives. The conference
was opened yesterday morning at
Lagunita Court in a general ses
sion at which C. E. Amey, Jr.,
commentator of Totem Broadcast
ers of Seattle, spoke on the sub
ject "Politics and Organized Busi
ness." Immediately following, Dr.
V. Orval Watts, professor of eco
nomics at Carleton College in
Minnesota, discussed "True Liber
alism for Labor."
Asserting that labor's position
has 'become increasingly worse
since 1929, Dr. Watts attacked the
actions of labor bosses and em
phasized the need for conscientious
labor leaders.
"The danger to labor at the
present time is that by organizing
for a monopoly on its side, it has
forced a similar monopoly among
employers, and this may eventually
lead to a loss by labor," Dr. Watts
said.
The opening addresses were fol
lowed by two simultaneous ses
sions. One dealt with problems of
chambers of commerce, and the
other was confined to a discussion
of trade association difficulties.
R. C. Edlund, manager of the As
sociation of American Soap and
Glycerine Producers of New York
City, led one group in discussing
"The Trade Association and Busi

"The progress of the local com
munity must come from the ini
tiative and enterprise of the busi
ness men of the community,"
John W. O'Leary, chairman of the
executive committee of the United
States Chamber of Commerce,
said last night at a banquet held at
the Stanford Union.
The banquet was held as a part
of the program of the Western
Conference for Commercial and
Trade Executives. The conference
was opened yesterday morning at
Lagunita Court in a general ses
sion at which C. E. Amey, Jr.,
commentator of Totem Broadcast
ers of Seattle, spoke on the sub
ject "Politics and Organized Busi
ness." Immediately following, Dr.
V. Orval Watts, professor of eco
nomics at Carleton College in
Minnesota, discussed "True Liber
alism for Labor."
Asserting that labor's position
has 'become increasingly worse
since 1929, Dr. Watts attacked the
actions of labor bosses and em
phasized the need for conscientious
labor leaders.
"The danger to labor at the
present time is that by organizing
for a monopoly on its side, it has
forced a similar monopoly among
employers, and this may eventually
lead to a loss by labor," Dr. Watts
said.
The opening addresses were fol
lowed by two simultaneous ses
sions. One dealt with problems of
chambers of commerce, and the
other was confined to a discussion
of trade association difficulties.
R. C. Edlund, manager of the As
sociation of American Soap and
Glycerine Producers of New York
City, led one group in discussing
"The Trade Association and Busi
ness Planning." The chamber ses
sion was conducted by Ralph Brad
ford, of the United States Chamber
of Commerce, and dealt with
finance.
Lane D. Webber, tax counsel for
the Southern California Edison
Company, spoke on the western
taxation program at a luncheon
session.
"The Obstacles to Economic Lib
eralism" will be the subject to be
discussed by Dr. Watts this morn
ing. "Answers Liberals Must
Know" and "Oh My Countrymen,
Dare To Be Great" will be the
topics of his addresses on Wednes
day and Thursday mornings.
Chamber sessions and trade ses
sions will be conducted each morn
ing of the remaining four days of
the conference.
Lagunita Court, headquarters
for the conference, reported a
registration of more than 185 at 1
o'clock today. The Menlo Country
Club will play host to all of the
members at a buffet supper to be
held this evening.

Play Impressionistic

Although the forthcoming pro
duction of "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
which will run for three nights be
ginning Thursday, is to be done
in the good old-fashioned way,
modern techniques of stagecraft
are being used throughout.
''Still movies" will be projected
on the cyclorama to show sky,
sunset, and iceflow. Eliza will ap
pear, however, not on projected
scenery but on a sled in front of
the iceflow shown by the crossing
of plain and pebble glass from op
posite directions through the pro
jectors.
The projectors magnify the
original slides 9210 times, accord
ing to the calculations of Bill Bas
set, who has been working with
Waldemar Johansen on the scen
ery for the play
H. Miles Heberer, director, de
scribes the production as impres
sionistic rather than realistic and
this theme is further carried out
by so-called space-void lighting.
This consists in partial lighting of
the stage so that the actual seen-'
ery used in the foreground need
not be moved at any time during
the play.
Tickets may be purchased in
Room 202, Memorial Hall, and at
the box before each performance
for 50 cents, 75 cents, and $1.


SHIRLEY JONES will play the
part of Topsy in "Uncle Tom's
Cabin," which opens Thursday
night in the Memorial Theater for
a three-day run. Shirley, now an
education graduate, is well known
to Stanford students for her act
ing and singing in four years of
campus productions.
Quartet on Air

Following its policy of giving the
public the best in musical enter
tainment, the National Broadcast
ing Company last night presented
the Roth Quartet in a half-hour
program over its Pacific Coast
network.
The quartet, accompanied by
Ernst Toch, Viennese composer
pianist, played for the first time a
"Piano Quintet," Opus 64, com
posed by Toch. The "Quintet" re
cently was composed by Toch at
the request of Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge, to whom it is
dedicated.
The Roth Quartet has concluded

final appearance as guests of the
Tuesday evening series tonight
