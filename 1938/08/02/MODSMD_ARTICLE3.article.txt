### HARVEY YORKE 
Last year Lee Yancey, chief
accountant of Stanford University,
spent his month's vacation at his
cabin in Trail, Ore., but he had
an experience he will never for
get. Hunting late one afternoon,
he chased a mountain lion up a
tree, but couldn't shoot him be
cause it was too dark.
Rather than let the cougar get
away, Yancey decided to camp un
der the tree all night and when
morning came to shoot him. But
the lion had other plans. Waiting
until the chief accountant was

asleep at the root of the tree, he
crept down, stole Mr. Yancey's
lunch, and left.
To avoid a recurrence of the ex
perience, Dean Culver and some of
Mr. Yancey's other friends got to
gether and bought equipment.
Dean Culver provided plans for
putting a fence around the tree so
that the cougar couldn't escape. At
the mouth of the corral, Yancey
has been instructed to place the
rat-trap provided for the purpose.
Then in order to kill the lion he
has a miniature shotgun which

shoots rubber bullets and a rub
ber bowie knife 8 inches long. He
has also been provided with a
flashlight "for close-up work."
In case Mr. Yancey decides to
camp under the tree again, he has
an assortment of candy bars which
his friends told him to hide at va
rious points about the tree so the
lion, if he must steal, will take
only some of the supplies.
When he returns in September,
Mr. Yancey expects to deliver a
series of lectures entitled, "How to
bag cougars" (if he returns).
