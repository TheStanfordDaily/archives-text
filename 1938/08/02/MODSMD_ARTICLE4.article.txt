Appropriately selected for read
ing was Phillip Barry's "The Ani
mal Kingdom," presented by the
Stagers in the Little Theater last
Friday night. Concerned with the
old triangle of husband-mistress
wife, the play is exemplary of
drama which is outstanding for
the cleverness of its lines alone.
A young publisher deserts his
artist-mistress for a falsely saccha
rine, money-seeking wife, who
comes near to ruining her husband
and his career. Her part was skill
fully toned down, and Dorothy
Tully in the role successfully in
terpreted her character, making
herself hateful without overdoing
the lines. Jack Gillis, always dra
matically dependable, read the
part of the infatuated husband,
arousing the necessary sympathy
and appeal despite his blindness to
his wife's unsubtle schemes. Cath
erine Elwood, as the understand
ing mistress to whom the husband
ultimately returns, was the only
member of the cast unsuitable for
her part. A lack of voice control
and technique no doubt contribut
ed to this shortcoming. Outstand
ing in the group was Dorothy Le-
Baker, who read the part of a so
cially - otherwise - empty-minded
young woman, and Paul Crary,
who did an amusing job with the
pugilist butler's role. Others in the
reading were Joseph Whitaker,
George Z. Wilson, Mackenzie Gor
don, and Mary Leles.
Stagers will present its last
reading of the Summer Quarter on
August 13. The selection to be
read will be announced later.
