# MINORITY RETORT
## 
### JACK GILLIS 
There is apparently some con
fusion, at least on the part of the
author of "Minority Report," ap
pearing in last Thursday's Daily,
as to the purpose of the selection
of plays by the Speech and Drama
department. There is a vast dif
ference between "The American
Scene" and "The American Dra
matic Scene"; if a true picture of
the former were to be painted,
then the "Dramatists" would be
spending the summer buried in
books of history.
They do not, however, desire to
become historians, nor would the
purpose of their art allow them to
do so. The intention, this summer,
is to give a survey, brief though it
may be, of American drama; and
how can mention be made of the
American theater without consid
ering "Uncle Tom's Cabin"?
The American Scene
Of course, there is a mixture of
'sweetness and light" and "heart
lessness and villainy" in "Uncle
Tom's Cabin": we would never
have heard of the play had it not
contained such a contrast. (Inci
dentally, is there not just such a
conict in the mentioned "Waiting
for Lefty"?) The American Scene
has always been distorted in its
dramatic photographs, more often
being over-exposed than under
exposed.
But here, perhaps, is the key to
Miss Ashton's opinion: "... the
purpose of the plays the dramatists
turn out is to get for themselves
and to convey to the audience a
fundamental understanding of the
persons, scenes, and periods they
are portraying."
Author's Purpose
If such were the purpose of
dramatic art, then this summer's
work might possibly be devoted to
a picturization of the American
Scene; certainly the Speech and
Drama department would have to
turn elsewhere than to all exist
ing dramatic literature in select
ing their plays—for try to find an
author who has followed such a
purpose while writing his plays!
There is much difference between
a mirror held to nature and nature
itself.
As for the freedom with which
Bret Harte treated his locale. It is
a period of the past, and we are
somewhat bound to take the word
of those who were actually on the
scene. That such a West as he
depicted ever existing is a subject
open for dispute; no doubt he, like
many another author, gathered to
gether the most picturesque char
acters of his observance for the
purpose of his narratives.
Bret Harte's Idea
But this is not intended to be a

defense of Bret Harte's authentic
ity or accuracy. The purpose of
"Camille in Roaring Camp" was
not to present a view of life in an
early mining camp, but rather of
life as depicted in the western au
thor's "Roaring Camp." And cer
tainly the bringing of Matilda Her
on's classic translation to the West
was an event in American dramatic
history.
We feel perfectly justified, then,
in our selection of plays for the
summer; whether or not they are
presented as well as they deserve
to be is our responsibility. But
certainly we do not desire to take
over the work of the history de
partment and present a series of
moderately accurate but exceed
ingly boring pageants exposing
"the world as she was lived in
America." The American The
ater is our interest.
By the way—"Little Eva cross
ing the ice"? Perhaps Miss Ash
ton needs to see "Uncle Tom's
Cabin"! Also, the English play,
"Night Must Fall," seems to lie a
bit outside the "American Scene."
