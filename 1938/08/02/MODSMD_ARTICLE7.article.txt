# GRAY LECTURE

Emphasizing the emotional ap
peal in romantic drama, Dr. Henry
David Gray, professor of dramatic
literature, appeared as lecturer on
the Dramatists program in the
Women's Clubhouse last Thursday
night.
Tracing the development of po
etic drama from the year Maxwell
Anderson was born, Dr. Gray dis
cussed Oscar Wilde, Boker, Bul
wer-Lytton, Stephen Phillips, and
John Drinkwater. Any of these
plays, he said, can be made absurd.
There may be something prepos
terous, mawkish, and exaggerated

about romantic drama, but the
emotional appeal cannot be over
looked. It is an escape literature
and consequently does not, nor has
to bear analysis, he explained.
Enthusiasm for poetic drama,
however, has been considerably on
the wane in this century, and it is
with its revival that Maxwell An
derson is occupied.
As a conclusion to the program,
Oscar Wilde's "Florentine Trag
edy" was read. George Z. Wilson
took the part of the prince-lover;
Myna Hughes, the merchant's wife;
and James Sandoe, a former Stan
ford star, the menacing husband.
The amusement aroused by the
slightly ironical treatment of the
lines indicates that, although the
nation is essentially romantic as
proved by our motion pictures, ro
mantic melodrama of the late Vic
torian period can no longer cause
a seriously emotional reaction.

Toch Interviewed

"I can't conceive of any country
where the future of music is any
brighter than it is right here in
America," asserted Mr. Ernst Toch,
eminent Viennese composer and
pianist, who appeai'ed here with
the Roth Quartet last night.
During his early youth, Mr. Toch
studied music and philosophy,
spending his spare time compos
ing. He was still in high school
when his first compositions for
string quartets were played by
such famous groups as those head
ed by Petri, Rose, and Go wand
thaus.
"I am a self-taught musician,"
said Mr. Toch, "that is to say, my
only teachers were Mozart and
Bach. I had no living teachers."
At the age of 20, Toch received
the Mozart Award, which is among
the outstanding international mu
sic scholarships. Shortly there
after he became "what I always
probably was â€” a composer," and
ceased his studies of medicine and
philosophy.
The expulsion from Germany of

all modern musicians, "all of whom
come under the heading of Jews
or Cultural Bolshevists," has led to
an influx of musical talent in
America, according to Toch. In
this country, individuality is en
couraged and allowed to grow,
whereas in other countries tradi
tion impedes young talent.
Fervent in his praise of the aid
given chamber music by its pa
troness, Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge, Mr. Toch expressed the
view that "soon the world will

realize what wonderful things Mrs.
Coolidge has done for music in this
country." It was she who com
missioned his "Quintet for strings
and piano, Opus 64, which was
played by Mr. Toch and the Roth
Quartet last evening.
Among his more recent works
are the Chamber Opera, "The
Princess and the Pea," from the
fairy tale by Hans Christian An
derson, and a cello concerto play
ed by Feuermann with Pierre
Monteux in Amsterdam.
