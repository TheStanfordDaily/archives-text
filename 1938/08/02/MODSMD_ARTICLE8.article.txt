27 to 12. That isn't a predic
tion of the margin of victory of
Stanford over Cal in the big game
next fall, but rather the gruesome
evidence that in the Wheel Chair
Baseball League the pitchers have
glass arms, their infields are tissue
paper strong, and the batters hit
like the DiMaggios.
The Slave Drivers in garnering
27 runs to the Bushmen's 12
showed that they are once mox-e
in the groove and should make Pa
Kennedy and his Accordians look
like a penny waiting for the
change in their game today.
In games this last week-end the
Cardinals, the once "terrible"
Cardinals, did away with the For
eign Legion, 13-8, while the slip
ping Accordians lost a tantalizer to
the Prune Pickers, 4-3.
With the addition of a couple of
Daily baseballers the Wildcats now
might be able to win a game.
Pitcher "Leering Louie" Means is
good as is Short-stop "Bobbin'
Bob" Neill, and between these two
the Wildcats should make a show
ing of note against the Foreign
Legion.

Tennis

With two quarter-finals yet to
be played the Stanford Summer
Session Tennis Tournament, un
der the direction of Coach Bugge,
moved into the semi-finals.
The quarter-final matches will
find "I'm-sure-to-win" Proctor
playing Rudolph Blum, while
Dave Strauss, of badminton fame,
will tangle with Downey.
Obert Tanner, who was in the
finals last year, advanced into the
semi-finals at the expense of John
Bunn, with a victory of 6-1, 6-2.
Dennis Gardiner, last summer's
winner, was the other player in
the semi-finals.
When asked what his chances
were for winning the tournament,
Ed Proctor said, "Chances! This
isn't a question of chance. I'm a
certainty!"

Track

Ray Malott, Stanford's great
track man, substantiated the pre
dictions of Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton when in a meet at Gothen
burg, Sweden, he broke the world's

record in the 500 meters. He was
timed in 1 minute IV2 seconds,
clipping a half second off Ben
Eastman's 1:02.0 set in 1934 at Oslo,
Norway.
Coach Templeton had formerly
said that Malott would undoubt
edly break a world's record some
time this summer.
Pete Zagar, Stanford's big foot
ball tackle and also a member of
the team that is touring Europe,
again ran into trouble with the
strong-armed Swedes when he
eked out a fourth place behind
Sorlie, who threw the discus 155
feet, 51/2 inches. Pete's best throw
was a little better than 151 feet,
which is far below his usual stand
ard of around 165 feet.

Golf

Rapidly becoming one of the
country's leading amateur golfers,
Art Doering, Stanford's best, again
finished well up among the pro
fessionals and carried amateur
honors in the $7500 St. Paul Open.
Starting off with a brilliant 69
in the first day's matches, Art
found himself in third position
ahead of such greats as Tommy
Armour, Walter Hagen, Lawson
Little, Gene Sarazen, and other
important golfing names.
In the second, Art kept up his
beautiful stroking and in a pour
ing rain came home with a 71 to
stay in third position. But a bad
early morning round on Sunday,
during which he carded a 76, fol
lowed by another 71 in the after
noon, gave Art a 287, still way
ahead of all other amateurs and
many well known professionals,

but nine strokes behind winner
Johnny Revolta and eight strokes
behind runner-up "Slammin' Sam"
Snead.
