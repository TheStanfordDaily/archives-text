# THE 						CAMPUS
## THIS WEEK 
### 
PHOTOCHEMISTRY,

an as-yet little known branch of
science, will be investigated here
next week during the Stanford
Summer Conference on Chemistry.
During a three-day session, be
ginning Monday, some of Ameri
ca's leading chemists will study
polyatomic molecules (molecules
having more than two atoms), the
behavior of molecules under ul
tra-violet ray exposure, and the
problem of photosynthesis in
plants.
James Franck, Nobel Prize phys
icist of Johns Hopkins, who is at
Stanford this summer as acting
professor of chemistry, will open
the conference Monday with a pa
per on the fluorescence of poly
atomic molecules.
Since the behavior of the larger
molecules present many unsolved
problems, the reports of Professor
Franck and others participating
will deal with "unfinished busi
ness"â€”work not yet completed,
theories advanced but not estab
lished.
Following the conference here,
the chemists will join in a pack
trip into the Sierra Nevada.

ROBLE CLUB MEMBERS AND
THEIR GUESTS WILL DANCE

NAT THOMAS AND HIS BAND
WILL FEATURE SWEET TUNES

for the Toyon summer dance on
Friday. August 12. This band has
been playing in the bay area for
quite some time and is known for
its good dance music.
"The dance, which will last from
9 to 11 o'clock, will have the theme
of 'Stanford,' and every possible
Stanford idea will be carried out,"
said Preston Hill, who is chairman
for the dance. Two hundred cou
ples will be the limit, so plenty of
dancing room is assured to all the
Toyon Club members and their
guests.

ROBLE'S SEMI-WEEKLY
JOLLY-UPS WILL CONTINUE

tonight with dancing in the Nit
ery from 7 to 8 o'clock.
Following its dance Friday
night the next event on the Roble
social program is a swim-tea
which will be held next Wednes
day at the pool in the Women's
Gym.

FIVE-WEEK FINALS
FINISHED THE BOYS

of the business school last week.
Yet gluttons for punishment, they
start anew on a second set of sum
mer courses this week.
The school offers four courses
two hours a day for the first five
weeks and gives three two-hour
courses for the remaining period,
thus dividing the teaching among
the professors. Each student takes
only two courses in each five-week
period and has finals in the courses
upon their completion.

ONCE A YEAR STANFORD
CLOSES ITS ROADS
TO THE PUBLIC.

This is done by the school authori
ties to maintain the legal status of
all the roads as private rights-of
way.
At all university-owned roads
entering or leaving the campus a
man is stationed with a rope that
is drawn across the street. All
traffic must come to a complete
halt before the watchman lowers
the rope and lets the vehicle pro
ceed.
This must be done in accordance
with a state law that says that con
trol must be exercised over pri
vately owned roads for an eight
hour day at least once a year to
maintain their private status. If
this is not done the university
roads would become public thor
oughfares and no longer under the
control of the university.
According to A. L. Trowbridge,
assistant comptroller, the roads will
probably be closed this year around
the end of August.

"SHOULD I MAKE A WILL?"

will be the subject of a talk to be
given during the Stanford Radio
Program over KGO next Monday
evening by Professor A. James
Casner, a member of the summer
faculty at the Stanford School of
Law.
Professor Casner, who is asso
ciated with the law school of the
University of Illinois, will speak
from 0:15 until 9:30 o'clock.
