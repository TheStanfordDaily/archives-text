The scene is a certain well
known stage. Bits of scenery are
scattered about; up left a couch
and a hard chair. Hundreds of
People off left and right. Ciga
ret butts strew the floor. The Di
rector is seated in the front row
of the auditorium. The Actor is
stretched out on the couch, while
the Actress is seated on the chair
beside him. The stage is very dim
but a sign is posted on a flat: "Re
hearsal 7:30 sharp. Be there!" It
is now 8 o'clock.
DIRECTOR: (Rising briskly) All
right, everybody!
(There is a general murmur.)
ACTOR: (Under his breath) !
ACTRESS: One shouldn't com

ACTOR: It is now 8 o'clock.
Thirty hours a week — eight

ACTRESS: (Sympathetically) A

DIRECTOR: (Puffing resentfully)
Thanks. (He lights another as
the Man goes out.)
(A Reviewer comes in. There is a
chorus of "Hello!" from Hun
dreds of People as he is recog

nose and smiles sweetly.)
REVIEWER: How is the show
coming?
ACTOR: I don't want you to quote
