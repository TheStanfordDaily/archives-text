(An Incident)
THE CAST
A Director
An Actor
An Actress
A Man
A Reviewer
Hundreds of People
Costume Mistress
The scene is a certain well
known stage. Bits of scenery are
scattered about; up left a couch
and a hard chair. Hundreds of
People off left and right. Ciga
ret butts strew the floor. The Di
rector is seated in the front row
of the auditorium. The Actor is
stretched out on the couch, while
the Actress is seated on the chair
beside him. The stage is very dim
but a sign is posted on a flat: "Re
hearsal 7:30 sharp. Be there!" It
is now 8 o'clock.
DIRECTOR: (Rising briskly) All
right, everybody!
(There is a general murmur.)
ACTOR: (Under his breath) !
ACTRESS: One shouldn't com
plain.
ACTOR: It is now 8 o'clock.
Thirty hours a week — eight
weeks—24o hours—four units —
figure it out! Am I a student
here or an actor?
ACTRESS: (Sympathetically) A
student.
ACTOR: Oh! That's the way it is,
eh? Well, pardon me, Miss Cor
nell!
ACTRESS: All right then, an
actor.
ACTOR: Still there are studies, as
you say.
(A man enters)
MAN: No smoking.
(The actor put out his cigarette.
The Man exits.)
ACTOR: (Lighting another) What
time is it?
ACTRESS: Eight-fifteen.
DIRECTOR: (Shouting) What
time is it, anybody? Why aren't
we starting?
ACTOR: (Under his breath) You
tell us!
MAN: (Entering) There are a few
more lights to be adjusted, Mr.
Director. No smoking.

DIRECTOR: (Puffing resentfully)
Thanks. (He lights another as
the Man goes out.)
(A Reviewer comes in. There is a
chorus of "Hello!" from Hun
dreds of People as he is recog
nized. The Actress powders her
nose and smiles sweetly.)
REVIEWER: How is the show
coming?
ACTOR: I don't want you to quote
me, but—
REVIEWER: I won't.
ACTOR: Oh. (He sulks.)
REVIEWER: (To actress) How do
you like your part?
ACTOR: Her part is all right, it's
fine. However, let me tell you
about my part.
REVIEWER: (Looking away) Is
that the director there? Excuse
me. (He goes out.)
ACTOR: Power of the press.
ACTRESS: Cad! (She gets up, fol
lows the Reviewer.)
DIRECTOR: (Shouting) What
time is it, anybody? Why aren't
we started?
MAN: (Entering) Eight-thirty.
Mrs. Outfitter wants to know why
more people haven't come in to
see about their costumes. The
lights are almost ready. There
are only a few more pieces of
scenery to shift. Where's the
stage manager? Hasn't he come
yet? The prompter wants to
know how many pages were
written in yesterday. No smok
ing.
DIRECTOR: (Shouting) Just re
membered a phone call. Be
right back. Everybody be ready
to go when I get back!
(Time passes.)
ACTOR: Nine o'clock? My God!
COSTUME MISTRESS: (Rushing
in waving scissors) Actor! Actor!
ACTOR: Here I am.
(She rushes over to him, clips off
half his tic.)
COSTUME MISTRESS: There,
that's better.
ACTOR: I think so, yes. (He lights
a cigarette)
(The Man enters.)
MAN: No smoking.
ACTOR: Cigarette?
MAN: Thanks. (Lights it, blows
puff of smoke in air, go£s out.
The Actor sinks back on the
couch as—
