# A 						Candid View of Photochemistry
## 
### 
An unusual term is about to
come into general use, and it is
never a bad idea to find out ex
actly what it means. Next week
there will be one such term in use
on the Stanford campus. That
term is photochemistry; for next,
week, from the eighth to the elev
enth, the greatest photochemists
from all over the world will con
vene here, in a three-day session,
intent on finding out why God
said, "Let There Be Light," and on
resting up for a strenuous pack
trip into the Sierras.
To many people, photochemistry
suggests the science which springs
to the aid of the candid camera
fiend, but this, though il may be
photography, and even art, is not

photochemistry, or chemistry at
all, for the most part. It is physics,
with photochemistry involved only
insofar as one's interest is princi
pally in what changes are induced
in the silver bromide of the film
by the impinging light. Yet photo
chemistry as a word is derived
from two others: photo, meaning
light, and chemistry, meaning, of
course, chemistry.
Any reaction which is influenced
by the presence, or intensity, of
light, is a photochemical reaction.
On the other side of the picture,
involving the production of light
rather than its effects, the glow
worm remains the peer of all mod
ern and ancient chlorine and hy
drogen, imperceptible in the dark.

but explosive in the light, or the
gradual oxidation of calomel to
poisonous corrosive sublimate in
strong illumination, is still another
field of this important branch of
chemistry.
The conference should bring
about discussions of interest to
every intelligent Stanford layman,
as well as to chemistry students.
The discussions will touch di
rectly on many phases of our daily
life and habits; and since they are
conducted among people who know
what they are talking about, they
are important. Stanford therefore
feels delighted that she can play
host to this interesting and dis
tinguished group of gentlemen.
