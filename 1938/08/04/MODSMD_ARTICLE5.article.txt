LARGEST SINGLE PUBLISHING
VENTURE EVER TO BE

undertaken by the Stanford Uni
versity Press, B. Roland Lewis'
"The Shakespeare Documents" will
be released early in 1939, it was
announced today.
Literally a landmark in the his
tory of Shakespearean research,
Dr. Lewis' two-volume work in
corporates the results of 19 years
of painstaking study. The books
will contain 60 facsimiles repro
duced from especially prepared
photographs of virtually every
Shakespeare document in exist
ence. Every technical art known to
the photographic science has been
used to screen off ink-blotches,
grease - spots, wine - slops, and
blood-spots so as to bring the hid
den writing clearly to light.
Following chronological order
throughout, the texts of li The
Shakespeare Documents" are new
and independent transcripts of the
original works, with fresh English
translations of the difficult Me
dieval Latin. Each item is treated
in a critical commentary which
points out its significance as a
whole and in its details. Material
on such topics as law, tithes, mid

wifery, and medicine is made ac
cessible for the first time in this
comprehensive work.
Every document has been fully
and critically edited in the light
of the original printed and manu
script source materials with due
consideration of legal nature, his
torical-political background, fam
ily considerations, literary and
theatrical tendencies, and bio
graphical significance.
Of "Shakespeare Documents,"
Stanford's Professor Hardin Craig
has said, "The book is written with
sustained spirit and enthusiasm.
The author shows great ingenuity
in discovering unknown and ill
understood aspects."
A professor of English and di
rector of the Shakespeare Labora
tory at the University of Utah, Dr.
B. Roland Lewis is one of the
world's leading Shakespeare schol
ars. He has studied at the Folger

Library, and at the British Mu
