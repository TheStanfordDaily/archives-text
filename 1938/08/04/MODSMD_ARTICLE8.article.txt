STANFORD WILL HAVE
THE HEAVIEST LINE
IN COAST FOOTBALL

next year. There is the possibil
ity of putting a team on the field
which, from tackle to tackle, will
average around 215 pounds plus
the addition of a couple of ends
who weigh over 200 each.
This is how it works. Anderson
and Zagar, last year's regular
tackles, and West and Donahue,
who made such brililant showings
in the tackle spots this last spring
practice, will all learn the guard
positions so that they may be in
terchanged between tackle and
guard. Tiny Thornhill, therefore,
can send these big boys in against
the opposition and be sure that no
one will push them around.

MONK MOSCRIP, ONE OF
STANFORD'S GREATEST ENDS,

has good reason to smile broadly,
for word has just been received
that Monk has signed a contract to
play professional football with the
Detroit Lions next fall.
Moscrip was a member of the
"Vowing Sophomores" of three
years ago who beat California and
S.C. three times and were in the
Rose Bowl as many times. Besides
being an unanimous choice for AU-
American in 1935 and 1936 Monk
was one of Stanford's dash men on
the track team.
Moscrip has already left for the
East with his wife, the former
Mary Wright, who is a graduate
of Stanford.

THEY CLAIM IT'S A BAD
THING TO SAY,
"I TOLD YOU SO,"

but that is the only out that this
column has after predicting a very
close game between the winless
Wildcats and the "not-so-hot" For
eign Legion and then to have the
game end in the tightest kind of a
tie, 12-12.
The Accordians, stung by the
lashing fight talk of "Pa" Kennedy,
went out and mopped up the field
with the Slave Drivers, who,
minus the services of one-time
major league prospect Bob Gray
son, went to pieces and spent most
of the afternoon in the bleachers
looking for wild pitches. Mean
while the Accordians went about
picking up runs like gathering
strawberries in May, and collected
12 runs while the "old men" were
garnering 9.
The Vultures spent the after
noon making mud pies and still
beat the Bushmen, 9-1. The Legal
Eagles played drop the handker
chief with the baseball and conse
quently were beaten in no uncer
tain fashion by the Outlaws, 11-5.
The Cardinals, who until the
present have been playing very
"how-do-you-do" baseball, were
out to lunch for the afternoon as

they dropped a game to the Prune
Pickers, 14-8.
Today the Wheel Chair League
finishes league play and on Friday
starts the elimination tournament.
El Toro by virtue of its unblem
ished record wins the league title,
but it is indeed a rare thing when
the winners of the league also win
the tournament.
With today's games yet to be
played the standings are as fol
lows:
Won Lost
El Toro 8 0
Prune Pickers 8 2
Outlaws 7 3
Slave Drivers 7 3
Legal Eagles 6 3

Vantors 3 6

STANFORD WILL HAVE
THE HEAVIEST LINE
IN COAST FOOTBALL

next year. There is the possibil
ity of putting a team on the field
which, from tackle to tackle, will
average around 215 pounds plus
the addition of a couple of ends
who weigh over 200 each.
This is how it works. Anderson
and Zagar, last year's regular
tackles, and West and Donahue,
who made such brililant showings
in the tackle spots this last spring
practice, will all learn the guard
positions so that they may be in
terchanged between tackle and
guard. Tiny Thornhill, therefore,
can send these big boys in against
the opposition and be sure that no
one will push them around.

MONK MOSCRIP, ONE OF
STANFORD'S GREATEST ENDS,

has good reason to smile broadly,
for word has just been received
that Monk has signed a contract to
play professional football with the
Detroit Lions next fall.
Moscrip was a member of the
"Vowing Sophomores" of three
years ago who beat California and
S.C. three times and were in the
Rose Bowl as many times. Besides
being an unanimous choice for AU-
American in 1935 and 1936 Monk
was one of Stanford's dash men on
the track team.
Moscrip has already left for the
East with his wife, the former
Mary Wright, who is a graduate
of Stanford.

THEY CLAIM IT'S A BAD
THING TO SAY,
"I TOLD YOU SO,"

but that is the only out that this
column has after predicting a very
close game between the winless
Wildcats and the "not-so-hot" For
eign Legion and then to have the
game end in the tightest kind of a
tie, 12-12.
The Accordians, stung by the
lashing fight talk of "Pa" Kennedy,
went out and mopped up the field
with the Slave Drivers, who,
minus the services of one-time
major league prospect Bob Gray
son, went to pieces and spent most
of the afternoon in the bleachers
looking for wild pitches. Mean
while the Accordians went about
picking up runs like gathering
strawberries in May, and collected
12 runs while the "old men" were
garnering 9.
The Vultures spent the after
noon making mud pies and still
beat the Bushmen, 9-1. The Legal
Eagles played drop the handker
chief with the baseball and conse
quently were beaten in no uncer
tain fashion by the Outlaws, 11-5.
The Cardinals, who until the
present have been playing very
"how-do-you-do" baseball, were
out to lunch for the afternoon as

they dropped a game to the Prune
Pickers, 14-8.
Today the Wheel Chair League
finishes league play and on Friday
starts the elimination tournament.
El Toro by virtue of its unblem
ished record wins the league title,
but it is indeed a rare thing when
the winners of the league also win
the tournament.
With today's games yet to be
played the standings are as fol
lows:
Won Lost
El Toro 8 0
Prune Pickers 8 2
Outlaws 7 3
Slave Drivers 7 3
Legal Eagles 6 3
Accordians 6 4

Vantors 3 6
