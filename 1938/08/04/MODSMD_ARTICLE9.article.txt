Is it true what they say about
Samson J. P. Cahn? According to
reports, the "Jeep" went into the
Union barber shop to get his su
perabundant hair cut short enough
to allow him to wear a wig as Un
cle Tom. Upon leaving, he forgot
to take his notebook. Returning
to the barber shop a few minutes
later, he was startled to hear the
barber say, "Just take a seat, sir.
I'll be ready for you in a few
minutes."
Funny to everyone but Aubrey
Austin was the rehearsal fall from
a 12-foot wall onto an allegedly
soft mattress. How was he to
know that someone had set a plank
down on the mattress. The school
of hard knocks claims another
alumnus.

Mr. Heberer wants it definitely
understood that Uncle Tom's Cab
in will not be burlesqued or chang
ed in any way except that the scen
ery will be modernized. Other
wise, the play remains the same as
it was when originally staged in
1851.
