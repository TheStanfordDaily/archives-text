Reaching its peak Saturday eve
ning, the cast literally outdid it
self in response to a most appre
ciative audience. Surprising to
many was the dexterity of J. P.
Cahn in his portrayal of that lov
able old character, Uncle Tom. In
walk, talk, and song Cahn kept the
audience with him to the end.
Bud Cady and Shirley Jones
share the comedian's honors with
their brilliant interpretations of
Phineas Fletcher and Topsy, re
spectively. Cady with his punch
lines and hill-billy accent literally
brought down the house, while
Shirley, with her irrascible actions
and songs, built it up.
Ted Hatlen's imitation of W. C.
Fields, while very good as such,
seemed definitely out of place.
Harriet Touton as Eliza lacked the
needed finesse, while John Hove,
playing opposite her, tended to
over-act. 1
Faculty to the fore: both Bob
Ross and Lee Chapin were very
impressive in their respective
parts. Ross playing the part of the
lawyer, Marks, definitely outshone
his company, while Chapin, as little
Eva's father, commanded the re
spect and admiration of all, for his
handling of monologues.
