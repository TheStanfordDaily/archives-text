# Gringo's Gamble
## 
### 
Felton Elkins, author of "Gringo's
Gamble," which will be presented
here next week by the Division of
Speech and Drama, is watching re
hearsals along with Director Gor
don Lange. He has even revised
the play to make the characters
young enough to be played more
convincingly by college actors.
Mr. Elkins feels that the virtue
of his play lies in the fact that it
has recaptured the qualities which
made "The Girl of the Golden
West" so robust a drama together
with the atmosphere which gave
"The Rose of the Rancho" much of
its romantic charm. Also he has
used modern stagecraft to provide
a quickly changing background of
settings, to permit swift, continu
ous action and uninterrupted con
trast and play of character.
An Irishman named Hugh Drury
once made a deep impression on
Mr. Elkins and, when he became
interested in finding out just why
the railroad didn't go through San
Juan Bautista, he stumbled on the
very setting for a story about Hugh
Drury, who is the Dan Murphy of
"Gringo's Gamble," played by Jack
Gillis.
As early California history in
spires the writing of Felton Elkins,
it inspired the life of his Gringo
grandfather, Charles N. Felton,
who came around the Horn in a
Yankee clipper in '49, arriving at
the port of San Francisco with
seven silver dimes in his pocket.
Felton Elkins spent his youth in
California and attended school in
the East, taking work at Harvard,
where he first met Eugene O'Neill.
