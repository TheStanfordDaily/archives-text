Two plays, banned last week
from radio broadcasts by the

next Monday night in the Women's
Clubhouse, sponsored by the Stan
ford Dramatists. The plays are
"Camarados" by Norman Evanson
and "The Last One" by Bessie Col

"Camarados" favors the Loyalist
side of the Spanish Revolution,
while "The Last One" is a miracle

the universe and the passing of the
last Jew.
In addition to these plays, "The
Apple by Albert Highet will also
be read. The readings will begin
at 8 o'clock.
