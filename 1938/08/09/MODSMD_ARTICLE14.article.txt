Aubrey Austin, scrapper de-luxe
of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and his
room-mate, Charley Hildebrandt,
entertained friends and Daily re
porters at a house-warming party
after Friday evening's perform
ance. Relaxing were members of
the cast, jubilant were members of
the Division of Speech and Drama,
whose fine work received deserved
acclaim, and busy were the re
porters.
News to many may be the fact
that Felton Elkins, author of
"Gringo's Gamble," is the son of
Mrs. Kate Felton Elkins who was
an active benefactor of Stanford
University. Mrs. Elkins' gifts, ac
cording to Library Director Van
Patten, included the Charlotte
Ashley Felton Memorial Library
and its endowment, the George
Loomis Fellowship in American
Literature, as well as gifts to the
Stanford University Hospitals and
the Stanford Convalescent Home.

Mr. Elkins is very enthusiastic in
his approval of our actors and their
spirit, saying that he has found
them to be "much more intelligent
and enthusiastic than many of the
actors I met when in Province
own among the 'hams and half
wits.' Not only that, but they are
able to do what few professional
actors can—that is, sustain a scene
while taking directions."
Good for a hearty laugh are the
members of Helen Green's make
up class who are at present en
gaged in practicing the art of
schnozzolarging. The effects which
some of them obtain with a bit of
cotton, spirit gum, and grease
paint would put Pinnochio, Du
rante and Cyrano de Berberac to
shame.

So successful was the projection
experiment in "Uncle Tom's
Cabin" that a Utah theater man
who saw the show has asked Mr.
Johansen to build him some pro
jectors of the same type.
Dr. and Mrs. Basset are now at
Sproat Lake, Vancouver Island,
8.C., where they are enjoying
themselves "just rusticatin'," ac

cording to word received by Mr.
Barker recently. Due to a severe
forest fire nearby, the visibility has
been limited, but so far, it hasn't
impeded Dr. Bassett's fishing.
Goi'don Davis former director
here, staying with his sisters, Miss
Margaret Davis and Mrs. Helen
Watts of College Terrace, is being
entertained by old friends at nu
merous luncheons and is enjoying
renewing old acquaintances.
