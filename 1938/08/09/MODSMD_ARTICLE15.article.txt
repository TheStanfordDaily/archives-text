# INTERVIEW

### 
Mr. James Sayre Sandoe has re
turned to the campus for the
month of August. Old-timers will
remember Mr. Sandoe as a shining
light in campus dramatics about
four years ago, as well as dra
matic critic on The Stanford Daily.
Mr. Sandoe went to Columbia for
his M.A. and is now an instructor
in English literature at the Uni
versity of Colorado.
During the Dramatists Assembly
to be held here the latter part of
this month, Mr. Sandoe will con
duct a seminar as well as read the
prize play in the Verse Drama Con
test of 1938. The winner of the
Maxwell Anderson award will be
announced in Thursday's Daily. Mr.
Sandoe is one of the judges.
Commenting on the past season
in Stanford Dramatics, Mr. Sandoe
said that it was one of the most
ambitious college programs he had
ever seen. Including such plays as
"Johnny Johnson," "Kind Lady,"
"Star Wagon," and "Blue Jeans,"
it embodied both established hits
and new plays. He said that he
heard people laughed at "Star
Wagon" because they felt it was
not up to Maxwell Anderson's
usual standard, but he feels that
thus was a little unjustified. A play

can below that standard and
still be good, he feels.
Mr. Sandoe saw "Uncle Tom's
Cabin" and praised it highly. J. P.
Cahn as Uncle Tom was superb, he
said. He considers Cahn's voice
one of the best he has heard.
Remarking that plays at the
University of Colorado are pre
sented to a full house, he feels that
perhaps there Ls not enough student
interest here at Stanford. He shud
dered at the suggested possibility
of a cliquish dramatic group here.
He remarked that when he was at
Stanford there were often 200 try
outees for a play, including engi
neers and chemists. Mr. Sandoe be
lieves that when this latter group
comes out, dramatics are reaching
the whole student body.
