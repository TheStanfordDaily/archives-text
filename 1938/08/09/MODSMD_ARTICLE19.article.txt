Since little has happened recently
in the way of Stanford sports, it is
well to take a moment off for a re
hash of summer highlights.
Comes the word by way of Bill
Leiser of the Chronicle that How
ard Hickingbotham, one of Coach
Tiny Thornhill's best prospects for
left end this coming season, was
unanimously elected the best look
ing man at Lake Tahoe.
Pete Fay is rapidly rounding into
condition for football, not by cross
country runs or by swinging an axe
in the approved training fashion,
but by playing badminton. It's a
fast game when played on hard
courts, and all Pete was able to
say after a recent match was, "Gee!
That's really a brutal sport."
Jack Walton has been doing
campaign work for Governor Mer
riam. His favorite saying is, "Boys,
you'd better get on that big Mer
riam machine which is really roll
ing." Sounds strangely like a
Stanford expression.
Bob Mangan, a tackle of two
years ago, recently became engaged
to Jean Macmillan, a former Stan
ford student.
Wally Brooke, a former student
body president of Stanford who is
now a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford,
was a member of the Oxford team
that came to the United States to
compete against the teams of the
Ivy League. His pole vaulting has
reached nearly 12 feet, and he is
also a Blue, the British equivalent
of all-American.
