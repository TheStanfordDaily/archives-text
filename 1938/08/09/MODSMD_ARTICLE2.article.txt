"Hospitals are the health centers
of the community," acording to Dr.
Robin C. Buerki, president-elect of
the American College of Hospital
Administrators, who addressed the
opening session of the Western In
stitute for Hospital Administrators
at Lagunita Court yesterday.
In conclusion, Dr. Buerki said,
"Hospitals in the future will be
increasingly significant as educa
tional institutions, and their skillful
management is dependent upon a
sound economic basis. They will
be used for the training of medical
specialists and for continuing the

education of physicians made nec
essary by the rapid strides of
medical progress."
Walter H. Brown, director of the
Stanford University Health Serv
ice, in the second seminar dis
cussed "The Relation of Hospitals
to Public Health."
"The safest place to handle all
kinds of disease is in a hospital.
Public health must find a greater
use of hospital facilities if it is to
secure adequate health levels for
the community," Dr. Brown stated.
