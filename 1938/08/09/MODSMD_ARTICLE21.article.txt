# The 						Guest Columnist
## 
### L. R. BATMAN 
(The editor takes pleasure in
presenting the man who trans
forms our illegible copy into a
readable newspaper—the linotype
operator — whom we all salute
with thumbs on noses and fin
gers fluttering.)
The sleepy-eyed cook-waiter
cashier-dishwasher dealt the ham
burgers, muttering: "With, with
out, without, with, with, without."
I took a bite of mine, with onions
and mustard and without relish,
and looked at Mr. Ballard, with
out relish. "How about writing
our guest column?" he was asking.
Everyone looked at me and one
who had the courage of his doubts
said, "Who, him? A linotype op
erator wouldn't have an idea."
Mr. Ballard blushed. "Oh, he
might."
"But he can't write."
"Maybe he can," said Mr. Bal
lard, courteously.
"Another hamburger!" someone
shouted. "With!"
Being of the conviction based on
long-suffering observation that
Daily columnists neither think nor
write, I, an humble linotype oper
ator, decided then and there that I
was not unsuited to the produc
tion of a column. The procedure
of its manufacture seems to be to
place oneself before a typewriter,
stop whatever thoughts may be
germinating, and begin an idle ex
perimentation with the touch
system. After filling a few sheets
of paper with miscellaneous ar
rangements of the alphabet, the
columnist arouses himself suffi
ciently to write his name and then
goes to look for a hamburger.
If a linotype keyboard were sub
stituted for the typewriter, the
product probably would be some
what different because of the dif
ferent arrangement of the keys.
And, figuratively speaking, since
combustion would take place at the *
wrong cycle of the journalistic en
gine, the result would surely be a
literary back-fire.
A rather gaunt and awkward
youth just out of high school
matriculates at Stanford. Phys
ically he is unsuited for football,
basketball or track, though, if it
weren't for his thick-lensed glasses
he might get onto the baseball
squad. Something in his biolog
ical make-up draws him diag
onally across the campus from
Encina toward Lagunita. Just
within sight of this haven of charm,
he hears the flutter of skirts and
dives frantically for the nearest
doorway, which happens to be the
front entrance of the Stanford
Daily shack.
Inside, of all things, he sees a

woman. She is woman's editor of
the Daily and she looks at him as
an ant looks at an aphid. He turns
to fly to other unknown evils. But
the lips of the woman's editor
curve into a smile that restrains
him. Though he may not know it,
he is now a tryoutee.
Autumn quarter passes. The try
outee sees his name in the Daily's
mast-head as a reporter. He is se
curely caught by his ego. Winter
quarter he registers for Journal
ism I. He has now changed his in
tellectual diapers for journalistic
panty-waists.
He gets his first by-line. For
days thereafter he can see only
tree-tops, tiled roofs, and ceilings.
But midquarter grades and little
slips that come in the mail turn
his eyes toward his feet and his
feet toward the library.
The habit-forming by-line grad
ually seduces him. This habit can
be broken only by the Bawlout,
and he manages to chart a twisting
course between its pluses and
minuses despite the journalistic
virus that pollutes his brain.
Next year he is given a column
to write. (The man who wrote it
last year has been graduated.) The
title of the column is "Bull Ses
sion," which is indefinite enough
to cover a world of journalistic
sins. The function of this column
is to pester the administration,
chasten the 8.A.C., pan the Union,
assault the A.S.S.U., and find bad
in everything.
For two years he delights in the
privileges of a columnist and is
considered by the editor to be
very good because people with in
jured feelings and intellects re
spond voluminously with Campus
Opinions. Then he is made night
editor.
His duty as night editor is to
act as go-between for the editorial

staff and the back-shop. If his job
were on a newspaper instead of
the Daily he would be called a
copy-boy. One of his most im
portant activities in this job is to
avoid bodily harm at the hands of
the back-shop employees, who re
gard night editors in somewhat the
same manner as dogs regard fleas.
Surviving the hazard of this frail
rung of the ladder, he is made an
associate editor. There are two
associate editors and the duty of
each is to himself. He must write
cleverer editorials than his rival
in order to show the staff that he
is the better prospect for editor.
Our friend can do this easily be
cause as Bull Session columnist he
has learned the art of calumny.
Two weeks before the editorial
election he undergoes a remarkable
change in personality. There are
women to be smiled at and fellows
to be flattered if votes are to be
won. This requires an artful mix
ture of aggression and restraint
which our candidate by now pos
sesses. So he becomes editor.
As editor his job, if he wishes to
stay in school, is to keep others on
the staff from doing what he has
done, for gradually during the last

four years the administrative reins
have tightened and the collegiate
journalist is being transformed into
a gentleman.
He graduates, Glory Be to God!
And what about his future? He
might get a job as copy boy on a
San Francisco paper and learn to
be a newspaperman.

he is now a tryoutee.
Autumn quarter passes. The try
outee sees his name in the Daily's
mast-head as a reporter. He is se
curely caught by his ego. Winter
quarter he registers for Journal
ism I. He has now changed his in
tellectual diapers for journalistic
panty-waists.
He gets his first by-line. For
days thereafter he can see only
tree-tops, tiled roofs, and ceilings.
But midquarter grades and little
slips that come in the mail turn
his eyes toward his feet and his
feet toward the library.
The habit-forming by-line grad
ually seduces him. This habit can
be broken only by the Bawlout,
and he manages to chart a twisting
course between its pluses and
minuses despite the journalistic
virus that pollutes his brain.
Next year he is given a column
to write. (The man who wrote it
last year has been graduated.) The
title of the column is "Bull Ses
sion," which is indefinite enough
to cover a world of journalistic
sins. The function of this column
is to pester the administration,
chasten the 8.A.C., pan the Union,
assault the A.S.S.U., and find bad
in everything.
For two years he delights in the
privileges of a columnist and is
considered by the editor to be
very good because people with in
jured feelings and intellects re
spond voluminously with Campus
Opinions. Then he is made night
editor.
His duty as night editor is to
act as go-between for the editorial

staff and the back-shop. If his job
were on a newspaper instead of
the Daily he would be called a
copy-boy. One of his most im
portant activities in this job is to
avoid bodily harm at the hands of
the back-shop employees, who re
gard night editors in somewhat the
same manner as dogs regard fleas.
Surviving the hazard of this frail
rung of the ladder, he is made an
associate editor. There are two
associate editors and the duty of
each is to himself. He must write
cleverer editorials than his rival
in order to show the staff that he
is the better prospect for editor.
Our friend can do this easily be
cause as Bull Session columnist he
has learned the art of calumny.
Two weeks before the editorial
election he undergoes a remarkable
change in personality. There are
women to be smiled at and fellows
to be flattered if votes are to be
won. This requires an artful mix
ture of aggression and restraint
which our candidate by now pos
sesses. So he becomes editor.
As editor his job, if he wishes to
stay in school, is to keep others on
the staff from doing what he has
done, for gradually during the last

four years the administrative reins
have tightened and the collegiate
journalist is being transformed into
a gentleman.
He graduates, Glory Be to God!
And what about his future? He
might get a job as copy boy on a
San Francisco paper and learn to
be a newspaperman.
(The editor takes pleasure in

forms our illegible copy into a

The sleepy-eyed cook-waiter
cashier-dishwasher dealt the ham
burgers, muttering: "With, with
out, without, with, with, without."
I took a bite of mine, with onions
and mustard and without relish,
and looked at Mr. Ballard, with
out relish. "How about writing
our guest column?" he was asking.
Everyone looked at me and one
who had the courage of his doubts
said, "Who, him? A linotype op
erator wouldn't have an idea."
Mr. Ballard blushed. "Oh, he
might."
"But he can't write."
"Maybe he can," said Mr. Bal
lard, courteously.
"Another hamburger!" someone
shouted. "With!"
Being of the conviction based on
long-suffering observation that
Daily columnists neither think nor
write, I, an humble linotype oper
ator, decided then and there that I
was not unsuited to the produc
tion of a column. The procedure
of its manufacture seems to be to
place oneself before a typewriter,
stop whatever thoughts may be
germinating, and begin an idle ex
perimentation with the touch
system. After filling a few sheets
of paper with miscellaneous ar
rangements of the alphabet, the
columnist arouses himself suffi
ciently to write his name and then
goes to look for a hamburger.
If a linotype keyboard were sub
stituted for the typewriter, the
product probably would be some
what different because of the dif
ferent arrangement of the keys.
And, figuratively speaking, since
combustion would take place at the *
wrong cycle of the journalistic en
gine, the result would surely be a
literary back-fire.
A rather gaunt and awkward
youth just out of high school
matriculates at Stanford. Phys

basketball or track, though, if it
weren't for his thick-lensed glasses
he might get onto the baseball
squad. Something in his biolog
ical make-up draws him diag
onally across the campus from
Encina toward Lagunita. Just
within sight of this haven of charm,
he hears the flutter of skirts and
dives frantically for the nearest
doorway, which happens to be the
front entrance of the Stanford
Daily shack.
Inside, of all things, he sees a

woman. She is woman's editor of
the Daily and she looks at him as
an ant looks at an aphid. He turns
to fly to other unknown evils. But
the lips of the woman's editor
curve into a smile that restrains
him. Though he may not know it,

have tightened and the collegiate
journalist is being transformed into
a gentleman.
He graduates, Glory Be to God!
And what about his future? He
might get a job as copy boy on a
San Francisco paper and learn to
be a newspaperman.
(The editor takes pleasure in
presenting the man who trans
forms our illegible copy into a
readable newspaper—the linotype
operator — whom we all salute
with thumbs on noses and fin
gers fluttering.)
The sleepy-eyed cook-waiter
cashier-dishwasher dealt the ham
burgers, muttering: "With, with
out, without, with, with, without."
I took a bite of mine, with onions
and mustard and without relish,
and looked at Mr. Ballard, with
out relish. "How about writing
our guest column?" he was asking.
Everyone looked at me and one
who had the courage of his doubts
said, "Who, him? A linotype op
erator wouldn't have an idea."
Mr. Ballard blushed. "Oh, he
might."
"But he can't write."
"Maybe he can," said Mr. Bal
lard, courteously.
"Another hamburger!" someone
shouted. "With!"
Being of the conviction based on
long-suffering observation that
Daily columnists neither think nor
write, I, an humble linotype oper
ator, decided then and there that I
was not unsuited to the produc
tion of a column. The procedure
of its manufacture seems to be to
place oneself before a typewriter,
stop whatever thoughts may be
germinating, and begin an idle ex
perimentation with the touch
system. After filling a few sheets
of paper with miscellaneous ar
rangements of the alphabet, the
columnist arouses himself suffi
ciently to write his name and then
goes to look for a hamburger.
If a linotype keyboard were sub
stituted for the typewriter, the
product probably would be some
what different because of the dif
ferent arrangement of the keys.
And, figuratively speaking, since
combustion would take place at the *
wrong cycle of the journalistic en
gine, the result would surely be a
literary back-fire.
A rather gaunt and awkward
youth just out of high school
matriculates at Stanford. Phys
ically he is unsuited for football,
basketball or track, though, if it
weren't for his thick-lensed glasses
he might get onto the baseball
squad. Something in his biolog
ical make-up draws him diag
onally across the campus from
Encina toward Lagunita. Just
within sight of this haven of charm,
he hears the flutter of skirts and
dives frantically for the nearest
doorway, which happens to be the
front entrance of the Stanford
Daily shack.
Inside, of all things, he sees a

woman. She is woman's editor of
the Daily and she looks at him as
an ant looks at an aphid. He turns
to fly to other unknown evils. But
the lips of the woman's editor
curve into a smile that restrains
him. Though he may not know it,
he is now a tryoutee.
Autumn quarter passes. The try
outee sees his name in the Daily's
mast-head as a reporter. He is se
curely caught by his ego. Winter
quarter he registers for Journal
ism I. He has now changed his in
tellectual diapers for journalistic
panty-waists.
He gets his first by-line. For
days thereafter he can see only
tree-tops, tiled roofs, and ceilings.
But midquarter grades and little
slips that come in the mail turn
his eyes toward his feet and his
feet toward the library.
The habit-forming by-line grad
ually seduces him. This habit can
be broken only by the Bawlout,
and he manages to chart a twisting
course between its pluses and
minuses despite the journalistic
virus that pollutes his brain.
Next year he is given a column
to write. (The man who wrote it
last year has been graduated.) The
title of the column is "Bull Ses
sion," which is indefinite enough
to cover a world of journalistic
sins. The function of this column
is to pester the administration,
chasten the 8.A.C., pan the Union,
assault the A.S.S.U., and find bad
in everything.
For two years he delights in the
privileges of a columnist and is
considered by the editor to be
very good because people with in
jured feelings and intellects re
spond voluminously with Campus
Opinions. Then he is made night
editor.
His duty as night editor is to
act as go-between for the editorial

staff and the back-shop. If his job
were on a newspaper instead of
the Daily he would be called a
copy-boy. One of his most im
portant activities in this job is to
avoid bodily harm at the hands of
the back-shop employees, who re
gard night editors in somewhat the
same manner as dogs regard fleas.
Surviving the hazard of this frail
rung of the ladder, he is made an
associate editor. There are two
associate editors and the duty of
each is to himself. He must write
cleverer editorials than his rival
in order to show the staff that he
is the better prospect for editor.
Our friend can do this easily be
cause as Bull Session columnist he
has learned the art of calumny.
Two weeks before the editorial
election he undergoes a remarkable
change in personality. There are
women to be smiled at and fellows
to be flattered if votes are to be
won. This requires an artful mix
ture of aggression and restraint
which our candidate by now pos
sesses. So he becomes editor.
As editor his job, if he wishes to
stay in school, is to keep others on
the staff from doing what he has
done, for gradually during the last

four years the administrative reins
have tightened and the collegiate
journalist is being transformed into
a gentleman.
He graduates, Glory Be to God!
And what about his future? He
