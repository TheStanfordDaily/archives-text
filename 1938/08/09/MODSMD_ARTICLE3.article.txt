## Photochemists Confer 
### 
The idea of molecules, split into
their component fractions by the
action of light, behaving like an
animal trying to get out of a cage
was advanced yesterday by James
Franck, Nobel prize winner in
physics, at the Stanford summer
conference on photochemistry.
Professor Franck, visiting chem
ist at Stanford, told eminent pho
tochemists of the United States his
theories of what happens when
light is absorbed by certain mole
cules that are sensitive to it. lo
dine, for example, breaks up into
two separate atoms when light hits
itâ€”that is why iodine bottles are
made of dark glass. When iodine is
placed in solution in water, where
light can reach it, the "animal-in
cage" behavior begins. Light dis
sociates the iodine molecule. The
two atoms resulting from this split
ting process start off on their dy
namic paths, alone. But they are
surrounded by molecules of water.
The iodine atoms bounce against
these water molecules, as though
they were surrounded by a cage.
