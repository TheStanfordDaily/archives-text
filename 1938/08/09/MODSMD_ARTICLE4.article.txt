# 'Molecular Cage'
## 
### 
Sometimes, however, the atoms
succeed in getting out of the mole
cular cage which first surrounded
them. From there on they collide
successively with other molecules
of water. A much longer time then
elapses before the atoms will col
lide with each other again to re
combine.
The collision rate inside of the
molecular cage is greater, natur
ally, than the likelihood of collision
between the atoms once they are
outside the cage. The measurable
difference between the rates led
Professor Franck to evolve his the
ory of the behavior of such light
shattering molecules.
