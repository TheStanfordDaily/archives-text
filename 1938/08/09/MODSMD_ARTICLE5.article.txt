Announcement of a new prin
ciple to explain the behavior of
some chemical molecules when
they are exposed to, light stirred
comment at the afternoon session
of the conference at Lagunita
Court yesterday.
G. K. Rollefson, professor of
chemistry at the University of
California, said certain molecules
he had studied—especially the al
dehydes—lead him to believe that
a process of resonance takes place
when light is absorbed.
He likened this process to a fa
miliar musical phenomenon. When
a musician plays a strong note on
a violin, the string nearby will
give off a corresponding sound. So,
when light enters the molecule of
formaldehyde, for example, it ex
cites electrons on one "side" of the
molecule to a heightened state of
energy.
This transfer of energy from the
light quantum to the electrons at
the point of entry is a new theory
in physical chemistry, scientists
said, and helps to explain many
hitherto inexplicable properties of
molecules.
The conference at Lagunita will
continue for the rest of the week.
Eminent scientists from all over the
country will present papers.
