# A 						Football Star Forecasts

### STAN ANDERSON 
I wonder how many of you have
ever seen a champion athlete in ac
tion. If you have, you could not
have helped noticing the thing that
made him a standout among his
opponents. True, there was prob
ably a wealth of physical equip
ment, supple muscles and a certain
poetry of motion, but somehow
these weren't the things that im
pressed you.
It was something else—something
almost undefinable, yet so clearly
a part of that champion that with
out it you knew he was just an
other athlete. That something was
a confident, yet determined, will to
win. The 1939 Stanford football
team has that will to win.
A famous football coach once said
that the toughest and strongest
eleven men garnered from the

docks, farms, and forests of the
nation wouldn't have a prayer of
beating the average American col
lege football team. And he was
right. Why? Simply because the
average college team, contrary to
the recent publicity given to the
proselyting of football men, con
sists of eleven eager, enthusiastic
young men, in love with the game
and playing for the sheer joy of
man-to-man competition. That
sort of spirit would defeat all the
might that ever was.
Perhaps never in the history of
Stanford football has an approach
ing season found so much enthus
iasm and eagerness among the
team members. Added to that,
facts and figures themselves show
Stanford to be the best equipped
from a physical standpoint of any

of the west coast teams.
With a fast backfield, weighing
over 200 pounds per man and con
sisting almost entirely of veterans,
there promises to be no difficulty
in the matter of ringing up points.
In the line also there are veterans
galore, and though here the situa
tion is not quite as cut and dried
as in the backfield, opponents will
find the Stanford linemen a fitting
group of shock troops for the pow
erful backs behind.
Even now, though the first game
is nearly two months away, the
football men are practicing daily,
on calisthenics, running, and gen
eral toughening exercises so as to
be in shape on the opening day of
organized practice.
A current of feeling such as I
have never known among football
players is prevalent at these work
outs. There is an obvious grimness
— perhaps not exactly a grimness,
more of a vengeance — the stark
realization of a goal within sight,

the fulfillment of hopes, dreams,
and work.
The average spectator at a foot
ball game, when he watches those
22 men locked together on the
playing field, little realizes the
time, work, and effort spent by
those men and their coaches and
trainers so that he might witness
the high-quality athletic contest

that is being staged for him.
Football is fun, yes, but to ap
proach the degree of perfection that
makes a champion takes work and
the necessity of punishing oneself.
Yet, out of the practice field come
September 10, you will find a group
of men who wouldn't trade 10 min
utes of the grime, the sweat, the
weariness, and the bruises for 10
years as a king.
It is said that collegiate football
is overemphasized. In a certain
light perhaps it is. It is a shame
that the game has become so com
mercialized that people speak of
professionalism among college men
who play for the sheer joy of

sport.
But as to the actual game itself,
to my mind it is impossible to over
emphasize a game that matures
men, that teaches them responsi
bility and loyalty, that shows them
the way of courage and self-reli
ance, and above all that directs the
exhilaration of competition along
constructive channels.
Stanford's team will be a winner
this year. The path to the Rose
Bowl will be no easy one. But one
thing is certain, only a major catas
trophe can dull the ambition of the
Stanford men — an ambition that
will not go unrewarded. We want
the Rose Bowl.

who play for the sheer joy of

sport.
But as to the actual game itself,
to my mind it is impossible to over
emphasize a game that matures
men, that teaches them responsi
bility and loyalty, that shows them
the way of courage and self-reli
ance, and above all that directs the
exhilaration of competition along
constructive channels.
Stanford's team will be a winner
this year. The path to the Rose
Bowl will be no easy one. But one
thing is certain, only a major catas
trophe can dull the ambition of the
Stanford men — an ambition that
will not go unrewarded. We want
the Rose Bowl.


STAN ANDERSON
I wonder how many of you have
ever seen a champion athlete in ac
tion. If you have, you could not
have helped noticing the thing that
made him a standout among his
opponents. True, there was prob
ably a wealth of physical equip
ment, supple muscles and a certain
poetry of motion, but somehow
these weren't the things that im
pressed you.
It was something else—something
almost undefinable, yet so clearly
a part of that champion that with
out it you knew he was just an
other athlete. That something was
a confident, yet determined, will to
win. The 1939 Stanford football
team has that will to win.
A famous football coach once said
that the toughest and strongest
eleven men garnered from the

docks, farms, and forests of the
nation wouldn't have a prayer of
beating the average American col
lege football team. And he was
right. Why? Simply because the
average college team, contrary to
the recent publicity given to the
proselyting of football men, con
sists of eleven eager, enthusiastic
young men, in love with the game
and playing for the sheer joy of
man-to-man competition. That
sort of spirit would defeat all the
might that ever was.
Perhaps never in the history of
Stanford football has an approach
ing season found so much enthus
iasm and eagerness among the
team members. Added to that,
facts and figures themselves show
Stanford to be the best equipped
from a physical standpoint of any

of the west coast teams.
With a fast backfield, weighing
over 200 pounds per man and con
sisting almost entirely of veterans,
there promises to be no difficulty
in the matter of ringing up points.
In the line also there are veterans
galore, and though here the situa
tion is not quite as cut and dried
as in the backfield, opponents will
find the Stanford linemen a fitting
group of shock troops for the pow
erful backs behind.
Even now, though the first game
is nearly two months away, the
football men are practicing daily,
on calisthenics, running, and gen
eral toughening exercises so as to
be in shape on the opening day of
organized practice.
A current of feeling such as I
have never known among football
players is prevalent at these work
outs. There is an obvious grimness
— perhaps not exactly a grimness,
more of a vengeance — the stark
realization of a goal within sight,

the fulfillment of hopes, dreams,
and work.
The average spectator at a foot
ball game, when he watches those
22 men locked together on the
playing field, little realizes the
time, work, and effort spent by
those men and their coaches and
trainers so that he might witness
the high-quality athletic contest

that is being staged for him.
Football is fun, yes, but to ap
proach the degree of perfection that
makes a champion takes work and
the necessity of punishing oneself.
Yet, out of the practice field come
September 10, you will find a group
of men who wouldn't trade 10 min
utes of the grime, the sweat, the
weariness, and the bruises for 10
years as a king.
It is said that collegiate football
is overemphasized. In a certain
light perhaps it is. It is a shame
that the game has become so com
mercialized that people speak of
professionalism among college men
who play for the sheer joy of

sport.
But as to the actual game itself,
to my mind it is impossible to over
emphasize a game that matures
