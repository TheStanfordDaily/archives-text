### STAN ANDERSON 
I wonder how many of you have
ever seen a champion athlete in ac
tion. If you have, you could not
have helped noticing the thing that
made him a standout among his
opponents. True, there was prob
ably a wealth of physical equip
ment, supple muscles and a certain
poetry of motion, but somehow
these weren't the things that im
pressed you.
It was something else—something
almost undefinable, yet so clearly
a part of that champion that with
out it you knew he was just an
other athlete. That something was
a confident, yet determined, will to
win. The 1939 Stanford football
team has that will to win.
A famous football coach once said
that the toughest and strongest
eleven men garnered from the

docks, farms, and forests of the

With a fast backfield, weighing
over 200 pounds per man and con

there promises to be no difficulty
in the matter of ringing up points.
In the line also there are veterans
galore, and though here the situa
tion is not quite as cut and dried
as in the backfield, opponents will
find the Stanford linemen a fitting
group of shock troops for the pow
erful backs behind.
Even now, though the first game
is nearly two months away, the
football men are practicing daily,
on calisthenics, running, and gen
eral toughening exercises so as to
be in shape on the opening day of
organized practice.
