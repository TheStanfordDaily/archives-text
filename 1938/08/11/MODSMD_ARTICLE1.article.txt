How to measure the lifetime of
an atom was described to photo
chemists yesterday by R. G. Dick
inson, professor of chemistry at
the California Institute of Tech
nology.
The Caltech chemist wanted to
find the distance an atom of chlor
ine or bromine travels under given
conditions. To do this, he sur
rounded a test tube with a fine
mesh screen. Light, filtering
through the screen, made a pat
tern, like sunlight filtering through
a shade tree. As Professor Dick
inson changed the mesh from fine
to coarse, thus admitting more
light each time, he found that the
speed of the chemical reaction
within the test tube increased. At
the point where the maximum re
action-speed occurred, he reasoned
that the distance between the
meshes of the screen must be the
distance which his atoms were
traveling during their lifetime.
To check his work, Professor
Dickinson built a different me
chanical set-up. He shot intermit
tent flashes of light at his test tube
through a hole in a revolving disc.
As the disc whirled faster and more
and more light was admitted, he
again got to the maximum reac
tion-time. His results dovetailed,
and Professor Dickinson felt he
had an atomic secret.
