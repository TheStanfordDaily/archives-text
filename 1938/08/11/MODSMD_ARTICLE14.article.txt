Colored lights and summer

dance to be held from 9 to 1
o'clock tomorrow night. Nat
Thomas and his band will feature
"rhythm and rhyme," while the
theme, "Stanford," will be carried
out in the decorations.
"The way the free tickets have
been going, with only a few left,
we are assured a capacity crowd
of 200 couples," stated Preston Hill,
social chairman in charge of the
dance. Those on the committee
were Walt Shenson, Vernon Kruse,
Al Astor, Mike Driscoll, Bill Ryan,
John Hove, Miles Werner, Dick
Mayfield, Oliver Sweningsen, and
