The Wheel Chair League moved
into the semi-finals of its playoff
tournament with the usual abund
ance of lopsided scores and freak
plays. In the game between the
Accordians and the Slave Drivers,
which the "come-to-me-go-from
me" boys won 12-5, Larry Rouble
actually batted himself in.
The way it happened was that
Larry was on third with the bases
full and the Slave Drivers didn't
have any more men to go to bat.
After a brief consultation it was
agreed to let Rouble come in and
bat. He did, and drove a beautiful
Texas leaguer which automatically
scored the "Larry" that was on
third and put the "Larry" that was
batting on second base.
The Prune Pickers, this col
umn's choice to win the tourna
ment, had little trouble in doing
away with the Cardinals, 16-5. The
Vantors brushed by the Vultures,
18-11, and moved into the semi
final bracket opposite the Outlaws,
who had the pixies of good fortune
sitting on their shoulders as they
nosed out the Legal Eagles, 10-9.
Consequently, in the semi-finals
will be the Accordians against the

Prune Pickers with the Pickers a
cinch to win if Pa Kennedy plays;
and the Outlaws against the Van
tors with the Outlaws certain of
getting the nod.
The winner of this foursome will
then play El Toro, the winner of
the league, in the grand final. El
Toro by virtue of its winning of
the league title does not have to
play in the tournament but plays
the winner of the tournament in
the final to decide the winner of the
whole caboodle.
