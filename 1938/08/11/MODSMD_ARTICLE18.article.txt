Hank Luisetti, Stanford's great
est basketball player, in a recent
interview with a San Francisco Ex
aminer correspondent, definitely
reaffirmed his previous statement
that he would never again play
competitive basketball.
He claimed that he could never
again attain the same physical
condition he had at Stanford and
that he ended his collegiate ca
reer at the very height of form
and wants to have memories only
of that.
Hank is now engaged in making
a motion picture in Hollywood. In
the picture a white ball is used in
order to aid the photography.
Hank has found the ball much to
his liking and will ask the Pacific
Coast Conference to consider the
possibility of using a bleached ball
to make the action easier to fol
low by both spectators and players.
