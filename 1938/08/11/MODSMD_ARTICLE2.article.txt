# Kistiakowsky Talks

Speaking at the morning session
of the conference, G. B. Kistia
kowsky of Harvard described the
"intelligent molecule" he has
watched. In one substance, this
molecule appears as a ring of car
bon atoms attached to an oxygen
atom. When light hits the molecule
with sufficient intensity, one carbon
atom splits off to form carbon mon
oxide with the oxygen, while the
remaining six carbon atoms close
up the gap and keep their circular
arrangement.
But in another substance, of al
most identical molecular structure,
the carbon ring has been broken.
When the light hits this "intelli
gent molecule," Professor Kistia
kowsky said, it seems to realize
its slightly different structure, and
instead of forming a carbon circle,
like the other, it divides into two

highly complex, and quite differ
ently arranged hydrocarbon mole
cules.
"Exciton" and "phonon" are two
new words introduced to the sci
entists Tuesday morning by Pro
fessor Edward Teller of George
Washington University. They are
used, he said, to describe what
happens when light hits a solid
body crystal. By studying the ef
fect of light on certain crystals,
phosphorescence can be explained.
