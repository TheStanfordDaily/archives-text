### ART LEVINSON 
(Editor's Note: Today's col

Chaparral and national president
of Hammer and Coffin Society.)
The once famous Stanford Rough
is disappearing from the campus,
and filthy moleskins, cords, and
dungarees, along with the week's
growth of beard, are becoming ex
tinct. No one mourns the passing
of these signs of Stanford's in
fancy, that glamorous pioneering
period when men lived and cook
ed in the "Camp," and all did their
part in the fostering of what was
to become one of the nation's
greatest universities.
But there are other symbols of
the ideals of Stanford's founders
that are falling into discard, and
which are mourned by those who
carry the ideal of democracy. The
sweatshirts and dungarees are go
ing, but there is a steady influx
of chorus boys in ice-cream pants
to replace the Rough who cared
not where his friends came from
so long as they were men. The
ancient jaloppies are not found in
such abundance, and the suave,
sleek Cord turns up its haughty
snout at the battered Lizzie. The
fight between Hall and Row for
prestige and gravy at times reach
es alarming, though laughable
proportions.
But the Stanford Chaparral,
which next fall enters on its 40th
year of proud existence, still re
mains one of the last strongholds
on the campus of rugged individ
ualism with a socialistic outlook.
From meager beginning in 1899,
and its struggle to maintain itself,
it has developed so that now there
is not a single collegiate humor
magazine that can approach it for
organization, balance, composition,
and care in the use of line, half
tone, and color. To be sure, the
art work is often inadequate and
the humor very often pointless, ac
cording to many readers. That I
hope to remedy next year, but
more of that later.
The Chaparral is published by
Hammer and Coffin Society, an
honorary humor society composed
of "wits and good fellows," who,
along with their avowed purpose
of "having a hell of a good time
putting out the magazine," are
guided by the following principles:
1. Exercise a sense of common
decency and good taste in regard

to material printed in the maga
zine.
2. Maintain an intelligent, in
formed, critical attitude toward the
campus in particular, and the foi
bles of mankind in general.
3. Insist on a high standard of
quality in the magazine.
4. Oppose previous or direct
censorship, trying rather to evi
dence intelligent self-restraint.
5. Maintain an honest policy
with regard to other magazines,
granting all reasonable requests,
and giving full and accurate credit
for all borrowed material or ideas.
6. Support all college magazines
against unreasonable demands of
advertisers and agencies which
limit or conflict with editoral pol
icy.
Hammer and Coffin gives not a
faint damn for economic wealth or
social prestige. All men or women
who rise to salaried and executive
positions on Chaparral do so only
by conclusively demonstrating to
their associates that they possess
every qualification necessary for
the job. And it makes no differ
ence whether their ancestors came
over on the Mayflower or stowed
away on a migrating seagull.
Moreover, the well-publicized
Hall-Row tension does not hold

While naturally the members of a
candidate's own house vote for him
as a matter of course, there are
many instances where a non-fra
ternity man has won by landslide
from a fraternity opponent, be
cause Hammer and Coffin was
convinced that he deserved the
position he was competing for.
For forty years those who have
worked for Chaparral have gath
ered two or three times a year to
sing the old songs, roar out the old
toasts, and rejoice in the growth
and development of a living soci
ety of men. And they take great
pride in the fact that Hammer and
Coffin, which was founded at
Stanford University on April 17,
1906, beating the great earthquake
by several hours, is spreading over
the country, carrying with its
standards the name of Stanford.

Hammer and Coffin gives not a

who rise to salaried and executive
positions on Chaparral do so only
by conclusively demonstrating to
their associates that they possess
every qualification necessary for
the job. And it makes no differ
ence whether their ancestors came
over on the Mayflower or stowed
away on a migrating seagull.
Moreover, the well-publicized
Hall-Row tension does not hold

While naturally the members of a
candidate's own house vote for him
as a matter of course, there are
many instances where a non-fra
ternity man has won by landslide
from a fraternity opponent, be
cause Hammer and Coffin was
convinced that he deserved the
position he was competing for.
For forty years those who have
worked for Chaparral have gath
ered two or three times a year to
sing the old songs, roar out the old
toasts, and rejoice in the growth
and development of a living soci
ety of men. And they take great
pride in the fact that Hammer and
Coffin, which was founded at
Stanford University on April 17,
1906, beating the great earthquake
by several hours, is spreading over
the country, carrying with its
standards the name of Stanford.

The once famous Stanford Rough
is disappearing from the campus,
and filthy moleskins, cords, and
dungarees, along with the week's
growth of beard, are becoming ex
tinct. No one mourns the passing
of these signs of Stanford's in
fancy, that glamorous pioneering
period when men lived and cook
ed in the "Camp," and all did their
part in the fostering of what was
to become one of the nation's
greatest universities.
But there are other symbols of
the ideals of Stanford's founders
that are falling into discard, and
which are mourned by those who
carry the ideal of democracy. The
sweatshirts and dungarees are go
ing, but there is a steady influx
of chorus boys in ice-cream pants
to replace the Rough who cared
not where his friends came from
so long as they were men. The
ancient jaloppies are not found in
such abundance, and the suave,
sleek Cord turns up its haughty
snout at the battered Lizzie. The
fight between Hall and Row for
prestige and gravy at times reach
es alarming, though laughable
proportions.
But the Stanford Chaparral,
which next fall enters on its 40th
year of proud existence, still re
mains one of the last strongholds
on the campus of rugged individ
ualism with a socialistic outlook.
From meager beginning in 1899,
and its struggle to maintain itself,
it has developed so that now there
is not a single collegiate humor
magazine that can approach it for
organization, balance, composition,
and care in the use of line, half
tone, and color. To be sure, the
art work is often inadequate and
the humor very often pointless, ac
cording to many readers. That I
