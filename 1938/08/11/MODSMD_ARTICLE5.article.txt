## Roth Quartet 
### RUTH ALEXANDER 
With the "hour of French mu
sic" yesterday afternoon, Stanford
bids farewell to the Roth Quartet
for another season.
A marvelous effective Ravel for
seven instruments, executed by
masters, was the concluding num
ber of the program in which the
quartet was assisted by Marcel
Grandjany, harpist, Frank Fragale,
clarinetist, and Carleton Sprague
Smith, flutist.
More popular in appeal than the
usual string quartets were the
shorter quartettos, the concerto
and sonata. Three centuries were
represented by the composers
which added another note of con
trast to an intriguing program. But,
of course, I am prejudiced for any
concert which includes both De
bussy and Ravel.
Would that Marcef Grandjany
might present a solo concert on
the campus! He has recently com
pleted a successful season at Mills
College. Last evening we were fa
vored with his final appearance be
fore he leaves to play in the East.
Enhanced by the picturesque
setting of Stanford Union Court,
the second Mozart serenade left
the Tuesday evening audience
wishing that the program might
have been longer.
Although rather unfamiliar in
title, the individual movements of
the two Mozart selections were
readily identified. The "night mu
sic" and the concerto served as in
teresting contrasts. It is rare that
a horn is used as a solo instrument
and, unintentional, of course, was
the harmonious blending of the
whistle from the 8:40 south-bound
train.
As the nearly full moon added its
glow to the spotlights, as one star
poised at the tip of a tree, and as
we caught the spirit of the Span
ish-mission, vine-covered Union
background, we were indeed
grateful to Mrs. Coolidge and the
Friends of Music for another suc
cessful summer concert series.
