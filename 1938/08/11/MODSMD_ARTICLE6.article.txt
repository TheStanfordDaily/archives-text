						Water Polo Prediction
## 
### NORTON THORNTON 
(Editors' Note —Norton Thorn
ton, head coach of the Stanford
varsity swimming and water
polo teams, makes a forecast by
way of Tom Newell.)
The history of 25 years of water
polo at Stanford is a glorious one.
For 22 years. Cardinal teams held
the championship of the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Conference,
went 19 years without losing a
single intercollegiate contest, and
kept their arch-rivals, the Univer
sity of California, on the short end
of the score for 22 years. Until
1936, Stanford water polo teams had
dropped only seven games in col
legiate competition.
In 1937 the boom fell. Out of 12

conference games the Stanfordites
lost seven—just as many as had
been dropped in 24 long years of
collegiate competition. Not as bad
as it sounds, the 1937 season found
the varsity with only two veter
ans; inexperience spelled the dif
ference between defeat and victory
in almost every game. Despite the
fact that we finished the season
in a tie for the cellar spot, the
real strength of the team is shown
by the terrific battle which it gave
the co-champs, U.C.L.A., in a game
which, after several over-time pe
riods, ended in a 5-3 victory for
the Southerners.
For 1938 the story should be
somewhat different. Last year's

boys are vets now, and the varsity
possesses a real "spirit to win."'
Right now, we have high hopes of
winning the Coast pennant. The
team ought to line up something
like this:
Right forward, Captain John Lamb
Left forward. Jack Loupe
Center forward, Harv Rothschild
or Bob Plate
Center back, Bob Plate or Harv
Rothschild
Right guard, Dick Hoover
Left guard, Ted Moreno, Bruce
Jessup, or Bill Hatch
Goalie, Roy Vitousek or Lloyd
Wilson
Captain Johnny Lamb, for two
