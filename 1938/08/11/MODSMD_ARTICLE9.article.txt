Jack Gillis, in the part of Dan
Murray, a soldier of fortune, an ar
rogant, compelling, quixotic Irish
man, plays opposite Dorothy Lev
erenz, who is the proud, imperious,
though intensely feminine daugh
ter of a once powerful and aristo
cratic Spanish house.
Her drunken and ineffectual
young brother will be played by
Bud Cady. Janet Dole will appear
as a song and dance actress, Miss
Melody O'Hara, "the Irish Mock
ing Bird," who entertains the
habitues of the Hotel Plaza.
Melody's costume in the play is
a forerunner of the can-can dance
costume. All the skirts foreshad
ow the bustle, since the period'
of the play is that which took placc
between the time the hoop and
the bustle were in style.
Helen Green and her assistants
will make all of the women's cos
tumes and those of Dan Murray,
who will wear the loud plaid shirts
of the era. They are also creating
new hats for the play and a man
tilla frame because combs would
not stay in a modern hairdress.
Mrs. Green's assistants include
Alice Hind, Ruth Cannon, Ruth
Lucas, Natalie Bergman, and Edna
Hatland. The costume plates, now
in the Art Gallery, may be seen
in the foyer of Memorial Hall dur
ing performances.
