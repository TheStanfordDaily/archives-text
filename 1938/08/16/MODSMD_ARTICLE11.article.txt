An entourage of San Juan
Bautista residents is expected to
attend Saturday evening's per
formance of "Gringo's Gamble"
paying tribute to Author Felton
Elkins whose play centers about
their locale.
Nini Tobin, San Francisco Jun
ior Leaguer, has been seen about
the theater recently, and has the
distinction of being the only per
son to whom Mr. Elkins has issued
a personal invitation to attend
Wednesday evening's dress re
hearsal. His reason being, ac
cording to the author, that Miss
Tobin shows definite dramatic
potentialities.
The higher priced seats for the
World Premiere of "Gringo's
Gamble," which is Thursday eve
ning, have all been sold, accord
ing to Mr. Barker, and present in
dications point toward probable
sell-outs for all three evenings. A
word to the wise should be suffi
cient. Tickets may be had by call
ing Mr. Barker at 22041 or at his
office, m 202.
Sets and costumes for the play
promise to be the most elaborate
a Stanford audience has yet wit
nessed. The jack-knife sets are
rapidly nearing completion under
the sleepless eyes of Mr. Johansen
and Bill Basset plus their loyal
staff of assistants —equally tired, I
am sure. Helen Green's sewing
circle meets daily and Sundays,
night and day, turning out cos
tumes and "creating." Here's to all
of them, without whom actors and
directors would be useless, and
reporters news-less.

"Alien Corn," written as a star
ring vehicle for Katherine Cornell,
will be the next dramatic produc
tion staged by the Federal Theater
in its San Francisco Alcazar. The
play opens Monday, August 22, for
a two weeks' run, and will be di
rected by Beverley Wright, bril
liant young director formerly asso
icated with Max Reinhart in his
Berlin and Vienna theaters.
Bud Cady at the accordian, Har
rison Stephens at the guitar, and
Shirley Jones, vocalist, is the line
up as it now stands for my favo
rite Green Room swing session
between the scenes during re
hearsals of "Gringo's Gamble." »

dications point toward probable
sell-outs for all three evenings. A
word to the wise should be suffi
cient. Tickets may be had by call
ing Mr. Barker at 22041 or at his
office, m 202.
Sets and costumes for the play
promise to be the most elaborate
a Stanford audience has yet wit
nessed. The jack-knife sets are
rapidly nearing completion under
the sleepless eyes of Mr. Johansen
and Bill Basset plus their loyal
staff of assistants —equally tired, I
am sure. Helen Green's sewing
circle meets daily and Sundays,
night and day, turning out cos
tumes and "creating." Here's to all
of them, without whom actors and
directors would be useless, and
reporters news-less.

"Alien Corn," written as a star
ring vehicle for Katherine Cornell,
will be the next dramatic produc
tion staged by the Federal Theater
in its San Francisco Alcazar. The
play opens Monday, August 22, for
a two weeks' run, and will be di
rected by Beverley Wright, bril
liant young director formerly asso
icated with Max Reinhart in his
Berlin and Vienna theaters.
Bud Cady at the accordian, Har
rison Stephens at the guitar, and
Shirley Jones, vocalist, is the line
up as it now stands for my favo
rite Green Room swing session
between the scenes during re
hearsals of "Gringo's Gamble." »
