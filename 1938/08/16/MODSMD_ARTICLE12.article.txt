# LaPiere's Book Out
## 
### 
LaPiere does it again! Dr. Rich
ard Tracy LaPiere, associate pro
fessor of economics at Stanford on
leave at Michigan for a year, has
just published a book entitled
"Collective Behavior" which de
velops the subject from a defini
tion of the various types of be
havior through an analysis of their
origins, functions, participants, and
ideologies — the reasons given by
the participants for their actions.
The behavior of one person af
fects, and is affected by the be
havior of the others around him.
It is impossible for people to be
together without this. The influ
ence people have on each other is
known as collective behavior. Dr.
LaPiere classified these behaviors
in several ways: institutional, con
ventional, regimental, and formal
marriage, funerals, and military or
ganizations and conduct, etc.; con
genial, such as recreational; audi
ence; exchange (economics); po
litic; and nimothetic, or behavior
in relation to the law. He listed
panic, revelous, fanatical, and re
bellious actions as escape behav
iorisms. He explained revelous as
harvest festivals, New Year's cele

brations, primitive peoples' orgias
tic dances, and conventions such
as the American Legion blow
offs; in short, anything to help dis
charge tensions created by every
day living. He also points out that
there may be discrepancies be
tween the ideologies and facts for
any given behavior pattern.
Dr. LaPiere criticizes the stand
ard excuses for capitalism and be
lieves practical politicians still go
by the slogan, "Bought votes are
the only sure votes." He does not
feel that Fascism and Communism,
which he thinks have many points
in common, are the answers.
Dr. LaPiere received a very
comprehensive write-up of his book
in Time, which thought quite high
ly of his work.
