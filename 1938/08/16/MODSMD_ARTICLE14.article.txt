When Coach Tiny Thornhill
starts sending letters to his
"laughing boys" and repeats sev
eral times in the letter that he
wants to beat Santa Clara, you can
be sure that he looks on the Santa
Clara game not as a warm-up and
a proving ground but that he is
really laying for our southern
neighbors.
It seems that in the past the
Stanford contingent couldn't get
into condition fast enough to meet
a thoroughly conditioned Santa
Clara team which had been prac
ticing for a month or more.
But one need only to see a few
members of this year's team to
realize that these boys are really
in fine fettle. Tony Calvelli and
Jack Clarke, center and right end,
respectively, work out every after
noon in the stadium. There's no
admisison. Go down and see for
yourself if they aren't in the best
of shape.
Those two up-and-coming soph
omores, Norm Standlee and
"Swede" Johannessen have been
working for Standard Oil and for
every pound of fat you can find on
these two boys I'll give you a dol
lar.
Big Hamp Pool, a mere slip of a
lad at 215 pounds, works out daily
at the golf course, but not by chas
ing golf balls. They have him do
ing heavy work that three men
usually do. Consequently, "the
fastest man on the squad" is really
rounding into shape for that right
half spot.
Pete Zagar is in Europe with an
American track team. Word has it
that Pete has put on around 20
pounds eating that rich foreign
food. However, Pete could well
carry more weight. This means he
would weigh around 230, which
would raise the average of the line
from tackle to tackle to about 220
pounds.
From the looks of things right

now the two starting ends will be
Jack Clarke and Bill McElroy,
with Bill Willard and Andy Stoj
kovich standing in. The tackles
this year will play the guard posi
tions as well. And what a flock
of good tackles Tiny has. Big Stan
Anderson, who was a standout last
year, Pete Zagar, By West, "Corky"
Donahue, and "Swede" Johannes
sen all go to make a first-class
front line.
Dick Sutton and Bob Dakan will
be back to play the guards, but
with this tackle shift and with the
addition of new members to the
squad in the persons of Chick
Orme and Roy Adamson, these
two boys will have tcr do some tall
playing to stay in there.
At center will be Tony Calvelli,
my choice for the best pivot man
on the coast. The battle for sec
ond spot will be among Chet Pat
ton, Jake Thompson, and Wally
DeWitt.
The probable starting line-up in
the backfield will find Pete Fay
for speed, Bill Paulman for passing
and kicking, Hamp Pool for block
ing, and Sophomore Norm Stand
lee for line plunging. Then, too,
there is a host of very first class
backfield men, including Jim
Groves (who I understand was
hurt this summer), Gene Cold
iron, Bill Kirsch, A1 Alustiza, Glen
Hamilton, Thor Peterson, and Fred
Ledeboer.
Let's hope the boys don't get too
elated over such writings as this
and go out and prove Jimmy Phe
lan's statement that Stanford is the
team to beat this year.

omores, Norm Standlee and
"Swede" Johannessen have been
working for Standard Oil and for
every pound of fat you can find on
these two boys I'll give you a dol
lar.
Big Hamp Pool, a mere slip of a
lad at 215 pounds, works out daily
at the golf course, but not by chas
ing golf balls. They have him do
ing heavy work that three men
usually do. Consequently, "the
fastest man on the squad" is really
rounding into shape for that right
half spot.
Pete Zagar is in Europe with an
American track team. Word has it
that Pete has put on around 20
pounds eating that rich foreign
food. However, Pete could well
carry more weight. This means he
would weigh around 230, which
would raise the average of the line
from tackle to tackle to about 220
pounds.
From the looks of things right

now the two starting ends will be
Jack Clarke and Bill McElroy,
with Bill Willard and Andy Stoj
kovich standing in. The tackles
this year will play the guard posi
tions as well. And what a flock
of good tackles Tiny has. Big Stan
Anderson, who was a standout last
year, Pete Zagar, By West, "Corky"
Donahue, and "Swede" Johannes
sen all go to make a first-class
front line.
Dick Sutton and Bob Dakan will
be back to play the guards, but
with this tackle shift and with the
addition of new members to the
squad in the persons of Chick
Orme and Roy Adamson, these
two boys will have tcr do some tall
playing to stay in there.
At center will be Tony Calvelli,
my choice for the best pivot man
on the coast. The battle for sec
ond spot will be among Chet Pat
ton, Jake Thompson, and Wally
DeWitt.
The probable starting line-up in
the backfield will find Pete Fay
for speed, Bill Paulman for passing
and kicking, Hamp Pool for block
ing, and Sophomore Norm Stand
lee for line plunging. Then, too,
there is a host of very first class
backfield men, including Jim
Groves (who I understand was
hurt this summer), Gene Cold
iron, Bill Kirsch, A1 Alustiza, Glen
Hamilton, Thor Peterson, and Fred
Ledeboer.
Let's hope the boys don't get too
elated over such writings as this
and go out and prove Jimmy Phe
lan's statement that Stanford is the
team to beat this year.
When Coach Tiny Thornhill
starts sending letters to his
"laughing boys" and repeats sev
eral times in the letter that he
wants to beat Santa Clara, you can
be sure that he looks on the Santa
Clara game not as a warm-up and
a proving ground but that he is
really laying for our southern
neighbors.
It seems that in the past the
Stanford contingent couldn't get
into condition fast enough to meet
a thoroughly conditioned Santa
Clara team which had been prac
ticing for a month or more.
But one need only to see a few
members of this year's team to
realize that these boys are really
in fine fettle. Tony Calvelli and
Jack Clarke, center and right end,
respectively, work out every after
noon in the stadium. There's no
admisison. Go down and see for
yourself if they aren't in the best
of shape.

omores, Norm Standlee and
