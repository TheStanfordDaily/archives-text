Jack Downey assumed the role
of champion tennis player of the
summer session when he defeated
Rudolph Blum in the University
tournament, 5-7, 8-6, 7-5.
Sad indeed was the lot of "I'm a
cinch to win" Ed Proctor, for he
went down to a staggering defeat

at the hands of Blum. But not
once did his brave heart fail him
as he lost point after point, etc. All
he was able to say after the match
was, "I was robbed."
