# Baby Chicks Crow
## 
### 
Tough, he-men chicks are crow
ing when only ten days old in the
psychology laboratory on this
campus. Veritable vest-pocket
editions of barn-yard roosters, the
birds utter squeaky but unmistak
able crows, throw back their heads
and strut, possess pugnacious traits
and will peck lustily at your finger.
Rhode Island Reds, declare the
poultrymen, rarely even attempt to
crow before reaching the age of
six or eight weeks. This precoc
ious behavior of the Stanford
roosters was induced by treatment
with a recently available artificial
preparation of testicular sex hor
mone. Dr. Calvin P. Stone, Stan
ford psychologist, is conducting the
experiment. •
It has been suggested that most
people would appreciate it if Dr.
Stone could stop roosters from
crowing instead of stimulating this

sleep-disturbing activity. But
what science may learn from its
experiments with the hormone
bearing drugs may be of far more
service to society than the elim
ination of noisy cock-ci'owing.
