## Somersaults in Art Education 
### PEDRO de LEMOS 
(Mr. deLemos is director of the
Stanford Museum and editor of
"School Arts.")
In all the evolution taking place
in methods of education there have
been many changes proposed and
experimented with in fine and ap
plied arts. This subject, the last
of those admitted to the curricu
lum family, and long questioned
as to its legitimacy, has been often
barred, termed a "frill" and a fad,
and the first subject dropped when
tax funds are meager.
In recent years, however, it is a
subject that has come to the front
and has been pounced upon by
psychologists and educators and
analyzed very carefully as to
whether it is merely cultural really
necessary in our schools. This
often has been left to the prin
cipal or superintendent to deter
mine and usually is decided ac
cording to their own contacts and
opinions of art. Meanwhile
teachers of art everywhere have to
turn somersaults with the new
changes of interest in art educa
tion.
Those who have been advised to
prepare their instruction, follow
ing the theory of "correlation" of
art with 11 other subjects, have
found that the next year necessi
tated another summer school of
"integration," or a tieing up of
their art instruction with the stu
dents' everyday activities.
Now art teachers are finding
that another season has put them
out of date for the new theory is
"fusing" of their subject, one of
making art study an inseparable
subject with history, geography,
science and other subjects as well
as using art to illustrate only
personal experiences and to avoid
picturing any subject not actually
contacted by the pupil.
In the early days of art educa
tion, the pupil was rigidly directed,
actually being told when to draw
from dot to dot. The "pendulum
of time" gradually swung away
from dictation by the teacher un
til now it has reached the other
extreme where the pupil is en
couraged to depict anything he
wants in any way he chooses.
This free expression or "creative
art" urged has become focused re
cently on murals and has resulted
in many acres of scrambled and
inferior wall decorations. Educa
tors marvel at the wonderful art
results secured by Cizech and oth
ers in Europe but fail to introduce
the preparatory instruction in
American schools that precedes
such good results in Europe. Now
that pupils are tiring of the free
dom of creative art, another somer
sault is due.
A teacher recently reported that
an eight-year-old spokesman for
his class asked, "Teacher, do we
have to do anything we want to
day?" Thus the tide is turning,
with our hope that the term to
succeed "fusion" will not be "con
fusion."
Many art educators believe that

art education should function very
closely with vocational trends and
be combined fully with every
phase of training young people.
The Educational Policies Commis
sion in its recent book states,
"There is no good reason why
vocational education should be
separated from general education.
The separation of the vocational
school from the ordinary type of
secondary school is unfortunate.
Regulation and statutes must be
modified to bring about their con
solidation."
England as a nation is realizing
the importance of practical applied
art in its schools if its industrial
markets are to be retained and is
fostering in many ways more vo
cational art in its educational
program. Toward promoting in
dustrial art, the Duke of Con
naught, through the Royal Soci
ety of Arts, recently awarded more
than a score of special titles to
English artists for their achieve
ment in the advertising and indus
trial arts.
When America realizes that art
can be a living art only through
being looked at afar by 90 per
cent of its people will there be
created a healthy American art.
At present in many of our col
leges art education is largely a
platform art course, one where the
student is told how and why art
ists painted, without doing any of
the actual art work. Such a course
can only be a veneer, for art to be
learned must be experienced and
practiced. There is no other way
that it can be learned anymore
than surgery or engineering can
be acquired by only reading its
history or various theories.

In all the evolution taking place
in methods of education there have
been many changes proposed and
experimented with in fine and ap
plied arts. This subject, the last
of those admitted to the curricu
lum family, and long questioned
as to its legitimacy, has been often
barred, termed a "frill" and a fad,
and the first subject dropped when
tax funds are meager.
In recent years, however, it is a
subject that has come to the front
and has been pounced upon by
psychologists and educators and
analyzed very carefully as to
whether it is merely cultural really
necessary in our schools. This
often has been left to the prin
cipal or superintendent to deter
mine and usually is decided ac
cording to their own contacts and
opinions of art. Meanwhile
teachers of art everywhere have to
turn somersaults with the new
changes of interest in art educa
tion.
Those who have been advised to
prepare their instruction, follow
ing the theory of "correlation" of
art with 11 other subjects, have
found that the next year necessi
tated another summer school of
"integration," or a tieing up of
their art instruction with the stu
dents' everyday activities.
Now art teachers are finding
that another season has put them
out of date for the new theory is
"fusing" of their subject, one of
making art study an inseparable
subject with history, geography,
science and other subjects as well
as using art to illustrate only
personal experiences and to avoid
picturing any subject not actually
contacted by the pupil.
In the early days of art educa
tion, the pupil was rigidly directed,
actually being told when to draw
from dot to dot. The "pendulum
of time" gradually swung away
from dictation by the teacher un

extreme where the pupil is en
couraged to depict anything he
wants in any way he chooses.
This free expression or "creative
art" urged has become focused re

in many acres of scrambled and
inferior wall decorations. Educa
