## 
### 
Three members of the Stanford
faculty, Dr. Reginald Bell, Dr. Al
vin C. Eurich, and Daniel Men

delowitz, will co-operate with the
Santa Barbara city schools in one
of four motion picture projects
sponsored by the American Coun
cil on Education.
A two- to three-year grant has
been given the Santa Barbara
school system to study the use of
films in junior and senior high
schools. Francis Noel, local direc
tor of the project, and Dr. Floyd
Brooker, associate director of the
four projects for the American
Council, were on the campus re
cently consulting with the Stanford
advisers.
Dr. Bell, Dr. Eurich, Mende
lowitz, and Noel will attend a na
tional conference on the projects
at the University of Minnesota
from August 25 to 31. They will
be accompanied by Curtis Warren,
superintendent of Santa Barbara
schools; Mrs. Lillian Lamoreau,
director of curriculum; and Ed
ward Krug, evaluator for the
project.
The other projects will be con
ducted at the general college of
the University of Minnesota, at
Tower Hill in Pennsylvania and at
Denver. The Minnesota study will
stress the use of motion pictures in
college education, while the pri
vate school in Pennsylvania will
consider the program in the ele
mentary school. The Denver proj
ect will attempt to determine what
happens when a group of children
set out to make a film.
