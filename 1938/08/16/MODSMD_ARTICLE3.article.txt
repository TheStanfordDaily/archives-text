# NBC Wants Play
## 
### 
In a telegram received yesterday
by Dr. Margery Bailey, director of
the Dramatists' Assembly, the Na
tional Broadcasting Company, said
that they want to have the Max
well Anderson prize play for pre
sentation on the air.
The prize play reading, "John
Brown," was written by Kirke
Mecham of Topeka, Kansas, who is
secretary of his state historical as
sociation, a fact which, according
to Miss Bailey, accounts for the
authenticity of the play.
The program surrounding the
play contest began last night with
the reading of the plays which
were banned for radio broadcast
last week because they dealt with
controversial subjects.
This program will continue next
week with play readings and con
ferences beginning with "Strange
Futurity" by Grace Duncan Hoop
er and ending with the prize play.
There were 157 plays submitted
in the Maxwell Anderson play
writing contest this year and the
greatest number were from New
York which had 39 and California
was second with 23. This reversed
the rating of former years.
There were 95 tragedies, 41
comedies and romances, and 21
plays on allegory, morality, and
miracles.
