# A. J. Guerard Speaks

### 
Pleading the causes of Robert
Bridges as a closet dramatist, Al
bert J. Guerard appeared on the
Dramatists program last Thursday
evening to give what is termed "an
academic talk to an academic au
dience."
"Closet drama," he defined, "is
drama that ignores contemporary
stage conventions. It is literature
rather than 'good theater'."
Mr. Guerard believes that the
literary dramatists of the 19th cen

tury have been overmuch abused.
"They are criticized mainly for
their imitation of the obsolete dra
matic convention, Elizabethan
tragedy."
Concluding the evening's pro
gram was a reading of "The Only
Jealousy of Emer," by William
Butler Yeats, a great contempo
rary poet, who found much to
praise in works of Robert Bridges.
Those who read were Miss Elisa
beth Buckingham, professor of
speech and drama; Dr. Margery
Bailey, Miss Myna Hughes, and
George Z. Wilson.
