# Roble Cheers Over New Admission Requirements
## FROSH ELATED 
### 
Dean Mary Yost last night
tossed a verbal bombshell into
the Union dining room. In the
middle of the ros' bif-linia beans
entree, she announced that all
girls receiving a C average or
over will be admitted for fail
quarter enrollment. The remain
der of the menu might have
consisted of sawdust and burnt
cork for all the semi-hysterical
Robleites cared. The Daily
learned that the run on down
town restaurants last night was
the result of a mass-return of
appetites temporarily stymied by
the announcement.
