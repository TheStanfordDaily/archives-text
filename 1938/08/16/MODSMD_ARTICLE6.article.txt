# Banned Plays Read

### 
Three short radio plays, which
were contributed to the contest for
the Maxwell Anderson award, and
which were banned by both Co
lumbia and National Broadcasting
Systems, were read last night in
the Women's Clubhouse. The
readers spoke their lines behind a
screen to achieve the effect of a
radio performance; music and
sound effects and even a super
fluous staccato dimming of the
lights were used to further the il
lusion.
The first play, "Camaradas," a
drama of the Spanish war by Nor
man Evanson, attempted natural
istic recreation of trench fighting.
It depended upon noises as well as
voices to make the attack upon the
nerves which the subject demands,
and a variation between violence
and tenderness for the upward
swing of suspense. Suspense, how
ever, was wanting, and the blank
verse had neither the force nor
mastery of technique to make the
slight conversation between three
men in a Spanish trench effective.
"The Last One" by Bessie Col
lins was a symbolic miracle-play,
which by voices alone attempted to
build a sense of the eerily appal
ling, suggesting rather than de
scribing. The verse here was of
slightly better quality than the
first, but still there remained a
too obvious striving for dramatic
effects through words.
The third, "The Apple," by Gil
bert Highet, met more successfully
the requirements of a radio play, or
any play, since full-blown dialogue
and dramatic situation were com
bined.
The readers were George Z. Wil
son, Don Brown, James Sandoe,
Harry Jones, Myna Hughes, and
Sydney Head. —K. P.
