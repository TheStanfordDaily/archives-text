"The vast majority of key posi

and state scientific investigations
of our food fish are filled by men
either trained at Stanford or by
Stanford graduates," said George
S. Myers, professor of biology, over
radio station KGO last evening.
Dr. Myers, who is curator of zo
ological collections at the Stanford
