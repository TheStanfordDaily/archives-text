"American Influence on French
Culture" will be discussed by Dr.
Albert L. Guerard, professor of
general literature, tonight at 8
o'clock in the auditorium of the
Memorial Hall.
Dr. Guerard will trace briefly the
literary influence emphasizing the

important role played by Edgar
Allen Poe and Walt Whitman. He
will also direct attention to some
present-day American writers liv
ing in France who are writing in
the French language but who ac
tually belong to the American
school.
The effects of our present-day
civilization on France is a wide
field which Dr. Guerard is ex
pected to cover in more detail at
some future time. This lecture,
however, will give a general idea
of the intellectual relationship
now established between the two
sister republics.
