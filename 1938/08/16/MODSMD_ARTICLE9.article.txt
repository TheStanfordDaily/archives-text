## Medical Social Work 
### 
Continuing the morning semi
nars of the Western Institute for
Hospital Administrators, Margue
rite Spiers, director of social serv
ice of Alameda County institu
tions. spoke yesterday upon "Med
ical Social Service."
"The social service worker is
present in the hospital to help the
patient to get the best benefit pos
sible from hospital service. By re
moving the causes of worry due to
family problems, finances, and

lack of opportunity for continued
care after discharge from the hos
pital, the social worker may do as
much for the peace of mind of the
patient as the nurse."
Natalie Van Cleve, executive
dietitian of the Alameda County
Hospital, shared the morning pe
riod with Miss Spiers. "Patients
in hospitals," she stressed, "are not
interested in large scale methods
and in the organization and man
agement of hospitals, but in per
sonal service and comfort. They
judge hospital service 'by tasty
food tastily served'."
