# 'Gringo's Gamble' World Premiere Set for Tonight
## THE 						THEATER Bailey Lauds Play 
### 
"The force of the play makes the
ancient story of Dido and Aeneas
compelling to our own experience,"
said Dr. Margery Bailey in speak
ing of "Strange Futurity," which
will be read in the Little Theater
Monday night at 8 o'clock.
The play, which was awarded
distinguished second honors in the
Maxwell Anderson verse drama
contest, was written by Grace
Duncan Hooper of New York. The
author is a graduate of the Co
lumbia University School of Jour
nalism and has had a great deal of
experience in stage managing and
publicity. "Strange Futurity" is
her first play.
Miss Bailey feels that this play
contains the same clash of charac
ter and vast implications which
accounted for the success of Max
well Anderson's "Elizabeth the
Queen." There is. national signifi
cance in the struggle between
Dido, who represents the power of
Carthage and Aeneas, who is to
found a New Troy in Italy.
They represent the universal
problem of friction between the
ambition of a man of action and a
vital woman's possessive love.
Lucie Bentley, who appeared in
the prize play reading last year and
also in the title role of "Electra"
this summer quarter, will be Dido.
Louis Scales, who recently played
Mercutio in the Johnston Players'
"Romeo and Juliet," will be
Aeneas.
Jim Stone will play the part of
Hanno, a vigorous, ironic figure
through whose expressions the au
dience follows much of the play.
Other characters will include
Mathew Evans as larbus, the
Libyan chieftain, and Miriam Rein
hart as Anna, Dido's sister.
Harry Jones, Albert Blumberg,
Lee Chapin, and A. Grove Day,
director of "Star Wagon" last win
ter, complete the cast.
"Strange Futurity" is the most
poetic of the three plays to be pre
sented next week according to the
opinion of the contest judges. The
verse is not artificial nor does it
spring from colloquial speech, but
it has a ring of high thinking and
grave responsibility.
Dr. Bailey expects the essential
force of the play to receive its full
due because the readers are expe
rienced and their voices harmo
nize effectively.
Contest judges included Thomas
Wood Stevens, Ransom Rideoirt,
Hugh Gillis, James Sandoe, and
Margaret Storey.
