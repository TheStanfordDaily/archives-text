Johnny Paulson, recipient of the
Stagers' scholarship, may be found
working backstage on the sets for
"Gringo's Gamble" — getting in
shape for next quarter, no doubt.
Helen Green announces that
there will be an exhibit of sketches
of the costume designs used in
"Gringo's Gamble" in the main
foyer of the Memorial Theater after
Thursday evening's premiere.

Felton Elkins is a busy man. In
fact, he is so busy that he had his
San Francisco barber, Pierre, come
down to rehearsal Tuesday evening
to trim his hair. Fortunately for
Mr. Elkins, he didn't have Monday
night's professional make-up artist
work on him. Who got trimmed
that night, I wonder!
* * *
Excerpts from a letter to Felton
Elkins from Eugene O'Neill have
been posted on the bulletin board
at the theater. Mr. O'Neill pleads
claustrophobia as his reason for
not attending the premiere, and
wishes author, director, and cast
the best of luck.

"Approving" would well describe
the look on Director Stevens' face
as he walked into the Green Room

during rehearsals last week and
found Virgil Bergman, Aubrey
Austin, Harriet Teuton, J. P. Cahn,
and a few others busily studying
for exams. He concealed his sur
prise admirably.

Bud Cady at the accordian, Har
rison Stephens at the guitar, and
Shirley Jones, vocalist, is the line
up as it now stands for my favorite
Green Room swing session between
the scenes during rehearsals of
"Gringo's Gamble."
