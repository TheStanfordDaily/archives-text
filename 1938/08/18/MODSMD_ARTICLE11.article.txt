# Poll of Opinion
## 
### TOM NEWELL 
Traditionally, Stanford graduates
are rich, rough, and Republicans.
Actually, as all Stanford people
know, they traditionally fall short
of these traditions. Just how far
short they fall is one of the things
that the Illustrated Review's 1938
Poll of Stanford Opinion is going
to determine.
"What do Stanford graduates
think of the New Deal and do you
want to see the New Deal survive
as against a more conservative
form of government?" are ques
tions that should give an interest
ing picture of the "Old Boys'" at
titude toward F.D.R.
"On the basis of your experience
at Stanford do you favor the co
educational system?" This ques
tion, going hand in hand with, "Are
you planning to educate your son
or daughter at Stanford?" and
"What do you value most as a re
sult of your education at Stan
ford?" will shed some light on the
shifts in attitudes which come
after contact with the "outside
world."
No idle bit of snooping, the Poll
of Stanford Opinion becomes a

thing of real .vital importance
when we consider that the control
of the university is year by year
nestling more snuggly into the palm
of the powerful alumni paw. Just
what are the attitudes and opin
ions of the people who will some
day have a big share in determin
ing the university's future. Also,
something may be learned of what
Stanford has done for the thou
sands of men and women that she
has educated. Having gone to
Stanford, are the "Old Boys"
characteristically liberal or con
servative? What do they think
about big - time intercollegiate
sports? How do they regard uni
versities of the small, privately
endowed type?
The five thousand replies al
ready received indicate that the
interest in the poll is widespread.
Ballots, which were distributed in
the June issue of the Illustrated
Review and through the mails, are
pouring in every day.
Beginning in September with
the results of the first question,
the magazine will publish the out
come of the poll, one question at
a time.
Next year, if the suggestion of
many alumni is followed, the poll
will contain a question relative to
the Stanford sorority-fraternity
problem.
