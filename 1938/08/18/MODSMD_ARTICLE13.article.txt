# The 						Guest Columnist
## 
### DAVE BOTSFORD 
("Bots," who is now on the
editorial staff of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle and was former
ly a Daily columnist, answers
Mr. Batman's recent column.)
August 9 was L. R. Batman's
banner day. It was on that bright
Tuesday morning that he revealed
to a certain select campus group
(those who read the summer
Daily's "guest" column) that a
Daily columnist is not quite the
Pegler he thinks he is.
In surprisingly civilized style,
this lean blond linotyper traced
the metamorphosis of a campus
journalist — how first he is en
tranced by the up-turned lips of
the Woman's Editor, how he sev
eral quarters later fills a daily
'"Bull Session" with chastening
assaults on the 8.A.C., how he fi
nally emerges a beautiful butter
fly (i.e., "a copy-boy on a San
Francisco newspaper.")
He failed, however, to give full
credit to himself and his colleague,
Charlie the make-up man, for this
four-year change in a Stanford
newswriter. As far as he went,
Mr. Batman was more or less cor
rect in assuming that college jour
nalists need a war in Spain or
colossal suicide jump to turn them
into newspapermen. What he for
got to make clear was this: to bat
tle with Charlie over the size of
headline type was as bloody as the
fall of Bilbao—and merely to hand
Batman himself a sheaf of copy was
as nerve-wracking as John Warde's
ten-hour hesitation on the nth
floor ledge of New York's Gotham
Hotel.
Newswriting for the journalism
division is newswriting from a
text-book. There is no strain, no
dead-line, no Franco cannon. Four
years of it and your writing may
be smooth, but your approach to
life's realities may be amazingly
naive.
But four years with Charlie and
Bat will make a Gibbons or a
Webb Miller out of any half-baked
Daily reporter. Take what Bat
himself says: "One of his (Bat's
reporters) most important activi
ties is to avoid bodily harm at the
hands of the back-shop employ
ees." A United Press correspond
ent on the Loyalist front faces the
same hazards, and — if he comes
through at all — can claim the
same wounds of honor as those
prized by a graduating Daily jour
nalist.
San Francisco managing editors
might well grumble at college
graduates demanding jobs: "We
employ only experienced news
papermen here. If you haven't
personally interviewed Musso
lini at Fascist sword-point, or
been caught snatching Stalin's se
crets for Walter Duranty, or tried
to tell Charlie Wegner where to
place a two-column story in the
Stanford Daily, you might as well
get out."

I got a copy-boy's job in the City
not because I could write a news
story with a what-where-why
when-which lead. I got my job
because I had once learned about
longshoremen and Chinese tongs
and New Mexico penitentes — at
least how they act toward news
papermen—from Charlie and Bat.
I'm sure that all former Daily
ites—wherever they may be, what
ever news they may at the moment
be uncovering for the world's
great press networks—will write a
chapter in their "Personal Histo
ries" on these two metamorphiz
ers.
And another thing we learned
from Charlie and Bat. Just this:
Even the toughest news barriers in
the world can be broken down if
you know how. The "how" of
breaking down Charlie and Bat is
perhaps the most important heri
tage one Daily generation passes
down to the next. It's something,
however, that is never passed
down immediately. We have all
realized the maturing effect of
these two back-shop men and the
tragedy of spoiling that effect for
our successors. We don't, there
fore, give them the key to these
back-shop personalities until
they've almost been broken (I
should really say "strengthened")
by the experience.
No, I'm not going to tell you the
secret that softens the "hearts"
(that's not the right word, either)
of Charlie and Bat. It is something
that is never written down. The
current Daily crop would lose im
measurably by knowing it now.
I've spent a good deal of space
telling what we have learned from
the back-shop boys. I should not
stop, therefore, without suggesting
that perhaps they — at least Bat —
have learned something from us.
For years he has set into type
what we have written on paper.
During these years he has—if it
was really he who wrote the
Guest Column August 9—picked up
a little something about good
writing.
