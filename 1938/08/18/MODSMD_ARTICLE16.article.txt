As this column did not predict,
the El Toros came through with a
decided victory over the Outlaws
in the Wheel Chair League play
off game for the top honors of
the summer. The score was 10-2.
On Monday the Outlaws won, as
this column did predict, from "Pa"
Kennedy's Acocrdians, 5-2. It was
mainly due to this game that the
Outlaws were unable to make such
a good showing against the Toros
for their pitcher had to throw not
only against the Accordians but
also against the Toros the next day.
However ,the credit goes to the
Toros for turning out a really first
class softball team which could
handle itself well against any of
the local Palo Alto teams that
claim the best players in these
parts.
