# Golf Championship
## 
### 
Again Stanford's number one
golfer, Art Doering, brought ac
claim to himself and the Farm by
winning the Chicago Amateur
Championship. After hitting
around the top all summer, Art
justly deserved to win his home
town championship.
Eyes will be on Doering in the
National Amateur which starts in
the very near future. In last year's
National he surprised fans by being
low man on the first day out. With
the experience that he has gained
during his matches this summer he
will undoubtedly end up among
the leaders.
