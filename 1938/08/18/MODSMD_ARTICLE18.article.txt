# Grudge Race
## 
### 
As the onlookers yelled encour
agement, Jack Calderwood and
Tony Calvelli staged a grudge race
over a mile course last night with
Jack coming home the winner by a
comfortable margin.
The whole thing started when
Calvelli accused all basketball
players of being only able to run
in circles. Calderwood accepted
the challenge and proceeded to run
circlesâ€”around Tony.
