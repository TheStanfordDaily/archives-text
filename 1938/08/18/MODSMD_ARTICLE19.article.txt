# MINORITY REPORT
## 
### RUTH ALEXANDER 
Once they asked me to do a
guest column when somebody of
importance failed to turn one in at
the last minute. I declined, feeling
that there was no reason why I
should be selected when the cam
pus offered many more illustrious
lights. Besides, I had nothing to
say.
Later my thoughts demanded ex
pression, so here they are —all un
solicited.
Back in high school days, I re
call getting credit for working on
the paper, that is, for the first
semester. After that and all
through college I was on the daily
or weekly staff merely for the fun
or prestige. Really, because, once a
little printer's ink gets into the
blood, one can't keep away from
newspaper offices or print shops.
And here I am back on a college
paper again, and getting credit
for it.
This time it's on the rightly
dubbed "Dippy," a daily which
comes out twice a week. The staff
consists of some 25 students, fel
lows and girls, from freshmen
competing for regular entrance to
seniors carrying more than 20
units so they can be graduated,
and, of course, me—the lone grad
uate student.
I stroll into "the shack" the first
day, after the prof has told us what
it's all about, to be offered the
choice of going to the libe or the
art gallery to find out about ex
hibits. I choose the former — at
least I can find someone to talk
to there if I have to wait for in
formation. Back to the typewriter
to write it up. It gets cut at the
desk — the libe isn't worth that
much with the press of news early
in the quarter. I don't mind. I
understand. I edited a college pa
per for a year when I was a senior.
The quarter passes. They print
my stuff without cutting, let me
write headlines, even help others
to write their stories. They're a
grand bunch of kids, those who
work despite the hot weather and
gather round a table for ham
burgers after "putting the sheet to
bed." It's been fun working with
them.
Most of all, it's been to me what
"college" should mean, to know
such grand people as:
(1) our managing editor — one
girl who really knows this news
paper business, knows "straight
up" about a lot of other things
too.
(2) our linotype operator, turned

make-up man for the summer —
who likes to bark, thinks you're
crazy to start something new, but
enjoys playing with the paper's
make-up as much as you do if you
only treat him as one of the gang.
(3) our smiling prof—who says
to your rash proposal, "Sure, go
ahead. It may take all night to
make up the paper, but try it
out," who doesn't let you down
and who gives the kind of finals
one ilkes to take.
My editorial tributes are ended.
May I conclude this column, this
course, and these four quarters at
Stanford with the customary
—30—
