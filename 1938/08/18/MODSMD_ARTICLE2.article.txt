# Dramatist Assembly
## 
### 
"The examination of plays that
is to be made during The Dram
atists' Assembly will lead toward a
fuller understanding of the prob
lems of dramatic verse," said
Thomas Wood Stevens yesterday
afternoon.
Stevens, director of dramatics at
Stanford, emphasized that al
though he had no official connec
tion with the coming assembly he
would "like to encourage it in
every way possible."
"I do not wish to overemphasize
the importance of the assembly nor
of the competition that has pre
ceded it, but dramatic verse is a
very important part of the Ameri
can theater," he said.

In speaking of "John Brown," the
play that recently won the Max
well Anderson award, Stevens stat
ed that he thought the choice made
by the judges was a correct one.
He pointed out that there was at
least one competing work that was
written in finer verse, but that
it was unsatisfactory as a dramatic
production.
"The winning play strikes a bal
ance of a workable play in fairly
good verse," he declared.
