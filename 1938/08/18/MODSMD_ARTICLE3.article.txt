# Playwright Analyzed

"I think that it would be unfair
ot judge Maxwell Anderson en
tirely upon his early plays such as
'What Price Glory'," said Dr. Henry
David Gray, "because he hadn't
had the time to get over his course
of playwriting that I taught."
Dr. Gray, who is one of the most
famous of Stanford's professors
and a well-known acquaintance of
many of the leading modern dram
atists and actors, feels that he is
well qualified to comment upon
Maxwell Anderson.
"He was a quiet, shy fellow," Dr.
Gray recollects, "and he seemed to
have things inside on his mind that
he didn't say. When he was a stu
dent in the playwriting class, he
didn't seem to be awfully good,
never cut, wore an insipient smile,
was rather casual about his work,
and to my mind, didn't do any
outstanding work."
Maxwell Anderson submitted
some poetry to the English Quar
terly while he was here, and to
Dr. Gray, it is "downright" good
and better than anything he has
done as a dramatist.
"Elizabeth the Queen" is Ander
son's best dramatic work, accord
ing to Dr. Gray. "It is noteworthy
because here Anderson answers
the question, how far can we go
toward magnificent rhetoric with
poetry, and how in this he is like
Shakespeare, who became less rhe
torical in his last period. The play
contains a really masterly charac
terization of Bacon, who is handled
with a combination of dramatic ef
fectiveness and literary value,
which is only found in a first-rate
play.
In comparison with the rest of
the native American dramatists,
Dr. Gray feels that Anderson is
topped only by Eugene O'Neill.
"He gets a real, poetic under
tone in his dramas," explains Dr.
Gray, "without being false to the
harsh realism of the scene depict
ed. It is mighty hard to get this
undertone of poetry in a grim,
slummy, naturalistic drama such
as 'Winterset'."
In conclusion, Dr. Gray declared
that he thought it was Anderson's
ability to evaluate things in their
proper perspective that was the
greatest factor in his success as a
dramatist.
