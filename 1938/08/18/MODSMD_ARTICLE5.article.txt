## Culture Influenced

"American Influence on French
Culture" was the subject of ihe
Tuesday Evening Lecture, given by
Dr. Albert L. Guerard, professor
of general literature, in the Me
morial Hall.
The balance of influence between
France and America," said Dr.
Guerard, "is in favor of America.
In this country we are uncon
scious of French culture, because
its influence is based on resem
blances, while in France, American
influence is based on differences."
"America as an exotic dream"
Dr. Guerard listed first among the
three major fields of American in
fluence in France. This attitude
rises from the French admiration
for Edgar Allen Poe, Walt Whit
man, and from the half-fictitious
descriptions of Chateaubriand.
American movies, and the Ameri
can tourist who seeks New York
in Paris and creates a Hollywood
of Montmartre, contribute further
to this attitude.
Secondly, Dr. Guerard contin
ued, the French people look to
America as an embodiment of "the
democratic ideal." Lafayette and
Tocqueville were important in
struments in the transmission of
influence. But the American who
triumphed in France was Woodrow
Wilson. For the French, he carried
the American ideal of democracy to
its positive conclusion.
America as "a paradise of big
business" is the greatest influence
according to Dr. Guerard. Even
before the American Revolution
there were inklings of our eco
nomic influence in France. If to
day Duhamel, the French writer,
protests against the machine and
American mass production, it is be
cause the French economic struc
ture resembles our own.
"It is France," Dr. Guerard main
tains, "that upholds American ideas
of individual values, that recog
nizes the greatest of American con
tributions to democracy â€” Wilson,
the president on whom America
turned its back. So we can say,"
he concluded, "that France agrees
with us better than we agree with
ourselves."
