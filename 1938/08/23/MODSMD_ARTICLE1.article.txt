## THE 						THEATER PLAY READING 
### 
First sample of the winners in
the Maxwell Anderson Verse
Drama Contest was heard last
night with a reading of "Strange
Futurity" in the Little Theater.
Written by Grace Duncan Hooper
of New York City, this play was
awarded distinguished second hon
ors in the contest, and was read by
members of the Stanford Drama
tists as part of the Dramatists' As
sembly being held this week.
In spite of a dull and occasion
ally even bungling performance by
most of the cast, the excellence of
Miss Hooper's drama forced its
way to the surface. "Strange Fu
turity" is the author's conception
of the famous tale of Dido and
Aeneas. Beginning with Aeneas'
exhausted arrival in Carthage and
ending with Dido's suicide after
his dramatic departure, the play
convincingly portrays the tremen
dous emotional forces that must
have torn at both of them during
those few days of tragic passion.
Naturally blank verse adds an
artificiality that removes the action
of the play one step further from
realism. But in "Strange Futur
ity," the power of Aeneas' duty to
his people matched against his
love for Dido, and her own obliga
tion to her country opposed to her
passion for him is made so gen
uine that it cuts through this veil
into living reality.
The performances of Lucie Bent
ley as Dido, Myna Brunton
Hughes as the crafty old nurse,
and A. Grove Day as Todmelak,
shrewd councillor of Carthage,
were excellent. —H. S.
