Tops among European produc
tions of the past two years is the
French motion picture "La Ker
messe Heroique" (Carnival in
Flanders) which will be featured
at the final program of the Sum
mer Quarter Tuesday Evening Se
ries tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Memorial Theater.
This brilliant farce was heralded
as the best film produced in Eu
rope last year. Even with so
weighty an introduction, it ran for
a record three months in New
York. The picture is set in the
tiny Flemish town of Boom in
1616, shortly after Philip of Spain
had taken Flanders. A story by
Charles Spaak is the basis for the
plot.
At the beginning of the film
Julian, a young painter, learns that
the burgomaster's daughter, Siska,
whom he is to marry has been
promised by her father to the town
butcher. Siska and the painter en
list the sympathy of her mother
and at this moment it is learned
that the dreaded Spanish duke is
approaching the village, and with
his troops intends to spend the
night there. The men of the town
call a hurried meeting and decide
to drape the town in mourning,
pretending that the burgomaster is
dead. This ires the women, led by
Madame Burgomaster, who think
the plan a cowardly one. They re
ceive the duke and his party so
merrily that the Duke grants the
town a year's tax exemption and
has the marriage of Julian and
Siska performed in his presence.
