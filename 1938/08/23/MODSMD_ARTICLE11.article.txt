The Stanford Bookstore has just
received a new book from the pen
of Laura Krey. Mrs. Krey is the
wife of Professor August Charles
Krey, a visiting professor hei'e this
summer. Professor Krey teaches
medieval history at the University
of Minnesota during the regular
year.
The new book, entitled ". . . and
Tell of Time," is a story of the
South. A portion of Mrs. Krey's
preface will give the trend of her
book.
"The men who rode across
Kentucky a century ago are dead
now . . . and the men who
brought their wives and slaves out
of Carolina and Louisiana are
dead too. But thirty-five years ago,
some of them were still living, sit
ting quietly . . . ready to talk and
to die." Mrs. Krey lets these peo
ple talk and as they do the story

grows. The author herself comes
from Texas, locale of most of the
story, and her family lived much
as the characters of her book. It is
a moving stoi*y of Georgia, Vir
ignia, and Texas from the close of
the Civil War till the 'eighties of
the last century.
The Bookstore has a limited
number of copies personally auto
graphed by the author, who is
staying at the Kingscote Gardens
this summer.
