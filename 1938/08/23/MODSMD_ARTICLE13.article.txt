Dr. Harold Hand summarized
this year's Wheelchair League play
as the best of any year so far, in
every respect—interest, co-opera
tion from the University, sports
manship, and a surprising lack of
injuries. There were 12 teams out
this year, a sizeable increase over
previous seasons.
Dr. Hand said their greatest dif
ficulty was in equating the teams.
He found that the older teams had
developed a finer morale than
some of the newer ones; he plans
to counteract this as much as pos
sible by ararnging teams next year
in relation to the areas from which
the men come. There will be a
man in the Ad Building lobby on
registration day to get the men ar
ranged sooner and more equitably.
Pa Kennedy, the Sage of the
Fork, feels that this is the first of
many such fine years.
