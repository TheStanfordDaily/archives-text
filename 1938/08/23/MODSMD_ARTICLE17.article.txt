(Editor's Note: Tired of listen

torial staff, our business manager

virtues of the biz staff.)
"I think that it's wonderful that
you are working on your school
paper. Are you the editor? . . .
Oh, the business manager? . . .
Do you mean you are the manag
ing editor?"
These questions are familiar to a
business manager of The Daily,
for to most people there are only
two positions on a newspaper, that

of editor and managing editor. For
example: a wide-eyed freshman
(for description of said fellow, re
fer to Mr. Batman's column of
August 9) wanders into the busi
ness office and merely says that he
would "like to try out for The
Daily." A zealous member of the
staff rushes to the business man
ager's office, grabs a blue registra
tion card, dashes back to the pros
pect, and quickly has him fill it
out. Then he begins his pep talk
about the romance of selling ads,
writing copy, and doing office work.
The meek freshman tries to inter
rupt him, but the staff member goes
on with his sales talk.
"Doesn't it all sound wonder
ful?" asks the junior officer, after
he has worked himself up to a high
key of excitement, and all the
* See issue of July 28.

while thinking what a super-sales
man he must be.
'"But," apologetically replies the
freshman, "I'm interested in work
ing on the editorial, not the busi
ness staff."
If this were an individual case,
it might be funny; but it's just
one out of a dozen similar expe
riences. It's not true of just The
Daily, but of the Quad and the
Chappie, too.
This situation is not the fault of
the students; it's the fault of the
publications. Ironically enough,
these business departments spend
their time selling advertising,
while they are forgetting to adver
tise themselves. If we could do a
good job of advertising the busi
ness departments, we would be
swamped with tryoutees, for there
is every bit as much "romance"
and fun working on the business
staff of a periodical as there is on
the editorial side, and it is finan
cially more profitable, besides in
troducing the student to a big in
dustry for life work.
What do you do when you are
on the business staff that is so
much fun? You do somewhat the
same kind of work that you would
do on the editorial staff, except
that you are called "practical" in
stead of "temperamental." If you

are a reporter, you would, as ev
eryone knows, interview someone,
and then write up what he said.
If you are on the business staff,
you write an ad for a store, and
then try to sell your "master
piece." So, whether you are on
the edit or "biz" staff, you are
writing and seeing people. But,
you say, people don't want to see
salesmen. How many of you would
like to have a reporter poking his
nose into your private life?
After your first year on the busi
ness staff, when you do odd jobs,
you are promoted, if you have
done your work well. First, you
are an "Account Manager," and
you handle all of the business from
several stores. Next, you are an
"Advertising Manager," and are
placed in charge of one of the fol
lowing territories: North Palo Alto,
South Palo Alto, or San Francisco.
After the end of a year as adver
tising manager, one of the three is
made Business Manager.
When you reach this point, you
are popularly supposed to draw a
big salary and do nothing. In
reality, all of the cares which you
had as advertising manager seem
trivial, for you are placed in the
tough position of trying to make
ends meet. You have to pound on
your assistants for not selling
enough advertising. You have to

give the managing editor Hell for
running up the printing bill so
high. The sports editor won't speak
to you because you refuse to send
him to Columbia with the football
team to cover the game. The edi
tor begins to hate you because you
are always saying "No." You, in
turn, get sick of hearing the stu
dent manager saying "No." When
you go into the back-shop, the
student helper there asks you for
a raise, and Charlie and Bat re
mind you that it will cost you 25
cents to make this or that change
in an ad. You rush back to your
office to seek a little peace, but
you find a woman screaming about

a delivery boy who threw her pa
per in a mud puddle.
Despite the "pains of office,"
each business manager experiences
one of the saddest moments in his
life when he has to appoint some
one to take his place.
Would I rather be the editor
than the business manager? De
spite all the "glamour" attached to
an editor, I'd sooner write copy for
all the ads in The Daily than to
write another column!
Millions of years from now,
North America may be connected
again with Asia and Europe, as it
was at various times in the past.

"I think that it's wonderful that
you are working on your school
paper. Are you the editor? . . .
Oh, the business manager? . . .
Do you mean you are the manag
ing editor?"
These questions are familiar to a
business manager of The Daily,
for to most people there are only
two positions on a newspaper, that

of editor and managing editor. For
example: a wide-eyed freshman
(for description of said fellow, re
fer to Mr. Batman's column of
August 9) wanders into the busi
ness office and merely says that he
would "like to try out for The
Daily." A zealous member of the
staff rushes to the business man
ager's office, grabs a blue registra
tion card, dashes back to the pros
pect, and quickly has him fill it
out. Then he begins his pep talk
about the romance of selling ads,
writing copy, and doing office work.
The meek freshman tries to inter
rupt him, but the staff member goes
on with his sales talk.
"Doesn't it all sound wonder
ful?" asks the junior officer, after
he has worked himself up to a high
key of excitement, and all the
* See issue of July 28.

while thinking what a super-sales
man he must be.
'"But," apologetically replies the
freshman, "I'm interested in work
ing on the editorial, not the busi
ness staff."
If this were an individual case,
it might be funny; but it's just
one out of a dozen similar expe
riences. It's not true of just The
Daily, but of the Quad and the
Chappie, too.
This situation is not the fault of
the students; it's the fault of the
publications. Ironically enough,
these business departments spend
their time selling advertising,
while they are forgetting to adver
tise themselves. If we could do a
good job of advertising the busi
ness departments, we would be
swamped with tryoutees, for there
is every bit as much "romance"
and fun working on the business
staff of a periodical as there is on
the editorial side, and it is finan
cially more profitable, besides in
troducing the student to a big in
dustry for life work.
What do you do when you are
on the business staff that is so
much fun? You do somewhat the
same kind of work that you would
do on the editorial staff, except
that you are called "practical" in
stead of "temperamental." If you

are a reporter, you would, as ev
eryone knows, interview someone,
and then write up what he said.
If you are on the business staff,
you write an ad for a store, and
then try to sell your "master
piece." So, whether you are on
the edit or "biz" staff, you are
writing and seeing people. But,
you say, people don't want to see
salesmen. How many of you would
like to have a reporter poking his
nose into your private life?
After your first year on the busi
ness staff, when you do odd jobs,
you are promoted, if you have
done your work well. First, you
are an "Account Manager," and
you handle all of the business from
several stores. Next, you are an
"Advertising Manager," and are
placed in charge of one of the fol
lowing territories: North Palo Alto,
South Palo Alto, or San Francisco.
After the end of a year as adver
tising manager, one of the three is
made Business Manager.
When you reach this point, you
are popularly supposed to draw a
big salary and do nothing. In
reality, all of the cares which you
had as advertising manager seem
trivial, for you are placed in the
tough position of trying to make
ends meet. You have to pound on
your assistants for not selling
enough advertising. You have to

give the managing editor Hell for
running up the printing bill so
high. The sports editor won't speak
to you because you refuse to send
him to Columbia with the football
team to cover the game. The edi
tor begins to hate you because you
are always saying "No." You, in
turn, get sick of hearing the stu
dent manager saying "No." When
you go into the back-shop, the
student helper there asks you for
a raise, and Charlie and Bat re
mind you that it will cost you 25
cents to make this or that change
in an ad. You rush back to your
office to seek a little peace, but
you find a woman screaming about

a delivery boy who threw her pa
per in a mud puddle.
Despite the "pains of office,"
each business manager experiences
one of the saddest moments in his
life when he has to appoint some
one to take his place.
Would I rather be the editor
than the business manager? De
spite all the "glamour" attached to
an editor, I'd sooner write copy for
all the ads in The Daily than to

one of the saddest moments in his

one to take his place.
Would I rather be the editor

an editor, I'd sooner write copy for
all the ads in The Daily than to
write another column!

"I think that it's wonderful that
you are working on your school
paper. Are you the editor? . . .
Oh, the business manager? . . .
Do you mean you are the manag
ing editor?"
These questions are familiar to a
business manager of The Daily,
for to most people there are only
two positions on a newspaper, that

of editor and managing editor. For
example: a wide-eyed freshman
(for description of said fellow, re
fer to Mr. Batman's column of
August 9) wanders into the busi
ness office and merely says that he
would "like to try out for The
Daily." A zealous member of the
staff rushes to the business man
ager's office, grabs a blue registra
tion card, dashes back to the pros
pect, and quickly has him fill it
out. Then he begins his pep talk
about the romance of selling ads,
writing copy, and doing office work.
The meek freshman tries to inter
rupt him, but the staff member goes
on with his sales talk.
"Doesn't it all sound wonder
ful?" asks the junior officer, after
he has worked himself up to a high
key of excitement, and all the
* See issue of July 28.

while thinking what a super-sales
man he must be.
'"But," apologetically replies the
freshman, "I'm interested in work
ing on the editorial, not the busi
ness staff."
If this were an individual case,
it might be funny; but it's just
one out of a dozen similar expe
riences. It's not true of just The
Daily, but of the Quad and the
Chappie, too.
This situation is not the fault of
the students; it's the fault of the
publications. Ironically enough,
these business departments spend
their time selling advertising,
while they are forgetting to adver
tise themselves. If we could do a
good job of advertising the busi
ness departments, we would be
swamped with tryoutees, for there
is every bit as much "romance"
and fun working on the business
staff of a periodical as there is on
the editorial side, and it is finan
cially more profitable, besides in
troducing the student to a big in
dustry for life work.
What do you do when you are
on the business staff that is so
much fun? You do somewhat the
same kind of work that you would
do on the editorial staff, except
that you are called "practical" in
stead of "temperamental." If you

are a reporter, you would, as ev
eryone knows, interview someone,
and then write up what he said.
If you are on the business staff,
you write an ad for a store, and
then try to sell your "master
piece." So, whether you are on
the edit or "biz" staff, you are
writing and seeing people. But,
you say, people don't want to see
salesmen. How many of you would
like to have a reporter poking his
nose into your private life?
After your first year on the busi
ness staff, when you do odd jobs,
you are promoted, if you have
done your work well. First, you
are an "Account Manager," and
you handle all of the business from
several stores. Next, you are an
"Advertising Manager," and are
placed in charge of one of the fol
lowing territories: North Palo Alto,
South Palo Alto, or San Francisco.
After the end of a year as adver
tising manager, one of the three is
made Business Manager.
When you reach this point, you
are popularly supposed to draw a
big salary and do nothing. In
reality, all of the cares which you
had as advertising manager seem
trivial, for you are placed in the
tough position of trying to make
ends meet. You have to pound on
your assistants for not selling
enough advertising. You have to

give the managing editor Hell for
running up the printing bill so
high. The sports editor won't speak
to you because you refuse to send
him to Columbia with the football
team to cover the game. The edi
tor begins to hate you because you
are always saying "No." You, in
turn, get sick of hearing the stu
dent manager saying "No." When
you go into the back-shop, the
student helper there asks you for
a raise, and Charlie and Bat re
mind you that it will cost you 25
cents to make this or that change
in an ad. You rush back to your
office to seek a little peace, but
you find a woman screaming about

a delivery boy who threw her pa
per in a mud puddle.
Despite the "pains of office,"
each business manager experiences
one of the saddest moments in his
life when he has to appoint some
one to take his place.
