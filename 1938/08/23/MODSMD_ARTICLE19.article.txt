"Recent progress in public plan
ning indicates the public is now
awake —awake through organized,
co-ordinated action, sanctioned and
sponsored by government: local,
state, and national," said Elmore
Peterson, acting professor of mar
keting at Stanford, who spoke over,
radio station KGO last evening.
Speaking on the subject, "Prog
ress in Public Planning," Peter
son, dean of the University of Colo
rado School of Business and mem
ber of the Colorado State Planning
Commission, outlined government
al planning from the time of an
cient Egyptian and Roman Civili
zations until the present day.
He pointed out that modern city
planning in the United States
dates from the time of the Chicago
World's Fair in 1893. He stated that
municipal agencies have developed
so that there are now over "218
cities with comprehensive city
plans that are being followed in
their development. In city plan

for public planning on a larger
scale."
Peterson further emphasized that
national planning began in the
United States during the presiden
tial term of Theodore Roosevelt,

who created the Country Life
Commission, and has culminated

state in the Union has a planning
commission," Peterson pointed out.
Public planning has already giv

tive movement for the better and
wiser use of our resources, human
and material, to the end that even
yet higher and happier standards
of living may be achieved/' he
said.
