West coast reports have it that
record-breaking Howard Hughes,
manufacturer-airman and one
time producer, may stage a come
back on the movie lot with a pic
ture he believes would be a "nat
ural," an aeronautical epic based
on the life of the late Amelia Ear
hart, with Katherine Hepburn in
the role of the famous woman
flier.
Hughes, who Saturday set a new
transcontinental mark for trans
port planes at 10 hours and 35 min
utes flying the same ship in which
two weeks ago he circled the globe
in 92 hours, has remained silent on
the subject of a new picture.
George Palmer Putnam, husband
of the late first lady of American
aviation who was lost in the South
Pacific more than a year ago, ad
mitted that there had been talk of
such a film.
In a conversation with Miss
Hepburn's manager, William
Hawks, Putnam's agent, said he

learned that the star "probably
would like very much to undertake
such a role." Hawks added that
Hughes' own business representa
tives had first broached the sub
ject of this picture. But all parties
maintained that the matter had not
progressed beyond the conversa
tional stage.
From trade circles it was learned
that Hughes, whose name has
been linked romantically with Miss
Hepburn's, regards a movie based
on Amelia Earhart's life and avia

tion exploits as a "natural," par
ticularly so in view of the fact that
the actress resembles the former
airwoman to a marked degree.
It is said that the shy sports
man-pilot, who has held the cross
country speed plane record since
last January, took many thousand
feet of motion-pictures during his
recent round-the-world flight.
This, in addition to reels unused
in his famous sky-thriller, "Hell's
Angels," would furnish fine mate
rial for a new epic of the air.
