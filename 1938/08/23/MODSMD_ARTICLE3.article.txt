## Play Review 
### KATHARINE PAGE 
Felton Elkins' play, "Gringo's
Gamble," which was presented last
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
nights in the Memorial Hall, may
have drawn Peninsula socialites,
but it had little more, if that, to
lend it any significance. It was a
play constituted of excessive and
unconnected activity, of superflu
ous speeches and pseudo-poetic
lines, of atmosphere and color that
blinded rather than exhilarated.
There was no real dramatic strug
gle, no unified dramatic action to
leave an audience with a satisfied
and complete impression.
Mr. Elkins did not take advan
tage of the opportunities which the
subject afforded, nor did he ap
pear to have any dramatic insight
into the situations which confront
ed early California settlers. The
play gave promise of portraying
the antagonism between Spaniards
and Americans, railroad builders
and landowners, but it ended with
emphasis on the amorous relations
between hero and heroine.
Mr. Elkins got himself and his
audience into difficulties by at
tempting to inject too much into
his play. It would have been well
if he had omitted some of the gun
shooting and knife-throwing in
terludes, and had directed more
effort to creation of character. As
it was, such standard types as
high-spirited women, unscrupu
lous exploiters, charming highway
men, drunkards, and dandies fig
ured in the action.
If Jack Gillis did not do his best
with the part of Danny Banon, it
was because the role of a swag
gering, reckless, yet still charming
and potentially virtuous dandy af
forded scant possibility for subtle
or finished technique.
It appears that Mr. Elkins has a
sadly distorted sense of values
when he tries to make an attrac
tive and appealing figure out of
the snobbish heroine, Carlotta, who
is guilty of two clandestine mar
riages (she is excused from these,
however, since for some unknown
reason she fails to consummate the
first and hesitates over the last),
and who raves irrationally through
the greater part oi the action.
Dorothy Leverenz flashed her eyes
professionally in her fulfillment of
the xole.
Janet Dole excelled as the song
and-dance actress, Melody O'Hara.
This character and Miss Dole's in
terpretation was one high-light in
the play.
Bud Cady in his part of Car
lotta's drunken brother had only a
meager opportunity to demonstrate
his acting ability, but he made
himself likeable, while J. P. Cahn
was necessarily hateful as "Bull"
Finch, the disagreeable saloon
keeper.
Waldemar Johansen and William
Bassett are to be commended for
their labor and success with stage
settings; Charles E. Fitts for his
lighting technique; Helen Green
for her artistic costume creation;
and the student actors for putting
their talented energies to the effort
of making the inferior material
handed them presentable.

have drawn Peninsula socialites,
but it had little more, if that, to
lend it any significance. It was a
play constituted of excessive and
unconnected activity, of superflu
ous speeches and pseudo-poetic
lines, of atmosphere and color that
blinded rather than exhilarated.
There was no real dramatic strug
gle, no unified dramatic action to
leave an audience with a satisfied
and complete impression.
Mr. Elkins did not take advan
tage of the opportunities which the
subject afforded, nor did he ap
pear to have any dramatic insight
into the situations which confront
ed early California settlers. The
play gave promise of portraying
the antagonism between Spaniards
and Americans, railroad builders
and landowners, but it ended with
emphasis on the amorous relations
between hero and heroine.
Mr. Elkins got himself and his
audience into difficulties by at
tempting to inject too much into
his play. It would have been well
if he had omitted some of the gun
shooting and knife-throwing in
terludes, and had directed more
effort to creation of character. As
it was, such standard types as
high-spirited women, unscrupu
lous exploiters, charming highway
men, drunkards, and dandies fig
ured in the action.
If Jack Gillis did not do his best
with the part of Danny Banon, it
was because the role of a swag
gering, reckless, yet still charming
and potentially virtuous dandy af
forded scant possibility for subtle
or finished technique.
It appears that Mr. Elkins has a
sadly distorted sense of values
when he tries to make an attrac
tive and appealing figure out of
the snobbish heroine, Carlotta, who
is guilty of two clandestine mar
riages (she is excused from these,
however, since for some unknown
reason she fails to consummate the
first and hesitates over the last),
and who raves irrationally through
the greater part oi the action.
Dorothy Leverenz flashed her eyes
professionally in her fulfillment of
the xole.
Janet Dole excelled as the song
and-dance actress, Melody O'Hara.
This character and Miss Dole's in
terpretation was one high-light in
the play.
Bud Cady in his part of Car
lotta's drunken brother had only a
meager opportunity to demonstrate
his acting ability, but he made
himself likeable, while J. P. Cahn
was necessarily hateful as "Bull"
Finch, the disagreeable saloon
keeper.
Waldemar Johansen and William
Bassett are to be commended for
their labor and success with stage
settings; Charles E. Fitts for his
lighting technique; Helen Green
for her artistic costume creation;
and the student actors for putting
their talented energies to the effort
of making the inferior material
handed them presentable.
Felton Elkins' play, "Gringo's
Gamble," which was presented last
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
nights in the Memorial Hall, may
have drawn Peninsula socialites,
