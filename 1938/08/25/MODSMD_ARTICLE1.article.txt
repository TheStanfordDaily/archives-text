# THE CAMPUS
## RETIRES 
### ART STOKES 
Some morning next week a
quiet, white-haired man will step
out of the Administration Build
ing, meet a friend or two, walk
around the Quad and up the hill.
Promptly at 10 o'clock he will sit
down in the Cellar with a cup of
coffee â€”and a habit that has be
come almost a rite will bow out of
Stanford with George B. Culver.
That 10 o'clock cup will be the
last in a series which has been, to
many students, almost the only
public appearance of Mr. Culver as
dean of men. There has been an
afternoon cup, too, but in student
eyes it has been less noted.
Now at 65, after 17 years in ad
ministrative office, Dean Culver is
retiring, as inconspicuously as he
has conducted his connections with
the Stanford student body.
His activities in those years since
1920 have at one time and another
touched every student in the Uni
versity. He promoted, started and
saw the results of one of this coun
try's outstanding honor codes; he
promoted the student government
system which gives Stanfordites a
scope of control almost unknown
in other universities; he promoted
the Co-operative Purchasing Com
missary which lifted fraternities
out of the lake of red ink in which
they had been sinking for years; he
opposed and gradually extinguished
the "Rough" tradition; he prompt
ed, with student co-operation, a
"back-to-the-Farm movement" in
1933.
But to Dean Culver the greatest
satisfaction of those years stems
from the personal touches, from the
quiet solution of private dilemmas
and "messes" which kept more
than one Stanford man off the
rocks of financial and academic
disaster.
Countless times he has come to
the rescue of some over-optimistic
undergraduate who kept his check
stubs in order, not by subtraction,
but by addition; who wrote pres
ent checks on hoped-for future in
come, or who perhaps simply
utilized some one else's account.
And they will be more import
ant to the recipients than a re
memberance of May 23, 1921, when
the Academic Council accepted
the honor system; or the day in
1921 when the old-time sophomore
freshman baseball fight passed into
discard; or the later dates when
Rough Day, the Encina Raid, the
mud fight, and Sequoia "rat races"
died out.

Delegates

Ten delegates of the Peruvian
Commission en route to Japan on
a good will tour are expected to
visit the campus Monday after
noon. They will spend the morn
ing looking over the Exposition
grounds in San Francisco, and on
their arrival at the University will
be conducted on a tour of the
campus.
The party includes: General and
Mrs. Cesar A. de la Fuente, former
minister of foreign affairs; Dr. and
Mrs. Hernan Dellido, secretary
general of the ministry of foreign
affairs; Dr. Eduardo Sentillana y
Raygada, assistant director of the

commercial division of the ministry
of foreign affairs; Senor Don Arti
doro Alvarado Carrido, chief of the
bureau of mines of the ministry of
Fomento; Dr. and Mrs. Oscar
Arrus, dean of the faculty of sci
ence of the University of San Mar
cos; Senor Don Augusto Maurer,
president of the National Indus
trial Association; Senor Don Car
los Alzamora of the National Agri
cultural Society; Senor Don Jose
Berkemeyer Pazos, Chamber of
Commerce of Lima; Dr. and Mrs.
Manual Cisneros Sanchez of the
Bar Association of Lima; and Dr.
and Mrs. Enrique Garcia Bayan,
professor at the Catholic Univer
sity.

With more than $40,000 worth of
new, remodeled, and redecorated
houses on the campus, students re
turning to school in September
will find the Farm a changed and
improved place.
Midway up the Row, just across
the street from the recently re
built Beta house, a large new
building is approaching completion.
This impressive, three - story,
Georgian type structure is the new
Sigma Chi fraternity house. Built
in the shape of a "T," the $30,000
building is the work of Architect
John K. Branner. Among other
distinctive features, the new house
will contain a special room for
chapter meetings. The building
probably will not be ready for oc
cupancy until some time after
school opens in the fall.
Alpha Sigs returning to their
Salvatierra Street home will find a
remodeled interior awaiting them.
Several thousand dollars have
been expended in redecorating and
enlarging first-floor rooms.
Among the sororities, the Alpha
Phi's will return to an improved
home. Three thousand dollars has
been spent to rebuild the front of
the house and to enlarge and re
design the living room. Also re
ceiving a new face is the S.A.E.
fraternity house directly across
from the post office.
All good things end. The Daily
Shack last night folded back the
covers and put the paper finally
to bed.
