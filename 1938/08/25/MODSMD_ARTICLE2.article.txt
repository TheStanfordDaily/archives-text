his play.
Secretary of the Kansas State
Historical Society, Mr. Mecham has
published verse in Harpers and
The Saturday Evening Post, writ
ten a detective novel, and half a
dozen plays.
He says of John Brown, "There
have been several plays about
Brown, and a number of novels,
but they either whitewash him,
make him crazy, or show him as a
conscious hypocrite. He was none
of these, but a very complex char
acter. Next to ti'ying to write an
actable play with plenty of con
flict and action, I have attempted
to make it a psychological study of
Brown as he progressed from be
ing merely a militant abolitionist
to his final realization that he could
turn his failure at Harper's Ferry
to martyrdom and fame."
The cast of the play reading in
cludes: H. Miles Heberer, Sidney
Head, Sidney Lewis as members of
Brown's company; Richard Lewis
as Oliver Brown; Curt Zimansky
as Lieut. J. E. B. Stuart and Eger
ton Lakin as Governor Henry A.
Wise of Virginia. Both Zimansky
and Lakin will also be commanders
of the forces defending Lawrence.
Marshall Dill will play Wilson
Shannon, second territorial gover
nor of Kansas, and Senator J. M.
Mason. George Z. Wilson will be
Samuel Jones, a pro-slavery
leader.
John Brown will be played by
Cliff Giflin; Frederick Brown by
Albert Gerould; Martha Brewster
by Julia Sandoe; Anne Brown by
Kae Kalenborn; Jason Brown by
B. Russell Brinley; William Doyle
by George Z. Wilson, who also
reads the part of Dangerfield and
Jeremiah Anderson. Myna Brun
ton Hughes will play Mrs. Doyle
and also Mrs. Huffmaster.
Lee Chapin will play George H.
Hoyt, and Chester Barker will be
Captain Sinn of the Fredericks
burg Militia. Mr. Sampley, author
of "Last Illusion," who has been
on the campus all week, says of
verse drama: "Poetry in some form
or other is the natural language
of deep passion. The lifting and
cleansing power of tragedy lies not
in the agony which it presents, but
in the human response to that
agony. Our own age, certainly, is
one of tragedy. Thinking man is
confronted constantly with the
ominous implications of his own
conduct and is in a measure the
spectator of his own doom."
This belief leads Mr. Sampley to
say that "The time is, in fact,
auspicious for a sudden flowering
of poetic drama in America." He
hopes for a small theater, perhaps
on a college campus, which will
stage annually a number of verse
plays selected, as are those for the
Maxwell Anderson award, on a
competitive basis.
The following people will read
parts in "Last Illusion" tonight:

Little Theater at 8 o'clock tomor
row night. His subject will be "A
Characteristic of American Trag
edy."
Dr. Margery Bailey will discuss
the ten best plays of the contest at
this time also.
Miss Elizabeth Buckingham is
chairman of a luncheon to be held
in the Union dining room Saturday
for which reservations are to be
made in advance.
At this luncheon Myna Brunton
Hughes and George Wilson will
discuss verse drama in schools, and*
Dorothea Johnston of the John
ston Players at Saratoga and
Jack Thomas of the Wayfarers,
San Francisco, will speak on verse
drama in community theaters.
Saturday afternoon there will be

followed by tea in the Green
Room. Mr. Frank Fenton of San
Francisco State College will pre
side at the Authors' dinner Satur
day evening in the Union.

French Film Pleases

"La Kermesse Heroique," the
French film which was awarded the
Grand Prix du Cinema Francaise,
was enthusiastically received last
night by a large audience in Me
morial Hall.
Exhibiting the delightful and un
inhibited humor of the French, the
picture was excellent for the nat
ural acting ability of every charac
ter; for its significant attention to
detail; for quick and well-balanced
sequences of farcical scenes, and
for photographic composition.
Dr. John A. Sellards, director of
the Summer Quarter, is to be com
mended for his successful direc
tion of the Tuesday Evening Series,
and we particularly extend our
thanks to him for giving us, as a
lart event, "La Kermesse He
roique." â€”K. P.

verse drama: "Poetry in some form

spectator of his own doom."
This belief leads Mr. Sampley to
say that "The time is, in fact,
auspicious for a sudden flowering
of poetic drama in America." He
hopes for a small theater, perhaps
on a college campus, which will
stage annually a number of verse
plays selected, as are those for the

French Film Pleases

"La Kermesse Heroique," the
French film which was awarded the
Grand Prix du Cinema Francaise,
was enthusiastically received last
night by a large audience in Me
morial Hall.
Exhibiting the delightful and un
inhibited humor of the French, the
picture was excellent for the nat
ural acting ability of every charac
ter; for its significant attention to
detail; for quick and well-balanced
sequences of farcical scenes, and
for photographic composition.
Dr. John A. Sellards, director of

French Film Pleases

"La Kermesse Heroique," the
French film which was awarded the
Grand Prix du Cinema Francaise,
was enthusiastically received last
night by a large audience in Me
morial Hall.
Exhibiting the delightful and un
inhibited humor of the French, the
picture was excellent for the nat
ural acting ability of every charac
ter; for its significant attention to
detail; for quick and well-balanced
sequences of farcical scenes, and
for photographic composition.
Dr. John A. Sellards, director of
the Summer Quarter, is to be com
mended for his successful direc
tion of the Tuesday Evening Series,
and we particularly extend our

KIIiKE MECIIEM, Author of Prize Play
The reading of the Maxwell An

winning play, "John Brown," in
Memorial Hall at 8:30 o'clock Sat
urday night will conclude the
week's program of the Dramatist's
Assembly.
Tonight, "Last Illusion," by Ar
thur McCullough Sampley of Den
ton, Texas, which was awarded the
distinguished second honors in the
competition, will be read in the
Little Theater at 8 o'clock.
Kirke Mecham, the author of
"John Brown" has arrived in San
Francisco from Topeka, Kansas,
and will be here for the reading of
his play.
Secretary of the Kansas State
Historical Society, Mr. Mecham has
published verse in Harpers and
The Saturday Evening Post, writ
ten a detective novel, and half a
dozen plays.
He says of John Brown, "There
have been several plays about
Brown, and a number of novels,
but they either whitewash him,
make him crazy, or show him as a
conscious hypocrite. He was none
of these, but a very complex char
acter. Next to ti'ying to write an
actable play with plenty of con
flict and action, I have attempted
to make it a psychological study of
Brown as he progressed from be
ing merely a militant abolitionist
to his final realization that he could
turn his failure at Harper's Ferry
to martyrdom and fame."
The cast of the play reading in
cludes: H. Miles Heberer, Sidney
Head, Sidney Lewis as members of
Brown's company; Richard Lewis
as Oliver Brown; Curt Zimansky
as Lieut. J. E. B. Stuart and Eger
ton Lakin as Governor Henry A.
Wise of Virginia. Both Zimansky
and Lakin will also be commanders
of the forces defending Lawrence.
Marshall Dill will play Wilson
Shannon, second territorial gover
nor of Kansas, and Senator J. M.
Mason. George Z. Wilson will be
Samuel Jones, a pro-slavery
leader.
John Brown will be played by
Cliff Giflin; Frederick Brown by
Albert Gerould; Martha Brewster
by Julia Sandoe; Anne Brown by
Kae Kalenborn; Jason Brown by
B. Russell Brinley; William Doyle
by George Z. Wilson, who also
reads the part of Dangerfield and
Jeremiah Anderson. Myna Brun
ton Hughes will play Mrs. Doyle
and also Mrs. Huffmaster.
Lee Chapin will play George H.
Hoyt, and Chester Barker will be
Captain Sinn of the Fredericks
burg Militia. Mr. Sampley, author
of "Last Illusion," who has been
on the campus all week, says of
verse drama: "Poetry in some form
or other is the natural language
of deep passion. The lifting and
cleansing power of tragedy lies not
in the agony which it presents, but
in the human response to that
agony. Our own age, certainly, is
one of tragedy. Thinking man is
confronted constantly with the
ominous implications of his own
conduct and is in a measure the
spectator of his own doom."
This belief leads Mr. Sampley to
say that "The time is, in fact,
auspicious for a sudden flowering
of poetic drama in America." He
hopes for a small theater, perhaps
on a college campus, which will
stage annually a number of verse
plays selected, as are those for the
Maxwell Anderson award, on a
competitive basis.
