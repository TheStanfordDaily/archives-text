registration and campus activities."
The paper will contain complete
programs of pre-registration and

the school year. It will also have
large sport and photo sections, be

The paper will be in the mails
in time to reach those students
who live in the East before they

Senator Leland Stanford was a
benefactor to all movie-goers. It
was during an attempt to prove his
contention that a horse sometimes
has all four legs off the ground
while running that one of the lead
ing contributions to the develop
ment of the moving picture cam
era was made.

"Although it is impossible at this

Registration for new students will

large number of freshmen are ex

Plans are well under way for The
Stanford Daily's fall quarter pre
registration issue. "Approximately
6000 copies will be circulated on
the campus and through the mails
September 16 and 17," according to
Dick Stepp, Daily business man
ager. The pre-reg issue will reach
all registered students, new fresh
men, and transfers.
Jim Stone, editor of Volume 94,
said, "The purpose of the pre-reg
issue is to give new and returning
students information pertaining to
registration and campus activities."
The paper will contain complete
programs of pre-registration and

the school year. It will also have
large sport and photo sections, be
sides a "round-up" of summer
quarter activities and the campus
as a whole.
The paper will be in the mails
in time to reach those students
who live in the East before they
return to the Farm.

on September 23.

Plans are well under way for The
Stanford Daily's fall quarter pre
registration issue. "Approximately
6000 copies will be circulated on
the campus and through the mails
September 16 and 17," according to
Dick Stepp, Daily business man
ager. The pre-reg issue will reach
all registered students, new fresh
men, and transfers.
Jim Stone, editor of Volume 94,
said, "The purpose of the pre-reg
issue is to give new and returning
students information pertaining to
registration and campus activities."
The paper will contain complete
programs of pre-registration and

the school year. It will also have
large sport and photo sections, be
sides a "round-up" of summer
quarter activities and the campus
as a whole.
The paper will be in the mails
in time to reach those students
who live in the East before they
return to the Farm.

Senator Leland Stanford was a
benefactor to all movie-goers. It
was during an attempt to prove his
contention that a horse sometimes
has all four legs off the ground
while running that one of the lead
ing contributions to the develop
ment of the moving picture cam
era was made.
