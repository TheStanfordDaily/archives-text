### HELEN STIRLING 
(Editor's Note: Helen Stirling,
head of the book department at
the Stanford Bookstore, knows
the "ins" and "outs" about just
what the best people at Stan
ford read and gives her views
on the hooks they should read.)
There are two schools of thought
on this topic, those who maintain
that Stanford students can't read,
and those, like myself, who assert
they not only can, but do! Yes, po
litely agrees the other school, but
what? In other words, name it!
This is of course the opening I've
been waiting for, so here goes!
Generally speaking, students'
reading habits ai'e infinitely more
varied than those displayed by av
erage bookshop patrons. The older
man or woman who buys books
usually follows a pretty set pat
tern. They are concerned in cer
tain definite types of literature or
subjects and are not easily inter
ested in things outside their par
ticular field. This is not true of
students, who are forming or de
veloping their tastes and interests
and are therefore much more liable
to branch out into new territory.
Students read comparatively lit
tle new fiction. The greater part of
fictional reading falls into the field
of established literature. The ex
ception to this is, of course, such
books as "Anthony Adverse" and
"Gone With the Wind," to say
nothing of Richard LaPiere's "Son
of Han" and Albert Guerard, Jr.'s
"The Past Must Alter." However,
had these two latter books not been
possessed of real merit, I doubt if
they would have enjoyed the fine
sale they did on the campus. Cain's
"Serenade" and Baker's "Young
Man with a Horn" have been run
ning about neck and neck. These
books have a particular appeal to
all who are interested in modern
music, besides being written in a
distinctly modern, terse style
which is a present vogue.
John Steinbeck has a large fol
lowing, not only from those who
discover and delight in the broad
humor of "Tortilla Flat," but from
the readers who are interested in
the human problem in modern life,
as presented for instance in "Of
Mice and Men" or "In Dubious
Battle."
By far the greatest amount of
book buying and reading is non
fiction, mainly books on world af
fairs, social and economic prob
lems. and the sciences. Biography
follows a close second, with travel
following a weak third. In this
category the new publication is
most popular. Indeed, one has to
be on one's toes to keep abreast of
the demand. But in this field it is
rarely that a new author goes very
far—students are critical of the
background and manner of presen
tation of the author who writes
theory or fact. Outstanding books

By HELEN STIRLING

in this connection have been Hog
ben's "Mathematics for the Mil
lion," Einstein's "Evolution of
Physics," Lynd's "Middletown" and
"Middletown in Transition," Mum
ford's "Culture of Cities," Brady's
"Spirit and Structure of Fascism,"
Robert's "The House That Hitler
Built" and many others. Eve
Curie's "Madame Curie" has been
the most read biography along with
such books as Duranty's "I Write
as I Please," Negly Farson's "Way
of a Transgressor," etc.
Among the reading students
there are many who collect the
books they have read and liked in
fine editions. Some specialize in
beautiful bindings, others in ex
amples of fine printing, while oth
ers look for beauty of illustration.
Then there are also those who col
lect first editions —a hobby and a
delight which all who read may
share.
Last but not least, let me say a
word about. "Ferdinand." In his
quiet cultured way he has worked
himself into the hearts and libra
ries of more students than enroll
in Western Civ! People don't buy
just one copy of "Ferdinand"; they
give him to all their friends, and
recommend him to all who will
listen! Long Live Ferdinand!

What Stanford Students Read

Cal Course

University of California's newly
organized department of journal
istic studies, geared to handle less
than 50 students, has proved so
popular with the opening of the
autumn sesison that Professor
Charles H. Raymond has been
forced to "cull" the 60 most prom
ising applicants from more than
200 who sought to enroll.
