"I'd like to make a gift to the
University," said a grey-haired
professor as he walked into Presi
dent Wilbur's office in 1933. Think
ing Professor Cubberley was an
other small donor, he escorted him
across the foyer of the Adminis
tration Building to Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth's office, where, much
to his amazement, he found out
that the "gift" was in six figures.
Ellwood Patterson Cubberley
stepped off the train with his wife
in 1898 to assume his duties in the
Department of Education, where he
was later to dream of an ideal edu
cation department. This week
corporation yard men began mov
ing books and furniture into the
new Education Building made pos
sible by Professor Cubberley's gift.
As an amateur architect, Profes
sor Cubberley designed the build
ing which will house the entire
education department, five experi
mental laboratories, a theater
equipped with sound and seating
500, a new enlarged library, meet
ing places for the education frater
nities, social rooms, and offices.
On the first floor are the admin
istration offices and teacher educa
tion offices, in addition to the the
ater and classrooms. The second

floor houses the library and of
fices of some of the professors,
while on the third are rooms for
special projects and cubicles for
use of students who need room to
type and do other special work.
There is also a social room equip
ped with soft chairs, magazines, a
ping pong table, and a kitchen
ette.
The Language Arts Investiga
tion, Social Studies Laboratory,
and others will be housed in the
new building instead of being
spread around the campus as they
are now.
Christian Science Organization
will hold its last meeting for the
quarter tonight on the top floor of
the Women's Clubhouse at 8
o'clock.

Radio Hour

"Administering a collection of
rare books is not without its thrill
ing moments," said Jeanette M.
Hitchcock, of the Stanford Univer
sity Library staff, in speaking of
the forthcoming radio discussion
of her work as keeper of rare
books.
Miss Hitchcock, who will speak
Monday evening on the Stanford
Radio Hour at 9:15 o'clock over
station KGO, has been director of
the rare book room since it was
organized seven years ago. She
will discuss both the development
of this section of the library and
the most valuable volumes that it
has received as contributions.
