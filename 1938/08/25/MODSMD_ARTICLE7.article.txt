The following letter, sent in by
members of the cast of "Gringo's
Gamble" expresses, I am sure, the
sentiments of everyone who has
ever worked with Mr. Johansen.
I, for one, wish to add my compli
ments and best wishes for his
well-deserved vacation. We'll all
be looking forward to his return
in the spring.
May we of the "Gringo's
Gamble" cast raise our drooping
heads to wish Bon Voyage and
speedy return to our friend,
Waldemar Johansen, technical
director of Memorial Hall.
For your unceasing effort,
your eye-inspiring result, your
lack of "artistic temperament,"
and your sincere, though tired
smile; we thank you and hope
your European vacation will be
a pleasant, but for our sake, short
one.
G. G. Company
Memorial Theater is a deserted
place this week. Chuck Fitts, Jim
Walters, J. P. Cahn and their as
sistants are putting in their last
few hours tearing down all of the
electrical equipment for repair and
inventory. Ditto Johansen and
Company.
Helen Green has her costume
room cleaned up and is busy work
ing in San Francisco creating cos
tumes for the San Francisco Opera
Ballet which opens in September.
Assisting Mrs. Green are Alice
Hind, Kay Baine, and Audrey
Brumfield—just for the fun and
experience of it all.
Students in Mr. Lange's directing
class are busily engaged in putting
the final touches on their produc
tions. These will be presented to
morrow afternoon, 4 to 6 o'clock, in
the Little Theater, starring such
newcomers to the Stanford stage as
Paula George, Mary Leles, Doro
thy Leßaker, Barbara Brown,
Florence Bigelow, and Betty Men
derson.
Since this is my last column, I
shall take this opportunity to thank
the members of the Division of
Speech and Drama, both students
and faculty, for the interest and co
operation which they have shown,
all of which has made my work
more enjoyable and not a little bit
easier. To those of you who aren't
returning in the fall, good-bye and
good houses; and, to those who re
turn, I'll no longer be "That
damned reporter"!

I, for one, wish to add my compli
ments and best wishes for his
well-deserved vacation. We'll all
be looking forward to his return
in the spring.
May we of the "Gringo's
Gamble" cast raise our drooping
heads to wish Bon Voyage and
speedy return to our friend,
Waldemar Johansen, technical
director of Memorial Hall.
For your unceasing effort,
your eye-inspiring result, your
lack of "artistic temperament,"
and your sincere, though tired
smile; we thank you and hope
your European vacation will be
a pleasant, but for our sake, short
one.
G. G. Company
Memorial Theater is a deserted
place this week. Chuck Fitts, Jim
Walters, J. P. Cahn and their as
sistants are putting in their last
few hours tearing down all of the
electrical equipment for repair and
inventory. Ditto Johansen and
Company.
Helen Green has her costume
room cleaned up and is busy work
ing in San Francisco creating cos
tumes for the San Francisco Opera
Ballet which opens in September.
Assisting Mrs. Green are Alice
Hind, Kay Baine, and Audrey
Brumfield—just for the fun and
experience of it all.
Students in Mr. Lange's directing
class are busily engaged in putting
the final touches on their produc
tions. These will be presented to
morrow afternoon, 4 to 6 o'clock, in
the Little Theater, starring such
newcomers to the Stanford stage as
Paula George, Mary Leles, Doro
thy Leßaker, Barbara Brown,
Florence Bigelow, and Betty Men
derson.
Since this is my last column, I
shall take this opportunity to thank
the members of the Division of
Speech and Drama, both students
and faculty, for the interest and co
operation which they have shown,
all of which has made my work
more enjoyable and not a little bit
easier. To those of you who aren't
returning in the fall, good-bye and
good houses; and, to those who re
turn, I'll no longer be "That
damned reporter"!
