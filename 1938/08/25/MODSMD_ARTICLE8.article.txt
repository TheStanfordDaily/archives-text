With the National Air Races only
a week and a half off Frank W.
Fuller, Jr., Stanford '24, is again
tuning up his big Seversky mono
plane to enter the Bendix Trophy
Race, the annual cross-country
classic which he won last year, es
tablishing a new record of 7 hours
and 54 minutes elapsed time be
tween Los Angeles and Cleveland,
with an average speed of 258 miles
per hour. From Cleveland he con
tinued on to Bendix, N.J., to set a
new transcontinental mark of 9
hours and 33 minutes, a record
which he held until the following
January.
This year the wealthy sportsman
pilot in the specially-built, modi
fied Seversky fighter, will attempt
a repetition of last year's per
formance. His most recent exploit
on May 28 of this year was the
record Vancouver-to-Oakland hop
in 3 hours and 8 minutes, an aver
age speed of approximately 270
miles an hour.
At Stanford Fuller took a pre
legal course and received his A.B.
degree in 1924. He played varsity
baseball and was a member of
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

Official announcements yesterday
indicate that those students unfor
tunate enough to be taking their
last finals on Saturday morning,
September 3, will have to face the
struggle hungry, or get up a half
hour early to breakfast in Paly or

import some groceries the night
before. The Cellar closes Friday
night, to reopen Monday the 19th.
The last meal to be served in the
Union main dining room, and last
for Roble women at Union resi
dence, is dinner Friday evening.
Toyon and Roble Halls will
close Saturday afternoon and Sun
day noon, respectively. All stu
dents must depart by those times
and have their baggage properly
tagged for either storing or ship
ping.

Construction is nearing comple
tion on the large, decorative foun
tain which will stand between the
Library steps and Lasuen Street.
Costing approximately $2500, the
fountain is a gift of the classes of
'28, '29, '30, and '34. It was de
signed by Architects John Bake
well and Arthur Brown of San
Francisco.
The fountain will be 5 feet, 7
inches high. A 10-inch bowl will
stand in a 16-foot 4-inch bowl. Its
design will be in keeping with the
simplicity of the new Cubberley
Education Building and the Li
brary,

Students are urged to make post
office box reservations before
leaving for the three weeks' vaca
tion between quarters to avoid the
inconvenience of having to stand
in line at the beginning of the fall
quarter, it was announced yester
day by post office authorities.
Mr. Callahan, supervisor of the
post office, also advised students to
leave their home addresses

"Stub" Allison, Bear grid men
tor, seems no end optimistic over
his team's prospects for the com
ing season. He has many fine re
serves returning, and expects to
supplement them with the strong
group of " '41ers" coming up to
him this year. He plans a faster,
pass-studded attack this season,
instead of the smashing drives of
his last year's Wonder Team.
