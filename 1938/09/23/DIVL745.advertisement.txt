This was just two months after Widcman's started in Palo Alto.
If your father is a Stanford man, we undoubtedly furnished his
wardrobe. Naturally, styles are a lot different now and we have
a modernistic building four times larger than in 1906 and fifty
times the stock we carried in those days. The only thing that
Widcman's have not changcd through all these years is the
famous quality and honest value of their merchandise.
• ■ 111
We've gone through the famous days of Jim Lanagan, Ernie
Ncvcrs and all the other great Stanford eras. We saw Rugby
come and then American football take its place. We now enter
the Fall season of 1938 with visions of even greater things for
Stanford and you.
Through these 32 years of Stanford experience we have learned
to anticipate the styles that will be popular with the Stanford
man. In a few days you will be on the Campus. Drop in and
browse around. You will be interested in our new lines of
Stetson Hats, Hart Schaffncr Cr Marx Clothes, Phoenix Hosiery,
Arrow Shirts, Nunn-Bush and Edgerton Shoes, Rough Rider
Slacks, Arrow and Cheney Tics and other famous lines. Make
this your friendly clothing headquarters.
