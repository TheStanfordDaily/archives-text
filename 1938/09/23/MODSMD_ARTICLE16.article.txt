A Message to New Students:
It is the purpose of the University
fo give you the most adequate train
ing for Jiving effective lives. To this
end, the University provides, not only
instruction in many fields, and not
only various types of recreation, but
also a central place for the worship
of God. That place is the Memorial
Church.
The Memorial Church has no de
nominational bias of any kind, and
cannot have. All students and all
faculty members belong automatic
ally to it by virtue of their residence
at the University, and all are urged
to lake their portion of responsibility.

| It is part of your privilege, as a
| Stanford person, 10 spend one hdur a
! week, in company with your fellows,
j engaged in the cultivation and ex-
I pression of reverence.
