# 'Genial John' Bunn Begins New Duties
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
"A place where the student will always lin<l a warm welcome and a
helping hand."
That's Dean John Rutin's conception of his office, and it's one the
smiling man who took Stanford to the top in basketball should have 110
difficulty in maintaining. Succeeding George B. Culver as Dean of Men

after eight years as head basketball
coach, he enters the big office up
stairs in the Ad Building with an
enthusiasm and appreciation for his
task which promise much for the
students whose guide and adviser
he is.
"In a sense," he says, "the office is
v.'hat the students make it. Because
Stanford is still small enough to be
a family, the deans are able to
maintain a contact with the students
which is lacking in schools whose
enrollment is larger. Our task is to
re-establish the student-faculty re
lationship which increasing expan
sion tends to desti'oy; and this is
best achieved when the students
feel free to come to us as they
would to a friend."
HANDLES HOUSING
Chief work of the dean's office
varies as the year passes. With the
start of school scarcely a week away,
housing is the biggest problem at
present. Lack of adequate facilities
in the dormitories results each year
in an approved list of houses in Paly
to which the overflow is directed.
Scholarship also comes within the
dean's province. Serving as a mem
ber of the Scholarship Committee, he
is court of appeal for men seeking
reinstatement, advice on smoke-ups,
help in arranging study conditions,
and all other questions connected
with the problem of extracting fa
vorable grades from a fussy faculty.
Short-time loan funds fall due at
the beginning of every quarter, and
on them too the dean gives help and
advice. Tuition notes and student
aid come within his jurisdiction, as
do applications for scholarships.
HALL. ROW CONTACTS
Contact with the dormitories is
maintained through the Encina
sponsors and the Interclub Council,
with the Row through Interfraternity
Board of Control, of which the dean
is an ex officio member. Respon
sible under the Founding Grant for
the disciplinary functions of the
University, the President delegates
those concerning students to their
respective deans, who in turn give
control to the student ox-ganizations
which have been set up for that
purpose.
As ex officio member the dean
serves 011 most of the committees
which directly effect the student, in
cluding vocational, Lower Division,
Health, and Registration. Although
not serving in an official capacity on
the Pre-Reg period, he speaks to
the incoming freshmen, and in
other ways assists with the program.
In short, the Dean of Men serves
as go-between, contact-man, or
what you will, to the individual stu
dent in his relations with his fellows
and his University. "A champion of
student causes," Mr. Bunn calls
him; and the Farm may congratulate
itself on having so good and likeable
a champion.

Coast champ will not be an unde
feated outfit. In other words, not
as good as last year's Golden Bears.

he is.
"In a sense," he says, "the office is
v.'hat the students make it. Because
Stanford is still small enough to be
a family, the deans are able to
maintain a contact with the students
which is lacking in schools whose
enrollment is larger. Our task is to
re-establish the student-faculty re
lationship which increasing expan
sion tends to desti'oy; and this is
best achieved when the students
feel free to come to us as they
would to a friend."
HANDLES HOUSING
Chief work of the dean's office
varies as the year passes. With the
start of school scarcely a week away,
housing is the biggest problem at
present. Lack of adequate facilities
in the dormitories results each year
in an approved list of houses in Paly
to which the overflow is directed.
Scholarship also comes within the
dean's province. Serving as a mem
ber of the Scholarship Committee, he
is court of appeal for men seeking
reinstatement, advice on smoke-ups,
help in arranging study conditions,
and all other questions connected
with the problem of extracting fa
vorable grades from a fussy faculty.
Short-time loan funds fall due at
the beginning of every quarter, and
on them too the dean gives help and
advice. Tuition notes and student
aid come within his jurisdiction, as
do applications for scholarships.
HALL. ROW CONTACTS
Contact with the dormitories is
maintained through the Encina
sponsors and the Interclub Council,
with the Row through Interfraternity
Board of Control, of which the dean
is an ex officio member. Respon
sible under the Founding Grant for
the disciplinary functions of the
University, the President delegates
those concerning students to their
respective deans, who in turn give
control to the student ox-ganizations
which have been set up for that
purpose.
As ex officio member the dean
serves 011 most of the committees
which directly effect the student, in
cluding vocational, Lower Division,
Health, and Registration. Although
not serving in an official capacity on
the Pre-Reg period, he speaks to
the incoming freshmen, and in
other ways assists with the program.
In short, the Dean of Men serves
as go-between, contact-man, or
what you will, to the individual stu
dent in his relations with his fellows
and his University. "A champion of
student causes," Mr. Bunn calls
him; and the Farm may congratulate
itself on having so good and likeable
a champion.

Coast champ will not be an unde
feated outfit. In other words, not
as good as last year's Golden Bears.


JOHN BUNN
New Dean of Men
"A place where the student will always lin<l a warm welcome and a
helping hand."
That's Dean John Rutin's conception of his office, and it's one the
smiling man who took Stanford to the top in basketball should have 110
difficulty in maintaining. Succeeding George B. Culver as Dean of Men

after eight years as head basketball
coach, he enters the big office up
stairs in the Ad Building with an
enthusiasm and appreciation for his
task which promise much for the
students whose guide and adviser
he is.
