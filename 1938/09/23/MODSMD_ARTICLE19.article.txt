The beginning of a new school
year always brings with it new
hopes, renewed enthusiasms and an
opportunity for a fresh start in
every way. To the new students it
represents the introduction to a dif
ferent environment, which necessi
tates adjustments and, to most, a
total rearrangement of their habits
of living. Situations of this kind
should be welcomed by all because
they afford a chance to learn and to
progress.
I take this means of welcoming
each student to this kind of a world
here at Stanford. If at any time I
can be helpful in any way, I invite
you to come in to talk with me.
Each student should realize that
his or her residence here is a mu
tual undertaking. The University is
here to provide the facilities and the
tools for the use of the students.
Whether they are used and how
ar.d what the student profits depend
on the use the student himself
makes of them.
I wish for you all a happy and
worthwhile school year. Good luck!
