# Gordy Davis Lays Down Campus Traffic Regulations
## 
### 
Gordy Davis' summer of semi
peace-and-quiet will be over in lit
tle more than a week when Stan
ford's 4000 comes back and starts
driving on Farm roads once again.
Gordy has made no new traffic
rules, but wishes to remind the 4000
that:

Speed limit is 25 miles an hour
on Palm Drive and on Lasuen from
Memorial Hall to the highway, ex
cepting at the Faculty Club corner,
and 20 miles an hour at all other
spots on the campus.
A stop sign means coming to a
complete stop at all times.
Parking is allowed only on one

.side of the street at the postoffice,
and only on one street. Because
Salvatierra is so narrow, cars can
be parked only on one side of the
street, and only on one side on the
street between Lasuen and Arguello.
The rule against riding on run
ning boards will be, as usual,
strongly enforced.
