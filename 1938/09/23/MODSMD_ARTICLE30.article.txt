# Menuhin, Iturbi Top Concert Series List
## 
### 
Yehudi Menuhin, Jose Iturbi, Igor Gorin, and llclen Jcpson are the
four artists which the Stanford Concert Series will present in their I!KJ -;j!)
program.
The season will open November !) when Menuhin, world famous
violinist, will play in Memorial llall. About a year has elapsed since he

emerged from that long retirement
at the Menuhin family's Los Gatos
ranch, a year marked chiefly by
Menuhin marriages and the Schiu
mann Concerto.
Following his retirement Yehudi
and his sister, Hepzibah, toured
Europe and America and appeared
together for the last time at the San
Francisco opera house last June.
Hepzibah is now living in Australia
with her husband, who is also the
brother of Yehudi's wife.
CRITICS COMMKNT
The sum total of critical reaction
| regarding Menuhin's music is put in
j these two paragraphs from the Phil
adelphia Record:
"Ten years ago Menuhin was a
child wonder. Five years ago he
was an adolescent genius who play
ed like an angel. Today, at 21, after
two years of retirement spent in
perfecting his already almost per
fect art, the priest-like young vir
j tuoso has emerged as a full fledged
j artist of the purest water; mature
and emotionally awakened.
j ITURBI TO PLAY
Jose Iturbi, pianist yvho will ap
pear January 4, first studied music
at the Conservatory of Valencia, his
native city, and later in Barcelona
and Paris. For four years he was
head of the piano faculty at the
Conservatory of Geneva, a position
onpe held by Liszt, author of the
; Transcendental Etudes which Iturbi
j plays so well.
According to Lawrence Gilman,
musicologist and critic of the Her
ald-Tribune, he plays Mozart as
Mozart himself must have played it.
Third artist on the Series is the
[ new baritone sensation, Igor Gorin,
I who will sing here March 1. Critics
| have called him the five-letter man
I of the university of music, because
| he is equally at home in the realms
I of radio, cinema, phonograph, com
| position and the concert hall.
Edcar S. Van Olinda, Albany
critic, says that Gorin's upper tones,
of pure baritone quality, "ring out
with the virility of a robust tenor.
In fact, Mr. Gorin just escaped be
ing a tenor."
Helen Jepson, American soprano,

close the 1938-39 concert season
May 4. Although her charm and
beauty excite almost as much com
ment from the critics as does her
singing, she is mistress of a wide
repertoire.
She ranges from operatic arias,
classical songs, and English ballads,
to ultra-modern American ditties
like "Lullaby a la Mode." Miss Jep
son alone has been declared suc
cessful as Thais, a part which has
been measured for decades by the
interpretation of Mary Garden, who
actually made the role.

Series artists.
