# A.S.S.U. Prexy Lee Predicts Big Year
## 
### 
It won't be long now until we
shall all be back at our books again.
Those of us who have seen Stan
ford for some time know that there
is no grander place to be than the
Farm. And because we think that

Stanford is the ideal university, we
are looking forward to a thoroughly
successful school year.
Of course, a victory over Santa
Clara during the first week of school
wouldn't be the worst thing that
could happen to us; nor would an
increased interest in A.S.S.U. activi
ties do us any harm. But after all,
it's the interest and enthusiasm of
each of us that will determine just
how far we shall go this year.
We might recall a lot of talk about
spirit last year. Well, we hope that

this coming year will see a revival
of the old "Farm Spirit," and that
there will be no need for anything
but favorable comment on every
school activity.
We each chose Stanford because
we thought it was "tops"—now let's
pledge ourselves to keep it 'tops.'"
