Foundation of Stanford students'
I right to govern themselves is re
sponsibility, arid the proving ground
of that responsibility is the honoi
J code.
' It is quite simple. Academically,
I it merely involves signing the honor
1 pledge on examinations—"no un
i permitted aid given or received."
But behind those simple words rests
j a tradition of honor, built up
! through years of experimentation
j with student government, and back
ed by a machine for its enforcement.
Contrary to expectations, most
Stanford students believe in the
honor code, follow it throughout
I their four years. The others, those
j who take advantage of its simplicity,
fali to count. And for those others—
: not simply as a reminder to the men
I and women who uphold the code—
exists the judicial organ of the Asso
ciated students—Men's and Wom
en's Councils.
The code is simple, self-explana
tory. Stanford men and women,
those that count, follow it.
