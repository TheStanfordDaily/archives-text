# Cardinals Set Pace For Farm Activity Parade
## Cardinals Vital In Campus Life 
### 
Key organization in Farm life is j
Cardinals and its attendant satellites, j
men's and women's rally commit- ,
tees. Variously called the campus ;
"'gravy boat," Ex Committee's stooge, i
or simply unprintable names, the j
complex group deserves few of the
hard terms, justifies its existence by
organizing and carrying out most
student functions on the campus.
Budding Cardinals start at the !
bottom by being chosen to one of j
the rally committees by the try-out
system. These two committees, each
separated into two "classes," con
sist of twenty men or women, di
rected by the Cardinals above them.
As their name suggests, they are
the lads and lassies who figure out
those complicated card stunts that !
fill in the half of the big games. They !
also run around at assorted tasks J
connected wiih the Big Game bon- I
fire, and miscellaneous rallies j
j throughout the year.
CARDINALS HOLD WHIP
j But it is Cardinals itself that holds
' the whip hand on activities. From
i after game dances to the annual
! Convalescent Home classic in the
j spring, Cardinals plans, organizes, |
| and executes.
It is a self-perpetuating body,
j electing its members from the rally
committees, or from the student
| body at large. Consisting of but 14
j members, from its ranks come lead
j ers for such activities as Game
bonfire and rally, Red Cross and i
j Convalescent Home drive, and chair- ;
men of dance committees.
In addition, Cardinals' duties in- i
elude welcoming visitors, heading j
i special committees, and general pro- i
motion of campus activities.
C(HWMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
For the most part, membership of
committees headed by Cardinals
' members may be chosen from the
student body at large. Charges of
favoritism in choosing committee
workers arise at this source, can be
but weakly defended % loyal Car
dinals.
! But however workers are chosen
by Cardinals to carry out their nu
| merous activities, the fact remains
' that under their direction the Farm
) proceeds on a working basis of con
stant activity throughout the whole
year.
