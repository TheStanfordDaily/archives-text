# New Card-File Will Aid Frosh
## 
### 
Answering the freshman's prayer
for some way to break into activi
: ties, the so-called "card file" was
! established late last spring and will
I ini.ke its debut in Farm activities
j this year.
Placed in the A.S.S.U. office, and
| handled by an activities co-ordina
| tor, the file will house the names of
all men and women interested in
| joining the campus activity parade.
Would-be committee heads and
; workers will sign up in the fik', to
j have their names on constant call
! when committees are to be appoint
i ed. Group leaders, faced with the
[task of picknig prospective workers,
j will consult the file, choose their
I group from its lists.
How well this theoretical plan
| works depends largely upon this
! year's incoming freshmen. The card
i file is not the only way to join cam
pus activities. They will learn the
' gravy boat, jobs still exist. But
Uhe card file is the answer to com
i plaints that able students have been
j overlooked in times past because of
lack of contact with activity leaders.
