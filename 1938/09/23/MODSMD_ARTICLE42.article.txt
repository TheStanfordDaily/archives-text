This word "welcome," now, that's being ham
mered at the frosh these first few days—it's a
funny word. Last year's editor shied from using
it; he said that editorial welcomes were just so
much waste type. He said that the word had
been worn out by high-school glad-handers, by
discouraged activity leaders seeking fresh com
mittee fodder, and by laundry agents trying to
beat out competitors.
In other words, saying "welcome" to the
freshmen is a pretty unsophisticated thing to do.
Maybe he was right. Maybe the word is hol
low.
But it's all in the way you say it.
For instance, we might say, "Welcome '42.
You're the greatest class to hit Stanford." Or
we might try it this way: "Welcome frosh.
You're coming to the greatest university in the
country."
But we'd be lying both times.
That's the trouble with saying "welcome."
You can't add anything which isn't inane—no
one can figure out just why '42 or any other
frosh class should make any difference to
Stanford.
It does though, in a subtle sort of way. Out
wardly, all frosh are alike. And outwardly, their
reception into Stanford is alike from year to
year. But as they come, they bring change, and
by the time they have seen three frosh classes
come behind them, Stanford is changed.
And change is good.
So because '42 will mean something to Stan
ford, something good, we say,
"WELCOME, FROSH."
