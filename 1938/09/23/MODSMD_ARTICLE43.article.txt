A few years back, a frosh-to-be read too many
books about college. The main thing he learned
was that every college man should take a vital
part in campus life; if he didn't he was pretty
much of a misfit. He also learned about the lads
who happened to come to school to learn some
thing; they were called "grinds" and nobody
even borrowed matches from them. Only term
papers.
So he came to Stanford, but he didn't remem
ber that 4,000 people is a lot of people. He met
a lot of the 4,000 and he got so that he could
call every single one of his frosh classmates by
their first name. That was a pretty hard job,
and unfortunately he never had much chance
to capitalize on his enterprise because he rolled
out after two quarters.
He had sure met a lot of people though.
