# And the Moral
## 
### 
I suppose that I recounted the sad story above
as an obscure object lesson to freshmen. I sup
pose that the thing to do now would be to hit
the old routine which runs something like this:
Stanford is a school not a playground if you
want a four-year vacation there are cheaper
places and some of them don't have rain in the
winter and this is not a country-club.
From there I wander into a brief but snappy
discussion of "Stanford and the new serious
ness." And finish up on high C with a plea foi»
less Big Appling down the aisles of the reserve
book room.
But I would be making guite an ass of myself.
So would anyone who tries to say that Stan
ford is not exactly what you make it.
Academically it can turn out men and women
fitted with hot and cold running facts—but no
thought. Just as easily, Stanford can cultivate
a sort of hot-house plant who knows only how
lo speak in the correct sophisticated tone about
owning a Cadillac.
It can turn out men fitted to run a factory or
wipe your windshield. It can turn out women
able to run a comfortable home or dance the
tango while balancing a tea-cup neatly on one
silk-sheathed knee.
Or it can send out men and women ready to
live thoughtfully, actively.
It's just as you please.
No one will tell you what to do with Stanford,
just as no one will tell you how you should live
your life. Everyone here is too worried about
themselves to bother about anyone else.
So you can write your own prescription, com
pounded of all that Stanford has to give. You
won't be called out of bounds on an overdose.
But you can be awfully sick from too much
ice-cream.
