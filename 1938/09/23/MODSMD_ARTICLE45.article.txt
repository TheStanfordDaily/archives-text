# Requiem in Steel

### 
When Encina becomes inhabited with burly
football players, professors start dusting off the
textbooks, and the "Make Checks Payable . .
sign at the cashier's window is refurbished for

the fall rush, Stanford begins to mushroom to
life after a semi-somnolent summer.
And as internally the Farm becomes a teem
ing, brawling place of Lord-knows-how-many
foot-pounds of kinetic energy, externally it
begins to erect an invisible wall around it, with
a sign in ghostly Neon lights—"No Admittance,
World."
Or so it has been.
But perhaps this year the distant rumble of
heavy guns rolling up to border fortifications,
the fanatic mouthings of mad-dog dictators will
break down that invisible barrier which sepa
rates Stanford from the world.
Perhaps by the time this is in print, those
distant rumblings of a fear-mad world will have
been transformed by war to crack the childish
shell which Stanford men and women carry
about them on the Farm.
It may be that while the Farm is rollicking
through football season, rushing, politics, and
dances, it will see a picture of Stanford as it
was in 1917, when khaki uniforms were in style,
and the names on the plaque in Memorial
Theater were more than only names.
It won't change much, that picture, even if
those here do see a hazy vision of it. But it may
make Stanford think a little.
And from that thought may come the seed
which will spread rebellion—if war comes.
Stanford may go on as usual—this year.
There will be dancing, and footballing, and
all the rest . . .
While the guns roll up to new Western fronts.

I've put a lot of lead into type up above in
the form of welcomes, handy hints to conquer
ing Stanford, and the meaning of it all. Now
Bull Sessioner, at my right, says that kind of
thing is silly.
Okay so it's silly.
But I couldn't let all that lead just go to
waste, could I?
One must have chaos within to give birth to
a dancing star. —Nietzche
The good speaker incurs no discussion, be
cause in his argument he leaves room for the
opinion of others.—Laotze
I know of no better way to secure the repeal
of obnoxious laws than their stringent execu
tion. —Ulysses S. Grant
