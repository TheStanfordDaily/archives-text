# Lightly . . . And Politely

### 
YEAR after year (for two years) I am constantly
surprised at how inspired freshmen become as
soon as they get into Encina. They can think of more
damn things to do.
They throw, or have in the past, enough water
bags each year to float Encina and drown all the ants
under it—if the bags had all come down the stair
well at one time. But anyone can throw a water-bag;
it's the nicety of the way they do it occasionally that
makes it notable.
* * * *
Those boys in Encina keep their eyes open. When
a guy on the third floor leans out of his window to
drop water bags on the people below him, I have seen
someone in the room above him douse him with a
bucket of water. There is no common enemy. They
are all just so many targets.
It was very late one night when one of my Encina
room-mates stuck one of our beds partially out the
window. It had been out there about 30 seconds when
someone got it with a water-bag.
It amazes me.
* * * *
Then there was the year that a bunch of frosh
dragged one of Encina's big laundry tins up to the
fourth floor, filled it with water, and pushed it down
the stair-well. It went clear through to the basement.
Like the chimney in the 190(5 earthquake.
Water-bags aren't their only toys. At 2 o'clock al
most every night for quite a while the boys in the
room above me used to start beating with something
on the radiator pipes. If you don't think that's fiend
ish, listen to it some night.
* * * *
last year in one room two of the boys quite
frequently threw all the light globes in the room
out of the window at night to keep their room-mate
from studying after they had gone to bed. The frosh
arc so cool about these things, so cold-blooded.
It is no trick at all for them to tear nearly all of
the upright sticks along the stair railings out in less
than three minutes when they think Cal has come,
or to throw a chair through a window, or to calmly
jam an elbow or even the heads of their room-mates
through a mirror.
And I'll never forget the morning I saw a bed sail
down past my window and collapse on the cement
below it. Before I could get to the window two more
had followed it. Those frosh are fast. They know
a cue when they see one.
People have had a lot of theories about why En
cina's frosh do the things they do. I say it is pure
inspiration. How else can you explain the fact that
they will stack their own rooms, or help someone
alse stack them, putting everything including their
own junk in the most fantastic places—just to play a
joke on their room-mates? As any storage company
man could tell you, it's quite a brisk job to stack a
room and very messy and complicated to get it back
again. Frankly I can't sec stacking my room just so I
can laugh secretly to myself at my room-mate while
I help him unpack it. Only a frosh, an inspired frosh,
could.
It makes me shudder to think of the things those
frosh put in each other s beds. They collect any num
ber of small but obnoxious exhibits of wild animal and
insect life. All of them are sooner or later put in
someone's bed. They sprinkle each other's sheets with
corn-flakes, glue, decaying worm solution, and pow
dered sugar. There s nothing more effective than pow
dered sugar. They put bottles in each other's beds
with corks tied to the foot. When you pull the bottle
out, the cork stays. Use your imagination.

It was very late one night when one of my Encina
room-mates stuck one of our beds partially out the
window. It had been out there about 30 seconds when
someone got it with a water-bag.
It amazes me.
* * * *
Then there was the year that a bunch of frosh
dragged one of Encina's big laundry tins up to the
fourth floor, filled it with water, and pushed it down
the stair-well. It went clear through to the basement.
Like the chimney in the 190(5 earthquake.
Water-bags aren't their only toys. At 2 o'clock al
most every night for quite a while the boys in the
room above me used to start beating with something
on the radiator pipes. If you don't think that's fiend
ish, listen to it some night.
* * * *
last year in one room two of the boys quite
frequently threw all the light globes in the room
out of the window at night to keep their room-mate
from studying after they had gone to bed. The frosh
arc so cool about these things, so cold-blooded.
It is no trick at all for them to tear nearly all of
the upright sticks along the stair railings out in less
than three minutes when they think Cal has come,
or to throw a chair through a window, or to calmly
jam an elbow or even the heads of their room-mates
through a mirror.
And I'll never forget the morning I saw a bed sail
down past my window and collapse on the cement
below it. Before I could get to the window two more
had followed it. Those frosh are fast. They know
a cue when they see one.
People have had a lot of theories about why En
cina's frosh do the things they do. I say it is pure
inspiration. How else can you explain the fact that
they will stack their own rooms, or help someone
alse stack them, putting everything including their
own junk in the most fantastic places—just to play a
joke on their room-mates? As any storage company
man could tell you, it's quite a brisk job to stack a
room and very messy and complicated to get it back
again. Frankly I can't sec stacking my room just so I
can laugh secretly to myself at my room-mate while
I help him unpack it. Only a frosh, an inspired frosh,
could.
It makes me shudder to think of the things those
frosh put in each other s beds. They collect any num
ber of small but obnoxious exhibits of wild animal and
insect life. All of them are sooner or later put in
someone's bed. They sprinkle each other's sheets with
corn-flakes, glue, decaying worm solution, and pow
dered sugar. There s nothing more effective than pow
dered sugar. They put bottles in each other's beds
with corks tied to the foot. When you pull the bottle
out, the cork stays. Use your imagination.
