# Play Flops Despite Star
## 
### 
"I Am Different," currently play
ing on the Curran stage, and starring
Talluiah Bankhead:
Except for the solid theatrical vir
tue of its star, this play is so bad it
is said that uninformed Geary street
residents petitioned the city to have
The Consolidated Chemical Works
moved back to Bayshore.
When, as in Zoe Akin's piece,
adultery is no longer an issue but
an assumption and nobody is even
shocked, we know that the spectre
of tinny sophistication has clanked
through its last drawing-room.
The story is about a woman writer
who offers pat nostrums for jeal
ousy until she falls for a half-baked
young man who forces her to eat
dirt. And she ignores the attentions
of a sensible doctor—her husband, to
be exact—for this young man whose
chief attraction for her seems to be
his failure to appreciate her intellect.
This piddling and frivolous love af
fair, of course, is pseudo and unin

teresting. And the next time sex
rears a pretty head in chapeau by
Lily Dache, we'll be on the lookout
for just such a department store
dummy.
However, Miss Bankhead is some
thing to reckon with. She gives sub
stance and vitality to a character
which must be a phoney in the
script. And her husky gurgle and
sharp use of naturalistic gesture
make the anachronism of a charming
and glamorous pedant a little less
glaring.
The hero, of course, is just a pip
squeak and John Emery had trouble
reducing his own suavity to idiocy.
Fritzi Scheff, I'm sorry, turned out
to be so much Hungarian ham with
the broad mannerisms and frantic
posturing which went with parlor
recitations of "Casey at the Bat."
All told, Mis Bankhead's distinc
tion as an actress is equalled only
by her ability to pick a bloomer for
her script.
