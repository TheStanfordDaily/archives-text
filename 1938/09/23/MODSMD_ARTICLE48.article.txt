# BULL SESSION
## 
### 
As this issue of The Daily goes
forth to serve as a Book of Revela
tions for the Frosh Bible, Bull Ses
sion is strangely tongue-tied. The
silence "is not sinister. Rather it is
like that one reverent moment that
comes between the time a tourist,
party catches sight of the Grand
Canyon and the time the first mem
ber says, "Gosh," in a throaty voice.
Before the miracle of generation
and change, I stand pleasantly ap
palled, like a small boy suddenly
presented with a baby brother.

It is customary, I believe, for the
Pre-reg edition to offer the incom
ing freshmen advice. It is expected
to play a grandfather to them, whis
pering of the glories that await in
this magic world where air-castles
are habitable, and golden dreams
assay 24 carats.
But by the time the freshman gets
to this corner of the page, he will
be an encyclopedia of advice about
Stanford. His father has already told
him to keep expenses down, and to
beware of designing women. His
mother has told him to keep his
feet dry and to sprint for the nose
spray if he begins to sniffle. His
brother has warned him for God's
sake not to call a fraternity a frat.
And the Frosh Bible has spoken like
a well-educated and tactful oracle
about the problems that will face
him.
* * #
I can add nothing more. I have
kept my expenses down by the sim
ple process of writing no more
checks after I receive a nasty note
from the bank. And I have been
unfortunately free from the atten
tions of designing women.
And so I am at liberty to con
template the miracle of the chang
ing generations.
The whole stiuation blushes with
a delicately ironic tinge. For with
out being grim or cutting, pre-regis
tration programs always carry the

VACATION VESPERS

gently satiric note of a Gilbert and
Sullivan operetta.
We who have lounged in Stan
ford's lap for the last few years are
expected to tell the newcomers what
the University is. And yet the new
after us, and will make the Univer
aftr us, and will make the Univer
sity what it is.
In some mystically vague way the
new will blend with the old, so that
Stanford will be different yet in
essence the same.
The various aspects of this para
dox have been explored in all their
bypaths. Carefully phrased speeches
have described the spirit of our
Alma Mater, tracking each adjective
to its lair, caging each intangible
concept. Ever since Plato opened
his philosophers' finishing school in
Athens, new students have let their
jaws droop while inspired orators
drove home the point that they, yes
they, would make up the Univer
isty in coming years.
But the delicate balance of influ
ences remains unexplained. No dis
section shows the misty relationship
between the outgoing and the in
coming.
Pre-registration gives us a glimpse
of the process.
* * *
It is all very inspiring, and doubt
less we would be better and finer
men if we could sit and meditate
upon it. But the program as an
nounced includes no time for medi
; tation.
I And so after this moment of si
-1 lence, we had best get back to our
i packing.—John Cobbs

We who have lounged in Stan
ford's lap for the last few years are
expected to tell the newcomers what
the University is. And yet the new

In some mystically vague way the
new will blend with the old, so that
Stanford will be different yet in
essence the same.
The various aspects of this para
dox have been explored in all their
bypaths. Carefully phrased speeches
have described the spirit of our
Alma Mater, tracking each adjective
to its lair, caging each intangible
concept. Ever since Plato opened
his philosophers' finishing school in
Athens, new students have let their
jaws droop while inspired orators
drove home the point that they, yes
they, would make up the Univer
isty in coming years.
But the delicate balance of influ
ences remains unexplained. No dis
section shows the misty relationship
between the outgoing and the in
coming.
Pre-registration gives us a glimpse
of the process.

It is customary, I believe, for the
Pre-reg edition to offer the incom
ing freshmen advice. It is expected
to play a grandfather to them, whis
pering of the glories that await in
this magic world where air-castles
are habitable, and golden dreams
assay 24 carats.
But by the time the freshman gets
to this corner of the page, he will
be an encyclopedia of advice about
Stanford. His father has already told
him to keep expenses down, and to
beware of designing women. His
mother has told him to keep his
feet dry and to sprint for the nose
spray if he begins to sniffle. His
brother has warned him for God's
sake not to call a fraternity a frat.
And the Frosh Bible has spoken like
a well-educated and tactful oracle
about the problems that will face
him.
