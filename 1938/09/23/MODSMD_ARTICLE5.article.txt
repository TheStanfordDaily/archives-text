# Administration Heads Welcome New Students
## Dr. Wilbur 
### 
Each year we take much ple< ure
in welcoming a new group of en
tering students to share our S bn
ford privileges and responsibil ies.
We love Stanford, and we hope hat
you who are coming to us this fall
will love Stanford, too. We are 1 )k
-ing forward eagerly to what
can give us, as well as to wha we
can give you. Just as no civiliz; ion
can long endure unless each ?n
-eration adds its share to the < m
mon store, so no university can f fic
tion as a living, vital institution in- !
less each student generation -ith
receptive and creative minds j ves
of its youth and enthusiasm uid
I high ideals. A university mus be
! more than a storehouse of ast
- knowledge. It must be a lighth jse
I for the future.
Remember that along with your j
' registration books you will get the |
Stanford brand, which will be with
■ you all the rest of your days. Dur- i
ing your student days wherever you |
go, and whatever you do, others will i
judge your actions not as yours but i
i ;is those of "a Stanford Student."!
'And in the years to come, even
| though you may have been here j
but a very short time, the newspa- ;
per reports of you, whether for good 1
or ill, from the day of your marriage
to the day of your death, will bear
the caption, "A Stanford Man" or;
"A Stanford Woman did this.
The branding iron of the Stanford
Farm is a good brand. There is
plenty of room here, good cleiyi air,
and wholesome activities. "The
Wind of Freedom Blows"—but that
doesn't, mean license. You can be
happy here without, being childish.
In our libraries, laboratories, church
and theater, and in your contacts
with professors, arc intellectual,
spiritual, and cultural riches which
arc yours for the taking. We arc
looking forward to having you here
with us.
