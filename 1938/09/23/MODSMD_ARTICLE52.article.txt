# Papoose Grid Hopes Boom
## Slipkey Hits Jackpot as Sixty Frosh Turn Out for '38 Squad 
### 
Stanford's Little Red Machine will go places this season if Frosh Mentor
Harry Shipkey tan keep the Papooses in good enough shape so that lie will
not have to dig too deep for reserves.
From high schools and prep schools all over the United States, CO year
ling hopefuls have gathered for practice, most of them with line grid
records. The hacks are of the light, fast variety, while the linemen are only
of average weight.
Outstanding man on the field is Frank Albert, small, light triple-threat
prospect hailing from Glcndalc with all-Southern California honors.
But there will be other good candidates in the fullback and quarterback
race. Jack Francis, all-city choice from San Francisco, is a good passer and
excellent line smasher, and does a line job at backing up the line. Art
Rasmusscn, brother of Neil, is one of the fastest men on the field and a
skilled passer and runner. Tom Doty, of Los Altos, shows promise as a
signal-barker.
Pete Kmetovic, hard, fast pounder from San Jose, leads the halfback race
by a large margin. He was all P.A.L. choice for three years, and also
claimed honors as a sprinter. John Sturgeon, candidate for the other half
spot, was Tulare High captain with all-county honors.
If other positions were as well-filled as the pivot spot, Shipkey's strong
est suit this year, lie could bid a grand slam and make it. liut since he has
an abundance of men in the same position, lie probably will shift some of

(hem. ,
Outstanding candidates for center'
are Colin McClintock of Seattle,
Winfred Jones of Okmulgee, Okla.,
and Douglas Stable of Oakland.
Each held all-city honors.
CRANE SHIFTED
Robert Crane, captain of the East
I3ay all-star DeMolay eleven and
fullback from Richmond, has been
shifted to guard, where he shines
for his speed. David Patterson, all
city selection from Portland, train
ing grounds for many Stanford ath
letes, is outstanding in the same
spot on Ihe other side of the line.
Francis Radditz, another Portland
boy with all-city rating for two
years, is the most promising tackle.
Lee DeWitt, from Sutter and no re
lation to the varsity center, will
probably hold down the other tackle
post.

letes, is outstanding in the same
spot on Ihe other side of the line.
Francis Radditz, another Portland
boy with all-city rating for two
years, is the most promising tackle.
Lee DeWitt, from Sutter and no re
lation to the varsity center, will
probably hold down the other tackle
post.
ENDS MOB COACHES
Coach Shipkey and End Coach
Grant Stone hit a jack-pot this year
in the usual mob of good ends. Burt
Talcott, with all-state rating from
Montana, Edgar Wilson, all-state
from Washington, Jim Murphy, all-
Southern California selection from
Los Angeles, Fred Meyer, of Okla
homa City, and Larry Partridge,
member of an unbeaten prep team
from North Carolina, are the most
promising flankmen.
Stanford's Little Red Machine will go places this season if Frosh Mentor
Harry Shipkey tan keep the Papooses in good enough shape so that lie will
not have to dig too deep for reserves.
From high schools and prep schools all over the United States, CO year
ling hopefuls have gathered for practice, most of them with line grid
records. The hacks are of the light, fast variety, while the linemen are only
of average weight.
Outstanding man on the field is Frank Albert, small, light triple-threat
prospect hailing from Glcndalc with all-Southern California honors.
But there will be other good candidates in the fullback and quarterback
race. Jack Francis, all-city choice from San Francisco, is a good passer and
excellent line smasher, and does a line job at backing up the line. Art
Rasmusscn, brother of Neil, is one of the fastest men on the field and a
skilled passer and runner. Tom Doty, of Los Altos, shows promise as a
signal-barker.
Pete Kmetovic, hard, fast pounder from San Jose, leads the halfback race
by a large margin. He was all P.A.L. choice for three years, and also
claimed honors as a sprinter. John Sturgeon, candidate for the other half
spot, was Tulare High captain with all-county honors.
If other positions were as well-filled as the pivot spot, Shipkey's strong
est suit this year, lie could bid a grand slam and make it. liut since he has
an abundance of men in the same position, lie probably will shift some of

Outstanding candidates for center'
are Colin McClintock of Seattle,
Winfred Jones of Okmulgee, Okla.,
and Douglas Stable of Oakland.
Each held all-city honors.
CRANE SHIFTED
Robert Crane, captain of the East
I3ay all-star DeMolay eleven and
fullback from Richmond, has been
shifted to guard, where he shines
for his speed. David Patterson, all
city selection from Portland, train
ing grounds for many Stanford ath
letes, is outstanding in the same
spot on Ihe other side of the line.
Francis Radditz, another Portland
boy with all-city rating for two
years, is the most promising tackle.
