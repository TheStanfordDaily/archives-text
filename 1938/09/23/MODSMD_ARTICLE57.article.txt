# New Basketball Coach Refuses To Worry--Yet
## 
### 
A new headman has come to the Farm to direct Stanford's basketball
destinies.
His name is Everett Dean, and he's from Indiana, the home of bas
ketball.
It's a tough job that this quiet, unassuming gentleman has. His task
is to mold a gang of new and inexperienced players into a winning outfit.

The Indian hoop quintet of 1938-<
39 has to start from scratch—no past i
performance to hang up on the wall
for all opponents to view with fear,
no single outstanding player to
groove the bucket with point after
point, and not any long odds marked
up to point them out as favorites.
But Everett Dean is not spending
his time moping around with a
frown on his face.
WON'T WORRY
The new Card coach is wearing
his well known jovial smile every
minute of every day. Worry, to
him, is non-existent until there's a
real reason for it.
So he's been talking with Dean of
Men John Bunn, former hoop men
tor, and Don Liebendorfer, pub
licity mentor, finding out everything
possible about the basketball situa
tion at Stanford and in the southern
division of the Pacific Coast Con
ference.
GOLDEN ERA GONE
Starting at home, the first obvious
fact which appears is this: John
Bunn's "Golden Era" has ended.
Gone is Hank Luisetti, the great
est basketball player of all time.
And gone also are the rest of the
"Laughing Boys" — Art Stoefen,
Jack Calderwood, and Beebs Lee.
That is, except one. He's Phil Zonne,
the only regular to return for an
other season of play. And Zoiine is
still recovering from an attack of
pneumonia which caused him to
drop from school last spring quar
ter.
LINE-UP
Helping out Zonne in the starting
quintet probably will be these
hoopsters: Derrol Huddleson at the
other forward spot, Don Burness at
center, and Dick Lyon and Bob
Burnett at guards.
The rest of the squad will include
Leon Lafaille, Ted Lyon, Gil Hahn.
Lew Staehle, Bob Oakford, Will An
derson, Harlan Copsey, Bill Schuette,
Bill Papp, Rill Leckie. Ken David
son. Don Williams, Mike Marshall.
