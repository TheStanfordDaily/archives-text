# New Basketball Coach Refuses To Worry--Yet
## 
### 
A new headman has come to the Farm to direct Stanford's basketball
destinies.
His name is Everett Dean, and he's from Indiana, the home of bas
ketball.
It's a tough job that this quiet, unassuming gentleman has. His task
is to mold a gang of new and inexperienced players into a winning outfit.

The Indian hoop quintet of 1938-<
39 has to start from scratch—no past i
performance to hang up on the wall
for all opponents to view with fear,
no single outstanding player to
groove the bucket with point after
point, and not any long odds marked
up to point them out as favorites.
But Everett Dean is not spending
his time moping around with a
frown on his face.
WON'T WORRY
The new Card coach is wearing
his well known jovial smile every
minute of every day. Worry, to
him, is non-existent until there's a
real reason for it.
So he's been talking with Dean of
Men John Bunn, former hoop men
tor, and Don Liebendorfer, pub
licity mentor, finding out everything
possible about the basketball situa
tion at Stanford and in the southern
division of the Pacific Coast Con
ference.
GOLDEN ERA GONE
Starting at home, the first obvious
fact which appears is this: John
Bunn's "Golden Era" has ended.
Gone is Hank Luisetti, the great
est basketball player of all time.
And gone also are the rest of the
"Laughing Boys" — Art Stoefen,
Jack Calderwood, and Beebs Lee.
That is, except one. He's Phil Zonne,
the only regular to return for an
other season of play. And Zoiine is
still recovering from an attack of
pneumonia which caused him to
drop from school last spring quar
ter.
LINE-UP
Helping out Zonne in the starting
quintet probably will be these
hoopsters: Derrol Huddleson at the
other forward spot, Don Burness at
center, and Dick Lyon and Bob
Burnett at guards.
The rest of the squad will include
Leon Lafaille, Ted Lyon, Gil Hahn.
Lew Staehle, Bob Oakford, Will An
derson, Harlan Copsey, Bill Schuette,
Bill Papp, Rill Leckie. Ken David
son. Don Williams, Mike Marshall.
Bill Niccolls, and Bill Masters.
But this imposing squad which is
to be in the hands of Everett Dean
is rated no higher than a dark horse.
U.S.C.'s battering Trojans have once
more gathered a potent clan, which
appears to have the stuff necessary
to come out on top of the heap. Cal
will have, most likely, a team simi
lar to last season's outfit, as will
U.C.L.A.
Stanford's new coach is as famous
for his baseball as for his basket
ball. His record is as follows:
He was graduated from Indiana in
1921 after hanging up, with his uni
form, a glorious athletic record.
Many of the aged bleacher boys have

referred to him as the "greatest
baseball player ever to wear an In
diana uniform."
Turning down several big league
baseball offers to follow the coach
ing profession, Dean went to Carle
ton College, Northfield, Minn.,
where he took over baseball and
basketball. During his first two
years at Carleton, both teams placed
second in the conference, each win
ning championships in 1924, the fol
lowing year.
In the fall of 1924 Dean returned
to his alma mater as coach. His
first basketball team took second
place in the Big Ten and his ini
tial diamond squad copped the con
fei'ence flag.
