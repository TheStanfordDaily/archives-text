We're not sitting this one out, .
Stanford's Big Red Machine for
1938 is going to be bigger and bet
ter than any since the days of the
Vowing Sophs and in many ways
will even surpass the team that fol
lowed a series of conference victo
ries to the Rose Bowl three years
in a row.
The passing attack of this year's
Good Ship Stanford is going to make
the Vowing Sophs and a few ves
sels on the conference sea look like
submarines beside an airplane car
rier. Not only will the 1938 varsity
have a better passing attack than
the famous New Year's Day favo
rites, but the backfield as a whole
will be bigger, faster, and more
versatile.
Every team on the Coast is going
to be better than it was last year.
But Stanford is going to be just
about two touchdowns better of
fensively and one touchdown better
defensively than it was, and it was
runner-up in the 1937 conference. !
If that is enough to give the Indians |
an edge over an excellent bunch of
Washington sophomores and a fine 1
group of Southern California vet
erans, the Rose Bowl goal-posts will
be painted red.
When Assistant Coach Ben Win- ;
kelman says the boys will be "hit
ting with a shock instead of a push." <
he is describing the fire of spirit and j
enthusiasm that is raging violently
on the Indian practice gridiron. The |
players arc taking their work more !
seriously than ever and really want
to play ball as they never have be
fore. They have reached a peak
mentally.
It takes more than a backfield to
make a football team, but it is go
ing to help a lot this fall to have
four men back there who can put
on a running, passing, and kicking
show that will make P. T. Barnum
turn over in his grave. And star !
backfields on the Big Red Machine j
are deeper than just one layer of i
reserves. Norm Standlee, sophomore !
fullback, is the greatest thing since
—well, it's not safe to say until he
has a chance to perform in a varsity
game. But he was sensational as a
frosh and looks fine in varsity prac
tice sessions. When he carries the
ball, he packs a lot of weight that
cannot be stopped until it is first
slowed down. And he is a blocker
and passer of no mean ability.
When Peter Fay Rets on the scales,
the 200-pound counter-weight has
to l>e removed. Peter weighs about f
174, but he is hard to stop because

he is one of the fastest and shiftiest
backs to grace the Farm gridiron in
many a year. And he can kick and
pass, too.
Bill Paulman will continue to be
the man of the hour when he starts
to toss the pill all over the field with
unexcelled speed and accuracy. And
when it comes to kicking field goals
and conversions, he cannot be beat.
Hampton Pool will be opposite Fay
in the other half spot, and he'll
pack his 212 pounds with amazing
speed.
Moreover, he is the best pass re
ceiver on the team.
There isn't room to give all the
fine backs full credit here, but it
must, be remembered that Glenn
Hamilton can still pass, Fred Ledc
boer can still run, Billy Kirsch can
still tackle, and Gene Coldiron has
not forgotten how to block and back
up a line. And with a couple of
good south-paw passers like John
Casey and Hugh Gallerneau to go in
when right handed passing gets bor
ing, Stanford's aerial attack will be
better than ever.
Don't worry about the Cardinal
line — until it has to be replaced.
First-stringers on the line can hold
their own in anybody's ball club,
but the reserves are not very deep.
Tony Calvelli still stands out as
one of the finest pivot men in the
country, and Wally DeWitt has
made a startling come-back to make
himself capable of handling the cen
ter post when Calvelli is not able to
hold out for (>0 minutes. Chct Pat
ton and Jake Thompson are equally
good center replacements, and Lew
Yank, transfer from Chaffey Junior
College, may pan out for the spot.
Guards are still a problem, but
not so big a one as some would have
us think. Bob Dakan and Dick Sut
ton are both good men, although
they are not always at a peak. How
ever, there was not a better lineman
on the field last year than Dakan in
the U.C.L.A. game or Sutton in the
Columbia game. By West and
Corky Donahue have both been
taught the guard tactics, which have
been changed slightly so that a
man can go in at guard or tackle
without needing too much orienta
tion.
• So it looks as though Tiny will
keep his eleven best men on the
field, be sure of good guards, and
still have reserves in the tackle
posts. Then there are Chick Orme,
Frank McMillan, John Kerman, Bill
Braheny, Roy Adamson, Paul Ug
rin, and others who show consider
able promise. Swede Johannessen,
tackle from last year's frosh, is also
being tried at guard.
Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen
still hold their own as excellent
tackles, and West and Donahue are
running them a close race. Johan
nessen is still a good tackle, while
three other sophomores, Claude
Purkit, Don Schultz, and Carl War
necke, and three veterans, Jim Sad
ler, Jim Kremer, and Bob Young,
remain good prospects.
Stanford ends are usually good,
and this year is no exception. Jack
Clax-k, one of the country's best two
years ago, returns to hold down one
wing, while Bill McElroy looks fine
on the other side. Bill Willard and
Andy Stojkovich are close behind,
and Bill Greer, Howard Hicking
botham, Stan Graff, and Art Mein
ers can all catch a pass.
And there will be plenty of pass
es to catch.
