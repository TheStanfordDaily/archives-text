# Stojkovich Announces Fall Intramural Play
## 
### 
Andy Stojkovich has moved in on his duties as intramural manager,
lie's found out which keys lit what drawers in his desk, lie's lined leagues
and schedules, and now lie's waiting for the Farm's 3500 Houghs (o
organize their teams for the touch-foothall competition.
"Intramural—sport for the fun of it," is the slogan which Stojkovich
will use to greet the returning Farmers next week.

+ Anyone can organize a team, six
men to a team. Games are made up
of two periods, 20 minutes to a pe
riod with five minutes rest in be
tween. Passers can throw from any
place behind the line of scrimmage,
and the team may throw as many
passes as it wishes without penalty.
Those are the chief rules.
Teams are organized into leagues
made up as much as possible of
squads of equal ability. Besides
football, the fall program includes
golf, horseshoes, and volley ball.
Twelve events are offered all to
gether during the whole year—
enough variety to give everyone a
chance at something. Fifty-six
groups and 1280 men participated
last year.
Points won in each of the 12 com
petitions are kept track of by the
intramural manager, the group with
the largest total points at the end of
the year receiving the Intramural
All-Year Championship Trophy.
Complete rules regarding intra
murals may be found in the Sports
Announcement book 1 ct.
