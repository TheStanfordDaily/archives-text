# Allison Releases Annual Grid Gripe
## 
### 
Coach Stub Allison spent a lot of j
time last, year saying "We haven't a i
chance." But, despite his moaning, [
California's powerful Bears did all
right, moving into a Rose Bowl win
after taking the Coast crown.
But this season, Stub has a right I
to gripe, and he's likely to be very j
close to correct.
Gone far. far away from Coast \
grid wars is the powerhouse block- :
ing combination that kept Cal in
high gear. The Bear mentor, to be
sure, has the elusive Vic Bottari to
spark his eleven, but Bottari hasn't
the steamroller he had last year to
pave his way. All of which justifies
any gripe which may be released for
publication by Mr. Allison.
