# Card Gridders Best Since 'Vow Boys'
## Indians To Open Season Against Bronco Eleven Betting Odds Place Farm Squad Underdogs against Santa Clarans 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Stanford's Big Red Machine, ihe biggest, fastest, and most spirited since
the Vowing Sophomores, is ready to go.
And the boys will try to pick up the Santa Clara opener on October 1
where they left oil in the last few minutes of the same game last year.
After nearly an hour of distinctly inferior playing, the Indians turned
the tables on the Broncos, gained 100 yards, a touchdown, and a conver
sion just before the final gun left them losers, 13-7.
Not since the Vowing Sophs have the Cardinals been able to stop
Buck Shaws boys, but they really have what it takes this time. And
although Bronco fans are giving two to one on the game, it looks aa
though they might have to pay double.
While the Stanford combination has improved offensively and de
fensively Santa Clara will bring to Palo Alto a team that is no better
and possibly worse than last year.
It is true that the 1938 Bronco first string will be belter than last year's
firsts, but the seconds will be distinctly worse. Coach Shaw has always
lavoied the two-unit system, in which two whole teams alternate each
quarter. He has always had 22 good men to do this, but now he has
only 11. He I probably try ihe same system ,but it obviously will not
work so well.
The Broncos, with a line averaging 204 pounds and a baekfiekl of IK')
are heavier all around than the Indians. And will, all their weight thev
are still capable of the speedy, heads-up ball that has made them one of
the best teams in the country.
Stanford's first scrimmage showed that the Cards are fast in back
and slow out iront, one of many weak spots that arc bound to appear
in any first scrimmage The line was slower than it will be when
things get started, but the backfield moved like lightning
While the linemen were a little slow pulling out, they showed power
that has been missing in Stanford lines for several years.
Although passes were not completed as often as fans are hoping they
will be, there was evidence of skillful handling of the ball in the back-

â–ºneia. ihere can be little doubt but
that Stanford will put on a real
passing show when October 1 conies
around.
SHY IN CENTER
i.he Broncos arc shy a good re
serve center, but Shiechl, first
stringer in the pivot post, is tops.
The fullback spot will be Santa
j Clara's weakest. Shaw has myste
| liously lost two good ones, and will
have a hard time replacing them.
Although Stringari started out on
a second-string flank, it is no secret
that ho is a sensational end and will
complete a good pair with Anahu,
Santa Clara's Hawaiian importation.
Biggest weakness in the Bronco
set-up is in kicking. Jim Johnson, a
sophomore, is an exceptional kicker
and a good passer, but he has not
proved himself in any other de
partment.
SHAW TROUBLED
So one of Shaw's greatest prob
lems will be how to make a good
back out of a good kicker or a good
kicker out of a good back.
They are still giving two to one
down in Bronco-land, and many
sports writers are giving Santa
Clara 20 points. But Coach Shaw
says it will be a miracle if he de
feats Stanford again.
It will be a hard game for both
teams. Each is counting on the
opening contest to bring victory and
confidence to start out a successful
season.
