"The greatest addition to Univer
sity library facilities in a decade."
This was the way Nathan Van Pat
ten, director of university libraries,
described the new 150,000-volume
Education reading room.
Part of the new Cubberly Build
ing, the library will house special
ized educational works, will be
staffed by librarians from the main
unit, and will have the same open
ing and closing hours.
Van Patten announced that the
special " 1 ibe sub-station" for re
served books at the Union cigar
counter will be maintained this year.
Instituted last spring for the con
venience of students who, because
of the location of early morning
classes, have difficulty in coming to
the library to turn in overnight
books, the "little libe" will be con
tinued as long as its regulations are
lulfillcd.
To clarify details of the system,
Van Patten stated:
"It should be kept in mind that
only one collection will be made
each day, and that books turned in
after 8 o'clock on week days and 2
o'clock on Sundays will not be col
the usual fines will accrue.
"Only reserve books will be han
dled: other books withdrawn from
the Stanford Library are not to be
i returned to the Stanford Union
| Store," he said.
Though it will necessitate the
gelded expenditure of $1100 to $500
annually, the library will again con
tinue to keep the Pieserve Book
i room open on Sunday nights for the
convenience of students. Van Patten
j disclosed.
i Addition of new books to the li-

brary stacks during summer quar- j
ter totaled nearly 6500 volumes, it ;
was learned. All facilities will be |
ready to serve students when classes
are resumed. Library hours will re
main the same as last year, Van
Patten said.
Current exhibit in the library mez
zanine features gifts and insignia
presented Herbert Hoover in recog
nition of his leadership in American
relief and reconstruction work in j
Europe during and after the World |
War.
The majority of the articles were
received on his recent trip, which he
described as a "sentimental jour
ney" to the countries in which the
widespread activities of the Com
mission for Relief in Belgium and
the American Relief Administration
j were carried on.
