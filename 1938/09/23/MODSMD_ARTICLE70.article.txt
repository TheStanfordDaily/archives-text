# Veteran Water Poloists Return To Swell Squad
## Thornton Aims For League Pennant Win 
### 
Pinning his hopes on a "veteran"
team this year, Water Polo Coach
Nort Thornton is counting on his
boys to wipe out the blemish of last
year's tie and end up again
at the tup of the league they led for
22 years.
"Lack of experience was against
us last year," Thornton said. "We
lost a lot of tough games which
might have been different if we had
had more than two returning let
termen on the team."
Always optimistic, Coach Thorn
ton is even more so this year. "Last
year's boys are vets now, and the
varsity possesses a real spirit to win.
Right now we have high hopes of
winning the Coast League pennant."
LAMB LEADS
Bulwark of the team will be Cap
tain Johnny Lamb, for two years
all-conference forward, who spent
the summer swimming, among a few
other things, at Catalina Island.
Fast and tricky, Lamb stays down
around the cage to snap the ball in
for scores when his mates shoot it
to him. Lamb will have these men
feeding the ball to him:
Jack Loupe, left forward.
Harv Rothschild or Bob Plate,
center forward.
Bob Plate or Harv Rothschild,
center back.
Dick Hoover, right guard.
Ted Moreno, Bruce Jessup, or Bill
Hatch, left guard.
Roy Vitousek or Lloyd Wilson,
goalie.
PRAISES VITOUSEK
Thornton considers Roy Vitousek
one of the "finest all-around swim
mers Stanford or the Pacific Coast
has ever seen. Last year as a frosh
he was the best frosh goalie ever to
hit the campus."
Dick Hoover, brother of the '36
captain, Bob Hoover, should be one
of the strongest men on the team,
judging by his sophomore year per
formance at right guard.
SOPHS COMPETE
Competition will be close at the
left guard spot, according to Thorn
ton, but Moreno, a sophomore,
showed considerable promise dur
ing spring practice.
Well grounded in fundamentals,
Weeden, Nottage, and Jamieson,
coming up from the frosh squad,
will be counted on to add materially
to the strength of the '38 version of
water polo, a la Stanford.
"Competition will be plenty tight
this year," Thornton says, "but
we're counting on getting back up
where we should be."

Dick Hoover, right guard.
Ted Moreno, Bruce Jessup, or Bill
Hatch, left guard.
Roy Vitousek or Lloyd Wilson,
goalie.
PRAISES VITOUSEK
Thornton considers Roy Vitousek
one of the "finest all-around swim
mers Stanford or the Pacific Coast
has ever seen. Last year as a frosh
he was the best frosh goalie ever to
hit the campus."
Dick Hoover, brother of the '36
captain, Bob Hoover, should be one
of the strongest men on the team,
judging by his sophomore year per
formance at right guard.
SOPHS COMPETE
Competition will be close at the
left guard spot, according to Thorn
ton, but Moreno, a sophomore,
showed considerable promise dur
ing spring practice.
Well grounded in fundamentals,
Weeden, Nottage, and Jamieson,
coming up from the frosh squad,
will be counted on to add materially
to the strength of the '38 version of
water polo, a la Stanford.
"Competition will be plenty tight
this year," Thornton says, "but
we're counting on getting back up
where we should be."
Pinning his hopes on a "veteran"
team this year, Water Polo Coach
Nort Thornton is counting on his
boys to wipe out the blemish of last
year's tie and end up again
at the tup of the league they led for
22 years.
"Lack of experience was against
us last year," Thornton said. "We
lost a lot of tough games which
might have been different if we had
had more than two returning let
termen on the team."
Always optimistic, Coach Thorn
ton is even more so this year. "Last
year's boys are vets now, and the
varsity possesses a real spirit to win.
Right now we have high hopes of
winning the Coast League pennant."
LAMB LEADS
Bulwark of the team will be Cap
tain Johnny Lamb, for two years
all-conference forward, who spent
the summer swimming, among a few
other things, at Catalina Island.
Fast and tricky, Lamb stays down
around the cage to snap the ball in
for scores when his mates shoot it
to him. Lamb will have these men
feeding the ball to him:
Jack Loupe, left forward.
Harv Rothschild or Bob Plate,
center forward.
Bob Plate or Harv Rothschild,
center back.
Dick Hoover, right guard.
Ted Moreno, Bruce Jessup, or Bill
Hatch, left guard.
Roy Vitousek or Lloyd Wilson,
goalie.
