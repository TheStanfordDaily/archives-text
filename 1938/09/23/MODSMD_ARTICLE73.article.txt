Eugene, Ore., according to all signs
and flags released by the official
weatherman and publicity agent of
the University of Oregon.
Tex Oliver, new coach of the
Webfeet, comes from Arizona,
where he molded potent grid ma
chines. In addition to a new coach,
the Oregonians have 20 returning
lettermen and a promising group of
to make up their 1938

Only gloomy element is the ab
sence of Paul Rowe, last season's
sensational sophomore fullback.
Rowe is now playing semi-pro rugby
