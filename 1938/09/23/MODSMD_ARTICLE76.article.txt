# Graduation Takes Coast Pivot Men
## 
### 
Centers are at a premium on the
Coast this year, following the grad
uation of a series of good ones. No
table pivot loss of the year is the
one that is giving Bear Coach Stub
Allison more gray hairs daily. He
lost a trio of outstanding pivot men
in Herwig, Stockton, and Evans, all
of whom graduated at Berkeley last
June.
Tiny Thornhill lost Louis Tsout
souvas, but is left with an equally
good man in Tony Calvelli. And
the showing Wally DeWitt made in
the first Stanford scrimmage made
Tiny sit back in his chair with a sigh
of relief.
Buck Shaw, Santa Clara mentor,
has lost Dougherty, one of the finest
on the Coast last year. Schiechl
moves into the center shoes at 220
pounds, but he will have to play GO
minutes to keep Shaw happy.
"We're going to pass early and
often—if I have to send in the
waterboy to call signals," intimated
U.C.LA.'s Bill Spaulding. No won
der—he has Kenny Washington and
Woody Strode as a passing combi
nation, one of the best in the coun
try.
