## 
### 
Placing well ahead of their for
eign competition, Stanford track
men barnstormed Sweden and other
European countries as members of
the American track team during the
summer, after taking a second in the
American NC2A meet and winning
several firsts in the A.A.U. meet
earlier in the season.
Ray Malott, Pete Zagar, and Stan
Andersen scored enough points in
the NC2A meet to bring Stanford
the second place honors. A large
University of Southern California
aggregation won the meet.

, Malott ran the 440-yard run in
| 4G.8 seconds, and took a second in
the 220.
Zagar successfully defended "the
! title he won last year of national
champ in the discus throw with a
IG2-foot toss. Stan Anderson put
the shot 50 feet 5% inches for a
fifth place.
At the A.A.U. meet, Malott won
the 400 meters in 47.7, and Zagar
i took first with a discus throw of
IG7 feet 3% inches. They were then
I selected to compete for the Ameri
| can track team against Sweden.

At Stockholm, Malott broke two
Swedish records with a 47.8 in the
400 meters and a 33.4 in the 1500-
meter run. The latter was within
1/5 second of Charley Pallock's
world record in the event.
Malott broke a world's record in
the 500 meters at Gothenburg,
Sweden. He ran it in 1:01.5, clip
ping half a second from the record
of 1:02.4, held by Ben Eastman since
1934.
Zagar was out of form in Europe.

all Swedish records many times in
practice, he could not seem to get it
out there under competition.
Zagar amazed the world with his
fine work in the track events, al
though he weighs 220 pounds and is
not a cinder enthusiast. He is one
of the fastest men on the Stanford
football team, but was not expected
to do well enough to star in a track
suit.
He ran the relay with Ben John
son of Columbia University, Fred
die Wolcott of Rice Institute, and
Malott. They ran nearly a dozen
times in Europe and won the event
each time.
