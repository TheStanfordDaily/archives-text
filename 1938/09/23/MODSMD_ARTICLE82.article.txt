# U.S.C. Coach Sees Blue Skies Ahead
## 
### 
Headman Howard Jones of U. S.
C.'s Trojans is once more looking
down Easy Street, from which he
was detoured 'way back in 191)4.
The Thundering Herd of old ap
pears to have come, back, and
Southern California fans are getting
ready to "watch the Trojans roll"â€”
it's the heaviest and best-balanced
aggregation to play for Jones in four
years.
There's just one ray of happiness
for Troy's opponents, and that's
only a possibility. Amby Sehindler,
powerful back, may not be able to
play until mid-season. His knee op
eration hasn't healed sufficiently, ac
cording to the team medicos.
