# Andersen Pulls Strongarm Act
## 
### 
The city of Palo Alto has a claim
against Stan Andersen, first-string
Indian tackle.
It seems that Andersen, who
weighs a mere 205, worked in a
utilities crew for the city this sum
mer. His first day out, Stan broke
the handles of two sledge hammers.
And Jie wasn't leaning on them,
either.
