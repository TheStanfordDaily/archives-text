As a tackle, Stan Andersen has
already registered as one of the
Coast's best, but it wasn't until this

The big lineman had two letters

football teams is lost, it is because
the student bodies are apathetic.
But, spiritless as the stands some
times are, felt Anderson, the old
time vim and "will to win" is not
lacking on this year's varsity grid
team.
