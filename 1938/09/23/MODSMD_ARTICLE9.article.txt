### 
May I extend to the freshmen and
to the other students, both old and
new, my hearty good wishes for a
happy and successful year.
For many of you it will be your
first experience away from home.
Take this opportunity to know your
self better; to take stock of both
your abilities and your limitations.
Trust your abilities; recognize and
allow for your limitations; expand
your interests. Stanford is a friend
ly place, and in this adventure of
self-development you will have the
understanding help of the students,
the faculty, and the members of the
administration. They in their turn
need your help. Your interest and
keenness of mind, your conscien
tious study of the material given
you will make it possible for your
teachers to have alive and stimulat
ing classes. Your co-operation with
the various student groups, your
consideration of fellow students,
your scrupulous following of the
| Honor Code, will increase the efTec
jtivcness of student government and
I the happiness of your fellow stu
' dents.
To each of you a warm welcome.
J If I or anyone on my staff can be of
assistance to you, do not hesitate to
come to us.
