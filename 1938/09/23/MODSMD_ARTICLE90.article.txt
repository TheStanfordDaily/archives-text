# Indian Swim Coach Looks Titleward
## 
### 
From here it looks like Coach Nort Thornton is going to take his boys
through to a third consecutive Coast League swimming championship.
It's a little early for predictions, of course, hut only five of last year's
all-victorious team have been lost, leaving most of the old bunch, and
the best frosh swimming team ever to hit the Farm moves up to the
varsity league to help them out. ♦ — —

Captaining the team will be Win
Needham, Coast League 220 de
fending champion and All-American
in the 440. Needham was beaten in
the 220 by last year's Captain Dave
Ryder, but the title of defending
220 champion falls to him.
WINKELMANN BACK
Another conference champ, Roy
Winkelmann, will be back to pick up
a few points here and there with his
diving. Winkelmann was undefeated
during Coast League competition
last year and is rated fourth among
the country's divers.
Sprinters Dick Clarke, John
Brahtz, and Pete Jones will be back
to swim in the quick and short ones.
All three were hot as foxes last
year. Along with the whitest of a
flock of sophomore white hopes—
Roy Vitousek—these three will make
up the '38 relay team. Breaststroke
swimmer from last year's bunch will
be Bill Hatch.
LETTERMEN LOST
The five lettermen lost are Captain
Dave Rider, Jack Vibert, Mason Let
teau, Bill Tench, and Don Towne.
But the boys from last year's
frosh are really the kids to watch.
From that squad, which went
through its entire schedule unde
feated, most outstanding is the
aforementioned Roy Vitousek, who
Thornton says is one of the greatest
swimmers ever to come to the Farm.
He broke five frosh marks last
year and one national freshman
mark. He swims breaststroke and
freestyle, and is slated for the relay
team.
STAR BACKSTROKER
Then there's Bill Weeden. To use
Nort's own words, "He backstrokes
like nobody's business." Weeden
swam 5.7 seconds faster last year
than the Indian varsity, and faster
than any coast record.
Another of the boys is Charles
Wiper. When he and Weeden and
Vitousek went back east for the na
tional swim meet this summer, they
swamp the 300-yard sprint in 3:9.9—
establishing a national record, beat
ing the old record held by Yale for
a number of years. Their relay team
was faster back in the national
than any varsity relay team on the
Coast.
Yes, it looks like Nort Thornton,
tHe optimist, has something to be
optimistic about this time. He's got
a swimming team.
