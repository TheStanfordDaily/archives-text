# Champ Diver To Enter Farm
## A.A.U. Titleholder To Dive for Frosh 
### 
"The best diver in the West," to
quote Nort Thornton, is Howard
Adams, who will sit on the steps of
the Administration Building next
Monday for the first time and fill
out his registration book.
At long last Stanford gets another
diver to take the jumps along with
the Farm's stand-by for the last
three years, the talented Roy Win
kleman—and Adams is better even
than Winklemann.
Winkleman went through the
Coast Conference last year unde
feated, but he came up against Ad
ams in the Junior National meet and
his season's victory record was
broken. Adams won by five points
and went on to win the Far West
A.A.U. meet on August 24.
It is unpredictable what heights
Adams will reach before he's
through with diving, but his future
is full of potentiality. His success so
far has been phenomenal—he has
been diving but one year! He comes
from Richmond High.
Another swimmer coming to the
Farm for the first time this year is
Scott Dudley from Los Angeles
High. Dudley is a state record hold
er and on the ail-American high
school swimming team.
