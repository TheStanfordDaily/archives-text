# Pool Goes Hogwild On Losing Weight
## 
### 
When a football player wants to
cut down his weight, he is content,
usually, with a loss of 4 or 10 pounds,
which is a pretty good slice, any
way you look at it.
But Hampton Pool, Card halfback,
doesnt' believe in such tomfoolery.
Last year, the former Cal freshman
gridder packed the pigskin along
with 235 pounds.
When he reported for practice this
year, Pool had withered away to a
mere 199.
