six fifty-cent tickets, the books cost
two dollars, are transferable, and
may be used in any combination
desired. Sale will continue in front
of the Administration Building to
day, and henceforth in Room 202,

SIX PLAYS SCHEDULED
Six productions are tentatively
scheduled for the Division season,
some to be produced in Memorial
Hall, some in the Little Theater.
Plays have not been chosen defi
nitely from a list of possibilities,
Acting Director of Dramatics Thomas
Woods Stevens reported yesterday.
Final choices will be made after
registration when some indication
of casting potentialities has been
obtained, he said.
BOOKS ON SALE
Marking a far step from past years
when seats have been priced ac
cording to location, the Division's
new uniform price policy is ex
pected to swell attendance at pro
ductions, make longer runs possible.
Scrip books may be purchased by
faculty, students, and general pub
lic. Any number of books may be
bought at one time. Single tickets
will also be on sale before each pro
duction.
Division Secretary C. W. Barker
emphasized the fact that the scrip
books are only applicable to Divi
sion of Speech and Drama plays,
and not to Stagers' or other stu
dent productions. Further infor
mation may be obtained from him
in Room 202, Memorial Hall, or by
calling P.A. 22041.
According to Mr. Barker, the divi
sion probably will produce one
Shakespearean play. Selection of
dramas will be made, he explained,
only after the division has discov
ered the aptitudes of this year's
students.
