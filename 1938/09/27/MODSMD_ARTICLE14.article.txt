# Bunn Says, 'Destroy Property; Out You Go'
## 
### 
Warning the freshmen their $10 breakage deposit is no license to
wreck their dormitory, Dean John Bunn Friday night inaugurated a
policy stricter than that followed in past years.
"Any student who destroys University properly from (his moment on,"
he told the assembled Encinaus, "will have his registration cancelled

â€¢immediately.
"A student who is dismissed," he
continued, "cannot come back until
he can convince me of his ability to
be a good citizen."
Hitting at the tradition of peren
nial destruction in the mammoth
dormitory, Dean Bunn told the
freshmen it is possible for a fresh
man class to receive at the end of
the year every penny of its break
age deposit.

REFUND SMALL

111, FOR BREAKAGE ONLY

FEE NOT LICENSE

In past years, gradually increas
ing damage has reduced this refund
to two or three dollars of the ten
dollars required of each inmate.
Most of last year's damage arose
from only two incidents, Mr. Bunn
explained. At Big Game time SBOO
worth of ballusters were pulled out
along the stairways, and $3200 in re
pairs was necessary after a student
maliciously had left water running
on the fourth floor.
Convinced that individual instead
of group responsibility is the key to
the problem, the dean said a student
found guilty of such an offense
should be forced to pay repair costs.

Widespread misunderstanding has
surrounded the use to which the
Encina breakage fee is put. Ac
cording to Acting Comptroller J.
Hugh Jackson, the fund is used to
pay only for repairs aside from ordi
nary deterioration.

The dean recognized the likeli
hood that payment of the fee bo
considered license to wreck the
place.
"Frankly, I am not sure the $10
deposit is a good thing." he said.
The matter should be on a definite
individual basis."
