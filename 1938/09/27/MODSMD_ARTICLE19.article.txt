# Frosh Complete Pre-Reg Period
## Class of '42 'Stanfordized' During Three-Day Orientation Program 
### 
As the rest of the Farm's 4000 hegan to arrive, the class of '42 \esterday
had completed its* pre-regist ration program of orientation.
Chairman Lylc Cook last night attributed success of the harherne,
jolly-up. campus tours, and other events to hard work on the part of his
various assistants.
One high point of the program was the jolly-up Saturday night, (o
which only freshmen were admitted. Selected uppcrclassmcn and spon-

sors aided in getting the freshmen
mutually acquainted.

KILEEFER APPROVES

Asked what he thought of the
class, Tom Killefer, student man
ager, said, "It looks like a good
year."
Climaxing Ihe week-end's sched
ule was the traditional frosh barbe
cue, held late Sunday afternoon on
Stanford Hill south of the Cfunpus.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, ad
dressing the new class for the first
time, extended "a hearty welcome
from the Stanford family."

TENACITY URGED

We hope, he added, "you will
have not only tenacity but adhesive?
quality, and will stick here for four
years."
After telling the freshmen about
the founding of Stanford University
and the laying-out of the Campus,
President Wilbur gave them a word
of warning.
"In spite of Stanford's many good
features," he said, "one is likely to
get atrophy of the lower extremi
ties.

WALKING BEST

"The auto is all right, but the
finest thing in the world is to take
a walk on the Stanford Campus and
into the Stanford hills.
When the President began to
speak, he found the microphone too
short for his 6 feet 3. "Will you
raise this?" he asked. "It's still
boys' size." There was a ripple of
laughter.

RECORD TIME FOR MEAL

A sidelight was the speed with
which the meal was served. Ac
cording to Mrs. Dorothy Bell, man
ager of Encina Commons, whoso
crew prepared and served the meal,
750 helpings were distributed in 12
minutes. Last year, the same task
took approximately 20 minutes.
