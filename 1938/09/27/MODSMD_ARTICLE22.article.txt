# Barclay Discusses Roosevelt Purge
## 
### 
"I do not believe that the failure of the so-called 'purge' will have any
very significant results, so far as the next session of Congress is concerned.
The greater portion of the Administration's program has already been
enacted into law, and nothing is to be gained by a continuation of inter
party quarrels."
This, believes Professor Thomas S. Barclay of the Political Science
Department, will make unlikely any reprisals upon President Koosevelt
by disgruntled senators who survived his almost unprecedented attempt

to cleanse the Congress of its "con- 4
servative" elements. It will also, he I
believes, make unlikely any attempt
to wrest control of the next Demo
cratic presidential convention from
Mr. Roosevelt's hands.
"Roosevelt remains the key figure in
the 1940 situation," he says, "and it
does not seem possible that any
candidate can be named without his
approval."

LOGICAL OUTCOME

PRESIDENTS UNIFY

Commenting on the purge itself,
Professor Barclay gave it as his
opinion that it is a logical outcome
of the party system.
"The American party system no
where makes provision for definite
party leadership. Our major parties
have no inherent unity, being mere
aggregations held together primarily
for the purpose of capturing the
Presidency. This means that na
tional leadership must be supplied
by the President, giving him a diffi
cult, dual role, and adding great
responsibility to his office.

"Presidents of both parties have
attempted to unify their party
groups about a coherent body of
principles, but not with lasting suc
cess. Powerful and magnetic lead
ers like Wilson and Theodore Roo
sevelt have been able to impose their
will and their program on their
parties, beat down opposition, and
succeed â€” for a short time. Fifty
years ago Lord Bryce indicated that
Presidents come and go but Con
gress goes on forever. New problems
and a new President are never far
distant.
"The present situation in the Dem
ocratic party demonstrates the prac
tical difficulties of party reorgani
zation under our form of government
and under our political traditions.
Even the enormous power and pres
tige attached to his office have not
been sufficient for President Roose
velt to defeat well-intrenched and
popular candidates in several states,
and to refashion the Democratic
party along liberal lines."
