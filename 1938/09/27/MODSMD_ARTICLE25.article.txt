a name to the Farm, but to Dean

thinks the Daily might help him
solve.

ian, of no aggravated vices or vir
tues," Sutcliffe has written the Dean

sports, actively engaging in tennis,
golf, lacrosse, Australian Rules foot
ball, and swimming"; is "passion
ately fond of sailing and flying"; has
"a weakness for hot swing records
and American magazines.. .and, in
fact, can show interest in practically
everything except stamp collecting."
His foremost ambition is to visit the
United States, a nation whose prog
ress is "an inspiration to urge Aus
tralia forward."
He lives at 18 Tiernan Street,
Footscray W 11, Melbourne, Victoria,
