## 
### 
BERLIN, Sept. 26 (UP).â€”Reichs
fuehrer Adolf Hitler tonight told the
world the hour has come for Czecho
slovakia to choose between peace
and war and the Sudetenland must
be surrendered to him by Saturday
or his armies will take it by force.
President Eduard Benes of Cze
choslovakia must make the decision
between dismemberment and inva
sion within five days, he said.
"Either President Benes gives the
Sudeten Germans their freedom or
we shall take this freedom," Der
Fuehrer shouted to thousands of
Nazi stalwarts jamming the Sports
Palace.
The dictator stressed he did not
believe either Britain or France
would come to Czechoslovakia's aid
with armed force.
Throughout his speech, delivered
against the backdrop of a huge ban
ner proclaiming "Our Holy Nation Is
Germany," Hitler repeated over and
over he has struggled to preserve
peace but Czech "terrorism" has
brought his patience to an end.
Late summer, when the cover
crop is seeded, is the best time to
apply lime on land that needs it for
growing vegetables.
