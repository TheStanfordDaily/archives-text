# Women Meet To Discuss Year's Work
## Dean Yost Speaks On Importance Of Academic Work 
### 
To review problems facing new
and returning women at Stanford
and to plan activities for the com
ing year, Women's Conference met
Saturday morning to start off the
quarter.
First speaker was Dean Mary
Yost, who discussed the importance
of helping new and old women to
get the most from both their aca
demic and nonacademic life at
Stanford.

TWO CURRICULA'

ESSENTIAL STUDY HABITS

WOMEN TOO SCIENTIFIC

"There are two curricula at Stan
ford," said Miss Yost, "formal and
informal—academic work and social
life and activities—they should sup
plement each other."
Emphasizing the primary import
ance of good academic work, Miss
Yost said it belongs at the center
of every woman's life here. "The
women have always had a higher
collective average than the men at
Stanford," she said, "but it isn't as
much higher as it used to be, and
the men aren't getting any better,
so you can figure that out."

Miss Yost pointed out specifically
the essentialness of good study hab
its to good academic work. She also
urged the women leaders to whom
she spoke to encourage new women
having difficulty to discuss their aca
demic troubles with the Dean of
Women's office and with the pro
fessors concerned.
Miss Anastasia Doyle, director of
women's residence and vocational
adviser in the Dean of Women's of
fice, brought out the place vocational
guidance holds in relation to aca
demic work. She pointed out that
she herself and the student commit
tee which works with her act as liai
son officers between college activi
ties and the outside world.

"Women are scientific about their
physical development — the right
shade of lipstick and too many ex
tra pounds—why not about their
mental development also?" Miss
Doyle asked. Miss Doyle assists
women in deciding both on their vo
cation on leaving college and on the
curriculum which they should take
while they are here to help them in
that vocation later.
Gretchen Ahlswede, chairman of
Women's Council, outlined social
regulations and the Honor Code.
Carolyn Hibbard, Conference Presi
dent, reviewed problems presented
at Leadership Institute last spring,
outlining the position of leaders on
the campus and what is expected of
them.
Kathleen Norris, women's head of
the junior transfer orientation com
mittee, pointed out that the whole
student body should take part in this
work, picking up where the commit-
I tee leaves off, after the first few
| weeks of the quarter.
