# Staff Head Tells Change In Gym Rules
## 
### 
Changes in the women's health
service for this year have been an
nounced by Dr. Helen B. Pryor,
head of the gym staff.
It will no longer be necessary for
women to provide their own gym
uniforms, according to Dr. Pryor's
announcement. Gym fees in all
classes will be raised to $5.00 a
quarter, and the University will
provide and launder the uniforms.
This does not apply to golf and
archery, which already have fees
of $5.00.
Women who already have their
own uniforms should take them over
to the Gym with their names marked
on them, and leave them there for
laundering, she said.
One reason for the change is that,
since everyone will be obliged to
dress in the Gym, women will not
be seen so frequently at the Cellar
and in Palo Alto in shorts.
Women who wish to be excused
from classes because of illness
should have their head resident or
house president phone the health
service, Dr. Pryor announced.
Women may no longer go home be
cause of illness without the permis
sion of the Gym staff.
General gym excuses, for such
events as rushing teas and football
games, will be given by the indi
vidual instructors at their own dis
cretion, and no blanket excuses will
be issued.
