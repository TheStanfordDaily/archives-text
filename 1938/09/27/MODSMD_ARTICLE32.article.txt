# A.S.S.U. Group Aids Foreigners
## 
### 
Foreign students registering for
the first time at the University are
being aided by the A.S.S.U. Inter
national Committee headed by Co
chairmen Bob Livingston and Helen
Gilman.
Heretofore, foreign students have
been forced to undertake register
ing without assistance and on occa
sion have been at a disadvantage be
cause of an inability to adjust them
selves to the ways of a people speak
ing a strange language.
This year letters of welcome were
inserted in the registration booklets
of all new foreign students and in
formation desk was instituted in
front of the Administration Build
ing. Some 20 students from various
foreign countries have availed them
selves of the committee's services,
according to Livingston.
Last year 143,794,654.1 cubic feet
of timber were used for railroad
ties and switch ties.
