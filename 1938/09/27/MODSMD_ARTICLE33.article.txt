# Chappie Calls For Freshmen To Swell Staff
## Salaried Positions To Lure Funnymen To Old Boy's Lair 
### 
"Give me freshmen," Old Boy Art
Levinson roared through his long
white beard. "And give me fresh
women," he added with a gleam in
his eye as he surveyed Chappie's as
sembled staff.
"Drop up to the office in the Press
Building most any time. Submit
your creations—humor, if it's funny,
reviews, art work, verse. They're all
welcome. And there's money in it
if you get to the top," he slyly added.

SALARIED SPOTS

INSTRUCTION OFFERED

Salaried executive spots are those
of editor, business manager, circula
tion manager, women's manager (she
manages the women), and secretary
treasurer of Hammer and Coffin.
"There are some more jobs, too,"
Levinson said, "but there's no money
in them. Just glory." These other
posts include the art editor, two
women office managers, advertising
managers, drama editors.
"We're celebrating the 40th year
that Chappie has rolled off the
presses. It's going to be a colossal
anniversary. We're doing it up right
with art work by famous cartoonists
who are former Chappie contribu
tors. It's going to be a real deal.
Why, our first cover is by Feg Mur
ray—you know, the guy who does
the syndicated 'Seem' the Stars in
Hollywood'," Levinson gloated.

And just to show his heart's in the
right place, the Old Boy is offering
free art instruction by professionals
for tryoutees who are sufficiently in
terested and talented. He didn't say
whether the professionals would in
struct Chappie's regular staff artists
or not.
"If you're good you can make
Hammer and Coffin," the Old Boy
continued as he tried to untangle his
beard from the typewriter keys. He
began to brag about some of the
big-wigs, like Will Irwin and James
Swinnerton, who are members of the
outfit.
"Yes, we want tryoutees," he con
cluded. "The first issue is due to
hit the Farm on October 19. Better
watch for it. But, meanwhile, we
want freshmen. Yeh, we gotta have
freshmen."
