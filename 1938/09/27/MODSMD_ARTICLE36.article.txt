# Professor Tricks Nature As Chicks Crow Too Soon
## 
### 
Chicks crowing at the age of nine
days? Impossible, claims Mother
Nature. But Professor Calvin P.
Stone says it can be done, and,
what's more, did it this summer to
prove his point.
Ten Rhode Island Red chicks were
taken at one day of age and given
daily sub-cutaneous injections of a
newly developed male sex hormone
—testosterone propionate. Within
a period of nine days, several of the
pint-size roosters developed unmis
takeable crows.
True, their efforts to demonstrate
their precocious behavior were a far
cry from the full-fledged crow of
the adult rooster—but they were
crows. The squeaky nature of the
vocalization is due to the underde
velopment of the vocal chords, Dr.
Stone explains.

Along with the crow, the midgets
were pugnacious, fighting frequently
with each other and offering battle
with an unwary finger thrust into
their cage. Normally, the chicks
would be nearly six months old be
fore beginning to crow, poultry fan
ciers claim.
Patterned after a similar one by
James Hamilton of Yale, the experi
ment carried on in the psychology
laboratory at Stanford may have
certain important contributions to
make to the field of hormonal
studies. The experiment has al
ready attracted scattered attention
from poultry workers and laymen
throughout the country.
