# Council Head Tells Women's Social Rules
## Late Leave Changes Are Emphasized At Conference 
### 
Women's social regulations for the
coming year, including particularly
changes made by Conference last
spring, were outlined by Gretchen
Ahlswede, chairman of Women's
Council, at Conference's first meet
ing Saturday morning.
In giving a general outline of the
l'egulations Miss Ahlswede ex
plained that Council, rule-enforcing
body, derives its authority from
Conference, which directly repre
sents each woman on the Campus,
and that, consequently, all women
have a part in setting up their so
cial regulations.

Particularly emphasized was the
fact that women in houses do not
receive special protection because
they are not checked in and out by
a night matron, each being on her
honor to report lockouts.
Conference last spring abolished
the regulation forbidding women to
visit a man's room or apartment un
chaperoned, although it is still en
forced in regard to women's going
upstairs in fraternity houses. They
may do this only during dances and
open houses.
Council emphasizes the fact, how
ever, that Stanford has the right at
all times to exact "orderly conduct"
of women students, and that the
University's fundamental standard,
as expressed by Dr. Jordan, applies
to every phase of life not covered by
individual rules.

In regard to lockouts, women are
particularly urged to phone in if
they know they are going to be
late. Council will take this into
consideration in giving the penalty.
Council will have a regular office
hour throughout the quarter, Mon
day through Thursday, and women
who wish to obtain special leaves
should see a member then. In case
of extreme emergency, leaves may
be granted by house presidents, who
must report them to Council the
following day.

Miss Ahlswede pointed out that
since last spring it is a violation of
the state laws for a minor to accept
a drink on the premises on which it
is sold. Students are also reminded
that the University can expect be
coming conduct of women over 21.
A brief review of the specific ap
plications of the Honor Code brought
out the fact that not only examina
tions, but also themes, should be
signed "No unpermitted aid given
or received," with the full name of
the students. The Code applies to
Library privileges at all time, in
cluding turning in bibliographies
which have not been used for refer
ence.
The Code also applies to labora
tory work, and to using one paper
for two courses without the per
mission of both professors. Students
should never incorporate another's
work, either wholly or partially, in
a paper, without a note to that effect.

which have not been used for refer
ence.
The Code also applies to labora
tory work, and to using one paper
for two courses without the per
mission of both professors. Students
should never incorporate another's
work, either wholly or partially, in
a paper, without a note to that effect.
Women's social regulations for the
coming year, including particularly
changes made by Conference last
spring, were outlined by Gretchen
Ahlswede, chairman of Women's
Council, at Conference's first meet
ing Saturday morning.
In giving a general outline of the
l'egulations Miss Ahlswede ex
plained that Council, rule-enforcing
body, derives its authority from
Conference, which directly repre
sents each woman on the Campus,
and that, consequently, all women
have a part in setting up their so
cial regulations.

LAW STIFFENED

Particularly emphasized was the
fact that women in houses do not
receive special protection because
they are not checked in and out by
a night matron, each being on her
honor to report lockouts.
Conference last spring abolished
the regulation forbidding women to
visit a man's room or apartment un
chaperoned, although it is still en
forced in regard to women's going
upstairs in fraternity houses. They
may do this only during dances and
open houses.
Council emphasizes the fact, how
ever, that Stanford has the right at
all times to exact "orderly conduct"
of women students, and that the
University's fundamental standard,
as expressed by Dr. Jordan, applies
to every phase of life not covered by
individual rules.

In regard to lockouts, women are
particularly urged to phone in if
they know they are going to be
late. Council will take this into
consideration in giving the penalty.
Council will have a regular office
hour throughout the quarter, Mon
day through Thursday, and women
who wish to obtain special leaves
should see a member then. In case
of extreme emergency, leaves may
be granted by house presidents, who
must report them to Council the
following day.

Miss Ahlswede pointed out that
since last spring it is a violation of
the state laws for a minor to accept
a drink on the premises on which it
is sold. Students are also reminded
that the University can expect be
coming conduct of women over 21.
A brief review of the specific ap
plications of the Honor Code brought
out the fact that not only examina
tions, but also themes, should be
signed "No unpermitted aid given
or received," with the full name of
the students. The Code applies to
Library privileges at all time, in
cluding turning in bibliographies
which have not been used for refer
ence.
The Code also applies to labora
tory work, and to using one paper
for two courses without the per
mission of both professors. Students
