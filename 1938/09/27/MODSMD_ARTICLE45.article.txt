# Economist to Talk On Wheat Surplus
## 
### 
Although the world wheat surplus
this year may be almost as large as
the surpluses in 1931 and 1932, no
major producing country except the
United States has yet appeared will
ing to accept a substantial decrease
in wheat production, Dr. Holbrook
Working, economist of the Food Re
search Institute at Stanford Univer
sity, said today in advance of a radio
talk to be broadcast from Station
KGO next Monday evening at 9:30
o'clock.
International competition in wheat
production has become a competition
among governments, Dr. Working
pointed out. The competition has
now reached a stage so critical that
some compromise is likely to be
forced before many months, he said.
