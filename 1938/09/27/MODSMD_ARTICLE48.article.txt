## 
### 
With one eye looking three months
ahead to a championship and the
other eye looking to the present and
a little hard work in fundamentals
and scrimmage, Coach Nort Thorn
ton takes his veteran water polo
team into Encina pool for its first
workout of the season today.
it will be a light workout he'll
give the boys to start with: three
quarters of an hour in passing, drib
bling, and such, and half an hour
of scrimmage.
Looking for a breather to ease the
boys into what promises to be one
of the tougher seasns, Coach Norton
signed up the Athens Club for Stan
of the tougher seasons, Coach Norton
stuck his, and the team's, neck out.
Practically famous for their weak
teams, the Athens have done a little
double-crossing this year. Thorn
ton says, "This will be one of our
toughest games all season —and we

were looking for an easy one to start
with."
Chief reason for the Athens Club's
new-found strength is the four Cal
players from last year's champion
ship team who arc playing with the
Club now.
With a veteran team and a few
good frosh moving up to the varsity
league, Thornton is looking for "a
good year, albeit a hard year.
Led by right forward Captain
Johnny Lamb, the first string line
up will probably come from these
players: Jack Loupe, Harv Roth
schild, Bob Plate, Dick Hoover, Ted
Moreno, Bruce Jessup, Bill Hatch,
Roy Vitousck, and Lloyd Wilson.
