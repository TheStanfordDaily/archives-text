# Card Gridders Hard at Work For Bronco Tilt
## Santa Clarans Given Edge Over Redskins In Season's Opener 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Down in San Jose, the cigar store
quarterbacks are offering odds of
2 to 1 and spotting as high as 18
points that Santa Clara's new Bron
cos will make it three in a row over
Tiny Thornhill's hopefuls next Sat
urday.
It was just three years ago that
Buck Shaw became the Broncs' head
coach and immediately announced
his intention to slow down the Rose
Bowl champions. His trainers posted
placards around their dressing rooms
and built up a revenge campaign
that apparently hasn't ended yet be
cause the Sugar Bowl Boys have
won two in a row and seem favored
in the third.

But the Laughing Boys can only
laugh now when a junior manager
blows a whistle for time out and you
have to flash a student body card be
fore you can get in to watch the new
highly organized practice sessions.
There isn't much doubt that both
Thornhill and his squad realize that
the outcome of the Santa Clara
game will be a barometer for the
rest of the season. In the past two
years the natural letdown after de
feat in the first game has shown
itself hard to shake off.
Almost daily scrimmage—another
innovation—has brought the squad
to a peak of condition although a
few near casualties have caught
several men. First of the squad to
go was Jimmy Groves, who was
slated to be in at right half. Groves,
best defensive back on the team last
fall, wrecked a shoulder several
weeks ago to put himself out for the
year and thus carry out another
Stanford tradition that has seen
three stars laid up for the season in
as many years. Last year it was End
Jack Clark who was decommis
sioned and the year before it was
Bill Paulman. Both of these men
arc current first-stringers.

Besides Groves, Hampton Pool,
Norm Standlee, Jake Thompson, and
a few others have been laid up with
muscle and leg injuries. Standlee
still has the inside track on a job
at full or quarter when his ankle
strengthens, but Pool will have to
work his way up again to get the
right half call over Hugh Gallar
neau, who didn't even turn out as a
sophomore and played end as a
frosh.
Up until about three weeks ago,
Gallarneau's chief claim tc fame
was his reputation as the Farm's
outstanding heavyweight boxer.
Now he joins the stellar list of
Stanford's "greatest since the Vow
Boys" backfield stars.

Chief worry of tho coaching stafT
to date has been replacements at
center and guard. Tony Calvelli
should be far and away the best
pivot man in the conference but re
placements there are inexperienced.
Big Wally DeWitt and the ailing
Thompson have come along nicely
with DeWitt's weight holding him in
good stead for the second-string
spot.
By West and Corky Donahue have
been experimenting at guard after
spending too much time as stand
ins for Tackles Pete Zagar and
Stan Andersen. Bob Dakan and Dick
Sutton are the incumbents there
from spring practice.
Yesterday, Thornhill, back from
his Los Angeles scouting trip, con
ducted chalk talks in the morning.
In the afternoon the Greys, schooled
in Bronco plays, scrimmaged the
regulars. They used plays from last
season inasmuch as Santa Clara
hasn't performed publicly as yet.
What new plans and attacks Shaw
has devised for Indian consumption
won't be divulged until Saturday.

But the Laughing Boys can only
laugh now when a junior manager
blows a whistle for time out and you
have to flash a student body card be
fore you can get in to watch the new
highly organized practice sessions.
There isn't much doubt that both
Thornhill and his squad realize that
the outcome of the Santa Clara
game will be a barometer for the
rest of the season. In the past two
years the natural letdown after de
feat in the first game has shown
itself hard to shake off.
Almost daily scrimmage—another
innovation—has brought the squad
to a peak of condition although a
few near casualties have caught
several men. First of the squad to
go was Jimmy Groves, who was
slated to be in at right half. Groves,
best defensive back on the team last
fall, wrecked a shoulder several
weeks ago to put himself out for the
year and thus carry out another
Stanford tradition that has seen
three stars laid up for the season in
as many years. Last year it was End
Jack Clark who was decommis
sioned and the year before it was
Bill Paulman. Both of these men
arc current first-stringers.

Besides Groves, Hampton Pool,
Norm Standlee, Jake Thompson, and
a few others have been laid up with
muscle and leg injuries. Standlee
still has the inside track on a job
at full or quarter when his ankle
strengthens, but Pool will have to
work his way up again to get the
right half call over Hugh Gallar
neau, who didn't even turn out as a
sophomore and played end as a
frosh.
Up until about three weeks ago,
Gallarneau's chief claim tc fame
was his reputation as the Farm's
outstanding heavyweight boxer.
Now he joins the stellar list of
Stanford's "greatest since the Vow
Boys" backfield stars.

Chief worry of tho coaching stafT
to date has been replacements at
center and guard. Tony Calvelli
should be far and away the best
pivot man in the conference but re
placements there are inexperienced.
Big Wally DeWitt and the ailing
Thompson have come along nicely
with DeWitt's weight holding him in
good stead for the second-string
spot.
By West and Corky Donahue have
been experimenting at guard after
spending too much time as stand
ins for Tackles Pete Zagar and
Stan Andersen. Bob Dakan and Dick
Sutton are the incumbents there
from spring practice.
Yesterday, Thornhill, back from
his Los Angeles scouting trip, con
ducted chalk talks in the morning.
In the afternoon the Greys, schooled
in Bronco plays, scrimmaged the
regulars. They used plays from last
season inasmuch as Santa Clara
hasn't performed publicly as yet.
What new plans and attacks Shaw
has devised for Indian consumption
won't be divulged until Saturday.
Down in San Jose, the cigar store
quarterbacks are offering odds of
2 to 1 and spotting as high as 18
points that Santa Clara's new Bron
cos will make it three in a row over
Tiny Thornhill's hopefuls next Sat
urday.
It was just three years ago that
Buck Shaw became the Broncs' head
coach and immediately announced
his intention to slow down the Rose
Bowl champions. His trainers posted
placards around their dressing rooms
and built up a revenge campaign
that apparently hasn't ended yet be
cause the Sugar Bowl Boys have
