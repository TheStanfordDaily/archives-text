QNLY one link is missing. They've got the men and they've got the
team—a little student backing and Stanford's Big Red Machine will
go to town.
Ball players know they will have good support at the games, but how
do they know men don't turn out just to do card stunts or women to
wave pom-poms and parade new hats. If student backers were to appear
at practice sessions occasionally, the players could be sure their support
is genuine.
Stanford footbalT practices are second only to games in spectator
interest. Scrimmages during the week before a game arc rare, but line
scrimmage is more interesting in many ways. Those on the sidelines can
watch the same play repeated often enough to learn the strategy involved.
And since three or four strings alternate, players can be compared under
similar conditions from the first string on down. Saturday's game is always
twice as fascinating to those who have seen the men in practice. And
games become more personal for those who have watched practice enough
to tell the players by their looks instead of by the numbers on their
backs.
Some griddors will tell you they play for the game and not for the
glory, but several of the first string stars have frankly admitted that stu
dent support at practice would fire up the squad, make them take their
work more seriously, and give them a feeling that their rooters do i)ot
attend games just because it is the thing to do. It is one thing that is
needed out there this year to make a fine team better.
So if it is a good football team wc want this year, let's get out there
and show them. There will be plenty doing inside the big green fence
from 3 to 5 o'clock this afternoon. Practices are secret, but all students,
women included, are welcome. According to the coaches and players,
women have a special influence that cannot be beat when it comes to put
ting the old ginger into a ball team.
And if you're interested in seeing the new freshman Icam in action,
just look on the other side of the fence. The yearlings will be meeting their
first opponents in a practice scrimmage against Menlo Junior College.

JT may appear that a few teams got ofT on the wrong foot last week-end,
but their failures can do them as much good as harm. Of course it is
hard to get rolling after a smashing defeat, but a loss points out weak
nesses more clearly than a victory and a losing team may easily become the
better for a loss.
Southern California lost to one of the finest teams the country has ever
seen. Alabama's victory should not lower anybody's opinion of the Trojans.
It is true the Husky team that lost to Minnesota did not live up to cxpec-
tations, but the fact remains that Washington has a fine team and may !
benefit irom defeat.
California would not worry the Indians if the Bears were only as good j
as they appeared in the first three quarters of the St. Mary's game, but
a victorious finis ould give piety of U.C. opponents the shivers. Tex ;
Oliver's Oregonians took Washington State for 41 ride, but neither can !
stack up as a threat to the Cards.
U.C.L.A. Bruins moved up the grid ladder, not simply by trouncing
lowa by four touchdowns but by showing the fans a backfield with speed
and ability that should keep them in the upper half of the conference j
honors.
And while two fine teams got off on the wrong foot, the Indians have
not got off on any foot and can worry plenty about their opener next
Saturday against Santa Clara. The Big Bed Machine runs more smoothly
with every turn ol the wheels, but reports from neighbors to the south i
are equally good. It will mean a great deal to either team to open with a
victory, and they'll show the fans a close, hard-fought battle.

JIUGH GALLERNEAU has his name well engraved on Tiny Thorn
hill's first string backfield. Hugh's southpaw passing comes in very
nicely at right half and offers added versatility. Norm Standlee will be
back at fullback after a little ankle trouble, and Bill Paulman will remain
at quarter. Peter Fay will flash down the field as usual from left half.
Jack Clark is set for a good season on the left flank, where he was
unexcelled before an injury last year. Tony Calvelli will play most of
every game at center, as will Pete Zazar and Stan Andersen at tackles.
Guard and right end spots remain the only undecided positions in the
Card line-up. It is hard to say whether Tiny will start Bob Dakan and
Dick Sutton or the two men recently oriented from tackle posts, I3y West
and Corky Donahue. Bill McElroy and Andy Stojkovich are running a
nip and tuck race at right end.
Whichever combination Tiny decides to use, it will be a good one- darn
near as good as Buck Shaw's. And Tiny has reserves.
