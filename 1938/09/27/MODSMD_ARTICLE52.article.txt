# Twiggs Loses Four Top Men
## Squad Begins Fall Practice Tomorrow 
### 
In spite of the loss of his first four
stars who copped the National In
tercollegiate team title last June,
Stanford golf coach Eddie Twiggs
is expecting this year's links team
to retain the high spot reached by
last year's outfit.
Twiggs intends to start working
out with his squad tomorrow. Ex
pected to be the backbone of the
team are Don Kennedy, Bob Breyer,
Jack Showalter, and Dick Wright,
lettermen from last year who were
just a step behind Art Doering, Bill
Boyd, Jack Wallace, Brown Can
non, Jim Rea, and A1 Hyman, grad
uated stars whom Twiggs took to
the national meet.
Besides the four Circle "S" win
ners, Dave MacHarg and Ren Sut
ton, squadmen from '38, and a flock
of new sophomore luminaries in
cluding Warren Berl, winner of the
Stanford Golf Club Invitational this
summer. Don Haslett, Hal Stone,
Bill Henley, L. B. Harbour, and
George Bradley are other prospects
from last year's promising frosh
squad.
The varsity will be given indi
vidual rankings within the next two
weeks and regular inter-club com
petition and challenges will hold
forth.
