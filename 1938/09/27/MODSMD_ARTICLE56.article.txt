# Tiny Weeps â€” Just Missed $500 In Equipment
## 
### 
With tears in his eyes, Tiny
Thomhill is sitting at home in his
study (if he has one) every night.
He's thinking of sad football stories.
His melancholy is not pathological,
however. He has a reason for think
ing of sad stories, a thousand-dollar
reason.
Every fall Spokane's Athletic
Round Table gives away a sizeable
amount of football equipment to the
football coach who can write them
the saddest football story.
Tiny thought of a very pitiful
story last year, a story of a fullback
with one leg shorter than the other
who could only run one way and
constantly stepped on his hands.
His story nearly won the five hun
dred dollars' worth of equipment first
prize, but just missed and he got the
second prize, a 325 pound "fullback"
woh did all his running down the

columns of sport pages and whoso
only gains yverc measured in terms
of publicity.
Tiny is twice as sad this year: the
first prize is worth one thousand
bucks.
