# Stanford Rats Go Hollywood
## 
### 
Donning make-up and a theatrical
walk, 32 white, black, and striped
rats advanced upon Hollywood this
summer to take part in an education
short at the Metro-Goldwyn-Muyer
studios.
Chaperoned on their journey to
the golden film mecca by Ryland
Madison, graduate student in bacte
riology at Stanford, the rodents
spent two weeks in the studio at
tracting much notice in Los Angeles
papers and among rival production
groups.
The animals were trained in the
psychology department at Stanford
in running mazes, leaping obstacles,
and discriminating between colored
cards. Training was carried on for
a period of two months until the
animals were well versed in their
tasks and could run faultlessly
through their paces before the cam
era.
The education short was one of a
series of six science features being
handled by Madison for M.-G.-M.
The picture will be released at an
early though unannounced date, he
reports.
