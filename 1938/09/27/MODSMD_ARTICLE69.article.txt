SANTA MONICA, Sept. 26 (UP).
â€”Fears that the nation's airports
would have to be either enlarged or
discarded in favor of bigger ones to
handle the new 42-passenger air
liner soon to be put into service were
dispelled today. Four months of test
flights show that the new Douglas
DC-4 will land and take off from
any Class A airport in the United
States.
