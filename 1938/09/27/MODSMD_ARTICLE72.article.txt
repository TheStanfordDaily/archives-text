# The 						Old Guessing Game
## 
### 
IN the groove, this second issue of The Daily
is a time for editorial gazing in the crystal ball
to discover the exact state of decay which the
paper has suffered under the past regime and
to read the precise formula for refurbishing it.
Traditionally, the editor is counted on to pull
off a phenomenal magic act—state his future
plans, policies, and idiosyncrasies. And then
stick to them.
There are no magicians on this paper.
A few things, however, might be said which
are indefinite enough to fall back on when the
ride gets too rough.
In the first place, readers who expect this to
be a minor counterpart of a metropolitan paper
had better see their hall representatives for the
city news-sheets. The Daily is primarily a house
organ; its first duty is to cover the campus
completely, competently.
This one fact long has been a sore brain
thumper for Daily editors. Fully cognizant of
the fury which is brewing outside Stanford's
walls, and impressed with the startling insig
nificance of most of the activity which goes on
within, the trick is to fulfill The Daily's obliga
tion as Stanford's bulletin board, and yet not
relax into provincial indifference to the outer
world.
The Daily will, then, first cover the campus,
but, coincidently, will attempt to catch the snag
ends of the unraveling world and knit them into
a compact picture of current events.
All this the editor can say safely. But, sup
posedly, that's not enough. Supposedly, he
must stretch neck muscles to their fag ends to
get his chin out into the breeze with statements
of editorial policy.
Canny editors dodge the axe of miscalcula
tion by offering only intimations, hedged
roundly by qualifying clauses:
That Stanford could easily stand a few minor
and major repairs, but that, after all, money, not
type, can fix almost anything;
That a few brisk campaigns are the very thing
to liven up the paper, but that, after all, they
seldom set the world afire for long;
That startling proclamations concerning cam
pus morals and roads may put Stanford's name
in the metropolitan papers, but are seldom in
telligent comment.
All these are canny intimations, suggesting
much but promising little.
And, because he is no clairvoyant, this edi
tor will remain canny.
The Daily editorial policy must develop as
events transpire. But founding this indefinite
platform will be the firm conviction that edi
torial ill temper is bad taste, sensationalism
"belongs only in papers which have nothing else
to offer, and hard-shell intolerance of new ideas
and new attitudes is fatal.

relax into provincial indifference to the outer
world.
The Daily will, then, first cover the campus,
but, coincidently, will attempt to catch the snag
ends of the unraveling world and knit them into
a compact picture of current events.
All this the editor can say safely. But, sup
posedly, that's not enough. Supposedly, he
must stretch neck muscles to their fag ends to
get his chin out into the breeze with statements
of editorial policy.
Canny editors dodge the axe of miscalcula
tion by offering only intimations, hedged
roundly by qualifying clauses:
That Stanford could easily stand a few minor
and major repairs, but that, after all, money, not
type, can fix almost anything;
That a few brisk campaigns are the very thing
to liven up the paper, but that, after all, they
seldom set the world afire for long;
That startling proclamations concerning cam
pus morals and roads may put Stanford's name
in the metropolitan papers, but are seldom in
telligent comment.
All these are canny intimations, suggesting
much but promising little.
And, because he is no clairvoyant, this edi
tor will remain canny.
The Daily editorial policy must develop as
events transpire. But founding this indefinite
platform will be the firm conviction that edi
torial ill temper is bad taste, sensationalism
"belongs only in papers which have nothing else
to offer, and hard-shell intolerance of new ideas
and new attitudes is fatal.
IN the groove, this second issue of The Daily
is a time for editorial gazing in the crystal ball
to discover the exact state of decay which the
paper has suffered under the past regime and
to read the precise formula for refurbishing it.
Traditionally, the editor is counted on to pull
off a phenomenal magic act—state his future
plans, policies, and idiosyncrasies. And then
stick to them.
There are no magicians on this paper.
A few things, however, might be said which
are indefinite enough to fall back on when the
ride gets too rough.
In the first place, readers who expect this to
be a minor counterpart of a metropolitan paper
had better see their hall representatives for the
city news-sheets. The Daily is primarily a house
organ; its first duty is to cover the campus
completely, competently.
This one fact long has been a sore brain
thumper for Daily editors. Fully cognizant of
the fury which is brewing outside Stanford's
walls, and impressed with the startling insig
nificance of most of the activity which goes on
within, the trick is to fulfill The Daily's obliga
tion as Stanford's bulletin board, and yet not
relax into provincial indifference to the outer
world.
