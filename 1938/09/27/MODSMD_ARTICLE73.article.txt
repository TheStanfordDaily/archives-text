# Cooked Pre-Reg Sizzles
## 
### 
FOR most of Stanford, it is part of the sub
merged furor that goes on before school
starts; for those that do witness it, it is old stuff
by now.
But for the 700-odd frosh who arrive breath
lessly on the Farm for the first time, the pre
registration program means something.
What it means naturally depends upon the
individual. It may be just a sobered-up Ameri
can Legion Convention—names, names, names,
and how are you? For some, it may impart
valuable information which would otherwise
take months of hard knocks to acquire. Or it
may impress the freshman that this is an amaz
ingly friendly place.
But no matter what the single impression is,
there is a nicely adjusted thermometer to gauge
it—the enthusiasm of the frosh. And when no
feminine stag-line developed at the pre-reg
jolly-up, even the most skeptical would have
to admit that the red line in the thermometer
was spouting out the top. Maybe we're wrong,
maybe the frosh are just good actors—but it
looked as if they liked the pre-reg edition of
Stanford life.
So, without becoming effusive about it all,
Congratulations to Lyle Cook, chairman of the
program, for mastering the welter of detail
connected with mapping out the program, for
making up Stanford's early-quarter face in style

which should have captured the most callow
or calloused first-year man. And to the faculty,
sponsors, and committeemen who aided him,
congratulations for having a better time doing
the pre-reg rag-time than the frosh.
It was a fine job.
