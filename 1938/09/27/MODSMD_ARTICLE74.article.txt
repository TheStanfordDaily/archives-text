# A 						Little Squeaky, Though

### 
WITH pride, The Daily has a few announce
ments to make:
(1) With the addition of Acme Telephoto
Service, pictures of national and international
events will no longer sport a gamey smell of
over-ripeness before they hit The Daily.
(2) Ace cartoonist Tommy Thompson is back.
The lad who last fall made a tradition out of the
Little Red Roller will again tickle campus funny
bones with his goofy Indians.
(3) Harking back several years, The Daily
will once a month deliver itself of a four-page,
tabloid size photolith section, the first of which
appeared with the pre-registration issue.
Like the chicks on page three. The Daily is
crowing.
\ Sure that's a crow you hear.
