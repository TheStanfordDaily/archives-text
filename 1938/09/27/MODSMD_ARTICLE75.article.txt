# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
CHEQUE AND DOUBLE CHEQUE

ONCE upon a time in the Stanford dawn age, The
Daily editorial board met to talk, about policy.
The Managing Editor kicked at the desk, caught it a
stiff one, and settled back. "There's a hole in the back
page," he said in the same tone he would have used
to tell a young lady her slip showed.
"I know," said the Editor. "We'll put a column
there."
"What kinda column?" asked the M.E. cynically,
trying to sound like his predecessor and pleasing him
self with the result.
The Editor sorted over the words he found on the
top shelf of his mind and rejected them all, out of
courtesy to the Woman's Editor.
"It will be," he said at last, "a comment column."
He liked the term. "Yes, a comment column.
* * * ♦
And so on that day now vanished into the misty
abyss of time, Bull Session was born. Since then its
course has been a textbook example of a "chequered
career."
At times it has spoken like a Moses just back from
the Sinai conference room, putting all its chips on
one Cause. On other occasions, it has dodged issues
until it has become as wanly tactful as conversation at
a student-faculty tea.
It has screamed, and whispered, and sometimes
snored unashamed. It can speak like some crusty
=;od who has taken five minutes off his lunch hour
to straighten out our terrestrial mess. Or it can plead
for help, like a small boy in a crowd who suddenly
finds that the coat-tail he holds is not his father's.
* * * *
the coming volume, Bull Session will be my
protege, and I shall try to see that it lives a
normal, well-rounded life as a "comment column."
Often it will ride forth, like one of King Arthur's
mobsters, to have it out with one of our local dragons.
And we arc considering the idea of setting aside every
other Tuesday for redressing wrongs and comforting
the oppressed.
But much of Bull's athletic activities will come
from straddling fences and from jumping at wrong
conclusions. This is unavoidable.
It is easy to say at the beginning of the year that
we will assail all evil fearlessly, and damn the tor
pedoes. But when trouble actually comes up, it takes
a good intellectual cowboy to sort the sheep from the
goats.
And so sometimes Bull Session will knock politely
when it should hammer with a sword hilt. And
i sometimes it will charge in and back out with blush
ing apologies.
* * * *
This column will comment. That I can promise.
Beyond that I can't say. Sometimes it wiil wander
into phantasy. Sometimes it will snicker; once in a
while it will give its own interpretation of an en
raged roar. We have no cut-rate Cause to sell, and
no divine message to deliver.
And so with this future assigned to it, Bull Session
goes forth to follow the course of the fiery com
ment.

Beyond that I can't say. Sometimes it wiil wander
into phantasy. Sometimes it will snicker; once in a

raged roar. We have no cut-rate Cause to sell, and
no divine message to deliver.
And so with this future assigned to it, Bull Session
goes forth to follow the course of the fiery com

CHEQUE AND DOUBLE CHEQUE

ONCE upon a time in the Stanford dawn age, The
Daily editorial board met to talk, about policy.
The Managing Editor kicked at the desk, caught it a
stiff one, and settled back. "There's a hole in the back
page," he said in the same tone he would have used
to tell a young lady her slip showed.
"I know," said the Editor. "We'll put a column
there."
"What kinda column?" asked the M.E. cynically,
trying to sound like his predecessor and pleasing him
self with the result.
The Editor sorted over the words he found on the
top shelf of his mind and rejected them all, out of
courtesy to the Woman's Editor.
"It will be," he said at last, "a comment column."
He liked the term. "Yes, a comment column.
* * * ♦
And so on that day now vanished into the misty
abyss of time, Bull Session was born. Since then its
course has been a textbook example of a "chequered
career."
At times it has spoken like a Moses just back from
the Sinai conference room, putting all its chips on
one Cause. On other occasions, it has dodged issues
until it has become as wanly tactful as conversation at
a student-faculty tea.
It has screamed, and whispered, and sometimes
snored unashamed. It can speak like some crusty
=;od who has taken five minutes off his lunch hour
to straighten out our terrestrial mess. Or it can plead
for help, like a small boy in a crowd who suddenly
finds that the coat-tail he holds is not his father's.
* * * *
the coming volume, Bull Session will be my
protege, and I shall try to see that it lives a
normal, well-rounded life as a "comment column."
Often it will ride forth, like one of King Arthur's
mobsters, to have it out with one of our local dragons.
And we arc considering the idea of setting aside every
other Tuesday for redressing wrongs and comforting
the oppressed.
But much of Bull's athletic activities will come
from straddling fences and from jumping at wrong
conclusions. This is unavoidable.
It is easy to say at the beginning of the year that
we will assail all evil fearlessly, and damn the tor
pedoes. But when trouble actually comes up, it takes
a good intellectual cowboy to sort the sheep from the
goats.
And so sometimes Bull Session will knock politely
when it should hammer with a sword hilt. And
i sometimes it will charge in and back out with blush
ing apologies.

This column will comment. That I can promise.
Beyond that I can't say. Sometimes it wiil wander

while it will give its own interpretation of an en
raged roar. We have no cut-rate Cause to sell, and
