TPHE first, year when wc were freshmen at Stanford
we rather resented the condescending manner in
which the upper class pundits ladeled their gems of
wisdom at us. Year after year went by! Superciliously,
upper classmen continued to spout—and we continued
to-be freshmen.
At last the worm has turned—and we believe that
this is the first time in the history of Stanford jour
nalism that the freshmen arc to be addressed from the
bottom up, as it were, by one who has himself been a
freshman for over four years.
In our four years as a freshman, we have learned,
among other things:
That Phi Beta Kappas and California men are not,
as a rule, secretly addicted to cocaine;
That Stanford, like the world, is composed of mone
tary and social cliques, but. that Stanford, like the
world, will sooner or later recognize true merit where
it exists;
* * 4c *
That Stanford midquartcrs and finals make up for
seeming everyday classroom laxity;
That life at Stanford is equally worth living in or
out of a Greek Letter organization;
That Stanford women have made a Vanishing Amer
ican out of the traditional Stanford rough;
That small town socialites who try to impress their
fellows by vulgar display constitute one of Stanford's
sorest and bluest bottom bruises;
That it's rather unnecessary to show one's complete
emancipation from mother's apron strings by behaving
for the first six months of school like an American
Legionnaire at a convention;
That despite rumors from Hollywood to the con
trary, college life isn't necessarily an unending cycle
of swing music, alcoholism, free love, and football;
♦ * * *
r IMIAT, in conclusion, Stanford's attitude toward
stuffed shirts and snobs can be illustrated by the
following story:
There were two gold balls in a box; only one ball
was gilt and the other was pure gold.
The gold ball ust*d to knock about the box, while
the gilt ball would sit in its cotton all day long. One
day the gilt ball said to the gold ball.
"If you don't watch out, you'll wear it off!''
The gold ball replied quietly:
"Wear what off?"
