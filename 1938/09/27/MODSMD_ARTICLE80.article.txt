"CAREFREE," starring Ginger Rog
ers and Fred Astaire. and playing
al the Fox-Stanford through Wed
nesday:
Like all Astaire-Rogers pictures,
"Carefree" is a continental show in
volving more clothes than a musical
and less coherence than a comedy.

As usual, Astairc's
dancing seems less
an accomplish
ment than a way
of life. As usual,
Rogers and As
tai re banter,
scrap, fall in love.
The story has
to do with a psy
chiatrist (Astaire)
who probes Miss

Rogers' subconscious after she balks
marriage to earnest suitor Ralph
Bellamy. His method backfires
when, after being fed on sea food and
whipped cream, Miss Rogers dreams
of him. After pulling a Svengali
on his subject to rivet her affections
on her fiance, Astaire spends the
rest of the film trying to snap her
out of the trance.
"The Yam," the picture's terpsi
choric top spot, is intended to be a
free-for-all—say, like the Big Apple.
While the average dancer would
tackle this little item as spontane
ously as he would approach a ses
sion in accounting, "The Yam" rep
resents a beautiful bit of the As
taire-Rogers technique.
If the couple's infallible formula
fails to jell as well as it previously
has, the fault may be laid to too
much hocus-pocus, not enough song
and-dance. An extrovert, like all
first-rate exhibitionists, Astaire may
be ill at ease fiddling around in the
psyche.
