LONDON, Sept. 26 (UP).â€”Fright
ened demand from English and Eu
ropean nationals today whirled the
official gold price forward to the
highest level since April 1, 1935.
The sharp reversal of the recent
trend reflected the growing fear
throughout Europe that a confla
gration cannot now be checked.
Last week English and continental
hoarders resold gold they had pur
chased in the earlier phases of the
Czech-German dispute on fears that
the various governments would im
pound the precious metal.
