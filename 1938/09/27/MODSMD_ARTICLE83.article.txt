# Chapin to Lead Farm Debating
## Meets in Mexico, Hawaii Proposed 
### 
After a year's leave of absence, j
Professor Lee Chapin has returned
to supervise Stanford's debate activi
ties. Professor Chapin will welcome
old-timers, freshmen, and anyone i
else interested in debating at the
first meeting of the year, which will j
be held in Room 200S in the base- ;
ment of the English Corner Thurs- i
day afternoon at 4 o'clock.
According to Jack Strain, debate
manager, teams will compete in nu
merous debates this year. High- \
lights of off-campus competition in- !
elude a proposed trip to the Ha- I
waiian Islands, the possibility of a
trip to Mexico, a competition in the
Pomona tournament, which includes i
most Pacific Coast schools, and the
customary trips to the Northwest
and the Southwest.
Outstanding local debates will
include the annual Joffre and Com
monwealth Club debates. Further
more, there will be a large number
of short trips, which will give all
those who arc interested in debat
ing an opportunity to compete.
As a unique feature of this year's
activities, Professor Chapin has
planned the revival of the annual
sophomore-freshman decision de
bates. He believes that they will in
crease lower division interest in
debating.
