# Angry Hitler Ready To Move on Czechs; F.R. Seeks Confab
## England Mobilized Fleet, 'Ready to Fight' Fuehrer 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (UP). —President Roose
velt tonight proposed to Chancellor Adolf Hitler that
negotiations to settle the Czechoslovak conflict he wid
ened "into a conference of all nations directly inter
ested in the present controversy."
However, the President did not reveal whether the
United States would attend such a conference.
"The Government of the United States has no po-

litical involvements in Europe," he<
said, "and will assume no obligations i
in the conduct of the piesent nego- |
tiations. Yet in our own right we
recognize our responsibility as a part
of a world of neighbors."
LONDON, Wed., Sept. 28 (UP).—
Great Britain today mobilized her
fighting fleet, mightiest navy in the
world, and sent a ringing warning
to the world she is ready to fight if
Adolf Hitler tries to influence
Czechoslovakia by threats of force.
King George, high commander of
the British armed forces, placed the
country in a "state of emergency"—
a preliminary to a declaration of
war. A report reached London, Hit
ler's armies might invade Czecho
slovakia before nightfall.
The Air Force was under mobili
zation by a royal decree, issued at
the same time as the proclamation
of a "state of emergency," and all
that remained was to mobilize the
regular army of about 450,000 men
and its reserve forces throughout
the empire.

BROADCAST TO WORLD

The eleventh-hour warning of
Britain's readiness to fight was
broadcast to the world last night by
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.
Mr. Chamberlain, who assailed
Hitler's "unreasonable attitude"
toward arbitration, believed when he
spoke the "zero hour" of peace was
but three days off.
But later information received by
the British and French government
indicated der Fuehrer, impatient
and angry, might send hs armies
smashing across the Czech frontier
sometime today.
Germany is ready to order full
mobilization, it was indicated, even
though Hitler already has 1,500,000
men under arms.

WARLIKE SPEED

This alarming information im
pelled Britain to act with warlike
speed in the midnight hours.
The Admiralty announced, a few
jninutes before midnight, King
George VI would issue a royal proc
lamation early today calling up
naval reservists to augment the
112,000 men of the British navy.
The Admiralty's statement ordered
all naval reserves of Class B to re
port to their depots Wednesday
morning without awaiting individ
ual orders.
Nearly 400 warships totalling
1,900,000 tons of fighting steel, from
great grey battle cruisers like the
Hood and Repulse down to trim
little torpedo boats, thus were made
ready for war against a German
navy less than one-fourth its
strength.
In his address, the Prime
Minister strove desperately to head
off Europe's mad plunge toward
war and assailed the "unreasonable
attitude" of Fuehrer Adolf Hitler in
Germany's new ult amiuualormSto
Germany's new ultimatum to
Czechoslovakia.

ITALY, JAPAN LISTEN

The Prime Minister, of course, did
not mention Italy or Japan, but it
was certain his words would be pon
dered in Rome and Tokyo since
Britain repeatedly has made it clear
she feels Italy's "aggression" in
Ethiopia and Japan's march in China
are based on the same pi'inciple
Hitler is following.
Chamberlain's plea for peace and
his admonition to Britons to steel
themselves for the possibility of war
was carried into the German Reich
and Fascist Italy.
He admitted, "There is nothing
further, I can usefully do at the mo
ment," thereby revealing hopes of
winning Hitler over to a peaceful
settlement by mediation seem to
have vanished.
He told how he had promised der
Fuehrer Britain would "guarantee"
early surrender of the Sudeten bor
der areas to which the Prague gov
ernment originally consented.

MUSSOLINI GEARS

FOR WAR
ROME, Sept. 27 (UP).—Premier
Mussolini was reported tonight to
have abandoned all hope a general
war in Europe may be averted, and
consequently ordered Italy's great
military machine geared up ready
for action.
It was learned on unimpeachable
authority the Italian dictator told
his conference of generals, com
manding 1G army corps, he expects
war to come within two or three
days at the most.
Mussolini, it was learned, informed
the generals Italy would fight on the
side of Germany against the coali
tion of allied powers — Britain,
France, Rusisa, and Czechoslovakia.
Although there was no confirma
tion of mobilization rumors, it was
widely reported from six to eight
classes, totalling between 800,000
and 1,000,000 men, would be called
up and military authorities were
preparing to enroll all men between
the ages of 20 and 30.

naval reservists to augment the
112,000 men of the British navy.
The Admiralty's statement ordered
all naval reserves of Class B to re
port to their depots Wednesday
morning without awaiting individ
ual orders.
Nearly 400 warships totalling
1,900,000 tons of fighting steel, from
great grey battle cruisers like the
Hood and Repulse down to trim
little torpedo boats, thus were made
ready for war against a German
navy less than one-fourth its
strength.

Minister strove desperately to head
off Europe's mad plunge toward
war and assailed the "unreasonable
attitude" of Fuehrer Adolf Hitler in
Germany's new ult amiuualormSto
Germany's new ultimatum to
Czechoslovakia.

ITALY, JAPAN LISTEN

The Prime Minister, of course, did
not mention Italy or Japan, but it
was certain his words would be pon
dered in Rome and Tokyo since
Britain repeatedly has made it clear
she feels Italy's "aggression" in
Ethiopia and Japan's march in China
are based on the same pi'inciple
Hitler is following.
Chamberlain's plea for peace and
his admonition to Britons to steel
themselves for the possibility of war
was carried into the German Reich
and Fascist Italy.
He admitted, "There is nothing
further, I can usefully do at the mo
ment," thereby revealing hopes of
winning Hitler over to a peaceful
settlement by mediation seem to
have vanished.
He told how he had promised der
Fuehrer Britain would "guarantee"
early surrender of the Sudeten bor
der areas to which the Prague gov
ernment originally consented.

MUSSOLINI GEARS

FOR WAR
ROME, Sept. 27 (UP).—Premier
Mussolini was reported tonight to
have abandoned all hope a general
war in Europe may be averted, and
consequently ordered Italy's great
military machine geared up ready
for action.
It was learned on unimpeachable
authority the Italian dictator told
his conference of generals, com
manding 1G army corps, he expects
war to come within two or three
days at the most.
Mussolini, it was learned, informed
the generals Italy would fight on the
side of Germany against the coali
tion of allied powers — Britain,
France, Rusisa, and Czechoslovakia.
Although there was no confirma
tion of mobilization rumors, it was
widely reported from six to eight
classes, totalling between 800,000
and 1,000,000 men, would be called
up and military authorities were
preparing to enroll all men between
the ages of 20 and 30.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (UP). —President Roose
velt tonight proposed to Chancellor Adolf Hitler that
negotiations to settle the Czechoslovak conflict he wid
ened "into a conference of all nations directly inter
ested in the present controversy."
However, the President did not reveal whether the
United States would attend such a conference.
"The Government of the United States has no po-

litical involvements in Europe," he<
said, "and will assume no obligations i
in the conduct of the piesent nego- |
tiations. Yet in our own right we
recognize our responsibility as a part
of a world of neighbors."
LONDON, Wed., Sept. 28 (UP).—
Great Britain today mobilized her
fighting fleet, mightiest navy in the
world, and sent a ringing warning
to the world she is ready to fight if
Adolf Hitler tries to influence
Czechoslovakia by threats of force.
King George, high commander of
the British armed forces, placed the
country in a "state of emergency"—
a preliminary to a declaration of
war. A report reached London, Hit
ler's armies might invade Czecho
slovakia before nightfall.
The Air Force was under mobili
zation by a royal decree, issued at
the same time as the proclamation
of a "state of emergency," and all
that remained was to mobilize the
regular army of about 450,000 men
and its reserve forces throughout
the empire.

BROADCAST TO WORLD

The eleventh-hour warning of
Britain's readiness to fight was
broadcast to the world last night by
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.
Mr. Chamberlain, who assailed
Hitler's "unreasonable attitude"
toward arbitration, believed when he
spoke the "zero hour" of peace was
but three days off.
But later information received by
the British and French government
indicated der Fuehrer, impatient
and angry, might send hs armies
smashing across the Czech frontier
sometime today.
Germany is ready to order full
mobilization, it was indicated, even
though Hitler already has 1,500,000
men under arms.

widely reported from six to eight
classes, totalling between 800,000
and 1,000,000 men, would be called
up and military authorities were
preparing to enroll all men between
the ages of 20 and 30.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (UP). —President Roose
velt tonight proposed to Chancellor Adolf Hitler that
negotiations to settle the Czechoslovak conflict he wid
ened "into a conference of all nations directly inter
ested in the present controversy."
However, the President did not reveal whether the
United States would attend such a conference.
"The Government of the United States has no po-

litical involvements in Europe," he<
said, "and will assume no obligations i
in the conduct of the piesent nego- |
tiations. Yet in our own right we
recognize our responsibility as a part
of a world of neighbors."
LONDON, Wed., Sept. 28 (UP).—
Great Britain today mobilized her
fighting fleet, mightiest navy in the
world, and sent a ringing warning
to the world she is ready to fight if
Adolf Hitler tries to influence
Czechoslovakia by threats of force.
King George, high commander of
the British armed forces, placed the
country in a "state of emergency"—
a preliminary to a declaration of
war. A report reached London, Hit
ler's armies might invade Czecho
slovakia before nightfall.
The Air Force was under mobili
zation by a royal decree, issued at
the same time as the proclamation
of a "state of emergency," and all
that remained was to mobilize the
regular army of about 450,000 men
and its reserve forces throughout
the empire.

BROADCAST TO WORLD

The eleventh-hour warning of
Britain's readiness to fight was
broadcast to the world last night by
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.
Mr. Chamberlain, who assailed
Hitler's "unreasonable attitude"
toward arbitration, believed when he
spoke the "zero hour" of peace was
but three days off.
But later information received by
the British and French government
indicated der Fuehrer, impatient
and angry, might send hs armies
smashing across the Czech frontier
sometime today.
Germany is ready to order full
mobilization, it was indicated, even
though Hitler already has 1,500,000
men under arms.

WARLIKE SPEED

This alarming information im
pelled Britain to act with warlike
speed in the midnight hours.
The Admiralty announced, a few
jninutes before midnight, King
George VI would issue a royal proc
lamation early today calling up
naval reservists to augment the
112,000 men of the British navy.
The Admiralty's statement ordered
all naval reserves of Class B to re
port to their depots Wednesday
morning without awaiting individ
ual orders.
Nearly 400 warships totalling
1,900,000 tons of fighting steel, from
great grey battle cruisers like the
Hood and Repulse down to trim
little torpedo boats, thus were made
ready for war against a German
navy less than one-fourth its
strength.
In his address, the Prime
Minister strove desperately to head
off Europe's mad plunge toward
war and assailed the "unreasonable
attitude" of Fuehrer Adolf Hitler in
Germany's new ult amiuualormSto
Germany's new ultimatum to
Czechoslovakia.

ITALY, JAPAN LISTEN

The Prime Minister, of course, did
not mention Italy or Japan, but it
was certain his words would be pon
dered in Rome and Tokyo since
Britain repeatedly has made it clear
she feels Italy's "aggression" in
Ethiopia and Japan's march in China
are based on the same pi'inciple
Hitler is following.
Chamberlain's plea for peace and
his admonition to Britons to steel
themselves for the possibility of war
was carried into the German Reich
and Fascist Italy.
He admitted, "There is nothing
further, I can usefully do at the mo
ment," thereby revealing hopes of
winning Hitler over to a peaceful
settlement by mediation seem to
have vanished.
He told how he had promised der
Fuehrer Britain would "guarantee"
early surrender of the Sudeten bor
der areas to which the Prague gov
ernment originally consented.

MUSSOLINI GEARS

FOR WAR
ROME, Sept. 27 (UP).—Premier
Mussolini was reported tonight to
have abandoned all hope a general
war in Europe may be averted, and
consequently ordered Italy's great
military machine geared up ready
for action.
It was learned on unimpeachable
authority the Italian dictator told
his conference of generals, com
manding 1G army corps, he expects
war to come within two or three
days at the most.
Mussolini, it was learned, informed
the generals Italy would fight on the
side of Germany against the coali
tion of allied powers — Britain,
France, Rusisa, and Czechoslovakia.
Although there was no confirma
tion of mobilization rumors, it was
widely reported from six to eight
classes, totalling between 800,000
and 1,000,000 men, would be called
up and military authorities were
