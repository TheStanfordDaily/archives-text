# Stuart Views Europe's Crisis
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
"If Britain and France stand firm,
Hitler won't fight. Germany couldn't,
last more than six months against a
major power, and he knows it."
This is the opinion of Dr. Graham
Stuart of the political science depart
ment, who sees in the restrength
ened attitude of Britain and France
toward Hitler's claims on Czechoslo
vakia the surest hope for European
peace.
"Hitler's speech Monday would
seem to indicate that he is willing
to leave the door open for a com
promise," Dr. Stuart said. "In line
with a policy of bluffing until his
hand is called, he has carefully
avoided committing himself to war,
and he has also refused to counte
nance the claims made by Poland
and Hungary. Despite the tone of
his speech, he has left himself free
to adjust his policy to the course of
events."

STRATEGIC FRONTIER

Commenting on the justice of Hit
ler's claims, Dr. Stuart pointed out
that the Czech Republic was a com
pletely artificial state, set up at Ver
sailles for the deliberate purpose of
blocking Germany to the east.
"To -achieve this, the Allies at
tempted what almost amounted to a
recreation of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire in miniature, tossing together
the Czechs, Slovaks, Ruthenians,
Magyars, and Poles in a conglom
erate state whose only real justifi
cation in their eyes was its strategic
frontier on the Sudeten Mountains.
Hitler is only following one of the
basic principles which have always
guided him, that of reabsorbing into
the Reich the Germans beyond its
borders; if he can be persuaded to
guarantee Czechoslovakia's new bor
ders, there would seem to be little
real justification for trying to stop
him.
"If he can't be persuaded to guar
antee those frontiers, of course, there
will be a showdown, in which case
unless he is completely insane, he
will almost certainly yield."

NO POLICY CHANGE

; Denying that the United States lias
I changed its foreign policy, or that it
j will come to the aid of Britain and
| France if war comes, Dr. Stuart .said
j that although those countries show a
strong tendency to interpret the re
marks of President Roosevelt and
Secretary Hull in that light, and al
though the interest of Washington is
centered for the moment on Europe,
the real problem before the State De
partment at the present time is the
Mexican oil seizures.
"Because he docs not wish to en
danger the President's good neigh
bor policy, Secretary Hull is taking
great care not to arouse too much
i hostility by his notes to the Cardenas
government. At the same time he is
striving to take a tone sufficiently
strong to preserve American pres
tige in Latin America."
"He knows that a lack of markets
will presently force President Car
denas to revise his policy if he
wishes to remain in office. Because
neither Britain nor America will
buy his oil, and because neither
Germany nor Japan can afford to,
he will either have to reinstate for
eign ownership or face a revolution.
The State Department is simply
playing for time, confident that it
will soon bring him around."

REBELS WILL WIN

Touching briefly on the situation
in the Spanish War, Dr. Stuart said
that he is still convinced that the
Rebels will win, and that when they
do, Britain and France will aid them
in driving all foreigners out of the
country.
"Either way, however," he said,
"the result will be the same. It
seems hardly logical to suppose that
either Britain or France, both of
whose empire life-lines depend on
control of the Mediterranean, will
permit any foreign power to domi
nate Spain. Although their policy
toward the war has seemed vacil
lating. they have not declared
themselves for one side or the other
because they stand to win either
way. When the war ends they will !
aid the victorious government by j
every means at their disposal in its j
struggle to rid itself of foreign j
control."

NO EUROPEAN WAY

In conclusion, Dr. Stuart once
more affirmed belief that war
would not come to Europe at the
present time, and pointed out that
there is one significant lesson to be
learned from war-torn 1938.
"I think it has been definitely
proved," he said, "that, an aggres
sive war against a prepared enemy
is bound to be a long and expensive
process. Dictators can't afford long j
and ' expensive wars. Therefore, Ij
doubt very much if any of them will !
start one."

NO EUROPEAN WAY

In conclusion, Dr. Stuart once
more affirmed belief that war
would not come to Europe at the
present time, and pointed out that
there is one significant lesson to be
learned from war-torn 1938.
"I think it has been definitely
proved," he said, "that, an aggres
sive war against a prepared enemy
is bound to be a long and expensive
process. Dictators can't afford long j
and ' expensive wars. Therefore, Ij
doubt very much if any of them will !
start one."

"If Britain and France stand firm,
Hitler won't fight. Germany couldn't,
last more than six months against a
major power, and he knows it."
This is the opinion of Dr. Graham
Stuart of the political science depart
ment, who sees in the restrength
ened attitude of Britain and France
toward Hitler's claims on Czechoslo
vakia the surest hope for European
peace.
"Hitler's speech Monday would
seem to indicate that he is willing
to leave the door open for a com
promise," Dr. Stuart said. "In line
with a policy of bluffing until his
hand is called, he has carefully
avoided committing himself to war,
and he has also refused to counte
nance the claims made by Poland
and Hungary. Despite the tone of
his speech, he has left himself free
to adjust his policy to the course of
events."

STRATEGIC FRONTIER

Commenting on the justice of Hit
ler's claims, Dr. Stuart pointed out
that the Czech Republic was a com
pletely artificial state, set up at Ver
sailles for the deliberate purpose of
blocking Germany to the east.
"To -achieve this, the Allies at
tempted what almost amounted to a
recreation of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire in miniature, tossing together
the Czechs, Slovaks, Ruthenians,
Magyars, and Poles in a conglom
erate state whose only real justifi
cation in their eyes was its strategic
frontier on the Sudeten Mountains.
Hitler is only following one of the
basic principles which have always
guided him, that of reabsorbing into
the Reich the Germans beyond its
borders; if he can be persuaded to
guarantee Czechoslovakia's new bor
ders, there would seem to be little
real justification for trying to stop
him.
"If he can't be persuaded to guar
antee those frontiers, of course, there
will be a showdown, in which case
unless he is completely insane, he
will almost certainly yield."

NO POLICY CHANGE

; Denying that the United States lias
I changed its foreign policy, or that it
j will come to the aid of Britain and
| France if war comes, Dr. Stuart .said
j that although those countries show a
strong tendency to interpret the re
marks of President Roosevelt and
Secretary Hull in that light, and al
though the interest of Washington is
centered for the moment on Europe,
the real problem before the State De
partment at the present time is the
Mexican oil seizures.
"Because he docs not wish to en
danger the President's good neigh
bor policy, Secretary Hull is taking
great care not to arouse too much
i hostility by his notes to the Cardenas
government. At the same time he is
striving to take a tone sufficiently
strong to preserve American pres
tige in Latin America."
"He knows that a lack of markets
will presently force President Car
denas to revise his policy if he
wishes to remain in office. Because
neither Britain nor America will
buy his oil, and because neither
Germany nor Japan can afford to,
he will either have to reinstate for
eign ownership or face a revolution.
The State Department is simply
playing for time, confident that it
will soon bring him around."

REBELS WILL WIN

Touching briefly on the situation
in the Spanish War, Dr. Stuart said
that he is still convinced that the
Rebels will win, and that when they
do, Britain and France will aid them
in driving all foreigners out of the
country.
"Either way, however," he said,
"the result will be the same. It
seems hardly logical to suppose that
either Britain or France, both of
whose empire life-lines depend on

REBELS WILL WIN

Touching briefly on the situation
in the Spanish War, Dr. Stuart said
that he is still convinced that the
Rebels will win, and that when they
do, Britain and France will aid them
in driving all foreigners out of the
country.
"Either way, however," he said,
"the result will be the same. It
seems hardly logical to suppose that
either Britain or France, both of
whose empire life-lines depend on
control of the Mediterranean, will
permit any foreign power to domi
nate Spain. Although their policy
toward the war has seemed vacil
lating. they have not declared
themselves for one side or the other
because they stand to win either
way. When the war ends they will !
aid the victorious government by j
every means at their disposal in its j
struggle to rid itself of foreign j
control."

NO EUROPEAN WAY

In conclusion, Dr. Stuart once
more affirmed belief that war
would not come to Europe at the
present time, and pointed out that
there is one significant lesson to be
learned from war-torn 1938.
"I think it has been definitely
proved," he said, "that, an aggres
sive war against a prepared enemy
is bound to be a long and expensive
process. Dictators can't afford long j
and ' expensive wars. Therefore, Ij
doubt very much if any of them will !
start one."

"If Britain and France stand firm,
Hitler won't fight. Germany couldn't,
last more than six months against a
major power, and he knows it."
This is the opinion of Dr. Graham
Stuart of the political science depart
ment, who sees in the restrength
ened attitude of Britain and France
toward Hitler's claims on Czechoslo
vakia the surest hope for European
peace.
"Hitler's speech Monday would
seem to indicate that he is willing
to leave the door open for a com
promise," Dr. Stuart said. "In line
with a policy of bluffing until his
hand is called, he has carefully
avoided committing himself to war,
and he has also refused to counte
nance the claims made by Poland
and Hungary. Despite the tone of
his speech, he has left himself free
to adjust his policy to the course of
events."

STRATEGIC FRONTIER

Commenting on the justice of Hit
ler's claims, Dr. Stuart pointed out
that the Czech Republic was a com
pletely artificial state, set up at Ver
sailles for the deliberate purpose of
blocking Germany to the east.
"To -achieve this, the Allies at
tempted what almost amounted to a
recreation of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire in miniature, tossing together
the Czechs, Slovaks, Ruthenians,
Magyars, and Poles in a conglom
erate state whose only real justifi
cation in their eyes was its strategic
frontier on the Sudeten Mountains.
Hitler is only following one of the
basic principles which have always
guided him, that of reabsorbing into
the Reich the Germans beyond its
borders; if he can be persuaded to
guarantee Czechoslovakia's new bor
ders, there would seem to be little
real justification for trying to stop
him.
"If he can't be persuaded to guar
antee those frontiers, of course, there
will be a showdown, in which case
unless he is completely insane, he
will almost certainly yield."

NO POLICY CHANGE

; Denying that the United States lias
I changed its foreign policy, or that it
j will come to the aid of Britain and
| France if war comes, Dr. Stuart .said
j that although those countries show a
strong tendency to interpret the re
marks of President Roosevelt and
Secretary Hull in that light, and al
though the interest of Washington is
centered for the moment on Europe,
the real problem before the State De
partment at the present time is the
Mexican oil seizures.
"Because he docs not wish to en
danger the President's good neigh
bor policy, Secretary Hull is taking
great care not to arouse too much
i hostility by his notes to the Cardenas
government. At the same time he is
striving to take a tone sufficiently
strong to preserve American pres
tige in Latin America."
"He knows that a lack of markets
will presently force President Car
denas to revise his policy if he
