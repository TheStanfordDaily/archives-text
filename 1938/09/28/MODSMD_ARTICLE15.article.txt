# Settlement by 5 a.m. P.S.T. Single Block to War

### 
BFRLIN, Wednesday, Sept. 28 (UP). â€”If was re
ported without confirmation today Fuehrer Adolf Hit
ler has decided to order his armies to march on Che
choslovakia immediately if there is 110 prospect of a
peaceful solution of the Czech crisis by 2 p.m. today
(5 a.m., Pacific Standard Time).
The report indicated the Nazi Fuehrer, angered hy
the tone of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's

* speech in London last night, had de
cided to strike quickly.
The only Nazi reaction to the
eleventh-hour plea of the British
premier, urging Germany not to go
to war over the Czech issue, but
warning Hitler Britain would fight
any nation that sought to dominate
Europe by force, was one of resent
ment and anger.
An official Nazi spokesman, com
menting on the Prime Minister's
address which was broadcast in Ger
many, said:
"I might suggest Mr. Chamber
lain's speech was intended largely
| for domestic consumption."

1,300,000 GERMANS ARMED

Any orders marshaling German
armed forces today are not expected
to constitute a general mobilization,
however, since Hitler already has
1,300,000 men under arms, virtually
exhausting his experienced troops.
Any reserves would have to be
drawn from older men of World War
experience, or the hundreds of thou
sands of Storm Troopers.

Military trucks and transports
rumbled along the Unter den Lin
den for more than three and a half
hours last night, heading westward
in the direction of the P'rench fron
tier.
They included complete communi
cations and provisons units, light
field pieces, heavy tanks and horse
trucks.

BERLINERS UNENTHUSIASTIC

Late homecoming crowds watched
the passage of the troops and trucks
in silence, with neither enthusiasm
nor demonstration. Other military
trucks moved into the outskirts of
Berlin, setting up anti-aircraft guns
and other defenses.
Foreigners were evacuating the
city as it became increasingly evi
dent that the Fuehrer would send
his army marching on Czechoslo
vakia this week to wrest the Sudo
tenland from the Czechs, a move
Britain and France have warned will
plunge Europe into a general war,
A government spokesman, deny
ing reports an extension in the Oct.
1 deadline was contemplated, indi
cated Hitler had set midnight Friday
as the deadline for Czechoslovakian
acceptance of his ultimatum.

HITLER REPLIES TO I D R.

The German Fuehrer's last de
fiance of efforts of the great demo
cratic nations, including the United
States, to bring about a peaceful
solution was contained in a reply to
President Roosevelt's peace message.
Hitler defended again his determina
tion to wrest the Sudeten areas from
the Czechs.
The reply concluded with these
ominous words:
"It lies not in the hands of the
German government, but in those of
the Czechoslovak government alone
to decide now whether they want
peace or war."
Although the British Prime Min
ister, Neville Chamberlain, through
his emissary to Ilitler, Sir Horace
Wilson, and in a radio broadcast
from London, strove desperately to
effect an eleventh-hour compromise,
most observers believed the die al
ready was cast.

REICH KEPT UNINFORMED

The German people, who thus far
hnve been guarded by strict censor
ship of all foreign news from any
real knowledge of the tense situa
tion, had believed until today the
Sudeten question would undoubted
ly be settled peacefully.
But as military preparations got
under way to the heart of Germany,
the alarm felt throughout Europe
burst upon the people and there was
evidence here of increased tension.
Foreigners, including Americans,
were using every available means to
get out of Germany. Scenes at tour
ist centers were reminiscent of the
dark days before Aug. 4, 1914.

EVACUATION STARTS

It was learned the American Em
bassy was arranging an organization
set-up to evacuate American civil
ians in the event of war.
The evacuation has assumed the
proportions of almost complete with
drawal of the British colony in Ber
lin, even including some newspaper
correspondents and their families.
The wives and children of Ameri
can Embassy staff members also
have departed from Berlin.
While foreigners were leaving,
military preparations were made for
defense of the capital against enemy
air raiders.
