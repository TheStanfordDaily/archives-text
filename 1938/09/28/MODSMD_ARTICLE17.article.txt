"My father loves to talk," remarked Mary Morris Boggs, Ruble sponsor,
recently returned from a tour of Japan, Korea, and Manehuria, "hut since
I came home, he hasn't had a word."
What was striking ahout Japan?
"The food, the beds, and some of the English signs!" she exclaimed.

"One tailor's sign read: 'xMeri and.
Women Have Fits Together Up
stairs.' Another read: 'We Make
Furs Out of Your Skin.'

"The people," she continued, "try
their best to use the English lan
guage— but the outcome is some
times amusing. At the bottom of one
laundry sheet v/as the announce
ment: 'We read the Bible everyday
and pray to God that we may serve
you with a clean body and pious
soul.'
"And how I loved," sarcastically
added Miss Boggs, "taking off my
shoes for meals, sleeping on rock
pile beds, and eating fish. For one
meal I had fried fish, dried fish, and
raw fish. Another meal had 24
courses which included jellyfish,
shark's fins, aged egg (which is like
ouB hard-boiled egg, only much
more potent), carp, whales' whis
kers (whatever they might be), and
fried eel.

"I love Jthe people," she continued,
"but I do not like their foreign pol
icy. Yes, we saw thousands of sol
diers every day, and had one prac
tice anti-air raid. There is, though,
in our country, I think, much un
warranted prejudice that is not fair
to the Japanese. I think Japan
mainly wants to co-operate with
China in unifying the East, and to
get some of the much needed min
erals from China.
"The war has lowered the stand
ards of living. There are many re
strictions and much curtailment of
gods, so that those at the front shall
be provided for. There are no for
eign movies, except those already in
Japan before the war broke out.

"The students were noticeably
liberal and progressive. They grasp
anything they can about western cul
ture. They are ciuizy about our
music — especially the classical, but
also the jazz. They are more en
thusiastic about the serious side of
college life than American'students
but they have their fun also.
Miss Boggs traveled with a group
which included six other Stanford
students: Jack Laney, Philip Wood
yatt, Perry Chisum, Buddy Iwata,
Hob Hartmann, and Ed Kerr.
