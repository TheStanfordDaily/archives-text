### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
SOUTHERN CAL
LIKES CAPTAINS

When the report comes from the
University of Southern California
that 21 of the freshman football
squad were former high school foot
ball captains, we can only wonder
how they got them, what they ex
pect to do with them, and where
they found all those high schools.
Stanford's frosh roster shows no
such record, but we do have our
share of ail-someplace selections.
Pete Kmetovic, a miniature Peter
Fay when it comes to cutting down
a field or changing pace, was not
only a fine sprinter at San Jose, but
was chosen on the all-P.A.L. team
three years in a row. And John
Sturgeon, another halfback on the
Papoose squad, was captain of his
team at Tulare high and an all
county selection.
Quarterback and fullback spots
are deep with crowned high school
stars. Paul Blanton was all-Arizona
and Art Rasmussen, brother of Neil,
wis an all-state prep choice. Rob
ert Crane, from Richmond, was
captain of the East Bay all-star
eleven. He figured in his high school
backfield, but he plays on the
Papoose line now.

PAPOOSE BACKS
HOLD HONORS

Baekfield stars Frank Albert and
Jiick Francis are obvious crown
holders. Albert holds all-Southern
California honors and Francis was
an all-San Francisco selection.
A colossal array of record holders
turned out for center, but by now
many have been shifted in order to
keep (he eleven best men on the
field at the same time. Colin Mc-
Clintock, now in possssion of the

frosh pivot spot, was all-Seattle,
while Winkie Jones and Doug Stahle
were all-city selections from Okmul
gee, Okla., and Oakland, respective
ly. Robert Wear was all-conference
selection from Huntington, Pa., and
Charles Reeve was high school cap
tain from Winton.
In guard spots Albert Boido, of
South San Francisco, was a second
all-P.A.L. choice, and Kenneth
Sayre, of Des Moines, was a main
stay of an undefeated team.

A LOG-ROLLING
CHAMP. TOO

When Harry Shipkey, frosh men
tor, was asked last spring what he
expected in the way of new grid
stars, all he could think of was Max
Schmidt, 6-foot-5 tackle from Shel
ton, Wash., and not because he was
a star gridderâ€”he was log-rolling
champ of Washington.
Tackle candidates included also
Doc Stolle, captain from Dixon high,
and Lee DeWitt, no relation to the
varsity center but a second all-state
selection from Sutter. DeWitt was
given a "most valuable player"
award for two years. Gene Bacon
was a second-string all-lowa choice
in the same post.
On the yearling flanks can be
found many high school honors. Ed
Wilson was all-Washington selection
from Aberdeen; Jim Murphy was
all-Southern California from Los
Angeles, Burt Talcott was all-Mon
tana; and Jack Harris was all-state
selection from Eureka. Larry Part
ridge, from North Carolina, was on
an undefeated prep team, and Mel
vin Ellett, from Inglewood, was a
second all-conference choice.
Notice the home-towns of this
year's freshman grid crop. Stan
ford attracted 25 from other states.
