## Odds Drop On Broncos; Pool Rambles Again Strong Bronc First Squad Handicapped By Weak Reserves 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor 
! Now that Hamp Pool is able to
| ramble again arid Bill Paulman con
j tinues to go through scrimmage after
J scrimmage without any recurrent
| injuries to his tricky ankles, those
San Jose odds of 2 to 1 against Stan
ford's Big Pied Machine have dwin-
I died to a point that may make the
j Indian-Santa Clara affair an even
money bet by game time Saturday.
Pool has gone through his first
I two heavy scrimmages of the entire
i fall prep campaign now and has
[ managed to come through in excel
j lent shape. His pass catching and
i powerful running drive seems to
leave little to be desired although
I he,still needs polishing as a blocker.

; BIIONC RESERVES WEAK

| TRIO OF KICKERS

I But even with Pool's fine come
! back, Hugh Gallarneau looks like
j the present first-string choice at
I right halfback. Gallarneau is per
| forming his chores better in each
scrimmage and might be the Indian
! dark horse necessary for the first
' Stanford win over the Broncos in
! three years.
From the Santa Clara camp comes
j information that the Bronc first
| string will be just as good or bet
l ter than that of last year with a sad
weakness of reserves. But if the
game should develop into a kicking
duel, Buck Shaw's men will un-
I doubtedly find themselevs in a tight
i spot without a punter in sight who
| can match the distance and accuracy
lof Chuck Pavelko, their great leg
j man of last season.

On the other hand, Stanford might
have Pete Fay, Bill Paulman, and
Glen Hamilton in a starting line-up,
which would mean that Thornhill
could call upon any of the trio and
still better the Bi'onc yardage.
The possibility of Hamilton start
ing depends upon the return of big
Norm Standlee to top shape. The
highly rated sophomore quarterback
still has his weak ankle under wrap.s
and hasn't entered contact work in
over a week.
Up in the line. Jack Clark and Bill
iMcElroy are still holding down the
j flanks with Stan Anderson and Pete
i Zagar in at tackle and Tony Cal
| velli at center. Bob Dakan and Dick
I Sutton remain at guard with B>
, West and Corky Donahue, now
j learned hands at both guard anc
j tackle, aching for a chance to plaj
either spot.
