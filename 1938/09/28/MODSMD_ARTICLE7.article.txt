# Cardinals Plan To Boom School Spirit
## 
### 
A full year of big events, includ
ing dances, bonfires, sports, and re
ceptions has been planned by
Cardinals, Stanford activity organi
zation, according to Roy Thomp
son, president.
Biggest aim of the year is to
heighten school spirit through social
functions, better attendance and in
creased interest in athletic events,
and plenty of good time in the prep
aration and carrying out of school
traditions such as Prc-Big Game
activities and the Convalescent
Home Drive.
Three main committees, the dance,
sport, and welcoming committees,
have been organized to carry out
the year's Cardinal functions.

DANCES LIMITED

CARD ORGANIZATION

Dances, (his year, will probably be
limited to one or two a quarter in
stead of the usual large number of
after-game dances or jolly-ups, in
order to gross larger returns.
Sports committee will work when
necessary with the Rally Committee
and co-operate in staging such large
events as the Big Game Rally.
Welcoming committee's duty will
be to welcome notables such as Con
cert Series artists, speakers, and vis
iting teams to the Farm.
Plans for disorganizing the big
annual Red Cross Drive on the
grounds that the student body is
assessed enough during the Conval
escent Home Drive, will be dis
cussed.

Cardinals was organized a few
years ago as an exclusively junior
senior group to forward and guide
Stanford extra-curricular activities
and promote school spirit. This or
ganization is allowed to select its
own members from underclassmen
on a merit basis, usually from among
those who have had Rally Commit
tee experience. Rally Committee
members, in turn, are narrowed
down into two groups, numbers
one and two, the former being first
and the latter being second choice.
Although Rally Committee mem
bership gives a certain amount of
preference, it is not a requisite.
"All freshmen who are anxious to
be future Cardinal members should
be sure to sign up for Rally Com
mittee this fall. Committee appoint
ments will be entirely democratic
and unbiased," emphasized Thomp
j son.
First Cardinal meeting probably
| will be held early next week.

Biggest aim of the year is to
heighten school spirit through social
functions, better attendance and in
creased interest in athletic events,
and plenty of good time in the prep
aration and carrying out of school
traditions such as Prc-Big Game
activities and the Convalescent
Home Drive.
Three main committees, the dance,
sport, and welcoming committees,
have been organized to carry out
the year's Cardinal functions.

DANCES LIMITED

CARD ORGANIZATION

Dances, (his year, will probably be
limited to one or two a quarter in
stead of the usual large number of
after-game dances or jolly-ups, in
order to gross larger returns.
Sports committee will work when
necessary with the Rally Committee
and co-operate in staging such large
events as the Big Game Rally.
Welcoming committee's duty will
be to welcome notables such as Con
cert Series artists, speakers, and vis
iting teams to the Farm.
Plans for disorganizing the big
annual Red Cross Drive on the
grounds that the student body is
assessed enough during the Conval
escent Home Drive, will be dis
cussed.

Cardinals was organized a few
years ago as an exclusively junior
senior group to forward and guide
Stanford extra-curricular activities
and promote school spirit. This or
ganization is allowed to select its
own members from underclassmen
on a merit basis, usually from among
those who have had Rally Commit
tee experience. Rally Committee
members, in turn, are narrowed
down into two groups, numbers
one and two, the former being first
and the latter being second choice.
Although Rally Committee mem
bership gives a certain amount of
preference, it is not a requisite.
"All freshmen who are anxious to
be future Cardinal members should
be sure to sign up for Rally Com
mittee this fall. Committee appoint
ments will be entirely democratic
and unbiased," emphasized Thomp
j son.
First Cardinal meeting probably
| will be held early next week.
Present Cardinal members arc
Mary Morris Boggs, Rovena Conn,
Mary Kay Horton, Didi Vibert, Bill
J Hawkins, Jack Laney, Andy Stoj
(kovich. Clint Olson, Ken Cuthbcrt-
I son. Dick Frank, Woody Miller, and
