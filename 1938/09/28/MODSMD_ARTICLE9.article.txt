With members of the Class of '38
at the top of the heap, contributions
to Stanford University through the
Stanford Fund at the end of the aca
demic year 1937-38 stood at $38,-
353.33, according to an announce
ment by George A. Ditz, '11, chair
man of the Stanford Fund commit
tee for annual appeal.
George A. Ditfc, Jr., was co-chair
man, with Rebecca Butts, of the
senior committee which last spring
turned in a contribution of $K65.30
from 388 members of the senior
class. This was 52.71 per cent of
the 736 seniors solicited. In percent
age contributed and in numbers con
tributed the Class of '38 led all 46
of the other Stanford classes in the
year's campaign for the Fund, it
was announced.

In commenting on the result of
the annual appeal for the Stanford
Fund, Mr. Ditz offered figures
showing that in 1938 a total of 23,423
alumni (including members of the
senior class) were solicited, of whom
2,389 contributed. In 1937, out of
23,452 solicited 1,369 contributed.
The 1938 total of contributions'to the
fund was $6,211 more than the 1937
total of $32,142.02.
"The number of alumni contribut
ing this year," Mr. Ditz noted,
"reached a total of almost 2,400 —
approximately 75 per cent greater
than last year. The total contribu
tions were approximately 20 per cent
greater than last yelir."
The Stanford Fund was organized
for work in the fall of 1936 as the
result of an intensive investigation
that had been made by a committee
of alumni into money-raising tech
niques used by other universities.
Purpose of the Stanford Fund is
to serve as a conduit for bringing
| gifts to Stanford from alumni and
| friends of the University into the
i hands of the Board of Trustees, to
j be used as the trustees deem best,
I or as the donor directs.

The Stanford Fund, therefore, is
an agency for obtaining financial re
sources for Stanford, and not an ac
cumulation of resources in itself. It
is an aid to Stanford in the ceaseless
competition for leadership and aca
demic excellence. It exists in recog
nition of the fact that the Stanford
endowment, impressive as it was in
1891, when the University opened its
gates, must be added to in order to
keep Stanford out in front.
The third annual appeal for the
Stanford Fund will be conducted
next spring, according to plans going
forward under the direction of the
committee for annual appeal.

at the top of the heap, contributions
to Stanford University through the
Stanford Fund at the end of the aca
demic year 1937-38 stood at $38,-
353.33, according to an announce
ment by George A. Ditz, '11, chair
man of the Stanford Fund commit
tee for annual appeal.
George A. Ditfc, Jr., was co-chair
man, with Rebecca Butts, of the
senior committee which last spring
turned in a contribution of $K65.30
from 388 members of the senior
class. This was 52.71 per cent of
the 736 seniors solicited. In percent
age contributed and in numbers con
tributed the Class of '38 led all 46
of the other Stanford classes in the
year's campaign for the Fund, it
was announced.

In commenting on the result of
the annual appeal for the Stanford
Fund, Mr. Ditz offered figures
showing that in 1938 a total of 23,423
alumni (including members of the
senior class) were solicited, of whom
2,389 contributed. In 1937, out of
23,452 solicited 1,369 contributed.
The 1938 total of contributions'to the
fund was $6,211 more than the 1937
total of $32,142.02.
"The number of alumni contribut
ing this year," Mr. Ditz noted,
"reached a total of almost 2,400 —
approximately 75 per cent greater
than last year. The total contribu
tions were approximately 20 per cent
greater than last yelir."
The Stanford Fund was organized
for work in the fall of 1936 as the
result of an intensive investigation
that had been made by a committee
of alumni into money-raising tech
niques used by other universities.
Purpose of the Stanford Fund is
to serve as a conduit for bringing
| gifts to Stanford from alumni and
| friends of the University into the
i hands of the Board of Trustees, to
j be used as the trustees deem best,
I or as the donor directs.

The Stanford Fund, therefore, is
an agency for obtaining financial re
sources for Stanford, and not an ac
cumulation of resources in itself. It
is an aid to Stanford in the ceaseless
competition for leadership and aca
demic excellence. It exists in recog
nition of the fact that the Stanford
endowment, impressive as it was in
1891, when the University opened its
gates, must be added to in order to
keep Stanford out in front.
The third annual appeal for the
Stanford Fund will be conducted
next spring, according to plans going
forward under the direction of the
committee for annual appeal.
