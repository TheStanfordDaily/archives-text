THIS CLIMACTIC MUNICH CONFERENCE, from which may come a
plan to end forever Europe's present war scare, is pictured here by
Acme drawin-Tclephoto. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Prcmeir Dala
dier, Fuehrer Hitler, and Premier Mussolini—the four men on whose
shoulders the fate of the world rests—are here about to start the peace
parley called by the Rcichsfuehrcr at almost the exact hour set for
Germany's march into Czechoslovakia yesterday morning.
