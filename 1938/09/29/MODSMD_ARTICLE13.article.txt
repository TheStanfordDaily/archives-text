# SENDS PERSONAL NOTE
## 
### 
More positive shades were added
today when it was revealed Mr.
Roosevelt had sent a personal note
to Premier Benito Mussolini of Italy
and possibly another to Japan, Ihe
two nations aligned with Germany.
The Mussolini note coincided with
an appeal from Chamberlain asking
II Duce to use his influence to bring
Hitler into a conference â€” a move
significantly in concert with Mr.
Roosevelt's hitherto secret maneuver.
At almost the same hour Secre
tary of SUite Cordcll Hull and Un
dersecretary Sumner Wells confer
red here with German Ambassador
Hans Henrich Dicckhoff, British
Ambassador Sir Ronald Lindsay,
Czech Minister Vladimir Hurban,
and French Ambassador Rene dc
Saint-Quentin, while American
emissaries were calling at the Rome,
Berlin, and Tokyo foreign offices.
