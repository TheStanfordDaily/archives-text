# DUCE OPENS WAY TO SETTLEMENT

ROME, Sept. 28 (UP). —Premier
Mussolini, in an eleventh hour in
tervention move, today helped
snatch Europe from the brink of
war over the Czech-German crisis,
reportedly ordered withdrawal of
Italian volunteers from Spain and
sped to Germany for a four-power
conference at Munich tomorrow.
The order for withdrawal of
troops from the Spanish civil war,
reported from high quarters, was
given the widest significance by ob
servers. It was believed it virtually
threw open the Munich conference
to a general settlement of European
problems.
It swept away the last obstacle to
fulfillment of the Anglo-Italian
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
i as the stepping stone to general Eu
' ropean appeasement.
j Mussolini made his decisive ac
tion alter receiving a last-minute
| message from Chamberlain and also
} a personal note from President
Roosevelt, presumably urging his
j intervention in the Czech-German
! crisis.
II Duce's action dispelled the
gloomy forebodings which had
: gripped Italy—diplomatically aligned
i with Germany, but having little
stomach for a war over an issue
I which hardly concerned Italians.
It was reported the withdrawal
of all Italian volunteers now fight
! ing with Generalissimo Francisco
j Franco's insurgent armies in Spain
! would be carried out immediately.
