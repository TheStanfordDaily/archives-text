• LONDON, ENGLAND; SEPTEMBER 29; HOUSE OF
COMMONS.
Today, as the world trembled on the brink of war, a tired
old man, tears streaming down his face, told the House of
Commons of his untiring, futile efforts to check disaster irom
rolling past the war-crazed boundaries of Germany over all
Europe.
Trembling with exhaustion, Neville Chamberlain told the
House of Commons of the unanswered pleas to Adolf Hitler
for the peace of the world. His voice broke as the House rose
to its feet to cheer those efforts, then subsided as he went
on to describe the cabled messages from President Roose
velt to Hitler, the four-power peace proposal made to Ger
many's insane leader.
As he continued, his tired voice telling of broken hope
after broken hope, a message was handed to Lord Halifax,
passed from hand to hand. The House reached an electrical
pitch. The weary recitation of failure continued until the
message reached Chamberlain's hand.
He stopped. Then, in a voice choked with emotion, he
read the portentous note, Hitler's acceptance of the new
peace conference proposal. While the House sat taut with
pent-up tension, he read the message which told the world
that war may be averted.
Today, the eyes of the world will be turned upon Munich
where Chamberlain, Daladier, Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler
will sit.
Every radio, every form of communication will be fo
cused on the meeting of four men who hold the fate of
Europe in their hands.
By midnight tonight Hitler's war force, mobilized on the
boundaries of Czechoslovakia, may have plunged eastward.
By midnight tonight the world may rejoice in the prospect
of peace.
The world that pitifully hopes will sit powerless, waiting.
The world that cynically thinks will pledge its aid to the
cause of the peace-makers around that table in Munich.
The world will be waiting.
Not four men but 500 million men and women will be
sitting round that table. They will be voiceless. Only four
can speak.
Only four men between war, a war more terrible than
can possibly be conceived in the wildest nightmare of
imagination. Only four voices, speaking quietly in an effort
to still the hysteria that awaits without.
Chamberlain, Daladier, Mussolini.
And Adolf Hitler.
Let the world pray.

He stopped. Then, in a voice choked with emotion, he
read the portentous note, Hitler's acceptance of the new
peace conference proposal. While the House sat taut with
pent-up tension, he read the message which told the world
that war may be averted.
Today, the eyes of the world will be turned upon Munich
where Chamberlain, Daladier, Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler
will sit.
Every radio, every form of communication will be fo
cused on the meeting of four men who hold the fate of
Europe in their hands.
By midnight tonight Hitler's war force, mobilized on the
boundaries of Czechoslovakia, may have plunged eastward.
By midnight tonight the world may rejoice in the prospect
of peace.
The world that pitifully hopes will sit powerless, waiting.
The world that cynically thinks will pledge its aid to the
cause of the peace-makers around that table in Munich.
The world will be waiting.
Not four men but 500 million men and women will be
sitting round that table. They will be voiceless. Only four
can speak.
Only four men between war, a war more terrible than
can possibly be conceived in the wildest nightmare of
imagination. Only four voices, speaking quietly in an effort
to still the hysteria that awaits without.
Chamberlain, Daladier, Mussolini.
And Adolf Hitler.
Let the world pray.
