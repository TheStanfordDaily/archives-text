"Security seems to l>c (he one thing that young people do not
want," declared President Ray Lyman Wilbur at the first all-Univer
sity assembly of the autumn quarter yesterday morning in Memorial
llall auditorium.
"For youth, security is often a form of semi-petrification," asserted
Dr. Wilbur. "Young people should be filled with the willingness to run

risks, and leave security for their#
later years. The opportunity to de- J
velop his personality to the fullest is.
what every young person wants."
