# HITLER BACKS DOWN, CALLS PEACE PARLEY
## Four European Headmen Rush To Conference Chamberlain Breaks News to World During Dramatic Speech to House 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 2X (UP). —Adolf Hitler suddenly opened the door to
peace today, at almost the exact hour he had set to send his armies
smashing into Czechoslovakia, by calling Europe's "Big Four" to meet in
Munich tomorrow for a showdown between the dictators and the de
mocracies.
At the last moment the German Chancellor stepped down from the

boldest and most defiant undertaking
of armed force in modern history.
He Rave Europe new hope of peace,
at a moment when every nation was
resigned to the inevitability of war,
by agreeing to delay at least 24 hours
the march of his troops who were to
have plunged across the Czech fron
tier today.
At Munich, where Naziism was
born in bloodshed 15 years ago, Hit
ler will sit down with Prime Min
ister Neville Chamberlain of Great
Britain, Premier Benito Mussolini
of Italy and Premier Edouard Dala
dier of France to seek a way out of
the headlong plunge toward war.

GREAT SENSATION

The announcement of Hitler's
abandonment of war plans today was
made by Prime Minister Chamber
lain in the House of Commons under
conditions more sensational than
anything that has ocucrred in the
"Mother of Parliaments" in its six.
and a half centuries of existence.
Chamberlain was speaking and
preparing the nation for war when a
messenger stumbled in, bearing
word of Hitler's new offer.
His hand shaking, the 69-year-old
Prime Minister read the message
that held out an unexpected hope
of peace—and then burst into tears.
Although he played no direct role
in the eleventh-hour development
that pulled Europe back from the
brink of war, President Roosevelt's
name stood out tonight in connection
with events leading up to it.
Mussolini immediately communi
cated with his brother-in-arms in
Berlin and to London was flashed
Hitler's decision to call ofT his in
vasion of Czechoslovakia until the
"Big Four" can thrash the matter out
at Munich.
Mussolini, already en route to Mu
nich by train, will enter the con
ference as the key figure of the
last-minute efforts for peace.
Committed to fight on Germany's
l side but fervently hopeful of peace,
the Italian dictator will be the likely
Due to undertake any mediation the
dictatorships and the democracies
may decide upon because until now
he has been outside the diplomatic
barterings on Hitler's price of peace.
The menace of war rested heavily
on ;ill Europe tonight, despite Mil
ler's surprise offer, because his ulti
matum stands with the "zero hour"
of an invasion of Czechoslovakia still
fixed for Saturday.
In Berlin, however, it was be
lieved that Der Fuehrer would ac
cept a "token withdrawal" of Czech
troops from the Sudetenland as a
basis for its peaceful surrender.
Chamberlain was making his long
speech before the members of the
House of Commons, summoned in
special session under a "state of
emergency" decreed by the King.

UNPARALLELED SITUATION

"Today we face a situation un
paralleled since 1914," he began, and
members leaped to their feet, cheer
ing and waving papers.
But the scene turned to one of
gravity as the weary and desperate
premier told how Hitler was ready
to invade the Sudetenland imme
diately—even as he spoke—and Der
Fuehrer had told him he was ready
to risk a world war rather than
wait for a settlement of the demands
upon the Czechs.
Chamberlain was unaware, at that
moment, Hitler's invitation for the
four-power meeting was being sped
to him.
As he talked members seemed
reconciled to inevitable war.

MESSENGER APPEARS

Suddenly a Foreign Office mes
senger came up the stairs to the
Peers' gallery and excitedly handed
a typed note to Viscount Halifax,
Foreign Secretary.
The document was handed along,
from row to row of the Government
benches and finally to Chamberlain.
For a moment, as a hush descended
upon the House, Chamberlain did not
glance at the document. He put it
down beside his speech.

"LAST APPEAL"

He was telling of his last appeal
to Hitler and to Mussolini.
"I offered to go at once myself to
Berlin to discuss arrangements with
German and Czech representatives
and, if the Chancellor (Hitler) so
desires, with representatives of Italy
and France," he said.
His voice quivered despite his ef
forts at restraint.
"In response," he announced, "Hit
ler has agreed to postpone mobiliza
tion for 24 hours. Whatever views
members may have had about Signoi
Mussolini in the past, I believe ev
eryone will welcome his gesture ir
being willing to work with us foi
the avoidance of war in Europe.
"This is not all. I have something
to say further to the House . . .

"I have now been informed by
Herr Hitler that he invites me to
meet him at Munich tomorrow. He
also has invited Mussolini and Dala
dier. Mussolini has accepted and I
have no doubt that Daladier also
will accept. ... I need not say
what my answer will be."
The House adjourned, in a wild
scene of enthusiasm and cheers for
Chamberlain, until Monday and as
Chamberlain slumped into his seat—
making no effort to brush tears from
his lined cheeks. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Sir John Simon, who
probably will be Britain's next Prime
Minister, leaned over and patted his
shoulder affectionately.

The House adjourned, in a wild
scene of enthusiasm and cheers for
Chamberlain, until Monday and as

LONDON, Sept. 2X (UP). —Adolf Hitler suddenly opened the door to
peace today, at almost the exact hour he had set to send his armies
smashing into Czechoslovakia, by calling Europe's "Big Four" to meet in
Munich tomorrow for a showdown between the dictators and the de
mocracies.
At the last moment the German Chancellor stepped down from the

boldest and most defiant undertaking
of armed force in modern history.
He Rave Europe new hope of peace,

born in bloodshed 15 years ago, Hit

the headlong plunge toward war.

GREAT SENSATION

The announcement of Hitler's
abandonment of war plans today was
made by Prime Minister Chamber
lain in the House of Commons under
conditions more sensational than
anything that has ocucrred in the
"Mother of Parliaments" in its six.
and a half centuries of existence.
Chamberlain was speaking and
preparing the nation for war when a
messenger stumbled in, bearing
word of Hitler's new offer.
His hand shaking, the 69-year-old
Prime Minister read the message
that held out an unexpected hope
of peace—and then burst into tears.
Although he played no direct role
in the eleventh-hour development
that pulled Europe back from the
brink of war, President Roosevelt's
name stood out tonight in connection
with events leading up to it.
Mussolini immediately communi
cated with his brother-in-arms in
Berlin and to London was flashed
Hitler's decision to call ofT his in
vasion of Czechoslovakia until the
"Big Four" can thrash the matter out
at Munich.
Mussolini, already en route to Mu
nich by train, will enter the con
ference as the key figure of the
last-minute efforts for peace.
Committed to fight on Germany's
l side but fervently hopeful of peace,
the Italian dictator will be the likely
Due to undertake any mediation the
dictatorships and the democracies
may decide upon because until now
he has been outside the diplomatic
barterings on Hitler's price of peace.
The menace of war rested heavily
on ;ill Europe tonight, despite Mil
ler's surprise offer, because his ulti
matum stands with the "zero hour"
of an invasion of Czechoslovakia still
fixed for Saturday.
In Berlin, however, it was be
lieved that Der Fuehrer would ac
cept a "token withdrawal" of Czech
troops from the Sudetenland as a
basis for its peaceful surrender.
Chamberlain was making his long
speech before the members of the
House of Commons, summoned in
special session under a "state of
emergency" decreed by the King.

UNPARALLELED SITUATION

"Today we face a situation un
paralleled since 1914," he began, and
members leaped to their feet, cheer
ing and waving papers.
But the scene turned to one of
gravity as the weary and desperate
premier told how Hitler was ready
to invade the Sudetenland imme
diately—even as he spoke—and Der
Fuehrer had told him he was ready
to risk a world war rather than
wait for a settlement of the demands
upon the Czechs.
Chamberlain was unaware, at that
moment, Hitler's invitation for the
four-power meeting was being sped
to him.
As he talked members seemed
reconciled to inevitable war.

MESSENGER APPEARS

Suddenly a Foreign Office mes
senger came up the stairs to the
Peers' gallery and excitedly handed
a typed note to Viscount Halifax,
Foreign Secretary.
The document was handed along,
from row to row of the Government
benches and finally to Chamberlain.
For a moment, as a hush descended
upon the House, Chamberlain did not
glance at the document. He put it
down beside his speech.

"LAST APPEAL"

He was telling of his last appeal
to Hitler and to Mussolini.
"I offered to go at once myself to
Berlin to discuss arrangements with
German and Czech representatives
and, if the Chancellor (Hitler) so
desires, with representatives of Italy
and France," he said.
His voice quivered despite his ef
forts at restraint.
"In response," he announced, "Hit
ler has agreed to postpone mobiliza
tion for 24 hours. Whatever views
members may have had about Signoi
Mussolini in the past, I believe ev
eryone will welcome his gesture ir
being willing to work with us foi
the avoidance of war in Europe.

"I have now been informed by
Herr Hitler that he invites me to
meet him at Munich tomorrow. He
also has invited Mussolini and Dala
dier. Mussolini has accepted and I
have no doubt that Daladier also
will accept. ... I need not say
what my answer will be."
The House adjourned, in a wild
scene of enthusiasm and cheers for
Chamberlain, until Monday and as
Chamberlain slumped into his seat—
making no effort to brush tears from
his lined cheeks. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Sir John Simon, who
probably will be Britain's next Prime
Minister, leaned over and patted his
shoulder affectionately.
LONDON, Sept. 2X (UP). —Adolf Hitler suddenly opened the door to
peace today, at almost the exact hour he had set to send his armies
smashing into Czechoslovakia, by calling Europe's "Big Four" to meet in
Munich tomorrow for a showdown between the dictators and the de
mocracies.
At the last moment the German Chancellor stepped down from the

boldest and most defiant undertaking
of armed force in modern history.
He Rave Europe new hope of peace,
at a moment when every nation was
resigned to the inevitability of war,
by agreeing to delay at least 24 hours
the march of his troops who were to
have plunged across the Czech fron
tier today.
At Munich, where Naziism was
born in bloodshed 15 years ago, Hit
ler will sit down with Prime Min
ister Neville Chamberlain of Great
Britain, Premier Benito Mussolini
of Italy and Premier Edouard Dala
dier of France to seek a way out of
the headlong plunge toward war.

GREAT SENSATION

The announcement of Hitler's
abandonment of war plans today was
made by Prime Minister Chamber
lain in the House of Commons under
conditions more sensational than
anything that has ocucrred in the
"Mother of Parliaments" in its six.
and a half centuries of existence.
Chamberlain was speaking and
preparing the nation for war when a
messenger stumbled in, bearing
word of Hitler's new offer.
His hand shaking, the 69-year-old
Prime Minister read the message
that held out an unexpected hope
of peace—and then burst into tears.
Although he played no direct role
in the eleventh-hour development
that pulled Europe back from the
brink of war, President Roosevelt's
name stood out tonight in connection
with events leading up to it.
Mussolini immediately communi
cated with his brother-in-arms in
Berlin and to London was flashed
Hitler's decision to call ofT his in
vasion of Czechoslovakia until the
"Big Four" can thrash the matter out
at Munich.
Mussolini, already en route to Mu
nich by train, will enter the con
ference as the key figure of the
last-minute efforts for peace.
Committed to fight on Germany's
l side but fervently hopeful of peace,
the Italian dictator will be the likely
Due to undertake any mediation the
dictatorships and the democracies
may decide upon because until now
he has been outside the diplomatic
barterings on Hitler's price of peace.
The menace of war rested heavily
on ;ill Europe tonight, despite Mil
ler's surprise offer, because his ulti
matum stands with the "zero hour"
of an invasion of Czechoslovakia still
fixed for Saturday.
In Berlin, however, it was be
lieved that Der Fuehrer would ac
cept a "token withdrawal" of Czech
troops from the Sudetenland as a
basis for its peaceful surrender.
Chamberlain was making his long
speech before the members of the
House of Commons, summoned in
special session under a "state of
emergency" decreed by the King.

UNPARALLELED SITUATION

"Today we face a situation un
paralleled since 1914," he began, and
members leaped to their feet, cheer
ing and waving papers.
But the scene turned to one of
gravity as the weary and desperate
premier told how Hitler was ready
to invade the Sudetenland imme
diately—even as he spoke—and Der
Fuehrer had told him he was ready
to risk a world war rather than
wait for a settlement of the demands
upon the Czechs.
Chamberlain was unaware, at that
moment, Hitler's invitation for the
four-power meeting was being sped
to him.
As he talked members seemed
reconciled to inevitable war.

MESSENGER APPEARS

Suddenly a Foreign Office mes
senger came up the stairs to the
Peers' gallery and excitedly handed
a typed note to Viscount Halifax,
Foreign Secretary.
The document was handed along,
from row to row of the Government
benches and finally to Chamberlain.
For a moment, as a hush descended
upon the House, Chamberlain did not
glance at the document. He put it
down beside his speech.

"LAST APPEAL"

He was telling of his last appeal
to Hitler and to Mussolini.
"I offered to go at once myself to
Berlin to discuss arrangements with
German and Czech representatives
and, if the Chancellor (Hitler) so
desires, with representatives of Italy
and France," he said.
His voice quivered despite his ef
forts at restraint.
"In response," he announced, "Hit
ler has agreed to postpone mobiliza
tion for 24 hours. Whatever views
