# IN AGREEMENT
## 
### 
Paris, London, and Rome were
said to be virtually in agreement
already on the proposal for an in
ternational "police force" and al
though Hitler wants to occupy the
Sudeten areas with his troops im
mediately, the plan offers a promis
ing basis for a compromise agree
ment.
With Mussolini's reported en
dorsement of the plan, it contains
hopes of bringing together the con
flicting German and Czech stands
that have driven the continent to
within a bayonet's length of war.
