# BLANKET AUTHORITY
## 
### 
President Eduard Benes of Czech
oslovakia was said to have given
Premier Edouard Daladier of France
virtual blanket authority to defend
Prague's rights at Munich today.
Praise for developing the Munich
meeting was divided among Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain of
Great Britain, President Roosevelt
and Premier Mussolini.
Mussolini's last-minute telephone
call to Berlin was believed to have
clinched Der Fuehrer's decision to
call the leaders of the four big pow
ers into conference.
