# CAMPUS OPINION
## "FOUNTAINS MUST GO" 
### 
The Editor. Sir:
The Time: September 29, 1938.
The Place: The center of a broad
expanse of unbroken concrete walk
approaching the Library.
The Scene: A small group of
roughly dressed sons of the farm,
their faces tanned by California
sun, kneel reverently as though in
prayerful thanksgiving.
The Occasion: The laying of a
small plaque of bronze, neatly in
scribed with the words, "In Memory
of the Library Fountain, Erected
j September 1938 as Gift of the Class
es of 1928, 1929, 1930, and 1934, and
; Removed as Gift of 1939."
Need this be a dream?
Remember the opening pages of
the College issue of Life a year or
so ago, of all the pictures at the
disposal of the editors of Life, they
chose our library as seen from the
quad as the picture appropriate to
begin their college issue—chose it
above all others because of its
beauty, simplicity, and charm.
But now our campus has been
defiled!
Our most cherished soil desecrat
ed by a monstrosity in concrete.
Shall we stand idly by? Clearly—
; THE FOUNTAIN MUST GO!
