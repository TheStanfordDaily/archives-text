# Jolly-Up Set For Transfers
## Ozzie Secrest's Band To Play for Dance 
### 
Junior transfer women and all
men on the campus will dance to
night to the music of Ozzie Secrest's
14-piece orchestra from 7 to 8
o'clock in the Women's Gym.
The jolly-up is part of the Junior
Orientation program. Only transfer
women ;We invited.
New innovation for this jolly-up
will be a "change partners" at the
end of each dance group. However,
cutting .in is still encouraged.
Vocalist with the orchestra, which
has played at Belmonte, the Coco
nut Gi'ove, and Casa del Rey Hotel,
is Bob Gray. Gray was winner of
the Roger Pryor contest for entrants
from Stanford, California, and San
Mateo Junior College.
Secrest's orchestra represents
Stanford, San Mateo, and San Jose
State territory for the Associated
College Orchestras, Coast to Coast.
It also broadcasts over the Mutual
Broadcasting System every Saturday
night.
