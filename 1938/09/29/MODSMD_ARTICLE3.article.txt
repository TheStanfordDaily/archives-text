# DISCUSSES UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
Speaking before a capacity audi
ence of students and members of the
faculty, the President discussed the
early development of Stanford, the
changes that have taken place on the
campus, and explained the position
of the University in relation to
present world conditions.
"Although Stanford is a separate,
apparently independent community,
it is linked very closely with events
that are going on about us. We ap
pear to be mere spectators, but ac
tually wc are participants," declared
the speaker, "and the University and
the students can take a creditable
part in these important events."
That development of the charac
teristics of self-management and
self-control constitute the funda
mental key to success is the opinion
of Dr. Wilbur, who placed the re
sponsibility for attaining this suc
cess squarely up to the individual.
