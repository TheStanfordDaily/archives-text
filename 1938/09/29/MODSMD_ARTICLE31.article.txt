JUDGE APPOINTED

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 28 (UP).—
Superior Judge Lloyd Griffin of San
Diego today was named to a judge
ship in the Fourth District Appel
late Court by Governor Merriam.
While tabs drifted in from the
southland regarding monstrous line
men scaling 300 pounds on the Po
mona Junior College roster, Coach
Harry Shipkey yesterday announced
the line-up that would start Satur
day's season opener against the
jaysee squad.
With Ed Wilsjn and Larry Part
ridge, first and «econd string right
ends, the only ifcen on the squad
handicapped by Injuries, Shipkey
switched Fred Me\fcr from the other
flank to fill the* gup. Burt Talcott
moves into the, sarting berth on the
left extremity. However, both Wil
son and Partridge are in good
enough :shape to be used, if neces
sary. f'

TACKLES STRONG

Shipkey is well satisfied with
Tackles Frank Kadditz and Wing
Jones, two big, powerful boys who
are equally aggressive on both of
fense and defense. According to
Shipkey, the tackles and ends pre
sent ho worry at all, but his light
guards are a source of doubt.
Yank Levin moves into the regu
lar guard berth for Saturday's
game, but Bob Crane is closely
pressing him. Dave Patterson will
be Levin's mate at the opening
whistle. Rangy Colin MeClintock
slips into the pivot position to com
plete the line.
Although he's not sure that it's his
best outfit, Shipkey will start the
following backfield: quarter, Jack
Francis; halves, John Sturgeon and
Pete Kmetovic; fullback, Frankie
Albert.

CARDS OUTWEIGHED

The Papoose line average will be
around 185 pounds, with the backs
tipping the Fairbanks at the measley
average of 167. Pomona's line will
weigh in at a 194-pound average,
although its pony backfield will
average only 156 pounds.
Backing up the regulars will be
ihe following reserve teams:
Second team—Ends, Mel Ellett
and Ed Wilson; tackles. Max Schmidt
and Lee DeWitt; guards, Bob Crane
and Bob Heringer; center, Doug
St a hie. Quarterback, Russ Smith;
