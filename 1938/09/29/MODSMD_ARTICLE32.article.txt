# Lockwood Sees Indian Tennis Men in Action
## 
### 
With the commencement of regu
; lar tennis classes yesterday, Varsity
; Coach Sherm Lockwood announced
1 that he will institute tennis chal
lenge ladders for both varsity and
! frosh players within the next few
| weeks.
Lockwood said that the ladder sys-
I tem was intended to afford compe
: tition for players trying out for the
| first teams and at the same time it
; would serve to give him an idea of
! the relative merits of the players.
Captain Jim Seaver and three
other junior lettermen, Dave Brock,
! Lloyd Gates, and Myron Folsom,
are expected to head the varsity
list. Other returning lettermen who
saw action in one or both of the
Cal contests last season are Jack
Laney and Sherwood Armstrong.
In addition to these players,
there will be several sophomores
fighting for positions. Neil Ballard,
captain of last year's outfit, Bob Low,
Stan Owen, and several others are
sexpected to be in the money for
posts when the season opens after
Christmas, according to Lockwood.
Players wishing to compete on
one of the ladders will be able to
sign up on the tennis bulletin board
in the Encina Gym. All matches
will be the best of three sets and
winners will be held responsible for
posting results.
