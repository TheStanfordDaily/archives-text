## JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor Soph Quarterback May Play Saturday 
### 
The possi!>ility of Norm Standee's .starting at quarterback Saturday
against Santa Clara appeared to be almost a certainty yesterday afternoon
as the promising sophomore ran through an hour's signal drill looking
in finer form than he has shown in the past two weeks.
Standlee. victim of a twisted ankle, alternated with Glenn Hamilton
and left the field early for heat treatments, but he should be in top shape
before the next 4<S hours have^

passed. Although Hamilton is con
sistently the best passer on the
squad, his defensive ability and line
smashing ability don't measure up
to that of Standlee.
