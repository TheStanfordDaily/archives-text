# PASS DEFENSE
## 
### 
Tiny Thornhill and the rest of the
coaching staff completely ignored
the first team as they prepared a
pass defense against Santa Clara
plays.. It was the second night in a
row in which the starting line-up
was allowed to pick its own plays
without any supervision.
Hamilton, Pete Fay, and Bill
Paulman were all flinging accurate
passes with Hugh Gallarneau, first
left-handed Indian in many a moon,
being kept in reserve. So with
three ace right-handers, four good
running backs, one lefty, and three
excellent kickers in the first five
backfield men, chances of a diversi
fied Cardinal attack are more than
probable.
