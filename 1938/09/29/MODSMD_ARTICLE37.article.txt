### 
A second string backfield of Gene
Coldiron, Freddie Ledeboer, Hamp
Pool, and Thor Peterson worked
with the coaches in perfecting the
pass defense. On the same second
team were Bill Willard and Andy
Stojkovich at end, By West, Ed Jo
hannessen, and Corky Donahue at
tackle, Bill Braheny and Don Mc-
Millan at guard and Wally DeWilt
at center. Incidentally, Stojkovich
is fighting hard to take over Bill
McEiroy's right flank job on the top
team, but McEiroy's experience and
height have aided him considerably
in holding down his job.
Off the practice field the odds ex
perts still refused to offer more
than even money on either the
Broncs or Stanford. Performances
of squads in both camps indicate
that the game will start as a virtual
toss-up.
