# Bugge Surveys Fencing Turnout
## 
### 
Fencing chances looked high yes
terday as Coach Elwyn Bugge took
a pre-practice survey and found 25
returning foilsmen and 12 new en
thusiasts out. Coach Bugge pointed
out, however, that there are still a
few vacancies and asked for expe
rienced players particularly to turn
out at once.
Two of last year's varsity swords
men, Edwin Woods and Merton
Davies, have joined the Olympic
Club team this season and will
probably see competition against the
Cards later in the quarter. Davies
is a graduate student here this year.
The fencing schedule is being made
up now and will be announced next
week.
