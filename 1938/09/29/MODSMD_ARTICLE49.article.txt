# Weeds in Stanford's Hair
## 
### 
THIS summer, the Corporation Yard hustled
about and painted up some of Stanford's dull
ing walls. Yesterday, Dean Bunn's early-quarter
retouching of fading legal sign-posts was noted
in this column.
Right in line, today The Daily will take paint
brush in hand to slap a new finish on one of
Stanford's few remaining traditions, the one
that says:
THERE SHALL BE NO SMOKING ON THE
QUAD.
To freshmen and transfers, that little edict
may be new. They may step down from the
prisoner's bench, paroled on the grounds of
ignorance (very poor grounds).
But others may not be dealt with so sum
marily.
It should be needless to remind them that
the tradition originally sprang from a request
by Mrs. Stanford that there should be no smok
ing within the walls of the Quad she loved.
For those considering themselves part of Stan
ford's heritage, that should be reason enough
to keep the tradition alive.
But there is a good business-like reason to
back it up. Smoking on the Quad constitutes
a fire hazard that cannot be overlooked. The
risk of fire-gutted buildings is too omnipresent
to be casually neglected.
To us, though, there is even a better reason
for following the sentimental, business-like tra
dition, a reason well illustrated by the sight of
Joe Campus, stepping from the Administration
Building, cigarette already in mouth as the
door swings open, and match poised to strike
as soon as his foot is one inch outside the
arches.
He's making an ass of himself by his lack of
self-control.
He's the lad who, grilled by a final, can't go
on unless he gets his drag or two.
He's the lad who, though he has learned how
to smoke, has failed to master the rudiments of
being a gentleman about it.
Smoking, like other codes of gentlemen, has
its own rules, founded mainly on courtesy; in
this case, courtesy to Mrs. Stanford's memory,
and to the administrators of Stanford's valuable
property.
No gentleman is discourteous.
