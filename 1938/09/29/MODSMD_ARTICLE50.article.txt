# Mushrooms Come High
## 
### 
FOR 2500 dollars, you can buy a great deal
ol very valuable objects. The classes of '28,
'29, '30, and '34 thought that a fountain was a
very valuable object, and cheap at half the
price. So there is a fountain in front of the
Library, as Insulted points out bluntly in Cam
pus Opinion,
It must have been quite a shock for returning
Stanfordites, unsuspecting and mentally re
laxed, to return after summer vacation and find
the concrete mushroom on the Library walk.
Quite a shock.
If they had stopped to figure a little bit, they
might have added to that shock by a little
simple arithmetic to the effect that:
(1) $2500 will send 21 students to school for
one quarter, or seven for a year, with cigarette
money left over.
(2) $2500 will buy nearly 700 library books at
University Bookstore prices.
(3) $2500 will buy about half of a new boat
house, perhaps more.
(4) $2500 will put grass in the Inner Quad.
(5) $2500 will pay for microscopes, delicate
apparatus, costly laboratory equipment.
But, instead, $2500 bought a fountain.
