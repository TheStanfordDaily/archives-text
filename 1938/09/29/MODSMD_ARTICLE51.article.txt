# Comes the Deluge

SOMETHING funny's going on around here,
something very funny. For what is probably
Ihe first time in Stanford's history, campus lead
ers have been overwhelmed with freshmen
looking for jobs.

In every activity now under way, the frosh
are taking hold in an unheard-of manner. Pro
fessor Allen, over in the music department,
reports a frosh sign-up for his choir which is
record-breaking. At The Daily, first-year men
and women have been mobbing the Shack long
before tryouts are scheduled. At the Quad and
Concert Series offices, they are practically
sweeping them out to make room for the
bosses.
Socially, the frosh are digging out in a way
which puts smooth upperclassmen to shame.
Roble has been playing to a capacity crowd
nearly every night—one can hardly fight his
way to the door when 10:30 rolls around.
In every way, it looks like one of those ter
rific years.
But, lest such comment wreak more evil than
good, experienced Stanfordites may prepare a
warning finger to wag at the freshmen. They
will justly ask for Bawlout figures in a quarter
or two before they join the band wagon of
praise for such an early interest in Stanford's
activities.
But the optimists will point out that the en
ergy evidenced by such early turnouts for
extra-curricular activities probably will carry
over to the trifling matter of getting an educa
tion. People smart enough to jump the pack
on tryouts are likely to be smart enough to
know what they came to Stanford for.
No matter how you figure the future, though,
you have to return to the outstanding fact in the
matter —the frosh are going to town in a big
way.
It's a long way to town.
