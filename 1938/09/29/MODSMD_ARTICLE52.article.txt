# BULL SESSION
## SWEET AND SOUR GRIPES 
### JOHN COBBS 
|"|R. WILBUR covered a good deal of ground in his
speech yesterday morning, and the broadside he
let go at "gripers" was only a casual one, but most of
us had the feeling that what he condensed into one
comment could have taken up the hour by itself.
As I bolted out of the Hall my mental rolling
stock began to make up a train of thought, and by
lunch time I was convinced that the philosophy of
griping might be worth a little meditation and re
search.
The brother on my left was muttering incoherently
about the freshman women. The brother on my right
was trying to be bitterly sarcastic about the luncheon
menu, but was making heavy weather because his
mouth was full. And so I was free to speculate on
the place of the gripe in the mod«rn world.
♦ * * •
IT IS impossible, of course, to set up a classification
without considerable research. The field will never
become really respectable until Ph.D. theses have em
balmed it piece by piece. But as an initial step we
can divide gripes into two rough classes—benign and
malignant.
Dr. Wilbur referred to the malignant type yester
day. And his comments showed remarkable self
control and restraint, even for a college president.
In a world that finds it hard to stagger on in spite
of ditcators, no-parking signs and lock-out rules, it
is the useless and misdirected complaints that make
life in a monastery sound like a beautiful dream.
There is always a steady barrage of this kind of
complaint. Alumni, of the variety that wears moth
chewed rooters' caps to games, feel themselves divinely
commissioned to manage the football team. Business
men who never went near a college, unless it was
to deliver a package, decide that it is their patriotic
duty to purge the colleges of contaminating "radi
calism."
Dr. Wilbur spoke very softly.
* * * *
But there is the other kind of gripe, the benign.
And here we have a definitely onwards-and-upwards
influence. Thoughtful and well-aimed griping has
prodded man along ever since the time the first sjone
age husky decided that a stalagmite made a poor sort
of bed and a cave bear a poor sort of bedfellow.
If there were no intelligent complaining, we would
sit in beautiful meditation, congratulating ourselves
on having the good taste to be born into such a glo
rious world. We would stay exactly that way until
some nasty, discontented barbarians came around to
take over.
My speculation had reached this point when the
brother on my right got his mouthful past his larynx,
and began to talk intelligibly. I classified his griping
as malignant and left, abruptly.

without considerable research. The field will never
become really respectable until Ph.D. theses have em
balmed it piece by piece. But as an initial step we
can divide gripes into two rough classes—benign and
malignant.
Dr. Wilbur referred to the malignant type yester
day. And his comments showed remarkable self
control and restraint, even for a college president.
In a world that finds it hard to stagger on in spite
of ditcators, no-parking signs and lock-out rules, it
is the useless and misdirected complaints that make
life in a monastery sound like a beautiful dream.
There is always a steady barrage of this kind of
complaint. Alumni, of the variety that wears moth
chewed rooters' caps to games, feel themselves divinely
commissioned to manage the football team. Business
men who never went near a college, unless it was
to deliver a package, decide that it is their patriotic
duty to purge the colleges of contaminating "radi
calism."
Dr. Wilbur spoke very softly.

But there is the other kind of gripe, the benign.
And here we have a definitely onwards-and-upwards
influence. Thoughtful and well-aimed griping has
prodded man along ever since the time the first sjone
age husky decided that a stalagmite made a poor sort
of bed and a cave bear a poor sort of bedfellow.
If there were no intelligent complaining, we would
sit in beautiful meditation, congratulating ourselves
on having the good taste to be born into such a glo
rious world. We would stay exactly that way until
some nasty, discontented barbarians came around to
take over.
My speculation had reached this point when the
brother on my right got his mouthful past his larynx,
and began to talk intelligibly. I classified his griping
as malignant and left, abruptly.
|"|R. WILBUR covered a good deal of ground in his
speech yesterday morning, and the broadside he
let go at "gripers" was only a casual one, but most of
us had the feeling that what he condensed into one
comment could have taken up the hour by itself.
As I bolted out of the Hall my mental rolling
stock began to make up a train of thought, and by
lunch time I was convinced that the philosophy of
griping might be worth a little meditation and re
search.
The brother on my left was muttering incoherently
about the freshman women. The brother on my right
was trying to be bitterly sarcastic about the luncheon
menu, but was making heavy weather because his
mouth was full. And so I was free to speculate on
the place of the gripe in the mod«rn world.
