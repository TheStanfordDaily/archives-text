### JOHN CLINE 
A FTER a quick glimpse of San Francisco's slums and
fallen women, we ventured up on Nob Hill one
evening to see how the other half lives.
There, in a swank hos'elry, we accosted Skinnay
Ennis, one of Stanford's favorite orchestra leaders.
"Can you spare a few moments for an interview, Mr.
Ennis?" we asked.
"Suah," he answered with that soft Carolina drawl
of his—"Stick around."
After he had spoken to several dowagers, a debu
tante, and a sound technician, he got around to us.
"Haven't much time—broadcast in three minutes—
but what do yo' all want to know?" he asked, grinning.
Question. "Weren't you with Hal Kemp at the
Virginia Military Institute two years ago, for their
Fall Homecoming Dance?"
Answer. "Yep, ah played the trap drums for Hal
Kemp 12 years, and we hit V.M.I, a couple of times."
"You a southerner?"
"Bohn in Nawth Carolina—went to Nawth Caro
lina U. That's wheah we started ouah band."
"Who's going to win the Stanford-Santa Clara game
this year?"
"Ah wouldn't know, but ah heah these Santa Clara
boys are pretty hot."
"How long will you remain in San Francisco, Mr.
Ennis?"
"Aboot seven mo weeks—but we fly to Los Angeles
twice a week to keep a radio contract with Bob Hope
—Pepsodent y' know. We just finished ouah Ches
terfield contract."
"Are you interested in pictures?"
"We plan to make a picture for Paramount in the
neah future."
About this time, the announcer was gesturing fran
tically, so Skinny got up to broadcast.
"Thanks for the interview, Mr. Ennis," we said.
"Yo welcome—always glad to see the Stanford
boys, he yelled over his shoulder as he hurried
uw.ty.
