# Critic Finds Depth, Art In "Candida"
## 
### 
"CANDIDA," currently playing at
San Francisco's Curran and star
ring Ami Harding:
After some of the mallarkey of
the past two seasons, this revival of
Shaw's "Candida" is bound to show
up like fire-sale type in the London
Times.
Not only is the show well cast and
excellently acted, but the play itself

has a literary
roundness uncom
mon in a novel,
unusual in any
work of art, and
darned near un
heard of in the
theater. The emo
tional and intel
lectual conflict of
its three main
characters is not

predominantly theatrical —it is too
subtle and elaborate for that. But
for some reason, "Candida's" in
overt reflection on life projects be
yond the footlights.

SMUGNESS SHATTERED

The story deals with a clergyman
who is toppled from smug aceeptance
of his happy life by an adolescent
poet who falls in love with his wife.
The problem has many ramifica
tions: the poet, often melodramatic
and lily-livered, is unworthy and
yet strong in his pbetic gift.
With the canniness of a child and
the imagination of the artist, he
asks the clergyman to help him win
Candida. Although he feels for her
husband when she thoughtlessly
makes him suffer, he has sense
enough to plead his own loneliness
and desolation when it comes time
for the heroine to choose between
them.

COMES REUNION

Candida realizes finally that her
husband, for all his prayer-book
nobility, is the poorer spirit.
Ann Harding's interpretation of
the part surprised me. 1 had expect
ed the song-and-dance she gets
away with on the screen—the con
ventional "understanding" woman,
lushly sympathetic, over-perceptive,
and long-suffering. Her Candida is
pitched to an entirely different key.
She portrays a plump, matter-of
fact housewife, like all honest and
really womanly women, not very
glamorous. Her performance is
sound and real.

CAVANAGH FOUND GLIB

Paul Cavanagh gave a firm and
technically fine characterization of
the husband. But he seemed at times
a little facile, more of a shrewd
showman than an understanding
interpretor.
Clay Mercer, on the other hand,
needs seasoning and finesse. But,
callow, foolish, emotionally sloppy,
and deeply sensitive by turns, he
made a vivid Marchbanks.
