WASHINGTON, Sept. .'JO (UP).
—Czechoslovak officials said to
night their government has sent
a note to the United States ex
pressing readiness to cede to Ger
many that part of its territory in
habited hy more than 50 per cent
of Germans hut has suggested if
negotiations still fail the issue he
presented to President Roosevelt
for arbitration.
MUNICH, Friday, Sept. 30 (UP).—
Britain, France, Germany and Italy
early today signed a compromise
agreement for surrender of Czecho
slovakia's strife-torn Sudeten areas
to Germany without bloodshed.
The agreement of the "Big Four,"
racing against time to head off a
general war, came only 24 hours be
fore the Oct. 1 "zero hour" fixed by
Adolf Hitler for an invasion of the
Sudetenland.
Germany's occupation of the Su
deten areas with a "token force" of j
Nazi troops will begin Saturday—
the day millions had looked forward
to with fright as the beginning of
war—and must be completed by
Oct. 10.
ANNOUNCEMENT AT 12:.J0
Announcement of the signing of
the agreement was made by Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain of
Great Britain at 12:30 a.m. as he
emerged, weary but smiling, from
the brownstone Fuehrerhaus where
the four statesmen had worked
through the day and most of the
night.
Arrangements wjare made to dis- :
patch the plan to the Czechoslovak
government in Prague before dawn. I
Thus the decision of peace or war
no longer rests with Fuehrer Adolf
Hitler, but is up to Px-esident Eduard
Benes and the Czech government.
The conferees of the four western
powers—Hitler, Chamberlain, Px-e
-mier Mussolini of Italy and Premier
Edouard Daladier of France—were
confident Czechoslovakia would be
prevailed upon to accept the deci- (
sion.
MODULATES DEMANDS
Britain and France will be able to
tell Prague they have prevailed upon
Hitler to modulate his warlike de
mands and ultimatums and compro
mise in a plan of peaceful settle
ment. - .
Mussolini, who played a major role
in bringing about the eleventh-hour
escape from a war that threatened
the lives of millions, left for home
immediately after the conference
aboard his special train. Chamber
lain and Daladier planned to fly back
to Paris and London today to re
port to their cabinets.
