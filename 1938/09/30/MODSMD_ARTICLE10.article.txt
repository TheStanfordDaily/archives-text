# Debaters To Discuss Anglo-American Treaty
## 
### 
The first debate question for the year, as stated by Professor Lee
Chapm, debate coach, is "Resolved, that an Anglo-American mutual as
sistance pact in case of aggression will work for the best interests of
world peace." ..
1 ,h ! ck _ s St r rain ;, de,)atc presented an oullnic of debates con-

templated for the year. Most out-<
standing of all off-campus debate I
activities will be the trip to the Ha
waiian Islands and the ensuing con
tests to be held there.
MOST TRIPS SHORT
Strain emphasized the fact that,
with the exception of the Hawaiian
trip, all trips will be shorter and
more frequent, thus permitting any
one who is truly interested and
who has any ability whatsoever to
participate in one or more contests
during the year.
The most novel feature of this
years schedule will be a contest
with an American Indian debate
team on the question of respective
living conditions. It is hoped that
each team will have an opportunity
to study at first hand the conditions
under which the other team lives!
before the debate.
RADIO DEBATES SET
Several debates will be held over
the radio. In about two weeks, de
baters will compete in the Radio De
bate League, to be broadcast by Mu
tual stations on the Pacific Coast.
Later in the quarter, there will be
a debate with the University of Chi
cago by means of the airlines; and
in the latter part of February, a meet
will be held with the University of
Edinburgh by means of transoceanic!
radio.
The revival of the annual Sopho- |
more-Freshman debate will be a !
definite point of interest this year, j
according to Professor Chapin.
Traditional debate activities will i
take a team to the Northwest to i
compete with the Universities of
Oregon and Washington, and also to
meet teams in Canada. Five persons
will travel to Los Angeles to de
bate teams from U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
and any other of the southern school
teams for which they may have time.
Another group of five will partici
pate in the competition at the Pa
cific Forensic League Tournament at
Pomona this year.
Local debates will include com
petition with the University of
California for the Mcdaille JofTre
in the Memorial Hall and the Com
monwealth Club debate in San
Francisco.
Professor Chapin and Strain arc
still anxious for anyone who is in
terested to sec one of them as soon j
as possible.

The first debate question for the year, as stated by Professor Lee
Chapm, debate coach, is "Resolved, that an Anglo-American mutual as
sistance pact in case of aggression will work for the best interests of
world peace." ..
1 ,h ! ck _ s St r rain ;, de,)atc presented an oullnic of debates con-

templated for the year. Most out-<
standing of all off-campus debate I
activities will be the trip to the Ha
waiian Islands and the ensuing con
tests to be held there.
MOST TRIPS SHORT
Strain emphasized the fact that,
with the exception of the Hawaiian
trip, all trips will be shorter and
more frequent, thus permitting any
one who is truly interested and
who has any ability whatsoever to
participate in one or more contests
during the year.
The most novel feature of this
years schedule will be a contest
with an American Indian debate
team on the question of respective
living conditions. It is hoped that
each team will have an opportunity
to study at first hand the conditions
under which the other team lives!
before the debate.
RADIO DEBATES SET
Several debates will be held over
the radio. In about two weeks, de
baters will compete in the Radio De
bate League, to be broadcast by Mu
tual stations on the Pacific Coast.
Later in the quarter, there will be
a debate with the University of Chi
cago by means of the airlines; and
in the latter part of February, a meet
will be held with the University of
Edinburgh by means of transoceanic!
radio.
The revival of the annual Sopho- |
more-Freshman debate will be a !
definite point of interest this year, j
according to Professor Chapin.
Traditional debate activities will i
take a team to the Northwest to i
compete with the Universities of
Oregon and Washington, and also to
meet teams in Canada. Five persons
will travel to Los Angeles to de
bate teams from U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
and any other of the southern school
teams for which they may have time.
Another group of five will partici
pate in the competition at the Pa
cific Forensic League Tournament at
Pomona this year.
Local debates will include com
petition with the University of
California for the Mcdaille JofTre
in the Memorial Hall and the Com
monwealth Club debate in San
Francisco.
Professor Chapin and Strain arc
still anxious for anyone who is in
terested to sec one of them as soon j
as possible.
