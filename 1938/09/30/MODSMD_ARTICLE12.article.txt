riod.
Graduate Manager A 1 Masters, in
augurating the early sale dates, an
nounced that every student is en
titled to one rooter's and four gen
eral admission tickets to the Big
j Game. For the Southern California
I affair, each student body card en
titles the owner to one rooter's and
six general admission tickets.

the sale, each buyer is being lim
ited to two student body cards. The
new system promises to do away
with block ticket buying such as
was prevalent last season.
