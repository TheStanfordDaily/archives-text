# Grid Opener Finds Cards Set To End Two- Year Jinx
## Indians Ready with Best Backs Since Vow-Boys, Strong Line 
### ARCH JENKINS 
i! y usanc * g ri diron fans are expected to watch the new Big Red
Machine in the Stanford stadium tomorrow afternoon when Santa Clara's
two-time Sugar Bowl champions seek their third straight Cardinal win.
f'or Buck Shaw's Broncos the game will mark an attempt to lengthen
a victory string that has already reached eleven in a row. For Tiny Thorn
hill and the Indians, ovith the greatest backfield since the Vow Boys, it
will be an attempt to gather steam for a campaign that could easily lead
to a conference championship and a Rose Bowl bid.
But a fiist-game defeat could just as easily lead to a season of mediocre
caliber.
The memory of that Santa Clara triumph back in 1936 still lingers.
Stanford entered the game as a triple Rose Bowl team. The Broncos had
an untried coach and a green team but announced their, intention to "get
the Rose Bowl champs"—and they got them.
Last year it was the same story. This year the Indians arc the under
dogs facing a team of champions. The tables have turned.

Thornhill will open with a team of veterans of which six were first
string last year and one was a potential All-American end two years ago.
Of the other four, three are wholly inexperienced in varsity play and one
alternated between first and second strings last year.
Shaw will have to rely on what was his second team last year. By
his own word, however, he has declared that his second men were just
about as good as his top team. His prime difficulty has been in finding
available reserves for any position.
A man-by-man comparison of the first teams shows vividly why the
game is being called a standoff up and down the Peninsula. Johnny
Schiechl might be as good offensively as Tony Calvelli, but no center on
the coast can match the fighting Tony defensively. At guard with the
veteran Ginney and Clarke, the Broncos can claim an edge.
Game May Turn 011 Tackle Posts
What might turn the tide of the game either way will be the play at
tackle wheie Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen match the strong pair of
Locke and Wolff. The superiority of either duo has been a question hard
to answer by dopesters who have watched both work.
In Jack Clark and Bill McElroy, Jim Lawson, Card end coach, has two
ends just as good as any he has developed since Moscrip and Topping.
Coffer and Anahu can't match them on paper but may pull a surprise.
With all of Norm Standlee's build-up at quarterback, the big sopho
more still hasn't faced varsity fire. Neither has Hugh Gallarneau at right
half. Pete Fay and Bill Paulman have shown their strength in years
gone by.
How Good Is Iironc Secondary ?
J
The Bronc secondary of Jim Barlow and Bruno Pellegrini, halfbacks,
Gunther, full, and McCarthy at quarter may not be as good individually
as the Indian backs, but Barlow and Pellegrini messed up the Indians
plenty one September day last fall.
As far as replacements go, the next 12 Indian backs, with men like
Hampton Pool, Gene Coldiron, Glenn Hamilton, Freddie Ledeboer, Thor
Peterson, and others, are not far from a par basis with the first-stringers.
Down Santa Clara way they're booming two sophomores named Dick
Clark and Frank Peterson for plenty of surprises, with Jack Roche readv
at full.
But, as usual, the game has narrowed itself down to line play with
both coaches refusing to hazard many guesses about the capabilities of
their reserve stock. The come-through performances of these second
team guards, tackles, and centers will undoubtedly tell the ultimate story.
Cards May Shift to Pass Attack
If the Stanford ground attack should fail to move, Thornhill has a trio
of Paulman, Fay, and Hamilton to match anything the Broncs can muster.
There isn't a poor receiver in the first-string lineup.
Shaw yesterday showed some degree of respect for the Thornhill line
when he asserted that he might be forced to the air if his attack on the
ground was bottled up. For three days the Stanford coaches have been
drilling the first three teams in all manner of defensive tactics against
just such a thrust.
Unless the wind is blowing, the Stanford punters ought to more than
match anything from the Bronco squad. Pete Fay and Paulman were con
sistent from fifty-five to sixty yards last season with Hamilton again a
reliable substitute. The Broncos have had difficulty replacing Chuck
Pavelko, who did such devastating work to the Indians in the '37 disaster.
The probable starting lineups:
STANFORD SANTA CLARA
Clark end Coffer
Zagar tackle Locke
Dakan guard Ginney
Calvelli (c) center Schiechl
Sutton guard Clarke
Andersen tackle Wolff
McElroy end Anahu
Standlcc quarter McCarthy
Gallarneau half Pellegrini
Fay half Barlow
Paulman full Gunther

Tony Calvelli, great center of the Stanford varsity, was elected
team captain for the Santa Clar# game, it was announced last evening.
Calvelli becomes the first team-clectcd Indian leader in several
years. In past seasons, Coach Thornhill has appointed a field captain
just before game time.
Under the new elective policy, the squad will pick their own choice
before each game.

How Good Is Iironc Secondary ?
J
The Bronc secondary of Jim Barlow and Bruno Pellegrini, halfbacks,
Gunther, full, and McCarthy at quarter may not be as good individually
as the Indian backs, but Barlow and Pellegrini messed up the Indians
plenty one September day last fall.
As far as replacements go, the next 12 Indian backs, with men like
Hampton Pool, Gene Coldiron, Glenn Hamilton, Freddie Ledeboer, Thor
Peterson, and others, are not far from a par basis with the first-stringers.
Down Santa Clara way they're booming two sophomores named Dick
Clark and Frank Peterson for plenty of surprises, with Jack Roche readv
at full.
But, as usual, the game has narrowed itself down to line play with
both coaches refusing to hazard many guesses about the capabilities of
their reserve stock. The come-through performances of these second
team guards, tackles, and centers will undoubtedly tell the ultimate story.
Cards May Shift to Pass Attack
If the Stanford ground attack should fail to move, Thornhill has a trio
of Paulman, Fay, and Hamilton to match anything the Broncs can muster.
There isn't a poor receiver in the first-string lineup.
Shaw yesterday showed some degree of respect for the Thornhill line
when he asserted that he might be forced to the air if his attack on the
ground was bottled up. For three days the Stanford coaches have been
drilling the first three teams in all manner of defensive tactics against
just such a thrust.
Unless the wind is blowing, the Stanford punters ought to more than
match anything from the Bronco squad. Pete Fay and Paulman were con
sistent from fifty-five to sixty yards last season with Hamilton again a
reliable substitute. The Broncos have had difficulty replacing Chuck
Pavelko, who did such devastating work to the Indians in the '37 disaster.
The probable starting lineups:
STANFORD SANTA CLARA
Clark end Coffer
Zagar tackle Locke
Dakan guard Ginney
Calvelli (c) center Schiechl
Sutton guard Clarke
Andersen tackle Wolff
McElroy end Anahu
Standlcc quarter McCarthy
Gallarneau half Pellegrini
Fay half Barlow
Paulman full Gunther

Tony Calvelli, great center of the Stanford varsity, was elected
team captain for the Santa Clar# game, it was announced last evening.
Calvelli becomes the first team-clectcd Indian leader in several
years. In past seasons, Coach Thornhill has appointed a field captain
just before game time.
Under the new elective policy, the squad will pick their own choice
before each game.
i! y usanc * g ri diron fans are expected to watch the new Big Red
Machine in the Stanford stadium tomorrow afternoon when Santa Clara's
two-time Sugar Bowl champions seek their third straight Cardinal win.
f'or Buck Shaw's Broncos the game will mark an attempt to lengthen
a victory string that has already reached eleven in a row. For Tiny Thorn
hill and the Indians, ovith the greatest backfield since the Vow Boys, it
will be an attempt to gather steam for a campaign that could easily lead
to a conference championship and a Rose Bowl bid.
But a fiist-game defeat could just as easily lead to a season of mediocre
caliber.
The memory of that Santa Clara triumph back in 1936 still lingers.
Stanford entered the game as a triple Rose Bowl team. The Broncos had
an untried coach and a green team but announced their, intention to "get
the Rose Bowl champs"—and they got them.
Last year it was the same story. This year the Indians arc the under
dogs facing a team of champions. The tables have turned.

Thornhill will open with a team of veterans of which six were first
string last year and one was a potential All-American end two years ago.
Of the other four, three are wholly inexperienced in varsity play and one
alternated between first and second strings last year.
Shaw will have to rely on what was his second team last year. By
his own word, however, he has declared that his second men were just
about as good as his top team. His prime difficulty has been in finding
available reserves for any position.
A man-by-man comparison of the first teams shows vividly why the
game is being called a standoff up and down the Peninsula. Johnny
Schiechl might be as good offensively as Tony Calvelli, but no center on
the coast can match the fighting Tony defensively. At guard with the
veteran Ginney and Clarke, the Broncos can claim an edge.
Game May Turn 011 Tackle Posts
What might turn the tide of the game either way will be the play at
tackle wheie Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen match the strong pair of
Locke and Wolff. The superiority of either duo has been a question hard
to answer by dopesters who have watched both work.
In Jack Clark and Bill McElroy, Jim Lawson, Card end coach, has two
ends just as good as any he has developed since Moscrip and Topping.
Coffer and Anahu can't match them on paper but may pull a surprise.
With all of Norm Standlee's build-up at quarterback, the big sopho
more still hasn't faced varsity fire. Neither has Hugh Gallarneau at right
half. Pete Fay and Bill Paulman have shown their strength in years
gone by.

f'or Buck Shaw's Broncos the game will mark an attempt to lengthen
a victory string that has already reached eleven in a row. For Tiny Thorn
hill and the Indians, ovith the greatest backfield since the Vow Boys, it
will be an attempt to gather steam for a campaign that could easily lead
to a conference championship and a Rose Bowl bid.
But a fiist-game defeat could just as easily lead to a season of mediocre
caliber.
The memory of that Santa Clara triumph back in 1936 still lingers.
Stanford entered the game as a triple Rose Bowl team. The Broncos had
an untried coach and a green team but announced their, intention to "get
the Rose Bowl champs"—and they got them.
Last year it was the same story. This year the Indians arc the under
dogs facing a team of champions. The tables have turned.

Thornhill will open with a team of veterans of which six were first
string last year and one was a potential All-American end two years ago.
Of the other four, three are wholly inexperienced in varsity play and one
alternated between first and second strings last year.
Shaw will have to rely on what was his second team last year. By
his own word, however, he has declared that his second men were just
about as good as his top team. His prime difficulty has been in finding
available reserves for any position.
A man-by-man comparison of the first teams shows vividly why the
game is being called a standoff up and down the Peninsula. Johnny
Schiechl might be as good offensively as Tony Calvelli, but no center on
the coast can match the fighting Tony defensively. At guard with the
veteran Ginney and Clarke, the Broncos can claim an edge.
Game May Turn 011 Tackle Posts
What might turn the tide of the game either way will be the play at
tackle wheie Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen match the strong pair of
Locke and Wolff. The superiority of either duo has been a question hard
to answer by dopesters who have watched both work.
In Jack Clark and Bill McElroy, Jim Lawson, Card end coach, has two
ends just as good as any he has developed since Moscrip and Topping.
Coffer and Anahu can't match them on paper but may pull a surprise.
With all of Norm Standlee's build-up at quarterback, the big sopho
more still hasn't faced varsity fire. Neither has Hugh Gallarneau at right
half. Pete Fay and Bill Paulman have shown their strength in years
gone by.
How Good Is Iironc Secondary ?

The Bronc secondary of Jim Barlow and Bruno Pellegrini, halfbacks,
Gunther, full, and McCarthy at quarter may not be as good individually
as the Indian backs, but Barlow and Pellegrini messed up the Indians
plenty one September day last fall.
As far as replacements go, the next 12 Indian backs, with men like
Hampton Pool, Gene Coldiron, Glenn Hamilton, Freddie Ledeboer, Thor
Peterson, and others, are not far from a par basis with the first-stringers.
Down Santa Clara way they're booming two sophomores named Dick
Clark and Frank Peterson for plenty of surprises, with Jack Roche readv
at full.
But, as usual, the game has narrowed itself down to line play with
both coaches refusing to hazard many guesses about the capabilities of
their reserve stock. The come-through performances of these second
team guards, tackles, and centers will undoubtedly tell the ultimate story.
Cards May Shift to Pass Attack
If the Stanford ground attack should fail to move, Thornhill has a trio
of Paulman, Fay, and Hamilton to match anything the Broncs can muster.
There isn't a poor receiver in the first-string lineup.
Shaw yesterday showed some degree of respect for the Thornhill line
when he asserted that he might be forced to the air if his attack on the
ground was bottled up. For three days the Stanford coaches have been
drilling the first three teams in all manner of defensive tactics against
just such a thrust.
Unless the wind is blowing, the Stanford punters ought to more than
match anything from the Bronco squad. Pete Fay and Paulman were con
sistent from fifty-five to sixty yards last season with Hamilton again a
reliable substitute. The Broncos have had difficulty replacing Chuck
Pavelko, who did such devastating work to the Indians in the '37 disaster.
The probable starting lineups:
STANFORD SANTA CLARA
Clark end Coffer
Zagar tackle Locke
Dakan guard Ginney
Calvelli (c) center Schiechl
Sutton guard Clarke
Andersen tackle Wolff
McElroy end Anahu
Standlcc quarter McCarthy
Gallarneau half Pellegrini
Fay half Barlow
Paulman full Gunther

Tony Calvelli, great center of the Stanford varsity, was elected
team captain for the Santa Clar# game, it was announced last evening.
Calvelli becomes the first team-clectcd Indian leader in several
years. In past seasons, Coach Thornhill has appointed a field captain
just before game time.
Under the new elective policy, the squad will pick their own choice
before each game.
