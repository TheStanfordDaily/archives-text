# "Europe Not Prepared for War," Says Returning Prof
## 
### KAY JOHNSON 
"No, you don't have to call me
Dr. Sharp," remarked Dr. Stanley L.
Sharp, Stanford faculty member,
"you may call me something more
familiar, if you like."
So, Dr. and Mrs. Sharp were af
fectionately known as "Ma" and
"Pa" to the 2(i .students whom they
chaperoned on a European tour this
summer. This third venture of Dr.
and Mrs. Sharp's with a student
group in Europe included travels in
eight countries — England, Norway,
Sweden, Denmark, Germany (also,
former Austria), Italy, Switzerland,
and France.
WAR NOT DISCUSSED
"1 guess," suggested Dr. Sharp,
"you want to hear about our terri
fying journey in Europe?"
"We didn't know anything about
a war until we got home," remarked
Betty Ingles, Stanford Chi O, mem
ber of the trip.
"Personally, I don't think psycho
logically or materially (as far as
food is concerned) that Germany is
on a basis suitable for war, and that
goes for the rest of Europe," stated
Dr. Sharp.
"We left there on September 1,"

he added, "and then there was no j
indication in Europe that conditions
were going to become tense. 1 talked |
with hundreds of Germans — both ;
this year and last—and their reply I
to me is:
" 'Our leader was a soldier at the ;
front. He knows what war is and he
will not lead us into another war!'
"The German rnan-in-the-street |
really feels this strongly," Dr. Sharp
stated.
Were there gas-mask drills, etc., in !
Germany?
"I didn't see a single gas mask in
Europe," answered Dr. Sharp.
VENICE FAVORITE CITY
"There is there, however, a strong
nationalistic feeling—in past years
as well as this year. In England, j
the 'Buy British' movement goes to j
the extreme of printing 'Foreign' on j
all commodities not made in the |
British Dominions.
"Venice was almost the unani
mous favorite—Paris being the pos
sible exception. In many places,
but Germany in particular, our
women were stared at for smoking
and wearing lipstick — for one as
much as the other."
