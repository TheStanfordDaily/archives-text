TESCHEN, Polish - Czechoslova-

I The Polish government has warned

I will "march in and take it."
Poland has 1.600,000 troops under
arms and heavy troop movements
toward the frontier were reported as
the hour for expiration of the ulti
matum neared. Troop and supply
convoys and trains were said to be
clogging highways and impeding
railroad traffic in various parts of
western Poland.
Government officials insisted the
four-power peace plan worked out
at Munich would not be permitted

I Polish ultimatum.
Discussing, the Munich develop

refuse to be bound by any agree
ments reached without her partici

lem and if new guarantees of the
new boundaries of Czechoslovakia
are to be given it is impossible to
count on Poland's guarantee as long
as Polish interests are not upheld,"
a spokesman said.
More than 400 Polish families fled
across the river border line of Te
schen and reached Polish soil dur
ing the day. Many of them carried
gas masks.
The bloodiest clash of the day oc

HITLER TO PERMIT
CZECH WITHDRAWAL
LONDON, Friday, Sept. 30 (UP).
—The Daily Mail's correspondent,
Ward Price, now in Munich, said
early today Fuehrer Adolf Hitler
had agreed to permit Czechoslovakia
to withdraw war materials from the
evacuated Sudeten areas.

Hitler, meeting with Prime Min
ister Chamberlain, Premier Dala
dier and Premier Mussolini at Mu
nich, was reported to have declined,
however, to guarantee the new
Czech frontiers unless the Hunga
rian minoriy question was settled at
the four-power conference.
Price said Mussolini raised the
question of Hungarian mniority
claims, and the British and French
delegations sought to persuade Hit
ler to give the international guaran
tee under the express stipulation it
would not be operative until settle
ment of the Hungarian question.
The dispatch said due to apparent
British and French objections to the
use of German regular army troops
to police the areas during evacua
tion, Hitler had offered the use of
Storm Troopers.
Much to the Germans' surprise,
Daladier and Chamberlain replied
they preferred the use of German
soldiers to police predominantly
German areas.
