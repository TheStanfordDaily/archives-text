CHARLESTON. S.C., Sept. 29 |
(UP). —Soldiers of the regular army j
and National Guardsmen tonight !
patrolled 30 debris-strewn blocks of !
j this historic old southern city where
| two rapid-fire tornadoes had killed
more than a score of persons, in
jjured 350, and caused property dam-
I age estimated at $2,000,000.
The lirst tornado struck the
I northern section of the city a few
| minutes after 8 a.m. Its intensity
' was felt only momentarily. There
i was a brief lull and another violent
j tornado hit the battery and busi-
I ness section.
BUILDINGS WRECKED
The storms wrecked and damaged
manufacturing plants, old buildings
and colonial homes dating back to
the revolution. Trees and communi
j cation poles were snapped, roofs were i
I blown off, automobiles overturned,;
' power cut off, and streets littered
| with debris.
Torrential rains preceded the
tornadoes and continued for six
hours afterward.
President Roosevelt, in Washing
ton, ordered the Army, Navy, Marine
Corps, Works Progress Administra
| tion, Civilian Conservation Corps,
and other federal agencies to aid the I
j city in clearing the devastated area j
i and giving relief to those in need.

! tornado vacuum exploded into
