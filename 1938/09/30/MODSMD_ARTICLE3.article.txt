The Daily went overboard yesterday. It dug out type that
hadn't seen light for many years. It threw out a front-page
make-up at a late hour to put in a new one; it sent a hurry call
to the city for a picture.
For eight hours last night, The Daily went slightly mad. The
smoky atmosphere of the Shack was charged with the hysteria
of awful waiting that gripped the whole world in the most
momentous moment since the Armistice was signed.
So The Daily went slightly mad.
Today, the Shack is quiet. Copy is rolling out to the linotype ;
machines, editorials are being written leisurely, the copy desk
is having its usual trouble in writing heads. The Daily is going
along as usual.
So is the world.
In the 24 hours which have elapsed since Hitler's message
was placed in Neville Chamberlain's hands, a miracle has oc
curred.
For five of those hours, in the town of Munich, the four lead
ers of the greatest European nations talked. What they decided
in those five hours has not changed history. The world is going
on as it was a few days before. But their solemn pledge that the
European peoples will not go to war has prevented an event
which might destroy the world.
In those five hours the mistakes of twenty years ago, the
snowball of events leading up to Hitler's latest conquest, were
settled peacefully.
The story is not ended yet. Hitler's demands must be met. j
Unforeseen incidents may intervene.
But today, after 24 hours of bitter waiting, left in the hands of
Hitler, Chamberlain, Mussolini, and Daladier, the world has heard 1
its fate.
The world, like The Daily, is not thinking in black headlines i
streaking across pages filled with terrible potentialities.
The world, like The Daily, is going on as usual.
