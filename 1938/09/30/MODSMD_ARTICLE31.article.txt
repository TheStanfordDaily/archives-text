# Scientists Convene For Summer Confab
## 
### TEMPLETON PECK 
Photochemistry is not a freshman
requirement at Stanford, one good
reason being that the most eminent
chemists themselves admit they don't
know very much about it.
However, like most scientific
frontiers, the borders of the unknown
in photochemistry are constantly
being pushed back. The Stanford
Summer Conference on Photochem
istry, held at Lagunita Court from
August 8 to 11, helped bring to light
much new knowledge in this im
portant chemical field.
PHOTOCHEMISTRY EXPLAINED
Photochemistry is the study of
what happens to molecules when
light hits them and causes them to
break down, or to build up more
complex molecules, or to give off
energy as fluorescence or phos
phorescence.
Twenty-four of the nation's lead
ing investigators of photochemistry
attended the conference, which was
arranged by Professors Robert E.
Swain and Philip A. Leighton of the j
chemistry department. The idea of
the conference was to bring men to- |
gether and allow them to swap hy- |
potheses and theories about the ac- j
tion of light on molecules.
James Franek, one of Germany's
exiled physicists, winner of the
Nobel Prize in physics, and associate
professor of chemistry at Stanford
during the summer quarter, started j
the conference off with his theory
of a molecule's behavior when hit j
by light. Taking the iodine mole
cule as an example, he explained
that when light hits iodine in solu
tion the molecule breaks down into
two atoms. The two dissociated
atoms then act like an animal in a
cage. They bump against the water
molecules surrounding them. Some
times they bump themselves to
gether again, and recombine.
What happens inside the molecule
that has been hit by light if it docs
not dissociate?
PRESENTS NEW THEORY
Professor G. K. Rollefson, of the
University of California Chemistry
Department has a new theory. He
said certain molecules he has studied
— especially the aldehydes — lead
him to believe a process of reso
nance takes place when light is ab
sorbed by them.
He likened this process to a fa

miliar musical phenomenon. When
a musician plays a strong note on a
violin, the piano string nearby will
give off a corresponding sound. So,
when light enters the molecule of
formaldehyde, for example, it ex
cites electrons at the point where it
enters to a heightened state of en
ergy.
This sets up a mechanical wave
motion within the molecule—an ac
tual vibration, or quiver, Professor
Rollefson believes — and the wave
motion travels "across' the molecule
to other atoms, exciting their elec
trons to a higher energy state.
DESCRIBES PROBLEMS
Other theories were advanced,
new words were coined, and at
length G. B. Kistakowsky, brilliant
young Russian of the Harvard
chemistry department, described the
task ahead of photochemists:
"It has taken 100 man-years to
find out what happens to the mole
cules of hydrogen and chlorine when
I they unite to form hydx*ochloric
I acid," he said. "I suppose the pa
pers wirtten about hydrogen-chlor
| ine reactions alone weigh about a
I ton.
' "Perhaps it will take hundreds,
even thousands, of man-years to
learn all about the processes of pho
tochemistry."
