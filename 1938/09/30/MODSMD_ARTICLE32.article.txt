The Women's Student Committee,
a vocational guidance group, has
been appointed by the Women's
Conference with Gretchen Gillespie

Made up of juniors and seniors,
the committee aids women in choos

out through living groups what the
girls are interested in and helps to
get them jobs through letters of
recommendation.
