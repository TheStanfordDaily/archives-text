"This year," Kimball declared, "a
special effort will be made to put
people on the committees in which
they are interested. Naturally," he
went on to say, "because of the small
size of the working groups, not ev

to place these applicants on com

coming up during the year." Jobs,
so far as possible, will be divided
between Hall and Row.
