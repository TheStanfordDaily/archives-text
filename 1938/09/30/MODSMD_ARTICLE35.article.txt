# Interfraternity Group Meets
## Council Discusses Pre-Initiation Period 
### 
Starting its 1938-39 season with a
meeting in the Deke house, Intel
fraternity Council last night took up
only routine business as the year
began.
Chief item before the Council ap
peared to be the euphemistically
titled "Pre-Initiation Period." to be
held this year from November 28 to
December 4, "since that seems to be
the only time during the quarter
when there's nothing going on, and
it won't interfere with studies.
NEW PLAN TOLD
President Bud McDuflie pointed
out that during the rest of the quar
ter football games and campus activ
ities would conflict with a pre-ini
tiation period, but. that in the week
set aside there would be time to
complete the program without af
fecting scholarship. Under the new
plan, a whole week will elapse be
fore finals.
Conditions under which the pe
riod will be held include liling a list
of prospective initiates and their
grade averages with Interfraternity
Council ofTice two weeks before the
period begins, and also presenting ;i
tentative program of scheduled ac
tivities, which will be referred to
Interfraternity Board of Control
and the Dean of Men's office for ap
proval.
Discussing general scholarship,
McDuflie emphasized that an aver
age of C or better for the quartet
preceding entry into a house is re
quired by Council regulations, and
urged that house presidents check
on the records of pledges who are
moving in this quarter.
NOMINATE FACULTY
Conclusion of Professor Elmer
Fagan's two-year term on Interfra
ternity Board of Control was an
nounced, and the meeting was
thrown open for nominations to fill
the vacancy. Six faculty members
were nominated and voted upon by
the Council in a secret ballot whose
•results were not announced. The
Council's vote serves only as recom
mendation to President Wilbur, who
has final selection of the board's
faculty members.
Referring to the open house which
will be held by the Row next Fri
day and Saturday nights, President
McDuflie informed the Council that
he would ask The Daily to publish a
map of the Row for the information
of rushees. "They'll be coming up
here at night," he said, "and will
probably have some difficulty find
ing the houses they're looking for.
We'll try and help them out."
In closing the meeting, McDuf
fie urged strongly that substitutes
! not be sent to Council meetings.
"It is important that the presi
j dents themselves attend," he said,
j "because, after all, they're morally
'responsible for Iheir houses."
STRESS CO-OPERATION
Closer co-operation between the
j Stanford wholesale commissary and
ithe fraternities, sororities, and eat
! ing clubs is one of the plans of the
, year. The Co-op is run in order to
I furnish food to these groups more
J economically.
