# Frosh Gridders Meet Pomona Tomorrow
## Strong Red Team Faces 300-pounders On Sagehen Eleven 
### 
King Football, 1938 edition, will of
ficially get under way tomorrow
afternoon at 12:15 o'clock in the
Stanford Stadium when Coach Harry
Shipkey leads his Stanford year
ling grid team into the season's first
local action against Pomona Junior
College.
Shipkey will point his men for
each game on the schedule, over
looking no possible chance of his
team's being upset; but out of the
corner of his eye he is looking for
ward to the Little Big Game with
California already. Last Saturday
the Bearcubs overpowered a strong
San Francisco Junior College out
fit, 12-0, showing what critics call
"the best Cal frosh team of recent
years."
POMONA HAS GIANTS
The light, fast-charging Papoose
line will be faced tomorrow by two
of the biggest football players in
the country in Bruce Twerell, 305-
pound starting center, and Ernie
Richards, 330-pound second - string
tackle. Both men are reputed fast
and active for their size. However,
even Richards' unusual, not to say
monstrous, size isn't enough to put
him on the first string over either
Fred Abbott, tough 170-pounder, or
John MacKall, an agile 185-pounder.
Filling out the Pomona line are
Earl Thomas and O. D. Morris, ends,
and Junior Vammen and Starling
Splawn, guards.
In the jay see backfield, the heavi
est man of which weighs 160 pounds,
the opening kickoff will find Bud
Gray at quarter; Jack Hagen and
Bruce Drummond, halves; and Ells
worth Booth, fullback.
So much for Pomona.
FROSH WORK AS UNIT
The team that Shipkey will start
has been playing together as a unit,
except for a few minor changes, for
several weeks and has the benefit of
teamwork developed during this
period.
Following a scrimmage with Men
lo Jaysee last Tuesday Shipkey de
cided to let his defense work itself
out; but he has been working on his
offense in dummy scrimmage the
past two days, getting the ragged
edges smoothed off.
FRANCIS TO BACK LINE
One of Shipkey's worries is that
three of his four starters in the
backfield have never played any
thing but safety man on defense.
Jack Francis, a powerful ball-packer
and blocker, will start at quarter
back, and will back up the line, a
thing at which he excels.
However, Pete Kmetovic and John
Sturgeon, halfbacks, and Frankie
Albert, triple-threat fullback, are all
inexperienced at any defense post
except the safety position. Albert
will get the call because the added
weight packed by Kmetovic and
Sturgeon is needed in the secondary.
SHIFT MAY BE MADE
Tomorrow's starting combination
lacked straight-ahead power against
Menlo, and if his backfield has
trouble denting the Pomona line
Shipkey will probably send Francis
to fullback and Russ Smith to
quarter. However, Shipkey expects
to make plenty around the Pomona
ends with speedsters like Kmetovic
and Albert following the effective
blocking of Francis and Sturgeon.
To fill the hole caused by the in
juries to Wilson and Partridge, Fred
Meyer has been switched from first
string left end to the starting right
end berth. Meyer is a boy
who excels in pass-catching.
Colin McClintock will help Fran
cis back up the line from the center
position, and Shipkey hopes he'll
block a possible defensive weakness
at the guard posts.
Yank Levin, another aggressive
and fast-moving interference run
ner, will open at left guard, shoul
der to shoulder with Bud Radditz,
who is the best tackle prospect on
the squad. Burt Talcott takes over
Meyer's vacated left-end post.
