# Champ Diver Bolsters Frosh Swim Squad
## Coach Thornton Says Team Possibly The Best Ever 
### 
Heading a list of bright freshman
swimming prospects is Howard Ad
ams, who is recognized as the finest
diver on the Pacific Coast.
On August 21 Adams won the Far
Western AA.U. diving champion
ship at the Fleishhacker pool. Con
sidered very excellent material for
the 1940 Olympics, Adams also holds
the N.C.S. diving championship.
According to Swimming Coach
Nort Thornton, "We have a good
group of Frosh swimmers, possibly
the best ever."
Another prospect is Scott Dud
ley, who comes from a Los Angeles
high school with an impressive rec
ord of fine swimming. For two
years he has been on the All-Amer
ican high school swimming team.
Dudley holds the California rec
ord in the breast stroke of 1:06.4.
The fact that he is also a good free
styler and backstroker is proven by
his S.C. individual medley relay
championship.
A Kansas City Athletic Club free
styler is Gardner Miller, who swims
all three free-style events in con
sistently good time. He swims the
fifty under :25, the hundred in :56,
and the two-twenty in 2:22.
Duncan Patty of Burlingame High
School, another prospect, is the
N.C.S. two-twenty champ. Jim Can
ning of Sequoia will make a strong
bid for the backstroke position. The
outstanding prospect, Paul Herron of
Long Beach Poly High School, is
lacking a few credits so that he will
not be able to matriculate until the
winter quarter. Herron is taking a
postgraduate course at the Poly High
School to make up the necessary
units. Herron won the 100- and the
200-meter free style and the 300-
meter individual medley at the Far
Western A.A.U. meet. In addition
to this he was on two winning relay
teams. *
Coach Thornton added that at this
early date he is unable to see all the
swimming prospects. The swimming
season will officially be under way
at the beginning of the winter quar
ter.
