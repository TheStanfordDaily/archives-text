## 
### 
The Daily's Dizzy Dope Fiends
went back out on a limb above the
shack last night and announced that
Stanford would whip Santa Clara
tomorrow by a 13-7 score.,
It was Sports Editor John Shal-

lenberger who crawled further out
and he picked Santa Clara by a
touchdown.
Other choices by the Fiends
showed U.S.F. 18, Montana G; St.
Mary's 21, Gonzaga 0; Cailfornia 19,

W.S.C. 0; U.C.L.A. 7, Oregon 6;
S.C. 14, O.S.C. 0; Washington 18,

Two dopesters thought the U. C.

in a tie.
