have been flying for several days on the practice field, and
k Stanford's Big Red Machine has reached a mental peak. Stanford
still has the makings of an A-1 team, and anyone who thinks anything
else is lacking just doesn't know.
Art Colin, sell-centered sports writer who has been tearing down
Stanford teams and Oakland Tribune sport pages for years, is still
"asking for it." He used to coax others to stick their chins out like a
small hoy tantalizing a turtle to put out its head so he can cut it Â«itY.
Now lie lies awake nights to figure out how to gel his name into
colli inns h\ making statements that would make a polar bear's blood
boil.
This time he smells friction between coaches and players on the Stan
ford field. No such friction exists in any sense of the word, but that is not
what counts with Colin. He does not care whether he states lacts, because
he is more interested in stirring up trouble. In fact, when it comes to
facts about Stanford football. Art Cohn is one man who would not know.
Kir->1 ol all. he is afraid to appear in Stanford's big green fence, hi cause
there are about 80 boys in there who are twice his size and would be

tempted to prove it. Cohn does have a stooge on the
field who gathers up tid-bits to be misconstrued in
Tribune columns. Everybody realizes that such tid-bils
do not take on their characteristic tinge, however, until
Cohn plays with them; so the stooge is safe.
Cohn's main beef is that the players resent the ordt r
of ranks of the coaches. And that is ridiculous because
Stanford coaches are not pyramided like an army. There

is only one man above the others. Tiny Thornliill is head coach, and all
the rest are on an equal level. All are well-liked and well-respected by
their pupils.
But nobody really objects to what Cohn thinks about Card coaches
everybody realizes that he doesn't know a Golden Gate bridge liom an
Embarcadero underpass. The only objection Indian rooters need to nurse
is Cohn's mention of The Farm as "my Stanford."

A LTHOUGII there is always the possibility that changes will be made
right up to the toss of the coin at a football game, it looks as though
Tiny is pretty sure what combination he will use against Santa Clara.
Norm Slandlee is still bothered by an ankle sprained last week, but i! is
improving fast, it is a cinch that Norm will play Saturday, but Tiny may
put Glenn Hamilton in for a large part of the game just to be on the
safe side. Norm is trying hard to be in good shape, and he's been doing
his studying in the evenings with his left foot in a bucket of hot water.
The guard situation is still somewhat unsettled, and it should be, be
cause it would help a lot if By West could lend his grid talent as much as

possible without taking Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen
out of tackle spots. West and Corky Donahue can
play guard, but Dakan and Sutton are still good men
and they have been holding down the first string
spots fairly regularly in the past week.
Only other doubtful spot is right end. McElroy
seems to have an edge, but whoever stars, he and
Stojkovich will split up the right flank duties.
Hugh Gallerneau is a cinch for starting honors at

right half. But Hamp Pool can still pull down nearly every pass thai he
touches, and will have plenty of chance to run out for them from right
half into the Santa Clara defense.
And ypeaking' of passing, the Big lied Machine improves in aerial
work every time it turns its wheels. Passes are clicking as they never
have before in the history of Stanford football. And if they work
half as well in games as they do in practice, there are nine grid teams
that had better have a mighty fine pass defense when they meet
the Cards.
The Indians will have little more than an even chance when they got
in there against Santa Clara tomorrow, and the game, although non-confer
ence, will mean a great deal to both teams. The Cards have lost for two
years to Buck Shaw's teams, and both games were upsets. This is Stan
ford's third chance, and it will bo verging on the miraculous if the jinx
is not broken. The game does not have any direct effect on the Indians'
chances of going to the Rose Bowl, but the loss Of a pre-season game has
been known to hamper teams mentally. And it sometimes takes till
mid-season to recover.

STANFORD DAILY sports writers are again indebted to Tommy Thomp
son for adding life to their yarns with clever cartoons about the red
steamroller and the men who ride it. Tommy has drawn a series of car
toons like those in this column to add a new kind of color to Daily sports
pages.
