### 
WRIGLEY FIELD. CHICAGO,
Sept. 2f) (UP). — Chicago's roaring
Cubs, behind the courageous pitch
ing of "General'' Bill Lee, as good
as nailed the 19."»8 National League
pennant to the yardarm over Wrig
ley Field today by smothering the
completely demoralized Pittsburgh
Pirates, 10-1.
The triumph* their tenth straight
and twentieth in their last 2'.] games,
enabled the Cubs to sweep the
three-game "sudden death" series
with the Bugs and increased their
newly-gained league lead over
Pittsburgh to a game and a half.
UAKTNKTT INJURED
It may prove a costly conquest,
however. Manager-Catcher Charles
Leo (Gabby) Harlnett, hero of yes
terday's (j-5 victory, was forced to
retiie from the game with a linger
injury with two out in Pittsburgh's
half of the ninth.
A foul tip from the bat of Johnny
Ri/.zo tore the flesh from the third
linger of Gabby's throwing hand. It
was not ascertained how long
the injury would keep him out of
action.
Later in the clubhouse, Hartnett
said he definitely would be unable
to catch tomorrow. The injured lin
ger was to be X-rayed in St. Louis
to determine the exton; of damage.
CUBS CINCH PENNANTS
As a result of their victory, the
Cubs virtually eliminated the Pirates
Iroiii the race. The Cubs have three
games left with St. Louis and the
Pirates four with Cincinnati. Chi
cago can clinch the flag beyond a
maihv matical doubt by taking two
of their next three games, provided
Pittsburgh drops one to Cincinnati.
If the Cubs sweep the St. Louis
series, they will win the pennant
even if Pittsburgh takes four straight
from Cincinnati.
Lee, a tall right-hander, amazed
the 42,(J2(i fans with his stamina.
This was the big southerner's fourth
appearance on the mound in .as many
days and his 44th this season.
As he breezed along to his fifth
siraight triumph of the season over
the Pirates against no defeats, Bill
might well have added his tenth
shutout of the season but for his
own wildness. Pittsburgh's only run
came in the third inning, when, with
two out, Lee issued four straight
passes to force in the run.
Bill was touched by the hand of
destiny throughout the game.

I In addition to pitching the Cubs
|to victory, he stepped up to the
plate in the fifth and drove out a
double that scored two runs. These
would have been enough to win the
game, but, as it was. the tallies
were superfluous.
When he did get into tight spots
and couldn't get out of them him- j
! self, the "General" was aided by :
J spectacular and faultless fielding.
In all, Lee yielded seven scattered
hits, walked seven men and fanned
two, including Hizzo, whose whiff |
. ended the game.
BAUEKS BLOWS I P
In a desperate effort to salvage the
i (inal game of the series, Manager
j Pie Traynor of the Bugs sent Right- |
i hander Russ Bauers against the*
Cubs. But the Wisconsin lumber
jack couldn't locate the plate and he
lasted only one inning. He was fol
lowed on the mound by Ed Brandt,
Cy Blanton, and M< r >ce Brown.

Pittsburgh to a game and a half.
UAKTNKTT INJURED
It may prove a costly conquest,
however. Manager-Catcher Charles
Leo (Gabby) Harlnett, hero of yes
terday's (j-5 victory, was forced to
retiie from the game with a linger
injury with two out in Pittsburgh's
half of the ninth.
A foul tip from the bat of Johnny
Ri/.zo tore the flesh from the third
linger of Gabby's throwing hand. It
was not ascertained how long
the injury would keep him out of
action.
Later in the clubhouse, Hartnett
said he definitely would be unable
to catch tomorrow. The injured lin
ger was to be X-rayed in St. Louis
to determine the exton; of damage.
CUBS CINCH PENNANTS
As a result of their victory, the
Cubs virtually eliminated the Pirates
Iroiii the race. The Cubs have three
games left with St. Louis and the
Pirates four with Cincinnati. Chi
cago can clinch the flag beyond a
maihv matical doubt by taking two
of their next three games, provided
Pittsburgh drops one to Cincinnati.
If the Cubs sweep the St. Louis
series, they will win the pennant
even if Pittsburgh takes four straight
from Cincinnati.
Lee, a tall right-hander, amazed
the 42,(J2(i fans with his stamina.
This was the big southerner's fourth
appearance on the mound in .as many
days and his 44th this season.
As he breezed along to his fifth
siraight triumph of the season over
the Pirates against no defeats, Bill
might well have added his tenth
shutout of the season but for his
own wildness. Pittsburgh's only run
came in the third inning, when, with
two out, Lee issued four straight
passes to force in the run.
Bill was touched by the hand of
destiny throughout the game.

I In addition to pitching the Cubs
|to victory, he stepped up to the
plate in the fifth and drove out a
double that scored two runs. These
would have been enough to win the
game, but, as it was. the tallies
were superfluous.
When he did get into tight spots
and couldn't get out of them him- j
! self, the "General" was aided by :
J spectacular and faultless fielding.
In all, Lee yielded seven scattered
hits, walked seven men and fanned
two, including Hizzo, whose whiff |
. ended the game.
