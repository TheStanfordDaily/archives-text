TT'S here.
1 While sports pages have been reeking with
tales of opening grid clashes, while Saturday's
radio hours have been blasting with tales of
upset and victory, while that golden afternoon
sunshine has been making green turf glow
suggestively, Stanford has been sitting around
biting its nails. No football.
But tomorrow is the big day. Moths will be
rudely requested to vacate summer homes in
rooters' caps; pompons will be retasseled;
megaphones will be dusted off.
While Stanford's new Red Roller has been
tuning up for action, Stanford has been biting
its nails.
While Stanford is tuning up for action, Tiny
Thornhill will be biting his nails.
Will his most-powerful-since-the-Vow-Boys
team be the team to upset the conference and
put the Cards back on top the football heap?
Or will injuries, bad luck, false hopes put the
Red Roller in a mud-hole?
Tomorrow's the day. If the Indians can mow
down the tough Santa Clara squad that Buck
Shaw is bringing up, Stanford can have hopes
of a powerful year. If they can't, Stanford can
console itself that there are eight more games
to go, eight important ones.
But all this talk is sports-writer stuff. Stanford
doesn't care too much about it.
The main thing is that football, any football,
is back.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
