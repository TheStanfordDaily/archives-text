REGISTRATION figures released yesterday
by the administration indicate that Stanford
is still growing. In fact, a glance over the rec
ords of the past year would make "growing" too
quiet a word—Stanford is shooting up like a
weed in wet weather.
It is over the 4000 mark to stay.
But the figures only tell a small part of the
story. Stanford's population is growing, but
how about its educational plant? Where are
added financial grants to the library so that it
can keep pace with the growing demands
placed upon it? Where are new or enlarged
laboratories, where more spacious classrooms,
more complete equipment?
What has been happening to the extra men
and women enrolled each successive year?
The answer is fairly obvious.
• Larger classes in the liberal arts schools al
most completely tell the tale. Classes already
becoming too huge to bo handled comfortably
by small faculty staffs are taking care of the
"extras."
They are extras. Stanford's educational facil
ities have grown little of late while its popula
tion has had over 1000 students added to it since
1932.
Stanford may not feel its growing pains right
now.
But it will some day, some day very soon.
