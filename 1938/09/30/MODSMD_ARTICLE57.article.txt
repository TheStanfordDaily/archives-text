STANFORD spirit is in the hands of 36 Rally-
Committee members and S7OO. That $700
will be well spent, but just how well Rally-
Committee will function remains to be seen.
Whether it can dodge the petty politics of
fiosh tryoutee appointments, the still pettier
jealousies of already appointed professional
spirit-arousers by Jack Laney's and Didi Vibert's
new plan of rating committee members by the
point system, is an indefinite question mark.
This much is certain, however: Rally Com
mittee has plans for the biggest program of
student support of Stanford's Red Machine that
any former group has ever mapped.
In co-operation with Tiny Thornhill, Rally
Committee has announced that the team will
be put through special paces for all Farm rooters
at Tuesday afternoon practices. Able strategy
of the committee's two heads is exemplified in
their special appeal to women to watch the team
practice on that day, since then, "everybody
else will come out."
Still another example of their desire to run
the committee on a firm basis is their early
adoption of a system designed to take the foun
dations from under loud and long cries of 'Vjraft

and corruption" which annually surround Rally
Committee appointments and promotions. No
longer will the chairmen have to report in a
doubtful way to the A.S.S.U., as did Don Dewar
last spring, that "you may try, but you will find
that it is practically impossible to keep politics
1 out of the selection of a committee as large as
! this."
Already, the Row is beginning to apply pres
sure on Rally Committee to appoint favored
sons and daughters. The hope arises, now, that
the light of the favored sons and daughters will
be more than just a little dimmed by the appli
cation of a miniature Civil Service policy.
What the committee heads seem to be doing,
then, is to make an attempt —and a good strong
one—to discard the slightly tarnished system of
appointment by political pressure for one based
on merit.
With these points in mind, the lead of this
edit, fortunately, is not correct.
Stanford spirit is in the hands of 36 Rally
Committee members, $700, and Stanford itself.

the committee on a firm basis is their early
adoption of a system designed to take the foun
dations from under loud and long cries of 'Vjraft

and corruption" which annually surround Rally
Committee appointments and promotions. No
longer will the chairmen have to report in a
doubtful way to the A.S.S.U., as did Don Dewar
last spring, that "you may try, but you will find
that it is practically impossible to keep politics
1 out of the selection of a committee as large as
! this."
Already, the Row is beginning to apply pres
sure on Rally Committee to appoint favored
sons and daughters. The hope arises, now, that
the light of the favored sons and daughters will
be more than just a little dimmed by the appli
cation of a miniature Civil Service policy.
What the committee heads seem to be doing,
then, is to make an attempt —and a good strong
one—to discard the slightly tarnished system of
appointment by political pressure for one based
on merit.
With these points in mind, the lead of this
edit, fortunately, is not correct.
Stanford spirit is in the hands of 36 Rally
Committee members, $700, and Stanford itself.
