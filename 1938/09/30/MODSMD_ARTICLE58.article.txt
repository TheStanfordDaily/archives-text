### JOHN COBBS 
BIRDS IN OUR GILDED CAGE
/ |NE of The Daily's best photographers is a girl,
which is very nice—brightens up the dark, room,
and all that. Ordinarily she lives the normal, well
adjusted life that goes with a good digestion and a
sweet disposition. But at the moment she is faced
with a problem, and is wandering around looking like
Robert E. Lee just before Appomatox.
She has a chance to go out on the field to take
pictures during the football games, and she is afraid
to do it because Stanford, accustomed to find girls
only in certain specified places, reacts a bit rudely
when it sees them off their traditional reservation.
She anticipates whistles, cat-calls, and possibly a
renegade big six from the stadium.
Ordinarily this would be a touching human interest
story, and nothing more—just one of those occasions
where you say, "It's a hard life, old girl," and change
the subject tactfully. But Stanford does not limit its
pressure to lady photographers. Without realizing it,
we quietly set aside a few specified activities for
women and make a stag party out of the rest.
The trouble is not that women don't go out for all
sorts of activities, or that they don't get ahead in them.
The snag comes when a girl works her way up in an
organization and finds that the Stanford set-up ignores
the possibility that a woman can hold an important
job in anything except the W.A.A. or the Y.W.
¥ AST winter when we had a woman for managing
editor of The Daily, it almost took an act of Con
gress to get her permission to stay around until the
paper was out. Over in the Division of Speech and
Drama, late leave regulations pursue the heroines
more persistently than any black moustached villain.
Budding Bernhardts have to bolt at twelve, like Cin
derella, just when the prince gets his cue.
And worse than the inflexible regulations is Stan
ford's quiet way of disregarding women whenever they
get out of the little activity backyard allotted them.
We have set up the W.A.A. and the Women's Confer
ence and Council for the girls to play with. In any
thing else they find themselves assigned to mailing
letters and keeping filing cases, work which is doubt
less good for the soul, but a little trying for the
ambition.

Women do not head important committees. At
Excom meetings, they sit in quiet retirement until the
diplomatic President asks their opinion out of polite
ness.
Of course, women who can't keep up their grade
average can claim no exemption from the lock-out
rules. And there is no reason why incompetents should
coast ahead simply because they have a tooth-paste
ad smile. But for a university that teaches equality
of the sexes, our statistics for the participation of
women in responsible activities is a monument to
inconsistency.

All of this is none of my business, and I'd never
touch the subject except that vacation exuberance has
revived that little-boy yen for chunking rocks at bee
hives. But even so, I wish we could persuade our
princesses to come down out of their ivory towers.
