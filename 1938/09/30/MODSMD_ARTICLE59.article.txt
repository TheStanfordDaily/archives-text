# Lightly... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
jpOli a week now the frosh have been with us, and
day by day the story of how terrific the Roble
women arc has been growing. It was started last
week by Tom Killefer. In a Daily story a few days
ago commenting on the pre-reg program, Killefer was
prosaically quoted as saying, "It looks like a good
year."
But what really happened: Killefer went to the
pre-reg jolly-up, and came out in about twenty min
utes wringing his hands and, with a wild gleam in
his eye, said, "Boy! It looks like a good year!"
Yes, the frosh women are supposed to be terrific,
they turn out in droves for activities, they arc all re
ported to be in the number one group on the aptitude
test, and they are even supposed to be quite rich.
But they're a little dumb. They always are.
All Roble windows, they tell me, have uniform
curtains made out of a sort of thin glass or some
thing. All frosh women are told to leave these cur
tains up. One of the '42 crop thought there must be
a hidden meaning somewhere in that rule: she had
herself convinced that the curtains were made of
asbestos as a protection against fire.
She came to college with all sorts of scientific
curiosity and the rule never take anything for
granted.
When her sponsor dropped in on her that evening,
she had a match out testing the curtains to see if
they really were asbestos or not.

'T'HEIR questions are beautiful. One girl asked if
the buzzers wiggle. Another asked why the spon
sors didn't take all those blind dates that came in
instead of giving them to the frosh. They ask each
other if the date they had the night before was a
goon-boy. Imagine that. Goon-boy.
One frosh was overheard saying, "Say, it took me
two whole days to find out what "dhur" means—and I
still don't know who you arrange it with."

But one of the terrific ones wasn't so dumb. Some
one asked her if she wanted to go to the city Satur
day night.
"No, thanks, she said. "I've got four years to go
to the citv. I think 111 » t<> the President's Reception
