# Rally Committee To Attempt Organization of Rooters
## 
### 
"All Student Body Football Day,"
sponsored weekly by Rally Commit
tee and Coach "Tiny" Thornhill, will
be attempted this year for the first
time to get all Card rooters closely
behind the 1938 Indian Grid Tribe,
it was announced yesterday.
Also setting the pace for Stanford's
Big Red Machine will be at least
four sets of card stunts, the Big
Game Rally, Parade, and Bonfire,
and assorted rallies to push the new
model on its rambling way.
This is the biggest program that
the committee has ever attempted,
according to Jack Laney and Didi
Vibert, co-chairmen.
Every Tuesday afternoon, "Tiny"

and his squad of pigskin packers
will hold open house on the prac
tice field for the special benefit of
the Farm rooters and team sup
porters. "All Student Body Day"
will be its name and Laney hopes
that Stanford will take advantage of
Tiny's open practice to really get
behind the Machine.
Rooting sections for both men and
women will be held, and traditional
rules of admittance will be used
again this year. That is, men must
wear rooters' caps and white shirts,
women must carry pompons. Sepa
rate sections will be formed for
both.
As to the rooting section, Laney
says, "This year, we want the stu
dents to get behind the card stunts
especially. The card stunts should
be considered as competition, when

we use them against U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
Cal, and Dartmouth. By making
them less elaborate, we hope to
make them more effective."
Personnel of Rally Committee is
composed of activity men and wom
en chosen each spring, when they
are given the white sweater adorned
with miniature Stanford Axes as
badges of authority.
Freshmen may try out at a date
to be announced soon and if chosen
will become members of the Try
out Committee and in the spring,
successful ones will be chosen as
regular members.
On the committee itself, the 36
members will be rated by points on
the basis of attendance at meetings,
hours of â€¢ work and co-operation.
Those with the most points will
become the five men and four wom
en members of Group I, from which
sub-committee heads arc selected.
Pompons for women rooters will
go on sale in the A.S.S.U. office on
Monday and the sale will be under
the direction of Co-chairman Vi
bert.
Yell Kings, who act as ex-oflicio
members of Rally Committee and
who will lead Farm rooters in yells
and songs, are Lomax Turner, head
leader, Bill McCurdy, and Johnny
Seamans.
