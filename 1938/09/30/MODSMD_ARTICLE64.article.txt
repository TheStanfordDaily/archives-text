# Faust Folding; Algiers Offers Sultry Love
## 
### 
"FAUST," folding Monday night at
the San Francisco Civic Audi
torium:
The jingley translation of this
j version of "Faust" would be nice
j for Burma Shave; • Conrad Nagel
| blusters through his part in a tone
lof voice you shoe a horse
j with, and, gummed up with too
much flossy apparatus, the play
| loses meaning and the whole pro
! duction prove* about us uplifting as
, a ball and chain.
"ALGIERS," currently playing at
the Fox-Stanford:
In the crowded, filthy streets of
the native quarter of Algiers, Pepe
Le Moko, jewel thief, played by
Charles Boyer, ditches the police.
Safe as long as he stays there, Pepe
is lured to his doom by nostalgia for
j his native Paris which to him is
i symbolized jn Hedy La Marr, a
j suave visitor from the world he
j once knew.
j "Algiers" is loaded to the scup
[ pers with sultry love-making and
I heavy cinemagufT which is going to
look pretty funny ten years from
now. But the picture presents color
fully the intrigues of the quarter's
crooks, stool pigeons, and derelicts.
And sometimes—however melodra
matic—the process of Le Moko's de-
I struction proves gripping.
