# New Course Offers Silent Reading Aid
## 
### 
Photographic recordings of eye
movements, designed to eliminate
hindrances and increase speed in
silent reading, will be employed in
"Psychology R," a special course to
be offered only to new students for
the autumn quartyf, according to an
announcement yesterday by Regis
trar J. P. Mitchell.
Two sections, consisting of two
two-hour sesisons each week, will
be devoted to the scientific "chart
ing" and study of eye movements
and the diagnosis of individual
reading abilities. One hour of each
class will be used for demonstra
tions, experiments, and talks on
reading problems, while the reading
and study of actual textbooks will
consumc the remainder of the
period.

EFFICIENCY MEASURED

RESULTS CHECKED

Results obtained from the aptitude
and reading tests given every en
tering student have been carefully
checked, and those whose scores in
dicate probable difficulty in silent
reading have received invitations to
enroll in the non-credit, course.

Opening sessions of the 17-week
course will be given this evening
and tomorrow evening, and students
who have been notified should regis
ter for the course. Each section
will be limited to 80 students, and
prompt enrollment and regular at
tendance is required, as there is a
waiting list for admission.

Graphic measurement of progres
sive increases in the efficiency of
eye movements will enable each stu
dent to gauge his individual posi
tion in comparison with the class
average. Previous classes have av
eraged a gain of more than 50 per
cent in reading speed, with sub
stantial improvement in compre
hension.
Section 1 will meet on Monday
evenings form 8 to 10 and on Wed
nesdays from 7:30 to 9:30 o'clock,
while section two will convene
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 30
to. 9:30 o'clock. Students may con
sult the instructor, William M. Dan
ner, Jr., in Room 47 of the Cubber
ley Building.
