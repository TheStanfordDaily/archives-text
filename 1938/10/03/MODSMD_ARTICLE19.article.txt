CARD MENTORS
HOLD CONFAB

FROSH CHALK UP
CONSOLING VICTORY

Tiny Thornhill and his staff locked
themselves into a room yesterday
afternoon and went to work shuf
lling the Stanford grid deck. Today
the new hands will be dealt, and
they'll be tried oat in line scrim
mage Tuesday and in real "live
bait" scrimmage Wednesday.
Over-anxiousn ess seemed to be
the whole answer to Saturday's
puzzle. The coaches agreed on
that point, hut they did not try to
fool themselves into thinking that
was the only reason the Cards
came out on the short end of a
well-t«percd horn.
The Indians had some good pass
plays, some of them cooked up spe
cially for the Broncs, but they didn't
work because the passers were not
well enough protected. Blocking
was definitely poor.
The primary reason for the bad
blocking may be lack of practice in

fundamentals, but
over - anxiousness
was a destroying
jfactor in the fun
damentals depart
ment as well as
everywhere else.
The Cards had
practiced long
hours in anticipa-

tion of the Santa Clara game and
the grid season in general. They
were keyed up. They wanted to get
in there and get going.
And when they did, they received
four successive penalties for off
sides. They gave the opponents 20
yards toward their first touchdown.
The psychological strain on the
linemen was great. They wanted to
get in there and break up Santa
Clara's fine plays, but now they had
to hold back for fear of being penal
ized further. And with all the play
ers leaning the other way as they
had to do, everything was bound to
fail. And everything, wfch few ex
ceptions, did.
Changing the line-up will not
solve all the problems that came up
Saturday, but it will help if it is
done carefully. If fine blockers now
hidden away in second and third
string backfields can be moved to
the line or to positions where they
can back up the line, the Big Red
Machine's most evident weakness
will be on its way to solution.

The frosh saved the day for Stan
lord. They won their game decisive
ly and proved themselves to be bet
ter than many who had seen them
in practice expected.
Of course, the competition was
not keen, Pomona Jaysee had
only their purple uniforms, stock
ings, and all. to make them a foot
hall team. But they did get in the
way at times, and it takes more
than a fair team to chalk up II!)
points against even the slightest
hazard.
Stanford's yearlings put on a
blocking performance that must
have surprised even Frosh Mentor
Harry Shipkey. They also did a fine
job of charging and tackling.
Harry was probably angry when
the managers said they had forgot
ten the glue buckets, but it turned
out they were not needed. The
passers made some nice tosses, and
the receivers did a fine job of pull
ing them in.
Two 300-pounders on the Pomona
line may have frightened the year
lings at first. But they just wobbled
around like a couple of elephants
pinch-hitting for horses in a polo
game. The nearest they came to
blocking was when they lay out
flat. They were hard to get over
because they were taller that way.
It seemed as though somebody had
gone to a great expense to bring a
team all the way from Pomona when
they could have found eleven boys
on the street to play the prelim
inary. But next week the story will
be different. Salinas Junior College
is said to have a mighty fine ball
club. So that is the game to see. Be
there in time for the preliminary,
and you may see the better half of
a double-header. — Shallenberger
