# Papooses Save Day, Smash Pomona J.C.
## Frosh Gridders Defeat Pomona In Score Spree Albert Sparks Team To 39-0 Slaughter; Aerial Game Clicks 
### 
Blocking viciously and effectively,
Stanford's f'rosh gridders flashed a
versatile and powerful offensive to
trounce a hapless Pomona Jurjior
College outfit, 39-0, last Saturday in
ihe preliminary to the varsity
slaughter.
Frankie Albert, 160 pounds of
triple^-threat dynamite sparked the
Papooses to victory, Coring one of
the six touchdowns himself and
tossing three scoring passes. Pete
Kmetovic, the little speed-burner
from San Jose, also showed well,
especially in running back punts
and snagging passes.

KMETOVIC SCORES FIRST

Kmetovic ran back one punt 65
yards to a score in the second quar
ter, and earlier in the day his 35-
yard return paved the way for
Stanford's first score.
However, it was the blocking of
John Sturgeon and Jack Francis in
the backfield, and of Dave Patterson
and Yank Levin, guards, that warm
ed the cockles of Coach Harry Ship
key's heart. These boys opened
holes in the jaysee line that a street
car could have gone through, and
the presence of two 300-pound mon
strosities in Center Bruce Twerell
and Tackle Ernie Richards proved
no obstacle to the frosh.
Albert and Kmetovic couldn't run
through Richards and Twerell but
they had no trouble running around
them, and unreliable sources say
that Albert sneaked through the legs
of Twerell and Richards a couple of
times. The latter report couldn't
be confirmed, however.

FUMBLE RECOVERED

Stanford scored its first touch
down early in the first quarter, after
Kmetovic had made his 35-yard punt
runback mentioned above. Two
successive first downs brought the
ball to the nine-yard line, from
where Albert bucked it over in two
tries.
Albert recovered Fullback Ells
worth Booth's fumble on the Po
mona 11-yard line in the second
quarter and a moment later nailed
Kmetovic with a touchdown pass.
Twice more the Papooses rang the
register before the half ended to
post a 25-0 halftime margin.

SECOND-STRING SCORES

Kmetovic snagged Booth's long
punt a short time later and rambled
65 yards to the third score of the
day. At this point Shipkcy injected
his second-string with no appl
icable loss of scoring punch. Just
before the half Ray Durham, sub
fullback, passed 20 yards to Paul
Blanton, sub half, for another
marker.
Two touchdowns in the third
quarter finished up the Shipkey
men's scoring for the day, both of
them coming off Albert's southpaw
pitching arm. Sturgeon was Albert's
battery mate on both strikes.
In the last quarter, Shipkey un
limbered his third, fourth, and
umpth strings on the Pomonas, with
the result that when the final gun
sounded Pomona was finally knock
ing at touchdown territory. In fact,
Pomona was staggering around the
Papoose 10-yard line when the timer
pulled out his gun.

and snagging passes.

KMETOVIC SCORES FIRST

Kmetovic ran back one punt 65
yards to a score in the second quar
ter, and earlier in the day his 35-
yard return paved the way for
Stanford's first score.
However, it was the blocking of
John Sturgeon and Jack Francis in
the backfield, and of Dave Patterson
and Yank Levin, guards, that warm
ed the cockles of Coach Harry Ship
key's heart. These boys opened
holes in the jaysee line that a street
car could have gone through, and
the presence of two 300-pound mon
strosities in Center Bruce Twerell
and Tackle Ernie Richards proved
no obstacle to the frosh.
Albert and Kmetovic couldn't run
through Richards and Twerell but
they had no trouble running around
them, and unreliable sources say
that Albert sneaked through the legs
of Twerell and Richards a couple of
times. The latter report couldn't
be confirmed, however.

FUMBLE RECOVERED

Stanford scored its first touch
down early in the first quarter, after
Kmetovic had made his 35-yard punt
runback mentioned above. Two
successive first downs brought the
ball to the nine-yard line, from
where Albert bucked it over in two
tries.
Albert recovered Fullback Ells
worth Booth's fumble on the Po
mona 11-yard line in the second
quarter and a moment later nailed
Kmetovic with a touchdown pass.
Twice more the Papooses rang the
register before the half ended to
post a 25-0 halftime margin.

SECOND-STRING SCORES

Kmetovic snagged Booth's long
punt a short time later and rambled
65 yards to the third score of the
day. At this point Shipkcy injected
his second-string with no appl
icable loss of scoring punch. Just
before the half Ray Durham, sub
fullback, passed 20 yards to Paul
Blanton, sub half, for another
marker.
Two touchdowns in the third
quarter finished up the Shipkey
men's scoring for the day, both of
them coming off Albert's southpaw
pitching arm. Sturgeon was Albert's
battery mate on both strikes.
In the last quarter, Shipkey un
limbered his third, fourth, and
umpth strings on the Pomonas, with
the result that when the final gun
sounded Pomona was finally knock
ing at touchdown territory. In fact,
Pomona was staggering around the
Papoose 10-yard line when the timer
pulled out his gun.
Blocking viciously and effectively,
Stanford's f'rosh gridders flashed a
versatile and powerful offensive to
trounce a hapless Pomona Jurjior
College outfit, 39-0, last Saturday in
ihe preliminary to the varsity
slaughter.
Frankie Albert, 160 pounds of
triple^-threat dynamite sparked the
Papooses to victory, Coring one of
the six touchdowns himself and
tossing three scoring passes. Pete
Kmetovic, the little speed-burner
from San Jose, also showed well,
especially in running back punts
and snagging passes.
