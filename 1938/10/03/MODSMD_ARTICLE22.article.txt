THERE GOES STANFORD'S BILL PAULMAN around right end, where Santa Clara's Mr. Coffer (S) dives
optimistically. Booming up to help make the tackle is Stabler (10), while filling in the background arc
Smith (13), Captain Calvelli (32), West (on his knees), and Stringari (10). Paulman, incidentally, rambled
eight yards on the play. (Photo by Larry Miller.)
