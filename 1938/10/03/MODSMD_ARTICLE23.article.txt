# Frosh Water Poloists Scrimmage Today
## 
### 
OPEN SEASON OCT. 21

FORWARDS GOOD

.1 GOALIES TURN OUT

Drilling in fundamentals only for
the past week, the frosh water polo
squad of 23 men will go into their
first practice scrimmage of the sea
son in Encina pool this afternoon,
Coach Nort Thornton has an
nounced.
With several good prospects for
backs, forwards and goal keepers
showing up during the first week
of work, only guards are needed to
round out the squad.

Fred Manwaring, left-handed for
ward from Palo Alto High, is a po
tential threat, having demonstrated
ability as a shooter. Hodley Bacon,
San Mateo, has showed promise at
center-forward.
Duncan Patty, Burlingame, who
has played both center-forward
and back, has demonstrated ability
as a guard, and may be utilized to
fill the much-needed spot if no sat
isfactory guards can be developed
from available material. Thornton
has another potential guard in
Scott Dudley, of L.A. High, but
Dudley will probably see more ac
tion in his usual positions at cenfer
baclc.

Three good goalmen have turned
up, in the persons of Edward Smith,
Lowell High, Bill Moran, Pasadena,
and Bill Ernst, San Mateo.
"Having practiced in fundamen
tals only so far, we can't tell much
about the rest of the men," said
Thornton. "After this afternoon's
scrimmage, we will know more.

"We need a guard, and will de
velop one if possible rather than
use a forward or back in that posi
tion."

The Papooses open their season on
October 21 in a game against Se
quoia High. The game will serve as
an opener to the Stanford-U.C.L.A.
conference tilt scheduled that night.
Dudley and Patty were both
named by Thornton as among the
outstanding prospects on the frosh
swim squad, the former holding the
California breast-stroke record of
1:06.4, and the latter holding the
N.C.S. two-twenty title.
