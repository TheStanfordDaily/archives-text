rnHE DAILY presents FACTS.
J. In printing the front-page pictures of certain
El Camino Real and Bayshore establishments
guilty of breaking the California state law, and
the pictures of Stanford students breaking the
state and Stanford University's laws, The Daily
is printing fact, and fact alone.
But it is needless for The Daily to make these
claims. All Stanford knows the truth of The
Daily's accusations. Stanford accepts the in
fraction of state and University law as the exist
ing order of things.
The truth is this. Certain near-by establish
ments for the sale of liquor operate illegally.
Liquor is served to minors, usually without
question, sometimes with a perfunctory inquiry
demanding proof of majority.
Stanford men and women know and expect
such extra-legal procedure. Most who drink
will resort to deception or attempts at deception
if questioned on age.
Their actions, and those of the establishment
serving them, are exactly contrary to both
California state law, and the rules and regula
tions of Stanford University.
Because part of these liable actions by Stan
lord men and women can be traced to a hazy
comprehension of the law, The Daily has
printed a comprehensive summary of state and
local regulations. Explicit, definite, authorita
tive, THEY MEAN WHAT THEY SAY.
But lack of clarification of the issue is not
alone responsible for these illegal practices.
They have come primarily because Stanford
students who drink want them. Throughout
the course of several years, a tacit, unspoken
agreement has sprung up between those stu
dents and the owners of those establishments
that no questions will be asked.
In return for relatively orderly behavior, and
a steady influx of customers, Stanford students
are being served as they ask to be served—
without question.
AND ILLEGALLY.
