FOR the benefit of those critics who feel that
Interfraternity Council's plan to have a gen
eral Pre-Initiation Period from November 28 to
December 4 is a bad one, in view of its sup
posed inconvenience and effect upon scholar
ship, it might be well to examine for a moment
this innovation which was the parting gift of
last year's Council to the Row.
Regarding its inconvenience, the argument is
easily answered. Held during a week when
there is no football game, it will leave initiates
and initiaters free to concentrate upon it; held
at a time when campus functions are closing
down due to the approach of finals, it will re
lieve them of the social activities which require
time and attention during the rest of the quar
ter. Purely an extra-curricular activity, Pre-
Initiation Period should by rights come during
the time most convenient for the individual
student. None could be more so than the end
of the quarter, when the closeness of finals
assures comparative quiet.
It is true that this very closeness to finals fur
nishes ammunition to those who feel that it will
interfere with scholarship, but here again ex
amination proves the assumption false.
Specifically stated is the fact that the period
will end one full week before finals begin—
time to start new term-papers or turn in un
avoidably late ones, time to start studying
finals, time to clean up overdue work, time to
correct false professorial impressions, time to
regain lost time. More than adequately pro
viding for such contingencies, Interfraternity
Council's plan furnishes ample opportunity—
seven days of it —in which to round out the
quarter's work before finals begin.
The only possible ground upon which critics
of the scheme could base even a passably
sound objection, indeed, would be the ground
of health: the fact that a Pre-Initiation Period
held in rain-swept November is more apt to
flood Rest Home and hospital than one held in
in-between October. But although there might

possibly be valid objection here, the advan
tages —the approach of finals, assuring freedom
from conflicting activities, the seven-day period
which more than takes care of the danger-to
scholarship problem—outweigh a hundredfold
the disadvantages.
A dignified and sensible handling of a diffi
cult problem, Interfraternity Council's plan for
Pre-Initiation Period should give the lie to those
who sometimes show a tendency to question
its good judgment.—A.S.D.

will end one full week before finals begin—
time to start new term-papers or turn in un
avoidably late ones, time to start studying
finals, time to clean up overdue work, time to
correct false professorial impressions, time to
regain lost time. More than adequately pro
viding for such contingencies, Interfraternity
Council's plan furnishes ample opportunity—
seven days of it —in which to round out the
quarter's work before finals begin.
The only possible ground upon which critics
of the scheme could base even a passably
sound objection, indeed, would be the ground
of health: the fact that a Pre-Initiation Period
held in rain-swept November is more apt to
flood Rest Home and hospital than one held in
in-between October. But although there might

possibly be valid objection here, the advan
tages —the approach of finals, assuring freedom
from conflicting activities, the seven-day period
which more than takes care of the danger-to
scholarship problem—outweigh a hundredfold
the disadvantages.
A dignified and sensible handling of a diffi
cult problem, Interfraternity Council's plan for
Pre-Initiation Period should give the lie to those
who sometimes show a tendency to question
its good judgment.—A.S.D.
FOR the benefit of those critics who feel that
Interfraternity Council's plan to have a gen
eral Pre-Initiation Period from November 28 to
December 4 is a bad one, in view of its sup
posed inconvenience and effect upon scholar
ship, it might be well to examine for a moment
this innovation which was the parting gift of
last year's Council to the Row.
Regarding its inconvenience, the argument is
easily answered. Held during a week when
there is no football game, it will leave initiates
and initiaters free to concentrate upon it; held
at a time when campus functions are closing
down due to the approach of finals, it will re
lieve them of the social activities which require
time and attention during the rest of the quar
ter. Purely an extra-curricular activity, Pre-
Initiation Period should by rights come during
the time most convenient for the individual
student. None could be more so than the end
of the quarter, when the closeness of finals
assures comparative quiet.
It is true that this very closeness to finals fur
nishes ammunition to those who feel that it will
interfere with scholarship, but here again ex
amination proves the assumption false.
Specifically stated is the fact that the period
will end one full week before finals begin—
time to start new term-papers or turn in un
avoidably late ones, time to start studying
finals, time to clean up overdue work, time to
correct false professorial impressions, time to
regain lost time. More than adequately pro
viding for such contingencies, Interfraternity
Council's plan furnishes ample opportunity—
seven days of it —in which to round out the
quarter's work before finals begin.
The only possible ground upon which critics
of the scheme could base even a passably
