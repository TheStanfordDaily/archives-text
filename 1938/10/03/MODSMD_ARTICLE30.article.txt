# Putrid Preamble

### 
WHEN The Daily said that Stanford spirit
was in the hands of Cardinals, $700, and
Stanford itself, it didn't exactly mean that Stan
ford was to pick up whole-hog the cry of "Take
off that blue hat!" before, during, and after the
Santa Clara game.
As guests of Stanford University, persons,
and women particularly, are entitled to all the
courtesy that the Farm can extend them. And
the Stanford University rooting section obvi
ously does not think so.
More than three or four times did the men's
section take up the cry. Whether the hat was
green or blue or brown makes little if any
difference. But the fact remains that the cry
was taken up.
And it sounded like one of the San Francisco
high schools or one of Southern California's
more prominent junior colleges. v
The fracas starts with one or two men with
minds which appreciate this type of humor.
It is taken up as a diversion from the more
boresome aspects of a still yet uncompleted
football game.
Maybe Stanford has a sense of humor all
its own.
Maybe, too, that sense of humor is slightly
reminiscent of over-cooked hen fruit.â€”H. L. S.
