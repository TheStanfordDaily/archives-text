### JOHN COBBS 
• STORM WARNINGS

'pHROUGHOUT the next week, freshmen will loaf
around the post office, blowing the dust out of
their mail boxes and trying to look sophisticatedly
unconcerned. No one, however, will be deceived into
thinking that the post office has become a popular
rendezvous for underclassmen or that the miracle of
communication has drawn such an audience by its
own talents. The campus knows that the freshmen
arc waiting for those little yellow cards, which like the
first snowfiakes of winter, herald the coming of the
fraternity rushing storm.
And up on the Row the boys are reading Emily
Post and moving furniture to cover holes in the rugs.
(The rugs in my own house are new, and so I can
bring up this point.) On both sides there is that vague
feeling of indigestion and uneasiness like the one that
comes just before an examination.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
VHEWED sympathetically, rushing seems to fall into
that class of events which stands midway between
acts of God and crimes with felonious intent. It is
'just one of those damn things." Evolution and hard
work have improved it considerably in past years, so
that present rushing bears the same relation to the
old-time system that a modern law-suit bears to the
ancient method of settling differences of opinion with
a club. But even so, our rushing set-up deserves all
the smouldering adjectives that have been tied to it.
Ignorant armies clashing by night do a neat and effi
cient job in comparison.
When 500 freshmen, nervous about their hair and
the set of their coats, arc mixed with an equal number
of upperclassmen, nervous about their plumbing and
the set of their mortgages, a little confusion can be
expected. And when this combination is told to sort
itself out into eternal bonds and deathless allegiances,
the result is a definition of chaos.
* * ♦ *
It is a little surprising, then, to find (hat somehow
Ihe freshmen and the houses settle out. Pledge classes
ire born amidst the travail and agony. The rushing
lasts long enough to permit reasonably intelligent ad
justment. And after the last mob scene, contentment
makes a hesitant reappearance.
And so there is no moral to draw, no advice to
give, except:
1. Don't say frat when you mean fraternity;
2. Don't eat too much or ask for seconds;
3. Pledge my house.
