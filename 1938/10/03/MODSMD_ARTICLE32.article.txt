### JOHN CLINE 
I after Saturday's track meet, we waited
in Stanford's dressing room for Tiny and the team
to come in. The boys straggled into the darkened
locker room, slowly and dejectedly. They piled their
soiled red jerseys in the middle of the floor, removed
their px-otective padding, and walked sadly into the
showers.
Bobbie Grayson and A1 Liebendorfer tried vainly
to console the fellows. Even Pool's collie dog shared
in the general gloom; he walked about with his ears
down, occasionally shoving his nose into some player's
hand, as if to say:
"Tough luck, fellow, but better luck next week."
One thing was particularly impressive; to the cor
don of San Francisco newspaper men who huddled
about Tiny in the dressing room after the game; neither
Thornhill himself, nor any member of the team alibied
for Stanford's defeat. Their only comment was:
"Santa Clara was just too damned good."
The only ray of sunshine in Stanford's dressing
room Saturday evening was Happy Jack Walton, who
stood fully clothed in the shower room and said
quite seriously:
"Never mind about the score, boys—l still say that,
man for man, Stanford has a better team than Santa
Clara.

4 FTER that we went over to the Santa Clara dress
ing room to see the fellows we went to school
there with for six months. Their handsome, quiet,
courteous Coach Buck Shaw was autographing pro
grams for high school kids . . . the team members
were friendly, sincere, and cordial. There was noth

Hawaiian end. Anahu, was speaking to a small, wide
eyed boy as sincerely as though he were addressing
a big shot sports writer. We asked one of the players
how he felt about the rout, and he said:
"Boy, we've forgotten it, and we're looking forward
to next week's game, which is going to be plenty
tough."
Santa Clara was taking its victory in stride.
