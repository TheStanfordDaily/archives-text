# Swing Novel Relates Story Of Trumpeter
## 
### 
"YOUNCJ MAN WITH A HORN," by
Dorothy Baker, on sale or for rent
at the Stanford Bookstore:
In these days when swing has
pushed up from the dime-a-dance
dive to the red seal record class,
when trucking is no longer the self
expression merely of a kitchen me-

chanic on her
night out, Doro
thy Baker writes
of Bix Bieder
becke, trumpet'
player. After Bix,
whose name is
wh i s pered with
reverence in the
best chromium
p 1 at ed drawing
rooms, is modeled

her hero, Rick Martin.
Rick was born with music in his
soul and not much of anything else.
He hung around with a bunch of
Los Angeles darkies and learned
how to play the piano and finally
the trumpet. Later on, he made big
time. He met Amy North, psychiat
rist, and married her. Now, Rick
drank a lot—always had—and when
he was good and teed out of that
trumpet of his would come jazz
that was plain ecstasy. But pretty
soon he was all shot and at 26 he
checked out. However, Rick's was
not merely the tragedy of early
death but of the inadequacy of his
medium to express his poet's soul.
(It is Miss Baker's hypothesis that
Rick was a poet.)
As a novel, "Young Man with a
Horn" is not entirely successful. In
the first place, if Rick's story has all
the glamour of a legend, it has also
much of its superficiality. The hero
himself is more of a fable than a
character. This sketchiness, com
bined with a certain slickness, per
sists in the portrayal of Amy North
—Amy who hung her Phi Bete key
on the shower curtain to remind,
herself, when swacked, of her obli
gation to her brilliance. Amy calls
to mind one of Noel Coward's brittle
darlings of the Martini-and-olive
on-a-toothpi,ck school.
The author has done a fair job of
projecting herself into the atmos
phere of her story. But her jargon
and terribly off-hand narrative
method are the sort of thing the
poker table pundit picks up in the
back-room to impress outsiders. The
real expert has fewer mannerisms.
But faults or not, because the sub
ject is hot, the theme intrinsically
romantic, "Young Man with a Horn"
is interesting stuff—very interesting.
