# Thirty-five Seek Glee Club Places
## 
### 
With thirty-five new men and
women seeking the vacancies in the
Men's and Women's Glee Clubs, Di
rector George Knoles predicts a
bang-up year. The turn-out of
freshmen was particularly gratify
ing, indicating that Glee Club work
is definitely not considered "sissy,"
but rather an opportunity for mu
sically inclined roughs to learn their
school songs, and participate in an
active student body project.
The glee clubs will co-operate
with Stagers in producing a Gaie
ties' skit, and Knoles further em
phasized the need for tenors. Re
hearsals are at the regular times to
night. For the men, at 8 o'clock in
Room 84; for the women, at 4:15
o'clock in Room 84.

Newspapers and crossword puz
zles are the favorite mental diver
sions of air travelers.
