### ARCH JENKINS 
With thai Rose Bowl dream now
something of a nightmare after last
Saturday's fiasco, the Stanford foot
ball squad will begin a reorganiza
tion program today that might find
them ready for Washington State
before the week-end.
In case the news hasn't gotten
around everywhere yet, it was a

Santa Clara team three deep in
every position that lambasted oui
Indians up and down the turf and
clear into the end zone to win thru
third straight from Stanford and
their eleventh in a row by the slim
margin of 22-0. The Broncos also
eked over two more touchdown*,
which were called back by pen
alties.

caused the crack-up of the team
