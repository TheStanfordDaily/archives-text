# Varsity Grid Squad Faces Revamping
## Guard, Tackle Spots Weak; Reserve Men May Be Moved Up 
### ARCH JENKINS 
With thai Rose Bowl dream now
something of a nightmare after last
Saturday's fiasco, the Stanford foot
ball squad will begin a reorganiza
tion program today that might find
them ready for Washington State
before the week-end.
In case the news hasn't gotten
around everywhere yet, it was a

Santa Clara team three deep in
every position that lambasted oui
Indians up and down the turf and
clear into the end zone to win thru
third straight from Stanford and
their eleventh in a row by the slim
margin of 22-0. The Broncos also
eked over two more touchdown*,
which were called back by pen
alties.

Now that every manner of wild

caused the crack-up of the team
with the "greatest backficld since
the Vow Boys." the experts have

concrete suggestions why the Card*

4. The Indians were weak at
guard and tackle, and the Sanla
CI ara offense was poured at them
all day. The defensive Bronco line '
swarmed over the ill-fated Stan
ford passers and runners almost be
fore the ball was snapped.
Moreover, many of the "experts"
afe inclined ot believe that Stun- I
ford's real first team is hidden
down in the ranks of the seconds,
thirds, and even the Grey squads. It
was from these substitute spots that
Coach Tiny Thornhill had to call on
Freddie Ledeboer, the best' back on
the field, Steve Keusself at guard,
Andy Stojkovich, the end they didn't
fool, and others like Hamp Pool and
Bill Willard.
As for the game itself, J.im Bar
low, a thorn in the side of the In
dian for two years, carried the ball
11 yards around the Stanford right
end on the Bronc's initial play of
the game. From»then on the Stan
ford team might just as well have
gone home. Everything they did was
wrong; everything the Broncs did
was close to perfection.
Halfway through the quarter
Halfback Tom Gilbert cased over
from the seven-yard line and Andy
Stojkovich blocked the kick. That
was all for the first quarter, but
Stanford threatened early in the sec
ond quarter as Glenn Hamilton and
Bill Willard came in for Norm
Standlee and Jack Clark. Hugh
Gallameau recovered a fumble on
the Bronc 47, and Paulman and Pete
Fay drove to the Bronc 2G on two
successive first down*;. However,
the drive stagnated with Hamilton's
incomplete pass over the goal.

Three minutes later one James
j Johnson, a halfback, intercepted a
■ Paulman pas sand raced 47 yards
before Paulman caught him from
behind on the Indain 8. For three
plays Stanford held the Broncs to
four yards, but Hoyt took a reverse
from Dick Clarke around right end
to score, and Bruno Pellegrini
came in to kick the point.
After the second half opened with
Barlow's brilliant 85-yard kick-off
runback to a touchdown, which was
called back to the Bronco 15 on a
clipping penalty, the Santa Clarans
really went to work. Pellegrini
and Barlow got mad and started to
ramble with Left End Jim Coughlan
i culminating their 61-yard sustained

drive with an end-around through
left tackle for the iinal touchdown. ;
That was all the scoring except the
two points on the safety scored for
the visitors by Glenn Hamilton a.s
he was nearly chased out of the end
zone by the whole Bronc line on an
attempted pass midway through the
last frame.
Once, at the end of the third
quarter, Pete Zagar partially
blocked Barlow's kick, and Pool
downed it on the Bronc 17. Fay
made a first down on the seven, but
the visitors tuok possession on a
fourth down holding penalty.
Ledeboer made several good gains
and threw a couple of good con
necting passes as the fourth quarter
waned, but Billick intercepted Paul
man's heave on the Stanford 21. The
Indians had possession on their own
35 as the afternoon's amusement
concluded.
Only consolation for the Indians
l was the fact that they were beaten
jby a championship team and ihat
they suffered few casualties. Hamp

j kicked knee as big as his dog, hilt
j Tony Calvelli and Paulman have

assortment of kicked heads and in
jured legs.

all day. The defensive Bronco line '

fore the ball was snapped.
Moreover, many of the "experts"
afe inclined ot believe that Stun- I
ford's real first team is hidden
down in the ranks of the seconds,
thirds, and even the Grey squads. It
was from these substitute spots that
Coach Tiny Thornhill had to call on
Freddie Ledeboer, the best' back on
the field, Steve Keusself at guard,
Andy Stojkovich, the end they didn't
fool, and others like Hamp Pool and
Bill Willard.
As for the game itself, J.im Bar
low, a thorn in the side of the In
dian for two years, carried the ball
11 yards around the Stanford right
end on the Bronc's initial play of
the game. From»then on the Stan
ford team might just as well have
gone home. Everything they did was
wrong; everything the Broncs did
was close to perfection.
Halfway through the quarter
Halfback Tom Gilbert cased over
from the seven-yard line and Andy
Stojkovich blocked the kick. That
was all for the first quarter, but
Stanford threatened early in the sec
ond quarter as Glenn Hamilton and
Bill Willard came in for Norm
Standlee and Jack Clark. Hugh
Gallameau recovered a fumble on
the Bronc 47, and Paulman and Pete
Fay drove to the Bronc 2G on two
successive first down*;. However,
the drive stagnated with Hamilton's
incomplete pass over the goal.

Three minutes later one James
j Johnson, a halfback, intercepted a
■ Paulman pas sand raced 47 yards
before Paulman caught him from
behind on the Indain 8. For three
plays Stanford held the Broncs to
four yards, but Hoyt took a reverse
from Dick Clarke around right end
to score, and Bruno Pellegrini
came in to kick the point.
After the second half opened with
Barlow's brilliant 85-yard kick-off
runback to a touchdown, which was
called back to the Bronco 15 on a
clipping penalty, the Santa Clarans
really went to work. Pellegrini
and Barlow got mad and started to
ramble with Left End Jim Coughlan
i culminating their 61-yard sustained

drive with an end-around through
left tackle for the iinal touchdown. ;
That was all the scoring except the
two points on the safety scored for
the visitors by Glenn Hamilton a.s
he was nearly chased out of the end
zone by the whole Bronc line on an
attempted pass midway through the
last frame.
Once, at the end of the third
quarter, Pete Zagar partially
blocked Barlow's kick, and Pool
downed it on the Bronc 17. Fay
made a first down on the seven, but
the visitors tuok possession on a
fourth down holding penalty.
Ledeboer made several good gains
and threw a couple of good con

Indians up and down the turf and

their eleventh in a row by the slim
margin of 22-0. The Broncos also

4. The Indians were weak at
guard and tackle, and the Sanla
CI ara offense was poured at them
all day. The defensive Bronco line '
swarmed over the ill-fated Stan
ford passers and runners almost be
fore the ball was snapped.
Moreover, many of the "experts"
afe inclined ot believe that Stun- I
ford's real first team is hidden
down in the ranks of the seconds,
thirds, and even the Grey squads. It
was from these substitute spots that
Coach Tiny Thornhill had to call on
Freddie Ledeboer, the best' back on
the field, Steve Keusself at guard,
Andy Stojkovich, the end they didn't
fool, and others like Hamp Pool and
Bill Willard.
As for the game itself, J.im Bar
low, a thorn in the side of the In
dian for two years, carried the ball
11 yards around the Stanford right
end on the Bronc's initial play of
the game. From»then on the Stan
ford team might just as well have
gone home. Everything they did was
wrong; everything the Broncs did
was close to perfection.
Halfway through the quarter
Halfback Tom Gilbert cased over
from the seven-yard line and Andy
Stojkovich blocked the kick. That
was all for the first quarter, but
Stanford threatened early in the sec
ond quarter as Glenn Hamilton and
Bill Willard came in for Norm
Standlee and Jack Clark. Hugh
Gallameau recovered a fumble on
the Bronc 47, and Paulman and Pete
Fay drove to the Bronc 2G on two
successive first down*;. However,
the drive stagnated with Hamilton's
incomplete pass over the goal.

Three minutes later one James
j Johnson, a halfback, intercepted a
■ Paulman pas sand raced 47 yards
before Paulman caught him from
behind on the Indain 8. For three
plays Stanford held the Broncs to
four yards, but Hoyt took a reverse
from Dick Clarke around right end
to score, and Bruno Pellegrini
came in to kick the point.
After the second half opened with
Barlow's brilliant 85-yard kick-off
runback to a touchdown, which was
called back to the Bronco 15 on a
clipping penalty, the Santa Clarans
really went to work. Pellegrini
and Barlow got mad and started to
ramble with Left End Jim Coughlan
i culminating their 61-yard sustained

drive with an end-around through
left tackle for the iinal touchdown. ;
That was all the scoring except the
two points on the safety scored for
the visitors by Glenn Hamilton a.s
he was nearly chased out of the end
zone by the whole Bronc line on an
attempted pass midway through the
last frame.
Once, at the end of the third
quarter, Pete Zagar partially
blocked Barlow's kick, and Pool
downed it on the Bronc 17. Fay
made a first down on the seven, but
the visitors tuok possession on a
fourth down holding penalty.
Ledeboer made several good gains
and threw a couple of good con
necting passes as the fourth quarter
waned, but Billick intercepted Paul
man's heave on the Stanford 21. The
