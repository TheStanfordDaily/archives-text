# Collegians of Japan Are Americanized

How are you going to get mar

"Oh," lie chuckled, "I think I
would like to see her before I marry
her. I think I like the American
way —and my parents think this way
is all right too."
This reply was made by Buddy
Iwata, Stanford senior who returns
to the campus this fall after a sum
mer vacation with his relatives in
Japan—where marriages are still
arranged by parents and compla
cency accepted by their offspring,
where traffic goes up the street on
the left and down on the right,
where a bath is a collective affair,
where there are no co-educational
universities, and where letters are
written upside down.

"1 visited Japan ten years ago,"
liuddy continued, "but on my return
this summer 1 found it much more
Americanized and industrialized
than then. The Japanese system of
marriage is becoming modified —
mainly through the protests of the
college students; but out in the
country the old custom is still ac
cepted. In Tokyo, men and women
v/alk side by side with about half
of them dressed in Japanese fashion
and half in the American fashion.
And the Japanese who have been to
the United States never lose their
yen for coffee and chocolate drink
ing. And, an American camera —
that's the great delight of the Japa
nese.

"No, the people of Japan don't re
sent their sons' having to go to war
they're patriotic. There is no so
cial or economic unrest. It's sur
prising how everything is going on
in its regular fashion in time of war.
The young college students are es
pecially alive to issues of peace and

international relations. Their social
gatherings usually begin with a se
rious discussion of world politics."

As a member of the fifth Japanese-
American Student Conference, Bud
dy has this to say:
"In times of instability as this we
are now passing through we may
think it's silly to hold conferences
with the aims and purposes of the
Japanese-American student confer
ence. But the optimistic thing is that
youth is working forward and that
youth is also desirous of peace. As
war has some basis to start, peace
must have a stronger base. Each of
us is only an individual, yet indi
viduals make up this world."

mainly through the protests of the
college students; but out in the
country the old custom is still ac
cepted. In Tokyo, men and women
v/alk side by side with about half
of them dressed in Japanese fashion
and half in the American fashion.
And the Japanese who have been to
the United States never lose their
yen for coffee and chocolate drink
ing. And, an American camera —
that's the great delight of the Japa
nese.

"No, the people of Japan don't re
sent their sons' having to go to war
they're patriotic. There is no so
cial or economic unrest. It's sur
prising how everything is going on
in its regular fashion in time of war.
The young college students are es
pecially alive to issues of peace and

international relations. Their social
gatherings usually begin with a se
rious discussion of world politics."

As a member of the fifth Japanese-
American Student Conference, Bud
dy has this to say:
"In times of instability as this we
are now passing through we may
think it's silly to hold conferences
with the aims and purposes of the
Japanese-American student confer
ence. But the optimistic thing is that
youth is working forward and that
youth is also desirous of peace. As
war has some basis to start, peace
must have a stronger base. Each of
us is only an individual, yet indi
viduals make up this world."
How are you going to get mar
ried?
"Oh," lie chuckled, "I think I
would like to see her before I marry
her. I think I like the American
way —and my parents think this way
is all right too."
This reply was made by Buddy
Iwata, Stanford senior who returns
to the campus this fall after a sum
mer vacation with his relatives in
Japan—where marriages are still
arranged by parents and compla
cency accepted by their offspring,
where traffic goes up the street on
the left and down on the right,
where a bath is a collective affair,
where there are no co-educational
universities, and where letters are
written upside down.

YOUTH DESIRES PEACE

IWATA REPORTS

JAPANESE PATRIOTIC

"1 visited Japan ten years ago,"
liuddy continued, "but on my return
this summer 1 found it much more
Americanized and industrialized
than then. The Japanese system of
marriage is becoming modified —
