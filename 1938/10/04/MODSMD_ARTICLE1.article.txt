# Dr. Mears Will Speak On Hitler
## Returning Professor Opens Tuesday Lecture Series at 7:30 Tonight 
### 
"Adolf Hitler may follow up his
conquest of Sudetenland with fur-
Iher territorial demands," predicted
Dr. Eliot G. Mears yesterday. He
will speak tonight at 7:30 o'clock in
Memorial Hall auditorium as the
first speaker in the Tuesday Lecture
Scries for the autumn quarter.
Dr. Mears, who will discuss "Eu
rope's Changing Political Geogra
phy," returned to the University last
month after a sabbatical year spent
in travel principally on the Euro
pean continent.
He believes that the German
chancellor may be contemplating the
extension of German influence
through the acquisition of territory
in Africa, since "Hitler has an
nounced he wishes no further land
in Europe, although no mention is
made of his plans with regard to
colonies."
DICTATORS' SECRETS
"It is generally recognized in Eu
rope today that Mussolini's efforts
are being directed toward an in
creased sphere of influence in the
Mediterranean region, and doubtless
there are secret understandings be
tween these two dictators regarding
French and other colonies in Africa,"
asserts the instructor.
The dismemberment of Czecho
slovakia was not unexpected, ac
cording to Dr. Mears, who explained
that more than six months ago the
majority of central Europe's popu
lation recognized that the small
democracy would be forced to make
important concessions to the Sudeten
German minority within its borders.
"During my visit in Prague last
May the situation was intense," Dr.
Mears recalled. "The jittery at
mosphere was all too apparent to
visitors as well as to statesmen and
residents. The fear of invasion from
the west was a common topic of
conversation, and the question of
what countries would be allies,
neutrals and enemies was on every
one's lips."
VISITS NEW YORK
Accompanied on the trip by his
family, Dr. Mears visited New York
and later toured the South American
continent, where he gathered mate
rial for a series of five lectures on
"Changing Problems in Political
Geography," which he later deliv
ered at the Post Graduate School of
International Studies at Geneva.
While in Europe the instructor
spent considerable time in England
and Switzerland, also making side
trips through the Mediterranean
area, and, following the Nazi in
vasion of Austria, to Vienna, Buda
pest, and Prague.

"During my visit in Prague last
May the situation was intense," Dr.
Mears recalled. "The jittery at
mosphere was all too apparent to
visitors as well as to statesmen and
residents. The fear of invasion from
the west was a common topic of
conversation, and the question of
what countries would be allies,
neutrals and enemies was on every
one's lips."
VISITS NEW YORK
Accompanied on the trip by his
family, Dr. Mears visited New York
and later toured the South American
continent, where he gathered mate
rial for a series of five lectures on
"Changing Problems in Political
Geography," which he later deliv
ered at the Post Graduate School of
International Studies at Geneva.
While in Europe the instructor
spent considerable time in England
and Switzerland, also making side
trips through the Mediterranean
area, and, following the Nazi in
vasion of Austria, to Vienna, Buda
pest, and Prague.
"Adolf Hitler may follow up his
conquest of Sudetenland with fur-
Iher territorial demands," predicted
Dr. Eliot G. Mears yesterday. He
will speak tonight at 7:30 o'clock in
Memorial Hall auditorium as the
first speaker in the Tuesday Lecture
Scries for the autumn quarter.
Dr. Mears, who will discuss "Eu
rope's Changing Political Geogra
phy," returned to the University last
month after a sabbatical year spent
in travel principally on the Euro
pean continent.
He believes that the German
chancellor may be contemplating the
extension of German influence
through the acquisition of territory
in Africa, since "Hitler has an
nounced he wishes no further land
in Europe, although no mention is
made of his plans with regard to
colonies."
DICTATORS' SECRETS
"It is generally recognized in Eu
rope today that Mussolini's efforts
are being directed toward an in
creased sphere of influence in the
Mediterranean region, and doubtless
there are secret understandings be
tween these two dictators regarding
French and other colonies in Africa,"
asserts the instructor.
The dismemberment of Czecho
slovakia was not unexpected, ac
cording to Dr. Mears, who explained
that more than six months ago the
majority of central Europe's popu
lation recognized that the small
democracy would be forced to make
important concessions to the Sudeten
German minority within its borders.
