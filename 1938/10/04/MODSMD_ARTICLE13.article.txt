LONDON, Oct. I] (UP). —British foreign policy henceforth will be
backed by superior military strength until general disarmament is
achieved. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain told Parliament and the
world today.
In retort to cries of ".Shame! Shame!" from opposition benches, Cham
berlain defended the four-power "peace of Munich." He admitted this

► "peace" was only a bare ground
work, but contended the powers
can build on it to achieve, in time, a
general peace structure.
"If there is one lesson," Chamber
lain said, "which I think we have
learned from the events of this last
week it is this: Peace is not to be
obtained by sitting still and waiting
for it to come. It requires active,
positive effort.
"I know I shall have plenty of
critics who will say I have been
guilty of facile optimism, that a
better plan would have been to dis
believe every word by the rulers of
the other great states of Europe.
"I am too much of a realist to
believe we are going to achieve our
purpose in a day. We have only
laid the foundations of peace. The
superstructures are not even begun.
For a long period now we have been
engaged in this country in a great
program of rearmament which daily
is increasing in pace and volume.
Let no one think because we signed
this agreement between the four
powers at Munich we can afford to
relax our efforts or call a halt in our
armaments at this moment.
"Disarmament on the part of this
countx-y will never be unilateral
again. We tried that once and very
nearly brought ourselves into dis
aster. If disarmament is to come
at all it must come by steps and
must come with the agreement and
active co-operation of other coun
tries. Until we know we can obtain
that co-operation and until we agree
on the actual steps which are to be
taken, we must remain on guard."
