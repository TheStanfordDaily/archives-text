# History Shows Decline in Farm Liquor Problem
## Drinking No Longer Question of Morality But of Regulation 
### 
Drinking—the simple fact of liquor
consumption at Stanford University
—is not the problem that it was
twenty years ago. The problem to
day concerns itself more with the
infraction of certain rules and reg
ulations, rather than with the moral
grounds behind those rules.
It was not always so, however, as
records will testify. At the time
that the Board of Trustees' ruling
concerning liquor at Stanford Uni
versity was made, Stanford's repu
tation had a distinctly ill-savory
odor. Flanked by Menlo Park and
Mayfield, two dirty little towns,
nightly treks to and from the cam
pus occupied the nocturnal time of
most Stanford men.
MAYFIELD CLEAN-UP
Little was done and relatively
nothing was said by the authorities
until the enfranchisement of May
field, and its accompanying clean-up,
made walking to Menlo a serious
problem. Liquor came to the Cam
pus as it went out of Mayfield.
In 1906, with the resignation of an
incumbent Committee on Student
Affairs and the incoming of a new
one, an appeal was made by the
administration for student control—
"a gentleman's agreement," but little
was actually done to enforce the
spirit of "gentlemanly drinking."
With liquor firmly entrenched on
the campus, immediate advantage of
the lax Committee was taken. Oc
casional articles in student publica
tions bemoSned the fact that "the
fellows will not meet them (the
Committee) half way." But other
than these rather weak comments,
the Campus was allowed to run
wide open.
WILBUR REPORTS
Independently, however, a Cam
pus Civic Federation was organized
(1907), which entrusted to Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, then a practicing
physician on the Campus, the task
of making a report on existing con
ditions. The report was subse
quently filed, but apparently was
going unheeded until an accident
startled the campus into action.
An intoxicated student, returning
home from Menlo early one morn
ing (February 5, 1908), entered the
wrong house in Palo Alto, was mis
taken for a burglar, and shot to
death.
Within two days, the Board of
Trustees met and issued the reso
lution declaring drunkenness to be
grounds for expulsion from Stan
ford. Two weeks following the Aca
demic Council resolved to support
the Board of Trustees, and shortly
after, the Committee on Student
Affairs formulated an explicit code
to govern Campus liquor.
Hie spark of the accident flared
into a flame of student antagonism
at the rather stringent phrasing of
the Committee's resolution.
The night of publication of the
statement, a parade of student ob
jectors was organized to protest the
action. Because of "objectionable"
incidents occurring in the course of
the evening, the administration took
steps to punish the, more flagrant of
fenders in the project. Immediate
suspension of 12 students involved
was the result.
Student feeling still ran to mass
protest, but the Committee refused
to reconsider its action when 247
men petitioned to be recognized as
equally blameful for the parade and
its accompanying insults.
JUSTICE OBTAINED
Satisfaction to the ruling was ob
tained when the 247 were notified
that they would be given individual
hearings. An apology from the en
tire student body acknowledging its
regret for the parade was presented
to the committee.
The committee, still refusing to be
placated, declared that it must take
some action, and in doing so re
considered the case of the original
12, whom it grouped with the other
247 petitioned.
Some of these it later suspended,
to others it added five units to grad
uation requirements. Student feel
ing continued to run in direct oppo
sition, but gradually cooled as prom
inent alumni and other California
residents expressed approval of the
committee's stand.
Gradually, however, student and
faculty relations were amicably
settled and general approval, from
both groups, was expressed during
the following year.

Hie spark of the accident flared
into a flame of student antagonism
at the rather stringent phrasing of
the Committee's resolution.
The night of publication of the
statement, a parade of student ob
jectors was organized to protest the
action. Because of "objectionable"
incidents occurring in the course of
the evening, the administration took
steps to punish the, more flagrant of
fenders in the project. Immediate
suspension of 12 students involved
was the result.
Student feeling still ran to mass
protest, but the Committee refused
to reconsider its action when 247
men petitioned to be recognized as
equally blameful for the parade and
its accompanying insults.
JUSTICE OBTAINED
Satisfaction to the ruling was ob
tained when the 247 were notified
that they would be given individual
hearings. An apology from the en
tire student body acknowledging its
regret for the parade was presented
to the committee.
The committee, still refusing to be
placated, declared that it must take
some action, and in doing so re
considered the case of the original
12, whom it grouped with the other
247 petitioned.
Some of these it later suspended,
to others it added five units to grad
uation requirements. Student feel
ing continued to run in direct oppo
sition, but gradually cooled as prom
inent alumni and other California
residents expressed approval of the
committee's stand.
Gradually, however, student and
faculty relations were amicably
settled and general approval, from
both groups, was expressed during
the following year.
Such a problem no longer faces
the University nor is there any indi
cation that such a problem will arise
It is from the circumstances above,
however, that the University regu
lations on drinking have arisen.
Drinking—the simple fact of liquor
consumption at Stanford University
—is not the problem that it was
twenty years ago. The problem to
day concerns itself more with the
infraction of certain rules and reg
ulations, rather than with the moral
grounds behind those rules.
It was not always so, however, as
records will testify. At the time
that the Board of Trustees' ruling
concerning liquor at Stanford Uni
versity was made, Stanford's repu
tation had a distinctly ill-savory
odor. Flanked by Menlo Park and
Mayfield, two dirty little towns,
nightly treks to and from the cam
pus occupied the nocturnal time of
most Stanford men.
MAYFIELD CLEAN-UP
Little was done and relatively
nothing was said by the authorities
until the enfranchisement of May
field, and its accompanying clean-up,
made walking to Menlo a serious
problem. Liquor came to the Cam
pus as it went out of Mayfield.
In 1906, with the resignation of an
incumbent Committee on Student
Affairs and the incoming of a new
one, an appeal was made by the
administration for student control—
"a gentleman's agreement," but little
was actually done to enforce the
spirit of "gentlemanly drinking."
With liquor firmly entrenched on
the campus, immediate advantage of
the lax Committee was taken. Oc
casional articles in student publica
tions bemoSned the fact that "the
fellows will not meet them (the
Committee) half way." But other
than these rather weak comments,
the Campus was allowed to run
wide open.
WILBUR REPORTS
Independently, however, a Cam
pus Civic Federation was organized
(1907), which entrusted to Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, then a practicing
physician on the Campus, the task
of making a report on existing con

quently filed, but apparently was
going unheeded until an accident
startled the campus into action.
An intoxicated student, returning
home from Menlo early one morn

Within two days, the Board of
