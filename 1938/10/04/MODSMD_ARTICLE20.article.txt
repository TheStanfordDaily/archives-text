# Group Advocates Action on Liquor
## Independent Committee of Six Scores Daily for Sensationalism 
### 
After considering the question of drinking at Stanford ;is presented
yesterday in The Daily, six prominent men and women met independ
ently last night and concluded that action must not end with a temporary
campus furor, hut must he taken up by higher authorities.
Meeting independently of other interested groups, the body included
Student Body President H. Is. I x?e, John Dern, head Encina sponsor, Jack

♦ Calderwood, Lyle Cook, Bud Ms-
DuHie, Intcrfratcrnity Council presi
dent, and Mary Morris Boggs.
After scoring The Daily for its
sensational methods in presenting
what the group considered a nec
[ essary comment on existing condi
tions, they stated the belief that im
mediate action by state authorities
was the next move to insure en
forcement of state laws.
Student leaders capable of aiding
such authorities, the group stated,

Dean of Men John Bunn will
speak Wednesday noon in the Nit
ery at the first meeting of the
Stanford Luneheon Cluh, it was
announced yesterday. Anyone in
the University may come to thc*e
luncheons. Admission is 25 cents.

were under obligation to offer com
plete co-operation with the execu
tors of California statutes.
In commenting upon the conclu
sions of the student group, Tom Kil
lefer, student manager, held beliefs
contrary to the group, stating:
"The purpose of clarification
which The Daily has advanced for
their actions is an excellent one;
likewise, efforts to prod state au
thorities into action may have good
results.
"However, I believe that such ac
tion would be poor judgment for the
following reasons:
"1. It will appear that The Daily
is tampering with politics.
"2. The great amount of bad pub
licity which Stanford would receive
may possibly outweigh the good ef
fects of such action."
In considering the local problem
of drinking on campus in direct vio
lation of rulings by the Board of
Trustees, this body held the opinion
that Stanford authorities were now
directly confronted with the neces
sity of completely clarifying their
stand on such matters. Further, the
group believed that they, and other
campus leaders, were obligated to
offer administrative officers com
plete assistance.
JUSTIFIES STAND
Justifying the above statements,
the informal council of six ad
vanced major reasons for reaching
such conclusions:
1. State and local restrictions are
by very nature meant to be obeyed.
Every step ot enforce such restric
tions must be taken.
2. Entrance into the Stanford so
ciety, and signatureof the honor
code carries with it, in spirit if not
actual writing, the implication of
complete acceptance of Stanford's
codes.
IS LIFE TRAINING
3. Stanford men and women are
not here to be nursed through a
trial society. Stanford's restrictions
and their acceptance by Stanford
students is merely a training for a
life after college hedged in with re
strictions more numerous and more
severe than Stanford.
This morning the committee will
meet with administration heads to
discuss the conclusions from their
meeting last night. From this con
ference it is hoped that definite
plans for student action will be con
sidered and carried out.

After scoring The Daily for its
sensational methods in presenting
what the group considered a nec

plete co-operation with the execu
tors of California statutes.
In commenting upon the conclu
sions of the student group, Tom Kil
lefer, student manager, held beliefs
contrary to the group, stating:
"The purpose of clarification
which The Daily has advanced for
their actions is an excellent one;
likewise, efforts to prod state au
thorities into action may have good
results.
"However, I believe that such ac
tion would be poor judgment for the
following reasons:
"1. It will appear that The Daily
is tampering with politics.
"2. The great amount of bad pub
licity which Stanford would receive
may possibly outweigh the good ef
fects of such action."
In considering the local problem
of drinking on campus in direct vio
lation of rulings by the Board of
Trustees, this body held the opinion
that Stanford authorities were now
directly confronted with the neces
sity of completely clarifying their
stand on such matters. Further, the
group believed that they, and other
campus leaders, were obligated to
offer administrative officers com
plete assistance.
JUSTIFIES STAND
Justifying the above statements,
the informal council of six ad
vanced major reasons for reaching
such conclusions:
1. State and local restrictions are
by very nature meant to be obeyed.
Every step ot enforce such restric
tions must be taken.
2. Entrance into the Stanford so
ciety, and signatureof the honor
code carries with it, in spirit if not
actual writing, the implication of
complete acceptance of Stanford's
codes.
IS LIFE TRAINING
3. Stanford men and women are
not here to be nursed through a
trial society. Stanford's restrictions
and their acceptance by Stanford
students is merely a training for a
life after college hedged in with re
strictions more numerous and more
severe than Stanford.
This morning the committee will
meet with administration heads to
discuss the conclusions from their
meeting last night. From this con
ference it is hoped that definite
plans for student action will be con
sidered and carried out.
