"It is absolutely imperative for
the continuance of democracy in
America that some sort of mass
pressure be affected to stop the
spread of fascist tendencies in this
country," Mark Hopkins, former
Cardinal president and one-time
head man on .the local chapter of
the American Student Union, told a
Daily reporter recently in giving his
reasons for accepting a position as a
regional organizer for the A.S.U. in
Ohio.
"Because I feel the A.S.U. is one
of the most effective avenues
through which fascism can be stop
ped in America," he said, "I am go
ing to forego graduate work in the
School of Business at Harvard and
devote all of my time to the A.5.U.,"
Hopkins said.

After attending the Leadership
Institute conducted by the A.S.U.
last summer, Hopkins sat in at the
