# Drama Professor To Talk on Radio
## 
### 
Citing Ferdinand the Bull as the
perfect example of the objective
mind, Dr. James Gordon Emerson,
associate professor of speech and
drama at Stanford, commented
yesterday on his radio talk, "Objec
tivity and Mr. Jones," to be given
over Station KGO next Monday
evening at 9:30 o'clock.
"Ferdinand," Dr. Emerson con
tinued, "unlike his subjective broth
ers who pawed and cavorted, just
sat among his flowers and was un
impressed. Even when the bumble
bee stung him, and he was betrayed
into a momentary display of passion
that marked him for a fate better
merited by his emotional friends, it
was his objective mindedness in the
bull ring that saved him in the
end."
Dr. Emerson will attempt to "rally
the Mr. Joneses around the banner
of hard-headed objectivity, in an
age when every question is so framed
that, no matter how you word your
answer, it always means 'yes'."
