# Critic Pans Sonja Henie In New Show
## 
### 
Don't go see MY LUCKY STAR,
currently falling at the Stanford i
Theater with thiek-thighed Sonja
Henie and new-find Richard Greene, j
I For laughs it isn't nearly so funny
j as a Hearst editorial.
It is not good.
For melodrama MY LUCKY STAR
doesn't hold a candle to Dostoevski, j

It is very bad.
With a complete
absence of origi
nal ideas, with a
total lack of new
methods of han
dling the old ones,
MY LUCKY
STAR was pro
duced.
You will waste
your money.
It's all about
some little shop-

girl who gets sent to Plymouth Uni
i versity by an exclusive Fifth Avenue
] store on the provision that she
i model their clothes there on the sly.
She does. She is queen of the ice
j carnival, has the lad who is engi
i neering * Plymouth's gravy train,
I whom I personally considered a
louse, fall in love with her. Now
| you wouldn't want to see that,
would you?
The picture stinks.
After all these paragraphs I'm
amazed at my own incompetency in
saying how really awful MY LUCKY
STAR is. But even if it doesn't get
the Academy Award for the worst
; 8000 feet of exposed film during
1938, even if Darryl F. Zanuck does
| get a big brass Oscar at the end of
i the year, MY LUCKY STAR will
still go dpwn in motion picture an
nals as the film that once and for
all showed what happens if random
celebrities are starred instead of
actors. Here they used a famed ice
skater, a notorious strip-teaser, and
an unidentified Englishman. But to
i Hollywood any Englishman — with
lan English accent —they think is a
| celebrity.
Worst of the bad scenes: Fade into
! a shot of the heroine and hero sit
j ting in Plymouth University's ver
! sion of the Cellar. "Why do you
; look so sad?" she asks. "Oh," he
replies out of a clear sky, "I'm grad
: uating." Nothing in the plot had
j even so much as suggested this be
i fore.
| On the same bill, of course, was
another feature, the name of which
j I can't recall.

The tortoise is one of the world's
most perfect streamlined creatures,
yet is one of the slowest.

Don't go see MY LUCKY STAR,
currently falling at the Stanford i
Theater with thiek-thighed Sonja
Henie and new-find Richard Greene, j
I For laughs it isn't nearly so funny
j as a Hearst editorial.
It is not good.
For melodrama MY LUCKY STAR
doesn't hold a candle to Dostoevski, j

It is very bad.
With a complete
absence of origi
nal ideas, with a
total lack of new
methods of han
dling the old ones,
MY LUCKY
STAR was pro
duced.
You will waste
your money.
It's all about
some little shop-

girl who gets sent to Plymouth Uni
i versity by an exclusive Fifth Avenue
] store on the provision that she
i model their clothes there on the sly.
She does. She is queen of the ice
j carnival, has the lad who is engi
i neering * Plymouth's gravy train,
I whom I personally considered a
louse, fall in love with her. Now
| you wouldn't want to see that,
would you?
The picture stinks.
After all these paragraphs I'm
amazed at my own incompetency in
saying how really awful MY LUCKY
STAR is. But even if it doesn't get
the Academy Award for the worst
; 8000 feet of exposed film during
1938, even if Darryl F. Zanuck does
| get a big brass Oscar at the end of
i the year, MY LUCKY STAR will
still go dpwn in motion picture an
nals as the film that once and for
all showed what happens if random
celebrities are starred instead of
actors. Here they used a famed ice
skater, a notorious strip-teaser, and
an unidentified Englishman. But to
i Hollywood any Englishman — with
