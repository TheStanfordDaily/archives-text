WHY DO PEOPLE
LIKE WATER POLO
Do spectators like to see a splash,
or is it that they like to watch men
half drowning themselves? There
must be some reason for the miracu
lous increase in crowds at water polo
games in the past several years.
It would not be safe to say that
spectators get their thrills at water
polo games because everybody plays
dirty. Of course, it is perfectly easy
for a player to foul his opponent
under water where the referee's*
eyes, cannot see, and players are
sometimes judged by the skill with i
which they commit a foul without |
being seen. But coaches frown on
that type of skill. Still, whether the
coaches like it or not, fouling is
still hard to do cleverly, players still
do it, and it still adds spectator in
terest to water polo.
Perhaps water polo fans are
sadists and attend games only be
cause they have heard it is one of
tlie roughest sports in existence.
It does look rough from the grand- ;
stands, but players seldom sustain
permanent injuries. A little water I
slows down a punching fist or a
kicking knee considerably.
American water polo—internation-

al water polo is
played at Stanford
—is a great deal
rougher. It is
played more in
the East but is
slowly going out
of existence there.
Water polo is
fast and exciting

from the opening whistle until the
game is over. Playing time for a
whole contest is only 14 minutes,
which is about all a player can
stand. Considerable skill is involved
in handling the ball with one hand,
and one must make his tosses fast
so that the ball will go where he
wants it to go before his opponent
pushes him to the bottom of the
pool.

Whatever the attraction is, it is
going to be even greater at Stan
ford this year. Coach Nort Thorn
ton has planned an offense that
will speed up Card games consid
erably. He lias adopted the so
called Hungarian system, which
means plenty of short passes and
fust breaking. Instead of placing
a large part of the responsibility
on one man in the hole, there will
be (wo and sometimes three
swimmers in good spots for goal
scoring.
The whole offense, and perhaps
the Pacific Coast championship, will
depend on the center forward and
center back positions, which will be
held this year on the first string by
808 PLATE and HARV ROTHS
CHILD. This pair, operating in the
center of the pool, from which all
scoring plays will grow, will have to
click if the new system is to work.
And from all appearances in early
practice sessions, it looks as though
Nort has hit the jack-pot.
In the past 25 years, Stanford
waterpolo teams have claimed the
Coast crown 22 times. Last year
the team dropped to the cellar.
But this season there will be more
experienced veterans and some
excellent sophomores with a good
chance of renewing the old record.

mains mainstay of the team in the
right forward spot opposite JACK
LOUPE, on the left. GORDY
JAMIESON, DAVE NOTTAGE, and
BILL WEEDEN, sophomores, fol
low close behind to strengthen the
forward wall as reserves.
DICK HOOVER, who palyed a
brilliant game at right guard in his
first season of competition last year,
remains outstanding guard of the
squad. He will be aided on the
other side by TED MORENO,
BRUCE JESSUP, or BILL HATCH.
Entering varsity competition for
the first time after sensational work
on last year's freshman aggregation,
ROY VITOUSEK will handle the
goal-guard spot ably, and few points
will be made against him.
