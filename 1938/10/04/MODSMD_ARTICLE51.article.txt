FROM the deluge of campus wrath follow
ing the action of The Daily in commenting
upon Stanford's attitude to liquor, two ques
tions stand clear:
1. What person or group is behind The Daily's
action?
2. What plan or idea prompted such strin
gent action?
In answer to these two major questions, The
Daily has this to say:
In opening such a campaign, The Daily was,
and is acting independently of any student or
faculty group. Though asking support from
administration and campus leaders, this edi
torial board initiated and has carried out inde
oendently the entire project.
Furthermore, The Daily's plan of action, al
ready completed, will be open to change only
by the editor or his immediate advisers who
originally conceived and executed The Daily's
actions.
THE DAILY IS ACTING INDEPENDENTLY.
The purposes of such action are too complex
and far-reaching to be stated casually, or indeed,
briefly if justice is to be done to them.
Initially, The Daily is interested in clarifying
state and Stanford laws concerning consump
tion of liquor, in presenting those statutes so
clearly that Stanford must understand them
without a shadow of doubt. With such a pur
pose, yesterday's statements concerning minors
reflect not so much upon the establishments
alluded to, but more directly upon the men and
women who provoke violation of those laws.
In the long run, The Daily is only indirectly
concerned with outside agencies implicated in
the question. Primarily, The Daily believes that
the infraction of law by minors is a matter for
the campus to consider and to act upon.
Facts have been presented. It is for the cam
pus to decide how they will receive them.
The state has already made its stand clear
on The Daily's action. With commendable
swiftness communication was established by the
Board of Equalization and The Daily in an ef
fort to carry action outside campus territory.
The students, those who lead and direct stu
dent opinion, have also spoken. They question
the value of The Daily's stand on the grounds
that only complete co-operation with state offi
cials can bring direct results within Stanford.
The group is sincere in its belief. Members
speaking have been in a position to see many
unsuspected results of broken Stanford codes.
Acting upon careful preparation and careful
planning, The Daily, however, persists in the
belief that this is Stanford's problem, and Stan
ford's alone. The reflections of the committee
that Stanford men and women require outside
agencies to enforce the codes which they have
accepted by entering the university society, are
directly contrary to the tenet of individual re
sponsibility which Stanford supports.
The student committee has challenged Stan
ford to handle its own affairs. Their alternative
<action is complete co-operation with outside au
/horities, plus the attendant display of Stanford's
own inability to act for themselves.
That challenge should not go uncontested.
Stanford must, on its own initiative, decide
whether it will choose to accept its own codes,
or whether it must be forced to do so.
