# Scalping Indians
## 
### 
STANFORD'S Indians war-danced their way
toward the B.A.C. yesterday and unexpect
edly found an excellent opportunity to help lift
a few scalps when they got there.
Primary objective of the all-school trek was

to buy Cal and S.C. football tickets. Instead, the
Great Spirit leered profusely and sent one of
his San Francisco representatives to buy root
ers' tickets for those who would lend them
their names and student body cards long
enough to buy 150 regular tickets.
Legally, no reprisals can be taken as long as
scalpers have Federal licenses, according to
A1 Masters.
The system of ticket-selling which is being
used by the B.A.C. this year was designed to
fill all Farm requests for major game tickets.
This it cannot do if such a practice continues.
Only action which Mr. Masters can take is
to seize student body cards of those concerned
if the practice does continue. This he does not
want to do, but is prepared for such a contin
gency.
If for no other reason than to protect itself
for future ticket sales, the Farm should realize
that if students persist in making such deals, it
is depriving alumni and other supporters of
Stanford football from attending the games.
Which might mean lifting its own scalp from
the neck up.â€”H. L. S.

The Daily and editorial board will gather all
its muchly maligned staff members together
today to instruct local newshawks on just what
they can tell curious, cautious, and contemptu
ous critics.
Editorial Board will mull things over in its
collective brain at 1 o'clock, will spout its
learned conclusions at 1:15 o'clock for the bene
fit of lesser staff members.
