### JOHN COBBS 
THE CALL OF THE SMILE
■ F EVERYTHING goes off according to the scenario,
the Press Building will echo, this afternoon, to the
tramping feet of a new set of tryoutees. Today they
will mill around jolly-up fashion, fill out slips, and
warm to the radiance of the Woman's Editor's smile.
After a while they will huddle around the copy desk
with a mouldy sandwich in one hand and a chewed
pencil in the other, wondering why they didn't go out
for debating.
There is something about this perennial scene that
gives me a touch of nostalgia. It makes me think back
to the time when I was lured by the smile of a Woman's
Editor, and hitching up my too-well-pressed trousers,
trotted into the Shack.
By now I have forgotten exactly what I expected
to find inside. As I remember if, I was looking for
ward to meeting people who wore battered felt hats on
the backs of their heads and who addressed each other
as "Sister" and "Big Boy."
Since then I have changed my ideas. But even so,
there is no real advice I can give to those who want to
tread the straight and narrow hall that lies beyond
the Shack's splintered steps. The Daily resembles a
combination of an Old Testament miracle and a scene
from the Book of Revelations. Like love and religion,
it has to be taken on faith.
* * * *
VF/ITH my nose playing in offensive position against
the Underwood grindstone, I can say one thing
authoritatively. The Daily is not a soft activty. It
can take more time than God saw fit to put into one
day. And it can wear the point off of a copy pencil
like a child licking a candy stick. It develops vocabu
laries and cigarette consumption to the point where
every contact with civilized people becomes a fight
to prevent mass production of faux pas.
And yet everybody on the sheet seems to enjoy it.
Perhaps it is the thrill of creation. Or perhaps it is
the artistic joy that comes from watching the tender
flower of thought unfold and blossom either into
skunk cabbage or into orchid, according to the opinion
of the reader.
And then, of course, there are those ancient rea
sons, now eligible for social security, which can be
found in any frosh bible—friendships, well-rounded
education, feeling of accomplishment.
It all adds up into a pleasant little paradox that
should intrigue the psych department.
* # * *
And so this afternoon when I sit before this Under
wood egg-beater, I shall listen for the sound of feet
tripping on the loose edging of the Press Building
stairs. And I shall wonder what would have happened
if my Woman's Editor had gotten indigestion and
hadn't smiled.

After a while they will huddle around the copy desk
with a mouldy sandwich in one hand and a chewed
pencil in the other, wondering why they didn't go out
for debating.
There is something about this perennial scene that
gives me a touch of nostalgia. It makes me think back
to the time when I was lured by the smile of a Woman's
Editor, and hitching up my too-well-pressed trousers,
trotted into the Shack.
By now I have forgotten exactly what I expected
to find inside. As I remember if, I was looking for
ward to meeting people who wore battered felt hats on
the backs of their heads and who addressed each other
as "Sister" and "Big Boy."
Since then I have changed my ideas. But even so,
there is no real advice I can give to those who want to
tread the straight and narrow hall that lies beyond
the Shack's splintered steps. The Daily resembles a
combination of an Old Testament miracle and a scene
from the Book of Revelations. Like love and religion,
it has to be taken on faith.
* * * *
VF/ITH my nose playing in offensive position against
the Underwood grindstone, I can say one thing
authoritatively. The Daily is not a soft activty. It
can take more time than God saw fit to put into one
day. And it can wear the point off of a copy pencil
like a child licking a candy stick. It develops vocabu
laries and cigarette consumption to the point where
every contact with civilized people becomes a fight
to prevent mass production of faux pas.
And yet everybody on the sheet seems to enjoy it.
Perhaps it is the thrill of creation. Or perhaps it is
the artistic joy that comes from watching the tender
flower of thought unfold and blossom either into
skunk cabbage or into orchid, according to the opinion
of the reader.
And then, of course, there are those ancient rea
sons, now eligible for social security, which can be
found in any frosh bible—friendships, well-rounded
education, feeling of accomplishment.
It all adds up into a pleasant little paradox that
should intrigue the psych department.

And so this afternoon when I sit before this Under
wood egg-beater, I shall listen for the sound of feet
tripping on the loose edging of the Press Building
stairs. And I shall wonder what would have happened
if my Woman's Editor had gotten indigestion and
hadn't smiled.
THE CALL OF THE SMILE
■ F EVERYTHING goes off according to the scenario,
the Press Building will echo, this afternoon, to the
tramping feet of a new set of tryoutees. Today they
will mill around jolly-up fashion, fill out slips, and
warm to the radiance of the Woman's Editor's smile.
After a while they will huddle around the copy desk
with a mouldy sandwich in one hand and a chewed
pencil in the other, wondering why they didn't go out
