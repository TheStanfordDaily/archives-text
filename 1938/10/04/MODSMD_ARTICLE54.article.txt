the large one onto the dance floor.
Then there was quite a suave looking frosh who
was dancing with a sponsor. From what I hear the
sponsor was thoroughly enjoying herself—until the
frosh stopped in the middle of a dance and said, "Gee,
I wish I could dance with someone besides sponsors."

But: One day last spring Dr. Wilbur was walking
along in front of Memorial Church. A friend of mine
passed him iust then and steeled himself for a timid,
"Hello, in response to Dr. Wilbur's expected greeting.
Instead Dr. Wilbur pointed to the rafters of the
Chapel. "Bees," he said. "They're building their nests."
And as he went by he said over his shoulder, "A per
son could catch them if he went about it properly."
