# CAMPUS OPINION
## ANENT LIQUOR BLAST 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Though we realize that many oth
ers besides ourselves will feel called
upon to speak their piece anent yes
terday's Dippy, we should like to
add our two cents worth to what
promises to be a very large sum
indeed.
The article was entirely unneces
sary. It stated no facts not already
known to the students. It failed to
indicate any policy. The only thing
accomplished by it was to insult
both the student body and the pro
prietors of the establishments in
question.
The article was an impertinent
criticism of both local and state au
thorities. Can the editors of The
Daily be so naive as to suppose that
the authorities were ignorant of the
fact that the establishments men
tioned were serving to minors?
ANSWER "OBVIOUS"
Why, then, should they allow
those establishments to remain in
business ILLEGALLY? The answer
is obvious. The authorities undoubt
edly would rather have Stanford
minors drinking in fairly respectable
places, such as L'Omelette, than
have them drink in "dives" off the
beaten path where their consump
tion of alcohol would be completely
out of control. It is only by a sane
compi'omise between ideal and real
conditions that legal systems can be
made to work, as men with any
amount of experience can testify.
The article exposed the personnel
of the University to unfavorable
comment. It was itself in bad taste.
It also raises some question in the
minds of others as to the ability of
Stanford men and women to look
after themselves.
Moreover, it will defeat its own
purpose in one way, for the very
persons with whom The Daily is in
sympathy will be led to believe that
Stanford is a sink-hole of iniquity
and will prefer to have their chil
dren go to other institutions less
corrupt.
The University authorities will
now be presented with the difficulty
of making good on this "blast." They

must either make a scape-goat of
some student, or a group of students,
or be told that since they do not
"enforce" University regulations,
they have no right to permit a
student organ to tell others to en
force theirs.
Finally, as a warning to students,
or as a threat to violators of these
codes. The Daily article was a mag
nificent flop. A student paper, rep
resenting a student body which is
largely minor as opposed to adult,
does not possess the authority nec
essary to make such a threat carry
any weight.
If there had been any thought
given to this point, and it were still
desired to issue a warning, the per
sons to do it are the University au
thorities through the offices of the
Deans of Men and Women, respec
tively. They, and they only, should
be vested with the power to make
it in their own fashion.
All in all, The Daily's comment
on the liquor situation "gives us to
think furiously upon the futility of
higher education," at least for
Daily editors.
Minor and Adult

The Editor, Sir:
Since when is it the business of
The Stanford Daily to play the part
of stool-pigeon for the Board of
Equalization? If that worthy body
cannot properly enforce the liquor
laws I fail to see why that qualifies
our noble editor for the post of
Guardian of the Laws of the State
and the Morals of the People.
Yes, I am legally an infant, but I
have been buying liquor for the past
two years without the slightest in
terference from anyone, until today.
But now the editor has trod on the
tail of a very cranky sleeping dog—l
don't imagine that this is the only
growl he will hear.
Drinking is in the nature of a
personal privilege, and it is not the
editor's duty to try to prevent my
exercising it, legally or illegally,
any more than it is my duty to see
that he doesn't buy lottery tickets.
Evidently the state is also satis
fied or it would undoubtedly enforce

the law. Who, then, wants to change I
these conditions of vicious law
vioLation? Nobody but an editor, or
whatever angel may have whis
pered in his ear.
If the duly-authorized agents of
the law want to throw me in the jug,
that's all right, because that's their
duty. But for whoever started this
stink, I have very little regard, be
cause it was a very cheap and un
called-for trick. The winds of free- !
dorn are still blowing, but they are
bearing a nasty smell which seems 1
to originate in the Daily office.

called-for trick. The winds of free- !
dorn are still blowing, but they are
bearing a nasty smell which seems 1
to originate in the Daily office.
Nauseated
The Editor, Sir:
Though we realize that many oth
ers besides ourselves will feel called
upon to speak their piece anent yes
terday's Dippy, we should like to
add our two cents worth to what
promises to be a very large sum
indeed.
The article was entirely unneces
sary. It stated no facts not already
known to the students. It failed to
indicate any policy. The only thing
accomplished by it was to insult
both the student body and the pro
prietors of the establishments in
question.
The article was an impertinent
criticism of both local and state au
thorities. Can the editors of The
Daily be so naive as to suppose that
the authorities were ignorant of the
fact that the establishments men
tioned were serving to minors?
ANSWER "OBVIOUS"
Why, then, should they allow
those establishments to remain in
business ILLEGALLY? The answer
is obvious. The authorities undoubt
edly would rather have Stanford
minors drinking in fairly respectable
places, such as L'Omelette, than
have them drink in "dives" off the
beaten path where their consump
tion of alcohol would be completely
out of control. It is only by a sane
compi'omise between ideal and real
conditions that legal systems can be
made to work, as men with any
amount of experience can testify.
The article exposed the personnel
of the University to unfavorable
comment. It was itself in bad taste.
It also raises some question in the
minds of others as to the ability of
Stanford men and women to look
after themselves.
Moreover, it will defeat its own
purpose in one way, for the very
persons with whom The Daily is in
sympathy will be led to believe that
Stanford is a sink-hole of iniquity
and will prefer to have their chil
dren go to other institutions less
corrupt.
The University authorities will
now be presented with the difficulty
of making good on this "blast." They

must either make a scape-goat of
some student, or a group of students,
or be told that since they do not
"enforce" University regulations,
they have no right to permit a
student organ to tell others to en
force theirs.
Finally, as a warning to students,
or as a threat to violators of these
codes. The Daily article was a mag
nificent flop. A student paper, rep
resenting a student body which is
largely minor as opposed to adult,
does not possess the authority nec
essary to make such a threat carry
any weight.
If there had been any thought
given to this point, and it were still
desired to issue a warning, the per
sons to do it are the University au
thorities through the offices of the
Deans of Men and Women, respec
tively. They, and they only, should
be vested with the power to make
it in their own fashion.
All in all, The Daily's comment
on the liquor situation "gives us to
think furiously upon the futility of
higher education," at least for
Daily editors.

The Editor, Sir:
Since when is it the business of
The Stanford Daily to play the part
of stool-pigeon for the Board of
Equalization? If that worthy body
cannot properly enforce the liquor
laws I fail to see why that qualifies
our noble editor for the post of
Guardian of the Laws of the State
and the Morals of the People.
Yes, I am legally an infant, but I
have been buying liquor for the past
two years without the slightest in
terference from anyone, until today.
But now the editor has trod on the
tail of a very cranky sleeping dog—l
don't imagine that this is the only
growl he will hear.
Drinking is in the nature of a
personal privilege, and it is not the
editor's duty to try to prevent my
exercising it, legally or illegally,
any more than it is my duty to see
that he doesn't buy lottery tickets.
Evidently the state is also satis
fied or it would undoubtedly enforce

the law. Who, then, wants to change I
these conditions of vicious law
vioLation? Nobody but an editor, or
whatever angel may have whis
pered in his ear.
If the duly-authorized agents of
the law want to throw me in the jug,
that's all right, because that's their
duty. But for whoever started this
stink, I have very little regard, be
cause it was a very cheap and un
called-for trick. The winds of free- !

The Editor, Sir:
Though we realize that many oth
ers besides ourselves will feel called
upon to speak their piece anent yes
terday's Dippy, we should like to
add our two cents worth to what
promises to be a very large sum
indeed.
The article was entirely unneces
sary. It stated no facts not already
known to the students. It failed to
indicate any policy. The only thing
accomplished by it was to insult
both the student body and the pro
prietors of the establishments in
question.
The article was an impertinent
criticism of both local and state au
thorities. Can the editors of The
Daily be so naive as to suppose that
the authorities were ignorant of the
fact that the establishments men
tioned were serving to minors?
ANSWER "OBVIOUS"
Why, then, should they allow
those establishments to remain in
business ILLEGALLY? The answer
is obvious. The authorities undoubt
edly would rather have Stanford
minors drinking in fairly respectable
places, such as L'Omelette, than
have them drink in "dives" off the
beaten path where their consump
tion of alcohol would be completely
out of control. It is only by a sane
compi'omise between ideal and real
conditions that legal systems can be
made to work, as men with any
amount of experience can testify.
The article exposed the personnel
of the University to unfavorable
comment. It was itself in bad taste.
It also raises some question in the
minds of others as to the ability of
Stanford men and women to look
after themselves.
Moreover, it will defeat its own
purpose in one way, for the very
persons with whom The Daily is in
sympathy will be led to believe that
Stanford is a sink-hole of iniquity
and will prefer to have their chil
dren go to other institutions less
corrupt.
The University authorities will
now be presented with the difficulty
of making good on this "blast." They

must either make a scape-goat of
some student, or a group of students,
or be told that since they do not
"enforce" University regulations,
they have no right to permit a
student organ to tell others to en
force theirs.
Finally, as a warning to students,
or as a threat to violators of these
codes. The Daily article was a mag
nificent flop. A student paper, rep
resenting a student body which is
largely minor as opposed to adult,
does not possess the authority nec
essary to make such a threat carry
any weight.
If there had been any thought
given to this point, and it were still
desired to issue a warning, the per
sons to do it are the University au
thorities through the offices of the
Deans of Men and Women, respec
tively. They, and they only, should
be vested with the power to make
it in their own fashion.
All in all, The Daily's comment
on the liquor situation "gives us to
think furiously upon the futility of
higher education," at least for
Daily editors.
Minor and Adult

The Editor, Sir:
Since when is it the business of
The Stanford Daily to play the part
of stool-pigeon for the Board of
Equalization? If that worthy body
cannot properly enforce the liquor
laws I fail to see why that qualifies
our noble editor for the post of
Guardian of the Laws of the State
and the Morals of the People.
Yes, I am legally an infant, but I
have been buying liquor for the past
two years without the slightest in
terference from anyone, until today.
But now the editor has trod on the
tail of a very cranky sleeping dog—l
don't imagine that this is the only
growl he will hear.
Drinking is in the nature of a
personal privilege, and it is not the
editor's duty to try to prevent my
exercising it, legally or illegally,
any more than it is my duty to see
that he doesn't buy lottery tickets.
Evidently the state is also satis
fied or it would undoubtedly enforce

the law. Who, then, wants to change I
these conditions of vicious law
vioLation? Nobody but an editor, or
whatever angel may have whis
pered in his ear.
If the duly-authorized agents of
the law want to throw me in the jug,
that's all right, because that's their
duty. But for whoever started this
stink, I have very little regard, be
cause it was a very cheap and un
called-for trick. The winds of free- !
dorn are still blowing, but they are
bearing a nasty smell which seems 1
to originate in the Daily office.
