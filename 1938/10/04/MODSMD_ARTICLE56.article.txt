# BULLETINS DESTROYED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Who tears off the announcements '
from the Stanford bulletin boards!
every night? The injustice of this!
could be evident to any fair-minded !
person. People come from Menlo
Park, Los Altos, and Palo Alto to
put up these bulletins (advertising
rooms for rental to Stanford stu
dents) and expect the students to'
have an opportunity to see them. ]
Probably none of them realize that I
some person tears them off every |
night, and continue under the as- I
sumption that their "for rent"
notices are still on exhibit.
We alumnae buy tickets for the
football games, help out with the j
rest homes for students, advertise in
The Daily, and it certainly fills us
with wrath to have our notices re- |
moved every single day. I may add !
this has not been done in other
years, to the writer's knowledge, but
only this present year.
Indignantly yours,
Irate ex-1915-er
P.S.: Dear Editor, I hope you will <
publish the above letter in your |
forum column, together with your!
comments. Thank you.

Wear on rear tires of an automo
bile operating on hard-surface roads
is twice that of front tires.
