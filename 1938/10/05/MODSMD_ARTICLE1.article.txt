# New Czech Government Organized
## New Syrovy Cabinet Will Possibly Break Alliance with France 
### 
PRAGUE. Oct. 4 (UP).—Czecho
slovakia tonight established a new
government of "concentrated power"
under Premier Gen. Jan Syrovy to
direct the rehabilitation of the dis
membered republic.
The revised cabinet includes
three army generals and contains
only 14 ministers as compared with
18 in the Syrovy "crisis government"
which was in power less than two
weeks. Its formation was announced
by President Eduard Benes.
An indication of the foreign pol
icy the government may follow was
seen in the front-page editorial of
the important liberal newspaper,
Lidove Noviny, which said the fu
ture of Czechoslovakia is linked
with the future of Germany.
The editorial, entitled, "Good Bye
France," stressed the strength of
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler of Germany
and Premier Benito Mussolini of
Italy.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

"Central Europe no longer exists,"
the newspaper said. "What comes
next? War between Germany and
France or between Germany and
Russia? Or an alliance of Germany
and Russia with a dividing up of
the British Empire?
"We have played the role of po
liceman long enough. We have been
deserted. The world is governed by
force, not law, therefore our place
must be alongside force.
"There is nothing left for us ex
cept to get along with Germany.
Even in commerical relations we
must refrain from any combinations
which would align us against Ger
many.
"We must recognize Hitler and
Mussolini as being more powerful
than France, which at present is
menaced on three sides—Germany,
Italy, and Spain.
"Hitler is winning one struggle
after another without fighting, ac
cording to the formula of his
'Mein Kampf'."

NEW REGIME STRONG

The new government included one
Ruthenian and conformed with
President Benes' desire for a strong
er regime of national concentration.
The former Syrovy government had
only one Slovak but the new one
included four.
It was reported simultaneously an
agreement was "in sight" on the au
tonomy demands of the nation's
3,000,000 Slovaks.
Premier Syrovy, one-eyed World
War hero and Inspector General of
the Army, was in conference with
President Benes throughout most of
the day organizing the smaller and
stronger cabinet.
The newspaper Azet had said
earlier a complete settlement of the
Slovak autonomy question would
have to be reached before the new
government was announced.

FRENCH BREACH SEEN

There were increasing reports the
"New Czechoslovakia" is ready to
break away from France and enter
into close collaboration with Ger
many and Italy.
Government leaders continued ne
gotiations with leaders of the Slovak
People's Party of the late Mon
signor Andrej Hlinka. representing
a large part of the country's 3,000.000
Slovaks in their autonomy demands.
Some informed persons said an
agreement was in sight, now the
government supposedly has consent
ed to grant autonomy providing it is
within "the framework of the re
public." Some Slovak leaders de
scribed the contemplated autonomy
as a form of federalism.

only 14 ministers as compared with
18 in the Syrovy "crisis government"
which was in power less than two
weeks. Its formation was announced
by President Eduard Benes.
An indication of the foreign pol
icy the government may follow was
seen in the front-page editorial of
the important liberal newspaper,
Lidove Noviny, which said the fu
ture of Czechoslovakia is linked
with the future of Germany.
The editorial, entitled, "Good Bye
France," stressed the strength of
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler of Germany
and Premier Benito Mussolini of
Italy.

WHAT COMES NEXT?

"Central Europe no longer exists,"
the newspaper said. "What comes
next? War between Germany and
France or between Germany and
Russia? Or an alliance of Germany
and Russia with a dividing up of
the British Empire?
"We have played the role of po
liceman long enough. We have been
deserted. The world is governed by
force, not law, therefore our place
must be alongside force.
"There is nothing left for us ex
cept to get along with Germany.
Even in commerical relations we
must refrain from any combinations
which would align us against Ger
many.
"We must recognize Hitler and
Mussolini as being more powerful
than France, which at present is
menaced on three sides—Germany,
Italy, and Spain.
"Hitler is winning one struggle
after another without fighting, ac
cording to the formula of his
'Mein Kampf'."

NEW REGIME STRONG

The new government included one
Ruthenian and conformed with
President Benes' desire for a strong
er regime of national concentration.
The former Syrovy government had
only one Slovak but the new one
included four.
It was reported simultaneously an
agreement was "in sight" on the au
tonomy demands of the nation's
3,000,000 Slovaks.
Premier Syrovy, one-eyed World
War hero and Inspector General of
the Army, was in conference with
President Benes throughout most of
the day organizing the smaller and
stronger cabinet.
The newspaper Azet had said
earlier a complete settlement of the
Slovak autonomy question would
have to be reached before the new
government was announced.

FRENCH BREACH SEEN

There were increasing reports the
"New Czechoslovakia" is ready to
break away from France and enter
into close collaboration with Ger
many and Italy.
Government leaders continued ne
gotiations with leaders of the Slovak
People's Party of the late Mon
signor Andrej Hlinka. representing
a large part of the country's 3,000.000
Slovaks in their autonomy demands.
Some informed persons said an
agreement was in sight, now the
government supposedly has consent
ed to grant autonomy providing it is
within "the framework of the re
public." Some Slovak leaders de
scribed the contemplated autonomy
as a form of federalism.
