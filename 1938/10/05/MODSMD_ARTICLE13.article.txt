# University, Excom Back Liquor Law Enforcement
## Campaign Is 'Good, Sound Citizenship,' Says Wilbur 
### 
Calling The Daily's campaign "an evidence
of good, sound citizenship at an opportune
moment " Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur conferred
yesterday morning with Deans Yost and
Bunn, and a student group consisting of
Jack Calderwood, John Dern, Lyle Cook,
and H. B. Lee.
The informal meeting was called Monday
night following the initial gathering of an
independent student group to consider the
question of drinking on and off campus.
"It is the function of a university to de
velop good citizenship, a sense of responsi
bility among those within its sphere of in
fluence. The university group must act,
therefore, to instill such attitudes at Stan-

ford," Dr. Wilbur continued.
Main subject of discusison in the
faculty-student group was on the
advisability of extending The Daily's
campaign outside Stanford's bounda
ries. Most members concluded that
the problem was primarily Stanford's
own in so far as direct action is con
cerned. Dissenting voices held that
at this time every effort should be
made to call legal forces into the
picture.
In answering the question of
whether or not publicity which
Stanford has received in the last two
days was of a harmful nature, Dr.
Wilbur emphatically believed that
the general public, particularly those
connected with Stanford in any way,
would receive comment favorably.
"The campaign can have the most
effect if the question is put squarely
up to the campus. Let them know
the laws; then let them make their
decision."
John Bunn, who will speak this
noon at Luncheon Club, agreed that
the time was ripe for an administra
tive stand. He promised that his
speech would deal largely upon the
question of liquor at Stanford. "I
will state in unequivocal terms my
own stand on the question."
