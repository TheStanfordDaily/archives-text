# Excom Starts Probe of Quad
## 'Gravy' Accusation To Be Investigated 
### 
Swinging into a study of over
large Quad profits, Ex Committee
last night appointed a special com
mittee to investigate charges that
members of the yearbook staff arc
reaping more than a justifiable share
of gravy each year.
Andy Stojkovich, Bill Turner, and
Annabelle Clarke were appointed to
the committee, with Student Man
ager Tom Killefer serving as ex
officio member.
Achieving a $3339 profit for last
year, the Quad gave its editor and
business manager $1010 each, the
customary $500 plus 30 per cent of
the profits up to $1700.
"Isn't $3300 a lot of money for a
publication like the Quad?" asked
Killefer.
Citing specific instances in which
the Quad has gained unnecessary
profit, Jack Calderwood informed
the Committee that the Quad
charges 50 cents for putting the
purchaser's name on the cover, al
though the actual cost is only 20
cents; and that seniors pay one dol
lar for pictures which actually cost
only 40 cents. Assuming that every
one in a graduating class of 500 had
both picture and name, this would
give the Quad a clear profit of $450.
Two alternative proposals to make
use of surpluses were suggested by
Killefer, who felt that the Quad
might either reduce the book price,
or turn back surplus on the basis of
expected returns into an enlarged
publication.
The first suggestion was consid
ered unsatisfactory, on the grounds
that the Quad would be smaller
every year. The second was dinged
by Editor Frank Lippman, who
stated that approximately half the
subscriptions and a fourth of the
advertising came in after Christ
mas, date suggested by Killefer for
turning profits back into the book.
