THE DAILY has been accused of failing to discriminate between
those establishments having the sole purpose of serving
liguor, and others which include dining or dancing in their
service.
This is not true.
The Daily wishes to cast no stigma, either by implication or
by direct statement, on any establishments which in part carry
on service within legal bounds. Many such establishments are
known and respected by both administration and campus for
their dinner service or for their pleasant'atmosphere.
It is no cause for complaint that Stanford patronizes those
places which fulfill legal reguiremenis, or portions of such places
operating within the law. The mere presence of any Stanford
man or woman at these places who, at the same time, is obeying
state and local codes is no ground for suspicion or implication.
Sorry would The Daily be to see the dinner service of certain
establishments disappear.
At the same time, the use of such service as an opportunity
to break legal bounds cannot be too severely combatted.
Among others, the rumor has reached The Daily that students
are being warned to avoid all establishments under the slightest
guestion. Such a warning is emphatically unfair, both to the
establishments concerned and to the men and women who have
received the warning.
They should not bear the discredit of those on the campus
who break state and Stanford laws. They themselves are clear
of guilt. They should be treated on such grounds.
Nor should the legally conducted services of any establish
ment necessarily suffer because of independent illegal practices
carried on under the same roof. As long as their legal standpoint
is clear, their reputation should not suffer at Stanford.
Let this point be definitely understood:
The Daily is not implicating innocent people, innocent estab
lishments, or innocent parts thereof.
Stanford men and women, as always, are free to go where
they please.
But the law must be kept.
