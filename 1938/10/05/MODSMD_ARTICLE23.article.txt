# Committee Gives Sanction After Two-hour Debate
## 
### 
Ex Committee last night went on record
as being "in favor of a program to prohibit
drinking by minors and to curb excessive
drinking by all students."
After mulling over Stanford's liquor
problem for two hours and five minutes, and
rejecting two previous proposals, committee
members finally passed the motion, which
was framed by Student Manager Tom Kil
lefer.
The motion was passed by show of hands,
requested by A.S.S.U. President H. B. Lec
after a verbal vote had shown some division
of sentiment.
Terming The Daily's methods of presen
tation "too sensational," members were care-

Nful not to endorse the publication's
past or future actions, although they
approved its aims.
Clarifying his stand on the situa
tion, Killefer declared himself in fa
vor of curbing liquor consumption
compliance with state and univer
sity law. He objected, however, to
extension of The Daily's present

'OBJECTIVES SOUND'

campaign.
"The Daily's objectives are wholly
sound." he said. "But we may incur
a lot of poor publicity for the Uni
versity. You have shown minors the
law. Why not let it go at that in
stead of befuddling the issue?"
Jack Calderwood, head sponsor at
Encina, brought up the subject. An
ticipating the prevalent feeling that
the current anti-liquor drive will
bring the University bad publicily,
he cited the publicity that would
arise if a student were killed in a
roadhouse or while returning home
drunk. Both of these have happened
in the past, he said.
"That kind of publicity is anything
but good," he told the committee.

URGES SUPPORT

Urging Ex Committee to support
The Daiiy, Calderwood held that
presentation of the issue by a stu
dent publication is unique, therefore
highly effective.
The head sponsor devoted many
of his- remarks to reflections on his
three years of residence in Encina
Hall.
"The freshmen are easily influ
enced," he said. "It is up to Ihis
body to get in its influence first."
Editor Jim Stone commented on
publicity that already has arisen
out of the campaign.

'PUBLICITY GOOD'

"So far it has been mostly good,
even from generally hostile publi
cations," he said. "Stanford has not
yet been represented as a hotbed of
drunken bums. Stanford students
are being shown going to bat for a
cause they believe in and believe to
be best for the University."
Setting forth The Daily's objec
tives, Stone listed (1) clarification
of the legal restrictions, and (2) pro
tection of the student's investment
in an expensive education, which in
vestment, he pointed out, is likely
to be forfeited in case of violation.

HORTON DEFENDS

Harry Horton, expressing his views
at length, defended the highway es
tablishments that serve Stanford
much of its liquor.
"They are darn clean places," he
said, "fine places where kids can con
gregate after dances and have good
clean fun and go home afterward."
He explained that they put out
students who "get buzzy." This at
taches a moral stigma to drunken
ness, he said.
