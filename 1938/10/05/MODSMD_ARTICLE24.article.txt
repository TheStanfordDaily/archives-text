# CONDENSED TEXT OF EXCOM MEETING SPEECHES
## 
### 
CALDERWOOD: "... I am con
vinced that we should take a defi
nite stand on the matter. 1 have
been around here a number of years
watching frosh, and thai is my point
of view. I am not trying to influence
the individual in his ways of drink
ing, but I am trying to make it —
and I am sure The Daily is—safe for
freshmen. I want you to know that
I represent this committee, and I
think it represents the A.S.S.U.
"I stand firmly behind anything
I say and if I say anything that is not
the view of the committee, Jim, here,
can make the correction. All this,
1 believe, is above petty politics.
"No matter where a drunk is, in
Hall or in Row, he is a nuisance to
Stanford. With that in mind, I hope
it won't change any person's opinion
of. me, or influence him in any way.

'DEFINITE STAND' ASKED

"However, we, as student leaders,
have to take a definite stand in this
matter because it is a vice that has
taken hold of our campus. It might
not be prevalent, but it can be
prevalent.
"If we are afraid of publicity. Dr.
Wilbur was in Los Angeles yester
day and when he came up he said
he saw several Los Angeles papers
and he told us about them. He said
they were all favorable in publicity
and there is nothing wrong in Stan
lord going on record and saying
they are in favor of supporting ex
isting California law in selling liq
uor to minors.

'LAWS WILL STAND'

"You will never be criticized for
.supporting the law. As long as we
are in a community that represents
private property, laws will stand,
and Stanford will not be criticized
lor recognizing those laws.
"If you are afraid of publicity,
consider the other side of it. Pub
licity might be given Stanford Uni
versity by the fact that a Stanford
student is killed in one of these
places. That has happened in the
past. Dr. Wilbur told us about it
this morning.
"Suppose a writer from some
newspaper comes through the fresh
man hall and sees somebody pack
ing in an intoxicated freshman who
can't climb upstairs. As a sponsor,
I realize that difficulty because I
have been over there watching them.
Beebs will support me there.

GRAND OPPORTUNITY

"This matter has been in our heads
a long time, and The Daily has pre
sented a grand opportunity to bring
it to a head, one way or the other.
That Ls why we are making a defi
nite stand. You can't be on the
fence.
"We are against selling liquor to
minors. The Daily campaign is a
direct way of controlling the liquor
problem in and around Stanford
and vicinity.
"Our civic-minded people have
other things to do and every once

in a while they can combat those
problems. Now, if they don't have
time, I think we, as students, do. . . .
"On the other hand, how do we
know that we are on the right track
in doing this? I think all you have
to do is look at the results. Com
pare a clean-living fellow with the
fellow who goes out and becomes a
habitual drunkard. No one wants
him. I am sure he doesn't want
himself, after a while. . . .
"The point we had in mind as an
attack is that it was right before
general election. I think that the
main point we are getting at is
selling drinks to minors. If we have
to go through a dirty political deal
to get what we want, then I think
we should do it right now, before
general election. It is the time to
do it.

EXCOM SUPPORT ASKED

"Therefore, as this council de
cided this morning, the conclusion
should be that Ex Committee give
The Daily an unqualified vote of
support. There are several reason
for this.
"The chief one, I believe, is Stan
ford's name. Every student that
comes to Stanford reflects on Stan
ford's name, either in a good man
ner or a bad manner. . . .
"When persons throughout the
state read about this attempt at
Stanford, the fact The Stanford
Daily presented it is unique. If the
Palo Alto Times presented it, it
vyould be just another article. But
Stanford is trying to do something
about it. Stanford, a leading factor
in the state of California, is trying to
wipe out the practice of serving
liquor to minors.
"My chief point is that the fresh
men are easily influenced in- their
opinions, and it is up to this body
to get their influence in first, so the
fiuence the frosh to the point where
bad.
"There are groups on the campus
that can influence the frosh, and if
they (the frosh) think it is the thing
to do, they will go out and drink.
"I think if this body goes to bat
supporting The Daily, we can in
fluence the frosh to the point whede
they can try to think for them
selves. ... I think Stanford Uni
versity should be a strong place;
it is a strong place, and will be here
a long time after these little dives on
the highway have left us, and I hope
that every one of us feels that loy
alty to Stanford, and that we will
try to do our best to eliminate the
thieves down here. . . ."
KILLEFER: "My main point . . .
after talking with several of the
faculty is that it may be poor judg
ment to drag this thing out into an
extended campaign, as I understand
you intend to do, for this reason:
"In the first place, I believe yotir
objective is a wholly sound one, and
I don't want to appear Machiavellian
in trying to tell you that it is wrong,

but I do believe this: you are apt to
incur a lot of poor publicity lor the
University. If you do, it is going to
be the type of publicity that is
going to say Stanford is a den of
iniquity' . . . and raise a lot of
questions in the minds of prospev
tive Stanford parents as to whether
their children should enter.

'ON THE FENCE'

"There is a question in my mind,
and I am on the fence on that ques
tion:
"Whether or not the good you are
going to get from going ahead with
this is commensurate with the harm
you are going to do with that kind
of publicity. 1 don't know the an
swer, and I don't think any of you
do. I think you have stated the
problem. You have shown the
minors the law on the thing. Why
not let it go at that?
"What can you gain by going on
and befuddling the issue?"
CALDERWOOD: "Whether we get
good or bad publicity is hard to say,
but we are trying to enforce the law
on something definitely good."
STONE: "I think it might be a
good idea to have some words from
The Daily's point of view.
"... We are not acting as per
sons, but as the guiding force of the
Stanford University student body.
When you go on record with any
statement whatsoever, that is how
you stand —as the leaders of Stan
ford.
"As to the question of outside pub
licity which the statements in The

! Daily have caused, it is an important
j question whether that publicity will
J be bad or good. So far, we can only
i base judgment on how bad that
publicity will be on publiicty which
J has already appeared in San Fran
cisco papers, and Los Angeles pa
pers, and over the Richfield News
broadcast last night.
"That publicity did not present
Stanford as a hot-bed of drunken
bums in any way. ... In every
case it was presented as Stanford
students going to bat for a cause in
which they believe and which they
believe would be an aid to the Uni
versity. 1 think that from now on,
outside publicity will diminish, al
most to the point of being com
pletely absent.

PAPERS 'NOT INTERESTED'

I "The papers aren't interested
I in it—it is not news. And in the sec
i ond place, as the liquor interests
I are large advertisers, anything which
I they (the papers) say contrary to
| t hose interests, or even print any
| thing which somebody else says, puts
them on the spot when it comes to
| getting their advertising. . . .
"I can see no way in which the
'publicity which Stanford will re
ceive by any action which it takes
| will do Stanford harm. It will do
I Stanford more good than probably
| anything which has happened for a
great many years, as far as building
Stanford up in the minds of mature
j persons who are looking for a place
j to send their children when the time
j comes around.

'TWO POINTS'

"Now there are two points, as far
as the campus goes, which The Daily
had in mind. The lirst of these . . .
that of clarification . . .
"It may be called a crusading spir- i
it, but it i.s not that entirely by !
any means. Look at it this way:
"The Daily, by presenting these
facts, believes that it is not only
criticizing, but is offering a chance
for protection to a large number of >
Stanford students who have not '
thought about the problem enough ;
to fully realize exactly what they !
are risking when they break state or '
Stanford laws. They have come here
for an education; a great many of
them probably have already spent a
small fortune for that education. Any
efforts to point out to them the risk
they are taking or any efforts which
we can on the campus, as student
leaders, put forth to check any risk,
seems to The Daily worth taking.
Those are the chief principles on
which The Daily started its cam
paign.
"The Ex Committee, as the stu
dent leaders, are the people who are
speaking for Stanford, and have the
opportunity to make that campaign,
make those ideas which The Daily
believes in. which the administration
believes in, which this group that
met believes in, and the whole out
side community which i.s in any
way connected with Stanford, who
heard about it — the Ex Committee
can support them for Stanford."
