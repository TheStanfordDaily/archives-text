# Britain and Italy May Sign Pact
## 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 4 (UP). — Great
Britain and Italy rapidly are solv
ing their outstanding differences and
are prepared to "wipe the slate
I clean" and put the Anglo-Italian
I pact into effect almost immediately,
1 it was reported tonight from the most
| reliable sources.
The agreement as to a formula for
| settling the questions that have ir-
I ritated the two governments for
i three years—chiefly the Spanish war
and the Ethiopian question—was un
derstood to have been reached after
j talks between Lord Perth, the Brit
ish ambassador to Rome, and Count
' Galeazzo Ciano.

FORMULA DRAWN

The formula was believed to in
clude:
1. A pledge by Premier Mussolini
! of Italy to undertake a "token with
drawal" of Italian volunteers from
i the Spanish Nationalist armies.
2. TTie Anglo-Italian pact then
wo\ild be put into effect, since the
| withdrawal of volunteers now is the
J only obstacle to that step.
3. Great Britain would recognize
I the Italian conquest of Ethiopia.
The Perth-Ciano talks were un
derstood to have brought, about an
j almost complete agreement on all
points, and it was felt there would
| be no need for Prime Minister Ne-
I ville Chamberlain to meet Mussolini
personally for anv further talks.

BRITAIN'S PLANS

Immediately after the conclusion
I of (ho London-Rome accord, Britain
| would press for a similar rapproche
ment between France and Italy,
which would include appointment of
a French ambassador to Rome. There
i has been no ambassador from Paris
at the Italian capital since Count
j Charles de Chambrun was with
drawn two years ago.
It was understood the Anglo
i Italian "slate wiping" was agreed
upon in principle during talks be
tween Chamberlain and Mussolini
jat Munich during the four-power
iconference on the Cz.ech crisis.
