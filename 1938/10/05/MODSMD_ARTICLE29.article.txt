# Grid Team To Hold First Secret Practice
## 
### 
For the first time in several
years, the Stanford football squad
will go into secret practice this af
ternoon with only bona fide news
papermen admitted.
After two days of the hardest
workouts of the entire year, Coach
Tiny Thornhill decided last night to
lock the doors before the squad be
gan scrimmage for the Washington
State game Saturday.
Meanwhile several of the much
heraided first-string line-up changes
were effected last night with other
shifts likely before game time. Big
Hampton Pool was taken out of his
left half ftpot, where he played
nearly three quarters against Santa
Clara and moved to left guard as
Chick Orme's running mate on the
second string.
Pool's exceptional speed and size
make him look like a natural if his
ailing legs can stand the rough play.

Pete Zagar has been moved from
tackle to left guard on the first
string. Corky Donahue is his run
ning mate. Thus By West and Stan
Andersen will probably play first-
String tackle with the bench-sitting
days of Donahue and West close to
an end.
With Dick Sutton hobbling around
the Quad on crutches, Thornhill
put one more name on his guard list
with the addition of Jim Sadler.
Freddie Ledeboer is slated to start
at fullback against the Cougars,
with Bill Paulman in at quarter.
Ledeboer gained consistently against
the Broncos in the few minutes he
played and can kick and pass as well
as any man on the squad.
While no starting line-ups have
been proffered as yet. Bill Willard
and Andy Stojkovich have been
running at end in a potential first
string and will probably get the
starting call Saturday.
