LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4 (UP).â€”A
great tennis family carried the Pa
cific Southwest Women's Singles
Championship back to Santa Monica,
Calif., again today when Veteran
May Sutton Bundv's dimpled daugh
ter. Dorothy, conquered Mrs. Sarah
Palfrey Fabyan of Cambridge, Mass.,
in two quick sets.
A decade ago in the twilight of
her brilliant career Mrs. Bundy
swept over an international field and
won the prized California trophy.
Today she sat in a box at Los An
geles Tennis Club and saw her
chubby, 21-year-old offspring do it
even easier, fj-4, 6-4, at the ex
pense of the pretty eastcoast matron.
Queen Mary College, University of
London, largely endowed by rela
tives of the Queen Mother, is being
rebuilt and modernized, with a new
arts building to open Otcober 12.
