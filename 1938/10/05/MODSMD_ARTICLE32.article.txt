STARTS OUTDOORS

You may have seen swimmers
training by pulling weights or you
may have seen aviators learning to
] fly from the ground.
Hut you haven't seen anything
j till you've seen Everett Dean's
hoop candidates learning to play
basketball by running around An
gell Field. And that's a good way
to start out.
Of aJi sports at Stanford, basket
ball has the longest season, and the
players this year are mostly new
j and inexperienced. So workouts on
I a gym floor will have to be long and
hard. There is only one way to get
I the players into good shape and at
the same time keep them from going
; stale. Stanford's new coach has dis
covered the way and used it when
he opened his career yesterday as
| basketball coach at a university
i famous for fine hoop teams.
"Without a doubt the Stanford
i team for the last two years was the
I number one college quintet in the
i country. John Bunn wears large
j shoes, and they'll be hard to fill,"
| admitted the likeable, unassuming
man who has left an enviable rec
ord at Indiana to come out West to
take up where Mr. Bunn left off
when he became Dean of Men.

SPRINTS AND DASHES
TO BE FEATURED

Besides keeping his boys from ;
; going stale, Coach Dean will reap !
i other advantages from outdoor,
workouts. Sprints and short dashes ;
will teach the cagers to break fast.
Zigzag running will teach them to |
change direction quickly and effec- j
lively. And the sun will have bene
' fits over electric lights in a covered
pavilion.
Stanford hoop fans need not ex
pect radical changes in tactics in j
next year's games. Dean's system Ls
I in many ways similar to Bunn's, and
, it will vary only in so far as changes ;
will fit the material.
Dean expects to put five speedy
cagers on the floor to play the
fast-breaking game that gave fans
many a thrill when the Laughing
Hoys were in their prime.
The offensive line-up with three j
men in the hole and two out will be
continued as the main aggressive I
formation. Later in the seafeon, j
Coach Dean will mix in some plays j
with three out and two in the cor- J
ners.

MAN-TO-MAN DEFENSE
TO BE STRESSED

The Indians' defense will appear I
about the same, because it will be a
combination of zone and man-to-man |
play. However, where Bunn stressed i
zone defense. Dean's system empha- i
sizes man-to-man work. At the be- 1
ginning of a game, each man will be j
assigned to an opponent on a basis '

of size, speed, and cleverness. Each
will be expected to keep his man !
covered. At the same time he will
have a zone to watch out for when |
the ball is on the opposite side of j
the court. The defense will be com- j
pact and concentrated just in front I
of the basket.
Green and inexperienced though
the new team may be, the boys
have a great deal of spirit and en
thusiasm. It will be a hard season,
and nobody has a right to expect
wonders of a coach in his first sea
son.
But Everett Dean makes no alibis j
and is ready to do his best to keep |
up the finest basketball reputation I
a college has had in recent years.

hoop candidates learning to play
basketball by running around An
gell Field. And that's a good way
to start out.
Of aJi sports at Stanford, basket
ball has the longest season, and the
players this year are mostly new
j and inexperienced. So workouts on
I a gym floor will have to be long and
hard. There is only one way to get
I the players into good shape and at
the same time keep them from going
; stale. Stanford's new coach has dis
covered the way and used it when
he opened his career yesterday as
| basketball coach at a university
i famous for fine hoop teams.
"Without a doubt the Stanford
i team for the last two years was the
I number one college quintet in the
i country. John Bunn wears large
j shoes, and they'll be hard to fill,"
| admitted the likeable, unassuming
man who has left an enviable rec
ord at Indiana to come out West to
take up where Mr. Bunn left off
when he became Dean of Men.

SPRINTS AND DASHES
TO BE FEATURED

Besides keeping his boys from ;
; going stale, Coach Dean will reap !
i other advantages from outdoor,
workouts. Sprints and short dashes ;
will teach the cagers to break fast.
Zigzag running will teach them to |
change direction quickly and effec- j
lively. And the sun will have bene
' fits over electric lights in a covered
pavilion.
Stanford hoop fans need not ex
pect radical changes in tactics in j
next year's games. Dean's system Ls
I in many ways similar to Bunn's, and
, it will vary only in so far as changes ;
will fit the material.
Dean expects to put five speedy
cagers on the floor to play the
fast-breaking game that gave fans
many a thrill when the Laughing
Hoys were in their prime.
The offensive line-up with three j
men in the hole and two out will be
continued as the main aggressive I
formation. Later in the seafeon, j
Coach Dean will mix in some plays j
with three out and two in the cor- J
ners.

MAN-TO-MAN DEFENSE
TO BE STRESSED

The Indians' defense will appear I
about the same, because it will be a
combination of zone and man-to-man |
play. However, where Bunn stressed i
zone defense. Dean's system empha- i
sizes man-to-man work. At the be- 1
ginning of a game, each man will be j
assigned to an opponent on a basis '

of size, speed, and cleverness. Each
will be expected to keep his man !
covered. At the same time he will
have a zone to watch out for when |
the ball is on the opposite side of j
the court. The defense will be com- j
pact and concentrated just in front I
of the basket.
Green and inexperienced though
the new team may be, the boys
have a great deal of spirit and en
thusiasm. It will be a hard season,
and nobody has a right to expect
wonders of a coach in his first sea
son.
But Everett Dean makes no alibis j
and is ready to do his best to keep |
up the finest basketball reputation I
a college has had in recent years.
