# Yanks Confident As Series Starts
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 5 (UP). — The I
vaunted New York Yankees' base
ball machine, hailed by many wise
men as the greatest team ever gath
ered together, today will the j
drive for its third world's champion- \
ship and a world's record against
the amazing Chicago Cubs, National
League champions who came from '
nowhere to capture the pennant in J
a blazing September finish.
The Yanks, who've broken the I
heart of every team that has chal- i
lenged their supremacy for the past j
three years, will lead with their
right-handed ace, Red Ruffing. I
The Cubs will counter with Gen- '
eral Bill Lee, the red-hot right
hander who notched 22 victories,
more than any other pitcher in the I
majors.
Lee, the tall black-thatched Loui
sianan who learned to pitch on the |
campus of Louisiana State, carries j
the fate of the Cubs on his broad j
shoulders. In their drive down the 1
stretch it was Lee, called the Gen- '
eral by his pals, who came up into
the World Series. But there will be j
no rest for the weary. The General i
must go back in there today and
start chunking all over again—this i
time against the most murderous
hitters in baseball, hitters who bang
ed out the thunderous total of 174 ;
homers during the regular season.
The Yanks moved into Chicago j
yesterday supremely confident that j
they'd take the Cubs apart in short [
order. With a pitching alignment of
Ruffing-Gomez-Pearson-Ruffing for
the first four games many of the !
Yankee partisans believe that they
have a great chance to repeat their
four straight triumph of 1932 over
the Cubs again.
