# Alcohol No. 3a

WHEN the Executive Committee of Stanford
University went on record last night as
supporting a program to enforce laws restricting
sale of liquor to minors and to curb excessive
drinking on the campus, it made itself clear that
it was supporting a general cause only, not a
policy which may already have been put into
effect.
The details of their own policy with which
Ex Committee must back up its support of such
a program will come later. Two courses, how
ever, were indicated by general discussion.
The first was a close examination of the stu
dent machine invested with the task of enforc
ing Stanford's own regulations.
The second was that careful consideration
must be given to methods used in launching
such a program of enforcement.
But whatever they may decide subsequently
concerning the question of liquor control as it
has already been presented, or on the question
of future student action, they may be satisfied
that their actions are highly commendable.
Not by The Daily necessarily, nor by outside
interests, but by those they leadâ€”the Asso
ciated Students. They were not acting as indi
viduals in their conclusions, but as the repre
sentatives of that Association. Doubtful as they
may be personally on the question of policy or
action, they have indicated clearly that Stan
ford believes in the enforcement of its own
codes.
