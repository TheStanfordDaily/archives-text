ALTHOUGH no official action has been taken,
rumor states that state officials intend to
request The Daily to present grounds for legal
complaints against certain establishments ac
cused of breaking state laws.
The Daily believes that it is in no way obli
gated either legally or morally to take such
steps.
Morally, The Daily is convinced that the place
of a newspaper is to point out existing evils and
to clarify issues, not to take over the business of
legal machinery already set up for civil author
ities.
The Daily's position must be regarded pri
marily in relation to the Stanford campus; its
direct actions must be "taken on problems con
cerning that campus and need not concern itself i
with what should be routine activity of outside
organizations.
However, the action of The Daily in relation
to the campus may have and should have a
strong effect on those outside groups. In pre
senting certain facts, the opportunity has been
given for sincere law-enforcing agents to pro
ceed under their own jurisdiction to curb infrac
tions of state codes.
But The Daily will not tamper with matters
which the civil authorities are better constituted
to handle. Machinery and court methods are
explicitly set forth in the Political Code and in
sections of the Alcohol Control Act of Califor
nia. Under that machinery, The Daily has no
power to act.
But the opportunity has been given. The Daily
will henceforth focus its attention upon the cam
pus, its actions and reactions. At the same time,
within the legal and moral field which The Daily
circumscribes, support will be given to any
actions of state authorities.
Already commendable action has been taken
by officials in the San Mateo district when they
met yesterday to consider ways and means of
more strict enforcement within their territory.
Whatever methods they may adopt, methods
prescribed by law, The Daily will sanction if
they are sincere attempts to fulfill the duties
of their offices.
More direct action should follow this meet
ing, and will be praised in the degree of sin

cerity with which their program is pursued.
The Daily has reached the limit of its moral
and legal opportunities to act outside Stanford's
grounds. It is up to state and county officials
to take up the legal lance which this paper must
lay down.
