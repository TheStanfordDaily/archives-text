# BULL SESSION
## CHEQUE AND RUBBER CHEQUE 
### JOHN COBBS 
\V7HEN yesterday's Daily informed me that 10 Stan
ford professors had condemned the "$3O Every
Thursday" Plan, my radiant dreams of Utopia On
Credit were a bit shaken. Alter all, it is usually safe
to assume that men who have spent their lives study
ing a subject are likely to know something about it.
And then I realized that it is short-sighted assaults
like this that menace the Cause. One of the funda
mental points of the Ham-and-Eggs philosophy is that
experts know nothing at all about their subjects. This
great principle is secondary in importance only to the
tenet which holds that bankers and financiers cannot
possibly know anything about money and credit.
We who are true apostles of the Cause must have
faith. We must shield ourselves against the attacks of
logic. The "$3O Every Thursday Plan" is pure economic
mysticism. And whoever heard of a logical mystic?
* <« Ji« #
As a matter of fact, the Program is a divine gift
for Stanford, and with a little gentle handling could
become the New Testament for Founding Grant.
Like the state, Stanford is not a profit-making in
stitution. Therefore, there is no reason why we too
should not issue $30 coupons on Thursday. These
could be used to pay all debts owed to the University,
being acceptable in the Union, 8.A.C., and cashier's
office.
On the face of it, this scheme sounds a little un
inspiring. But its economic repercussions would spread
like a questionable story.

In the first place, it is quite obvious that a divine
mandate is packed away somewhere in the $30 Plan.
For a ten-week quarter the pensions would amount
to $300 per student, which is almost exactly what it
costs us to snuggle here on the bosom of dear Alma
Mater. None but an obvious atheist or a Cal student
could doubt the sacred origin of such a sign.
And then, if the University would issue us coupons
acceptable for expenses, we would be able to hand
pick the student body. There would be no more cases
of good halfbacks going to Cal because they couldn't
afford Stanford.
* * * *
jyjOREOVER. to provide a use for its coupons, the
University would have to expand. It would install
complete restaurants and stores, would provide all the
necessities of life, and might even dabble in the amuse
ment field. This would make the University Play a
Greater Part in the Life of the Student. It would bind
faculty and students closer together, and would leave
an enduring Stanford trade-mark on our souls.
But the most beautiful part of the Program is the
effect it would have on academic work. The students
would be entirely too busy spending their $30 every
week to pay any attention to studies. Therefore they
would all fail, and, as is well established by prece
dent, would not graduate. And so instead of being
kicked out into a world that rates the college grad
uate just above the fiat worms and just below the
vertebrates, we would remain in the arms of our intel
lectual stepmother until we were old enough to qualify
for the state pension. Truly, Utopia peeps over the
hill.

This, of course, is only a skeleton-in-the-closet out
line of the whole Plan. But the main point stands out
clear. Everything can be done with Credit. This is the
first and great commandment of the Cause, and who are
we to doubt it.
Our reactionary professors had better watch their
step, or we will cough in their classes and frown at
their jokes.
Heil Credit.
