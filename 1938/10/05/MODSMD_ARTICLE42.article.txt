# Lightly... And Politely

### DOUC JAQUES 
I" A BURST of early quarter enthusiasm, Dr.
Thompson made his Political Panaceas class quite
interesting, I hear. He told his students a few stories,
and those stories are probably the things which will
be remembered longest out of all the stufT he will
give in his lectures. Dr. Thompson and his students
both probably realize this.
There was the time, he told his class, when he
noticed a young and beautiful blond in his class on
the first day of the quarter. Sparked up by this, shall
we say, vision in the front row, Dr. Thompson lectured
enthusiastically and quite clearly, he thought, on po
litical parties for three days.
At the end of the third lecture, the blonde came up
to him, blinked her beautiful blue eyes and asked,
"Is this a course in conversational French?"
* + * *
Then Dr. Thompson told the class about the final
they are going to have sooner or later. I rather think
his remarks were a little old, but they are worth re
peating: "This is going to be some final. There will be
150 questions. You and God and I can answer the
first 50, God and I can answer the next fifty, but only
I can answer the last fifty."
Because the course is given in the new Cubberley
Education Building, Dr. Thompson thinks this final
should have an appropriately high-sounding name. He
calls it the Thompson Comprehensive Rip-Snorter.

experience I know that both Encina and my
fraternity house are built on ant piles, but one
fraternity here is built on a gopher mound. This
quarter the gophers have been busily burrowing in
and out of the lawn and raising any number of little
mounds of dirt around the place.
This fraternity has also been having plumbing diffi
culties. The other day they called the plumber and he
came and did even more to the lawn and raised even
higher mounds.
One of the brolhers came home about dinner time
on the day the plumber had been there. He saw the
lawn and all that dirt. He stopped and looked at it
for a minute and then said, very dejectedly, "Oh, damn
those gophers."

This happened to a friend of mine and I don't
know, it sounds pretty silly. Early one morning he
and his room-mate left their Toyon room to take a
shower. When they got into the shower the room
mate said, "Did you lock the door?"
"No." said my friend, "I didn't think you would
have the kev."
If you had locked the door, you would have had
the key, the room-mate said, looking my friend
straight in the eye.

All this business about choosing which group has
the highest scholastic average reminds me of a friend
of mine who has a friend who had to go straight D
last spring quarter to graduate. He didn't make it.

Then Dr. Thompson told the class about the final
they are going to have sooner or later. I rather think
his remarks were a little old, but they are worth re
peating: "This is going to be some final. There will be
150 questions. You and God and I can answer the
first 50, God and I can answer the next fifty, but only
I can answer the last fifty."
Because the course is given in the new Cubberley
Education Building, Dr. Thompson thinks this final
should have an appropriately high-sounding name. He
calls it the Thompson Comprehensive Rip-Snorter.

experience I know that both Encina and my
fraternity house are built on ant piles, but one
fraternity here is built on a gopher mound. This
quarter the gophers have been busily burrowing in
and out of the lawn and raising any number of little
mounds of dirt around the place.
This fraternity has also been having plumbing diffi
culties. The other day they called the plumber and he
came and did even more to the lawn and raised even
higher mounds.
One of the brolhers came home about dinner time
on the day the plumber had been there. He saw the
lawn and all that dirt. He stopped and looked at it
for a minute and then said, very dejectedly, "Oh, damn
those gophers."

This happened to a friend of mine and I don't
know, it sounds pretty silly. Early one morning he
and his room-mate left their Toyon room to take a
shower. When they got into the shower the room
mate said, "Did you lock the door?"
"No." said my friend, "I didn't think you would
have the kev."
If you had locked the door, you would have had
the key, the room-mate said, looking my friend
straight in the eye.

All this business about choosing which group has
the highest scholastic average reminds me of a friend
of mine who has a friend who had to go straight D
last spring quarter to graduate. He didn't make it.
I" A BURST of early quarter enthusiasm, Dr.
Thompson made his Political Panaceas class quite
interesting, I hear. He told his students a few stories,
and those stories are probably the things which will
be remembered longest out of all the stufT he will
give in his lectures. Dr. Thompson and his students
both probably realize this.
There was the time, he told his class, when he
noticed a young and beautiful blond in his class on
the first day of the quarter. Sparked up by this, shall
we say, vision in the front row, Dr. Thompson lectured
enthusiastically and quite clearly, he thought, on po
litical parties for three days.
At the end of the third lecture, the blonde came up
to him, blinked her beautiful blue eyes and asked,
"Is this a course in conversational French?"
