# Life of Deaf Genius Makes Inspiring Film
## 
### 
"THE LIFE AM) LOVES OF
BEETHOVEN," current!) running
in the Cily at the Clay international
Theater, San Francisco's outhouse
of culture and foreign films, is one
of those films that deiies reviewing,
it's so good. For me to merely say
it defies reviewing, though, is about
as revealing as the traditional Eng
lish theme written at 4 a.m. telling
of the inability to write an English
theme.
I might cloak myself in generalities
and say that BEETHOVEN is a film

classic, or I might
>et technically
specific and say
the cutting in the
old mill scene was
skilfully paced.
But that doesn't
express this pic
ture's mood. The
life of a great man
has been captur
ed and you can't

explain it anymore than you can ex
plain what: prompted him to write
the music he wrote. Beethoven was
an artist and a genius, but above all
he was a human being capable of
suffering. And suffer he did. The
anguish of a thwarted love, the
loneliness of total deafness are all
set against Beethoven's immortal
music. Excerpts from his mighty
Fifth come thundering da-da-de-da
at strategic intervals.
In one line Ludwig von Beethoven
mentioned something and then add
ed, "If life is not to consume me."
It's then you sense the maddening
creative urge within the genius,
screaming to be released and ex
pressed. Sitting in the theater,
watching Beethoven's life, hearing
his music you feel the power of his
work as though it were being made
up before your eyes.
Maybe that sounds a little more
like a seance than a movie, but it's
true.
Besides numerous shots of old

Beethoven clutching his shaggy,
massive head between two big fists
and wagging it around like a rag
doll's, hands tearing over the piano,
beautiful pastoral countryside, and
some tricky sound effects showing a
man going deaf, there is one par
ticularly memorable scene.
Beethoven is seated at his piano.
His prize music pupil, quite a charm
ing one whom he is that way about,
says, "Improvise, Ludwig, I want to
tell you something." Ludwig impro
vises like a thing possessed while
she tells him of her coming marriage
with the handsome Count-of-some
thing-or-other. Ludwig improvises
even more, even better than B.
| Goodman. The little pupil leaves
, Beethoven a mighty broken man
with the question, "That piece
I you're playing now, what is it?"
j Beethoven looks up from the piano,
i pauses, and then says, "The Moon
! light Sonata," and you almost pass
I out. —Zelver

creative urge within the genius,
screaming to be released and ex
pressed. Sitting in the theater,
watching Beethoven's life, hearing
his music you feel the power of his
work as though it were being made
up before your eyes.
Maybe that sounds a little more
like a seance than a movie, but it's
true.
Besides numerous shots of old

Beethoven clutching his shaggy,
massive head between two big fists
and wagging it around like a rag
doll's, hands tearing over the piano,
beautiful pastoral countryside, and
some tricky sound effects showing a
man going deaf, there is one par
ticularly memorable scene.

"THE LIFE AM) LOVES OF
BEETHOVEN," current!) running
in the Cily at the Clay international
Theater, San Francisco's outhouse
of culture and foreign films, is one
of those films that deiies reviewing,
it's so good. For me to merely say
it defies reviewing, though, is about
as revealing as the traditional Eng
lish theme written at 4 a.m. telling
of the inability to write an English
theme.
I might cloak myself in generalities
and say that BEETHOVEN is a film

classic, or I might
>et technically
specific and say
the cutting in the
old mill scene was
skilfully paced.
But that doesn't
express this pic
ture's mood. The
life of a great man
has been captur
ed and you can't

explain it anymore than you can ex
plain what: prompted him to write
the music he wrote. Beethoven was
an artist and a genius, but above all
he was a human being capable of
suffering. And suffer he did. The
anguish of a thwarted love, the
loneliness of total deafness are all
set against Beethoven's immortal
music. Excerpts from his mighty
Fifth come thundering da-da-de-da
at strategic intervals.
In one line Ludwig von Beethoven
mentioned something and then add
ed, "If life is not to consume me."
It's then you sense the maddening
creative urge within the genius,
screaming to be released and ex
pressed. Sitting in the theater,
watching Beethoven's life, hearing
his music you feel the power of his
work as though it were being made
up before your eyes.
