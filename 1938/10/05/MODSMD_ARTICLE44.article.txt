# CAMPUS OPINION
## ONE IN FAVOR 
### 
I The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday The Daily's opposition
presented their case in two very
; puerile and pointless opinions. Per
haps the campus would like to know
j and consider the other side of the
case. The Daily has printed the his
tory of the liquor rules and the rea
! son for their existence. After years
| of flagrant violation, a Daily editor
j has finally had nerve and guts
j enough to flash in the face of the
i campus the truth that we all know
I and recognize. If we have dirty
| linen why not let it be known, and
i challenge those who are soiling our
! name to either refrain from doing so
jor get off the campus! Of course
j you are mad (I speak to those who
! are yelling loudest), because the
i Daily has thrown a challenge to
I those under 21 to live within the
law, and has reminded the older
! students that they must conduct
themselves in accordance with the
1 rules and regulations of Stanford.
Thus the issue resolves itself to
j two points: first, if those who are
1 over 21 must drink, they must con
! duct themselves in accord with the

I Fundamental Standard of Stanford
conduct. But those are few, who
flagrantly violate the concept of "be
coming conduct." The second point
is that upon which debate hinges.
A minor who purchases a drink is
breaking a law. As an educational
institution Stanford is committed to
teach good citizenship and respect
for law. Even the brewers and dis
tillers themselves recognize the fact
that selling liquor to minors is a
distasteful practice. Stanford has
an obligation to its students, its tra
ditions, its reputation and to the par
ents of its students, especially those
of the freshmen, to provide a healthy
community for those who live here.
Stanford has no room for law
breakers, and will not tolerate them
in the communities surrounding the
campus. â€”'40
