# Wilbur Scores Group Medicine
## Faculty Heads Seek To Clarify Subject 
### 
Society is going to have to realize
that health belongs to the individual
and not to the medical profession.
This was the opinion expressed
yesterday by President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Dr. Thomas A. Storey
of the 8.A.C., in commenting upon
the two hospitalization plans now
being offered to members of the
Stanford faculty.
Although neither felt that the time
was pertinent for specific comments
upon either the Palo Alto Hospi
talization Group or the Insurance
Association of Approved Hospitals,
both were willing to discuss the
trend toward so-called "socialized"
medicine, of which health insurance
is an introductory phase.

SUGGESTS CLARITY

Dr. Wilbur in particular suggested
the need for a clarification of terms,
pointing out that many functions
included under the broad term "so
calized medicine" are already han
dled by public health authorities.
"You must first decide what you
mean by "state medicine," or "so
cialized medicine," he said. "Do you
mean health control by local authori
ties, or state authorities, or federal
authorities? Do you mean control of
communicable diseases, or social
diseases, or common colds? People
seem to think that using the term
'socialized medicine' solves the
whole problem. It's scarcely as
simple as that."

CONTROL INADVISABLE

Dr. Storey also emphasized this,
pointing out that a number of basic
health problems are already regu
later by public health authorities.
Such things as communicable diseas
es, health care ol indigents, epidem
ics, purification of water supplies,
and adequate standards for food
handlers are already handled by
local, state, or federal authorities,
thereby removing the necessity for
further control.
Dr. Storey also felt that health in
surance would get nowhere until it
provided three things: adequate
provision for hospitalization, ade
quate provision for medical care, and
some means of guaranteeing income
during illness. Although this would
seem to indicate a centralized con
trol of some sort, neither he nor Dr.
Wilbur felt that it should be under
taken by the federal government.

PLANNING VITAL

"Health insurance is nothing which
can be slapped onto the books over
night, and then expected to work,"
Dr. Wilbur said. "It is a problem
which needs long study and must
be worked out gradually. If we're
simply going to pass an appropria
tion of 800 million, set up a board,
and then think that because we've
done that much we've done every
thing, we're going to find we're
sadly mistaken. Not only will we be
doing a dangerously inefficient job,
we'll also be making public health
a political football."
In conclusion, both Dr. Wilbur
and Dr. Storey reiterated their be
lief that increasing control of public
health is virtually inevitable. Both
were of the opinion that it is only a
matter of working out the problem
in the most efficient way.
