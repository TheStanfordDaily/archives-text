# Mears Asserts Hitler 'European Overlord'
## 
### 
"Ilitlcr is now the overlord of Europe," asserted I)r. Eliot G. Mears, pro
fessor of geography and international trade in the Graduate School of
Business, who discussed "Europe's Changing Political Geography" last
night in Memorial Hall Auditorium as the first speaker in the Tuesday
Lecture Series for the autumn quarter.
"The powerful German propaganda machine, and not Nazi troops, is

►being used to extend Germany's in
! fluence in central Europe," contin
! ued Dr. Mears, who has recently re
! turned to the University following a
I sabbatical year spent in travel,
principally on the European conti-
J nent.
Declining to say what the German
! chancellor will do next, since "the
'only man who knows is Hitler him
self," the speaker intimated that the
Nazi dictator may attempt to extend
Germany's territory and influence to
the East through Central Europe.

HITLER MAY EXPAND

"Hitler may follow up his con
quest of Sudetenland with further
demands," declared Dr. Mears.
"Marching eastward, he may seek to
move down the valley of the Danube
to the Black Sea, particularly now
that the two obstacles of Austria and
Czechoslovakia have been removed,
thus clearing the road to eastern
Europe."
Dr. Mears emphasized the import
ance of the German Reichsfuehrer in
Europe's political picture, explain
| ing that "Germany has the most
j strategic position of any country in
! Europe, due to its geographical lo
cation, and it is surprising that it
j has been ovei'looked for so long."

MAGINOT LINE SCORED

Criticisms of French fortifications,
which have been built against the
possibility of a Nazi invasion, were
made by the speaker, who declared
that French army officers and Par
liament officials had informed him
that France's famed Maginot line
"would not last more than a week
or ten days at the most against a
j German attack."
"European civilization today is
almost a madhouse," asserted Dr.
i Mears, who predicts that "the great
drama of Europe will probably cen
i ter in the Mediterranean in the next
i few years," since this body of water
jis "even more important to Great
Britain and France today than it
! was in 1914."

Business, who discussed "Europe's Changing Political Geography" last
night in Memorial Hall Auditorium as the first speaker in the Tuesday
Lecture Series for the autumn quarter.
"The powerful German propaganda machine, and not Nazi troops, is

►being used to extend Germany's in
! fluence in central Europe," contin
! ued Dr. Mears, who has recently re
! turned to the University following a
I sabbatical year spent in travel,
principally on the European conti-
J nent.
Declining to say what the German
! chancellor will do next, since "the
'only man who knows is Hitler him
self," the speaker intimated that the
Nazi dictator may attempt to extend
Germany's territory and influence to
the East through Central Europe.

HITLER MAY EXPAND

"Hitler may follow up his con
quest of Sudetenland with further
demands," declared Dr. Mears.
"Marching eastward, he may seek to
move down the valley of the Danube
to the Black Sea, particularly now
that the two obstacles of Austria and
Czechoslovakia have been removed,
thus clearing the road to eastern
Europe."
Dr. Mears emphasized the import
ance of the German Reichsfuehrer in
Europe's political picture, explain
| ing that "Germany has the most
j strategic position of any country in
! Europe, due to its geographical lo
cation, and it is surprising that it
j has been ovei'looked for so long."

MAGINOT LINE SCORED

Criticisms of French fortifications,
which have been built against the
possibility of a Nazi invasion, were
made by the speaker, who declared
that French army officers and Par
liament officials had informed him
that France's famed Maginot line
"would not last more than a week
or ten days at the most against a
j German attack."
"European civilization today is
almost a madhouse," asserted Dr.
i Mears, who predicts that "the great
drama of Europe will probably cen
i ter in the Mediterranean in the next
i few years," since this body of water
jis "even more important to Great
Britain and France today than it
! was in 1914."
