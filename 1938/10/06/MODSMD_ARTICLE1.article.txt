# Benes Quits; Syrovy Calls New Cabinet
## New Czech Head Seeks Friendship With Nazi Dictator 
### 
PRAGUE, Thursday, Oct. C (UP).
—The new government of Premier
General Jan Syrovy met at midnight
to study "far-reaching proposals"
rushed here from Berlin to bi'ing
Czechoslovakia into collaboration
with the Rome-Berlin axis follow
ing the resignation of President
Eduard Benes.
The abrupt about-face of the gov
ernment under Syrovy—he is now
president as well as premier and
war minister—came swiftly, turning
the dismembered nation away from
its ties with France, Britain and
Russia and toward friendship with
the dictators.
CZECHS SEEK FRIENDSHIP
Within 24 hours, Czechoslovakia
set out to become a friend of Hitler
to whom the republic finally sur
rendered her Sudeten border lands
to escape annihilation by the Ger
man armies.
General Husarek, Minister of Pub
lic Works in the new cabinet,
reached Prague from Berlin late last
night bearing the "far - reaching"
German proposals and the cabinet
w.is summoned into session imme
diately.
A complete shakeup of the na
tion's political, military and eco
nomic structure was foreshadowed
to bring Czechoslovakia into the
Italo-German orbit after 20 years of
alliance with the democracies.
NATIONS FAILED CZECHS'
The government took the view
Britain, France, and Russia failed
Czechoslovakia in her hour of need
and might has prevailed, leaving the
Czechs no alternative but to join the
side of might.
There were reports, as a result of
Benes' resignation, the plebiscites
scheduled for the "fifth zone" of the
territory demanded by Hitler might
be indefinitely postponed, perhaps
ultimately giving the areas to Ger
many without a popular vote among
the inhabitants.
