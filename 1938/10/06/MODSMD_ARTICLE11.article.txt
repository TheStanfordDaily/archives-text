# Row to Open Rushing Tomorrow
## 
### 
Trying out a new plan proposed
by last year's Interfraternity Coun
cil, the Row will open its 1938 rush
ing season at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
night with a general "open house"
to welcome Encinamen.
Aided by The Daily's map, first
year men, to whom more than 3000
cards have been mailed in the last
week, will invade the wilds of
Lasucn and Salvatierra from 7:30 to
12 o'clock on both tomorrow and
Saturday nights.
Strictly informal, the open house
periods on these two nights will be
held to give freshmen a chance to
orient themselves on the Row, and
also to give them an opportunity to
sec as many of the houses as they
wish. No meals will be served, and
rushces are requested to remain no
longer than one hour in each house
they visit.
The "open house" period, a distinct
innovation in Farm rushing, was
adopted by Interfraternity Council
last year after an intensive study
of rushing systems at olher Coast
universities. By concentrating ini
tial rushing into two closely-inte
grated periods, freshmen are as
sured an early familiarity with the
Row and the various houses.
Although no disciplinary action
can be taken against houses which
retain rushees longer than the legal
one hour, Interfraternity Board of
Control asks both rushees and
houses to see that the rules ai'e not
broken.
