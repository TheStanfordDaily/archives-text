# Dr. Twitty Switches Salamander's Stripes
## 
### 
With a new operation developed by Dr. Victor C. Twitty, professor
of biology, salamanders have been made to change their stripes—a feat
comparable with causing a leopard to change his spots.
Color pigment is taken from one animal and given to another in the
scientific operation developed by Dr. Twitty. Pigment, it is found, has a

►certain degree of independence from
the skin it marks.
The operation is done when the
salamander is still an almost form
less, embryonic bit of protoplasm,
still colorless, although beginning to
show divisions.
Out of one of these divisions,
called the neural tube because it?
will later become the animal's brain
and nervous system, Dr. Twitty
takes a tiny drop of protoplasm.
The colorless drop picked up is the
stuff that later becomcs the sala
mander's black skin pigment.
If left alone the pigment migrates
from the nerve center, and, as if un
der prearranged orders, forms a pat
tern on the salamander's skin. This
pattern is either a long black stripe
along each side or a darkening of
the entire body, like the pigment
which overspreads the human skin
in tanning.
PIG M ENT TRA NSFEItRED
When the operation transfers this
future pigment protoplasm to an
other salamander, the coloring mat
ter continues to make the same
pattern. This happens even when
the pigment is transferred to an
other species of salamander, whose
natural color pattern is different.
The "stripe" pigment will make a
stripe on an unstriped salamander.
The "unstriped" pigment will spread
all over the body of a striped sala
mander so that his stripe disap
pears.
HOLDS PATTERN
Dr. Twitty has proved that it is
the pigment and not the animal
which possesses the power over the
pattern, by artificial insemination to
cross-breed striped and dark sala
manders.
The result is a new kind of pig
ment which possesses the ability to
make both color patterns. These
hybrid salamanders have both
stripes and partly darkened bodies
—which is naturally to be expected.
But the surprising step is that when
this hybrid pigment is transferred by
operation back to a normally col
ored salamander, it gives him the
new hybrid coloring. This proves,
states Dr. Twitty, that the pigment
itself contains something which
governs where it shall spread in the
skin.

PIG M ENT TRA NSFEItRED
When the operation transfers this
future pigment protoplasm to an
other salamander, the coloring mat
ter continues to make the same
pattern. This happens even when
the pigment is transferred to an
other species of salamander, whose
natural color pattern is different.
The "stripe" pigment will make a
stripe on an unstriped salamander.
The "unstriped" pigment will spread
all over the body of a striped sala
mander so that his stripe disap
pears.
HOLDS PATTERN
Dr. Twitty has proved that it is
the pigment and not the animal
which possesses the power over the
pattern, by artificial insemination to
cross-breed striped and dark sala
manders.
The result is a new kind of pig
ment which possesses the ability to
make both color patterns. These
hybrid salamanders have both
stripes and partly darkened bodies
—which is naturally to be expected.
But the surprising step is that when
this hybrid pigment is transferred by
operation back to a normally col
ored salamander, it gives him the
new hybrid coloring. This proves,
states Dr. Twitty, that the pigment
itself contains something which
governs where it shall spread in the
skin.
With a new operation developed by Dr. Victor C. Twitty, professor
of biology, salamanders have been made to change their stripes—a feat
comparable with causing a leopard to change his spots.
Color pigment is taken from one animal and given to another in the
scientific operation developed by Dr. Twitty. Pigment, it is found, has a

►certain degree of independence from
the skin it marks.
The operation is done when the
salamander is still an almost form
less, embryonic bit of protoplasm,
still colorless, although beginning to
show divisions.
Out of one of these divisions,
called the neural tube because it?
will later become the animal's brain
and nervous system, Dr. Twitty
takes a tiny drop of protoplasm.
The colorless drop picked up is the
stuff that later becomcs the sala
mander's black skin pigment.
If left alone the pigment migrates
from the nerve center, and, as if un
der prearranged orders, forms a pat
tern on the salamander's skin. This
pattern is either a long black stripe
along each side or a darkening of
the entire body, like the pigment
which overspreads the human skin
in tanning.
