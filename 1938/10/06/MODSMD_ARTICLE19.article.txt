# New Cardinal Campaign Set
## 
### 
Starting out "right off the bat," as
President Roy Thompson put it,
Cardinals appointed committees,
planned campaigns, and elected
Mary Kay Horton secretary in their
first fall quarter meeting last night.
Permanent committees appointed
were: Dance Committee, Bill Haw
kins, chairman, Ken Cuthbertson,
and Rovena Conn; Welcoming Com
mittee, Clint Olsen, chairman, Woo
die Miller, and Mary Kay Horton.
A third committee, new after an
absence of several years, will be the
High School Program Committee,
chairmanned by Mary Morris Boggs.
Assisting her will be Andy Stojko
vich and Dick Frank.
With decisions postponed until fu
ture meetings, discussions were held
on:
The Red Cross Drive: Pointing
out on the one hand that Stanford
is overrun with drives and on the
other hand that the Red Cross Drive
is for a "truly worthy cause," Car
dinals postponed final acceptance or
rejection of such a drive, suggested
that old clothes as well as money
be accepted this year. Rovena Conn
and Woodie Miller were appointed
to investigate.
Showings of football game pic
tures: It was suggested that show
ings will be held, but possibly only
of ofY-campus and controversial
games.
Convalescent Home Drive will
definitely be changed this year, Roy
Thompson told Cardinals.
Meetings will be held on Wednes
days at 7:15 o'clock.
