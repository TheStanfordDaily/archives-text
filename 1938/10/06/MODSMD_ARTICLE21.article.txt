# Liquor Campaign Praised By Bunn
## Luncheon Club Hears Dean of Men Discuss Student Drinking Issue 
### 
Dean of Men John Bunn unequivocally approved the "courageous
stand which the members of The Daily stafT have taken on the problem
of drinking" in his speech before the first meeting of the Stanford Luncheon
Club yesterday noon in the Nitery.
Clarifying the Administration's viewpoint, Mr. Bunn first traced the
history of the drinking problem on the Stanford campus through the

-three cycles of 1908, 1927, and 1938.
As to The Daily's campaign, the
staff has done, he said, "two things
important and impressive.
"They have called to our atten
tion a thing which we need to rec
ognize.
"They have followed the idea of
the teacher ... by trying to pre
vent . . . Preventative methods
are worth much more than curative
methods."
Mr. Bunn saw "four phases" into
which the problem may be divided.
These are the physiological, socio
logical, moral, and legal aspects.
In his discussion of the first sec
tion, he opened with a direct quote
from David Starr Jordan, former
University president.
MOB PSYCHOLOGY
"Students get the feeling that this
is the thing to do. If people who are
interested in this sort of thing are
the leaders, and dominate the group,
then that group follows," Mr. Bunn
said in regard to the sociological
view.
"With respect to the liquor ques
tion, this fact holdsâ€”throughout the
ages, even the liquor interests have
remained steadfast in saying 'liquor
must not be sold to minors'."
In regard to the moral aspect, he
said, "Throughout time the moral
leaders have been those who have
been against prevailing general cus
tom. This, The Daily has done.
DISCUSSION VALUABLE
"Furor is healthy. When it pro
duces discussion, we can reach a
sound conclusion.
"We are usually too hasty to ac
cept the thing that is being done,
and excuse our actions on the
ground that everybody else is doing
it. Things which we should accept
are those which have stood the test
of time."
As to the legal matter involved,
the Dean said, "I was under the as
sumption that a person holding a
job as a law-enforcement officer
should get the information. There
fore, I have no brief for any officer
who says, 'You bring the informa
tion, and I'll be glad to act.'."
Concluding, he said, "State and
Stafford laws on this question
should be repeated each year for the
benefit of our ever-changing popu
lation. I'm glad we don't have a lot
of rules hqre. On the other hand, I
think we need interpretation from
time to time."
