# Churchill Lashes Policy Of Submission
## 'Friendship with Nazi Regime Impossible,' Says British Leader 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 5 (UP).—Winston
Churchill, veteran of many of Brit
ain's stormiest political battles, to
day warned the British Empire the
only way it can avoid falling before
the onrush of Fuehrer Adolf Hitler's
"power politics" is to build the
mightiest air fleet in the world.
For a solid hour the leader of the
opposition Conservatives stood on
the floor of Commons and gave the
government of Prime Minister Ne
ville Chamberlain one of the worst
tongue lashings it has ever received.
Churchill concluded his denuncia
tion of the "Peace of Munich" with
this ominous prophecy:
"Never will we have friendship
between the British democracy and
Nazi power."
He said all of Central Europe
would be drawn into (he vortex of
"power politics which radiates from
Berlin," and he foresaw "a policy of
submission" by Britain.
Shaking his finger at the rows of
government benches, Churchill
thundered:
"The one method of protecting
ourselves against Nazi power is to
regain our old island independence
by securing supremacy in the air."
Churchill's distrust of dictators
was never more apparent. Describ
ing Chamberlain's "submission" to
Hitler as an "unmitigated defeat,"
he said: "Hitler demanded one
pound sterling at a pistol point.
When that was given, he demanded
two pounds, and finally settled for
one pound, 17 J a shillings."
Churchill opened fire on the gov
ernment after Sir John Simon,
Chancellor of the Exchequer and a
member of Chamberlain's "Inner
Cabinet," moved a vote of confidence
in the government.
