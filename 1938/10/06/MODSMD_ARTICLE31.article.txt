# Hi-Rivals to Meet In Frosh Contest
## 
### 
An interesting sidelight to Satur
day's game between Stanford's Pap
ooses and the U.S.C. Trobabes, which
will be a preliminary to the Stanford
varsity vs. Washington State contest,
is the fact that the two ball-toting
aces ol the rival teams will be re
suming a rivalry which began in
high school.
This rivalry dates back to last year
when Frankie Albert. Papoose full
back, was starring for Glendale High
and Max Gieen, ace of this year's
Trobabe backfield, was pile-driving
for Hoover High of Glendale. Green
scored both S.C. touchdowns last
week when the Trojan frosh defeat
ed Glendale Junior College, 13-6,
