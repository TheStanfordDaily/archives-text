## Injured Indians Face Crippled Cougar Squad 
### JOHN SHALEENBERGER, Sports Editor 
While reports are trickling down from Pullman that the Washington
State football squad is sadly depleted with injuries, the Cougars would
have to be in pretty bad shape to match Tiny Thoriihill's Indians'
troubles.
Norm Standiee was still in the hospital last night with little prospect
of his being in shape for the Saturday game. Guard Dick Sutton has

been on crutches ever since the
Santa Clara debacle, and Jack
Clark has a foot injury that kept
him out of the secret practice last
night.
KNEE INJURIES
What's more, Hamp Pool, the
guard-halfback, scrimmaged with a
weak knee, while Tony Calvelli still
has pads on the knee injury which
[ forced him out of the Bronc tilt.
Pool got his first taste of line duty
last night and was performing like
a veteran under the lights. He
t charges fast and often and his of
| fensive speed makes him a natural
for leading plays.
After a session of line scrimmage,
Thornhill sent his first stringers in
against a Grey eleven huriredly
coached in Washington State plays.
The tricky Cougar double shift had
the linemen offside a good deal of
the time until they settled down to
j concentrate on the ball.
OREGON STAR HURT
Up north, Babe Hollingberry has
| been busy hunting a capable re
i placement for his stellar triple
threat halfback, Eddie Bayne.
! Bayne is reputedly out of the Stan
i ford game with a shoulder injury.
Hollingbery and 31 members ol
the traveling squad left the Palouse
. country last night, to seek their first
, win after two defeats in a row. Ore
! gon State beat the Cougars two
weeks ago 10-2, and California
waxed them 27-0 last week-end.
