# Water Dogs Will Battle Athens Club
## 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton's water polo
I team takes on the Athens Club of
Oakland in the opening contest of
the season tonight at 8 o'clock in the
| Athens pool.
Thornton changed his forward
wall yesterday by removing Jack
Loupe for Dave Nottage, who will
team with Captain Johnnie Lamb.
With the exception of Nottage and
Goalie Roy Vitousek, the opening
line-up will probably be an all
veteran team.
Harvey Rothschild and Bob Plate
j will hold down the all-important
I positions of center forward and cen
ter back, respectively. The effective
ness of Thornton's new quick-break
system will lie largely with this
pair.
Dick Hoover will take care of one
guard spot and either Ted Moreno
or Bill Hatch will handle the oilier.
With the prospect of facing six
members of California's "wonder
team" of last year, who are now
playing for the Athens Club, Thorn
ton could not be optimistic over the
I final outcome of the encounter.
