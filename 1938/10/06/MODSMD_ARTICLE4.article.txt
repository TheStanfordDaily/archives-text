# Barn Dances Rated Hazard
## Comptroller Asks Campus Co-operation 
### 
Because "little cubby holes and
nooks" create too much of a fire
hazard at barn dances, acting
Comptroller J. Hugh Jackson yes
terday sent a letter to all living
groups and dormitories requesting
that one of Stanford's oldest tradi
tions be abandoned by the campus.
Attrition of the comptroller's of
fice was called to the problem last
spring quarter when sevei-al organi
zations gave dances in which hay
was a prominent feature.
In one case, "piles of bales three
or four bales high with only narrow
passages in a maze fashion . . . re
sulted in unusual danger."
"It is obvious," the letter stated,
"that conditions of this sort consti
tute a major fire hazard which
might not only result disastrously so
far as property is concerned, but
also in great loss of life. If a fire
should start and a panic be created,
with the exits blocked, a tragedy
such as anyone connected with the
University shudders even to think
about might easily take place.
"Accordingly, with the approval
of the President of the University,
this office has requested Chief Du
gan of the campus fire department
to prevent such conditions in the fu
ture; so far as university-owned
buildings are concerned, no dances
of this kind shall be held in the
future.
"It is earnestly hoped, moreover,
that everyone connected with hous
ing facilities on the campus will
realize the extreme danger resulting
from such conditions and will
wholeheartedly co-operate with the
University in eliminating them."
