# Collie Earns Fame As Team Follower

### 
Today's candidate for a Block "S"
in football is Prince Pool, the 14-
year-old collie dog of Hainp Pool.
Prince went through every session
of spring training without injury
and came back this fall to follow his
master around for another season.
He got into his first game last Sat
urday when Pool forgot to tie him
down before the Santa Clara tilt.
But surprisingly enough, Prince
never messes up a scrimmage, pre
ferring to loiter around the side
lines and beg for candy mints until
Pool calls him. When he posed for
his picture the other day, the pho
tographer asked Prince if he would
be on the bench for the Washington
State game. The collie sat up with
a hopeful look in his aging eyes.
"Arf," he answered.

St. John Ambulance Brigade
handled 30.021 casualties in London
in 1937.
