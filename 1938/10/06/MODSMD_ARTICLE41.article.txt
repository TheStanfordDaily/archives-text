# Maloney Soccer Squad Groomed For S.F.J.C. Tilt
## Team Has Few Varsity Men; Coach Sees 'Fair Year' 
### 
With only a week of practice be-
hind them, Coach Harry Maloney
appeared optimistic yesterday as he
whipped his 60 men on the soccer
squad into shape for the game to be
played here Saturday morning at
10 o'clock with San Francisco Junior
College.
The boys from the big city are
new to the California Intercollegiate
Soccer Conference in which the
Cards play, but have played the
sport for some years and are re-
puted to have a good fast team.
NEW PLAYERS
While Coach Maloney's squad is
not too gifted with returning var
sity men, there are a large number
of experienced players out from
last year, from foreign countries,
and from last year's frosh, and he
promises "a better than average :
team."
The nucleus of the squad from
I which Saturday's team will be se
-1 lected is composed of Tevfik Sedul
lah, Bill Barkan, George Chalmers,
John DeBenedetti, Alfred Pellas,
and Howard Naquin, a new arrival
from Sweden, in the forward line.
The halfbacks will be chosen from
Ken Cuthbertson, Bill Edwards,
Dave MacKenzie, Grayson Bryan,
Wilson Clark, and Ben Tiffany.
SQUAD LISTED
Fullbacks will be bolstered up by
such men as Bill Hamilton, Ned
Pugh, John Schaupp, Dick Harman,
and Cameron Pierce. Tops among
the goal keepers are Rudy Munzer
and Philip Rosenthall. Soccer at
Stanford operates under a consider-
able early season disadvantage since
practice is so late in starting.
To speed things up Coach Maloney
has devised a new schedule for
practice with the squad divided into
two groups. One group scrimmages
Monday and Wednesdays and the
other on Tuesdays and Thursdays
with a chalk talk for the whole
squad on Friday. It is believed that
this gives the players a better work
out with more personal coaching
attention.
