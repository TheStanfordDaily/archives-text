# Maloney Soccer Squad Groomed For S.F.J.C. Tilt
## Team Has Few Varsity Men; Coach Sees 'Fair Year' 
### 
With only a week of practice be- !
hind them, Coach Harry Maloney
appeared optimistic yesterday as he ;
whipped his (50 men on the soccer j
squad into shape for the game to be I
played here Saturday morning at !
10 o'clock with San Francisco Junior !
College.
The boys from the big city are i
new to the California Intercollegiate |
Soccer Conference in which the I
Cards play, but have played the I
sport for some years and are re- j
puted to have a good fast team.
NEW PLAYERS
While Coach Maloney's squad is j
not too gifted with returning var
sity men, there are a large number
of experienced players out from
last year, from foreign countries,
and from last year's frosh, and he j
promises "a better than average :
team."
The nucleus of the squad from
I which Saturday's team will be se
-1 lected is composed of Tevfik Sedul
lah. Bill Barkan, George Chalmers, |
John Deßenedetti, Alfred Pellas, j
and Howard Naquin, a new arrival j
from Sweden, in the forward line.
: The halfbacks will be chosen from j
Ken Cuthbertson, Bill Edwards, j
Dave MacKenzie, Grayson Bryan. I
1 Wilson Clark, and Ben Tiffany.
SQUAD LISTED
Fullbacks will be bolstered up by 1
such men as Bill Hamilton, Ned !
Pugh. John Schaupp, Dick Harman, 1
and Cameron Pierce. Tops among j i
, the goal keepers are Rudy Munzer!
and Philip Rosenthal 1. Soccer at
Stanford operates under a consider- j
j able early season disadvantage since j
j practice is so late in starting.
To speed things up Coach Maloney j
! has devised a new schedule for |
' practice with the squad divided into j
two groups. One group scrimmages j
Monday and Wednesdays and the i
other on Tuesdays and Thursdays
with a chalk talk for the whole I
squad on Friday. It is believed that
this gives the players a better work
out with more personal coaching
attention.
