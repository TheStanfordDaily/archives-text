STRANGE as it may seem, moral issues are
not necessarily at stake in the current cam
paign concerning liguor.
State laws apply only to minors. Stanford's
codes deal with drunkenness and disorderly
conduct, not with the guestion of drinking off
campus. Perhaps the spirit of the resolutions
may be extended to forbid any drinking by any
Student at any place, as it does forbid any
drinking within University boundaries.
But as with all of Stanford's codes, the moral
decision on his conduct is left with the student.
Up to this time, neither the administration
nor The Daily has been able to make itself clear
on this important point. Both are concerned
with the existing laws and their enforcement,
not necessarily with the moral issues behind
those laws.
In accordance with state statutes, minors have
no choice on the guestion of drinking. But ma
ture men and women at Stanford may make
their own decision.
The Daily has merely pointed out the social
codes and the legal restrictions which may
color that decision.
Not only Stanford, but all society finds drunk
enness and disorderly conduct intolerable. Not
only Stanford, but all social groupings demand
that individuals protect the reputation of the
tvhole by their actions.
Nor has The Daily, by clarifying legal codes
or Stanford s regulations, endangered the right
for individual decision to be made. Rather has
it acted to prevent unwitting infraction of those
codes, with the attendant drastic effects.
In pointing out this individual right of deci
sion which Stanford maintains, The Daily does
not wish to be accused of turning tail on what
has already been said. At no time has The
Daily advanced upon moral grounds. Nor does
it intend to.
Following Stanford's philosophy of individual
responsibility, and its own belief in the ability
of Stanford men and women to make their own
moral codes, The Daily concerns itself only with
the illegal practice of serving to minors, and the
illegal infraction of Stanford's rules against
drinking, drunkenness, or disorderly conduct
within University bounds.
Outside such legal fields, The Daily or the
administration remains silent.
On moral grounds, Stanford must speak for
vitself.
