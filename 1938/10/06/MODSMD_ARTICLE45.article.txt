CONVENIENT for the faculty member but
not adequately qualified to fill student
needs, two hospitalization insurance plans are
being offered the campus by their respective
organizations.
From the Palo Alto Hospitalization Group and
the Insurance Association of Approved Hospi
tals have come two plans whose chief sins
would seem to be those of omission rather than
commission. Both handle problems which rarely
arise during the course of a normal school year
major accidents, major illnesses, maternity
cases. Neither takes into account the things
which constantly fill the campus health serv
ices with patients—minor colds, minor upsets,
minor misfortunes.
These are the cases which come constantly
before University authorities; they are the cases
already handled efficiently through University
channels. Needing no rigamarole for securing
treatment, and given adequate hospitalization at
greatly reduced rates, they are the immediate
health problems the student is called upon to
face; not the unlikely accident or the improbable
major illness, but the everyday, routine annoy
ances which interfere with campus living.
For faculty members and non-student resi
dents, health insurance may be a worthwhile
investment; but for the ordinary Stanford stu
dent, who pays five dollars each quarter to
assure adequate protection of student health,
it is not only too inflexible to do him very much
good; it is also morp than a little superfluous.—
