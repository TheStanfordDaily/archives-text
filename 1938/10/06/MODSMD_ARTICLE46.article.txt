# Sing Us Another One

UNNOTICED, and almost unsung, the ves
tigial remains of the Glee Club at Stanford
is struggling right now to justify its bare exist
ence. The trouble develops into a vicious circle
which chases its tail in this manner:
A. Without a full quota of qualified singers,
the Glee Club can't afford to sing often.
B. Without opportunities to sing, the Glee
Club is unable to attract good singers.
The circle has been whirling round and round
for a good many years now. This week, the
Club is fighting to break the endless chain by,
for once, getting a tenor section.
The Club has made its plans for a good year—
more outside appearances, more campus op
portunities to establish its waning reputation.
But it's stuck on the dime because of that tre
mendous baritone section with no tenors to
carry the tune.
It's a vicious circle.
The Club can sing its way out of it, providing
the bathtub tenors at Stanford add their vocal
cords to the minor melody.
Otherwise, like a vice-president, nothing may
be heard of it again.
