### JOHN COBBS 
ROW, ROW, ROW YOU DOPES
IN LAST Monday's Daily, I made noises like ap
proaching footsteps and announced with startling
penetration that fraternity rushing was almost with
us again. Since that time, my prediction has been
confirmed. The little yellow cards have rolled in,
each bearing its tidings of comfort and joy. And to
morrow the frosh dust off their ties, drag out their
most impressive jewelry, and walk self-consciously
up the Row, feeling very much as though they were
going to call on an exacting maiden aunt with money.
But since last Monday, one or two of my friends (a
columnist does not have a few of them) have sug
gested that the freshmen would like some "reasonable
advice." Philosophic contemplation, they say, is very
nice. It is the mental counterpart of twiddling the
thumbs, and will do a lot to brighten up a dull day.
But the freshmen want to know what sort of jokes
they should tell, and how they should evaluate new
furniture in comparison with old mortgages.
Unfortunately though, advice on rushing-is a sub
ject which our civilization has neglected. Crystal
gazers maintain a marked silence on the matter, and
clairvoyants hastily change the subject to horse races
or tall, dark men.
Marriages may not be made in Heaven, but rush
ing is unquestionably handled through the celestial
Head Office. In fact, I doubt if you could get even
a senior saint to touch it, without an authorization.

works out through a combination of
laissez-faire and divine intervention. The frater
nity men and the freshmen form opinions of each other
which are half impressionism and half prejudice. The
freshmen talk things over among themselves and
gradually forge a determination.
All of this is hardly the calm, decisive weighing of
the facts that should attend a major decision. But in
the end it works out the same way. A decision to
join a fraternity is a choice of living companions. It
doesn't matter whether you dislike a man because you
feel your souls out of harmony, or because you ap
praise his character and find it adulterated. You still
don't want to live with him.
Of course there are one or two rules which any
sensible frosh will keep in mind, but most of them
were platitudes before we got off our first liquid diet.
It is very touching to form a glorious friendship
with a man and try to stick by him. But it needs
careful watching. This Ruth and Naomi business of
where thou goest I go and thy gods shall be my gods
needs restraint. It's easy to miss the boat that way.
And then too it is a good idea to take a look through
Emily Post before tripping up the Row. Also, while it
doesn't hurt to let other people do a lot of the talking,
it helps to remember that one of the stickiest things
in creation is that Dale Carnegie silence that comes
when each of the two parties in a conversation waits
for the other to talk about himself.

Having fallen into this fatherly tone, I shall close
before I drift into the story of what happened when I
shook out my coat and legged it up the Row like
Childe Harold approaching the dark tower. God bless
you, my children.
