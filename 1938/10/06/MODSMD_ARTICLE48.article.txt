I AST week-end we interviewed Mr. Freddie Martin,
orchestra leader at the St. Francis Mural Room.
Over a "lemonade," poker-faced Mr. Mai'tin studied
us carefully for a moment, then said:
"I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and I attended Ohio
State University for one year, after which I left and
went to Europe with a band. I never returned to col
lege, but I've been playing in bands ever since. If
you want the story of my own band's start, why don't
you read Pierce in the Call-Bulletin—he's writing us
up this week."
"Stanford is more interested in you as a man than
as a band leader, Mr. Martin," we replied.
There was an awkward, strained silence.
We asked the first question we could think of:
"Do you like classical music, Mr. Martin?"
"Not particularly. I like semi-classical stuff—espe
cially Debussy and Strauss—hate Victor Herbert. My
favorite music, though, is Cole Porter's popular stuff,
like 'Long Last Love,' which I'll play in a few minutes
for you."
Yk/E remembered a San Francisco columnist's refer
ence to Mr. Martin's young son Freddie Martin,
Jr., and asked:
"Haven't you a son, Mr. Martin?"
Instantly a nostalgic gleam came into Martin's eye.
He said warmly, "Why yes. my wife just took plane
down to see him—he's at Black Fox Military Academy,
you know. He's only six and a half, but he swims in
the ocean and rides horseback quite well.
"We plan to settle in southern California, so he'll
probably go to Stanford or California—he doesn't show
any talent for music at all. So I'll let him decide upon
his career when he's ready."
After a bit, Mr. Martin got up to go; but he didn't
wring our hand professionally and say,
"Always glad to see the Stanford boys. Any time
they have the cover charge"; he merely said,
"Come up some time when I'm not busy and we'll
talk longer."
Mr. Martin's chief interests in life are his wife, his
son, his orchestra, and his tennis game.
Despite his long engagements in the film capital
(Ambassador), Mr. Freddie Martin is just a family
man at heart.
Perhaps that s why there's no female vocalist in
Ills orchestra.
