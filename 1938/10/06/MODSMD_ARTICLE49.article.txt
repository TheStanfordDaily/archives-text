The Editor, Sir:
May I be permitted the use of
your columns to make an important
correction in the account of the
Tuesday Evening lecture this week,
otherwise well reported.
The Maginot line, which "would
not last more than a week or ten
days against a German attack,"
clearly had reference to the Czech
so-called Maginot fortifications, not
the famous French frontier defense
which is reputed to be virtually
impregnable. As I stated in my lec
ture, my information for the quota
tion came from diplomatic and
military circles when I was at
Prague, prior to the serious border
incident of last May.

The Editor, Sir:
We would very much appreciate it
if you would send us a copy of the
October 3rd issue of The Stanford
Daily which, we understand, con
tains an article charging certain
Peninsula taverns with selling liquor
to minors.
The members of this association
felt that every effort should be ex
pended to see that the laws pertain
ing to the sale of alcoholic beverages
in this state are enforced. With the
co-operation of the public in ex
posing violations, the problem of
liquor law enforcement is much
simplified.
We are enclosing 20 cents in
stamps to cover costs.

Association

The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me to be a great pity
that there is no intelligent reviewer
upon your staff who can compre
hensively tell me what shows to see,
and what shows not to see.
A review is not meant to be a
string of invectives one after the
other, as in the Sonja Henie review,
"it stinks." That tells me nothing
about the picture. That has too per
sonal a meaning that is impossible to
transfer to the reader.
Criticism is not interpreted as
meaning a lot of exclamations
bunched together, whether good or
bad. An intelligent criticism should
consist of a critical evaluation of the
good and bad points, of the plot,
montage, characters, appeal, and
whatever personal touches the re
viewer wants to include. "This pic
ture is poor because—" is a better
start than "It smells." The period
cuts off anything that I might have
learned. I would like to know why
or why not the reviewer liked the
picture, not that he did or didn't,
because that I can find out for my
self.
It's not quite so simple a method,
but the results are far more pleasing.
George H. Grinnell

The Editor, Sir:
We have problems scientific
mathematic and refined
But our problem most terrific
is the male of the kind.
Some are handsome, tall and fair
smooth and debonair
of a species far too rare.
Wolves and droops irrelevant
are always too, too prevalent
We take them as they are,
But we don't take them too far—
If their line is not so fine
We'll take them for their car.
We love them, hate them,
even date them
Kid and tease them
Dress to please them
Then they let us down.
I'm not disilluisoned, Editor, but,
gee, I had insomnia, and what do
you do when you can't sleep?

The Editor, Sir:
We have problems scientific
mathematic and refined
But our problem most terrific
is the male of the kind.
Some are handsome, tall and fair
smooth and debonair
of a species far too rare.
Wolves and droops irrelevant
are always too, too prevalent
We take them as they are,
But we don't take them too far—
If their line is not so fine
We'll take them for their car.
We love them, hate them,
even date them
Kid and tease them
Dress to please them
Then they let us down.
I'm not disilluisoned, Editor, but,
gee, I had insomnia, and what do
you do when you can't sleep?
The Editor, Sir:
May I be permitted the use of
your columns to make an important
correction in the account of the
Tuesday Evening lecture this week,
otherwise well reported.
The Maginot line, which "would
not last more than a week or ten
days against a German attack,"
clearly had reference to the Czech
so-called Maginot fortifications, not
the famous French frontier defense
which is reputed to be virtually
impregnable. As I stated in my lec
ture, my information for the quota
tion came from diplomatic and
military circles when I was at
Prague, prior to the serious border
incident of last May.

The Editor, Sir:
We would very much appreciate it
if you would send us a copy of the
October 3rd issue of The Stanford
Daily which, we understand, con
tains an article charging certain
Peninsula taverns with selling liquor
to minors.
The members of this association
felt that every effort should be ex
pended to see that the laws pertain
ing to the sale of alcoholic beverages
in this state are enforced. With the
co-operation of the public in ex
posing violations, the problem of
liquor law enforcement is much
simplified.
We are enclosing 20 cents in
stamps to cover costs.

The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me to be a great pity
that there is no intelligent reviewer
upon your staff who can compre
hensively tell me what shows to see,
and what shows not to see.
A review is not meant to be a
string of invectives one after the
other, as in the Sonja Henie review,
"it stinks." That tells me nothing
about the picture. That has too per
sonal a meaning that is impossible to
transfer to the reader.
Criticism is not interpreted as
meaning a lot of exclamations
bunched together, whether good or
bad. An intelligent criticism should
consist of a critical evaluation of the
good and bad points, of the plot,
montage, characters, appeal, and
whatever personal touches the re
viewer wants to include. "This pic
ture is poor because—" is a better
start than "It smells." The period
cuts off anything that I might have
learned. I would like to know why
or why not the reviewer liked the
picture, not that he did or didn't,
because that I can find out for my
self.
It's not quite so simple a method,
but the results are far more pleasing.
