The Editor, Sir:
I feel it my duty to mention two
points hitherto unmentioned:
1. The unfavorable advertisement
of certain places . . . may result in
a loss of business to many campus
publications, the foremost of whiuh
is the progressive Stanford Chapar
ral, which in the past has filled many
of its pages with advertisements of
these various dens of iniquity.
2. I would also favor the full en
forcement of the law in selling cig
ax-ettes to minors. . . . The Stan
ford Union reaps a rich profit from
tobacco sales in both the Encina
Store and in the Union Cellar. . . .

The Statue of Liberty stands on a
prison, and although it is located in
New York harbor, it is not in New
York.
