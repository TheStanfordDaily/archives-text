# Hick Reporter Becomes Hero In War Novel
## 
### 
SCOOP," by Evelyn Waugh. on
sale or for rent at the Stanford
Bookstore:

Wililam Boot was a high-class
hayseed. Once a week from his
mangy manor in the sticks, William
wrote a column for a London daily
about our Friend the Yak, our Pal
the Panther, or about other small
game which haunt the English
countryside in season. Once William
slipped up. His niece filled in the
words "crested grebe" where Wil-

liam had written
about the badger.
Now, as you and I
know, the crested
grebe has little or
nothing in com
mon with the
badger.
So when William
was summoned
by his paper, he
was bloody well

stymied, you can bet, but our dumb
yokel was to be plucked from his
obscure pillar and trundled off to
Ishmaelia where war raged. The
spot had been meant for one John
Boot, wrifer of smutty novels. Only
the foreign editor was easily con
fused.
Now, William had as much natural
curiosity as a barnacle and just
about the same tendency to ramble.
But in Ishmaelia, someone not only
handed William a scoop but peeled
it for him. Lord Copper, owner of
the London paper, prodded the Prime
Minister into giving William a
knighthood, which is nice if you go
in for knick-knacks.
But Boot hung up his hat on the
moose head in his ancestral hall, re

fusing even to attend the banquet
where Lord Copper drooled bliss
fully in his honor.
"Scoop" roasted foreign corre
sponding in a timely and snappy
fashion, and a fall-guy like William
seems to be a favorite comedy dupe.
Waugh is more sober than Benchley
and slightly more rational. However,
like Benchley, he lampoons wryly
but with good humor.
The first part of the book is much

funnier than the last, in which the
political set-up in Ishmaclia proved
as fancy as a pin-ball board and
about us crooked. Frankly, I was
baffled.
—Slater

Among the strange jobs whereby
college lads today fill the gap are
digging graves (Butler U.), and
lassoing bobcats for sale to labora
tories (Texas U.).

SCOOP," by Evelyn Waugh. on
sale or for rent at the Stanford
Bookstore:

Wililam Boot was a high-class
hayseed. Once a week from his
mangy manor in the sticks, William
wrote a column for a London daily
about our Friend the Yak, our Pal
the Panther, or about other small
game which haunt the English
countryside in season. Once William
slipped up. His niece filled in the
words "crested grebe" where Wil-

liam had written
about the badger.
Now, as you and I
know, the crested
grebe has little or
nothing in com
mon with the
badger.
So when William
was summoned
by his paper, he
was bloody well

stymied, you can bet, but our dumb
yokel was to be plucked from his
obscure pillar and trundled off to
Ishmaelia where war raged. The
spot had been meant for one John
Boot, wrifer of smutty novels. Only
the foreign editor was easily con
fused.
Now, William had as much natural
curiosity as a barnacle and just
about the same tendency to ramble.
But in Ishmaelia, someone not only
handed William a scoop but peeled
it for him. Lord Copper, owner of
the London paper, prodded the Prime
Minister into giving William a
knighthood, which is nice if you go
in for knick-knacks.
But Boot hung up his hat on the
moose head in his ancestral hall, re

fusing even to attend the banquet
where Lord Copper drooled bliss
fully in his honor.
"Scoop" roasted foreign corre
sponding in a timely and snappy
fashion, and a fall-guy like William
seems to be a favorite comedy dupe.
Waugh is more sober than Benchley
and slightly more rational. However,
like Benchley, he lampoons wryly
but with good humor.
The first part of the book is much

funnier than the last, in which the
political set-up in Ishmaclia proved
as fancy as a pin-ball board and
about us crooked. Frankly, I was
baffled.
