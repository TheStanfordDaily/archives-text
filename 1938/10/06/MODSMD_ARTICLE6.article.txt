# Yanks Take Series Tilt Over Cubs
## Champs Win Opener, 3-1, as Dickey Hits Safely Four Times 
### 
WRIGLEY FIELD, CHICAGO,
Oct. 5 (UP). —If the "Damyankees"
don't beat you one way they will
another. They played National
League baseball today to defeat the
Chicago Cubs, 3-1, as the opening
salvo in their drive to become the
first team in baseball history to win
three straight world champion
ships.
Without the home runs and
mighty blasts with which they ter
rorized the American League, the
Yanks conquered the Cubs' greatest
pitcher, Bill Lee, so easily the crowd
of 44,242 sat almost dumbfounded.
RUFFING VICTOR
Instead of watching a team of
murderous hitters lay down a thun
derous barrage, the throng saw the
Yanks flash a whirlwind defensive
combination around second base
which choked oft' almost every Chi
cago threat and left Red Ruffing

job.
With slim, dark-eyed Frank Cro
setti and red-faced rookie Joe Gor
don performing splendidly around
the keystone sack, the Yanks were
able to roll on to their opening tri
umph behind Rufling's pitching per
formance. Rufting gave up nine hits,
good enough pitching, but not
great.
CROSETTI STARS
It was Crosetti who made three
dazzling plays in the clutches, and
Gordon, cavorting in more springy
fashion than his predecessor, Tony
Lazzeri, who saved Ruffing from
what might have been several em
barrassing situations.
Bill Dickey, the Yanks' great
catcher, led the American Leaguers'
attack with four straight singles to
tie a World Series record. The only
other Yanks to get more than one
hit were two youngsters, Tommy
Ilenrich and Joe Gordon, with a
single and double apiece.
On the other occasion when Geh
rig fanned, swinging at a low curve
ball, it was Tony Lazzeri's master
minding from the Cubs' dugout
which came into open evidence.
Lazzeri stopped the game and called
Third Baseman Hack to the dugout,
and gave him a message which he
delivered to Lee. Then Hartnett
conferred with Lee. The next
pitch was a low curve, and Gehrig
went for it, swinging and missing
lustily.
Lee dug the first hole in his own
grave in the second inning when he
