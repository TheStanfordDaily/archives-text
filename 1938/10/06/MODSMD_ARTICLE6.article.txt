# Yanks Take Series Tilt Over Cubs
## Champs Win Opener, 3-1, as Dickey Hits Safely Four Times 
### 
WRIGLEY FIELD, CHICAGO,
Oct. 5 (UP). —If the "Damyankees"
don't beat you one way they will
another. They played National
League baseball today to defeat the
Chicago Cubs, 3-1, as the opening
salvo in their drive to become the
first team in baseball history to win
three straight world champion
ships.
Without the home runs and
mighty blasts with which they ter
rorized the American League, the
Yanks conquered the Cubs' greatest
pitcher, Bill Lee, so easily the crowd
of 44,242 sat almost dumbfounded.
RUFFING VICTOR
Instead of watching a team of
murderous hitters lay down a thun
derous barrage, the throng saw the
Yanks flash a whirlwind defensive
combination around second base
which choked oft' almost every Chi
cago threat and left Red Ruffing
wilh the easiest kind of a pitching
job.
With slim, dark-eyed Frank Cro
setti and red-faced rookie Joe Gor
don performing splendidly around
the keystone sack, the Yanks were
able to roll on to their opening tri
umph behind Rufling's pitching per
formance. Rufting gave up nine hits,
good enough pitching, but not
great.
CROSETTI STARS
It was Crosetti who made three
dazzling plays in the clutches, and
Gordon, cavorting in more springy
fashion than his predecessor, Tony
Lazzeri, who saved Ruffing from
what might have been several em
barrassing situations.
Bill Dickey, the Yanks' great
catcher, led the American Leaguers'
attack with four straight singles to
tie a World Series record. The only
other Yanks to get more than one
hit were two youngsters, Tommy
Ilenrich and Joe Gordon, with a
single and double apiece.
On the other occasion when Geh
rig fanned, swinging at a low curve
ball, it was Tony Lazzeri's master
minding from the Cubs' dugout
which came into open evidence.
Lazzeri stopped the game and called
Third Baseman Hack to the dugout,
and gave him a message which he
delivered to Lee. Then Hartnett
conferred with Lee. The next
pitch was a low curve, and Gehrig
went for it, swinging and missing
lustily.
Lee dug the first hole in his own
grave in the second inning when he
! walked Gehrig on four straight
; pitches with one out. Dickey sin
' gled past Rip Collins, sending Geh
| rig to third. Dickey raced to sec
j ond on Cavarretta's relay to Hack.
In this spot George Selkirk hit a ;
! slow roller at Billy Herman, who
I came in on the grass to reach the
ball. He juggled it and Gehrig
; scored, Dickey reached third, and
I Selkirk was safe at first.
Then Gordon, making his first
j appearance at bat in a World Series,
I slashed a hot driye past Hack's left,
I and Dickey scored- Lee got out of
the jam when Ruffing bounced into
j a double play, Jurges to Herman to
I Collins.
That one brief splurge proved
good enough to decide the ball
game.
The Cubs hustled a run in the
third, and also hustled themselves
out of what might have been a rally.
Rip Collins opened the third with a
line single to right. Jurges fanned,
and Lee tapped in front of the plate,
but Collins moved to second on
i Lee's out. Hack singled sharply to
right, scoring Collins, and went to
second on the throw-in to the plate.
Billy Herman slammed a single off
Red Rolfe's glove, and Hack tried to
j score. Crosetti raced over behind
I Rolfe and retrieved the ball to nip
J Hack at the plate with an unerring
I throw.
The Yanks couldn't score again
until the sixth. Henrich led off with
i a double off the right field wall but
seemingly was stranded when Di
; Magigo flied out and Gehrig fanned.
With two out, Dickey hit a short
| fly to left, which the wind got under
j and blew toward the infield and
J Demaree couldn't quite reach it.
i Henrich easily scored.

Cavarretta led off the seventh with
a sharp single to center, but Crosetti
gobbled up Carl Reynolds' roller and
converted it into a double play. This
play averted trouble for the Yanks
as Gabby Hartnett, playing with two
damaged fingers, lashed a fly along
the right field line which Henrich. in
trying for" a diving catch, played
into a triple. With Hartnett on
third, Collins bounced a hot ground
er through the box, which looked
every inch a hit. Crosetti raced over
to his right, scooped the ball up
back of second, and threw out Col
lins on the greatest play of the
game.
The Cubs tried to start an upris
ing in the eighth. Jurges opened the
inning with a single, but Crosetti
and Gordon cut them down. Pinch
hitter Jimmy O'Dea rolled to Gor
don, who tossed to Crosetti, forcing
Jurges. Then Hack, who had three
straight hits, came up. His best ef
fort was a grounder which Gordon
gobbled up and tossed to Crosetti to
set up another important double
play.

first team in baseball history to win
three straight world champion
ships.
Without the home runs and
mighty blasts with which they ter
rorized the American League, the
Yanks conquered the Cubs' greatest
pitcher, Bill Lee, so easily the crowd
of 44,242 sat almost dumbfounded.
RUFFING VICTOR
Instead of watching a team of
murderous hitters lay down a thun
derous barrage, the throng saw the
Yanks flash a whirlwind defensive
combination around second base
which choked oft' almost every Chi
cago threat and left Red Ruffing
wilh the easiest kind of a pitching
job.
With slim, dark-eyed Frank Cro
setti and red-faced rookie Joe Gor
don performing splendidly around
the keystone sack, the Yanks were
able to roll on to their opening tri
umph behind Rufling's pitching per
formance. Rufting gave up nine hits,
good enough pitching, but not
great.
CROSETTI STARS
It was Crosetti who made three
dazzling plays in the clutches, and
Gordon, cavorting in more springy
fashion than his predecessor, Tony
Lazzeri, who saved Ruffing from
what might have been several em
barrassing situations.
Bill Dickey, the Yanks' great
catcher, led the American Leaguers'
attack with four straight singles to
tie a World Series record. The only
other Yanks to get more than one
hit were two youngsters, Tommy
Ilenrich and Joe Gordon, with a
single and double apiece.
On the other occasion when Geh
rig fanned, swinging at a low curve
ball, it was Tony Lazzeri's master
minding from the Cubs' dugout
which came into open evidence.
Lazzeri stopped the game and called
Third Baseman Hack to the dugout,
and gave him a message which he
delivered to Lee. Then Hartnett
conferred with Lee. The next
pitch was a low curve, and Gehrig
went for it, swinging and missing
lustily.
Lee dug the first hole in his own
grave in the second inning when he
! walked Gehrig on four straight
; pitches with one out. Dickey sin
' gled past Rip Collins, sending Geh
| rig to third. Dickey raced to sec
j ond on Cavarretta's relay to Hack.
In this spot George Selkirk hit a ;
! slow roller at Billy Herman, who
I came in on the grass to reach the
ball. He juggled it and Gehrig
; scored, Dickey reached third, and
I Selkirk was safe at first.
Then Gordon, making his first
j appearance at bat in a World Series,
I slashed a hot driye past Hack's left,
I and Dickey scored- Lee got out of
the jam when Ruffing bounced into
j a double play, Jurges to Herman to
I Collins.
That one brief splurge proved
good enough to decide the ball
game.
The Cubs hustled a run in the
third, and also hustled themselves
out of what might have been a rally.
Rip Collins opened the third with a
line single to right. Jurges fanned,
and Lee tapped in front of the plate,
but Collins moved to second on
i Lee's out. Hack singled sharply to
right, scoring Collins, and went to
second on the throw-in to the plate.
Billy Herman slammed a single off
Red Rolfe's glove, and Hack tried to
j score. Crosetti raced over behind
I Rolfe and retrieved the ball to nip
J Hack at the plate with an unerring
I throw.
The Yanks couldn't score again
until the sixth. Henrich led off with
i a double off the right field wall but
seemingly was stranded when Di
; Magigo flied out and Gehrig fanned.
With two out, Dickey hit a short
| fly to left, which the wind got under
j and blew toward the infield and
J Demaree couldn't quite reach it.
i Henrich easily scored.

Cavarretta led off the seventh with
a sharp single to center, but Crosetti
gobbled up Carl Reynolds' roller and
converted it into a double play. This
play averted trouble for the Yanks
as Gabby Hartnett, playing with two
damaged fingers, lashed a fly along
the right field line which Henrich. in
trying for" a diving catch, played
into a triple. With Hartnett on
third, Collins bounced a hot ground
er through the box, which looked
every inch a hit. Crosetti raced over
to his right, scooped the ball up
back of second, and threw out Col
lins on the greatest play of the
game.
The Cubs tried to start an upris
ing in the eighth. Jurges opened the
inning with a single, but Crosetti
and Gordon cut them down. Pinch
hitter Jimmy O'Dea rolled to Gor
don, who tossed to Crosetti, forcing
Jurges. Then Hack, who had three
straight hits, came up. His best ef
fort was a grounder which Gordon
gobbled up and tossed to Crosetti to
set up another important double
play.

Instead of watching a team of
murderous hitters lay down a thun
derous barrage, the throng saw the
Yanks flash a whirlwind defensive
combination around second base
which choked oft' almost every Chi
cago threat and left Red Ruffing
wilh the easiest kind of a pitching
job.
With slim, dark-eyed Frank Cro
setti and red-faced rookie Joe Gor
don performing splendidly around
the keystone sack, the Yanks were
able to roll on to their opening tri
umph behind Rufling's pitching per
formance. Rufting gave up nine hits,
good enough pitching, but not
great.
CROSETTI STARS
It was Crosetti who made three
dazzling plays in the clutches, and
Gordon, cavorting in more springy
fashion than his predecessor, Tony
Lazzeri, who saved Ruffing from
what might have been several em
barrassing situations.
Bill Dickey, the Yanks' great
catcher, led the American Leaguers'
attack with four straight singles to
tie a World Series record. The only
other Yanks to get more than one
hit were two youngsters, Tommy
Ilenrich and Joe Gordon, with a
single and double apiece.
On the other occasion when Geh
rig fanned, swinging at a low curve
ball, it was Tony Lazzeri's master
minding from the Cubs' dugout
which came into open evidence.
Lazzeri stopped the game and called
Third Baseman Hack to the dugout,
and gave him a message which he
delivered to Lee. Then Hartnett
conferred with Lee. The next
pitch was a low curve, and Gehrig
went for it, swinging and missing
lustily.
Lee dug the first hole in his own
grave in the second inning when he
! walked Gehrig on four straight
; pitches with one out. Dickey sin
' gled past Rip Collins, sending Geh
| rig to third. Dickey raced to sec
j ond on Cavarretta's relay to Hack.
In this spot George Selkirk hit a ;
! slow roller at Billy Herman, who
I came in on the grass to reach the
ball. He juggled it and Gehrig
; scored, Dickey reached third, and
I Selkirk was safe at first.
Then Gordon, making his first
j appearance at bat in a World Series,
I slashed a hot driye past Hack's left,
I and Dickey scored- Lee got out of
the jam when Ruffing bounced into
j a double play, Jurges to Herman to
I Collins.
That one brief splurge proved
good enough to decide the ball
game.
The Cubs hustled a run in the
third, and also hustled themselves
out of what might have been a rally.
Rip Collins opened the third with a
line single to right. Jurges fanned,
and Lee tapped in front of the plate,
but Collins moved to second on
i Lee's out. Hack singled sharply to
right, scoring Collins, and went to
second on the throw-in to the plate.
Billy Herman slammed a single off
Red Rolfe's glove, and Hack tried to
j score. Crosetti raced over behind
I Rolfe and retrieved the ball to nip
J Hack at the plate with an unerring
I throw.
The Yanks couldn't score again
until the sixth. Henrich led off with
i a double off the right field wall but
seemingly was stranded when Di
; Magigo flied out and Gehrig fanned.
With two out, Dickey hit a short
| fly to left, which the wind got under
j and blew toward the infield and
J Demaree couldn't quite reach it.
i Henrich easily scored.

Cavarretta led off the seventh with
a sharp single to center, but Crosetti
gobbled up Carl Reynolds' roller and
converted it into a double play. This
play averted trouble for the Yanks
as Gabby Hartnett, playing with two
damaged fingers, lashed a fly along
the right field line which Henrich. in
trying for" a diving catch, played
into a triple. With Hartnett on
third, Collins bounced a hot ground
er through the box, which looked
every inch a hit. Crosetti raced over
to his right, scooped the ball up
back of second, and threw out Col
lins on the greatest play of the
game.
The Cubs tried to start an upris
ing in the eighth. Jurges opened the
inning with a single, but Crosetti
and Gordon cut them down. Pinch
hitter Jimmy O'Dea rolled to Gor
don, who tossed to Crosetti, forcing
Jurges. Then Hack, who had three
straight hits, came up. His best ef
fort was a grounder which Gordon
gobbled up and tossed to Crosetti to
set up another important double
play.
WRIGLEY FIELD, CHICAGO,
Oct. 5 (UP). —If the "Damyankees"
don't beat you one way they will
another. They played National
League baseball today to defeat the
Chicago Cubs, 3-1, as the opening
salvo in their drive to become the
first team in baseball history to win
three straight world champion
ships.
Without the home runs and
mighty blasts with which they ter
rorized the American League, the
Yanks conquered the Cubs' greatest
pitcher, Bill Lee, so easily the crowd
of 44,242 sat almost dumbfounded.
