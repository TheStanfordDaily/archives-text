Now once upon a lime, a year or
two ago, there existed a campus
drama group called Ram's Head. It
was the annual habit of this group
to award, for achievement, to those
presenting what Ram's Head con
sidered the best Big Games Gaieties,
praise through the medium of a
plaque.
There was one for the women and

engraved upon it with sufficient
depth to withstand the combined
, telling effects of erosion, corrosion,
and constant kicking about.

one for the men, with appropriate
symbols for each. The women's
plaque was marked with a huge "U"
standing, no doubt, for "U," and the
men's had a handsome ram's head
Finally, however, Ram's Head as
an organization was dissolved and
their manifold duties and functions
were taken over by the aggregation
called Stagers.
Stagers say they would much like
; to retain the charming tradition of
| awarding the plaque. Only they are
having difficulties.
First, they couldn't find the "U"
plaque, and now they can't find the
men's award. Mr. A. "Beans" Aus
tin, when sent out, really had little
trouble in getting back (he award
for the women's division. He re
membered he'd seen it at the Kappa
House once and thought it was n
' washboard. When he returned to
I retrieve it, though, he found the

Kappas, too, thought it was a wash
board. But that was all there was
too it.
The other plaque, everyone fig
ures, must be in the possession of
the Delts because one of their mem
bers won it last time it was won.
The Delts say they gave it to the
Pi Phi's. The Pi Phi's claim com
plete ignorance not only of the
plaque but of the Delts. Then the
S.A.E.'s, Stagers President J. P.
Cahn publicly claims, must have
buried it under their new walk or
surrounded it by a freshly painted
porch pillar.
So Stagers asks for skits, songs,
even roughly sketched on old wrap
ping paper, by the deadline tomor
i row for this year's Gaieties, the best
two of which, they say. if all goes
! well, will receive, of all things, a
. plaque to be displayed in Memorial
Hall's foyer with permission.
