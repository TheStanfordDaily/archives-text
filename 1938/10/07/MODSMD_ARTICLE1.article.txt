# Czechs Ask Mussolini's Intervention
## Prague Sends Appeal For Preservation Of Plebiscite Plan 
### 
PRAGUE, Friday, Oct. 7 (UP).â€”
The government of President-Pre
mier Jan Syrovy was reported early
today to have asked Premier Benito
Mussolini to intervene in Berlin and
prevent a scrapping of the Munich
four-power plan for plebiscites in
Czechoslovakia's part-German dis
tricts.
The appeal to Mussolini through
Italian Foreign Minister Count
Galeazzo Ciano was reported to have
been made by Frantisek Chvalkov
sky, new Czech foreign minister.

CONFER WITH BERLIN

Chvalkovsky, who quit as minister
to Rome to take over the foreign
affairs portfolio in General Syrovy's
reconstructed government, is pre
paring to go to Berlin to confer
with the German foreign minister
on a final settlement of the German
territorial demands.
Czech leaders feared there would
be no plebiscites of any kind.
It was reported Germany would
occupy, or at least take partial pos
session of these supposedly-pleb
iscite areas within a few days.

RELY ON DIPLOMACY

Disappointed by the failure of
Britain and France to intervene and
demand enforcement of the Munich
accord's plebiscite provisions, the
government appeared to be relying
on Chvalkovsky to use his powers
of personal persuasion in Rome and
Berlin.
Faccd with sterner demands from
Hitler the government yesterday
granted autonomy "within the
framework of the Republic" to its
000,000 Slovaks.
