# Premier Holds Britain's Favor
## Confidence Vote Given by Commons 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 6 (UP). —Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain re
ceived an overwhelming vote of con
fidence in Parliament today after he
had told the House of Commons his
government would pursue a double
edged policy of rearmament and
direct dealing with dictators.
The Prime Minister rejected the
idea of an immediate call for a
world peace conference to settle
outstanding differences, explaining
there was no assurance totalitarian
powers would attend a conference
and a conference that failed would
be worse than no conference at all.
The House, by a vote of 366 to
144, approved the "Peace of Mu
nich" and declared its support of
Chamberlain's policies "by which
war was averted." It also approved
his efforts to secure "a lasting
peace."
The vote came after a four-day
debate in which the Prime Minister
was the target of some of the most
savage attacks ever made on the
floor of Commons—by opposition
Conservatives, as well as by Liberal
and Labor party opposition.
