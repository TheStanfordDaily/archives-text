# Open House Tonight Starts Rush Period
## 
### 
Freshmen will start the first of their two treks this week-end to tho
wilds of the How. home of Greek fraternities, tonight at 7:30 o'clock. This
"open house" period is being tried for the first time at Stanford.
The period will last until midnight but rushees may spend only one
hour in each house to which they have been invited. Bud McDuflic, presi
dent of the Interfraternity Council, asked both rushees and houses to

►abide by the rules although no dis
-1 ciplinary action can be taken.
As it was felt that many of the
freshmen came to school with little
or no previous knowledge of frater
nities, this new open house period
was started in order that they could
orient themselves with respect to the
Row in general. The idea was
evolved by last year's Council after
an intensive study of rushing on
the Pacific Coast.

3000 CARDS MAILED

Over 3000 rushing cards for this
period have been mailed to fresh
men and junior transfers, for whom
The Daily came out with a picture
map of the fraternities to aid in find
ing their way tonight.
Beginning next week - end, the
regular type of periods, which have
five dates per week-end—lunch, af
ternoon, and dinner periods on Fri
day and lunch and afternoon ones on
Saturday, will resume.
In response to several queries as
to what one should wear to the
houses tonight, The Daily made in
quiries and found that either sport
coats or suits with ties would be all
right.

or no previous knowledge of frater
nities, this new open house period
was started in order that they could
orient themselves with respect to the
Row in general. The idea was
evolved by last year's Council after
an intensive study of rushing on
the Pacific Coast.

3000 CARDS MAILED

Over 3000 rushing cards for this
period have been mailed to fresh
men and junior transfers, for whom
The Daily came out with a picture
map of the fraternities to aid in find
ing their way tonight.
Beginning next week - end, the
regular type of periods, which have
five dates per week-end—lunch, af
ternoon, and dinner periods on Fri
day and lunch and afternoon ones on
Saturday, will resume.
In response to several queries as
to what one should wear to the
houses tonight, The Daily made in
quiries and found that either sport
coats or suits with ties would be all
right.
