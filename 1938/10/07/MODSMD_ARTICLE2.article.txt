# THREE POWER AGREEMENT REACHED
## 
### 
LONDON. Oct. 6 (UP). â€” Great
Britain, France and Italy have
reached a broad basis for a three
power agreement aiming at settle
ment of the Spanish civil war and
T V : t French recognition of the
Italian conquest of Ethiopia, in
formed sources said today.
There may be considerable hag
gling over details, however, so that
announcement of the agreement may
be delayed.
Although little has been divulged
officially, the most reliable sources
indicate that an agreement is likely
along the following lines:
1. Italian Premier Benito Musso
lini will agree to a "token" with
drawal of a certain number of Ital
ian volunteers from the Spanish civil
war. Ten thousand is the most fre
quently mentioned number. That
will permit British Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain to declare a
substantial settlement has been
reached.
2. France will agree to keep the
French-Spanish frontier closed
to war materials for the Spanish
loyalists and probably also will send
an agent to the nationalist regime at
Burgos.
3. Both Britain and France will
immediately recognize the Italian
conquest of Ethiopia.
