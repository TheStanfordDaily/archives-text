# Card Eleven Set To Scalp Cougars
## Washington State Seeks Vengeance For Last Year's 23-0 Shellacking 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Can the Indians come back after tin- terrific lambasting handed them
by the Santa Clara Broncos last Saturday?
lhats the important question that will be answered some time tomor
row afternoon when an equally lambasted band of Cougar gridmcn from
Washington State meet the Cards in the Stanford Stadium.

Both the Cougars and the Indians
were victims of mild forms of assas
sination a week ago and both will
be out for their first win of the cur
rent campaign.
Babe Hollingbery Is bringing down
a squad of 31 heavy but disillusioned
ball players who, it is reported, aie
seeking plenty of vengcance after
the 23-0 defeat they suffered here
in 1937 and the 27-3 shellacking at,
the hands of California a short six
days ago.

COUGARS BLAME BREAKS

The Cougars claim that a few
early breaks gave the Bears a
chance to score and thus slowrd
down their offense to the point
where the Berkeleyites moved al
most at will.
And statistics seem to show that

There will be the regular root
ing section at the W.S.C. game lo
morrow, announced Jack Laney,
men's chairman of the Rally Com
mittee. In order to be admitted,
boys must wear white shirts and
regular rooting caps. The girls
must carry pom-pons, which will
be on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
today from 1 to .'{ p.m. and to
morrow from !) to 12.

their claims are fairly true. Wash
ington State made more first, downs
and completed more passes than the
Bears.

WASHINGTON STAR

Those who saw the game last year
will remember little Paul Callow, a
passing - kicking - running halfback
who left Indians sprawled all over
the field on his magnificent punt re
turns. His split-second passing over
the center of the line accounted for
most of his team's yardage against
Cal.

INDIANS PERK UP

Right here in our own back yard,
Coach Tiny Thornhill smiled again
last night as he watched his men
perk up for the first time in five
days. The new first string had fire
aplenty and it looks like the coaches
have finally found a line that can
and will charge.
The Indians will miss Norm Stand -
lee, Dick Sutton, and Jack Clark,
three first-string men on the hospi
tal list, but are likely to add in re
newed determination what they have
lost in man power.
Andy Stojkovich and Bill Willard,
Stanford's best. ends in the Santa
I Clara scrimmage, will start at the,
flanks. By West and Stan Andersen
will open at tackle. West wasn't too
good at guard against the Broncos.
' but he has played a consistently
I fine game at tackle.
At guard Thornhill plans to start
i Corky Donahue and Pete Zagar with
j Hampton Pool ready for relief. Pool
j and Zagar have had only four days
Ito learn the new position but are
j being figured on to surprise all
| hands tomorrow. Tony Calvelli is
I back in shape at center.

BACKFIELD POSTS

Pete Fay, at left halfback, is the
only backfield man slated for his j
regular post. Bill Kirsch will prob- .
ably start in place of Hugh Gallar
neau at right half, wtih Freddie
Ledeboer r.t full and Bill Paulman
at quarter. Paulman moved up into
the tailback spot to give Ledeboer
his first big chance as a starting
back.
Following are revised positions of
Stanford men likely to see action
with the starting eleven listed first:
Right end, Stojkovich, McElroy,
Hickingbotham; right tackle, Ander
sen, Johannessen, Trout; right guard,
Donahue, Orme, Braheny; center,
Calvelli, DeWitt; left guard, Zagar,
Pool, Dakan; left tackle. West, War
necke, Young; left end, Willard,
[Graff, Campbell; quarterback, Paul
man, Coldiron; letf half. Fay, Bren
j ner, Peterson; right half, Kirsch,
j Gallarneau, Casey; fullback, Lede-
I boer, Hamilton, Alustiza.
