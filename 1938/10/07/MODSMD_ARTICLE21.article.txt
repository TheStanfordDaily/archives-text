# Sophs to Hear Fitzpatrick
## Dance Theme to Be 'Let's Go Slumming' 
### 
Eddie Fitzpatrick and his band
will undoubtedly be the chief draw
ing card for the Sophomore Cotillion
to be held November 4, according to
General Chairman Bob Anderson.
For the second time in Stanford
history, a big-name band is to be
engaged for the annual sophomore
dance.

every evening. He has been chosen

SLUMMING THEME

At a meeting of publicity, decora
tion, and band committee members,
"Let's Go Slumming" was adopted
as the general theme of this main
social event of the Class of '41. Gene

motif. In keeping with the theme,
refreshments will be served by
typical bums.
