# New Card Song To Be Retried
## 
### 
At last Saturday's football
game a new song was intro
duced, but few people knew the
words, so it was lost in Santa
Clara cheers. Tomorrow, how
ever, Lomax Turner, chief yell
leader, wants everyone to bring
a copy of the song, which is
printed below, to the game,
and it will be tried again.
