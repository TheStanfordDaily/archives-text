# Field to Discuss Heat Exposure
## 
### 
In a talk over Station KGO at 9:30
o'clock next Monday, Dr. John Field
11, assistant professor of physiology
at Stanford University, will explain
how the body temperature of healthy
persons is kept so remarkably con
stant. No matter what the climate,
08.fi degrees can safely be termed the
normal body temperature of human
beings, according to Dr. Field.
In his discusison of "Temperature
Regulation in Health," Dr. Field will
also explain the physiological ef
fects of such temperature and hu
midity extremes as the "Black Hole
of Calcutta" incident and exposure
to the excessive cold of the Siberian
Wastelands.
"There are limits to the capacity
of the human body to withstand ad
verse climatic conditions," says Dr.
Field. "Too great exposure to cold
or heat will break down the thermal
defense mechanisms of the body and
will ultimately prove fatal. The
broad problem of man with regard
to climate is to live within these
limits."
