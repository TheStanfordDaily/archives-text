# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
In an article yesterday it was
asked why the authorities allowed
establishments to remain in busi
ness illegally. In the same article
the answer was given that the au
thorities would rather have Stanford
minors drinking in respectable
places rather than in some dive
where their drinking might know no
bounds. This is obviously a reflec
tion on the efficiency or integrity of
the Palo Alto authorities.
It was also stated that The Daily i
was exposing the personnel of the j
University to unfavorable publicity. I
All right, if there is any reason for j
unfavorable publicity let's get to the
bottom of it and clean it Up, instead j
of taking the weak-kneed policy of :
trying to cover it up.
