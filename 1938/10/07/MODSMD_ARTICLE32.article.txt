# WARNING FROM DEANS
## 
### 
The author of this article was per
haps right on one score, however.
The Deans of Men and Women
should have been notified, and the
warning should have come from
them.
However, the article has been
written, the fight has been started,
so let's finish it once and for all.
Interested
Members of Faculty
Stanford University,
Palo Alto. Calif.
Gentlemen:
If you had been at Dreamland
Pavilion last Saturday night you
would have heard certain things said
about the Stanford idea concerning
I the $30 per week plan that you
might not have liked. The speakers
certainly tore into a higher educa
tion that could only perpetuate

poverty in a land of plenty.
FACT IS YOU "HAVOCRATS" j
haven't got a leg to stand on be- |
cause YOU" DO NOT OFFER ANY
SOLUTION FOR WHAT AILS US.
ANYONE CAN CRITICIZE AD
VERSITY . . . The bribed econo
mists, the politicians and the college |
professors have certainly made a
mess of things and from this on will I
have a very difficult time of it be
cause the aroused masses are at last j
starting to think. When they ACT 1
AS THEY WILL ACT, the endow
ments of certain universities will do j
considerable shrinking in which j
event, the gentlemen who signed
this document for the perpetuation i
and encouragement of poverty, will !
be receiving less salary.
But do not think if your attacks j
succeed in 1938 that you have heard |
the last of the mob's clamoring, for |
the writer is in a position to inform i
you that 1940 will see even more
revolutionary measures brought I
forward in California. There will
be no let-up in our demands, and I
as we live under a system that is j
gradually tottering to its fall, we i
may even before 1940. achieve our I
objectives.
When we do, we shall remember j
the faculty of Stanford University,!
the members of which have made a j
great blunder in thus affronting the
persons who may yet be the mas- â– 
ters of the State of California. BUT
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS, RE- i
MEMBER. "YOU ASKED FOR IT." !
I am mailing this to the Student i
Daily of your university trusting
that it is a free press.
Yours truly,
Thirty Per Week Leader
The Editor, Sir:
The exchange from Stanford !
showed up in the mail today and j
contained a marvelous expose on the |
serving of liquor to minors around |
Stanford University.
Congratulations on one of the best ,
campaigns of any sort I've ever seen ;
put on by a campus daily. Keep up
the good work. Your paper has |
been excellent all around this year, j
William T. Brown
