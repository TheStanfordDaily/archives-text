# Nazis Predict Abandonment Of Plebiscites
## Czech Districts Bordering Germany Given to Hitler 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 6 (UP). —Nazi lead
ers predicted tonight the scheduled
plebiscites in Czechoslovakia's less
predominantly German areas, pro
vided for under the four-power
Munich accord, probably would be
abandoned.
TJiey indicated Germany's co-op
eration with the new Czech govern
ment would be so close and friendly
the only plebiscite would be a "dem
onstration" vote in the surrendered
Sudetenland similar to that held in
Austria last spring.

HITLER GIVEN ZONE FIVE

Informed Nazis based their pre
diction of a calling-off of the plebis
cites on the fact the international
commission of ambassadors laying
out the final boundaries of Czecho
lovakia has given Chancellor Adolf
Hitler all the districts bordering on
the German reich.
These districts, comprising the so
called "fifth zone" of German oc
cupation, included some towns
which the Munich accord had en
visaged as remaining under Czech
control.

CUSTOMS UNION HINTED

As a result, it was speculated here,
there probably will be no plebiscites
in the other areas unless the Czechs
themselves propose such a vote—a
development which Nazis said was
unlikely in view of today's develop
ments.
These developments included the
reported departure of a German eco
nomic commission for Prague to dis
cuss "close economic co-operation"
which probably will amount to a
Czech-German customs union.
