# June Butler Wins Luck Rifle Match
## 
### 
Wednesday night's luck rifle
match, held by the Stanford Rifle
and Pistol Club, was won by June
Butler of Lagunita, who received
the first prize of two tickets to the
Stanford theater. Second and third
prize winners were Frank Linvill of
Branner and R. Harbke.
The luck match for all students of
ficially opened the fall quarter ac
tivities of the Rifle Club. It will be
followed by various other novelty
matches and the regular intercol
legiate postal matches by the varsity
teams.
The Club has installed the range
with a new lighting system recom
mended by the National Rifle Asso
ciation, of which the club is a mem
ber. This system provides good,
cheerful lighting rather than the
cavern-like atmosphere of the usual
rifle and pistol range. This idea has
been worked out by experts, and in
installing it the Stanford club is one
of the few experimental units in the
National Rifle Association to try the
new system.
