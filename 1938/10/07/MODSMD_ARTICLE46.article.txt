# Japanese Block Prints Shown at Art Gallery
## 
### 
"The old art of Japanese wood
block printing has been revived in
the last 20 years and brought to a
technical perfection that is quite re
markable," Mrs. Bailey Willis ex
plained in speaking of her collection
of Japanese block prints, a selection
of which is currently being shown
at the Stanford Art Gallery.
The collection showing block
prints of outstanding Japanese artists
is being exhibited only during the
first two weeks of October. Land
scapes, figures, heads, nature studies,
and city scenes are included in the
block print selection.

VISITED JAPAN

Mrs. WillLs, wife of Professor Bai
ley Willis of the Geology Depart
ment, became interested in the art
of block printing during her visit to
Japan last year. Consequently, she
obtained examples of their best
work.
"The sharpness and delicate shad
ing from dark tone to light that is a
feature of the prints is produced by
reprinting the same block as close as

a fraction of an inch each time and
using as many as 20 shades and col
ors,' Mrs. Willis stated. "Some
times it takes two to three months to
do just the printing of one picture."

HAND PAINTING

In interpreting the difference be
tween the Oriental and American
prints, the enthusiastic collector de
clared, "Many more blocks are used
by the Japanese than is our custom.
Twenty is not an unusual number,
and much more subtle effects are ob
tained in this way as well as by the
method of printing. The Japanese
do not print by a press, but by rub
bing from the back by hand."
The detailed work and beauty of
each print is almost unbelievable
until one has seen the exhibit. Such
a collection is of particular interest
to the layman since no great knowl
edge of art is necessary to enjoy and
appreciate the prints.
In conjunction with the Japanese
exhibit, a group of block prints by
William S. Rice of Oakland is on
display.
