# PEG GETS PEGLEG
## 
### 
Tiny may be worrying about three
of his men being laid up with bad
ankles, but the D.G.'s are all upset
because Peg Schaeffer turned her
ankle in the first D.G. intramural
football game, touch-tackle style.
All Tiny's men but one will be back
in the game Saturday and Peg hopes
to be in touch-tackling before the
latter.
Stew Ingehart, Cecil Smith, and
Tommy Hitchcock ai'e the only polo
players in the world today accorded
a ten-goal rating by the United
States Polo Association.
