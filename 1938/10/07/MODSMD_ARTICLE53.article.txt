1 AST Saturday's practice scrim
~* mage against Santa Clara has
been practically forgotten inside
Stanford's big green fence, and the
Indians are ready to open their con
ference season with new lire and a
reshuffled grid deck.
Stanford's big advantage will be
in its backfield. Cougar Coach Babe
Hollingbery was dealt a double
backfield blow early in the season
with the loss of Ed Zydowsky,
sophomore fullback sensation, and
Earl Ross, veteran right halfback
from Honolulu.
But the Cougars still have their
passers and some good pass plays.
They completed a great many tosses
against Oregon and California and
can be expected to make their
greatest yardage against Stanford in
the air. Most Washington State
passers are left-handed, Cecil Welch
ko leading the group from a half
spot.
And there will be some good run
ners coming down from Pullman.

Joe Angelo, rug
ged blocker and
line-backer, has
jbeen moved to
fullback, and he'll
do some hard, fast
running wilh the
ball. He started
his team against
the Golden Bears

with a march down the field that
made him look like Alexander the
Great.
in all its phases, is one
of the Cougars' longest suits,
They put a man in there for the
kickoffs who never fails to boot the
ball into the end zone. Opponents
have found it safest just to let it go
and start from the 20-yard stripe.
In the punting department, Paul
Callow is one of the fastest and most
dangerous quick kickers on the
Coast.
Stanford and Washington State
lines are about even. Where the
Cards have the edge in the end
and center positions, the Cougars
have some mighty fine guards and
tackles.
Hollingbery lias had to change
his double shift because of vehe
ment protest the last few years,
but reports from Eugene and Ber
keley say that the new "hop-ti
diddy" shift, a variation of the old
double shift, is more puzzling than
ever. The only apparent change
is that now the second shift,
which doesn't give the defense
lime to change accordingly, takes
place far behind the line of
scrimmage.
Washington State has some fine
blockers and a fast charging line,
both of which looked especially weak
on the Card side of the ball last
Saturday.
JJESIDES line-up changes, nothing
spectacular has happened in se
cret practices this week. The secrecy
was simply to keep the changes
quiet until they were more definite.
And things that happen in practice
always get around, often unbeknown
to the persons who pass out the in
formation in innocent bull-sessions.
And it does no good to cook up new
plays for the opponents if they are
going to be old before the game day.
The line changes are no longer
secret. What has happened is sim
ply that Tiny and his assistants have
figured out a way to get the best
blockers and tacklers on the field at
the same time without messing up
the offense.
Bill Willard and Andy Stojkovich
have moved into first-string flank
posts. Both were outstanding
against Santa Clara, and they look
good in practice.

By West will be in the first-string i
left tackle post, where he has never i
failed to make a fine showing. And [
Stan Andersen still cannot be beat

on the other side.
Pete Zagar will I
be tried at leftj
s;uard, and Hamp
Pool, shifted from |
halfback becausej
of his fine block- j
ing, will see con- j

I siderable action in the same spot, j
j Corky Donahue will hold down the'
j other guard spot, followed by Chick |
j Orme. Tony Calvelli will continue I
| in the pivot post, where he is slow- [
ly becoming famous.
There are still plenty of good!
j backfield men with almost equal j
chances of starting. Fay and i
Fred Ledeboer will be sure starters,
but Tiny will have to do some care- !
!1 HI thinking about right half and j
| quarterback openings.
JJILLY KIRSCH, known for his
line blocking and tackling, will j
j probably be needed at half. But j
I Hugh Gallarneau, though he is in- j
| experienced and still needs a little |
i practice in fundamentals and pass
defense, is still an excellent south->
1 paw passer and may start if the!
Cards receive the kick-off.
Bill Paulman and Gene Coldiron
are running a nip-and-tuck battle
| for the quarter post, but Paulman's
i experience and fine kicking and
passing may give him the edge. Here |
again the toss-up may determine the'
starters.
Ankle trouble is troubling Tiny !
this week. Norm Standlee, Jack
Clark, and Dick Sutton, all former
first-stringers, are laid up with
hot -water hags on their ankles. |
Sutton may he out for several j
weeks.
The boys that have been shifted I
will not be well experienced in their
new spots tomorrow, and it is fortu- j
nate for the Indians that they won't i
be meeting Washington or one of j
the crack Los Angeles teams.
But it is sale to guarantee that j
the Big Red Machine will run much I
more smoothly than it did last week, j
It will take a fine defense to stop ]
them and a mighty fine offense to j
go through them.

1 AST Saturday's practice scrim
~* mage against Santa Clara has
been practically forgotten inside
Stanford's big green fence, and the
Indians are ready to open their con
ference season with new lire and a
reshuffled grid deck.
Stanford's big advantage will be
in its backfield. Cougar Coach Babe
Hollingbery was dealt a double
backfield blow early in the season
with the loss of Ed Zydowsky,
sophomore fullback sensation, and
Earl Ross, veteran right halfback
from Honolulu.
But the Cougars still have their
passers and some good pass plays.
They completed a great many tosses
against Oregon and California and
can be expected to make their
greatest yardage against Stanford in
the air. Most Washington State
passers are left-handed, Cecil Welch
ko leading the group from a half
spot.
And there will be some good run
ners coming down from Pullman.

Joe Angelo, rug
ged blocker and
line-backer, has
jbeen moved to
fullback, and he'll
do some hard, fast
running wilh the
ball. He started
his team against
the Golden Bears

with a march down the field that
made him look like Alexander the
Great.
in all its phases, is one
of the Cougars' longest suits,
They put a man in there for the
kickoffs who never fails to boot the
ball into the end zone. Opponents
have found it safest just to let it go
and start from the 20-yard stripe.
In the punting department, Paul
Callow is one of the fastest and most
dangerous quick kickers on the
Coast.
Stanford and Washington State
lines are about even. Where the
Cards have the edge in the end
and center positions, the Cougars
have some mighty fine guards and
tackles.
Hollingbery lias had to change
his double shift because of vehe
ment protest the last few years,
but reports from Eugene and Ber
keley say that the new "hop-ti
diddy" shift, a variation of the old
double shift, is more puzzling than
ever. The only apparent change
is that now the second shift,
which doesn't give the defense
lime to change accordingly, takes
place far behind the line of
scrimmage.
Washington State has some fine
blockers and a fast charging line,
both of which looked especially weak
on the Card side of the ball last
Saturday.
JJESIDES line-up changes, nothing
spectacular has happened in se
cret practices this week. The secrecy
was simply to keep the changes
quiet until they were more definite.
And things that happen in practice
always get around, often unbeknown
to the persons who pass out the in
formation in innocent bull-sessions.
And it does no good to cook up new
plays for the opponents if they are
going to be old before the game day.
The line changes are no longer
secret. What has happened is sim
ply that Tiny and his assistants have
figured out a way to get the best
blockers and tacklers on the field at
the same time without messing up
the offense.
Bill Willard and Andy Stojkovich
have moved into first-string flank
posts. Both were outstanding
against Santa Clara, and they look
good in practice.

By West will be in the first-string i
left tackle post, where he has never i
failed to make a fine showing. And [
Stan Andersen still cannot be beat

on the other side.
Pete Zagar will I

s;uard, and Hamp

halfback becausej
of his fine block- j
ing, will see con- j

I siderable action in the same spot, j
j Corky Donahue will hold down the'
j other guard spot, followed by Chick |
j Orme. Tony Calvelli will continue I
| in the pivot post, where he is slow- [

There are still plenty of good!
j backfield men with almost equal j
chances of starting. Fay and i
Fred Ledeboer will be sure starters,

1 AST Saturday's practice scrim
~* mage against Santa Clara has
been practically forgotten inside
Stanford's big green fence, and the
Indians are ready to open their con
ference season with new lire and a
reshuffled grid deck.
Stanford's big advantage will be
in its backfield. Cougar Coach Babe
Hollingbery was dealt a double
backfield blow early in the season
with the loss of Ed Zydowsky,
sophomore fullback sensation, and
Earl Ross, veteran right halfback
from Honolulu.
But the Cougars still have their
passers and some good pass plays.
They completed a great many tosses
against Oregon and California and
can be expected to make their
greatest yardage against Stanford in
the air. Most Washington State
passers are left-handed, Cecil Welch
ko leading the group from a half
spot.
And there will be some good run
ners coming down from Pullman.

Joe Angelo, rug
ged blocker and
line-backer, has
jbeen moved to
fullback, and he'll
do some hard, fast
running wilh the
ball. He started
his team against
the Golden Bears

with a march down the field that
made him look like Alexander the
Great.
in all its phases, is one
of the Cougars' longest suits,
They put a man in there for the
kickoffs who never fails to boot the
ball into the end zone. Opponents
have found it safest just to let it go
and start from the 20-yard stripe.
In the punting department, Paul
Callow is one of the fastest and most
dangerous quick kickers on the
Coast.
Stanford and Washington State
lines are about even. Where the
Cards have the edge in the end
and center positions, the Cougars
have some mighty fine guards and
tackles.
Hollingbery lias had to change
his double shift because of vehe
ment protest the last few years,
but reports from Eugene and Ber
keley say that the new "hop-ti
diddy" shift, a variation of the old
double shift, is more puzzling than
ever. The only apparent change
is that now the second shift,
which doesn't give the defense
lime to change accordingly, takes
place far behind the line of
scrimmage.
Washington State has some fine
blockers and a fast charging line,
both of which looked especially weak
on the Card side of the ball last
Saturday.
JJESIDES line-up changes, nothing
spectacular has happened in se
cret practices this week. The secrecy
was simply to keep the changes
quiet until they were more definite.
And things that happen in practice
always get around, often unbeknown
to the persons who pass out the in
formation in innocent bull-sessions.
And it does no good to cook up new
plays for the opponents if they are
going to be old before the game day.
The line changes are no longer
secret. What has happened is sim
ply that Tiny and his assistants have
figured out a way to get the best
blockers and tacklers on the field at
the same time without messing up
the offense.
Bill Willard and Andy Stojkovich
have moved into first-string flank
posts. Both were outstanding
against Santa Clara, and they look
good in practice.

By West will be in the first-string i
left tackle post, where he has never i
failed to make a fine showing. And [
Stan Andersen still cannot be beat

on the other side.
Pete Zagar will I
be tried at leftj
s;uard, and Hamp
Pool, shifted from |
halfback becausej
of his fine block- j
ing, will see con- j

I siderable action in the same spot, j
