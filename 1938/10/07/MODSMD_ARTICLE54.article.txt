SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 5 (UP).|
—Determined to bring the world's !
land speed crown back to America,
Ab Jenkins, Utah racing pilot, ar
rived Wednesday with his new Mor
mon Meteor 111, which he just fin
ished in Indianapolis. He will in
spect various courses on Bonneville
salt flats Thursday with the hope of j
laying out a runway for endurance '
racing—his first objective. Jenkins j
now holds most of the endurance'
marks, but has ambitions of domi- j
I nating that field completely.
When his endurance runs are 1
J over, Jenkins plans to return to In
dianapolis, put another motor in the j
racer and return to the salt flats for i
a crack at the measured mile record |
of 357.5 miles per hour established
last month by Capt. G. E. T. Eyston
of England.
