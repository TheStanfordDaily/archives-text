## JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor Papooses To Meet Weighty Trobabes 
### 
The age-old query as to whether
a good big man is better than a good
little man will be enacted on the
Stanford Stadium turf tomorrow
afternoon, in a somewhat enlarged
scale, when the Papooses try to hang
up the collective scalps of the Uni
versity of Southern California Tro
babes. The game will start at 12:15
o'clock.
The only difference tomorrow will
be that it will be eleven big men,
personified by the Trojan frosh,
and eleven "little men," as por
trayed by the Card yearlings. To
give you an idea of how the weights
of the teams balance, Wink Jones,
195-pound Papoose tackle, is the
heaviest lineman on the team, while
the whole Trobabe line AVERAGES
197 pounds. Jack Francis, 180-pound
quarretback, is Coach Harry Ship
key's heaviest starter in the back
field, but the S.C. backs AVERAGE
185 pounds. Thus the Trobabes
pack a 12-pound nudge in average
line weights and an insignificant 18-
pound edge in the backfield. And
that's no small item for the Papooses
to buck.
Coach Shipkey realizes that the
Cards' only possible solution is to
outcharge the heavier S.C. team
from the opening whistle to the
closing gun, and he's been working
that principle into them all week.
He scrimmaged the frosh Monday
and Tuesday, held dummy pass
scrimmage Wednesday, and yester
day he handed them a dose of pass
defense drill .
The Trobabes, coached by Julius
Bescos, former S.C. football captain,
play a type of game calculated to
intimidate their foes, plenty rough.
The S.C. frosh offensive features a
single wing back, and when Lefty
Erwin, left-handed passing right
half, takes the ball on a reverse from
his wing spot, anything is liable to
happen. Erwin hits hard and fast
into the short side, and, being left
handed, is also an accurate passing
threat on the same play.
Max Green, starting S.C. quarter,
and Bill Savoy, his first substitute,
are the two ace ball-packers on the
southern outfit, Green specializing
on off-tackle power thrusts and
Savoy on speedy end sweeps. Both
are also good punters.
Although he isn't slated to start
the game, S.C. expects a lot of power

when Bill Musick, 203-pound full
back, goes into the game. Musick is
the brother of Jim Musick, one of
the hardest-hitting backfield men in
Trojan history.
On the line, the Trobabes have
weight and power galore. It re
mains to be seen if they can get out
of their own way. The S.C. starting
linoup follows: Bob Jones and Joe
Davis, ends; Don Stuart and Jim
Moore, tackles; Ernest Becker and
Bill Bundy, guards; Bob de Lauer,
center. Backfield: Max Green, quar
terback; Dave Haskell and Bill Er
win, halves; and Hal Bowen, full
back.
Coach Shipkey will start the same
Papoose eleven which started last
week, with ont possible change. If
the Papooses kick off, Larry Par
tridge will start at right tackle in
place of Wink Jones, so that the
Cards can take advantage of his
kick-off ability. Jones would enter
the game immediately following the
kick-off, however.
Well satisfied with his team's
blocking last Saturday, Coach Ship
key still has his fingers crossed, as
Pomona Junior College offered Stan
ford no chance to test its defense.
Meanwhile the Trobabes have sharp
ened their teeth in two tough games,
losing to the U.S.C. Spartans, Tro
jan varsity reserves, 25-0, and de
feating Glendale Junior College,
13-6.
Frankie Albert has been chosen
captain for tomorrow's game, with
Dave Patterson, hard - charging
guard, being line-captain.
