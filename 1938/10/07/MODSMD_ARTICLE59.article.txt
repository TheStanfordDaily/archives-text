# Gomez Pitches Yanks to Win Over Cubs, 6-3
## Homers by Crosetti, DiMag Cinch Game; Arm Cripples Dean 
### 
WKICLEY FIELD. Chicago. Oct.
G (UP).—The Yankees closed with a
rush today, rifling out home runs
in the eighth and ninth innings by
Frank Crosetti and Joe DiMaggio
to defeat Chicago, (J to 3, in the sec
ond game of the World Series and
apparently bring the brilliant pitch
ing career near to its finish.
For seven innings Ole Diz. his
fast ball gone because of a dead
arm, staged a crafty exhibition
and, aided by Joe Marty's timely
hitting, held a lead over Vernon
(Goofy) Gomez, the starting Yan
kee chucker.
Then Diz pitched one in the groove
to Crosetti, and the Yankee short
stop put the ball in the left field
bleachers and also scored Myril
Hoag, who was sent in to bat for
Gomez.
Diz stuck by his guns and wound
up the inning by striking out Red
Rolfe.

DIZ GONE TO SHOWERS

Came the ninth, with the Cubs
trailing by one run, 4-3, and Ole
Diz, still fighting bad weather, a
weak arm and irresistible Old Man
Time, strode back to the mound.
Then Henrich singled and Di Mag
gio followed it with his homer into
the left field stands.
DiMaggio's blow sent Dean to the
showers, a sad figure who lost today
in his most dramatic bid for more
of the greatness he has known for
most of a decade.
Larry French replaced Dean as
Chicago's pitcher and brought the
inning to a close without further
damage.

GOMEZ TIES RECORD

It was a great day for Gomez, for
mer San Francisco Seal, even if he
was hauled out of the ball game for
a pinch hitter in the eighth inning,
for he was the winning pitcher, and
his victory tied a world record. Only
three men in baseball have won six
World Series games—Gomez, Waite,
Hoyte and Chief Bender, who pilched
in the long ago.
The Cubs set down the Yanks in
order in the first, and then punched
over one run in their half of the
frame. Stan Hack, former Sacra
mentan, duplicated yesterday's per
formance by opening with a single.
Herman fanned. Frank Demaree,
another ex-Coaster, singled to right,
sending Hack to third, Demaree took
second on the throw-in, on which
Roll'e was charged with an error at
third.

DI MAG 'ROBS' MARTY

Joe Marty, graduate of the Seals,
cr.me to bat and socked a fly clear
to the center-field wall, which Joe
Di Maggio, another ex-Seal, caught
after a hard run. It looked like a
home-run ball, and was so far away
that Hack scored after the catch.
Reynolds fanned for the third out.
New York came back with a pair
of runs in the second. Di Maggio,
first man up, singled to left, Gehrig
walked. Dickey popped to Jurges.
Selkirk flied to Marty, both run
ners holding their bases. Then Joe
Gordon, the rookie second baseman
whose hit yesterday provided the
Yanks with their winning margin in
the second inning, hit a slow roller
between Hack and Jurges.
Both fielders dashed after the ball
and collided, the ball dribbling into
the outfield while both Di Maggio
and Gehrig came home. It was scor
ed as a double for Gordon.
Gomez flied to Reynolds to end
the spree, but he now held a 2-1
lead.

(Goofy) Gomez, the starting Yan

Then Diz pitched one in the groove
to Crosetti, and the Yankee short
stop put the ball in the left field
bleachers and also scored Myril
Hoag, who was sent in to bat for
Gomez.
Diz stuck by his guns and wound
up the inning by striking out Red
Rolfe.

DIZ GONE TO SHOWERS

Came the ninth, with the Cubs
trailing by one run, 4-3, and Ole
Diz, still fighting bad weather, a
weak arm and irresistible Old Man
Time, strode back to the mound.
Then Henrich singled and Di Mag
gio followed it with his homer into
the left field stands.
DiMaggio's blow sent Dean to the
showers, a sad figure who lost today
in his most dramatic bid for more
of the greatness he has known for
most of a decade.
Larry French replaced Dean as
Chicago's pitcher and brought the
inning to a close without further
damage.

GOMEZ TIES RECORD

It was a great day for Gomez, for
mer San Francisco Seal, even if he
was hauled out of the ball game for
a pinch hitter in the eighth inning,
for he was the winning pitcher, and
his victory tied a world record. Only
three men in baseball have won six
World Series games—Gomez, Waite,
Hoyte and Chief Bender, who pilched
in the long ago.
The Cubs set down the Yanks in
order in the first, and then punched
over one run in their half of the
frame. Stan Hack, former Sacra
mentan, duplicated yesterday's per
formance by opening with a single.
Herman fanned. Frank Demaree,
another ex-Coaster, singled to right,
sending Hack to third, Demaree took
second on the throw-in, on which
Roll'e was charged with an error at
third.

DI MAG 'ROBS' MARTY

Joe Marty, graduate of the Seals,
cr.me to bat and socked a fly clear
to the center-field wall, which Joe
Di Maggio, another ex-Seal, caught
after a hard run. It looked like a
home-run ball, and was so far away
that Hack scored after the catch.
Reynolds fanned for the third out.
New York came back with a pair
of runs in the second. Di Maggio,
first man up, singled to left, Gehrig
walked. Dickey popped to Jurges.
Selkirk flied to Marty, both run
ners holding their bases. Then Joe
Gordon, the rookie second baseman
whose hit yesterday provided the
Yanks with their winning margin in
the second inning, hit a slow roller
between Hack and Jurges.
Both fielders dashed after the ball
and collided, the ball dribbling into
the outfield while both Di Maggio
and Gehrig came home. It was scor
ed as a double for Gordon.
Gomez flied to Reynolds to end
the spree, but he now held a 2-1
lead.
