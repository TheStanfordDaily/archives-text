# Stagers Set Tryout Date
## Gaieties Talent To Meet on Monday 
### KAY JOHNSEN 
"Sure, I tried out once—it's the
best way to get into dramatics at
Stanford," explains Jack Dawson
who will be one of the judges at the
Big Game Gaieties tryouts slated
for Monday from 2 to 5 o'clock in the
Memorial Hall.
The tryouts Monday arc for per
formers — singers, imitators, tap
dancers. All trained performers wel
come! Wanted!
Skit readings are scheduled for
Tuesday.
Tryoutees will gather in the Little
Theater and will be called into the
big theater by Stagers President
J. P. Cahn for private auditions. On
lookers will be judges Jack Dawson,
Shirley Jones, Gordy Williams, and
J. P. Cahn.
The tryouts are not competitive
as far as numbers go. According to
Cahn, as many as are good are
wanted.
Debarred are those who have not
at least a "C" bawlout average.
If you can't sing, but can "sell a
song"—put it over (like Stanford's
Doodles Weaver) — you're also
sought for the Gaieties. If you have
number selections, give them a try
for the Gaieties too.
P.S.—Does anyone know the
whereabouts of Stagers' missing
plaque? It had a Ram's Head en
graved on it, and was once thought
a washboard by Stanford's Kappas.
P.P.S.—A potential Irving Berlin:
I unknown Norm Walsh who breezed
| into the Dramatics office yesterday
i with 26 scores for the Gaieties.
