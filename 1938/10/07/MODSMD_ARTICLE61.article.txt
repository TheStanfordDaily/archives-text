# Card Soccer Team To Meet S. F. J. C.
## 
### 
"After five days of practice we're
shaping up fine and are lucky to
have no injuries or sick list," re
ported Card Coach Harry Maloney
when questioned yesterday regarding
Saturday's varsity soccer match with
San Francisco Junior College. The
game, the first conference encoun
ter of the season, will get the whistle
at 10 o'clock in the morning on the
varsity soccer field near the tennis
courts.
Although Stanford has ranked
among the top in this sport for some
years, and although tomorrow's
game will mark the S.F.J.C. debut
into the California Intercollegiate
Soccer Conference, the match prom
ises to be one of the season's hard
est fought. To begin with, the
Golden Gate boys have played the
game for some years. They are re
ported to have a good fast team that
knows its soccer in a scientific way.
On the other hand, while the
Farm squad appears to have all the
makings with 60 men out, a good
many with experience, there is a
dearth of returning lettermen and
the first team will largely have to
find itself from the ranks in tomor
row's game.
Most likely the starting line-up
will be made up from the following
choices: Rudy Munzer or Sans
Agero at goal. Bill Hamilton and
Dick Hammond or Cameron Pierce
and Ned Pugh at the fullbacks, Wil
son Clark or Grayson Bryan at
right half, Bill Edwards or Dave
MacKenzie at center half, and Ken
Cuthbertson or Ben Tiffany at left
half.
The outside right will see either
Howard Naquin or Bill Arrasmith,
the inside right Al Pellas or Chris
Sontum, the center forward Tevfik

Sedullah or Chris Sontum, the in
side left George Chalmers or George
Gedenole, and the outside left John
De Benedetti or Bill Barkan.
After a week of scrimmaging
among two squads meeting on alter
nate afternoons the entire Card
team will come together this after
noon for a final chalk talk. Tomor
row morning's match is free to the
general public as well as students.
