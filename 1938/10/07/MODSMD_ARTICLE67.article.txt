THE DAILY has had its say.
It has accomplished the purposes with
which it launched its five-day consideration of
liguor law control: to clarify for Stanford state
and local codes; to point the way for better
enforcement of those codes.
During the week, questions have arisen which
The Daily has attempted to answer: Was The
Daily independent in its action? Does The Daily
discriminate between those parts of establish
ments conducted legally, and those parts which
are not? Will The Daily act for state executives
in pursuing action against illegal practices?
Does The Daily or the administration attempt
to dictate Stanford's moral codes?
Briefly, the answers were:
1. The Daily has acted independently of any
student or administrative group.
2. The Daily casts no stigma of illegality on
innocent establishments or innocent people.
3. The Daily will focus its attention upon the
Farm, leaving legal action to civil authorities.
4. Neither The Daily nor the administration
makes the moral decision to drink or not to
drink for Stanford men and women.
Now it is up to the campus to continue the
education concerning, and enforcement of, its
laws.
Like the state or county, Stanford has certain
machines for carrying out these policies. Listed,
they include the sponsors, men's and women'i
councils, Executive Committee, house and club
presidents, Interfraternity and Pan - Hellenic
councils, and the administrative officers proper.
The power of these machines extends from
preventative to punitive. Their jurisdiction ex
tends over all of Stanford.
Executive Committee Tuesday night objected
to The Daily's campaign on the grounds that
the student machines should be the only groups
to take such action. "Let us look at them first,"
they said.
Now is the time to follow such a statement
with action.
Let Executive Committee look at the student
machines. Let the student machines look at
themselves. Let action follow that look.
The Daily's responsibility on the question is
ended. As it has refused to meddle with legal
machines, so it will refuse to tamper with stu
dent machines. They must act within their own
jurisdiction. The Daily can only point the direc
tion of that action.
Already the wheels have begun to grind, both
in the counties and on the Farm. But rusty
wheels are slow to start, and difficult to keep
going. And motionless wheels are no use at all.
In the future. The Daily will print only the
actions of those whose place it is to act. If they
act.
The Daily has had its say.
