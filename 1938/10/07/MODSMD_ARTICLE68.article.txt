HERE it is again.
We were wrong last week; tomorrow is
the Big Day, not last Saturday.
Yesterday, Tiny Thornhill showed he has
done something to his and Stanford's football
team. The football men have changed not only
in line-up, but in spirit as well. Overnight, the
team has picked up unity, snap, precision, fire.
At the beginning of the week, the Red Ma
chine's chances to right itself and roll on through
Cougar territory unscarred looked particularly
bad- and they continued to look bad up to and
including Wednesday night. Secret practices
shrouded that fact from public view.
Yesterday, that same team, except for the few
minor. changes, looked everything it should.
Only God and Tiny know why.
Sport columnists have been nice to the Farm,
this last week. They've listed Stanford's strong
points, merely tacked on its weak ones. They've
even hitched their wagons to the Little Red
Roller and said it could still be a great one,
despite Santa Clara.
And at this particular moment, it is, v/hat's
more.
Whatever the cause of Stanford's first defeat,
it won't be the same tomorrow. Psychologically,
the team is in the best condition since the be
ginning of practice. Physically, the last week
has been the toughest since that beginning. The
boys are primed to win their first and subse
quent Pacific Coast Conference games.
Farm rooters are even more enthusiastic
about tomorrow's game than before, since they
realize what hinges upon it. Literally, they are
already donning rooters' caps, doffing blue and
green ones.
No matter what happens, tomorrow's a Big
Day.
Maybe it'll bo a Red one. H. L. S.
