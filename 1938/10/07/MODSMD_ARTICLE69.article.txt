# No Parking Signs

### 
HAVING successfully banished "little cubby
holes and nooks" from campus barn
dances, thereby doing away in large part with
the hazard they create, the Administration has
now turned its energies to making the Quad
safe for the evening Libe-goer.
Because use of the Education Building causes
increased student and auto traffic at the Engi
neering Corner, Comptroller Jackson's office has
issued an order that Lasuen remain completely
closed between that point and English Corner
during an indefinite test period which may
result in complete abandonment of that side of
the Quad as a traveled road.
Granted that this will undoubtedly cut down
on the accident hazard between Quad and Libe,
just as removing the hay will cut down on it
at barn dances, it still seems that the Admin
istration might have studied the matter more
closely before taking an action which is bound
to annoy far more people than it pleases.
Evening traffic along the Quad is no more
dangerous than evening traffic along any lighted
street. Under normal conditions, crossing La
suen is no more dangerous than crossing Uni
versity Avenue. That conditions are not normal
the Administration recognizes by its action; but
its action does not touch the basic reason for it.
If the Administration really wishes to handle
the problem in the most efficient way, it might
better look to a prevention of parking along the
Quad side of the road, and the provision of an
adeguate parking lot behind the Education
Building.
It is not the traffic along the Quad which
creates the hazard; it is the fact that too many
cars try to park there.—A. S. D.
