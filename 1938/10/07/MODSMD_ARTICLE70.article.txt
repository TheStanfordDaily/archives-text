# BULL SESSION
## DEPARTMENT OF INWARD RAGING 
### JOHN COBBS 
SPRAWLED across today's Campus Opinion column
~ is a letter which reads like the lines usually as
signed to the character actor with hook nose and
black felt hat in Hollywood versions of the Russian
Revolution.
It is signed "Thirty Per Week Leader, and using
language that would make a satirist weep, it de
claims: "There will be no let-up to our demands, and
as we live under a system that is gradually tottering
to its fall, we may even before 1940 achieve our ob
jectives. When we do, we shall remember the faculty
of Stanford University, the members of which have
made a great blunder in thus affronting the persons
who may yet be masters of the State of California.
* * # *
We got a lot of fun out of that letter. Merry laugh
ter echoed through the Shack where before there had
been only the soft sneezing of the editor, and the
pianissimo swearing of the managing ed.
When I first read it, the temptation to write a
mockingly corrosive answer rose up and lured me,
even as the serpentine Satan lured Eve. But when
I went through it the second time, it didn't seem so
funny. On the third reading, I decided that the let
ter was one of the most tragic confessions of stupidity
that a man has ever written. It wasn t a bit funny.
The English language is adequate to most situa
tions. But our. Anglo-Saxon ancestors were never
faced with that combination of backward intellect and
forward conceit that accounts statements like, "If
anything happens, remember 'You asked for it'.
And so I leave the Thirty Per Week Leader blowing
into the balloon of his ego unmolested.
# * * *
OUT even so, I have the feeling that I should gargle
with a good mouthwash. Like the taste of bad
meat, the taste of that letter keeps coming back to me.
It must have been sincere. No joker would have
laid himself so open to contempt, even for the sake of
the iest. And if it is sincere, it is more depressing than
any European Puss Wants a Comer game.
The plan of the Thirty Dollar mystics has been
exploded by reputable economists until its name is a
joke. No economic theory from Adam Smith on down
will admit its paternity. And yet we find men who
crusade for it as though it were a new decalogue,
dictated verbatim by God, and backed by the Heav
enly treasury.
it s|t * *
In answer to quiet, well-thought criticisms, our
correspondent snarls threats and catch-words that
have been the exclusive property of pulp-magazine
authors for the last ten years. And what makes it
distressing is that this attitude seems typical of the
masses which back the Thursday Thirty dream.
There isn't anything we can do about it. But the
situation removes some of the glowing charm which
high school civics gave Democracy. It is a little annoy
ing to sec our birthright sold for a mess of catch
words.

We got a lot of fun out of that letter. Merry laugh
ter echoed through the Shack where before there had
been only the soft sneezing of the editor, and the
pianissimo swearing of the managing ed.
When I first read it, the temptation to write a
mockingly corrosive answer rose up and lured me,
even as the serpentine Satan lured Eve. But when
I went through it the second time, it didn't seem so
funny. On the third reading, I decided that the let
ter was one of the most tragic confessions of stupidity
that a man has ever written. It wasn t a bit funny.
The English language is adequate to most situa
tions. But our. Anglo-Saxon ancestors were never
faced with that combination of backward intellect and
forward conceit that accounts statements like, "If
anything happens, remember 'You asked for it'.
And so I leave the Thirty Per Week Leader blowing
into the balloon of his ego unmolested.

OUT even so, I have the feeling that I should gargle
with a good mouthwash. Like the taste of bad
meat, the taste of that letter keeps coming back to me.
It must have been sincere. No joker would have
laid himself so open to contempt, even for the sake of
the iest. And if it is sincere, it is more depressing than
any European Puss Wants a Comer game.
The plan of the Thirty Dollar mystics has been
exploded by reputable economists until its name is a
joke. No economic theory from Adam Smith on down
will admit its paternity. And yet we find men who
crusade for it as though it were a new decalogue,
dictated verbatim by God, and backed by the Heav
enly treasury.

In answer to quiet, well-thought criticisms, our
correspondent snarls threats and catch-words that
have been the exclusive property of pulp-magazine
authors for the last ten years. And what makes it
distressing is that this attitude seems typical of the
masses which back the Thursday Thirty dream.
There isn't anything we can do about it. But the
situation removes some of the glowing charm which
high school civics gave Democracy. It is a little annoy
ing to sec our birthright sold for a mess of catch
words.
SPRAWLED across today's Campus Opinion column
~ is a letter which reads like the lines usually as
signed to the character actor with hook nose and
black felt hat in Hollywood versions of the Russian
Revolution.
It is signed "Thirty Per Week Leader, and using
language that would make a satirist weep, it de
claims: "There will be no let-up to our demands, and
as we live under a system that is gradually tottering
to its fall, we may even before 1940 achieve our ob
jectives. When we do, we shall remember the faculty
of Stanford University, the members of which have
made a great blunder in thus affronting the persons
who may yet be masters of the State of California.
