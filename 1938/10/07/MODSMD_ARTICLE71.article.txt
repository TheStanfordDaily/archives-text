WITTING in the Stanford Library one morning, we
saw countless students of divergent types and in
terests. We realized at that moment, the sheer impos
sibility of one student's thinking for, writing for, or
criticizing for over four thousand students.
We realize that the few words we grind out are not
particularly important, instructive, or uplifting; there
fore, our only excuse for breaking into print occa
sionally is that we be entertaining.
If you want impartial presentations, read Bull Ses
sion; if you want humor, read Liphtly and Politely; if
you want crusades, read our Editor. If you want
purely personal opinions, read us.
Our opinions incidentally don't necessarily reflect
the attitude of The Daily or of the University; and if
the literary tastes of the student body demand that
Ferdinand the Bull and Wee Gillis occupy the book
store's most prominent display shelves, our opinions
don't necessarily reflect the student body's cither.
Our sole purpose, let us repeat, is not to encroach
upon other columns—but to entertain by purely per
sonal reactions. When we cease to entertain, we'll
resign voluntarily.
Our attitude toward Stanford is indicated in Erich
Maria Remarque's anecdote:
Two Englishmen were seated in a bar. One asked.
"Do yoU- like Americans?"
The other replied, "No."
The first asked, "Do you like English. French, Ger
mans, etc. (He named more nationalities than we
have space to print.)''
The second replied, "No."
"Well, who the devil do you like," asked the Eng
lishman.
The second answered quietly. "I like my friends."
