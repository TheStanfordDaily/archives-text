"THREE LOVES lIAS NANCY," j
currently playing at (lie Fox- j
Stanford:
Nancy is a li'l Southehn gel f'om !
Bihch Valleh an' Nancy is jilted at :
the altah by Gawge who has gawn I
to New Yawk so Nancy goes to New
Yawk ta fetch him. Well, Nancy !
falls in with a writeh fella who takes j
heh to a cafe wheah she says grace j
at dinneh an' smiles at a city slickeh
jest to be neighbohly an' pouahs j
wateh on the flame undeh the j
"crepes suzettes" yellin' "Fieh!"
So "Three Loves Has Nancy" goes,
on in that vein—a blight little com
edy with much of the ingenuous
charm and slap-happy horseplay
which marked the Spewack team's
other piece—"Boy Meets Girl."
Janet Gaynor made quite a spunky
Nancy. We can only conclude that !
Miss Gaynor is quite talented for
her age. Robert Montgomery, as a i
self-centered hack, and Franchot j
Tone as a merry souse, are ob
viously very well cast as glad boys. !
