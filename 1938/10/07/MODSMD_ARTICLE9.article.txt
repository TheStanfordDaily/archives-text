# Stone Speaks To Tryoutees At Meeting
## 
### 
Stressing the fact that working
on The Daily is the quickest way to
get to know Stanford and Stanford
people, Editor Jim Stone spoke to
tryoutees for the editorial staff at
their second meeting yesterday af
ternoon.
"By working around the Shack
you'll get acquainted with the most
diverse and interesting group on the
campus," Stone said, "because the
only thing everyone has in com
mon is The Daily."
Stone particularly encouraged try
outees not to be "scared out" by the
number competing. "We can always
make room for anyone that really
wants to work," he said.'
Next meeting will beÂ» Tuesday
afternoon, at 4 o'clock, upstairs in
the Journalism Building, as usual.
Students who have been unable to
attend any meetings so far can still
enroll then, or by getting in touch
with Phyllis White, woman's edi
tor, if they cannot get to the regular
sessions.
