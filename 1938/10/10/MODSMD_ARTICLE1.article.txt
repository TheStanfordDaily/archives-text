### 
Preliminary interviews of applicants from Stanford for the annual
Rhodes Scholarships will he made on or before Thursday of this week.
Dr. Philip W. Buck, chairman of the University Rhodes Committee, an
nounced yesterday.
Applicants will be interviewed by Dr. Buck in his ollice in the political
science department during regular office hoursâ€”at 9 o'clock on Tuesdays
and Wednesdays, 11 Thursdays, and 3 to 5 o'clock Thursdays. These earlv

meetings between the chairman and<
applicants are being arranged in or
der that final selection of candidates
may be made before the deadline set
by the state committee.
The interview is the first step in
the choice of candidates for the
scholarship. Stanford students are
nominated by the University com
mittee to the California state com
mittee, or, if the applicant is a stu
dent from out-of-state, he may be
nominated to the committee of the
state of which he is resident. Three
students, usually are nominated
from the University.
BROOKE NOMINATED
Wally Brooke, former A.S.S.U.
president and a Rhodes Scholar from
Stanford two years ago, was nomi
resident of Montana, and was nomi
nated to the Montana state com
mittee.
Following selections from the var
ious universities, the committee in
eac hstate then nominates two stu
dents from the entire state to a dis
trict committee.
32 SCHOLARSHIPS
The states are grouped in eight
districts of six states each. Each dis
trict thus meets twelve candidates,
four of which are selected for the
scholarship awards. There are 32
scholarships available in the nation.
A Rhodes Scholarship entitles the
holder to a maximum of three years
residence at Oxford with an income
of 400 pounds annually. He must be
in residence at least two of the
three years, and he must take a de
gree. If he so desires, however, the
Scholar may spend the third year of
his award anywhere he wishes.
A student is eligible for considera
tion as soon as he becomes a junior.
While seniors are more likely to re
ceive the awards, the University
committee wishes to interview all
prospective juniors, according to Dr.
Buck. Only unmarried men stu
dents are acceptable.
SELECTION BASIS
The Rhodes selections are made
on a basis of good scholarship, a
liking for athletics, though a candi
date need not be a letterman in any
.sport, and a record in extra-curricu
lar activities.
Final choice from the University
will be announced October 26. The
state committee has set November 5
as the deadline when all credentials
from universities must be in, and
will meet December 13. Names will
be sent to the district committee,
which will meet for final selection
December 16, and the scholars will
be announced the same day.
No scholars were selected last
year from Stanford candidates, but
three were included in state nomi
nations to districts.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS
Dr. George S. Parkes, professor
of chemistry, is also a member of the
committee, and there is one vacancy.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of
the University, will announce his
appointment to fill the vacancy
shortly. Dr. Donald Milton Erb, as
sociate professor of economics, was
the third member, but has left the
University.
