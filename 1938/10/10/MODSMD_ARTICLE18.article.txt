# Chief Urges Precautions Against Fire
## Prevention Week Begins; School Crew Holds Practice Drill 
### 
Anticipating Fire Prevention
Week, which starts today, Chief
Robert E. Dugan yesterday asked
for additional precaution on the
campus and put his student crew
through the year's first big equip
ment drill.
Although Stanford has had no
major fires recently, Chief Dugan
attx - ibuted this mainly to the large
number of persons on the campus—
so many that fires are usually re
ported promptly. He stressed the
need, however, for removal of cer
tain existing hazards.

Since most of the alarms come in
by telephone, much confusion is
caused by failure to give more than
the name of a fraternity house.
"We don't care about the name of
the house," the chief declared.
"Many of them sound alike, so we
have to split our equipment and
send some to each place in case of
a mixup. What we want is the street
and address."
DON'T PIIONE ALARMS
Pointing out that telephoning is
not the best method of turning in an
alarm, he said he would be satisfied
when people had become "fire con
scious to the point of learning where
their nearest box is located and
staying there after pulling it until
the engines come."
Another suggestion the chief has
for Stanford—this for its women in
particular—is that they save fewer
cardboard boxes. They are always
saving old wrapping paper and
boxes, he says, and storing them
away, and then using only one out
of ten.
"Rooms and closets that are lit
tered with old papers constitute the
greatest cause of fixes at Stanford,"
he said.
STUDENTS CROWD STREETS
Stressing the necessity of reaching
a fire in a hurry, the chief said that
delay is often caused by students
who crowd the narrow streets as
they try to beat the fire engines.
"In fighting a fire, the first two
minutes are everything," he said.
"There is no fire except an explosive
fire that can't be put out with a
bucket of water just after it starts."
Stanford's fire department is
unique, it was learned, in that it is
the only one in the United States
that is owned and operated by the
university itself.
Yesterday's two - hour building
scaling drill took place on the wall
of the four-story imitation house at
the back of the fire house. After
using pompier ladders, hooked scal
ing-ladders, to climb to the top,
the firemen practiced sliding down
a rope to a safety net below.
DRILLS HELD SUNDAYS
A drill of some sort is held every
Sunday, according to Chief Dugan.
Most frequent is practice in laying
and conecting hose lines, since this
procedure is the one most often
called into use in fighting actual
fires.
Pompier ladders, those having a
single upright supporting the rungs
at their middles, arc used only in
scaling buildings to points higher
than ordinary ladders can reach, the
chief explained.
"We don't expect to use this meth
od very soon," he said, "because
most of the campus buildings are
only two or three stories high."
