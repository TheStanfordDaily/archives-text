# Little Red Roller Lightly Slaps Cougar Eleven
## 8-0 Victory Gives Team Confidence; Pool Stars at New Guard Position 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Stanford won a football game Saturday and thus pulled themselves
out of a gridiron rut into which they had skidded way back in the 1!>:;7
Big Game.
Until the sccond half Saturday the Indians had lost to California, tied
Columbia, lost to Santa Clara, and come within an iota of handing their
first 1938 conference game to Washington State. As it was Tiny Thornhill

■must have spoken fiery words at
the intermission because the Cards
came back with an offensive in the
last half to leave the Cougars in the
lurch, 8-0.
But the victory was over a twice
defeated aggregation which prac
tically gave the game away with
wobbly ball-handling and inability
to cash in on scoring opportunities.
All the Indians can think about now
is the University of Oregon squad,
which has already won two confer
ence tussles under their new coach,
Tex Oliver. The Oregon boys beat
the same Washington State crew
three weeks ago and upset U.C.L.A.
a week later. The Indian-Webfoot,
game here this Saturday will show
definitely whether Thornhill's re
vamped outfit is ready for first-rate
competition.
COUGARS NEARLY SCORE
The Cougars nearly scored in the
first two minutes when Pete Fay
mishandled two punts to give them
possession on the Indian four-yard
marker. But the Cougars didn't
have a back who could make the
distance and lost the ball. Three
times before the half was up they
tried straight shots at a field goal
and three times they missed.
All the while the Indians were
having difficulty getting from back
of their own goal line. They didn't
make a first down in the entire half,
while the Cougars made six. Cecil
Welchko dropped a sure 40-yard
touchdown pass from little Paul Cal
low in the second quarter. The Cou
gars were making the yards but they
couldn't hit pay dirt.
Late in the second quarter,
Thornhill sent in Hampton Pool for
Pete Zagar at guard and moved Pete
back to his old left tackle spot. Well,
Pete acted at home for the first time
all season and proceeded to raise
havoc in the Washington State back«-
field all afternoon.
When Bill Willard was forced out
at left end with a cut eye, Sopho
more Stan Graff went in. The trio
of Graff, Zagar, and Pool worked
beautifully on both offense and de
fense, especially in the third period.
POOL STARS
It was Pool's first game at guard
and the big ex-halfback was in on
nearly every play. When they did
ride him out it usually took two
linemen and a back to turn the
trick.
Pete Fay regained his composure
at the start of the second half and
led the Indians to their initial pair
of first downs in less than a minute
of play. The attack slowed down but
Callow fumbled on his own 10 and
Graff recovered.
Freddie Ledeboer, again the best
| back on the field, made four yards
in two cracks, and Fay outran
| .Johnny Klumb at left end to score
just inside the flag.
I With Hugh Gallarneau and Lede
| boer ripping off the yards, Stanford
j threatened often after that only to
j lose their advantage at close range.
! Gallarneau caught one of Ledeboer's
tosses a scant foot out of the end
zone to nullify one touchdown.
When Washington State did get
possession again, Zagar promptly
eased through to block a Callow
punt which bounced out of the end
I zone for an automatic safety.
That was all the scoring, but the
Cougars couldn't move despite the
fine running and passing of Callow.
They lost Cecil Welchko with a se
vere back injury, and he was sup
posed to be the spark-plug of their
whole attack.
The work of their tackles, Farman
and Hubert, was particularly out
standing, while Johnny Klumb show
ed that he can make the grade as an
all-Coast end. Their line was big
and fast. What they lacked was a
threat other than Callow in the
I backfield.
To get back to the Indians, the
price palm must go to Tony Calvelli,
| who once again played himself into
i utter exhaustion before Thornhill
; pulled him out of the ilne-up. Cal

velli made more than GO per cent of
Stanford's defensive plays in the
first half.
Zagar was as good Saturday as he
was bad against aSnta Clara. Bill '
Paulman was punting beautifully as '
he backed the Cougars up every
time they came within scoring dis- |
tanee. Andy Stojkovich put on an- .
other first-class exhibition of how
to play right end, and Hugh Gallar
neau looked strong at left half.
For the second time in two weeks,
Stanford got off to a bad start, i
Against Santa Clara they never had
a chance to come back. The Cougars
were more liberal. What Oregon will
do in such a situation remains to be
seen.
