be activity talks in Roble tonight by
women campus leaders.
Mary Sladen, vice-president of
Women's Conference and co-chair
man in charge of the files with Harry
'Horton, has signed 11 women to talk
to freshmen after the regular corri
dor meetings.
One woman will meet with each
corridor and outline campus activi
ties, telling frosh how they are or
ganized and how best to go about
getting into them.
EXPLAIN PUBLICATIONS
Set-up ,of campus publications,
The Daily, Quad, and Chaparral

learn how to try out for jobs on
their editorial and business staffs.
Roble women will learn about the
organization of Ex Committee and
A.S.S.U., with sidelights on the best
way to get into campus politics.
Stanford dramatics and Stagers will
also be discussed, as will Rally Com
mittee and Cardinals.
WILL FILE CARDS
Activity cards will then be given
sponsors to fill out for their fresh
men. These will later be put in the
(ile. Freshmen will get in on cam
pus gravy on the basis of their in
terests and the recommendation of
ihe interviewer.
Women leaders who will go to
Roble include Gretchen Ahlswede,
chairman of Women's Council, Ro
vena Conn, president of Lagunita
Court and member of Cardinals,
Betty Davis, A.S.S.U. vice-presi
dent, Barbara Goodrich, vice-presi
dent of Lagunita and vice-president

CARDS INNOVATION
Others who will explain the ac
tivities to frosh are Ruth Reynolds,
Conference secretary; Mary Sladen,
vice-president of Conference and
president of Cap and Gown; Anne
Townsend, secretary of Lagunita;

Coline Upshaw; Virginia Valentine,
on W.A.A. board; and Didi Vibert,
women's head of Rally Committee.
Growing out of the feeling that
activities should be more evenly dis
tributed and that there should be
some definite means of getting the
right people for jobs, the card files
are an innovation at Stanford, being
used for the first time this quarter.
The idea was partly a result of dis
cussion at Leadership Institute
spring quarter and was approved by
Ex Committee before the end of
the year.
