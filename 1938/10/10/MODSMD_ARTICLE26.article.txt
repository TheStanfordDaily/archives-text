# Schedule Change Deadline Fixed
## 
### 
Deadline for student schedule
changes without fine is set for five
o'clock, Tuesday, October 11. After
that time, petitions must be sent to
the Registration Committee with the
following fines for program revi
sions: $2 for each course added or
dropped, or $3 where a course is
substituted for another.
All program changes which are to
be made since registration should be
filed at the Registrar's office on the
regular revised study-list cards. All
students will be held responsible for
their courses and units as they ap
pear on their official study lists.
There will be no credit given for
courses which do not appear there
on. This applies to Physical Educa
tion as well as to academic subjects.
