## 
### 
VIENNA, Oct. 9 (UP). â€”Theodore Cardinal Innitzer, Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Vienna, was protected by a strong bodyguard of Nazi
police tonight in his partially-wrecked palace where an anti-Catholic
mob attempted to lynch him and his priests Saturday night.
Outside the palace police scattered angry Nazi youths who surged
across; historic St. Stephen's Square demanding the arrest of the Cardinal

and his imprisonment in the noto-<
rious Dachau concentration camp.
German authorities promised pros
ecution of the "irresponsible rab
ble" who stormed the palace last
night and seriously injured two
priests by tossing them from win
dows while a screaming mob of 5,000
gathered in the square threatening
Innitzer's life.
One of the injured priests, Father
Johann Krawanik, 60, was reported
in critical condition tonight in a
hospital where he lies with both legs
broken.
Tonight's demonstration was
started by uniformed members of
the "Hitler youth" and was taken
over by a wilder band of youths in
civilian clothes.
An offiical German spokesman
said that Innitzer was not under
custody and that the police sur
rounding him in the palace were
there only to protect him, the pal
ace, and to preserve order.
Other police, it was understood,
began an inventory of Saturday
night's destruction to the palace.
CONGREGATION WEEPS
square started soon after the eve-
A placard posted at the cathedral's
main entrance, announcing the
Cardinal would speak Thursday at
the last of a series of five bible
study hours, revealed that he was
not under "house arrest."
Nevertheless he was under guard
when he went from the palace to
the cathedral, across the square that
was the scene of Saturday night's
disorder, to celebrate mass. Efforts
to communicate with him at the
palace were unavailing.
Tonight's demonstration in the
square started son after the eve
ning service.
Today's 10 o'clock mass at St. Ste
phen s was one of the most touching
scenes of Innitzer's priestly career
and many in the large congregation
wept. One of the participating
priests fainted and was carried
from the church.
The only reference to the Nazis
in the 10 o'clock service at the ca
thedral was a circular letter issued by
the Cardinal, read from all Vienna
Catholic churches, appealing to
parents to compel their children to
attend religious education schools
which, under a new Nazi decree,
are "non-compulsory."
Forest lands in this country now
total 615,000,000 acres, almost one
third the continental United States.
Of these, nearly 30 per cent are
publicly owned.
