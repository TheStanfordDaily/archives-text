# Doodles Weaver Haunts Robleites
## 
### 
"Doodles" Weaver is hang
ing around Stanford again. He
came north for the Washington
State game, and has been here
ever since.
Instead of the Beta house
and the Philosophy Building, it
is Roblc where he has been
spending his time, leading 50
to 100 frosh women every night
in singing "Nuts to Cal" and
his other songs, known well to
upper'classmen.
Sitting almost continuously
at the piano in the Roble lob
by, the "mad monk of Stan
ford" has been delaying meals
and abolishing study hours al
together.
Weaver, who was graduated
two years ago, left last night
for Hollywood, it was reported.
He is scheduled to return again
to help put over this year's Big
Game Rallv.
