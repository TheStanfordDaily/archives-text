# Glee Club to Sing Big Game Night
## 
### 
Again this year the Men's Glee
Club will sing at the Palace Hotel
on Big Game Night, according to
George Knowles, director of the
Glee Club.
For the past seven years it has
been a tradition for Stanford Club
to sing with the Californians during
the regular intermission. Mr.
Knowles also added that the new
frosh would, in all probability, sing
with the club at this time.
The rest of the schedule for the
Men's Glee Club this year includes
the Mother's Club "Fall Festival" on
November 16, the Big Game Gaie
ties, and an operetta to be given in
the spring.
