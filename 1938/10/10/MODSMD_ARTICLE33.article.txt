# Yanks Kill Cubs In Fourth Game To Take Series
## New York Wins Third Year in Succession As Crosetti Shines 
### 
YANKEE STADIUM. New York,
Oct. 9 (UP). —Hail to the mightiest
team in baseball annals, the New
York Yankees, who crushed the j
Chicago Cubs today for the fourth
straight time, N-3, and became the
first club ever to capture three con
secutive world's championships.
Where John J. McGraw and Con
nie Mack, two of baseball's greatest
strategists, failed in the quest of
three in a row, Joseph Vincent Mc-
Carthy, who never played a game
of major league baseball, succeeded
in leading the Yanks to a goal never '
before attained in 35 years of i
World Series play.

With little Frankie Crosetti, the
dark-eyed Italian from San Fran
cisco's North Beach again playing
the hero's role before a throng of;
59,847 persons, the Yanks butchered
the Cubs in a game which shifted
swiftly from a tense, hard-fought
battle into a rout at the finish.
Ted Ruffing, once a soft coal miner
in southern Illinois, bridged the gap
over which no other team has ever j
passed when he hurled his second
victory of the series.
Manager Gabby Hartnett, who
benched himself in an effort to break j
the spell of Cubs' defeat, used every j
resource at his command in a des
perate bid to salvage something
from the maddening series. He
poured 17 Cub players into the
game, using six of the eight pitchers i
on his staff in an effort to head off !
the Yankees.
O'DEAY BLASTS HOMER
The last Cub spurt really proved
their death warrant. When Ken
O'Deay, young Cub catcher who!
wore the harness of Gabby Hartnett !
today, blasted a home run into the I
right field stands, sending Phil Cava- '
rretta home ahead of him and cut
ting the Yankee lead to 4-3, he
touched off the spark that produced
the final flare of Yankee glory.
With one down in the eighth, Joe
DiMaggio, who had gone hitless in
his first three trips to the plate, rifled
a single into left. Lou Gehrig, who
hadn't driven the ball out of the in
field in his first three appearances,
followed with a line single into
right.
It is estimated that 3000 persons
are employed in ' the rose-growing (
industry in England.

YANKEE STADIUM. New York,
Oct. 9 (UP). —Hail to the mightiest
team in baseball annals, the New
York Yankees, who crushed the j
Chicago Cubs today for the fourth
straight time, N-3, and became the
first club ever to capture three con
secutive world's championships.
Where John J. McGraw and Con
nie Mack, two of baseball's greatest
strategists, failed in the quest of
three in a row, Joseph Vincent Mc-
Carthy, who never played a game
of major league baseball, succeeded
in leading the Yanks to a goal never '
before attained in 35 years of i
World Series play.
59,847 WATCH
With little Frankie Crosetti, the
dark-eyed Italian from San Fran
cisco's North Beach again playing
the hero's role before a throng of;
59,847 persons, the Yanks butchered
the Cubs in a game which shifted
swiftly from a tense, hard-fought
battle into a rout at the finish.
Ted Ruffing, once a soft coal miner
in southern Illinois, bridged the gap
over which no other team has ever j
passed when he hurled his second
victory of the series.
Manager Gabby Hartnett, who
benched himself in an effort to break j
the spell of Cubs' defeat, used every j
resource at his command in a des
perate bid to salvage something
from the maddening series. He
poured 17 Cub players into the
game, using six of the eight pitchers i
on his staff in an effort to head off !
the Yankees.
O'DEAY BLASTS HOMER
The last Cub spurt really proved
their death warrant. When Ken
O'Deay, young Cub catcher who!
wore the harness of Gabby Hartnett !
today, blasted a home run into the I
right field stands, sending Phil Cava- '
rretta home ahead of him and cut
ting the Yankee lead to 4-3, he
touched off the spark that produced
the final flare of Yankee glory.
With one down in the eighth, Joe
DiMaggio, who had gone hitless in
his first three trips to the plate, rifled
a single into left. Lou Gehrig, who
hadn't driven the ball out of the in
field in his first three appearances,
followed with a line single into
right.
It is estimated that 3000 persons
are employed in ' the rose-growing (
industry in England.
