# Papooses Swamp Troy in Second Win
## Albert Leads Frosh Gridders To Victory Trobabes Subdued By Locals in Aerial Bombardment, 22-6 
### JERRY MAYER 
Behind the brilliant pitching arm
of Frankie Albert, the Stanford
Papooses swept to a ridiculously
easy 22-6 victory over the U.S.C.
Trobabes last Saturday in the Sta
dium. No, my friends, this isn't a
baseball story, but just the same last
week-end's game had all the aspects
of a horeehide contest, with Albert
chucking strikes to all corners of the
field, a la Lefty Gomez.
Frankie figured in every Card
scoring play, throwing three touch
down passes, besides adding four
points with his kicking foot on a
field goal and a conversion.
S.C. PASSES WEAK
The Cards might have been able
to run the ball to touchdowns, but
the S.C. pass defense was so weak
that signal-caller Albert took to the
air early, and stayed there all day.
Coach Julie Bescos' Trobabes were
up in the air, too, and as the Pap
oose aerials connected with amazing
regularity, the higher they went.
However, you can't say that the
Trobabes weren't smart. After fu
tilely pushing at the Stanford line
all afternoon, they finally got the
idea that maybe it was easier to
score with your arm instead of your
feet. So a series of long prayer pass
es finally gave S.C. its score late
in the final quarter. It was their
only scoring chance of the day, in
cidentally.
Stanford's yearlings broke into
the touchdown column early in the
initial quarter after an exchange of
punts put them on their own 47. In
one play, the brilliant Albert
romped to a first down on S.C.'s 31,
and on the very next play whipped
Pete Kmetovic a six-yard pass,
which the latter took on the 25 and
carried to the promised land.
ALBERT'S QUICK KICK
A SX-yard quick kick by Albert
in the second quarter set the stage
for the Papoose's second score. From
his own 35, Albert kicked out on the
Trobabes 7. A brilliant boot from
behind his own goal line by Bill
Savoy, S.C. punter, put Stanford
back on the 35 once more, but then
Albert started winging strikes
again. The first was to Kmetovic,
and the play gained 26 yards to
S.C.'s 39-yard line. Quick like a
mouse Albert chucked one to John
Sturgeon and the ball was on the 18,
first down.
Two line plays made two yards,
another pass to Sturgeon made
seven, and Kmetovic made it a first
down on the 8. Three times the
Papooses bucked the weighty S. C.
line for a net yardage gain of zero
plus. So Albert dropped back to the
15 and left-footed three points
through the uprights, to give the
Shipkeymen a 9-0 lead at half time
If the Trojan youngstei's thought
they saw some passing the first half,
I wonder what they thought the sec
ond period, when there were so many
footballs in the air it looked like a
hog show.
FIVE-PLAYS PUSH
Starting from exact midfield, the
Papooses made their distance in five
plays, three of them strikes by
Pitcher Albert. First Albert scooted
II yards, then grooved two straight
passes, the first to Sturgeon and the
second to Kmetovic, putting the ball
on the S.C. 15. Little Frankie then
went over a hole at right tackle for
three, setting the stage for the touch
down pass.
Taking the pass from center, Al
bert ran to his right, and then flip
ped a pass to Sturgeon, who grabbed
the ball on the 5 and just did man
age to dive over in the corner. The
difficult part of the play is that Al
bert is left-handed and it isn't an
easy matter for an ordinary left
hander, but Albert isn't ordinary.
By the way, he converted after the
touchdown for his fourth point.

FIVE-PLAYS PUSH
Starting from exact midfield, the
Papooses made their distance in five
plays, three of them strikes by
Pitcher Albert. First Albert scooted
II yards, then grooved two straight
passes, the first to Sturgeon and the
second to Kmetovic, putting the ball
on the S.C. 15. Little Frankie then
went over a hole at right tackle for
three, setting the stage for the touch
down pass.
Taking the pass from center, Al
bert ran to his right, and then flip
ped a pass to Sturgeon, who grabbed
the ball on the 5 and just did man
age to dive over in the corner. The
difficult part of the play is that Al
bert is left-handed and it isn't an
easy matter for an ordinary left
hander, but Albert isn't ordinary.
By the way, he converted after the
touchdown for his fourth point.
Before the customers were back
Behind the brilliant pitching arm
of Frankie Albert, the Stanford
Papooses swept to a ridiculously
easy 22-6 victory over the U.S.C.
Trobabes last Saturday in the Sta
dium. No, my friends, this isn't a
baseball story, but just the same last
week-end's game had all the aspects
of a horeehide contest, with Albert
chucking strikes to all corners of the
field, a la Lefty Gomez.
Frankie figured in every Card
scoring play, throwing three touch
down passes, besides adding four
points with his kicking foot on a
field goal and a conversion.
S.C. PASSES WEAK
The Cards might have been able
to run the ball to touchdowns, but
the S.C. pass defense was so weak
that signal-caller Albert took to the
air early, and stayed there all day.
Coach Julie Bescos' Trobabes were
up in the air, too, and as the Pap
oose aerials connected with amazing
regularity, the higher they went.
However, you can't say that the
Trobabes weren't smart. After fu
tilely pushing at the Stanford line
all afternoon, they finally got the
idea that maybe it was easier to
score with your arm instead of your
feet. So a series of long prayer pass
es finally gave S.C. its score late
in the final quarter. It was their
only scoring chance of the day, in
cidentally.
Stanford's yearlings broke into
the touchdown column early in the
initial quarter after an exchange of
punts put them on their own 47. In
one play, the brilliant Albert
romped to a first down on S.C.'s 31,
and on the very next play whipped
Pete Kmetovic a six-yard pass,
which the latter took on the 25 and
carried to the promised land.
ALBERT'S QUICK KICK
A SX-yard quick kick by Albert
in the second quarter set the stage
for the Papoose's second score. From
his own 35, Albert kicked out on the
Trobabes 7. A brilliant boot from
behind his own goal line by Bill
Savoy, S.C. punter, put Stanford
back on the 35 once more, but then
Albert started winging strikes
again. The first was to Kmetovic,
and the play gained 26 yards to
S.C.'s 39-yard line. Quick like a
mouse Albert chucked one to John
Sturgeon and the ball was on the 18,
first down.
Two line plays made two yards,
another pass to Sturgeon made
seven, and Kmetovic made it a first
down on the 8. Three times the
Papooses bucked the weighty S. C.
line for a net yardage gain of zero
plus. So Albert dropped back to the
15 and left-footed three points
through the uprights, to give the
Shipkeymen a 9-0 lead at half time
If the Trojan youngstei's thought
they saw some passing the first half,
I wonder what they thought the sec
ond period, when there were so many
footballs in the air it looked like a
hog show.

and the play gained 26 yards to
S.C.'s 39-yard line. Quick like a
mouse Albert chucked one to John
Sturgeon and the ball was on the 18,
first down.
Two line plays made two yards,
another pass to Sturgeon made
seven, and Kmetovic made it a first
down on the 8. Three times the
Papooses bucked the weighty S. C.
line for a net yardage gain of zero
plus. So Albert dropped back to the
15 and left-footed three points
through the uprights, to give the
Shipkeymen a 9-0 lead at half time
If the Trojan youngstei's thought
they saw some passing the first half,
I wonder what they thought the sec
ond period, when there were so many
footballs in the air it looked like a
hog show.
FIVE-PLAYS PUSH
Starting from exact midfield, the
Papooses made their distance in five
plays, three of them strikes by
Pitcher Albert. First Albert scooted
II yards, then grooved two straight
passes, the first to Sturgeon and the
second to Kmetovic, putting the ball
on the S.C. 15. Little Frankie then
went over a hole at right tackle for
three, setting the stage for the touch
down pass.
Taking the pass from center, Al
bert ran to his right, and then flip
ped a pass to Sturgeon, who grabbed
the ball on the 5 and just did man
age to dive over in the corner. The
difficult part of the play is that Al
bert is left-handed and it isn't an
easy matter for an ordinary left
hander, but Albert isn't ordinary.
By the way, he converted after the
touchdown for his fourth point.
