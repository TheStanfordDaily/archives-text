BERKELEY, Oct. 9 (UP). —J.
Donald Budge, world's tennis cham
pion competing in what is expected
to be his last tournament as an ama
teur, was knocked out of the Pacific
Coast tennis championships today
by Harry Hopman, coach and non
playing captain of the Australian
Davis Cup team, 6-2, 5-7, 6-1.
Michelangelo, Leonardo da
Vinci, Hans Holbein, Raphael, Ber
tillon, Prof. Edward S. Morse, and
President James A. Garfield were
among the famous "southpaws" out
side of sport circles.
in their seats Stanford had another
score. Following the kick-off,
Kmetovic intercepted S.C.'s first
down pass on his own 40 and re
turned it to the southerners' 32. On
the first play, Albert again ran to
his right, then stopped, whirled, and
threw a perfect strike diagonally
across the Trojan secondary to Jack
Francis, who nabbed the ball on the
20 and coasted to the end zone.
S.C. 'GETS IDEA'
At this point, S.C. finally got the
idea that maybe this passing was a
pretty good idea, and a sub half
named Bud Cleghort? began to un
wind with very good effectiveness.
From the 6-yard line, where the ball
had gotten on passes, Johnston, Tro
babe quarterback, sneaked through
guard for the Trojan touchdown.
The Papooses had two casualties
in John Sturgeon, star blocking and
pass-catching right half, and Paul
Blanton, sub half. Both were carted
off the field on stretchers and are
in the Paly hospital at present.
However, neither is seriously hurt.
