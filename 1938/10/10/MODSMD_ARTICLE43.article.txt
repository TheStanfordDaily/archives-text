# Time to Adjust
## 
### 
THOUGH some cynics are already citing chap
ter and verse, it is not true that during next
year's open house the Row will set up con
cessions along Lasuen, hire barkers, and sell
chances on a free year's housebill donated by
Interfraternity Council. This rumor is logical,
but quite false.
Neither is it true that the Row will stop talk
ing about Encina, the old days, and the glories
that were. It has tried awfully hard this week
end to keep the bad name off its otherwise
unsullied lips, but to no avail. It just can't be
done, and there's no use trying, particularly
when administrative ukases make it such a sure
fire topic of conversation.
What the Row will do, one hopes, is make
open house a permanent feature of its rushing
program. Despite the fact that it ran just a little
too long this time, it served its purpose admir
ably. It acquainted the frosh with the Row, the
Row with the frosh, and opened rushing on a
note of informality which should make that
wearisome process a little less of a strain than
it has been in former years.
All that remains for Interfraternity Council to
do now is readjust the length of the period so
that it conforms more nearly with rushee inter
est and Row endurance. If it could run from
noon to midnight Friday, perhaps, instead of
from 7:30 to midnight on Friday and Saturday,
frosh would have to devote only one night of
their weekend to it, and members would be
saved the fatal Saturday night lull which hit
most houses on the Row.
An innovation which more than lived up to
expectations, open house needs only stream
lining to make it completely efficient.â€”A. S. D.
