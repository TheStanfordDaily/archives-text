# Let Gaieties Reign
## 
### 
WHEN tryouts begin this afternoon, the 1938
Big Game Gaieties will start the compli
cated process of growing from bedlam to co
herency, from ham to chocolate cake.
It's a tough process; sometimes the results are
hardly worth the effort. But plans leaking out
concerning this year's show suggest that the '38
Gaieties may pull out of the groove.
For once, the director tells us, the show is
going to be tied in with the revels of the follow
ing day. As he says, "After all, this is the Big
Game Gaieties."
And secondly, the rumor is afoot that there
actually will be some integration in the show,
rather than the hodge-podge of good and bad
which usually make up Gaieties.
There is only one thing lacking—general
campus interest. The Gaieties should not be
handled completely by the dramatics crew al
ready in the saddle. Nor does that crew want
the entire job. When it issues a call for talent,
their cry is not just lung exercise.
Stanford's Gaieties should and could rate with
the big college shows of the East. But if Memo
rial Hall isn't packed with budding stars this
afternoon, there goes your chance for a better
than-'average show.
Big Game day may be bad enough as it is.
But with an ordinary show the night before—
whew.
