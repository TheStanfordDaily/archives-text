# Scalping Scalpers
## 
### 
AN attempt is made in this morning's Campus
Opinion to justify a "so-called scalper's"
actions in buying rooters' tickets for students
who would lend him their names and student
body cards to buy regular admission seats to
the Cal football game.
What that person has done, however, is nei
ther to justify nor clarify his stand on the
matter.
In one of his five points he says, "The 143
tickets were not purchased for resale, but for
distribution to a wholesaler's customers." And
in the next point he claims, "My personal gain
enables me to repay a tuition note to the Uni
versity, of which I have three outstanding."
According to The Daily's view, these state
ments are not exactly in agreement, and if per
sonal gain is not the primary element in almost
anyone's definition of "scalper," then America's
slang dictionary needs much revision.
Stanford's graduate of '37 also tries to mini

mize his actions and at the same time approve
them by pointing out that the "deal enabled 38
students to obtain a free ticket to the game."
In other words, we have a philanthropist in our
midst.
True, only 143 tickets were obtained under
this particular deal, but when only one outside
agency can secure that many tickets at a crack
the problem becomes especially serious. It is
in a general line with the series of incidents
which put two San Francisco men into the hands
of the Palo Alto police at the request of the
University, because they were at the stadium
will-call office, spuriously claiming reservations
made by private individuals.
It would appear, then, that this sort of activity
is on a big scale, and while the 143 tickets in
volved in this particular incident may not appear
as any huge quantity, it is most certainly an
indication of bigger things to come.
As to the matter of tuition notes, while the
scheme concocted by this Stanford graduate
may be entirely ethical as far as the letter of
the law goes, it's nice to think that profits made
at the expense of the University are to be used
to repay a debt owed to the University.
Whether it is more pertinent to inquire into
the three-way agreement among Stanford, U.C.
and U.S.C. concerning payment for rooters' tick
ets, is an entirely different matter and is one
which The Daily will investigate if and when it
feels such an investigation is necessary. The
matter, however, has been satisfactorily ex
plained by B.A.C. officials in the past. No doubt
they would be willing to reiterate that explana
tion at any time.
The crowning blow of this letter, however, is
in the last paragraph. At least the author knows
a good punch line when he sees it —in this par
ticular case, to gripe about the quality of seats
he was able to purchase. Because the seats are
only on the 15-yard line, the assumption can
only be that Stanford will have to await another
football season for repayment of those three
tuition notes.
It's a shame that we are unable to inform our
philanthropist where the 35- and 40-yard-line
seats have disappeared. It is known, however,
that some of them went to students. As to the
others, it can only be suggested that the author
check with some of his competitors.
Maybe, as he says, this whole affair does re
semble chasing butterflies, but by the B.A.C.'s
beetled brows, they're damn big tones. —H. L. S.

ments are not exactly in agreement, and if per
sonal gain is not the primary element in almost
anyone's definition of "scalper," then America's
slang dictionary needs much revision.
Stanford's graduate of '37 also tries to mini

mize his actions and at the same time approve
them by pointing out that the "deal enabled 38
students to obtain a free ticket to the game."
In other words, we have a philanthropist in our
midst.
True, only 143 tickets were obtained under
this particular deal, but when only one outside
agency can secure that many tickets at a crack
the problem becomes especially serious. It is
in a general line with the series of incidents
which put two San Francisco men into the hands
of the Palo Alto police at the request of the
University, because they were at the stadium
will-call office, spuriously claiming reservations
made by private individuals.
It would appear, then, that this sort of activity
is on a big scale, and while the 143 tickets in
volved in this particular incident may not appear
as any huge quantity, it is most certainly an
indication of bigger things to come.
As to the matter of tuition notes, while the
scheme concocted by this Stanford graduate
may be entirely ethical as far as the letter of
the law goes, it's nice to think that profits made
at the expense of the University are to be used
to repay a debt owed to the University.
Whether it is more pertinent to inquire into
the three-way agreement among Stanford, U.C.
and U.S.C. concerning payment for rooters' tick
ets, is an entirely different matter and is one
which The Daily will investigate if and when it
feels such an investigation is necessary. The
matter, however, has been satisfactorily ex
plained by B.A.C. officials in the past. No doubt
they would be willing to reiterate that explana
tion at any time.
The crowning blow of this letter, however, is
in the last paragraph. At least the author knows
a good punch line when he sees it —in this par
ticular case, to gripe about the quality of seats
he was able to purchase. Because the seats are
only on the 15-yard line, the assumption can
only be that Stanford will have to await another
football season for repayment of those three
tuition notes.
It's a shame that we are unable to inform our
philanthropist where the 35- and 40-yard-line
seats have disappeared. It is known, however,
that some of them went to students. As to the
others, it can only be suggested that the author
check with some of his competitors.
Maybe, as he says, this whole affair does re
semble chasing butterflies, but by the B.A.C.'s
beetled brows, they're damn big tones. —H. L. S.
AN attempt is made in this morning's Campus
Opinion to justify a "so-called scalper's"
actions in buying rooters' tickets for students
who would lend him their names and student
body cards to buy regular admission seats to
the Cal football game.
What that person has done, however, is nei
ther to justify nor clarify his stand on the
matter.
In one of his five points he says, "The 143
tickets were not purchased for resale, but for
distribution to a wholesaler's customers." And
in the next point he claims, "My personal gain
enables me to repay a tuition note to the Uni
versity, of which I have three outstanding."
