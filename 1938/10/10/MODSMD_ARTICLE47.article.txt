### JOHN COBBS 
THK GAMEY SMELL
AS I look back on last Saturday's alleged football
game, I try to bear in mind that my mood was
hardly appreciative. Unwise manoeuvering around the
buffet during the rushing of the previous evening in
cited my digestion to revolt; and a handclasp from a
freshman whose mother had been frightened by a
cotton press disabled my right arm from the elbow
down. But even when my reactions are discounted to
half their face value, three or four things remain which
cannot be permitted to escape without comment.
In line with the forgive-and-forget policy, I shall
say nothing about the team. Sports writers have cov
ered the ground adequately, and there is no need to
say any more about that petting party of a first half.
As a matter of fact, the game was only a minor irri
tant. The three features of the tragedy that put the
iron into our souls were: (1) Doodles Weaver; (2) The
Band; (3) That appalling skit between the halves.
It is difficult to fix responsibility for the trouble,
and so I am not in a position to demand anyone's head
on a pike. But at present we can blame Rally Commit
tee, and hope that more of the truth will come out
when it howls its protest.
* * * ♦
In Doodles Weaver we saw the anti-climactic shat
tering of a tradition, that happens so often when Great
Figures come back. Doodles' imitation of Roosevelt
would have been good, except that it wasn't funny.
And it was just a little shopworn for these days when
you can turn on the radio at any time and hear cither
Roosevelt or someone imitating him.
Worse than that was Doodles' pitiful attempt to
lead the axe yell. Perhaps I am hidebound, but I have
always thought of the axe yell as sacred to the Cal
and S.C. games. Even granting its appropriateness, I
can find no excuse for burlesquing it. I waited confi
dently for a lightning bolt to incinerate the offending
Doodles, and was disappointed when heaven failed to
come through.
* * * *
r | I HE BAND is best passed over with as few words as
possible; it is useless to dwell on subjects like
that. I suppose they can't help their playing. But
after all they are a Stanford band, and they might
play Stanford songs instead of moth-eaten composi
tions intended to depict the life of a Typical Indian
Also they might work out some arrangement with
the yell leader so that they wouldn't start playing in
through love, marriage, child-birth, and death,
the middle of each other.
• S» * •
Both Doodles and the Band were as tragic as any
thing Shakespeare ever conceived in a pessimistic
moment. But it was the skit between the halves that
made me wonder if Washington State hadn't bought
out Rally Committee so that it could put into effect
a clever program of sabotage.
The whole thing reminded me strongly of a pageant
my kindergarten once staged. The steam-roller that
had to be carried in. the flimsy little outhouse of a
wigwam, what we must call for lack of a better name
the "plot" of the skit—all of them bore the stamp of
unformed minds and cradle-shadowed senses of humor.
I don't want to hurt Rally Committee's feelings. It
tried hard, and probably it wasn't very pleased either.
But as with halitosis, somebody has to break the news.
Because if we have to go through it again, many of us
will not be able to stop with mere indigestion,

In Doodles Weaver we saw the anti-climactic shat
tering of a tradition, that happens so often when Great
Figures come back. Doodles' imitation of Roosevelt
would have been good, except that it wasn't funny.
And it was just a little shopworn for these days when
you can turn on the radio at any time and hear cither
Roosevelt or someone imitating him.
Worse than that was Doodles' pitiful attempt to
lead the axe yell. Perhaps I am hidebound, but I have
always thought of the axe yell as sacred to the Cal
and S.C. games. Even granting its appropriateness, I
can find no excuse for burlesquing it. I waited confi
dently for a lightning bolt to incinerate the offending
Doodles, and was disappointed when heaven failed to
come through.

r | I HE BAND is best passed over with as few words as
possible; it is useless to dwell on subjects like
that. I suppose they can't help their playing. But
after all they are a Stanford band, and they might
play Stanford songs instead of moth-eaten composi
tions intended to depict the life of a Typical Indian
Also they might work out some arrangement with
the yell leader so that they wouldn't start playing in
through love, marriage, child-birth, and death,
the middle of each other.

Both Doodles and the Band were as tragic as any
thing Shakespeare ever conceived in a pessimistic
moment. But it was the skit between the halves that
made me wonder if Washington State hadn't bought
out Rally Committee so that it could put into effect
a clever program of sabotage.
The whole thing reminded me strongly of a pageant
my kindergarten once staged. The steam-roller that
had to be carried in. the flimsy little outhouse of a
wigwam, what we must call for lack of a better name
the "plot" of the skit—all of them bore the stamp of
unformed minds and cradle-shadowed senses of humor.
I don't want to hurt Rally Committee's feelings. It
tried hard, and probably it wasn't very pleased either.
But as with halitosis, somebody has to break the news.
Because if we have to go through it again, many of us
will not be able to stop with mere indigestion,
THK GAMEY SMELL
AS I look back on last Saturday's alleged football
game, I try to bear in mind that my mood was
hardly appreciative. Unwise manoeuvering around the
buffet during the rushing of the previous evening in
cited my digestion to revolt; and a handclasp from a
freshman whose mother had been frightened by a
cotton press disabled my right arm from the elbow
down. But even when my reactions are discounted to
half their face value, three or four things remain which
cannot be permitted to escape without comment.
In line with the forgive-and-forget policy, I shall
say nothing about the team. Sports writers have cov
ered the ground adequately, and there is no need to
say any more about that petting party of a first half.
As a matter of fact, the game was only a minor irri
tant. The three features of the tragedy that put the
iron into our souls were: (1) Doodles Weaver; (2) The
Band; (3) That appalling skit between the halves.
It is difficult to fix responsibility for the trouble,
and so I am not in a position to demand anyone's head
on a pike. But at present we can blame Rally Commit
tee, and hope that more of the truth will come out
when it howls its protest.
