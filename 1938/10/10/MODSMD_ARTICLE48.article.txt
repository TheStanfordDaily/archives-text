The Editor, Sir:
The Thirty Dollar Per Week Lead
er in a recent letter to The Daily
stated that if we had been in Dream
land Pavilion the other night we
would have heard things about the
Stanford ideas on the Thirty Per
Week Plan we would not have liked.
This undoubtedly is true, for at
Stanford we do not like to see and
hear unfortunate and "economically
ignorant" people led astray and
made to think that Utopia is just
around the corner, for this can never
be brought about through wishing,
but must be accomplished through
sound reasoning and in accordance
to certain fundamental and natural
economic laws.
We "Haveocrats," as we are re
ferred to, do have something which
seems to be lacking in certain po
litical movements of our day, that
is, either sound reasoning power or
integrity of purpose.
The statement made by the author
of that article, that the masses' are
beginning to think, is obviously in
error. If they were, they would not
follow such a hare-brained idea as
he advocates.
He further says that when the
masses act "as they will act," cer
tain gentlemen, apparently the
benefactors of our University, will
experience a considerable decrease
in their salaries. He did not add
that the leaders of his movement
might expex-ience a considerable in
crease in their salaries, or at least
in power and prestige, for they are
to have practically supreme power
in this act, if it goes through.
However, when he says our sys
tem is tottering toward a fall, he
may be right, for when a large por
tion of our population "falls for"
such a scheme as he advocates,
Democracy, which is founded upon
the intelligence and reasoning
power of the people at large, is, in
deed, in a dangerous position. We
hope, however, through higher edu
cation, which he apparently spurns,
to save our system from contamina
tion, for our system has given more
"life, liberty, and happiness" to more
people than any other form of gov
ernment the world has ever known.

ferred to, do have something which
seems to be lacking in certain po
litical movements of our day, that
is, either sound reasoning power or
integrity of purpose.
The statement made by the author
of that article, that the masses' are
beginning to think, is obviously in
error. If they were, they would not
follow such a hare-brained idea as
he advocates.
He further says that when the
masses act "as they will act," cer
tain gentlemen, apparently the
benefactors of our University, will
experience a considerable decrease
in their salaries. He did not add
that the leaders of his movement
might expex-ience a considerable in
crease in their salaries, or at least
in power and prestige, for they are
to have practically supreme power
in this act, if it goes through.
However, when he says our sys
tem is tottering toward a fall, he
may be right, for when a large por
tion of our population "falls for"
such a scheme as he advocates,
Democracy, which is founded upon
the intelligence and reasoning
power of the people at large, is, in
deed, in a dangerous position. We
hope, however, through higher edu
cation, which he apparently spurns,
to save our system from contamina
tion, for our system has given more
"life, liberty, and happiness" to more
people than any other form of gov
ernment the world has ever known.
