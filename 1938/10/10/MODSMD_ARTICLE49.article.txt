# I AM INNOCENT

The Editor, Sir:
Please permit a so-called "scalper"
mentioned in your editorial column
on Otcober 4 to clarify the incident
described therein. It appears that
the following points might be pre
sented:
1. The 143 tickets were not. pur
chased for resale, but for distribu
tion to a wholesaler's customers.
2. My personal gain enables me to
repay a tuition note to the Univer
sity, of which I have three out
standing.
3. The 143 tickets obtained should
not deprive one Stanford alumnus or
one student's parents from attending
the game.
4. The deal enabled 38 students to
obtain free tickets to the game.
5. The tickets would have been
obtained at U. C. as in the past had
they not been obtained here. This
way, at least, Stanford students prof
ited by the inevitable.
It would seem more pertinent to
inquire into the three-way agree
ment among Stanford, U. C. and
U.S.C. which requires a student to
pay to attend any and all athletic
contests between or among these
three universities. This concerns
many times the number of individ
uals that the 143 tickets represent.
It involves Stanford students more
directly and more frequently.
The 143 tickets are not resold and
therefore will not be "scalped" to
Stanford adherents or anyone else.
However, the B.A.C. will continue
to "scalp" seats to the Big Game and
the U.S.C. game to the students at
$1.65 and $1.10, respectively, as long
as they can rely on student and edi
torial indilTerencc to the situation.
Also, after handling 143 tickets, I
found that the best selection offered
the students was on the 15-yard
line, and very few of them. Assum
ing that the rooting section takes all
of the tickets between the 35-yard
lines, who gets all of the tickets rep

resented by 40 yards of playing field
between the two 15- and 35-yard
lines on the Stanford side of the
field? Student classification, I be
lieve, is the third.
Who, then, occupies this choice
40-yard strip? How is it possible for
the team and coaches, trustees, and
faculty to use this huge allotment?
It would appear that The Daily edi
torialists prefer to chase butterflies,
when they might do some real "big
game" hunting.

not deprive one Stanford alumnus or
one student's parents from attending
the game.
4. The deal enabled 38 students to
obtain free tickets to the game.
5. The tickets would have been
obtained at U. C. as in the past had
they not been obtained here. This
way, at least, Stanford students prof
ited by the inevitable.
It would seem more pertinent to
inquire into the three-way agree
ment among Stanford, U. C. and
U.S.C. which requires a student to
pay to attend any and all athletic
contests between or among these
three universities. This concerns
many times the number of individ
uals that the 143 tickets represent.
It involves Stanford students more
directly and more frequently.
The 143 tickets are not resold and
therefore will not be "scalped" to
Stanford adherents or anyone else.
However, the B.A.C. will continue
to "scalp" seats to the Big Game and
the U.S.C. game to the students at
$1.65 and $1.10, respectively, as long
as they can rely on student and edi
torial indilTerencc to the situation.
Also, after handling 143 tickets, I
found that the best selection offered
the students was on the 15-yard
line, and very few of them. Assum
ing that the rooting section takes all
of the tickets between the 35-yard
lines, who gets all of the tickets rep

resented by 40 yards of playing field
between the two 15- and 35-yard
lines on the Stanford side of the
field? Student classification, I be
lieve, is the third.
Who, then, occupies this choice
40-yard strip? How is it possible for
the team and coaches, trustees, and
faculty to use this huge allotment?
It would appear that The Daily edi
torialists prefer to chase butterflies,
when they might do some real "big
game" hunting.

The Editor, Sir:
Please permit a so-called "scalper"
mentioned in your editorial column
on Otcober 4 to clarify the incident
described therein. It appears that
the following points might be pre
sented:
1. The 143 tickets were not. pur
chased for resale, but for distribu
tion to a wholesaler's customers.
2. My personal gain enables me to
repay a tuition note to the Univer
sity, of which I have three out
standing.
3. The 143 tickets obtained should
not deprive one Stanford alumnus or
one student's parents from attending
the game.
