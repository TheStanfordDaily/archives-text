# Operagoers Cheer Colorful Opening Night
## 
### 
"ANDREA CHENIER." which
opened last Friday at the War .Me
morial Opera House, San Fran
cisco.
Up San Francisco way, the pent
house truck gardeners don't pray for
rain—they just put their bulbs out
on the opening night of the opera.
Last Friday the "p.h.t.g.'s" were dis
apopinted, because "Andrea Che
nier" opened on schedule in the War
Memorial Opera House without one
trace of moisture to spoil milady's
ermine wrap, or her escort's high
silk, topper.
The opera opening was almost as
colorful as a British coronation.
Ladies, orchidaceous and bejewelled,
promenaded eager to see and to be
seen; gentlemen with decorations
from cork screws and elk's teeth to
Legion of Honor ribbons and Croix
de Guerre's swarmed about the foyer
and the bar, willing foils for their
better halves.
DRESS PARADE
San Francisco was on dress pa
rade; and her country cousin, Stan
ford, was sparsely represented, from
the Mayfair Diamond Horseshoe to
North Beach Nigger Heaven.
The women's clothes were enough
to discourage most masculine
thoughts of matrimony. However,
there were surprisingly few truly
beautiful, women, dressed in really
good taste. On a night when sim
plicity would have been the keynote
to smartness, most of the women
were over-dressed. Mink was
mex-ely monotonous.
The opera itself, Umberto Gior
dano's "Andrea Chenier" is a bril
liant and melodic interpretation of
the French Revolution, with all the
fire and brutality of its time. It
abounds in strident passages and is
enlivened by the introduction of
Revolutionary War songs.
HIGH POINTS
Rethberg, Gigli, and Bonelli were
superb. The most striking points in
the production were:
1. Gerard's (Richard Bonelli's)
monologue jn the Tribunal Cham
ber, and the subsequent duet with
Madeleine (Elisabeth Rethberg).
2. Chenier's (Beniamino Gigli's)
solos and his love duet with Made
leine (Rethberg).
The sets were lavish; the costumes
were colorfully and artistically
blended.
The orchestra, though louder than
the singers occasionally, was master
fully conducted by Gaetano Merola.
The opera was enthusiastically
cheered by a brilliant audience. A
popular performance of Andrea
Chenier will be given in the War
Memorial Opera House on Saturday,
October 15.—John Cline

enlivened by the introduction of
Revolutionary War songs.
HIGH POINTS
Rethberg, Gigli, and Bonelli were
superb. The most striking points in
the production were:
1. Gerard's (Richard Bonelli's)
monologue jn the Tribunal Cham
ber, and the subsequent duet with
Madeleine (Elisabeth Rethberg).
2. Chenier's (Beniamino Gigli's)
solos and his love duet with Made
leine (Rethberg).
The sets were lavish; the costumes
were colorfully and artistically
blended.
The orchestra, though louder than
the singers occasionally, was master
fully conducted by Gaetano Merola.
The opera was enthusiastically
cheered by a brilliant audience. A
popular performance of Andrea
Chenier will be given in the War
Memorial Opera House on Saturday,
October 15.—John Cline
"ANDREA CHENIER." which
opened last Friday at the War .Me
morial Opera House, San Fran
cisco.
Up San Francisco way, the pent
house truck gardeners don't pray for
rain—they just put their bulbs out
on the opening night of the opera.
Last Friday the "p.h.t.g.'s" were dis
apopinted, because "Andrea Che
nier" opened on schedule in the War
Memorial Opera House without one
trace of moisture to spoil milady's
ermine wrap, or her escort's high
silk, topper.
The opera opening was almost as
colorful as a British coronation.
Ladies, orchidaceous and bejewelled,
promenaded eager to see and to be
seen; gentlemen with decorations
from cork screws and elk's teeth to
Legion of Honor ribbons and Croix
de Guerre's swarmed about the foyer
and the bar, willing foils for their
better halves.
DRESS PARADE
San Francisco was on dress pa
rade; and her country cousin, Stan
ford, was sparsely represented, from
the Mayfair Diamond Horseshoe to
North Beach Nigger Heaven.
The women's clothes were enough
to discourage most masculine
thoughts of matrimony. However,
there were surprisingly few truly
beautiful, women, dressed in really
good taste. On a night when sim
plicity would have been the keynote
to smartness, most of the women
were over-dressed. Mink was
mex-ely monotonous.
The opera itself, Umberto Gior
dano's "Andrea Chenier" is a bril
liant and melodic interpretation of
the French Revolution, with all the
fire and brutality of its time. It
abounds in strident passages and is
enlivened by the introduction of
Revolutionary War songs.
