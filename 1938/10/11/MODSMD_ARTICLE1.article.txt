# Archbishop To Confer With Hitler
## Angry Nazi Mob In Anti-Catholic Riot; Vatican to Protest 
### 
VIENNA, Oct. 10 (UP).â€”Theodore
Cardinal Innitzer, Archbishop of
Vienna, tonight prepared to confer
personally with Chancellor Adolf
Hitler in Berlin as Nazi authorities
closed his cathedral and new anti-
Catholic demonstrations threatened
in historic St. Stephen's Square.
It was understood the archbishop,
who escaped injury when a yelling
mob of 5,000 stormed and partially
wrecked his palace Saturday night
shouting "Kill all priests!" might
leave for Berlin before morning.
Before conferring with Der Fueh
rer he was expected to talk with
Monsignor Cesar Orsenigo, papal
nuncio in Berlin, and other church
dignitaries.
MOB ANGERS HITLER
Hitler was described as '"greatly
annoyed" by the mob terrorism. He
sent a personal investigator to Vi
enna and ordered severe punishment
of those who organized the riots.
There were indications the in
vestigation would be conducted by
Joseph Buerckel, Reich commis
sioner for Ostmark, formerly Aus
tria.
It was understood the government
soon would make a statement re
garding the incidents of Friday, Sat
urday and Sunday nights in an effort
to allay anger and unrest among
Austrian Catholics.
Nazi loaders feared the actions of
the frenzied mob of anti-Catholics,
who tossed a crucifix, prayer books
and a painting of the Madonna into
a bonfire in St. Stephen's Square,
might touch off antagonism be
tween the church and the Nazi party.
PROTEST EXPECTED
Reliable church prelates in Vati
can City predicted the Vatican would
make a strong protest against the
Vienna demonstrations.
The protest, it was understood,
would be made through Monsignor
Cesare Orsenigo, papal nqncio to
Berlin.
The Vatican has not yet received
a report from the Berlin nunciatura.
The Osservatore official
Vatican organ in Rome, describing
the "sorrowful incident," said in a
brief editorial tonight:
"United in brotherhood with all
Catholics in Austria and every coun
try of the world, and to all honest
people, we raise our Christian and
civil protests and present to the
archbishop of Vienna our sincere
and profound condolences for the
outrages carried out against his
person and in him, against religion
and the Church of Christ."
