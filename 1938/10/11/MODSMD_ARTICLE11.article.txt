# Row Deliveries
## 
### 
Students living on the Row
are requested by Thad Mc-
Carty, circulation manager of
The Daily, to refrain from
picking up their copies of The
Daily at the Stanford Book
store every morning. House to
house delivery has been pro
vided for their convenience,
and for this service to be so
continued, papers must be left
at the bookstore for those stu
dents who live outside of the
delivery areas. Co-operation
will be appreciated, stated Mc-
Carty.
