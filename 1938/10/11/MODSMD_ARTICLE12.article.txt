# Contest Prizes Still Missing
## 
### PARK KIMBALL 
Stagers have been ready for a
week to spririg a grandiose Gaieties
Contest on the Farm, complete with
jolly prizes and everything; but be
cause two "sheep," the Ram's Head
plaque and its mate, the "U" plaque,
are still missing from the fold, Sta
gers have had nothing to offer con
testants but love—which is a drug
on the campus market.
However, with high hopes of their
immediate return from their evident
incarceration in some fraternity or
some sorority house. Stagers Presi
dent P. P. Cahn has ordained that
the contest must be nevertheless an
nounced.
MAY SUBSTITUTE AWARD
"If the d—n Ram should fail to
turn up," said Cahn sheepishly, "we
will substitute something bigger and
better and just as appropriate."
Winners in this contest will be two
campus living groups, one men's and
one women's, which in the estima
tion of the Gaieties director and his
colleagues have contributed the most
toward making the 1938 Gaieties the
Greatest Show on Earth—next to
Billy Rose's.
The contest will be great fun for
young and old (freshmen and sen
iors) alike; and Stagers would like
to say that they put the "accent on
youth"—in other words, freshmen
WELCOME.
Added prestige is to be given the
two well-known plaques. The names
of the winning houses will be en
graved thereupon and said plaques
will be hung for the year in the
Memorial Hall foyer. Stagers prom
ise that they will be well worth
working for.
CONTEST RULES
And here's how you enter the
Gaieties Contest:
I- (a) If you're a member of a
fraternity, sorority, hall, eating club,
or other bona fide campus living
group, you will be most cordially
received.
(b) But you must decide whose
side you are going to be on. You
can't saw boards for the Fiji's and
pound nails for the Dee Gees.
11. How to become a high-point
man:
(a) You will be scrutinized (not
shadowed) from time to time by
Director Cahn and his authorized
judges—in whatever capacity you
shall choose to follow, be it stage
work, -set construction, publicity
(writing, drawing posters, etc. Lots
of fun), musical arranging, manu
script copying, directing, electrician,
makeup, writing songs or skits, par
ticipation in skits or musical num
bers or any activity which in the es
timation of the judges the Gaieties
may profit by.
(b) Number of participants will
be well considered; however, adjust
ment will be made for varying sizes
of groups.
(c) No salaried Stager big-wig is
eligible. Ny-a-a-ahh, Cahn, Birn
baum, and Houser!
111. The importance of, and the
amount of work accomplished in,
such widely varying types of jobs
will be carefully weighed by the
judging board. In other words, two
well-pounded nails may be worth
one mediocre chorus of "Love in
Bloom," in the estimation of the
judges.
And now—is there any more to
say?
Oh, yes, the decision of the judges
will be final!

11. How to become a high-point
man:
(a) You will be scrutinized (not
shadowed) from time to time by
Director Cahn and his authorized
judges—in whatever capacity you
shall choose to follow, be it stage
work, -set construction, publicity
(writing, drawing posters, etc. Lots
of fun), musical arranging, manu
script copying, directing, electrician,
makeup, writing songs or skits, par
ticipation in skits or musical num
bers or any activity which in the es
timation of the judges the Gaieties
may profit by.
(b) Number of participants will
be well considered; however, adjust
ment will be made for varying sizes
of groups.
(c) No salaried Stager big-wig is
eligible. Ny-a-a-ahh, Cahn, Birn
baum, and Houser!
111. The importance of, and the
amount of work accomplished in,
such widely varying types of jobs
will be carefully weighed by the
judging board. In other words, two
well-pounded nails may be worth
one mediocre chorus of "Love in
Bloom," in the estimation of the
judges.
And now—is there any more to
say?
Oh, yes, the decision of the judges
will be final!
Stagers have been ready for a
week to spririg a grandiose Gaieties
Contest on the Farm, complete with
jolly prizes and everything; but be
cause two "sheep," the Ram's Head
plaque and its mate, the "U" plaque,
are still missing from the fold, Sta
gers have had nothing to offer con
testants but love—which is a drug
on the campus market.
However, with high hopes of their
immediate return from their evident
incarceration in some fraternity or
some sorority house. Stagers Presi
dent P. P. Cahn has ordained that
the contest must be nevertheless an
nounced.
MAY SUBSTITUTE AWARD
"If the d—n Ram should fail to
turn up," said Cahn sheepishly, "we
will substitute something bigger and
better and just as appropriate."
Winners in this contest will be two
campus living groups, one men's and
one women's, which in the estima
tion of the Gaieties director and his
colleagues have contributed the most
toward making the 1938 Gaieties the
Greatest Show on Earth—next to
Billy Rose's.
The contest will be great fun for
young and old (freshmen and sen
iors) alike; and Stagers would like
to say that they put the "accent on
youth"—in other words, freshmen
WELCOME.
Added prestige is to be given the
two well-known plaques. The names
of the winning houses will be en
graved thereupon and said plaques
will be hung for the year in the
Memorial Hall foyer. Stagers prom
ise that they will be well worth
working for.

fraternity, sorority, hall, eating club,
or other bona fide campus living
group, you will be most cordially
received.
(b) But you must decide whose

pound nails for the Dee Gees.
