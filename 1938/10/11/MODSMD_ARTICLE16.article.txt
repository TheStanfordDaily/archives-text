MOSCOW, Oct. 10 (LP). —Charges by It outstanding Soviet fliers that
Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh played a significant role during the Euro
pean war crisis by informing British officials the Soviet air force was
weak, tonight enmeshed the American aviator in a bitter international
wrangle.
Denunciation of Lindbergh in a letter to the newspaper Pravda was
based on allegations that appeared in London publications. The Ameri-

>can flier's aviation accomplishments
were derided, he was called a "fas
cist lackey" and was accused of
making his flying visit to Russia last
August "under instructions of Eng
lish reactionaries."
The sensational charges were made
as Lindbergh and his wife left Paris
by airplane for Berlin to study avia
tion production in Germany.
Several fliers who helped entertain
and honor the Lindberghs on their
summer visit here signed the letter.

"He came to Russia uninvited un
der instructions of English reaction
aries in order to testify to the
'weakness' of Soviet aviation and
| provide Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain with arguments for ca
pitulating at Munich," the letter said,
adding, "The paid liar Lindbergh
has duly performed his duties to his
bosses."
The letter described the strength
of the Russian air force—in reply to
allegations it was weak—by saying:
CLAIM SUPERIOR AIR FORCE
"According to information in the
highest quarters in London, Paris
and Prague, the Soviet air fleet is
quantitatively at least equal to the
combined German and Japanese air
forces and is qualitatively much su
perior."
The reports in London publications
I suggested Lindbergh brought back
j from Moscow a report on the Rus-
I sian air force, and a document was
produced during the war crisis at a
cabinet meeting—a document which
belittled the strength of Soviet avia
tion.
