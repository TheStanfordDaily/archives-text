# McDuffie Urges Rushing Changes
## 
### 
Bud McDuffie, president of the In
terfraternity Council, in commenting
upon the new open house rushing
period which was tried for the first
time last week-end, said, "I feel,
generally speaking, that the open
house period served the purposes
for which it was originated from the
standpoint both of the rushees and
the fraternities."
"If, however," he continued, "it is
tried again next year it should be
modified in form with the periods
being shortened from 7:30 to 10:30
o'clock, and if possible postponement
of the first period until later in the
quarter." These problems will be
studied by the rushing committee of
the Intcrfratcrnity Council.
Next Friday and Saturday the
regular rushing periods will start.
These have four periods on Friday
and three Saturday. The rushing
cards for the next rushing period
arc on sale at the Interfratcrnity
Council office and should be pur
chased immediately.
