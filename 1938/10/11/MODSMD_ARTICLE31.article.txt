# Court Refuses Action In New Mooney Plea
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 (UP). —
The Supreme Court today rejected
Thomas J. Mooney's plea for aid in
hi.s 22-year fight for freedom and
made public a long list of orders re
lating to the Wagner Labor Act,
birth control laws, and movie in
dustry and negro rights.
The court's refusal to review the
conviction and imprisonment of
Mooney for alleged participation in
the 1916 Preparedness Day bombing
in San Francisco, for which he is
serving a life sentence, topped ac
tion on a large batch of petitions
1 i led during the summer recess.
The Mooney decision appeared
virtually to end the famed convict's
chances of obtaining freedom through
the courts. The tribunal left one
avenue open, however, when it im
mediately granted his counsel per
mission to renew a three-year-old
application for an original writ of
habeas corpus.
In an unprecedented move, the
court order list which announced the
Mooney action noted Justices Hugo
L. Black and Stanley Reed had dis
sented from the majority view. Or
dinarily the position of the jurists
on a question of review is not in
dicated.
Additional significance was at
tached to the move when it was re

called on two previous* occasions
Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes
had said petitions for certiorari,
such as sought by Mooney, infre
quently are not allowed by the court
when two members "strongly" urge
such action.
In a series of orders relating to
the Wagner Act the most important
was the court's decision to hear the
Ford Motor Company's challenge of
the National Labor Relations
Board's authority to withdraw a
case from the circuit courts after
i briefs have been filed.
The N.L.R.B. last spring obtained
permission from the Sixth Circuit
Court to reopen its case of alleged
unfair labor practices at Ford's
River Rouge plant, in order to cor
rect what it feared might be re
garded as procedural defects.
The birth control decision con
sisted of the court's dismissal of an
appeal by four attaches of the
North Shore Mothers' Health Office
at Salem, Mass., from a Massachu
setts State Supreme Court opinion
upholding the state's rigid law
against sale or distribution of con
traceptives and birth control infor
mation.
There are animacules so small that
it requires 75,000,000 of them to
weigh a grain.

birth control laws, and movie in
dustry and negro rights.
The court's refusal to review the
conviction and imprisonment of
Mooney for alleged participation in
the 1916 Preparedness Day bombing
in San Francisco, for which he is
serving a life sentence, topped ac
tion on a large batch of petitions
1 i led during the summer recess.
The Mooney decision appeared
virtually to end the famed convict's
chances of obtaining freedom through
the courts. The tribunal left one
avenue open, however, when it im
mediately granted his counsel per
mission to renew a three-year-old
application for an original writ of
habeas corpus.
In an unprecedented move, the
court order list which announced the
Mooney action noted Justices Hugo
L. Black and Stanley Reed had dis
sented from the majority view. Or
dinarily the position of the jurists
on a question of review is not in
dicated.
Additional significance was at
tached to the move when it was re

called on two previous* occasions
Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes
had said petitions for certiorari,
such as sought by Mooney, infre
quently are not allowed by the court
when two members "strongly" urge
such action.
In a series of orders relating to
the Wagner Act the most important
was the court's decision to hear the
Ford Motor Company's challenge of
the National Labor Relations
Board's authority to withdraw a
case from the circuit courts after

The N.L.R.B. last spring obtained
permission from the Sixth Circuit
Court to reopen its case of alleged
unfair labor practices at Ford's
River Rouge plant, in order to cor

The birth control decision con
sisted of the court's dismissal of an
appeal by four attaches of the
North Shore Mothers' Health Office
at Salem, Mass., from a Massachu

upholding the state's rigid law
against sale or distribution of con
traceptives and birth control infor
