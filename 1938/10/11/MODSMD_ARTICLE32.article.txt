HOUSTON, Tex., Oct. 10 (UP).â€”
The American Federation of Labor
tonight called for the resignation or
ouster of C.1.0. Chieftain John L.
Lewis as the price of labor peace,
in a tumultous session during which
Daniel J. Tobin, head of the team
sters, threatened to lead his 300.000
members out of the parent body.
Only one dissenting vote was cast
against adoption of the report of
the Resolutions Committee which
said the A. F. of L. will not make
terms "with dictatorship or Com
munistic leadership," and demanded
the next move for an armistice come
from the C.1.0. The lone dissenter
was R. M. Burr, of Ann Arbor,
Mich., delegate of the local Central
Labor Council.

Tobin's union voted for the re
port although he had asked for but
failed to receive assurance new
peace conferences would be insti
tuted with the C.1.0.
Earlier the convention had voted
unanimously for the committee's re
port demanding nine far-reaching
changes in the Wagner Act and had
approved a test of strength with
President Roosevelt over the re
appointment of Donald Wakefield
Smith to the National Labor Rela
tions Board.
An immediate pardon for Thomas
J. Mooney, serving a life term in a
California prison in connection with
the San Francisco Preparedness Day
bombing, also was demanded.
