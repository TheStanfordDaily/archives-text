J JILL PAULMAN has had some
lough breaks. And his hard luck
has been Stanford's.
It was five years ago that Eill
made a name for himself as frosh
fullback against the traditional
Papoose rival, the Southern Califor
nia freshmen. In that game he threw
21 good passes out of 22 tries; he
made some long runs; and he com
pletely proved his triple-threat skill
by averaging 52 yards from scrim
mage on his punts.
Paulman's fine torses not only
made the quiet, blond freshman
star famous, but they won the
game 27-1!) and put Coach "Rab
bit" Bradshaw's "million-dollar
pass play" famous. There were five
men out to receive every (me, and
all that was necessary was a good
thrower to place the ball in the
arms of one of them. Pauhnan
was i(, and from then on, Coach
Tiny Thornhill looked forward to
a chance lo use him on what was
to become the greatest aggrega
tion that ever appeared at Stan
lord, the Vowing Sophs.
Paulman returned in his sopho
more year to help his team to its first
Rose Bowl encounter, but bad luck
came his way when he was a junior.
He was hurt twice before the season
started, once injuring his ankle se
riously enough to keep him out all
year.
His' ankle was in perfect shape
when practice opened last year, and
it looked as though Paulman was in
for a season of 60-minute games. But
he had to leave the first conference
game, against Oregon, early in the
first quarter with an injured shoul
der. From then on he was in and
out of a series of games, and finally
finished up with a serious cut on his
forehead, sustained in the Big Game.
Paulman is in his last year of
eligibility now. and he must have
been a bit disappointed when he
was injured on the first play of
the opening game. He made the
kick-off and was immediately
(loomed wtih a bad charley horse.
That one healed and last week he
got another when he was tackled.
The quiet blond is not made of
glass and he does not take unneces
sary chances. He has just had bad
luck that just doesn't seem to stop.

links seem still to be ap
pearing in the chain of offen
sive blocking on the Indian team.
And fundamentals are obviously
lacking. One week's practice sessions
should improve them enough for
Oregon and two weeks' for Southern
California.
Newly oriented guards, of course,
need more practice in their new po
sitions. Defensive guarding requires
a technique that is vastly different
from that of any other position on a
team, and there is no substitute for
experience.
Pete Zagar is used to playing
tackle and must learn to charge
lower. And incidentally, did you no
lice that Pete had new fire Satur
day? He looked better as both guard
and tackle than he has in a long
time.
Hamp Pool was under.the great
est handicap at guard. His experi
ence has been in the backfield, and
it was a big change to move to the
line. Hamp is to be especially com
mended for his willingness and en
thusiasm in making the change.

11F you're worried about the ten
yards the referee and head lines
man took from the Cards in moving
the ball before the fourth quarter
Saturday, do not think the Indian
powers did not notice it.
Ben Winkelman could see the
mistake easily from the press box,
and he told Tiny Thornhill over the
phone to the bench. Tiny was just
j deciding whether to put up a beef
! when Tony Calvelli intercepted the
Cougars' pass and regained the ten
| and some more. Now if you were
the Card coach, what would you do?

! REIGALS is a famous foot
j ball player, but Roy wasn't an
especially good one. He is the man
I who picked up the ball after a
blocked punt in the Cal-Georgia
! Tech Rose Bowl game and carried
I it the wrong way.
| Reigals and Corrigan and all the
rest of the "vice versa notables"

were remembered
at San Jose State
College last Sat
urday when a
Spartan player,
frantic after two
of his team-mates
and one opponent
had been yanked
from the pool for

wilful louls, grabbed the ball and
tossed it past the puzzled San Jose
goal guard to score for the Indians.
Stanford won, 7-4.
