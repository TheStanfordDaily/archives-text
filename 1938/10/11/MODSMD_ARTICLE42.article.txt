# Frosh Basketball Practice Started
## 
### 
Employing practice drills in long
basket shooting and set-up shots,
Stanford's 40-odd aspiring freshman
basketeers started their long grind
to perfect a winning quintet for the
frosh basketball wars of 1939.
Under the able direction of Head
Coach "Beebs" Lee, Assistant Coach
Jack Calderwood, and the added ad
vice of the varsity mentor, Everett
Dean, the frosh are holding snappy
two-hour practice sessions every
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
These practices have been evenly
divided between polishing up on
iwo-handed shots from the outside
of the foul circle and drills at set
up shots from either side of the
bucket.
