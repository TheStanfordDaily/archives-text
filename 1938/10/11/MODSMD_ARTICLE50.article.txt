## Bryant, Dean, Hack, Lee Certain of Jobs 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 10 (UP).—Charles ,
Leo (Gabby) Hartnett, who drove ,
the Chicago Cubs to the National
League pennant and then saw them !
take four straight lickings in the |
World Series, revealed to the United
Press tonight only four members of j
the team are sure of their jobs next j
year.
Shortly after he brought the Cubs i
back home from New York, the big, |
red-faced manager, bitterly disap
pointed by his team's showing, as
serted:
"There's going to be a .shake-up
on this team. You can bet on that!"
Then he named names.
WANTS A BALL CLUB
"There are ohly four guys on this
club who are sure of their jobs in
1939—Dizzy Dean, Bill Lee, Clay 1
Bryant and Stan Hack. As for the |
rest, I'll trade, sell or get rid of any j
or all of them. I want a ball cluld j
next year. That's as much as I'll tell :
you right now."
That means that only three pitch- I
ers and the third baseman, in addi- I
tion to the manager-catcher him- |
self, will be immune to the house- !
cleaning Bartnett is planning before |

the 1939 season rolls around.
It also means Captain Billy Her
man, veteran second-sacker, is
among those open to trade or sale.
Billy's name has been mentioned
frequently as possible 1939 manager
of the St. Louis Cardinals or Brook
lyn Dodgers.
DEMAREE NO EXCEPTION
Among the first who reportedly
will be lopped off the Cubs' roster
in the "top-to-bottom" shakeup are
pitchers Tex Carleton and Larry
French and outfielder Frank De
maree. Because of his dismal show
ing in the World Series, outfielder
Carl Reynolds also may be among
those who will depart early.
