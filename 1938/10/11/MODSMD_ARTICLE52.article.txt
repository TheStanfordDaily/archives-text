# Calvelli Hurt In W.S.C. Game, Put in Hospital
## Varsity Men Begin Intense Preparation For Oregon Game 
### 
Tony Calvelli, Stanford's great
center, was the only new hospital
casualty font the Indians as a result
of the Washington State football
game Saturday.
At about the same time Norm
Standlee came out of confinement,
Calvelli was ordered to bed with an
injured knee and a rising tempera
ture. While his hurts are not con
sidered serious, he will miss valuable
workouts before the Oregon game.
Calvelli joins Dick Sutton, Stand
lee, and Jack Clark on the inactive
list. Bill Willard, left end, who was
forced out of the Cougar game with
a split eye, was back last night in
dummy scrimmage. Chick Orme
worked out at first string left guard
after spending a week recuperating
from the Santa Clara scrimmage.

Coach Tiny Thornhill started an
other week of vicious drill that kept
the squad out under the lights half

Pete Zagar, left tackle, was !
named last night as this week's j
winner of the Keehle pen award
ed to the outstanding Stanford
player in the Washington State
game. Aided by the loss of a bi
cuspid, Zagar perked up Saturday
to star against the Cougars both
offensively and defensively, be

the end zone.

dinner hour, but the men seemed
inspired after their second half
showing against the Cougars.
Wiilard was at left end with Pete
Zagar and Chick Orme alongside
and Wally DeWitt subbing for Cal
velli at center. On the right side,
the line-up was the same that opened
the Washington State gameâ€”Andy
Stojkovich at end, Stan Andersen at
tackle, and Cork Donahue at guard.
The backfield was the same that
sparked the second half drive. Bill
Paulman was at quarter, Freddie
Ledeboer at full, and Pete Fay and
Hugh Gallarneau at halfback. Gal
larneau really poured on power
against the Cougars from his block
ing half spot and should keep him
self up on the first string for quite
a spell.
