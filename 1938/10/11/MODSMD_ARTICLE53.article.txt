# Maloney Has Fine Soccer Outlook
## 
### 
"We didn't win last Saturday; not |
through lack of playing ability but
I through lack of condition," Coach
j Harry Maloney said of his soccer
I team that was tied in the final min
i ute of play by S.F.J.C. in the season's
| opener here last Saturday.
"The makings of a fine team are !
, there and we will go even better'
i against San Mateo next Saturday," j
Maloney said.
Since his squad of 60 has become
' unwieldy, Maloney has divided it in
| to four teams, each with several re
j serve players. Two of the teams are
I scheduled to practice Mondays and
j Wednesdays and the other two will
j work out Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I Every Friday afternoon there will
I be a blackboard talk or a drill in
fundamentals for the entire squad,
Maloney said.
Several sophomores and (wo men
who have had experience abroad
have added plenty of strength to
Maloney's already strong outfit,
j Chris Santum was particularly im
i pressive in coupling with veteran

Stevie Sadullah at the forward spots
and Tito Sanz worked effectively for
part of Saturday's encounter at goal.
Conference games, for the most
part, have been scheduled on the
campus Saturday mornings to make
it possible for the squad to attend
the varsity football games, accord
ing to Maloney.
