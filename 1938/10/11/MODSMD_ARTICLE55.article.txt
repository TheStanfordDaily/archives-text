# Smoking the Quad
## 
### 
WHEN the subject of Quad comes up before
Ex Committee tonight, the issue will al
ready be befogged by the rumors of gigantic
profit last year which have floated around.
A little premature clarification of the case in
hand might be of interest. Apparently, the
snowball of opinion for and against any change
in Quad set-up started when tales leaked out of
a small fortune in bonus awarded to last year's
top men. And, without anyone checking up
on the exact circumstances attending that profit,
the immediate reaction set in: "Something
should be done." The "have nots" started
clamoring; the "haves" prepared for a back
to-the-wall stand.
The actual facts, to be brought up in Ex Com
mittee meeting tonight, are far from being as
lurid as the rumors. Real question on the ex
isting Quad division of spoils seems to center
around the profit, rather than the salary scale.
Examination will show that the salaries of mem
bers of the staff are proportionately equal to
those of other publications.
But whether or not the possibility of the edi
tor and manager receiving S5lO bonus from
profits should remain may deserve question
ing. The profit clause originally was included
as an incentive to produce a good book. Per
haps Ex Committee tonight will decide that the
incentive motive has been clouded by its very
size, that it could be scaled down to good ad
vantage.
In whatever does happen, though, this one
fact should be kept in mind: any adjustments
should be made with an eye to producing a
better book, not in simply taking money from
someone else. The fact that any changes will
not affect this year's staff will help to empha
size this distinction.
Otherwise the "haves" will turn the tables
on those that carp at them because the "have
nots" will be well named.
They will "have not" a good Quad.
