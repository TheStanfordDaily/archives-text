'"P ONIGHT in Memorial Hall five Stanford
JL students will report to the Farm on their
month-long tour of Japan this summer. Calling
their joint address a "look at Japan," they will
attempt to give the student body a picture of
conditions in a country whose social and indus
trial development has been modeled more
closely than most on that of the United States.
Because Stanford's five speakers are tourists
who were fortunate enough to achieve intimate
contact with the people, their addresses should
be a little more than routine descriptions of
natural wonders and political problems.
They should have a fairly clear understand
ing of the attitude of the Japanese toward their
country's problems: the China war, the military
dictatorship, the situation in the Pacific which
makes Japanese-American relations so vital to
both countries.
Because they are students who represented
not only themselves but a great American uni
versity as well, they should be able to tell some
thing of the way students in Japan feel about
the various guestions which interest students
everywhere: the possibility of achieving a
stable world civilization, the possibility of
achieving social justice, how much part stu
dents should try to play in political and eco
nomic movements.
If Stanford's five can manage to give their
audience a little of the real Japan which usually
remains untouched by the candid-camera tour
ist, the Farm will probably agree with them
that their summer was not wasted.—A. S. D.
