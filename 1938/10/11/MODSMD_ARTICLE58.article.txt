# Row's Bawl-Out
## 
### 
GRADE-point averages released recently by
the Registrar's Office lead on campus
wags to deduce at least two significant facts:
1. Stanford women are more studious than
Stanford men, figuratively speaking.
2. The Phi Betes still have the highest aver
ages on the campus.

But what is not so funny, is the implication
behind the first of these points. Of the 1,976
men included, the 722 Row men, or only two
fifths of all Stanford men, managed to pull
down the total average for all men from plus
one to minus one.
These figures, of course, are not computed
as are bawlout averages or transcripts, yet they
do show that Row men are considerably below
the University average, with the exception of
members of two houses.
The conclusion is obvious: Row men spend
more time on social education than they do on
academic education, for which they don't re
ceive grade points. —H. L. S.
