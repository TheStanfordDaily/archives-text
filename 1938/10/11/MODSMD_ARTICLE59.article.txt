### JOHN COBBS 
VOX FOP AWFULLY
OF THE many distressing aspects of the Thirty Dol
lars Every Thursday phantasy, one of the most
saddening is the passion for letter-writing which its
apostles display. This morning the Campus Opinion
column carries an item which our professors can use
to frighten bad little econ majors.
Its author, who evidently heard too many Fourth of
July speeches at an impressionable age, is a Sidney M.
Cuthbertson. I mention him for convenience, although
I realize that in doing so I play directly into his hands
by printing his name twice instead of once. Despite
his cavalier treatment of the rules of grammar, two
ideas can be deduced. Wall Street is the vampire
which deliberately sucks America's blood; the Ham
and Eggs program is the only thing that can save us
from this "volcano of hell" which "envelopes us in
ruin."
* * *
Like our former pen-pal, Thirty Per Week Leader,
Mr. Cuthbertson demonstrates a blind faith in one
idea, and is not at all bothered about testing it, or
listening to any arguments. Someone evidently told
him that Wall Street was responsible for all the
world's misery. Because the idea was simple, lecjuit
ing no analysis or thought, he froze to it, and is
proudly satisfied with it.
Mr. Cuthbertson could not tell us what Wall Street
is, because, except as the New- York thoroughfare,
Wall Street does not exist. What he loosely brands
with that term is an involved combination of forces
and individuals. Experts have studied Wall Street and
have written theses apologizing for their limited treat
ment.
* * * *
OUT it is useless to tell Mr. Cuthbertson that Wall
Street does not have an individual will, that it
does not act as a unit. It is useless to tell him that
the bankers and industrialists do not profit from de
pression. Nor can he be convinced that shareholders
and owners will suffer from the Thirty Dollar inflation
much less than the men on fixed incomes.
* Us * *
As a matter of fact, I am very little concei'ned
with what Mr. Cuthbertson thinks. And I know any
number of people who are much more entertaining
correspondents.
Mr. Cuthbertson depresses me because he is typ
ical of self-satisfied fanaticism. He has found an idea
so simplified that he can follow it. And he wants no
other. He is afraid to argue because his complacency
might be upset. And so he takes refuge in a thicket
of cliche and catch-words.
Men with a similar faith burned witches and led
dragonnades in earlier days.
I hope he won't write any more letters because I
am much to young to become a cynic.

listening to any arguments. Someone evidently told
him that Wall Street was responsible for all the
world's misery. Because the idea was simple, lecjuit
ing no analysis or thought, he froze to it, and is
proudly satisfied with it.
Mr. Cuthbertson could not tell us what Wall Street
is, because, except as the New- York thoroughfare,
Wall Street does not exist. What he loosely brands
with that term is an involved combination of forces
and individuals. Experts have studied Wall Street and
have written theses apologizing for their limited treat
ment.

OUT it is useless to tell Mr. Cuthbertson that Wall
Street does not have an individual will, that it
does not act as a unit. It is useless to tell him that
the bankers and industrialists do not profit from de
pression. Nor can he be convinced that shareholders
and owners will suffer from the Thirty Dollar inflation
much less than the men on fixed incomes.
* Us * *
As a matter of fact, I am very little concei'ned
with what Mr. Cuthbertson thinks. And I know any
number of people who are much more entertaining
correspondents.
Mr. Cuthbertson depresses me because he is typ
ical of self-satisfied fanaticism. He has found an idea
so simplified that he can follow it. And he wants no
other. He is afraid to argue because his complacency
might be upset. And so he takes refuge in a thicket
of cliche and catch-words.
Men with a similar faith burned witches and led
dragonnades in earlier days.
I hope he won't write any more letters because I
am much to young to become a cynic.
VOX FOP AWFULLY
OF THE many distressing aspects of the Thirty Dol
lars Every Thursday phantasy, one of the most
saddening is the passion for letter-writing which its
apostles display. This morning the Campus Opinion
column carries an item which our professors can use
to frighten bad little econ majors.
Its author, who evidently heard too many Fourth of
July speeches at an impressionable age, is a Sidney M.
Cuthbertson. I mention him for convenience, although
I realize that in doing so I play directly into his hands
by printing his name twice instead of once. Despite
his cavalier treatment of the rules of grammar, two
ideas can be deduced. Wall Street is the vampire
which deliberately sucks America's blood; the Ham
and Eggs program is the only thing that can save us
from this "volcano of hell" which "envelopes us in
ruin."

Like our former pen-pal, Thirty Per Week Leader,
Mr. Cuthbertson demonstrates a blind faith in one
idea, and is not at all bothered about testing it, or
listening to any arguments. Someone evidently told
him that Wall Street was responsible for all the
world's misery. Because the idea was simple, lecjuit
