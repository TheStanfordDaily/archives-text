IT'S funny really how many dumb friends you have,
and how dumb you are when you stop to think of
it. Or perhaps I should go back and put all of that
in the first person.
But I have quite a dumb friend in particular who
just stands out. One time he went down south to visit
a guy, and the night he got there he went out alone
as only a dumb friend would. Sooner or later he
came back, went upstairs and got undressed —and
found he was in the wrong house.
Yes, he's a nice guy, but he's a little dumb. One
of his better friends has taken several courses with
him. The dumb one, knowing that this guy has got
several C's and B's in his time, asked him the other
day what his bawlout average was. This guy said, "Oh,
plus 180."
My dumb friend calculated for a minute. "Let's see,
15 units a quarter, you've been here two years, that's
reasonable," and went off about his business quite
satisfied.

Last week-end's rushing brought out a few, too.
One of the houses was serving doughnuts and eider,
and one of the brothers got hold of what he thought
was a bad doughnut. He threw it out the door—and
hit a frosh, who was coming in the door, right in the
face. That was enough for the frosh. Without a word
he turned and went right back down the steps.
At another house a slightly baffled rushee came in.
The first chance he got he sidled up to one of the
brothers, looked around to sec that no one was listen
ing, and said very confidentially, "Say, what house i£
that next door?"
The house next door was the Chinese Club.

r pHEN in Cardinal's meeting last week, someone very
seriously said, "There are an awful lot of old shoes
floating around the fraternities."
I don't think he was allcgorically alluding to the
brethren in the houses.
And there was the frosh on Reg day, when some
one asked him what a certain line he was in led to,
answered, "I don't know—l'm just standing in it."

Overheard (in one way or another): A woman on a
street in San Francisco asking another woman, "Do
I look funny?" A high school girl In a hospital look
ing into the room where quite new babies are kept,
asking, "What are those?" A young woman on the
Quad saying, when the guy she was with had told
her that walking was good for her because it would
keep her figure down, "But my figure can't go down.
It doesn't go up." A Roble girl before last Satur
day's game asking, "Where do you wear a pom-pon?"
Male voice heard over the phone in the Roble lobby
during the first week of school saying, "Oh! Wow!"

I was reading from a book on Spanish history in
the library the other day by a guy who wasn't any
too smart, either. In one place, where he is telling of
a kid, a future king, who sees his brother's head
rudely chopped ofT, the author says: "This horrible
spectacle w;»s. no doubt, ;m excellent le.sson in things
for him."
A lesson in things, son. Just things.
