# Fannie Hurst Calls It Right In New Show
## 
### 
"FOUR DAUGHTERS," currently
playing at the Fox-Stanford:
As a rule I don't hanker to get any
closer to the soil than Winchell's
column, and Fannie Hurst's particu
larly earthy view of life, care of
King Features Syndicate leaves me
yowling for Mother Sill's Remedy.
However, in "Four Daugthers,"

Miss Hurst calls
it right. The pic
ture is warm, hu
man, and sympa
thetic — yes, all
three of that po
tentially nauseat
ing trinity. But
sensitive charac
ter delineation on
the part of the
author, and sensi-

tive acting and direction make it
navigable without galoshes.
The story deals with the dean of
a small-town music foundation and
his four daughters. When Jeffrey
Lynd, a personable young composer
appears in their lives, all four bait
the hook, and Anne, the exubei'ant
youngster, lands him. But on the
eve of her marriage, she elopes
with dour, cynical Mickey Borden, a
gifted arranger.
The picture is well cast through
out. Priscilla Lane catches the
spirit of Anne as the sort of loyal
young girl who would sacrifice a
man for her sister's happiness.
Rosemary Lane, as the talented
daughter with the peculiar indif
ference which sometimes marks
those secure in a gift; Lola Lane, as
the practical daughter who marries
a tin-horn sport for wealth and po
sition; Gale Page, as the sweet, ro
mantic daughter; and Claude Rains,

as the bluff, pedantic professor, all
cut their characterizations with pre
cision and an eye to the essential.
But perhaps John Garfield, as the
hard-bitten, intense Borden turns
in the most trenchant performance.
A sinewy thespic technique and a
certain acidity bolster his portrayal.
