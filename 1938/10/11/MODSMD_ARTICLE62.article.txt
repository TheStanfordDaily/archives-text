# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Getting down to cases on the $30
per week issue, a live subject for
open debate, it is Amendment No.
25 on the Nov. Bth ballot, and will
be operative when passed. Being a
part of the Constitution, the courts,
and law enforcement machinery,
including all officers will enforce it.
The people will make the law, and
are the makers and re-makers.
No one disputes the fact that the
state and nation is in such serious
distress that a change for the better
must be made quickly. We are starv
ing in the midst of plenty. A vol
cano of hell envelopes us in ruin.
We have no place to go for relief.
Thirty dollars per week is a life
boat for the drowning.
Enemy No. 1, to this saving force,
is tho greedy Wall Street influence,
the curse of our country. All unfair
attacks come from enemy No. 1. Our
money supply is their creation. Their
p»wer can have no standing in law.
It is unconstitutional power. Cali
fornia's new money would uncover
their RACKET.
Our banking foundation is built
on this precipice, and its life is al
ways in danger. Bank securities
have and will alternate in upheav
als of bankruptcy, despair, suicide,
and panic. The sun spot of "eco
nomic illiteracy" will not explain it
away. This bad money is as sound
as soft rubber, and our insecurity
continues. Honest public welfare
money can take the place of false,

gain and greed, fountain pen illegal
mis-tender.
The rule of the people is held
back by this powerful institution,
called above Enemy No. 1. This Wall
Street is now on trial. The day for
our judgment is Nov. Bth. The day
in court will come shortly there
after. Law and order must quickly
take its course.
Coin Harvey said, "Civilization
will perish, if gainful greed contin
ues to control our money supply for
their selfish ends."
This eternal ruin graft must go
and Califail ttoy rno cmfwy cm
and California leads the way to state
and national freedom. What Harvey
failed to do $30 per week will do.
Enemy No. 1, the "MASTER
VOICE is on trial, and not any
faults of the Pension Plan.

The Editor, Sir:
Having gone back and forth from
Encina every day, my aesthetic
sense for fine sculptures has been
insulted every time upon observing
the dirt-covered bust in the niche
below the word HISTORY in the
English Comer. It is especially
shocking to such a delicate student
as I to see this pathetic figure
clothed in caked-up, smutty, well
worn dirt. It is my earnest plea
that someone employed upon this
campus will spare a few minutes to
give this venerable gentleman a
bath. The effort will certainly be
worth-while to me, to the students,
and to the University. How about
it? I. K., '42

Our banking foundation is built

Having gone back and forth from
Encina every day, my aesthetic
sense for fine sculptures has been
insulted every time upon observing
the dirt-covered bust in the niche
below the word HISTORY in the
English Comer. It is especially
shocking to such a delicate student
as I to see this pathetic figure
clothed in caked-up, smutty, well
worn dirt. It is my earnest plea
that someone employed upon this
campus will spare a few minutes to
give this venerable gentleman a
bath. The effort will certainly be
worth-while to me, to the students,
and to the University. How about
it? I. K., '42
