IN PRINTING this picture of last year's collapse of the boathousc, The Daily's primary purpose is not that
of rehashing past unpleasant events. The picture, however, does serve strikingly to remind Stanford of the
exact physical stale of the boathouse. While the accident last spring was caused by overloading the upper
deck, rather than by an integral fault of construction, the fact remains that the boathouse is outmoded on
the counts of safety, service, and aesthetics. (Photos by Jeanette Hill)
