# Funds On Hand For Boathouse
## 
### 
Indicating that a new Lagunita boathouse is finan
cially possible, Tom Killefer, student manager, yester
day declared that "it is more or less up to the students
to take action on the matter.
"A new boathouse can be financed," he said, "and
it is up to Ex Committee to make any appropriation,
but some sort of student poll or expression of campus
opinion must be made before anything can be done."
Action on the matter was started last night at Ex

Committee meeting, but it is stu- <
dent desire which will regulate the
formulation of plans, if any, for the
construction of the boathouse, he
indicated.
Informally proposed plans for the
structure include wide differences of
opinion as to how elaborate it
should be.
Some persons advocate construc
tion of a combination dance hall,
soda fountain, and boathouse. Oth
ers feel that the original purpose
only should be considered in making
plans.
Opinion on the necessity for a new
building on the shores of the lake
has been in the conversational stage
for some time, but the stigma of
"unsafe" was actually realized when
the boathouse collapsed last spring.
At that time, it was thought that
the Stanford Board of Athletic
Control held part interest with the
A.S.S.U. in the fate of the boathouse.
This interest, however, was "cast
away, years ago," according to A1
Masters, graduate manager.
Reasons other than safety for con
struction of a new lake-shore build
ing are its unsightliness and-its out
moded and outgrown facilities.
Proponents of plans have also felt
that some combination structure
could be worked out so that after
game jolly-ups and informal social
events could be scheduled there
during the three quarters of the
school year.
Actual responsibility for action
lies with Ex Committee if some
thing is to be done. What form of
action Ex Committee takes depends
in turn upon the student body, ac
cording to the student manager's
view.
Church pews first came into use
in the lt. r )h century. Prior to that
time, worshippers sat on the bare
floors of churches.

The first refrigerator cars for
transporting perishables were de
vised in 1857 by an eastern railroad
which insulated some box cars and
placed ice in the doorways.
