# Furor Recalls History, Crash
## 
### 
Biggest event in the quarter-century history of
Lake Lagunita's boathouse was its inopportune deci
sion to crash city front pages in self-celebration of its
25th anniversary during last year's Spring Water Car
nival.
What started out to be a joyous occasion, however,
turned to embarrassment when the boathouse itself
stumbled in its attempt to trip the light fantastic and
clumsily collapsed on its right side.

At that time, 25 people were pre
cipitated into the lake, because the
boat-house's shaky frame was unable
to uphold the overload of people
clustered on its balcony. Two of
those persons were seriously hurt
but escaped permanent injury.
