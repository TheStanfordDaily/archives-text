# WOMEN RAISE FUNDS
## 
### 
One boathouse was built in 1910,
when campus women raised funds
totalling approximately $350 to in
sure construction.
Most of this money came from
membership fees paid to the boating
club and row-boats and sculls were
installed in the new building for the
use of club members.
Using these facilities, crew racing
also carried on its main activity from
Lagunita, but interest gradually
waned until the sport was abolisned
during the next few years.
Birth of the present structure oc
curred in 1913, when the Board of
Control on student athletic enter
prises voted $1800 for its construc
tion.
