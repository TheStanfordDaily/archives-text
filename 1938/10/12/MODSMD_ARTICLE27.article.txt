Criticizing Cardinals for its
"lackadaisical attitude," Ex Com
mittee last night took steps ot force
the activity organization to provide
more on campus social functions.
Chief complaint was that po post
game dances have been planned as
yet for either the Oregon or the
U.S.C. game. Betty Davis, as a
Cardinal, was asked to see that the
organization "gets off the dime" at
tonight's meeting.
Final action in Ex Committee's in
vestigation of the Quad financial
set-up was held over until next
week, when Annabelle Clarke's com
mittee is scheduled to make its final
report. In her preliminary report,
last night, she explained an itemized
list of last year's expenditures and
enumerated items in the Quad bud
get for this year.
Discussion of Stanford's social
situation was opened by Harry Hor
ton, who declared that "Cardinals
ground out the activities last year
with machine-like precision, but
there was no enthusiasm."
