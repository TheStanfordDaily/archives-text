JERUSALEM, Oct. 11 (UP). -
British military forces tonight start
ed widespread punitive measures
against Arab terrorists by blowing
up houses and driving armed bnad?
into the hills with bombing planes
and armored cars.
Moslem leaders, defying Great
Britain's determination to crush the
rebellion that resembles a modern
holy war, announced their armed
resistance would be intensified and
the entire moslem world is being
roused to anger.
In Bethlehem British troops were
barricaded behind machine guns,
tanks, barbed wire and sandbags
around the crumbling church of (he
Nativity on the spot where Christ
was born.
A large force of Arab rebels had
occupied e√üthlehem and British au
thorities made the city the symbol
of their most drastic efforts to stamp
out the bloodshed of the past five
years.
The British military forces, soon to
be brought to nearly 15.000 in addi
tion to 6000 special police, began
their reprisals by dynamiting 21 Arab
houses in Lydda and 25 houses in
Majdall, an Arab vilalge in South
Palestine.

I Bloodshed spread throughout the
Holy Land, with at least 17 Arabs
: killed and numerous Arabs and po
i lice constabulary w<sunded in
I clashes during the past 24 hours.
