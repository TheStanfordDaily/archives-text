j SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 11 (UP).
I â€”U. S. Senator James E. Murray,
Dem., Mont., a visitor here today
l predicts the entire Democratic slate
i in California would win in the No-
I vember elections.
Murray envisioned the principal
contest of national interest, the bat
tle for the U.S. senatorship between
Republican Philip Bancroft and
Democrat Sheridan Downey, as also
a struggle between former President
Herbert Hoover and President
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
"It is Mr. Hoover's purpose to do
everything possible to embarrass
President Roosevelt and the sena
torial contest in California becomes,
therefore, a national as well as a
1 state issue," Murray said.
