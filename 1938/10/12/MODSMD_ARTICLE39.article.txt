# CAMPUS OPINION
## LETTER UNFAIR 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The vindictive author who signs
himself "Thirty Per Week Leader"
to the Campus Opinion letter ap
pearing in the Stanford Daily of
October 7, seems grossly unfair to
the professors who pronounced his
scheme unsound. At least part of
these professors are active members
of the Consumers' Cooperative So
ciety of Palo Alto, which operates
according to principles originated
by a group of poor but far-sighted
workers in Rochdale, England, in
1844. No other plan for promoting
the economic welfare of humankind
has proved so practical or so world
wide in its development.
Perhaps there is some truth in the
j statement higher education has
not sufficiently shown us the way
out of our economic dilemma. But
, then, let uh point t8 the Danish folk
schools or to the extension work of
i St. Francis Xavier University which
have furthered the co-operative
movement.
The Thirty Every Thursday plan
j seems to be a true child of the old
economic school which fosters the
idea of "getting something for
nothing." Let the "Thirty a Week
Leader" study the Rochdale Co-op
-1 erative system and he will find the
"solution for what ails us" in a
growing movement of benefit to
| mankind.
