# HOSPITAL GRIPE

### 
The Editor, Sir:
If you are still in a crusading
mood, there are plenty of saracens
to be fought in the Palo Alto Hos
pital.
Nurses are worked so hard that
they cannot answer a patient's sig
nal light lor from one to six min
utes (average three minutes, 10 sec
onds by the clock). In case of se
rious illness, this length of time is
an eternity.
Today there was a shortage of
linen. They replaced a bed-cloth
with a soiled sheet. There were no
fresh pillow-slips and an extra bed
spread was substituted for the top
sheet. The lower sheet will have to
serve its third day and fourth night.
This morning I did not even re
ceive wash water until nearly 10:30
and then had to ask for it.
My room-mate got well and left

the hospital this morning. So they
moved out his bed, made mine a
private room, and raised the ante
$2 per day.
The food is swell, and all the
worker.Â® are cheerful and helpful,
hut somebody in the office needs a
word.
B.L.
