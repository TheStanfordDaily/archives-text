# NOISY LIBRARIAN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We who are trying to study in our
odd moments often go to the library
for a little concentrated effort — a
free period or an evening could be
well spent there. There is only one
hitch—we don't seem to get much
co-operation Horn one of the li
brary assistants in the reserve book
room.
Last Sunday it was very important
that 1 get a certain amount oi work
done. I had to use a two-hour booi.,
so I sat iown in the reserve room
to study. he upshot of the whole
evening wa:. that I didr/t get t!)<?
work finished due to unnecessary*
noise created by this boy behind the
counter. j
I realize that he had a lot to do; !
and it is very easy for him to for- \
get to be quiet, but as one of many I
who have complained of this, I am i
asking for his co-operation in this
matter.
