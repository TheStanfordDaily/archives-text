to prove that the University of Oregon football team held Washington
State and U.C.L.A. to a net total of .'l7 yards gained through the Duck

line. While the two opponents were<
gaining 127 total yards, they were j
caught from behind often enough to
lose 90; hence the measly 37-yard
total.
Tex Oliver, the new Oregon coach, '
has really started with a rush and
what he would like to do to Stan- ,
lord next Saturday isn't hard to
guess. The Ducks have been on the |
lesser rungs of the conference lad- I
der long enough to claim squatter's j
rights. Now that they are seeing j
what it feels like to sit on top with j
two straight wins, they might not |
want to be moved down.
