But. the Indians have opened an
other week of tough workouts
without a sign of respite after the
Washington State victory. Thornhill
kept the squad out under the lights

It was these same Ducks who
beat Thornhill last year by a slim
7-0 margin after the Indians had
shoved them from one end of the
stadium to the other for most of
the game. Stanford gained enough
yards from scrimmage in that dis
aster to cop any two ordinary con
tests.

revenge tonic into his charges, it
probably wouldn't be a bad idea
alter reading notices of how won
derful the 19158 Webfoot gang really
is. Portland writers have gone
overboard completely for the new
coach and his "bring 'em back alive"
policy.
