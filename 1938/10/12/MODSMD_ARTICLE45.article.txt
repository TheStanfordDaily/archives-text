# CITY SCRIBES RELENT
## 
### 
Meanwhile the San Francisco
scribes are beginning to see things j
in a little redder hue after heckling I
iootball at Stanford for more than '
a week. Now they think Pete Zagar !
and Tony Calvelii are potential All-
Americans, that Hugh Gallarneau is j
a coming grent at right halfback, ;
that Stan Graff, Andy Stojkovich, I
Freddie Ledeboer and a lot of oth- !
ers are getting better every week. |
Out on the practice field, Thorn- 1
hill works on with the same grin,
even if the doors are locked tight.
Tony Calvelii is still nursing a sore
knee and a slight temperature, Bill !
Kirsch picked up a charley-horse, I
Norm Standlee came out again last J
night on crutches, and others like |
Ilamp Pool and Hugh Gallarneau ;
are down with colds and aches.
The squad will probably secretly |
scrimmage in earnest this afternoon, :
then taper off Thursday and Friday
before the game.
