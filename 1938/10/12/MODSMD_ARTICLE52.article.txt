# Frosh Grid Linemen Earn Shipkey Praise
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
Coach Harry Shipkey took time
out yesterday from his duties of
mentoring Stanford's frosh grid
ders to pay tribute to the great un
sung heroes of this years undefeated
aggregation.
"Sure those backs are good," said
Shipkey, "but it was really the line
that made our team last Saturday.
The only mistakes our linemen
made all day was late in the game
when our ends tried to block S.C.'s
ends instead of rushing the passer,
thus making possible all those long
Trobabe passes in the last quarter.
If they had rushed the passer as I
instructed them, S.C. might never
have scored."
