# BUILD A BOATHOUSE
## 
### 
THE worm, after all of these years, has turned.
When a gaunt, unsightly barn of a Boat
house turned its weathered face to greet
aquatic-minded Stanfordites each spring, noth
ing but a slight stomachic twist of revulsion
v/as experienced by the campus flock.
The Boathouse remained, long after its com
plexion and its physique had passed the first
blush of adolescence.
When, last spring, the old girl celebrated her
25th anniversary by sagging on the westerly
corner to the alarming degree of complete
collapse, Stanford was shocked, but inclined to
forgive the old hag's weakness on the grounds
of caprice. She was let off with a slight admon
ishment and a soothing "There, there, Granny.
It happens to the best of us."
Nothing was done. The Boathouse still lin
gers on like a raw sore on Stanford's otherwise
beautiful campus.
But the worm has definitely turned.
No longer will the excuses and pleas of that
old dowager the Boathouse be received with
a kindly manner.
She must go.
First step in throwing out the old ancl pro
viding for the new was taken in Ex Committee
last night when a committee was appointed to
investigate the matter.
But the matter is a bigger one than that com
mittee, or the governing bqdy alone can han
dle. It involves the whole campus. The Boat
house is a structure maintained primarily as a
convenience to houses and clubs. The admin
istration is under no obligation to act for the
campus on a matter which is purely their own
concern. It is a matter for the campus to act
upon.
Ex Committee has made its offer. Their sub
committee today will make definite plans to
carry that offer to its realization.
But now is the time for the student body to
express in no-uncertain terms its growing ire
with the present Boathouse.
Let there be no hesitation on the question.
The old Boathouse must be replaced.
