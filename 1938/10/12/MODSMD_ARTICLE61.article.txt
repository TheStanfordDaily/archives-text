AT first, even their best friends wouldn't tell
Cardinals and Rally Committee that, in one
respect, they were asleep on the job.
But Ex Committee, presented with the prob
lem last night, finally made it possible for
friends to speak neither lightly nor politely
concerning the lack of activity which has so
far characterized the work of Stanford's enter
tainment committees.
As was pointed out last night, this year brings
enough home games to satisfy any Stanfordite.
But until today, no provision whatsoever has
been made to follow those games with campus
activityâ€”a dance, jolly-up, or celebration affair
of any sort. There is no particular reason for
not having something. It just isn't being done
this year.
Yet the problem is broader than that of the
simple compulsion of those bodies to provide
after-game entertainment. It involves certain
facts concerning the financial and vehicular
status of the campus:
1. Three out of four students find off-campus
dates virtually impossible because of the lack
of transportation.
2. For another, or perhaps the same, large
group, off-campus evenings are impossibly ex
pensive.
There are your forgotten men, in a propor
tionately larger number than Roosevelt ever
dreamed of.
For the immediate future, Rally Committee
has stepped into the breach with plans for an
Oregon after-game function of some sort. But
what about the S.C. game, the Big Game, and
the Dartmouth game?
What about the rest of the year?
Perhaps Ex Committee's feeling on the matter
will take care of the growing laxity of respon
sible groups, will remedy the situation.
But if the governing body's mild censure
doesn't take, if Stanford's entertainment crews

still snore gently, the matter should not be
dropped.
Stanford deserves its own entertainment on
its own campus.
Stanford should demand it.
