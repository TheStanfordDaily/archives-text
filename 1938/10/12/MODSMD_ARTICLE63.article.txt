# BULL SESSION
## SORRY I HAVEN'T WRITTEN 
### JOHN COBBS 
I NEAREST MOTHER:
This is just a short letter to let you know that
I haven't enlisted in the foreign legion or been shang
haied onto a clipper headed for round the Horn.
There have been times during the past week when the
idea of playing nursemaid to a lonely outpost in the
Sahara sounded very alluring, but I resisted the call.
The reason that I haven't written is that I have
been tangled up in rushing, that mystic process by
which fraternities perpetuate themselves, so that next
year's sun may shine on new rugs in the living room
and new housebills in the mailbox.
* * * *
We spent last week in a succession of wrestling
matches with the back ends of brooms, took my room
mate's questionable pictures off the wall, and moved
the living room furniture so that the new chairs
couldn't be overlooked. Friday and Saturday nights
we wandered around in circles, like sub-average rats
in a psych department maze, following the old con
vention technique, "If you see a hand, shake it."
The freshmen came in, most of them running in
pairs and looking as nervous as a couple of poodles in
a mastiffs backyard. They wandered about, ate some
thing indigestible, and vanished into the misty outer
darkness. Each wore a smile that displayed exactly
the same number of teeth throughout the evening.
But they were a good bunch of boys and bore up
well.
* * * *
jVIEXT week, the Row brings up its heavy artillery
and abandons skirmishing for siege tactics. This
continues until the January armistice, when each fresh
man finds his place among the sons of Alpha Alpha
Alpha.
The program has its annoying aspects, but if things
went off according to the scenario, it would mean at
the worst only eight or ten rush periods when we had
to be careful of our jokes. The real trouble comes
about the end of fall quarter, when some of the fresh
men work themselves up into a mildly psychopathic
condition, worrying about the impression they are
making.
Parents of the type that always accompanies its
children to the classroom on the first day grammar
school opens, love to meddle with the fraternity ques
tion. They manage to convince the freshman that if he
doesn't join the Alphas, he might as well go into a
monastery. The chances are, the Alphas have never
heard of him, and not being psychic, overlook him.
Ordinarily the frosh says, "To hell with it." But
some of them haven't got that much sense, which ac
counts for the nasty letters to the editor and for the
haggard looks both in Encina and on the Row.
# * >|t *
I am hoping that this year, no one will take our
little game too seriously. But no bookie would give me
odds on it. And so if you don't hear from me again,
perhaps you had better try the Foreign Legion.
Best love,
Johnny

we wandered around in circles, like sub-average rats
in a psych department maze, following the old con
vention technique, "If you see a hand, shake it."
The freshmen came in, most of them running in
pairs and looking as nervous as a couple of poodles in
a mastiffs backyard. They wandered about, ate some
thing indigestible, and vanished into the misty outer
darkness. Each wore a smile that displayed exactly
the same number of teeth throughout the evening.
But they were a good bunch of boys and bore up
well.

jVIEXT week, the Row brings up its heavy artillery
and abandons skirmishing for siege tactics. This
continues until the January armistice, when each fresh
man finds his place among the sons of Alpha Alpha
Alpha.
The program has its annoying aspects, but if things
went off according to the scenario, it would mean at
the worst only eight or ten rush periods when we had
to be careful of our jokes. The real trouble comes
about the end of fall quarter, when some of the fresh
men work themselves up into a mildly psychopathic
condition, worrying about the impression they are
making.
Parents of the type that always accompanies its
children to the classroom on the first day grammar
school opens, love to meddle with the fraternity ques
tion. They manage to convince the freshman that if he
doesn't join the Alphas, he might as well go into a
monastery. The chances are, the Alphas have never
heard of him, and not being psychic, overlook him.
Ordinarily the frosh says, "To hell with it." But
some of them haven't got that much sense, which ac
counts for the nasty letters to the editor and for the
haggard looks both in Encina and on the Row.

I am hoping that this year, no one will take our
little game too seriously. But no bookie would give me
odds on it. And so if you don't hear from me again,
perhaps you had better try the Foreign Legion.
Best love,

I NEAREST MOTHER:
This is just a short letter to let you know that
I haven't enlisted in the foreign legion or been shang
haied onto a clipper headed for round the Horn.
There have been times during the past week when the
idea of playing nursemaid to a lonely outpost in the
Sahara sounded very alluring, but I resisted the call.
The reason that I haven't written is that I have
been tangled up in rushing, that mystic process by
which fraternities perpetuate themselves, so that next
year's sun may shine on new rugs in the living room
and new housebills in the mailbox.
* * * *
We spent last week in a succession of wrestling
matches with the back ends of brooms, took my room
mate's questionable pictures off the wall, and moved
the living room furniture so that the new chairs
couldn't be overlooked. Friday and Saturday nights
we wandered around in circles, like sub-average rats
in a psych department maze, following the old con
vention technique, "If you see a hand, shake it."
