### DOUC JAQUES 
F AST week in the midst of The Daily's spread of
liquor stories, one professor, I hear, was telling
his class about how certain bums with an A.B. degree
stagger into filling stations in their dust-covered
clothes and ask for a little gasoline. They say they
want to clean a spot oft' their coats or something.
The filling station man, the professor says, gives
them a cup of gasoline—which they promptly drink.
Then they get quite obliviously drunk for a number
of hours. In fact, they pass out.
The professor finished his somewhat macabre story
and a voice way to the back said, "Yes, I'll never
forget the last gasoline jag I went on."
We do not serve gasoline in cups to minors.

In one of the fraternities the other night a brother
announced his engagement. Being rather a nice broth
er, he passed out quite expensive cigars.
The brothers accepted the cigars—but with a cer
tain lack of reverence.
Wholesale bargaining, in fact, began immediately
after dinner, I hear. One of the boys bought up all
the cigars he could from the non-smokers for five
cents and sold them for a dime. Another of the boys
sold his to a freshman rushee.

A few days before The Daily tryoutee period, I'hyl
White, our Women's Editor, was telling some of us
about the time she was a tryoutee. "I was simply
fascinated," she said, "by the way the Women's Editor
smoked cigarettes. She seemed to smoke one right
after the other."
A couple of days ago I was talking to one of the
guys going through the tryoutee period this year.
"That Women's Editor gets me," he said. "I like to
watch the way she smokes one cigarette after the
other."
Maybe Darwin could make a case history out of it.

SOMETHING happened to me the other day which
I'm still not vorv clear about. Over in front of
one of the walks leading to Branner there's a big pile
of discarded shrubbery right at the entrance. I sort
of edged niy way around it and started down the
path toward Branner when a man in old work clothes
standing near the pile grinned at me, took his pipe
from his mouth, and said with some sort of an accent,
"Are you doktor?"
"What?" I asked, a little baffled.
"Are you doktor?"
"No."
"Well. I'm professor. Hah. hah."
And that was all.

standing near the pile grinned at me, took his pipe
from his mouth, and said with some sort of an accent,
"Are you doktor?"
"What?" I asked, a little baffled.
"Are you doktor?"
"No."
"Well. I'm professor. Hah. hah."
And that was all.
F AST week in the midst of The Daily's spread of
liquor stories, one professor, I hear, was telling
his class about how certain bums with an A.B. degree
stagger into filling stations in their dust-covered
clothes and ask for a little gasoline. They say they
want to clean a spot oft' their coats or something.
The filling station man, the professor says, gives
them a cup of gasoline—which they promptly drink.
Then they get quite obliviously drunk for a number
of hours. In fact, they pass out.
The professor finished his somewhat macabre story
and a voice way to the back said, "Yes, I'll never
forget the last gasoline jag I went on."
We do not serve gasoline in cups to minors.

In one of the fraternities the other night a brother
announced his engagement. Being rather a nice broth
er, he passed out quite expensive cigars.
The brothers accepted the cigars—but with a cer
tain lack of reverence.
Wholesale bargaining, in fact, began immediately
after dinner, I hear. One of the boys bought up all
the cigars he could from the non-smokers for five
cents and sold them for a dime. Another of the boys
sold his to a freshman rushee.

A few days before The Daily tryoutee period, I'hyl
White, our Women's Editor, was telling some of us
about the time she was a tryoutee. "I was simply
fascinated," she said, "by the way the Women's Editor
smoked cigarettes. She seemed to smoke one right
after the other."
A couple of days ago I was talking to one of the
guys going through the tryoutee period this year.
"That Women's Editor gets me," he said. "I like to
watch the way she smokes one cigarette after the
other."
Maybe Darwin could make a case history out of it.

SOMETHING happened to me the other day which
I'm still not vorv clear about. Over in front of
one of the walks leading to Branner there's a big pile
of discarded shrubbery right at the entrance. I sort
of edged niy way around it and started down the
path toward Branner when a man in old work clothes
standing near the pile grinned at me, took his pipe
from his mouth, and said with some sort of an accent,
"Are you doktor?"
"What?" I asked, a little baffled.
"Are you doktor?"
"No."
"Well. I'm professor. Hah. hah."
