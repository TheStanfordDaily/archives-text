# STORY OLD

But the method would be justi
fiable if the playwright were espe
cially complex or even if he had a
unique and striking problem to
pose. However, "Soliloquy" is the
story of whiney little Jimmy Mimms
bogged down by penny-pinching
and monotony—a story which The
odore Dreiser did much better in
"An American Tragedy." More
over, the hero's thoughts are a
string of Freudian cliches that
would give Joyce the jimmies, bun
gled in the writing, and obvious to
the audience without the public ad
dress system. This advice, anyway,
is a cousin to those flimsy, make
shift gadgets like the combination
golf - sock - and - waffle-iron which
appear in "Popular Science Month
ly"
A good sample of the whole busi
ness is the scene where Jimmy slits
his wife's throat, and stands to one
side while the public address system
pipes up: "Look at Ella. Her head
is falling off. Her neck is bloody all
over. Old scrawny neck is all
bloody." The writing is all as raw
as that, the gist of it, just that su
perfluous, and the record has been
known to scratch.
JOHN BEAL GOOD
However, it should be noted that
John Beal's lines and pantomime as
the snivelling hero are synchro
nized with some smoothness to the
victrola.
But in any case, the audience
could get a bigger and cheaper kick
out of "Gang Busters," more gory
details in "Dick Tracy." Dick Tracy,
of course, has the added advantage
of actually showing the blood drip
ping around—so you can see it clear
ly, too, and even file it for refer
ence on a dull evening.
