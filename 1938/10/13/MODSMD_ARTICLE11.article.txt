side debates of the year.
On Friday, October 28, the debate
team will travel to the University of

outs for places on the squad will be
conducted soon.
The question to be debated will
be that of the Pi Kappa Delta, na
tional debate fraternity, which has
recently been released. It reads,
"Resolved, that the United States
should cease to use public funds for
the purpose of stimulating busi
ness."
EXPLAIN PROCEDURE
The same method will be used for
awarding affirmative and negative
sides as was used for the Common
wealth Club debate last year. If the
number of shares sold of a certain
kind of stock on a certain day is
even one school will be awarded the
affirmative. If it is odd the affirma
tive will be awarded to the other
school.
Francis McDowell, recently ap
pointed freshman debate manager,
