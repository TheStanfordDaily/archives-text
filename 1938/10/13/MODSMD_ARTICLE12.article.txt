Farm men and women will "go

Decision to make the dance formal
was released after combined com

to meet today at 4:30 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse to map plans for
the slumming theme, work by the
eight committees will get under
way. Chairman A1 Zelver announced
that the publicity group will meet
at 5 o'clock today in the Women's
Clubhouse.
A general meeting of all commit
teemen has been tentatively lixed for
Tuesday night, Anderson said.
Budget for the annual sophomore
affair has already been drawn up.
Patrons and patronesses will be an
nounced later.
Because of his long engagements
in San Francisco, Eddie Fitzpatrick
is well known to Farm students.
Signing of Fitzpatrick marks the
second time in Stanford history that
a big-name band has been chosen
for the sophomore dance.
Class workers will decorate the
Women's Gym, carrying out the
"Let's go slumming" motif. Special
sets and scenery effects designed by
Gene Callnon, prominent. Stager,
will augment the work of the com
mittee.
