# Libe Fountain May Be Dynamited!
## 
### 
Apparently determined to settle
once and for all the question of
whether the library fountain is an
ornament or a detriment, an enter
prising group of students has origi
nated a Dynamite Fund — so-called
for obvious reasons—and has placed
a box for contributions from public
minded students on the east side of
the Quad.
The over-sized bird bath—which,
according to the civic-minded group,
resembles nothing so much as a com
bination Roman bath and half an
orange peeling—is going to disap
pear in one fell swoop, if rumors
and omens can be credited.
"We trust the faculty won't take
umbrage upon learning of the ar
ticle's flight," the leader of the group
stated when interviewed.
"It is absolutely untrue that we
intend to hold a premature Fourth of
July celebration with the fund, as
we have been accused of," he added.
"As a matter of fact, we fully intend
to replace the object in question
with something bright and cheery—
you know, something special."
When pressed, he admitted that he
had been flooded with requests for
a couple of beach umbrellas and a
lawn-swing. "However," he con
cluded, "I really think we should do
something for those firemen in En
cina—something to enable them to
rid themselves of excess steam. I'm
holding out for a cozy little croquet
HPIH."
