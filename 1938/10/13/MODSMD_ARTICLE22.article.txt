"If campus opinion is in favor of
going ahead with the idea, every ef

through to its logical conclusion,"
members said.

all men and women to vote.

A.S.S.U. in its work, but made it
plain that the general funds of the

Dr. Wilbur said, "It is a misfit.
Neither in the past nor at present
has the structure fitted in with the
rest of Stanford's architecture.
STUDENTS' PROBLEM

anything shall be done or not. The
boathouse is operated primarily for
student convenience, and any change
should come from them."
Dean Jackson, questioned on steps
to be taken in formulating actual
plans for construction, referred the
matter to James W. McDonnel, su
perintendent of buildings and
grounds. At the same time, Dean
Jackson commented favorably on

the proposal, and offered his co
operation.

BOATHOUSE A MISFIT'
Both administration officials of
fered complete co-operation to the
A.S.S.U. in its work, but made it
plain that the general funds of the
University would not be available to
aid financially.
Concerning the boathouse itself,
Dr. Wilbur said, "It is a misfit.
Neither in the past nor at present
has the structure fitted in with the
rest of Stanford's architecture.
STUDENTS' PROBLEM
"It is a student problem whether
anything shall be done or not. The
boathouse is operated primarily for
student convenience, and any change
should come from them."
Dean Jackson, questioned on steps
to be taken in formulating actual
plans for construction, referred the
matter to James W. McDonnel, su
perintendent of buildings and
grounds. At the same time, Dean
Jackson commented favorably on
past and future action concerning
the proposal, and offered his co
operation.

to review results of the poll and to
formulate further steps to complete
