CHICAGO. Oct. 12 (UP). —Air
travel Ls to be made safer through
use of a recently developed photo
graphic method for checking landing
and take-off of airplanes, Major A.
B. McMullen of the Civil Aeronau
tics Authority told the National
Safety Congress today.
• "Not only will the new system
rave lives," McMullen said, "but it
will save the public money now be
ing wasted on inadequate airports
by providing the government with
a yardstick to determine landing
space needs." The new system in
volves multiple use of moving pic
ture cameras set up at intervals
along the route of landing and take
off, and, besides landing space needs,
provides an accurate check on speed
and rate of climb, he explained.
