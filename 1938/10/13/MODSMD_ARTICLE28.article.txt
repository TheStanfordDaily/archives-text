# Stagers' Competition Draws Songs, Skits
## 
### 
Over 300 students have enthusiastically enrolled in the Gaieties Activ
ity Contest sponsored by Stagers, while skits and songs continue to roll in,
according to Stager President J. P. Cahn.
The technical department, headed by Gene Callnon, has experienced
an unprecedented rush of workers, all anxious "to build or work on
something" and at the same time^

gain credit for their respective liv
ing groups.
"And we need plenty of help,"

stated Callnon, who hopes that with
a willing crew he can avoid a little
of the usual last-minute rush back
stage.
SORORITIES. HALLS LEAD
Sororities and the Halls are so far
leading the field in offering skits
and musical numbers; and, exhibit
ing the energy and spirit of the
Class of '42, Encinamates have turn
ed in more than their share of skits.
"Lots of short skits have been
turned inâ€”and that is very fine,"
said Cahn, "but a lot of the long
and zaney stuff produced by some
of the Farm's absent Maestros of
Comedy is missing. If you've got
something that is funny, makes
sense, and is delightfully screwy,
send it in or get together with Dra
matic Manager Houser or Jack Daw
son of Stagers' production board for
a little talk. Maybe they can help
you with your idea."
