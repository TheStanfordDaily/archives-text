# War Flares; Japan Presses Surprise Drive
## Chinese Mobilize To Resist Influx Of New Troops 
### 
HONG KONK, Thursday, Oct. 13
(UP). —Japan cut the Hong Kong-
Canton railway from the air today
while her land forces drove toward
Weichow, key city in the outer
defenses of the great South China
metropolis of Canton.
The Japanese were pressing their
surprise invasion of South China,
designed to crush Chinese National
ist Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,
with everything they had—airplanes,
warships, mechanized land forces
and infantrymen.
CANTON BATTLESCENE
A great battle was developing
south of Waichow, which is about
80 miles east and slightly south of
Canton and slightly north of the
small port of Haichung on Bias Bay
where the Japanese landed from
40,000 to 50,000 soldiers early yes
terday.
A motor road leads from Wai
chow to Canton and once the outer
city is taken the situation of the
metropolis, on which Britain's Hong
Kong colony depends for most of
its trade, will be precarious.
CHINESE MOBILIZE
The Chinese Kwangtung provin
cial government was mobilizing
"1,000,000 men" to resist the inva
sion, but British military intelligence
reports said most of the Chinese
were poorly armed and lacked air
planes, tanks, and modern artillery.
One report was that the Japanese
were landing additional soldiers to
day from their military base on For
mosa island, cast of their Bias Bay
foothold.
A British correspondent who flew
over the Bias Bay area said he saw
more than 100 Japanese ships packed
in Bias Bay from which landing
vessels were transporting thousands
of men ashore.
"The beach was black with Japa
nese," the correspondent reported.
There was no indication here the
Japanese would heed a warning de
livered to the Tokyo government by
British Ambassador Sir Alexander L.
Craigie who warned Japanese Pre
mier and Foreign Minister Prince
Fumimaro Jonoye that Anglo-Japa
nese relations might be imperilled
by the Japanese invasion of South
China.
FOREIGNERS FLEE
Americans, British and other for
eigners were fleeing from the foreign
area of Canton on Shanieen island,
fearing mass Japanese aerial attacks
in advance of the land drive.
