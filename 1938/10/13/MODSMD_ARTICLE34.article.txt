# Cards Due to Face Tough Duck Team
## 
### ARCH JENKINS 
The news is still seeping down from the little town of Eugene, Oregon,
that a hand of the biggest, toughest, smartest football players in many a
moon are packing their bags right now for a slight engagement with the
Stanford Indians this Saturday afternoon.
And the long distance reports aren't just so much advance publicity,
either, because none other than our own Ben Winkelmann scouted the

Webleet in their conquest of U. C.<
L. A. and the stories he tells are
really something.
''They still have the same names
as last year," he sighed yesterday,
"but that's the only way you'd rec
ognize them for the same team.
REALLY TOUGII lIOMBRES
"Their running, passing, and kick
ing, even their spirit, is something
entirely different. They use every
thing from normal Notre Dame for
mations to complex spread forma
tions. We'll be mighty luck to hold
them, but if we do, we'll really move
from then on in."
It seems that Tex Oliver, the new
Duck coach, has been coaching for
over 17 years. Evidently all his pet
ideas and touchdown .schemes for
seasons back are wrapped up in his
present edition.
Sometimes he sits up in the press
box and coaches by telephone. Ht
even sends in substitutes from way
up there.
CARDS MUFF PRACTICE
Fortunately, the Oregon-Stanford
game wasn't played last night be
cause the first team tried an offen
sive scrimmage against a lesser crew
yesterday that made their perform
ance in the Santa Clara game look
like a Class A endeavor.
A couple of the backs suddenly
became afflicted wtih fumbleitis 01
something and proceeded to boot
the ball from one sideline to th(
other with the cannon fodder tean.
definitely the aggressor. The much
touted passing attack of the first
stringers didn't look too good, either
as the defensive linemen kept pour
ing into their backfield from ali
directions.
SEVERAL LAID UP
If the scrimmage showed any rays
of hope, it was the return of Hugh
Callarneau and Hampton Pool to
action. Gallarneau tired early from
a bad head cold, but he performed
capably while he was in. Pool play
ed the left guard job and is a prob
able starter against the Ducks.
But Stan Andersen and Bill
Kirseh missed the workout because
of charley horses, while Tony Cal
velli still holds down the center bed
at the Stanford Hospital. These
three men should all be in shape for
the Ducks, but Norm Standlee, Jack
Clark, and Dick Sutton are definitely
out of action for another week at
least.
The first-string line as it worked
last night consisted of: Bill Willard
and Andy Stojkovich. ends; By
West and Pete Zagar, tackles; ITamp
Pool and Corky Donahue, guards;
and Waily DeWitt, center. In the
secondary it was Gene Coldiron at
quarter, Freddie Ledeboer at full
back, and Pete Fay and Hugh Gal
larneau at halfback.
