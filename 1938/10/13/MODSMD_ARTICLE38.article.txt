# Card Booters Play Saturday
## Seven Papoose Games in Line 
### 
"Not that our soccer squad needs
lo make any excuse, but we should
do much better this Saturday, as
we went into our first game with
only a week's practice," said Coach
Harry Maloney yesterday as he
pointed his varsity toward the San
Mateo J. C. game Saturday morn
ing.
Maloney went on to say that his
forwards are beginning to combine
a little better — they were a little

loose last week—and that the squad
as a whole is getting into first-class
condition.
The divided squad practices
adopted this season — one group
working Tuesday and Thursday and
the other Monday and Wednesday,
with a general chalk talk on Fri
day, is showing many merits and
will be continued. With no casual
ties or sick list the line-up for the
San Mateo match will probably be
much the same as in last Saturday's
game.
