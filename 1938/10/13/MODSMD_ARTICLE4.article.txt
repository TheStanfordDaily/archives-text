# Cardinals Get Busy, Plan Several Events
## Committees Named For Bonfire, Three Football Jolly-ups 
### 
When Betty Davis came into their
meeting last night and very diplo
matically told Cardinals that Ex
Committee would like to see a little
'week-end activity on the Farm,
President Roy Thompson had his
answers ready for her.
Thompson promised: (1) There
will definitely be a dance after the
Oregon game this Saturday. (2)
There will definitely be a dance
after the U.S.C. game. (3) There will
be a dance after the Dartmouth
game if the campus wants it.
DANCE NEXT SATURDAY
Bill Hawkins, dance committee
chairman, with Ken Cuthbertson
and Rovena Conn, were assigned the
job of getting an orchestra, fixing a
price, finding a place, and. in short,
putting on a dance for next Satur
day night.
Preparing for Big Game week,
Thompson made key appointments.
He picked Clint Olsen to be in
charge of this year's bonfire, Woody
Miller to handle the Big Game Rally,
and Dick Frank the jolly-up.
Assorted committees were picked
to set the date for the bonfire, ar
range possible jolly-ups before both
the U.S.C. and Cal games. Skinnay
Ennis will be contacted in an at
tempt to have him down for one of
the jolly-ups.
TO CONTACT JUNIORS
"We ought to be able to do some
thing on these week-ends," Clint
Olsen said. "Ex Committee has
granted no dates until the first week
in November."
As for the rest of the meeting, it
was suggested:
That all junior transfers at Stan
ford be contacted by Cardinals in
hopes of finding some former activ
ity men from other schools with
good ideas for activity stuff;
That Cardinals should consider
advocating the use of union bands
for future all-campus dances in or
der to make it easier to get Big
Name bands down to the Farm.
