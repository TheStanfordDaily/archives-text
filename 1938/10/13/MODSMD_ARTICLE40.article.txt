# Spartans Swamp Humboldt State
## 
### 
Highlighting their fourth straight
victory with a 55-yard touchdown
pass, San Jose State's Spartans Fri
day night swamped Humboldt State
48-0.
Rushing over 34 points in the first
half, the big Spartan machine, fed
by an almost constant string of re
placements, pounded out two more
scores in the last period. Outstand
ing in the San Jose lineup were
Captain Walt McPherson, who
scored two touchdowns; substitute
left halfback Hugh Staley, who also
scored twice; and Carlton Peregoy,
third-string fullback, who was an
offensive dynamo.
This Friday, the Spartans will
play host to Pacific University from
Forest Grove, Oregon. Led by Len
Gillman, triple-threat back, Pacific
University will come south with a
good reputation gained in North
western conference play.
