## JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor Frosh Back Hurt; Subs Get Chance 
### JERRY MAYER 
Coach Harry Shipkey dug deep
into his grab bag at frosh grid
practice yesterday afternoon, and
pulled out a couple of husky substi
tute right halfbacks. News that John
Sturgeon, regular right half, will not
be able to play against Salinas Jun
ior College caused the flurry of ac
tivity on Shipkey's part.
Sturgeon, whose blocking and
pass-catching make him a bulwark
of the first-string backfield, was car
ried of! the field on a stretcher last
Saturday against the U.S.C. frosh
with a side injury. He is expected
to be in shape for the rest of the
games, however. Another back on
the injured list is Paul Blanton, sub
half, who also was carried from the
field on a stretcher. Blanton has a
back injury, but will probably be
able to play if he is needed.
CHANGES CONTEMPLATED
The two Papooses who are battling
for Sturgeon's spot in the starting
lineup are Don Grant and A1 Wool.
Grant has the inside track on the
position because of his weight and
vicious tackling ability. Wool
weighs only 145 pounds, but is the
best punter on the squad. Both
showed up well in reserve roles
against the Trobabes last Saturday,
although each showed inexperience
on pass defense, a point that Ship
key is working on this week.
The yearling mentor is also con
templating a couple of other changes
in his starting lineup. One would
send Ed Wilson into the right end
position ahead of Fred Meyer, and
the other would substitute Pete
Mackey at center for Colin McClin
tock.
RESERVES MAY PLAY
Shipkey explained that he was
satisfied with the work of Meyer and
McClintock, but that he wanted to
give the other men a chance to see
what they can do. Neither of the
latter changes is certain yet, how
ever.
If the Papooses manage to run up
a sufficient lead on Salinas, the re
serves will get a good workout.
! Shipkey expressed himself as being
I more than pleased with the way his
| subs shaped up last Saturday,
j Mel Ellett, left end; Bart Sheela,
'left guard; and Art Rasmussen, full
back, especially stood out. Ellett is
an aggressive defensive end, Sheela
fcroke through for several nice
tackles against the Trobabes, while
Rasmussen worked himself into the
understudy spot for Frankie Albert
at fullback.
SUBS STAR
Larry Partridge, recovering from
a leg injury, got into the game long
enough to make some nice kick
offs, and Shipkey expects him to
see action against Salinas. Partridge
is a tackle. Other linemen who won
their spurs by their splendid play
against SG. are Jim .Murphy, end;
Max Schmidt, Lee DeWitt, and Doc
Stolle, tackles; Bob Heringer, guard;
and Doug Stahle, center.
In the backfield, Russ Smith, rug
ged sub quarterback, played good
ball, and broke away for one nice
gain. Smith, incidentally, got his
nose twisted a bit on this run, and
his proboscis is still a little swollen
and sore.

ried of! the field on a stretcher last
Saturday against the U.S.C. frosh
with a side injury. He is expected
to be in shape for the rest of the
games, however. Another back on
the injured list is Paul Blanton, sub
half, who also was carried from the
field on a stretcher. Blanton has a
back injury, but will probably be
able to play if he is needed.
CHANGES CONTEMPLATED
The two Papooses who are battling
for Sturgeon's spot in the starting
lineup are Don Grant and A1 Wool.
Grant has the inside track on the
position because of his weight and
vicious tackling ability. Wool
weighs only 145 pounds, but is the
best punter on the squad. Both
showed up well in reserve roles
against the Trobabes last Saturday,
although each showed inexperience
on pass defense, a point that Ship
key is working on this week.
The yearling mentor is also con
templating a couple of other changes
in his starting lineup. One would
send Ed Wilson into the right end
position ahead of Fred Meyer, and
the other would substitute Pete
Mackey at center for Colin McClin
tock.
RESERVES MAY PLAY
Shipkey explained that he was
satisfied with the work of Meyer and
McClintock, but that he wanted to
give the other men a chance to see
what they can do. Neither of the
latter changes is certain yet, how
ever.
If the Papooses manage to run up
a sufficient lead on Salinas, the re
serves will get a good workout.
! Shipkey expressed himself as being
I more than pleased with the way his
| subs shaped up last Saturday,
j Mel Ellett, left end; Bart Sheela,
'left guard; and Art Rasmussen, full
back, especially stood out. Ellett is
an aggressive defensive end, Sheela
fcroke through for several nice
tackles against the Trobabes, while
Rasmussen worked himself into the
understudy spot for Frankie Albert
at fullback.
SUBS STAR
Larry Partridge, recovering from
a leg injury, got into the game long
enough to make some nice kick
offs, and Shipkey expects him to
see action against Salinas. Partridge
is a tackle. Other linemen who won
their spurs by their splendid play
against SG. are Jim .Murphy, end;
Max Schmidt, Lee DeWitt, and Doc
Stolle, tackles; Bob Heringer, guard;
and Doug Stahle, center.
In the backfield, Russ Smith, rug
ged sub quarterback, played good
ball, and broke away for one nice
gain. Smith, incidentally, got his
nose twisted a bit on this run, and
his proboscis is still a little swollen
and sore.
Coach Harry Shipkey dug deep
into his grab bag at frosh grid
practice yesterday afternoon, and
pulled out a couple of husky substi
tute right halfbacks. News that John
Sturgeon, regular right half, will not
be able to play against Salinas Jun
ior College caused the flurry of ac
tivity on Shipkey's part.
Sturgeon, whose blocking and
pass-catching make him a bulwark
of the first-string backfield, was car
ried of! the field on a stretcher last
Saturday against the U.S.C. frosh
with a side injury. He is expected
to be in shape for the rest of the
