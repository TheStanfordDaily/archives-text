# Waterdogs Will Test New System Today
## 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton will give Stanford its first glimpse of the water
polo team's revitalized Hungarian system this afternoon at 4:1.0 o'clock in
the Encina pools, as the Indians meet a Compton J.C. team whose early
season record indicates a better than average outfit.
Admission is free and women are invited.
Only Jack Loupe, first string left forward, will be absent from the all-

veteran line-up headed by Captain*
John Lamb that will start the con
test.
SYSTEM WORKS
"The new system is one of short
passes and fast breaks," Thornton
said, "and we don't have to rely on
a man in the hole as we did in the
old system."
In 1933 and 1934, Thornton used
the Hungarian system on the Farm
and the Indians took two straight
conference titles. Thornton picked
up the idea at the Olympic Games
when Hungary carried oft the water
polo event in 1932.
After abandoning the system in
favor of building his attack around
a forward, as he did with Leon Cook
and then Lamb for the past two
years, Thornton this year adopted
a variation of the system used by the
Hungarians in winning ihe Olym
pics.
Thornton stresses the fast break
by the center back and center for
ward in particular with the result
that to date the burden of the at
tack has fallen on Bob Plate and
Harvey Rothschild.
LINEUP ANNOUNCED
According to Thornton, Loupe
hasn't sufficiently recovered from
a head cold to warrant his playing
against Compton today. However,
Thornton said that Loupe might be
available for the Olympic Club clash
in San Francisco tomorrow night.

frosh will get ihe starting call at

schild at center forward and center
back, respectively.
