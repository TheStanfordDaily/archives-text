# Oriole Questions Yanks' Supremacy

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 12 (UP).—
Found: a man who will argue that
i the New York Yankees are not the
j greatest baseball team of all time.
He is Bill Clark, one of the few
survivors of the famed Baltimore
Orioles, a team that boasted such
immortals as Hughie Jennings, Wil
lie Keeler and John McGraw.
"I have always regarded the Ori
oles as the strongest and most pow
erful hitters God ever created," said
Clark, who gave up the professional
game in 1911 and came to coach
baseball at Princeton where he has
been ever since.
"I'll admit that McCarthy'r gang
is a great team with plenty of slug
j gers, but why in hell shouldn't they
be?" asked the man who caught and
played first base for the Orioles.
"They play in well-kept small parks
compared to the open fields we used
to play on, and the balls they have
to smack are as lively as golf balls
when stacked up alongside those we
used to hit."

SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 11 (UP).

—The 1938 racing season on Utah's
famed Downieville salt flats was
definitely over Tuesday with an
nouncement of Ab Jenkins, Salt
Lake City driver, that he would not
attempt to shatter any endurance
or measured mile marks this year.
Jenkins said recent rains had
drenched the saline speedway, 125
miles west of here. He added that
the course was in no condition "to
run at the speeds I planned this
year."
