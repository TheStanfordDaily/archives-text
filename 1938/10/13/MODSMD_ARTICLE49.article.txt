IF YOU want to see one of the
hardest, fastest, most exciting of
athletic contests, drop over to the
Encina pools this afternoon at 4:30
and watch the first campus appear
ance of the newly fired Indian
water polo combination.
Coach Nort Thornton's boys will
introduce the new fast Hungarian

system in a game
with a crack
Compton Junior
College outfit. The
new tactics have
worked line in
contests in Oak
land and San Jose,
and the experi-

ence away trom home lias prepared
the team to present the new strategy
on the Stanford campus with skill
and precision.
Those who have watched water
polo need not be coaxed, but if you
have never seen a game, go out
there for three quarters of an hour,
approximate time for a full game,
and you'll go back often.
speaking of athletic thrillers
that many students miss from
week to week, there are few games
with the spectator interest of soccer.
And the games are played ordinarily
on Saturday mornings, when fans
can come out and warm up to a full
day of sports entertainment.
Soccer in Europe attracts largei
crowds than our football does in tht
United States. On any Saturday
afternoon in the vicinity of London
there can be found nearly 50 teams
in action. And the stadiums and
grandstands are full, some of them
holding as many as 120,000 specta
tors.
The game is played in every
corner of the globe, more exten
sively than any other game in ex
istence. And the rule-:, with few
exceptions, are the same evcry
\\ here.
Soccer is highly scientific, and ii
would be expected that Stanford
could present only a poor Americar
version of a good foreign sport. Bui
that is not true. Not only did Coach
Harry Maloney get his experience
with good foreign teams, but manj
of the Indian players first learnec
the game where it is as well knowr
as American football is here.

Stanford has had soccer teams
since 1910 without interruption, even
during the World War, when Coach
Maloney was in France. The Indian;
defeated the Golden Bears nine
; years in a row, and the matches
have been more or less divided since
i that time.
This year's team appears to he
one of the best in the history of
' Stanford soccer. While the teams
' have been only second in the soc
cer conference in the past two
year;. after winning it three years
straight, few of the old stars have
left, and nearlj everyone on the
field will he a veteran hooter.
"The Mad Turk," TEVFIK SA
DULLAH, learned the game in Tur
key and now holds the center for
ward post for the Cards. Inside
left and outside left positions are
held respectively by CHIS SON
TUIVI, who- first played in Norway,
arid JOHN DE BENEDETTI, of Ar
gentina.
GUNTHER GERBSTEDT, ex
change student from Germany, ap -
peared on the field for the first
time last week and is already alter
nating at outside right with HOW
ARD NAQUIN. Inside right spot is
held by AL PELLAS.
WILSON CLARK. BILL ED
WARDS, and KEN CUTHBEKTSON
ire the first-string halfbacks, and
31LL HAMILTON and DICK BAR
MAN hold the fullback positions.
RUDY MUNZER is goal-guard
for the Cards, followed by a Span
iard. SANS-AGERS TITO. Adding
further Continental experience to
the squad is EMILIO JAUREGUI,
who learned the game on a French
tpam

Coached and played by men
most of whom have played in for
eign countries, Stanford's soccer
team will attract many spectators.
An ardent backer of Indian foot
ball teams and the Buck-of-thc-
Month Club admitted at last Sat
urday's contest that "it's the
only game I like to see."
And if you don't go out to see
eleven men skillfully using their
feet to handle a ball as well as
many can with their hands, you
will get entertainment enough from
the curious knee-pants and striped
tail-coat worn on the field by the
leferee.
