# Craig Speaks On England
## People Want Peace, Professor Asserts 
### 
Dr. Hardin Craig, professor of j
English, spoke on "England at
Peace" at a meeting of the Lunch
eon Club yesterday noon in the
Nitery.
From experiences during the past
six months, in which he did research
work at the British Museum, Dr.
Craig gave a first-hand account of
the attitudes and mood of the
English during the recent critical
period.
"Although they probably wou'd
resent the comparison," said Dr.
Craig, "the English are very like
•he Americans. They have an ardent
love of peace and a sluhborn refusal
to be regimented. They see no use
in having gas masks until necessary
and are not curious to find out about
them."-
According to the professor, the
English are paying mucr. more at
tention to sports and other recrea
tions than they are to possibilities
of war. The fact that a stork hus
made its home in Putney, the derby,
a victory in a cricket match, and
the activities of the royal family are
given preference over national af
fairs as news, he said.
"There is an honest effort being
made to restore good feeling between
Great Britain and the United States
and a popular appeal for the pay
ment of the war debt," continued Dr.
Craig. "They have taken the middle
of the road and gone to work. They
have not been rushed ofl: their feet
by modernism; they are working
j ? r.d doing a good job of it."
The Luncheon Club will again
meet in the Nitery next Wednesday.
