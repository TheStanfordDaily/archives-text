# Louis to Take Coastal Bout
## Champ May Meet Nova-Farr Winner 
### 
A Joe Louis championship fight at j
Treasure Island next April will be
promoted by Mike Jacobs of the
Twentieth Century Sporting Club of
New York City, if suitable unnamed
financial conditions are met by the
exposition committee.
Joe Louis will meet the winner of
the Nova-Tommy Farr fight or the
most available contender at that i
time. Director General Connick, Po
lice Commissioner Charles Traung, j
and State Athletic Chief George
Payne met in secret conference with
Mike Jacobs and his attorney lor
two hours Monday afternoon to try
to come to a financial agreement.
It is rumored that Mike Jacobs
will demand a $50,000 guarantee with
perhaps a promise of $500,000 back
ing for the light. This heavy demand
makes the chance of a fight seem
rather dim; however, when asked
about the probability of such a fight,
Director General Connick said:
"In my opinion it is within the
possibilities for the Exposition to
meet the demands of Promoter Ja
cobs. We will start work imme
diately in the hope we can satisfy
Mr. Jacobs' demands."
