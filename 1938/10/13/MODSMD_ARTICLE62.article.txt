MEMPHIS, Turn., Oct. 12 (UP).—
The New York World's Fair is going
to be an artistic washout, Thomas
Craven, art critic and writer, said
today.
'"They don't want art. but just a
lot of symbolic claptrap," Mr. Craven
said. "The architecture may look
fairly impressive when it is painted
and lighted up but it is certainly
not very distinctive. The sculpture
and painting aiv decidedly inferior
—some of it is terrible."
Mr. Craven charged that condi
tions for work al the fair had ex
cluded America's best artists.
