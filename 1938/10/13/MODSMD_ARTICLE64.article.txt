# Vote Boathouse
## 
### 
WHEN the student body vote comes in on
the proposal to build a new Boathouse, the
result will be a foiegone conclusion:
Build!
As Excom's subcommittee meets today and
again throughout the rest of the week, the na
ture of their deliberation will be a foregone
conclusion:
How shall Stanford build?
Although the enthusiasm and almost unani
mous unofficial sentiment in favor of construc
tion may tend to sweep Stanford off its feet,
the problem is not easy.
According to Tom Killefer, student manager,
it will take a Rothschild-ian technic to provide
funds for building. The solvency of the A.S.S.U.
must not be threatened, nor should the financial
boat be dangerously tipped by further indebt
edness if possible.
But it can be done if Stanford so wills.
Of primary consideration in laying plans for
construction is the decision as to what type of
Boathouse shall be built. Already Campus
Opinion letters are making suggestions; the
dream of a Nitery on Lagunita is still with us,
it seems.
The committee is open to suggestions. What
does Stanford want?
No time may be lost in deciding to act. The
rains come early; once water has begun to rise
in Lagunita, building must be delayed or halted
completely until next year.
While Stanford is voting today, committee
members will be gathering practical founda
tions for definite construction plans—estimates,
designs, and weather warnings.
As concrete solutions to the problems of
building come out, they will be printed for
Stanford's consideration. By next Tuesday,
when Ex Committee meets again, a final plan
should be ready for submission.
Meanwhile, Stanford need not sit idly build
ing Boathouses in the air. It can lay concrete
foundations for those Boathouses by casting its
VOTE TODAY.
