WITH revolt against inconvenient Hell Week
restrictions growing along the Row, In
terfraternity Council meets tonight to wrestle
with the problem of finding the most suitable
time in which to hold its pre-initiation activities.
Because last year's Council decided that
Hell Week should run from November 28 to
December 4, the Row finds itself faced with a
very simple alternative: either it must change
the dates to some earlier time in the quarter, or
it must run the risk of seriously endangering
the health and scholarship of its pledges.
Over and above the inconvenience caused
during rushing by the fact that pledges who
are not initiated cannot attend house meetings
or vote, the present plan blandly ignores the
fact that Hell Week will end only one week
before finals begin. There may be some who can
complete a quarter's work in one week, but the
great majority of them don't live on the Row.
Completely obvious, also, is the danger to
health. It isn't raining now, but it will be in
December. Unless the Row intends to turn
its "Pre-initiation Period" into a pink-tea party,
it is going to endanger health far more than it
will now.
Finally, no amount of apology on the grounds
that "there isn't a football game that weekend"
can change the fact that the present plan is com
pletely inefficient and inconvenient. It is, and
everybody knows it, and that's that.
Much better get Hell Week over with and
out of the way than drag it out to the end of
the quarter. There's little enough excuse for
it already; but there's really no need to make
it completely pointless.—A. S. D.
