# Nailed Tuesday Night
## 
### 
TUESDAY Evening Lecture the other night
was an exemplary occasion when Stanford
men and women took the rostrum to describe
personal experiences of interest to the whole
campus.
Too often, though not particularly of late, the
claim is made that Tuesday Evening programs
lack student appeal. The answer to the claim
always it: "It is impossible to schedule a top
notch program every time."
The answer to the answer came Tuesday
night: let interesting students take over the
series more oftenâ€”maintaining, of course, a
high level of guality.
The opportunities to carry out such a plan
are not impossibly scarce. The students who
spoke night before last were only some of a
number of interesting campus people.
The planners of Tuesday's program hit the
nail on the head. The blow can be repeated
frequently.
There are still some good nails left.
