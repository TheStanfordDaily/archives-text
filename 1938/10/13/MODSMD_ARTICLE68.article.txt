/ |VER in the econ department, professors draw slith
ery graphs which make up an impressionistic pic
ture of the marginal entrepreneur being pushed out
on a limb by monopolistic competitors. Tuesday night,
Ex Committee posed for a stark realism study of the
same subject, when it wandered innocently into the
question of Sunday night movies.
The history of campus movies reads like a Greek
tragedy, for its hero by his charm and success of
fended the jealous gods of celluloid, and thus placed
his name at the top of Fate's file on unfinished busi
ness. At the beginning of last spring quarter, the
movies were flourishing like a New Dealer's dream.
Sponsored by the A.S.S.U., and held in Memorial Hall,
they were not troubled by overhead, fixed costs, and
the allied evils that give accounting students grim
lines about the mouth. Convenience combined with
the economy of a 15-cent admission to lure the
students.
* * * *
Ex Committee was just getting ready to take a bow
for the idea, when the high priests of Hollywood an
nounced that there would be no more movies. Stan
ford, they said, was running in competition with the
Palo Alto theaters, thereby tying knots in the curve
of marginal revenue.
For a while, Ex Committee made noises like a
marginal entrepreneur forced out on a limb. Then
it got discouraged, and dropping the subject, went off
to set a precedent.
* * * *
IN reviving the subject, this year's Excom will find
ethics and justice ready to run interference for it.
But the economists will raise their eyebrows and look
up the committee members' Bawlout averages.
The situation doesn't call for rioting in the sti'eets,
and I don't suggest that we set up a guillotine in
the middle of the Quad. But even so, it gives me a
little flare of resentment, the way the French peasant
must have felt when an aristocratic barouche clat
tered by scattering pedestrians with careless sang
froid.
* * # *
The movies were one of the few projects that ever
managed to please everyone connected with the Uni
versity. The students liked them because they were
convenient and cheap. The administration approved
because they kept the students out of the highway's
vest-pocket editions of Sodom and Gomorrah. Ex
Committee was happy because the movies kept the
administration from worrying about the students.
There is no real reason why we shouldn't have our
movies. The prices at local theaters are a very good
imitation of highway robbery. And their second fea
tures would cause a lynching party in any less orderly
community.
* * K» *
If Stanford can show cheaper and better movies,
all the ethical law and prophets give her the right to
do it.
But the gods of Hollywood say no. And so we
squirm like a typical marginal entrepreneur as we
try to borrow 40 cents.
I wonder if the library has a good book on prac
tical nihilism.

The movies were one of the few projects that ever
managed to please everyone connected with the Uni
versity. The students liked them because they were
convenient and cheap. The administration approved
because they kept the students out of the highway's
vest-pocket editions of Sodom and Gomorrah. Ex
Committee was happy because the movies kept the
administration from worrying about the students.
There is no real reason why we shouldn't have our
movies. The prices at local theaters are a very good
imitation of highway robbery. And their second fea
tures would cause a lynching party in any less orderly
community.
