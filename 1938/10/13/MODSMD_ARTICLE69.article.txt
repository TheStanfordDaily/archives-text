JMT ORE damn things happen all the time which arc
baffling. Just baffling. You don't even dare to
think about them if you don't want people to put you
away somewhere.
There was the time a few weeks ago, for instance,
when a friend of mine named Johnny, who lives in
the city, was going home one night. He was nearly
home when he passed an apartment where a bunch
of people in the apartment were singing "Come Join
the Band."
Being a rather recent Stanford graduate, he stop
ped and looked in the window to see who it was
singing. When he got to the window the singers
paused, someone said, "Hello, Johnny," and then went
right on singing.
He had never seen any of the people in the room
before.

Then, last Sunday in the Chapel, Dr. Trueblood,
during his sermon, was speaking of the European situa
tion, At. one point he asked, "Is that the kind of
peace we want?" and stopped for a somewhat dra
matic pause. A little kid, who people tell mo had
listened to absolutely nothing else that morning but
that question, filled the pause with a loud but
squeaky, "Yes."
Maybe you think that wouldn't be baffling.
Just the other day a friend of mine was looking
up phototelegraphy in the dictionary. The dictionary
referred him to telephotography. He looked up tele
photography. The dictionary said. "Not to be confused
with phototelegraphy." That's all it said.
Professor Farmer was working over in the Graphic
Arts Building the other day when one of the janitors
came in. The janitor looked at some of the pictures
in the room. "Pretty good work these kids do, isn't
it'.'" he said. Professor Farmer monosyllabically
agreed that his statement was not entirely unfounded.
"I was never much for art myself," the janitor con
tinued, leaning nonchalantly on his broom, "but I used
to play the violin. I played the violin for seven years
on a river bqat."
"Why Hid you give it up."
"Oh, it was too hard to learn."

I don't know which side is up.

it'.'" he said. Professor Farmer monosyllabically
agreed that his statement was not entirely unfounded.
"I was never much for art myself," the janitor con
tinued, leaning nonchalantly on his broom, "but I used
to play the violin. I played the violin for seven years
on a river bqat."
"Why Hid you give it up."
"Oh, it was too hard to learn."

More people today than ever before have told me
I don't know which side is up.
JMT ORE damn things happen all the time which arc
baffling. Just baffling. You don't even dare to
think about them if you don't want people to put you
away somewhere.
There was the time a few weeks ago, for instance,
when a friend of mine named Johnny, who lives in
the city, was going home one night. He was nearly
home when he passed an apartment where a bunch
of people in the apartment were singing "Come Join
the Band."
Being a rather recent Stanford graduate, he stop
ped and looked in the window to see who it was
singing. When he got to the window the singers
paused, someone said, "Hello, Johnny," and then went
right on singing.
He had never seen any of the people in the room
before.

Then, last Sunday in the Chapel, Dr. Trueblood,
during his sermon, was speaking of the European situa
tion, At. one point he asked, "Is that the kind of
peace we want?" and stopped for a somewhat dra
matic pause. A little kid, who people tell mo had
listened to absolutely nothing else that morning but
that question, filled the pause with a loud but
squeaky, "Yes."
Maybe you think that wouldn't be baffling.
Just the other day a friend of mine was looking
up phototelegraphy in the dictionary. The dictionary
referred him to telephotography. He looked up tele
photography. The dictionary said. "Not to be confused
with phototelegraphy." That's all it said.
Professor Farmer was working over in the Graphic
Arts Building the other day when one of the janitors
came in. The janitor looked at some of the pictures
in the room. "Pretty good work these kids do, isn't
it'.'" he said. Professor Farmer monosyllabically
agreed that his statement was not entirely unfounded.
"I was never much for art myself," the janitor con
tinued, leaning nonchalantly on his broom, "but I used
to play the violin. I played the violin for seven years
on a river bqat."
