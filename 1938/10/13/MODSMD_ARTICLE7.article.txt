# Farm Talent In Last Try For Gaieties
## Final Audition Call Today, Tomorrow For 300 Hopefuls 
### 
Actual parts for the '38 Gaieties
will be assigned at the final tryouts
today and tomorrow from 4 to 6
o'clock in the Memorial Hall. Per
formers (imitators, tap dancers,
pantomime actors, etc.) will be au
ditioned today; singers, tomorrow.
With 300 tryoutees participating
in the finals, the '38 Gaieties scores a
new high for campus enthusiasm,
and will hit a second high with a
16-piece orchestra and 50-voice cho
rus slated for the show. The choral
group, which will sing popular
tunes, is a Gaieties innovation to
integrate the show.
INVITE TO BERNIIEIM
The dramatic directors of this
years Gaieties extend a special invi
tation to Phil Bernheim, who pub
lished the following gripe about the
Gaieties, as the best way of proving
to him that their show will be every
thing except what he predicted:
"Hie new theater is mighty nice,
and all that, but it has had one
deleterious effect which no one fore
saw: it has entirely killed the Gaie
ties spirit.
"Gone and sadly missed is that
rousing spirit of yesteryear that
made every Gaieties, no matter how
bad, good.
"Gone even from the script is ref
erence to the Big Game. Only one
such crack could my ears detect in
Friday's show.
"WHERE IS SPIRIT?"
"Where is that old Stanford spirit
that made the Assembly Hall quiver
as 1,700 roughs and coeds roared in
unison with Winstead Weaver's
"Nuts to Cal!"
"Where is that communal feeling
bred in every Gaieties audience of
other years by the hoary traditions
of that well-worn barn?
"Gone—vanquished by the suave
dignity of the Memorial Hall. Dig
nity and the Gaieties? Preposterous!
"Stanford, shed a tear—a tear for
the Gaieties that will never be
again."
