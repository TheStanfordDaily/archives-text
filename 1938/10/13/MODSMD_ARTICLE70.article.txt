# Crime Picture Cast in Usual 'G-Men' Mold
## 
### 
"I Am Hie Law," currently playing
at the Stanford Theater:
Coming at the end of the crime
doesn't-pay cycle of pictures, "I Am
the Law" seems like all the other
pictures of its kind that have come
out of Hollywood since "G-Men."
Obviously inspired by Thomas
Dewey's recent campaign against
rackets in New York, the story con
centrates on the methods which Ed
ward G. Robinson uses to make his
frightened witnesses talk. Robinson's
performance as the fearless college
professor turned special prosecutor
is highlighted by his monologues
many throughout the picture. His
plea to the young law graduates is
by far the best.
WIFE TOO UNDERSTANDING
Barbara O'Neil, as the understand
ing wife, understands her husband
almost to too great a degree of un
derstanding. John Beal, a good actor
deserving of a break, drew the worst
part ever written into a picture. The
very few good scenes given him
showed what he can do if given half
a chance.
Running Robinson a close second
and many times surpassing him in
acting was Otto Kruglar as the
"wolf in sheep's clothing."
MONTAGE GOOD
Skillfully directed by Alexander
Hall and containing some very good
montage shots, the picture would
prove an entertaining evening for
those who like Edward G. Robinson,
for it is his picture all the way.
The other picture on the double
bill is "Give Me a Sailor," which
manages to be funny in spite of the
slapstick comedy of Martha Raye
and the dead pan of Bob Hope.
