# CAMPUS OPINION
## DEFENDS HOSPITAL 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In all due sympathy to B. L., may
I take this opportunity to state that
the Palo Alto Hospital is being un
justly criticized. No doubt this pa
tient's physical condition is respon
sible for such an outburst. I speak
with qualification when I say that
the hospital is deserving of all the
credit it may receive for its splendid
care of patients.
I have been a patient three times
(in excess of three weeks) within
the last half-year, yet 1 have expe
rienced no cause for complaint. It
pains me deeply to hear of the ex
cruciating agony B. L. is experienc
ing with his three-day linen and
10:30 wash water. I'll take the three
day hospital linen any time in pref
erence to one week linen at the
halls.
Without question, the hospital is
admittedly overcrowded but every
one receives excellent care, never
theless. The new wing will be a
welcome addition. The workers are
cheerful and helpful, but how could
this be if the "office needed a word."
The Palo Alto Hospital has no
need for defense if I were to offer
it, but rather it should receive praise
for its commendable service to
Stanford students.
Chuck
