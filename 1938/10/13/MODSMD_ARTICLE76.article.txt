# RETRACTION

The Editor, Sir:
The eight-cylinder, valve-in-head,
knee-action door spring on Room
241 is still in pretty good shape in
spite of the exhaustive workout it
had this morning. Memßers of the
Palo Alto Hospital staff, each en
joying or suffering an attitude
about my "Hospital Gripe" in Tues
day's Daily, practically wore a
groove down the hall to my room.
One, with almost a Biblical air, was
so incensed, that I half-anticipated
the command: "Arise ye from your
sick-bed and WALK!"
None of the gripes were denied,
but all were explained. (As a mat
ter of fact, I had some explaining to
do, myself.)
SHORTAGE EXPLAINED
The shortage of linen is not regu
lar Monday fare at the hospital but
in this instance was caused by the
lack of knowledge and, sadly
enough, the courage to ask ques
tions on the part of a new nurse.
This hitch has been straightened out
and my room boasts even of fresh
runners on the table-tops; smells
faintly of hyacinth.
Monday and Tuesday, somebody
forgot to bring my wash-water be
fore breakfast. Now floor nurses
rotate from patient to patient, and
Monday's rotation, which I am told
is particularly vigorous, gave rise to
the wash-water error. This is of
small importance and the mistake
occurred quite by accident.
Shortly after my letter had been
dispatched to your paper, an at
tendant brought word that I had
been placed in isolation—hence my
room could not be shared, and,
moreover, speical precautions nec
essary for my isolation were hardly
compensated by the $2 increase in
room rent.
PHONED THE DAILY
This news floored me. The whole
force of my gripe had fountained
out of a suspicion that the hospital
had taken a slide-rule and slid my
score from $6 to $8 just because there
was nobody to hold down the bed
opposite mine. Naturally I sent a
message correcting that part of my
letter—finally—even 'phoned to have
the letter kept out of print alto
gether. It was kept out Tuesday,
but published in its entirety Wed
nesday.
Many gripes, not only about the
hospital, but about all the campus
institutions, find their origin in hair
trigged incorrect conclusions, such
as I heralded on Monday. I sincere
ly hope that you will always manage
to find space in Campus Opinion for

alleviating errant aired gripes, and
I hope you will find time someday
to meet the Palo Alto Hospital-
Trouble-Shooter, Mr. Philips. He's
certainly a "good egg" and is as
kindly and gentlemanly as a young
er C. Aubrey Smith.

Shortly after my letter had been
dispatched to your paper, an at
tendant brought word that I had
been placed in isolation—hence my
room could not be shared, and,
moreover, speical precautions nec
essary for my isolation were hardly
compensated by the $2 increase in
room rent.
PHONED THE DAILY
This news floored me. The whole
force of my gripe had fountained
out of a suspicion that the hospital
had taken a slide-rule and slid my
score from $6 to $8 just because there
was nobody to hold down the bed
opposite mine. Naturally I sent a
message correcting that part of my
letter—finally—even 'phoned to have
the letter kept out of print alto
gether. It was kept out Tuesday,
but published in its entirety Wed
nesday.
Many gripes, not only about the
hospital, but about all the campus
institutions, find their origin in hair
trigged incorrect conclusions, such
as I heralded on Monday. I sincere
ly hope that you will always manage
to find space in Campus Opinion for

alleviating errant aired gripes, and
I hope you will find time someday
to meet the Palo Alto Hospital-
Trouble-Shooter, Mr. Philips. He's
certainly a "good egg" and is as
kindly and gentlemanly as a young
er C. Aubrey Smith.

The Editor, Sir:
The eight-cylinder, valve-in-head,
knee-action door spring on Room
241 is still in pretty good shape in
spite of the exhaustive workout it
had this morning. Memßers of the
Palo Alto Hospital staff, each en
joying or suffering an attitude
about my "Hospital Gripe" in Tues
day's Daily, practically wore a
groove down the hall to my room.
One, with almost a Biblical air, was
so incensed, that I half-anticipated
the command: "Arise ye from your
sick-bed and WALK!"
None of the gripes were denied,
but all were explained. (As a mat
ter of fact, I had some explaining to
do, myself.)
SHORTAGE EXPLAINED
The shortage of linen is not regu
lar Monday fare at the hospital but
in this instance was caused by the
lack of knowledge and, sadly
enough, the courage to ask ques
tions on the part of a new nurse.
This hitch has been straightened out
and my room boasts even of fresh
runners on the table-tops; smells
faintly of hyacinth.
Monday and Tuesday, somebody
forgot to bring my wash-water be
fore breakfast. Now floor nurses
rotate from patient to patient, and
Monday's rotation, which I am told
is particularly vigorous, gave rise to
the wash-water error. This is of
small importance and the mistake
occurred quite by accident.
