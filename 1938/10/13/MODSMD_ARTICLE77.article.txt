# IN RE LEISER
## 
### 
Stanford Students:
Did you see Bill Leiser's column
in the S. F. Chronicle yesterday
morning? STANFORD FOOTBALL
TEAM THREATENS STRIKE is
what is said. And why? Because
they wouldn't sign a written pledge
that would make them not only re
sponsible for themselves but to
watch for and turn in the names of
anyone else caught drinking on the
campus.
Isn't this a nice state of affairs?
We students were sent to this uni
versity on our own responsibility to
obey the state laws and those regu
lations set up by the University.
But why can't we be trusted to con
duct ourselves as true Stanford men
and women? After all, we aren't in
kindergarten and extreme measures
of discipline are not only unneces
sary but ridiculous.
PLEDGES RIDICULOUS
Stanford does not need "cleaning
up." Why then are we allowing such
ridiculous things as this pledge that
the football players would not sign?
It is only making us ridiculous in
the eyes of all the newspapers and
other campuses, to say nothing of
the effect it is going to have on
parents who were considering send
ing their children to Stanford.
Most of us are obeying both the
laws of the state and those of the
University. Why, then, all this un
necessary adverse publicity which is
not only degrading the rating of
Stanford, but which is a personal
reflection upon the characters of us
students?
STANFORD DRUNKARDS
Do we want to hear people say
about us after we graduate, "Oh, yes
—he graduated from Stanford, where
they are so wild and drink so hard"?
Personally, I don't want that said
about me, and the rest of you stu
dents should feel the same way.
Isn't there something that the stu
dents could do or say to help the
university enforce its regulations
without going to obviously ridicu
lous measures and making a bad
name for the University? After all,
it is our university and it is up to
us to uphold the standards of Stan
ford.

up." Why then are we allowing such
ridiculous things as this pledge that
the football players would not sign?
It is only making us ridiculous in
the eyes of all the newspapers and
other campuses, to say nothing of
the effect it is going to have on
parents who were considering send
ing their children to Stanford.
Most of us are obeying both the
laws of the state and those of the
University. Why, then, all this un
necessary adverse publicity which is
not only degrading the rating of
Stanford, but which is a personal
reflection upon the characters of us
students?
STANFORD DRUNKARDS
Do we want to hear people say
about us after we graduate, "Oh, yes
—he graduated from Stanford, where
they are so wild and drink so hard"?
Personally, I don't want that said
about me, and the rest of you stu
dents should feel the same way.
Isn't there something that the stu
dents could do or say to help the
university enforce its regulations
without going to obviously ridicu
lous measures and making a bad
name for the University? After all,
it is our university and it is up to
us to uphold the standards of Stan
ford.
