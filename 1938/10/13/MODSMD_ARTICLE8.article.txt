A discovery by Dietrich Boden
stein, research assistant in the
School of Biology, brought a winged
chrysalis, a new insect half chrysalis
and half butterfly, from the bio
logical test tubes of Stanford Uni
versity.
With head and wings of a butter
fly but the body of a chrysalis, this
strange creature arises from discov
ery of what causes the summer mir
acle of metamorphosis of caterpil
lars into butterflies.
The cause is a chemical in the
chrysalis' head. The chemical acts
like a hormone, the ductless gland
secretions which "make a man what
he is." Insects, although said to
organize more efficient social com
munities than men, have not been
supposed to possess hormones.
By cutting off circulation in the
skin back of the chrysalis' head, Bo
dcnstcin prevents the body from
changing into a butterfly. Head and
shoulders become the head and
winged shoulders of a butterfly.
But further proof of the great, po
tency of the metamorphosis chemical
has been found in an experiment on
caterpillar legs.
Normally a caterpillar's legs re
quire several molts to change into
butterfly legs. Bodenstein grafted
a caterpillar leg in an early stage,
using surgery to plant it on the body
of an older caterpillar.
This molted at once became a full
fleged butterfly leg. It skipped all
the other usual molts. This shows
that the ability to change is not in
herent in the leg. The change comes
from the body of the "host" to whicl"
the leg is attached.
