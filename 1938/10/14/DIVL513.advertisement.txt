Football Players Don I
Turn Ad Writers
In last Friday s Daily we announced that the most
aggressive football player of each game would be awarded
a pair of shoes. In return, he was to write an ad telling
the student body why he chose the shoes which he did.
A representative of the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference notified us that if the players did
this it would impair their amateur standing. We, of
course, would not want this to happen, so this is what
we are going to do:
Each week the most aggressive player will be awarded
a pair of $7.50 shoes.
The name of the winner will be announced in a news
story.
Each Friday we will advertise the particular shoe
which the player selected.
(To protcct the amateur standing of the player we will withold his name
from the advertisement.)
