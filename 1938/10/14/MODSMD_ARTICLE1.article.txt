# 'Tear It Down' Answer Ballots To Excom Poll
## Wilbur, Jackson Reported by Lee To Be Offering Full Co-operation 
### 
With a small hut overwhelmingly favorable vote, Stanford yesterday
expressed itself in nearly complete approval of the proposal to build a
new Boathouse.
A total of only 188 votes were cast yesterday in the informal poll which
asked, "Should Stanford Have a New Boathouse?" Of the total, 180 voted

yes, 8 voted no. Results were certi-4
fied by Dave Stephenson, election
chairman.
Although the vote was small, Ex
eom's Boathouse Committee, meet
ing yesterday, considered it a sam
ple record of the campus as a whole,
turned to specific construction de
tails.
FIRST ESTIMATE HIGH
Dampened somewhat by the in
itial estimate of Emanuel McDonald,
head of Buildings and Grounds,
which set approximately the figure
of $10,000 for building a two-story
structure, the group decided to ob
tain rather exact estimates from con
tractors and architects.
At the same time, the actual for
mulation of plans was thrown open
to the entire campus when a contest
was announced for amateur archi
tects. A prize of two free bids to
the alumni dance Big Game night
will be given to the student submit
ting the entry whose rough plans
are accepted by Ex Committee Tues
day night.
Committee Chairman H. B. Lee
reported the results of yesterday's
interview with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Comptroller J. Hugh
Jackson. Full co-operation was of
fered by those two officials, but it
was made plain that general Uni
versity funds would not be available
for construction.
TYPES CONSIDERED
Remainder of the meeting was
taken up in consideration of types
of structures which would be appro
priate. General trend of discussion
was away from a Nitery-Boathouse.
It was felt however that some pro
vision for sun-bathing should be
included in specifications, as well as
small dressing rooms.
In charge of interviewing archi
tects for rough plans is H. B. Lee.
When the committee meets again
today, it is hoped that more definite
action can be taken.

Committee Chairman H. B. Lee
reported the results of yesterday's
interview with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Comptroller J. Hugh
Jackson. Full co-operation was of
fered by those two officials, but it
was made plain that general Uni
versity funds would not be available
for construction.
TYPES CONSIDERED
Remainder of the meeting was
taken up in consideration of types
of structures which would be appro
priate. General trend of discussion
was away from a Nitery-Boathouse.
It was felt however that some pro
vision for sun-bathing should be
included in specifications, as well as
small dressing rooms.
In charge of interviewing archi
tects for rough plans is H. B. Lee.
When the committee meets again
today, it is hoped that more definite
action can be taken.
