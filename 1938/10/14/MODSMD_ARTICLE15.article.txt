# Cardinals to Give After Game Dance
## 
### 
Stanford has asked for it, Stanford
will get it—a dance after a football
game.
Decided on in Cardinals' meeting
last night and planned in a day, the
dance will be held in the Women's
Gym from 9 to 12 tomorrow night.
Bids, selling at 75 cents a couple,
will be on sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice all day today and tomorrow and
at the dance tomorrow night.
Ozzie Secrest's 14-piece Mutual
Broadcasting Network orchestra will
come down for its second trip to
the Farm this year to play. Stanford
first heard and approved Ozzie and
his boys at the transfer women's
jolly-up two weeks ago.
Unanimously approved by Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur and Farm student
heads, the dance is expected to draw
a crowd comparable to this year's
popular Reg dance.
Pat Skinner will again set up her
date bureau to fix those men up who
were beaten to the gal they wanted
by someone who was faster on the
phone. Pat is at Roble again this
year.
Whether Tiny Thornhill's boys win
or lose, the dance is destined to
click. Gone will be that empty,
after-the-game feeling that always
comes with either victory or defeat,
and in its place will be soft music,
dancing, and just the trace of last
week-end's full moon.
With the exception of the Reg
dance, it is the first chance the cam
pus will have to put on its best ties
and high-heeled shoes and dance—
on the Farm. To the freshmen who
missed the boat on the Reg dance,
tomorrow night's affair should be a
natural.
Planned by Bill Hawkins, Ken
Cuthbertson, and Rovena oCnn of
Cardinals, this dance will be the
first of a series for this quarter.
There will be another after the
i U.S.C. game and possibly one after
i the Dartmouth game.
