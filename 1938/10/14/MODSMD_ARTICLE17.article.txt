# Boathouse Cost Estimated At Ten Thousand
## Contractors to Send Representatives To Committee Meeting 
### 
On the recommendation of Comp
troller J. Hugh Jackson, Boathouse
Committee Member H. B. Lee yes
terday contacted J. \V. McDonnell,
superintendent of buildings and
grounds, to obtain estimates of
structural cost.
According to McDonnell, the cost
of a two-story building would
amount to approximately $2 per
square foot, that of a one-story
building, $2.50 per square foot. A
rough estimation of square footage
in the present boathouse suggested
that, on this basis, total cost would
mount over $10,000.
ESTIMATES SOUGHT
Immediately following Lee's in
terview with McDonnell, calls were
made to Charles Wagner, University
contractors, and the architectural
firm of Bakewell and Weihe to ob
tain further estimate.' on cost. Both
firms agreed to send representatives
to the Boathouse Committee meeting
this afternoon.
At that time, the rough ideas for
the structure will be discussed and
laid before the firms, with the hope
that some definite plan can be ready
by Monday, date of the next com
mittee meeting. Meantime, student
plans will be accepted and submitted
to the contracting firms for approval.
SPEED NECESSARY
Second problem facing the com
mittee on which McDonnell com
mented was the need for rapid plan
ning. Water will begin to fill Lagu
nita by January 1. If the building is
near completion, however, construc
tion need not be halted, but water
can be diverted for a short time.
McDonnell estimated that approx
imately two months would be re
quired to build a new boathouse.
