architecture, and features of the
structure which must be included in
the drawings:
1. The building should be two
stories high.
2. It should be able to house at
least-50 canoes—the number stored
in the boathouse this summer.
3. Some provision should be made
for a sun-porch or veranda where
chairs, tables, and other deck furni
ture may be placed.
4. A dock should be included for
landing purposes.
DRESSING ROOMS
5. Dressing room facilities, with
toilets and lockers in which to keep
equipment are needed.
(i. Two student rooms, equipped
with washbasins should be included.
7. A diving platform is necessary,
either separate from the main
building, or so constructed that it
can not be overcrowded as it was
last spring when the collapse came.
Actual design may be left to the
architect. Simplicity, and harmony
with other campus buildings is in
order, however, the committee fell.
Announcement of the winner of
the student Boathouse Contest will
be made Tuesday night.
