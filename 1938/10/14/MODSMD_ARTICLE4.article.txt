# Daily Survey Shows Campus For Boathouse
## Large Percentage Of Students Favor Building New Unit 
### 
Consensus overwhelmingly in fa
vor of building a new boathouse was
found by five Daily reporters when
they conducted personal interviews
with random students at various
spots about the campus yesterday.
Results of the census bore out
statistics compiled Tuesday by The
Daily which indicated that 95 per
cent of Stanford women and 87 per
cent of the men use the Lagunita
boathouse at least once during spring
quarter.
Typical statements gathered by re
porters ran the gamut from enthu
siasm to mere agreement, and were
very much as follows:
"GOOD IDEA''
"Good idea, if we have the money
—absolutely necessary," John Part
ridge, graduate, Encina, Excom
member. Margo Craine '41, Lagunita,
"Yes, we need it." Dorothy Zeh '41,
Lagunita, "Margo's right."
Kenneth Neill '39, A.T.0., "I'm in
favor of it." Irvin Marlar '39, "En
tirely for it." Vincent Rodriguez '41,
Sequoia, "I think it should be built."
Tilford Denton '41, Phi Psi, "I think
we should have one." Lloyd Mc-
Donald '40, Delta Kappa Epsilon,

new one." E. P. Fay '41, "Put up a
new one with a dance floor and
fountain." Doc Vanderberg, gradu

one sometime." Bob Hammctt '41,
Encina, "Where is the money coming
from?"
"SPRING IS COMING"
Helen Schroder '42, Pi Phi, "We've
got to have one. Spring will be here
before long, and then—" Ed Curtis
'40, Sequoia, "The need justifies the
building." Marjorie McLaren, grad
uate, off-campus, "Place needed for
social activities at the lake."
Alma Dooling '41, Lagunita, "I
thought we would already have one
when we returned this year, con
sidering that the boathouse fell last
spring." Joe Cook '39, Sigma Chi,
"I'm in favor of it. The old one is
unsafe." Jeanne Thorburn '40, La

1 Myron Folsom '40, Theta Delta Chi,
j "We need a new one in the worst
way." Harry Clatworthy '39, Phi

Consensus overwhelmingly in fa
vor of building a new boathouse was
found by five Daily reporters when
they conducted personal interviews
with random students at various
spots about the campus yesterday.
Results of the census bore out
statistics compiled Tuesday by The
Daily which indicated that 95 per
cent of Stanford women and 87 per
cent of the men use the Lagunita
boathouse at least once during spring
quarter.
Typical statements gathered by re
porters ran the gamut from enthu
siasm to mere agreement, and were
very much as follows:
"GOOD IDEA''

—absolutely necessary," John Part
ridge, graduate, Encina, Excom
member. Margo Craine '41, Lagunita,
