# Greene Closes A.F.L. Session
## Delegates Attack New Deal, C.I.O. 
### 
CONVENTION HALL, HOUS
TON, Tex,. Oct. 13 (UP).—The 58th
annual convention of the American
Federation of Labor adjourned sine
die tonight after a stormy 11-day
session in which delegates fought
over peace overtures to the C.1.0.
and blasted away at some New Deal
policies but balked at general con
demnation of President Roosevelt
and his administration.
One of the convention's last acts
was to re-elect President William
Green, Secretary - Treasurer Frank
Morrison, and 15 vice-presidents.
San Francisco was chosen as the
1939 convention city over Hamilton,
Ont.; Buffalo, N.Y.; New Orleans,
and Atlantic City.
Green gaveled the sessions into
history tonight. And the federation's
battle with John L. Lewis and his
aides dominated the convention to
the end. Delegates and officers met
on Oct. 3 breathing fire against the
rebels and loudly proclaiming the
A. F. of L. emerged from the three
year struggle with a membership
of 5,000,000 —the largest in history.
