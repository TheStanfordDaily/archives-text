# Card Tilt 'Breeze,' Says Duck Coach
## Varsity Ire Aroused By Cole's Slur Team May Make Breeze into Galeâ€” Blowing Other Way 
### ABE JENKINS 
Bill Colo, the new line coach at |
the University of Oregon, may not 1
know it but he has brought the Stan
ford Indians out of a slump that may
result in victory for them tomorrow.
Cole, talking to another Confer
ence coach two weeks ago after the
Ducks' win over U.C.L.A., made a
slurring remark about Tiny's charges i
which, even if it were the gospel |
truth, was decidedly untactful. It |
seems that he was telling his coach- j
ing colleague about the rest of the
Oregon schedule.
"We have an open date next
week," so he is purported to- have
said, "and then we have a breather
with Stanford at Palo Alto on the
15th."
NEWS LEAKS OUT
Even the stadium walls have ears,
as Cole undoubtedly will find out,
and the news finally trickled down
onto the Indian practice field last
night that the Oregon crew looked
on the Card game as a little dummy
scrimmage before their trip east.
Tiny Thornhill's boys are noted
for their sensitivity and the thought
of their being a breather seems to
have lired them up as only such an
incident can. Last night every man
on the squad was ranting and raving
about "this guy Cole." No first rate
football team likes to be classed as
a bunch of goofs.
Aside from muttering dire threats
about the touted Ducks, the squad
went through another long practice
drill which was just about twice as
good as anything they have dis
played all week. The linemen were
down low, looking straight ahead,
and charging fast while the backs
moved with just a little more pre
cision and power.
Still, despite Cole's insinuations,
these Webfeet are a big, last outfit
with plenty of class, as witness their
wins over Washington State and the
Uclans.
GRAYBEAL BEST BACK
Their best breakaway back is
puny little Jay Graybeal, 160 pounds
of the best open field runner on the
Coast. Graybeal seldom starts but
always seems to get in on the mas
sacre before the afternoons are over.
The Oregon line will average well
over 200 with the backfield coming
precariously close to 190.
Tony Calvelli came back out of
isolation last night and wenl through
a lot of warmup exercise with Jack
Clark in sweatsuits. Calvelli will
stick around the Rest Home for two
more nights but all indications are
that he will be ready to start Sat
urday. Clark has little hopes of
being a starter. Bill Kirsch, with a
charley horse of mean proportions,
hasn't been suited up at all since the
Washington tSate game. His loss
at right half makes the substitution
problem for Hugh Gallarneau a
weighty matter, with John Casey as
the best of a slim crew.
ANDERSEN TO START
While Stan Andersen has been
troubled with sore leg muscles, he
is .slated to start at right tackle as a
running mate to By West. Pete
Zagar goes back to guard again
along with Cork Donahue.
Little Jack "Navy" Brenner didn't
get to touch the ball against the Cou
gars but Thornhill has been groom
ing him all week in case Pete F;iy
needs relief. Brenner might be just
the antidote needed for this rabbit
named Graybeal.
