IT WILL be a big sports week-end on the Stanford campus. So let's
put away the books and get in on tomorrow's full day of athletic
entertainment.
Soccer will begin the festivities at 10 o'clock on the field next door to
the varsity tennis courts. The Indians, an experienced group of booters,
will be their prime and should make quick work of San Mateo Junior
College.
Besides experienced American players, you will see veteran soccer
men from Turkey, Norway, Argentina, Germany, Spain, and France, all
contributing experience to the Card aggregation from nations where
soccer is the favorite game.

'"JpilE varsity football game with Oregon will, of course, be the main
event of the day. Stanford's crippled eleven will be facing a tough

team that has defeated some of the best in the conference.
Despite losses through injuries, the Cards can be
expected to make a better showing than they have
? earlier this season. Newly oriented guards will know
their position better, blocking will be improved, and
the added experience of two games and two weeks'
practice will make their whole game smoother.
Nobody doubts that Tex Oliver will bring a really
fine team into the stadium tomorrow afternoon. They'll
expect to find the center of the Stanford line a little

weak, and they'll be trying to get through there often. But they will find
that Stanford's reserve pivot men, although not up to Calvelli's caliber,
can still hold their own and with the aid of the other linemen will keep
the hole well corked.
So the Webfoot-Card contest will be a close one, and betters would
be safer placing their wagers on a roulette wheel.

R UT if you really want football entertainment, you'll be sorry if you
miss the Stanford Freshman-Salinas Junior Colelge game. It will
begin at 12, so go out to the stadium right after lunch, and you'll find
it well worth your while.
Stanford fans were worried considerably this year when only (10
freshman griddcrs appeared on the Farm, less than at any other col
lege in the conference. But came the pleasant discovery that those
few candidates, hailing from all over the United States, really knew
how to play hall.
They looked good when they swamped Pomona J. C. 39-0, but that was
hardly a test, because the southerners h;id nothing but eleven men in the
proper attire to give them the apparance of a football team. The real
test was to come when they were to meet a squad of 21 former high school
football captains and many other highly touted freshman gridders from
Southern California.
The Papooses quickly ran up 22 points and gave the Trobabes six. So
the frosh do have a fine team, and they'll put on a good show tomorrow-

Salinas J. C. has kept dopesters guessing this year.
Reports came from all directions that the Salinas hoys
had one of the finest grid teams in its class. Then
they came up to play Menlo Jaysee, and lost 18-12.
This would not have looked so good for Salinas, ex
cept that Menlo's three touchdowns followed three
fumbles hy Salinas within its own 20-yard line.
Several reserves who have shown up well in prac
tice will have a chance to show their skill tomorrow.

Outstanding among these will be ART RASMUSSEN. who will be in at
fullback behind FRANK ALBERT, star fullback of the Papooses who is
bothered with a knee injury. Rasmussen is a fast ball-carrier and he
makes some pretty passes. A game or two will give him all he needs in
the way of experience to put him up with the best.
PETE KMETOVIC carries the ball from a half spot with phenomenal
speed and a change of pace that fools the best tacklers. His fine punt
returns make him outstanding safety man on the squad. JOHN STUR
GEON. light fast halfback who turned in an excellent blocking perform
ance against the Trobabes, has not yet recovered from stomach injuries,
and DON GRANT, splendid defensive back, and AL WOOL, 145-pounder,
wiil alternate in the spot. Wool is speedy and the best punter on the
squad.
