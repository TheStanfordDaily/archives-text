# Card Frosh to Face Salinas; Injuries Hit Both Teams
## 
### 
A couple of injury-riddled foot
ball squads will stagger onto the
stadium turf tomorrow at .12 o'clock
to play the preliminary to the Stan
ford-Oregon game.
It will be a case of Coach Harry
Shipkey's Cardinal Papooses trying
to out-stagger Salinas Junior Col
lege. With three of the yearlings'
better backfield men slated to sit on
the bench, the Lettuce Belt aggre
gation is in a good spot to spring an
upset.
The only trouble seems to be that j
Salinas isn't in such good shape j
either, so it looks like the squad that
can manipulate its crutches fastest
will grab the nod.
Neither John Sturgeon, regular
right half, or Paul Blanton, second '

string left half, is in good enough
shape to play tomorow. The third
non-combatant is Ray Durham, sub
fullback, who has a bad cold verging
on the flu. All three of these men,
especially Sturgeon, were important
cogs in the Papoose machine.
Press notices from Salinas don't
say just who is on their injury list,
but the press agent was very sure
that somebody was hurt. His tears
liberally sprinkled his notices.
There are no less than nine out
of-state players listed on the Sa
linas roster, including men from such
distant points as Louisiana, New
Jersey, and New York.
There are only 12 letters in the
Hawaiian alphabet.
