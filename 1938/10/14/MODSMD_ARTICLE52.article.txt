# Bruin Editor Touts Oregon Webfoot Team
## New Coach Brings Success to Last Year's Cellar Team 
### JOHN ROTHWELL 
Sports Editor. U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin :
They've asked me to tell you I
something about Oregon and this |
man Tex Oliver. It seems like a I
dirty dig, but they say I oughta l
know.
You see. our Bruins down at U. C.
L. A. had a little mix-up with the
parties in question a couple of |
weeks ago at Eugene. Now I'd like
to forget most of the things that hap
pened up there, except maybe the
climate and scenery, or that cute !
little Chi O.
But that doesn't seem to be what
your Messrs. Press and Shallen- j
berger want. They said you'd like \
to hear something about the Web- j
foots and Oliver, in a football way. j
COACH, TEAM CLICK
Well, the Webfoots are good, and
Oliver is swell. And put the two to
gether and you have a combination
that should give you plenty of wor
ried moments tomorrow afternoon.
It seems remarkable that a new
coach could take over a football
team that barely escaped the con- !
ference cellar last year and, inno- |
vating his own system of play, pro- j
duce a consistent winner the first
season. Yet that is just what the I
genial Tex has done at Oregon.
While Oliver's style obviously has I
its good points, and is a vast im- I
provement over Oregon offensives of j
the past, the chief power in the new I
Webfoot combination is in the spirit |
that has been aroused. The boys are !
all for Tex, and Tex is all for the j
boys. Together, they are all for
victory.
OLIVER WANTS WINS
I had the pleasure of talking to i
Oliver in the north, and he revealed '
his main ambition was to win games, j
Asked how he liked Oregon com- J
pared with his former posts at j
Santa Ana J. C. and Arizona, Tex j
replied, "Well, I like to win. So as i
long as we don't lose, I'll get along j
fine here."
Questioned concerning his unique J
venture of sitting in the press box |
during Oregon's games, Oliver re- i
vealed that it was no new trick with
him. He has done it ever since he j
first started sitting on the gymna
sium roof to watch a high school â– 
team of his perform.
His object is to personally run his !
own team. Ordinarily, grid coaches :
have their lookouts posted in the 1
stands, or in the press box, and they J
report their observations to the j
bench.
NEW WAY SUCCEEDS
"Sometimes the opposition would !
score a touchdown while I would be j
checking up on my scout's report," |
Oliver said. "But now as soon as I (
n Aice a weakness on the field, I can j
immediately make a change to rec- j
tify i*. It eliminates a sometimes
tragic waste of time."
