# Boathouse Afloat
## 
### 
WITH Stanford's stamp of approval on the
proposal to build a new Boathouse, and
the committee work yesterday on definite
building plans, the Boathouse campaign is well
into the middle of the stream.
Although the vote cast was small, its unanim
ity takes on the properties of a landslide. There
can be little doubt now as to Stanford's attitude
on the proposal.
It'* BUILD—aII the way.
But now comes the real job. Two major prob
lems face Excom's subcommittee — finances,
and type of structure to be built.
Until definite estimates can be made—and
they will be when construction and architec
tural representatives confer this afternoon—
Stanford can only hope. But if James Mc-
Donnell's (Keeper of Buildings and Grounds)
rough estimate yesterday is correct —close to
$10,000 —Stanford may as well forget about the
whole affair.
But there is no need to be pessimistic yet.
The present structure was built for $1800
twenty-five years ago. It may be proportion
ally inexpensive now. Stanford can only spec
ulate hopefully for a few days, however, until
those plans and estimates can be made.
Concerning type of structure, much can be
said. Ideas will undoubtedly come from stu
dent designs submitted for the Boathouse Con
test. Suggestions have already been made to
outline general features which the new Boat
house must incorporate.
The main theme back of all plans, however,
must be simplicity and utility. Only an inex
pensive structure can be considered under any
circumstances. Only one which will bring
full value for the total investment should be
accepted.
In other words, Stanford can't afford to put its
money into a house with expensive trimmings,
into costly lounge rooms which probably will
never be used. The test case of the Nitery
seems to indicate that a similar addition to the
Boathouse would be simply casting bread upon
the waters—never to return.
This certainly does not mean that the Boat
house is to be a structure bare of the essential
properties of after-swim comfort. Without ques
tion some sort of provision should be made for
the lads and lassies who seek the Lake for
pleasant afternoons in the sun. This necessity
has been included in the committee's sugges
tions for plans of construction.
The practical obstacles to crystallize the Boat
house from an air-castle to a reality are innumer
able. But, unless cost is obviously prohibitive at
the outset, that crystallization can easily and
soon take place.
Stanford has given in no uncertain terms the
answer to the question, "Should Stanford have
a new Boathouse?"
The week-end will bring the answer to the
answer.
By Monday or Tuesday, the question may be
changed to a direct statement of fact:
Stanford will have a new Boathouse.
