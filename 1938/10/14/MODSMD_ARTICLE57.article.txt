GLOOM has descended on the Farm this
week, because Stanford doesn't seem to
think it's going to take Oregon tomorrow.
In which frame of mind, it's almost certain
that Stanford really will come out on the short
end of the score.
The foreboding atmosphere prevails prima
rily because sports writers everywhere have
been almost deluged with guantities of Oregon
publicity have become fascinated with Oli
ver's genius as a tactician, which is proved by
his plan to mount the press box for a vantage
point.
This means nothing, however, since the Stan
ford side of the picture looks more like the
following:
Inside views of secret practices on the Farm
show that the Indian eleven has improved as

much this last week us it did before it tangled
with W.S.C. last Saturday, although nobody
will admit it.
Statisticians, lost in a maze of abstract com
parisons, so far seem to have forgotten that
Oregon only beat W.S.C. by exactly the same
margin that Stanford did —8 points, 10 to 2.
Thornhill's new combination proved that it
had the stuff last Saturday; this week, that stuff
has acquired polish.
All that's needed now is enthusiastic sup
port.
If the Cards get that, then one slightly torn
Red Machine with papier-mache rollers won't
be for sale cheap tomorrow night.—H. L. S.
