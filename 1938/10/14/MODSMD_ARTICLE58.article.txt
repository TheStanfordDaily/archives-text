OCR ECONOMIC OSTRICH
A LTHOUGH the recent barrage of letters from the
Thirty Dollars Every Thursday trenches has
ceased, it seems that a few non-combatants were
frightened by the heavy firing. This morning, one of
them crouches in the Campus Opinion shellhole and
tries to convince himself that there is nothing to be
afraid of.
After struggling for two paragraphs to create an
impression of composure and lofty unconcern, the
gentleman who signs Palo Altan, concludes, "I be
lieve that the significance of the $30 Thursday plan
is this, and this only: The aged and those approaching
old age without economic security want security."
If the first part of this declaration were as sound as
the last half, our correspondent would be impregnable.
But when Palo Altan coyly turns his back on the world
like the Lady of Shalott, declaring that the Thirty
Thursday smoke-dream has no other significance, he
tangles himself in wishful thinking. His reasoning is
the economic equivalent of that brand of psychiatry
which makes its patients repeat with savage cheerful
ness, "Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and
better."
Unfortunately, the effects of the Ham and Eggs
program are not limited to a demonstration of the
theory that the aged desire security. As experts have
pointed out, enforcement of the plan would dismem
ber our whole economic system. And the consequences
of such a financial axe murder are never limited to
mere demonstration of an academic principle.
* * * *
IF the warrants are accepted, as the Apostles of
Plenty assure us they will be, the amount of cir
culating media in California will be increased. That
is inflation, which means that there will be deprecia
tion.
But the warrants will not be accepted, unless the
Thirty Dollar prophets can bring pressure to bear and
get the Holy Trinity to endorse each one personally.
Out-of-state business men will not take payment in
useless coupons. They would probably prefer the
cigar store variety where at least they can save up
for a smoking jacket or a new can opener.
* * * *
And so the plan cannot succeed. Instead, it will
bury California in a mass of depreciated warrants.
Anyone on a fixed income who is forced to take it in
warrants will find his wages quietly shrinking, like
an evaporating puddle of water.
The people who expect Ihe enactment of the dream
to create a glowing new world will be disappointed.
And historians tell very pretty stories of the violence
which follows the dull misery of disappointment.
And yet our correspondent tells us that if the plan
is carried it will be by the votes of intelligent people
who "need security and hope that this plan will be a
step in the right direction. Placidly he soothes himself.
Because we need a pension plan we should adopt this
one. ev*n if it is unsound. Because we need a mouth
wash, we should gargle with cyanide, even if it is a
little hard on the delicate membranes.
Palo Altan smirks at the mirror, telling himself,
"There's nothing to worry about."
And next to a year's prepaid membership, that is
about the best thing the Thirty Dollar leaders could
ask.

And so the plan cannot succeed. Instead, it will

Anyone on a fixed income who is forced to take it in

an evaporating puddle of water.

one. ev*n if it is unsound. Because we need a mouth

Palo Altan smirks at the mirror, telling himself,

A LTHOUGH the recent barrage of letters from the
Thirty Dollars Every Thursday trenches has
ceased, it seems that a few non-combatants were
frightened by the heavy firing. This morning, one of
them crouches in the Campus Opinion shellhole and
tries to convince himself that there is nothing to be
afraid of.
After struggling for two paragraphs to create an
impression of composure and lofty unconcern, the
gentleman who signs Palo Altan, concludes, "I be
lieve that the significance of the $30 Thursday plan
is this, and this only: The aged and those approaching
old age without economic security want security."
If the first part of this declaration were as sound as
the last half, our correspondent would be impregnable.
But when Palo Altan coyly turns his back on the world
like the Lady of Shalott, declaring that the Thirty
Thursday smoke-dream has no other significance, he
tangles himself in wishful thinking. His reasoning is
the economic equivalent of that brand of psychiatry
which makes its patients repeat with savage cheerful
ness, "Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and
better."
Unfortunately, the effects of the Ham and Eggs
program are not limited to a demonstration of the
theory that the aged desire security. As experts have
pointed out, enforcement of the plan would dismem
ber our whole economic system. And the consequences
of such a financial axe murder are never limited to
mere demonstration of an academic principle.

IF the warrants are accepted, as the Apostles of
Plenty assure us they will be, the amount of cir
culating media in California will be increased. That
is inflation, which means that there will be deprecia
tion.
But the warrants will not be accepted, unless the
Thirty Dollar prophets can bring pressure to bear and
get the Holy Trinity to endorse each one personally.
