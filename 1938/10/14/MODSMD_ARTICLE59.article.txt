# Lightly... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
FEW weeks ago some man called up Casa Ven
tura, the new women's residence next door to
Sequoia.
"I'm going to be away for a few days," he said
over the phone. "Could you take care of my dog for
me while I'm gone?"
The woman who answered the phone said, thinking
on her feet, "No, it's full here now."
In no time at all the phone rang again:
"My dog is very dirty. Could you wash him for
me?"
"Well—l'll see if anyone here wants to wash a dog."
She kept her hand over the mouthpiece of (he phone
for quite a while as if she wer finding out*if someone
wanted to wash a dog. If whoever calling her was
having his fun, she was going to have her fun, too.
Back at the phone again she said. "I think we can
wash it for you, but it depends on what kind of a job
you want."
"Well "
"Does he have fleas?"
"Well, yes."
"Do you want the fleas washed off, or do you want
them plucked of! one by one?"
"Just wash them off," said a very confused voice.
Then the wise woman thought she had had enough.
"I'm sorry. We can't wash your dog for you. What
number were you calling?" The quite baffled man
told her he thought he had the Menlo Boarding
Kennels.
She looked the number up in the phone book, The
Menlo Boarding Kennels have the same number that
Casa Ventura has.

now and then any number of interesting
things come in over the phone. At The Daily
today someone asked us if this were King Tut's
Gardens.
And a friend of mine called up one of the womoji's
cottages the other night. He cold hear the girl who
answered the phone yelling, "Step on it Paula—it's
a man!"
This is pure nonsense: One of this year's frosh had
to ask a sponsor what the word "morals" meant. He
was later elected president of his corridor.
Another of the frosh asked if the Frosh Bible were
Old or New Testament.
One of last year's frosh women was telling the
other day of the dance she went to last year where it
was so crowded that someone danced right between
her and her escort. Imagine that.

This leaves me with absolutely no comment: A
friend of mine sent his blankets to the cleaners a
year ago Christmas. He got them back two weeks
ago.
