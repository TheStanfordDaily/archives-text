STANDING LIKE an ice-housc on the edge of an Indian slough, the
Boathouse stands out on Stanford's campus like a boil on a peachcs
and-cream complexion. It was taken Tuesday, as the weather-beaten
old hulk turned her scaly sides to the afternoon sun. Note the wreck-

age left last spring when the diving- platform collapsed. For one
quarter of the year, the unsightliness of the hoathouse is diminished
by the attractiveness of its setting. But for the other two quarters
no one hut a mother could love it. (Photo hy Gardner Miller)
