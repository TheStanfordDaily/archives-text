# CAMPUS OPINION
## $30-THURSDAY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I must express my great pity for
the $30-Thursday Leader, for your
correspondent who is Interested, for
Mr. Cuthbertson, and for Mr. Cobbs.
They have calumnied, threatened,
scorned and pitied each other and
your sighing readers are just where
they were before it all started. Ex
cept for their self-revelation all this
writing has accomplished no more,
Mr. Editor, than your Hearstian
blast at the highway taverns.
The new cult of Fifth-day Adven
tists is merely hoping to patch our
groaning economic machine with a
strand of rusty haywire they found
in Mr. Townsend's back yard. The
threat of the Leader, the substitute
plan of Interested, the bellowing of
Mr. Cuthbertson, and the tall figures
of speech of Mr. Cobbs discolor an
atmosphere that ought to be cleared.
I believe that the significance of
the $30-Thursday plan is this, and
this only:
The aged and those approaching
old age without economic security
want security. The specialists with
the letters after their names have no
remedy, so these old people go from
one economic chiropractor to an
other. The cure for indigent old age
has not been discovered. Until there
is a cure, aloof intellectuals like Mr.
Cobbs need not waste fragrant syn
onyms on cranks who like to follow
the current Messiah.
INDICATION OF NEED
The $30-Thursday plan is simply
an indication of a need. If it should
be carried it will not be carried by
the votes of those unintelligent
enough to know that the plan will
work, but by those who need secur
ity and hope that this plan will be
a step in the direction of providing
it. Something for nothing is not the
dream of these people. They believe
that industry should not cast them
off without means of support. Sur
vival of the fittest went out some
years ago in our social thinking, but
economically we're a little tardy.
So, Mr. Cobbs, instead of spending
so much time with Roget looking
for witty things to say about the

Leader and Mr. Cuthbertson, let
your column lack a few similes or
let The Daily lack a column now
and then and figure out a pension
plan of your own. Maybe if enough
intelligent people got to thinking
about the problem we'd someday
evolve something workable.

Mr. Cuthbertson, and the tall figures
of speech of Mr. Cobbs discolor an
atmosphere that ought to be cleared.
I believe that the significance of
the $30-Thursday plan is this, and
this only:
The aged and those approaching
old age without economic security
want security. The specialists with
the letters after their names have no
remedy, so these old people go from
one economic chiropractor to an
other. The cure for indigent old age
has not been discovered. Until there
is a cure, aloof intellectuals like Mr.
Cobbs need not waste fragrant syn
onyms on cranks who like to follow
the current Messiah.
INDICATION OF NEED
The $30-Thursday plan is simply
an indication of a need. If it should
be carried it will not be carried by
the votes of those unintelligent
enough to know that the plan will
work, but by those who need secur
ity and hope that this plan will be
a step in the direction of providing
it. Something for nothing is not the
dream of these people. They believe
that industry should not cast them
off without means of support. Sur
vival of the fittest went out some
years ago in our social thinking, but
economically we're a little tardy.
So, Mr. Cobbs, instead of spending
so much time with Roget looking
for witty things to say about the

Leader and Mr. Cuthbertson, let
your column lack a few similes or
let The Daily lack a column now
and then and figure out a pension
plan of your own. Maybe if enough
intelligent people got to thinking
about the problem we'd someday
evolve something workable.

The Editor, Sir:
I must express my great pity for
the $30-Thursday Leader, for your
correspondent who is Interested, for
Mr. Cuthbertson, and for Mr. Cobbs.
They have calumnied, threatened,
scorned and pitied each other and
your sighing readers are just where
they were before it all started. Ex
cept for their self-revelation all this
writing has accomplished no more,
Mr. Editor, than your Hearstian
blast at the highway taverns.
The new cult of Fifth-day Adven
tists is merely hoping to patch our
groaning economic machine with a
strand of rusty haywire they found
in Mr. Townsend's back yard. The
threat of the Leader, the substitute
plan of Interested, the bellowing of
Mr. Cuthbertson, and the tall figures
of speech of Mr. Cobbs discolor an
atmosphere that ought to be cleared.
