Re: Building of a boathouse, at
present being considered by Ex Com
mittee.
1. New structure needed if exist
ing facilities of the lake arc to con
tinue available to students.
2. Possibility exists that by an in
crease in expenditure over vyhat is
needed to build just a boathouse,
other desirable facilities may be
provided.
Reference has been made in your
columns to the large number of stu
dents lacking cars and funds who
are limited in their choice of enter
tainment. Probably even those who
need not hesitate about their enter
tainment for financial reasons would
be willing to O.K. expenditure of
funds by the A.S.S.U. for erection
of a building which would be used
for more than a single quarter in
the year and for more than a special
form of enjoyment.
GOOD INVESTMENT
Whether a building intended to be
more than just a boathouse would
ever be used by students to the full
extent of its capabilities is the ques
tion to be settled before funds are
allocated. A boathouse alone is a
good investment because it will be
fully used.
There are groups on the campus
which specialize in providing enter
tainment. Possibly with the in
creased facilities provided by a more
elaborate building, these groups
could aid in solving some of the dif
ficulties of the students such as
"Where to take a girl under 21 if
she doesn't care for lectures and
the opera," or "How to go with the
crowd if the crowd is traveling in
automobiles," and so on.
