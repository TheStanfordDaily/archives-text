Refugees: ANARCHY OR ORGANI
ZATION, by Dorothy Thompson
Today there are more than 9,000.- i
000 refugees in the world. Wander
ing exiles, "men without a coun- |
try," the innocent victims of eco- '
nomic and political persecution, |
their fate is rapidly becoming an in- ■
ternational problem of the first |
magnitude.
Dorothy Thompson has recognized ,
the problem and in this vigorous j
little book, she discusses a plan to
meet it. She proposes that an "In- |
ternational Resettlement Company" j
be formed by agreements between
nations. This company could float
loans through the support of the
United States that would be used to |
start settlements in countries that j
can use immigrants.
According to Miss Thompson, the i
financial problems of her plan are j
the biggest ones, and yet the most!
easily solved. "How easy it would I
be for England, for example, to ad
vance $5,000,000 to back the interest
on a $20,000,000 loan. II the United
States would agree to deduct it from j
the war debt, it would cost England
nothing that she does not already |
owe, and alongside the $5,000,000,000 '
total that Great Britain owes us, it I
would be nothing to us, either.
There is room and need for mil- ;
lions of people in many countries of:
the world. Brazil, for example, has i
vast areas of fertile land that could j
absorb an enormous number of |
people. And the solution must be j
found, for in two years, unless j
something is done, there will be j
more homeless people than there are j
people in Canada.
Dorothy Thompson's book is time- i
ly and is interesting reading. She I
has a vivid earnestness about her i
writing that imparts some of the
enthusiasm to the reader. Miss
Thompson, wife of Sinclair Lewis, is
a noted correspondent and commen
tator, and has been seriously men
tioned as • presidential timber for
1940.

Refugees: ANARCHY OR ORGANI
ZATION, by Dorothy Thompson
Today there are more than 9,000.- i
000 refugees in the world. Wander
ing exiles, "men without a coun- |
try," the innocent victims of eco- '
nomic and political persecution, |
their fate is rapidly becoming an in- ■
ternational problem of the first |
magnitude.
Dorothy Thompson has recognized ,
the problem and in this vigorous j
little book, she discusses a plan to
meet it. She proposes that an "In- |
ternational Resettlement Company" j
be formed by agreements between
nations. This company could float
loans through the support of the
United States that would be used to |
start settlements in countries that j
can use immigrants.
According to Miss Thompson, the i
financial problems of her plan are j
the biggest ones, and yet the most!
easily solved. "How easy it would I
be for England, for example, to ad
vance $5,000,000 to back the interest
on a $20,000,000 loan. II the United
States would agree to deduct it from j
the war debt, it would cost England
nothing that she does not already |
owe, and alongside the $5,000,000,000 '
total that Great Britain owes us, it I
would be nothing to us, either.
There is room and need for mil- ;
lions of people in many countries of:
the world. Brazil, for example, has i
vast areas of fertile land that could j
absorb an enormous number of |
people. And the solution must be j
found, for in two years, unless j
something is done, there will be j
more homeless people than there are j
people in Canada.
Dorothy Thompson's book is time- i
ly and is interesting reading. She I
has a vivid earnestness about her i
writing that imparts some of the
enthusiasm to the reader. Miss
Thompson, wife of Sinclair Lewis, is
a noted correspondent and commen
tator, and has been seriously men
tioned as • presidential timber for
