# Gaieties Committee Picks Eleven Melodies for Show
## 
### 
From a deluge of 76 songs sub
mitted to them, the Gaieties Com
mittee announces the following 11
as definitely accepted:
"Forever and Ever" by Jim Stone,
"Tunei n on Love" and "Friday at
the Libe" both by Buddy Lees,
"Blue Moonlight," "It Takes Two
to Pass a Test," and "Miss MufTett"
by Bucky Henshaw, "Stanford in the
Rain" by Bob Malott, "Susan" and
"Moon Goes Down" both by Bob
Stavor, "Look Out for Love" by J. P.
Cahn, and "Whenever I'm with
You" by Hank Rhodes.
The judges, Shirley Jones, J. P.
Cahn, Gene Callnon, Gordy Wil

liams, Jack Dawson, and Myron
Bimbaum, arc still considering sev
eral songs.
Today from 4 to 6 o'clock in the
Memorial Theater, J, P. Cahn will
interview the 150 vocalists who
turned out for the tryouts last Mon
day.
It has been impossible for the
committee to assign definite parts
since the show is not yet well
enough integrated. However, "defi
nite," "probable," and "rejected,"
lists have been made out. Cahn will
let the tryoutees know where they
stand in their interviews today, and
Monday's Daily will publish a ten
tative cast.
