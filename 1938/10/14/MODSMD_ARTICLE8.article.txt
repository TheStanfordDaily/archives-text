# Last Tryout Held By Stagers Today
## 
### 
Stagers will hold final tryouts to
day from 4 to 6 o'clock in the Little
Theater for the reading of "Tower
of Nesle" by Dumas, to be presented
toward the end of next week, ac
cording to Gordy Williams.
There are parts available for
women. One for a beautiful, vicious
queen, another for her attendant,
and the third for someone who can
read stage directions in such a way
as to get the atmosphere over to the
audience.
There arc 10 male parts open, of
fering a good chance for men with
no experience to take a fling at
campus dramatics. Two of the male
parts are romantic leads. Participa
tion in the reading will not inter
fere with the Gaieties.
