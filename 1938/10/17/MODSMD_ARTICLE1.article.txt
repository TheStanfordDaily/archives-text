## 
### 
Tackling the real problems of construction, Excom's Boathouse Com
mittee met Friday afternoon with Marty Martinez of Charles Wagner &
Co.. and E. P. YVeihe, representing the architectural firm of Bakcwell &
Weihe.
From the session came the assurance that some estimation of cost, and
a rough draft of plans would be ready this afternoon for examination by
the committee. From these rough estimates, a proposal embodying cost

and design will be presented before
Ex Committee tomorrow night for
approval or disapproval.

WAGNER, WEIHE FAVORABLE

Both Wagner and Weihe expressed
themselves favorably to the sugges
tions presented by the committee on
features to be embodied in the Boat
house-to-be. These ideas included
provisions for sun-bathing and af
ter-swim relaxation,, two student
rooms, dressing rooms for bathers,
a separate diving platform, and ade
quate space for canoes and equip
ment.
The possibility that final choice
of entries in the student Boathouse
committee could be used in drawing
up designs for the new Boathouse
was discussed with the construction
representatives. Both believed that
the prize plan probably could be
used as a basis for the actual design.

In the meantime, however, the
architectural firm will draw up an
outline of the new building.
The committee was hopeful that
from this afternoon's meeting with
Wagner and Weihe would come
definite enough proposals to termi
nate further discussion and to allow
Ex Committee to make some sort of
final decision on the matter tomor
row night.
If, however, financial difficulties

necessary to bring the Boathouse
campaign to a successul conclusion.
