# Churchill Warns U.S. To Move
## Democracies Urged To Band Together Against Dictators 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 16 (UP).—Win
ston Churchill, accused by Chan
cellor Adolf Hitler of trying to fo
ment war against Germany, tonight
appealed to the United States in a
trans-Atlantic radio speech to join
with Great Britain "before it is too
late" and halt the aggressions of the
dictators.
The fiery-tongued Churchill, war
time First Lord of the Admiralty and
now the severest critic of Britain's
"knuckling down" to the totalita
rian powers, said it was futile for
the American people to talk of wash
ing their hand* of Europe's troubles.
Churchill, who has held virtually
every post in the British government
except Prime Minister and who is

.the leading exponent of the might
iest air force in the world for Britain,
said the democracies must band to
gether without delay.

TAKE UP THE CAUSE'

"We are left no doubt as to whei'e
American convictions and sympa
thies lie, but will you wait until
British freedom and independence
succumb and then take up the cause,
when it is three-quarters ruined,
yourselves alone?" he asked.
"I hear they are saying in the
United States that because England
and France failed to do their duty,
therefore the American people can
wash their hands of the whole busi
ness.
"This may be a passing mood of
many people but there is no sense
in it.
"If things have become much
worse then all the more we must
try to cope with them."
A week ago today Hitler, speaking
at Saarbrucken on the Rhine, an
nounced plans to extend his western
frontier .fortifications and said he
distrusted Britain because Church
ill, former Foreign Secretary An
thony Eden and former First Lord of
the Admiralty Alfred Duff Cooper
might come into power. Their am
bition, he said, "would be to start
a conflagration. . . . They admit
this . . . and this forces us to be
on guard."

I DEMOCRACY DEFEATED

"What we must recognize," said
Churchill in his radio talk, "is that
parliamentary democracies and lib
eral and peaceful forces everywhere
have sustained defeat.
"This leaves them weaker morally
and physically to cope with the dan
gers which have grown vastly.
"If ever there was a time when
men and women who cherish the
ideals of the founders of the British
and American constitutions should
take earnest counsel with one an
other that time is now."

take earnest counsel with one an
other that time is now."
LONDON, Oct. 16 (UP).—Win
ston Churchill, accused by Chan
cellor Adolf Hitler of trying to fo
ment war against Germany, tonight
appealed to the United States in a
trans-Atlantic radio speech to join
with Great Britain "before it is too
late" and halt the aggressions of the
dictators.
The fiery-tongued Churchill, war
time First Lord of the Admiralty and
now the severest critic of Britain's
"knuckling down" to the totalita
rian powers, said it was futile for
the American people to talk of wash
ing their hand* of Europe's troubles.
Churchill, who has held virtually
every post in the British government
except Prime Minister and who is

.the leading exponent of the might
iest air force in the world for Britain,
said the democracies must band to
gether without delay.

TAKE UP THE CAUSE'

"We are left no doubt as to whei'e
American convictions and sympa
thies lie, but will you wait until
British freedom and independence
succumb and then take up the cause,
when it is three-quarters ruined,
yourselves alone?" he asked.
"I hear they are saying in the
United States that because England
and France failed to do their duty,
therefore the American people can
wash their hands of the whole busi
ness.
"This may be a passing mood of
many people but there is no sense
in it.
"If things have become much
worse then all the more we must
try to cope with them."
A week ago today Hitler, speaking
at Saarbrucken on the Rhine, an
nounced plans to extend his western
frontier .fortifications and said he
distrusted Britain because Church
ill, former Foreign Secretary An
thony Eden and former First Lord of
the Admiralty Alfred Duff Cooper
might come into power. Their am
bition, he said, "would be to start
a conflagration. . . . They admit
this . . . and this forces us to be
on guard."

I DEMOCRACY DEFEATED

"What we must recognize," said
Churchill in his radio talk, "is that
parliamentary democracies and lib
eral and peaceful forces everywhere
have sustained defeat.
"This leaves them weaker morally
and physically to cope with the dan
gers which have grown vastly.
"If ever there was a time when
men and women who cherish the
ideals of the founders of the British
and American constitutions should
take earnest counsel with one an
other that time is now."
