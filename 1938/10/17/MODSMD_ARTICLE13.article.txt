# 21 Candles for Mrs. Roosevelt
## 
### 

ALTHOUGH MRS. FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT says that she pre
fers to forget birthdays and stay young, two parties were arranged in
Washington, D.C., in honor of her 54th birthday. And in keeping with
a Roosevelt family custom for those over 21, the cakes bore only 21
candles. She is shown above with Hope Ridings Miller, president of
the Women's Press Club, cutting the cake at the Press Club party.
