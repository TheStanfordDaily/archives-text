# Cast, Skits Chosen For Big Game Gaieties
## 
### 
From a score of 300 of the Farm's talented, the Gaieties committee—
(consisting of Shirley Jones, J. P. Cahn, Jack Dawson, Gene Callnon,
Gordy Williams, and Myron Birnbaum—last Friday night chose a tenta
tive cast for the pre-Big Game show. After a five weeks' incubation the
following will hatch as the '38 Gaieties stars:

* Vocalists — Pat Bernard, Shirley
Jones, Eloise Lambert, Bill Brigham,
Audrey Clark, Ray Stahl, and Ed
Wearin.
Performers—Lome Samuels, Bar
bara Thrasher, Jack Dawson, Aubrey
Austin, The Moscovics, The Zooks,
Charlie Bulotti, Harry Muheim, Dana
Winters, Kit Benet, Mary Dickey,
Hugh Hinman, Margaret Paulson,
Gerry Schrieber.
To this list of performers, prob
ably will be added Everett Hoffman,
Asher Williams, Ribot Valiton, J.
Lyons, Frances Daw, Barbara
Sweetland, Mike Drury, Carol
Hover, Florence Alden, Steve Nick
lesberg, Jan Lett in, Tony Ceferrati,
Bucky Henshaw, Mel Mack, Lucy
Day Bell, Betty Moses, Buddy Lees,
Eleanor Steventon, David Jackson,
Helen Schroder, and Maurice Knox.
Performers will be selected from
the last list according to the de
mands of the show.
In making these selections the
committee had had to reject many
first-rate performers because their
acts did not fit into the show.
Today students who submitted
scripts for the Gaieties may call for
them at the Dramatics Office, up
stairs from the A.S.S.U. offices.
A note about the last skit: al
though the Chi Psis are unaware of
it, their after-dinner entertainment
along the lines of the swing-craze
was the inspiration used by dinner
guest J. P. Cahn for a skit.
