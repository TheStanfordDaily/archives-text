## First on Schedule Will Be Pre-U.S.C. Jolly-up on Friday 
### 
When approximately 300 people
turned out at a day's notice for the
after-game dance last, Saturday,
Cardinals was convinced that Stan
ford docs want on-campus dances,
went ahead with its plans for future
dances.
First on the schedule is a three
hour jolly-up next Friday after
noon, the day before the U.S.C.
game.
"We have a very strong chance of
getting a big name band down from
the city for the jolly-up," Bill Hawk
ins, Cardinal dance committee chair
man, said yesterday.

U.S.C. LEADERS INVITED

U.S.C. campus leaders will be in
vited, and a short rally will be held
during t.he jolly-up, he announced.
A similar jolly-up-rally was held
last year before the U.C.L.A. game.
The name of the orchestra chosen
and the place the jolly-up will be
held will be announced later, prob
ably Wednesday night when Cardi
nals meet. According to current
plans, there will be no dance, how
ever, after the game Saturday.

HAWKINS COMMENTS

Speaking of last Saturday's game,
Hawkins said, "The student body
responded very well. I thought it
was a good dance."
So, in response to the reception
given Ihe first after-game dance
this year, plans are being made for
a dance to be held here after the
Washington game, which comes No
vember 5, the week-end after the
U.C.L.A. game.
