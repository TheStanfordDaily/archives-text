# Initiation Week Date Changed
## 
### 
The dates for pledge week have
been changed, according to Bud Mc-
Duflie, president of (he Interfratcr
nity Council. "This action was
taken," said McDufTie, "because of
certain disadvantages and conflicts
which many of the houses faced as
a result of the plans previously an
nounced."
The change was made at the
meeting of the Interfraternity Coun
cil held at the Phi Delta Tlieta house
October 13.
No announcement of the dates of
the new pre-initiation period will bo
made other than to the house presi
dents, according to the announce
ment. of this council. There will
also be no change made in the su
pervised pledge week program as
adopted by last, year's council,
which was regarded as a construc
tive and progressive move both by
the University administration and
fraternity leaders all over the
country.
