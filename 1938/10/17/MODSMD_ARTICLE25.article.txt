# Card Comeback Plucks Feathers
## Webfoots Fall before Inspired Play Of Indian Team; Zagar Regains Form 
### ARCH JENKINS 
The University of Oregon football team is on its way lo New York
today after being subjected to an afternoon of underdog psychology las(
Saturday by the doddering old Stanford Indian.
The Ducks had dropped down to the Farm on a side trip of their
Gotham expedition to scrimmage the Cards in what had been termed a

►"breather" by their own admission;
thoy left yesterday toppled from the
ranks of the undefeated and out of
the conference championship race
simply because the lowly Indian
gathered up enough inspiration from
somewhere to smack the Wcbfeel,
27 to 16.

WIN IS MYSTERY

No one has offered any suggestion
as to what created the Stanford up
set, win. Undoubtedly the assertion
of the Oregon line coach that they
would take the Indians in a walk
had something to do with it.
Maybe the team wanted to win for
little Pete Fay, their spark-plug left
halfback, who is in the hospital with
a streptococcus infection which will
keep him out of action for at, least
10 days. Maybe they wanted to win
for Thornhill.
But what, probably happened is
that the entire simply got tired
of being kicked around and razzed
in the newspapers and decided it,
was time to put on a display of
what they could do when heated to
the proper temperature.

DUCKS TAKE LEAD

The Indians spotted the Ducks 10
points on Nicholson's 31-yard first
quarter field goal and Jay Gray
beal's 54-yard sprint for a touch
down on a faked reverse. Nichol
son's trio of points was well de
served, but the Graybeal effort, was
a simple case of poor maneuvering
by the Stanford halfbacks and safety
man.
Graybeal hit the line like a flash
and came through without any in
terference to outrun easily a couple
of Indians who had dashed straight,
toward the scrimmage line instead
of trying to spear him with a diag
onal shot.
It was a typical Stanford first
quarter with the Thornhill crew
backed up too far to uncork anything
particularly hazardous. After the
Graybeal effort, Freddie Ledeboer,
who called a beautiful set of plays
all afternoon, having been told that
Oregon's pass defense was set for
short shots over the line and in the
flats, called a long distance toss
from his own 45-yard line.

STOJKOVICII SCORES

Paulman handled the ball and
threw beautifully to Andy Stojko
vich, who was well in back of the
Duck safety man on the Oregon 30.
From there on in, "Stoke" went all
alone to score.
Just about two minutes later, the
Ducks with a 10-6 lead called a
reckless pass in their own territory
which Paulman stole on the 50. This
time Ledeboer picked out Stan
Graft all alone on the 25 and pitched
a perfect bullseye. Graff's run to
score was a mere matter of taking
steps.
The bettors who had picked Ore
gon by 2-to-l must have felt in fine
fettle at the start of the third quar
ter as a 70-yard sustained drive
drove holes in the Thornhill line in
just about the same fashion that
Santa Clara did. Gammon passed to
Reginato for G yards and to what
was to be the last Duck counter.

LINK STRONG

Stanford's linemen had been
playing better than usual. For the
first time all season, Pete Zagar
played as if he really had an attach
ment for the game. He, Hamp Pool,
and Corky Donahue stayed down
low and submarined under the bit;
Duck forwards to keep things in
fair control. But Stanford's line
backing was weakened without Tony
Calvelli, and what, should have been
one or two yard gains often went I
for seven or eight.
Zagar topped his best-ever show
with a brilliant block of Gebhardt's
attempted kick from" the Stanford 41
midway through the fourth frame, j
Bill Willard snatched up the ball on I
the Oregon 47 arid romped clear
home to give the home team a 20-Hi 1
lead—not good enough for a team as
strong as Oregon.
Tony Calvelli at center and Gene
Coldiron at quarter were in to slow
down the Webfoot backs from de
fensive fullback spots, and an at
tempted Duck drive ended with
Stanford getting the ball on downs
on the Oregon 40. Ledeboer, Hugh |
Gallarneau, and Jackie Brenner, a 1
most able sub for Fay, put on a
ground display that culminated in
Brenner's six-yard trip over guard I
for Stanford's first score on the 1
ground. That made the final score
27-16.
Oregon was big and possessed a
beautiful array of flashy backs, al- '
though Graybeal's weaknesses on
defense just about cancelled out his
breakaway ability.

BRENNER STOPS OFFENSE

Brenner stole much of Gray- j
beal's thunder and showed that he
can do things defensively that no J
other Stanford safety man has
shown all season. Zagar came
through with what will probably be j
termed his best game. Big Hamp i
Pool and Cork Donahue weren't far i
behind either, with Pool thrice stab- ;
bing Oregon backs from behind on
sure touchdown drives.
Paulman and Ledeboer passed ex
ceptionally well and Ledeboer lost ;
only one yard all afternoon, wind
ing up with a 2.8 average in 16 at
tempts, besides analyzing Duck
weaknesses in exceptional fashion.
The Indians still haven't shown an
ability to sustain an attack on the
ground. Yet they made their own
breaks and were even booming on
the ground at the final gun. Perhaps
they have found what potentialities
they really possess. It might be
U.S.C.'s fate to find out what they
can do with a combination of ex
cellent passing and aggressive
ground maneuvers.

China, are lending money to Japa
nese industrial projects in their
