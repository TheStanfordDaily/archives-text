### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 1G (UP).
— Mayor Angelo Rossi tonight
averted, for at least 24 hours, a
threatened major clash between
American Federation af Labor and
C.1.0. workers here by summoning
the principals of a warehouse-open
ing dispute to a peace conference in
his office tomorrow.
Rossi prevailed on the owners of
the Standard Liquors, Inc., ware
house not to upen their plant tomor
row, as planned, just as ihe rival
unions and police were preparing
for what might have been a serious
outbreak.

POLICE PROTECTION

At the same time the mayor said j
that regardless of the outcome of the j
emergency conference he would :
back up with adequate police pro- '
tection (he right of the liquor firm to I
operate its business, starting Tues- j
day morning.
The firm, managed by Orran I.
Grossman, attempted to open last ,
Monday with American Federation j
of Labor warehouse workers, but a ;
heavy C.1.0. warehousemen's picket j
line blocked the plans. After another 1
futile attempt to start business, ;
Grossman set the new date for to- j
morrow and Chief of Pojice William
Quinn mobilized 104 patrolmen to j
surround the plant and ordered re
serves held in readiness at all pre- j
cinct stations for a riot call.

PLANT ACCUSED

In picketing the new plant, the
C.1.0. contended Standard Liquors,
Inc., was a subterfuge devised by
leading liquor distributors to evade
the warehouse tie-up which has kept
closed 131 liquor, drug, grocery,
public, hardware and general ware
housing plants here for two months.
Eugene Paton, head of the ware-
International Longshoremen's and
housemen's union of Harry Bridges'
Warehousemen's Union, charged the
firm was organized by employers to
break the C.1.0. in the dispute over
employers' demands for a single
master contract covering all ware
houses.

EIRM IS INDEPENDENT

Grossman emphatically denied
these charges and said his firm was
an independent concern. He ap
pealed to Rossi for protection for
his plant and for the A. F. of L.
workers whom he had hired.
Rossi said he concurred in Gross
man's contention and guaranteed
police protection.
The dispute led Saturday to a
rupture of mediation conferences be
tween the C.1.0. warehousemen and
the Association of San Francisco
Distributors. The mediation was be
ing directed by Paul C. Smith, gen
eral manager of the San Francisco
Chronicle.
Smith was one of the persons sum
moned to the Rossi conference. Oth
ers were Paton and his attorney,
Henry Melnikow; Grossman and his
attorney, Sante Quattrin; John L.
McLaughlin and Joseph Casey of the
A. F. of L. Teamsters' Union, and

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 1G (UP).
— Mayor Angelo Rossi tonight
averted, for at least 24 hours, a
threatened major clash between
American Federation af Labor and
C.1.0. workers here by summoning
the principals of a warehouse-open
ing dispute to a peace conference in
his office tomorrow.
Rossi prevailed on the owners of
the Standard Liquors, Inc., ware
house not to upen their plant tomor
row, as planned, just as ihe rival
unions and police were preparing
for what might have been a serious
outbreak.

POLICE PROTECTION

At the same time the mayor said j
that regardless of the outcome of the j
emergency conference he would :
back up with adequate police pro- '
tection (he right of the liquor firm to I
operate its business, starting Tues- j
day morning.
The firm, managed by Orran I.
Grossman, attempted to open last ,
Monday with American Federation j
of Labor warehouse workers, but a ;
heavy C.1.0. warehousemen's picket j
line blocked the plans. After another 1
futile attempt to start business, ;
Grossman set the new date for to- j
morrow and Chief of Pojice William
Quinn mobilized 104 patrolmen to j
surround the plant and ordered re
serves held in readiness at all pre- j
cinct stations for a riot call.

PLANT ACCUSED

In picketing the new plant, the
C.1.0. contended Standard Liquors,
Inc., was a subterfuge devised by
leading liquor distributors to evade
the warehouse tie-up which has kept
closed 131 liquor, drug, grocery,
public, hardware and general ware
housing plants here for two months.
Eugene Paton, head of the ware-
International Longshoremen's and
housemen's union of Harry Bridges'
Warehousemen's Union, charged the
firm was organized by employers to
break the C.1.0. in the dispute over
employers' demands for a single
master contract covering all ware
houses.

EIRM IS INDEPENDENT

Grossman emphatically denied
these charges and said his firm was
an independent concern. He ap
pealed to Rossi for protection for
his plant and for the A. F. of L.
workers whom he had hired.
Rossi said he concurred in Gross
man's contention and guaranteed
police protection.
The dispute led Saturday to a
rupture of mediation conferences be
tween the C.1.0. warehousemen and
the Association of San Francisco
Distributors. The mediation was be
ing directed by Paul C. Smith, gen
eral manager of the San Francisco
Chronicle.
Smith was one of the persons sum
