Persons unknown jacked up a cat
belonging to John Greenwood, sen
ior resident of Branner Hall, in the
Branner-Toyon parking lot some
time last Saturday night and re

what Gordy Davis, campus officer,
concluded when he found the car
resting on the brakedrums yester
day morning.
At the game time Greenwood's
loss was discovered, it was found
that a canvas car-cover, belonging
to Jim Edmundson, a sophomore
| resident of Branner, had been tak
en from his automobile where it had
been parked next to Greenwood's
car.
Officer Davis said that a report of
the robbery and a description of the
wheels and cover would be sent to
the San Jose sheriff's office to be
wired throughout the state over the
teletype system. It is hoped that, if
the alleged thieves attempt to sell
loot anywhere, it can be identified.
Although this is the first robbery
of its kind on the campus this year,
Officer Davis cited several in past
| years and urged everyone who
i leaves his car out with a cover on it
Ito initial the cover with paint in
! large letters. He asserted he had
' never heard of a cover being stolen
if it was marked in this way.
