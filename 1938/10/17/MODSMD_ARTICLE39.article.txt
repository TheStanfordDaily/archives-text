# Frosh Dump Salinas In Slow Game, 13-6
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
Stanford's frosh griddcrs shifted
into low gear—almost neutral—last
Saturday, and as a result were
lucky to squeeze out a 13-6 win over
Salinas Junior College. By their
triumph, the Papooses managed to
keep their escutcheon unblemished
for the season, but they failed to
impress anybody with their prowess,
least of all Salinas.
The jay see boys were unanimous
in their opinions that the frosh were
over-rated, that their blocking
lacked steam, and that they would
have lost the game had not the
fourth quarter been shortened to
permit the varsity game to start on
schedule.

FROSH PASS TO SCORE

However, despite the fact that the
yearlings had to be content to score
quickly on two quick passing
thrusts in the third quarter, after a
scoreless first half, they outstatis
ticked the Lettuce Belt hoys deci
sively.
The jaysees had only two real
chances to score during the entire
game, one of which they made good,
while (he Cards were hounding the
Salinas goal line all day. In the
scoreless first half, for instance, the
Papooses lost the ball six times in
side their foes' 27, once on a fumble
and five times on downs.
Salinas' only scoring chance this
half came about midway through
the second quarter, when a series of
passes put the ball on Stanford's 31-
yard line. On the next play, Bill
Morasci, outstanding Salinas half
back, circled right end to the 21,
but the threat ended when the play
was called back because of a pen
alty.

STRIKE QUICKLY

The trosh wasted no time in the
second half getting their first touch
down, which came just three plays
after the kick-off. Starting from
Stanford's 36, Frankie Albert threw
one incomplete pass, then flipped a
shovel pass to Pete Kmetovic, cut
ting across to the right behind his
own line, which worked for 22 yards,
putting the ball on the Salinas 42. On
the next play, Kmetovic cut through
the jaysee secondary, took Albert's
bullet-pass on the 25 and rambled
to the touchdown. Albert fioozled
the kick for conversion.
On the first play following the
succeeding kick-off, A1 Wool inter
cepted Howard Shinn's pass and ran
it back 5 yards to the 40. This time
it took more time to get through the
sturdy Salinas defense, but 11 plays
later the frosh had their second
score.

ALBERT PITCHES

Two line bucks and a 10-yard pass |
from Albert to Kmetovic gave the j
Papooses a first down on the 28. Al
bert reared back and nailed Francis
with an 8-yard aerial, and on the
next play the latter bulled his way
(i yards for another first down on
the 14. Albert then slung an 8-yard
pass to Wool along the right side
lines, and two short bucks gave the
yearlings their third straight first
down, this time on the 4.
After pitching one incompleted
pass, Albert grabbed the ball from j
center, started to run right end, but j
cut back sharply over tackle for the j
score. He added the conversion.
From that time on. Coach Harry
Shipkey's charges went into a shell
and Salinas monopolized the ground
gaining, especially with a sharp
passing attack. Toward the end of
the third quarter, Joe Garcia, Sa
linas end, ran 76 yards to a touch
down, after catching a 5-yard toss
from Americo Vella. However, he
ran out of bounds on the Stanford
26, minimizing the total gain of the
play to 55 yards. A couple of plays
later, Vella passed over the head of
Kmetovic, Card safety man, to
Ernie Scattini, for the losers' only
marker.
Shipkey placed the blame for the
poor showing mainly on his tackles
and line backers-up. The tackles
lacked power on both offense and
defense, while the defensive full
backs had trouble getting into the
plays fast enough.
With their crucial game with the
U.C.L.A. frosh scheduled next Sat
urday at Los Angeles, Shipkey indi
cated that he will work on pass de
fense and line reserve strength this
week. Several reserve linemen, in
cluding Mel Ellett, end; Max Schmidt,
Doc Stolle, and Larry Partridge,
tackles; and Bob Heringer, guard,
have shown enough stuff in recent
games to warrant a possible shot on
the first string.

the next play, Kmetovic cut through
the jaysee secondary, took Albert's
bullet-pass on the 25 and rambled
to the touchdown. Albert fioozled
the kick for conversion.
On the first play following the
succeeding kick-off, A1 Wool inter
cepted Howard Shinn's pass and ran
it back 5 yards to the 40. This time
it took more time to get through the
sturdy Salinas defense, but 11 plays
later the frosh had their second
score.

ALBERT PITCHES

Two line bucks and a 10-yard pass |
from Albert to Kmetovic gave the j
Papooses a first down on the 28. Al
bert reared back and nailed Francis
with an 8-yard aerial, and on the
next play the latter bulled his way
(i yards for another first down on
the 14. Albert then slung an 8-yard
pass to Wool along the right side
lines, and two short bucks gave the
yearlings their third straight first
down, this time on the 4.
After pitching one incompleted
pass, Albert grabbed the ball from j
center, started to run right end, but j
cut back sharply over tackle for the j
score. He added the conversion.
From that time on. Coach Harry
Shipkey's charges went into a shell
and Salinas monopolized the ground
gaining, especially with a sharp
passing attack. Toward the end of
the third quarter, Joe Garcia, Sa
linas end, ran 76 yards to a touch
down, after catching a 5-yard toss
from Americo Vella. However, he
ran out of bounds on the Stanford
26, minimizing the total gain of the
play to 55 yards. A couple of plays
later, Vella passed over the head of
Kmetovic, Card safety man, to
Ernie Scattini, for the losers' only
marker.
Shipkey placed the blame for the
poor showing mainly on his tackles
and line backers-up. The tackles
lacked power on both offense and
defense, while the defensive full
backs had trouble getting into the
plays fast enough.
With their crucial game with the
U.C.L.A. frosh scheduled next Sat
urday at Los Angeles, Shipkey indi
cated that he will work on pass de
fense and line reserve strength this
week. Several reserve linemen, in
cluding Mel Ellett, end; Max Schmidt,
Doc Stolle, and Larry Partridge,
tackles; and Bob Heringer, guard,
have shown enough stuff in recent
games to warrant a possible shot on
the first string.

Stanford's frosh griddcrs shifted
into low gear—almost neutral—last
Saturday, and as a result were
lucky to squeeze out a 13-6 win over
Salinas Junior College. By their
triumph, the Papooses managed to
keep their escutcheon unblemished
for the season, but they failed to
impress anybody with their prowess,
least of all Salinas.
The jay see boys were unanimous
in their opinions that the frosh were
over-rated, that their blocking
lacked steam, and that they would
have lost the game had not the
fourth quarter been shortened to
permit the varsity game to start on
schedule.

FROSH PASS TO SCORE

However, despite the fact that the
yearlings had to be content to score
quickly on two quick passing
thrusts in the third quarter, after a
scoreless first half, they outstatis
ticked the Lettuce Belt hoys deci
sively.
The jaysees had only two real
chances to score during the entire
game, one of which they made good,
while (he Cards were hounding the
Salinas goal line all day. In the
scoreless first half, for instance, the
Papooses lost the ball six times in
side their foes' 27, once on a fumble
and five times on downs.
Salinas' only scoring chance this
half came about midway through
the second quarter, when a series of
passes put the ball on Stanford's 31-
yard line. On the next play, Bill
Morasci, outstanding Salinas half
back, circled right end to the 21,
but the threat ended when the play
was called back because of a pen
alty.

STRIKE QUICKLY

The trosh wasted no time in the
second half getting their first touch
down, which came just three plays
after the kick-off. Starting from
Stanford's 36, Frankie Albert threw
one incomplete pass, then flipped a
shovel pass to Pete Kmetovic, cut
ting across to the right behind his
own line, which worked for 22 yards,
putting the ball on the Salinas 42. On
the next play, Kmetovic cut through
the jaysee secondary, took Albert's

backs had trouble getting into the
plays fast enough.
With their crucial game with the
U.C.L.A. frosh scheduled next Sat
urday at Los Angeles, Shipkey indi
cated that he will work on pass de
fense and line reserve strength this
week. Several reserve linemen, in
cluding Mel Ellett, end; Max Schmidt,
Doc Stolle, and Larry Partridge,
tackles; and Bob Heringer, guard,
have shown enough stuff in recent
games to warrant a possible shot on
the first string.
Starting line-ups:
Stanford Salinas

Stanford's frosh griddcrs shifted
into low gear—almost neutral—last
Saturday, and as a result were
lucky to squeeze out a 13-6 win over
Salinas Junior College. By their
triumph, the Papooses managed to
keep their escutcheon unblemished
for the season, but they failed to
impress anybody with their prowess,
least of all Salinas.
The jay see boys were unanimous
in their opinions that the frosh were
over-rated, that their blocking
lacked steam, and that they would
have lost the game had not the
fourth quarter been shortened to
permit the varsity game to start on
schedule.

FROSH PASS TO SCORE

However, despite the fact that the
yearlings had to be content to score
quickly on two quick passing
thrusts in the third quarter, after a
scoreless first half, they outstatis
ticked the Lettuce Belt hoys deci
sively.
The jaysees had only two real
chances to score during the entire
game, one of which they made good,
while (he Cards were hounding the
Salinas goal line all day. In the
scoreless first half, for instance, the
Papooses lost the ball six times in
side their foes' 27, once on a fumble
and five times on downs.
Salinas' only scoring chance this
half came about midway through
the second quarter, when a series of
passes put the ball on Stanford's 31-
yard line. On the next play, Bill
Morasci, outstanding Salinas half
back, circled right end to the 21,
but the threat ended when the play
was called back because of a pen
alty.

STRIKE QUICKLY

The trosh wasted no time in the
second half getting their first touch
down, which came just three plays
after the kick-off. Starting from
Stanford's 36, Frankie Albert threw
one incomplete pass, then flipped a
shovel pass to Pete Kmetovic, cut
ting across to the right behind his
own line, which worked for 22 yards,
putting the ball on the Salinas 42. On
the next play, Kmetovic cut through
the jaysee secondary, took Albert's
bullet-pass on the 25 and rambled
to the touchdown. Albert fioozled
the kick for conversion.
On the first play following the
succeeding kick-off, A1 Wool inter
cepted Howard Shinn's pass and ran
it back 5 yards to the 40. This time
it took more time to get through the
sturdy Salinas defense, but 11 plays
later the frosh had their second
score.

ALBERT PITCHES

Two line bucks and a 10-yard pass |
from Albert to Kmetovic gave the j
Papooses a first down on the 28. Al
bert reared back and nailed Francis
with an 8-yard aerial, and on the
next play the latter bulled his way
(i yards for another first down on
the 14. Albert then slung an 8-yard
pass to Wool along the right side
lines, and two short bucks gave the
yearlings their third straight first
down, this time on the 4.
After pitching one incompleted
pass, Albert grabbed the ball from j
center, started to run right end, but j
cut back sharply over tackle for the j
score. He added the conversion.
From that time on. Coach Harry
Shipkey's charges went into a shell
and Salinas monopolized the ground
gaining, especially with a sharp
passing attack. Toward the end of
the third quarter, Joe Garcia, Sa
linas end, ran 76 yards to a touch
down, after catching a 5-yard toss
from Americo Vella. However, he
ran out of bounds on the Stanford
26, minimizing the total gain of the
play to 55 yards. A couple of plays
later, Vella passed over the head of
Kmetovic, Card safety man, to
Ernie Scattini, for the losers' only
marker.
Shipkey placed the blame for the
poor showing mainly on his tackles
and line backers-up. The tackles
lacked power on both offense and
defense, while the defensive full
backs had trouble getting into the
plays fast enough.
