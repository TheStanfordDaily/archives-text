Rumors that Stanford would be
treated to an exhibition tennis
match between Bobby Riggs, second
ranking U. S. player, and a member
of the Card squad were tentatively
confirmed Saturday by Coach Sherm
Lock wood.
"If nothing unexpected comes up
Bob Riggs and Elwood Cooke will
play here Friday with a couple of
members of my squad," Lockwood
said.
The Card mentor intimated that
Riggs would take on Larry Dee,
fxosh sensation, or Bob Low, cur
rently top man on the varsity ladder,
in an exhibition singles match, and
then Riggs and Cooke would team
to play a doubles match against a
pair of Indians.
At the same time Friday, Lock
wood said that entries for the an
nual Hahn Novice Tennis Tourna
ment would close today.
Anyone in the university who has
never won a varsity or frosh award
in tennis and who is not ranked in
the first ten on the present varsity
ladder is eligible to compete, Lock
wood said.
Players wishing to enter may sign
up on the tennis bulletin board in
the Encina gym. Deadline is today
at 5 o'clock.
