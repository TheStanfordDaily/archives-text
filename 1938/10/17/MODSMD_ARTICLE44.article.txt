# Fair to Feature Aquatic 'Strip'
## 
### 
Strip tease, a la carte, with all the
trimmings, or rather no trimmings,
will be the artistic attraction of the
1939 Golden Gate International Ex
position, Harris Connick, exposition
director, announced today.
It will be strip tease on an aqua
plane.
None of this antiquated stuffâ€”
strip tease with fans, with bubbles,
with colored lights, with balloons, or
on stages, Mr. Connick announced.
Each night, he said, spotlights
will play across the lagoon, where a
gliding aquaplane will bear a beau
tiful girl dressed in a rhinestone
studded gown, which she will grace
fully remove with only the highest
of aesthetic technique, Mr. Connick
said.
Someone asked Mr. Connick if the
girl would be Sally Rand or Gypsy
Rose Lee (Louise Hovick). He said
that he didn't know yet just who
it would be, but that it would not be
any girl who might get seasick.
That wouldn't be art.
