# Indian Soccer Team Smashes Strong Rivals
## San Mateo Taken By 4-1 Margin In Conference Opener 
### 
With a revitalized front line co
ordinating perfectly on attack, and
a defense that was air-tiyht through
the final three quarters, the Card
varsity soccer team steam-rollered a
fighting San Mateo J. C. team four
goals to one to register their first
conference victory Saturday morning
at the Stanford soccer field.
The tilt marked the second con
ference appearance of the Indian
squad. Last Saturday against S. F.
J. C. the score ended in a 1-to-l tie.
Play opened with a Card whirl
wind attack. With only 30 seconds
of play gone, Sadullah took a set-up
pass from Santurn and booted it
cleanly through for the first Stan
ford score. Three more Indian scor
ing threats were nullified by kicks
that barely missed before San Mateo
opened its vaunted offensive.

SAN MATEO SCORES

With the heavy wind at their
1 backs during the second starter, the
J.C. squad moved the entire length
of the field to tie the count, scoring
lon a beautiful shot by Bill Fetter
that rolled past the Stanford goalie.
A few minutes later Stanford
came back to take the lead when
Dißeneditti scored on a , beautiful
shot from a difficult angle. The ball
was hardly in play again, when
Gunther Gerbstedt tallied on the
j best placed shot of the day, a pen
alty kick from 20 yards out that
| landed in the corner of the net.

CARD DEFENSE HOLDS

San Mateo opened the third quar
ter with a desperate attack that al
most scored twice, but was re
pulsed by the Stanford defense line.
Taking the ball almost the length
of the field, Dißeneditti scored his
second goal of the day with a left
footed angle shot, making the score
Stanford 4, San Mateo 1.
The fourth- quarter found play
mostly in Jaysee territory, but
neither side scored.
The entire Stanford forward wall
performed well during the game.
Bill Williams, Ken Cuthbertson, and
Wilson Clark were outstanding in
the defensive line-up.

COACH SATISFIED

I Coach Harry Maloney expressed
j satisfaction with the offensive work
jof the squad in particular, stating
j that if the team play would show
I the same improvement during the
j next few weeks, the squad would
have an excellent chance to defeat
California. The Bears defeated San
j Mateo, 5 to 2, in a recent game.
Wednesday afternoon the varsity
will meet Menlo J. C. at 4 o'clock.
The game next Saturday will be
against the strong U.S.F. eleven.
