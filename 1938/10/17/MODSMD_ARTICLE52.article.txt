# The 						Boathouse Crossade
## 
### 
STANFORD has her fingers crossed.
When the contracting and architectural
firms come down today with rough plans and
tentative estimations of cost, the Boathouse
boomers will hear their fate read in a loud,
clear voice.
When the committee comes to those little
numbers which indicate just how much a Boat
house costs, it will be a moment for a one
minute silence, facing toward the east.
Because, those little numbers will tell the tale.
If the tale is as sad as some anticipate, it's
all off.
If the little numbers add up to a figure half
way between here and the moon, perhaps
something can be done.
And if they really climb down on their knees
and crawl, Ex Committee can have themselves
a time voting in a new Boathouse.
It is conceivable that the cost may be abso
lutely prohibitive. In that case, finis. But there
is a spot just between Stanford's most fevered
hopes, and the prohibitive plane which de
serves consideration. ,
Just what will happen if the cost exceeds
ready cash on hand, but it is not completely out
of sight? Obvious, the idea is to make the best
of that thing already standing on the edge of
Lagunita—a lesson in haunted houses.
A thorough inspection may establish the fact
that, with new foundations, the framework al
ready in existence could be used in a re-build
ing rather than building process. A thorough
working over could easily transform the crip
pled old barn into a relatively decent Boat
house—and the cost would probably be im
measurably minute in comparison to that of a
completely new structure.
Or perhaps, returning to what might be
done, the campus itself could step into the
breach. God wot, this is a country of drives.
A Boathouse Drive would be a drive that would
receive the blessings of all the gods that be—
and might even get Stanford a new building.
Out of the room where the Boathouse Com
mittee hits the decks with the builders this
afternoon can come some very, very sad news.
But no matter how sad the news is, there are
things to be done. As an emergency measure,
Stanford can turn those things over in its mind.
Otherwise, until tomorrow afternoon, the
whole thing is out of Stanford's hands.
And so they are absolutely free for plain
and fancy finger-crossing.

When the committee comes to those little
numbers which indicate just how much a Boat
house costs, it will be a moment for a one
minute silence, facing toward the east.
Because, those little numbers will tell the tale.
If the tale is as sad as some anticipate, it's
all off.
If the little numbers add up to a figure half
way between here and the moon, perhaps
something can be done.
And if they really climb down on their knees
and crawl, Ex Committee can have themselves
a time voting in a new Boathouse.
It is conceivable that the cost may be abso
lutely prohibitive. In that case, finis. But there
is a spot just between Stanford's most fevered
hopes, and the prohibitive plane which de
serves consideration. ,
Just what will happen if the cost exceeds
ready cash on hand, but it is not completely out
of sight? Obvious, the idea is to make the best
of that thing already standing on the edge of
Lagunita—a lesson in haunted houses.
A thorough inspection may establish the fact
that, with new foundations, the framework al
ready in existence could be used in a re-build
ing rather than building process. A thorough
working over could easily transform the crip
pled old barn into a relatively decent Boat
house—and the cost would probably be im
measurably minute in comparison to that of a
completely new structure.
Or perhaps, returning to what might be
done, the campus itself could step into the
breach. God wot, this is a country of drives.
A Boathouse Drive would be a drive that would
receive the blessings of all the gods that be—
and might even get Stanford a new building.
Out of the room where the Boathouse Com
mittee hits the decks with the builders this
afternoon can come some very, very sad news.
But no matter how sad the news is, there are
things to be done. As an emergency measure,
Stanford can turn those things over in its mind.
Otherwise, until tomorrow afternoon, the
whole thing is out of Stanford's hands.
And so they are absolutely free for plain
and fancy finger-crossing.
STANFORD has her fingers crossed.
When the contracting and architectural
firms come down today with rough plans and
tentative estimations of cost, the Boathouse
boomers will hear their fate read in a loud,
clear voice.
