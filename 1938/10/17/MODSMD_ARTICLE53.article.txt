# Accidentally Lucky

THAT was a good week-end, just passed.
Even the morbid had their fun. And they
had it in a typically morbid way—standing in
puddles of oily water, gasping at dented car
fenders and bodies. They were disappointed
in one regard, however, for no one was even
hurt, or even killed.
In each of the four, details are different, but
four accidents of varying degree occurred in
and around the campus. The series started at
6 o'clock Saturday, when one car slid 250 feet
on its top at Emarcadero Road and El Camino.
It ended about noon yesterday, when two cars
side-swiped each other at the southeast corner
of Encina gym and got mangled fenders.
In each of the four, details are dierent, but
four factors are the same in each case.
Each one is listed by state and local officers
as "unavoidable."
Each one was due -to carelessness on some
one's part.
No citations have been issued to any of the
drivers involved and no one was drunk or had
even smelled a bottle top.
The whole trouble apparently is a disregard
of normal caution—a prevalent driving attitude
on the campus, where jumped stop-signs and
wheeled corners are the rule rather than the
exception.
Policing of the campus and near-vicinity is
more than adequate; evidently, it is the campus
drivers that are not.
Whatever the cause, an old saying still goes.
