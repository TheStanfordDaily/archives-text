# It Was a Good Day
## 
### 
THE sun is out, birds twitter like things pos
sessed, the grass is green to an ungodly
degree—in short, because Stanford tore Oregon
apart Saturday, things are looking up.
It's a funny thing. Let Stanford, or any other
university, have a bad year on the gridiron,
or even a bad pair of games, and the wolves
start howling like an Antarctic hurricane. Ev
erything's wrong: the players, the coach, the

rooting section, the Band, the yell-leaders, the
weather.
But give the rooters a game they can yell
themselves hoarse on and go home bragging
about, give the team a game it can use as the
subject for enthusiastic shop-talk, give the
coaches an afternoon they can fling in the faces
of the carping alumni—let Stanford win a game
in good style, and the storm blows over.
Except that this time, while the sun came out
over the Farm, San Francisco still seemed to
be in a dark, pessimistic fog. It seems, accord
ing to the metropolitan papers, that Stanford,
poor dear, merely put on a fluke last-minute
stand which merely serves to emphasize her
state of decomposition. After writing up the
Indians in the groove of ridicule and smirking
sympathy, it looked as if some of the lads up
north couldn't get out of the groove when they
followed up the Oregon game.
Perhaps they all are right—that it was a
win that "no one will believe," that it can never
happen again. Perhaps in spite of Saturday,
the Farm should be wrapped in a blanket of
despair.
But that sun's sure bright.
