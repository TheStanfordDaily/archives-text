### JOHN COBBS 
GETTING ON THE BANDWAGON

middle-aged ladies sat under a blanket in the
alumni section last Saturday and watched the drum
majorette revolve in a whirlpool of red and white
skirts.
"Disgraceful," said one.
"Yes, disgusting," said the other.
"If they want that sort of thing, why don't they go
to a night club?"
"Yes, or to U.S.C."
"Yes, I think we should."
"I think I will write to the Illustrated Review about
it."

Very probably those two ladies have lived honest
and God-fearing lives. Probably they have made in
spiring wives and mothers; and when the Day of
Judgment comes, they will undoubtedly enter the
Kingdom of Heaven without having to stop even for
a passport visa. But even so, it is hard for me to
see how they lived to their present age without get
ting themselves poisoned by some civic-minded citizen.
Personally, I thought that the Band, with the help
of the drum majorette, did a first-rate job. Its im
provement over last week's comic opera performance
would have done credit to a Horatio Alger hero.

fT played' Stanford songs often enough to remind us
that we were x*ooting for dear Alma Mater and not
for the French Impressionist- school of music. And it
played with a snap that set our feet tapping, even
though they were weighted down by the posterior of
the man in front of us.
Evidently Yell King Turner had obtained an intro
duction to the bandleader, and so the cheers and songs
came at different times instead of fighting bitterly for
supremacy.

The drum majorette was magnificent. Where before
our Band had stalked in monastic sternness, Satur
day it paraded with a boulevardier dash. Where before
the rooters had watched the wavering redcoated lines
with an apathetically raised eyebrow, Saturday they
rose and howled enthusiasm at the high stepping little
figure with the swirling skirts. The effect was psycho
logical as all hell.

And yet the dear ladies in the stands disapproved.
They thought it most unseemly, and unbecoming to our
dignity. It is useless to tell the ladies that hymns do
not go with the football spirit, that graceful drum
majorettes are quite appropriate on a festival occasion.
For them dignity is an inflexible affair which can
not relax without shattering. And for them morality
begins at the waistline. They were taught as children
that young ladies never, never turn cartwheels. Their
idea of a well-managed college is an unusually strict
theological seminary.

Author's Note: This is to certify that the above
opinions "are sincere and were not written under any
form of compulsion, coercion, or bribery by the Band.
And in case anybody is wondering, I didn't get to
meet the 'drum majorette.
