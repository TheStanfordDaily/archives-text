# Lightly... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
YOU know, people do the damnedest things.
The other day the sophomores got. together to
plan their Soph Cotillion. In keeping with their let's
go-slumming motif, one wag suggested that they ad
vertise the dance with copies of the Communist
Manifesto.
That started it. The immediate reception of the
idea was serious and enthusiastic. One guy suggested
that they have people going around giving soap-box
speeches, another that, they strew the campus with
rod flags, another that they use the "International"
for their theme song.
Then a few of the more serious boys got up. stood
firmly on their own two feet, and said in sonorous,
dignified tones, "No!" They said it in any number of
ways. They said that such a thing would b£ against
the spirit of democracy of this great country. They
said that it would add another black mark 1o Stan
ford's already growing reputation as a Red hot-bed.
Someone probably said that it was unconstitutional.
The meeting became a hubbub verging on a brawl.
It got to a point where the only thing left was for the
comedian who suggested the manifesto to admit he
had done it as a joke.
He did.

r PHEN last Sunday a woman in one of the sororities
asked a guy up for Sunday night supper. Before
he was to get. there someone called the gal on the
phone, saying he was Dr. Roth, and asked her to
send the guy home right after dinner. He said the
guy was recovering from a severe cold or something
and needed his sleep.
Feeling very, very maternal, the woman told the
guy as soon as supper was over that she couldn't go.

number of beautiful excuses. So the guy left. She
hoped he would sleep well and feel much, much better
the next day.
The next day. standing at the English Corner, she
heard the guy tell some people about the show he had
seen the night before.
It took quite a while to get that one straightened out.
