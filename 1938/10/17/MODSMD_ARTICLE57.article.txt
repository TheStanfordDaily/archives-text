### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16 (UP3. —
Secretary of the Interior Harold L.
Ickes cast aside the anonymity of
his San Francisco visit today to
issue a statement denying he was
suffering from "cancelitis" and say
ing he would fulfill all his California
speaking engagements.
In fact Ickes said specifically that
he would fill a speaking engagement
Wednesday in Los Angeles which,
reports had said, he was canceling
because of displeasure with the
methods of advertising the speech.
Reports from Hollywood said post
ers were being distributed reading
"a chance to see a cabinet official
at $2.25 a ticket."
The Ickes statement set at rest
rumore that the cabinet member was
ill and was canceling the engage
ments made for the remainder of his
Far Western tour.
"Rumors seem to grow as big in
the famous California climate as
navel oranges," the statement said.
"To set all silly rumors at rest, I
may say, first, that I did not go to
Boulder City from Reno simply and
solely because I preferred a few days
in California to long automobile
rides in a hot climate. (California
papers please take notice.) Second,
I have not canceled a single one
of my speaking engagements and do
not propose to cancel any.
"Third, and more specifically, I
shall speak in Los Angeles on the
night of Wednesday, October 19,
under the auspices of the Hollywood
Council for Democracy.
