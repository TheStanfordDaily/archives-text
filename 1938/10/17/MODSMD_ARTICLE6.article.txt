side elevations, and floor plan in
cluded.
As suggestions to student archi
tects, the Boathouse Committee has
drawn up a list of necessary ele
ments which the structure should
contain. They are reprinted below:
1. A two-story building should be
planned in order to reduce to the
minimum construction costs.
2. Provision must be made to
house at least 50 canoes, with ade
quate space for repairs and equip
ment lockers.
3. Docks must be included
4. Room for sun-bathing must be
made, preferably on the lower floor.
5. Two student rooms — a suite —
equipped with wash basin, and
men's and women's dressing rooms
are required.
6. Plans should be made for a
diving platform, preferably separate
from the main building.
The committee stressed the fact
that simplicity of design should be
maintained throughout.
