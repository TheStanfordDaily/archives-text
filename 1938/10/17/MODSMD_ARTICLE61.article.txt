# Hate, Revenge Fail To Click In Greek Play
## 
### 
"TIIE DAUGHTERS OF ATREUS,"
produced last week-end by the
Palo Alto Community Theater:
Long ago when Fate was the big
kibitzer and Hitler still only a fly
speck on the windshield of Eternity,
the House of Atreus ruled Greece.
Since then the story of Elektra and
Clytemnestra — the story of matri
cide and primitive hate—has been
rehashed time and again.
Robert Turney filters the turgid
legend with a strain of lyricism and
last week-end's production bore him
out. The frieze-like movement of
the Greek women and a poetic use
of color in the costumes pointed the
flutey grace of the play.
Still, '"The Daughters of Atreus,"
as I recall, was not written as a
companion piece to "Corrina Goes A-
Maying" and you can't make a sissy
out of Euripides. The massiveness
of the tragedy, although inherent in
Turney's play, is not realized and
the production was often tame and
static. Clytemestra's lurid revenge
and Elektra's vindictive hate should
have splintered the boards. But due
partly to the direction and partly to
the cast, the original force of the
conflict was watered down. Only Pat
Smith as Elektra, struck fire from
her flinty character.
