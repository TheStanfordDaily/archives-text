The Editor, Sir:
With all the publicity and activity j
over the boathouse attracting every- |
one's attention, a little timely sug- j
gestion might come in handy. Why '
not use the boathouse for the Big
Game bonfire? As the poor old shack
is bound to go, it might just as well
serve the dual purpose of making |
the Bonfire an unequalled success,
and proving that an old Stanford
relic can end in a blaze of glory.
From a practical viewpoint, would j
it not be easier to drag the whole |
building out onto the lake bed, in
stead of laboriously pounding it to
pieces and carting it away? And
sentimentally, is not an honorable
departure preferable to an igno- j
minious one?
