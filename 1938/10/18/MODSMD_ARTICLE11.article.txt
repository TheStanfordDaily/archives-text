# Chemist Evaluates Petroleum By-Products
## 
### 
"By-products are coming to be more and more important in the petro
leum industry, and the old idea of petroleum as merely a fuel or lubricant
is outmoded," said Or. George S. Parks, associate professor of chemistry,
in an informal discussion at the conclusion of his talk before advanced
chemistry students yesterday afternoon.
While his general topic covering recent research in the fields of thermo-

►dynamics as applied to hydrocar
-1 bons was of "so technical a nature
as to be understood by only ad
vanced students," Dr. Parks pointed
out that the practical application of
the research which has been carried
on in his department is that it is a
theoretical basis for practical utili
zation of petroleum by-products.
General topic of the seminar yes
terday was "Current Research in
the Chemistry Department," and
two sides of the subject were pre
sented by Dr. Parks and Dr. James
M. Luck, associate professor of bio
chemistry.
Dr. Luck, in his talk, explained
that research in the biochemistry de
partment has included a detailed
investigation into the origin of plas
ma proteins, attempts at character
ization of liver proteins, and work in
amino acids. He stressed the "hope
that this work will prove a valuable
basis for further research in the
subject of enzymes."
