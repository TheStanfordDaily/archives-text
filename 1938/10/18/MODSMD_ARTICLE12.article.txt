# Clubs Will Play Host to Frosh
## 
### 
Frosh men will get their first
view of Hall-eating club life to
morrow night when six Stanford
clubs play host to 72 Encina-ites.
Sponsored by Interclub Council
and co-chairmanned by Gail Rath
bun and Frank Van Acker, the pro
gram will include dinner at one of
the eating clubs and an open-house
in Branner and Toyon Halls after
ward.
Mimeographed slips were passed
out in Encina dining halls on Mon
day night asking freshmen to indi
cate their desire to attend a club,
their preference. "If thus first rush
ing period fails to accommodate the
number who wish to view the Hall
set-up, it is likely that we'll spon
sor a second period," Jim Barnum,
Interclub Council president, said.
