# Nippon Army Tears Open China Lines
## American Evacuees Attempt Desperate Flight from Canton 
### 
HONG KONG, Tuesday, Oct. 18 j
(UP). â€” Scores of Americans and!
other Occidentals today were at
tempting desperate last - minute
flights from Hankow and Canton as
attacking Japanese armies smashed
into the inner defenses of the pro
visional national capital and the
great South China metropolis.
Fragmentary communications from
both cities, which are isolated from
the coast by the Japanese drives,
reported near panic among the Chi
nese.
United States and British gunboats
were standing off both river cities
and were prepared to take on their
nationals if necessary.
HOSPITALS BOMBED
Radio dispatches reported exten
sive damage to American property
on the Hankow front.
Two American mission hospitals
on the Peiping - Hankow railway
north of Hankow had been bombed
and many Chinese converts were
reported killed.
The first attack was on the Lu
theran mission hospital at Kioshan,
40 miles north of the Japanese base
at Sinyang station 100 miles north
of Hankow. Japanese planes flew
over the hospital twice on the 13th
and dropped bombs which caused
"great damage."
The second attack, on the 15th, was
on the Augustana Synod mission at
Hsuchang, 50 miles .south of Cheng
chow junction on the north-south
Peiping-Hankow line and the east
west Lung-hai Railway. Equally
heavy damage was done there, mis
sionaries informed the United States
Consulate General in Hankow.
No Occidentals were hurt in the
raids.
AMERICAN FLAGS HIT
The Kioshan missionaries said
their buildings, outside the city and
visible for 10 miles, were marked
by 12 American flags.
The bombings were listed, along
with other similar attacks, for pos
sible claims against the Japanese
later.
Japanese mechanized columns
which yesterday cut the Kowloon
(Hong Kong)-Canton railway 15
miles north of Shumchun station
near the British territorial border,
were reported to have consolidated
their positions and to be advancing
directly up the railway toward Can
ton.
The Japanese continued to use
their favorite "fan-column" tactics
in their attacks on both cities.
Three major columns were driving
toward both Hankow and Canton
but each of them was split into
smaller flying columns which zig
zagged through the country along
highways and water routes, cutting
chinese communications lines and
frequently attacking Chinese de
fense positions from the rear.
