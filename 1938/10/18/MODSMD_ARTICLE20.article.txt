# Levinson Sees Early Sell-Out For Chappie
## 
### 
Sitting in the midst of his lair, Old
Boy Art Lcvinson congratulated the
campus yesterday on having in its
midst the finest collegiate humor
magazine in the world. "I want to
make clear the fact that this is not
mere applesauce," he quoth, "but
comes from the bottom of my
heart."
Celebrating the 40th anniversary
of Chappie with tomorrow's issue,
the Ancient One in his debut prom
ises a lusty 40-page infant (not
counting the covers).
Because tomorrow's issue will be
the first of the current year, the Old
Boy in due modesty could only say
that it would be the best Chappie
ever printed.
"Subscribe now and avoid the dis
appointment of not being able to
buy one on the campus tomorrow,"
says the Chappie business staff, who
anticipates a sellout in an hour.
Two guest editorials concerning
the Speech and Drama department
will be included, one by J. P. Cahn,
dramatics major, and the other by
Dr. Bassett, head of the department.
Two monthly features will appear
tomorrow for the first time. One
will be "Weezie the Kangaroo," by
Jack Dixon and Art LeVinson. The
other will be Sherman Mellinkoff's
"Whispers and Dispatches."
As an extra special attraction for
freshmen, Chappie will present two
full-page illustrations of the frosh
handbook.
