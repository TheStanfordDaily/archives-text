"The number of cases dealing with
students riding on automobile run
ning boards has become overwhelm
ingly large since the beginning of
the school year," said A1 Horn,
chairman of Men's Council, at the
close of yesterday's meeting. In the
future, with the most emphatic sup
port of the Men's Council, Gordy
Davis, Stanford police officer, will do
everything possible to enforce the
Stanford regulation which prevents
running board riding on the cam
pus."
Horn announced postponement of
the discussion program for ac
quainting junior transfers with the
honor system and of the selection of
two representatives of Men's Coun
cil to travel on the U.C.L.A. special
train.
Both will be handled at the next
regular meeting of the council, at
which new members, being elected
today, will be present.
