# Physiologist Airs Body Heat Problem

"The broad problem of man with regard to climate is lo live within 1
the limits which are placed on the human body in withstanding adverse
climatic conditions," said John Field 11. associate professor of physiology
at Stanford University, in a radio talk 011 "Temperature Kegulation in
Health" over station K(i<> last night.
Dr. Field stressed the facility with which (bis problem is met in Cali-

fornia, and he continued by giving,
examples of how the regulation of
body temperatures was accomp
lished in such physical extremes as
the activities of varsity football
players.
It is a generally accepted fact that
the temperature of healthy human
adults is surprisingly constant, with
98.6 degrees considered to be "nor
mal," but Dr. Field discussed the
answer to the question of what lies
behind this remarkable constancy of
body temperature.
Attempting to answer this ques
tion, Dr. Field continued by say
ing, "It is now well known that all
(lie cells of the body produce heat
even at rest, and many parts of our
bodies are never really at rest. Thus
the work of the heart, of breathing,
and of the various other processes
continues even during sleep, and this
work involves heat production.
"Since heat production is continu
ous and body temperature is so
constant, it follows that the rate of
heat loss must balance the rate of
heat production. If this balance
fails, body temperature will rise or
fall. Such a balance could be at
tained by regulating either heat
production 01* heat loss or both."
Olive trees are known to live 1000
years.
