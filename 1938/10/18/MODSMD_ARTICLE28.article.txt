# Rallymen Plan Pajamarino
## Annual U.S.C. Rally To Be Held Thursday 
### 
Plans for a pajamarino rally
Thursday night for the University of
Southern California game and game
stunts will be the main business of
the Rally Committee meeting to
night at 7:15 o'clock in the Women's
Clubhouse, according to Jack Laney,
chairman.
Traditions of past years will be
followed in the Pajamarino, with the
parade down the Row, the rally in
the Pavilion, the serenade of the
Robleites by the pajama-claa frosh,
and the special show at the Varsity
Theater for the frosh men.
Card stunts for the game Satur
day will also be discussed. Five
stunts have been planned, each with
several parts. Final plans, for the
jolly-up Friday afternoon, for which
Cardinals and Rally Committee are
combining, will be completed.
