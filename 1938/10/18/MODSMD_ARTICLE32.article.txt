LAUREL, Md„ Oct. 17 (UP).—
I Race followers today were still hail
ing the victory of Jacola, a filly, who
defeated Seabiscuit Saturday by two
lengths in the 25th running of the
$7500 Laurel Stakes.
To show outsiders that Purdue is
coeducational, Purdue senior women
wore corduroy skirts and paraded
with the men in the stadium on the
annual "Cord Day."
