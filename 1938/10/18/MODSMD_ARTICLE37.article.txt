# Stanford's Big Red Machine Hit by Injuries
## Paulman Joins Dakan And Fay on Sick List; Standlee First String 
### 
Another sad blow was dealt to
Stanford football last night when it
was announced that Bill Paulman,
great triple-threat quarter and full
back, is almost a certainty to be
out of the U.S.C. game with two bad
charley horse.
Paulman left the Oregon game Sat
urday late in the second half, but
no one realized then the extent of
his hurts. He joins Pete Fay and

Neil "Corky" Donahue, right
guard, was awarded the third
Keehle pen last night for his play
against the University of Oregon.

Bob Dakar! on the current sick list.
Fay, stricken with a streptococcus
infection last Friday, probably won't
see action for another two weeks.
Paulman threw a touchdown pass
in the Duck game and played a
bang-up game defensively. He has
been considered one of the three
best punters on the Coast, along
with AI Braga of U.S.F. and Jerry
Dowd of St. Mary's.

If any ray of hope could be gar
nered from secret workouts last
night it was the return of Norm
Standlee, Tony Calvelli, and Jack
Clark. Calvelli played a small por
tion of the Oregon clash, but was
definitely not at top speed after be
ing out for a week with a variety of
ailments.
Standlee has been out ever since
the first quarter of the Santa Clara
scrimmage with a game ankle. He
went right into a first-string back
field last night along with Freddie
Ledeboer, Gene Coldiron, and Hugh
Gallarneau. Ledeboer is tentatively
at left half in place of Fay and the
team's best back against Oregon,
little Jackie Brenner. Coldiron is a
Class A defensive fullback and is
considered by some to be the best
blocker on the lot. His addition will
undoubtedly offer the Indian run
ners like Gallarneau and Ledeboer
more chance for breakaway sprints
than heretofore.
STANDLEE UNPROVEN
Standlee is still unproven in var
sity play with the excepiton of a
few moments against the Broncos,
but evidently showed well enough
as a freshman to warrant his in
stallation on the top team.
Clarke's rise back to fame in his
new tailor-made shoes probably
won't be as easy. All the classy end
will have to do now will be to ace
out Bill Willard and Stan Graff, a
couple of outstanding examples of
what Jim Lawson can do with raw
material.

There were steam automobiles
rumbling over English highways as
early as 1825, according to Professor
John S. Worley of the University of
Michigan.

was announced that Bill Paulman,
great triple-threat quarter and full
back, is almost a certainty to be
out of the U.S.C. game with two bad
charley horse.
Paulman left the Oregon game Sat
urday late in the second half, but
no one realized then the extent of
his hurts. He joins Pete Fay and

Neil "Corky" Donahue, right
guard, was awarded the third
Keehle pen last night for his play
against the University of Oregon.

Bob Dakar! on the current sick list.
Fay, stricken with a streptococcus
infection last Friday, probably won't
see action for another two weeks.
Paulman threw a touchdown pass
in the Duck game and played a
bang-up game defensively. He has
been considered one of the three
best punters on the Coast, along
with AI Braga of U.S.F. and Jerry
Dowd of St. Mary's.

If any ray of hope could be gar
nered from secret workouts last
night it was the return of Norm
Standlee, Tony Calvelli, and Jack
Clark. Calvelli played a small por
tion of the Oregon clash, but was
definitely not at top speed after be
ing out for a week with a variety of
ailments.
Standlee has been out ever since
the first quarter of the Santa Clara
scrimmage with a game ankle. He
went right into a first-string back
field last night along with Freddie
Ledeboer, Gene Coldiron, and Hugh
Gallarneau. Ledeboer is tentatively
at left half in place of Fay and the
team's best back against Oregon,
little Jackie Brenner. Coldiron is a
Class A defensive fullback and is
considered by some to be the best
blocker on the lot. His addition will
undoubtedly offer the Indian run
ners like Gallarneau and Ledeboer
more chance for breakaway sprints
than heretofore.
STANDLEE UNPROVEN
Standlee is still unproven in var
sity play with the excepiton of a
few moments against the Broncos,
but evidently showed well enough
as a freshman to warrant his in
stallation on the top team.
Clarke's rise back to fame in his
new tailor-made shoes probably
won't be as easy. All the classy end
will have to do now will be to ace
out Bill Willard and Stan Graff, a
couple of outstanding examples of
what Jim Lawson can do with raw
material.

There were steam automobiles
rumbling over English highways as
early as 1825, according to Professor
John S. Worley of the University of
Michigan.

Stanford football last night when it
