THE NEW ZAGAR
FIRES LP TEAM
"I'm gonna get in there and give
this one all I've got, and I want
every on this team to dj the
.same."
And with those few words, Pete
Zagar left the huddle, blocked an
Oregon punt, and Bill Willard car
ried the ball to a touchdown. Wsi
saw the new Zagar Saturday, the
best Zagar that has ever appeared
for Stanford, and the Zagar that is
finally off to his biggest vear of
j football, this time with all-American
! hopes.
We haven't given Pete a break
this year—nobody has. It did not
look at first that he cared much for
ball, perhaps had gone stale. But
there were other possible explana
tions, and we know now they were
right.
It was a toothache in the Santa
Clara game. Pete is not one to
heef about his pains, hut it is hard
to go great guns handicapped by
constant pain. In the Washing
ton State game, the burly tackle
was confused under the strain of
his shift to guard. When he was
shifted back to his old spot, he
was good hut had little chance to
prove it.
| Well,, he's all right now, and will
1 play many more 60-minute games
; —at tackle. He will still be on hand
I for a guard post in an emergency,
I but you could not want a better man
j than the Steve Keuseff in there Sat
jurday.
Hamp Pool is finally oriented to
his new spot, and he learned it fast.
: Guarding is the most highly tech
nical job on the team, and is espe
i ciaily hard for one who has always
i been a halfback. But Hamp is heart
j and soul a ball player, and he'll
I make a sincere effort to fill any as
signment no matter how hard the
test. He saw his mistakes in the
j movies of the Cougar game, and his
j work Saturday showed that he
| studied and corrected them.
JACK BRENNER
I GAINS FAME
i Many spectators, as they left the
[ stadium, were asking, "Who is this
| Jack Brenner?" Jack is a former
J Annapolis man, who came to Stan
l ford after a year with the gobs. He
I has made a fine showing in practice,
| and would have seen a great deal
more action if he hadn't been play
j ing behind Pete Fay.
Tiny gave him a chance against
j Washington State, but through a
i quirk of circumstances, he didn't
' once get his hands on the ball. But
when the knock came at the door
in the Oregon game, opportunity
I was Brenner's welcome guest.

f Stanford's 155-pound left half
back put on a show that must
have made Fay turn over many
times in his hospital hed. Bren
ner is in many ways a miniature
edition of Fay. lie is fast and
] tricky, and he has a change of
! pace that fools the hest tacklers.
He did not have a chance to prove
his ability at safety, because the
punts did not come his way, but he
has shown in practice that he can
handle the spot capably. Besides, he
is a fine tackier and a good blocker
i for his size. At any rate, Brenner
i has proved himself and will be a
I capable alternate for the star Indian
halfback.
In regard to offensive charging
and blocking, Saturday's game was
just the thii'd act in a morality play
j trying to prove that you can't have
J good fundamentals without practic
i ing them. Improvement appeared in
j this department, but there is plenty
of room for more.
Weight would have come in handy
{ against Oregon, and it will be quite
useful against the Southern Califor
! nia giants, who will come here next
I week-end to show us how they beat
| one of the best in the Big Ten, Ohio
; State, 13-7.
I NORM STANDLEE
READY TO GO
Norm Standlee will be back in
shape after two weeks' recovery
; from a sprained ankle, and will
I contribute weight from the fullback
spot. Fred Ledeboer has made a fine
showing in Standlee's shoes, and he
will play at left half this week in
j place of Fay, who may not be re
j leased from the hospital on account
| of the throat infection which caused
! his withdrawal from last week's
| line-up.
Bill Paulman is expected to be out
lof the hospital and in good shape
| for the Trojan battle. But Gene
j Coldiron showed Saturday that he
is a capable contender for the quar
ter post. His appearance in the Ore
gon game seemed to put new life
j into the team. The heavy red
, headed fireball is not only a fine
blocker and line-backer, but he is a
j good spark plug by virtue of his own
I determination to put everything he
| has into every play.
JOHN BUNN KNOWS
i TIIE VERNACULAR
Many spectators smiled when John
; Bunn, announcing in the stadium
Saturday, repeated the word "foul"
each time there was an offside or
j similar penalty. The point was that
| John coached basketball and was
! more used to "foul" than "penalty."
But the irony of the whole affair
is that Bunn was right. According
jto the rule book, "penalties" in
'football are made for "fouls."
