# Question Before the Boathouse
## 
### 
BURIED in the second paragraph of the Boat
house story on the front page is a figure,
three ciphers preceded by a dollar sign and
a fat black seven. That's what a new Boathouse
will cost Stanford if the plans drawn up are
followed.
And if any building plans are accepted,
those are the ones. Although the structure
proposed looks like the type of building
Hollywood uses beside romantic lakes, it is
simple and comparatively economical. There
are no elaborate gingerbread accessories, no
waste space for pure decoration. Long and
low, it will slide out from Lagunita's shores like
a dream straight from the Pearly Gates.
And dream it may be, for discerning Boat
house enthusiasts will see that $7,000 written
all over it, even though it is the answer to
Stanford's prayer.
That sum is just awkward enough to be ex
asperating. It isn't small enough to say, "Let's
go," nor large enough to dampen all hope.
It's just in between—where no one can get
at it.
Tonight in Ex Committee, Stanford's repre
sentatives will be faced with what is probably
the most important decision they will make
while holding office. It is two to one that a
single glance at the architect's drawing will
set their larynxes tingling to shout out a
tremendous "Aye!" when the question is
broached.
But that's only half the problem: $7,000 —
remember?
Two questions Ex Committee must consider
carefully tonight:
1. Does Stanford absolutely need a new
Boathouse?
2. Is the price of a new Boathouse too much
to pay?
The first question is one that nobody can
decide definitely. One look at the old barn
and the answer would seem to be yes. One
look at the cost of a new one and the answer
doesn't come so fast.
But the second question involves a great
deal more than the initial cost. For reasons
which will come out in the meeting tonight, the
problem may involve the future as well as
immediate financial status of the A.S.S.U. And
a question like that is one which cannot be
treated lightly.
The whole problem is so nicely balanced
that one decision based on wishful thinking
instead of reason may tip the scales—over
board. No longer is the Boathouse campaign
a lark; it is a problem which will make Ex
Committee think and think hard.
The thinking will boil around these two facts:
Stanford should have a new Boathouse but
a mistake would be costly.
Toss-up.
