# Election Daze

### 
AT 8:30 today polls will open at Engineer
ing Corner and the Law Steps, and Stan
ford's moribund democracy will receive the
usual half-hearted shot in the arm when the
few die-hards who believe in voting do so.
Because the Stanford attitude is basically one
of detachment from practically everything, off
season elections are customarily held in an
atmosphere of enthusiasm closely approaching
complete boredom. No matter what the issue,
the Farm goes on its way regardless, just a
little too busy to take the five minutes requisite
for recording its vote.
Today Stanford ballots for the first time this
year in a contest which will decide three seats
on Men's Council. Probably less than five
hundred will vote; but those who do will have
one satisfaction over and above that of choos
ing the men they want: they will be proving
to an Administration which allows its students
one of the most independent self-governments
in the country that its faith is not misplaced,
that a few of Stanford's four thousand are awake
to the responsibilities which go with good citi
zenship.—A. S. D.
