# Europe Comes Closer
## 
### 
TO The Daily has come information which
should make travel-minded Stanfordites leap
high into the air—the possibility of a trip to
Europe with round-trip passage amounting to
only $80.
Evidently nothing is definite yet. for the

American Youth Line, which proposes the trip,
has asked for definite information concerning
possible takers for their offer. At the Daily
shack are stacked small questionnaires which,
if they come back with the proper information,
may make the low-priced passage a reality.
The Daily is not going into the travel agency
business, but further information can be had
at the office. The thought of Europe, without
an expensive passage over, is too good to keep
under cover.
And too good to be true probably.
But it may be worth finding out about.
