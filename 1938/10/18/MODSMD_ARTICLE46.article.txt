# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
CAMPUS CUT-EPS
AS the Bible tells us, the sins of the fathers are
visited upon the children, and a good Christian has
no right to file complaint. But when an anti-vivisection
bill, one of the most stupid of the mistakes of the last
generation, appears on this year's ballot, even the
faithful are inclined to feel that Heaven has over
stepped itself.
Anti-vivisection as a burning Cause died at about
the same time as the double-breasted vest and the
longhorn moustache. But since then middle-aged ladies,
disappointed in love, and retired business men who
once read a Terhune dog-story, have managed to re
vive it from time to time. This year, it appears on the
ballot masquerading behind the false whiskers of legal
verbiage and passing under the alias of the '"State
Humane Pound Law."
* * * *
It is hard to see what the backers of the bill ex
pect to gain from it, unless they represent a chamber
of commerce gone berserk and are out to prove that
California can get more insane projects on one ballot
than any other state in the Union. But it is easy to
see what the real results of the act will be.
The bill provides that no animals may be used for
experimentation unless they were bred and raised on
the premises by the experimenter. This means that
medical research will stop in its tracks. It means that
doctors will have the choice of quitting their experi
ments or of turning the universities and hospitals into
kennels. It means that new serums and treatments
will have to be tried on human beings without any
previous tests on animals.
* Nt * 4>
TPHE cost of raising experimental animals is almost
prohibitive. No hospital or laboratory in the state
has the facilities. Under the proposed bill, medical re
search would become a crime.
And all of this comes up because a few slushily
sentimental people are too stupid to find a sensible
outlet for their surplus emotion. The anti-vivisection
ists have never taken the time to find out about med
ical experimentation. They picture a white-coated
witch-doctor slicing rashers off a pitiful puppy, and are
content with the picture.
They ignore the fact that if dogs had not been
used for experiment thousands of people would be
dying of diabetes today. They forget the value of
serums, of gland extracts, of neurology. They seem
to think it better that a doctor test his ideas on human
beings.
When qualified doctors denounce the plan, the anti
vivisectionists bring a stage star, a dancer, to San
Francisco to refute them.
\ * * 4 >|!
Anti-vivisection was rejected a generation ago.
And yet it comes back like a ringworm to threaten
our universities and hospitals.
The situation doesn't do much to improve our
opinion of the human race. But it makes it easier for
us to understand why so many people believe in a
wrathful God.

experimentation unless they were bred and raised on
the premises by the experimenter. This means that
medical research will stop in its tracks. It means that
doctors will have the choice of quitting their experi
ments or of turning the universities and hospitals into
kennels. It means that new serums and treatments
will have to be tried on human beings without any
previous tests on animals.

TPHE cost of raising experimental animals is almost
prohibitive. No hospital or laboratory in the state
has the facilities. Under the proposed bill, medical re
search would become a crime.
And all of this comes up because a few slushily
sentimental people are too stupid to find a sensible
outlet for their surplus emotion. The anti-vivisection
ists have never taken the time to find out about med
ical experimentation. They picture a white-coated
witch-doctor slicing rashers off a pitiful puppy, and are
content with the picture.
They ignore the fact that if dogs had not been
used for experiment thousands of people would be
dying of diabetes today. They forget the value of
serums, of gland extracts, of neurology. They seem
to think it better that a doctor test his ideas on human
beings.
When qualified doctors denounce the plan, the anti
vivisectionists bring a stage star, a dancer, to San
Francisco to refute them.

Anti-vivisection was rejected a generation ago.
And yet it comes back like a ringworm to threaten
our universities and hospitals.
The situation doesn't do much to improve our
opinion of the human race. But it makes it easier for
us to understand why so many people believe in a
wrathful God.
CAMPUS CUT-EPS
AS the Bible tells us, the sins of the fathers are
visited upon the children, and a good Christian has
no right to file complaint. But when an anti-vivisection
bill, one of the most stupid of the mistakes of the last
generation, appears on this year's ballot, even the
faithful are inclined to feel that Heaven has over
stepped itself.
Anti-vivisection as a burning Cause died at about
the same time as the double-breasted vest and the
longhorn moustache. But since then middle-aged ladies,
disappointed in love, and retired business men who
once read a Terhune dog-story, have managed to re
vive it from time to time. This year, it appears on the
ballot masquerading behind the false whiskers of legal
verbiage and passing under the alias of the '"State
Humane Pound Law."

It is hard to see what the backers of the bill ex
pect to gain from it, unless they represent a chamber
of commerce gone berserk and are out to prove that
California can get more insane projects on one ballot
than any other state in the Union. But it is easy to
see what the real results of the act will be.
The bill provides that no animals may be used for
experimentation unless they were bred and raised on
the premises by the experimenter. This means that
medical research will stop in its tracks. It means that
doctors will have the choice of quitting their experi
ments or of turning the universities and hospitals into
