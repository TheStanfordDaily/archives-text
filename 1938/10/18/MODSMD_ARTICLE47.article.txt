### DOUG JAQUES 
'JTHERE'S a fraternity man up on the How who has
a nick-name which is funny but unprintable. He
has a girl friend, as fraternity men sometimes do, and
the girl accidentally heard the nick-name the other
day. She thought it was cute. The name is in the
vernacular and she didn't know what it meant, but
she thought it was cute.
, So she calls him by that name now. He finds it a
little embarrassing when she screams his nick-name at
him from one end of the Quad to the other. His fra
ternity brothers have been making the most of it.
His girl invited him up to Sunday night supper last
week-end, and when his brothers found out about it
they made things even tougher for him. "Oh, you're
going up to her sorority for Sunday suppci - , eh?" they
would say, and exchange knowing looks.
He was very worried. Did the whole sorority know
his nick-name? Were they all going to call him by it?
He wouldn't go. He would go in spite of them. He
wouldn't go. He would go. By the time Sunday night
came and he had decided after all to go, he was a
nervous wreck. He was in such a state that it made
little difTcrencc thai everything did go off all right.
His girl still doesn't know. She still thinks it's a
cute nick-name.

That graphic arts janitor who had such a tough
time learning to play the violin was, for some reason
or other, looking for Professor Farmer some time ago.
Mrs. Farmer was in the graphic arts building, and
the janitor asked her if Professor Farmer were up
stairs.
"Say," he said, "what do you call him—Mister or
Professor or Doctor? I think I'll call him Doclor.
They like that, you know."

The Kappa and D. G. hashers had a race last
week to see which house could get through dinner
first. At 6:15 both houses started eating. At 6:21 the
Kappas left the dinner table to go in for coffee. Their
hashers snatched the dishes from the tabic, washed
them, stood over the Kappas while they gulped down
their coffee, washed those dishes, swept the kitchen
floors—and got to the D. G. house just as the D. G.'s
were going in for coffee. The Kappas of course won.
But don't tell me they didn't have indigestion.

J JERE are two people who will learn better:
In a French class the other day the instructor
mentioned a Mr. Whatsis and wondered where he
was. "Why I can't imagine," said one little fellow in
the class. "He was in my history class just ten
minutes ago."
During last week's rushing period, a sophomore
was talking at dinner with a junior transfer rushce
who lives at present in Toyon. The sophomore was
telling him all the advantages that Toyon rooms
have.
By tlv> way. the egg in my first story who told the
girl the nick-name of her boy friend has a nick-twnne
himself. It's sub-deb.
