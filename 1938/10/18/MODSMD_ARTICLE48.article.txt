# Meistersinger Music Superb, Says Reviewer
## 
### 
"Die Meistersinger." by Richard
Wagner, which will be repeated
Wednesday night, October 26, at
the War Memorial Opera House in
San Francisco, by the San Fran
cisco Opera Association:
Atlhough lacking in "big name"
stars, lesser members of the Metro
politan Opera Company turned in a

superb perform
' ance in Wagner's
story of a me
dieval trade un
ion, "Die Meister
singer."
i The story,
which is merely
incidental to the
marvelous Wag
nerian music, con
cerns a young

knight who falls in love with Eva,
who is to be the bride of the win
ner of a coming singing contest
among the Meistersinger. Walter,
the knight, attempts to join the
guild. But his rival for Eva's hand,
Beckmesser, is chosen as critic, and
the scratching of his chalk as he
marks down Walter's mistakes ruins
his song. Walter is refused admit
tance to the guild in spite of the
support of his friend Sachs. The sec
ond act is slightly confusing and not
very important to the story, but the
music is wonderful.
SONG STOLEN
In the third act Walter sings for
Sachs a song that came to him the
night before and which he plans to
sing at the festival singing contest
that day. Sachs writes down the
song, but while they are gone Beck
messer steals it. At the festival
Beckmesser sings the Prize Song, but
is laughed off the stand. Then Wal
ter sings the song and wins the hand
of Eva.
Charles Kullman is magnificent as
Walter, and he reaches the height of
his perfection when he sings the
Prize Song. Irene Jessner is Eva,
and although she doesn't look exact
ly like a young girl, her singing
makes up for it.
SINGERS EXCELLENT
Friedrich Schorr's typically Wag
nerian voice is thrilling in the part
of Hans Sachs. Of course, every
singer in the cast is excellent; it's
hard to qualify each individual per
formance. Arnold Gabor as Beck
messer deserves mention for his re
markable miming, unusual in most
opera singers. And the set diagrams
deserve a word, especially for the
festival scene.
Of course the text is in German,
but the music is so marvelous you
don't care much about the words
they're saying or the story. It's hard
to describe Wagner's music with a
word or two, but it's worth noting
that "Die Meistersinger," Wagner's
only comedy, was chosen by the
Opera Association as the only Wag
nerian opera to be performed this
season.

"Too Hot to Handle," playing
through Wednesday at the Fox-
Stanford Theater and starring
Myrna Loy and Clark Gable:
Chris is a lensman who holds
down the four corners of the globe
and outlying bars on his newsroel
beat. Chris is always ahead of the
game—always stealing the march on
his buddies. Once he almost gets
boiled by a bunch of South Ameri
can cannibals dressed up like social
ites at an Elsa Maxwell party. An
other time he hires a Chinese family
to fake an air raid shot.
The whole picture is cockeyed like
that and the plot scuds along at a
rate I'll bet you couldn't clock by a
sundial. The dialogue crackles with
hard-bitten witticism. If you said
the situations were absurd, you
would sound like the reviewer who
said Shirley Temple had no scope.
