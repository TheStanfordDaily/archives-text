# Wilbur Opens Fight Against Pound Law
## Act Would Kill Scientific Work, Says President 
### 
Joining a state-wide fight against
the Humane Pound Act, which will
appear on the November ballot as
Initiative Measure No. 2, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur issued a state
ment of his views on the proposed
amendment recently.
The local drive against the act is
sponsored by a campus committee,
with Dr. H. C. Danforth, professor
of anatomy, acting as chairman.
Acting also in his capacity as
president of the California Society
for the Promotion of Medical Re
search, Dr. Wilbur declared that
passage of the proposed amendment
would seriously hamper further
scientific research, especially at the
University of California and at
Stanford, both centers for medical
research.
The full text of Dr. Wilbur's
statement follows:
"One of the most vivid impres
sions of my life came at the time
when as a medical student I went
with Dr. Emmet Rixford to a home
south of Market Street in San Fran
cisco and held a small child while
Dr. Rixford inserted a tube in its
larynx to save the child from suf
focation due to diphtheria.
EXPERIMENTATION SAVES
"The gasps of the child, its terror,
and then its great relief when the
air passed through the tube, is a
memory not to be forgotten. Diph
theria antitoxin was new at that
time and had not been given. Ani
mal experimentation has completely
changed the course of diphtheria
and its relations to children.
"Ever since that time I have been
willing to do whatever I could do
to see that there was freedom for
the scientist and the university man
to study disease under conditions
that gave suitable protection to any
animals that were involved. The
progress that has been made is one
of the great achievements of civi
lization.
UNIVERSITIES ARE CENTERS
"The University of California and
Stanford University have been cen
ters for medical research for the
benefit bolh of man and of animals.
Now we face the so-called initiative
measure No. 2, the State Pound Act,
which would hamper and disturb
further work. The greatest service
that dogs have rendered man is
what they have done in connec
tion with making it possible through
insulin to keep hundreds of thou
sands of diabetics alive and well.
"This is only one of such services.
For the sake of our children and
ourselves, and of our horses, dogs,
cattle, sheep, hogs and chickens, we
in the universities should do every
thing possible to defeat this Initia
tive Measure No. 2."
(This is the first of a scries of
articles on the State Pound Act.
The next will appear within the
next two days.)
