ROSE& ARE RED?
The Editor, Sir:
While we are celebrating the i
drowning of the ducks we are still,
according to the experts, a long way
from the Rose Bowl. We have all
been searching for the reason and
here it is, evolved after long and
painstaking research.
How can our team be expected to I
rise and shine in mud-colored
pants? In the days when Stanford
used to beat Santa Clara what was |
the great driving force behind that ;
success? Beyond all question it was !
those beautiful red and white silk j
pants.
Here, moreover, are other exam
ples of the effectiveness of the red
trousers. We are told that insects
are attracted by bright colors. Think
of the road Pete Zagar could clear
if a yellowjacket, after lighting on i
that glittering red petunia and find
ing himself sitting on Pete's pants
should express his displeasure in
his own inimitable fashion! Think
how Pete Fay would skitter and
dodge while a swarm of ants was
convincing itself that that red dahlia
was a phony!
Let's get our team out of the mud
and into the red clover. Let's wash !
of! the mud and pull up the zipper j
on some new red pants.
