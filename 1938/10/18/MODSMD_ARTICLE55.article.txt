Gone are the hats of yesteryear;
Tradition is no longer here.
Gone is the dink of freshman yore,
Just like the hats that seniors wore;
Where are the hats of yesteryear?
Hidden by a sophomore?
I hesitate to stop the sneer
Of people who never do revere
The very tings of Stanford cheer.
We have no weakness in our core;
We have no apathy of chore!
We simply yawn. Why bother more?
Tradition is no longer here.
Where are the hats of yesteryear?
