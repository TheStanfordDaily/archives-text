There's something so easy and casual about a Raglan
covert topcoat that you actually feel as if a load has
been taken off your shoulders.
Perhaps that's the secret of their smartness, both for
dress-up and campus wear. But just "any Raglan"
won t do! For the Raglan coat is one of the hardest
models we know of to design properly. It must be cut
full and loose with just the right amount of sweep
. . . like the "West End Covert" model shown here
designed by Hart Schaffner Cr Marx.
And you'll also want to see our Genuine Harris Tweeds,
imported from the Isle of Harris and all hand loomed.
