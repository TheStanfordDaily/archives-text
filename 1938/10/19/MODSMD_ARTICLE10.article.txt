# S.P.U. Men To Debate U.S. Policy
## Foreign Affairs To Be Discussed In First Meeting 
### 
The question of America's foreign j
policy will be the subject for dis
cussion by the Stanford Political
Union in its first fall meeting to
night at 7:30 o'clock in the new Little
Theater in Memorial Hall.
Formally stated, the question is i
"Resolved, that the United States
should support Great Britain and
France with economic and military
aid in the preservation of world
peace."
"The labor party will be the cham- !
pions of the question, believing that
only through co-operation with the
two European powers can true world
peace be achieved and democracy
preserved," said Bob Wood, party
leader, last night.
THREE PARTIES DEBATE
The conservative party will take j
a negative stand and will support j
an isolationist policy which, accord- |
ing to Tim Hays, leader of the con
servative party, "is the stand taken
by every sensible American since
George Washington."
A middle course will be followed
by the liberal party, which believes !
in co-operation only if Great Britain '
and France are the attacked nations,
defending themselves against an ag
gressor. This is the stand taken by
Senators Norris and LaFollette dur
ing the World War, according to
Sherman Mellinkoff, party whip. i
TEN STUDENT SPEAKERS
Bob Wood, Gene Glasmann and
Ben Miller will be the main speak
ers for the Labor Party with Phil
Evans, Bob Low, and George Hislop
supporting them.
Speakers for the conservative
party will be Nelson Norman and
John Moskovics; for the liberals
