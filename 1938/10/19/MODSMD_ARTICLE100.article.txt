# Simple Fashions Best for Football
## 
### 
To be both comfortable and smart
at the football game, dress simply
and with due consideration for the
weather. If it looks like rain, wear
a reversible tweed raincoat, good in
rain or shine. Avoid too many extra
sweaters and jackets and having to
hold things in your lap while strug
gling with a pompon and a hot dog.
Comfortable sport shoes will get
you in and out of the stadium with
fewer mishaps, and a conservative
campus hat, if you must wear a hat,
will go by the men's rooting section
with less embarrassment. A simple
zipper purse that's easy to hang on
to will save hunting under benches
while the boys are fighting it out
on the five-yard line.
