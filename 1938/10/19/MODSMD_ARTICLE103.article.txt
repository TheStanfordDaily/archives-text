and campus clothes are enlivened
with bright suede belts and vests.
PLAIDS GOING OUT
Plaids are a thing of the past be
lieves the college fashion authority
at the White House. By spring she
expects to see checks on all the cam
puses and to herald the new style
the college department is showing a
checked wool dress with embroid
ered dots. The lumber jacket dress
with a pleated skirt is one of the
most comfortable Quad fashions to
appear in years. The White House
carries it in soft wool in all the fall
colors.
For that long trek down the row
on a rainy winter day Lenore Albert
son, Stanford graduate and college
consultant at Livingston's, advises a
cellophane umbrella with painted
flowers. To win the interest of that
football player in your 8 o'clock
wear Livingston's teal blue skirt
with stitched pleats. Startle the fra
ternity barn dance, suggests Lee
Albertson with a checked gingham,
suspender dress with a lastex waist
and a drawstring blouse made after
a "Gay Nineties" camisole, fashions
from S.F. stores.
WRAGGE DRESSES
For the girl who wants to look
softly feminine on the campus with
out looking l'ussy, Ransohofl sis fea
turing the Wragge dresses —long
sleeved, printed challis blouses with
contrasting skirts.
The Lambeth Walk has replaced
the Big Apple to be replaced—per
haps—by the waltz. At least the col
lege girl is doing her dancing in de
mure hoops, and daring, sleeveless
bodices —a fashion that is best suited
to the statelier terpsichorean styles.
CAMEO ON VELVET
To bring out the gallant beau in
your escorting "rough" wear the
White House's Civil War plaid taf
feta, with a cameo locket on a black
velvet ribbon—or Magnin's white,
mousseline de sois with embroid
ered gold dots over a hoop.
Feel fresh from Paris in Livings
ton's jeweled platform sole and wear
an ostrich feather headdress in your
piled up curls.
MANGING BLACK CREPE
Be different on the dance floor in
Magnin's Algerian dress of black
crepe with a contrasting, draped
bodice of electric blue. It hangs
straight from the shoulders and is
completely shapeless. You suit it to
your figure by adjusting the belt at
the proper level and it makes your
waist divinely small.
A new version of the old classic
dancing skirt is Livingston's lastex
beltcd, velvet skirt. Wear it with a
metallic blouse, mannishly tailored
—or an angora evening sweater with
little pearl buttons.
SONJA SILHOUETTE
When you dance in the city display
that Sonja Henie grace in the new
skating silhouette—flared skirts and
shrug shoulders.
You'll sparkle like an ice carnival
in Magnin's metallic-cloth dress in
wine and silver or feel a very sophis

ticated peasant in a velvet dirndl
with the fullness gathered in the
front.
To feel as slim as an icicle wear a
black crepe dress with a shirred
spool waist and a circlet of clips
forming a jeweled collar around the
neckline—or a moire dirndl with
shrug shoulder—found at the White
House.
If you double date in a rumble
seat stay as warm as toast in Liv
ingston's persis cloth coat. It has the
soft elegance of a Persian lamb and
the low cost so necessary to the col
lege budget. It comes in the popular
bolero length, or the extra-smart
fingertip length and is found exclu
sively at Livingston's.
Head line news for upswept curls
are the black velvet shakos with
contrasting silk jersey at Magnin's.
Curled ostrich feathers in the
Schraparelli doll hats enhance the
Edwardian mode.

and campus clothes are enlivened
with bright suede belts and vests.
PLAIDS GOING OUT
Plaids are a thing of the past be
lieves the college fashion authority
at the White House. By spring she
expects to see checks on all the cam
puses and to herald the new style
the college department is showing a
checked wool dress with embroid
ered dots. The lumber jacket dress
with a pleated skirt is one of the
most comfortable Quad fashions to
appear in years. The White House
carries it in soft wool in all the fall
colors.
For that long trek down the row
on a rainy winter day Lenore Albert
son, Stanford graduate and college
consultant at Livingston's, advises a
cellophane umbrella with painted
flowers. To win the interest of that
football player in your 8 o'clock
wear Livingston's teal blue skirt
with stitched pleats. Startle the fra
ternity barn dance, suggests Lee
Albertson with a checked gingham,
suspender dress with a lastex waist
and a drawstring blouse made after
a "Gay Nineties" camisole, fashions
from S.F. stores.
WRAGGE DRESSES
For the girl who wants to look
softly feminine on the campus with
out looking l'ussy, Ransohofl sis fea
turing the Wragge dresses —long
sleeved, printed challis blouses with
contrasting skirts.
The Lambeth Walk has replaced
the Big Apple to be replaced—per
haps—by the waltz. At least the col
lege girl is doing her dancing in de
mure hoops, and daring, sleeveless
bodices —a fashion that is best suited
to the statelier terpsichorean styles.
CAMEO ON VELVET
To bring out the gallant beau in
your escorting "rough" wear the
White House's Civil War plaid taf
feta, with a cameo locket on a black
velvet ribbon—or Magnin's white,
mousseline de sois with embroid
ered gold dots over a hoop.
Feel fresh from Paris in Livings
ton's jeweled platform sole and wear
an ostrich feather headdress in your
piled up curls.
MANGING BLACK CREPE
Be different on the dance floor in
Magnin's Algerian dress of black
crepe with a contrasting, draped
bodice of electric blue. It hangs
straight from the shoulders and is
completely shapeless. You suit it to
your figure by adjusting the belt at
the proper level and it makes your
waist divinely small.
A new version of the old classic
dancing skirt is Livingston's lastex
beltcd, velvet skirt. Wear it with a
metallic blouse, mannishly tailored
—or an angora evening sweater with
little pearl buttons.
SONJA SILHOUETTE
When you dance in the city display
that Sonja Henie grace in the new
skating silhouette—flared skirts and
shrug shoulders.
You'll sparkle like an ice carnival
in Magnin's metallic-cloth dress in
wine and silver or feel a very sophis

ticated peasant in a velvet dirndl
with the fullness gathered in the
front.
To feel as slim as an icicle wear a
black crepe dress with a shirred
spool waist and a circlet of clips
forming a jeweled collar around the
neckline—or a moire dirndl with
shrug shoulder—found at the White
House.
If you double date in a rumble
seat stay as warm as toast in Liv
ingston's persis cloth coat. It has the
soft elegance of a Persian lamb and
the low cost so necessary to the col
lege budget. It comes in the popular
bolero length, or the extra-smart
fingertip length and is found exclu
sively at Livingston's.
Head line news for upswept curls
are the black velvet shakos with
contrasting silk jersey at Magnin's.
Curled ostrich feathers in the
Schraparelli doll hats enhance the
Edwardian mode.
