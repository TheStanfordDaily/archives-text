# New Shoe Styles Take Upward Swing
## 
### 
Following the up-trend in hair,
shoulders, and waist lines, shoes
have also gone up with platform
soles. Everything from evening
sandals to oxfords has platform soles.
They are worn by short girls to add
height and by tall girls to add style.
Besides the fact that platform soles
are the fashion, they are popular
because they are more comfortable
than ordinary shoes, especially for
walking.
Another new note in shoe styles is
draped toes in dress and evening
shoes. The draping in suede gives
the appearance" of fabric, and makes
shoes look small. Scalloped edges
are also popular in dress shoes. Toe
less sandals will be worn all season
for dress, and of course for evening.
Silver is still good for evening san
dals, in addition to the new multi
colored fabric and the white satin
ones studded with colored stones.
To vary the usual flats and saddles
for campus wear are oxfords with
ski-foot toes. These awkward look
ing shoes are in direct contrast to
the feminine trend in other apparel.
The new mud-guards of darker
leather around the sole are more be
coming, although not as practical.
Suede is still the most popular
fabric for all kinds of shoes, although
doeskin is becoming more common.
Suede lastex is used for the fitted
shoes with no openings. These
glove-like shoes are mostly of the
dressy type, although some are be
ing made with Cuban heels. Gabar
dine looks like a good material for
all winter. Kid and patent leather
are being used mostly as trimming
these days.
