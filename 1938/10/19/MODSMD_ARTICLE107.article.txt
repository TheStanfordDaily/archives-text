# If You Dance It's 'Hats Off'
## Chapeaux Feature Beauty of Line 
### 
Hats in the daytime are becoming
a thing of the past at Stanford. Even
the sanctity of the rooting section
was blasted last year by loud male
objections to all and sundry chapeau.
But the evening, in spite of the
fact that hatless hotel dancers are
only too prevalent, still finds the hat
a major consideration. The new
styles are designed with the primary
purpose of dramatizing and display
ing the woman's hair and facial
beauty to the utmost, and if they
must come off before the more sus
ceptible sex will venture on the
dance floor, that is a minor annoy
ance.
Upward and forward is the hat
order of the day, and the sweeping
lines are truly flattering to the face,
even if they do preclude the possi
bility of horning on the dance tete
a-tete.
The adorable "thimble hats" are
still the pets of fashion, with their
gay feathers and trimmings piled
upon miniature brims and shallow
crowns. In other fall hats, a new
'"heavy" look that, is both luxurious
and fluttering is achieved by the use
of drapery and height in the crown
or brim.
Softly rolled cuffs adorn high
crowned hats, and richly colorful
velvets or silks are draped in high
turbans and unique toques. Every
thing is dramatic, sumptuous, richly
colorful!
