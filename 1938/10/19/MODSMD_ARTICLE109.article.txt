# Fur Buyers Warned To Avoid Pitfalls
## 
### 
If you purchase a new fur this
fall, be sure you are dealing with
a reliable firm in order to avoid
inferior quality that may not show
until the fur has been worn for a
while. Always examine the under
side of the fur for the stamp of the
dyeing and dressing firm. A desir
able feature in a fur is light weight.
In addition to giving added comfort,
a light fur drapes more gracefully.
After you get your fur you are
faced with the problem of giving it
the proper care. If it gets caught in
the rain, just hang it up to dry and
then give it a good shaking. Have
your coat weather-conditioned if you
want to avoid worrying about storms.
Always shake out a fur after wear
ing, and hang fur neck pieces upside
down to keep them fluffy.
