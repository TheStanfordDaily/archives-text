# Neat Grooming Is Necessary To New Styles
## Hair Must Be Sleek, Stockings Straight To Aid Appearance 
### 
Recent fashion has placed three
big stumbling blocks in the way of
obtaining that smooth, well-groomed
effect. They are up-swept nair, the
striking new cosmetic shades, and
shorter, whirling skirts.
A few comb strokes won't revive
an on-top coiffure which has been
damaged by rumble-seat riding, nor
will a peasant scarf preserve high
curls the way it did hair that was
worn dov/n smooth. So far, hairnets
and turbans have been the most gal
lant protectors of delicate curls.
CYCLAMEN SHADES TRICKY
Rouge and lipstick have been
mildly orange for a long time, and
because orange is a fundamental
flesh tint, these colors could never
clash, even when worn with scarlet
or magenta.
Not so with the luscious new
cyclamen. Drawn across the spec
trum, cyclamen glows most of the
way, but screeches like chalk on the
blackboard when it crosses the
shades from scarlct into yellow.
Short skirts, pleated skirts, and
full skirts not only expose more
stocking but they emphasize them.
So crooked seams, and runs are more
fatal than ever before.
NAILS MUST BE TENDED
These new problems in grooming
don't replace the eternal requisites:
polished, trimmed, harmoniously
tinted nails, tamed eyebrows, shiny
teeth and hair.
Shoes should be brushed, polished
or cleaned and run-down heels need
replacing at the first slip.
