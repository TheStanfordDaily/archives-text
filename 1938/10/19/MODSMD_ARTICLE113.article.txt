# Black Lipstick Is Red When Applied
## 
### 
An indelible lipstick that is black
in the case but turns to velvety red
when applied is the newest quirk in
cosmetics.
To complete the glamorous picture
wear irridescent eye shadow. It is
applied with a brush and comes in
silvery green, violet, bronzed blue,
and gold.
