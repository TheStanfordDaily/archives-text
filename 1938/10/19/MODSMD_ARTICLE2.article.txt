# Roll Along, Red Rolle

### 
In their first game the Indians piled up under a combination of
overanxiety and lack of training in fundamentals, according to root
ers' stands coaches. In the play at the left (1) Glenn Hamilton was
driven back from the 20-yard line to be tackled behind the goal line
for a touchback.
When the Santa Clara game started, the stands were on their toes.
(2) Didi Vibert, Howie Turner, and Jack Laney, head of Rally Com
mittee, confer on tactics. (3) Gerry Schreiber, Fern Reid, and Mary
La Rue look happy about the whole thing. But as the tide begins to
turn, some of the frosh gridders (4), whose team has just whipped
Pomona Jaysee 39-0, can see there is plenty wrong.

Although it didn't take the taste of the Santa Clara defeat away
very much, things looked brighter when the Indians took Washington
State, 8 0. From shots at the game, (8) Paulman gets off a kick in
dangerous territory; and (9) Fay starts off with Zagar blocking for him.
