In their first game the Indians piled up under a combination of
overanxiety and lack of training in fundamentals, according to root
ers' stands coaches. In the play at the left (1) Glenn Hamilton was
driven back from the 20-yard line to be tackled behind the goal line
for a touchback.
When the Santa Clara game started, the stands were on their toes.
(2) Didi Vibert, Howie Turner, and Jack Laney, head of Rally Com
mittee, confer on tactics. (3) Gerry Schreiber, Fern Reid, and Mary
La Rue look happy about the whole thing. But as the tide begins to
turn, some of the frosh gridders (4), whose team has just whipped
Pomona Jaysee 39-0, can see there is plenty wrong.

Although it didn't take the taste of the Santa Clara defeat away
very much, things looked brighter when the Indians took Washington
State, 8 0. From shots at the game, (8) Paulman gets off a kick in
dangerous territory; and (9) Fay starts off with Zagar blocking for him.

This Bronco, Coughlin, Number 20, was all
over the field for Santa Clara. In(s)he follows
good interference around end for a long gain.
Zagar is being blocked out,
(6) Bill Paulman demonstrated his reputa

out to slow down, if not to halt, Santa Clara.
This one, however, looks as if it's going to be
blocked.
(7) Coughlin appears again, this time getting
ready to stop Pete Fay.

very much, things looked brighter when the Indians took Washington
State, 8 0. From shots at the game, (8) Paulman gets off a kick in
dangerous territory; and (9) Fay starts off with Zagar blocking for him.

This Bronco, Coughlin, Number 20, was all
over the field for Santa Clara. In(s)he follows
good interference around end for a long gain.
Zagar is being blocked out,
(6) Bill Paulman demonstrated his reputa
tion for booting the pigskin when he sent punts
out to slow down, if not to halt, Santa Clara.
This one, however, looks as if it's going to be
blocked.
(7) Coughlin appears again, this time getting
ready to stop Pete Fay.

steps in "Quad red" tweed
jacket, gold-striped, black skirt,

Hat and purse are brown suede.
Coline Upshaw (3) accepts a
mint from H. B. Lee. She wears
a slate blue and burgundy dress,

In their first game the Indians piled up under a combination of
overanxiety and lack of training in fundamentals, according to root
ers' stands coaches. In the play at the left (1) Glenn Hamilton was
driven back from the 20-yard line to be tackled behind the goal line
for a touchback.
When the Santa Clara game started, the stands were on their toes.
(2) Didi Vibert, Howie Turner, and Jack Laney, head of Rally Com
mittee, confer on tactics. (3) Gerry Schreiber, Fern Reid, and Mary
La Rue look happy about the whole thing. But as the tide begins to
turn, some of the frosh gridders (4), whose team has just whipped
Pomona Jaysee 39-0, can see there is plenty wrong.
