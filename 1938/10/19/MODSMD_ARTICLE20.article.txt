# U. S. C. Dance To Take Place Of Jolly-up
## 
### 
Calling off the jolly-up planned
for next Friday afternoon, Cardinals
announced today that a dance will
be given Saturday night after the
U.S.C. game instead.
"Many students thought that Sat
urday night in the city would be too
expensive since they are raising
prices there for the S.C. week-end,
so we decided to change our plans
and give a dance here that night,"
Bill Hawkins, Cardinal dance com
mittee chairman, said yesterday.
BIDS AT A.S.S.U. OFFICE
Bids, costing one dollar each, can
be bought all this week in the
A.S.S.U. offices and at the door Sat
urday night. The dance will be held
in the Women's Gym from 9 to 12
o'clock.
Southern Cal students coming up
for the game will be asked to the
dance, Hawkins said.
GEORGE CAVALLI TO PLAY
George Cavalli's orchestra will
play while the Farm dances. Ca
valli has played extended engage
ments at Rio del Mar, and has
played several summers at Lake
Tahoe and Russian River.
Pat Skinner will again hold her
Roble date bureau for all those in
terested.
