# Committee Makes Guidance Plans
## 
### 
Plans for their first program of the
year got under way at the Voca
tional Guidance Committee's meet
ing yesterday afternoon.
Among the suggestions for the
program was that brought forward
by Miss Anastasia Doyle, faculty ad
viser for the committee, of having
an education meeting. In this case
the newer and more varied phases of
the field would probably be stressed,
such as education of adults and han
dicaped children.
A committee was appointed to take
a vocational census in women's liv
ing groups. This will entail a ques
tionnaire to be filled out by all
women on campus.
As proof of growing interest in
vocational training, Miss Doyle cited
Sunday night's meeting of the Roble,
Union, and Lagunita Alumnae Asso
ciation, at which every woman told
what the person on her right had
been doing during the past year.
A general vocational discussion en
sued, and all the women expressed
themselves as being strongly in favor
of college guidance along such lines.
