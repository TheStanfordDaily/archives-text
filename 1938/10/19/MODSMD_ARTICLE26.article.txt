# Excom Praises New Cardinals
## Dance Plans Cited As Group Approved 
### 
Ex Committee last night beamed
down at its subsidiary organization,
Cardinals, and extended a vote of
confidence and appreciation.
Cajoled by the Oregon game dance,
which Cardinals whipped up after
being charged with a "lackadaisical
attitude," Ex Committee tendered
complete forgiveness and agreed that
"they are really trying."
Formal action of the committee
followed the report, by Betty Davis,
instructed last week to tell the ac
tivity organization to "get off the
dime."
Cited as concrete evidence of
Cardinals' new vigor were the Ore
gon game dance and plans for
dances to follow the U.S.C. and
Dartmouth games.
"We'll have a generation of Astairs
before long," commented Student
Manager Tom Killefer, who moved
extension of the confidence vote.
