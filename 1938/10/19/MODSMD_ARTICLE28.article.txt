# NEW BOATHOUSE
## New Structure Soon to Rise On Lake Shore University Okays Contract Bidding As Action Rewards Campus Appeal 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
A new boathousc before the water rises—this was promised Stanford
>> its Executive Committee, which last night gave a unanimous order to
go ahead.
All that remains to be done before construction begins is signing of a
contract—now authorized by Stanford's governing body.
The job can be finished before Jan. 1. according to the representative*
of Charles Wagner & Co., who set seven weeks as the maximum time

.needed Jor construction.
Of the estimated $7000 cost, $2500
i.s to be paid out of present A.S.S.U.
funds, the remainder to be gathered
through student money - making
functions and from outside sources.
The final motion, adopted unani
mously after three other motions had
been discussed and withdrawn, was
made by A1 Horn. It was as follows:
"I move that, the Executive Com
mittee of the A.S.S.U. provide $2500
as down payment to start construc
tion on the Stanford boathouse, th<"
balance of the construction funds to
be obtained from student functions
and outside support."

Twelve entries in the Boathouse
Contest had been received at the
deadline, yesterday noon. Prize
for the winning design is two bids
to the Alumni Association's Big
Game Dance. The winner will be
chosen today by Ex Committee's
boathousc subcommittee.

Improvement of the general ap
pearance of the lake must be in
cluded in the current program for
revitalizing Lagunita, Ex Committee
agreed. Landscaping can be handled
later on, after the boathouse has
been completed, suggested Student
Manager Tom Killefer, who pointed
out that the University already has
leveled a parking area.
''We ought to get rid of all the
broken glass, boards, tin cans, and
old paper that litters up the place,"
he said.
Considering maintenance of the
boathouse after it is built. Ex Com
mittee made no final decision. There
is a possibility that maintenance can
be turned over to the Board of Ath
letic Control, according to HI B. Leo,
A.S.S.U. president, although that,
body has no obligation in the mat
ter.
Besides Daily Editor Jim Stone,
chief advocate of construction of a
new boathouse was Harry Horton,
who pointed out that the student
body's liability in case of an acci
dent at the present structure could
come to "a lot more than $7000."
He termed Lagunita "one of tho
best and finest of Stanford tradi
tions."
Members of the University ad
ministration are behind the project,
it was disclosed in the discussion at
last night's meeting.
Both President Ray Lyman Wil
bur and Registrar J. P. Mitchell
favor a series of student fund-rais
ing functions, according to Lee.
"I have been looking at the old
boathouse for 20 years, Dr. Wilbur
was quoted as saying, "and I see
more and more clearly that it is ut
terly outmoded."

leveled a parking area.
''We ought to get rid of all the
broken glass, boards, tin cans, and
old paper that litters up the place,"
he said.
Considering maintenance of the
boathouse after it is built. Ex Com
mittee made no final decision. There
is a possibility that maintenance can
be turned over to the Board of Ath
letic Control, according to HI B. Leo,
A.S.S.U. president, although that,
body has no obligation in the mat
ter.
Besides Daily Editor Jim Stone,
chief advocate of construction of a
new boathouse was Harry Horton,
who pointed out that the student
body's liability in case of an acci
dent at the present structure could
come to "a lot more than $7000."
He termed Lagunita "one of tho
best and finest of Stanford tradi
tions."
Members of the University ad
ministration are behind the project,
it was disclosed in the discussion at
last night's meeting.
Both President Ray Lyman Wil
bur and Registrar J. P. Mitchell
favor a series of student fund-rais
ing functions, according to Lee.
"I have been looking at the old
boathouse for 20 years, Dr. Wilbur
was quoted as saying, "and I see
more and more clearly that it is ut
terly outmoded."
A new boathousc before the water rises—this was promised Stanford
>> its Executive Committee, which last night gave a unanimous order to
go ahead.
All that remains to be done before construction begins is signing of a
contract—now authorized by Stanford's governing body.
The job can be finished before Jan. 1. according to the representative*
of Charles Wagner & Co., who set seven weeks as the maximum time

.needed Jor construction.
Of the estimated $7000 cost, $2500
i.s to be paid out of present A.S.S.U.
funds, the remainder to be gathered
through student money - making
functions and from outside sources.
The final motion, adopted unani
mously after three other motions had
been discussed and withdrawn, was
made by A1 Horn. It was as follows:
"I move that, the Executive Com
mittee of the A.S.S.U. provide $2500
as down payment to start construc
tion on the Stanford boathouse, th<"
balance of the construction funds to
be obtained from student functions
and outside support."

Twelve entries in the Boathouse
Contest had been received at the
deadline, yesterday noon. Prize
for the winning design is two bids
to the Alumni Association's Big
Game Dance. The winner will be
chosen today by Ex Committee's
boathousc subcommittee.

Improvement of the general ap
pearance of the lake must be in
cluded in the current program for
revitalizing Lagunita, Ex Committee
agreed. Landscaping can be handled
later on, after the boathouse has
been completed, suggested Student
Manager Tom Killefer, who pointed
out that the University already has
leveled a parking area.
