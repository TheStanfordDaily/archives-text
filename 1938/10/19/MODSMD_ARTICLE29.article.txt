# Dr. Danforth Brands Humane Pound Law as 'Veiled Act'

### JACK BURTT 
Branding the State Humane Pound
as a "veiled anti-vivisection
act," Dr. Charles H. Danforth, pro
lessor of anatomy, issue da warning
to Stanford students yesterday in
which he urged them to vote against
the measure in the November 8 elec
tions. The proposition will appear
on the ballot as Initiative Measure
No 2.
In his .statement, Dr. Danforth
charged the measure with concealing
its real intent, curtailment of medi
cal research upon living animals,
behind an outward appearance which

' represents it as merely an act to
protect pets.
Misunderstanding by laymen as to
treatment accorded laboratory ani
mals may be responsible for much of
the agitation, according to Dr. Dan
forth.
EXPERIMENTS PAINLESS
He explained j that "animals are
always anesthetized where necessary
or possible before any experiments
are performed. Operations are con
ducted while the animals are un
conscious, and observations are made
while they are still in this state. At
i the conclusion of experiments, ani

mals are, in nearly every case, pain
lessly killed, never having awakened.
"In cases where results of the ex
periment may be obtained only from
living animals, the convalescent
subjects are accorded care com
parable to that given humans in hos
pitals. Since results of experiments
depend upon ideal conditions of care,
the animals inevitably receive hu
mane treatment," he concluded.
CAMPUS GROUPS OPPOSED
A campus committee is conducting
the local drive against the act, with
Dr. Danforth acting as chairman.
Members of the committee are Dr.
Chilton H. Bush, professor of jour
nalism; Dr. Frank VV. Weymouth,
professor of physiology; Dr. Edwin
VV. Schultz, professor of bacteriology,
and Dr. Victor Hall, associate in
biology.
The Stanford committee is co
operating with a similar committee
at the University of California.
President Robert Gordon Sproul, of
California, and President Ray Ly
man Wilbur, of Stanford, are both in
support of the drive. The commit
tees are attempting to influence stu
dent votes and to get students to in
fluence their parents and friends,
according to Dr. Danforth.
BILL IS MISLEADING
The text of his statement follows:
"In a university community such
as ours, the chief concern of those
who are opposing Proposition No. 2
is to get people to read it. If the
real intent of this proposal is what
some of its proponents have claimed,
it will have to be admitted that those
who have drafted it. were singularly
inept. It is, in fact, clearly an anti
vivisection measure disguised as
something else. Despite its title and
what purports to be its intent, it is
more explicit in providing that no
animal from a pound shall be used
for 'medical, scientific or experi
mental purposes of any nature' than
it is in any other respect.
CAMPAIGN PROPAGANDA
"It is said that if this measure be
comes a lav/ it will be a protection
to pets. Except for a few ill informed
persons, I think this argument is
used almost purely as campaign
propaganda. The advocates of the
proposal woidd convey the impres
sion that most dogs gathered into
pounds are personal pets and not
the derelicts and riff-raff of our
ca line population from which we
should be able to draw material
needed for biological and medical
advancement. The avowed purpose
of the bill is to make these latter
animals, which have to be disposed
of anyway, unavailable for research
or teaching and to force medical
schools and research institutions to
raise or provide substitutes for them
in the laboratoryâ€” to the end that
two dogs will have to be sacrificed
where now it is only one.
OBSTACLE TO RESEARCH
"But, as I see it, the most serious
aspect of the bill is the spirit in
which it is conceived. It implies a
lack of faith in the moral and hu
manitarian ideals of our educational
and research institutions and is so
designed as to place obstacles in the
way of research at a time when we
particularly need to keep our path
clear from traces of reaction and
fanaticism."
(This is the second of a series
of articles on the State Pound Act.
The next will appear within the
next two days.)
