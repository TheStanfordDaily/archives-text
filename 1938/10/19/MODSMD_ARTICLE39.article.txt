# CAMPUS OPINION
## BOATHOUSE BONFIRE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Regarding the boathou.se question,
may I give my opinion?
Of course it stands to reason that 1
we need a new building so my vote
goes with the 99 44/100 per cent of
those who favor it.
However—what are we going to do 1
about the eyesore, the unsightly mess
that still stands?
Must we continue to be offended
by it every time we drive along
Mayfield Avenue? Must it waver
drunkenly in the breeze while plans
ale being drawn up and details de j
cided on?
Or, may 1 offer a suggestion which
was met with approval by everyone
with whom I talked?
Why don't we use it for the Bon
fire for the Big Game rally?
Sincerely
—G. Roussey
