The Editor, Sir:
Long and persevering has been my ,
support of The Daily as a superior i
publication compared with Chappie,!
but it is with deep regret that I
transfer my all, affections and loy- '
alty to the latter rag. Long have 1 '
fought the forces of Evil that sought i
to encompass me and drag me away I
from my beloved Dippy, but there is
no choice. I leave with downcast !
spirit and much woe in my heart, i
Amen.
My bereavement is solely trace- 1
able to your column of Tuesday in I
which some humble scribbler dug
some two years into the past to nar
rate an episode concerning the jani
tor in the Graphic Arts building.
Daily newspapers are generally
expected to stay within current sub- j
jects, but when two years becomes j
current 1 feel I have no alternative j
but to disown. My soul screameth,!
my heart cryeth out. I go.
Your most humble servant
