# Paulman May Ramble Against Trojan Horde
## 
### 
"Ilardluck" Bill Paulman, who only Monday was declared definitely
out of the Southern California football game with two severe charley
horses, now has been given a 50-50 chance of getting into the Indian line-up
next Saturday.
Paulman's newest n*t of injuries culminates a series of misfortunes

that started away back when he was«
a Vowing Soph and a Rose Bowl
star. Since that time he has had a
broken ankle, twisted ankles, in
ternal injuries, and just about ev
erything else bad that could hap
pen.
Only Ambrose Schindler, South
ern Cal's sensational quarterback of
last year and the year before, has
had a rougher time. Schindler is
almost definitely through with the
grid game after his legs failed to
hold up in pre-season workouts.
PAULMAN NOT BRITTLE
The Trojan Terror was genuinely
brittle and often played glued to
gether with huge masses of tape.
Paulman, however, contrary to
popular belief, is not brittle. He
just has had the misfortune to get
more than his share of trouble.
His appearance against the Tro»-
jans would give Stanford an edge
in kicking and passing which it
otherwise won't possess. If he does
n't recover in time, Freddie Lede
boer and Norm Standlee will prob
ably alternate in these chores with
Glenn Hamilton in reserve.
Ledeboer is a good quick-kick
artist and the squad's most consist
ent passer, but his boots won't ring
up an average to compare with
Paulman's. Standlee looked all right
in both departments during spring
practice and early fall sessions.
What a long absence has done to
his ability will be shown Saturday.
NEW PLAYS TRIED
Jack Clark alternated at left end
with Bill Willard last night as the
squad went to work on a Trojan
team composed of half a dozen sand
bags. Tiny Thornhill injected the
first team with several new plays
which he undoubtedly will try out
in scrimmage tonight.
Clark's weak arch seemed to hold
up well in his custom-built brogans,
and the former ace fiankman should
cover,much more ground and cut
more sharply now that he isn't
afraid of a possible broken leg.
Bill Kirsch wobbled into a second
string right half spot again after
missing two weeks of practice with
injuries similar to Paulman's.
Kirsch's defensive ability will make
him an able understudy for Hugh
Gallarneau.
