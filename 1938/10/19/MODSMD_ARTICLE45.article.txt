### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 18 (UP).â€”Mrs.
Mary Cusion bought a car several
months ago for her husband, John,
a WPA worker, and John got in
the habit of taking it out without
her, she said. She caught up with
him last night, sitting in a beer par
lor with two women, so she un
screwed the gas tank lid, lit a
match and tossed it in. John walked
home.
