# Water-Poloists To Play Bruins
## Diving Stars to Give Show before Game 
### 
Roy Winkelmann, Pacific Coast
champion diver for the past two
years, and Howard Adams, fresh
man sensation who won the Far
Western A.A.U. title last summer,
will give an exhibition prior to the
opening game of the water polo sea
son against U.C.L.A. Friday, it was
disclosed yesterday by Coach Nort
Thornton.
Another epidemic of colds has
kept Dick Hoover, Bob Plate, Chuck
Weeden, and Roy Vitousek from
practice sessions this week, and
Thornton has been forced to curtail
some of the scrimmages he had
scheduled in preparation for the
Bruin contest.
Don Parks, the Bruin mentor,
scouted the Indians in their battle
with the Olympic Club in San Fran
cisco last Friday evening, and a
close fight is anticipated here with
his charges.
Last year, the Card team and
U.C.L.A. fought each other to a 3-3
standstill in the regular playing pe
riod, and the champion-to-be Bruin
outfit nosed out the Cards in the
fourth overtime.
The Bruin attack will be centered
around Dick Norton, all-conference
forward, who is one of the best lob
shot artists on the coast. The South
erners have lost four men from last
year's aggregation.
