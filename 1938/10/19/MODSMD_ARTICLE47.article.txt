### 
HOLLYWOOD, Oct. 18 (UP).â€”
Film Actress Lona Andre took a
fling at a golfathon, and before she
had finished she played 156 holes
and marked up a new world record
for women.
Miss Andre began her tour at
Lake Narconian course at 5:30 a.m.
and ended it at 5:25 p.m., just five
minutes short of 12 hours of con
tinual play. One caddy accompanied
her the entire way, and she ate her
lunch on the run.
The actress' best round of 18 was
a 91, and her worst a 115.
