## JOHN SHALLENBERGER. Sports Editor Papooses Drill Against Passes For Uclan Tilt Frosh Subs to See Much Action Against Southern Gridders 
### 
Realizing that the U.C.L.A. frosh
I have in Leo (The Lion) Cantor a
i passer capable of breaking up any
ball game, Coach Harry Shipkey
, continues to drill his Stanford Pap
oose gridders in the fine art of
thwarting an opposing passing at
-1 tack.
Cantor is the brother of Izzy Can
, tor, varsity halfback ace at U.C.L.A.,
\ and is said to be a better all-around
I player than his kin. While the Bru
i babes haven't won a game yet, Can
-1 tor has almost individually kept
1 them in every ball game with his
' bullet passes and driving ball carry
ing.
A lack of reserve strength has
j been the Brubabes' main weakness
, this season, with only 15 players
on the squad who are capable
J performers. Every man in the
[ backfield has had to go the full
j route in all three games, and Coach
j Norman Duncan has but a handful
| of reserves in the line.
j Shipkey was far from pleased with
the yearling line last week against
Salinas Junior College, and as a re
j suit a number of second-stringers
, are being given special chances to
| move into starting spots this week,
i Even if no changes occur in the
line-up for the U.C.L.A. game the
j subs are sure to see plenty of action
' as Shipkey plans to wear down the
i Brubabes.
The Papoose-Brubabe game will
be played as a preliminary to the
U.C.L.A. vs. Idaho varsity tilt next
Saturday in the Los Angeles Coli
! seum.
