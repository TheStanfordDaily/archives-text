# Farm Soccermen Favored to Win
## 
### 
Swinging into action this afternoon
in their third conference game of the
season, the Card varsity soccer squad
under the tutelage of Coach Harry
Maloney are slight favorites to bring
home the bacon against the heavy
but slightly inexperienced Menlo
J.C. team.
The game will start at 4 o'clock at
the varsity soccer field.
Defense and attack teamwork has
been stressed during the past two
practice sessions. Going into the
game with probably the .same team
that started the last game, the line
up will stress passes and short kicks.
Two varsity forwards are tied for
scoring honors in games to date.
"Turkshead" Sadullah, center for
ward, scored once in each of the two
tilts, and is equaled by Di√üenedetti
who accounted for two goals in Sat
urday's game against San Mateo.
Gunther Gerbstedt is close behind
with one goal scored, on probably
the most polished scoring shot made
by the squad this season.
