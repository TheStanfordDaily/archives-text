# BOATHOUSE AHOY!
## 
### 
STANFORD WILL HAVE A NEW BOAT
HOUSE.
Ring bells, call for dancing in the streets.
Let merriment reign.
No longer will the dissolute, haggard Old
Boathouse blast all the good work that spring,
low-cut bathing-suits, and a moon can do for
Lake Lagunita.
No longer will creaking timbers and crum
bling balconies suggest that the Old Boathouse
is on her last legs:
There will be no Old Boathouse.
Instead, Lake Lagunita will play host to a
sleek, ultramodern structure that will clinch
her claim to the most beautiful spot on Stan
ford's campus.
So let there be merriment on the Farm today.
But only for today.
The fun is over now, work begins. The
A.S.S.U. has authorized only 52,500 to begin
construction. That leaves 54,500 to be garnered
before the bill falls due.
54,500 —to test the sincerity of Stanford's de
sire for a New Boathouse. This is a student
project and must be student financed.
Plans and future work will insure the fact
that Stanford will not be paying for unneces
sary trimmings. It will build a Boathouse of
which it can be proud, but it will not be throw
ing its money away on accessory Niteries or
architectural gingerbread.
But now it's up to Stanford to justify its deci
sion to build. With a Theater debt hanging
heavy over the Farm, the Boathouse financing
must be pursued with speed and diligence.
In the spring, Stanford will revel in the
clover of its newest building. And once revel
ing, Stanford will be inclined to forget that
hidden in that clover is a nest of red ants, all
tattooed with dollar signs. Before those ants
begin to sting, Stanford must rub on ointment
ointment acceptable as legal tender.
From now on out, the Boathouse must be
considered primarily as a debt, not as choco
late frosting thrown in free with spring and a
lake full of water.
So far, enthusiasm has swept the Old Boat
house off her feet—and Stanford with it.
Now is the time to look for firm footing, and
a $4,500 debt is about as substantial as the
Rock of St. Peter. That foundation held the
Catholic Church.
This one will hold a NEW STANFORD
BOATHOUSE.
