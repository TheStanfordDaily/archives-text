# Bull by the Horns
## 
### 
WHEN a travel - weary debater last year
brought back the idea of the Stanford
Political Union (a mock parliamentary body)
to the Farm, the idea took hold like chicken
pox. Stanford was strong for the chance to
air its political and social theories in a bull
session trimmed with all the appearance of
reality.
So the S.P.U. got off to a flying start. Its
new-fledged wing-feathers were clipped a little
by intervening summer vacation. But it makes
its second test flight tonight with its opening
meeting of fall guarter.
It should be a good one. Subject for debate
is controversial and timelyâ€”"Resolved, that
the United States should support Great Britain
and France with economic and military assist
ance in the preservation of world peace."
If that subject doesn't provoke lengthy,
heated discussion, none will. As smoke rises,
so will the temperature of the necks under
Unionist colars, for Stanford loves nothing more
than a bull session.
World problems may not be solved by the
Stanford Political (Jnion. But at least Stanford
is recognizing the importance of those prob

lems with spirit and discussion.
And whether the problems are settled or not
makes little difference.
S.P.U. marches on.
