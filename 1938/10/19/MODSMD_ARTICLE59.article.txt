FOR one issue each volume, The Daily puts
on high heels and steps off the measure
ments of current fashions. This is the issue.
At the same time, following its policy of
publishing a pictorial section once a month,
The Daily's photolith pages appear today,
dolled up for the first time with a color cover
page.
Art has run rampant as color, styles, and
up-hair-do's are set into type. Tomorrow The
Daily will relax into a sober newssheet once
again.
