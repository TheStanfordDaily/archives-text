NAPA, Oct. 18 (UP).—A. Lcard, a
tent-dweller in the Browns Valley
area, was troubled by the number
of fiies which were perched on the
roof of his tent home. So yesterday
he decided to get rid of them by
rolling newspapers together into a
torch and singeing the insects' wings.
Leard is unable to report whether
the method was effective as the
torch set fire to the tent, destroy
ing the home and its contents and
burning the owner.
