CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS
|>ACK in Stanford's Golden Age when people still
believed in fairies and government bonds and the
New York Giants, one of The Daily's mightiest war
riors set forth to crush the Bawlout. He hammered
it with adjectives, flayed it with logic. And after a
vehement campaign, he settled back, feeling like a
latter-day Saint George who had just gotten the deci
sion over a particularly nasty dragon. Shortly after
that, the new quarter began, and at the regular time
stacks of smug, tan Bawlouts funneled as usual through
the window of the Cashier's office.
This morning the Bawlout for fall quarter 1938 goes
on sale. It is as unpopular as ever. All of the old
arguments against it have their force. There is no
valid reason for its existence. And yet it goes on sale.

Today we lack that naive confidence that supported
the original attack on the nuisance. I know perfectly
well that anything I have to say about the Bawlout will
be ignored by its supporters with that gentle superior
firmness which is used with small children who object
to going to bed at the regular time.
But that doesn't alter the fact that by printing
grade averages the Bawlout meddles in our private
affairs in a way that even the Gestapo would call out
of bounds. The jumbled little numbers alter each stu
dent's name drag out by the hair a matter which is,
according to all ethics, his personal business.

'T'HE whole system resembles that vicious grammar
school technique of posting the grades so that the
poor devils at the bottom of the list will feel properly
ashamed of themselves.
As a matter of fact, the only justification the ad
ministration can give for the Bawlout is that it en
courages the students to work. A much more effective
technique would be to make all minus students stand
in the corner, or go to bed without supper one night
a week. The same justification could -be used.

Grade averages are like bank accounts or health
reports. They are a private matter between the stu
dent. and the University. To reveal them to unauthor
ized outsiders is betrayal of a confidence. And no false
front of second-rate paternalism can hide the fact that
when the University, prints the Bawlout, it treats us
like backward, unambitious problem-children.
But the Bawlout goes on sale today. And it will go
on sale next quarter, x-egardless of what we say. The
University cannot be convinced that paying $1000 a
year provides enough of an incentive to study.
