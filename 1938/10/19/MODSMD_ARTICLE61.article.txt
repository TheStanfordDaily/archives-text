A FRIEND of mine tells me this story, and he
swears it is true. It's about a turkey.
Four nights ago a couple of his fraternity brothers
were driving along on a lonely little road when a
turkey, they say, flew into their car. They took it, home
with them. After all, it was the turkey's idea to jump
in their car, not theirs.
One of their brothers was in the city for the week
end, and wasn't going to be back until late the next
day. So they put the turkey in his room. When this
egg got back to the house, the condition of his room, to
say the least, was not too sharp. You know how
turkeys are.
After a short and bloodless battle, it was decided
that after that the turkey would have a little coop of
his own behind the house.
Things were all right between the turkey and the
brothers until night before last when someone brought
him up on the sleeping porch about 12 o'clock. Most
of the brothers were in bed asleep, and the turkey,
after fluttering about a bit in typical turkey fashion,
went to sleep himself—until one of the boys came in
about 2 o'clock and stepped on him.
For various explainable reasons, this brother
thought the turkey was a snake. In one fell swoop he
was on the top story of a two-tier bed. This time he
stepped on one of the brothers. The brother imme
diately pushed him out. of bed—and he lit on a spot
where the turkey had been, slipped and fell flat on
his ear. He had quite a time getting up and in bed
after that.
The turkey in his turn was aroused, too. He jumped
up from the floor and lit. plunk on the chest of my
friend. "Ghastly," my friend says when he thinks
about it, "ghastly. A 15-pound turkey jumping on
your chest at. 2 o'clock in the morning and flapping
his wings over you. He looked like a ghoul or some
thing."
My friend sat up to push the turkey off, and the
turkey swatted him one across the face with his flap
pers. He laid my friend out flat. After a while lie
tried again and got the turkey wedged down between
a couple of the beds, where he stayed until six in
the morning.
But at fi the turkey started in again. He jumped
up on another guy's bed. This guy immediately covered
up his head, because you know how turkeys are, and
stayed that way for about 5 minutes until the egg in
the bed above opened ihe window, calmly reached
down, and swooped the turkey out.
About this time the boys who had brought the
turkey home originally woke up and saw their turkey
drifting out the window. They jumped frantically out
of bed and down into the back yard after the turkey.
When they got there they saw him flapping on down
the road. In their bare leet they started after him
and caught up with him at Frenchan's Tower.
They got home about dinner time. They weren't
lynched.
YESTERDAY in Mr. Weight's 11 o'clock journalism
class one of the boys was telling about a matfa/ine
ofliee in the city that he had visited. "It was a small,
dinky little office.' he said. "Just like yours. Mr.
Woiele "
