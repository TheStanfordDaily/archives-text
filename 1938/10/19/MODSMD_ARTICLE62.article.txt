# Pure Realism Distinguishes Irish Novel
## 
### 
Written with a classic simplicity
which gives its familiar story new
life, Howard Spring's "My Son, My
Son!" is the long, stormy, and dra
matic record of what happens when
two men whose youthful dreams
have not come true try to make them
come true in the lives of their sons.
Because William Essex had a
harsh and terrible boyhood before he
achieved success as a best-selling
novelist, he gave his son Oliver ev
erything, denied him nothing. Be
cause Dermot O'Riordan had been a
romantic and wild-eyed Irish patriot
before his artistic tastes took him
into successful furniture-designing,
he dedicated his son Rory to the
cause of Irish freedom.
CONFLICT BETWEEN FRIENDS
By the time Mr. Spring has
brought his story to the point where
Captain Oliver Essex of the Black
and Tan has killed his once-best
friend Rory O'Riordan of the Irish
Republican Army, he has introduced
his readers to one most vivid gal
leries of characters in recent years,
and has proved conclusively that life
can be a hard and pretty hopeless
business.
SACRIFICE OF YOUTH
Neither William nor Dermot ever
forgets the tragedy of his own youth;
and neither is spared the tragedy of
his son's. Because Oliver has all the
things which William was denied, J
he enters the war a dangerously,
spoiled boy and emerges from it a
savage and embittered man. Be
cause Rory obediently offers him
self in the Irish cause, he dies a
stupid and pointless death. In a
sense each is a sacrifice to youth;
not his own, but his father's.
Distinguished by complete hon
esty and lack of pretense, "My Son,
My Son!" manages to achieve a
realism which makes its impact as
immediate as life itself. For this
reason if no other, it stands head
and shoulders above most of this
year's novels.
