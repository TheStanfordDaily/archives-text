# Quad Clothes Strive For Casual Comfort
## 
### 
Wo may have our frills and furbelows for evening, our furs and glitter.
l»tit in our smug and protected college world, we must close our eyes to
lliese garnisliings and speak man-to-man, or rather woman-to-woman,
about Quad clothes.
l or live out of seven days of the week, and for fifteen hours at the

1< i, we prance blithely or
wise over those well-worn paths to I
and from classes. We smile at our
friends and acquaintances, and men
tally note "flow ghastly Mary looks
in that old rag she has draped
around her,"' while inwardly we glow (
at our own smart attire.
QUAD CLOTIIES SIMPLE
Despite the chaotic colors and 1
.it I-.; oi the current season, the key- 1
noli- of charm on the campus is good i
taste. Our mothers and teachers
may have superficially imparted this!
to us in our pre-college hibernation,
but. in many cases those gems of wis- j
<lom have remained resting dormant j
in our sub-conscious minds.
A masculine senior, when ques- |
tinned recently, confided that he j
might turn and gaze at the girl who ■
wears two-thread hose, high heels, aj
: ilk dress and jewelry on the Quad,!
but he would prefer that his girl j
wear sport dresses, or sweaters,!
skirts and low heeled "flats" to j
classes. Men are essentially con-!
: ervativo about their women's j
clothes.
LOW lIEELS BEST
The short girl may try to appear j
taller and slimmer in high heels, but!
how do her feet feel? The gravel of
our campus ii> not conducive to the!
comfort of pumps.
'I lie woman with "piano legs" may |
try to enhance their beauty by sport- j
ine spike heels, but they only tend!
1o make those monstrosities the
ryne: me ol all eyes. In other words, !
smartness on Quad is achieved by I
covering up our defects rather than j
accentuating them.
NO I UK COATS
Ihe "smart' girl may try to wear I
out her old clothes by wearing them j
to classes, but unless they are plain
and appropriate, it is wiser to stick)
to the conventional.
Ding fur coats on Quad too. Save j
them for evening. This is California'
and they aren't necessary to shelter!
us from the cold, and they look like 1
drowned rats in the rain. How do!
you like fur coats with brogues pok
ing from beneath? What an ana- 1
chronism!
'1 he Stanford woman of today j
strives to be smart while studying l
in the Li be as well as dancing at the!
Mark. Her goal is casualness. Her'
creed is simplicity. She fancies
Spalding saddles and cashmere
( ardigans and pull-overs. If it rains
she dons "roller" hats and tiny "lids." j
She may frown on galoshes and
umbrellas, but she prefers them to j
bronchitis and chills. She is sure- i
looted and comfortable for her!
clothes aid disposition, efficiency and !
date-ability.
