# Rough Still Conservative
## Gray Slacks, Slip-on Sweaters Rate Tops 
### 
At heart a conservative, the Stan
ford Rough has returned to the Farm
this year with his customary Quad
uniform unchanged. Gray slacks
and slip-on sweaters still predomi
nate, varied occasionally by brown
gabardines, cords, and moleskins.
Conservative striped shirts have
taken the place of last year's Ha
waiian craze, subordinated by plain
whites, browns, and blues.
Brown crepe-soled shoes are still
the most popular 011 the campus.
Fitting well with any of the color
variations prevalent in sweaters,
Cordovans run a close second.
TIES UNPOPULAR
Ties, while never popular on
Quad, are found in yellow and var
ious combinations of red. Herring
bone sport coats are worn on cam
pus after school hours, and beer
jackets, new tab shirts, polo shirts,
inner-outers, and bantanacs are also
customary.
This year Stanford belt buckles
are increasingly noticeable. Most
common are those featuring the
plain Stanford lettering, the raised
Indian, mid the school seal. These
three varieties predominate.
JEANS FEATURED
Jeans and sweatshirts are a favo
rite combination with freshmen,
promising to start a minor fad among
upper-classmen.
Socks tend to i*un to moderately
conservative blues and browns,
with an occasional flamboyant red or
yellow note thrown in to attest that
the Stanford rough is not quite
dead.
SUITS RARE
Suits are confined almost exclu
sively to graduate students, and are
never worn by undergraduates on
Quad.
Rainy season brings out an assort
ment of rain-coats, rain-hats (gen
erally strip-down rooters' caps), and
wet-weather shoes, usually the old
est pair available.
Designed for utility rather than
show, Quad clothes may look some
what. haphazard to the visitor; but
Stanford knows they are comfort
able, and that's all that's necessary.
