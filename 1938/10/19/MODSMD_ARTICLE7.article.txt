# Sophs Consider Cotillion Plans
## Committee to Decide Dance Dress Tonight 
### 
Issuing a call for all committee
workers on the Sophomore Cotillion
to meet at the Women's Clubhouse
tonight at 8 o'clock right after the
Jolly - up, Bob Anderson, general
chairman of the event, disclosed that
the dance "may not be formal."
"The meeting tonight will deter
mine this point," Anderson said.
Original plans had set the dance as a
formal affair. Tonight's meeting will
round into shape committee activity
and decide arrangements for carry
ing out the "Let's - go - slumming"
theme.
Anderson stressed the fact that,
though the dance is known as the
Sophomore Cotillion, all students in
the University are invited to attend,
"We're especially welcoming the
frosh this year," Anderson added.
Campusters will swing on the
night of Nov. 4 to the music of Eddie
Fitzpatrick's orchestra. Well known
to Farm dancers because of his long
engagements in San Francisco, the
Bay City maestro will play in the
Women's Gym, altered into a replica
of Limehouse. Stage sets combined
with unusual lighting arrangements
will execute the "slum" idea.
