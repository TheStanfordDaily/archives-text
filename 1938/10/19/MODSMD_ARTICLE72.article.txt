# Styles Unchanged For Bull Sessions
## 
### 
For that after-lock-out bull ses
sion or pre-exam cramming, fash
ions are little changed. As ever,
simplicity and comfort are in favor.
Man-tailored cotton broadcloth pa
jamas in bright colors and odd
prints give maximum in style and
comfort for lounging and sleeping.
For colder nights long flannel robes
in wrap-around or zipper styles are
still preferred.
For those who like feeling femi
nine, housecoats and nightgowns are
stil popular. Pastel colors are seen
more often with the new trend to
ward femininity.
