# Year's Fashions Feature Romantic Feminine Trend
## 
### 
This year's collide fashions reflect the more romantic trend of Paris
and New \ork styles. It might he called a year of velvet and jewels, syn
! tlictic or atherwi.-e. Even the campus fashions are softer and more feminine
than in other years, with an accent on hand knits and soft tweed jackets.

It is definitely a year for the ex- I
treme types—the small girl who must
wear feminine styles and for the tall
girl who needs the flattering soft!
lines that are the keynote of this i
year's fall fashions.
The Paly shops report an added
interest in jackets, all sorts of
jackets. There are the long boxy
styles, short fitted jackets, plaid
jackets, striped jackets, and plain
jackets, all of the softest tweeds.
Fashion wise co-eds will have two 1
or three of these to wear with var
ious skirts.
Sweaters are decidedly longer and j
looser this year, loose to the point of,
sloppiness. There has been shown 1
a preference for shetlands and hand
knits over the popular cashmere of
last year. However, good cashmeres
are as fashion wise as ever, and if j
you are the champion of English
cashmeres that we are, you will keep
on adding the softest ol' cashmeres
to your collection. If you can stand
the fuzz, and the men don't object,
the Paly shops have some luscious
angoras on display.
This is a wonderful year for the
kind of date dresses and suits that 1
will make you leave your pet formal 1
hanging in the closet. Black velvet is
the- theme song of a great many
Stanford girls, because of the flatter
ing things it seems to do to your j
skin and hair. You will see descend
ants of this summer's dirndl in velvet
date dresses, although we rather
prefer soft swinging skirts without
the dirndl influence. With Irish lace
and the lovely old fashioned jewelry
that is so good this year, there are
endless possibilities for making your
thirty-dollar date dress look like
Valentina.
We might add that a cute chate
laine or a little round watch will i
dress up your black suit no end. A j
dressy black costume suit is won
derful for dancing, or the theater,
or a dinner date. This type of an
outfit also lias a habit of looking
like Valentina, who incidentally, is
one of our favorite designers.

chops in Paly. It can be lovely for
evening wear with the new romantic
foi mals, but for daytime wear, defi
nitely no! If it is becoming to you
and the current favorite escort ap
pri ves, by all means wear it up with
your new full skirted formal. This
style is definitely up to the indi
vidual, but we predict that it won't

Only a word of warning about hats
—get away with anything. Have fun
with the cute new hat styles, but not
too much fun, unless you care to be
laughed at.
Anything imaginative goes in the
new formal styles. We can have
skirts as full and swirling as we
please with all sorts of romantic pos
sibilities. This year's lady of the
evening will be a lovely lady, we
predict.
