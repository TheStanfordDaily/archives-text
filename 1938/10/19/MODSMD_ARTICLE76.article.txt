# Heaven Will Protect the College Girl--Maybe?
## Upswept Coiffures And 8 O'clocks Don't Mix 
### 
No rest for the working girls! And none, this year, for the college
woman who, in the face of 8 o'clock and hockey, and getting in at
2:30 without a maid to put her to bed in style, is supposed, according to
fashion, to look like a cross between a Rajah's favorite and Queen Vic
toria's lady-in-waiting.

The shops, the coutouriers, the'
fashion experts, linked as they are in
a horrible conspiracy, all pronounce
the day of the long bob over. And
with it goes everything careless and
windblown, so dear to the college
woman's heart. Dear for two reasons
—because, unless she carries things
to an extreme, she is young enough
to get away with it, and because she
hasn't time for the combing, curling,
and general overhauling more for
mal fashions require.
Instinctively, realizing she can't
go the whole way, she has adopted
the "When in doubt, compromise"
attitude. Up-hair, except for a few
i*' happy exceptions—and that rare
creature, a happy one, is out, strap
less formals and short skirts are in,
hoop skirts hang, swaying, in the
balance. Hoop skirts are likely to
hang anywhere, a car door or a din
ing room chair being favorite places.
Perhaps the fact that the college
woman has managed to hold out
against fashion as well as she has is
proof of the benefits of higher edu
cation. If Sociology and Econ hadn't
helped her to realize the futility of
it all she might be trying to reach
greater heights—with hair and ev
erything that goes up with the hair,
shoes, afternoon necklines, shoulder
lines. She has, at least, the com
forting thought that, according to
tradition, it is all bound to come
down eventually.
She has had the good sense to keep
away from spats and dog collars—
just because they did things for
grandmother is no reason for their
doing things for her, and she will,
perhaps, come eventually to realize
that what is most sensible, and at
the same time makes her most at
tractive, is the best thing to wear.
There is, however, such a thing as
separating the wheat from the chafT,
even in fashion. The college woman
can't afford diamond gee-gaws and
little ruby tidbits that won't be the
thing next year, but she can go in
for a few of the milder fads, if they
won't force her father to declare
bankruptcy and leave her in a
condition in which she can still be
recognized by her better friends.
Platform soles, particularly for danc
ing, do away with an awful lot of
foot fatigue, and strapless evening
a'resses are enticing enough—if a
w\ >jnan is built the way she should
bo—to do away with scruples as to
whether or not they'll get by next
winter.
If the college woman can't wear
very tight waists and full short
skirts now, she'll never be able to
later. The same goes for leg o' mut
ton sleeves, naked shoulders, and
Victorian lockets and black velvet
bows.
If one can manage to get past the
inexorable "Hair must go up" die
turn, meeting it face to luce in the

dark forest and coming out un
scathed, the chances are this year
of grace, 1938-3y, won't be so bad
jlfter all. Bv and large, fashions
this year are more becoming to
youth than otherwise—as fashions
almost always are—and the college
woman would be wise, in so far as
her purse permits, to make hay while
the sun shines.
