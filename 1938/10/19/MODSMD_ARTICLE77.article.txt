# Fall Colors Run Rampant
## New Hues Enhance Autumn Wardrobes 
### 
With the campus "smoothies" vic
ing for the honor of "Best dressed
man," and exhibiting their acid
green slacks, herringbone coats in
near-rainbow hues, and near-yellow
pedal coverings, the women are hard
put to it to keep their clothes from
sinking into banal color nonentities.
In the ante bellum era, nothing but
color complements were combined.
The traditional rod and blue, yellow
and green in conventional shades
were assiduously adhered to.
COLORS MIXED
But dawn the fall of '38, and the
college woman grabs at every hue,
mixes nearly every color. Plaids and
stripes are everywhere, for evening
as well as daytime, and have the
nation's favor this season. Appar
ently the gaudier the better.
However, rich colors such as du
bonnet, fuscia, violet, and plum are
running a good race whether used
singly or in combinations. And you
still can be conservative as well as
smart in blacks and whites.
NEW SHADES
Add to your color-vocabulary such
shades as Aerostatic purple, cameo
pink, Uranus yellow, grey-violet,
orchid-red, for the Paris designers
are sponsoring them. Firebrand is
blazing as a popular new shade.
Grandmother would have raised a
supercilious eye-brow at bilious
green but Schiaparelli nods in ap
proval.
Metallic cloths of gold and silver
as well as multi-colored sequins and
beads are popular and practical as
blouses and jackets to wear over
formals for less auspicious occasions.
Glamour is in the air, so choose your
colors and fall in line with '39.
