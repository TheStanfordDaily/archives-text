# Court May Force Rabies Medication

### 
MENLO PARK, Oct. 18 (UP). â€”
The parents of two 14-year-old high
school students bitten by a dog that
proved to be rabid refused today to
permit the children to undergo
Pasteur treatments to forestall any
possible infection.
The parents insisted the wounds
of Robert Stentiford, 14, and Ruth
Hennel, 14, were only trivial and
the Pasteur treatment was not an
infallible preventative.
Robert and Rtuh were bitten last
Thursday by a stray fox terrier
while they were boarding a school
bus. The dog was captured and
taken to an animal shelter, where
it died. An examination showed the
animal to be infected with rabies.
The alternative open to the au
thorities was to seek court action,
to compel the children to undergo
treatment. An infection might prove
fatal.
