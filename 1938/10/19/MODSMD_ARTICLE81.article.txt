# New Fad Matches Slippers, Jewels
## 
### 
The new platform soles on shoes
are giving the creators of evening
slippers unlimited scope in ornamen
tation.
With the craze for jewels and glit
ter, it is now possible to match your
slippers and your jewelry. With
pearls you can wear shoes with
pearl-studded soles and heels, and
you can follow the same scheme with
sequins, paste diamonds, or with
any other popular ornament motifâ€”
even with feathers.
