days ago, our Women's Edi
tor sneaked up on me while I
was trying to fix a typewriter and
asked me to write a critical com
ment on women in general and fash
ions in particular. Absent-mindedly
I brushed the ribbon out of my
mouth and said yes, before I knew
what I was promising. Later when
I tried to back out she treacherously
held me to it.
As I gave in, I pointed out that
all I knew about fashions came from
a hasty glance at the lingerie ads,
and that the very fact that I con
sented indicated that I lacked the
sour disposition necessary for criti
cal comment. But having obtained
my promise, she left abruptly, like
Delilah whipping out the door with
Samson's hair.
And so I approach the subject,
feeling presumptuously foolish, like
a man who finds that he is the only
male at a sorority supper.

As a matter of fact, it is impossible
for a man to make any valid com
ment on a woman's appearance.
Through five thousand years of
civilization, woman has developed
the science of camouflage and con
cealment, so that today we see them
only after they have remodeled
themselves to suit their taste.
Back in the stone age the ordinary
damsels wore fig leaves, and a debu
tante was the season's sensation if
she had a bit of leopard skin. Under
those circumstances an accurate
judgment was possible; in fact it was
almost unavoidable.

But today every girl has taken
refuge in science. Her complexion
may be by courtesy of the Cutie
Beautie Shoppe. Her curling hair is
the product of machinery. Her glam
orous figure may owe a credit line
to any one of a dozen varieties of
girths and cinches, all designed to
match stresses and strains with the
best principles of engineering.
No one, of course, blames the
dear girls for these redecorating
projects. It makes the landscape
brightex - , and it makes it possible for
the human race to carry on instead
of knuckling under to some brand of
insects.
Trouble comes because the women
aren't content with one appearance.
They keep changing the specifica
tions, and so while the man remains
a constant quantity, the woman
fluctuates through the scale.
s |c * $
Women shift easily and suddenly
from the slim, boyish figure to
rounded voluptuousness, and the
scales remain constant. Hair goes up
and down like stock market reports.
The demure angel in ruffles becomes
a bounding sprite in slacks.
If it gives them any pleasure, I
suppose that we ought not to com
plain. But it is a little disconcert
ing to note these abrupt shifts. And
it is annoying to become attached
to a girl and then find that she has
cancelled herself.

upon a time, back in the
! sixth grade, I took a course in j
j nature study. We went out and
looked at the birds, and the bees,
and the flowers. We were supervised
by a woman with a jaw like the
Pithecanthropus Erectus, who wore I
a gray-brown outfit that might have !
been picked up by a rescue crew
after the Titanic went down. I could ,
never understand why the female i
birds were always gray and the male j
birds were such pretty colors.
One day I exhibited my ignorance j
and asked her, and she beamed at j
me, probably feeling like Socrates,
patting Plato on the head, and said,
"In Mother Nature's great out-of- ;
doors, dear, the male is always more j
brilliant than the female." Which!
made me wonder quite a lot.
After getting to be a big girl I
I took history courses and found out |
j that Elizabethan men used perfume
and that French courtiers were not ;
above enhancing their cupid - bow
mouths.
* * *
Now, we are far from advocating!
a complete return to the days when j
Adam took all the pretty green fig i
leaves and left Eve with a few dry
twigs. It's all we can do to stand up j
{ under the smell of our own perfume |
â€¢ without having it conflict with our j
[ escort's. And the double standard
| still being what it is, women would j
| undoubtedly be more compromised j
j than men are by having their house
mothers wipe off lipstick in unex- ;
pected places.
All we ask is something washed,
brushed, and shaved. Considering j
the lengths to which women will go '
'in the delusion that they are pleas- i
ing the opposite sex, men might at [
least make some feeble gesture, like j
buying a toothbrush, toward being j
more attractive.

If they can't consider us they
might consider themselves. One of
them may look in a mirror someday
and die of fright. If a woman can
get up at eight o'clock and be at
class by ten minutes past, with lip- j
stick on and her stocking seams;
j straight, men could at least manage j
I to get out of their pyjama tops and
' into a clean shirt. If it would expe
| dite matters they might try sleeping
without the pyjamas.
Perhaps they can't all afford din
ner jackets, but most of them can
beg, steal, or borrow a dark suit
when the women are wearing long
dresses. If I, pei'sonally, have never
done anything else to merit the Le
gion of Honor, I once made a man go
home and change who told me to
wear a long dress and turned up in
a checked coat and white shoes. !
