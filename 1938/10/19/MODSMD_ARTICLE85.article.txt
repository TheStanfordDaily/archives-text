# Victorianism Is Key To Formal Fashions
## 
### 
Formal clothes this season have the lavishness of Victorianism with
none of its prudishness.
The year's decadent color combinations —mustard yellow and pale
violet, orchid and bright red—any archeologist will tell you mean that
civilization is going to pot, any business man, that it looks like a good year.

Brown is no longer somber and<
taboo when it is net and strewn with
bronze spangles. Black is no longer
plain when you can wear it with a
flame red turban or an Elizabethan
snood spattered with glitters.
A chartreuse chiffon or a wild pink
taffeta are no longer tiresome when
you can change the whole picture
with a brocade jacket, leathers in
your hair, all kinds of bangles on
your wrists.
Jewelry for evening is big and
chunky or dainty and demure. Even
a velvet dog collar mounted by a
single stone won't make you look
like an old maid.
If you let your imagination run
riot in the choice of evening slippers
to match your jeweled hair clips and
bracelets, you will be definitely in
the swing of the evening fashions.
Fabulous Cinderella slippers of velvet
and jewels are Vogue's masterpiece.
Sequins and paste diamonds will
flash on your dancing feet.
Amazingly lull skirts and old-fash
ioned drop shoulders won't be
termed sentimental this year, and
candy box silhouettes are but defi
nitely the thing.
A full moon and Strauss waltzes
will be a fitting background for you
in your fabulous skirts and your
jewels, whether genuine or from
Macy's first floor. Upswept curls, if
you like the new hair dos will fairly
drip with flowers and jewels. As we
said before, anything goes.
All the brocades and feathers and
slipper satins of a Victorian princess
may be yours, plus the sweeping
skirts and full silhouettes of a hun
dred years ago.
If you must have slinky black
velvet, you may be sheathed in black
from shoulder to wrists. No less
than six jewelled bracelets may be
worn at once.
It looks like a good year.
