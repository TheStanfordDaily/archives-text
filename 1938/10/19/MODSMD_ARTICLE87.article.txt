# Originality Vital For Street Wear
## Bizarre Colors Vie For Style Spotlight 
### 
College girl or matron, debutante
or secretary, this year's street
clothes demand originality plus dar
ing. Suits, as usual, are practically
a necessity to every feminine as well
ias masculine wardrobe. Smart little j
dressmaker suits in any of the fasci-1
| nating new colors, plum, teal blue, or j
j Schiaparelli's cameo pink are fashion j
j headlines.
Boxy plaid jackets are very smart j
i but many still prefer the classic:
j favorite, a strictly tailored suit made i
j doubly interesting by giddy little I
i lapel gadgets, latest brain waves of j
| famous jewelers.
WOOL DRESSES IN WARDROBE
| Wool dresses still constitute a large
1 part of any wardrobe, particularly !
i the collegiate. Never have the styles ;
! been so flattering. Short and sweet !
j is the keynote, dirndles eropping out I
j anew with gayer necklines and yards I
j of skirt cut short to reveal smart !
! new stocking shades. High, leg o' I
mutton sleeves and flattering pleated !
skirts make up the dressier wools. I
Plaids are rampant, and the smart- |
est use for black this season is in j
i combination with a brilliant costume !
I color.
| Hats and accessories are madder
! than ever. Incredibly tall feathers on
| bright felts, tilted on the head in a
j manner that defies all laws of gravi-
I tation pass for hats. The revolu
| tionary gloves are made "finger
j free" by a new stitching to allow
! greater hand freedom. Shoes cut
i like ski boots, clumsily square, and
the platform soles are newest foot
wear notes. Jewelry is loud and in
dividual. Anything on the wrist
from Roman coins to your address
and phone number on tiny hand
carved charms. Pearls are still a
1 unanimous choice but roped in a
newer and more interesting manner.
' The nineteen thirty-eight fashion
> credo is "Be Different" to be smart,
in styles, colors, and accessories.
The newest evening jackets are
quilted and padded like those of
a Chinese princess.
