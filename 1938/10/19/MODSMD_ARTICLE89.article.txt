# Paste Jewelry Vies With Victorian Lockets

"No stone unturned—in today's
jewels," says Vogue. The influence
of East Indian jewelry has brought
big jewels into the fore again. These
include many of the semi-precious
stones, and topazes, moonstones, and
amethysts are coming into their own.
Tourmalines of all colors and sizes
(you can get huge ones very rea
sonably) are being set as carefully
as rubies or emeralds. Topazes in
gold settings are being revived and
reset—sometimes along with dia
monds. Coral and turquoise com
bined are setting a new color note,

and it is right to wear them along
with splashy paste diamonds or next
to beautifully mounted stones.
Gold is more popular than ever
this year. Great gold leaves, often
veined with 6hip dfamonds or rhine
stones, are just the thing for reliev
ing black, as clips or buekles. Plati
num and silver settings are all being
gold-washed, and massive gold
bracelets cover milady's arms. Gold
embroidery and appliques encrust
coat shoulders and waistlines of
gowns.
Victorian jewels are in great de
mand. Since the new coiffures are
high and neck lines are low, chan
delier earrings and high dog-collars
are being worn to hide that naked
effect. Cupids and bow-knots, min
iatures and old enamel, adorn
brooches and lockets. Velvet ribbon
is used to tie the ends of pendant
I necklaces, or is made into bows
worn at the ears. Side combs and
I hairpins are crusted with gems, and

pocket-watches futng from chains
looped around the neck.
Pearls are seen everywhere. Seed
pearls hang in fringes or mount large
stones. Pendant earrings or neck
laces of pear-shaped pearls of all
sizes and colors are very new. Of
course, as a campus favorite over
sweaters, single or double strands
of pearls are better than ever.
Also popular for campus wear is
the new bunchy jewelry, usually a
necklace with matching bracelet.
Clusters of leaves or gold beads or
little wooden buttons, hanging from
a single chain produce this effect.
Jeweled knick-knacks are more
original and still hold popular fancy.
Gold epaulets to wear on the shoul
j ders of your evening gown are the
! newest fad. A gold drum bracelet
I laced like a military drum, is another
: one of the latest crazes.
I In any event, if you \vant to be
i smart this year, be lavish with
| jewelry.
