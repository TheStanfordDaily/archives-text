JERUSALEM, Oct. 18 (UP). —.
British troops aided by Royal Air
Force planes tonight laid siege to
the walled "old city" of Jerusalem
in an offensive against the Arab re
bellion that has claimed nearly
2000 casualties since early July.
It was the first siege of the Bib
lical city since Saladin, the first
Ayyubite sultan of Egypt, stormed
its walls 850 years ago and drove
out crusaders under Richard the
Lion Hearted.
The rebels, after barricading the
old city's historic gates from the in
side, burned the police station and
apparently were in full control of
the old city. The British troops
could reach them only by storming
the walls built in 1517 by Selim 1
of Turkey after he had seized the
city from Egyptians. The actual
state of affairs within the old city
remained obscure, but apparently
j civil authority there had broken
1 down.
