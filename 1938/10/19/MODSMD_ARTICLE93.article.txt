# Quadwear Unchanged as Roughs Go British for Night Clubs
## Cashmere Sweaters Hold Lead Single-Breasted Black Overcoats Popular For Evening Wear 
### 
Wo sing of clothes that make the 1
man,
Of herringbone and cordovan.
Things look about the same on
English Corner this year with slacks, |
sweaters and T-shirts in the Stanford
manner. Biggest change in the pat- 1
tern is the presence of pint-sized
freshman (average age 17 years, 2
months) in pint-sized pants.
Cashmere sweaters occupy an even
more important spot in the campus
wardrobe than they did last year;
green is the up-and-coming color. ;
Everybody likes herringbone tweed 1
slacks, but covert is rapidly taking ;
over. However, don't throw away !
your last year's bedford cords and j
gabardine. And, of course, flannels !
are always good.
ON THE QUAD
On the Quad, trousers are a little I
longer this year, but all those plu- ,
tocrats who own Argyle socks will ]
still wear theirs '"high water." Solid
colored slack socks look swell and !
don't hang down around your ankles.
Of course you've noticed that |
everybody's shoes are either at one j
end of the spectrum or the other, j
Natural pig-skin and ox-blood cor- i
dovans account for the contrast.
Polo shirts hanging outside your I
trousers can be scratched oil your \
list this year. Belts are still narrow |
and anemic.
SPORT COATS
Swinging to the same level of |
popularity they held last year, her- [
ringbone tweed .sports coats are still '
right up in there. Some of our'
smoother men are appearing in I
solid-color camels' hair jackets to
vary the monotony.
Single-breasted British sack mod- ;
els, with three buttons and plain j
backs, are universal.
It's herringbone again in suit fab- l
rics, but you can get every possible .
variation on the familiar theme. It j
still looks as though single-breasted j
suits are holding their own, but there :
are always double-breasteds for the j
old conservatives. Your trousers'■
should just touch the tops of your ;
shoes.
TUXES UNCHANGED
Tuxes are about the same this
year, but tails look as though they !
may pass them in the stretch. Never !
let yourself be seen in patent-leather !
pumps. Both black and white ties
are narrower with pointed ends.
Wear a dark red carnation in the
buttonhole of your tux, and a white
one in your full-dress—but better
none at all than one made of syn
thetic rubber. For all campus func
tions and most dates in the City, a
turn down collar is smaller and more
comfortable than a wing collar with
a dinner jacket.
BRITISH PREDOMINATES
The best all-around overcoat for
evening wear is a single-breasted
black coat with a fly-front. If you
have football hips and shoulders you
can wear dark double-breasted coats,
fitted at the waist.
For all other occasions the coat of
the minute is the British raglan
model; the usual material seems to
be herringbone. The reversible over
coat is popular—so popular that
some men wish they'd never bought
one. But it's a practical thing to
own.
