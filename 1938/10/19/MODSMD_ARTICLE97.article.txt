# Victorian Influence Brings Back Muffs
## 
### 
After a brief revival of the muff
a lew years ago, they faded out of
the fashion picture for a while. In
the present trend toward Victorian
j modes, muffs can hardly be over
looked.
Evening muffs are tinier than
ever, with huge bouquets of violets
or sprays of lilies pinned on them.
Daytime muffs are immense. They
almost form cuffs for your coat, as
they extend halfway up your arms.
To match the new spool heels on
1 your shoes, your muff can be made
1 to look like a little barrel.
