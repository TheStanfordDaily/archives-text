# New Rough Weave Mixtures Appear In Coats, Suits
## 
### 
Accenting tweeds, women's fashions are also using some new fabrics
this season. The new tweed mixtures in colors and monotones seem to be
especially popular. Coats, suits, jackets, and skirts are almost entirely
tweedish, either in herringbones or in the new mixtures.
Flannels and mannish worsteds are also being used extensively in suits.

In sport coats, tweed mixtures in one+
tone as well as those in various J
colors predominate. Cashmir and |
Shetland wools are the leaders in i
the sweater field, while in the more j
dressy coats, nubby tweeds are being j
featured.
SKI OUTFITS LIGHTER
Jersey, plaid, and basketweave are
the favorites in wool dresses. New
novelty weaves characterize the silk j
dresses. The new synthetic, Acetate
Maletasse, introduced this year at
Paris, is already a leading favorite
in afternoon wear. Alpaca Acetate !
is again being widely used.
Ski and winter sports clothes are !
much lighter in material than ever !
before. Gaberdines and outfits in the
new Grenfeld Cloth are being .shown
extensively for the coming snow sea
son. Lighter fabrics are bejng ac
cented because they don't collect '
snow as readily, and are, therefore,
drier.
MEN BUY CAMEL'S HAIR
Herringbone tweeds, twill, shark
, skin, and unfinished worsteds, are |
widely used in men's suits this year. ,
Camels hair sport coats are steadily
growing in popularity and are in
greater demand than they were last
' season. Sport coats in tweeds are :
I also in great demand. Moleskin and
corduroy jackets are heavy sellers.
I Denim, and linen and cotton crash
j sport shirts are popular with Campus
men. Covert Twill, a new material,
!is very popular in trousers, and
| gaberdines, bedford cords, and mole
-1 skins, last year's favorites, are still
| moving rapidly.
