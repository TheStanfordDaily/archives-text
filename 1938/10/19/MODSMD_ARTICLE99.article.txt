# Flowers to Adorn The Clinging Vine
## 
### 
This is a good season for flowers
because the clinging-vine type is in
again.
For evening little flowers in the
hair are always good, but this year
they should be tucked into side
combs, or at your ears. A dog-col
lar of flowers with a matching
wristband is especially fetching,
with the new low necklines.
During the day, large flowers,
such as lilies, are being pinned on
muffs. Smaller flowers are made
into square corsages to be worn on
an ascot tied at the neck of your
reefer.
