# Spencer Wins Boathouse Prize
## Single-Story Structure Planned; Old Building May Become Bonfire 
### 
From a large list of contestants, the Boathouse plan submitted by Dick
Spencer, S.A.E., was chosen as the most outstanding by the Boatliouse
Committee. To Spencer, for winning the contest, go two free bids to the
Alumni Association's Big Game Dance at the Palace Hotel.
Spencer's winning plans were submitted to Ernest Weihe, architect in

charge of the Boathouse plans, yes-4
terday afternoon. In all probability,
Ihey will be accepted finally by the
architectural firm, and Stanford's
new Boathouse will be student de
signed as well as student built.
TWO WINGS ON BUILDING
As pictured by Spencer, the new
Boathouse will be single-story and
will consist of two long wings
stretching out from a pentagonal
center section. General shape of the
complete structure will be that of a
wide-angle open triangle.
On the lower floor will be housed
more than 50 canoes, docked so that
they can be carried straight ahead
into the water through large sliding
doors. In the center section, on the
ground floor will be an attendant's
office and two student rooms. Above
will be a glass-enclosed lounge, with
dressing rooms for men and women.
ROOF FOR SUN-BATHING
Roof of the wings will be used for
sun-bathing and will be equipped
with deck-chairs. Construction will
be made on concrete pilings, with
the building finished in wood and
glass throughout.
Floats will stretch along the entire
front, and a separate diving plat
form will be erected a short distance
from the outer edge of the Boat
house.
HONORABLE MENTIONS
Lamenting the fact that, from the
large number of sketches and plans
submitted, only one was eligible
for a prize, the Boathouse Commit
tee awarded honorable mention to
the following: Hal Wetherby, Andy
Wetherby, Andy Hoff, George Faris,
Herbert Atkinson, Al McMicking,
Paul Huston, Jack Dixon, and Phil
Brooks.
Plans submitted varied from the
modern structure conceived by
Spencer to an arcaded type of build
ing suggesting Quad architecture.
Most striking plan was one which,
according to members of the com
mittee, "looked like something off
the front of Popular Science."
PLANS READY SOON
According to Weihe, detailed plans
will be ready within a few days, and
actual construction will start with
in ten. First move will be the
wrecking of the old boathouse. The
suggestion was made that material
which could neither be used again
nor sold for salvage could be turned
over to the frosh to add to the Big
Game Bonfire.
In the meantime, the Committee
will meet, daily to plan ways and
means of financing the new Boat
house completely. A meeting will be
called shortly to enlist the aid of all
student organizations.
