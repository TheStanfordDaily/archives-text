# Cardinals Plan Bonfire Rally
## Union Band Tie-up Discussed by Group 
### 
In spite of the rumors which have j
been going around, there will be a J
Big Game rally on the Lagunita lake '
bed this year—if it is built in one
day, Clint Olsen announced in Car- |
dinals' meeting last night.
"Dean Yost was against having a
bonfire there this year because of
the hysteria it causes in Roble hav
ing it so close," Olsen said. "But I
talked with her, Dean Bunn, and
Mrs. Diekema, and they said we
could have it if we built it in one j
day."
It is in the A.S.S.U. constitution
that the bonfire has to be built in one
day anyway, Olsen said. Purpose of
that is to keep Cars-coming-to
burn-it-down hysteria of the night
before from unduly upsetting the
Roble women, he said.
COOK ELECTED
Also in their meeting last night Ed
Cook, Sigma Nu sophomore, was
elected to Rally Committee to fill a
vacancy left when Pat Hubbard
failed to come back to school this
quarter.
Discussion was held as to whether
Cardinals should join with U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. in signing an agree
ment stating that only union bands
could be brought to the Farm for
all-school dances.
BIG NAMES POSSIBLE
Chief thing in favor of the plan
is that two "big name" bands could
be brought to Stanford each year
for jolly-ups instead of one, as is
now the case.
Strongest objection was that it
would force most of the local bands
out of business, and that union bands
as a whole might be somewhat more
expensive. The suggestion was
shelved for future investigation.
Seriously considered was a dance
to be held on the campus the night
of the Big Game. Favored by the
administration and many Farm stu
dents, according to the report given
Cardinals, the dance would have to
be "the best dance given thus quar
ter to draw a crowd," Cardinals be
lieves.
DECISION POSTPONED
Final decision on this dance will
be postponed, it. was decided. Also
discussed were the Big Game jolly
up and rally, a U.C.L.A. jolly-up 01*
rally, and a possible campus dance
the Saturday night of the U.C.L.A.
game. Because the Soph Cotillion is
to be Friday, Nov. 4, Cardinals de
cided against holding a dance after
the Washington game on the sth.
It was announced that, according
to the constitution, Cardinals must
sponsor a Red Cross drive this yuar
tcr. The campaign was slated ten
tatively for Nov. 7-10, subject to the
approval of Ex Committee.

up and rally, a U.C.L.A. jolly-up 01*
rally, and a possible campus dance
the Saturday night of the U.C.L.A.
game. Because the Soph Cotillion is
to be Friday, Nov. 4, Cardinals de
cided against holding a dance after
the Washington game on the sth.
It was announced that, according
to the constitution, Cardinals must
sponsor a Red Cross drive this yuar
tcr. The campaign was slated ten
tatively for Nov. 7-10, subject to the
approval of Ex Committee.
In spite of the rumors which have j
been going around, there will be a J
Big Game rally on the Lagunita lake '
bed this year—if it is built in one
day, Clint Olsen announced in Car- |
dinals' meeting last night.
"Dean Yost was against having a
bonfire there this year because of
the hysteria it causes in Roble hav
ing it so close," Olsen said. "But I
talked with her, Dean Bunn, and
Mrs. Diekema, and they said we
could have it if we built it in one j
day."
It is in the A.S.S.U. constitution
that the bonfire has to be built in one
day anyway, Olsen said. Purpose of
that is to keep Cars-coming-to
burn-it-down hysteria of the night
before from unduly upsetting the
Roble women, he said.
COOK ELECTED
Also in their meeting last night Ed
Cook, Sigma Nu sophomore, was
elected to Rally Committee to fill a
vacancy left when Pat Hubbard
failed to come back to school this
quarter.
Discussion was held as to whether
Cardinals should join with U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. in signing an agree
ment stating that only union bands
could be brought to the Farm for
all-school dances.
BIG NAMES POSSIBLE
Chief thing in favor of the plan
is that two "big name" bands could
be brought to Stanford each year
for jolly-ups instead of one, as is
now the case.
Strongest objection was that it
would force most of the local bands
out of business, and that union bands
as a whole might be somewhat more
expensive. The suggestion was
shelved for future investigation.
Seriously considered was a dance
to be held on the campus the night
of the Big Game. Favored by the
administration and many Farm stu
dents, according to the report given
Cardinals, the dance would have to
be "the best dance given thus quar
ter to draw a crowd," Cardinals be
lieves.
DECISION POSTPONED
Final decision on this dance will
be postponed, it. was decided. Also
