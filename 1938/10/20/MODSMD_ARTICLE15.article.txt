# S.C. Horse Song At Rally Tonight
## 
### 
Words for the Trojan Horse
song to be sung at the rally
tonight are as follows:
In the days of long ago a mighty
Trojan host
Thought that they were the
warriors supreme,
Then a little wooden horse up
set their mighty boast
And their glory was only a
dream,
Now the Trojans have a name
sake down at Southern Cal,
And they're boastful as boast
ful can be.
But they're goin' to meet their
master for the Cardinal
Will plav horse with the old
U.S.C.
