# 'Pound Act' Branded Obstacle To Research
## 
### JACK BURTT 
Apparently Mind to the weight of popular sentiment against them in
the past, or perhaps hoping they could circumvent this .sentiment through
maudlin propaganda and veiled rewording of their propositions, the anti
vivisectionists are once again asking the voters of California to curtail
all medical research in the entire state through the medium of an act
prohibiting laboratories from obtaining animals for experimental purposes.
Veiled as a "Humane Pound Act," and appearing on the November
ballot as Initiative Measure No. 2, the amendment purportedly seeks to

►regulate pounds, but actually will
make it nearly impossible for re
search institutions to carry on animal
experimentation.
It is hard to see the anti-vivisec
tionLst logic behind this latest at
tempt to impede medical progress.
The only answer lies in the fact that
persons supporting an anti-vivisec
tion doctrine attempt to think solely
through an emotional process, spar
ing their brains any and all labor.
DISREGARD EVIDENCE
They blindly disregard the vast
evidence of past medical triumph
| against them. Directly through ani
mal experimentation, science has
achieved complete or partial control
over an almost unlimited number of
diseases, including such plagues as
pneumonia, syphilis, gonorrhoea, tu
berculosis, diabetes, diphtheria, iet
anus, infantile paralysis, and mala
ria. A comparatively small number
I of animals was sacrificed that human
j beings might live.
And control of human disease is
not the whole' story. These same
animals, "uselessly sacrificed" in the
eyes of the anti-vivisectionist, have
been instrumental in saving the lives
of both house pets and livestock,
controlling diseases which formerly
swept through entire herds of hogs,
sheep, cattle and horses.
In the face of such positive results,
j it would require extremely dishon
| est thinking, 01* utter blindness, to
| brand medical experimentation upon
j animals as "useless."
HAMPERS MEDICINE
Still, the anti-vivisectionist at
! tempts to hamper medicine, and
j the results of his latest drive are to
j be found in the Pound Act. Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur, in his ca
j pacity as president of the California
I Society for the Promotion of Medi
cal Research, has committed him
self as definitely opposed to the act.
Under his sanction, a campus com
mittee, with Dr. Charles 11. Dan-
I forth, professor of anatomy, as chair
j man, is attempting to organize stu
j dent voters to oppose the measure,
Other universities in the state, in
| all of which laboratory research
j upon animals has time and again
; proved its essential worth, .are spon
j soring similar committees to influ-
I ence student voters and to encour
age students to acquaint their par
ents and friends with the nature ol
the Pound Act.
Passage of the proposed amend
ment will hamper college experi
mental laboratories .seriously—anc
these laboratories have long been ii
the front line of the constant fighl
against disease.

And control of human disease is

HAMPERS MEDICINE
Still, the anti-vivisectionist at
! tempts to hamper medicine, and
j the results of his latest drive are to
j be found in the Pound Act. Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur, in his ca
j pacity as president of the California
I Society for the Promotion of Medi
cal Research, has committed him
self as definitely opposed to the act.
Under his sanction, a campus com
mittee, with Dr. Charles 11. Dan-
I forth, professor of anatomy, as chair
j man, is attempting to organize stu
j dent voters to oppose the measure,
Other universities in the state, in
| all of which laboratory research
j upon animals has time and again
; proved its essential worth, .are spon
j soring similar committees to influ-
I ence student voters and to encour
age students to acquaint their par
ents and friends with the nature ol
the Pound Act.
Passage of the proposed amend
ment will hamper college experi
mental laboratories .seriously—anc
these laboratories have long been ii
the front line of the constant fighl
against disease.
(This is the third in a series of
J articles 011 the State Pound Act.
j The next will appear within the
| next two days.)
Apparently Mind to the weight of popular sentiment against them in
the past, or perhaps hoping they could circumvent this .sentiment through
maudlin propaganda and veiled rewording of their propositions, the anti
vivisectionists are once again asking the voters of California to curtail
all medical research in the entire state through the medium of an act
prohibiting laboratories from obtaining animals for experimental purposes.
Veiled as a "Humane Pound Act," and appearing on the November
ballot as Initiative Measure No. 2, the amendment purportedly seeks to

►regulate pounds, but actually will
make it nearly impossible for re
search institutions to carry on animal
experimentation.
It is hard to see the anti-vivisec
tionLst logic behind this latest at
tempt to impede medical progress.
The only answer lies in the fact that
persons supporting an anti-vivisec
tion doctrine attempt to think solely
through an emotional process, spar
ing their brains any and all labor.
DISREGARD EVIDENCE
They blindly disregard the vast
evidence of past medical triumph
| against them. Directly through ani
mal experimentation, science has
achieved complete or partial control
over an almost unlimited number of
diseases, including such plagues as
pneumonia, syphilis, gonorrhoea, tu
berculosis, diabetes, diphtheria, iet
anus, infantile paralysis, and mala
ria. A comparatively small number
I of animals was sacrificed that human
j beings might live.
