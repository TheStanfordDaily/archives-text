# Marx Bros. Movie Lacks Time-Honored Shenanigans
## 
### 
"ROOM SERVICE," with the Marx
Brothers and a lot of other people,
coming to the Stanford Theater
today.
Believe it or not, the Marx Bros,
in a picture of their own were domi
nated by a plot and, at times, played
off the screen by Broadway actors
taken from the original "Room
Service" to help out in the movie
version of it.
Believe it or not, the Marx Bros,
made a picture without Margaret
Dumont.
Believe it or not, the Marx Bros,
made a picture without including a
single song and dance number. A
picture where they take all of
Harpo's gadgets away from him. A
picture with no harp and piano
playing.
It nearly broke my heart.

For several years I have made al
most a fetish of the Marx Bros.
When I heard they were going to
make a picture of "Room Service," 1
had my misgivings. And when I
did see the picture, I was badly dis
appointed. I saw it at a "sneak"
preview; Chico Marx was there, in
a Hollywood beret, and he looked
ashamed of himself.
"Room Service" was a good play
as a play, but, even so, it. wasn't
first-rate. When the Marx Bros,
picked it 1 up, they made practically
no plot changes. A second-x*ate line
still isn't a first-rate line—even when
it is shot out sideways by Groucho.
PLAY AT FAULT
And it wasn't poor acting on the
part of the Marx Bros, that subordi
nated them at times to the play
writing bumpkin with the iodine
freckles or the blaspheming hotel
inspector or the harassed manager.
It was just that at times the play
gave these people the key lines and
left the Marx Bros, absolutely noth
ing to do in those spots.
SINGLE SET
Like the play, practically the
whole picture takes place in a hotel
room. It wasn't until the last ten
minutes or so of the picture when
they get out of that hotel room that
the film was Marx Bros, stuff. But
those last ten minutes are terrific.
Most people will like the show, I
think, so I mark it thumbs up.
Compared with most pictures which
come out, it deserves a thumbs-up
marking.
But for the Marx Bros, it was
miserable. —Jacques

first-rate. When the Marx Bros,
picked it 1 up, they made practically
no plot changes. A second-x*ate line
still isn't a first-rate line—even when
it is shot out sideways by Groucho.
PLAY AT FAULT
And it wasn't poor acting on the
part of the Marx Bros, that subordi
nated them at times to the play
writing bumpkin with the iodine
freckles or the blaspheming hotel
inspector or the harassed manager.
It was just that at times the play
gave these people the key lines and
left the Marx Bros, absolutely noth
ing to do in those spots.
SINGLE SET
Like the play, practically the
whole picture takes place in a hotel
room. It wasn't until the last ten
minutes or so of the picture when
they get out of that hotel room that
the film was Marx Bros, stuff. But
those last ten minutes are terrific.
Most people will like the show, I
think, so I mark it thumbs up.
Compared with most pictures which
come out, it deserves a thumbs-up
marking.
But for the Marx Bros, it was
miserable. —Jacques
"ROOM SERVICE," with the Marx
Brothers and a lot of other people,
coming to the Stanford Theater
today.
Believe it or not, the Marx Bros,
in a picture of their own were domi
nated by a plot and, at times, played
off the screen by Broadway actors
taken from the original "Room
Service" to help out in the movie
version of it.
Believe it or not, the Marx Bros,
made a picture without Margaret
Dumont.
Believe it or not, the Marx Bros,
made a picture without including a
single song and dance number. A
picture where they take all of
Harpo's gadgets away from him. A
picture with no harp and piano
playing.
It nearly broke my heart.

For several years I have made al
most a fetish of the Marx Bros.
When I heard they were going to
make a picture of "Room Service," 1
had my misgivings. And when I
did see the picture, I was badly dis
appointed. I saw it at a "sneak"
preview; Chico Marx was there, in
a Hollywood beret, and he looked
ashamed of himself.
"Room Service" was a good play
as a play, but, even so, it. wasn't
first-rate. When the Marx Bros,
picked it 1 up, they made practically
no plot changes. A second-x*ate line
still isn't a first-rate line—even when
it is shot out sideways by Groucho.
