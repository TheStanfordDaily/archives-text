# Luncheon Club Hears Dr. Rogers
## 
### 
The changing conception of wom
an's role in society was the point
stressed by Dr. Kay Rogers in her
talk on "These Modern Women" at
yesterday's meeting of the Luncheon
Club.
Dr. Rogers explained that in Eu
ropean fascist countries there is a
distinct retrogressive movement in
the relation of women to society. The
rights gained in the last century are
gradually being annulled.
"In the United States," she com
mented, "there is a tendency toward
a wish to retain feminine attitudes
without lowering the status of wom
en in economic situations. The fem
inist did a great deal in the last
century for women in enlarging the
spheres of her activity in spite of
prejudice, but this position is defi
nitely going out.
"Because of the increased free
dom which she has received, there
has been a change in women's con
ception of their role in society."
Dr. Rogers went on to enumerate
the privileges women have gained
and to explain their fear of loss of
security.
