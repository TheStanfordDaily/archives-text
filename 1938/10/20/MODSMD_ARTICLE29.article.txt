HONG KONG. Thursday, Oct. 20
(UP). —Japanese armies today were
smashing into the inner defenses of j
Canton and ruomrs were increasing
a powerful group of South China
leaders favors making an early sepa
rate peace with the invaders.
The Japanese, following their cap- j
ture of Sheklung and Tsenghsing, j
were driving westward along the
motor highway to Canton and re- j
ported they were "making fast
progress."
Chinese resistance in the South !
appeared to be crumbling rapidly j
and some observers believed the i
Japanese might be in the great South
China metropolis within a fortnight '
or less. If Canton does fall, it was \
agreed, Chinese Nationalist Gener- j
alissimo Chiang Kai-shek will have j
suffered the greatest blow of the war ;
to date.
Rumors South China leaders might j
make a separate peace with Japan
were given a degree of credence by
a statement issued last night by Eu
gene Chen, many times foreign min- I
ister in Chinese national revolution- !
ary governments.
Chen, bitter at what he considered
the failure of Generalissimo Chiang
and his associates in Hankow and
Chunking to send aid to Canton, sent
a strong message to Sun Fo, Chou
Lou, and other Cantonese in the
National regime at Hankow.
The Japanese claimed Chang Fa
kwei had lost the bulk of his best
fighting men and most of his muni
tions and they were nearing Nan
j chang and the railway south of
i Hankow.
