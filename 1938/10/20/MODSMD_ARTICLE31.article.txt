# Feud Brews On Physics, Psych Corner
## 
### 
There's a feud "a-brewin" down |
on the northeast corner, the one !
housing the physics and psychology !
departments, of the Quad, and it all !
started because of a little coffee j
brewing.
It seems that the budding psy- I
chologists and the budding physi
cists that occupy the comer together !
have always engaged in a bit of j
friendly rivalry. When all the little
physicists settle down to unraveling \
the mysteries of light, matter, and ,
so on, the psych students haul out j
their trusty ping-pong paddles and
have a little game in the upstairs
hall. The resulting clicking rivals
the thundering of the nine-pins
played by Rip Van Winkle's littk
chums in the New York Catskills.
annoying the physics students no
end.
So, when everything is quiet and
the psych students get absorbed in
what makes odd people odd, they
are suddenly confounded by on
switchings and off-switchings of
lights which are no end confusing,
since the whole thing is .eerie not
to say ghostly.
And so it went, until a certain
Miss Voorhees, secretary of the phys
ics department, began to make cof
fee every day at 4 o'clock for the
physics lads. The odor wafts its way
upstairs, and, since there aren't cof
fee making facilities in the psych
rooms, psych majors drift down and
I stroll back and forth, snifting the
heavenly aroma, while the physicists
j gloatingly sip their coffee.
i The physics department is one up
: in the feud now, but as one psych
j student said, "They can tempt us
| just so far, and thenâ€”!"
