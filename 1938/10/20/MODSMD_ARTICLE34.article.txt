# Card-Trojan Victor May Play in Bowl
## Indians Headed For Pasadena—If U.S.C., Cal Lose Saturday 
### 
Maybe no one has stopped to figure
it out yet, but the Stanford-South- i
ern California game this Saturday ,
might decide the conference entrant !
in the Rose Bowl this year.
It's a rather far-l'etched supposi- i
tion but neither the Trojan nor In- j
dian teams have been beaten thus j
far in league play. Southern Cali- j
forma opened the year by dropping '
one to Alabama with a performance i
almost as bad as that which Tiny !
Thornhiil's crew put on in the Santa '
Clara fiasco.
YV.S.C. DOUBLE LOSEIt
But both squads have bowled over j
two good teams since that time, with i
Washington State being a double j

rooters' ticket.

loser. The Trojans have also knock- 1
ed over Oregon State.
If Stanford should win Saturday— !
although 2-to-l odds say they can't ;
do it—the Indians will have com- j
pleted one of the two toughest ob- '
stacles in their path to the Bowl.
The other is a slight date with Cali
fornia's Golden Bear late in Novem- !
ber.
CAL FAVORITE
California, incidentally, is an odds- |
on favorite to beat Washington in
Seattle this week, but many experts I
are inclined to believe that Jimmy i
Phelan has kept some of his better j
backs out since the Minnesota '
game just so they would be ready |
for the Bears. A Washington win j
would put either Stanford or South- j
ern California into the conference !
leadership by 5 o'clock Saturday ;
evening.
Southern Cal's performance !
against Alabama would probably be
much different if it were played this i
late in the season.
Howard Jones has two excellent
teams, both so good that he spends
sleepless night after night trying to
decide which one to use. His so
called second-string usually scores i
the points, but they probably mop !
up after the first team has cracked j
the opposition wide open.
JONES BOASTS RESERVES
Los Angeles writers are certain in
the belief that Jones has more good
men for every spot this season.than I
he has had since his great Power
Teams murdered everything on the
Coast. Even with the loss of Ambie
Schindler, he still has Bill Sangster
and Micky Anderson, "Old Man" '
Ollie Day, Bobby Peoples, Emperor
Jones, and a flock more to throw to I
the Indians.
In our own back yard. Tiny ;
Thornhill has been keeping his
aching men away from heavy scrim
mages, preferring to work on new |
plays and defenses. The first-string j
backfield of Norm Standlee. Freddie
Ledeboer, Gene Coldiron, and !
Hugh Gallarneau seem to be work- j
ing well together when there's no
opposition in the way. Rod Parker,
a tough 180-pound junior quarter
back, has moved into the second
string spot behind Coldiron. Parker
is a fancy stepping runner and a
hell-cat on defense who might do
well against the big men of Troy.
