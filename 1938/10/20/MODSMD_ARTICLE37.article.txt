freshman and varsity
water polo games tomorrow af
ternoon in the Encina Pools.' stu
dents will have their first chance to
see in action the finest pair of divers
ever to appear at Stanford at the
same time.
Roy Winkelmann, senior spring
board sensation who has attracted
the awe of aquatic fans for three

years, will pair
with Howard Ad
ams, diminutive
freshman star.
Adams hails from
Richmond, and
has been diving
only sjnee he
graduated from
high school there

a year and a half ago. During the
past year, which he spent out of
school, he has represented the Fair
mont swimming and diving team in
San Francisco.
Last year he took third in the jun
ior nationals, and recently claimed
first honors in the Far Western
A.A.U. competition.
Only 5 feet 4 inches in height,
Adams steps on the board, moves the
fulcrum as far back as it will go to
get the maximum spring from his
miniature frame, and executes the
hardest dives with ease and preci
sion. Though smaller than his usual
opponents, Adams' well-propor
tioned body makes an exceptionally
good appearance on the spring
board.
Freshman swimmers will meet
Sequoia High School, and the var-

sity will open
their conference
competition
against the Bru
ins tomorrow.
Both games will
be thrillers, and
** addition of a per
formance by two

of the finest divers in the country
wilt complete a program that will
attract a great many aquatic.fans.
