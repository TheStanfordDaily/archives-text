# Soph Dance Changed To Semi-formal
## 
### 
"The Sophomore Cotillion will be;
semi-formal."
This was the way committeemen
of the class of '41 last night compro
mised between two strong schools of
"informal" and "formal" thought, de
cided to restrict women to formals,
men to dark suits on the night of
Nov. 4.
Gathering in the Women's Club
house at 8 o'clock last night under
the chairmanship of Bob Anderson,
committee heads reported on ar
rangements for the "Slum-with-the-
Sophs" theme.
CONTRACTS SIGNED
Orchestra Chairman Grayson Bry
an reported that contracts had been
signed with "Name Band"' Eddie
Fitzpatrick, stipulating that "there
will be no more than two-minute in
tervals between selection groups and
no more than two ten-minute inter
missions during the four-hour dance
period."
Refreshments and Hat-Check Com
mittee Chairman Sid Miller was
choked with ideas. Plans completed
include:
Two instead of tile conventional
one-flavor punch will be served from
"pubs" in keeping with the 'Let's
go.slumming" motif; drinks featured
will be "The Daily Dynamite" and
the "Dean's Double Trouble."
COMMITTEE DISSOLVED
Clean-up Chairman A1 Louchard
delegated his duties to Bob Ander
son who, in turn, named Maurice
Knox new head of that committee.
Ticket Chairman Ted Moreno had
his committee dissolved before his
eyes because the A.S.S.U. decided it
would rather direct sale of the $2.50
bids itself.
Ben Miller, decorations head, said
that he and his co-workers "are all
bound up with plans. It's all secret,
though," he added.
