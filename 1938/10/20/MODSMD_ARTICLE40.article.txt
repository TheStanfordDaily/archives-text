# Frosh Gridmen Brush Up Plays For Ucla Game
## Papooses Practice Hampered By Large Sick List 
### 
Pointing at the coming U.C.L.A.
! frosh football game of next Satur
i day. Coach Shipkcy's gridders yes
| terday began the final brushing up
i of plays, both defensive and offens
! ive, before the team heads south
| next Friday night. Yesterday's prac
j ties was comprised mostly of a short
j pass drill in which the first two
! strings fought it out in a rough-and
! tough game of touch football, the
I only legal play being a forward
j pass.
From this offensive part of prac-
I tice Coach Shipkey was clearly able
Ito see the passing strength which
| his Papooses ait 1 certain to need
i badly in the U.C.L.A. tilt.
PASS DEFENSE DRILL
A short defensive drill in which
i the third and first strings took place
j then rounded out the afternoon.
Again there was no rough body
contact but only light touch football,
which nevertheless pointed out the
many strong and weak points in the
Cardinal pass defense.
j The most probable reason for touch
football can be seen in the all too
heavy frosh sick list. Frankie Al
berts was noticably absent from
practice with a strained groin. Rad
ditz, star tackle, occupied a hospi
tal bed with a reported case of
probable slight concussion. Stur
geon, first-string right half, will not
start the U.C.L.A. game, but there
is still a possibility he may play if
needed.
ENDS INJURED
Both first-string ends, Meyer and
j Talcott, rested during the practice,
i due to slight leg injuries. The only
permanent injury for the season was
received by Don Grant, subbing for
Sturgeon, who followed the team
movements with a broken finger
bone.
