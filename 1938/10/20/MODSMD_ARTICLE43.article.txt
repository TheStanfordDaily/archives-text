## Frosh Mermen Give First Team Workout 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton continued to J
drill his crippled water polo squad j
yesterday in preparation for the j
conference opener here Friday night j
against the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Ted Moreno, sturdy sophomore !
guard, was the latest addition to the '
sick list.
A smooth functioning frosh outfit j
gave what there was of the varsity j

Vitousek, and Nottage, all of whom i
are out with colds.
Thornton was in hopes of having i
a full-strength squad by game time |
