# Blush, Stanford Red
## 
### 
THE DAILY is going into the business of sell
ing gold bricks to Stanford. It will make
enough money to retire on.
Because, on a campus as gullible as this one,
a campus which puts two and two together to
make a malicious rumor, and then write Cam
pus Opinions about it (see adjacent column),
the gold brick project will turn into a bonanza.
There is no attack within this editorial pri
marily pointed to Messrs. Minor, Adult, and
Company, authors of a prize missive of invec
tive and ignorance. It is directed to all who,
like those gentlemen, have observed certain
changes in campus sales of tobacco, and have
immediately concluded that the action was
the start of a new campaign. And the name of
the new Dean of Men was indignantly involved.
Stanford has been sold down the river by
suspicion and ill-will.
The recent changes of which Campus Opin
ioner speaks of—the removal of cigarette ad
vertisements from the Union and Encina coun
ters, and the conspicuous display of the state
law concerning sale of tobacco—spring from
sources which are so far removed from those
which rumor has hit upon that Stanford, rather
than the administration or John Bunn or The
Daily, "is ludicrous."
The facts are these:
For long years, cigarette companies have
been bickering about display space allotted to
them in Stanford stores. At the same time, cer
tain companies have broken Stanford laws
concerning solicitation on the campus under
the freedom allowed them by advertising.
The camel's back finally broke a week ago.
ALL large cigarette displays were removed
purely as a business matter, and FOR NO
OTHER REASON.
Concerning the posting of the state law:
1. Two weeks ago, while discussion was
running high on the question of liquor sales,
within one afternoon three high school boys,
obviously under age, appeared in the Union
Cellar followed by a lurking stranger, and at
tempted to purchase cigarettes. They were
immediately removed and no cigarettes sold
to them.
2. Monday of this week, three members of
the County Board of Equalization conferred with
members of the administration concerning sale
of tobacco, evidently with the intention of put
ting Stanford on the spot.
Dean J. Hugh Jackson immediately contacted
the legal counsel for the Board of Trustees, who
advised, as a protective measure against an
tagonistic forces, that the state law be posted,
and that extra precautions be taken to avoid any
sort of legal involvement.
This instruction was immediately given to
John Gunther, head of the Union Cellar, and
to all clerks in other campus stores.
These are the facts.
But still the asinine rumors appeared—even
in print. Of course no check was made to ob
tain those facts before the rumors were circu
lated. Truth and malice never do mix.
But, though they have already started, they
should not continue.
There is no campaign; action did not spring
from the office of the Dean of Men; action was
taken purely to protect Stanford from obviously
unsympathetic forces.
That is all.
But the fact that these rumors started, abso
lutely unchecked until today, puts Stanford
down as the prize sucker of all Barnum's lot.
• Good gold-brick fodder.
