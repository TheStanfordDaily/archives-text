# Axe the Trojan
## 
### 
NEXT to the Big Game Rally, the S.C. Paja
marino hot-time-in-the-old-town-tonight is
Stanford's biggest hot-diggity pep-fest.
And it's the one that is the most Stanford of
all rallies.
For one night, the Farm is extended into Palo
Alto when the Varsity Theater opens its doors
exclusively to pajama-clad freshmen. Out of
yood will and a friendly spirit toward Stanford,

the managers give free rein to the football spirit
by their contribution.
But as the Varsity Theater becomes part of
Stanford for two hours, so do the Stanford
rules extend over its temporary acquisition.
And it is up to those accepting the theater's
hospitality to see that Stanford's rules of con
duct are followed. No outside authorities will
crack the whip; when the theater isturned over
to Stanford, it is turned over unconditionally—
because Palo Alto too accepts the Farm's prize
theory—the responsibility of the individual.
When, tonight, Stanford rises en masse with
a throaty howl to scalp the Trojan, Palo Alto
joins that enthusiasm. When, tonight, costumed
Frosh troop down to a free show, they carry
with them the Stanford spirit in their yells and
in their actions.
That spirit must not be tampered with.
Remembering that one fact,
Take it away, Frosh.
