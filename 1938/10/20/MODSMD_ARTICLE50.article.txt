### JOHN COBBS 
NOTICE: REVOLUTION POSTPONED
COMMITTEE got a surprise last Tuesday when
its subcommittee on Sunday night movies pro
duced an idea. The early Greeks must have felt much
the same way when Jason returned with the golden
fleece after his family had written him olf as a wind
fall loss.
Sunday night movies on the campus were assassi
nated suddenly last spring when Hollywood decided
that they were providing too much competition for the
local entertainment palaces. Since then they have been
one of those regretted but unavenged tragedies of his
tory, like the partition of Poland and the extermina
tion of the American Indian. When the sub-committee
was appointed to reconnoiter the situation, everyone
expected it to fold up quietly and vanish.
* * â™¦ *
But last night the sub-committee produced an idea
which may solve the problem. It is suggested that we
abandon the hope of showing current films, and sched
ule instead a program of foreign and classical movies.
This, it says, can be arranged without incurring the
wrath of the jealous gods of Hollywood.
If this is to be the final solution of our feud with
the movie producers, we can hardly consider it a
sweeping victory. In fact, it rather looks as though we
were running up the white flag and asking the enemy
to state his terms. There is no reason why Stanford
should not have any movies it wants. And in any
properly managed Utopia we would be able to pick
our program. But Stanford, the Frosh Bible to the
contrary, is not a Utopia.

'T'HE new plan won't do anything about the extor
tionist tactics now popular among our local the
aters. If we want to see a current picture, it will be
rather trying on the patience to wait until it becomes
"classical," or until it is translated into the Scandi
navian. And so our shadow temples will continue to
charge 40 cents for second features which are a
crime against civilization.
And Stanford men will continue to pack into their
rococo lobbies, gaze at their hideous decorations, and
wonder what the penalty is for inciting a riot.
* * * *
But the new proposal has a clear lead on all other
suggestions, most of which pivot on some form of
mob violence and arson. The main point is that it
will bring Sunday night movies back to Stanford. And
it will bring good movies.
Another encouraging feature is that the whole
quarter's program can be arranged at one time, so
that we can make our plans ahead, subject of course
to change without notice by God and midquarters.
* * * *
The new plan won't give us any occasion for a
triumphal march around the Quad. But it is the best
scheme that has been turned up. And the sub-com
mittee deserves a bouquet for knowing how to track
a good idea to its lair.
It's all very encouraging, and so if anyone wants
to buy a good copy of Karl Marx, mine is now for
sale.
