### DOUG JAQUES 
of the boys were sitting around the shaek
here the other night trying to write a head. They
had it all written except, for one word, and they were
looking for a short word to fit in that remaining space.
They thought for quite a while, and then one guy,
probably a frosh, said, "If we only knew what the
word was, we could look up a synonym for it."
Another of the boys was smoking a cigar which he
said he got at his fraternity that night. One of the
boys had just been married. Two of them were mar
ried now, 4ie said.
In open-mouthed amazement, one of the women on
desk asked, "Do those fellows live right in the house
with their wives?"

"Who wears those purple pajamas," I heard a
sorority woman ask a man who lives in the fraternity
next door.
"My room-mate," answered the man.
I'm not in Ihe course so I wasn't. there when Dr.
Thompson said this the other day, but it seems a little
sad and rather plaintive: "Last year I taught a course.
I didn't know much about it, though."
Dr. Thompson has a home-made syllogism, I hear,
which I would call out and out wish-fulfillment if I
thought I could get away with it.
It goes:
All Swedes are beautiful.
Thompson is a Swede.
Therefore Thompson is beautiful.

J WAS reading in that book on Spain again the other
day. I think the guy who wrote it must be a Spaniard
His English phrasing is not so hot. In one place he was
telling about a rich Arab who had a lot. of Spanish
enemies, whom he invited to a sort of banquet. He
had them come in one at a time and walk beside a
thing which was, in short, a hole in the ground.
"Executioners posted all along the spot," he writes,
"decapitated them and threw their bodies into this
clay-mortar."
A great many died in this way."
I'll bet the ones who didn't were pretty sick.

One of the frosh lady-killers has taken six or
' seven of the Roble gals out so far this year, and the
other night all six (or seven) of these young women
got together to compare notes, as they say. They
found that he had given every one of them exactly the
same line.
I Excepting that he had showed the last one his
I mother's picture.
