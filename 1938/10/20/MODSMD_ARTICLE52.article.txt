# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Much as the campus was dis- '
tressed by the recent liquor up- !
heaval, we are forced to admit that
even that coup pales in the light of ;
certain ugly rumors which have I
been circulating during the past few i
days. It would seem that not only I
are Stanford students to be saved ;
from the menace of the demon rum, t
but also they are to be shielded from
the deleterious influence of To
bacco.
Frankly, we are loath to believe
that the university authorities will \
engage in an active campaign
against smoking, but the disappear
ance of cigarette displays from the
Union Cellar store is a straw in the
alleged winds of freedom whose di
rection is definitely disquieting.
Stanford is not at all out of line
with other univeristies when it. in
stitutes an anti-liquor campaign,
but to our knowledge no other col
lege has gone the length of attempt
ing to ban cigarette sales to students
of questionable age, or to attempt to
discourage smoking.
This part of the University's
clean-up campaign is not even dan
gerous. It is ludicrous. Such a cam
paign might be very funny in a comic
opera. In a university supposedly as
intelligent as Stanford it is revolting.
In view of these developments, we
would suggest that the Board of
Trustees resign in favor of the
W.C.T.U. and the new Cubberley
Education Building be rededicated
—to Susan B. Anthony.

The Editor, Sir:
Let's have another dance after the
football game Saturday night. It
meets a real need for on-campus
entertainment. With a little pub
licity it should draw even more than
the Oregon one.
The Friday jolly-up is a good
idea, but a Saturday night dance is
j better; besides, it pays its own way.
