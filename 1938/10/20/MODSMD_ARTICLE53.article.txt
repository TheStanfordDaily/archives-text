# MORE THUMBS UP

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Since I long ago discovered that
reviewers, campus and metropolitan,
often do not know whereof they |
speak, I do not govern my enter- (
tainment-going by the effusions in j
The Daily or any other newspaper.
But, in common with many, I wish j
to register my complaint about the j
literary and critical style of The
Daily's reviewers.
I do not hesitate to give unto
Slater the things that are Slater's,
which should include a certain
amount of admission that the girl \
can "sling the guff' but couldn't |
someone take her out somewhere'
and explain to her in words of one
syllable that "to criticize" is not
necessarily synonymous with the!
verb "to pan"?
It takes far more skill, incidental
ly, to convey the less violently felt |
reactions to movies and plays—and
Slater is nothing if not hard-working ;
and sincere. Then let her work, |

hard, at the job of giving truly liter
ary criticisms that will leave the
reader in no doubt about whether he
wishes to see the performance or not,
but do not leave him wishing her
style were not so labored and her
invective quite so vitriolic.
As for the others—well, The Daily
is definitely hard up for critical tal
ent, hence the onus must necessarily
fall upon that hard-bitten crew, the
copy desk, whose prerogative is still
to return a verdict, "It stinks."
Yours for more "Thumbs-up"
A. M. L.
