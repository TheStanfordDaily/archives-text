# British Army Stops Revolt In Jerusalem
## Troops Take Old City Walls; Arab Section Surrounded 
### 
JERUSALEM, Oct. 19 (UP). —
Nearly 27,000 residents tonight
cringed in their homes in Jerusa
lem's Old City where 2500 British
troops and police, having stormed
the 10th century walls, wiped out
the guerrilla resistance of Arab
rebels in the Moslem quarter's
crooked sti'eets.
The British forces, including killed
"Ladies from Hell" of the Black
Watch and crack Coldstream Guards,
smashed their way through the old
gates that stood in Christ's time and,
shortly after dawn, seized the Old
City from the Arab rebels.
HISTORY REPEATED
It was a repetition of Jerusalem's
history dating back thousands of
years as the troops, under command
of Major General R. H. O'Connor,
military governor, broke down rebel
bamcades at Damascus gate on the
east while Royal Air Force planes
swooped with machine guns trained
on the scattering Arabs.
The actual entry into the Old City
was accomolished wilh few casual
ties, because of the lightning-like at
tack on all sides.
Two British Constables and a
Coldstream Guardsman were wound
ed and eight Arabs and an Arab
woman were killed in the guerrilla
street fighting before the main
force of tne rebels fled to shelter in
the vicinity of the Mosques of Omar
and Aksa in the southeastern sec
tion.
BRITONS WOUNDED
A Royal Air Force corporal and
an aircraftsman were wounded when
fired upon along the Jericho road,
south of Jerusalem.
The fighting planes, a modern con
trast to the last siege of Jerusalem
750 years ago, when Saladin I en
tered the city and drove out the
Crusaders, flew over the squat,
crowded Old City tonight, drop
ping thousands of leaflets in the
three offiical languages — English,
Arabic and Hebrew.
INHABITANTS WARNED
The frightened inhabitants—Chris
tians, Armenians, Jews and Moslems
—were instructed to remain in their
homes during the "mopping up"
operations.
There was scant possibility that
the Arabs would be driven out of
the Old City because they have tak
en refuge in the mosque area.
British authorities, determined not
Ito desecrate the Moslem shrines,
| were reiutcant to shell or invade the
i area.

JERUSALEM, Oct. 19 (UP). —
Nearly 27,000 residents tonight
cringed in their homes in Jerusa
lem's Old City where 2500 British
troops and police, having stormed
the 10th century walls, wiped out
the guerrilla resistance of Arab
rebels in the Moslem quarter's
crooked sti'eets.
The British forces, including killed
"Ladies from Hell" of the Black
Watch and crack Coldstream Guards,
smashed their way through the old
gates that stood in Christ's time and,
shortly after dawn, seized the Old
City from the Arab rebels.
HISTORY REPEATED
It was a repetition of Jerusalem's
history dating back thousands of
years as the troops, under command
of Major General R. H. O'Connor,
military governor, broke down rebel
bamcades at Damascus gate on the
east while Royal Air Force planes
swooped with machine guns trained
on the scattering Arabs.
The actual entry into the Old City
was accomolished wilh few casual
ties, because of the lightning-like at
tack on all sides.
Two British Constables and a
Coldstream Guardsman were wound
ed and eight Arabs and an Arab
woman were killed in the guerrilla
street fighting before the main
force of tne rebels fled to shelter in
the vicinity of the Mosques of Omar
and Aksa in the southeastern sec
tion.
BRITONS WOUNDED
A Royal Air Force corporal and
an aircraftsman were wounded when
fired upon along the Jericho road,
south of Jerusalem.
The fighting planes, a modern con
trast to the last siege of Jerusalem
750 years ago, when Saladin I en
tered the city and drove out the
Crusaders, flew over the squat,
crowded Old City tonight, drop
ping thousands of leaflets in the
three offiical languages — English,
Arabic and Hebrew.
