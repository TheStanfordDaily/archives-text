played on a northern California
gridiron.

only ball carrier, and (he power play
the only ground gainer, for this year
everyone in the backfield but the

PEOPLES INJURED
Bob Peoples, star sophomore first
: string fullback, is the only other
I Trojan on the injured list. Peoples
I limps on a bad ankle and is a doubt

available for service. Granny Lans
dcll will start the game and will be
I followed into action by Sprinter
Mickey Anderson or Ollie Day.
