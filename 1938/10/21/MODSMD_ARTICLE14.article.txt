### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 20 (UP). â€”
The gross Treasury deficit is about
to hit one billion dollars today as
business begins to move faster with
the flow of relief and pump-priming
spending.
Because Treasury figures lag a
couple of days behind current ac
counts it is quite possible that the
deficit already has exceeded one
billion dollars for this fiscal year.
