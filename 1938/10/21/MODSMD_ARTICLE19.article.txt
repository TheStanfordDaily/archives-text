# Stagers' Thumb Pulls Out Plum
## 
### 
Stagers delved into the past last
night—into the past B.C. (before
Coward). And by cracky, with the
reading of Dumas' "The Tower of
Nesle," they pulled out a plum.
Taking into account the hollow
theatricality of the play itself, the
cast gave an artistic rendition of it
—bold and vivid, but not hammy.
Despite the archaic and windy talk
of the script, Stagers made two
hours and a half so lively that we
barely squeezed under the wire with
the review.
But in passing ,it should be noted
that Melba Rac Toombs sustained
beautifully the role of the cruel
and haughty Marguerite; Jack Daw
son read with assurance Dumas' typ
ical dashing soldier of fortune; John
Cline, not quite up to the stormy
passages, projected the intensity un
derlying the casual speeches.—F. S.
