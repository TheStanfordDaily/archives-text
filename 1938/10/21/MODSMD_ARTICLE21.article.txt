# Indians Fired To Upset Trojan Grid Threat
## S.C. To Present Unorthodox Club Here Tomorrow Thornhill Will Rely on Ledeboer To Lead Stanford's Offensive 
### ARCH JENKINS 
A red-hot Stanford Indian goes after his third straight conference
football win tomorrow against one of the most unorthodox grid squads
ever produced by the University of Southern California.
Coach Howard Jones comes back to the Farm tonight with a .squad
which has defeated Oregon State, Washington State, and Ohio State after

•playing dead while Alabama mas
sacred them in the season's opener.
The men of Troy have what is con
sidered without a doubt to be the
fastest dozen backs in the confer
ence, but, they are also possessed of
seven massive linemen who have
been able to do everything but move
out of their tracks fast enough to let
the fancy backs slither through. Ev
eryone who has watched the newest
Jones aggregation in practice and
in games has come out completely
baffled.

All students on the waiting list
for returned rooters' tickets to the.
Stanford - U.S.C. game are re
quested to get them at the Board
of Athletic Control today.
Students are warned that they
must show their student body
cards with their rooters' tickets at
the stadium.
End zone tickets at $1.50 and
side section seats at $2.75 will he
available at the B.A.C. until noon
tomorrow and at the gates to the
stadium.

Most of them say the Jonesmen
make up their plays as they go along.
As soon as McNeil, their starting
center, shoots back the ball, their
plays arc supposed to evolve accord
ing to the movements of the de
fense.
At least that's how hard Troy is to
analyze. Whether their ".split-second
strategy" is newspaper talk or the
real thing now becomes a problem
for the fast moving, but badly bat
tered Indian.
Upon Freddie Ledeboer's already
loaded shoulders will go most of
Stanford's hopes for victory over
the Mad Men of Troy. With Bill
Paulman still on crutches and Pelc
Fay in the hospital, Ledeboer doesn't
have to worry about what he should
do. He'll have to do everything.
"IRON MAN"
From a left half spot he'll be the
defensive safety man, he'll undoubt
edly do most of the kicking and
passing, and most important of all,
he has to call plays and act as Tiny
ThornhilFs chief ball-toting hope.
But Ledeboer has never played a
bad game and his signal calling and
play analyzing is the best. What
makes the Card situation question
able will be the ability of Norm
Standlee to come through at full
back after being on the shelf for
three weeks. Standlee can also kick
and pass, as can the portsided right
half, Hugh Gallarneau; yet they
haven't shown themselves to be in a
class with Ledeboer and Paulman.
Gene Coldiron earned a first string
berth for bis brilliant play against
Oregon and is slated to start at
quarterback and defensive fullback.
LINEMEN IN SPOTLIGHT
Stanford's linemen should charge
as well as U.S.C. after their fourth
quarter stand against Oregon. South
ern California is slower from end
to end although they have in John
Stonebreaker and A1 Krucger two
slashing ends who act as if they
might have been coached by our own
Jim Lawson.
Last night's odds gave the Trojans
a 2 U > to 1 edge with plenty of takers.
Stanford is being sold short because
the Indians have yet to play a com
pletely superior game and because
two of their outstanding offensive
threats are out of action.

for returned rooters' tickets to the.
Stanford - U.S.C. game are re
quested to get them at the Board
of Athletic Control today.
Students are warned that they
must show their student body
cards with their rooters' tickets at
the stadium.
End zone tickets at $1.50 and
side section seats at $2.75 will he
available at the B.A.C. until noon
tomorrow and at the gates to the
stadium.

Most of them say the Jonesmen
make up their plays as they go along.
As soon as McNeil, their starting
center, shoots back the ball, their
plays arc supposed to evolve accord
ing to the movements of the de
fense.
At least that's how hard Troy is to
analyze. Whether their ".split-second
strategy" is newspaper talk or the
real thing now becomes a problem
for the fast moving, but badly bat
tered Indian.
Upon Freddie Ledeboer's already
loaded shoulders will go most of
Stanford's hopes for victory over
the Mad Men of Troy. With Bill
Paulman still on crutches and Pelc
Fay in the hospital, Ledeboer doesn't
have to worry about what he should
do. He'll have to do everything.
"IRON MAN"
From a left half spot he'll be the
defensive safety man, he'll undoubt
edly do most of the kicking and
passing, and most important of all,
he has to call plays and act as Tiny
ThornhilFs chief ball-toting hope.
But Ledeboer has never played a
bad game and his signal calling and
play analyzing is the best. What
makes the Card situation question
able will be the ability of Norm
Standlee to come through at full
back after being on the shelf for
three weeks. Standlee can also kick
and pass, as can the portsided right
half, Hugh Gallarneau; yet they
haven't shown themselves to be in a
class with Ledeboer and Paulman.
Gene Coldiron earned a first string
berth for bis brilliant play against
Oregon and is slated to start at
quarterback and defensive fullback.
LINEMEN IN SPOTLIGHT
Stanford's linemen should charge
as well as U.S.C. after their fourth
quarter stand against Oregon. South
ern California is slower from end
to end although they have in John
Stonebreaker and A1 Krucger two
slashing ends who act as if they
might have been coached by our own
Jim Lawson.
Last night's odds gave the Trojans
a 2 U > to 1 edge with plenty of takers.
Stanford is being sold short because
the Indians have yet to play a com
pletely superior game and because
two of their outstanding offensive
threats are out of action.

A red-hot Stanford Indian goes after his third straight conference

ever produced by the University of Southern California.
