# 'Life' To Battle Humane Pound Act
## 
### JACK BURTT 
Specifically charging anti-vivisec
tionists with another attempt to halt
animal experimentation in Califor
nia through an "ambiguously called
Human Pound Act," the news
picture magazine Life for this week
is featuring an article showing the
struggle between the anti-vivisec
tionist and the medical research
laboratory, according to reports
from the San Francisco office of the
publication.
Prominent anti-vivisectionists axe
represented in the picture-editorial
by Irene Castle McLaughlin and
Marion Davies. The cause of med
ical progress is represented by Pres
ident Ray Lyman Wilbur of Stan
ford, Dr. Thomas Parran, surgeon
general of the United States, Dr.
Alexis Carrel, medical author, Clif
ford 13. Morehouse, editor of The
Living Church, and Archbishop
John J. Cantwell, of Los Angeles.
A feature of Life's editorial is pic
lures illustrating modern treatment
of infantile paralysis, a disease
which is now controlled largely
through data obtained by animal ex
perimentation.
OPPOSITION TO ACT
While Life took the more promi
nent lead in the national fight
against the Humane Pound Act
this week, it was announced by Dr.
Wilbur that more" than 150 national
organizations have gone on record
recently as opposed to the measure.
The Commonwealth Club, a group
of business and professional men
meeting in San Francisco, voted 65
to 5 against the measure as the re
sult of conclusions drawn from a
section study of it.
Continuing his part in the drive
against the proposal, Dr. Wilbur in
his capacity as president of the Cali
fornia Society for the Promotion of
Medical Research, issued a state
ment recently in which he charged
that "the so-called State Humane

Pound Act (No. 2 011 the November
ballot) is aimed at animal experi
mentation by those who have twice
failed to pass similar state-wide
legislation."
Speaking for the society, he con
tinued, "We are confident that if
the citizens of California understand
the menace to health and safety that
is in this bill they will overwhelm
ingly defeat it.
ACT NOT HARMLESS
"Some confusion has been caused
by efforts of the proponents of this
measure to show that it was prac
tically harmless; but such is not the
case. It will hold back the advance
of medicine and the relief of human
suffering."
Dr. Wilbur concluded his state
ment saying, "The Humane Pound
bill is a long step in the direction
of harming research. In the long
struggle to conquer disease and give
health to our children and ourselves
the laboratories need public support,
not opposition some of which is giv
en under the cloak of that sentiment
for dogs that all of us who love dogs
feel."
(This is the fourth in a series
of articles on the State Pound Act.
The next will appear within (he
next two issues.)
