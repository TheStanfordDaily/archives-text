## 
### 
Wes Farrell, pitcher for the New
York Yankees, conferred here Wed
nesday with Professor Chilton R.
Bush, head of the Division of Jour
nalism, as to registering as a Stan
ford student.
Farrell says he is getting "too old
for baseball" and has had an offer to
write a column for a New York
newspaper if he learns something of
journalism.
During the recent World Series,
Farrell was laid up in New York
with a broken elbow and was un
able to play. In the spring he plans
to work out with either the Seals or
the Stanford baseball team.
