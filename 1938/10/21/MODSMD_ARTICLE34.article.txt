Card yearlings and Sequoia High beginning at 3:15 o'clock and a diving

exhibition by Hoy Winkelmann and<
Howard Adams immediately before'

sity students on presentation of a J
student body card. Women are in- '

NEW DIVING STAR
Stanford will have its first chance J
to see its newest diving sensation in
action when Howard Adams appears I
today. The young freshman won |
the Far Western A.A.U. champion- J
ship last summer and he is consid- j
ered one of the top divers on the j
Coast. Winkqlmann has been Pa- j
cifie Coast Intercollegiate title- !
holder for the past two years.
Thornton will start a team of four j
varsity veterans and two members]
of last year's undefeated l'rosh team, j
Ted Moreno, Roy Vitousek, and j
Dick Hoover, who have been out of I
some practice sessions during the
past week, are scheduled to start
along with Captain Johnny Lamb,
Harvey Rothschild, and Jack Loupe.
BRUINS UNTESTED
The Bruin team is untested as yet
this year, but Don Park's defending
conference co-champs are expected
to show plenty of strength. Dick
Norton, all-conference forward, will
undoubtedly provide some trouble
for the Indian defense. i
While the Bruin attack is built
around Norton, Thornton's boys
have been showing off a new Hun
garian short pass, fast break system
to date this season. The system
speeds up the game and takes the
responsibility off any one player.
VARSITY-FROSH SCRIMMAGE
The varsity has scrimmaged the
frosh bunch several times in prepa
ration for the Bruin contest, and the
yearlings have shown more than
lots of scrap in holding the big boys
to close times every time.
The Papooses trounced the highly
touted Paly High team 7-1 and Paly
looks like the outstanding team in
the high school league.
Had Bacon and Fred Manwaring
will start at forwards for the frosh
with Jim Abrahamson and either
John Iloltom or John Pollock at
guards. Scott Dudley will start at
sprint and Duncan at center back.
Ed Smith will open at goal and Bill
Ernst should see action in the sec- I
ond half.

along with Captain Johnny Lamb,
Harvey Rothschild, and Jack Loupe.
BRUINS UNTESTED
The Bruin team is untested as yet
this year, but Don Park's defending
conference co-champs are expected
to show plenty of strength. Dick
Norton, all-conference forward, will
undoubtedly provide some trouble
for the Indian defense. i
While the Bruin attack is built
around Norton, Thornton's boys
have been showing off a new Hun
garian short pass, fast break system
to date this season. The system
speeds up the game and takes the
responsibility off any one player.
VARSITY-FROSH SCRIMMAGE
The varsity has scrimmaged the
frosh bunch several times in prepa
ration for the Bruin contest, and the
yearlings have shown more than
lots of scrap in holding the big boys
to close times every time.

touted Paly High team 7-1 and Paly
looks like the outstanding team in
the high school league.
