## JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor Farm Yearlings To Tangle With U.C.L.A. Frosh Large Injury List May Cut Speed Of Unbeaten Papooses 
### JERRY MAYER 
Football is a very funny game.
\ For instance, you would think that
1 if two teams were playing, one of
! which had been undefeated in three
| games of major competition and the
| other of which had not tasted victory
in the same number of games, the
! former outfit would naturally be
ifavored.
For some reason, U.C.L.A.'s frosh
| outfit—with two losses and a tie to
| its discredit—doesn't think that at
J all, because they expect to thor
' oughly trounce Stanford's unde
feated Papooses tomorrow in the
Los Angeles Coliseum when the two
teams meet in the preliminary to the
U.C.L.A. vs. Idaho tilt,
! And the peculiar part is that the
j Brubabes could very easily do the
trick. In each of their three games,
! the Ucla frosh have badly outplayed
I their foes, only to have bad breaks
| cost them victories. In their first
I game, Coach Norman Duncan's year
j Lings pushed Chafl'ey J.C. all over the
{ gridiron, only to lose, 6-0, when
j Chaffey recovered a blocked kick
behind the Bruin goal.
BAD BREAKS
In their second game, the Bru
babes were trailing California, 7-6,
in the last quarter and were knock
| ing at the Bear goal when their bad
j break made its belated appearance,
j Leo Cantor flipped a perfect pass to
Monty Steadman, who was in the
j clear headed for a touchdown. How
ever, Steadman deflected the ball
into the hands of the Bear safety
man, who returned the interception
to U.C.L.A.'s 23. from where they
quickly pushed over another score
against their disheartened foes.
The Uclans showed definitely that
they were a football team to be reck
oned with by tying Santa Ana J.C.,
13-13. The Duncanmen made 15
first downs to 7 in this game, and
experts agreed that they were two
I touchdowns better than their foes.
STANFORD INJURIES
Staniord also has a bail club worth
talking about—what there is of it.
Frank Albert, offensive spark, will
start, but he hasn't been able to
practice this week because of a
strained groin injury; "Bud" Radditz,
left tackle, has been bothered by an
injury which at first was diagnosed
as a slight concussion; John Stur
geon, hard-blocking right half, is
i still taking it easy because of his
! back injury sustained in the S.C.
game; Burt Talcott, left end, has a
charley horse, and Fred Meyer prob
ably will give up his starting post at
right end to Ed Wilson because of
a bruised knee. As if this wasn't
| enough, Don Grant, who took Stur
| geon's place at right half last week,
| is out probably for the rest of the
! season because of a broken finger.
HUMORS DENIED
Coach Harry Shipkey denied ru
mors last night that his team would
I line up for the opening kick-off with
! crutches.
Thirty-two Papooses will entrain
; for Los Angeles at 8:10 o'clock to
| night. Those making the trip are as
j follows, with starters named first:
! Left ends—Talcott, Ellett, Murphy
! Left tackles — Radditz, Schmidt,

to U.C.L.A.'s 23. from where they

{ gridiron, only to lose, 6-0, when
j Chaffey recovered a blocked kick
behind the Bruin goal.
BAD BREAKS
In their second game, the Bru
babes were trailing California, 7-6,
in the last quarter and were knock
| ing at the Bear goal when their bad
j break made its belated appearance,
j Leo Cantor flipped a perfect pass to
Monty Steadman, who was in the
j clear headed for a touchdown. How
ever, Steadman deflected the ball
into the hands of the Bear safety
man, who returned the interception
to U.C.L.A.'s 23. from where they
quickly pushed over another score
against their disheartened foes.
The Uclans showed definitely that
they were a football team to be reck
oned with by tying Santa Ana J.C.,
13-13. The Duncanmen made 15
first downs to 7 in this game, and
experts agreed that they were two
I touchdowns better than their foes.
STANFORD INJURIES
Staniord also has a bail club worth
talking about—what there is of it.
Frank Albert, offensive spark, will
start, but he hasn't been able to
practice this week because of a
strained groin injury; "Bud" Radditz,
left tackle, has been bothered by an
injury which at first was diagnosed
as a slight concussion; John Stur
geon, hard-blocking right half, is
i still taking it easy because of his
! back injury sustained in the S.C.
game; Burt Talcott, left end, has a
charley horse, and Fred Meyer prob
ably will give up his starting post at
right end to Ed Wilson because of
a bruised knee. As if this wasn't
| enough, Don Grant, who took Stur
| geon's place at right half last week,
| is out probably for the rest of the
! season because of a broken finger.
HUMORS DENIED
Coach Harry Shipkey denied ru
mors last night that his team would
I line up for the opening kick-off with
