big sports week-end
1 on the Stanford campus will be
gin this afternoon with two water
polo games and a diving exhibition.
Freshman swimmers will splash
around against Sequoia High be
ginning at 3:15. It will be a close
game, but the Indians will probably
end up on the long end.
A real thriller will be the var
sity game against the U.C.L.A.
Bruins. Big things are expected
of the Cards as they open their
conference season. The Uclans are
not expected to present a great
deal of competition, but the time
has not been known that a good
bunch of swimmers could not Ik*
found at West wood. It may be a
close game but a sure win for
Stanford.
Roy Winkelmann and Howard
Adams, finest pair of divers ever to
appear for Stanford, are expected
to steal the*show this afternoon in
their exhibition performance. It
will be the first campus appearance
for Adams, freshman ace who re
cently brought home the bacon in
the Far Western A.A.U. competi
tion.

undefeated booters
k will meet a strong U.S.F. soccer
team at 10:30 tomorrow morning on
the field by the varsity tennis
courts.
The Dons always have a fine
team, and this year's eleven in
cludes mostly men who have
played soccer all their lives in and
around San Francisco. Two games
with them last year ended in a
tie and 1-0 loss for the Cards.
Added experience this year, how
ever, should give Stanford the edge
to chalk up its third victory in four
conference games. The first game
this year ended in a tie with S.F.J.C.
Freshman booters will meet a San
Francisco high school team at 9
o'clock.

r pOMORROW'S varsity football
game will be all up in the air.
Trojans have a strong and heavy
line, a mighty hard one to break
through. The only solution will be
to go over it, or occasionally around
it. So Fred Ledeboer will be tossing
them one after another, and if
enough connect, the Cards will win
another game on passes.
Of course, Gallarnoau can toss
'em too, and the team will probably
capitalize to some extent on his de
ceiving southpaw. Then there will be
reserve passers Hamilton and Alus
tiza if Standlee's two weeks' rest
prevents him from loosening up,
which is not likely. And Casey is
another lefty of no mean ability.
The reason Southern California
gridders are likely to be throwing
the ball is that their ground plays
just haven't worked this season.
Since each team, Stanford and
U.S.C., thinks it has the best back
field on the Coast, it will be to some
extent a game of backfields. In
juries, however, will cut down the
two offenses considerably.
Paulman and Fay are definitely
out, according to Tiny Thornhill,
leaving two Card backfield spots
open to reserves.
Don't be surprised if Ambrose
Schindler, in person, steps onto
the field tomorrow. Amb.v's knee
operation took him out before the
first Trojan game, and although it
is not generally known, he even

! turned in bis suit for the season.
But the whispering grapevine
leads us to believe that if we see
i a little guy in a red and yellow
uniform with feet that move so
fast we can't Lee them, we'll know
that Schindler is back with the
Trojans.
Although nobody is definitely out
| for the Trojans, there wiil be a
| group of recently-injureds, and
i Howard Jones knows you can never
j tell about them. Grenville Lansdell
| and Bob Peoples will both be trying
j not to favor sore spots that have
I kept them in civies recently.
Don't worry too much about
| Stanford's kicking. Pauiman and
Fay will have the Indians' two
best booting feet in street shoes
or possibly in hospital beds, but
Ledebocr is no dub kicker, and
there are plenty of reserves versed
in the art.
It will be the best game staged at
Stanford this season, and while odds
are 2-1 against us, let's give our
; selves the edge and pray.

j j>APOOSE gridders will leave to
! night to spend their first week
end away from home. They'll be in
hostile Bruin territory with nary
a rooter to give them the phenome
nal backing that has been theirs so
far.
1 The U.C.L.A. game will be an easy
one for the yearlings, but it will be
a good test of their pass defense.
Brubabes are noted for their aerial
attack, originating in the halfback
spot held by Izzie Canto's younger
brother. Of course, the Stanford
boys will have a few things to show
the Southerners about passing, and
I have a good chance of running up
la sizeable tally. But if they cover
'the pass receivers, they can go even
farther and make it a love score. ..
At any rate, they'll be up against
an underdog team, and it will be
a good chance for Coach Harry
; Shipkcy to use some reserves. It
! is hard to understand why he has
hesitated to give the seconds and
j thirds a chance when Papooses
! have held leads as decisive as 39-0
1 against Pomona Jaysees and 22-0
against the Trojan l'rosh.
Well, here's your chance, Harry,
;to put them in there and give them
jsome experience before they come
back home and have to play in a
I stadium full of familiar faces.
