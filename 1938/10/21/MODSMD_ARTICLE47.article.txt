STANFORD last night laid the groove for the
Axe to follow to the Trojan's neck on Sat
urday, when the U.S.C. football men invade the
campus ready to tear apart the Big Red Machine.
The Farm, however, has a far different idea.
In fact, it has a traditional yell that expresses
that idea much better than anything that's been
written for a long time.
The football team, in better shape than it's
been so far this season—even counting the
Oregon victory—despite a long injury list, also
has that same idea.
Tiny Thornhill's men this last week have
taken on new plays, have shown that those new
plays are going to work against Trojan defenses.
Where before the team possessed fire, spark
and drive, it now has precision as well. The
Red Roller is well polished for the biggest on
campus game of the season.
Trojans are just as anxious to win the game
as Stanford's Indians, for upon the outcome of
the battle may hinge the New Year's Day invi
tation to the Rose Bowl — depending upon
whether Cal is licked before the Big Game or
is licked on that day by Stanford.
Football men give Stanford even chances to
take the S.C. game—but Stanford knows better,
for Stanford definitely is going to win it. And
Stanford's team knows it.
From a slow start, the roller is gradually pick
ing up steam to
GIVE 'EM THE AXE.—H. L. S.
