HOLLYWOOD came to Stanford last night,
as it always does when frosh and Farm
turn out for the S.C. rally. The parade came
down the Row, the band played, the torches
flared, the horns successfully deafened every
body for miles around, and the frosh wore
pajamas.
What the frosh also did was prove conclu
sively to Stanford that when it comes to spirit,
'42 takes back seat to no one. The turnout may
have been small, but there's no doubt it was
select. It yelled when Turner wanted it to, and
it yelled when he didn't; and several times it
seriously debated starting a first-class riot.
That it did not is due in part to Rally Com
mittee and the ushers, who did a good job well
under considerable pressure, and in part to '42's
own good sense. The frosh realized that im
plicit in the right to have a good time is the duty
to keep it within bounds; and this they did.
They may have been more interested in
damning the upperclassmen than they were
in damning Troy, but they managed to give
their attention to that, too, long enough to go
on record as definitely and finally opposed to
any and all of the works of U.S.C.
Because efficient organization had handled
all the details beforehand, the Roble serenade
went off without the customary attempt to scale
the walls and break down the door; and when
the frosh were released on their own to Paly
and the Varsity, the story was the same; plenty
of enthusiasm, plus the sense to keep it under
control.
To '42, a little bit young, congratulations on
achieving a minor Stanford miracle: an S.C.
rally which showed Stanford spirit without the
excesses which too often go with it. â€”A.S. D.
