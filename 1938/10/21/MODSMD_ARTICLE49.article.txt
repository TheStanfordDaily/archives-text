AFTER Ex Corn's pat on the head the other
night, Cardinals is happy; happy that no
longer do they need an official "prodder."
happy that the campus wholeheartedly ap

proves their recently announced policy of big
ger and better campus dances.
They were also happy night before last when
committee reports proved the after-game dance
following the Oregon spectacle a success.
Whether it was Ex Committee's suggestion
that Cardinals "get off the dime," whether it
was a realization of growing campus disfavor,
or whether it was a troubling conscience, Car
dinals can now beam with unrestrained bright
ness down its collective nose at former critics.
The group's plans now include a much more
extensive program than ever before — junior
transfers will be called upon for ideas, the Big
Game rallies and celebrations will be larger
than before, post-game dances will be oftener.
After games, then, Stanford will twinkle-toe
its way to the women's gym, foot powder in its
shoes, pepped up over its chance to swing out
over the waxed hardwood, which probably will
resemble the stadium floor jam-packed with
football players.—H. L. S.
