SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN
i ORDINARILY I have a profound admiration for
Roblc women. They are charmingly ornamental
creatures, and the ones that don't giggle are definitely
on the asset side of the Stanford ledger. But my faith
was shaken yesterday when The Daily informed me
that the Big Game bonfire would have to be built in
one day because it made Roble women "hysterical."
The whole thing reads like something out of Scho
penhauer. It is packed with unfairness, and has a
strong flavor of the Victorian custom which made a
nuisance out of women by permitting them to swoon
at every pause in the conversation. Because freshman
women want to have a pretty little emotional binge,
Stanford has to reduce its celebration to a soothing
dead level. The Roble girls decide to kick their heels
on the floor and scream, and so the University has to
give them a bromide.

As a matter of fact, I was considerably surprised
to learn that the women will go off the emotional
springboard with so little provocation. This seems to
be one of the few occasions in history when a mere
bonfire has rated more than academic interest from
women. Helen sat quietly amidst the flames of Troy,
waiting for her Greek husband to show up and serve
subpoena. Nero's court gave the burning of Rome and
the subsequent roasting of Christians no more than a
raised eyebrow. And yet the Roble women have hys
terics over a bonfire.
There is no reason why the freshman women
shouldn't come through Big Game week with perfectly
normal blood pressure. It isn't as though the city were
about to be sacked and the inhabitants iiut to the
sword. They need not worry about being carried off
into slavery. The worst that can possibly happen is
that somebody will whistle if they are careless about
pulling down their shades.

Roble girls get hysterical because they find it a
convenient form of exhibitionism. When the men
are building the pile, and serving guard duty with
military romanticism, the girls feel that fhoy too must
make a contribution. And so they have "hysterics,"
which is a polite term covering everything from
screaming jitters to an attempted Tarzan act with the
ivy on the wall.
Of course, there is no reason why Stanford should
take the spike out. of its celebration simply because a
few neurotic girls weren't taught self-control at home.
The best thing to do would be to lock Roble and leave
the girls to themselves. The trouble would end there,
because most women treat hysterics like liquor; they
can take it or lave it alone. But dear Alma Mater's
maternal instincts won't permit that. If the little dears
get nervous, they must be sheltered.

And so the bonfire will be built in one day. And we
will be lucky if it's big enough to toast marshmallows.
The Roble women will go their jittery way in peace.
It all seems annoyingly useless. After all, they are
big girls now. At least they wear long dresses.
