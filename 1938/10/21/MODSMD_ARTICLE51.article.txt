IT'S no wonder Harry Shipkey's frosh football team
| beat. Salinas Saturday. Those boys from Salinas
' are a little blind and they're dumb in the feet. Or at
least one of them is.
After the game he got a date with one of the Roble
women (which may or may not be used as test of his
eye-sight, depending on the woman). He put on his
pretty clothes, slicked up his hair, and put on his
shoes. His shoes made a pair in that there were two
of them and they v/ere both black.
Only, one of them had a square toe, the other a
round toe. And one of them was a half size larger
than the other one.
With these cock-eyed shoes on, he went over to
Roble and picked up his date. Fine. The date was for
Rio del Mar, so he drove on down to Rio del Mar—
and found that the small shoe was getting a little
tight, so tight he couldn't dance.
But he had a nice ride.

Professor Fagan, who likes his little joke, Rave one
of his econ classes a hint the other day which he hopes
J some loyal Roosevelt supporter will rush to Wash
! ington with and whisper in the President's ear.
Roosevelt, he says, has spent six years now trying
to relieve unemployment. Obviously. But Professor
Fagan says his tactics have been all wrong. He has
discouraged war. He should have encouraged it.
Look at the last war. Professor Fagan says. The
United tSates made six billion during the war. They
lost four billion or so on loans, but still that's nearly
two billion profit. And look at all the men who were
employed. In one way or another.

IN CARDINALS' meeting Wednesday night, the boys
and si rls were talking about having a committee to
greet the concert series artists when they come to the
Farm. There was an immediate, "Let's greet Helen
Jepson" chorus.
"Yeah." said President Roy Thompson, "she's all
right—or is she colored."
Someone else mentioned greeting Yehudi Menuhin.
j Yeah, but he s married," one of the gal's objected.

Last year, I hear, one of the fraternities was going
j to have an open house or something. To help pretty
| up the place they got out their wax and rubbed it care-
I fully over the floors. Then they started to go over it
; with the waxing machine.
And they found that the wax thev had rubbed all
j over the floor was soap.
