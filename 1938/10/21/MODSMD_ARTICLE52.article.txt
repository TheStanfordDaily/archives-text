# Hank Luisetti Film Interests Stanfordites
## 
### 
"Campus Confessions," with llank
Luisetti, pLaying currently at the
Stanford Theater in PaJo Alto
You know the story of "Campus
Confessions." It's been done hun
dreds of times before by the movies,
usually with a football background.
The athletic star is kept out of a
crucial game because of scholastic
troubles, but at the last minute the
Dean decides he can play. By then
he has gone out to get drunk, or as
in this picture, to talk to a tailor.
The heroine and president of the
university go find him and bring him
back just in time to win the game.
The only redeeming feature, in
fact the only reason for the whole
picture, is the basketball playing of
Hank Luisetti and other Stanford
ites. Hank isn't much of an actor,
but anyone from the Farm will get
a thrill out of watching him lead the
"Laughing Boys" into action again.
Art Stoefen and "Beebs" Lee from
last year's varsity and Dinty Moore,
captain of the team for the '35-'36
and '36-'37 seasons, are Hank's bas
ketball teammates and are in sev
eral other campus sequences. Sev
eral other Stanfordites can be spot
ted in the mob scenes.
Betty Grable, who is supposed to
be the typical college girl, doesn't
help the picture any. The title is
misleading, of course, as no one con
fesses anything. It might have been
a better idea if Paramount had just
taken moving pictures of one of our
basketball games of last season, in
stead of building a story around
Hank. But in spite of the weak story,
the picture is worth seeing for the
scenes of Hank and the rest of the
team.
