# Pelleas and Melisande, given by the San Francisco Opera Company
## 
### 
An audience subdued i}y the
dreamy quality of Claude Debussy's
"Pelleas and Melisande" showed its
approval of Wednesday night's per
formance in the San Francisco Op
era House.
"Pelleas and Melisande," often
called the perfect music drama, is
as far removed from the "windy
spaces" of Wagner opera as it is
from the climactic music of the Ital
ians.
The loveliest score we have heard
in a Jong time almost reaches the
point of sustained song, but never
quite steps over into melody. A
silent orchestra, and voices which
keep the inflections and tones of
ordinary speech, build up a treat
ment of dialogue which is new to us.
A dreamy air of unreality is the
atmosphere of both the music and
the story, which is an almost fairy
version of the good old triangle
theme.
Melisande of the long yellow hair
is the subject of a gentle, almost
tearlul theme which is continually
recurrent throughout the opera. The
fate motive is treated in a subdued
way which is effective because of
its deadly quiet.
The muted quality of the death
scene is particularly sensitive in its
complete lack of dramatic outbursts.
The serenity and other worldliness
of the scene render it the most ef
fective of the entire opera.
Complete absence of melody and
definite arias is noted at once in
hearing the opera for the first time.
Top honors of the performance go
to baritone Carlton Gauld for his
fine portrayal of Golaud, the unfor
tunate husband of Melisande. Hie
rest of the small cast turned in
smooth, finished performances in
keeping with the atmosphere of the
opera,
