# CAMPUS OPINION
## TIRES NAILED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
With the completion of the new
Education Building, complete with
parking lot, much rejoicing was felt
by owners or drivers of assorted
makes of transportation devices.
Unfortunately the rejoicing lasted
only as long as respective tires re
mained round on both sidesâ€”which
was not long enough.
Since convenient parking space on
campus is limited, would it be too
much to ask that the nails in the
Education parking lot be removed?
