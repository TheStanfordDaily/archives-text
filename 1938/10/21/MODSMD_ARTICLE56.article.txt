The Editor, Sir:

your columns to be filled with
prejudiced propaganda in regard to
the State Pound Law, you might in
sert the actual reading of the pro
posal itself for those of us who don't
wish to accept the word of those
who would naturally be against the
law without using our right, as "ed
ucated" people, to judge for our
selves.
Just as logical arguments might
be put forward by an antivivisection
ist who believes that the satisfaction
that people derive knowing that
little Spot will not be cut up on the
biologist's table is moce valuable
than the loss of some lives. Maybe
not. But stop this exploitation from
the higher realms and get back to
some facts, and maybe, unbiased
scholarship.
It seems as (hough Mr. Cobbs is a
believer in "progress."
