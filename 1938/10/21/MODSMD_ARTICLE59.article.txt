# NYA Employment Release Cards Due
## 
### 
All undergraduates who have ap
plied for NYA work must sign their
release cards today or before noon
Saturday. These cards are official
permits to work and no name is
placed on the payroll until release
card has been properly signed.
A new release card has to be
signed for each month between the
15th and 22nd. Failure to sign
promptly will mean a reduction in
amount of money which the student
will be permitted to earn, and a
second offense will cause dropping
from payroll. The same rule applies
likewise to turning time reports in
at the end of each week-end and at
the end of the payroll period.
