# Law Students To Hold Trials
## Moot Court to Hear S.F. Strike Problem 
### 
One of strike-torn San Francisco's
biggest problems will be worked out
on the Stanford campus next Mon
day evening.
Attorney Robert Littler, a promi
nent authority on labor controver
sies in the bay city, will sit as Chief
Justice at the first of this year's moot
court trials. Court will convene at
7:30 in Room 12, Law Building, and
the courtroom will be open to spec
tators.
TYPICAL CASE
The case before the judicial board,
to consist of Mr. Little as chief, and
two law school men as associates, is
one which the San Francisco lawyer
may be called upon to handle in
the U. S. Appellate Courts in the
near future.
Arguments will be presented in the
case by law school students Sam
Thcrman and Dean Mitchell, on one
side, with Andy Spears and Dave
Folsom opposing.
This case will begin a series of
trials on current, undecided legal
issues, which will culminate this
spring in a cash award presented to
the University's outstanding law
student.
NEW TRIAL ON TUESDAY
A second case will be presented
Tuesday evening, by a different set
of student lawyers, before Mr. Gar
rett Elmore, Palo Alto attorney, as
judge. The controversy will involve
the management of a theater which
refused to deliver a Bank Night prize
to the holder of the winning ticket.
One of the highlights of the trials
will be the "cross-examination" of
the counselors by the presiding
judges. The awarding of laurels will
depend largely on how the Univer
sity men handle the sharp questions
of an experienced lawyer.
The court will be in session the
evening of October 24 from 7:30 to
9:30 o'clock. The campus is invited
to attend.
