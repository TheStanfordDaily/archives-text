# Pathologist Values Work On Animals
## Dr. Schultz Names Infantile Paralysis Fight as Example 
### JACK BURTT 
Citing the fight against infantile
paralysis as a particular example,
Dr. E. W. Schultz, professor of bac
teriology and experimental pathol
ogy, in a statement which he re
leased recently, attemtped to show
the part played by animal experi
mentation in medical research.
Nothing was known of the nature
of infantile paralysis until European
investigators succeeded in transmit
ting the disease ot monkeys, accord
ing to Dr. Schultz. Once this trans
mission was affected, however, it was
possible to determine the causal
agent and to set about finding a
suitable combatant agent, he ex
plained.
IS COMMITTEE MEMBER
Dr. Schultz is a member of the
campus committee sponsoring the
local drive against the State Hu
mane Pound Act which seeks to
make it illegal for laboratories to
receive animals from pounds, and
his statement was issued in support
of the campaign.
Partial text of Dr. Schultz's state
ment follows:
"The value of animal experimenta
tion in advancing knowledge of dis
ease is well illustrated in the study
of infantile paralysis. Practically all
that we know today about the na
ture of this disease and of the prob
lems which it presents has been
gathered from observations on the
experimental disease in monkeys.
MYSTERY .10 YEARS AGO
"Thirty years ago nothing at all
was known regarding the cause of
this disease. It was not until two
prominent European investigators
(Landsteiner and Levaditi) in 1909
succccdcd in transmitting it to mon
keys that headway began to be
made. Within a year after its suc
cessful transmission to monkeys the
causal agent was demonstrated to
be a virus which is able to pass the
pores of bacteria tight filters and
therefore too small to be seen with
a microscope.
In both man and susceptible mon
keys the virus picks out only the
nerve cells—motor nerve cells being
especially vulnerable to it. From ex
perimental observations on monkeys
we now know where the virus can
enter the body and having entered,
how it proceeds through the brain
to reach the vulnerable motor nerve
cells in the cord. Information such
as this is basic to any intelligent at
tempt to control the disease.
PRESENTS PROBLEM
"Infantile paralysis has presented
a particularly difficult problem and
it is certain that without the ad
vantage of animal experimentation
we would still be where we were
more than 30 years ago. Thanks to
animal experimentation we have
learned considerable about the na
ture ot the disease and there is now
good reason for being optimistic
with regard to effecting measures for
its control. Rays of light are be
ginning to show through what ap
peared to be an impenetrable cloud
and we may now expect soon to
have in our hands the knowledge
necessary to strike back effectively
at this enemy of our youth."

Citing the fight against infantile
paralysis as a particular example,
Dr. E. W. Schultz, professor of bac
teriology and experimental pathol
ogy, in a statement which he re
leased recently, attemtped to show
the part played by animal experi
mentation in medical research.
Nothing was known of the nature
of infantile paralysis until European
investigators succeeded in transmit
ting the disease ot monkeys, accord
ing to Dr. Schultz. Once this trans
mission was affected, however, it was
possible to determine the causal
agent and to set about finding a
suitable combatant agent, he ex
plained.
IS COMMITTEE MEMBER
Dr. Schultz is a member of the
campus committee sponsoring the
local drive against the State Hu
mane Pound Act which seeks to
make it illegal for laboratories to
receive animals from pounds, and
his statement was issued in support
of the campaign.
Partial text of Dr. Schultz's state
ment follows:
"The value of animal experimenta
tion in advancing knowledge of dis
ease is well illustrated in the study
of infantile paralysis. Practically all
that we know today about the na
ture of this disease and of the prob
lems which it presents has been
gathered from observations on the
experimental disease in monkeys.
MYSTERY .10 YEARS AGO
"Thirty years ago nothing at all
was known regarding the cause of
this disease. It was not until two
prominent European investigators
(Landsteiner and Levaditi) in 1909
succccdcd in transmitting it to mon
keys that headway began to be
made. Within a year after its suc
cessful transmission to monkeys the
causal agent was demonstrated to
be a virus which is able to pass the
pores of bacteria tight filters and
therefore too small to be seen with
a microscope.
In both man and susceptible mon
keys the virus picks out only the
nerve cells—motor nerve cells being
especially vulnerable to it. From ex
perimental observations on monkeys
we now know where the virus can
enter the body and having entered,
how it proceeds through the brain
to reach the vulnerable motor nerve
cells in the cord. Information such
as this is basic to any intelligent at
tempt to control the disease.
PRESENTS PROBLEM
"Infantile paralysis has presented
a particularly difficult problem and
it is certain that without the ad
vantage of animal experimentation
we would still be where we were
more than 30 years ago. Thanks to
animal experimentation we have
learned considerable about the na
ture ot the disease and there is now
good reason for being optimistic
with regard to effecting measures for
its control. Rays of light are be
ginning to show through what ap
peared to be an impenetrable cloud
and we may now expect soon to
have in our hands the knowledge
necessary to strike back effectively
at this enemy of our youth."
