# New Terman Book Prophesies Criteria For Marital Happiness
## 
### TEMPLETON PECK 
Dr. Lewis M. Tei'man, the Stan
ford psychologist who developed the
intelligence test in America, pre
dicted in his book, "Psychological
Factors in Marital Happiness," which
came from the press this week, that
within the next decade or two sci
ence may be able to tell a bride and j
groom whether their chances for
marital happiness are good, aver
age, or poor.
"It is by no means unreasonable,"
Dr. Terman declares in his "Psycho
logical Factors in Marital Happi
ness," "to expect that it will be
possible to predict marital compati
bility with greater accuracy than it
Is now possible to predict academic
success from a composite of intelli
gence test scores and previous
scholarship records. . . .
MARRIAGE ORACLE
"Many will smile at the optimism
of a psychologist who assumes that
any man and woman contemplat
ing marriage will overstay their
intentions long enough to appeal for
guidance to this modernized ver- I
sion of the oracle. Whether so much j
optimism is warranted remains to
be seen. Twenty years ago the use
of intelligence tests in the selection
and guidance of college students
aroused widespread derision, but at
present admission to college is de
nied to thousands of high school
graduates every year in part on the
basis of their intelligence scores.
"Inasmuch as our data suggest
that marital happiness can be pre
dicted by our scale almost as ac
curately as the college success of a
high school graduate can be pre
dicted from an intelligence test, we
are sanguine enough to believe that
such a scale, once its validity has
been thoroughly established, will
not be entirely neglected."
NEW APPROACH
Dr. Terman's book is the result
of a new approach to the study of
marriage. It describes an effort to
measure marital happiness through
measuring the attitudes, practices
and satisfactions of married couples.
With funds provided by a grant to
Stanford University from the Na
tional Research Council, Dr. Terman
directed the making of a survey
which included 791 married couplcs
in California. One hundred and
seventy couples lived in San Fran
cisco bay region, the remainder in
Southern California. They were of
the middle and upper middle class;
the average of the group had gone
through the second year of college.
Frankness and honesty were secured
through giving the survey questions
separately to husbands and wives by
the use of a technique which guar
anteed anonymity.
Many of the results are surpris
ing and promise to upset certain es
tablished tenets of sexologists,
psycho-analysts, divorce judges and
others who have undertaken to
analyze marital happiness.
IMPORTANT FACTORS
One of the most important find
ings, perhaps, is that personality and
background factors have more crit
ical bearing on happiness in mar
riage than sex factors. Sexual com
patibility or incompatibility i?
largely determined by personality
and background forerunners.
"Sexual incompatibility in the
stricter sense of the term," Dr. Ter
man states, "is often a primary
cause of marital unhappiness; whal
is called sexual incompatibility is it
the majority of cases essentially in
compatibility of the conditionec
■ personalities."
This leads Dr. Terman to believ*
in the possibility of predicting «

young engaged couple's chances of
being happy in marriage, while sex
factors obviously cannot.
He has devised a happiness pre
diction scale. On the basis of this
scale, Dr. Terman would give the
"go" signal to an intending bride
or bridegroom who scored well
within the upper range of indica
tions for happiness, would set the
"stop" signal (or at least the "cau-

tion" light) for those in the lower
range, and would give "no verdict"
to those whose scores were in the
middle range, since scores in that
range are "likely to be associated
with happiness of any degree."
What should a young couple look
for in their background and person
alities as fingerposts to happiness?
ASSETS LISTED
Dr. Terman lists ten background
circumstances "most predictive" of
marital happiness:
1. Superior happiness of parents.
2. Childhood happiness.
3. Lack of conflict with mother.
4. Home discipline that was firm,
not harsh.
5. Strong attachment to mother.
fi. Strong attachment to father.
7. Lack of conflict with father.
8. Parental frankness about mat
ters of sex.
!). Infrcqucncy and mildness of
childhood punishment.
10. Premarital attitude toward sex
that was free from disgust or aver
sion.

GOOD RISKS

Says Dr. Terman: ' The subject
who 'passes' on all 10 of these items
Is a distinctly better-than-average
marital risk. Any one of the 10 ap
pears from the data of this study to
be more important than virginity at
marriage."
In this latter connection, Dr. Ter
man found that fewer than one
third of women born since 1910 and
only one-eighth of men were with
out sex experience at. marriage,
compared to nearly nine-tenths of
the women and one-half the men
born before 1890. If this trend con
tinues at the same rate, virginity at
marriage will approach vanishing
point in about 20 years. Virginal
couples have a slightly higher chancc
for a happy marriage than others.
Personality factors favorable to
marital happiness appear to difTer
I somewhat as between men and
! women. Here is Dr. Terman's com

posite picture of happily married
men:
"They show evidence of an even
and stable emotional tone. Their
most characteristic reaction to oth
ers is that of co-operation. This is
reflected in their attitude toward
business superiors, with whom they
work well; in their attitude toward
women, which reflects equalitarian
ideals, and in their benevolent atti
tudes toward inferiors and under
privileged. In a gathering of people
they tend to be unselfconscious and
somewhat extroverted. As compar
ed with unhappy husbands, they
show superior initiative, a greater
tendency to take responsibility, and
greater willingness to give close at
tention to detail in their daily work.
They like methodical procedures
and methodical people. In money
matters they are saving and cau
tious. Conservative attitudes are
strongly characteristic of them. They
usually have a favorable attitude
toward religion and strongly uphold
the sex mores and other social con
ventions."
GROUP CHARACTERISTICS
Happily married women, as a
group, are "characterized by kindly
attitudes toward others and by the
expectation of kindly attitudes in re
| turn. They do not easily take of
fense and are not unduly concerned
about the impressions they make
upon others. They do not look upon
social relationships as rivalry situa
tions. They are co-operative, do not
object to subordinate roles, and are
not annoyed by advice from others.
| Missionary and ministering atti
tudes are frequently evidenced in
I their responses. They enjoy activi
j ties that bring educational or pleas
urable opportunities to others and
like to do things for the dependent
or underprivileged. They are me
thodical and painstaking in their
work, attentive to detail, and care
ful in regard to money. In religion,
morals and politics they tend to be
conservative and conventional. Their
expressed attitudes imply a quiet
self-assurance and a decidedly op
timistic outlook upon life."
Oddly, Dr. Terman found that
"the happiness of one spouse is to a
surprising degree independent of
the happiness of the other." From
this comes the conclusion that the
degree of satisfaction which one
finds in marriage depends largely
upon one's own characteristic atti
tudes and temperament and so need
not closely parallel the happiness of
one's marital partner.

NEW APPROACH
Dr. Terman's book is the result
of a new approach to the study of
marriage. It describes an effort to
measure marital happiness through
measuring the attitudes, practices
and satisfactions of married couples.
With funds provided by a grant to
Stanford University from the Na
tional Research Council, Dr. Terman
directed the making of a survey
which included 791 married couplcs
in California. One hundred and
seventy couples lived in San Fran
cisco bay region, the remainder in
Southern California. They were of
the middle and upper middle class;
the average of the group had gone
through the second year of college.
Frankness and honesty were secured
through giving the survey questions
separately to husbands and wives by
the use of a technique which guar
anteed anonymity.
Many of the results are surpris
ing and promise to upset certain es
tablished tenets of sexologists,
psycho-analysts, divorce judges and
others who have undertaken to
analyze marital happiness.
IMPORTANT FACTORS
One of the most important find
ings, perhaps, is that personality and
background factors have more crit
ical bearing on happiness in mar
riage than sex factors. Sexual com
patibility or incompatibility i?
largely determined by personality
and background forerunners.
"Sexual incompatibility in the
stricter sense of the term," Dr. Ter
man states, "is often a primary
cause of marital unhappiness; whal
is called sexual incompatibility is it
the majority of cases essentially in
compatibility of the conditionec
■ personalities."
This leads Dr. Terman to believ*
in the possibility of predicting «

young engaged couple's chances of
being happy in marriage, while sex
factors obviously cannot.
He has devised a happiness pre
diction scale. On the basis of this
scale, Dr. Terman would give the
"go" signal to an intending bride
or bridegroom who scored well
within the upper range of indica
tions for happiness, would set the
"stop" signal (or at least the "cau-

tion" light) for those in the lower
range, and would give "no verdict"
to those whose scores were in the
middle range, since scores in that
range are "likely to be associated
with happiness of any degree."
What should a young couple look
for in their background and person
alities as fingerposts to happiness?
ASSETS LISTED
Dr. Terman lists ten background
circumstances "most predictive" of
marital happiness:
1. Superior happiness of parents.
2. Childhood happiness.
3. Lack of conflict with mother.
4. Home discipline that was firm,
not harsh.
5. Strong attachment to mother.
fi. Strong attachment to father.
7. Lack of conflict with father.
8. Parental frankness about mat
ters of sex.
!). Infrcqucncy and mildness of
childhood punishment.
10. Premarital attitude toward sex
that was free from disgust or aver
sion.

GOOD RISKS

Says Dr. Terman: ' The subject
who 'passes' on all 10 of these items
Is a distinctly better-than-average
marital risk. Any one of the 10 ap
pears from the data of this study to
be more important than virginity at
marriage."
In this latter connection, Dr. Ter
man found that fewer than one
third of women born since 1910 and
only one-eighth of men were with
out sex experience at. marriage,
compared to nearly nine-tenths of
the women and one-half the men
born before 1890. If this trend con
tinues at the same rate, virginity at
marriage will approach vanishing
point in about 20 years. Virginal
couples have a slightly higher chancc
for a happy marriage than others.
Personality factors favorable to
marital happiness appear to difTer
I somewhat as between men and
! women. Here is Dr. Terman's com

posite picture of happily married
men:
"They show evidence of an even
and stable emotional tone. Their
most characteristic reaction to oth
ers is that of co-operation. This is
reflected in their attitude toward
business superiors, with whom they
work well; in their attitude toward
women, which reflects equalitarian
ideals, and in their benevolent atti
tudes toward inferiors and under
privileged. In a gathering of people
they tend to be unselfconscious and
somewhat extroverted. As compar
ed with unhappy husbands, they
show superior initiative, a greater
tendency to take responsibility, and
greater willingness to give close at
tention to detail in their daily work.
They like methodical procedures
and methodical people. In money
matters they are saving and cau
tious. Conservative attitudes are
strongly characteristic of them. They
usually have a favorable attitude
toward religion and strongly uphold
the sex mores and other social con
ventions."
GROUP CHARACTERISTICS
Happily married women, as a
group, are "characterized by kindly
attitudes toward others and by the
expectation of kindly attitudes in re
| turn. They do not easily take of
fense and are not unduly concerned
about the impressions they make
upon others. They do not look upon
social relationships as rivalry situa
tions. They are co-operative, do not
object to subordinate roles, and are
not annoyed by advice from others.
| Missionary and ministering atti
tudes are frequently evidenced in
I their responses. They enjoy activi
j ties that bring educational or pleas
urable opportunities to others and
like to do things for the dependent
or underprivileged. They are me
thodical and painstaking in their
work, attentive to detail, and care
ful in regard to money. In religion,
morals and politics they tend to be
conservative and conventional. Their
expressed attitudes imply a quiet
self-assurance and a decidedly op
timistic outlook upon life."
Oddly, Dr. Terman found that
"the happiness of one spouse is to a
surprising degree independent of
the happiness of the other." From
this comes the conclusion that the
degree of satisfaction which one
finds in marriage depends largely
upon one's own characteristic atti
tudes and temperament and so need
not closely parallel the happiness of
one's marital partner.


DR. LEWIS TERMAN
Dr. Lewis M. Tei'man, the Stan

intelligence test in America, pre

marriage. It describes an effort to
measure marital happiness through
measuring the attitudes, practices
and satisfactions of married couples.
With funds provided by a grant to
Stanford University from the Na
tional Research Council, Dr. Terman
directed the making of a survey
which included 791 married couplcs
in California. One hundred and
seventy couples lived in San Fran
cisco bay region, the remainder in
Southern California. They were of
the middle and upper middle class;
the average of the group had gone
through the second year of college.
Frankness and honesty were secured
through giving the survey questions
separately to husbands and wives by
the use of a technique which guar
anteed anonymity.
Many of the results are surpris
ing and promise to upset certain es
tablished tenets of sexologists,
psycho-analysts, divorce judges and
others who have undertaken to
analyze marital happiness.
IMPORTANT FACTORS
One of the most important find
ings, perhaps, is that personality and
background factors have more crit
ical bearing on happiness in mar
riage than sex factors. Sexual com
patibility or incompatibility i?
largely determined by personality
and background forerunners.
"Sexual incompatibility in the
stricter sense of the term," Dr. Ter
man states, "is often a primary
cause of marital unhappiness; whal
is called sexual incompatibility is it
the majority of cases essentially in
compatibility of the conditionec
■ personalities."
This leads Dr. Terman to believ*
in the possibility of predicting «

young engaged couple's chances of
being happy in marriage, while sex
factors obviously cannot.
He has devised a happiness pre
diction scale. On the basis of this
scale, Dr. Terman would give the
"go" signal to an intending bride
or bridegroom who scored well
within the upper range of indica
tions for happiness, would set the
"stop" signal (or at least the "cau-

tion" light) for those in the lower
range, and would give "no verdict"
to those whose scores were in the
middle range, since scores in that
range are "likely to be associated
with happiness of any degree."
What should a young couple look
for in their background and person
alities as fingerposts to happiness?
ASSETS LISTED
Dr. Terman lists ten background
circumstances "most predictive" of
marital happiness:
1. Superior happiness of parents.
2. Childhood happiness.
3. Lack of conflict with mother.
4. Home discipline that was firm,
not harsh.
5. Strong attachment to mother.
fi. Strong attachment to father.
7. Lack of conflict with father.
8. Parental frankness about mat
ters of sex.
!). Infrcqucncy and mildness of
childhood punishment.
10. Premarital attitude toward sex
that was free from disgust or aver
sion.

GOOD RISKS

Says Dr. Terman: ' The subject
who 'passes' on all 10 of these items
Is a distinctly better-than-average
marital risk. Any one of the 10 ap
pears from the data of this study to
be more important than virginity at
marriage."
In this latter connection, Dr. Ter
man found that fewer than one
third of women born since 1910 and
only one-eighth of men were with
out sex experience at. marriage,
compared to nearly nine-tenths of
the women and one-half the men
born before 1890. If this trend con
tinues at the same rate, virginity at
marriage will approach vanishing
point in about 20 years. Virginal
couples have a slightly higher chancc
for a happy marriage than others.
Personality factors favorable to
marital happiness appear to difTer
I somewhat as between men and
! women. Here is Dr. Terman's com

posite picture of happily married
men:
"They show evidence of an even
and stable emotional tone. Their
most characteristic reaction to oth
ers is that of co-operation. This is
reflected in their attitude toward
business superiors, with whom they
work well; in their attitude toward
women, which reflects equalitarian
ideals, and in their benevolent atti
tudes toward inferiors and under
privileged. In a gathering of people
they tend to be unselfconscious and
somewhat extroverted. As compar
ed with unhappy husbands, they
show superior initiative, a greater
tendency to take responsibility, and
greater willingness to give close at
tention to detail in their daily work.
They like methodical procedures
and methodical people. In money
matters they are saving and cau
tious. Conservative attitudes are
strongly characteristic of them. They
usually have a favorable attitude
toward religion and strongly uphold
the sex mores and other social con
ventions."
GROUP CHARACTERISTICS
Happily married women, as a
group, are "characterized by kindly
attitudes toward others and by the
expectation of kindly attitudes in re
| turn. They do not easily take of
fense and are not unduly concerned
about the impressions they make
upon others. They do not look upon
social relationships as rivalry situa
tions. They are co-operative, do not
object to subordinate roles, and are
not annoyed by advice from others.
| Missionary and ministering atti
tudes are frequently evidenced in
I their responses. They enjoy activi
j ties that bring educational or pleas
urable opportunities to others and
like to do things for the dependent
or underprivileged. They are me
thodical and painstaking in their
work, attentive to detail, and care
ful in regard to money. In religion,
morals and politics they tend to be
conservative and conventional. Their
expressed attitudes imply a quiet
self-assurance and a decidedly op
timistic outlook upon life."
Oddly, Dr. Terman found that
"the happiness of one spouse is to a
surprising degree independent of
the happiness of the other." From
this comes the conclusion that the
degree of satisfaction which one
finds in marriage depends largely
upon one's own characteristic atti
tudes and temperament and so need
not closely parallel the happiness of
one's marital partner.


DR. LEWIS TERMAN
Dr. Lewis M. Tei'man, the Stan
ford psychologist who developed the
intelligence test in America, pre
dicted in his book, "Psychological
Factors in Marital Happiness," which
came from the press this week, that
within the next decade or two sci
ence may be able to tell a bride and j
groom whether their chances for
marital happiness are good, aver
age, or poor.
"It is by no means unreasonable,"
Dr. Terman declares in his "Psycho
logical Factors in Marital Happi
ness," "to expect that it will be
possible to predict marital compati
bility with greater accuracy than it
Is now possible to predict academic
success from a composite of intelli
gence test scores and previous
scholarship records. . . .
MARRIAGE ORACLE
"Many will smile at the optimism
of a psychologist who assumes that
any man and woman contemplat
ing marriage will overstay their
intentions long enough to appeal for
guidance to this modernized ver- I
sion of the oracle. Whether so much j
optimism is warranted remains to
be seen. Twenty years ago the use
of intelligence tests in the selection
and guidance of college students
aroused widespread derision, but at

analyze marital happiness.
IMPORTANT FACTORS
One of the most important find
ings, perhaps, is that personality and
background factors have more crit
ical bearing on happiness in mar
riage than sex factors. Sexual com
patibility or incompatibility i?
largely determined by personality
and background forerunners.
"Sexual incompatibility in the
stricter sense of the term," Dr. Ter
man states, "is often a primary
cause of marital unhappiness; whal
is called sexual incompatibility is it
the majority of cases essentially in
compatibility of the conditionec
■ personalities."
This leads Dr. Terman to believ*
in the possibility of predicting «

young engaged couple's chances of
being happy in marriage, while sex
factors obviously cannot.
He has devised a happiness pre
diction scale. On the basis of this
scale, Dr. Terman would give the
"go" signal to an intending bride
or bridegroom who scored well
within the upper range of indica
tions for happiness, would set the
"stop" signal (or at least the "cau-

tion" light) for those in the lower
range, and would give "no verdict"
to those whose scores were in the
middle range, since scores in that
range are "likely to be associated
with happiness of any degree."
What should a young couple look
for in their background and person
alities as fingerposts to happiness?
ASSETS LISTED
Dr. Terman lists ten background
circumstances "most predictive" of
marital happiness:
1. Superior happiness of parents.
2. Childhood happiness.
3. Lack of conflict with mother.
4. Home discipline that was firm,
not harsh.
5. Strong attachment to mother.
fi. Strong attachment to father.
7. Lack of conflict with father.
8. Parental frankness about mat
ters of sex.
!). Infrcqucncy and mildness of
childhood punishment.
10. Premarital attitude toward sex
that was free from disgust or aver
sion.

GOOD RISKS

Says Dr. Terman: ' The subject
who 'passes' on all 10 of these items
Is a distinctly better-than-average
marital risk. Any one of the 10 ap
pears from the data of this study to
be more important than virginity at
marriage."
In this latter connection, Dr. Ter
man found that fewer than one
third of women born since 1910 and
only one-eighth of men were with
out sex experience at. marriage,
compared to nearly nine-tenths of
the women and one-half the men
born before 1890. If this trend con
tinues at the same rate, virginity at
marriage will approach vanishing
point in about 20 years. Virginal
couples have a slightly higher chancc
for a happy marriage than others.
Personality factors favorable to
marital happiness appear to difTer
I somewhat as between men and
! women. Here is Dr. Terman's com

posite picture of happily married
men:
"They show evidence of an even
and stable emotional tone. Their
most characteristic reaction to oth
ers is that of co-operation. This is
reflected in their attitude toward
business superiors, with whom they
work well; in their attitude toward
women, which reflects equalitarian
ideals, and in their benevolent atti
tudes toward inferiors and under
privileged. In a gathering of people
they tend to be unselfconscious and
somewhat extroverted. As compar
ed with unhappy husbands, they
show superior initiative, a greater
tendency to take responsibility, and
greater willingness to give close at
tention to detail in their daily work.
They like methodical procedures
and methodical people. In money
matters they are saving and cau
tious. Conservative attitudes are
strongly characteristic of them. They
usually have a favorable attitude
toward religion and strongly uphold
the sex mores and other social con
ventions."
GROUP CHARACTERISTICS
Happily married women, as a
group, are "characterized by kindly
attitudes toward others and by the
expectation of kindly attitudes in re
| turn. They do not easily take of
fense and are not unduly concerned
about the impressions they make
upon others. They do not look upon
social relationships as rivalry situa
tions. They are co-operative, do not
object to subordinate roles, and are
not annoyed by advice from others.
| Missionary and ministering atti
tudes are frequently evidenced in
I their responses. They enjoy activi
j ties that bring educational or pleas
urable opportunities to others and
like to do things for the dependent
or underprivileged. They are me
thodical and painstaking in their
work, attentive to detail, and care
ful in regard to money. In religion,
morals and politics they tend to be
conservative and conventional. Their
expressed attitudes imply a quiet
self-assurance and a decidedly op
timistic outlook upon life."
Oddly, Dr. Terman found that
"the happiness of one spouse is to a
surprising degree independent of
the happiness of the other." From
this comes the conclusion that the
degree of satisfaction which one
finds in marriage depends largely
upon one's own characteristic atti
tudes and temperament and so need
not closely parallel the happiness of
one's marital partner.


DR. LEWIS TERMAN
Dr. Lewis M. Tei'man, the Stan
ford psychologist who developed the
intelligence test in America, pre
dicted in his book, "Psychological
Factors in Marital Happiness," which
came from the press this week, that
within the next decade or two sci
ence may be able to tell a bride and j
groom whether their chances for
marital happiness are good, aver
age, or poor.
"It is by no means unreasonable,"
Dr. Terman declares in his "Psycho
logical Factors in Marital Happi
ness," "to expect that it will be
possible to predict marital compati
bility with greater accuracy than it
Is now possible to predict academic
success from a composite of intelli
gence test scores and previous
scholarship records. . . .
MARRIAGE ORACLE
"Many will smile at the optimism
of a psychologist who assumes that
any man and woman contemplat
ing marriage will overstay their
intentions long enough to appeal for
guidance to this modernized ver- I
sion of the oracle. Whether so much j
optimism is warranted remains to
be seen. Twenty years ago the use
of intelligence tests in the selection
and guidance of college students
aroused widespread derision, but at
present admission to college is de
nied to thousands of high school
graduates every year in part on the
basis of their intelligence scores.
"Inasmuch as our data suggest
that marital happiness can be pre
dicted by our scale almost as ac
curately as the college success of a
high school graduate can be pre
dicted from an intelligence test, we
are sanguine enough to believe that
such a scale, once its validity has
been thoroughly established, will
not be entirely neglected."
NEW APPROACH
Dr. Terman's book is the result
of a new approach to the study of
marriage. It describes an effort to
measure marital happiness through
measuring the attitudes, practices
and satisfactions of married couples.
With funds provided by a grant to
Stanford University from the Na
tional Research Council, Dr. Terman
directed the making of a survey
which included 791 married couplcs
in California. One hundred and
seventy couples lived in San Fran
cisco bay region, the remainder in
Southern California. They were of
the middle and upper middle class;
the average of the group had gone
through the second year of college.
Frankness and honesty were secured
through giving the survey questions
separately to husbands and wives by
the use of a technique which guar
anteed anonymity.
Many of the results are surpris
ing and promise to upset certain es
tablished tenets of sexologists,
psycho-analysts, divorce judges and
others who have undertaken to
analyze marital happiness.
