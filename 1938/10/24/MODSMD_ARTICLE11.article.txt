### 
VIENNA, Oct. 23 (UP). â€” Theo
dore Cardinal Innitzcr, who has
been a target of bitter Nazi attacks
as a result of a speech urging Cath
olic youth to stand by the church,
today formally denied he had ever
launched an "attack" on Fuehrer
Adolf Hitler.
The prelate, whose sermon on Oc
tober 7 resulted in rioting between
Catholic and Nazi youth groups
culminating in the wrecking of his
private chapel, said the words: "I
have decided upon a fight and am
ready for it," attributed to him by
Nazis, had never been spoken by
him.
