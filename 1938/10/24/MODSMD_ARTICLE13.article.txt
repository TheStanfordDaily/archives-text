### 
HONG KONG, Oct. 24 (Monday) j
(UP). â€”Japanese military dispatches I
today reported that mechanized
Japanese units had smashed into the
outer suburbs of China's provisional
capital in Hankow.
Simultaneously, it was reported,
without confirmation, that China's
war-time dictator, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek, had offered to re
sign if a satisfactory new govern
ment could be created under the
leadership of former Premier Wang
Ching-wei.
RESISTANCE CRUMBLING
Nearly all dispatches from the
fighting fronts in Central and South
China agreed that Chinese resist
ance on a national scale to Japan's
15-month-old invasion was crum
bling rapidly.
Japanese dispatches said that
Japanese naval vessels had passed
Kokia-tien, 19 miles below the pro
visional Chinese national capital, and
were advancing into the very heart
of the vital Wu-Han (Wuchang,
Hankow and Hanyang) area.
SUBURB OCCUPIED
The Japanese had occupied Twan
feng, one of Hankow's outer suburbs,
and were nearing the tri-city area
along four routes.
One report was that the Hankow-
Canton Railway had been occupied
by Japanese land units near Sien
ning, just south of the capital.
Nearly all of China's national
leaders had fled from the Hankow
area.
