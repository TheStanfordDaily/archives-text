## Talk with Roosevelt Brings New Decision 
### 
HYDE PARK, N.Y., Oct. 23 (UP).
—Harry Hopkins, Federal relief ad
ministrator, indicated tonight after
a series of conferences with Presi
dent Roosevelt that relief expendi
tures may be slashed during the next
fiscal year.
Hopkins emerged from his confer
ence with the president obviously
cheered by the report he was able
to submit on the nation's economic
outlook.
Asked what recommendation he
would make as to new appropria
tions, he observed:
A SMALLER WPA
"I do not know what it will be, but
undoubtedly it will be a figure re
lated to a smaller WPA than we have
now."
Explaining that he discussed with
Mr. Roosevelt the rise in business
and employment and its bearing on
the relief program, Hopkins said:
"I look to see the relief curve in
America go down at an early date,
possibly before election, in spite of
what some political enemies think.
"The old charge that we shove up
the relief rolls before election and
cut them down immediately there
after is just a lot of nonsense."
Hopkins, who said good-by to the
president preparatory to a swing
across the country, said in response
to questions that he talked of next
year's relief appropriation only gen
erally, declaring that Mr. Roosevelt
does not expect to receive estimates
from him until the middle of De
cember.
