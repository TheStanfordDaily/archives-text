BURLINGTON, la., Oct. 23 (UP).
â€”Unless the United tSates gets out
of the business of relief, Colonel
Frank Knox, 1936 Republican vice
presidential nominee, warned to
night, "we are all going to be drag
ged down to the dead level of so
cialistic mediocrity."
The country must regain its lost
morale, begin to pay back its debt,
in order to move normally again,
Colonel Knox said. People must get
out of the habit of dumping their
troubles into the lap of the govern
ment and "solve some of these
troubles ourselves."
