# Trojans Outlast Weakened Cards In 13-2 Victory
## "Baffle Pass,' Reserve Strength Aid Troy in Trouncing Indians 
### ARCH JENKINS 
for 40 minutes last Saturday, it looked like our doddering old Indian
was goings to sneak in with a two-point victory over Southern California.
But Stanford just didn't have the weapons necessary to hang on, and
Troy won going away, !.'» to 2, with an amazing amount of man-power
which reached to four-deep in some positions.

♦ When Oliie Day dribbled Freddie
Ledeboer's first-quarter quick kick
clear back into his own end zone
and then fell on it for a Stanford
safety, everything seemed well un
der control. Gene Coldiron and
Corky Donahue almost beat Day to
the ball and what would have been
a touchdown, but the S. C. safely
man was there first.
TROJANS OUTPLAYED
After the safety, the Cards seemed
well enough inspired to outplay Troy

for the rest of the half. Still that
just turned out to be the lull be
fore the storm.
Southern California has a very
tricky pass play which sends one
receiver on either side of the de
fensive fullback. All the defender
can possibly do is to play the ball
and make his tackle as quickly as
possible.
CALVELLI PASS DEFENSE
It fell to Tony Calvelli to be the
man at whom the Trojan quarter
backs were throwing their "baffle
pass," and old Tony mussed it up
for nearly three quarters before he
played himself into complete ex
haustion and had to quit the game.
Without him Stanford had abso
lutely no check-mate for the flat
pass strategy.
Granny Lansdell began throwing
just a mite farther toward the side
lines and they put the extremely
speedy little Bill Sangster on the
receiving end to heckle the Stan
ford fullbacks even more. Sangster
caught one almost on the scrim
mage line, dodged Wally DeWitt eas
ily, and out maneuvered Ledebocr to
score standing up after a 21-yard
spurt.
TROY PASSES CLICK
What made the first score particu
larly sad was the fact that Tiny
Thornhill had the flat pass ofTen.se
ably checked so long as Calvelli
held up. With him gone, the touch
down was a matter of form. Thorn
hill first selected DeWitt as lus al
ternate, then switched to Jakie
Thompson in the fourth quarter in
a search for speed.
Midway through the fourth quar
ter, Thornhill yanked Hampton Poo!
out of his left guard spot because
Pool was just about as played out
as was Calvelli. In four plays over
Pool's vacated position, the Trojans
had scored again with Micky An
dersen stumbling over for their last
tally.
