# Law Students to Try National Strike Problem in Moot Court
## 
### 
Stanford law students will point
the way to the solution of a major
problem confronting the nation's
strike-torn cities, when moot court
convenes at 7:30 o'clock this evening
in Room 12. Spectators will be wel
comed.
From San Francisco, long a seat of
violent labor unrest, Attorney Rob
ert Littler will come to this campus
to sit as Chief Justice in the first of
this year's law school trials. One of
the bay city's foremost authorities in
labor controversies, Mr. Littler will
pass judgment on a question which
he may be called upon to contest in
the federal appelate courts in the
near future.
TONIGHT S PROBLEM
The problem before the court to
night will be to decide the legality
of indiscriminate picketing of inde
pendent merchants by labor union
forces. Briefs have been presented
by Sam Thurman and Dean Mitchell,
opposed by Andy Spears and Dave

Folsom, and their verbal arguments
will be heard in this evening's ses
sion. Two other law school men will
be chosen to sit as associate justices
on the judicial board.
The three cases scheduled for re
view the first three evenings of this
week will begin a series of trials on
current undecided legal issues,
which culminates next spring in a
cash award to the University's out
standing law student.
SECOND TRIAL
A second case will be presented
tomorrow night by a different group
of students, with Mr. Garrett El
more, Palo Alto attorney, as head
of the judicial board. The contro
versy will involve the management
of a theater which refused to deliver
a Bank Night prize to the holder of
the winning ticket.
Court will convene at 7:30 o'clock
tonight, tomorrow, and Wednesday.
The sessions will last about two
hours and the campus is welcome to
attend.
