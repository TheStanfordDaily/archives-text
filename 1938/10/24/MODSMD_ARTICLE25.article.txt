# NEW UTOPIA PROMISED IN U.C.L.A. PLAN
## $30-a-Week Miracle Out-Zanied by Play 
### 
Out-zanying the "$3O-a-week '
pension plan on the California No- j
vember ballot, the "Grade A Pen- ]
sion Plan" hit the U.C.LA. campus j
last week with promises of a new
Utopia.
Founders of the bottle-top pension
plan for people from zero to fifty was
Bill Brown, editor of The Daily
Bruin, and Bob Schiller, columnist.
Initiated as a satire on the "$3O
- plan, the scheme
proposes to pay everybody from
zero to fifty, or vice versa, $50 ev
ery Friday—in Grade A milk bottle
tops.
MILK TOPS GIVEN
According to the founders of the !
plan, a Utopian campus will be I
fostered by the new milk-top prem- j
iums—"diamond studded sidewalks, j
champagne and caviar served daily j
in the Co-op in exchange for half j
a milk-bottle top: tuition fees pay- ;
able in milk-bottle caps."
Membership cards and buttons,!
plus the sample milk-bottle tops, j
were being sold on campus through
out the week. On the buttons were |
printed, "Caviar and Champagne—
It's the tops," and the member's j
name under the title of the provi
sion: "Grade A Pension Plan."
AUTHORS UPHOLD IDEA
According to the reasoning of
Schiller and Brown, the "Grade A"
plan has as much to commend it as
the butt of their jest, the $30-every-
Thursday amendment.
Devoting several issues almost!
exclusively to their plan, The Daily I
Bruin in mock seriousness consid- 1
ered the plan from every angle, de
clared, tongue-in-cheek, that it was 1
"economically sound" and "not ecu- ;
nomically unsound."
Efforts were being made to spread
the Grade A Pension Plan to other
campuses, and to arouse public
opinion against its actual counter
part, the 30-a-week scheme.
