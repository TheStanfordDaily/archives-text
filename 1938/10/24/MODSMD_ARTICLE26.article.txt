# Farley Demands New Deal Triumph

### 
BOSTON. Oct. 23 (UP).—Chair
man James A. Farley of the Demo
cratic National, Committee, tonight
called for a New Deal triumph at the
November 8 election to prevent "di
vided councils in the nation in the
midst of the grave crisis in world
affairs."
Farley, in a speech prepai-ed for
delivery at a dinner of the Demo
cratic State Committee of Massa
chusetts, said President Roosevelt
must be "the issue" in forthcoming
elections because he is looked upon
throughout the world as "the one
national leader big enough and
brave entrugh and strong enough to
vindicate the processes of demo
cratic government.
"In these days of chaos and con
fusion throughout the world, when
civilization itself is imperiled by the
mad ambitions of ruthless dictators,
let the message flash from the No
vember polls that the American
people are united in a common
cause—the cause of democracy and
all the people—and they are deter
mined to go forward under the most
statesmanlike leadership in the world
today, the leadership of Franklin D.
Roosevelt," Farley said.
