# CAMPUS OPINION
## NEW TRACK STADIUM 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
After such a successful campaign
for a new boathouse, the Daily
might familiarize itself with an even
greater necessity—a stadium for An
gell Field. Stanford has one of the
best in the country, but it can only
be used for unimportant meets and
practice—quite a waste. In the esti
mates submitted by A1 Masters the
figure of $30,000 was set as the cost
of a stadium.
You naturally wonder why the
football stadium cannot be used'. If
you were a member of the track
squad and ever attempted to run
on the track, the answer would be
quite evident; it is a mere "wind
tunnel." The wind which blows
down the straightaway and against
the runners is quite a handicap to
any runner. You ugain say that the
wind is as much a handicap to the
opposition as to Stanford, but let
!us examine the Stanford problem.
Stanford's numbers are very few, and
it is necessary for the runners to
double up their events to two and
three events. To run a mile and two
mile is in itself quite a problem; but
to compete against a wind in those
two events is almost an impossibil
ity. This wind has its affect upon
every track event as well as most
field events, yet, Stanford does noth
ing to co-operate with its track
teams which, although shallow in
numbers but strong in individual
stars, can never hope to be suc
cessful against such a handicap as
the Stanford "wind-tunnel."
The Board of Athletic Control*
readily admits that a stadium i$ nec
essary and only a matter of time,
why do not the members reason out
the problem and construct a stadium
this year—a year when Stanford's
track team has its greatest opportu
! nity to defeat any team in the coun
try. R.W.

The Editor, Sir:
We OBJECT! Why must any
reflection be cast on the Class of '42,
because of the hysteria of last year's
Robleites The accusation of John
Cobbs has nothing whatsoever to
do with us. Until his column ap
peared in the Daily, we knew noth
ing at all about the situation. If you
would look deeper into the matter,
we believe you will find it is not
the girls that are objecting—We are
all 100 per cent behind you!
Here's to BIGGER and BETTER
BONFIRES!

greater necessity—a stadium for An
gell Field. Stanford has one of the
best in the country, but it can only
be used for unimportant meets and
practice—quite a waste. In the esti
mates submitted by A1 Masters the
figure of $30,000 was set as the cost
of a stadium.
You naturally wonder why the
football stadium cannot be used'. If
you were a member of the track
squad and ever attempted to run
on the track, the answer would be
quite evident; it is a mere "wind
tunnel." The wind which blows
down the straightaway and against
the runners is quite a handicap to
any runner. You ugain say that the
wind is as much a handicap to the
opposition as to Stanford, but let
!us examine the Stanford problem.
Stanford's numbers are very few, and
it is necessary for the runners to
double up their events to two and
three events. To run a mile and two
mile is in itself quite a problem; but
to compete against a wind in those
two events is almost an impossibil
ity. This wind has its affect upon
every track event as well as most
field events, yet, Stanford does noth
ing to co-operate with its track
teams which, although shallow in
numbers but strong in individual
stars, can never hope to be suc
cessful against such a handicap as
the Stanford "wind-tunnel."
The Board of Athletic Control*
readily admits that a stadium i$ nec
essary and only a matter of time,
why do not the members reason out
the problem and construct a stadium
this year—a year when Stanford's
track team has its greatest opportu
! nity to defeat any team in the coun
try. R.W.

The Editor, Sir:
We OBJECT! Why must any
reflection be cast on the Class of '42,
because of the hysteria of last year's
Robleites The accusation of John
Cobbs has nothing whatsoever to
do with us. Until his column ap
peared in the Daily, we knew noth
ing at all about the situation. If you
would look deeper into the matter,
we believe you will find it is not
the girls that are objecting—We are
all 100 per cent behind you!
Here's to BIGGER and BETTER
