# MOVE ON

The Editor, Sir:
As a Campus Opinion I should
like to make a suggestion which
might somewhat decrease the pre
vailing traffic congestion at the Post
Office corner (in spite of the wid
ened streets). If those persons who
park in the streets around the Post
Office would read their mail some
where other than in their cars, it
would give other people a chance to
park—get their mail—and move on.
Undoubtedly these "car readers" are
very anxious to discover the con
tents of their mail, but there are also
many other per-sons just as anxious
to have the opportunity of conve
niently calling for their mail.
