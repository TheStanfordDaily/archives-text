# Young Indian Gridders Beat Brubabes
## Papooses In Fourth Win; Uclans Fall Unbeaten Frosh Whip Young Bruins, 31-0 On Southland Turf 
### 
Stanford's Papoose gridders
romped to their fourth straight vic
tory of the reason last Saturday
when they easily trounced the
U.C.L.A. yearlings, 31 -0, in the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
Coach Norman Duncan's Brubabes
were allegedly pointing for an upset
over the Cards, but didn't even come
close to giving the winners a good
fight. The Card secondary stopped
Ucla's pass attack dead, while the
Stanford line made mincemeat of the
Bruin frosh's running attack.
START EARLY PUSH
The Papooses started early to push
the porkhide through to touchdown
territory, but every drive bogged
down during the first quarter. How
ever, in the second period, Coach
Harry Shipkey's team really got
down to business.
Frankie Albert pushed over the
first score early in the second quar
ter, when he packed the ball across
from the four-yard line, after he and
Pete Kmetovic had alternated in the
ball-carrying role to place it at that
spot.
Shortly after, Albert ran a punt
back to the U.C.L.A. 30, tossed two
straight successful passes, and the
Cards had another score. Paul Blan
ton nabbed Albert's short spiral for
the touchdown. Albert converted
both scores.
ALBERT'S FIELD GOAL
Once again the Cards started har
assing the Brubabe goal, but had to
be content with a field goal by Al
bert from 25 yards out, as the U.C.
L.A. defense stiffened.
After a scoreless third quarter, the
Papooses tallied two more touch
downs in the final period. Albert
flipped a pass to Jack Francis for
one of them, and the other came on
a 28-yard aerial from Art Rasmus
sen to Bill Glundberg, sub fullback
and end, respectively.
