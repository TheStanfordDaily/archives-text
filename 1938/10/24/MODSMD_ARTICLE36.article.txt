# Soccer Squad Takes U.S.F. By 3-1 Score
## Cards Prove Strong In Defense, Offense; Frosh Tilt Cancelled 
### 
Coming through in the pinches to
score one goal in the first quarter
and one more in each of the last two
periods, the Card varsity soccer team
out-gunned a rough, tough squad
from San Fran«sco University three
to one Saturday morning at the
Stanford soccer field in the Indians'
third conference game of the season.
Over on the frosh field, the Pa
pooses received a message shortly
before game time that their rivals
from Galileo high school would be
unable to arrive for the scheduled
tilt. The frosh were divided into two
squads and held an impromptu in
ter-squad conflict.
FIRST QUARTER SCORE
For ten minutes of the varsity
game both teams showed an excel
lent brand of defensive soccer, both
keeping their rivals from close shots
at goal.
The first Stanford tally came
shortly after that time, when the
Indians converted a corner kick into
a goal when Cuthbertson's brilliant
pass from deep in S.F.U. territory
was deflected into the net by Chris
Santum.
S.F. STARTS ATTACK
After the score the invading team
countered with a desperate attempt
to tie the count. The S.F.U. attack
kept the ball in Stanford territory
throughout the rest of the quarter,
but brilliant work by the Indian
backs and several fine saves
goalie Rudy Munser kept the in
vaders from scoring.
Taking the offensive from the start
of the second period, the Cards car
ried the fight deep toward the enemy
goal during the entire quarter. Only
once did the boys from San Fran
cisco manage to steal the ball and
attack, and during that one time a
penalty kick was awarded them
forty feet from goal. The shot was
made good by Renzo Quilici, bril
liant S.F.U. center forward, to tie
the score at one all.
CARDS TAKE LEAD
No score was made by either team
during the third quarter, with the
Cards carrying the offensive work,
but failing on many close shots for
goal. At least four tallies were
missed from a close distance.
With the count still knotted at one
all in the first minute of the fourth
and final period, Stanford was
awarded a penalty shot thirty feet
from the S.F.U. goal. The try was
given to Gunther Gerbstedt, who
booted a beautiful kick that was
good, giving the Indians a one-point
lead that was never headed.
GERBSTEDT SCORES
After a try for goal by Dißeneditti
was saved by the enemy goalkeeper,
Gerbstedt made the final score of the
day when he took a pass from Arra
smith and kicked it for a goal.
During the last half of the fourth
quarter Coach Harry Maloney sent
in many Card subs to see if the
wavering S.F.U. defenses could be
shattered for more points, but al
though the Indians kept the offen
sive, no scores were made.

before game time that their rivals
from Galileo high school would be
unable to arrive for the scheduled
tilt. The frosh were divided into two
squads and held an impromptu in
ter-squad conflict.
FIRST QUARTER SCORE
For ten minutes of the varsity
game both teams showed an excel
lent brand of defensive soccer, both
keeping their rivals from close shots
at goal.
The first Stanford tally came
shortly after that time, when the
Indians converted a corner kick into
a goal when Cuthbertson's brilliant
pass from deep in S.F.U. territory
was deflected into the net by Chris
Santum.
S.F. STARTS ATTACK
After the score the invading team
countered with a desperate attempt
to tie the count. The S.F.U. attack
kept the ball in Stanford territory
throughout the rest of the quarter,
but brilliant work by the Indian
backs and several fine saves
goalie Rudy Munser kept the in
vaders from scoring.
Taking the offensive from the start
of the second period, the Cards car
ried the fight deep toward the enemy
goal during the entire quarter. Only
once did the boys from San Fran
cisco manage to steal the ball and
attack, and during that one time a
penalty kick was awarded them
forty feet from goal. The shot was
made good by Renzo Quilici, bril
liant S.F.U. center forward, to tie
the score at one all.
CARDS TAKE LEAD
No score was made by either team
during the third quarter, with the
Cards carrying the offensive work,
but failing on many close shots for
goal. At least four tallies were
missed from a close distance.
With the count still knotted at one
all in the first minute of the fourth
and final period, Stanford was
awarded a penalty shot thirty feet
from the S.F.U. goal. The try was
given to Gunther Gerbstedt, who
booted a beautiful kick that was
good, giving the Indians a one-point
lead that was never headed.
GERBSTEDT SCORES
After a try for goal by Dißeneditti
was saved by the enemy goalkeeper,
Gerbstedt made the final score of the
day when he took a pass from Arra
smith and kicked it for a goal.
During the last half of the fourth
quarter Coach Harry Maloney sent
in many Card subs to see if the
wavering S.F.U. defenses could be
shattered for more points, but al
though the Indians kept the offen
sive, no scores were made.
Coming through in the pinches to
score one goal in the first quarter
and one more in each of the last two
periods, the Card varsity soccer team
out-gunned a rough, tough squad
from San Fran«sco University three
to one Saturday morning at the
Stanford soccer field in the Indians'
third conference game of the season.
Over on the frosh field, the Pa
pooses received a message shortly
before game time that their rivals
from Galileo high school would be
unable to arrive for the scheduled
tilt. The frosh were divided into two
