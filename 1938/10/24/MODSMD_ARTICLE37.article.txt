The big Bruin from U.C.L.A. tried to down an extra large helping of
Coach Nort Thornton's latest Hungarian fish dish in the Encina pools last
Friday afternoon hut thero was more than the Bruin anticipated and he
went home at the short end of a 4-1 count.
With the help of some of the finest goal tending by Roy Vitousek ever
seen on the Farm, the Stanford team got ofT to a 4-0 lead in the open-

ing period to take its first confer-<
ence tilt of the season.
FUNCTION SMOOTHLY
The entire Card team functioned
smoothly and it is doubtful if the
Bruins could have made any head
way even if their ace forward, Dick
Norton, had been able to make the
trip from the South where he is ill
with an attack of pleurisy.
Big Ted Moreno, the sophomore
guard, turned in another bang-up
performance and gave indications
that he might become an outstand
ing guard in the conference.
Both Captain Johnny Lamb and
Harvey Rothschild scored and Jack
Loupe was good for two.
In the second half, Carl Dowling
went in for Vitousek and he was
equally brilliant in making seem
ingly impossible saves. Both Vitou
sek and Dowling made saves of pen
alty shots from the Bruin forwards
at close range.
FROSH WIN
Before the varsity took the pool,
Stanford's yearling team continued
unbeaten with a 12-9 triumph over
Sequoia High.
The first-stringers, led by Fred
Manwaring, a former Paly player,
and Had Bacon from San Mateo
rolled up a long lead in the opening
period, and the visitors were able to
score against the subs after the in
termission.
With practically every man on his
squad back in top shape after an epi
demic of colds during the past week,
Thornton said that he would hold
several tough scrimmages this week.
