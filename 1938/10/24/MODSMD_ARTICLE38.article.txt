### 
The Stanford fencing team was
outpointed by Funke's Fencing
Academy 19-6 in a bout held in
San Francisco Saturday night. Wool
ey was high point man for Stanford,
scoring 3 bouts. Cooper won 2 bouts,
Meyerhoft 1, and Chiamori and Bray
none.
Coach Elwyn Bugge said the Card
foilsmen were outclassed by their
more experienced rivals, two of
whom were former West Point men.
Wooley was the only Stanford man
with experience enough to make
a good showing, although Chiamori,
one of the sophomore members of
the team, showed definite promise.
Next Friday night the California
fencing team will come to the Farm
for the third bout in the Heron Tro
phy Match series. This match should
bring out Stanford's possibilities
against Cal in the big match next
spring.
