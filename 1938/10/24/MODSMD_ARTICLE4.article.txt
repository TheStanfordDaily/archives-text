# Off-Campus Student Labor Probe Planned
## Grad Co-op Homes Discussed by A.S.U. 
### 
An investigation of conditions ex
isting in places where Stanford stu
dents are employed off campus was
one of the decisions made at a meet
ing of the Stanford chapter of the
American Student Union in the
Women's Clubhouse last Thursday.
Bernie Firestone, president of the
University of California chapter,
was the principal speaker. Plans for
the coming year were discussed.
According to Stanford's president,
Gene Glasmann, a sub-committee
has already done some preliminary
work in an investigation of the labor
conditions.
At California, such an investiga
tion was carried out by the A.S.U. in
conjunction with a labor group se
lected from the student executive
committee of the university. As a
result, all businesses employing
California students were asked to
comply to standards set by the in
vestigating committee. "Fair Bear"
stickers were awarded to the places
that fulfilled the requirements.
Suggestions for the establishment
lof co-operative homes for gradu
late students were also considered at
J the meeting. Firestone related how
some 400 California students were
already living in co-operative
dorms.
