# Burglars Enter Two Fraternities
## 
### 
Sometime between 1:30 and 4
o'clock Saturday morning, a burglar i
broke into Delta Tau Delta and stole
a total of thirty-five dollars from
the wallets of seven members, ac
cording to Gordy Davis, campus cop.
The thief walked in and out of the
unlocked house without being de
tected, so that the police have no
clue to work on.
A prowler entered Theta Delta
Chi at 3 o'clock Sunday morning,
but left abruptly when Frank Hoo
per awoke when the intruder opened
his door. Hooper dashed out into )
the hall but found the prowler had 1
escaped.
"Any time a prowler is detected I
or any emergency arises, a police j
car can be summoned by telephon- i
ing 3131," Davis said yesterday. |
"This car will go to the Palo Alto |
police station which will send the
message over the radio transmitter
to the campus radio police car which
is on duty twenty-four hours a day." (

Dartmouth, who will tangle with
Stanford at Thanksgiving, has an ■
imposing record. They didn't lose 1
any games last year and they lost j
only four players. The Dartmouth
folks are figuring on special trains
'n everything out to the Farm this
November.
