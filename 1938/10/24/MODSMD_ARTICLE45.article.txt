STANFORD lost a football game last Saturday,
and saw a fine team lose it.
At about this time, the football men are prob
ably as low in morale as they will ever be or
ever have been. The campus is low because it's
seen its chances for a Rose Bowl trip take
wing and start for the open end of the stadium.
But in the two hours it took to lose the S.C.
game, Stanfordites saw their football team fight
its heart out. They saw it meet the Trojans on
better than even terms during the first half.
During the second half, they saw a team that
was so tired it didn't know what to do, a team
with its head against a stone wall, a team that
couldn't get anywhere.
Players came up with fists swinging, for as
a team they were outplayed, but as individuals
they still had the spirit which should have made
them click.
Over the week-end, apologies and excuses
for the Farm's showing against Troy have
dropped on the Pacific Coast like yesterday's
first fall rain drops.
Those excuses, however, come from those
who are always quick to jump off any ship
with water in its hold. They come from those
least needed by Stanford as supporters, for
Stanford knows that it has a football team that
can go down to defeat battling all the way to
the bottom.—H. L. S.
