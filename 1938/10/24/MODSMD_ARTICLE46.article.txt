REMINISCENT of Princeton's "Veterans of Fu
ture Wars" a year or so back is U.C.L.A.'s
round-house swing at the "$3O-Every-Thurs--
day" proposal to be voted on in the November
election (see second page).
The methods used to attack the maddest po
litical idea ever to come out of Southern Cali
fornia are of the most obvious sort: they have
to be. It is too plain that the minds which con
ceived the pension plan and those that believe
in it can hardly be touched by cold logic.
And though the "Grade A Plan" may not do
much to fight the screw-ball amendment, it is a
step in the right direction. Just as the Pension
ers use a dash of religion, good old historical
hokum, and a plea to "remembah ouah Moth
ahs," so should Anti-Pensioners be allowed to
attack the unsound scheme with every weapon
at their command—from reason based on expe
rience to simple, blunt invective.
The "Grade A Plan" should arouse the ire of
all supporters of the State Pension Plan. The
most emotional will see a satire of their most
cherished dream—a cold 30 stones dropping
like manna. The most logical—under the lim
its, of course, of actual political and economic
sense—will shelter their Pension Plan under
the wing of the complaint that "well, something
must be done." They may be partially right:
the Thirty Thursday plan does point out a need
for some provision for California's aged popu
lation.
But when you tell the supporters of the plan
that it is absurd to grab up the first thing handy
just because something is needed, they are off
on a speech taken from the files of Father
Divine.
Along with the Thirty Thursday plan comes
the biggest razzberry to a state government that
has ever been blubbered.
So far only U.C.L.A.'s "Grade A Plan" has
been a loud enough bird to out-razzberry the
Pensioners.
