V V That's the only reason Campus Officer
Burns can give for the small number of acci
dents which occur along car-jammed Lasuen.
And it's a reason which doesn't take into ac
count the way in which sharp-shooters can turn
into helpless victims of their own marksman
ship in something under a second when things
go wrong.
Because house members on the right side of
the Row persist in over-parking an already
crowded street, the danger from accidents along
Lasuen is probably five times as great as it is
anywhere else on the campus. Overtaxed as
an artery of traffic under normal conditions,
and further cluttered by the übiquitous Palo
Alto Transit, the street becomes at times little
more than a crash-trap.
Because Assistant Comptroller Trowbridge,
responsible for roads and maintenance, is away
on a three weeks' vacation, the Administration
is powerless at the moment to do anything
about the problem. But nothing stands in the
way of concerted action by the fraternities
which are the chief offenders.
Behind the houses on the right side of the
Row is an alley, already used to some extent

lor parking. Wide enough to accommodate a
number of cars with safety at some points, at
others it is as dangerously congested as La
suen itself. The logical place for overflow
parking, it needs only widening to make it
completely satisfactory.
At present that widening cannot come from
the Administration. If it is to be done within
a reasonable time—perhaps if it is to be done
at all—it will have to be done by the Row.
A sophomore work-day, perhaps, plus a ban
on parking along that side of Lasuen—that
might be enough to solve the difficulty. It
wouldn't take very much time and not too much
effort; and it would remove one of the most
persistent of all campus annoyances.—A. S. D.
