### JOHN COBBS 
SURPRISE
/ *NE of the beloved brethren eased over beside me
at breakfast the other morning, splashed coffee
down my neck, and installed his plate next to mine.
He laid his Daily carefully over the comic page I was
reading and opened the conversation cheerily.
"Say, what the hell's the idea of cramming that
column of yours with stuff about the state elections'
Why don't you write about something that affects
Stanford?"
Breakfast is not a time for patient explanation.
And so dismissing him with a short, growl, I resumed
my flank attack on a couple of fried eggs which were
offering determined resistance. The brother went off,
tenderly carrying with him the conviction that any
thing which happens outside of our academic play-pen
cannot possibly be of importance to us.

Probably half the Stanford students share with him
the trusteeship' of that idea. We are accustomed to
speak slightingly of the ostrich because the bird hides
its head in the sand and kicks with aimless enthusiasm.
But it would be hard to find a better illustration of a
typical Stanford behavior pattern.
On the November state ballot are two measures at
least which may mean more to Stanford than the
Founding Grant. They are the Thirty Thursday amend
ment and the anti-vivisectionist bill.

'T'HE Ham and Eggs amendment, which states that
hereinafter all miracles shall be required by law
to come true, could put the University in the worst
financial mess since the government made a grab for
the trust fund. Stanford is on excellent terms with
the sheriff just at the moment, but in the general
economic melee which could come with the Thirty
Thursday system, we might easily find ourselves evicted
and our heirlooms dumped in the middle of El
Camino.
But even if we managed to keep from being stab
bed in the back in the financial free-for-all, the stu
dent body would have an interesting time playing tag
with the new price level. Students with money set
aside would find it inadequate to meet the new infla
tion. Students on fixed incomes would find them run
ning a poor second to the rising house bills.
The effects of the anti-vivisectionist law would be
less striking, but they would be just as hard on the
trustees' blood pressure. One of Stanford's prides is
the med school. And if experiment and demonstra
tion were made illegal, the med school would vanish
in a puff of smoke.
The idea is surprising, but I cannot avoid the con
clusion that the November election may be as import
ant to Stanford as the Union prices or the disposition
of the freshmen women.
