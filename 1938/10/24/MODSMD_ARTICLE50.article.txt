# Lightly... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
A BOUT 2000 of them came up for the game, they
say, and some of them were right out of Holly
wood. The blondes, I mean. They didn't get that way
in Exposition Park.
Our (Women's Editor) told me that if I ever put
(her) name in this column again, I would hear from
(her). But is it my fault that one of these blondes
picked (her) to talk to in one of (her) Friday classes?
Quite by accident our (Women's Editor) was sit
ting next to an S.C. blonde who had gone to a Stan
ford class for reasons which only she would know but
which she would have confessed at the drop of the
hat to anyone who looked like he would listen.
(Our Women's Editor) had hardly sat down when
the blonde asked her, "Do you have a mirror?" (She)
didn't have a mirror. "Don't any Stanford women
carry mirrors and rnakc-up to class?" the blonde
asked. "How astonishing."
The blonde settled back to listen to Ihe lecture.
That didn't last for long. She turned to (my friend)
and asked, "Is my make-up on straight."
"Yes," (my friend) didn't answer, "all three layers."
There were two men sitting in front of the blonde.
The blonde pointed to the better looking one and
asked, "Is he in a house?"
"I really don't know. I don't know him."
"Really," said the blonde.
"How about the other one?" the blonde asked a
little later.
"Yes, he's in a house."
That, thought the blonde, is more like it. Pretty
soon she asked, "Do you live in a sorority?"
"No," (my friend) answered.
From then on the blonde froze up. She spent the
rest of the hour making and re-making her face in
grim silence.

A LOT of funny things happened in the rooting sec
tion Saturday. Those yell-leaders were pretty fun
ny. They did funny things, even, to the Axe Yell.
And at one time U.S.C. was being penalized 15
yards for holding. While the referee was pacing it off.
Turner leaned lethargically against the microphone
while his two assistants led the rooting section in
counting his steps.
The caustic comment that came from the stands
in back of me was, "Well, at leastt hey have taught
them how to count."

Friday I printed a story in this column about Pro
fessor !■ agan. It is only fair for me to say that the
story was entirely false. I got a poor story from an
unreliable informant -and hutched the story besides.
Dr. Fagan proved to me Friday afternoon that the
story is entirely false.
He also gave me a neat lesson in economics.

asked. "How astonishing."
The blonde settled back to listen to Ihe lecture.
That didn't last for long. She turned to (my friend)
and asked, "Is my make-up on straight."
"Yes," (my friend) didn't answer, "all three layers."
There were two men sitting in front of the blonde.
The blonde pointed to the better looking one and
asked, "Is he in a house?"
"I really don't know. I don't know him."
"Really," said the blonde.
"How about the other one?" the blonde asked a
little later.
"Yes, he's in a house."
That, thought the blonde, is more like it. Pretty
soon she asked, "Do you live in a sorority?"
"No," (my friend) answered.
From then on the blonde froze up. She spent the
rest of the hour making and re-making her face in
grim silence.

A LOT of funny things happened in the rooting sec
tion Saturday. Those yell-leaders were pretty fun
ny. They did funny things, even, to the Axe Yell.
And at one time U.S.C. was being penalized 15
yards for holding. While the referee was pacing it off.
Turner leaned lethargically against the microphone
while his two assistants led the rooting section in
counting his steps.
The caustic comment that came from the stands
in back of me was, "Well, at leastt hey have taught
them how to count."

Friday I printed a story in this column about Pro
fessor !■ agan. It is only fair for me to say that the
story was entirely false. I got a poor story from an
unreliable informant -and hutched the story besides.
Dr. Fagan proved to me Friday afternoon that the
story is entirely false.
He also gave me a neat lesson in economics.
A BOUT 2000 of them came up for the game, they
say, and some of them were right out of Holly
wood. The blondes, I mean. They didn't get that way
in Exposition Park.
Our (Women's Editor) told me that if I ever put
(her) name in this column again, I would hear from
(her). But is it my fault that one of these blondes
picked (her) to talk to in one of (her) Friday classes?
Quite by accident our (Women's Editor) was sit
ting next to an S.C. blonde who had gone to a Stan
ford class for reasons which only she would know but
which she would have confessed at the drop of the
hat to anyone who looked like he would listen.
(Our Women's Editor) had hardly sat down when
the blonde asked her, "Do you have a mirror?" (She)
didn't have a mirror. "Don't any Stanford women
carry mirrors and rnakc-up to class?" the blonde
asked. "How astonishing."
The blonde settled back to listen to Ihe lecture.
That didn't last for long. She turned to (my friend)
and asked, "Is my make-up on straight."
