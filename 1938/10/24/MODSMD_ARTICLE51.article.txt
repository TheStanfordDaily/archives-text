# Tracy Miscast As Reformer In "Boys Town"
## 
### 
"BOY'S TOWN," currently play
ing at the Fox-Stanford and star
ring Spencer Tracy and Mickey
Itooney:
This picture is about Father Flan
agan, who sets out to rehabilitate
little guttersnipes — to provide food
and shelter and decent care for the
kids who roam the streets and get

booked for petty
larceny and dis
turbing the peace.
Admittedly a no
fa 1 e background
for a picture —
this mission of
Father Flanagan—
and frankly a
stuffy one. As in
so many altruistic
attempts, pungen
cy of dialogue
goes on the block
for pulpit bunk,
dramatic value for

high purpose. All in all, "Boy's
Town" is once removed—and only
once—from the public-minded "trip
through-a-fig-Newton-factory" films
you used to sluff assemblies on.
Now any time at all I'm ready to
beat the tub for Tracy. Out of the
gruff, sullen, and honest man he has
created a valid cinematype, and I
like the character. But Father
Flanagan is one portrayal he fum
bles. He's not used to looking cheer
ful for an hour and a half at a
stretch and a hesitancy and tenta
tiveness result from his being out of
his class. However, this much can
be said for him, unlike Humphrey
Bogart, who also recently came to
haif-nelsons with the devil in little
boys, Tracy is not a thug in scout
pants. And sometimes, even in this
picture, you get the impression that
the only real difference between the
bum in "Man's Castle" and Father
Flanagan is the way the latter wears
his collar.
Mickey Rooney cops every scene
in which he turns up. Not only well
cast as the swaggering, obnoxious
brat of "Boy's Town" but the best
upstager of the lot, Rooney is re
sponsible for whatever salt goes into
a pretty insipid dish.

a pretty insipid dish.
