## Chiang Kai-shek Resignation Reports Persist in Shanghai 
### 
SHANGHAI, Tuesday, Oct. 25
(UP). â€” Japan today again defied
Britain and the United States to
stop her conquest of China and in
tensified her attacks on China's pro
visional national capital in Hankow,
which was expected to be captured
before nightfall.
The Japanese were confident that
major Chinese organized resistance
was broken and they need only to
deliver final knockout blows to win
a clear-cut victory in their 15-
months - old war with Nationalist
China.
It was persistently reported in
Shanghai, Hong Kong and elsewhere
that China's war-time dictator, Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-shek, cither 1
has resigned or is about to resign and
the Chinese Nationalist government
would be reorganized under men
with whom the Japanese would be
content to make peace.
BRITAIN PROTESTS
Britain delivered vigorous pro
tests to the Japanese against yester
day's bombing of the British gun
boat Sandpiper, near Chengsha,
south of Hankow, while Japanese
planes were attacking junks on
which Chinese soldiers were re
treating from the Hankow front.
The Japanese, however, showed
no disposition to make hasty apolo
gies and offer indemnities such as
they paid when they sank the U.S.
gunboat Panay last December. Brit
ish naval authorities asserted the
Sandpiper was attacked deliberately
but the Japanese denied this and
were "investigating."
SILVER DUMPED
The U.S. Dollar Line steamer
President Coolidge was sailing for
the United States after the Japanese
had forced unloading of a shipment
of silver valued at $4,500,000 con
signed to New York thrbugh the
National City Bank of New York's
Shanghai branch by the Chinese Na
tionalists.
The case had been referred to
Washington but there was every in
dication the Japanese - controlled
Central China government in Nan
king would enforce its regulations
against silver exports and claim the
big shipment as "the property of the
Chinese people."
