# San Francisco Lawyer Judges Moot Court
## 
### 
With a brillaint San Francisco attorney cracking the ring-master's
whip, two pairs of Stanford law school students jumped through verbal
loops last night, to the enjoyment of the four score court-room spectators
attending the opening moot-court trial.
Another set of student counsellors prepared to take the floor tonight,
to determine whether a theater is required by law to pay to the eligible

â–ºwinner the bank night prizes of
fered. This case will be drawn from
a controversy in which a theater
goer, after drawing the lucky tick
et, was refused a prize of $200, on
grounds the drawing was in viola
j tion of the state lottery law.
In the initial trial last night, the
| State of Utah stepped into the lime-
I light as Sam Thurman and Dean
Mitchell, recent transfers from the
University there, made an impres
sive showing against Andy Spears
and Dave Folsom.
Sharp questioning by Attorney
Robert Littler, acting as Chief Jus
tice, lent considerable color to a
question of current interest. The
court decided that in the case of a
labor union picketing an independ
! ent merchant, who has no employ
| ees, or agreement with the union,
the federal courts can give no pro
tection to the merchant wohse busi
ness is injured.
This decision upheld the view of
the law supported by Spears and
Folsom. The accolade for the best
presentation and argument was
i given them by a very narrow mar
i gin-
The women students in the school
will step into action tonight while
Attorney Garrett Elmore presides
over the court. Marian Leachman
and W. D. Ackerman, Jr., will op
pose Adele Morgan and Bob Adams
on the bank night question.
