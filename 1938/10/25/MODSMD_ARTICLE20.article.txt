Frank Lippman, Quad editor, re
ceived word last night from the Na
tional Scholastic Press Association
that the 1938 Stanford Quad has
been given All-American Honor Rat
ingâ€”Superior. The book was edited
by George McKenna.
The book's general plan, the pho
tography, and the athletic section
have been termed excellent by Fred
Kildow, director of the national as-
I sociation.
Each section of the book was
j judged separately, with emphasis on
I content and organization, and some
! consideration was given the quality
of the mechanical set-up. The rating
! was competitive, books from col
; leges throughout the country being
I entered. Football action photos re
! ccived special attention and extra
! credit was given the book for the
informal photos.
