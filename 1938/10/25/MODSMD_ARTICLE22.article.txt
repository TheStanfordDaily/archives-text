# Senator Stanford's Italian Godson Reminisces
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
March 13, 1884. In the Grand
Hotel beside the Arno in Florence
Leland Stanford, Jr., was dying. His
mother stood by the bed. gazing at
him with eyes full of grief and ter
ror; the stock, heavy figure of his
father leaned against the frame of
the door.
When the doctor announced that
the boy's heart had stopped, Leland
Stanford opened the door, stumbled
across the outer room and into his
own chamber, where he fell almost
senseless upon the bed.
At the same moment, in a tall, nar
row house in one of Florence's ob
scure cobble-stoned streets, a son
was born to Signor Rizzi, courier to
the Stanford family during their
tour of the Continent. He was
waiting outside of the bedroom when
the news was brought to him by his
sister.
Quickly he dashed down the rick
ety, winding stairs, and started down
the street toward the Amo. He was
happy with his new son. and now he

wanted to learn how the son of Lc
land Stanford, his employer and
benefactor, was progressing.
TOO LATE
Rizzi walked briskly, .silently over
the streets, which for several blocks
around the hotel had boon covered
with straw by the management in
order that no sound should dislurb
Lcland, Jr. At the entrance to the
Stanfords' suite a nun told him, "You
arc too late."
The couricr begged to be admit
ted to sec Governor Stanford, but
he was told that his employer was in
no condition to see anyone. How
ever, late that evening Rizzi returned
and talked to Stanford, comforted
him with bits of simple philosophy.
And then, when there was a pause
in the conversation, he said, "Signor
Stanford, my wife, she had her baby
today. Would you â€” please, would
you be God father?"
The bearded head was raised from
the powerful chcst on which it had
been resting, Stanford smiled sadly,
and answered, "I'll be glad to, Rizzi,

and it would make me happy if you
would name the child Leland after
our boy."
RIZZI TODAY
In 1938 Leland Rizzi is a charm
ing, optimistic Tuscan gentleman
who owns a bar next door to the
American Express in Florence. To
many Americans who come in for a
coke, a rare treat in Italy at 25 cents,
he tells the story of how he got. his
name. But for me, he unearthed
fragments of his father's recollec
tions of Leland Stanford.
"A very rich man," he said, "but
kind to everybody, understanding,
and so wonderfully democratic." He
nodded vigorously, "Democratic men
are rare in Italy; most Americans
who travel here are not that way.
But my father always said that Sig
nor Stanford was at home in any
company and everybody's friend."
"You know, when Signor and
Signora Stanford went back to
Paris, my f.ither sent the body of
Leland, Jr., to America. He was
always telling me how brave Signora

Stanford was when her son died.''
Lcland Rizzi told me that that was
all he could remember. His father
was buried with his memories of
the founder of the University dur
ing the War.
COKES AT LELANI) BAR
About once in every three years
a graduate or a student of Stanford
arrives at Lcland Bar (that's what
Rizzi has named it), and most of
them ask him very few questions.
He can't understand how even
these few people know that, his
name has any connection with Lc
land Stanford, Jr.; it's just idle cu
riosity that brings it out most of
the time.
I walked with Lcland Rizzi along
the river to the side of the Grand
Hotel where the Class of 07 has had
engraved in stone in Italian:
"To the Memory of Lcland Stan
ford. Jr.. who died in this house the
thirteenth of March, 1884, and in
homage to the University which
bears his name, the class of the year
1907 places this memorial." '
