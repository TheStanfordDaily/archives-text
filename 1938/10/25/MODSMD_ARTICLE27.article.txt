# Television Talk Set for Tonight
## Lecturer Says New Developments Will Not Threaten Movies, Radio 
### 
"Television lias at last come 'around the corner'," declares Donald K.
Lippincott, radio engineering authority, who tonight will discuss "What
Is Television" in a lecture of the Tuesday Evening Series in Memorial
Hall auditorium at 7:.'M) o'clock.
"Two stations in Philadelphia, operating under experimental licenses,
are at present broadcasting regular television programs on an experi-

mental basis," explains Mr. Lippin
cott, who reveals that plans for tele
vision broadcasts from the New York
World's Fair next spring are now
being considered.
Presenting a brief outline of the
history of the industry, dating from
the first electrical transmission of
pictures in 1848 to the present-day
status of television, with its success
ful broadcasts and demonstrations,
the speaker, a director of Farns
worth Television, Inc., will explain
the various problems and factors
controlling commercialization of the
invention.
MOVIES NOT MENACED
The popularly-held theory that the
development of television will vir
tually eliminate motion pictures is
exploded by Mr. Lippincott, who be
lieves that the opposite effect will
result.
"Television will undoubtedly aid
the film industry," explains the en
gineer, "for the projection of movies
on regular television programs will
open a vast new field to the prod
ucts of Hollywood, although this
procedure may hurt the private ex
hibitors."
Predictions concerning the "com
monplace as radio" possibilities of
television sets could not be made by
Mr. Lippincott, a member of both
the Institute of Radio Engineers and
the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, who explained that "we
cannot foretell how long it will take
for television to become as wide
spread as is radio."
WILL AID HADIO
Indicating that television and ra
dio will be able to exist side by side
with each other and dispelling the
rumor that the invention would
practically kill the radio industry,
the expert declares that "television
will act as a complement to radio,
and will not supersede it."
A graduate of the University of
California, where he received his
electrical engineering degree in 1914,
Mr. Lippincott has been engaged in
radio and television research work
and has served as a development en
gineer for the past 14 years.
Formerly connected with the
Magnavox Company as chief engi
neer, the speaker has been engaged
as a patent attorney in the field of
television for more than 11 years.

status of television, with its success
ful broadcasts and demonstrations,
the speaker, a director of Farns
worth Television, Inc., will explain
the various problems and factors
controlling commercialization of the
invention.
MOVIES NOT MENACED
The popularly-held theory that the
development of television will vir
tually eliminate motion pictures is
exploded by Mr. Lippincott, who be
lieves that the opposite effect will
result.
"Television will undoubtedly aid
the film industry," explains the en
gineer, "for the projection of movies
on regular television programs will
open a vast new field to the prod
ucts of Hollywood, although this
procedure may hurt the private ex
hibitors."
Predictions concerning the "com
monplace as radio" possibilities of
television sets could not be made by
Mr. Lippincott, a member of both
the Institute of Radio Engineers and
the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, who explained that "we
cannot foretell how long it will take
for television to become as wide
spread as is radio."
WILL AID HADIO
Indicating that television and ra
dio will be able to exist side by side
with each other and dispelling the
rumor that the invention would
practically kill the radio industry,
the expert declares that "television
will act as a complement to radio,
and will not supersede it."
A graduate of the University of
California, where he received his
electrical engineering degree in 1914,
Mr. Lippincott has been engaged in
radio and television research work
and has served as a development en
gineer for the past 14 years.
Formerly connected with the
Magnavox Company as chief engi
neer, the speaker has been engaged
as a patent attorney in the field of
television for more than 11 years.
"Television lias at last come 'around the corner'," declares Donald K.
Lippincott, radio engineering authority, who tonight will discuss "What
Is Television" in a lecture of the Tuesday Evening Series in Memorial
Hall auditorium at 7:.'M) o'clock.
"Two stations in Philadelphia, operating under experimental licenses,
are at present broadcasting regular television programs on an experi-

mental basis," explains Mr. Lippin
cott, who reveals that plans for tele
vision broadcasts from the New York
World's Fair next spring are now
being considered.
Presenting a brief outline of the
history of the industry, dating from
the first electrical transmission of
pictures in 1848 to the present-day
status of television, with its success
ful broadcasts and demonstrations,
the speaker, a director of Farns
worth Television, Inc., will explain
the various problems and factors
controlling commercialization of the
invention.
