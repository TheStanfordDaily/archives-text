# Students at Rikkio Like Swing, Cokes
## 
### VIC ROWLAND 
First quarter in April! No social
fraternities! Only one "ex" to a
course!
A "triple threat" campaign for The
Daily's editorial columns? No, just
facts about a modern university. Its
name is Rikkio. located in Tokyo,
Japan.
There, men are never seen with
women in public dance halls, the
favorite sport is baseball, there is
absolutely no drinking, and less than
10 per cent are "working their way
through," either wholly or partially.
And yet swing, cokes, cigarettes,
movies, radios, and flivvers are as
popular and commonplace at Rikkio
as here on the Farm.
TRANSFER STUDENT
Such is the assurance of 25-year
old Kiyonao Okami, senior transfer
from the foreign university, who is
experiencing his first quarter of
American schooling at Stanford this
autumn.
A $25 per quarter tuition fee is
charged at Rikkio, a private school.
All students, regardless of majors,
are required to study English liter
ature and grammar throughout their
entire period there.
Approximately 75 per cent of the
courses offered are required of all
students before graduation. As es
timated 10 per cent of the men in
the university live in dormitories;

the remainder live in private homes
of Tokyo.
With few exceptions, Japan's high
er educational system excludes
women from upperclass studies.
Okami disclosed.
Rikkio's present enrollment is
comparable to Stanford's about 4000.
AH students are compelled to enter
military training classes and to wear
similar military uniforms at all
times.
"The freedom of students here and
the lack of many social restrictions
and regulations in the American
university" has made the deepest
impression on Okami, he confessed.
Economics and commerce are
Japanese students' favorite studies.
Collegians of Japan are ol two dis
tinct types: One is very conserva
tive, conforming to the old customs
and traditions of the mother coun
try; the other has adopted many
features of western civilization and
has become "very Americanized" in
its manner and actions.
Those enrolled in Rikkio must
furnish their own texts and pay li
brary and syllabus fees, similar to
local requirements. Class - time
length and recess time is the same as
Stanford. Class attendance is not
compulsory.
Besides Japanese, Rikkio's rolls
include small numbers each of
Americans, Chinese, Siamese, Ger
mans, and Koreans.
