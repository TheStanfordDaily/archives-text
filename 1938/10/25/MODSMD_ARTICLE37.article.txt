editors are no financial
wizards—so it is not our place
to say whether Stanford can afford
to put a $30,000 stadium around An
geil Field, as suggested in Campus
Opinion columns yesterday. But we
do know that next spring will
bring a Golden Age in track and
field supremacy for the Indians. And
if a stadium is in the offing, let's
get it up in a hurry.
We are in the midst of an athletic
championship cycle, and it is Dink
Templeton's turn to enter the spot
light. Tiny Thornhill had his three
years with the Vowing Soph grid
champs from '33 to '35. John Burin
took up the torch in '35, and gave
Stanford three years of basketball
supremacy, '35 to '37.
It is Templeton's turn, and he is
expected to turn out the finest group
of cindermen since Ben Eastman and
Hector Dyer made track history
back in 1930.
Reason number one that Tem
plcton and Hill Ellington are talk
ing championships is Clyde Jef
frey, junior transfer from River
side. lie will he the key man if
the Indians are to break the Tro
jan cinder reign on the Coast and
in the nation.
If the squad of 40-odd aspirants
were to go to the post tomorrow,
here is about the way they would
stack up, according to statistics com
piled by Frank Guthrie, track and
field newshound of The Daily sports
staff:
1. CLYDE JEFFREY'S 9 6 and
20.8 standards in the 100- and 200-
yard dashes as a junior college
sprinter last year rate him as the
best on the coast, and few are his
equal in the national intercollegiate
ranks. Last week, Jeffrey reeled off
a 9.8 race, leading CAPT. STAN
HISERMAN, a 9.8 sprinter in his
own right.
2. Loss of RAY MALOTT in the
quarter-mile slightly dampens the
440 aspirations, but the mentors are
counting on decided improvements
from CRAIG WILLIAMSON, who
has a best mark of 48.7, JOHN CAS
EY, and CHARLEY SHAW.
3. PAUL MOORE, a junior trans
fer from Fullerton, leads the 880
field with a "best" mark of 1 min.
54 sees., which is sure to be im
proved by Templeton. Moore is also
a mile threat.
4. Although Troy's Louie Zam
perini is the country's classiest dis
tance runner, Stanford's MARSTON
GIRARD from San Mateo, where he
had a 4:21 mile, and JOHNNY
EMANUEL, who was clocked in 4:33
in the four-lap grind last week, fig
ure to cut into the championship
picture.
5. SID HAYES, up from the frosh
ranks, rates as the best high hurdler
with a 14.8 time from last year, aug
menting BILL SIMPSON and BILL
HAWKINS.
6. With his chief rivals from Cal,
Troy and U.C.L.A. out because of
graduation, CAPT. HISERMAN, who
started late on the low barriers last
year, has an edge over every coast
feromer. —Shallenberger
