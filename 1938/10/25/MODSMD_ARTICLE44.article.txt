# Water Poloists Meet Troy Team Saturday
## 
### 
The Pacific Conference water polo leadership will he at stake when
Stanford's swimmers meet the Trojans in the Encina pool Saturday
afternoon.
While S.C. has won only one conference title in 25 years, water polo
enthusiasts call this year's team the strongest in the college's history and

one of the greatest teams ever seen<
in Los Angeles.
The Trojans employ a variation of
Stanford's .newly acquired Hun
garian attack. Paul Wolf, Olympic
Games swimming star, is the team's
outstanding scoring threat.
Coach Nort Thornton yesterday
sent his varsity squad through a
scrimmage with a team com
posed of reserves and both Don
Peterson and Bill Hana, former
Card aces.
The Indians looked even better
than they did in the first half of
their victory over U.C.L.A. last Fri
day. and Peterson was held to a
single tally. Peterson is the San
Francisco Olympic Club player who
scored five times against his former
alma mater to cinch a win over
Stanford two weeks ago.
With California able to edge out
the lowly Bruins only by a 1-0 mar
gin in an extra period and with
Stanford able to take the Bruins
4-1, it looks as if the conference
title itself may be determined here
Saturday. However, Bruin's main
threat, Dick Norton, has yet to ap
pear in a conference game this year,
and it is possible that with his serv
ices U.C.L.A. will catise an upset
later in the season.
