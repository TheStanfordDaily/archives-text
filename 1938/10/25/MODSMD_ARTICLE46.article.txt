# Shipkey Extols Frosh Gridders
## Coach Gives Team Chance Against Cal 
### 
Coach Shipkey could not contain
himself longer and yesterday burst
forth with exclamations of pleasure.
"There was a great improvement,"
he said, "in defensive play. My only
criticism is that the interference
runners in last week's U.C.L.A.
game were far below par. This vic
tory definitely proves we are no
flash in the pan. but will prove a
very strong opponent for the Cal
frosh, although we are outweighed
and outnumbered.
"I could not pick out any out
standing player in the game so I
will mention briefly all of the 32
players who did time last Saturday.
McClintock played the best game
he has this season. He was ably re
lieved by Stable and Mackey.
PATTERSON GRANITE
Patterson, line captain, was chiefly
j responsible for stopping the Bruins'
power plays through center. Yank
I Levin, guard, was outstanding for his
j vicious tackling. Heringer and Har
ris played sterling games as left
guard substitutes. Right guards
Crane, Sayre and Sheela showed
strength, although outweighed.
"The tackles were particularly
good. Radditz was a charging fool.
Lee Dewitt constantly smashed op
posing plays. Clyde Pitchford, third
right tackle, also saw action for a
short while. At the left tackle posi
tion, Winkie Jones played a heady
game by holding the opposing left
end, thus stopping the strong enemy
passing attack. Schmidt and Part
ridge, tackles, played good defensive
ball.
ENDS DEFENSIVE
"At left end, Bert Talcott turned
in fine blocking and defensive work
in stopping end runs. Meyers, at
right end, continually smeared plays
by breaking through interference.
Both Wilson and Murphy turned in
sterling performances at end until
I forced from the game by leg inju-
I ries. Eliot was outstanding on de
: fense, and Glunberg a natural at
pass catching.
In the backfield. Alberts was the
! spark plug on all types of play.
Blanton proved himself first string
' material, but he will have difficulty
1 surpassing the blocking and tack
ling of Sturgeon. Al Wool played
j good ball and Kmetovic was in true
I form, reeling off many fast gains.
Casey and Durham proved them
| selves better halves than many
: thought. Francis consistently showed
| himself worthy of a varsity position.
(Smith approached Francis' work in
j all but speed. At full, Rasmussen
I proved himself a star by his many
long passes."

j good ball and Kmetovic was in true
I form, reeling off many fast gains.
Casey and Durham proved them

: thought. Francis consistently showed

(Smith approached Francis' work in

I proved himself a star by his many

Coach Shipkey could not contain
himself longer and yesterday burst
forth with exclamations of pleasure.
"There was a great improvement,"
he said, "in defensive play. My only
criticism is that the interference
runners in last week's U.C.L.A.
game were far below par. This vic
tory definitely proves we are no
flash in the pan. but will prove a
very strong opponent for the Cal
frosh, although we are outweighed
and outnumbered.
"I could not pick out any out
standing player in the game so I
will mention briefly all of the 32
players who did time last Saturday.
McClintock played the best game
he has this season. He was ably re
lieved by Stable and Mackey.
PATTERSON GRANITE
Patterson, line captain, was chiefly
j responsible for stopping the Bruins'
power plays through center. Yank
I Levin, guard, was outstanding for his
j vicious tackling. Heringer and Har
ris played sterling games as left
guard substitutes. Right guards
Crane, Sayre and Sheela showed
strength, although outweighed.
"The tackles were particularly
good. Radditz was a charging fool.
Lee Dewitt constantly smashed op
posing plays. Clyde Pitchford, third
right tackle, also saw action for a
short while. At the left tackle posi
tion, Winkie Jones played a heady
game by holding the opposing left
end, thus stopping the strong enemy
passing attack. Schmidt and Part
ridge, tackles, played good defensive
ball.
ENDS DEFENSIVE
"At left end, Bert Talcott turned
in fine blocking and defensive work
in stopping end runs. Meyers, at
right end, continually smeared plays
by breaking through interference.
Both Wilson and Murphy turned in
sterling performances at end until
I forced from the game by leg inju-
I ries. Eliot was outstanding on de
: fense, and Glunberg a natural at
pass catching.
In the backfield. Alberts was the
! spark plug on all types of play.
Blanton proved himself first string
' material, but he will have difficulty
1 surpassing the blocking and tack
ling of Sturgeon. Al Wool played
j good ball and Kmetovic was in true
I form, reeling off many fast gains.
