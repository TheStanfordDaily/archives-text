# Fay on Shelf For Ucla Game
## Paulman's Condition Also Doubtful 
### 
Pete Fay, ailing varsity left half, j
will definitely not play against
U.C.L.A., according to doctors' re- !
ports given yesterday.
As if this joyful news were not
enough for one sitting, the same docs
asserted that Bill Paulman would be
mighty luCky to play against the
Bruins. Paulman's two charley
horses are well enough to allow him j
to walk without crutches, but he j
might suffer permanent injuries if he j
plays again before they are com- |
pletely normal.
While the loss of Fay was keenly '
felt in the Trojan battle, Paulman's j
absence was more acute inasmuch j
as the dopesters are quite Well !
agreed that the Indians could have
won had "Dynamite Bill" been in .
there kicking and passing.
PUNTING POOR
On several occasions, Stanford
booted themselves into trouble
simply because their punts went
straight up and down instead of for
ward, giving the Trojans possession
of the ball in dangerous territory.
Fay's illness, a streptococcic
throat infection, has now had him
on the shelf for ten days, and no one
is willing to guess just when he will
be able to turn out again.
Tiny Thornhill made only one
important change in the personnel
of his first three teams last night.)
"Cookie" Smith, red-headed sopho- j
more left halfback, has been switched
to right half and is running on
the second outfit behind Hugh Gal
larneau. This boy South is fast and
tricky, although untried in varsity
i competition, and is a much better
! than average kicker and passer.
INJURIES NOT SERIOUS
No serious injuries were picked up
i against Troy, although Gene Cold
'■ iron had a couple of good teeth bent
up against the roof of his mouth and
| Tony Calvelli once again played
j himself into a dead faint. Both were
| on the top team running plays last
night.
Those who have watched Calvelli
closely in his first four starts this
season are now more than ever con
vinced that the team's best defen
sive fullback plays entirely too hard.
Since Thornhill lacks a suitable re
serve for him, his loss always leaves
the Indian secondary defense at
just about half strength.
j Someone running about incognito
on the practice field yesterday sug
gested that it might be good strategy
to keep Calvelli benched for about a
• quarter and a half because Stanford
I rarely attacks before that time. Then
| Thornhill could inject his prize
j package with almost full assurance
! that he would go at top speed
through the rest of the game. Any
| way, it's an idea.
