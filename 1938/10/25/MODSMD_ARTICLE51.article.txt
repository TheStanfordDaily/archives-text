# Road Out of Town
## 
### 
BECAUSE many complaints have come in
regarding the miniature Grand Canyon on
Escondido Avenue, which runs past Branner to
Mayfield, The Daily yesterday called J. B.
McDonnell, Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds. The call was unnecessary.
Their office has had complaints too, and vir
tually immediate action was promised.
That's beating the boys to the draw and now
we know that every day in every way Stan
ford's road service is better and better and
better.
And sometimes the roads are smoother.â€”
