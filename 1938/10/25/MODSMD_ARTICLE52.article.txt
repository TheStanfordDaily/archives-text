# A.S.U. Strides In/Out
## 
### 
ANNOUNCEMENT yesterday that the Stan
ford chapter of the American Student Un
ion was planning an investigation of student
off-campus working conditions brings to light
the immeasurable difference between Stan
ford's A.S.U. and that at California.
In spite of all that members can say for the
organization, the A.S.U. everywhere has gotten
itself a reputation for being a crew of red-hot
radicals, sold on Communism, and ready to
fight at the drop of a hat for their own causes.
And the organization at California has done
much to bolster that reputation with fact and
action.
But Stanford's is a tabby cat. Hampered par
ticularly by lack of numbers, and beaten from
the start by an unusually un-socially conscious
population, Stanford's A.S.U. has never become
the power on the campus that California's has.
Perhaps it is for the best. Conditions differ
so between the two universities that where an
organization like the A.S.U. can do much in a
location where social problems more nearly
simulate those of the nation as a whole, at a
smaller institution it is reduced to holding
meetings in an esoteric circle.
But, following the lead of California's enfant
terrible, Stanford's A.S.U. is going out like a
white knight to do battle with the evils of off
campus working conditions. The A.S.U.-ers
will probably come home unscratched because
they will meet no ogres to fight.
Although purportedly a socially conscious
group, it has failed to notice the social differ
ence between Berkeley and Palo Alto. Where
the first is a large metropolitan center, with all
the attendant examples of poor living and work
ing conditions, the second is a residential cen
ter with concomitant higher standards of social
living.
The A.S.U. should receive credit for embark
ing on some concrete course of action. But
perhaps that action could find a more striking
goal.
Their consideration of a graduate students'
dormitory is more nearly appropriate to the
needs of Stanford; should they manage to suc
ceed where others have failed they would de
serve a blazing array of medals.
But even more timely would be some sort
of concentration of Stanford opinion and infor
mation concerning the coming state election.
The work would be well within the field of the
A.S.U., would have practical value as far as
the campus was concerned, and would prob
ably swell the ranks of the organization.
But action such as they have proposed, ac
tion almost simply for the sake of action, simply
because a similar group, although in different
situation, took action, rather approaches the
futile.
