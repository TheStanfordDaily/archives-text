# Anti-Anti-Pound

### 
DESPITE all that can be done to publicize
scientific research within university walls,
the general population carries the notion that
such work is just so much trimming. Hence
such nonsense as the Anti-Pound Law.
For some reason work done in university
laboratories never strikes home as work done to
benefit that same general population. So when
such a book as Professor Lewis Terman's "Psy
chological Factors in Marital Happiness" is pub
lished, the inclination is to treat it lightly and
politely.
The facts are, of course, exactly opposite.
Bit by bit, scientific knowledge and practical
application of that knowledge is emanating from
university sources in a fluent, constructive
stream. To stop that stream means a stop to the
only active agent working today to advance
society.
Social theory, political and economic thought
are blocked by a sort of mad confusion con
trolling the world's population. Scientific work,
quietly efficiently, is going on where those
other agents have slowed down.

And Stanford, led by outstanding workers, is
a part of that stream of constructive benefits.
Stop Stanford, stop other universities, and you
stop the stream. When the stream stops, so
does all else.
The direct similarity between Dr. Terman's
book and such stream-stopping acts as the Anti-
Pound Law seems remote at first glance. But
his book is just the latest Stanford contribution
to the stream. Before it, in recent years, have
come such things as Dr. E. W. Schultz's work on
infantile paralysis, work in the physics depart
ment on short-wave generation, and biological
research into the factors controlling develop
ment.
As contributions, they are all potently mean
ingful. As examples of scientific research ev
erywhere, they should pile on fuel to burn the
Anti-Pound Law at the election stake.
Grounds for burning: criminal social sabo
tage.
