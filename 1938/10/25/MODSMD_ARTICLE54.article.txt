RELAX GIRLS
W/TIEN I commented last Friday on the alleged hys
teria of freshman women during bonfire time, I
rather hoped that the girls would resent it. They did.
And so this morning, I read with a Machiavellian
smirk two letters from Roble women.
They point out in lady-like but effective language
that the Class of '42 has no intention of getting hys
terics over the Big Game bonfire, but is approaching
the crisis with a firmly controlled enthusiasm that
will be a model for future generations. It is not fair,
they say, to blame this year's freshmen because in the
past Roble's girls have done emotional cartwheels at
bonfire time.
.-n * * *
All of this is very encouraging. Personally, I am
convinced that a bright new era is dawning in which
freshmen women will remain steadfast before the gusts
of excitement. But unfortunately the administration
has a suspicious nature. It will take more than a
couple of letters to sell them the idea that Roble can go
through another Big Game without the usual emer
gency calls for bromides.
The question of Roble and its nerves, of course, is
only one part of the Big Game pattern. It is the most
conspicuous argument against the bonfire, and so it
has been used as the main reason for cutting down
the program. But even if the freshman women would
guarantee to go to bed quietly at 10 o'clock, there
would still be a tangled debate over the question of
how long Big Game celebration should last.
* * * *
JF WORK on the bonfire is begun two or three days
ahead of time, academic work falls off in a precise
proportion that math professors could turn into a
straight line equation. Freshmen march guard duty
through the night, feeling romantically jittery like
a sentry at a Foreign Legion outpost. Over in Encina,
the boys wait for the alarm so that they can stampede
forth. Professors are faced with empty seats .and
give their lectures to an incidental-music background
of snores.
This is the argument against a prolonged prepara
tion. Most of the students, though, disagree with it.
They point out that Big Game week is pretty much
an academic loss anyway. Amateur dramatists are
dodging sandbags and directors, rehearsing for the
Gaieties. Rally Committee is running around in frus
trated little circles planning card stunts and cere
monies. The best thing for the University to do would
be write the week off unofficially as an act of God,
and let the students alone.
* * * >K
The situation has all the identifying marks of one
of those problems which eventually become either
Supreme Court cases or grounds for a civil war.
One thing only is obvious. When the Roble girls
indulge in a mild case of fits, it means that the bon
fire has to be built in one day. That, the administra
tion tells us, is the deciding factor this year.
And so for the sake of posterity, I hope that the
present freshman women have the placid disposition
they claim.

teria of freshman women during bonfire time, I
rather hoped that the girls would resent it. They did.
And so this morning, I read with a Machiavellian
smirk two letters from Roble women.
They point out in lady-like but effective language
that the Class of '42 has no intention of getting hys
terics over the Big Game bonfire, but is approaching
the crisis with a firmly controlled enthusiasm that
will be a model for future generations. It is not fair,
they say, to blame this year's freshmen because in the
past Roble's girls have done emotional cartwheels at
bonfire time.
.-n * * *
All of this is very encouraging. Personally, I am
convinced that a bright new era is dawning in which
freshmen women will remain steadfast before the gusts
of excitement. But unfortunately the administration
has a suspicious nature. It will take more than a
couple of letters to sell them the idea that Roble can go
through another Big Game without the usual emer
gency calls for bromides.
The question of Roble and its nerves, of course, is
only one part of the Big Game pattern. It is the most
conspicuous argument against the bonfire, and so it
has been used as the main reason for cutting down
the program. But even if the freshman women would
guarantee to go to bed quietly at 10 o'clock, there
would still be a tangled debate over the question of
how long Big Game celebration should last.
* * * *
JF WORK on the bonfire is begun two or three days
ahead of time, academic work falls off in a precise
proportion that math professors could turn into a
straight line equation. Freshmen march guard duty
through the night, feeling romantically jittery like
a sentry at a Foreign Legion outpost. Over in Encina,
the boys wait for the alarm so that they can stampede
forth. Professors are faced with empty seats .and
give their lectures to an incidental-music background
of snores.
This is the argument against a prolonged prepara
tion. Most of the students, though, disagree with it.
They point out that Big Game week is pretty much
an academic loss anyway. Amateur dramatists are
dodging sandbags and directors, rehearsing for the
Gaieties. Rally Committee is running around in frus
trated little circles planning card stunts and cere
monies. The best thing for the University to do would
be write the week off unofficially as an act of God,
and let the students alone.
* * * >K
The situation has all the identifying marks of one
of those problems which eventually become either
Supreme Court cases or grounds for a civil war.
One thing only is obvious. When the Roble girls
indulge in a mild case of fits, it means that the bon
fire has to be built in one day. That, the administra
tion tells us, is the deciding factor this year.
And so for the sake of posterity, I hope that the
present freshman women have the placid disposition
they claim.
