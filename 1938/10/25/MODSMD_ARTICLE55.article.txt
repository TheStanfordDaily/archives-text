|T WAS a dark, grey morning. I'm not trying to
use that as an alibi for my friends, but it was never
theless, a dark, grey morning.
On the night before, when his will-power had
been phenomenal, my friend had agreed to meet a
friend of his along a certain stretch of Toyon Hall
early (7:30) the next morning and they would take a
shower together.
They met the next morning and started for the
showers. My friend came to a door and opened it.
You re not going to take u shower there, are you?"
his friend asked him.
"Of course I'm going to take a shower here," my
friend said, walking into the phone booth and closing
the door.

A year or two ago one of the fraternities here
had a little remodeling done over the summer, enough
remodeling so that when the house was finished they
had one rather large hall left over with no furniture
to fill it.
They particularly needed a rug for it, so some of
the boys went up to the city and went around on the
sly to some of the better apartment houses looking at
rugs. They found one which would do, so ihey dis
guised themselves in white coats and things, went to
the apartment, asked the people there if they didn't
want their rug cleaned, and got away with it.
And, strictly between you and me, they still have it.

]\f Y ROOMMATE last year has been graduated, and
sometimes that makes me very sad. We used fc>
have wonderful bull sessions late at night and we
would read Thurber to each other and a lot of things
like that. He was a smart guy and, sometimes, very
funny.
He was sitting in front row of his logic class one
day, and he had his lesson cold. He was sitting with
his feet crossed nonchalantly on the lecturer's plat
form. and while the professor carefully led the dumber
members of the class through assorted syllogisms, my
former roommate heckled him with various facetious
cracks.
The professor, getting a little tired of that, stepped
over to the edge of the platform, looked at my ex
roommate and then glared at his feet. My ex-room
mate glanced carelessly down at his feet to see what
the professor found so objectionable.
It threw him a little off balance when he saw
that he .had come to class in a pair of old l)edroom
slippers. And no Socks.
