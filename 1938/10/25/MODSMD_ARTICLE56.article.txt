# Author Raps British In Sharp Satire

### 
No wonder Margaret Halsey's
"With Malice Toward Some" is in
its sixth printing and has sold more
than a quarter of a million copies,
for it is just plain funny. Miss Hal
sey's pertinent style, satiric humor,
none-too-subtle malice, and rugged
Americanism is guaranteed to give
the reader a laugh—or at least a
smile—on every page.
The book, originally called "The
Travel Diary of a Professor's Wife,"
is basically that, but that innocu
ous tag does little to express the
character of this pungent, vitriolic
masterpiece.
Miss Halsey, with her professor
husband, goes to England, where he
is to teach in a small college. The
diary tells of her experience with
and reactions to the English people
and customs. She is merciless in her
ridicule.
TYPICAL INCIDENT
A typical incident was the au
thor's attempt to get a glass of milk.
The waitress couldn't understand
anyone's wanting a glass of milk—
even an American—and after two
trips to the kitchen, she returned
and desperately enquired if "Modom
wished the milk in a cup or a
glass?"
"Just roll it in a napkin," snapped
Miss Halsey.
On English fox-hunting, she com
ments: "A hunt is merely a rapid
procession consisting of first a fox,
then a group of intelligent dogs, and
lastly a concourse of rather less in
telligent people."
BRITISH FOOTWEAR
On footwear: "English women's
shoes look as if they had been made
by someone who had often heard
shoes described but had never seen
any."
On social conversation: "Listen
ing to Britons dining out is like
watching people play first-rate ten
nis with imaginary balls."
But a review of "With Malice
Toward Some" is very likely to be
come a series of the reviewer's fa
vorite quotes, and there he treads
on thin ice, for he is sure to leave
out some of his reader's favorites.
It is safe to say that Miss Halsey
is the funniest American woman
writer since Dorothy Parker's hey
dey. Though .she is inclined to ex
aggerate, that short-coming is over
come by the book's general effec
tiveness. —Silverman
