## ROBLE SNAPS BACK 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
If any woman in Roble objects to
the time spent building the bonfire,
we wish you would show her to us.
If Roble women got hysterics as
easily as you say, we would all be
dead by now.
We have not yet found one in
mate of this hall who does not think
that the Bull Session of October 21
is the silliest thing she has ever
read. We like to hear about Stan
ford's big fire even if we cannot
be at it, so please stop slamming
Roble and the Class of '42.
Yours for bigger and better bon
fires,
Twelve Robleites,

M. R., J. 8., N. H., C. H. R„
