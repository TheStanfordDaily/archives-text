# HITS 'POUND ACT'
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I would like to compliment the
Stanford Daily on its action in bring
ing to the attention of its readers
the article on the "Pound Act" in
this week's copy of "Life" (Oct.
24). I feel that this article clarified
the antivivisectionist proposal.
It seems to me that a considera
tion of this article will do much to
defeat this proposal, which was
brought into being by a lot of "fe
males" who had nothing better to
do with their time than to gather in
sewing circles to discuss the "mal
treatment" of animals and attempt to
remedy the situation.

If these same ''females" would see
the medical research in the labora
tory and stop to consider the num
ber of lives which have been saved
as a result of this "maltreatment" of
animals they would attempt to co
operate with scientific endeavor
rather than to retard its progress.
I suggest that Stanford students
after reading the article in "Life"
co-operate with the efforts of medi
cal science and attempt to defeat this
state pound proposal.
Concerned
