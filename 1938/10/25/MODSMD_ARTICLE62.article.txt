# IN RE CARD STUNTS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What is wrong with our Rally
Committee? For the Washington
State game, stickers were passed
out with "Beat W.S.C." printed on
them. Now when we have a big
game, U.S.C., there is no sign of
such stickers.
At the half time of the U.S.C.
game our card stunts were a dis
grace. Again the committee butched;
we can't be expected to hold up the
right cards when an example pic
ture is held up with a trick number
on it, and we can't hear the yell
king's orders because of the noise
the band is making on the field.
The example picture should be
numbered like the first two and the
last one were. We knew what to do
in these three. The rooters really
wish to co-operate with the Com
mittee if given half a chance.
