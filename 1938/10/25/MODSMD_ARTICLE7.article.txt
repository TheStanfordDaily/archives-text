# Bark Contrasts Past, Present
## Current Conditions Differ from Roman 
### 
Speaking on "The Fall of Rome |
and Twentieth Century Confusion,"
Dr. William C. Bark, of the Stanford
Department of History, scored the
opinion of many men that modern
civilization is on the brink of a dis
aster similar to that which befell
the Roman Empire.
Dr. Bark, speaking on the Stan
ford radio program last night, said
that every week has brought at least
one new reference to the striking
comparison between declining Rome
and the chaotic modern world.
"But," he said, "it is my opinion
that history is not about to repeat
itself, and that it has never done so
in the past with any reliability." He
proceeded to clarify this statement
with a brief review of political, so
cial, and economic activity in Roman
times and in our own age.
"Our economic organization has
never been incapable of feeding and
clothing us. Rome could not pro
duce enough. We can. Our task is
to distribute the wealth which we
can create in abundance," he said.
"History refuses to foretell the fu
ture, but it does elucidate clearly
that the refusal to use reason brings
a harsh penalty. It did so in Rome,
and we may anticipate that it will
again."
During the coming season, the
Stanford radio hour will be broad
cast at 8:30 o'clock Monday nights
on station KGO.
