# Boathouse Plans Near Completion
## Building Cost To Be Under Original Price; Leaders To Discuss Finances 
### 
Willi a conference between A.S.S.U. President 11. B. Lee, Architects
Bakcwcll and Weiiie, and Contractor Charles Wagner set for 11 o'clock
today, the Farm's boathouse blue-prints are taking shape rapidly, it was
learned last night.
Main purpose of the meeting between olliicals of the two companies
and Lee is to consider revised plans for the structure, the student-body

president said. 4
Following this morning's conclave,
student activity leaders will gather
;il 2 o'clock in the A.S.S.U. council
room to discuss means of financing
the now building. With Associated
Students' appropriation of $2500 to
form the basis of the construction
fund, it is expected that the com
mittee will devise ways of raising
whatever additional amount is need
ed. At Ex Committee last night,
boathouse committee heads spoke of
concentrating the money-making
drive into "one large campaign."
LOWER COST EXPECTED
In preliminary discussion with Ar
chitect Weihe yesterday, Lee dis
covered that blue-prints incorporat
ing Dick Spenser's winning contest
plans "would probably lower the es
timated cost" from the original
$7000 figure.
Wrecking of the old structure will
begin next week. Ex Committee
learned. Though it is not known
how much of the wood can be sal
vaged for further use, waste mate
rial will be used for the Big Game
bonfire, Excom decided.
CANOES TO BE REMOVED
Final decision concerning canoes
and present residents of the boat
house has not yet been reached by
Acting Comptroller J. Hugh Jack
son. Houses, clubs, and halls will be
notified in time to remove canoes
before actual wrecking work starts,
however.
Spencer's plans, nucleus for the
architect's drawings, will make the
new building single-story, consist
ing of two long wings centering at a
pentagonal middle section. General
shape of the complete structure will
be that of a wide-angle, open tri
angle.
COMPLETION BY JANUARY 1
First floor will house some 50 ca
noes ax-ranged so that they can be
carried to the lake through large
sliding doors. The center portion
will contain an attendant's office and
two student rooms. Above will be a
glass-enclosed lounge, dressing
rooms for men and women.
Roof of the two wings will be a
modem sun-4cck, complete with
appropriate outdoor furniture.
Floats will line the entire front of
the building, while a special diving
platform will be crectod a short dis
tance from the outer edge of the
Boathouse, according to Spencer's
drawing. Assurance that the struc
ture would be finished before Jan
uary 1 was given by Wagner, Uni
versity contractor.
