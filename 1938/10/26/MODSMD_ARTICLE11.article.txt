## Series Audience Told New York Fair Will Commercialize Field 
### 
"Television will be forced out of
the 'swaddling clothcs' stage with
its commercialization next spring at
the New York World's Fair," Don
ald K. Lippincott, television engi
neer and patent attorney, predicted
last night when he spoke on "What
Is Television" at the Tuesday Eve
ning Series in Memorial Hall.
"We have technical television in
the United States today," explained
the speaker, for the invention "has
at last pushed its long and cautious
nose around the corner, but as to
how fast and large the industry will
grow, we cannot say at the present
time."

Introduced by Frederick E. Ter
ynan, professor of electrical engi
neering, Mr. Lippincott gave a brief,
introductory history of the televi
sion industry, from the first elec
trical transmission of pictures in
1848 to the successful experimental
broadcasts and demonstrations of the
present day.
DEVELOPMENT ENCOURAGED
Terming television "the most per
fect instrument of propaganda yet
devised by man," the speaker, a di
rector of Farnsworth Television, Inc.,
revealed that its development and
perfection in Nazi Germany has giv
en 'tremendous encouragement' by
Adolf Hitler.
Because "it would occupy fre
quencies representing 18 times the
range of the standard broadcasting
station band in the United States,"
the possibility of transmitting tele
vised images in color was character
ized by Mr. Lippincott as "economic
ally outrageous."
Experimental television pro
grams have been forced to use the
ultra-short wave bands principally
because their transmission "takes up
so much room," the engineer ex
plained.
STATEMENT CONTRADICTED
The frequently-heard statement
that television broadcasts can be
sent only along the line of sight was
contradicted by Mr. Lippincott, who
asserted that transmission can be
extended beyond the horizon, but
"only for a short distance and only
with the expenditure of tremendous
power."
"Fifty miles seems to be the pres
ent practical limit," declared the
lecturer, "and therefore we can ex
pect the urban population to bene
fit from television long before the
people in rural areas of the coun
try."
Mr. Lippincott explained that ex
perimental television sets now in
operation are capable of receiving
"surprisingly clear pictures," and
that "these televised images possess
as much detail as do pictures re
produced by a high-quality 16-
millimeter home movie projector."
DESCRIBES CLARITY
"These images have no percept
ible "flicker" and, if the receiving
equipment of the television set is
accurately adjusted, the pictures are
almost completely free of distortion,"
continued the speaker, who is a
member of both the Institute of Ra
dio Engineers and the American In
sittute of Electrical Engineers.
"Bootleg" television sets, which pay
no royalties to patent holders, are
now being sold in New York City
for as little as $175, revealed Mr.
Lippincott, who stated that "sets of
good quality will probably sell first
for about $250 in the United States,"
but that quantity production mcth
ods "will soon bring down these
prices."
