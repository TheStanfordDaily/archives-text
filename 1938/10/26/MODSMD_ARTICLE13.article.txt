# Joan Crawford On Farm? Phone 5171

### KAY JOHNSEN 
About 1925, when Lucille Le Scuer
was an unknown dancer, Joan Craw
ford was a little girl five years old.
But in J929, Miss La Scuer, with
a change of name, rose as one of
Hollywood's stars: Joan Crawford.
This autumn, the first Joan Craw
ford entered Stanford, and occupied
a room in Roble Hall like all other
Stanford freshmen women. But life
for her has more complications than
for most girls ... all because she
has the name of a famous actress,
lives in Beverly Hills, associates with
cincma stars herself, and looks
enough like The Crawford to be
mistaken for her.
"Of course," Stanford's Joan ad
mits, "having a name like mine, I !
always have something to talk about !
and break the ice with any new i
acquaintance."
But then, it has its disadvantages |

too.
At the Roble Jolly-up last week
a boy asked her her name.
"Joan Crawford," she replied.
Ho said no more to her.
But he remarked to the next girl
he danced with: "I just danced with
the most unreasonable woman. I
very politely asked her what her
name was, and she snapped back at
me, 'Joan Crawford'!"
But Stanford's Joan has had
things like that happen before.
In high school the traffic officer—
who is also a Stanford student now
—stopped her on a violation of the
law and demanded:
"What is your name?"
"Joan Crawford," she replied.
"Why, how do you do?" sarcas
i tically went on the embryonic Stan
| ford Alpha Dell—Bill J.miss—and
I then added:
) "Meet me. I'm Greta Garbo."

Joan lives with her mother and
sister, Eleanor, in Beverly Hills,
across the street from Edward G.
Robinson and next door to the Law
rence Tlbbetta. Joan (19) and Elea
nor (1(5) go around with the Tibbett
twins, Larry and Richard, whom
they have known since "before they
wore long pants."
Joan receives The Crawford's fan
mail, and at one time, had two gen
tlemen in white ties and tails with
top hats and orchids call on her. A
mistake—they wanted to take out
the wrong Joan.
"No, I don't like Crawford," re
marked Stanford's Joan, and then
went into details.
"But." she continued, "I'm sorry,
though, that she married Fronchot
Tone first, because I think he's
swell.
"And," she concluded. "I like
Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., too."

ford was a little girl five years old.
But in J929, Miss La Scuer, with
a change of name, rose as one of
Hollywood's stars: Joan Crawford.
This autumn, the first Joan Craw
ford entered Stanford, and occupied
a room in Roble Hall like all other
Stanford freshmen women. But life
for her has more complications than
for most girls ... all because she
has the name of a famous actress,
lives in Beverly Hills, associates with
cincma stars herself, and looks
enough like The Crawford to be
mistaken for her.
"Of course," Stanford's Joan ad
mits, "having a name like mine, I !
always have something to talk about !
and break the ice with any new i
acquaintance."
But then, it has its disadvantages |

too.
At the Roble Jolly-up last week
a boy asked her her name.
"Joan Crawford," she replied.
Ho said no more to her.
But he remarked to the next girl
he danced with: "I just danced with
the most unreasonable woman. I
very politely asked her what her
name was, and she snapped back at
me, 'Joan Crawford'!"
But Stanford's Joan has had
things like that happen before.
In high school the traffic officer—
who is also a Stanford student now
—stopped her on a violation of the
law and demanded:
"What is your name?"
"Joan Crawford," she replied.
"Why, how do you do?" sarcas
i tically went on the embryonic Stan
| ford Alpha Dell—Bill J.miss—and
I then added:
) "Meet me. I'm Greta Garbo."

Joan lives with her mother and
sister, Eleanor, in Beverly Hills,
across the street from Edward G.
Robinson and next door to the Law
rence Tlbbetta. Joan (19) and Elea
nor (1(5) go around with the Tibbett
twins, Larry and Richard, whom
they have known since "before they
wore long pants."
Joan receives The Crawford's fan
mail, and at one time, had two gen
tlemen in white ties and tails with
top hats and orchids call on her. A
mistake—they wanted to take out
the wrong Joan.
"No, I don't like Crawford," re
marked Stanford's Joan, and then
went into details.
"But." she continued, "I'm sorry,
though, that she married Fronchot
Tone first, because I think he's
swell.
"And," she concluded. "I like
Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., too."
About 1925, when Lucille Le Scuer
was an unknown dancer, Joan Craw
ford was a little girl five years old.
