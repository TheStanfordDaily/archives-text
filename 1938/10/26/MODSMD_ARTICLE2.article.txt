### 
Bids for the forthcoming Sopho
more Cotillion will go on sale today
in the A.S.S.U. office at 1 o'clock for
$2.50, according to Bob Anderson,
general chairman of the affair. This
first big dance of the year is to be
held Friday, Nov. 4, in the Women's
Gym from 9 to 1 o'clock.
Featured fit this year's Cotillion
will be Maestro Eddie Fitzpatrick
and his famed band with a "Let's Go
Slumming" theme.
According to reports from Ben
Miller, decoration committee chair
man, "No effort will be spared in
converting the Women's Gym into a
picturesque sluni area of old Lime
house with lots of wry little
touches."
"For the first time," Miller added,
"a campus dance will have tables at
which people may sit quietly and
comfortably. Instead of jockeying
for a spot in a long line leading to
the punch bowl, they will sip rather
than gulp refreshments."
