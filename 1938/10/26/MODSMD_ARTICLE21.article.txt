# Three Members Of Farm Faculty Called 'Radicals'
## Dies Committee Told Hand, Addis, Kefauver Lean Toward 'Left Wing' 
### 
Three Stanford professors were yesterday named before the Die* In
vestigating Committee on Un-American Activities by Harper Knowlcs
and Ray Nemmo as "radicals or of the left wing" and were accused of
using "boring from within tactics," according to United Press dispatches.
The professors were I)r. G. N. Kefauver, chairman of the Department

>01 Eicuicaiion; ur. Harold (J. Hand,
also of the education department;
and Dr. Thomas Addis, professor of
medicine. Also listed by the two wit
nesses were nine University of Cali
fornia faculty members.
The witnesses declared that the
faculties, the Commonwealth Club
of San Francisco, t lie San Francisco
League of Women Shoppers, and
other organizations were victims of
the "boring from within tactics."
They also asserted that numerous
other northern California and San
Francisco organizations are either
controlled by or under the control
of the Communist party.
ROOSEVELT ACCUSES
At the same time, the dispatches
revealed that President Roosevelt
last night accused the House Com
mittee of permitting itself to be
used in a "flagrantly unfair and un-
American attempt" by disgruntled
Republican office-holders to influ
ence the re-election of his friend,
Governor Frank Murphy of Michi
gan.
Admitting he is "disturbed" over
testimony before the committee last
week that Murphy was guilty of
"treasonable" conduct during the
19.37 automobile sit-down flrikes,
Mr. Roosevelt described thq red
haired governor as a "great Amer
ican."
The criticism of Murphji was
voiced by Circuit Judge P;lul V.
Gadola, whom the chief exwL'utive
described as "disgruntled" aid by
John M. Bel l inger, of Flint, Mich.,
tagged as "a discharged Republican
city manager." Attacking the charges
as "lurid" and as bias
ed." Mr. Roosevelt lashed the, com
mittee for "making no effort ?to get
at the truth" of the allegations'.
PERKINS CHARGED
The attack on the committee came
a few hours after it heard charges
by Mr. Knowlcs, American Legion
official of California, that Secretary
of Labor Perkins is "coddling" alien
criminals, and is guilty of "gross
malfeasance" of office and "derelic
tion of duty" in administration of
immigration laws.
The vehemence of the President's
attack startled capital observers. It.
I was directed by a Democratic
President against a committee pre
ponderantly Democratic, which was
set up by an equally top-heavy
Democratic House of Representa
tives. Only two Republicans are
members of the group.
None of the committee members
was in the capital when Ihe blast
was unleashed. Rep. Joseph Starnes,
D., Ala., who conducted the hearing
yesterday, left for Alabama at mid
afternoon.
AGRICULTURE VULNERABLE
Earlier, Knowles had told the
committee Communists have select
ed California agriculture as a major
focal point of infiltration because it
is vulnerable due to the perishable
nature of its produce.
The West Coast maritime forces
of the Committee for Industrial Or
j ganization, under the direction of
• | Harry Bridges, Australian immi
grant, Knowlcs said, have given
I "great assistance" to the Communist
I i farm "agitators."

The attack on the committee came
a few hours after it heard charges
by Mr. Knowlcs, American Legion
official of California, that Secretary
of Labor Perkins is "coddling" alien
criminals, and is guilty of "gross
malfeasance" of office and "derelic
tion of duty" in administration of
immigration laws.
The vehemence of the President's
attack startled capital observers. It.
I was directed by a Democratic
President against a committee pre
ponderantly Democratic, which was
set up by an equally top-heavy
Democratic House of Representa
tives. Only two Republicans are
members of the group.
None of the committee members
was in the capital when Ihe blast
was unleashed. Rep. Joseph Starnes,
D., Ala., who conducted the hearing
yesterday, left for Alabama at mid
afternoon.
AGRICULTURE VULNERABLE
Earlier, Knowles had told the
committee Communists have select
ed California agriculture as a major
focal point of infiltration because it
is vulnerable due to the perishable
nature of its produce.
The West Coast maritime forces
of the Committee for Industrial Or
j ganization, under the direction of
• | Harry Bridges, Australian immi
grant, Knowlcs said, have given
I "great assistance" to the Communist
I i farm "agitators."
Three Stanford professors were yesterday named before the Die* In
vestigating Committee on Un-American Activities by Harper Knowlcs
and Ray Nemmo as "radicals or of the left wing" and were accused of
using "boring from within tactics," according to United Press dispatches.
The professors were I)r. G. N. Kefauver, chairman of the Department

>01 Eicuicaiion; ur. Harold (J. Hand,
also of the education department;
and Dr. Thomas Addis, professor of
medicine. Also listed by the two wit
nesses were nine University of Cali
fornia faculty members.
The witnesses declared that the
faculties, the Commonwealth Club
of San Francisco, t lie San Francisco
League of Women Shoppers, and
other organizations were victims of
the "boring from within tactics."
They also asserted that numerous
other northern California and San
Francisco organizations are either
controlled by or under the control
of the Communist party.
ROOSEVELT ACCUSES
At the same time, the dispatches
revealed that President Roosevelt
last night accused the House Com
mittee of permitting itself to be
used in a "flagrantly unfair and un-
American attempt" by disgruntled
Republican office-holders to influ
ence the re-election of his friend,
Governor Frank Murphy of Michi
gan.
Admitting he is "disturbed" over
testimony before the committee last
week that Murphy was guilty of
"treasonable" conduct during the
19.37 automobile sit-down flrikes,
Mr. Roosevelt described thq red
haired governor as a "great Amer
ican."
The criticism of Murphji was
voiced by Circuit Judge P;lul V.
Gadola, whom the chief exwL'utive
described as "disgruntled" aid by
John M. Bel l inger, of Flint, Mich.,
tagged as "a discharged Republican
city manager." Attacking the charges
as "lurid" and as bias
ed." Mr. Roosevelt lashed the, com
mittee for "making no effort ?to get
at the truth" of the allegations'.
