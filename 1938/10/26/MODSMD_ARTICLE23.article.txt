### 
"Germany must vi her colonies
back. And I am . uiv that they will
be returned to her without a war.
All Germany wants is a pla " in the
sun, and that is what our beloved
leader is struggling for."'
Speaking was Kurt Wolf, a 25-
year-old exchange student from
Germany, who has just arrived at
Stanford to work on his doctor's de
cree in physics. Wolf, a diminutive
yet dynamic fellow who possesses
the usual physical characteristics of
the Nordic race, had consented to
discuss matters of intere t.
In talking of Germany's present
relationship with other nations, Wolf
haid that it is mostly a case ol' mis
understanding, for if the peoples of
the world would realize that 80 mil
lion Germans are living on a terri
tory too small for comfortable ex
istence without a sufficient supply
of raw material, it would be less
difficult to understand why Ger
many has to expand and regain the
colonies taken away from her by
the Versailles Treaty.
"Since arriving here this last Sep
tember, I have found the- Americans
very friendly; quite in contrast with
many American newspapers which,
partly through misunderstandings,
are hostile to my country. The ex
change student continued. "The best
propaganda against this and the
German word of 'propaganda' means
'publication' or 'information' is for
Americans to come and see or to

'obtain true information about my
country, which is a land of peace
land work and no more unemploy
ment."
Wolf received his master's degree
after four years in a "techniscle
hochschule"— a college that has only
departments of engineering and
•physical sciences. lie also revealed
that German students are not able
■ to earn their livings while attending
' school as they only have time for
I studying.
Wolf continually emphasized the
value of exchanging students be
tween different countries as one of
| the best ways to promote friendli
| ness and understanding. He said
i there are about 70 German students
: iii America at present, four of whom
attend Stanford University.
