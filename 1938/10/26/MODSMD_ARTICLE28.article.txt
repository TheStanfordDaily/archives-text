# CAMPUS OPINION
## A.S.U. COMEBACK 
### 
The Editor. Sir:
According to The Daily, we can
smugk sit back and view peace, se
curity, ;.nd purity reigning supreme.
There are r.o local or national clouds
on the horizon that we as college
students could possibly be interested
in. Ergo, why an American Student
1 Union to investigate these mythical
| troubles.
It was pointed out that an inves
tigation of the off-campus working
conditions of Stanford students was
; particularly futile. Note the huh
standard of living in Palo Alto com
pared with the swt'.'it shops of in
dustrial Berkeley. The A.S.U. may
I not find all Stanford students being
j exploited -but has anyone (espe
cially The Daily) ever taken the
trouble to investigate these condi
tions? Perhaps it would be better
to follow the scientific method: Ob
serve first, then draw conclusions,
iWe are as interested in protecting
recent employers as we are in fer
reting out bad conditions.
Next, the A.S.U. was criticized for
not being an active force in politics.
I might point out that the Public
Exercises Committee has expressed
itself definitely against partisan po
litical activity on the campus, which
is "an educational institution, not a
public forum." Aside from the ob
vious fact that if the A.S.U. did par
| ticipate only in such activities, we
i would have an actual organization
; for three weeks every two years

the editorial failed to note: (1) tin
A.S.U. constitution states that it wil
not affiliate itsell with any politica
party; (2) the A.S.U. is a factor foi
the progression of liberal though
everywhere. If students at St anion
are "unusually un-socially con
scious'' (nothing to brag about), w<
aim to jar them from their apatln
of sitting upon something beside
their bawlout averages.
It is evident that the Daily edito;
has nothing like a complete pictun
of our program, and has merely pro
claimed an item or two to be futile
We strive to respond to studen
needs, and welcome any criticism o
the A.S.U. We should even like t<
extend a blanket invitation to tin
Daily to attend a meeting or two
in the event of future suggestions.
