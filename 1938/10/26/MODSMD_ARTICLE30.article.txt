# Backfield Shift Brings New Life
## 
### 
If a prolonged scrimmage last night means anything. "Cookie" South
may he the antidote needed to perk up the Stanford football team.
For 45 minutes, the lirst team was shoved up and down the field and
then >at on by a crew of lesser lights. Then South went in at right half
•when Hugh Gallarneau was slightly hurt, and the top team started to

move as if it meant business. Souths
and Norm Standlee alternated in I
piling up yards with Standlee look- •
ing particularly effective straight j
down the middle.
Later Tiny Thornhil! switched
Standlee to the defensive squad and i
injected Hod Parker, Glenn Hamil- 1
% ton, and Thor Peterson into the of- i
fense. Peterson ran better than he
has for several weeks, while Parker I
blocked well, besides slashing nice !
gains off the tackles. But it was
South's signal calling and general I
all-around fixe that seemed to keep i
the outfit on the move.
Another name was added to j
Thornhill's hospital team as Chet !
Patton, junior reserve center, pulled j
an aVikle out of place and had to be \
carried off to the hospital.
Bill Paulman worked out in a ,
sweat suit, but he still limps badly.
His chances .of playing against U. C. |
L. A. are getting to be slimmer and j
slimmer.
Thornhill gave more men a chance i
to scrimmage yesterday than in any i
previous workout since early fall. 1
Tony Calvelli at center was the only !
regular to play throughout the ses- j
sion. He seems to have shaken all |
Ihe weariness that attacked him '
against Southern California and j
ought to be n-eady for his first full I
game in the southland.
The rest of the first team must i
have been affected with a bad case of
after-game jitters because they were '
playing with a far, far away look in ]
their eyes. The defense consistently i
broke into their secondary, breaking j
up running plays and nabbing i
would-be passers before they could ■
spot their receivers.
