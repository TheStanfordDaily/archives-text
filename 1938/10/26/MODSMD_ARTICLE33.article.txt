# Cage Practice Shows Spirit, Aggressiveness
## New Coach Declares Team Needs Polish, Uphill Battle Ahead 
### 
Practice drills for Stanford's .spir
ited but inexperienced basketball
team are now in full .swing under
the supervision of Head Coach Ever
ett Dean. The new coach, imported
from the University of Indiana, faces
an uphill battle in molding a win
ning combination to tuke the place
of the nationally famous "laughing
boys."
With Phil Zonne the only return
ing member of that renowned quin
tet, Stanford's team will rely on en
thusiasm, spirit, and aggressiveness,
rather than on polish and experience,
to win games. Coach Dean is well
satisfied that his boys do not lack
those qualities, and he is sure that,
win or lose, the team will put on
a show interesting to watch.
Drills thus far and throughout the
whole season will be concentrated
on fundamentals, in order that the
present squad, consisting chiefly of
last year's reserves and freshmen,
will attain the polish necessaiy in a
consistently victorious team. Also
extensive outdoor conditioning
I workouts are being used to equip
the men with the stamina necessary
in the modern fast-breaking game.
Phil Zonne is once more in top
condition, after spending the sum
mer recuperating from a crucial
case of pneumonia. Coach Dean
highly praises Captain Zonne's abil
ity on the maple court, and he cites
Phil as a boy whose leadership
should be an inspiration to the
team.
Tomorrow the team will begin
making a moving picture of basket
ball fundamentals. The picture will
be shown for instructional purposes
at basketball clinics.
