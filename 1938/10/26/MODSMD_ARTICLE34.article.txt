# Berl, Wright Gain Golf Semi-finals
## 
### 
San Jose's annual City Golf Cham
| pionship moves into the semi-final
| round Saturday morning on the mu
j nicipal course with two of the
Farm's outstanding divot diggers,
Dick Wright and Warren Bcii, still
in the running. Finals will be staged
Sunday, and as Wright and Berl are
in opposite brackets, an all-Stanford
final match is highly possible.
Art Doering, University champion,
won the affair last year, but was
| eliminated Sunday when his short
| game went sour. Wright and Berl,
j however, seem to be hitting the ball
1 well in all departments and Coach
! Eddie Twiggs believes either boy
j has at least an even chance of
I bringing home the crown.
