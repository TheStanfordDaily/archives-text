# Foundations for the Boathouse
## 
### 
LETTER by letter and line by line, the hand
writing on the Boathouse wall is becoming
visible enough for even that old girl to see it.
She will begin to shudder within a week or tv/o,
and then totter to the ground.
Final specifications, drawn up by architects
from Dick Spencer's plan, will be down today;
wreckers have already been out to the Boat
house to look the place over.
So, preliminary plans for construction are
being formulated rapidly and definitely; action
will march after on the double.
But though these actions make up the more
immediate phase of building a New Boathouse,
an even more vital part begins today when
officers of all Farm activity groups meet to dis
cuss financial ways-and-means.
That meeting will be an important one. The
problem of financing involves the whole cam
pus, and is a problem which will take the con
certed efforts of all Farm leaders to solve. From
that meeting should come some definite pro
posals to furnish the necessary funds to build
the answer to Stanford's latest dream —the
Boathouse.
But those proposals are still only step num
ber 1. After being made, okayed, and put into
action, the work must be taken over zealously
by the Farm as a whole.
With that support, the Boathouse can stand
as a life-long credit to the enterprise of the
campus as a whole.
Without it, it will still stand.
But on very shaky foundations.
