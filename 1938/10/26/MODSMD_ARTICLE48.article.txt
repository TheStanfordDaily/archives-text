# Roll 'Em Dies
## 
### 
THE charge made yesterday by the comic
opera Dies Committee that three members
of Stanford's faculty are guilty of "boring from
within" is probably cause for mild rejoicing
rather than a bristling counter-attack.
It is good to know that Stanford is a liberal
university. Of course that is all there is to the
charge. All a man needs to do to feature in the
Dies Committee investigation is say "Damn
these flies." Consequently, even a mention of
the word "recession," or a comment that Ameri
can Legionnaires sometimes break shop win
dows while celebrating sounds to the Commit
tee like a call to arms for Fascists, Communists,
and Aimee Semple MacPhersonists.
So, it is no cause for worry that Stanford
made the Dies Committee.
Shirley Temple did too.
