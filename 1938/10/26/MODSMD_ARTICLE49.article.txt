# A.S.U. Still Striding
## 
### 
WITH the quick reaction timing of a lively,
if rather minute body, the A.S.U. has risen
in Campus Opinion to do battle with yester
day's editorial concerning them.
Perhaps because they were not made clear
enough yesterday, a few points should be
clarified at this time. First, The Daily is not
maintaining that Stanford's population should
be made more socially unconscious by curb
ing groups sensible enough to look beyond
Farm walls. It was with that point in mind that
the suggestion was made that consideration
of the coming state election be part of the
A.S.U.'s immediate program.
Fully cognizant of the fact that the A.S.U. is
interested in maintaining impartiality of view
point, the suggestion seems in order. Only a
body holding that theory is in a position to sift,
amplify and clarify the position of candidates
and issues.
Naturally, The Daily had no intention of pro
posing that the A.S.U. confine itself to election
activiiies. But, for those few weeks every two
years - important weeks â€” there is a definite
need at Stanford for v/ork along that line.
The socially conscious body strongly and
rightfully proclaims itself a "factor for the pro
gression of liberal thought everywhere."
God knows, in this State and at this time,
liberal thought is needed.
