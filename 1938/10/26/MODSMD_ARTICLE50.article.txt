\\Q<UPERIOR All-American Honor Rating"—
O that is where the 1938 Stanford Quad
stands among the nation's yearbooks.
And that rating, covering all sections of the
book from photography to budgeting, should
give food for thought to the group which has
been complaining about the financial set-up of
the Quad.
Evidently, the system of salary and bonus
under which Quad workers labor has been de

signed with an unusually careful hand. The in
centive motive of bonus, in the case of last
year's Quad at least, has done what it was
supposed to do —turn out a first-rate book.
But, at the same time, Excom's publication in
vestigating committee will not work on through
the year in vain. Under the same set-up, not
all Quads have been top ranking. And any
system is the better for an overhauling from
time to time.
That, however, is beside the point right now.
The main thing to be said is congratulations to
last year's staff for putting out a fine book.
And best wishes to this year's for following
in their footsteps.
