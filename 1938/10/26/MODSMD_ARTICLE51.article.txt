### JOHN COBBS 
Oil, PROMISE ME
I \URING the past two weeks the scheduled mid
quarter armistice has suspended rushing, bring
ing official quiet to both fraternity and freshman
trenches. But trained observers report frantic maneu
vering and undercover movements of heavy artillery.
No one should be surprised to learn that the creak
ing 3121 switchboard is handling a peak load of in
coming calls, and that most of those filtering past its
inadequacy come from the Row. There is nothing un
usual in the way sleek sedans coast up in tront of
Encitia where dark figures detach from the shadows
and are hustled off into the night. But it is annoying
though not surprising to hear that after the sedans
and the figures make contact, rash promises and im
possible pledges are used to sandbag the freshmen.

A few of the fraternities, it seems, have given up the
direct assault and are making a flank attack with a
heavy fire of promises about "what the house will do
for you."
Their salesmen speak, with well-rehearsed care
lessness, of members on Rally Committee, on the
Quad, in Stagers. And they assure the frosh that
with such backing his only problem will be to choose
whether he wants to be Daily editor or president of
the senior class. It is hoped that after a workout like
this, the freshman, his head spinning and his jaw
drooping at half-mast, will be too weak to resist when
a button is pinned on him. Rich wastrels use the same
technique with poor but proud working gills when
they vow to put their names in lights.

IJROBABLY it is best to view the situation with a
spirit of Christian charity, and tell the offenders
gently to go and sin no more. In rushing, the frater
nity man is faced with a job that is the original sales
manager's nightmare. He has t.T sell intangibles to a
public that, has no idea of what fraternities really are.
If any man has an excuse for rash promises, it is the
Row man who has to finish up with a wavering fresh
man and «et back 1o study for an ex.
But any promise that the house will boost the frosh
to extra-curricular fame is about as valid as an inter
national peace pact. The houses at Stanford can do
practically nothing to influence student activities.
In poiitics the fraternities swap and bargain, and
have an exciting time. But the men who arc nomi
nated have to be "good material." No house has ever
succeeded in putting a man in office unless he had
made himself qualified.

In the publications and in dramatics, the fraternities
don't, bother to keep up the pleasant fiction of influ
ence. Membership in Alpha Alpha Alpha leaves an
Underwood cold. And a ham actor is still a ham re
gardless of the house to which you splice him.
The A.S.S.U. card file is designed to keep Rally
Committee and its step-children pure and untouched
by graft.
There is nothing in the rule book to keep the fra
ternities from making any promises they like. But
the freshmen would be happier if they remembered
that in rushing as in courtship, conversations can't be
taken literally.
