# Lightly... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
| A COUPLE of (he Kills have been working over in
the costume lab of the theater nearly every
afternoon this quarter, and they have found that it's
a fine thing if they have an apple to cat every day at
4 o'clock. A pick-up without a let-down, they say.
The other day they took their apples over with
them and put them in the green room, where they
would go to cat them at 4. And at 4, with their con
ditioned reflexes working perfectly, they headed for
1 the green room and their apples—and found a nickel
lying on the table where the apples had been. And
J only one nickel at that.
What a cad.

There are friends of mine whose standard for judg
ing women is simply whether they play bridge or not.
The better they play, the higher their rating is.
Imagine that.

I was talking to a guy today who told me a story
I hadn't heard about an old friend of mine who was
taking the physical exam for the C.C.C. The doctor
who was going to give him his eye test took him into
a room and told him to read a certain line of letters
on the test chart at the other end of the room.
My friend, who is a little bad in the eyes and a
little absent-minded, started looking slowly but care
fully around the room. He was looking for the chart.

tention under the disguise of doing it on a bet or
some similar device, one of our Stanford girls went
around to every booth in the Union last night attempt
ing to sell a dog. The gill had a nice line. The dog
had a nice pedigree. Both the girl and the dog had
nice smiles.
When she had been to all the booths and had ab
sorbed a sufficient amount of attention, the bet was
paid: a package of cigarettes and a coke.
It's my guess that she would endorse either. Free.

Overheard (a little bit indirectly): A guy on the
Quad asking another guy, "How did you do in your
business law exam?"
"Swell."
"What did vou i.'et?"
"Four above class average," the guy answered
triumphantly.
"Hey. swell. What was class average?"
"Oh, they all flunked."
And he still thinks he got a good grade.
Two clays ago one of the gals in a sorority woke
up everyone on the sleeping porch at fi;3o o'clock in
the morning by falling out of bod. Tin- sisters woke
| up to find her sitting on the floor laughing her head
j off She thought it wa* awfully funny.
Wait'll she does it again. «•«

Overheard (a little bit indirectly): A guy on the
Quad asking another guy, "How did you do in your
business law exam?"
"Swell."
"What did vou i.'et?"
"Four above class average," the guy answered
triumphantly.
"Hey. swell. What was class average?"
"Oh, they all flunked."
And he still thinks he got a good grade.

| A COUPLE of (he Kills have been working over in
the costume lab of the theater nearly every
afternoon this quarter, and they have found that it's
a fine thing if they have an apple to cat every day at
4 o'clock. A pick-up without a let-down, they say.
The other day they took their apples over with
them and put them in the green room, where they
would go to cat them at 4. And at 4, with their con
ditioned reflexes working perfectly, they headed for
1 the green room and their apples—and found a nickel
lying on the table where the apples had been. And
J only one nickel at that.
What a cad.

There are friends of mine whose standard for judg

The better they play, the higher their rating is.
Imagine that.

I was talking to a guy today who told me a story
I hadn't heard about an old friend of mine who was
taking the physical exam for the C.C.C. The doctor
who was going to give him his eye test took him into
a room and told him to read a certain line of letters
on the test chart at the other end of the room.
My friend, who is a little bad in the eyes and a
little absent-minded, started looking slowly but care
fully around the room. He was looking for the chart.

tention under the disguise of doing it on a bet or
some similar device, one of our Stanford girls went
around to every booth in the Union last night attempt
ing to sell a dog. The gill had a nice line. The dog
had a nice pedigree. Both the girl and the dog had
nice smiles.
When she had been to all the booths and had ab
sorbed a sufficient amount of attention, the bet was
paid: a package of cigarettes and a coke.
It's my guess that she would endorse either. Free.
