# Fire Aboard Luxury Ship Controlled
## Dangerous Blaze On Deutschland Finally Extinguished 
### 
NEW YORK, Wednesday, Oct. 26
(UP). —The fire which burned for
more than six hours on the German
luxury liner Deutschland, of! New
foundland, has been brought under
control according to radio messages
from the vessel early today.
Radios from the ship to Hamburg
and Canadian stations said that the
danger was past at 1 a.m., Eastern
Standard Time.
Coast Guard headquarters at Bos
ton announced that Captain Carl
Steinecke radioed the Canadian tug
"Foundation Franklin" that the fire
was under control and it was not
necessary for the tug to proceed to
the scene with fire-fighting equip
ment.
A message to the line office in
Hamburg said there was no danger
and none were injured.
Six vessels raced over the North
Atlantic toward the stricken vessel
as the Deutschland's signal crackled
at regular intervals, indicating that
the fire was out of control and the
danger mounting.
The vessel's first distress signal,
intercepted by Radiomarine at 6:22
p.m., E.S.T., said fire had broken out
and had become "dangerous" and
asked for immediate aid. At 7:45 p.m.
the stricken liner, with 591 passen
gers and a crew of 369 aboard,
flashed a signal to the nearest ves
sels:
"Proceed to our assistance for
eventual taking off of passengers."
Officials in New York said the
Deutschland had enough lifeboats,
including motor boats and rafts, to
accommodate the entire passenger
list and crew.
At 8 p.m. it was said that the
Deutschland's radio telephone circuit
still was working, but was tied up
with calls to other vessels.
THREE SHIPS NEAR
At that time there were three ves
sels less than 90 miles from the burn
ing liner. These were the Norwe
gian liner Europe, approximately
65 miles away, and the American
freighters Collamer and American
Traveler. The latter radioed its posi
tion at 7 p.m. as 110 miles away and
the Colamer was 86 miles east of
the Deutschland at 7:30 p.m.
The 21,046-ton luxury liner, curv
ing dov/n over the North Atlantic
on the great circle route, bound for
New York, was 200 miles southeast
of Cape Race, Nfd., when she first
reported herself in distress.
None of the rescue vessels was in
a position to reach her before mid
night. Also in the vicinity, but too
far away to do much good, were
the American Farmer, the Cunard
liner Laconia and the French
freighter Minerva.
The Deutschland is equipped with
modern fire-fighting apparatus and
fireproof bulkheads.

ing liner. These were the Norwe
gian liner Europe, approximately
65 miles away, and the American
freighters Collamer and American
Traveler. The latter radioed its posi
tion at 7 p.m. as 110 miles away and
the Colamer was 86 miles east of
the Deutschland at 7:30 p.m.
The 21,046-ton luxury liner, curv
ing dov/n over the North Atlantic
on the great circle route, bound for
New York, was 200 miles southeast
of Cape Race, Nfd., when she first
reported herself in distress.
None of the rescue vessels was in
a position to reach her before mid
night. Also in the vicinity, but too
far away to do much good, were
the American Farmer, the Cunard
liner Laconia and the French
freighter Minerva.
The Deutschland is equipped with
modern fire-fighting apparatus and
fireproof bulkheads.
NEW YORK, Wednesday, Oct. 26
(UP). —The fire which burned for
more than six hours on the German
luxury liner Deutschland, of! New
foundland, has been brought under
control according to radio messages
from the vessel early today.
Radios from the ship to Hamburg
and Canadian stations said that the
danger was past at 1 a.m., Eastern
Standard Time.
Coast Guard headquarters at Bos
ton announced that Captain Carl
Steinecke radioed the Canadian tug
"Foundation Franklin" that the fire
was under control and it was not
necessary for the tug to proceed to
the scene with fire-fighting equip
ment.
A message to the line office in
Hamburg said there was no danger
and none were injured.
Six vessels raced over the North
Atlantic toward the stricken vessel
as the Deutschland's signal crackled
at regular intervals, indicating that
the fire was out of control and the
danger mounting.
The vessel's first distress signal,
intercepted by Radiomarine at 6:22
p.m., E.S.T., said fire had broken out
and had become "dangerous" and
asked for immediate aid. At 7:45 p.m.
the stricken liner, with 591 passen
gers and a crew of 369 aboard,
flashed a signal to the nearest ves
sels:
"Proceed to our assistance for
eventual taking off of passengers."
Officials in New York said the
Deutschland had enough lifeboats,
including motor boats and rafts, to
accommodate the entire passenger
list and crew.
At 8 p.m. it was said that the
Deutschland's radio telephone circuit
still was working, but was tied up
with calls to other vessels.
THREE SHIPS NEAR
At that time there were three ves
sels less than 90 miles from the burn
ing liner. These were the Norwe
gian liner Europe, approximately
65 miles away, and the American
freighters Collamer and American
Traveler. The latter radioed its posi
tion at 7 p.m. as 110 miles away and
the Colamer was 86 miles east of
the Deutschland at 7:30 p.m.
