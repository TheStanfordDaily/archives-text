# Encina Chiselers Remove Spots
## 
### 
Yesterday at 9:30 a.m. a
"model A" Ford squeaked into
the bull-pen parking space at
Encina, unloaded a long lad
der and two men, and rattled
away again. The overall-clad
men hoisted the ladder into
place beside the westernmost
window of Room 238. One of
them ascended armed with a
hammer, a chisel, and a big
wire brush. Soon the Encina
din was punctuated rhythmic
ally by the sound of steel on
stone. This lasted all of 20 min
utes, at the end of which time
the newly chipped stone receiv
ed a brushing down, the man
descended, and the ladder was
removed.
It seems they were removing
ink stains.
