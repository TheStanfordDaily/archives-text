# Peace Appeal Voiced by F.R.
## Makes Strong Plea For National Unity 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 (UP). —
President Roosevelt tonight reaf
firmed this nation's desire for
peace, called on the world powers
to disarm, and warned that until
they did the United States has no
other alternative but to increase its
naval and military forces.
In a speech carried over the na
tion-wide facilities of the Columbia
and National Broadcasting Compa
nies, the President rejected the idea
of force as a permanent necessity
and as an ideal of life. He cautioned
"you cannot organize civilization
around the core of militarism and at
the same time expect reason to con
trol human destinies."
But, he said, this country must be
prepared to meet "with success" any
application of force against us. The
chief executive said the American
democracy still insists an armament
race among nations is absurd "un
less new territories or new controls
are coveted."
"We are entitled. I think, to
greater assurance than can be given
by words, "the kind of proof which
can be given, for example, by actual
discussions, leading to actual dis
armament," he said. "Not otherwise
can we be relieved of the necessity
of increasing our own military and
naval establishments."
The chief executive made a strong
plea for national unity not only in
promoting world peace and re
straint, but for the settlement of
American domestic problems.
"Let us work with greater unity
for peace among nations of the
world, for restraint, for negotiation
and for community efforts," he said.
"Let us work for the same ideals
within our own borders in our re
lations with each other, so that we
may, if the test ever comes, have
the unity of will with which alone a
democracy can successfully meet its
enemies."
