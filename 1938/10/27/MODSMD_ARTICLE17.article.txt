# Forensic Tilt To Conclude Next Week
## 
### 
First round of the Intramural In
trasquad debate tournament will be
completed by the end of next week,
according to Jack Strain, debate
manager, and results of these deci
sions will determine the contestants
competing in the semi-finals begin
ning November 7.
Hinging a good deal on the re
sults of these tryouts will be the
selection of debaters for the San
Quent in meet to be held December 4.
According to Strain, membership on
this team will not be definitely set
up as an award to winners of the
present tourney, but those finishing
in the upper brackets will merit
consideration. The Anglo-Amei-ican
question, to be debated at San
Quentin, is one of the two offered to
intramural tryoutees.
These tryouts are being conducted
by the Stanford chapter of Delta
Sigma Rho, national honorary debat
ing society, under the supervision of
Bob Curtiss, president. Contests
will be judged by members of Delta
Sigma Rho and other prominent
local debaters.
