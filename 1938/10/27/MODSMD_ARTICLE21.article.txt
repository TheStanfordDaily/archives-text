# Cardinals Plan Weekend Hop For Boathouse
## First of Series Will Feature Secrest; Big Game Jolly-up Set 
### 
Out of the blue there's going to '
be a dance here on the Farm Satur- j
day nightâ€”a dance which the cam- j
pus will want to be the biggest dance j
of the quarter.
Because it's a dance with a noble j
purpose.
It is a dance to help build the |
boathouse.
Decided on in Ex Committee j
Tuesday night and put in the charge ;
of Cardinals, the dance will be held
in the Women's Gym from 9-12
o'clock Saturday night.
Bids, costing $1, can be bought
Friday all day at the A.S.S.U. of
fices and at the door Saturday night. ;
SERIES SLATED
It will be called the "Boathouse
Dance," and it will be the first of a
series of "Boathouse Dances." All
profit from it, and future A.S.S.U.
dances, will go to the new boat
house.
Ozzie Secrest will bring his or
chestra back to the Farm for the
third time this quarter to attend to
the musical end of the evening. Oz- j
zie and the boys have been tried;
and found true before this quarter j
both at the Oregon game dance and
at the transfer women's jolly-up.
COMMITTEE NAMED
In Cardinals' meeting last night,
plans for the dance were rounded
out, a new dance committee of
Woodie Miller, chairman, Mary
Morris Boggs, and Dick Frank was
chosen.
Also discussed in Cardinals
meeting were plans for Big Game
week. Aside from the already-de
cided-on Big Game bonfire on the !
lake-bed Thursday night of that j
week, they worked on a jolly-up to !
be sandwiched in that Friday be- j
tween the afternoon and evening
performances of the Gaieties.
Because Cardinals are trying to
get Art McCue for the jolly-up and |
because McCue may play for the
Gaieties, the Gaieties afternoon per
formance may have to be pushed up
to 1 o'clock starting time.
BIG NAME
But in case this can't be swung
and they can't get Art McCue, who
established his reputation on the
campus with his work at the Spring
Show last year, a Big Name band
will probably be brought down from
the City.
But it is definite that: (a) there
will be a big jolly-up the Friday be
fore the Big Game, (b) there will be
no on-campus dance Big Game
i night. There isn't enough popular
appeal, Cardinals believes, to war
rant a dance that night.
Because Ex Committee ratified
Cardinals' proposed date of 7-10 of
November for the annual Red Cross
Drive, Committeemen Rovena Conn
and Woodie Miller were instructed
j last night, to lay preliminary plans
I for the drive.
