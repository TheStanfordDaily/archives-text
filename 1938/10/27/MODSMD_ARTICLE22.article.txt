WASHINGTON, Oct. 26 (UP).â€”
Secretary of Commerce Daniel C.
Roper today warned the nation's
business men against premature
price increases which would halt
trade recovery by placing products
beyond the pockctbooks of consum
ers.
The warning, directed chiefly at
durable goods industries, came as the
Federal Reserve Board reported in
a seven-week business summary
that prices of a num,bcr of industrial
raw materials advanced from the
middle of September to the third
week of October.
