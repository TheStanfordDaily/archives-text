# 'Boathouse Days' Drive Planned
## Student Leaders Meet to Consider Program for Financial Campaign 
### 
With all plans tentative as yet, campus activity leaders meeting yester
day to consider ways and means to finance the new Boathouse decided
to concentrate the fund drive into one or two "Boathouse Days."
Rather than drag fund solicitation out over «u loiir period until "the
school is sick of it," a full program of events will be offered, probably on

a Friday, with further events sched
uled the following Saturday, and
culminating with an all-campus
dance that night.
Initial consideration set December
2 and 3 for the tentative dates of
the "Boathouse Days," when the
whole Farm will take part in finan
cially building a new structure.
EVENTS TENTATIVE
Program events are as yet merely
tentative, but, if ideas brought up
in the meeting yesterday are fol
lowed, Friday's program will in
clude a "brunch" and huge Carni
val in the afternoon, dinner in the
evening, a program of entertainment
featuring Gaieties stars, and pos
sibly some sort of canoe raffle.
Prospects for holding intramural
football championship playoff the
next afternoon were discussed. The
two-day drive will be concluded
with "the best dance of the year."
Other methods of supplying nec
essary funds were suggested — con
tributions from classes and from the
profits received in campus functions,
Sunday night movies, and Nitory
jolly-ups. If these means are used,
they probably will be done without
tagging the name "Boathouse" on
the contribution as it is raised, but
will later be allocated if organiza
tions so desire.
FLAN DRIVE
To be appointed in the near fu
ture is the chairman to handle the
Boathouse Days drive, and the com
mittee to work under him. Charles
Prince, president of Axe Society, be
lieved that the society would con
tribute members to aid in the drive.
Activity leaders called together by
Student Body President H. B. Lee
yesterday included Tom Killefer,
student manager; Betty Davis, vice
president of A.S.S.U.; Putzie Hin
ricks, head lioble sponsor; Roy
Thompson, head of Cardinals; Caro
lyn Hibbard, president of Women's
Conference; Dave Ryus, Ken Cuth
bertson, and Park Kimball, presi
dents of the senior, junior, and
sophomore classes.
