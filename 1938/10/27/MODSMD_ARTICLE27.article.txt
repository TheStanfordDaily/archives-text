II can't be done for nothing, but
it is possible to travel for very little,
according to Judd Sturtevant, Stan
lord student, who spoke on "Around
and About for Practically Nothing"
at yesterday's meeting of the Lunch
eon Club.
Accompanied by two other stu
dents, Sturtevant traveled for a year
in 35 different countries. It did cost
something, because of the fact that
before entering a country it is nec
essary to sign a pledge which pre
vents one from taking a job that
could be given to a native.
Starting from San Francisco on a
Grace Line boat, steerage class, the
trio traveled through the Panama
Canal to New York, where they
joined the International Student
Federation. This made it possible to
travel at a 50 per cent reduction by
presenting one's student passport.
Using small French % bicycles for
transportation and staying at Youth
Hostels which provide a bed and
three meals for 50 cents, they trav
eled through Europe to Switzerland.
Here it was possible for them to
travel by train, bus, or boat as far
as they wanted over a period of
eight days at a cost of only $10.
Included in their itinerary was
Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary,
Albania, Egypt, Palestine, Iran,
Greece, and Italy. They returned to
England via Scandinavia, having

spent the longest time in Greece.
"Switzerland has the highest per j
capita wealth in the world, despite
the fact that it is one of the 'have- j
not' countries, greatly lacking in i
natural resources," said Sturtevant. '
"Hungary was the friendliest coun- j
try we visited. In fact, they are at
tempting to regain their world status
by friendliness."
"The most interesting place, in my |
opinion," continued Sturtevant, "was!
Mount Athos in the Aegean Sea. j
This is a holy island made so foe- !
cause of a visit by the Virgin Mary |
on her way to the Holy Land. It is
inhabited entirely by monks who |
never cut their hair and spend 13
hours a day in prayer.
"One monk ,who had not shaved j
for 15 years, was formerly employed |
as assistant chef at the Palace |
Hotel."
Next week's Luncheon Club j
speaker will be President Ray Ly

natural resources," said Sturtevant. '
"Hungary was the friendliest coun- j
try we visited. In fact, they are at
tempting to regain their world status
by friendliness."
"The most interesting place, in my |
opinion," continued Sturtevant, "was!
Mount Athos in the Aegean Sea. j
This is a holy island made so foe- !
cause of a visit by the Virgin Mary |
on her way to the Holy Land. It is
inhabited entirely by monks who |
never cut their hair and spend 13
hours a day in prayer.

for 15 years, was formerly employed |

II can't be done for nothing, but
it is possible to travel for very little,
according to Judd Sturtevant, Stan
lord student, who spoke on "Around
and About for Practically Nothing"
at yesterday's meeting of the Lunch
eon Club.
Accompanied by two other stu
dents, Sturtevant traveled for a year
in 35 different countries. It did cost
something, because of the fact that
before entering a country it is nec
essary to sign a pledge which pre
vents one from taking a job that
could be given to a native.
Starting from San Francisco on a
Grace Line boat, steerage class, the
trio traveled through the Panama
Canal to New York, where they
joined the International Student
Federation. This made it possible to
travel at a 50 per cent reduction by
presenting one's student passport.
Using small French % bicycles for
transportation and staying at Youth
Hostels which provide a bed and
three meals for 50 cents, they trav
eled through Europe to Switzerland.
Here it was possible for them to
travel by train, bus, or boat as far
as they wanted over a period of
eight days at a cost of only $10.
Included in their itinerary was
Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary,
Albania, Egypt, Palestine, Iran,
Greece, and Italy. They returned to
England via Scandinavia, having

spent the longest time in Greece.
"Switzerland has the highest per j
capita wealth in the world, despite
the fact that it is one of the 'have- j
not' countries, greatly lacking in i
natural resources," said Sturtevant. '
