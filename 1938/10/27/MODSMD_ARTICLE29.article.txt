# Farm Women List Vocational Aims in Survey
## Questionaires Show Preference in Art, Business Careers 
### 
Most Stanford women look for
ward to a career in either business
or art, according to the results of
the vocational interest questionnaires
distributed in all women's living
groups except Roble Monday night.
The questionnaire was given out
by the Vocational Guidance com-
mittee, which has tabulated the re
sults, with a view to determining
in what fields their programs will
concentrate this year.
LIST PREFERENCES
Favorite specific fields were per
sonnel management, which 31 wom
en indicated as their first preference
arid over 60 definitely considered,
and interior decorating, which 27
women listed as first choice.
Twenty-two women indicated,
under the heading of "General Sug-
gestions to the Committee," that
secretarial courses should be given
at Stanford. A number of these said
they would be willing to take them
without credit. As a result of this,
the Committee is considering issu
ing a second questionnaire to all
women on this specific question.
PLAN INITIAL MEET
The first vocational program of the
year will be held early in January,
and will probably be on the general
field of education, with attention to
more specific work within the field,
such as training of handicapped chil
dren and adult education.
There is a position open for a
sophomore woman on the committee,
and all those interested should get
in touch with Gretchen Gillespie at
the Union.
