CONTRIBUTIONS MADE
The 2,449 alumni, students, and
friends of the University who gave
last spring turned in their contribu
tions through what is called the an
nual appeal of the Stanford Fund.
This, however, is just one branch of
the fund's activities. Another
branch is under the direction of an !
alumni Committee on Special Gilts,!
Trusts, and Bequests.
Assisting the Special Gifts commit
tee are 296 Stanford doctors and
lawyers in San Francisco, Alameda,
and Los Angeles counties. They
were enlisted last year under a plan,
conceived by Louis H. Roseberry,
'03, vice-president and manager of
the trust department of the Security-
First National Bank of Los Angeles,
for interesting potential donors in
the opportunities Stanford offers for
putting gifts to worthwhile uses.
ALUMNI BACK PROGRAM
Already the Special Gifts commit
tee's work js beginning to show sub
stantial results far beyond expecta
tions, according to the Bulletin.
The alumni are supporting the
Stanford Fund program because they
believe that privately endowed, po
litically uncontrolled universities
are worthy of support. Fund heads
believe the biggest part of the edu
cational job that is done here is done
by University funds â€” endowment
income and yearly gifts. This pays
about 55 per cent of the total cost of
operating the University, and tuition
j and incidental fees pay the remain
ling 45 per cent.
