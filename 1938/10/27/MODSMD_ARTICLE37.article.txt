### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
/ kRCHIDS today to Dick Stepp,
Daily business manager, and
Tom Killefer, student manager, who
have made it possible for students
who will not be in Los Angeles this
week-end to get the inside dope on
what the Big Red Machine is doing.
For the first time in Stanford publi
cations history, the sports editor will
be sent to cover the Southern grid
contest.

/ "LAYTON FRYE is teaching them
to punch.
Entering his second year as var
sity boxing mentor, Frye is in a
good position to turn out some good
fighters. Since boxing demands long,
patient work of coach and fighter, no
coach can be expected to build a
championship team his first yearâ€”it
takes time.
In fact, three years is considered
in boxing circles as the time re
quired for a coach to bring a man
to his peak. But Frye worked dili
gently last year with boys that were
glad to have his help, and it appears
now that some will reach their peak
in their second year with a new
coach.
There is certain satisfaction in
winning the heavyweight bouts, and

that is where the
Indians' strength
will lie next win
ter.
JOHNNY
WARD will be
Stanford's main
hope when boxing
season rolls
around. He is

large, strong, and a last hitter, and
when he pounds the punching bag,
it looks as though it will sail right
out into space.
Stanford didn't enter the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiates at Sacramento
last April, but from the ringside it
looked as though nobody in the ring,
winner included, could be a decent
sparring partner for Ward.
Getting down below the 179-pound
mark, we find a capable threat in
HUGH GALLARNEAU and DUB
BER SAUNDERS. They fought out
Ihe all-University battle last year,
and although Gallarneau finally
emerged with the crown, it looked
like anybody's battle.
Gallarneau uses the same south
paw that adds deception to the
Stanford football team to deceive
his opponents in the ring. He has a
right-handed stance, but his left
does the work. He fights scientific
ally, and his body punches make his
opponents wish they had worn a
bunch of pillows. Saunders is a good
two-handed fighter, with a left hook
and a powerful right.
HERB GUNN will be back in the
junior light-heavies after a year on
the ringside with an injured thumb.
If the leather guard that now pro
tects his thumb does the trick, Coach
Frye need worry no longer about
his 165-pound possibilities. DOUG
GRANT, left-hander who is already
a fine boxer after first taking it up
last winter, and JOHNNY RYAN,
who had experience in elimination
bouts of last year's novice tourney,
complete the 165-pound list.
BILL WILBUR will give plenty of
opponents middleweight worries
next season unless he loses enough
weight to move down to the next
class. With a doubtful right hand
improving fast, Wilbur's unusual

determination will make him win
most of his bouts.
JACK RICE made a name for him
self in the Cal bouts here last year.
Rice is a good puncher, and will
handle the welterweight division
capably. CHARLES McINTYRE
will strengthen the 145-pound class
for the Cards.
808 HOVEY. who fought for the
Indians last year, and PARK KIM
BALL, who may find himself a wel
terweight by winter, are outstanding
candidates at 135-pounds.
While the light divisions are still
more or less open, LARRY WINTEH,
BRUCE BERG, and PAUL SPAIN
will be in there fighting.
Most Stanford opponents, includ
ing Cal, U.C.L.A., and Cal Aggies,
will be unchanged next winter, and
the Cards will be considerably bel
ter. So it looks like a good season
in the ring.
