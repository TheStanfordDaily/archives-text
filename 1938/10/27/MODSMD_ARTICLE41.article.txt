# Soccer Regulars Prepare for Tilt
## 
### 
Preparing for their first off-cam
pus tilt of the season, Coach Harry
Maloney's soccer regulars held an
extensive drill yesterday afternoon
to get in first class offensive shape
for San Jose State.
The game will be held at San Jose's
home field Saturday.
Tuesday the squad reserves prac
ticed on both offensive and defen
sive plays, with the entire group
showing up well in all departments.
Lineups for the San Jose encoun
ter will presumably be the same that
started the last game. The forward
wall of Sadullah, Gerbstedt, Di√üene
ditti, and Santum, with the first two
engaged in a hot fight for team
scoring honors, will probably see
action during most of the game.
