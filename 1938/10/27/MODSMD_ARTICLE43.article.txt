injured in yesterday's workout and
he may not see action for the re
mainder of the season. It is thought
a bone in one of his fingers may be
broken.
Thornton for the past two days has
put his squad through scrimmages
against the reserves with an eye to
developing a defense that will be
good enough to stop the Trojan at
tack built around Paul Wolf, swim
ming star of the l ( J3(j Olympic
Games.
FROSH MEET PALY HIGH
Meanwhile the undefeated frosh
squad has been preparing for its en
counter against Paly High in the pre

of offensive punch in Forwards Had

If records mean anything, the
frosh should have an easy time tak
