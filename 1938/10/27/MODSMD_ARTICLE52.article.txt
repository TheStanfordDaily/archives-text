# Bruins Shelve Passes, Reveal Running Attack
## Ledeboer, Standlee To Lead Card Attack; Donahue May Start 
### 
The vaunted U.C.L.A. aerial cir
cus has turned out to be something
of a second-rate side-show now that
the Bruins have discovered that they
have a running attack.
Last Saturday, Coach Bill Spaul
ding fielded a team that snowed un
der undefeated Idaho 33-0 and they
threw only six passes in doing it.
Two of these connected for the gi
gantic sum of 20 yards. Considering
that they gained 329 all told, their
passing attack just wasn't.
TWO GREAT BACKS
What has brought the Bruins to
life more than anything else has
been the discovery that they have in
Hal Hirshon and Kenny Washing
ton two of the smoothest running
backs on the Coast. Washington, the
dusky halfback whose chief fame
has been an ability to throw home
run passes in the Bruins' early wins
this season, finally showed his real
worth past the scrimmage line.
Someone down there has taken
the Uclans in hand and taught them
how to block offensively, so well in
fact that Washington got away for
runs of 46 and 47 yards among other
things against the Vandals. It looks
like the days of their desperate pass
and pray system is on the shelf for
good.
Stanford's air game still is proving
to be its main offense. The Indians
haven't shown a sustained drive on
the ground all season.
STANDLEE IN SHAPE
Freddie Ledeboer and Norm
Standlee will both be in top shape
for the southern trip, and they may
be able to beat the Bruins on the
ground. Ledeboer is without ques
tion the toughest light back in the
conference, while Standlee is finally
shaking off all the ill effects of a
sprained ankle.
The big sophomore was really
pouring the pressure hist night in an
other extended scrimmage. He may
not be a Nevers yet but he still
has two years to make the grade.
Corky Donahue was warming the
turf in street clothes as he nursed a
game wrist. Donahue pulled some
ligaments in his arm Wednesday but
should be ready to go Saturday.
