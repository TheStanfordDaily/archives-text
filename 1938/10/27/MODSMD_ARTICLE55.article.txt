# Something's Bruin

### 
THE Big Red Machine starts rolling for
U.C.L.A. tonight and what's needed more
than anything to insure smooth running on
Saturday is a big crowd at the Paly station to
put it on the tracks and push it south with
plenty of preliminary momentum.
The roller begins its first off-campus trek at
the head of the Row, will end up across the
Bruin goal line some few times on Saturday.
But if nobody thinks so tonight, the old roll
er's liable to siall half-way there.
What sports and edit writers think of their
chances to win the game means nothing—both
are fallible. But this much is certain: in the
games played so far, Stanford has been up
against far tougher teams than the southern
Bruins.
Stanford carries the edge, and it's a sharp
one.
It also carries a line-up that, despite the ab
sence of two of its first-string men, has the
material and the fight to win hands down.
What the team lacks right now is morale; it
feels damn low because of last Saturday. The
campus must show it has forgotten the Trojan
win and put collective muscle behind the raised
tomahawk—there's Bruin meat loose.—H. L. S.
