# Strike Up the Band

### 
WHEN Ex Committee voted in a New Boat
house, this column proclaimed dancing in
the streets and merriment of diverse nature in
celebration.
That proclamation still goes, as activity lead
ers meeting yesterday to consider financing
problems decided. If initial plans work out as
brightly as the group expects, merriment is
just exactly what the Farm will have for two
short, sweet days.
Carnival, Brunch, barbecue, entertainment,
intramural football, and a dance which should
set the campus back on its heels for a while to
come.
Merriment.
And why not? Stanford doesn't get a New
Boathouse every year.
