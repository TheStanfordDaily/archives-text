DISTRIBUTED this morning with about half
the copies of The Daily are copies of the

Because alumni support, ever increasing, will

a University moving progressively to greater
educational heights and one which remains
struggling along at a middle level of develop
ment.
In those bulletins are the records of that
alumni support, records building a trend curve
which slopes definitely upward. In that trend
curve is the breakdown of a large part of
Stanford's future.
