# War on Peace
## 
### 
THAT word "peace" is in again, and earlier
this year than last. Ex Committee announced
yesterday that two members from the student
body at large were to be appointed to the
Peace Council to swell the ranks of those al
ready chosen from various campus groups.
With each successive year, that word peace
means more and more. Vivid in the memories
of the Farm should be the near-cataclysm a
few weeks ago when Hitler marched into Cze
choslovakia. But it probably isn't. Probably
peace is still as vague a notion as ever.
But with the early start this year, Peace Day
should amount to more than a few hours of
discussion, discussion v/hich usually wrangles
all around the point but fails to accomplish
much.
It would seem that so far the concept of
peace has been a passive rather than active
one. Hence, round-house briefs for collective
security, isolationism, Fascism, Communism,
and Democracy befog the picture, using the
word peace for a take-off and then forgetting
all about it.
If, instead, all the energy used to uphold a
political theory were expended on promoting
a psychology and attitude of peace, something
might be accomplished. But it isn't.
Christopher Morley had the right idea in his
book ' Peace with Honor" when he said that
there would be peace as soon as the people
wanted it. That puts it about as simply and as
realistically as possible—"peace if you want
it. Consequently, all the hubbub involved in
upholding collective security, isolationism, or
anything else is just so much waste motion.
But that concept is too idealistic for this com
promising age. Rather would political and eco

nomic theorists consider it to be fact that the
world must have one of the mass of -isms be
fore it gets peace.
They want to go toward their goal by the
most cumbersome and lengthy route. They
uphold their own favored path with vehemence
and logic until Plato couldn't decide between
them. Reasonably, they all sound right—except
that they never lead to peace.
So which are you going to take? Peace, or a
handful of sure-fire panaceas which may,
sooner or later, lead in the right direction?—
if the world doesn't forget about it in the mean
time fighting to uphold some particular solu
tion.
Peace looks like the easiest way out.

With each successive year, that word peace
means more and more. Vivid in the memories
of the Farm should be the near-cataclysm a
few weeks ago when Hitler marched into Cze
choslovakia. But it probably isn't. Probably
peace is still as vague a notion as ever.
But with the early start this year, Peace Day
should amount to more than a few hours of
discussion, discussion v/hich usually wrangles
all around the point but fails to accomplish
much.
It would seem that so far the concept of
peace has been a passive rather than active
one. Hence, round-house briefs for collective
security, isolationism, Fascism, Communism,
and Democracy befog the picture, using the
word peace for a take-off and then forgetting
all about it.
If, instead, all the energy used to uphold a
political theory were expended on promoting
a psychology and attitude of peace, something
might be accomplished. But it isn't.
Christopher Morley had the right idea in his
book ' Peace with Honor" when he said that
there would be peace as soon as the people
wanted it. That puts it about as simply and as
realistically as possible—"peace if you want
it. Consequently, all the hubbub involved in
upholding collective security, isolationism, or
anything else is just so much waste motion.
But that concept is too idealistic for this com
promising age. Rather would political and eco

nomic theorists consider it to be fact that the
world must have one of the mass of -isms be
fore it gets peace.
They want to go toward their goal by the
most cumbersome and lengthy route. They
uphold their own favored path with vehemence
and logic until Plato couldn't decide between
them. Reasonably, they all sound right—except
that they never lead to peace.
So which are you going to take? Peace, or a
handful of sure-fire panaceas which may,
sooner or later, lead in the right direction?—
if the world doesn't forget about it in the mean
time fighting to uphold some particular solu
tion.
Peace looks like the easiest way out.
