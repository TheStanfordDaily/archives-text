### JOHN COBBS 
RED HEARINGS
A S THE DAILY pointed out yesterday morning,
Stanford is entitled to a grade A glow of pride
because three of its professors have made the Dies
Committee honor roll. With our editor, I share this
happiness, like a prize-lighter's mother who hears
over the radio, "Hello, Ma. I'm glad I won." But my
pleasure is tinged with melancholy. For in thus care
lessly bestowing the honor of senatorial investiga
tion, the Dies Committee has shattered one of my
major ambitions.
For two years now, I have been trying to make the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce red list. That
goal has spurred me ever since the winter of 1937,
when Daily Editor Bob Eisenbach came beaming into
the Shack and announced with radiant modesty that
he had been awarded the recognition.
* * * *
The chamber of commerce red list is the Phi Beta
Kappa of college journalists. It gives every man on
it definite proof that he has at least one thought for
himself. It is the honor roll of men who have demon
strated that they manage to keep a reasonably open
mind despite the American Legion and the grammar
school civics texts. When a college newspaper man
fails to make the red list, it shows that he is simply
a sounding board for convention, that he is as drably
uninspired as public school architecture.
And so for two years I have tried to make the list.
It has been a long, hard fight, because I was very
impressionable as a child and swallowed unquestion
ingly all the pretty slogans I read in the Hearst papers.
But I started this year with the feeling that I was
about to succeed. I was sure that before June I
could demonstrate at least the minimum of broad
mindedness necessary to annoy the bigots.
# * * *
what distinction is there in a mere red list
when three Stanford professors can make the
minutes of a senatorial investigating committee with
out trying. I feel like a man who angles for an invi
tation to join the Rotary Club, and suddenly discovers
that a neighbor he cut dead has made the social
register.
Personally I think the whole thing is unjust. The
professors don't deserve the honor. Dean Kefauver, for
instance, wears neat double-breasted gray suits and
combs his hair fiat. The man doesn't even look like a
Communist in disguise. Worse than that, he wears
rimless glasses. Any grammar school child knows that
no self-respecting Communist will wear anything but
horn-rimmed glasses. And the committee is obviously
working with a grammar school child's definitions.
* * * IS
The committee doesn't tell us what our professors
did to rate mention. But it couldn't have been any
thing really important. Probably they said that Hearst
papers sometimes deal rather cavalierly with news,
or implied that all the American Legionaires were not
in the front line trenches.
It does no good to say that the witnesses at the
investigation are meddlesome fools and that the com
mittee acts like something out of a Gaieties skit. It is
no help to say that our professors haven't qualified,
that they couldn t poison a mind with cyanide.
The Dies Committee has shattered my dream. A
mere led list depreciates to zero when professors
who mind their own business are read into the minutes
of a Senate committee.

because three of its professors have made the Dies
Committee honor roll. With our editor, I share this
happiness, like a prize-lighter's mother who hears
over the radio, "Hello, Ma. I'm glad I won." But my
pleasure is tinged with melancholy. For in thus care
lessly bestowing the honor of senatorial investiga
tion, the Dies Committee has shattered one of my
major ambitions.
For two years now, I have been trying to make the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce red list. That
goal has spurred me ever since the winter of 1937,
when Daily Editor Bob Eisenbach came beaming into
the Shack and announced with radiant modesty that
he had been awarded the recognition.

The chamber of commerce red list is the Phi Beta
Kappa of college journalists. It gives every man on
it definite proof that he has at least one thought for
himself. It is the honor roll of men who have demon
strated that they manage to keep a reasonably open
mind despite the American Legion and the grammar
school civics texts. When a college newspaper man
fails to make the red list, it shows that he is simply
a sounding board for convention, that he is as drably
uninspired as public school architecture.
And so for two years I have tried to make the list.
It has been a long, hard fight, because I was very
impressionable as a child and swallowed unquestion
ingly all the pretty slogans I read in the Hearst papers.
But I started this year with the feeling that I was
about to succeed. I was sure that before June I
could demonstrate at least the minimum of broad
mindedness necessary to annoy the bigots.
# * * *
what distinction is there in a mere red list
when three Stanford professors can make the
minutes of a senatorial investigating committee with
out trying. I feel like a man who angles for an invi
tation to join the Rotary Club, and suddenly discovers
that a neighbor he cut dead has made the social
register.
Personally I think the whole thing is unjust. The
professors don't deserve the honor. Dean Kefauver, for
instance, wears neat double-breasted gray suits and
combs his hair fiat. The man doesn't even look like a
Communist in disguise. Worse than that, he wears
rimless glasses. Any grammar school child knows that
no self-respecting Communist will wear anything but
horn-rimmed glasses. And the committee is obviously
working with a grammar school child's definitions.
* * * IS
The committee doesn't tell us what our professors
did to rate mention. But it couldn't have been any
thing really important. Probably they said that Hearst
papers sometimes deal rather cavalierly with news,
or implied that all the American Legionaires were not
in the front line trenches.
It does no good to say that the witnesses at the
investigation are meddlesome fools and that the com
mittee acts like something out of a Gaieties skit. It is
no help to say that our professors haven't qualified,
that they couldn t poison a mind with cyanide.
The Dies Committee has shattered my dream. A
mere led list depreciates to zero when professors
who mind their own business are read into the minutes
of a Senate committee.
