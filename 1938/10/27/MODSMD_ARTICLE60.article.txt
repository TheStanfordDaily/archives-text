A COUPLE of our boys took a couplc of girls out
for a bit last night, and as a gentle climax to the
evening they took them to the new drive-in stand near
the campus.
"Make it snappy, kid," they told the gal who came
out to get their orders. "We've a grand total of five
minutes."
Four of their five minutes went past. They had
to get their girls home. Without telling the drive-in
people to cancel their orders, they tore home in their
remaining one minute and got their gals in on time.
But they were still hungry, after a fashion. They
picked up another guy and went on back to the drive
in and parked in the same place they had before.
Soon after they got there, the waitress came out,
quite leisurely, with the food they had ordered all
that time ago.
She didn't even seem surprised at the change of sex
or numbers in the car.
You could probably short-change her without even
trying.
Overheard upstairs in the Press building: A gal
was asking a photographer to take some night pictures
for her, some moonlight pictures.
"But I can't wait three whole weeks for a full
moon," she said.

The boys have been heckling my dumbest friend
again. The other night one of ihem asked him, "What
are you going to be when you grow up?"
An aeronautical engineer," he answered very se
riously. His back was to me at the time so I can't be
sure, but I rather imagine he pouted just a little as
he said it.

A FEWqqui c k oncs: A R l, y camo in,( > the football
game last Saturday carrying ihe student body
card of one of the football players. Just as he handed
his ticket to the egg taking tickets, the loud-speaker
blared forth that the player whose ticket he had had
done something or other on the field.
Those were a, bad few seconds for the guy with
the ticket. But he did get in.
One of our dumber frosh was sitting in the stands
that day. Somewhere in the middle of the game she
said to the girl sitting next to her, "I wonder who
U.S.C. is playing this week?"
The guy with the unprintable nick-name is still
being called by it bv his girl.
The fraternity boys who had so much trouble with
the turkey had him for dinner Monday night. He
was the toughest turkey they ever ate. they say.
But they never enjoyed eating a turkey more.
