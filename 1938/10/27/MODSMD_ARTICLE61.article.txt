# Miss Sullavan Scores With Tearjerker
## 
### 
"SHOPWORN ANGEL," star
ring Margaret Sullavan, now at
the Varsity Theater.
Margaret Sullavan again comes
through with an intense dramatic
portrayal in "Shopworn Angel."
After her emotional characteriza
tion as the beautiful tubercular in
"Three Comrades," her studio rec
ognized her appeal in this type of

role, and lost no
time in putting
her into another
such tragic part.
"Shopworn An
gel" is the result,
and, due to Miss
Sullavan, it is a
happy one.
It is a senti
mental tear-jerk
er, with its appeal

built entirely on emotion. An emo
tional theme, well handled, can
produce a dramatic and gripping
story. So it is in "Shopworn An
gel."
SIMPLE STORY
The story is simple enough —an
actress (Margaret Sullavan, who is
her manager's (Walter Pidgeon)
mistress, finds spiritual satisfaction
in the pure love of an idealistic youth
(Jimmie Stewart) from Texas. He
idolizes her because she fulfills a
dream of love that he has always
had. The actress realizes this, and,
unwilling to shatter his idealism,
makes a gesture that enables the
youth to carry his illusion with him
to France and his death.
Miss Sullavan, of course, rises to
such heights that she almost ob
scures the rest of the cast. In the
case of Stewart this is perhaps for
tunate. Walter Pidgeon is excellent
and does well with his role. Hattie
McDaniels, that elephantine, coal
black negress, plays the maid in her
own ample way, which is always
amusing.
PLAY WELL-INTEGRATED
The musical score is appropriate
and skillfully used. The photography
—angle shots and plastic camera, and
the music play a very important
role in setting the mood. The di
rection is excellent, and the gen
eral effect is good.
The picture is billed with "The
Life and Loves of Beethoven," pre
viously reviewed, which makes an
excellent double bill, although per
haps a bit heavy for those who are
accustomed to a diet of 'zaney'
comedies. —Sloane

and does well with his role. Hattie
McDaniels, that elephantine, coal
black negress, plays the maid in her
own ample way, which is always
amusing.
PLAY WELL-INTEGRATED
The musical score is appropriate
and skillfully used. The photography
—angle shots and plastic camera, and
the music play a very important
role in setting the mood. The di
rection is excellent, and the gen
eral effect is good.
The picture is billed with "The
Life and Loves of Beethoven," pre
viously reviewed, which makes an
excellent double bill, although per
haps a bit heavy for those who are
accustomed to a diet of 'zaney'
comedies. —Sloane
