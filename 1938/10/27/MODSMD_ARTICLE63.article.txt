## ANOTHER CYNIC 
### 
To the Bewildered Rooter,
Dear Son:
What's the matta wif the Rally
Committee? It's all wight; who's
all wight—the Wally Committee! We
of the landed gentry who own auto
mobiles like to see where we are
going when we are driving them.
You take the W.S.C. stickers—we'll
take vanilla. It's bad enough to have
a cheer leader at all, but My God,
don't give us a Yell King, and don't
call those hog-callers in red a
"band."
You said, "at half time of the
U.S.C. game that our card stunts
were a disgrace." Listen, son, at the
half time of any game, all card stunts
are a disgrace.
Your spiritual adviser,
Harry Gentry
P.S.: Were you the jockey wearing
his rooter's cap in my 11 o'clock
yesterday?
