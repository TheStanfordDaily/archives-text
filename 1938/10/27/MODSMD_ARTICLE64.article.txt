The Editor, Sir:
As the decision has been reached
to build a new boathouse, Ls there
any reason that the old one should
remain standing.
In view of the fact that the Big
Game bonfire IS to be built in one
day, wouldn't it be a good idea to
use the lumber from the old boat
house to aid in the accumulation of
materials for said bonfire?
This suggestion is made by we
girls of Roble who were used as the
main excuse for building this bon
fire in such a short time.
We think that the old lumber
would be excellent tinder for mak
ing the one-day bonfire a success.
