HANKOW (Thursday), Oct. 27
(UP). â€”Japanese armed forces start
ed a new drive against the remnants
of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's
battered Chinese armies today fol
lowing their bloodless occupation of
this former Chinese provisional
capital.
Hankow was quiet following yes
terday's tense situation when a
clash between Japanese and United
States sailors guarding a Chinese
refugee zone was narrowly averted.
U. S. naval authorities voluntarily
disarmed their patrols and the
American sailors were preserving
order solely with clubs.
