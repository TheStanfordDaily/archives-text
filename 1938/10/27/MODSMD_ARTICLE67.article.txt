# Student Series Lectures Start
## State Labor School Described at Meeting 
### 
Speaking last night at the first
A.S.U. - Y.W.CA. - sponsored "Stu
dent Problems" lecture series, Mary
Beaton, representing the Stanford
students who attended the Worker's
School at Berkeley last summer
said, "The Worker's School created
a situation which would never exist
naturally, but which was very sig
nificant for us."
"The school brought together,"
she continued, "A. F. of L., and
C. I. O. workers, migratory work
ers, persons from all walks of the
labor world: retail clerks, garment
workers, household employees, em
ployees of the Douglass Aircraft fac
tories, the Ford motor company, the
unemployed, waitresses.
WORKERS VIEW LABOR
Miss Beaton stressed the fact that
the situation was not only interest
ing for the college students, but gave
an opportunity for workers them
selves to understand better the
problems of each other and labor
as a whole.
"The eagerness of these people to
learn ,and, along side of this, their
pitilul lack of opportunity except
for the Worker's School," she said,
"was a paradox which remained up
permost in our minds."
SEVERAL SPONSORS
The Worker's School is sponsored
by the California State Department
of Education, the California Asso
ciation for Adult Education, The
California State Federation of La
bor, and the Extension Division of
the University of California.
Although Stanford does not spon
sor the school as such, the financial
support which is given by the stu
dent groups: Lagunita, Roble, the
Union, Women's Conference, Pan-
Hellenic, along with Dean Mary
Yost is very helpful in solving the
financial problem.
