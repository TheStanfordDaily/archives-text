# First Wage-Hour Strike Hits East
## 
### 
CHICAGO. Oct, 2G (UP). â€” The
first strike directly due to the new
wage-hour law was called today in
Indianapolis and Kansas City units
of the Commercial Telegraphers Un
ion, A.F.L. affiliate, against Postal
Telegraph Company, according to
announcement here by Frank J.
Powers, the union's president.
The strike, Powers said, resulted
from a dispute with the company
over putting the wage-hour law into
effect. The union head accused the
company of failure to "abide by the
law providing 48 hours pay for 44
hours work."
