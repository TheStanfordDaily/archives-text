# British Cut Jew Holy Land Quota
## 
### 
JERUSALEM, Oct. 26 (UP). —
Great Britain tonight announced
Jewish immigration to Palestine
during the next six months would
be limited to 4,800 persons, a figure
which Jewish leaders described as
an "obvious surrender" to Arab ter
rorism. •
Announcement of the new Jewish
quota for the six months period
ending March 31, 1939, as published
in the official gazette, coincided with
reports from London that a new
British policy for dealing with the
Holy Land issue contemplates re
duced Jewish immigration "for a
period of years."
According to estimates, each per
son in the United States eats an
average of 58 oranges, five grape
fruit, and 16 lemons annually.
