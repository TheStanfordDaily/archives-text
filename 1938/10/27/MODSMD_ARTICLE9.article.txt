"My God, am I a cluinip," gasp
ed Boh Brooke at 10:58 J ,•» last
night as he staggered up the Phi
Psi steps.
On a $6.25 bet, he had just fin
ished a 10-hour foot-trip to San
Jose and hack. And he trotted in
to break the tape after his 36-mile
hoof with exactly one and one
half minutes to go. Stopping only
once to tape bis feet. Brooke lived
on cokes and cigarettes through
out his trek.
Reveling in reflected glory, his
Phi Psi brothel's boasted. "Dr.
Wilbur can't say WE have auto
mobile legs."
