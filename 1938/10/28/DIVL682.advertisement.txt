If you want to see the INDIANS battle those dan
gerous Bruins in Los Angeles, here's your chance to
go . . . and on an exceedingly low roundtrip fare spe

your car. And you can dance and sleep en route.

compartments and drawing rooms. Additional cost for
roundtrip accommodations: lower berth, $6.30; upper
$4.80; compartment, $17.90; drawing room, $23.10.
Two persons may occupy a berth at no additional cost, as
many as four may occupy a compartment and five a
drawing room.
This special fare is for students only and will be sold
at Associated Students Office upon presentation of your
student body card. Take your student body card and
check book immediately to the A.S.S.U. Office and
make your reservations.
