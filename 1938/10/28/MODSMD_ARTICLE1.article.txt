# Indians Plan 'Rain Dance' Tomorrow
## 'Pennies from Heaven' Will Aid Boathouse Building Project 
### 
Like the Indians in the Great
Southwest, Stanford's Indians are)
going to hold a rain dance tomorrow i
night- a rain dance for pennies from 1
heaven to help build a new boat
house.
Starting at !) o'clock in the Worn- \
en's Gym, they will whoop it up for
three hours to the music of Ozzie j
Secrest and his orchestra.
Unlike those history-book Indians,
the Farm Indians will bring their
own pennies — 100 of them per
couple. They will bring them Sat- |
urday night or they will buy tickets 1
with them today at the A.S.S.U. of- i
fices.
Planned by Cardinals, sub-chiefs j
Woodie Miller, Mary Kay Horton, ;
and Dick Frank have been detailed j
to handle the semi-sacred cere- .
mony.
Coming on the Farm's only free'
week-end, the prayer-dance has
been sent to Stanford directly from |
the Great Spirit. It will help the
boathouse — but more important to
festivity-seeking Indians, it will fill
the hole left by the football team's
going Bear hunting olf the reserva
tion.
Deftly moving their feet to smooth '
rhythms, smart Indians will be
sending up side prayers to the Great!
Spirit for making it possible for j
them to get by with spending one 1
dollar on their squaws on the Farm |
instead of five dollars in the white i
man's City.
And maybe they will be celebrat- I
ing a Bruin meat feast.
