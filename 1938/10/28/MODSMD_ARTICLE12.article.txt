# Frenzied Card Rooters Cheer L.A.-Bound Train
## 
### 
Fired into an enthusiastic frenzy by yells and songs, the Stanford
varsity and coaches left last night at !):40 o'clock on the Oakland Lark
following a rousing send-off rally at the Palo Alto station.
Led by the Stanford band, Farm students paraded down the Row from
the Fiji house to the station. Torches lit the way for the students as they
proceeded down the

Road.
When the rooters reached the sta
tion, Lomax Turner started off the
rally by leading yells and songs,
accompanied by the band.
The class of '42 added to the con
fusion by tossing waterbags into the
crowd.
When the frosh were quieted, Tur
ner introduced several members of
the team. Since Coach Tiny Thorn
hill could not be coaxed onto the
platform, Assistant Coach Ben Win
kleman said a few words.
Just before the train pulled out,
Turner led enthusiastic students in
the "Axe Yell." As the train moved
out of the station, the excitement
was climaxed by the singing of
"Come Join the Band."
