# Hitler To Meet British on Peace
## 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 27 (UP). — The
British cabinet was reported tonight
to have approved proposals for a
new "face-to-facc" meeting between
Prime Minister Neville Chamber
lain and German Chancellor Adolf
Hitler to discuss a sweeping pro
gram of European appeasement.
The meeting of Chamberlain and
Hitler — their fourth — probably
would occur shortly after formal
enforcement of the Italian pact of
friendship initialed in Rome last
April 16 but delayed because of the
continued presence of Italian troops
in Spain.
The cabinet agreed to Nov. 17 as
the provisional date for putting the
treaty into effect, now that Premier
Benito Mussolini has made a "ges
ture" by recalling 10.000 of his Black
shirts from Spain.
