SYDNEY, N.S.W., Oct. 27 (UP).—
Skeletons of eight men, believed to
be the bones of members of the
Leichardt expedition which left
Moreton Bay, Queensland, 90 years
ago to cross Australia from east to
west, have been found in the Simp
son desert, the "dead heart" of Aus
tralia, by Edwin Lowe and his son,
of Dalhousie Springs and Mount
Dare cattle stations.
Seven of the skeletons found by
the Lowes were grouped in a circle.
II appeared as though the men had
been around a camp fire and had
been speared by aborigines. Two
miles away they found another
skeleton—that of a man who had
probably been wounded and tried to
escape.
