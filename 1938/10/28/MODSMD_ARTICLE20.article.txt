# Big Red Machine Invades Bruin Lair Tomorrow
## Standlee, Ledeboer Hold Offensive Key to Stanford's Ground Attack 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Stanford s Wonder 'IVam—.'{ft strong—is now somewhere in the en
virons of Los Angeles with the avowed intention of winning a football
game from U.C.L.A. tomorrow afternoon in the Coliseum.
Before the season hegan .we wondered how they could possibly be
beaten. After the Santa Clara game, we wondered how they could win.

♦Then the Machine rolled against
Washington State and Oregon, and
we wondered what they would do
next. They lost to Southern Cali
fornia without making a first down

at left half. Ledeboer was good
enough against S.C., but couldn't
carry the load on the ground alone.
Standlee is a fair kicker and pass
er, as are Hugh Gallarneau, Cookie
South, Glenn Hamilton, and Thor
Peterson. Stanford's attack last
week was built entirely around
Ledeboer, but there weren't enough
versatile backs in action to build up
a single bit of deception.
BRENNER THREAT
However, the team will greatly
miss Paulman's sure-fire kicking,
passing, and blocking just as they
did against Troy. Little Jack Bren
ner has shown himself to be just as
good a threat as Fay, but he lacks
Pete's experience and finesse.
Thornhill will open with the same
