# Big Red Machine Invades Bruin Lair Tomorrow
## Standlee, Ledeboer Hold Offensive Key to Stanford's Ground Attack 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Stanford s Wonder 'IVam—.'{ft strong—is now somewhere in the en
virons of Los Angeles with the avowed intention of winning a football
game from U.C.L.A. tomorrow afternoon in the Coliseum.
Before the season hegan .we wondered how they could possibly be
beaten. After the Santa Clara game, we wondered how they could win.

♦Then the Machine rolled against
Washington State and Oregon, and
we wondered what they would do
next. They lost to Southern Cali
fornia without making a first down
from scrimmage.
So the Wonder Team goes again
tomorrow and they finished their
last home practice in as fine a spirit
as they have shown all fall.
No one has mentioned U.S.C. all
week. You wouldn't even know that
Bill Paulman and Pete Fay, the

The B.A.C. late last night re
ported that there was a short
waiting list for U.C.L.A. game
rooter's tickets. Anyone holding
a ticket who is not going to the
game is urged to turn it in for re
fund in order that these requests
may he filled. A total of 17!i2
rooter's tickets have been sold.

squad's greatest backs, are both out
of the Bruin tilt. So if it's determi
nation and the old college try that
will spell victory tomorrow, the In
dians will win without a doubt.
Big Norm Standlee will open for
Thornhill at fullback. Most of the
Card running attack will rely upon
the curly headed sophomore and
Fi-ed Ledeboer, running this week
at left half. Ledeboer was good
enough against S.C., but couldn't
carry the load on the ground alone.
Standlee is a fair kicker and pass
er, as are Hugh Gallarneau, Cookie
South, Glenn Hamilton, and Thor
Peterson. Stanford's attack last
week was built entirely around
Ledeboer, but there weren't enough
versatile backs in action to build up
a single bit of deception.
BRENNER THREAT
However, the team will greatly
miss Paulman's sure-fire kicking,
passing, and blocking just as they
did against Troy. Little Jack Bren
ner has shown himself to be just as
good a threat as Fay, but he lacks
Pete's experience and finesse.
Thornhill will open with the same
team he started a week ago. Bill
Willard and Andy Stojkovich at end,
Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen at
tackle, Hamp Pool and Corky Dona
hue at guard, and Tony Calvclli at
center will give him a strong, expe
rienced line.
But his backfield isn't the same
dream aggregation that opened
against Santa Clara. Gene Coldiron
starts at quarter, Standlee at full,
Ledeboer at» left half, and Hugh
Gallarneau at right half.
Of the quartet only Ledeboer will
approach top shape. Coldiron hits
been taking it easy with a head full
of loose teeth. Standlee's ankle needs
more conditioning, and Gallarneau
has a trick knee.
BRUIN ACES
The Bruin midnight express, Ken
ny Washington, is being counted up
on for great things, as are Hal Hir
shon and Woodrow Wilson Strode, a
countryman of Washington's. John
ny Ryland at center is the southern
er experts' idea of a line backer do
luxe.
However, the Bruin attack lacks
finish despite their lop-sided win
*>ver Idaho. Stanford can win with
what they have left if they don't
lose Calvelli or Standlee too early
in the struggle. The Indians are the
underdogs again, and that's always
- good sign.

But his backfield isn't the same
dream aggregation that opened
against Santa Clara. Gene Coldiron
starts at quarter, Standlee at full,
Ledeboer at» left half, and Hugh
Gallarneau at right half.
Of the quartet only Ledeboer will
approach top shape. Coldiron hits

more conditioning, and Gallarneau
has a trick knee.
BRUIN ACES
The Bruin midnight express, Ken

on for great things, as are Hal Hir

countryman of Washington's. John

luxe.
However, the Bruin attack lacks
finish despite their lop-sided win

what they have left if they don't
lose Calvelli or Standlee too early
in the struggle. The Indians are the
underdogs again, and that's always

Stanford s Wonder 'IVam—.'{ft strong—is now somewhere in the en

Washington State and Oregon, and
we wondered what they would do

So the Wonder Team goes again
tomorrow and they finished their

as they have shown all fall.

of the Bruin tilt. So if it's determi
nation and the old college try that
will spell victory tomorrow, the In
dians will win without a doubt.
Big Norm Standlee will open for
Thornhill at fullback. Most of the
Card running attack will rely upon
the curly headed sophomore and
Fi-ed Ledeboer, running this week
at left half. Ledeboer was good
enough against S.C., but couldn't
carry the load on the ground alone.
Standlee is a fair kicker and pass
er, as are Hugh Gallarneau, Cookie
South, Glenn Hamilton, and Thor
Peterson. Stanford's attack last
week was built entirely around
Ledeboer, but there weren't enough
versatile backs in action to build up
a single bit of deception.
BRENNER THREAT
However, the team will greatly
miss Paulman's sure-fire kicking,
passing, and blocking just as they
did against Troy. Little Jack Bren

good a threat as Fay, but he lacks

Thornhill will open with the same
team he started a week ago. Bill
Willard and Andy Stojkovich at end,
Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen at
