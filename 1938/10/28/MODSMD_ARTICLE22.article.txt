### JACK BURTT 
In answer to anti-vivisectionist claims that laboratories have been
guilty of needless cruelty to animals in experiments, I>r. C. 11. Danforth.
professor of anatomy, recently called attention to Stanford rules regarding
care of animals in all laboratories here.
Pointing out the similarity between these rules and those at other col- i
leges and universities, and at commercial laboratories. Dr. Danforth em-

phasized in his statement the fact<
that "results of experiments depend I
upon ideal conditions of care, and j
the treatment accorded experimen
tal animals convalescing from opera- I
lions is equal to that given human!
bi ings in the same condition."
Dr. Danforth's statement was made
in his capacity as chairman of the
campus committee which is fighting
the State Humane Pound Act. Pas
sage of this act, it is asserted by uni
versity professors and research
workers, would result in an effec
live choking of medical research in
every university in the state.
The rules for the care of labora
tory animals, which have been in
effect for many years, are designed
to set a standard for experimental
work, according to Dr. Danforth. A j
few of the rules are as follows: â€¢
"No animal is to be used without 1
Ihe express permission of a member
of the staff, who assumes responsi
bility for any procedures used."
"When the survival of an animal
i? deemed necessary (that is, when
results can be learned only from a
living animal), operative procedures
must be carried out asceptically and
Ihe convalescent animal must re
ceive special attention until it has
finally recovered."
"Deep anesthesia must invariably
bo used, except with special permis
sion and in procedures which in
volve less discomfort than anesthesia
i I self."
"All animals must be killed pain
lessly by the use of gas, or instan
laneously by other means."
Strict adherence to these, and
other rules, is required in every de
partment of the University,
