## 
### 
PRAGUE, Oct. 27 (UP). —The government tonight arrested Dr. Andrej
; Brody, who resigned yesterday as premier of autonomous Ruthenia prov
; ince, on charges of high treason as the Czech-Hungarian territorial dispute
j approached a new deadlock.
Brody, who has been particularly friendly to Hungary, was charged
! with carrvinsr on treasonable "relations with a foreign power."

Announcement of his arrest came
immediately after Hungary, in a
' note delivered to Foreign Minister
j Frantisek Chvalkovsky, rejected in
| part Czechoslovakia's new terms for
j a territorial settlement.
Brody, who quit his cabinet post
i after vainly seeking a compromise
with Hungary, was replaced by Mon
signor Augustin Volosin. former un
der-secretary in the Ruthenian gov
j ernment, who will conduct any fu
! ture negotiations with Hungary af
! fecting the status of Ruthenia.
Hungary's new note complained
that Czechoslovakia had failed to
give any sort of satisfaction to Hun
[ garian demands for plebiscites in
' Slovakia and Ruthenia.
"The Hungarian reply," it was
announced here, "protested that the
Czechoslovak government had not
■ made any direct answer to the ques
i tion of plebiscites for the (Magyar)

minorities in Slovakia and Ruthenia
and also demanded that the terri
tory in which there is a Magyar ma
jority be removed from arbitration.
"On the other hand, the Hungarian
government expressed satisfaction
that the Czech government, like the
Hungarian government, is inspired
by a wish to reach a sincere, rapid
and complete agreement.
"The Hungarian note contains sev
eral proposals regarding arbitration.
Before the Czech government can
formulate a reply it is necessary to
convene another plenary meeting."
The reference to a meeting was
taken to mean a joint session of the
Prague, Slovak and Ruthenian cabi
nets.
