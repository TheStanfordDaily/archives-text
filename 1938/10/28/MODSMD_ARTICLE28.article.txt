# Dies Committee Rejects Inquiry Postponement
## White House Defied In Renewed Probe Of Murphy's Action 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 27 (UP). â€”
The Dies Committee today flatly re
jected demands from two New Deal
members that it postpone further in
quiry into un-American activities
until after the November 8 election
and hurled new defiance at the White
House by renewing its investigation
of the activities of Governor Frank
Murphy during the 1937 automobile
strikes in Michigan.
It was testimony before the group
that Murphy was guilty of "trea
sonable" conduct during the labor
clashes which brought charges from
President Roosevelt that the commit
tee had allowed itself to be used by
disgruntled Republicans to influence
the Michigan gubernatorial contest.
Chairman Martin Dies, D., Tex.,
retorted yesterday that in rushing to
the defense of Murphy Mr. Roose
velt left himself open to the charge
that he was trying to influence the
race. Today, Dies led three other
members of his committee in riding
roughshod over the proposal of
Reps. Arthur D. Healey, D., Mass.,
and John J. Dempsey, D., N.M., that
the inquiry be recessed until after
the November elections. Voting with
Dies were Reps. Harold G. Mosier,
D., 0., who was defeated for renom
ination; Parnell Thomas, R., N.J.
and Noah M. Mason, R., 111.
Dies formally notified Dempsey
and Healey of the committee's action
jin identical messages, which saic
j that it would be "cowardly" to sus
i pend the hearings because it "woulc
imply that the Democratic Party is
unwilling for the people to have the
facts when they go to the polls."
"But even from a party standpoint
|I am convinced that it is better foi
! Democrats to take the initiative ant
fearlessly expose subversive activi
ties that threaten the very existenc<
of the republic, even if in doing s(
a few candidates for office on tht
Democratic ticket are involved.'
j Dies said.
