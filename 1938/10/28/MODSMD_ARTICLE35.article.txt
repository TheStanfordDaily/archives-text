### 
MARSEILLES, France, Oct. 27 (UP). —Premier Eduard Daladier, ad
dressing the annual congress of his Radical-Socialist party, today outlawed
the Communists from the government majority and moved closer to friend
ship with the dictators.
Daladier, sounding the death knell of the Leftist Popular Front coali
tion that has governed France for more than three years, accused the

Communists of sabotaging his
to strengthen France.
The Premier's repudiation of the
Communists, who hold 76 seats in
Parliament, increased speculation
that the government's shift toward a
settlement with the totalitarian
powers might result in collapse of
the Franco-Soviet military alliance.
LEANS TOWARD GERMANY
Daladier, at the same time, held
out a friendly hand to Germany in
a statement which many of his list
eners interpreted as support for a
four - power plan of appeasement
built on the foundations of the Mu
nich accord which, he said, was "an
act of reason."
French policy, he said, is based on
collaboration with Great Britain
but there are no restrictions—either
moral or political—against its ex
tension to "loyal collaboration" with
other nations.
France, he added, is "open to all
possible understanding with Ger
many'' and "all problems can be
settled by honest understanding."
REJECTS DISMEMBERMENT
Daladier added, however, that
France rejects any dismemberment
of the French post-war overseas em
pire as the price for satisfaction of
Chancellor Adolf Hitler's colonial
demands.
"We consider the French Empire
inviolate," he said.
The Radical-Socialist delegates ap
proved the renunciation of the Com
munists.
"The party's violence and intransi
geance has paralyzed my action," he
said. "The attitude of the Commu
nist party leaders is aimed at sabo
tage of government solidarity."
NEGOTIATIONS START
The Italo - German negotiations
started in Rome with the arrival of
German Foreign Minister Joachim
von Ribbentrop and it was reported
that Italy and Germany, as one of
their basic considerations for a new
friendship witn France, would de
manfl that the Communists be
ejected from the majority upon
which Daladier's government is de
pendent for support.
Shortly after Daladier's speech a
statement was issued in Berlin say
ing that ' Daladier's statements at
Marseilles were favorably received
in Berlin political quarters, particu
larly his desire for an understanding
as leflected in his comments about
Germany."
Former Premier Leon Blum, So
cialist leader, indicated he would
attempt to salvage as much as pos
sible of the Popular Front strength
as a result of Daladier's "outlawing"
of the Comunists.
