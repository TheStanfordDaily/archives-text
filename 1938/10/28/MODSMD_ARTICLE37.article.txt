# Lightweight Grid Squads Recommended

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27 (UP).—
Edward Atherton, former Depart
ment of Justice agent employed by
the Pacific Coast Conference to ex
amine its athletic and athletic schol
arship structure, recommended to
night that the colleges do some
thing for the college students who
weigh 150 pounds or less by estab
lishing lightweight football teams.
It was the first recommendation
of the survey that started a year
ago.
GAMES FOR "LITTLE FELLOW"
Atherton thinks such teams would
extend the game to the little fellow
who is more or less frozen out in
the constant chase after big boys
who help pay off the nation's sta
diums.
"The result is that they don't play
football, no matter how they love
the game. There are exceptions, of
course. Cotton Warburton, the
U.S.C. quarterback a few years ago,
was one. Dave Queen, the Califor
nia center, is another. But there are
only enough exceptions to prove
the rule.
"High schools have 'B,' 'C,' and
even 'D' teams for small boys. Let
the colleges organize lightweight
squads and form a special schedule
so that these teams play in a con
ference of their own. In that way
more boys can play football and
the varsity coaches may discover
many another Warburton or Queen.
NO CHANCE FOR "SMALL GUY"
"Despite my profession I am not
at heart a pessimist," the long-time
sleuth explained. "But it is true
(hat something is missing in the col
leges and in their football programs
when smaller students have no
chance to participate in the game.
And they have no chance.
"Any boy who was not a high
school star receives little encour
agement to play in college, and small
students receive even less. They
either figure the coach will stand
them up for the varsity to knock
down all afternoon or they realize
from the outset they are too light to
stand a show with the bruisers.
