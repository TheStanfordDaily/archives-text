# French Priest To Talk Here Next Tuesday
## Abbe Ernest Dimnet To Speak on French, English Literature 
### 
"Literature and Education in
France and America" will be dis
cussed by Abbe Ernest Dimnet,
noted French priest, author, and phi
losopher, next Tuesday night when
he speaks at the fourth lecture of
the current Tuesday Evening Series
in Memorial Hall auditoi'ium, ac
cording to the Committee on Public
Exercises, in charge of the series.
"The vital, untrammeled educa
tion of Americans puts no obstacles
between culture and creativeness,"
asserts Abbe Dimnet, who explains
that, contrary to that of the United
States, "the educational system of
France is based mostly on literary
criticism, and does not favor crea
tion."
Leaving his country home near
the Belgian border less than two
weeks ago, the Jesuit priest was able
to witness at first hand the recent
spectacle of the French people fight
ing their own frenzied panic as the
shadow of war, occasioned by Adolf
Hitler's militaristic ambitions in cen
tral Europe, swept over them.
That Europe's fear of "Hitlerism"
is greater than its fear of Commu
nism is the opinion of the Abbe, who
1 explains that in his travels on the
Continent he has found that the re
j action of America as a whole to the
| actions of the Nazi dictator is both
"strong and definite."
I "This is a hopeful sign," the French
! priest believes, asserting that another
is "the definite antipathy of the
people of Italy to the recent Rome-
Berlin axis."
! Abbe Dimnet has made two pre
j vious visits to the campus, once in
1927 when he gave a lecture and
I again two years later when he pre
sented a series of three. The Abbe
has served as Lowell lecturer at Har
vard University and was a French
spokesman at the Institute of Poli
tics at Williamstown in 1923.
