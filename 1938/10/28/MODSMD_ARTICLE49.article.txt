# U.C.L.A. Game Toss-up, Says Bruin Writer
## 'In-and-out' Bruins May Be 'Out'; Seem Ready to Win 
### JOHN ROTHWELL 
Sports Editor, California Daily Bruin
When your little Red Kiddy-car
rolls into the Coliseum tomorrow,
it's heading for an afternoon of as
screwy and unpredictable football
as it will run up against all season.
For, when U.C.L.A.'s Bruins take
to the greensward, anything might
happen. They might play like cham
pions or dubs, they might play con
servative football or one of ths
craziest games you've ever seen.
That's the one thing about this
Bruin team. It might not be headed
lor the Rose Bowl, but it generally
will give fans, and opposing grid
ders, a run for their money.
IN AND OUT
Right now it has been tabbed as
an "in-and-out" team, hot one week
and cold the next. Against lowa in
its season opener, the Westwood
eleven looked like the proverbial
million in coasting to an easy 27-3
win. The next week was the "out"
week, bringing a 14-12 loss at tha
hands of Oregon, the same team that
your Indians plastered two weeks
ago.
Washington, the same outfit that
California was lucky to beat last
week, had the misfortune of hitting
the Bruins next, and was white
washed 13-0. You can guess the
result seven days later when the
Bruins met Brother Bear, hardly
offering a fight after the first few
plays and losing 20-7.
What makes Stanford's case look
good is the Bruin score of last week,
it 33-0 walloping of previously un
defeated Idaho. That should mean
that the Bruins are headed for an
other of their regular dreary after
noons.
"GOOFY STUFF"
But this Westwood team has pulled
so much goofy stuff already that it
may even break its custom, and its
long-lasting Homecoming Day jinx,
and knock your Indians right off the
kiddy-car.
Bill Spaulding, tutoring his final
U.C.L.A. eleven, has a lad in Kenny i
Washington who we are all agreed i
i.s twice as good as Berkeley's Vic
Bottari. When he gets past the line
of scrimmage or cocks his deadly
right arm, he's liable to forget that
it's the Bruins' week to lose.
And in the center of the line is a
Blue and Gold warrior who always
turns in a remarkable game, whether
his team is giving its sourest exhi
bition or its best. Johnny Ryland is
southern California's nomination for
All-American center, and his duel
with your Tony Calvelli to prove
this honor should be a highlight of
the day.
RYLAND OUTSTANDING
Ryland has been the outstanding
linesman in every Bruin game to
date, and if he can x-epeat against
Calvelli and Stanford, there is noth
ing to bar his way to all-star selec
tion.
Frankly, we think we're going to
win. But knowing our team's record
for inconsistency, we wouldn't put
a plugged nickel on it.
The only thing that we would be
willing to wager a slight sum on is
that plenty of fur will be flying in
the Coliseum. The Bruin will be I
shooting the works to keep it from j
being part of his pelt. And we un- j
rierstand that your Indians feel the |
same way about their scalps.

In Australia a vote must be tak
en every eight years on a proposal
to abolish liquor licenses. If 60 per
cent favor it, all licenses except
those of breweries must be cancelled.
This makes liquor sales illegal.
