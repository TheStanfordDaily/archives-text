# Ucla Confident Despite Absence of Spaulding

Managing Editor

WESTWOOD. Oct. 27 (Special to The Daily).—The U.C.L.A. football
team was almost caught in the whirlpool of a major revolt yesterday. It
happened this way:
For the first time since 1925, Head Coach Bill Spaulding will not be
on the Bruin bench Saturday. Spaulding left Los Angeles Wednesday night

to attend the funeral of his
who passed away Tuesday.
Spaulding named his four as
sistants — Babe Horrell, Ray Rich
ards, A. J. Sturzenegger, and Cliff
Simpson—as coaches for the game.
Yesterday ,the players took mat
ters in their own hands, deciding
that four voices were too many. They
voted Horrell to the head coaching
spot, the other three to assistant
coach positions. All four coaches ac
cepted the terms, thus peacefully
ending what might have been more
than a mere disagreement.
This coaching staff seems to be |
very confident, so confident, in fact.;
that the masterminds are starting !
what amounts to a second-string,
backfield — Montgomery at quarter, j
Overlin at full, and Fennenbock and '
Harris at the half-back spots.
Using the same strategy so sue- j
cessfully employed in last week's
tilt with Idaho, Horrell is holding
Kenny Washington in reserve, wait
ing to explode him at. the start of
the second quarter.
The man-in-the-street's opinion j
isn t so definite, however. For in- '
stance, one guy who should be bub- j
bling over with the familiar "We've ]
a cinch line, Sports Editor Johnny
Rothwell of the U.C.L.A. Daily
Bruin, has a very sad look on a j
usually happy mug.
"What chance do the Bruins have i
Saturday," I asked.
"How do I know," he moaned. "I '
am not in the prediction business in !
regard to our team these days.
"We're not even slipping lead
nickels on the line in the form of a
small wager."
So maybe Tiny's gang has a faint 1
chance Saturday.
