# Soccermen Set For San Jose
## Cards Tackle Strong Spartans Tomorrow 
### 
Ready for their first off-campus 1
appearance of the season, the Cardi- j
nal soccer team "travels tomorrow j
morning for their tilt with the hardy |
San Jose State eleven, scheduled for !
9:30 o'clock on the S.J.S. field.
The Spartans, who have been i
cleaving a victorious path thus far
this season, are expected to furnish !
the Indians with the severest com- j
petition since the Cards' first game
with S.F.J.C. which ended in a 1 to 1
tie.
Grooming his charges on offensive
plays and shots, Coach Harry Main- |
ney has been working the squad '
heavily since last Saturday's game.!
In that conflict, against S.F.U., the j
Stanford lineup showed great play I
on defense, fizzled several offensive j
chances due to poor kicks.
Tomorow's starting lineup will I
probably include the same team that
opened the game last Saturday.
