# Waterdogs To Battle U.S.C. Tomorrow
## Varsity Men Measure Tank For Trojans Frosh vs. Paly High; Exhibition Dives To Mark Local Bill 
### 
In top form after a week of in
tensive drill, Stanford's varsity ,
i
water polo team will take on the i
Trojans of the University of South-
I
ern California in the main attrac- I
tion of tomorrow's aquatic display
in the Encina pool.
Admission will be 25 cents, with a
student body card. The varsity
clash will get under way at 2:30
o'clock, with the frosh - Paly High
game at »1:30 o'clock and some new
exhibition dives by Pacific Coast
Diving Champion Roy Winkelmann
following the yearling battle.
FARM SQUAD AT PEAK
Coach Nort Tltornton will have the ,
strongest squad of the year at his
disposal tomorrow with his entire
first-string line-up on hand in su
perb physical shape.
Captain Johnny Lamb, all-confer
ence forward for the past two sea
sons, has found his shooting eye
during the last week and he should j
be a tough customer for the Trojan
defense. Jack Loupe, who has
scored most of the Indians' points to
date, will get the call at left forward
with Lamb at light forward.
Bob Plate, Harvey Rothschild, Ted
Moreno, Dick Hoover, and Roy
Vitousek complete the line-up. The
only men who didn't see varsity ac
tion last year are Moreno and
Vitousek.
NEWSMEN PRAISE TROY
Los Angeles observers claim that
this year's Trojan outfit is the best j
team ever to represent the school,
and one Los Angeles sports writer
called it "one of the greatest teams I
have ever seen."
Paul Wolf, Olympic Games swim
ming star, appears in the Trojan
line-up and he is a threat to any
team; but wtih S.C. untested as yet j
in conference play, the Indians won't
go into the clash as underdogs.
The Indians displayed plenty of
power in the first half of last week's
5-1 rout of the Bruins, and the sup- I
posedly strong Cal bunch had to go j
into an overtime to eke out a 1-0
win over the same Bruins.
FROSII UNBEATEN
Stanford's undefeated frosh should ;
have an easy time whipping the lo- !
calitics; in fact, the frosh already!
have a 7-1 win over Paly to their |
credit. Fred 'Manwaring looks like i
the Papoose's big scoring punch. In |
addition to Manwaring, Thornton!
expects to start Had Bacon, Scott 1
Dudley, Duncan Patty, Jim Abra- i
hamson, John Polloch, and John i
Holtom, with either Bill Ernst or Ed 1
Smith in the goal.

The Indians displayed plenty of
power in the first half of last week's
5-1 rout of the Bruins, and the sup- I
posedly strong Cal bunch had to go j
into an overtime to eke out a 1-0
win over the same Bruins.
FROSII UNBEATEN
Stanford's undefeated frosh should ;
have an easy time whipping the lo- !
calitics; in fact, the frosh already!
have a 7-1 win over Paly to their |
credit. Fred 'Manwaring looks like i
the Papoose's big scoring punch. In |
addition to Manwaring, Thornton!
expects to start Had Bacon, Scott 1
Dudley, Duncan Patty, Jim Abra- i
hamson, John Polloch, and John i
Holtom, with either Bill Ernst or Ed 1
Smith in the goal.
In top form after a week of in
tensive drill, Stanford's varsity ,
i
water polo team will take on the i
Trojans of the University of South-
I
ern California in the main attrac- I
tion of tomorrow's aquatic display
in the Encina pool.
Admission will be 25 cents, with a
student body card. The varsity
clash will get under way at 2:30
o'clock, with the frosh - Paly High
game at »1:30 o'clock and some new
exhibition dives by Pacific Coast
Diving Champion Roy Winkelmann
following the yearling battle.
FARM SQUAD AT PEAK
Coach Nort Tltornton will have the ,
strongest squad of the year at his
disposal tomorrow with his entire
first-string line-up on hand in su
perb physical shape.
Captain Johnny Lamb, all-confer
ence forward for the past two sea
sons, has found his shooting eye
during the last week and he should j
be a tough customer for the Trojan
defense. Jack Loupe, who has
scored most of the Indians' points to
date, will get the call at left forward
with Lamb at light forward.
Bob Plate, Harvey Rothschild, Ted
Moreno, Dick Hoover, and Roy
Vitousek complete the line-up. The
only men who didn't see varsity ac
tion last year are Moreno and
Vitousek.
NEWSMEN PRAISE TROY
Los Angeles observers claim that
this year's Trojan outfit is the best j
team ever to represent the school,
and one Los Angeles sports writer
called it "one of the greatest teams I
have ever seen."
Paul Wolf, Olympic Games swim
ming star, appears in the Trojan
line-up and he is a threat to any
team; but wtih S.C. untested as yet j
in conference play, the Indians won't
go into the clash as underdogs.
