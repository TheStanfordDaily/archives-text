r pHIRTY-FIVE Stanford Indians,
away from home lor the first
time, arrived in hostile territory this
; morning to get the Big Red Machine
ready to drive tomorrow afternoon
against 11 versatile U.C.L.A. Bruins.
I A caravan of automobiles, several
! motorcycles, a few hitch-hikers,
itwo flyers, and twenty Pullman cars
I full of rooters and Ed York's Rag
' time band will be on hand to give
j the old steamroller, still crippled by
j the loss of Paulman and Fay, a push
| down the Coliseum turf.
| Norm Standlee, only surviving
I member of Tiny Thornhill's original
I first-string backfield for 1938, will

be ready to go at
top speed, but his
three weeks on
crutches will de
mand numerous
rest spells. When
the big fast full
back is in the
game, the Cards
will have little
trouble breaking

through the Brum line, and the
Bruins will not be able to gain much
ground yardage through the Indians.
But when Standlee is taking his
breathers on the bench, Fred Lede
boer and Glenn Hamilton will be de
pended on to take the game into the
air with long tosses into Bruin ter
ritory.
Jack Clark will be ready to run
out for them again for the first time
since the Santa Clara game, but only
as long as his wind holds out.
The Cards are definitely crippled,
and the reserve situation will be
about the same as it was against the
Trojans. Tiny didn't have enough
uninjured veterans to go around, and
you cannot expect too much of the
finest ball player if he hasn't had
varsity experience, especially when
the 11 men on the other side have
been playing together constantly.
It looks as though tomorrow's
contest will feature more passes than
anything else, particularly on the
part of the Bruins. And this situa
tion will be in Stanford's favor.
Kenny Washington can be the best
passer in the world, but good pass
defense—and the Cards have about
the best on the Coast right now—
will keep his tosses from reaching
their mark.
And speaking of pass defense,
U.C.L.A. has been wide open against
tosses of such teams as California
and Oregon. So if ours are well
aimed, they should hit their mark.
But you just can't tell about

I Stanford-U.C.L.A. games. They ;
j never turn out as expected. Ac- 1
cording to the odds that have been !
laid down on that game ever since j
the last year of (he Vowing Sophs, j
the Card-Bruin lilt is consistently I
an upset.
The odds pick the Bruins this i
year. But Stanford, in the wishful- j
thinking mind of a reputedly op- |
timistic sports editor, is the logical ]
choice for tomorrow.

F YOU can't make it to Los An
geles this week-end, you can sit
back and enjoy some fine athletic
entertainment right here on the
i campus.
An afternoon of thrills is in store
for those who attend the Stanford-

Southern-Calilor
nia water polo
ga m e tomorrow j
afternoon. The!
Trojan varsity is
said to be the fin- j
est group of swim- I
me rs on the
Coast, and the
Cards have a new

offense that is hard to beat.
It will be a close game and the
Indians' hardest. Coach Nort Thorn
ton's Hungarian system will be put
to its toughest test, and it has pos
sibilities of giving the Cards a win
over every conference opponent,
Trojans included.
Spectators will be able to keep
tab on the football game in the
South by a radio rigged up at the
Encina Pools.

JTARRY MALONEY'S fast-im
proving soccer combination will
go to t San Jose tomorrow morning
to meet the best team San Jose State

has produced in
many years.
The Spartan
booters, playing
their second sea
son under the
tutelage of a
new coach, have
been undefeated
so far this year,
and reports indi
cate that they
will give the
Cards, whose
only black mark

is one tie, a hard game.
Stanford kickers have a new in
centive in the promise of gold soc
; cer balls to be presented them if
j they win the conference title. A
•small group of Stanford boosters

'headed by Jim Howell ,Tiny-Buck-
I of-the-Month Club h,ead, made the
I offer Tuesday night at a meeting of
'the Circle S Society.
