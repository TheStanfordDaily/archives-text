# 8:00 and All's Well
## 
### 
FIRST night on the Farm tonight.
Opening their year's season and a week's
run with Shakespeare's "All's Well That Ends
Well," the Division of Speech and Drama to
night lays the match to the powder train of their
six-feature production schedule for the year.
Prices are low, seats allocated in a manner of
which Communists would approveâ€”first come,
first serve. The play is stream-lined to fit mod
ern sitting capabilities, the cast contains Stan
ford's best, the direction comes from one of the
original Shakespeare stream-liners and Stan
ford's director of dramatics, Thomas Woods
Stevens.
The production was made for the intimate
Little Theater anyhow, and with its Globe Thea
ter settings it should outdo the performance
last year of Shakespeare's "Winter's Tale," one
of the top hits of the Division's billings. And
the long run will give the Farm plenty of time
to play first-nighter.
In fact, it would seem that the name of the
play should be changed. With all that the
production has in its favor to start with, it might
be called,
"All's Well That Begins Well." Let the End
take care of itself.
