# Bruin on Tap

### 
TWO weeks have gone by since Stanford's
Indian has eaten and the Southern California
bear meat wandering loose appears to be a
likely entree for a post-game celebration.
The Big Red Machine is already on its way
to U.C.L.A.; its supporters will be by tonight.
Condition of the roller looks good this week—
a little dented in the mudguards, but otherwise
all right.
Tiny Thornhill has had his men out getting
up steam and putting grease in the chassis all
week with the assistance of hard work-outs.
Each night, football men have labored long
under flood-lights and a new moon. The result
is a team which looks even better than the one
which met Oregon.
There will be plenty of Stanford support in
the rooting section at the Coliseum; everything
points to a tribal feast—let's Ruin the Bruin.—
