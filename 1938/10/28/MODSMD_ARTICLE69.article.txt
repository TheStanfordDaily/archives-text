# Farm—Not a Hospital
## 
### 
MOST of Stanford is on its way to Los An
geles or will be by 9 o'clock tonight.
Whether the traveling members of the campus
will ever get there to see the team in the Coli
seum tomorrow is another matter.
Some, maybe, are going to be stopped en
route—stopped by other people heading north
in automobiles.
Those going south via S.P. haven't much to
worry about, not at present anyway. But from
the samples apparent recently of the way Stan
ford drives this year, there's plenty of doubt
that the entire 3,889 will be present Monday.
There's not a great deal to be added to that
already said by J. C. Furnas and others better
qualified to envisage the embarrassment of
being spilled all over the highway.
To those driving to the game, there is, how
ever, one parting shot which may touch off a
response:
For the sake of next quarter's registration,
BE CAREFUL.—H. L. S.
