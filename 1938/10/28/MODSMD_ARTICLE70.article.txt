# All Fired Up

STANFORD, it would seem by Campus Opin
ion letters, turned fire-bug when it became
Boathouse-conscious. Approximately two out
of three letters received in the last week want
to put the old Boathouse on the Big Game Bon
fire.
In the abstract, the idea is sterling. It has
been suggested periodically for the last decade,
and each time it is hailed with new glee. And

now that the Boathouse actually is going to bo
razed just at the time of the Bonfire, the idea
touches upon fact instead of theory.
However, it can't be done wholesale. In spite
of the brilliance of the idea, actual circum
stances throw a dampening fog over it. It seems
hardly possible, but the old Boathouse has sal
vage value, value which has been included in
the original cost estimate. Certain large beams
and planking are sound enough to be used
again, and much of the rest can be sold just as
odd lumber. It would cost Stanford a good deal
of money to cart the whole barn a hundred feet
west and set a match to it. âœ“
Stanford can have a fire out of the Boathouse,
though. But it will be all in the mind and the
feet tomorrow night at the Boathouse dance.
That frolic will be hot enough to start a fire
under the Old Boathouse which will burn it
down. And still leave timbers for salvage.
But Stanford's feet will just burn.
