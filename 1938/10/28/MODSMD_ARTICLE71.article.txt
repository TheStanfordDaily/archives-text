### JOHN COBBS 
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS DEPT.
DACK in high school at about the time when my
voice was doing high-jump stunts over the vocal
scale, I learned that society progresses and gradually
improves itself, so that each generation leaves a finer
world than it found. Occasionally since then I have
seen evidence of this. The movies have introduced
sound; the New York American has combined with
the Journal, so that there is now only one Hearst paper
in New York. Huey Long got himself shot. All of
these are encouraging signs, but the other night I re
ceived final proof of the theory. I discovered that
Encina has evolved a sponsor system that works.
My espionage service reported to me that the frosh
election situation was not developing according to the
customary Emily Post pattern. Some ot the candidates,
it seems had unleashed a broadside oi posters, while
others were distributing free chewing gum in the
best Tammany style.
>;t :|: * «
Interfraternity Council, determined to shield Ihe
growing frosh minds from the Greek letter influence,
has made Encina a Forbidden City to me. And so I
called up one of the sponsors to find out what was
going on behind its chipped sandstone face. He re
ported that the whole thing was an unfortunate mis
take, arising because the handbook this year had
omitted reference to electioneering. The sponsors, he
said, had talked to the candidates, and the situation
had cleared up faster than the complexion of a yeast-ad
hero. The offenders at that moment were out pulling
down their posters and chewing up their own gum.
The idea of a sponsor settling something without
calling out a riot squad intrigued me. I asked him
how he had worked it. And so he explained the new
Encina system.
* * * *
r FHE sponsors, it seems, give no more chain gang
hours at the Rest Home. Instead they rely on ad
vice and public opinion. The change is surprising
enough, but the really amazing thing is that the system
works. The sponsors report less malicious mischief and
assault and battery than ever before in history.
Offending frosh are still called before the sponsors'
meeting. But the personnel of the court is changed.
Instead of 20 upperclassmen trying to look moral and
stern, the frosh faces 10 sponsors and 10 elected men
of their own class.
Back in the days when I was incarcerated in En
cina, the sponsor was a sort of monster who lived in
a cave at the end of the hall. He always pounded on
my door whenever I dropped a hairbrush, but he
slept peacefully while the boys in the next room
practiced to be house wreckers. In comparison the
new breed of sponsors sound like demi-gods.
I don't believe, of course, that Encina could serve
as a model of behavior for a strict seminary. And I
rather doubt that the present sponsors are exactly
Daniels come to judgment. But under the new system
it appears that the sponsors rio longer act like a Roman
garrison in a captured town. It also appears that the
frosh no longer act as though they had just left off
hanging by their tails.
And that is not a bad definition of progress.

enough, but the really amazing thing is that the system
works. The sponsors report less malicious mischief and
assault and battery than ever before in history.
Offending frosh are still called before the sponsors'
meeting. But the personnel of the court is changed.
Instead of 20 upperclassmen trying to look moral and
stern, the frosh faces 10 sponsors and 10 elected men
of their own class.
Back in the days when I was incarcerated in En
cina, the sponsor was a sort of monster who lived in
a cave at the end of the hall. He always pounded on
my door whenever I dropped a hairbrush, but he
slept peacefully while the boys in the next room
practiced to be house wreckers. In comparison the
new breed of sponsors sound like demi-gods.
I don't believe, of course, that Encina could serve
as a model of behavior for a strict seminary. And I
rather doubt that the present sponsors are exactly
Daniels come to judgment. But under the new system
it appears that the sponsors rio longer act like a Roman
garrison in a captured town. It also appears that the
frosh no longer act as though they had just left off
hanging by their tails.
And that is not a bad definition of progress.

voice was doing high-jump stunts over the vocal
scale, I learned that society progresses and gradually
improves itself, so that each generation leaves a finer
world than it found. Occasionally since then I have
seen evidence of this. The movies have introduced
sound; the New York American has combined with
the Journal, so that there is now only one Hearst paper
in New York. Huey Long got himself shot. All of
these are encouraging signs, but the other night I re
ceived final proof of the theory. I discovered that
Encina has evolved a sponsor system that works.
My espionage service reported to me that the frosh
election situation was not developing according to the
customary Emily Post pattern. Some ot the candidates,
it seems had unleashed a broadside oi posters, while
others were distributing free chewing gum in the
best Tammany style.

Interfraternity Council, determined to shield Ihe

called up one of the sponsors to find out what was
going on behind its chipped sandstone face. He re
ported that the whole thing was an unfortunate mis
take, arising because the handbook this year had
omitted reference to electioneering. The sponsors, he
said, had talked to the candidates, and the situation
had cleared up faster than the complexion of a yeast-ad
hero. The offenders at that moment were out pulling
down their posters and chewing up their own gum.
The idea of a sponsor settling something without
calling out a riot squad intrigued me. I asked him
how he had worked it. And so he explained the new
Encina system.
