### DOUG JAQUES 
IN an icllq moment the other day I was reading last.
Friday's Daily Trojan. Or, to be quite truthful, I
I read the first paragraph of Herb Klein's sport column.
| That was enough.
His lead went: "The history of the rivalry between
I Southern California and Stanford is a story of a long
series of close, hard-fought games, and only one of
| the 18 contests between the two schools has ended
v/ith more than 19 points separating the two schools."
That's what i like to see. A real sportsman.

A friend of mine who £ets quite a kick out of read
| ing the dictionary was amazed and entertained when,
accidentally of course, he came across the word hip.
And found it is the sound introducing hurrah.
* * * *
The other night. 1 hear, a few women were stand-
I ing solemnly in front of the Libe fountains, throwing
I pennies in it. They were using it for a wishing well.
And I noticed a lot of people like to sit around it.
Well, we've got it. We might as well utilize it. We
can close our eyes and blindly throw pennies in it and
sit on it.
And hope no one pushes us.

I T WAS a beautiful moonlight ni,t» ht last Spring Quar
ter, and three romantic freshmen had dates with two
romantic freshmen women and another freshman
woman.
They went to a dance or something, and at a rea
sonably conventional time left. One woman, the un
romantie one, immediately said she was tired. She
wanted to go home. So they took her home, and then
all five of them drove up on top of a reasonably con
ventional hill.
The woman sitting in the front seat was generously
holding hands with both of the frosh, but after a time
one of them got out of the car and went around in
back to see the people in the rumble scat.
After quite a while he got tired of them, or vice
I versa, and got back in the front seat of the car. He
| had been sitting there quite a while when the other
| guy up front said:
"I hope you're 'retting a kick out of holding my
! hand. I'm not much.''
But he was enjoying holding both of the girl's
I hands.
Overheard in the Union: "I wanted to hear Ravel's
'Bol« to, hut all they wanted to hear was the 'Toy
j Trumpet' and 'Powerhouse'."

IN an icllq moment the other day I was reading last.
Friday's Daily Trojan. Or, to be quite truthful, I
I read the first paragraph of Herb Klein's sport column.
| That was enough.
His lead went: "The history of the rivalry between
I Southern California and Stanford is a story of a long
series of close, hard-fought games, and only one of
| the 18 contests between the two schools has ended
v/ith more than 19 points separating the two schools."
That's what i like to see. A real sportsman.

A friend of mine who £ets quite a kick out of read
| ing the dictionary was amazed and entertained when,
accidentally of course, he came across the word hip.
And found it is the sound introducing hurrah.
* * * *
The other night. 1 hear, a few women were stand-
I ing solemnly in front of the Libe fountains, throwing
I pennies in it. They were using it for a wishing well.
And I noticed a lot of people like to sit around it.
Well, we've got it. We might as well utilize it. We
can close our eyes and blindly throw pennies in it and
sit on it.
And hope no one pushes us.

I T WAS a beautiful moonlight ni,t» ht last Spring Quar
ter, and three romantic freshmen had dates with two
romantic freshmen women and another freshman
woman.
They went to a dance or something, and at a rea
sonably conventional time left. One woman, the un
romantie one, immediately said she was tired. She
wanted to go home. So they took her home, and then
all five of them drove up on top of a reasonably con
ventional hill.
The woman sitting in the front seat was generously
holding hands with both of the frosh, but after a time
one of them got out of the car and went around in
back to see the people in the rumble scat.
After quite a while he got tired of them, or vice
I versa, and got back in the front seat of the car. He
| had been sitting there quite a while when the other
| guy up front said:
"I hope you're 'retting a kick out of holding my
! hand. I'm not much.''
But he was enjoying holding both of the girl's
I hands.
Overheard in the Union: "I wanted to hear Ravel's
'Bol« to, hut all they wanted to hear was the 'Toy
j Trumpet' and 'Powerhouse'."
