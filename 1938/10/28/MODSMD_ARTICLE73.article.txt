## WHAT AN IDEA! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have just had the newest and
most startling idea of my entire
career of startling ideas. So com
pletely revolutionary and original is
it that I wish to give vent to it first
in your columns. Now, as you know,
no doubt, the bonfire this year is to
be built in one day only. As you
perhaps also know, Stanford is soon
to have a new boathouse. Now,
perhaps you can figure out that the
old boathouse will no longer be
needed. (Prepare yourself: Here's
my idea). I have suddenly had
the thought that perhaps we could
use the old boathouse for the fire!
(I told you I had an original idea!)
The advantages are many, as I am
sure you can see, and in consider
ation for this stupendous thought, I
will let you name the new boat
house after me.
Yours for more letters expressing
