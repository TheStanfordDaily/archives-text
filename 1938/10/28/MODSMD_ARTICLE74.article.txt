# ON THE BAND WAGON
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Pickets are bad enough, but when
they sing their songs to the tune of
"Come Join the Band," it's just a
little too much.
Last night was the first time I'd
heard them, and I was disgusted.
The pickets were parading before
the Sutter Street entrance to the
White House. Go hear them for
yourself.
The point is, can anything be done
about it? That's a fine way to use
a Stanford song.
Please do not use my name—it's
too much trouble for me to have to
stand the gaff.
