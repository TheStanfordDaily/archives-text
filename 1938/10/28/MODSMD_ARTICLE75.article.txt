Dear Children,
Now I think you had better go
and stand in the corner like the
naughty little children you are.
Please dears, don't dabble around
with mud, and get all messed up
with feature stories! I know you
are saying, "I don't see why we
can't have feature stories if the San
Jose Daily does," but deal's, when
you grow up you can write feature
stories too. You must learn the

fundamentals first. Aren't you
ashamed of yourself, stringing people
along like that, Kay dear?
Mother knows you want to grow
up and be cynical just like all the
other newspaper writers, but
Johny and Doug, are you sure
I you're keeping your noses clean?
Mother worries about you a lot.
j Let's see you all pick up, and show
i everyone that you're "our" kids!
Your loving mother
