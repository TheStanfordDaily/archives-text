"THE MOONLIGHT SONATA,"
i currently playing at San Fran
! Cisco's Larkin .and starring Padcr-
J ewski:
j Jan Ignace Paderewski is a great
I artist and a great man. One is
| tempted to speak of him in the past
j because he is now a very old man
j and because his life is already digni-

fied by tradition — j
a dignity con- I
ferred by time. !
But Paderew- \
ski is not yet
merely a legend.
To see him for
what he is — and
this picture both
inadvertently and
directly shows
him for what he is |

j —is still our privilege,
i A transcendent confidence in self,
| born of humility, serenity, and in
-1 tuition in art and life make him be
| yond petty shyness before the cam
j era. We hear him play—an old man
with a white mane of hair, a blunt
i nose, and eyes almost shut by the
: folds beneath them, who still gal
' vanizes an audience with his play-
I ing.
And through his playing and mo-
I tivated by it runs a story—by itself
! a simple, rather stereotyped little
| story, but like a refrain to his
j "Moonlight Sonata," limpid, deli
j cate, crystalline. —Slater
