# 'All's Well' Cast Wins Acclaim
## Director Stevens Tops Previous Work in Shakespeare's Comedy 
### FRANCES SLATER 
Stanford's Drama Division jerked the slightly rusty "All's Well That
Ends Well" out of Cain's warehouse last Friday. And without a micro
scopic douht we endorse it as the poods.
Thomas Wood Stevens' direction should be chalked up as the best of
his regime. He fcneiglcs around with the precious banter and florid

gags of the play until not a single♦
nuance is blurred. He studs the
whole thing with some of the most
ingenious and expressive business
I've ever seen. And he pans out a
show that goes like a sti'eak.
FAST PLOT
The play itself, with its plot of a
wise heroine who has to do some
tall scheming to win her man, is
pretty much of a gim-crack, and its
characters, the romantic comedy
conventions of their day.
That's why when Mclba Rae
Toombs as the heroine makes a real
character out of what might have
been a wax-work—when she plays
all the stops — coyness, wit, pride,
and plain emotional upset to do so
—she stamps herself as one of the
most imaginative actresses on the
campus and certainly as one who
has made the most progress in the
last year.
CADDISH HERO
From our point of view the hero
who walks out on his wife for no
good reason and scrambles up
strange balconies not for the exer
cise is a cross between a cad, a
bounder and a North American
skunk. But the Elizabethans laid
these lapses to youthful folly. It is
necessary to get that straight before
you can appreciate how well Doug
las Bryan skinned through the part
—how ably he made that hero a
spoiled brat but a potential man.
Dan Holtom, in spite of his mug
ging, was responsible for some droll
tomfoolery in the part of Parolles,
the windbag. Kae Kalenborn as the
dowager, J. P. Cahn as the mellow
king, Charles Bulotti as the bump
kin, were all excellent. And the sup
porting cast all the way down the
line did themselves proud.
COSTUMES RICH
From the velvet-clad principals to
the last be-pantied super the cast
was costumed richly and, I am al
most sure, quite authentically. The
stream-line staging helped to mjike
the play less remote, the simple sets,
to strip it to the essential.
After proving the advantages of a
classical project both for dramatic
cxercise and entertainment, Direc
tor Stevens and company will do well
not to stray afield. We are assured
at least that they will not do so
until this play ends a run which in
cludes performances tonight, tomor
row at 4 o'clock, and Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday nights.

kin, were all excellent. And the sup
porting cast all the way down the
line did themselves proud.
COSTUMES RICH
From the velvet-clad principals to
the last be-pantied super the cast
was costumed richly and, I am al
most sure, quite authentically. The
stream-line staging helped to mjike
the play less remote, the simple sets,
to strip it to the essential.
After proving the advantages of a
classical project both for dramatic
cxercise and entertainment, Direc
tor Stevens and company will do well
not to stray afield. We are assured
at least that they will not do so
until this play ends a run which in
cludes performances tonight, tomor
row at 4 o'clock, and Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday nights.
Stanford's Drama Division jerked the slightly rusty "All's Well That
Ends Well" out of Cain's warehouse last Friday. And without a micro
scopic douht we endorse it as the poods.
Thomas Wood Stevens' direction should be chalked up as the best of
his regime. He fcneiglcs around with the precious banter and florid

gags of the play until not a single♦
nuance is blurred. He studs the
whole thing with some of the most
ingenious and expressive business
I've ever seen. And he pans out a
show that goes like a sti'eak.
FAST PLOT
The play itself, with its plot of a
wise heroine who has to do some
tall scheming to win her man, is
pretty much of a gim-crack, and its
characters, the romantic comedy
conventions of their day.
That's why when Mclba Rae
Toombs as the heroine makes a real
character out of what might have
been a wax-work—when she plays
all the stops — coyness, wit, pride,
and plain emotional upset to do so
—she stamps herself as one of the
most imaginative actresses on the
campus and certainly as one who
has made the most progress in the
last year.
CADDISH HERO
From our point of view the hero
who walks out on his wife for no
good reason and scrambles up
strange balconies not for the exer
cise is a cross between a cad, a
bounder and a North American
skunk. But the Elizabethans laid
these lapses to youthful folly. It is
necessary to get that straight before
you can appreciate how well Doug
las Bryan skinned through the part
—how ably he made that hero a
spoiled brat but a potential man.
Dan Holtom, in spite of his mug
ging, was responsible for some droll
tomfoolery in the part of Parolles,
the windbag. Kae Kalenborn as the
dowager, J. P. Cahn as the mellow
king, Charles Bulotti as the bump
kin, were all excellent. And the sup
porting cast all the way down the
line did themselves proud.
