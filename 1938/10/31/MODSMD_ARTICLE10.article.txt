# Soph Cotillion May Feature HollywoodStar
## Bids for Annual Dance Continue On Sale at $2.50 
### 
Although little definite could be
learned, reports from a usually re
liable source late last night disclosed
that "maybe some famed cinema
celebrity will be the Sophomore
Class's guest of honor" at its annual
Cotillion to be held Friday, Novem
bei 4, in the Women's Gym.
Although all plans and arrange
ments had been made for housing,
feeding, transporting, and enter
taining the "Sophomore Guest" dur
ing her week-end stay on the Farm,
final negotiations had not yet been
made.
Maestro for the Cotillion, chief
campus dance of the fall quarter,
will be Eddie Fitzpatrick featuring
his "Big-Name" band and Vocalist
Rex Baker. Fitzpatrick and his
svelte, sophisticated style of music
are well known to Stanford audi
ences through extended engage
ments in San Francisco and the Bay
area.
Theme for the function is "Let's
Go Slumming" in London's roman
tic old Limehouse district. Decora
tions will carry out the motif.
B.A.C. police and hat-check boys
will be dressed like "Bobbies" or
other suitable characters of the lo
cality. Novel to campus dances will
be tablesâ€”at which people may sit.
Bids, going fast at $2.50, will con
tinue on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
until the limited supply has been
exhausted.
