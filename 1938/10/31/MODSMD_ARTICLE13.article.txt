# Six Named As Rhodes Candidates
## Stanford Committee Sends Killefer, Cobbs To California Board 
### 
Six Stanford students were nomi
nated for consideration by state
Rhodes Scholarship committees when
the University Rhodes committee
met last Friday, Dr. Philip W. Buck,
chairman, announced yesterday.
Tom Killefer, graduate law student
and student manager of the A. S.
S. U., and John Cobbs, economics
major, were nominated to the Cali
fornia committee, which will meet
about December 13 in either San
Francisco or Los Angeles.
The remaining four were recom
mended to other state committees.
Herbert B. Woolley, economics, was
nominated to Utah; Philip Halla, po
litical science, to Florida; Robert B.
Livingston, biology, to Oregon; and
Robert L. Lamborn, to Maryland.
COMMITTEE PLEASED
"The committee was very much
gratified with the general qualities
of the group of candidates," said Dr.
Buck. "We hope to have as many
good ones next year."
He pointed out that while two
had been nominated to the California
committee, four others had taken
advantage of the opportunity to go
to other state committees, spreading
the competition out.
When the various state commit
tees meet in December, they will
select two students from the lists
turned in by each university and
recommend them to the committee
of the district in which the state is
located.
SELECTION METHOD
Each district committee considers
nominees from six states, or twelve
nominees in all. From this group,
four are selected for Rhodes schol
arships, of which there are an
nually 32 available in the nation.
A Rhodes scholarship entitles the
holder to three years at Oxford
University, with an income of 400
pounds per year to pursue studies in
his field of chief interest. The stu
dent, who must be an unmarried
man, is required to spend at least
two of the three years at Oxford,
but may take his third year any
where.
Dr. Buck, who is associate pro
fessor of political science, was a
Rhodes scholar from Idaho in 1923.
Dr. George S. Parks, professor of
chemistry, and Dr. John Wendell
Dodds, associate professor of Eng
lish, are also members of the com
mittee.

turned in by each university and
recommend them to the committee
of the district in which the state is
located.
SELECTION METHOD
Each district committee considers
nominees from six states, or twelve
nominees in all. From this group,
four are selected for Rhodes schol
arships, of which there are an
nually 32 available in the nation.
A Rhodes scholarship entitles the
holder to three years at Oxford
University, with an income of 400
pounds per year to pursue studies in
his field of chief interest. The stu
dent, who must be an unmarried
man, is required to spend at least
two of the three years at Oxford,
but may take his third year any
where.
Dr. Buck, who is associate pro
fessor of political science, was a
Rhodes scholar from Idaho in 1923.
Dr. George S. Parks, professor of
chemistry, and Dr. John Wendell
Dodds, associate professor of Eng
lish, are also members of the com
mittee.
