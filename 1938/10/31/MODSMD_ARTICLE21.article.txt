# Iraq Sends Fedhila, Majdia to Stanford
## 
### KATHERINE JOHNSEN 
Last month two women arrived at Dean Yost's office to register at
Stanford after travelling across half of the globe—from their native Iraq,
the land tucked between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, where an ad
vanced civilization flourished in 4000 8.C., where were told the tales of
Arabian Nights, but where Garbo and Gable are now favorites, and where

teiepnones, automobiles, refrigera
tion, and night clubs fit into the tone
of life.
They arc Fedhila Dinno, senior
biology major, and Majdia Dawaff,
junior math major —and from 6000
years of Mesopotamian civilization,
she is the first woman to specialize
in math.
Fedhila lives in Mosul on the
Tigris, and Majdia in Bagdad, the
capital of the British mandate of
Iraq. Both girls are Christians, al
though about 80 per cent of the pop
ulation is Moslem, and were selected
by the government to come to Stan
ford to study.
LINGUISTIC ABILITY
Both women speak English per
fectly, as well as their native
Arabian. It was on the journey over
here that they had their language
difficulties. In France they learned
one French word, "Combicn?" (How
much?).
In Iraq there arc no universities.
There are colleges — none of which
arc co-educational. But Fedhila, as
a junior, attended an American
university in Syria where 25 women
were permitted to attend classes
with the 1700 men students. This in
troduction of women into universi
ties brings with it the first step in
the unveiling of Moslem women;
their veils are not worn in classes.
It is only in this instance that a
Moslem woman shows her bare face
to a man who is not her relative.
"You are much more liberal here
— and less conventional," remarked
Fedhila.
USUAL COMMENT
And then she added a comment
that has come to be expected from
foreigners:
"But you arc always rushing —
i you're always going somewhere—we
[ never have to rush."
Football, tennis and ice cream arc
I not new to these women. But cokes
are. They wear the same clothes
here that they do in Iraq. But, they
are still trying to get used to the
food. The coffee is "awful"—so dif
ferent from the Turkish coffee.
Have they had any experience
with our free-ride-into-Paly sys
tem? Yes. One day they were
waiting for the bus when a boy camc
