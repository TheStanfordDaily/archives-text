# Iraq Sends Fedhila, Majdia to Stanford
## 
### KATHERINE JOHNSEN 
Last month two women arrived at Dean Yost's office to register at
Stanford after travelling across half of the globe—from their native Iraq,
the land tucked between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, where an ad
vanced civilization flourished in 4000 8.C., where were told the tales of
Arabian Nights, but where Garbo and Gable are now favorites, and where

teiepnones, automobiles, refrigera
tion, and night clubs fit into the tone
of life.
They arc Fedhila Dinno, senior
biology major, and Majdia Dawaff,
junior math major —and from 6000
years of Mesopotamian civilization,
she is the first woman to specialize
in math.
Fedhila lives in Mosul on the
Tigris, and Majdia in Bagdad, the
capital of the British mandate of
Iraq. Both girls are Christians, al
though about 80 per cent of the pop
ulation is Moslem, and were selected
by the government to come to Stan
ford to study.
LINGUISTIC ABILITY
Both women speak English per
fectly, as well as their native
Arabian. It was on the journey over
here that they had their language
difficulties. In France they learned
one French word, "Combicn?" (How
much?).
In Iraq there arc no universities.
There are colleges — none of which
arc co-educational. But Fedhila, as
a junior, attended an American
university in Syria where 25 women
were permitted to attend classes
with the 1700 men students. This in
troduction of women into universi
ties brings with it the first step in
the unveiling of Moslem women;
their veils are not worn in classes.
It is only in this instance that a
Moslem woman shows her bare face
to a man who is not her relative.
"You are much more liberal here
— and less conventional," remarked
Fedhila.
USUAL COMMENT
And then she added a comment
that has come to be expected from
foreigners:
"But you arc always rushing —
i you're always going somewhere—we
[ never have to rush."
Football, tennis and ice cream arc
I not new to these women. But cokes
are. They wear the same clothes
here that they do in Iraq. But, they
are still trying to get used to the
food. The coffee is "awful"—so dif
ferent from the Turkish coffee.
Have they had any experience
with our free-ride-into-Paly sys
tem? Yes. One day they were
waiting for the bus when a boy camc
by, stopped his ear, and wiggled hi.'
finger. It was so silly for someone
to wiggle his finger like that, anc
Majdia and Fedhila thought it wa;
so funny thev laughed and laughed
QUEEREST THING
But the Cellar—that's the queer
est thing of all about Stanford. One
morning they were sitting dowr
waiting for their breakfast to b(
i served them when a hasher came uj
' and told them if they wanted some-
I thing to eat they would have to gc
' up to the counter and sit. So they
| went and sat there.
But they feh so funny sitting and
eating breakfast at the same table
| with everyone else, that when the
man asked them for their order they
j could only laugh and laugh.
Fedhila orders tea, orange juice.
! and toast for breakfast — because
I ihen she knows what she is getting.
! But Majdia—a little braver—some
times orders some "buttered" milk
| with her toast.

SAN DIEGO, Oct. 30 (UP).—Al
though its famed rushing and pass
ing attack was stopped, America's
highest scoring unbeaten football
team, San Jose State, succeeded in
turning back San Diego State 14 to 0
Saturday. By running back two in
tercepted passes for touchdowns the
Spartans won their seventh consec
utive victory.
