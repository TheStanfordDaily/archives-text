# Beachcombers' Union Rehashes U.C.L.A. Game
## John Ryland Named 'Outstanding Player' In Indians' Defeat 
### HARRY PRESS Managing Editor 
SUNNY SANTA MONICA, Oct.
30 (Special to The Daily).—The book
is closed on Saturday's shenanigans
in the Coliseum, and although the
bookworms already have built nests
in the fast-thickening dust on the
title page, there's still room for a
wee bit of addenda.
The local quarterbacks—all mem
bers in good standing of Beach
combers' Local No. I—are still mut
tering in their seaweed beards about
the hot-and-cold Red Roller.
Main query concerns the why and
wherefore of yesterday's Indian
eleven:
THAT LAST MINUTE
How come Thornhill's gang didn't,
play the whole game as they did in
the last Madhouse Minute?
No one, not even those who lis
tened in on the after-game conver
sations in the dressing rooms, could
supply a conclusive answer.
Honorary Beachcomber Bill Ack
erman, U.C.L.A.'s graduate manager,
supplied a hint when lie told Tiny,
after the tilt, that "Stanford put on
the show, but we won the game."
Concensus of all Beachcombers pres
ent was that Ackerman was right—
Stanford put on the show, but didn't
have enough punch-lines in the
script to put the show over.
ONE-MAN TEAM
Next business before the house
ended with unanimous approval of
the motion of Tony Calvelli, Stan
ford's aII-American center, to the
effect that U.C.L.A.'s center, Johnny
Ryland, was in his opinion "the only
outstanding player on their team —
fast, tricky, and their whole de
fense."
After a mass move into the warm
water to prevent sunburn, the local
Adonises gathered once more to ex
press regret to "Cookie" South for
a broken collar-bone, regret to
Johnny Ryland for a broken nose,
and congratulations to Fred Lede
bocr and Stan Anderson, co-winners
of its player-of-the-week award.
The regrets and awards arc be
ing sent. 1o their respective recipi
ents under separate cover.
