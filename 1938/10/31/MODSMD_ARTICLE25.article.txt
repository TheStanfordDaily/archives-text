# Final Rally Fails To Catch Bruin In Indian Trap
## Stanford Team Gains Confidence Despite 6-0 Loss to U.C.L.A. 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Saturday, Oct. 2!) (Special to The Daily).
—They played their best game. Having stalked a frightened Bruin to
within ten yards of its lair in a frenzied last-minute attempt to prove that
the score did not tell the tale, a tired hand of Stanford Indians returned
their arrows to their quivers with only a wish that they had another
minute to play.
Visions of the most dramatic victory of the season gunned the pulses
of several hundred Stanford rooters this afternoon when Al Alustiza re-

■ covered the ball, fumbled by a
stalling Bruin offense, on his own
41-yard line.
32 SECONDS TO PLAY
A giant stop-watch on the Coli
seum scoreboard told the Cards they
had 32 seconds to prove their might.
It looked like a long way to go in
32 seconds, but a time period and
out of-bounds passes stopped the
clock conveniently so that signals
could be called during huddles on
company time.
Johnny Brenner, hot after only
two minutes' warm-up, pulled in
Fred Ledeboer's first toss for a first
down on the Uclan 44. Another to
Gallarneau put the apple on the 15.
Everyone straining his eyes to keep
one on the clock, 37,000 fans stood
in a dead silence as the Cards, with
11 seconds to go, used six in two
futile pass attempts. Both into the
sidelines.
GUN DROWNED IN HOOTING
Five seconds gave time for only
the fastest play. Cheers from the
red and white block drowned out the
gun as Brenner jumped high on the
10-yard line, but the clock had
stopped when he fell into the arms
of Kenny • Washington and Jack
Somers.
Cookie South was in the game
only long enough to show the Bruin
backs they were not the only run
ners who could change pace and
turn on a dime. This dark horse left
early in the second quarter with a
broken collar-bone that will keep
him out the rest of the season. Norm
Standlee loomed for the first time as
a triple-threat man with a quick
kick performance that kept the In
dian punt average well out of the
red.
TACKLES REACH PEAK
Stanfoi-d's huge first-string tackles,
Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen,
reached their peak against the
Bruins. Their performance on de
fense was particularly good, and the
Uclans seldom passed midfield
against the Indian starters.
Hamp Pool played his guard po
sition with fight and determination
that will remove all doubt in Coach
Tiny Thornhill's mjnd about whether
the tall blond speed-burner should
have been moved from the backfield.
The Big Red Machine came out on
the short end of a 6-0 score, but the
loss will not be discouraging. Sta
tistics were in favor of the Indians,
and five Stanford ball - carriers
earned fat plus averages.
A timid Indian has at last discov
ered his capabilities, and he has four
more chances to pile up the only
statistics that really count.

two minutes' warm-up, pulled in
Fred Ledeboer's first toss for a first
down on the Uclan 44. Another to
Gallarneau put the apple on the 15.
Everyone straining his eyes to keep
one on the clock, 37,000 fans stood
in a dead silence as the Cards, with
11 seconds to go, used six in two
futile pass attempts. Both into the
sidelines.
GUN DROWNED IN HOOTING
Five seconds gave time for only
the fastest play. Cheers from the
red and white block drowned out the
gun as Brenner jumped high on the
10-yard line, but the clock had
stopped when he fell into the arms
of Kenny • Washington and Jack
Somers.
Cookie South was in the game
only long enough to show the Bruin
backs they were not the only run
ners who could change pace and
turn on a dime. This dark horse left
early in the second quarter with a
broken collar-bone that will keep
him out the rest of the season. Norm
Standlee loomed for the first time as
a triple-threat man with a quick
kick performance that kept the In
dian punt average well out of the
red.
TACKLES REACH PEAK
Stanfoi-d's huge first-string tackles,
Pete Zagar and Stan Andersen,
reached their peak against the
Bruins. Their performance on de
fense was particularly good, and the
Uclans seldom passed midfield
against the Indian starters.
Hamp Pool played his guard po
sition with fight and determination
that will remove all doubt in Coach
Tiny Thornhill's mjnd about whether
the tall blond speed-burner should
have been moved from the backfield.
The Big Red Machine came out on
the short end of a 6-0 score, but the
loss will not be discouraging. Sta
tistics were in favor of the Indians,
and five Stanford ball - carriers
earned fat plus averages.
A timid Indian has at last discov
ered his capabilities, and he has four
more chances to pile up the only
statistics that really count.
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM, Saturday, Oct. 2!) (Special to The Daily).
—They played their best game. Having stalked a frightened Bruin to
within ten yards of its lair in a frenzied last-minute attempt to prove that
the score did not tell the tale, a tired hand of Stanford Indians returned
their arrows to their quivers with only a wish that they had another
minute to play.
Visions of the most dramatic victory of the season gunned the pulses
of several hundred Stanford rooters this afternoon when Al Alustiza re-

■ covered the ball, fumbled by a
stalling Bruin offense, on his own
41-yard line.
32 SECONDS TO PLAY
A giant stop-watch on the Coli
seum scoreboard told the Cards they
had 32 seconds to prove their might.
It looked like a long way to go in
32 seconds, but a time period and
out of-bounds passes stopped the
clock conveniently so that signals
could be called during huddles on
company time.
Johnny Brenner, hot after only
two minutes' warm-up, pulled in
Fred Ledeboer's first toss for a first
