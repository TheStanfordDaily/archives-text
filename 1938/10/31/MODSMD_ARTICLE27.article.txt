### 
BERLIN, Oct. 30 (UP).—The Ger
man Gestapo (secret police) an- I
nounced tonight that about 10,000 \
Polish Jews, dumped across the !
frontier into Poland before the two !
countries agreed to a truce in their i
passport controversy, must find their I
own means of returning to their j
homes and families.
Many of these Poles, rushed to j
the frontier by trainloads in the j
Reich's mass deportation, were pen- j
niless in a "motherland" whose lan- |
guage a large part of them cannot |
speak and which is just as anxious j
to get rid of them as was Germany, j
Seized from their families with
out warning in swift police raids
throughout the Reich, the majority
of them tonight were housed tempo- I
rarily in old barracks in a virtual
"no-man's-land" along the Polish- [
German frontier.
Poland, whose threat to rescind j
their citizenship i - esulted in Ger- |
many's mass expulsion order, re- |
fused to let them proceed into the i
interior and the Nazi Gestapo told :
I hem that they must depend oh their j
own resources or Jewish welfare or
ganizations to reach the Reich.

Cricket is presumed to have origi- i
nated in England in the thirteenth j
century, and was a well-established
sport during the fourteenth century.
