# Varsity Waterpoloists Take S.C. 4-3
## Offense Functions Well In Hard Game 
### 
Stanford's water-polo varsity lÂ»alanced the Cardinal sports ledger
Saturday by trimming a strong U.S.C. team 4-11 in a rough battle in the
Eneina pool.
By tightening their defense in the pinches and producing a smooth -
functioning offensive attack, the Thorntonmen were able to defeat the
highly touted Trojan squad.
Southern Cal grabbed an early two-goal lead before the ( aids started
clicking. Stanford tallied two goals in successive thrusts, but S.C. snatched
the lead back and scored their third#

and final goal. In a last-minute
spurt, Stanford scored twice more to
cinch the game.
LAMB OUTSTANDING
Captain John Lamb played an
outstanding offensive game, scoring
three goals. Jack Loupe turned in
his usual fine performance, making
one point and assisting in the others.
Both men played the forward posi
tions.
Bob Plate, Harv Rothschild, Ted
Moreno, Dick Hoover, and Roy Vi
tousek completed the line-up and all
played superior ball. The consistent
defensive play of these men saved
the game by staving off S.C. scoring
thrusts.
The game was unusually hard
fought and was marred by numer
ous injuries. Advanced dope named
the Trojans as the toughest team in
the conference, but three of their
men received injuries. The cards
received no injuries worse than
bloody noses.
STANFORD UNDEFEATED
This victory leaves Stanford un
defeated in conference play, since
they defeated U.C.L.A. last week.
The conference championship is now
much closer, especially as California
beat S.C. by only one goal.
Meanwhile the Card i'rosh squad
thrashed a Paly High team 13 to 7
in the preliminary contest. The
yearlings piled up a large lead in
the first period, and played loosely
in the second half, allowing Paly five
goals.
Fred Manwaring and Had Bacon
scored five goals each, with Duncan
Patty adding three more. Scott Dud
ley, John Pollock, J. Smith, and John
Holton also turned in fine showings.
Old man weather also played ball
with the teams, for he stopped the
drenching rain just before the games
started. A large crowd viewed both
contests.
