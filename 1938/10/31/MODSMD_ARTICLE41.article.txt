# Soccermen Get First Setback
## S. J. State Conquers Cards in Muddy Play 
### 
Playing against a heavier and
more rugged team from San Jose
State, the Stanford varsity soccer
team lost a game for the first time
this season, four goals to two, Sat
urday morning on the wet San Jose
field.
The loss marked the first mar on
the Indians' record this year. Pre
viously wins were marked up over
San Mateo J. C., Menlo J. C.. U.S.F.,
and a tie game played against S. F.
J. C.
With the field soaked by the
downpour during the entire game,
the lighter Stanford forward wall
was unable to uncork the offensive
charge that was evident during the
past three games.
Carrying the brunt of the battle
for Stanford were the fullbacks and
goalie, who turned in a brilliant per
formance collectively.
After San Jose had scored during
the first quarter, Gunther Gerbstedt
I tallied on a free kick 35 yards out,
Ito tie the score. The only other
| Stanford tally came late in the sec-
I ond quarter when Chris Santum fol
! lowed in Gerbstedt's frep kick to
| score on the San Jose goal keeper's
misplay.
With the score knotted at two
I apiece at the half, San Jose resumed
. the lead when a penalty kick against
Stanford was converted. The final
| score came also in the third quarter.
