by Deanna Durbin in the
press box at the Coliseum was a
bit distracting for one who was try
ing to cover a football game—but it
was fun (even though she already
had a date for Saturday night).
She was rooting for the Bruins,
but she must have thought the In
dians were dangerous, because she
kept her fingers crossed the whole
time. Deanna knew football, was
good at predicting each team's next
move.
She liked the Stanford band, and
sang the selections she approved of
most. "Margie" was her favorite,
with "Alexander's Ragtime Band" a
close second.

| | EN'S and women's councils
were well-represented on the
Stanford Special by A1 Horn and
Gretchen Ahlswede. Men and
women were cleared out of each
other's cars at a reasonable hour,
and there was plenty of excite
ment in the lounge, dancing, and
dining cars.
But those who did not come
down before Friday night missed
some big times at YVestwood, ac
cording to reports. It was home
coming time for the Uclans, and
(he Stanford tilt must have meant
a great deal to them. The game
was the theme of many elaborate
floats, and a bonfire, except for
the fireworks that went with it,
must have made Stanford rooters
homesick. Pajamas had been worn
to classes as well as at the rally.
The Hollywood color was well
handled by searchlights enough
for a Grauman's premiere and
speeches by Joe E. Brown, Leo
Carrillo, and Jane Withers. Stan
ford color was contributed by
Beebs Lee. Motto for the whole
a(£air was "Let's plow through the
Farm."
* »!!(!
J ESS pleasing was the color added
by the Bruin rooting section at
the game. A long and well-rehears
ed song written about the Indians to
the tune of "How Dry I Am" was
really clever, but a constant "Boo
boo" trying in vain to drown out
the axe yell and "Come Join the
Band" played to waltz time were
hard to appreciate.
It has been long forgotten thai
Stanford for three years was the
only university that would tolerate
U.C.L.A. as a member of the Pa
cific Coast Conference, and during
that time—not too long ago—Stan
ford helped them out by including
the Bruins as a post-season oppo
nent.
Perhaps the Stanford rooters' yel
for "Sawtelle Tech" was impro
priate.

|>ENALTIES usually have a bad
psychological effect on the
Card gridders, and their faces be
came as long as their shadows
late Saturday afternoon as the sun
lowered toward the edge of the
Coliseum. But soon the referee
began to carry the ball the other
way, and the Card morale returned
in time for the final drive that
made a dead game a thriller.

; IT was hard to draw a comparison
| between Tony Calvelli and John
! r.y Ryland, because Tony was not
j well enough to stay on the field 60
minutes. Ryland was really good
' and figured in every play. But Stan
! ford's Tony Calvelli would not be
! playing behind him on any ball club.
As long as Tony looks as good on
| a losing team as Ryland looks
when he's winning nobody can doubt
Tony's claim to All-American
honors.

r | WCKLING, for the first time
this season, was one of the
Cards' long suits. They were
n't pulling their opponents down
by the neck this week, and every
low tackle was hard and decisive.
No Bruin carried the ball with an
Indian on his ankles.
When the Bruins were making
their goal-line push, the backs
were hit so hard each time that
they must have felt it was hardly
worth the chance of getting tack
led to attempt a touchdown.
And many times when a Bruin
caught a punt or intercepted a
| pass, he was pinned in his tracks
1 before he could take a step.

W/HILE a sports editor begins a
] new precedent of traveling at

' The Daily's expense to give the
home folks the inside dope on what
happens on foreign gridirons, some
body has to stay home and do the
dirty work. The assistant sports edi
| tor is left holding the bag.
While the job of keeping the cogs
in a staff of 18 sports writers run
! ning smoothly is a simple one when
i you have been doing it daily for
five weeks, there can be nothing
more confusing nor more trying
! than to have the whole job sud
denly dropped .for a day into your
lap like a baby on the doorstep of a
timid bachelor.
And to top it off, the sports edi
j tor takes your own baby, the foot
; ball beat, off your hands just when
! you want most to carry it in your
J arms.'
Many thanks, Arch Jenkins, for
! playing the part of "the one he left
behind." You have done your part
in setting a worthy precedent, and
here's looking to the time when
| you'll -.be passing the buck your
! self.
