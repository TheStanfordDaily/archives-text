THE Palo Alto Times, long accustomed to
comment with kindly paternalism on the
foibles of the Farm in general and the Speech
and Drama Division in particular, has done it
again.
This time it's the Division's production of
"All's Well That Ends Well," and the Times
outdoes itself.
It seems the Farm's all right, but Shake
speare's not so hot. The production's wonder
ful but the play's putrid. The Bard of Avon—-
Our Bill—is nothing more nor less than Ob
scene.
According to the Times's reviewer, "All's
Well" is "not so satisfactory." Its story, it
seems, is "not only fundamentally vulgar but
to present-day ideas hardly credible, whatever
may have been the reaction in Elizabethan times
with their different emphasis on the position
of woman."
The hero, furthermore, is "a downright rot
ter," and the heroine "a woman who stops at
nothing to get her man." Place them in the
midst of "a story in the Boccaccio tradition,
wherein the object is to beguile the jaded ap
petite of a decadent audience by the relation
of clever plots to intrigue," and you can see
why they have thrown the Times into a veri
table dither.
You can also, perhaps, see why they are
enjoying a solid success in Stanford's Little
Theater. "The jaded appetite of a decadent
audience" we may have; but according to the
Times's own reviewer, we like "All's Well."
The language may be strong, the biology ap
parent, but we can take it. Our equilibrium,
fortunately for the University, is somewhat
evener than that of the Times.
Of course, it's possible we're being too harsh.
They may have a point. Shakespeare may be
Crass. But if so, the Speech and Drama Division
is sitting pretty.
If it's as bad as all that, it's a sell-out.—A. S. D.
