# Abbe Dimnet Speaks Here Tomorrow
## Noted Frenchman To Discuss Education In England, France 
### 
"The vital, untrammeled educa
tion of America puts no obstacles
between culture and creativeness,"
declares Abbe Ernest Dimnet, noted
French priest, author, and philoso
pher, who tomorrow night will dis
cuss "Literature and Education in
France and America" at a lecture of
the Tuesday Evening Series in Me
morial Hall auditorium.
Explaining that, contrary to that
of the United States, "the education
al system of France is based mostly
on literary criticism, but does not
favor creation," Abbe Dimnet as
serts that, "when the requirements of
the best colleges raise the standards
of high schools, the golden age of
American literature will come."
LEFT FRANCE RECENTLY
The Jesuit priest, who left his
counti'y home near the Belgian bor
der only two weeks ago, witnessed
at first hand the French people's
panic caused by Adolf Hitler's re-
I cent militaristic moves in central
Europe.
Abbe Dimnet, who in a recent in
terview called Hitler "a black devil
who has done much to upset the
serenity of the world," declared that
the French people "have nothing left
but the desire to find truth without
prejudice."
It is the French priest's opinion
that Europe's fear of "Hitlerism" is
far greater than its fear of Com
munism. Tlie Abbe explains that, in
his travels on the continent of Eu
rope, he has found that the reaction
of America as a whole to the actions
cf the German chancellor is both
"strong and definite."
BRUTALITY TRIUMPHS'
That religious persecutions by both
II Duce and the Nazi fuehrer are
merely the triumph of brutality over
reason, is the assertion of the Abbe
Dimnet, who describes these perse
cutions as "fantastic," explaining
tjhat "I try to believe—and must be
! ljeve—that something always hap
pens to save civilization."
The Abbe, canon of the Cathedral
of Cabrai, has visited the campus on
two previous occasions, once in 1927
when he gave one lecture, and two
years later when he presented a
series of three. He has served as
Lowell lecturer at Harvard Univer
sity and was a French spokesman at
the Williamstown Institute of Poli
tics in 1923.

tics in 1923.
"The vital, untrammeled educa
tion of America puts no obstacles
between culture and creativeness,"
declares Abbe Ernest Dimnet, noted
French priest, author, and philoso
pher, who tomorrow night will dis
cuss "Literature and Education in
France and America" at a lecture of
the Tuesday Evening Series in Me
morial Hall auditorium.
Explaining that, contrary to that
of the United States, "the education
al system of France is based mostly
on literary criticism, but does not
favor creation," Abbe Dimnet as
serts that, "when the requirements of
the best colleges raise the standards
of high schools, the golden age of
American literature will come."
LEFT FRANCE RECENTLY
The Jesuit priest, who left his
counti'y home near the Belgian bor
der only two weeks ago, witnessed
at first hand the French people's
panic caused by Adolf Hitler's re-
I cent militaristic moves in central
Europe.
Abbe Dimnet, who in a recent in
terview called Hitler "a black devil
who has done much to upset the
serenity of the world," declared that
the French people "have nothing left
but the desire to find truth without
prejudice."
It is the French priest's opinion
that Europe's fear of "Hitlerism" is
far greater than its fear of Com
munism. Tlie Abbe explains that, in
his travels on the continent of Eu
rope, he has found that the reaction
of America as a whole to the actions
cf the German chancellor is both
"strong and definite."
BRUTALITY TRIUMPHS'
That religious persecutions by both
II Duce and the Nazi fuehrer are
merely the triumph of brutality over
reason, is the assertion of the Abbe
Dimnet, who describes these perse
cutions as "fantastic," explaining
tjhat "I try to believe—and must be
! ljeve—that something always hap
pens to save civilization."
The Abbe, canon of the Cathedral
of Cabrai, has visited the campus on
two previous occasions, once in 1927
when he gave one lecture, and two
years later when he presented a
series of three. He has served as
Lowell lecturer at Harvard Univer
sity and was a French spokesman at
the Williamstown Institute of Poli
tics in 1923.
