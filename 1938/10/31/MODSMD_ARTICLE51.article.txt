# Roses Are Red, But...
## 
### 
THE time has come for Stanford to recognize
that Rose Bowl blossoms are going to bloom
either Blue and Gold or Red and Gold this New
Year's Day—not Cardinal.
Up until this time, most of the campus, The
Daily, and San Francisco sports writers have
not admitted that fact, for before the U.C.L.A.
game there were still too many "ifs," most of
them depending upon the outcome of Satur
day's games.
I rue, Stanford lost its game on the breaks.
By all rights the Indians should have had at
least one touchdown and a conversion in the
fourth quarter, and there is a certain amount
of consolation in the fact. Especially, since the
game was so nearly one with most of the regu
lar first-string backfield conspicuously absent.
The score remains 6-0, however, and Stan
ford's bloom has been nipped in the bud.
Although not to the extent of giving up alto
gether, for the Big Game is still ahead. There
is plenty of chance that Stanford will win it,
underdog though it may be.
As to the entire football situation, many are
dissatisfied because Stanford hasn't had a
straight-win season. These are the ones who
regard football as a business and a paying
business only when winning. They forget that
football at this University is played just as
much for its quality as an athletic sport as it is
for the money involved, even though the same
is not true at other colleges.
They forget, too, that it is sometimes more
sport to have a team that doesn't win all its
games, more fun to back a squad that is not
always on top. A squad that is more human
than machine-like.
Whether football critics like it or not, it is

this type of team that Stanford has, and because
of its faults and its defeats, the Cardinal is still
waving although not around the Rose Bowl.—
