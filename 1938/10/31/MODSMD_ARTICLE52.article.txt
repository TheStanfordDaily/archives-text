### JOHN COBBS 
MY MOTHER WON'T LET ME
A. BUNCH of the brothers dropped in the other night
just at bedtime and, finding my cigarettes exposed,
settled down to discuss the state of the nation. The
heaviest of them leaned back in my chair, and kicked
meditatively at the bell on my typewriter.
"The trouble with this University," he said in the
manner of a Greek oracle getting off a particularly good
bit of prophesy, "is that it's too damn paternalistic."
At this point I shoved the cigarettes in my bathrobe
pocket and courteously turned out the lights. The
oracle departed leaving behind him a large scar in the
back of the typewriter, and the question of Stanford's
paternalism.
* * * *
My foot-swinging brother was not the first student
to accuse dear alma mater of being too insistent about
washing behind our intellectual and moral ears. That
complaint has circulated around the Farm ever since
the race horses first moved over to make room for the
sandstone walls.
And today the University would have to do quite a
little explaining if it tried to deny that its policies are
tinged with a mildly autocratic pjfternalism. Last week
we were informed that the Big Game bonfire would
have to be built in one day, because it was too exciting
for the Roble girls. It is true, of course, that the basis
for that ruling was an Ex Committee decision of some
years ago. But the old rule had been forgotten, and
it was the administration that made the present de
cision.
In exactly the same way, a cautious mother tells her
children that they cannot go to the cowboy picture
because Utile sister might get excited.
* * * *
f T I HERE is also the Bawlout which appears every
quarter like a kindergarten encouragement list,
designed to make backward students work harder.
The only difference is that in kindergarten the good
students get gold stars and are given more considera
tion when they ask permission to go wash their hands.
Stanford's lockout system is another example of the
way dear alma mater hangs to our coat-tails. And
the ban on public speeches on controversial subjects
bears a strong resemblance to the old command, "Now
don't you dare play with those nasty little boys in
the alley."
* * * *
All of this is vaguely irritating, and it makes us won
der if we aren't being a little silly when we pity the
poor masses in the totalitarian states. But when we
check back through University history, we find Stan
ford is gradually becoming more liberal. Student gov
ernment has been introduced. The honor system has
been tried, and we no longer have proctors breathing
down our necks during exams. Even the copper
riveted lockout system has relaxed gradually.
Like other universities, Stanford is flirting with
the idea that by the time a man gets to college he
may be able to decide a few things for himself. And
it is slowly discarding the principles that came down to
us from the Victorian era, when a birch rod was rated
far above the slide rule in educational value.
* * * *
The comments of my brother, the oracle, are a
part of that trend. And so my only hope at the present
is that the rate of progress will speed up. This busi
ness of being part of a trend is hard on typewriters and
cigarettes.

paternalism.

My foot-swinging brother was not the first student
to accuse dear alma mater of being too insistent about
washing behind our intellectual and moral ears. That
complaint has circulated around the Farm ever since
the race horses first moved over to make room for the
sandstone walls.
And today the University would have to do quite a
little explaining if it tried to deny that its policies are
tinged with a mildly autocratic pjfternalism. Last week
we were informed that the Big Game bonfire would
have to be built in one day, because it was too exciting
for the Roble girls. It is true, of course, that the basis
for that ruling was an Ex Committee decision of some
years ago. But the old rule had been forgotten, and
it was the administration that made the present de
cision.
In exactly the same way, a cautious mother tells her
children that they cannot go to the cowboy picture
because Utile sister might get excited.

f T I HERE is also the Bawlout which appears every
quarter like a kindergarten encouragement list,
designed to make backward students work harder.
The only difference is that in kindergarten the good
students get gold stars and are given more considera
tion when they ask permission to go wash their hands.
Stanford's lockout system is another example of the
way dear alma mater hangs to our coat-tails. And
the ban on public speeches on controversial subjects
bears a strong resemblance to the old command, "Now
don't you dare play with those nasty little boys in
the alley."
* * * *
All of this is vaguely irritating, and it makes us won
der if we aren't being a little silly when we pity the
poor masses in the totalitarian states. But when we
check back through University history, we find Stan
ford is gradually becoming more liberal. Student gov
ernment has been introduced. The honor system has
been tried, and we no longer have proctors breathing
down our necks during exams. Even the copper
riveted lockout system has relaxed gradually.
Like other universities, Stanford is flirting with
the idea that by the time a man gets to college he
may be able to decide a few things for himself. And
it is slowly discarding the principles that came down to
us from the Victorian era, when a birch rod was rated
far above the slide rule in educational value.

The comments of my brother, the oracle, are a
part of that trend. And so my only hope at the present
is that the rate of progress will speed up. This busi
ness of being part of a trend is hard on typewriters and
cigarettes.
MY MOTHER WON'T LET ME
A. BUNCH of the brothers dropped in the other night
just at bedtime and, finding my cigarettes exposed,
settled down to discuss the state of the nation. The
heaviest of them leaned back in my chair, and kicked
meditatively at the bell on my typewriter.
"The trouble with this University," he said in the
manner of a Greek oracle getting off a particularly good
bit of prophesy, "is that it's too damn paternalistic."
At this point I shoved the cigarettes in my bathrobe
pocket and courteously turned out the lights. The
oracle departed leaving behind him a large scar in the
back of the typewriter, and the question of Stanford's
paternalism.
