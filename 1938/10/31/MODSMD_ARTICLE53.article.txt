# Lightly... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
W/'HEN you're writing a column like this, you never
know whether you are living a day ahead of your
self or a day behind. If you burn yourself with a match
and even if you start writing when your finger is
still on fire, you write, "I burned my finger yester
day." And if tomorrow you know that you are
going to kill a man, you write, "Today I killed a man."
You write it very coolly and simply. You haven't
started worrying yet and you know the cops aren't
looking for you.
But it can be confusing sometimes, and it can get in
your way.
* * * *
Today I want to write: It is a very dark, depress
ing Sunday. The atmosphere is so heavy that you can
write with a cigarette in your mouth and the smoke
won't drift up and get in your eyes. It can't. Some
how you wish it could. This way it makes everything
seem unnatural.
And everything is unnatural. Stanford has a ghost
campus today. No one is here. Some of them went
down south to watch the football team lose a freakish
game, and today they are driving home. It is probably
cloudy and raining ofT and on where they are, too. I
wonder if they are wishing they didn't go down for
the game. Or whatever they went down for.
I don't know where the rest of the people are. If it
had rained on a Monday or a Tuesday or a Thursday,
you would sec them walking around the campus in
trench-coats and slickers, driving in cars, cars that
whip around corners and splash gutter-water on
trench-coats and silk sotckings; you would find them
crowded into the Union, you would find them in the
Libe, you would find them any place you could find
a radio.
But it rained on Sunday. You don't sec them on
the Quad or in the Library or in the Union. You go
into the men's halls, the women's halls, the fraterni
ties, the sororities. You will see very few people.
I don't know where people go when it rains on
Sunday.
* * * *
here at the Shack it's quiet today. Quiet and
clean. The janitor has swept the floors and piled
the chairs neatly on the copy desks. No one has been
in to take them down or throw wadded-up copy paper
on the floor.
John Cobbs is sitting across the room from me,
slashing at a piece of paper with a knife. The night
editor has just come in and is looking at the bare
assignment sheet and the chairs on his desk. He does
n't say anything.
Do you have an idea yet, Johnny?" I ask Cobbs
"Yeah."
A little later I ask him for a cigarette.
"Sure. Take one."
That's all he has said in the last half-hour. It's a
very funny day. No one has come around yet to write
their stories, and the afternoon is half gone. But we
know Johnny and the night editor and I—that the
paper will get out. It always does. Even on rainy
Sundays.

But I cant write that. When people see the paper
it will be Monday. It will be today. If I wrote that
people who read it would say that I was crazy.
They would say it sounded unnatural.

"Yeah."
A little later I ask him for a cigarette.
"Sure. Take one."
That's all he has said in the last half-hour. It's a
very funny day. No one has come around yet to write
their stories, and the afternoon is half gone. But we
know Johnny and the night editor and I—that the
paper will get out. It always does. Even on rainy
Sundays.

But I cant write that. When people see the paper
it will be Monday. It will be today. If I wrote that
people who read it would say that I was crazy.
They would say it sounded unnatural.
W/'HEN you're writing a column like this, you never
know whether you are living a day ahead of your
self or a day behind. If you burn yourself with a match
and even if you start writing when your finger is
still on fire, you write, "I burned my finger yester
day." And if tomorrow you know that you are
going to kill a man, you write, "Today I killed a man."
You write it very coolly and simply. You haven't
started worrying yet and you know the cops aren't
looking for you.
But it can be confusing sometimes, and it can get in
your way.
* * * *
Today I want to write: It is a very dark, depress
ing Sunday. The atmosphere is so heavy that you can
write with a cigarette in your mouth and the smoke
won't drift up and get in your eyes. It can't. Some
how you wish it could. This way it makes everything
seem unnatural.
And everything is unnatural. Stanford has a ghost
campus today. No one is here. Some of them went
down south to watch the football team lose a freakish
game, and today they are driving home. It is probably
cloudy and raining ofT and on where they are, too. I
wonder if they are wishing they didn't go down for
the game. Or whatever they went down for.
I don't know where the rest of the people are. If it
had rained on a Monday or a Tuesday or a Thursday,
you would sec them walking around the campus in
trench-coats and slickers, driving in cars, cars that
whip around corners and splash gutter-water on
trench-coats and silk sotckings; you would find them
crowded into the Union, you would find them in the
Libe, you would find them any place you could find
a radio.
But it rained on Sunday. You don't sec them on
the Quad or in the Library or in the Union. You go
into the men's halls, the women's halls, the fraterni
ties, the sororities. You will see very few people.
I don't know where people go when it rains on
Sunday.
* * * *
here at the Shack it's quiet today. Quiet and
clean. The janitor has swept the floors and piled
the chairs neatly on the copy desks. No one has been
in to take them down or throw wadded-up copy paper
on the floor.
John Cobbs is sitting across the room from me,
slashing at a piece of paper with a knife. The night
editor has just come in and is looking at the bare
assignment sheet and the chairs on his desk. He does
n't say anything.
Do you have an idea yet, Johnny?" I ask Cobbs
"Yeah."
A little later I ask him for a cigarette.
"Sure. Take one."
That's all he has said in the last half-hour. It's a
very funny day. No one has come around yet to write
their stories, and the afternoon is half gone. But we
