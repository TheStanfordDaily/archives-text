### 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 30 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt entered the bit
ter Pennsylvania election campaign
tonight with a denunciation of "mis
use" of his name by Republican
candidates.
In a letter to Representative
Michael Francis Doyle, D., Pa., the
president described as deliberate
misrepresentation of fact, a state
ment by Republican gubernatorial
candidate Judge Arthur H. James
that he refrained from "meddling"
in local issues in the state because
he was "unwilling to put my hands
in muddy waters."

The California Federation of La
bor recently voted by a 2 to 1 majo
rity against endorsing any candi
dates in the forthcoming state and
national elections.
