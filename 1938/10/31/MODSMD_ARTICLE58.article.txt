## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 (UP). â€”
Chairman Martin Dies, D., Tex., of
the House committee investigating
un-American activities, today prom
ised "definite proof" by tomorrow of
his charges top-flight New Dealers
are attempting to sabotage the in
quiry for political reasons.
The Texan said he would reveal
correspondence during a radio ad
dress tomorrow night (Mutual, 11:15
p.m., EST) purporting to show cabi
net officials and other administra
tion kingpins secretly refused to co
operate with the committee as part
of a plot to obstruct its work.
The speech may intensify the bit
terness in the row between President
Roosevelt and the committee. Last
week Mr. Roosevelt twice criticized
the group. He accused it of attempt
ing to bring influence against re
election of his close friend, Gover
nor Frank Murphy, by hearing tes
timony of Republican witnesses that
Murphy had been guilty of "trea
sonable" conduct in handling the
1937 sit-down strikes.
