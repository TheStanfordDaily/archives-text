LOS ANGELES, Oct. ?,0 (UP).â€”
Anna Laura Barnett lost her long
and belligerent fight against eviction
today to government agents who
overpowered her with tear gas in the
white colonnaded mansion she oc
cupied as the wife of the "world's
richest Indian."
The 57 - year - old woman was
lodged in the county jail on suspi
cion of resisting federal officers.
Maxine Sturgis, her daughter by a
previous marriage, was held on a
similar technicality, although she
surrendered quietly when officers
stormed the house.
