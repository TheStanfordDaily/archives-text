# Railway Crises To Be Discussed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 (UP). â€”
President Roosevelt meets with
railway management and labor to
morrow to explore possibilities of
settling the $26,000,000,000 industry's
economic problems without reducing
the wages of its 960,000 workers.
A unanimous report by a presi
dential emergency fact-finding board
that the carriers should not press
their demand for a horizontal 15 per
cent wage cut set the stage for Mr.
Roosevelt's conference with Presi
dent John J. Pel ley of the Asso
ciation of American Railroads, and
Chairman George M. Harrison of
the Railway Labor Executive's Asso
ciation.
Although the chief executive made
no public comment on the board's
report, it was assumed he was in
accord with it. In his recent relief
recovery "fireside chat" he urged
united resistance of capital and la
bor to pay cut proposals.
