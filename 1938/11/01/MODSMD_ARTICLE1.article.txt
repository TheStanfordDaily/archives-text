# French Priest Speaks Tonight In Memorial Hall
## Abbe Ernest Dimnet To Talk at 7:30 On Education in France, America 
### 
Abbe Ernest Dimncl, noted French priest, author, and philosopher,
will speak tonight on "Literature and Education in France and America"
as the lecture of the Tuesday Evening; Series in Memorial Hall auditorium
at 7:30 o'clock.
"American high schools teach too little criticism," declares Abbe Diinnet,
explaining that, as the result of this deficiency, "both writers and readers
are insuflieicntly guided. On the^

other hand, French education is
mostly based on literary criticism,
and does not favor creation."
Praising the educational system
used in the United States today, the
Jesuit priest believes that "the vital,
untrammeled education of Ameri
cans puts no obstacle between cul
ture and creativeness," asserting that
"the golden age of American litera
ture will come when the best col
leges raise the standards of the high
schools."
SAW FRENCH PANIC
Leaving his country home near the
Belgian border but two weeks ago, <
the Abbe was able to witness at ]
first hand the spectacle of the French ]
people's rising panic as they watched
Adolf Hitler's recent militaristic
moves in central Europe, witnessed
the German annexation of Czecho
slovakia's Sudctcnland, and realized
that the danger of war was immi
nent.
The Nazi dictator, whom the
French priest in a recent interview
branded as "a black devil" who has
done much to upset the serenity of
the world, has everything, believes
Abbe Dimnet. "We have nothing left
now but the desire to find truth
without prejudice."
That the fear of "Hitlerism" is far
greater in Europe today than the
fear of Communism is the opinion of
the distinguished prelate, who ex
plains that he has found, in his trav
els on the Continent, that America's
reaction to the aggressiveness of the
Nazi chancellor is both "strong and
definite."
GERMANY MENACE
"This is a hopeful sign," the Abbe
asserts, explaining that another such
sign is "the definite antipathy of the
Italian people to the recent Rome-
Berlin axis."
"The future of both Italy and
Mussolini is menaced by Germany.
If the democracies would use sub
tlety in their flattery of Mussolini—
offering him bribes and placating his
wounded vanity — I believe they
would find him a strong ally for
peace," declares the priest.
Abbe Dimnet, canon of the Ca
thedral of Cambrai, has visited
Stanford twice before, once in 1927
when he presented one lecture, and
again in 1929 when he gave a series
of three.
Author of "The Art of Thinking"
and "My New World," the noted
Jesuit has served as Lowell lecturer

first hand the spectacle of the French ]
people's rising panic as they watched
Adolf Hitler's recent militaristic
moves in central Europe, witnessed
the German annexation of Czecho
slovakia's Sudctcnland, and realized
that the danger of war was immi
nent.
The Nazi dictator, whom the
French priest in a recent interview
branded as "a black devil" who has
done much to upset the serenity of
the world, has everything, believes
Abbe Dimnet. "We have nothing left
now but the desire to find truth
without prejudice."
That the fear of "Hitlerism" is far
greater in Europe today than the
fear of Communism is the opinion of
the distinguished prelate, who ex
plains that he has found, in his trav
els on the Continent, that America's
reaction to the aggressiveness of the
Nazi chancellor is both "strong and
definite."
GERMANY MENACE
"This is a hopeful sign," the Abbe
asserts, explaining that another such
sign is "the definite antipathy of the
Italian people to the recent Rome-
Berlin axis."
"The future of both Italy and
Mussolini is menaced by Germany.
If the democracies would use sub
tlety in their flattery of Mussolini—
offering him bribes and placating his
wounded vanity — I believe they
would find him a strong ally for
peace," declares the priest.
Abbe Dimnet, canon of the Ca
thedral of Cambrai, has visited
Stanford twice before, once in 1927
when he presented one lecture, and
again in 1929 when he gave a series
of three.
Author of "The Art of Thinking"
and "My New World," the noted
Jesuit has served as Lowell lecturer
at Harvard University, and in 1923
was a French lecturer at the Wil
liamstown Institute of Politics.
Abbe Ernest Dimncl, noted French priest, author, and philosopher,
will speak tonight on "Literature and Education in France and America"
as the lecture of the Tuesday Evening; Series in Memorial Hall auditorium
at 7:30 o'clock.
"American high schools teach too little criticism," declares Abbe Diinnet,
explaining that, as the result of this deficiency, "both writers and readers
are insuflieicntly guided. On the^

other hand, French education is
mostly based on literary criticism,
and does not favor creation."
Praising the educational system
used in the United States today, the
Jesuit priest believes that "the vital,
untrammeled education of Ameri
cans puts no obstacle between cul
ture and creativeness," asserting that
"the golden age of American litera
ture will come when the best col
leges raise the standards of the high
schools."
