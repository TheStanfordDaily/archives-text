# Rough Has Gone; Hallowe'en Quiet
## 
### 
The Stanford rough has pass
ed; Hallowe'en was not cele
brated last night in the fashion
to which it is accustomed. How
ever, there was a slight rum
bling as two Stanford women
took the situation in hand and,
with masks and wigs, raided
the Libc.
The two women walked up to
sleepy students, glared at and
scared them, then walked to
other prey. There were a few
shrieks; there were some com
ments. Beyond one rough's
thinking that the masked wom
en looked like the average
Stanford woman does wtihout a
mask, nothing happened.
