# 'Pound Act May Halt Research,' Asserts Hall
## 
### JACK BURTT 
Emphasizing especially the economic difficulties which would be
raised should the State Pound Act pass in the November 8 election, Dr.
Victor E. Hall, associate professor of physiology, recently gave his
treasons for believing that the act would effectively hamper, if not ac
tually halt, medical experimentation on animals in every laboratory of any
type in the state. * —

"I speak from bitter personal ex
perience when I say that to raise a
cat, for instance, in the laboratory to
a minimum age suitable for experi
mentation, about six months, costs
at least 10 times as much as it now
costs to buy a full grown and much
more suitable cat," Dr. Hall as
serted.
BASED ON EXPERIENCE
He based his statement on his ex
perience during three successive at
tempts to raise large numbers of!
cats in the physiology laboratories al
Stanford. He said his experience had
shown that the minimum cost per
animal was 5 cents a day for food
and care. This cost totals approxi
mately $9 at the age of six months.
"It seems more unreasonable, and
even poorer economics, to refuse
stray and unwanted animals to lab
oratories when it is considered that
more than 100,000 dogs were put to
death in the several pounds of the
state last year, and less than 1000
were used for medical research in
the same period of time," Dr. Hall
continued.
WORDING VAGUE
Concerning the Pound Act itself,
Dr. Hall pointed out several places
where he considered the wording of
the measure to be vague or deceiv
ing. "Law suits would be neces
sary to straighten out this act," he
said.
"In the act, it is stated that 'any
accredited college, university or any
medical research laboratory licensed
under the State Medical Practice
Act, provided cats and dogs therein
were bred on the premises or law
fully acquired under provisions of
this measure,' shall be exempted from
the restriction against experimenta
tion," Dr. Hall pointed out.
"The fallacy in this is (1) there is
no provision in the State Medical
Act for licensing research labora
tories, and therefore laboratories
might even be prohibited from using
their own animals, and (2) there are
no provisions made in the entire
measure for obtaining animals in
any way but by breeding them on
the premises.
NO MORE SERUMS
"Commercial laboratories are
definitely not exempted in the pro
visions of the measure, and this will
simply mean that, unless judgment
in a subsequent law suit proves dif
ferently, that there will be no more
scrums, vaccines or anti-toxins
available for use before or during
epidemics except such as can be im
ported from other states. And im
portation in time of need can hardly
be considered as practical as having
the scrums on hand the moment they
arc needed."
Dr. Hall concluded his statement
by urging a "No" vote on the act,
which appears as Initiative Measure
No. 2 nn the ballot.

no provisions made in the entire
measure for obtaining animals in
any way but by breeding them on
the premises.
NO MORE SERUMS
"Commercial laboratories are
definitely not exempted in the pro
visions of the measure, and this will
simply mean that, unless judgment
in a subsequent law suit proves dif
ferently, that there will be no more
scrums, vaccines or anti-toxins
available for use before or during
epidemics except such as can be im
ported from other states. And im
portation in time of need can hardly
be considered as practical as having
the scrums on hand the moment they
arc needed."
Dr. Hall concluded his statement
by urging a "No" vote on the act,
which appears as Initiative Measure
No. 2 nn the ballot.
Emphasizing especially the economic difficulties which would be
raised should the State Pound Act pass in the November 8 election, Dr.
Victor E. Hall, associate professor of physiology, recently gave his
treasons for believing that the act would effectively hamper, if not ac
tually halt, medical experimentation on animals in every laboratory of any
type in the state. * —

"I speak from bitter personal ex
perience when I say that to raise a
cat, for instance, in the laboratory to
a minimum age suitable for experi
mentation, about six months, costs
at least 10 times as much as it now
costs to buy a full grown and much
more suitable cat," Dr. Hall as
serted.
BASED ON EXPERIENCE
He based his statement on his ex
perience during three successive at
tempts to raise large numbers of!
cats in the physiology laboratories al
Stanford. He said his experience had
shown that the minimum cost per
animal was 5 cents a day for food
and care. This cost totals approxi
mately $9 at the age of six months.
"It seems more unreasonable, and
even poorer economics, to refuse
stray and unwanted animals to lab
oratories when it is considered that
more than 100,000 dogs were put to
death in the several pounds of the
state last year, and less than 1000
were used for medical research in
the same period of time," Dr. Hall
continued.
WORDING VAGUE
Concerning the Pound Act itself,
Dr. Hall pointed out several places
where he considered the wording of
the measure to be vague or deceiv
ing. "Law suits would be neces
sary to straighten out this act," he
said.
"In the act, it is stated that 'any
accredited college, university or any
medical research laboratory licensed
under the State Medical Practice
Act, provided cats and dogs therein
were bred on the premises or law
fully acquired under provisions of
this measure,' shall be exempted from
the restriction against experimenta
tion," Dr. Hall pointed out.
"The fallacy in this is (1) there is
no provision in the State Medical
Act for licensing research labora
tories, and therefore laboratories
might even be prohibited from using
their own animals, and (2) there are
no provisions made in the entire
measure for obtaining animals in
any way but by breeding them on
the premises.
