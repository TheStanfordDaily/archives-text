## Stevens Defends 'All's Well' as Play 
### 
Defending the plot of "All's Well
That Ends Well," now being present
ed in the Little Theater, Thomas
Wood Stevens, director of the play,
said yesterday, "Bertram's being a
heel and a rotter has nothing to do
with the validity of the play as a
work of art."
Stevens was referring to local
critics, who objected to Shakespeare's
realistic comedy on the ground that
the hero was a "heel" and the hero
ine was out to get her "man." He
said, "Young men of great wealth
and small experience, who have had
too large an allowance, still behave
in pretty much the same way. The
groom at any shotgun wedding is
not a happy figure and seldom be
haves with any more dignity than
Bertram."
"All's Well That Ends Well" is be
ing presented as a matinee today
|at 4 o'clock. There will be evening
j performances of the production to
| morrow, Thursday, and Friday, at
8 o'clock.
Melba Rae Toombs, Douglas Bry
an, J. P. Cahn, Gordon Williams, and
Dan Holtom have leading roles in
the play. William Bassett is in
charge of the sets and Mrs. Helen

Many of the high schools and col
leges around the peninsula are
planning theater parties to see the
play, announced the secretary of the
Division of Speech and Drama,
among them San Jose State, Menlo
Junior College, Sequoia High
School, Burlingame High School,
