# Sale Starts Today For '38 Gaieties
## Four-Ticket Limit Set by Manager To Prevent Scalping 
### PARK KIMBALL 
The annual rush starts at 9
o'clock this morning with 1500 Gaie
ties tickets for over 4000 students go
ing on sale.
A booth on the English Corner
next, to the steps will be the center
of action as the lucky 1500 shell
out their $1.50, $1, or 50 cents for
the scats at the 1938 Big Game Gaie
ties to be staged the evening of Fri
day, November 18, at 8 o'clock. At
11 o'clock this morning, if there are
tickets left, the booth will be moved
to the Engineering Corner.
Last year at this tune, the air was
filled with howls as-Indian scalpcd
Indian; blocks of 50 tickets went to
individuals accompanied by a cam
pus-wide verbal massacre of the
"damn scalpers." This year, assures
Dramatics Manager Henry Houser,
scalping v/ill be reduced to a mini
mum by not more than four tickets
to a person.
SCALERS TO GET AXE
Men's Council backs up Houser by
its decision to "give scalpers the
axe"—in their own scalps. A noble
start was made last year when this
body gave "a certain student" 75
hours of work, loss of tickets, and
loss of receipts.
Undoubtedly the major dramatic
event of the year in popularity, the
Gaieties invariably draws an over
capacity crowd. Last year there
were some who thought the Gaieties
diverged from its theme—forgot foot
ball. The 1938 Big Game Gaieties is
guaranteed by its makers to be a
BIG GAME Gaieties produced in
the best BIG GAME GAIETIES
style. This, explains Director J. P.
Cahn, is because it IS A BIG GAME
GAIETIES.
SPRING SHOW BAND
Myron Birnbaum, Stager music
mind, also has something to say.
"Remember the wonderful Spring
Show band? Well, we've got it
back for the Gaieties. In fact, we
have another 'biggest band ever to
appear in a campus production' ow
ing to another saxophone which has
been added for the occasion. And
with our eleven new tunes — boy,
what an opportunity to swing out!"
As fine as this is for the Gaieties,
it means a lot of work for Birnbaum.
To be explicit, he figures that he
must spend a total of 250 hours on
arrangements. He needs help. Will
anyone who can copy music please
contact him at the dramatics office?
TEN SKITS
This year there will be ten skits,
ranging from the ridiculous to the
sublime. Some will be funny, some
beautifully staged with claborateET
will be terrific, others will be beau
tifully staged with elaborate detail—
and still others, of all things, will
be based on "campus opinion."
There will be many new faces—lots
of new talent and variety; and then
there will be many of Stanford's
"hardy perrenials" who will blos
som forth to please Stanford audi
ences all over again.
Skit and song rehearsals and
dance routines are well under way
and future rehearsal schedules will
be posted on the English Corner.
Students wishing to present checks
tomorrow at the booth should make
them out for the exact amount and
, to the Dramatics Council of Stan
ford University.
