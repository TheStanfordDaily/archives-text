### 
One hundred illegal holders of Farm A.S.S.U. tickets walked away
from the validating booths at the U.C.L.A. game Saturday with looks or
embarrassment on their faces. Another estimated (550 illegal ticket-holders
escaped similar disappointment.
Local Board of Athletic Control officials seized the pasteboards from

â– the non-owners and refused them
entrance to the Coliseum after they
failed to pass the validating test, Al
Masters, B.A.C. general manager,
told The Daily today.
RESELLING A PROBLEM
"Whether the cards will be resold
to the rightful owners Ls now a prob
lem before the Men's Council,"
Masters said in turning the matter
over to the student group for final
decision.
Validating began on the Stanford
Special on its way south Friday
night ,when 225 tickets were okayed

No action was taken in Men's
Council meeting last night on the
student body tickets confiscated at
the U.C.L.A. game, but Men's
Council will confer with A1 Mas
ters during the week and give
some decision on the matter in
next Monday's meeting, it was
announced last night.

although but 18G had train reser
vations.
During the first three hours the
windows were open at Los Angeles,
one-half the tickets presented for
validation were confiscated.
OFFICIALS MANHANDLED
Once their guilt was discovered,
women turned to tears and men to
man-handling the officials, Jake Ir
win, manager of the operations for
the 8.A.C., disclosed.
In validating tickets, questions
pertaining to campus life were ask
ed and personal identification was
requested before rooters would be
admitted to the Coliseum.
Many students prominent in cam
pus life were among those who
loaned their cards for the game, it
was learned from Irwin. Dean of
Men Bunn and other university ex
ecutives were unjustly blamed for
the "mistreatment" by numerous of
the irate victims of the investiga
tion, he added.
"Considering that they paid for
their cards, students often ask why
they can't lend them to anyone they
want to," the B.A.C. officer related.
"We restrict such practice princi
pally because if strangers unfamiliar
with the routine of the Rally Com
mittee and who don't know the uni
versity songs, yells, and stunts
would naturally be out of place in
the rooters' section."
