# Cottrell Predicts Slim G.O.P. Victory
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
Eight hundred and fifty thousand i
'"wobblers" will decide California's !
future when the state goes to th- j j
polls a week from today.
There are that many more regis- ]
tered Democrats than Republicans,
and it is their votes which will swing
the election, according to Professoi
Edwin A. Cottreli, executive head ol
the School of Soc>al Sciences and
head of the Political Science Depart
ment.
Indicating his belief that Rtpub
lican balloting will be strictly with
in party lines, Professor Cottreli
stated that such issues as tho Tbiity
Thursday and the charges of Com
munist activity recently leveled av
Senator Culbert L. Olson, guberna
torial nominee, and Sheridan Down
ey, Democratic Senate contender,
before the Dies Committee, might do
a good deal to convert what looks
l.ke a Democrat landslide into a j
.slim but decisive Republican victoiy.
DEMOCRATS IN MAJORITY
"Four years ago," he said, "there
were 500,000 more Democrats than
Republicans; and Merriam won. To
day there are 850,000 more, and with
the political situation closely par
allel, he may win again."
Characterizing Raymond L. Haight
as "a very fine middle-of-the-road
er, slightly left of center," Pro
fessor Cottreli predicted that his
withdrawal from acti"e competition
for the governorship would throw
his votes to Merriam.
"He's left but not quite far
enough left for his supporters to
turn to Olson."
OLSEN FACES BATTLE
Olson himself will face a hard bat
tle under two handicaps, according
to Professor Cottreli. The first is
EPIC, the ticket-to-Paradise on
which Upton Sinclair almost rode
into Sacramento four years ago. The
other is the famed "Ham and Eggs,"
the Thirty Dollars Every Thursday
which is California's latest defiance
of the laws of logic. Hampered by
these and the Dies Committee
charges, he will face strong compe
tition from incumbent Governor
Merriam, who again carries the
torch of California conservatism in
its unending battle with the Forces
of Subversion.
In the Senatorial race. Professor
Cottreli is of the opinion that Re
publican Philip Bancroft, if he wins
at all, will win by a much larger
percentage than will be evidenced in
the Republican vote for the gov
ernorship.
"Sheridan Downey is too closely
tied up with the Thirty Thursday for
his own good. If it goes down to de
feat it will undoubtedly carry him
with it; and there seems to be a
very good chance that it will, due
to the ridicule heaped upon it, plus
the President's condemnation, which
will have some influence."
Commenting on the justification
for Downey's stand on the plan,
Professor Cottreli pointed out that

in 27 states of the Union some form
of old age pension plan is being
either used or proposed.
''Downey feels that if he can get j
into office on California's scheme, he I
will be able to do something on a :
nation-wide scale, using the pressure j
of national public opinion to push I
legislation through the Congress."
In short, there would seem to be j
only one basic issue for California |
to vote on next week: Thirty Dollars |
Every Thursday. It may send Olson j
to Sacramento or retire him to '
private life; it may place Downey in j
the Senate or strip him of political |
power.
Whichever way the election goes, j
it will be the chief, if not the only, j
deciding factor.
