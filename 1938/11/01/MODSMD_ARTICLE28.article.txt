# Kennedy Talks On Psychology
## Radio Discussion Covers Experiments 
### 
John L. Kennedy, fellow in
psychic research at Stanford Uni
versity, spoke on "Experimental
Psychology in Psychical Research"
in a radio talk yesterday evening
over station KGO.
He attempted to clarify some of
the major points at issue in the con
troversy over the evidence in sup
port of "psychic phenomena" which
has been called to popular atten
tion by the daily press, books, mag
azines, and radio.
"In terms of the history of mod
ern experimental psychology, dis
agreement between psychologists
and those who have presented evi
dence of "psychic" occurrences is
relatively ancient," said Kennedy.
Pie illustrated his point by calling
attention to two events. The first of
these was the founding of the first
laboratory for experimental psy
chology in Leipzig by Wilhelm
Wundt in 1870. He held that the
study of the human "mind" should
be experimental.
The second event was the found
ing of the first Society for Psychical
Research in London in 1882. This so
ciety began active work 011 prob
lems relating to telepathy, clairvoy
ance, hypnotism, hauntings, and
premonitions, as well as the fb
called "physical" phenomena of spir
itualism.
"The conclusions having to do
with telepathy are not accepted as
sufficiently and scientifically dem
onstrated fact by more than 10 per
cent of experimental psychologists
today," continued Kennedy. "I think
that it is possible to formulate a
scientific point of view toward phe
! nomena called "psychic," ".supernor-
Imal," or "spiritualistic." They must
be generally observable and the con
ditions for their occurrence must be
known."
