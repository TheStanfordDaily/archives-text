The second and revised edition of j
"A Critical Bibliography of German !
Literature in Translation to 1935" by '
Dr. B. Q. Morgan, executive head ol
the Stanford German department, |
will be published by the University j
Press the latter part of November J
according to an announcement yes- i
terday by Stanley M. Croonquist, |
sales manager.
The purpose of the book, to quote
Dr. Morgan, is to "present a com- j
plete picture of German literature as 1
reflected in the English language.
Such a compilation should have
great value both for the student of
literature and for the student of in
ternational relations, while the crit
ical notes and the evaluation of the
translations are of inestimable im
portance to librarians, editors, pub
lishers, and scholars."
The second edition increases the
main list of title translations of the
first edition, published while Dr.
Morgan was a professor at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, by more than
4.000 titles. This increase in titles is
partly due to extensive research in
Ihe Library of Congress and in the
British Museum.
A supplementary list of transla
tions published from 19U8 to 1935
inclusive, adds about 2000 addi
tional titles. Included in the con
tents of this 800-page book is a list
of anonyma, nearly 600 in number,
many of which have been traced to
their authors. Included are such
early German works as "Eulenspie
gel" and "Faust."
