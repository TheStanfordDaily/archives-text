With two league championships
already sewed up, the Farm's Intra
mural touch-football schedule gets
down to the serious business of de
ciding the remaining seven league
champions this week.
The Breakers Club, undefeated in
four loop matches, has annexed the
League V title, and Kappa Alpha
coasted in last week with the
League 111 crown.
Delta Chi, 1937 defending cham
pions, and Phi Delta Phi, runner
ups from last year, were only one
game away from getting into the
league play-offs, scheduled for

sometime next week. Phi Delta Phi
whipped Eneina 4W, 12-0, yester
day afternoon and tackle the once
defeated but contending, Phi Gamma

Deltas Thursday afternoon at 5
o'clock.
Delta Chis and the Japanese Club,
with perfect records to date, square
off this afternoon at 4 o'clock on
Field II to decide the League IV
race. Sigma Chis can take League
IX with a victory over Sigma Nu
and Phi Kappa Psi I needs a win
over El Campo to top League I
Thursday. With three straight vic
tories, Delta Upsilon meets a tough
League XII opponent Wednesday in
the Independent I squad.
Theta Chi and Sequoia I will be
forced to replay lor the League II
championship as both cluba are tied
with three wins and one defeat. Beta
Theta Pi II and Kappa Sigma are
chief contenders for first in League
VIII.
Phi Kappa Psi I's tripped their
most dangerous rival, Oriole A.C ,
20-0, yesterday afternoon with a
flashy passing and running attack.
Stahl took a pass for the initial
score, Grubbs tore off tackle for the
second, and Grubbs tossed to Brooke
for the third touchdown.
Phi Delta Theta remained in con
tention for League I's title by trim
ming Chi Psi I in a high-scoring
game, 25-12. Paine caught a blocked
pass for the opening pay-off and
Madlem shot a pass to Wallace for
the second touchdown before the
Chi Psi's scored. Seamons threw to
O'Brien for another Phi Delt touch
down. Ward intercepted a pass for
Chi Psi's first marker.
Phi Gamma Delta, who meet Phi
Delta Phi Thursday, turned in its
fourth victory of the campaign over
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 19-0. Bayer's
passes to Fyfe and Johnson pro
duced two touchdowns and John
son fired one to Bayer for the third
score.
Sigma Chi all but won its league
in whipping El Campo, 21-0. Hart
man ta'lied twice and Neeley ripped
