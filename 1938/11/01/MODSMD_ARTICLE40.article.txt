# Indian Gridders Show Optimism
## Team Proves Rumor of Dissension False 
### 
If the Stanford football team is
cut up with dissension like the city
papers have intimated, the team
members certainly didn't show any
trace of it last night.
The squad was really working
with a vengeance long after six
o'clock, and encouraging slaps on
the back were as numerous as those
at a Democratic rally. The only dis
sension behind those locked gates
seems to be toward the critics who
always relish stirring up any kind of
a squabble.
PLAYERS UNCONCERNED
No one has denied that Stanford
football is at a low ebb and that
something will pop before long, but
the players seem willing to take each
game in stride without too much
concern over adverse criticism.
Bill Paulman added another spark
of optimism as he ran at quarter
back on the first string, apparently
none the worse for his two weeks'
layoff. Jackie Brenner finally had
his talents recognized and was also
on the top team. Brenner took over
the right half assignment with Hugh
Gallarneau on the second outfit.
COLDIRON SHIFTED
Freddie Ledeboer, newest pos
sessor of a Hatlo Hat, remained at
left half with Norm Standlee still at
lull. Gene Coldiron, who has played
almost sixty minutes of ball since
Paulman's injury, goes to the second
string quarter job along with Gal
larneau, Rod Parker, and Thor Pe
terson.
That shoulder injury which
"Cookie" South picked up in the
U.C.L.A. tussle still hasn't been com
pletely diagnosed. The B.A.C. medi
cos haven't found any trace of a
break in two sets of X-ray shots.
South possibly might have ruptured
a blood vessel or something less se
rious in the shoulder region. How
ever, the redheaded sophomore sen
sation still looks to be out for the
season, with only four games re
maining. South, playing his first
varsity game at right half, tackled
Kenny Washington early in the
second quarter and came out of the
resultant pileup with the undeter
mined injury.
