# Shipkey Fears Cal Frosh Strength
## 
### 
The small margin of a single j
touchdown is all that prevents the
1938 "Little Big Game" from being
a clasic thriller between two unde
feated teams.
It was by that tally that Coach!
A1 Dowden's California Bearcub j
gridders lost to the U.S.C. frosh, the |
only defeat that they have suffered
in five games. Stanford's Papooses ;
have gone through four games with- !
out a single scratch on their record, j
Despite the fact that the Card j
yearlings' season record is much bet
ter than that of the Bearcubs, as
based on comparative scores, never
theless Coach Harry Shipkey has a
wholesome respect for the Berkeley
boys.
On top of that, it is the Little Big
Game, which is as tough to dope out
as the varsity classic. Last year the'
Shipkeymen upset the dope and
trounced Cal, 13-0. This year it could
easily be the Bears who spring the

upset.
Jack McQuary, a big, fast-moving
triple-threat left halfback, is Cal's
threat to the Papooses. McQuary
hits like a steam roller, and is fast
and shifty in an open field, to boot.
Behind him in the ball-carrying spot
is Ray Arnold, a speed-burner on
end runs.
Cal's hope to break up Stanford's
touted passing attack is a pair of
crafty ends, who hit hard and charge
fast. They are Carl Leipzig, all-
Southern California high school
flankman, and Ray Amling. Cal fig
ures that if the Bear frosh can stop
Frankie Albert's deadly passing,
they have a good chance tot rip up
the Papooses, who haven't too much
running power.
