# Water Poloists Build Offense
## Frosh Squad Drills For San Jose Match 
### 
Coach Thornton gave vent to some
very definite ideas concerning his
frosh water polo men yesterday as
he slashed his fast developing squad
through a rigorous practice in
preparation for the two pitched bat
tles that are to follow this week, one
practice game with the Sequoia j
squad tomorrow and a still stiffer
game with the San Jose State frosh
pool men on Thursday. And those
ideas for the most part were on the
optimistic side.
"The game with San Jose this
Thursday," he said, "promises to be
one of our toughest battles this year.
San Jose, to date, has been unde
feated, and have behind them the
backing of .two victories over the
Cal frosh team. But, since our frosh
also have an undefeated season, 1
have no fear that we will not show
up strongly against the State pool
'men."
Under the leadership of Scott
Dudley, who was elected captain of
the frosh squad last Friday and who
is the first-string sprint man, the
fxosh have been developing in of
fensive power with every practice.
The strong Card offense is built
around three very powerful of
fensive players, with Fred Manwar
ing and Hadley Bacon at the for
wards, and Captain Scott Dudley at
the sprint position. Duncan Patty at
center also adds an offensive threat
by his brilliant play.
The past few days have seen
three boys, Jim Abrahamson, John
Pollack, and John Holton, battling
out for the two guard positions. All
of these three will undoubtedly see
action in the coming two games.
By spectacular work during the
last few practices, Ed Smith will get
the call at goal, but he will find
himself closely pressed by the other
two goalies, Bill Ernst and Bill
Mo ran.
