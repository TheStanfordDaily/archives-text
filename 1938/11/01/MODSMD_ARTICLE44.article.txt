# Men from Mars
## 
### 
THE most amazing example in recent times
of mass hysteria occurred Sunday night
when casual radio listeners, tuning in on the
Mercury Theater dramatization of H. G. Wells'
"War of the Worlds," took fiction for fact, be
lieved that the men of Mars were destroying
the world.
It is easy for anyone listening to the program
to understand how the mistake might have been
made; the first portion, at least, was remarkably
realistic. By missing the initial program plug,
one might for a few moments at least believe
that the catastrophe was actually taking place.
The illusion is interesting enough purely
from an artistic point of view. But what was
even more fantastic was the reaction to it
throughout the United States. Panic gripped
large portions of the East, where the supposed
Martian raid was taking place; frantic crowds
swarmed into the streets, phoned excitedly to
newspaper and radio offices for confirmation,
even a group of university students fainted from
sheer terror.
Mob psychology rampant spread like wild
fire. From what? A radio broadcast of a sci
entific romance by a twentieth-century novelist.
Pure fancy.
While in the spirit of the occasion, one stops
to note exactly how ineffectual the world would
be in case of such an emergency, just how com
pletely helpless it would be to martial its forces
against a common enemy. H. G. Wells knew
his mob psychology well when he wrote "War
of the Worlds"; actually, people reacted exactly
as he said they would.
But the whole uproar is even more weird
when put beside the United States' normal
reaction to pure fact, the view it takes of a world
which fantastically lets machines conquer it to
the point where thousands die under automo
bile wheels each year, a world which puts mil
lions on relief rolls while warehouse grains rot,
which believes that a man in a colored shirt
can dictate life and death terms to nations.
With a shrug of the shoulders and a bovinely
contemplative gaze these nightmarish fancies
pass unnoticed, accepted without a tremor.
But Sunday night the United States went fear
crazy over a bed-time story.
