A week from today what Time calls "the
great and screwy state of California" will
go to the polls in an election which should
decide for all time whether or not that epithet
is justified.
According to Professor Cottrell of the Poli
Sci Department, the balloting will depend pretty
largely on one thing: on how loud the Thirty
Thursday sirens sing their wild-eyed song, and
how willingly California voters listen.
Philip Bancroft would be an ordinary Repub
lican, a little more obnoxious than most, if it
weren't for the Thirty Thursday. Sheridan
Downey would be a minor social prophet un
worried by the need for making sense. Frank
Merriam would be exactly what he is, a dod
dering Ohio dodo; and Culbert Olson, gray hair
and all, would be only a run-of-the-mill Demo
crat with an eye on the main chance.

But the Thirty Thursday has changed all that,
transformed them overnight into four little Cin
derellas hell-bent for the election ball. Ban
croft—the frank, the honest—is now the fair
haired boy who will keep California's Senate
seat away from the Reds. Downey is the stand
ard-bearer for the Aged in their Battle for Jus
tice. Merriam is again the G.O.P.'s Sir Galahad,
and Culbert Olson, a man whose friends are
almost too much for him, fights Privilege with
every breath as he tries desperately to avoid
committing himself to anything.
What the Thirty Thursday has done, in short,
is cut straight through the center of an other
wise ordinary election. An impartial Nemesis,
it is driving the Republicans so far right that
they are losing their liberal votes, the Demo
crats so far left that they are losing their con
servative votes.
As the campaign goes on, it is becoming
more and more a mockery of the democratic
process and the great and screwy state which
gave it birth.—A. S. D.
