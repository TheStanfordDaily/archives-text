### JOHN COBBS 
ROAD TO ROAM
t'OR the past month or so, the gay caballeros who
cruise around the campus in their own cars have
been grumbling about the chains that close Lasuen
Street where it borders the Quad. In their opinion,
the battered yellow barriers are a direct interference
with life, liberty, and pursuit of eight o'clocks, and very
probably are contrary to the due process of law clause
of the Constitution.
Personally, I have only a detached interest in the
ultimate fate of Lasuen. I am one of Stanford's dis
mounted cavaliers, and so the chains mean no more to
me than another man's housebill. But as far as I can
see, there is no reason why the street should be closed.
And if we can believe the vitriolic comments of cam
pus motorists there are a number of reasons why it
should be kept open.
* * # *
When the University announced last month that
Lasuen would be retired from the active list, it ex
plained with patient condescension that the new Edu
cation Building increased pedestrian traffic. The idea
seemed to be that students would be clustered so
thickly that any attempt to pass with an automobile
would amount to attempted murder.
The only flaw in this reasoning is that there have
been no more pedestrians than in past years. It is true,
of course, that a few students always wander down the
middle of the street putting their faith in God and
the law of damages. But observation will show these
are agile men, any one of whom can reach the curb in
a single jump from a standing start. Natural selec
tion has seen to it that men who walk in the middle
of the street develop into excellent jumpers.
* * * *
B UT regardless of pedestrians the yellow chains
stretch across the street and automatically route
cars over the arroyos around Encina, which the map
calls roads.
Drivers complain bitterly that it wastes time and
gasoline, that it causes congestion. They point out that
it menaces the lives of Encina frosh ,who are younger
than the average student, and less experienced in
dodging.
Girls living along the Row prove by statistics that
an extra three blocks may turn a perfectly safe dash
for home into a lockout. Campus hitch-hikers find
traffic flowing through new arteries, ignoring the old
stands. The Palm Drive pick-up tradition fades in the
face of conditions which leave the English Corner
terminal deserted.
* * *
The future of the University, of course, doesn't
hang on the solution of the situation. There is no occa
sion for mob demonstrations or a march on the Ad
Building.
But in a world that is already bothered with dicta
tors, imperialism, colds in the head, and badly laun
dered shirts the chains seem to be a useless nuisance.
And Stanford is already well stocked with those.

ROAD TO ROAM
t'OR the past month or so, the gay caballeros who
cruise around the campus in their own cars have
been grumbling about the chains that close Lasuen
Street where it borders the Quad. In their opinion,
the battered yellow barriers are a direct interference
with life, liberty, and pursuit of eight o'clocks, and very
probably are contrary to the due process of law clause
of the Constitution.
Personally, I have only a detached interest in the
ultimate fate of Lasuen. I am one of Stanford's dis
mounted cavaliers, and so the chains mean no more to
me than another man's housebill. But as far as I can
see, there is no reason why the street should be closed.
And if we can believe the vitriolic comments of cam
pus motorists there are a number of reasons why it
should be kept open.
* * # *
When the University announced last month that
Lasuen would be retired from the active list, it ex
plained with patient condescension that the new Edu
cation Building increased pedestrian traffic. The idea
seemed to be that students would be clustered so
thickly that any attempt to pass with an automobile
would amount to attempted murder.
The only flaw in this reasoning is that there have
been no more pedestrians than in past years. It is true,
of course, that a few students always wander down the
middle of the street putting their faith in God and
the law of damages. But observation will show these
are agile men, any one of whom can reach the curb in
a single jump from a standing start. Natural selec
tion has seen to it that men who walk in the middle
of the street develop into excellent jumpers.
* * * *
B UT regardless of pedestrians the yellow chains
stretch across the street and automatically route
cars over the arroyos around Encina, which the map
calls roads.
Drivers complain bitterly that it wastes time and
gasoline, that it causes congestion. They point out that
it menaces the lives of Encina frosh ,who are younger
than the average student, and less experienced in
dodging.
Girls living along the Row prove by statistics that
an extra three blocks may turn a perfectly safe dash
for home into a lockout. Campus hitch-hikers find
traffic flowing through new arteries, ignoring the old
stands. The Palm Drive pick-up tradition fades in the
face of conditions which leave the English Corner
terminal deserted.
* * *
The future of the University, of course, doesn't
hang on the solution of the situation. There is no occa
sion for mob demonstrations or a march on the Ad
Building.
But in a world that is already bothered with dicta
tors, imperialism, colds in the head, and badly laun
dered shirts the chains seem to be a useless nuisance.
And Stanford is already well stocked with those.
