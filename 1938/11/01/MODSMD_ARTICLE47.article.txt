'T'HE boys and girls who went south had a little
trouble with that line outside the Coliseum where
they carefully checked student body cards, I hear.
It must have been something like getting in, or out,
of France during the French Revolution—only Satur
day the boys and girls didn't have to prove that their
finger-nails were dirty. They had to prove practically
everything else, though.
One guy came up before the inquisition board and
boldly handed over a student body card and his
ticket. The citizen examining the cards picked it up,
read the name on it, and then carefully studied the
guy.
"You ain't this guy," he said positively, indicating
the name on the student body card. "He's a frosh
football player, a big guy with red hair."
"But I got red hair, too," pleaded the little guy with
red hair trying to get into the game.
But it was obvious to the citizen that a little guy
ain't a big guy. Even with red hair.

You could have made a fortune down there boot
legging bawlouts,
Guys who had got. tickets for little southern gals
wasted no lime in telling them the name of the house
mother of their alleged house. Grade averages were
looked up. Majors were looked up. Residences were
looked up. And very often it helped.
But bawlouts were very scarce.
And one girl faced one of these inquisitive citizens.
"Where do you live at Stanford?" he asked
shrewdly.
"At the Beta house," she answered very firmly.

O u s Managing Editor went down for the game, and
after the mess he was in the dressing room inter
viewing players and such. A little guy about 10 years
old came up to him.
"Can I have your autograph, sir?" .
"Naw, you don't want my autograph. I'm not a
football player."
"Oh, thats all right," the kid said. "I just want it
for a Thirty-on-Thursday petition anyway."

A lot of people, I hear, got off the train briefly at
Salinas for one thing and another, but all they could
get was apples.
They all stuffed themselves with apples all the way
down. Disgusting.

O u s Managing Editor went down for the game, and
after the mess he was in the dressing room inter
