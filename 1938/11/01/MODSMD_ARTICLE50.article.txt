# CAMPUS OPINION
## ABOLISH RAH-RAH 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We, the undersigned, are writing
this letter to express our apprecia
tion of the sentiments expressed by
Harry Gentry in this morning's
Daily.
We firmly believe that the best
interests of sportsmanship and the
best interests of intercollegiate foot
ball would be served if, in the fu
ture, the following things were done:
1. Abolish all yell-leaders; "Let
joy be unconfined" and spontaneous.
2. Abolish all card stunts: they are
childish in conception and an insult
to the dignity of the student spec
tators at the game.
3. Abolish admissions to football
games, especially in the case of stu -
dents; it is the height of idiocy to
require students to pay to see a
game at which they are required to
perform, i.e. â€” yell, do silly card
stunts, and provide a general col
legiate atmosphere to attract cash
customers.
4. Abolish the presence of the
"band" at football games; it serves
only to drown the public address
system, which might be a good
thing, if it were not that in so
doing it adds to the general confu
sion which appears to be such a
necessary part of every game.
5. Abolish all rooter's caps, pom
pons, etc.
6. ABOLISH RALLY COMMIT
TEE!
Yours in the interests of good
sense and dignity,
Alfred G. McMicking
Richard H. Jennings
W. M. Shepard
Joseph Genser
R. L. Edmunds
