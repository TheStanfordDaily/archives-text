# SOPHS CRITICIZED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The sophs "go slumming" next
Friday. With growing disappoint
ment I have been waiting for com
ments on this fact, since the time
they announced it. However, no re
action whatsoever from the Ameri
cans—they seem to think it quite
natural—so it's up to a foreigner
now to say that he thinks the "slum
ming" theme the worst idea they
could possibly have chosen for the
Soph Cotillion.
Maybe it's because I'm not Stan
fordized yet, but I consider it a
shame to make fun of the misery of
other people. Imagine a hunch of
well-to-do kids, most of whom prob
ably never have been near the real

slums, imitating the "romantic" life
of the underprivileged who live in
those places; it's an insult to those
poor peop l and as a human being I
feel personally insulted! Even the
importing of a film celebrity from
Hollywood doesn't make the thing
decent and ct P'ocratic.
Why don't the sophs give a party
for the bei.elk of those organizations
that are workr.g to get rid of the
slums—WPA for example? 1 don't
suppose that any of the originators
of this idea ever saw the play, "One-
Tnird of a Nation"; if the\ had they
certainly wouldn't have caused a
foreigner, v:hc likes America and
Stanford i"n.r»ensely, to write some
thing like this. I would feel very
sorry if anybody feels hurt by my
remarks; after all I'm very grateful
<o be a guest in America, «nd I want
to act accordingly.
However, T. simply had to express
myself on this "slumming" idea,
because I think it's wrong. I'm al
most sux-e everybody who is socially
conscious will agree with me. If not,
please tell me where I am wrong.
I don't master my English enough
to say things as clearly as I wanted
to—but I hope you get my point,
re/ertheless.
