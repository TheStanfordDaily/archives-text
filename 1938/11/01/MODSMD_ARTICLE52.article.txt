# CARD SEIZURE UNFAIR
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I believe there are a lot of stu
dents who will feel a little less mo
rose if this article is printed for
everyone to see.
The subject concerns the alleged
confiscation of some GOO student body
cards in Los Angeles last Saturday
because they were used by persons
other than the owners to see the
Stanford-U.C.L.A. game.
I am one of the unfortunates who
loaned his card to a student friend
without asking questions, as I
couldn't go to the game personally.
I am not whining—l'll take the
penalty, for I knew what might hap
pen—and did. Losing my student
body card cripples my chances of
seeing any more games this quarter
—but I can stand that. But the
fellow who lost my card is very
miserable because of the matter and
would compensate me for the value
of the card at the remaining games.
I'm no good Samaritan by a long
shot but I couldn't ask a brother
hasher to buy me expensive general
admission tickets to the Washington,
California, and Dartmouth games.
Besides, ' I already have rooter's

tickets for the last two games.
Why shouldn't the stern admin
istration of the B.A.C. break down
and resell these student body cards
to their proper owners at the gen
eral admisison price of the Stanford- ,
U.C LA. game? I'm sure Messrs. i
Irwin and Masters would be just as
satisfied as we deprived, who have
1 ramed a great lesson.
J.L.
