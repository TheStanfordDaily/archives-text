# Hitler Gives Peace Plan To France
## Ten to Twenty-five Year 'No War' Pact May Satisfy Powers 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 31 (UP).—Chancellor
Adolf Hitler of Germany has offered
France a "gentlemen's agreement" to
refrain from war for either 10 or 25
years, Foreign Minister Georges
Bonnet informed Premier Edouard
Daladier tonight.
Hitler's offer of peace was brought
to Paris by Andre Fran<;ois-Poncet,
new French ambassador to Rome,
who confered with Der Fuehrer be
fore leaving Berlin, whei'e he served
as ambassador for seven years.
FRANCE DESIRES PACT
Francjois-Poncet's report resulted
immediately in a series of important
diplomatic consultations, revealing
France's desire to obtain the "no
war" pact with Germany and pro
vide a foundation for a general four
power scheme of European appease
ment.
The four-power program would
bring the so-called democratic en
tente into closely knit collaboration
with Germany and Italy.
In his diplomatic talks during the
day, Bonnet prepared the ground for
an anticipated early settlement of
various Franco-German and Franco-
Italian differences and it was antici
pated in government quarters the
next 30 days would bring:
FIVE ACTIONS PROBABLE
1. Germany's renunciation of any
territorial claims in Europe against
France—a pledge already publicly
stated by Hitler—as the basis for the
gentlemen's "no war" agreement.
2. Re - establishment of normal
French diplomatic relations with
Italy, leading to a general under
standing with Premier Benito Mus
solini.
3. Enforcement by mid-November
of the April J6 Anglo-Italian pact of
friendship, thereby bolstering the
framework of the four-power align
ment.
4. Grant of belligerent rights to
the Spanish Insurgents and Loyal
ists by the London Non-interven
tion Committee, on the basis of Mus
solini's withdrawal of 10,000 troops
from Spain.
5. A settlement of the Czechoslo
vak-Hungarian territorial dispute by
Italo-German arbitration, beginning
when German Foreign Minister Joa
chim von Ribbentrop and Italian
Foreign Minister Count Galcazzo
Ciano meet Wednesday at Vienna.
These five points, once settled, arc
believed by Daladier and Bonnet to
be sufficient to permit general Eu
ropean pacification, including a
measure of satisfaction for Hitler's
colonial demands.

PARIS, Oct. 31 (UP).—Chancellor
Adolf Hitler of Germany has offered
France a "gentlemen's agreement" to
refrain from war for either 10 or 25
years, Foreign Minister Georges
Bonnet informed Premier Edouard
Daladier tonight.
Hitler's offer of peace was brought
to Paris by Andre Fran<;ois-Poncet,
new French ambassador to Rome,
who confered with Der Fuehrer be
fore leaving Berlin, whei'e he served
as ambassador for seven years.
FRANCE DESIRES PACT
Francjois-Poncet's report resulted
immediately in a series of important
diplomatic consultations, revealing
France's desire to obtain the "no
war" pact with Germany and pro
vide a foundation for a general four
power scheme of European appease
ment.
The four-power program would
bring the so-called democratic en
tente into closely knit collaboration
with Germany and Italy.
In his diplomatic talks during the
day, Bonnet prepared the ground for
an anticipated early settlement of
various Franco-German and Franco-
Italian differences and it was antici
pated in government quarters the
next 30 days would bring:
FIVE ACTIONS PROBABLE
1. Germany's renunciation of any
territorial claims in Europe against
France—a pledge already publicly
stated by Hitler—as the basis for the
gentlemen's "no war" agreement.
2. Re - establishment of normal
French diplomatic relations with
Italy, leading to a general under
standing with Premier Benito Mus
solini.
3. Enforcement by mid-November
of the April J6 Anglo-Italian pact of
friendship, thereby bolstering the
framework of the four-power align
ment.
4. Grant of belligerent rights to
the Spanish Insurgents and Loyal
ists by the London Non-interven
tion Committee, on the basis of Mus
solini's withdrawal of 10,000 troops
from Spain.
5. A settlement of the Czechoslo
vak-Hungarian territorial dispute by
Italo-German arbitration, beginning
