# Farm Plans Straw-Vote
## Grail Poll Downs New Deal 
### 
•Following the tradition of
ford conservatism, Farm alumni
overwhelmingly voted down the
New Deal in a recent poll conducted
by the Stanford Illustrated Review.
Out of 4424 votes cast, only 1007
alumni were in favor of the New
Deal, while 3417 were against it. A
larger percentage of women were
against the Roosevelt tactics, 23 per
cent of the men voting "Yes," while
only 13.5 per cent of the women
voted "Yes."
Contrary to popular belief the
older graduates arc not the most
conservative and the recent grads
are not the most liberal. Only 12 per
cent of the Class of '38 were for the
New Deal, while 26 per cent of the
classes from 1892 to 1900 were in
favor of the New Deal.
The classes of 1921 to 1930 proved
to be most strongly in favor of the
present administration 35 per cent
voting for it. Next to the Class of
'38, the classes of 1901 to 1910 were
strongest against Roosevelt.

Stanford .students will vote to
morrow on the coming state election
issues in a straw vote sponsored by
Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary political
science fraternity. On the ballot
will be governor, lieutenant-gover
nor, U. S. senator, U. S. represen
tative, state senatoi', and state repre
sentative offices, and Picketing (No.
1), Anti-vivisection (No. 2), Single
Tax (No. 20), and Thirty Dollars
Every Thursday (No. 25) issues.
Ballots will be printed in The Daily

ceived on the Law Steps between 9

noon.
Results of previous campus straw
votes show a marked decrease in the
Republican majority of the student
body, according to Edwin K. Dole,
president of Pi Sigma Alpha. In
1928 the Republican party brought
75 per cent of the vote; in 1932, 63
per cent; and in 1936, 61 per cent.
The faculty poll of 1936 showed 46
