# Dimnet Sees 'Golden Age' Of Literature
## Frenchman Predicts Culture in Education 
### 
"America is a young country. Ev
eryone knows it because she men
tions the fact so often, but the
trouble is that America has been a
young country for a long time," de
clared Abbe Ernest Dimnet, noted
French priest, author, and philoso
pher, who last night discussed "Lit
erature and Education in France
and America."
As a young country, America pos
sesses vast reserves of vitality, be
lieves the distinguished Jesuit, who
explains that the younger members
of college faculties are gradually
laying the foundation for a whole
new standard of culture.
DEVELOPMENT INEVITABLE
"When this new culture, the de
velopment of which is inevitable, is
finally fused with America's tre
mendous vitality, the 'golden age of
literature' will come," asserted the
French prelate, who suggested that
American colleges raise the stand
ards of high schools in order to
"make graduation more than a
ceremony."
That happiness is the philosophy
underlying American life, a phi
losophy which has caused the de
velopment of the tradition that the
United States is 'God's country,' is
the opinion of Abbe Dimnet, who
spoke before a capacity audience at
a lecture of the Tuesday Evening
Series in Memorial Hall auditorium.
"It is the notion in America that
happiness is supreme," continued the
Abbe, who believes that "Americans
would not be one-half so happy if
they did not think themselves the
best in everything."
EDUCATED TO CRITICISM
Abbe Dimnet declared that, unlike
the people of America, the French
are "governed and represented" by
literary people, and that France's
educational system is based largely
on literary and dramatic criticism,
while the development of creative
ness and production are virtually
ignored.
Because of this emphasis on criti
cism, the French are more inter
ested in the attainment of culture
than in production, and more in
terested in developing a "public"
than in the formation of a group of
creative writers, explained the pre
late, who declared that "American
it'es are pretty poor."
