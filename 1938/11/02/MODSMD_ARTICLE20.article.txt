## Owners To Be Fined $2 as Excom Urges Study of Confiscation 
### 
If the B.A.C. follows the suggestion Ex Committee made last night, 87
student body cards confiscated last Saturday will be returned on payment
of a $2 fine.
Immediate action will he taken, so that students will have their cards
back in time for the University of Washington game next Saturday, ac-

cording to A1 Horn, chairman of
Men s Council, who had conferred
with A1 Masters, general manager of
the Board of Athletic Control. s
j HOLDERS FINED
Ex Committee's suggestion was re
j quested by Mr. Masters, according to
[ Horn. The actual recommendation
I was that the B.A.C. follow the same
I procedure it has followed in the
past, Ex Committee assuming such
action has been return of seized
cards on payment of a $2 fine.
The cards were taken up at the
U.C.L.A. game when holders could
not satisfy officials they were Stan
ford students.
To formulate a permanent policy
to cover confiscation of student body
cards, A.S.S.U. President H. B. Lec
appointed a committee consisting of
Horn (chairman), Gretchen Ahl
swede, Carolyn Hibbard, Andy
Stojkovich, Pat Skinner and Lee.
SEIZURE 'LENIENT*
Any policy decided upon will lie
submitted to the B.A.C. "purely as
a suggestion," according to Horn,
who said Mr. Masters is "sick and
tired of going through this rigama
role of validation."
Terming their action on last Sat
urday's seizure lenient, they ap
proved it "because this was the first
time they really have gone after
violators." Some sort of penalty is
necessary, however, they agreed.
Other Ex Committee business at,
last night's meeting included action
on the following subjects:
SATURDAY NIGHT DANCES:
Because only 42 couples— not count
ing firemen, policc, and punch ven
dors—attended Cardinals' dance last.
Saturday, the committee decided
dances should be held only when
there is good prospect of making
; money or at least breaking even,
j Blaming "a poor week-end" for the
j slight, attendance, they appropriated
(funds to cover the loss — approxi
j matejy $90.
Roy Thompson, president of Cardi
nals, questioned the advisability of
continuing frequent campus dances,
ot. give those without cars some
thing to do Saturday night.
"If there are only 42 people with
i out automobiles, we might as well
quit," he said. "When we try to hold
a dance every Saturday night, people
are bound to stop coming, because
our dances aren't what you can get
at the city. But if we're going to
try to please those without cars,
that's a different matter."
PARKED CARS: When a couple,
parked at the side of the road, is
interrupted by a big badge and flash
light and an order to move on, it
becomes a problem of Ex Commit
tee, members were told.
Agreeing that the "cops are not
trying to heckle" but are protecting
couples from hold-ups, Coline Up
shaw suggested there is "less chance
of being robbed on campus than
back in the hills," where people
must go when told to move along.
Whether or not cars shall be al
j lowed to park on campus unmolested
! will be considered by Men's and
| Women's Councils, it was decided.
BOATHOUSE: P'inal plans have
j ;>rrived, Lee announced, and total
' cost, including landscaping and
| maintenance expenses, may run as
high as $10,000.
To raise money to pay for the
; structure, plans are being made for
I a big two-day campaign, including a
carnival, a benefit barbecue, and a
dance, Lee said.
POLO AWARD: Recommendation
that Robert G. Thomas be granted
a minor sports award for serving as
senior polo manager was approved.
QUAD PROOFS: Because proofs
cannot be shown in the Women's
Clubhouse after this week, Business
Manager Margaret Hale was granted
permission to use a corner of the
Nitery for this purpose until other
arrangements can be made.
DATES GRANTED: Toyon Club,

SEIZURE 'LENIENT*
Any policy decided upon will lie
submitted to the B.A.C. "purely as
a suggestion," according to Horn,
who said Mr. Masters is "sick and
tired of going through this rigama
role of validation."
Terming their action on last Sat
urday's seizure lenient, they ap
proved it "because this was the first
time they really have gone after
violators." Some sort of penalty is
necessary, however, they agreed.
Other Ex Committee business at,
last night's meeting included action
on the following subjects:
SATURDAY NIGHT DANCES:
Because only 42 couples— not count
ing firemen, policc, and punch ven
dors—attended Cardinals' dance last.
Saturday, the committee decided
dances should be held only when
there is good prospect of making
; money or at least breaking even,
j Blaming "a poor week-end" for the
j slight, attendance, they appropriated
(funds to cover the loss — approxi
j matejy $90.
Roy Thompson, president of Cardi
nals, questioned the advisability of
continuing frequent campus dances,
ot. give those without cars some
thing to do Saturday night.
"If there are only 42 people with
i out automobiles, we might as well
quit," he said. "When we try to hold
a dance every Saturday night, people
are bound to stop coming, because
our dances aren't what you can get
at the city. But if we're going to
try to please those without cars,
that's a different matter."
PARKED CARS: When a couple,
parked at the side of the road, is
interrupted by a big badge and flash
light and an order to move on, it
becomes a problem of Ex Commit
tee, members were told.
Agreeing that the "cops are not
trying to heckle" but are protecting
couples from hold-ups, Coline Up
shaw suggested there is "less chance
of being robbed on campus than
back in the hills," where people
must go when told to move along.
Whether or not cars shall be al
j lowed to park on campus unmolested
! will be considered by Men's and
| Women's Councils, it was decided.
BOATHOUSE: P'inal plans have
j ;>rrived, Lee announced, and total
' cost, including landscaping and
| maintenance expenses, may run as
high as $10,000.
To raise money to pay for the
; structure, plans are being made for
I a big two-day campaign, including a
carnival, a benefit barbecue, and a
dance, Lee said.
POLO AWARD: Recommendation
that Robert G. Thomas be granted
a minor sports award for serving as
senior polo manager was approved.
QUAD PROOFS: Because proofs
cannot be shown in the Women's
Clubhouse after this week, Business
Manager Margaret Hale was granted
permission to use a corner of the
Nitery for this purpose until other
arrangements can be made.
DATES GRANTED: Toyon Club,
informal dance, Dec. 3; Dramatic
Council, Nov. 18. 2:15 o'clock, Gaie

If the B.A.C. follows the suggestion Ex Committee made last night, 87
student body cards confiscated last Saturday will be returned on payment
of a $2 fine.
Immediate action will he taken, so that students will have their cards
back in time for the University of Washington game next Saturday, ac-

cording to A1 Horn, chairman of
