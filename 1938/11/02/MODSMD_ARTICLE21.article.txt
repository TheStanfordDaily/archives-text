# Berreman Says Labor Will Bach Democrats
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
Labor, as always, will support the avowedly liberal candidates in next
Week's state election.
That is the prediction of J. V. Berreman, instructor in sociology, who
attended the convention of the State Federation of Labor in Santa Barbara i
a month ago.
Despite the fact that only one of the two major labor organizations
has actively endorsed the Demo-^

cratic ticket, it seems very likely
that the rank and file of both will
vote for it, according to Mr. Berre
man, who pointed out that the Re
publican record on labor is far from
satisfactory in labor's eyes.
"Of the many bills killed by Gov
ernor Merriam, either by direct veto
or pocket veto," he said, "a sizeable
number have either directly con
cerned labor or have been backed by
it. This has given rise to a feeling
among labor groups that no Repub
lican administration, at least at the
present time, will give labor a fair
deal."
t.1.0. ENDORSES OLSON
In line with this, the C.1.0. has
come out with a blanket endorse
ment of the Democratic ticket, par
ticularly emphasizing its support of
gubernatorial candidate Culbert L.
Olson. He has pledged himself to a
liberal policy, and has come out flat
ly against Proposition No. 1, the anti
picketing bill, which labor particu
larly distrusts. For this reason he
has gained the support of the Lewis
organization, a fact which may have
u very noticeable effect on both his
liberal and conservative followers.
Regarding endorsement of candi
dates, the State Federation in its
Santa Barbara meeting carefully re
frained from taking sides, on the
ground that such partisanship would
stir up sufficient prejudice to cause
passage of anti-labor measures.
Despite this local action, however,
President William Green of the A.
F. of L. last week endorsed Gover
nor Merriam, a move which has re
sulted in much friction within the
state, according to Mr. Berreman.
"Many of the county units have
declared their support of Senator
Olsen, some in pointed and open de
fiance of President Green's action.
Indicative of growing discontent

with his leadership, this revolt will i
undoubtedly result in a serious '
split of A. F. of L. voting strength j
in the state."

Results in the Senatorial cam- |
paign will be paiallel to those in the j
governorship race, Mr. Berreman
said.
"Although labor's support of
Downey is not to be taken as sup- j
port of his stand on the Townsend
and other pension plans, it never- j
theless indicates that labor feels him :
to be by far the lesser of two evils." J
Mr. Berreman dismissed as unim- j
portant the question of Tom Moon
ey's pardon, charged against Sena- !
tor Olson in Republican campaign
literature. It is a perennial issue, j
now more symbolical than political,
and it will have very little effect j
either on the campaign or on labor's ,
vote, he felt.

gubernatorial candidate Culbert L.
Olson. He has pledged himself to a
liberal policy, and has come out flat
ly against Proposition No. 1, the anti
picketing bill, which labor particu
larly distrusts. For this reason he
has gained the support of the Lewis
organization, a fact which may have
u very noticeable effect on both his
liberal and conservative followers.
Regarding endorsement of candi
dates, the State Federation in its
Santa Barbara meeting carefully re
frained from taking sides, on the
ground that such partisanship would
stir up sufficient prejudice to cause
passage of anti-labor measures.
Despite this local action, however,
President William Green of the A.
F. of L. last week endorsed Gover
nor Merriam, a move which has re
sulted in much friction within the
state, according to Mr. Berreman.
"Many of the county units have
declared their support of Senator
Olsen, some in pointed and open de
fiance of President Green's action.
Indicative of growing discontent

with his leadership, this revolt will i
undoubtedly result in a serious '
split of A. F. of L. voting strength j
in the state."
LABOR PICKS DOWNEY
Results in the Senatorial cam- |
paign will be paiallel to those in the j
governorship race, Mr. Berreman
said.
"Although labor's support of
Downey is not to be taken as sup- j
port of his stand on the Townsend
and other pension plans, it never- j
theless indicates that labor feels him :
to be by far the lesser of two evils." J
Mr. Berreman dismissed as unim- j
portant the question of Tom Moon
ey's pardon, charged against Sena- !
tor Olson in Republican campaign
literature. It is a perennial issue, j
now more symbolical than political,
and it will have very little effect j
either on the campaign or on labor's ,
vote, he felt.
Labor, as always, will support the avowedly liberal candidates in next
Week's state election.
That is the prediction of J. V. Berreman, instructor in sociology, who
attended the convention of the State Federation of Labor in Santa Barbara i
a month ago.
Despite the fact that only one of the two major labor organizations
has actively endorsed the Demo-^

cratic ticket, it seems very likely
that the rank and file of both will
vote for it, according to Mr. Berre
man, who pointed out that the Re
publican record on labor is far from
satisfactory in labor's eyes.
"Of the many bills killed by Gov
ernor Merriam, either by direct veto
or pocket veto," he said, "a sizeable
number have either directly con
cerned labor or have been backed by
it. This has given rise to a feeling
among labor groups that no Repub
lican administration, at least at the
present time, will give labor a fair
deal."
