# 'All's Well' Director Tells Play's History
## 
### THOMAS WOOD STEVENS Director of Dramatics 
The age of Queen Victoria re
jected "All's Well that End's Well"
on grounds of propriety. In the first
place, it was founded on a story
from the Decameron, which was a
forbidden book. Then the heroine
was a lady doctor, and women in
the medical profession were frowned
on; Bernard Shaw, who knew his
Victorians and rebelled against
them, made a slashing job of his
comment on the first production the
play had had in London in a cen
tury or so.
Even the late Eighteenth Century
thought the play risque, and Charles
Kemble made a highly censored ver
sion in order that he might appear as
Parolies—the brilliance of the part
tempting him in spite of the preju
dice against the play.
Under all this, the Victorian crit
ics, for the most part, refused to see
the play in terms of its realism; they
insisted it was a romance, and not a
pleasant one.
SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER
There were commentators who
saw and praised the great beauty
and vitality of Helena, but regretted
that she found it necessary to stoop
to get her man. On this point, there
seems little sensitiveness in the mod

ern audience—they are used to see
ing the woman get her man. Shaw's
comedies may have helped, as his
heroines use the same technic as
Helena.
The Victorians insisted that Bert
ram is simply a cad; again, they re
ject reality. Given a spoiled young
scion of great wealth, suddenly
forced into marriage against his will,
it would be difficult for him to act
otherwise. And as for his sudden
reversal at the end, one has only to
follow his case in police court terms
to believe that too.
A THEATRE ACTS
The play belongs in the theatre—
it acts far better than it reads. This
is of course due not only to the
good theatre in the plot, but to the
vividness of the characters.
Leaving ethical prejudices aside,
the leading figures are tremendous
ly alive. And the range of other
parts — the humorous and charming
old court gentleman, Lafeu; the af
flicted king, who faces death with
a stoic heroism, and rewards' his
preserver with royal if arbitrary
generosity; the Clown, with the wit
of the stable yard about him; the
Countess of Rousillon, the most de
lightful and distinguished of Shake

speare's old women; and finally the
magnificent braggart, Parolles, the
military man of words, who is car
ried through to his logical end, and
unmasked to the laughter of all
Italy and France.
It's a lucky day for the theatre
when actors can take up these parts
without shuddering at what they
fear the audience will think of the
plot. Nobody nowadays thinks any
thing of the lady doctor who gets
her man except, "Why shouldn't
she?"

the medical profession were frowned
on; Bernard Shaw, who knew his
Victorians and rebelled against
them, made a slashing job of his
comment on the first production the
play had had in London in a cen
tury or so.
Even the late Eighteenth Century
thought the play risque, and Charles
Kemble made a highly censored ver
sion in order that he might appear as
Parolies—the brilliance of the part
tempting him in spite of the preju
dice against the play.
Under all this, the Victorian crit
ics, for the most part, refused to see
the play in terms of its realism; they
insisted it was a romance, and not a
pleasant one.
SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER
There were commentators who
saw and praised the great beauty
and vitality of Helena, but regretted
that she found it necessary to stoop
to get her man. On this point, there
seems little sensitiveness in the mod

ern audience—they are used to see
ing the woman get her man. Shaw's
comedies may have helped, as his
heroines use the same technic as
Helena.
The Victorians insisted that Bert
ram is simply a cad; again, they re
ject reality. Given a spoiled young
scion of great wealth, suddenly
forced into marriage against his will,
it would be difficult for him to act
otherwise. And as for his sudden
reversal at the end, one has only to
follow his case in police court terms
to believe that too.
A THEATRE ACTS
The play belongs in the theatre—
it acts far better than it reads. This
is of course due not only to the
good theatre in the plot, but to the
vividness of the characters.
Leaving ethical prejudices aside,
the leading figures are tremendous
ly alive. And the range of other
parts — the humorous and charming
old court gentleman, Lafeu; the af
flicted king, who faces death with
a stoic heroism, and rewards' his
preserver with royal if arbitrary
generosity; the Clown, with the wit
of the stable yard about him; the
Countess of Rousillon, the most de
lightful and distinguished of Shake

speare's old women; and finally the
magnificent braggart, Parolles, the
military man of words, who is car
ried through to his logical end, and
unmasked to the laughter of all
Italy and France.
It's a lucky day for the theatre
when actors can take up these parts
without shuddering at what they
fear the audience will think of the
plot. Nobody nowadays thinks any
thing of the lady doctor who gets
her man except, "Why shouldn't
she?"
The age of Queen Victoria re
jected "All's Well that End's Well"
on grounds of propriety. In the first
place, it was founded on a story
from the Decameron, which was a
forbidden book. Then the heroine
was a lady doctor, and women in
the medical profession were frowned
on; Bernard Shaw, who knew his
Victorians and rebelled against
them, made a slashing job of his
