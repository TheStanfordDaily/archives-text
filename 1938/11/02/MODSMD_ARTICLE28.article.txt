## SOCIALLY-CONSCIOUS SOPHS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Dutch-Exchange-Student Andries
1 Deinum yesterday voiced a disap
pointment that Stanford sophomores
should "go slumming" next Friday.
Let Exchange-Student Deinum
not translate our "Let's Go Slum
ming" theme too literally, for we
are not making "fun of the misery
of other people."
Quite frankly ,the thought of "in
sulting these poor people" never
occurred to us and we dare say that
this socially-conscious attitude oc
! curs to few other people in America.
I We're not writing a treatise on so
| ciology nor do we feel that the tag
| line of this dance can appreciably
! affect the outcome of the slum prob
lem, one way or the other.
We are grateful, however, to Mr.
! Deinum for calling the attention of
' the Class of '41 to something which
I might easily be misinterpreted. To
show him that Stanford sophomores
i are not just "well-to-do kids imi-
I tating the romantic life of the under
| privileged," we offer 10 per cent of
I the net profits from the Cotillion to
j the National Red Cross drive.
