# Ex-'Teams To Beat' To Tangle Saturday

When Tiny Thornhill crosses glances with Jimmy Phelan again this
week-end, both of them will prohahiy hlush deep purple.
It was iust about six weeks ago that Thornhill picked Phelan\s Wash
ington Huskies as the team most likely to win the conference football
championship. Phelan, always the gentleman, retaliated by nominating

Tiny's Indians as the team to beat.
The two teams meet in the Stan
ford Stadium this Saturday after
noon with Phelan on the coaches' hot
seat after losing six games in a row
and Thornhill about half way up
the 13 steps because of the in-and
out tactics of his squad.
BOTH ON UP-GRADE
However, both outfits made re
markable progress their last time
out. Washington lost by one touch
down to the Cal Bears but they
really put on a killer-diller of an
exhibition before they cried uncle.
Stanford should have beaten U. C.
L. A. by 12 points if they had had
the line-up which finished the game
in at the start of the struggle. As it
was, the Indians were graceful in
deed despite their 6-point loss.
Up in Seattle, Phelan is working
on a line to balance with the best
array of backs he has had during
his sentence at Washington. Dean
McAdams, Rudy Mucha, Al Cruver,
Chuck Newton, and a long list of
other backs look like something from
Southern California. What Phelan
has lacked has been line charge. In
other words, his problem was just
about the same that Thornhill had
two weeks ago.
It was just about five weeks ago
that Thornhill had so many backs
that he had to shift some of them
into the line. Now Tiny is lucky to
find a quartet of men out for prac
tice who know the backfield signals.
SHIFTING BACKFIELD
Freddie Ledeboer has played
quarter, full, and left half. Jack
Brenner started at left half; now he's
a right half and possibly a quarter
when Paulman isn't playing. Cookie
South played both left and right half
before he hurt his shoulder last Sat
urday. Rod Parker, Norm Standlee,
and Gene Coldiron play both full
and quarter.
Early odds on the Washington
game rate Stanford an even choice,
although the Huskies will come down
at full strength with the possible
exception of Tom Sheldrake. The
Indians will be minus Pete Fay and
South, and Bill Paulman may not be
strong enough to play a full 60
minutes. Fay's next appearance, if
any, this season will probably be in
the Big Game.
