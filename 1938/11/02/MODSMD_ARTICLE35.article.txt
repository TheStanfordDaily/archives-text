# Berkeley Cubs Hope To Taste Papoose Blood
## Unbeaten Freshmen Go North Saturday To Meet Cal Squad 
### 
Refusing to concede an inch to the
best Stanford frosh grid team since
the "Vow Boys," California's Bear
cubs have retreated to their lair for
a final claw trimming before the
Little Big Game come Saturday at
Berkeley.
The claws in the Bearcub attack
are Captain Jack McQuarry, versa
tile left halfback, and Pete Youdall,
socking fullback, on offense, and
Carl Leipzig and Ray Amling at the
flanks on defense. These are all
claws who don't need very much
trimming, because they are potent
weapons as they stand now.
McQUAARY IS THREAT
McQuarry, 190 pounds of driving,
triple-threat ball-carrier, carries the
Cubs' offensive burden, and judging
by Cal's record, he carries it more
than adequately.
The Cubs have dropped but one
contest, to the U.S.C. frosh, 13-6, and
have defeated all over comers, in
cluding San Francisco J. C., 12-0;
U.C.L.A., 14-6; Modesto J.C., 16-0;
and Sacramento J.C., 7-0.
Despite the loss of three first
stringers and one second-stringer,
Evans has found capable replace
ments, and the Bear line-up is prac
tically set. Regulars who are out of
the Little Big Game classic are Joe
Merlo, quarterback; Martin Beck,
right tackle; and Don Warhurst,
center; while Al Derian, capable sub
for McQuarry, is also through for
the rest of the season.
POSITION CHANGES
Taking over the signal-calling
berth in place of Menlo is Dick Foll
mer, a made-over guard, while Lar
ry Taylor moves into the pivot spot.
Taylor and Warhurst were prac
tically on even terms, so the latter's
loss is not so painful to Evans. The
third new regular is George Herrero
at tackle. Herrero has shown such
great improvement that he has risen
from the third string to annex
Beck's vacated position.
Filling out the backfield with Mc-
Quarry, Youdall, and Follmer is
Jean Witter, right half. Leipzig and
Amling will start at ends, Bob Rein
hard will team up with Herrero at
tackle, Bob Hongola and George
Nicholau, a pair of hard-charging
linemen, will open at guard, with
Taylor answering the opening
whistle at center.

find convicts are more interested in
classes than college students—re
maining quiet, attentive, and orderly
in their classes.

claws who don't need very much
trimming, because they are potent
weapons as they stand now.
McQUAARY IS THREAT
McQuarry, 190 pounds of driving,
triple-threat ball-carrier, carries the
Cubs' offensive burden, and judging
by Cal's record, he carries it more
than adequately.
The Cubs have dropped but one
contest, to the U.S.C. frosh, 13-6, and
have defeated all over comers, in
cluding San Francisco J. C., 12-0;
U.C.L.A., 14-6; Modesto J.C., 16-0;
and Sacramento J.C., 7-0.
Despite the loss of three first
stringers and one second-stringer,
Evans has found capable replace
ments, and the Bear line-up is prac
tically set. Regulars who are out of
the Little Big Game classic are Joe
Merlo, quarterback; Martin Beck,
right tackle; and Don Warhurst,
center; while Al Derian, capable sub
for McQuarry, is also through for
the rest of the season.
POSITION CHANGES
Taking over the signal-calling
berth in place of Menlo is Dick Foll
mer, a made-over guard, while Lar
ry Taylor moves into the pivot spot.
Taylor and Warhurst were prac
tically on even terms, so the latter's
loss is not so painful to Evans. The
third new regular is George Herrero
at tackle. Herrero has shown such
great improvement that he has risen
from the third string to annex
Beck's vacated position.
Filling out the backfield with Mc-
Quarry, Youdall, and Follmer is
Jean Witter, right half. Leipzig and
Amling will start at ends, Bob Rein
hard will team up with Herrero at
tackle, Bob Hongola and George
Nicholau, a pair of hard-charging
linemen, will open at guard, with
Taylor answering the opening
whistle at center.

University professors in Oklahoma
find convicts are more interested in
classes than college students—re

Refusing to concede an inch to the
best Stanford frosh grid team since
the "Vow Boys," California's Bear
cubs have retreated to their lair for
a final claw trimming before the
Little Big Game come Saturday at
Berkeley.
The claws in the Bearcub attack
are Captain Jack McQuarry, versa
tile left halfback, and Pete Youdall,
socking fullback, on offense, and
Carl Leipzig and Ray Amling at the
flanks on defense. These are all
claws who don't need very much
trimming, because they are potent
weapons as they stand now.
