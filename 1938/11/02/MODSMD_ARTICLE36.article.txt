SCORING PUNCHES for Stanford's 1938 water polo team are provided by John Lamb (right) and Jack
Loupe, forwards, on Nort Thornton's gashouse gang. Lamb's southpaw scoring shots, lightly-thrown, con
trast greatly with Loupe's cannonball heaves, which are almost impossible to bat down. Both are hallhawks,
forming a combination which tops any pair offered by the other coast teams.
