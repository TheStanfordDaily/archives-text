# Coach Dean Slashes Varsity Hoop Squad
## 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Gradually whipping his charges
through their paces l'or the first pre
season game with University of San
Francisco, December 2, Coach Ev
erett Dean yesterday slashed the
varsity basketball team down to 29
players in the first major "cut" be
fore the season officially gets under
way.
Down to a workable order after a
month of testing the squlfd for suc
cessors to Hank Luisetti and Com
pany, the 29 survivors will be sent
through another trimming before or
after Thanksgiving, when Dean will
nominate a 15-man varsity to carry
Stanford's colors into the cage sea
son. Ten men also will constitute a
reserve team.
Offensive and defensive funda
mentals will continue to be the or
der of practice drills, according to
Dean, who is a strong believer that
clubs should be well-versed in
fundamental tactics."
Key man in Dean's remolding of
Stanford's cage squad, which had a
championship "reign of terror" dur
ing the last three seasons, will be
Captain Phil Zonne, only returning
veteran from last year's varsity.
The rest of the club is new and
inexperienced with varsity action;
but what the team lacks in known
quantity it will undoubtedly make
up in enthusiasm and sound aggres
siveness, observers contend.
While the Trojans are already be
ing tabbed to head the conference,
the Indian cagers are taking on a
spirited under-dog frame of mind,
pointing toward upsets to make
Stanford rooters forget the famous
"Laughing Boys."
Following the U.S.F. tilt in the
local Pavilion will be Fresno State.
During Christmas vacation, the In-

dian cagers tackle three strong barn- j
storming rivals in Idaho, Dartmouth j
and Oregon at San Francisco's Pa
cific Auditorium. Tilts with Ne
braska, St. Mary's and Santa Clara
on the campus will close the pre
league schedule.
Competing with Zonne for forward I
berths are John Alltucker, Richard
Bigler, Jack Butler, Harlan Copsey,
Bob Oakford, Lew Staehle, Don
Williams, Leon Lafaille, Derrol Hud
dleson, Tiff Denton, and Dick La-
Franchi. Center candidates to suc
ceed Art Stoefen include Burroughs
Anderson, Wilbert Anderson, Don
Burness, Ed DeMoss, Dick Lyon, Bill
Rumbley, and Dick Taylor.
Battling for guard posts are Bill '
Rapp. Gill Rahn, Bob Burnett, Ken
Davidson, Bill Hannan, Jack Kessel, |
Ted Lyon, and William Niccols. Bud !
Jones and Bill Schroeder were re- j
tained by Dean but their positions
are undecided.

players in the first major "cut" be
fore the season officially gets under
way.
Down to a workable order after a
month of testing the squlfd for suc
cessors to Hank Luisetti and Com
pany, the 29 survivors will be sent
through another trimming before or
after Thanksgiving, when Dean will
nominate a 15-man varsity to carry
Stanford's colors into the cage sea
son. Ten men also will constitute a
reserve team.
Offensive and defensive funda
mentals will continue to be the or
der of practice drills, according to
Dean, who is a strong believer that
clubs should be well-versed in
fundamental tactics."
Key man in Dean's remolding of
Stanford's cage squad, which had a
championship "reign of terror" dur
ing the last three seasons, will be
Captain Phil Zonne, only returning
veteran from last year's varsity.
The rest of the club is new and
inexperienced with varsity action;
but what the team lacks in known
quantity it will undoubtedly make
up in enthusiasm and sound aggres
siveness, observers contend.
While the Trojans are already be
ing tabbed to head the conference,
the Indian cagers are taking on a
spirited under-dog frame of mind,
pointing toward upsets to make
Stanford rooters forget the famous
"Laughing Boys."
Following the U.S.F. tilt in the
local Pavilion will be Fresno State.
During Christmas vacation, the In-

dian cagers tackle three strong barn- j
storming rivals in Idaho, Dartmouth j
