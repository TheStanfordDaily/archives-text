# Not Thought Transference
## 
### 
FACED with the request by A1 Masters, Gen
eral Manager, to set down a specific policy
concerning transferability or nontransferability
of student body cards, Ex Committee last night
first answered the question of Saturday's un
fortunate 87—"Do we get our cards back?"
Although Ex Committee's action was in the
form of a recommendation to the Board of Ath
letic Control, the probable solution, as sug
gested by Excom, will be the one usually fol
lowed—allowing new cards to be purchased
Ifrom the Registrar's office for $2.
In steering its course between the varied
suggested combinations of punishment or len
iency and deciding to follow past action rather
than set down some especial and arbitrary rul
ing, Ex Committee acted sanely and justly. At
the same time, they disposed of the imme
diate problem arising from Saturday's inci
dent in order to devote energy and thought to
a greater one: "What shall be the permanent
policy on transference?"
Although, in the past, custom has dictated
non-transference — and the custom has been
followed by both student and administrative
bodies—the current confusion on the question
points to the definite need for some clear-cut
and final ruling.
And when that policy is defined, it must be
consistently adhered to. Probably most of the
griping which has arisen after Saturday's inci
dent was due to the surprise element of the
action rather than any sincere or well-thought
out objection to the policy. The campus has
acted as if it had an unforeseen, if not unwar
ranted or unwarned, kick in the trousers.
Some have taken the jolt with a philosophical
shrug of the shoulders like Campus Opinioner
yesterday. Some, like Brother "Disillusioned"
today, have self-righteously rationalized them
selves into an injured position which would
provoke tears from a crocodile.
In the specific case of the U.C.L.A. validation
episode, however, nothing can be done but
wipe up spilt milk. This Ex Committee has
done tonight.
By the next meeting, sincere and deep
thought should have evolved the solution to
prevent any more tipping of the milk-pitcher.
And all the crying it provokes.
