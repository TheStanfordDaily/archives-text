# Slumming Sophs Repent
## 
### 
WHILE the Eastern part of the United States
was running frantically away from a sup
posed attack by the men of Mars Sunday, a
little "Man-from-Mars" episode was brewing
at Stanford, broke Monday morning when
Dutch student Andries Deinum scored the
Sophomores for adopting the "Slumming"
theme for their Cotillion.
His thought—that the "Slumming" idea de
noted a snobbish attitude directed at the lower
members of society—shook the Sophomores to
the extent that, today, they offer 10 per cent
of net profits to the Red Cross. Though it took
a comparative "Man from Mars" to spotlight
their position, they have become socially con
scious enough to realize that Deinum has a
point.
As Dance Chairman Bob Anderson points
out today, the insult to the underprivileged
was unintentional. But it does represent a very
deep-seated attitude, an attitude that we of the
upper financial brackets are by some divine
right empowered to flaunt our lucky superior
ity in the faces of those below us.
It is hardly to be expected that the Sophs'
gesture of donation to the Red Cross will check
that attitude; it is set much too firmly by en
vironment and by social heredity. But their
move does indicate that they recognize that
the dance theme was in bad taste and was
unquestionably anti-democratic.
Ex-Editor Jorgensen was right when he said
that Stanford students not only didn't know

when they were well off, but didn't know what
well-off meant because they had no conception
of any other social state. The Sophs bore out
his statement beautifully when they chose the
slumming theme.
But if their gesture of giving to the Red Cross
is sincere, they have somewhat moved to cor
rect their attitude; at least the action indicated
that the Sophs have been vaguely stirred men
tally by Deinum's "Man-from-Mars" look at
them.
Again, though, their temporary awakening
to social consciousness will be just enough to
make the succeeding sleep more blissful.
