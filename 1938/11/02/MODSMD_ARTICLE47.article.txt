# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
MARTIAN THROUGH GEORGIA
ITALF a dozen of us were distributed around the edit
office Sunday night, pondering the idea that it
was time to go home for supper, when somebody
turned on the radio. As the tubes wanned up, dance
music rattled around the little room, and then sud
denly the music trailed off. The professionally un
emotional voice of a news broadcaster began a series
of bulletins that brought tilted chairs upright and cut
off in its adolescence the joke someone was telling.
Martian invaders had landed in New Jersey. The
black magic of a heat ray had wiped out bystanders.
New Jersey was under martial law. Mysterious poison
gas was annihilating the population of New York.

It was incredible but convincing. None of us bolted
for the hills, and there were no frantic revival meet
ings in the Shack. But all of us wondered if the 120-
point. type would have to be dusted off for the next
morning's paper, even though we were ashamed to
admit the idea. And so we waited with irritation and
uneasiness for an announcement that would label the
program as fiction.
We got our reassurance finally when the supposed
Secretary of the Interior announced a national emer
gency. F.D.R., we knew, would never leave an oppor
tunity like that to a subordinate. We went home then,
carrying with us that feeling of foolishness that comes
to a man who has gotten out of bed to make sure
that an already well-bolted door is locked.

r rHE next morning, we didn't feel so silly. The news
papers informed us that people all over the coun
try had been stampeded by that program. Mass hys
teria and panic had swept in wherever the bulletins
had been heard.
Undoubtedly there is some profound sociological
significance to the phenomenon. But the only conclu
sion I can draw is a superficial one. Our generation
has been battered by so many surprises and has seen
so many of its dogma exploded that it is shell-shocked.
It will jump frantically at the slightest alarm, like an
elderly lady alone in a big house.

Usually a man has a certain number of fixed ideas
on which he builds his life. When anything comes up
to contradict his ideas, he placidly ignores it. If the
pony express had catapulted across the plains bear
ing the word that New York had been bombed by air
craft, our pioneer ancestors would have said "Fiddle
sticks" or something stronger. And they would have
gone back to swindling the Indians, unconcerned.
But today we lack that protective armor of dogma.
We have seen dictators behave like conquering Roman
generals in an era consecrated to democracy. We have
been pelted wilh rumors of poison gas, long range
guns, and world revolution.

And so we pre not far from having the screaming
jitters. We jump at anything, because we no longer
trust our judgment as to what, can happen and what
can't. We are like small children who have wandered
out of their familiar backyard and onto a busy street.
Personally, I don't grudge CBS the uneasy five min
utes it gave me. But I'm surprised that it didn't fore
see the results. When you sneak up behind a nervous
man and shout "Boo," you don't ordinarily expect him
to raise one eyebrow and remark, "Ah, purely fic
tional."
