# Lightly. . . And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
IVIOW we are six.
A couple of the boys went down to the game
last Friday in a car and stopped at a little joint near
Salinas to get, something to eat.
They had been there a while when a girl about 14
came in. Right out of the hills.
"What have ya got in the way of sandwiches?" she
asked the waiter-proprietor-dishwasher. He pointed
to a sign with all the sandwiches they had in stock, so
to speak, listed on it.
"Sign?" the girl asked. "I don't see no sign."
Now it was a little shack and the sign was right
in front of her. It covered the whole wall. It was
small for a wall but big for a sign.
The waiter-etc. looked at her very disgustedly
and began reading ofT the list of sandwiches. When
he got through, the girl asked, "How much arc ham
burgers?"
"Ten cents."
"That's pretty high for hamburgers, ain't it?"
The guy wisely made no answer, so she said, "You
got milk here?"
"Yeah."
"How much?"
"Ten cents."
"Five cents."
"Ten cents."
"OK. Hamburger and milk."
As the boys left, the girl was sitting at the counter
watching her hamburger sizzle. And finickly flicking
crumbs off the counter.

still the stories come in from the south.
Some of the U.C.L.A. student officials and big
shots thought it would be a fine thing if they met
someone from Stanford at the station in an official
Hollywood way. They decided to meet Betty Davis,
A.S.S.U. vice-president.
Telegrams with complicated instructions and coun
ter-instructions were exchanged. I wouldn't try to get
the straight on what these arrangements were, be
cause I don't believe either Betty or the people from
U.C.L.A. were quite sure.
Because Saturday morning the U.C.L.A. Official
Greeting* Committee was at the Los Angeles Southern
Pacific station quite early, equipped with conventional
greeting paraphernalia and two large trucks. Why two
large trucks, I don't know, but they were there.
And Miss Davis, with absolutely no ulterior motives,
got off the train at Glendale.

Something happened last week which could have
worried and embarrassed me. I sent a suit and my
fraternity pin *o the cleaners.
But they both came hack.
I'm not very popular.
