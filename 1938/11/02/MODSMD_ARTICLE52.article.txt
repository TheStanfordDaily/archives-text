# CAMPUS OPINION
## HEIL B.A.C. 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Saturday's same is over. Let us j
forget about it and turn our atten- (
tion to some of the sadder aspects |
of the day—namely, a slap in the ;
face of Stanford students who live '
in the South, and a lousy act by i
the B.A.C. Seventeen hundred stu
dent cards and tickets went to L.A.
the game in the hands of less
than 1200 students. They say the
B.A.C. was "suspicious" that other
than bona fide holders were in pos
session. Suspicious is the wrong
word they knew that it was true.
They have known the fact in past
years. That fact has grown into a
custom by mutual silent assent be
tween students from the South and
the B.A.C. There is an honor code
buiit up at this school that makes it
one of the finest of its kind. We
accept that code and do our part;
very seldom do we mention enforce
ment—it's just silently accepted. In
exchange for our agreement to con
duct ourselves as Stanford students
should, we receive certain privileges.
This custom, built up on mutual
agreement and part of that code,
involves the exchange of student
cards. But over the many years of
playing one game in the South, either
S.C. or U.C.L.A., and the fact that
many students cannot make the trip,
consequently causing a small Indian
x-ooting section, the B.A.C. extended
the courtesy of allowing southern
students to acquire a reasonable
number of student body cards and
take girl or boy friends. There was
never anything said about selling
rooter's tickets, for it just not nec
essary. This custom has become so
strong that it has become a part of
our Honor Code.
Saturday the B.A.C. as part of
this university's administration
broke the honor code wide open and
confiscated approximately 100 stu
dent tickets. The number seized
must make the students' view clear,
for it is inconceivable that so many
would break the Code simulta
neously.
What actually happened? Most
students arrived at the Coliseum

about 2 o'clock, for they felt that |
their seats as rooters were reserved.
Immediately, they were confronted
with two booth-hidden B.A.C.
| stooges. All students must line up
! and have their tickets "validated."
j You ran and jumped in line and j
. waited. First you stood until the
| game started, then you waited until j
the first quarter was over, and then
maybe it was your turn to take the j
third degree. Either Mr. Sullivan
or Mr. Erwin would ask you, "How
many teeth has your house-mother
got?" or "How many books does
the Library hold?"—and they had
the Bawlout there to see that you
were right! You stammered and
stuttered and swore that the hu
miliation and inconvenience was the (
lowest kind of trick even the B.A.C.
could dig up. You watched friends
of students have someone's card
picked up and their whole week-end
ruined by the thought of what they
would say to the owner. By the
time you got into the stadium, you
saw half-time card stunts.
When you finally did get in you
.were in no mood to yell for a team
that had by this time become, in
your mind, a mere tool in the hands j
of a super-independent B.A.C. Ask
any student there if the rooting was
not the poorest Stanford has ever 1
turned out. "Yes," we said, "we
know the members of the team, but •
they are not playing for the school; :
they are playing for the Athletic!
department. Why should we sup- !
port them?"—and we would not.
We of the South shall never forget ;
the slur of an over-handed adminis
tration. More important, the whole j
, student body will remember that 1
the administration broke off its half!
j of the Honor Code agreement.

The Editor, Sir:
Saturday's same is over. Let us j
forget about it and turn our atten- (
tion to some of the sadder aspects |
of the day—namely, a slap in the ;
face of Stanford students who live '
in the South, and a lousy act by i
the B.A.C. Seventeen hundred stu
dent cards and tickets went to L.A.
the game in the hands of less
than 1200 students. They say the
B.A.C. was "suspicious" that other
than bona fide holders were in pos
session. Suspicious is the wrong
word they knew that it was true.
They have known the fact in past
years. That fact has grown into a
custom by mutual silent assent be
tween students from the South and
the B.A.C. There is an honor code
buiit up at this school that makes it
one of the finest of its kind. We
accept that code and do our part;
very seldom do we mention enforce
ment—it's just silently accepted. In
exchange for our agreement to con
duct ourselves as Stanford students
should, we receive certain privileges.
This custom, built up on mutual
agreement and part of that code,
involves the exchange of student
cards. But over the many years of
playing one game in the South, either
S.C. or U.C.L.A., and the fact that
many students cannot make the trip,
consequently causing a small Indian
x-ooting section, the B.A.C. extended
the courtesy of allowing southern
students to acquire a reasonable
number of student body cards and
take girl or boy friends. There was
never anything said about selling
rooter's tickets, for it just not nec
essary. This custom has become so
strong that it has become a part of
our Honor Code.
Saturday the B.A.C. as part of
this university's administration
broke the honor code wide open and
confiscated approximately 100 stu
dent tickets. The number seized
must make the students' view clear,
for it is inconceivable that so many
would break the Code simulta
neously.
What actually happened? Most
students arrived at the Coliseum

about 2 o'clock, for they felt that |
their seats as rooters were reserved.
Immediately, they were confronted
with two booth-hidden B.A.C.
| stooges. All students must line up
! and have their tickets "validated."
j You ran and jumped in line and j
. waited. First you stood until the
| game started, then you waited until j
the first quarter was over, and then
maybe it was your turn to take the j
third degree. Either Mr. Sullivan
or Mr. Erwin would ask you, "How
many teeth has your house-mother
got?" or "How many books does
the Library hold?"—and they had
the Bawlout there to see that you
were right! You stammered and
stuttered and swore that the hu
miliation and inconvenience was the (
lowest kind of trick even the B.A.C.
could dig up. You watched friends
of students have someone's card
picked up and their whole week-end
ruined by the thought of what they
would say to the owner. By the
time you got into the stadium, you
saw half-time card stunts.
When you finally did get in you
