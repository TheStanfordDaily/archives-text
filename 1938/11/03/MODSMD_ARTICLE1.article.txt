# Farm To See Two Gaieties; Matinee Set
## Tickets Go on Sale At English Corner Booth This Morning 
### 
The whole Farm may see the
Gaieties after all.
Those persons who failed to
wriggle or even chisel their way as
far as the ticket booth last Tuesday
will be given a second chance this
morning at 9 o'clock when tickets
for a matinee performance go on
sale at the English Corner.
Dramatic Council late last night
decidcd that, as the Gaieties was
strictly a Stanford show and part of
the Big Game activities, every
Stanford student should be able to

attend. Seat shortage prohibiting
this in a single performance, it was
arranged that the whole Gaieties be
presented in a matinee to be given
the same afternoon, Friday, Novem
ber 18, at 2 o'clock. Prices will re
main the same.
Dramatics Council's plan for
eliminating troublesome scalpers
has so far proved highly success
ful. There has, as yet, been no evi
dence of complaints. This is in
marked contrast with last year's
ticket sale when IGOO seats went to
an estimated IiOO studentsâ€”and out
siders, bringing upon dramatics of
ficers a deluge of verbal and writ
ten abuse.
Scalpers last year were asking and
getting $5 a pair. As market for the
tciket hawkers was a waiting list of
over 100 persons who professed
willingness to pay "any price." This
year Dramatics Council makes the
prices $1.50, $1, and 50 cents.
Gaieties rehearsals are progressing
from a conglomeration to 10 top
notch original skits which will vie
for prominence as "the best part of
the show" with approximately 60
minutes of equally top-notch tunes.
To Director J. P. Cahn falls the task
of developing the talent and getting
the most in entertainment value out
of each number. Shirley Jones, long
a favorite of the Farm, is aiding and
abetting by directing dance routines
and song numbers. Gaieties hoofers
include Hugh Hinman, Kent Ghirar
delli, George Henshaw, Stan Fi
danque, Molly Moser, Flo Alden,
Barbara Thrasher, Shirley Jones,
and Margaret Paulson.
Tickets will also go on sale at
Keeble's in Palo Alto today; ticket
sale on the Quad will last until 5
o'clock.
