# Educator Opposes Labor Proposition
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
"It shall be unlawful for any person to utter to or within the hearing of
any other person . . . any . . . derogatory . . . words . . . with the
intent ... to influence any person ... to refrain from purchasing
merchandise . . .."
With such ambiguities the hackers of Proposition No. 1 — the so
called "Anti-Picketing Measure" — hope to tie the hands of organized

labor in California, according to
Professor William S. Hopkins, as
sistant professor of economics, who
has made a thorough study of the
subject.
BILL TOO STRINGENT
Pointing out that under this clause
—taken from Section 8 of the bill—
a casual shopper who publicly criti
cized a store's products would be
subject to fine and imprisonment,
Professor Hopkins characterized the
measure as "a discriminatory piece
of legislation designed to be used
when you want to 'get' someone."
"Under ordinary conditions," lie
said, "this particular section would
not be enforced; but supposing a
proprietor wished to break a strike
or a picket-line—the most innocent
of remarks could be construed as
'derogatory' if he so desired."
Slipping by, virtually unnoticed in
the campaign, the proposition is os
tensibly a device to regulate the
activities of labor unions in collec
tive action. In reality it is a device
to render their activities wholly in
effective," Professor Hopkins said.
FULL OF CONFUSION
"The basic difficulty with the bill
is that it is so full of confusions and
; inconsistencies. In a very large part
! this is due to the way in which it. has
i been presented—not as a bill thor
oughly debated in the legislature
and then sent to the people for their
'approval, but as a half-baked hodgc
{podge hastily thrown together with
i out benefit, of adequate study or
j understanding."
Commenting on sections of the bill
other than the restriction on speech,
Professor Hopkins pointed out spe
cifically the fallacy in the section
which abolishes sympathy strikes,
and restricts participants in a strike
!to those immediately employed by
the proprietor affected.
"This works very well," he said,
"except where you have constantly
shifting employment. In such cases
— longshore work, for instance — a
man may have ten different em
ployers in a week. What chance is
there for concerted strike action in
such a case? Sympathy strikes are
virtually imperative if any gains are
to be made."
Concluding Professor Hopkins re
iterated again the chief weaknesses
in the bill—its vagueness, its incon
sistency, its potential discriminatory
features.
"It's true that public reaction
against constant labor difficulties
gives it a strong chance for pas
sage," he said, "but if it does go
through, labor progress in the state
will be set back a good many years."
