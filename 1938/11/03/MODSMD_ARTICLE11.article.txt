# 'Ham and Eggs' Plan Opposed
## Danger of Inflation Seen by Economists 
### 
Condemned by the chairman of
Stanford's Department of Econom
ics, B. F. Haley, as well as by econ
omists in 16 other California colleges
and universities, the "Ham and
Eggs" pension plan continued yes
terday to gain the opposition of
authorities.
"If the scheme were to be adopted,
the warrants issued under its pro
visions probably would not be gen
erally acceptable beyond that early
period when the quantity of war
rants in circulation was still small,"
a statement signed by Professor Ha
ley in conjunction with the other
college authorities asserted.
The plan would pay $'H) a week
j for life to every California resident
! over 50 years old "without taking
j away, confiscating, or otherwise sub-
I trading from the economic status of
j any person or groups of persons,"
J according to the proposed amend-j
i ment.
i If the plan should be approved by
i the voters, the scheme, according to
the 17 economists, "would most ccr
tainly result in a rapid and cumu
! lalive inflation of prices which
j would result in a general decline in
i real incomes for others than pension
, recipients, and the destruction of the
effective taxing power of the state
. and its governmental units."
