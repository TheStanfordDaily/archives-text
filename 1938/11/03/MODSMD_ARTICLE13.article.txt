# Wreckers Begin On Boathouse
## Work on Boathouse To Start This Week 
### 
The Farm's 25-year-old boat
house will topple to the earth today.
A crew of wreckers will begin
work this morning, tearing down the
doomed structure to make it pos
sible for construction on the new
building to begin sometime this week,
it was learned last night from
James W. McDonnell, superintend
ent of buildings and grounds.
All canoes will be transferred to
day to the corporation yard for
storage until the new boathouse is
completed, McDonnell said.
"Canoe owners need not worry
about dragging their boats home
during the period of work," Mc-
Donnell added. "We'll store them in
a safe spot in the corp yard and
return (hem when the quarters arc
ready in January."
Meanwhile, Stanford's "boathouse
boys" yesterday packed their belong
ings, foresook the soon-to-be-razed
structure for a room in Palo Alto.
