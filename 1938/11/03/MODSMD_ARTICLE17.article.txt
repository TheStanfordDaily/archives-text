# Confidence Vote Given Chamberlain
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 2 (UP). — Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain late
tonight won a 345 to 138 vote of
confidcnce in the House of Commons
for his pact of friendship with Pre
mier Benito Mussolini after his
critics had mercilessly described him
as "the boneless wonder of the age."
The vote was in effect a go-ahead
signal for his four-power program
of dealing with the dictators.
As a result of the vote, the Anglo -
Italian pact initialed in Rome last
April 16 will be put into operation
immediately and Britain will recog
nize formally Italian sovereignly
over Ethiopia.
The vote of 345 to 138 compared
with one of 316 to 108 cast for
Chamberlain last May 2—five months
before Munich — when the original
terms of the Italian agreement were
approved.
Chamberlain asked support for
(he pact with Italy on the grounds
that "it must be regarded as a step
toward appeasement . . . improv
ing the prospects of peace as n
whole."
