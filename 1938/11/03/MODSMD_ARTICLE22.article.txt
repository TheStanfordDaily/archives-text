# Luncheon Club Hears Wilbur
## Democracy in Peril, Maintains President 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur
spoke on "Helping Democracy to !
Work in the Modern World" at j
yesterday's meeting of the Luncheon
Club.
"We are in the midst of a cam- |
paign that holds the interest of the j
American people because they are i
conscious of the difficulties in the j
operation of democracy," said Dr. '
Wilbur. "The main obstacle is the ;
fact that oniy a small percentage of I
the people are interested in the
country's problems."
VOTERS IGNORANT
"There are 25 laws to be voted i
upon in California at the present
time," he said. "A majority of votes I
is necessary to adopt these laws, !
but the small percentage who do j
vote do so usually without under- J
standing. The growth of communi
cation in recent years has made j
democracy a source of peril because
of the capacity of men to act as herds j
of animals and follow the leader."
Dr. Wilbur compared democracy's
problems to this year's football {
squad. Stanford's team has come up j
against obstacles and bad luck and i
has still continued to fight; democ- i
racy cannot always win, but the peo- ;
pie must get into problems to which
ignorance of function leads.
"Each generation should take care !
of its own problems and not leave j
its debts for the future. Burdens of'
I democracy lead to autocracy; bur
dens of autocracy lead to war."
YOUTH MUST ACT
"Democracy is , a government that
gives dignity and self-respect to men
and women," said Dr. Wilbur. "It is
a wonderful world, but it cannot be
| as it should without the interest of
j young and old and particularly the
| effort of the young to operate it for
| more than selfish advantages."
j Dr. Samuel Eliot of the Arlington
j Street Church in Boston will be
I next week's Luncheon Club speaker.
! Dr. Eliot is the son of the President
lof Harvard University.
