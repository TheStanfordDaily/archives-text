## Party Candidates To Be Represented By Four Students 
### 
To clarify the issues involved and
give students a non-partisan pic- j
ture of the current gubernatorial j
election race, a debate in which the (
points in the Republican and Demo
cratic platforms will be discussed
will be heard at 8 o'clock tonight in ,
Room 100 of the old Little Theater, j
"We feel that knowledge of the |
platforms presented by the candi- j
dates in this year's governmental 1
election is important to intelligent
voting and should interest Stanford '
students," said Professor Leland T. j
Chapin, associate professor of speech j
and drama, and coach of the debate \
squad.
The resolution for tonight's debate j
will be "Resolved, that the Republi- j
can ticket should be re-elected."
Four members of the varsity de- i
bate squad will participate in the
debate. Speakers for Frank F. Mer- j
riam, incumbent Republican, will be j
Tim Hays and John Moskovicz, j
while Culbert L. Olson, Democratic j
candidate, will be represented by j
Carl Deisenroth and Sherman Mel- !
linkoff. Debate Council and the i
Stanford Young Democrats are spon- !
sors of the debate. Dr. Robert E. j
Swain, who has been acting Presi- I
dent of the University in the past,
will preside.
Stressing the non-partisan nature
of the debate, Professor Chapin an
nounced there would be a straw poll
taken before and after the debate to
determine the political affiliations of
the audience. The vote following the
election is expected to reveal how
many have changed their affiliations
after hearing the debate, he ex
plained.
"Traditional for a great many
years," said Professor Chapin, "these
| debates have proved very popular in
J the past. The public is cordially in
| vited to attend the debate tonight."
Preceding the debate at 7 o'clock
i will be a caucus of the Young Demo
| erats in a room adjoining the Little
! Theater, Robert Peckham, chairman
J of the group, announced. *
