# Starting Line For Saturday Still in Doubt
## Battered Northmen Anxious To Avenge Six Straight Losses 
### 
By ARCH JENKINS
A good way to lose money this
week is to bet on what starting
lineup Tiny Thornhill will use in the
Washington game Saturday.
Pete Zagar,"who is just about the
last ol' a line of men who opened the
season in top berths, is the latest
casualty, although he may worm his
way upward again before the Husky
tilt. Thornhill has been running By
West at Zagar's first string left
tackle position for two nights and
might open with him.
ZAGAR A PUZZLE
Zagar's play this season has been
a puzzle to everyone interested in
the Big lied Machine. Sometimes
he puts on an All-American exhi
bition, while at others the opposition
shoves him around like a high
school freshman.
West, while not so spectacular as
Zagar, plays consistently well at the
tackle spot.
Thornhill put the first two strings
through a long scrimmage last night
with possession of the ball alternat
ing between them. Bill Paulman was
on the sidelines as a precaution,
while Jack Brenner, who could start
at three out of four backfield posts,
was laid up with a slightly twisted
ankle. Both of these backs, how
ever, may start Saturday.
FIRST TEAM LINEUP
The first team line had Willard
and Stojkovieh at end, West and An
dersen at tackle, Pool and Donahue
at guard, and Calvelli at center. In
the backfield were Ledeboer, Stand
lee, Coldiron, and Alustiza, although
the last two mentioned are not likely
starters.
The line charge of both squads was
greatly improved, but the second
string backfield seemed more able
to penetrate on the ground, with Rod
Parker and Thor Peterson doing well
inside the ends. Zagar and Braheny
in the second string line were stop
ping plays cold with fair regularity.
HUSKIES SORE
Jimmy Phelan is finding himself
in just about the same spot in which
Bill Spaulding, U.C.L.A. mentor, was
last Saturday. It was Homecoming
Week-end at Westwuod, Spaulding's
last crack at Stanford, and, what's
more, the Bruin coach was at a fam
ily funeral in the Middle West. The
Uclans just had to win for "Ole Bill."
Phelan's luck in the Sta
dium has always been bad, and he
has already lost six games in a row
this season. Word from way up
north is to the effect that his squad
is determined to make the Indians
pay for everything bad that has hap
pened to their coach in the last two
years. Psychologically Stanford has
not a chance.
