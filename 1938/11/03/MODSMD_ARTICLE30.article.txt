# Paposes Drill For 'Little Big Game'
## 
### 
While California's Golden Cub
goes silently and methodically about
its way preparing for the onslaught
Saturday by a tribe of Papooses off
Stanford's spacious Farm. Coach
Harry Shipkey continues glumly to
lead his gridders through their drills,
fearful that every contact will add
injuries to an already depleted ball
club.
Yesterday Shipkey sent his team
through offensive aerial drills, in a
final attempt to polish off a depart
ment in which the Cards have
stalled all season. Tuesday he put
them through ground practice in
order to add finesse to a running at
tack that has been far from suc
cessful this season.
Loss of Jim Murphy, second-string
left end, for this final game caused
Shipkey to switch Ed Wilson from
the right flank to back up Burt Tal
cott, while Bill Glundberg moves up
from the third team to be Fred Mey
er's chief replacement at right end.
The guard positions are the most
heaviiy hit by injuries. Yank Levin,
Bob Heringer and Bob Crane limp
ing around at present with knoeked
up legs.
One infant under a year of age
dies from an unavoidable accident
on an average of every four hours in
the United States.
