### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
will be flying a week from
tonight. Harry Maloney, minor
sports'head, and Clayton Frye, var
sity boxing coach, are completing ar
rangements for one of the most pop
ular athletic events of the year, Cir
cle S Society's annual novice box
ing tournament.
And it won't just be boxing, be
cause Frye has invited fencers and
gymnasts to do their stuff between
bouts to add variety to the evening's
entertainment.
Coach Ken Edwards will bring a
skilled group of muscle men who
will work out on the parallel bars
and mats. It will be Stanford's first
chance to see the gym team in
action.
Elwyn Bugge's varsity fencers,
who started out their season by de-

feating the Gold
en Bear saber
men last Friday,
will be on hand
for some lively
fencing and
broadsword con
tests..
While the first

plan was to admit women free to
the bouts, it has been decided since
that. members of the weaker sex
will have to fork over two-bits
along with everybody else if they
want to cheer their Kid Gallahads
and see athletes in three minor
sports in action.
And as though it won't be enter
tainment enough, you'll be contrib
uting to charity through the Circle
S Society. Dub Saunders, president,
announced that proceeds will go
toward a scholarship for a minor
sports athlete.
So it will be good entertainment
for a good cause, and it's time to
be making plans to be on hand
when the starting bell rings in the
Pavilion next Thursday.

JJUMOR has it that The Daily is
partial to water polo in its
sports publicity. Probably so, but
what other team at Stanford has
brought students more entertain

[ ment and has brought home more
I bacon in the way of victories this
j fall?
Water polo is the fastest, rough
\ est, most exciting game in season
j at Stanford, and a team deserves
a plug when it can invite a high
ly-touted group of Trojan swim
mers up here and send them home
{ on the short end of the score.
San Jose State College gave the
| Cards more competition than ever

before in the first
game of the series
this fall, and the
Spartans are ex
pected to be in
top form this af
ternoon when they
3t r y again to
drown the Indians

this afternoon in the Encina Pools.
Today's struggle may end in a
close score, but the odds are well
on the Cardinal side.

pAPOOSE gridders are getting the
Little Red Machine in shape this
week for a siege against the Cal
lrosh. And the game will tel) the
tale of the "Big Four" freshman
grid conference.
It is unfortunate for Stanford
rooters that the game will be play
ed in Berkeley instead of in the
Stanford stadium preliminary to the
Washington game, because it will be
real football entertainment.
The Bear frosh have suddenly dis
covered they are a passing threat,
and reports have it that they will
take their offense into the air every
chance they get.
Stanford yearlings have used a
great many passes in running up the
high scores that have made them
decisive victors in every game they
have played.
It should be a cinch win for the
Papooses Saturday, but a good game
that we'll hate to miss.
If a pedestrian walking at night
shows a white handkerchief, visi
bility for motorists is increased 50
per cent.
