# Farm Ice Hockey May Be Revived
## 
### 
Ice hockey, a sport that died at
Stanford a few years ago, may re- j
turn to the Stanford campus. Be- !
fore any definite steps can be taken
with the campus athletic organiza- J
tions, it is desired ETAONIETEE
concerning hockey material at
Stanford be known.
Any Stanford students who have ;
had any ice hockey .experience of
any form are requested to get in j

touch with the sports department of
The Daily.
If a large enough group shows in
terest in this project hopes are held
of developing a hockey squad,
which will do most of its practicing
and playing on the large ice rinks
in the vicinity.
About 93 per cent of the popula
tion of Finland over 15 years of age
is literate.
