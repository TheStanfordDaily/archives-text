# Straws in the Wind
## 
### 
THIS morning the Farm gets a chance to
prove that it is alive to the Issues, that it is
aware of What Goes On. This morning the
Farm has a chance to vote on California's state
election.
Elsewhere in The Daily, Pi Sigma Alpha,
national political science fraternity, has printed
its traditional straw-ballot, results of which bi
ennially indicate the trend of Farm thought in
regard to state and national questions.
Going on the basis of past performance, the
record this time ought to be moderately left of
center. Partly because it sincerely feels that
way, and partly because it thinks it is annoy
ing the Administration, the Farm since 1936 has
grown consistently fonder of Roosevelt, labor,
and anything which can lay even the slightest
claim to the magic adjective "liberal."
For this reason Stanford's straw-vote will
probably send Downey to the Senate and Olson
to Sacramento; it will probably defeat the Thirty
Thursday, uphold Anti-Picketing, kill the Pound
Act and the Single Tax. Probably, also, it will
come reasonably close to the actual results in
state-wide balloting Tuesday.
If the Farm does go somewhat left, and
California does follow suit, the next four years
should be an interesting time for the Golden
State.
Liberalism is a healthy quality in a govern
ment, and rarely does much to destroy its basic
fabric. California might do worse than give it
a try for four years; if it did nothing else, it
would rid the state of a few of its mental cob
webs.â€”A. S. D.
