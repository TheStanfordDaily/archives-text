SO, after turning financiers for the Boathouse
Crisis, Ex Committee is about to change its
costume and turn philosopher to decide the
ethics of transference or non-transference of
student body cards.
When it sits down to muse, it will remember
past history, when custom has dictated that
cards shall be held by "the owner only; the
custom has been shaken periodically by the
same kind of storm that is raging now after
Saturday's validation Bacchanal. Obviously,
the principle is based on something more than
pure fancy, but so far, no one has quite put
his finger on any good reason for or against
non-transferability.
Perhaps there aren't any.
But again, the social theory that individual
rights must be protected by the whole enters
into the picture. Perhaps it isn't true that, with
transferability, the rooters' stands would be shot
full of grandfathers, still backing the team of
'97. Still, however, an all-Stanford crowd is a
desirable end in any case.
At the same time, proponents of transfer
ability, hot from the U.C.L.A. fracas, insist that
after purchase, a student body card belongs to
the individual, that he may do exactly what he
sees fit with it. If, upon occasion, he finds no
particular use for it while, figuratively, others
starve, logic might dictate a free exchange of
privilege.
Stanford bases its whole code on individual
responsibility, and for consistency's sake, it
might seem that transferability was inevitable.
And in between the two schools of thought
are the compromise boys who urge the rule of
non-transferability with lenient enforcement.
They deserve least consideration on the mat
ter. It is exactly because this break between
rule and enforcement has existed that A1 Mas
ters. has asked Ex Committee for some final
statement.
Whatever Ex Committee decides will, right
at this time, meet with kick-backs from the
student body; those in favor of non-transference
will call any other condition an infringement
upon individual rights. Those knifed Saturday
will be satisfied with no less than transference
and free lunch on the English Corner.
But whatever the decision, let it be firm, clear
cut, and final.
Like A1 Masters, Stanford is sick of compro
mise.
