# Policy Dance Racket
## 
### 
JOLTED by the report that only 42 couples
turned out to Cardinals' campus dance last
Saturday, Ex Committee Tuesday night sent
up a smoke screen of discussion in an attempt
to pin down dance policy in the future. When
the fumes cleared, the policy of the past rode
out, practically unscathed: the policy of putting
on a campus dance whenever the time seems
ripe for it.
It took a little while to see that last Saturday's
dance was not necessarily direct refutation of
the idea that Stanford did want campus dances

and needed them. It was simply that Ex Com
mittee guessed wrong on this one, took a con
sequent financial loss.
The incident however adds a few more guide
points to gauge ripe dance times. The tiny turn
out Saturday might be considered a direct out
come of the attendant circumstance of a game
away: that those who attend campus dances are
also those who (a) support the team best, (b)
have money enough to trip southward, (c) go
home when there is no football game, (d) study
when there is no football game.
But it would be unwise to explain the failure
of the dance by this one circumstance only.
There may have been a dozen other factors in
force, none of which are isolated or obvious
enough to tab with an accusing finger.
And at any rate, the policy of guessing still
holds. Stanford will still have its campus
dances, when it definitely indicates that it will
support them.
That is, when Ex Committee is feeling clair
voyant.
