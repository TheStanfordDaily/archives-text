liONI SOIT QUI MAL . . .
COMMITTEE blushed becomingly last Tuesday
night when it stumbled over the question of night
parking around the campus. The committee admitted
warily that it "understood" that campus officers had
instructions to make parked couples move on, but it
stalked the subject with nervous caution, like a small
child making advances to a strange dog. Opinions were
phrased with diplomatic reserve, and double meanings
were subjected to a relentless purge. But in spite of
hesitancy and crawfishing, it appeared that the com
mittee thought parked couples could take care of
themselves very nicely without interference by the
cops.
It is not my intention to roar, "Damn the torpedoes,"
and steam ahead where Ex Committee held back. I
have no car, and so my interest in night parking is
purely an academic one. If Ex Committee thought the
subject too delicate for direct attack, it would be
foolish for me to pile into it, when I have if any
thing less information than the committee. It is pos
sible, though, to look over some of the arguments that
have been brought up already.
* # * *
The authorities tell us that after-dark parking on
campus is prohibited because it increases the dan
ger of robberies, and because the wilderness of the
cactus garden would provide a safe place to strip
stolen cars. They also hint in a this-generation-is
going-to-the-dogs tone of voice that Paly High stu
dents would try to capitalize on the romantic campus
atmosphere.
But somehow these arguments don't carry the sin
cerity and conviction that are essential to a great
Cause. They rather remind me of the reasoning a
Victorian parent gives when he informs his children
that they must be in by 10 o'clock, because they "need
the sleep."
* * At *
couples do park, we may assume that couples
often have a reason for wanting to park. Perhaps
they would like to talk philosophy, or save gas, or
emphasize their conversation with gestures. And in
this generation that believes in getting things done, it
is also safe to assume that if they want to park, they
will.
The bulldog vigilance of the campus cops shows
that parking on the campus would be safer than park
ing in the hills behind the Farm. And so the danger
of robbery theories vanishes in a puff of .smoke. Simi
larly, it is hard to believe that the campus police
would not be able to work up a reasonable suspicion
if they saw a car being stripped.

And so it appears that there is no reason why night
parking should be prohibited. Therefore, we conclude
that it should be permitted.
Possibly the University has a sneaking suspicion
that its step-children would use the parking privilege
to engage in activities not listed in the Frosh Bible.
If so, it can trot out its arguments, and let us discuss
them without, confusion. But it is annoying to think
that dear alma mater is trying to regulate the stu
dents through a ricocheting traffic rule.
After all, we are old enough to face the facts now.
And Stanford plays Machiavelli very badly.
