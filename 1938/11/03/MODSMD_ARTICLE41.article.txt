### DOUG JAQUES 
A s A WHOLE, I'm not made of wood, but there's
one gal going to this school whom I wouldn't want
to meet, because maybe she doesn't know I'm not made
of wood. She's a wood picker.
Last, year she lived in Roble. You could almost say
she chisclcd her way through Roble. With her finger
nails.
Wood to her is iust something to be scratched at.
And she doesn't just take an idle swoop at something
with her fingernails, and then let it go. She keeps at it
until she has anything from a deep scratch to a shallow
hole.
When she left Roble, her scratch bill was ten dol
lars. She picked a whole the size of. a silver dollar
and-a-half and eight, times as deep in the arm of her
chair; the woodwork and even the door-jam in her
room were carefully grooved; everything, in short,
but the bed was scratched up. The ix>d was made of
iron. And down the hall, they had to put in a new
phone booth after she left. She had spent several
hours in there.
She goes to all the football games, and from what I
hear she has been working on the stadium this year.

A female friend of mine who can on occasion be a
wag had an occasion last Friday night when she went
down on the train to U.C.L.A. She was standing in a
little corridor just, off the dancing car. Several other
people were, too, because it was a dark, cosy corri
dor. In fact, it was this darkness and cosiness which
brought the somewhat worried conductor into it primly
carrying a light globe. Which he screwed into the empty
fixture and turned on.
That was my friend's occasion. "Don't you have a
brighter light than that?" she asked him.
The conductor looked at the five-and-a-half couples
standing in the corridor glaring at him. and then at my
friend. "What! A brighter Light?" he was amazed.
"Yes. You can't read in a light like that."
"Head! Read!"
"No. you can't read in a light like this."
"You mean you want to read in here?" He was try
ing awfully hard to get control of himself again. He
had had a nastv shock.
"Of course."
The conductor left, shaking his head, to look for a
brighter light.
