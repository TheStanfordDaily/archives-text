# Puccini Opera Well Sung By Smooth Cast
## 
### 
"MY DEAR." said the much he
feathered dowager, "I could listen
to La Boheme if no one sang it."
Monday night's performance of
"La Boheme" reminded me of that
remark, overheard in a between
acts promenade of a former season.
I don't mean that it was as though
no one sang it, but each voice blend-

Ed so perfectly
into the whole
that the perform
ance went on
without a varia
tion in its general
effect on the au
dience.
The opera was
actually an opera,
and not a concert
vehicle for some

great star. There were no famous
and high-salaried names in the cast,
and the audience was spared the
nuisance of having to wait for a
great singer's entrance, exit, or aria.
Monday's performance was a new
experiment in the San Francisco
opera field, and thoroughly success
ful. It was the kind of ensemble
performance that critics and the pub
lic have been howling about for
years and all too rarely getting.
Not that the singing was not the
best, by no means. Mafaldo Favero
had her best part of the season as
Mimi. She was unquestionably the
finest Mimi in recent years as far as
her acting was concerned, and her
full, rich. Grace-Mooreish voice was
gloriously true both to Puccini's
music and its sentiment.
Galliano Massini as Rudolfo gave
a magnificent demonstration of ro
bust tenor tone, and acted as con
vincingly as any tenor can be ex
pected to act. Carlo Tagliabue in the
part of Marcello was splendid in the
over-coat aria in the fourth act.
Norman Gordon justified his rise
from small to bigger parts as Col
line, and George Cahanovsky was
an amusing Schaunard.
Anne Jamison, of "Show Boat"
fame, was fickle as the fickle Mu
setta, although a little over-enthus
iastic in the waltz song. Louis D'An
gelo and Lucovico Oliviera com
pleted the cast as Alcindoro and
Benoit, the importunate landlord.
The chorus deserves several or
chids for its work also, as does Ar
mando Agnini for his superb Paris
street cafe set in the second act.

"MY DEAR." said the much he
feathered dowager, "I could listen
to La Boheme if no one sang it."
Monday night's performance of
"La Boheme" reminded me of that
remark, overheard in a between
acts promenade of a former season.
I don't mean that it was as though
no one sang it, but each voice blend-

Ed so perfectly
into the whole
that the perform
ance went on
without a varia
tion in its general
effect on the au
dience.
The opera was
actually an opera,
and not a concert
vehicle for some

great star. There were no famous
and high-salaried names in the cast,
and the audience was spared the
nuisance of having to wait for a
great singer's entrance, exit, or aria.
Monday's performance was a new
experiment in the San Francisco
opera field, and thoroughly success
ful. It was the kind of ensemble
performance that critics and the pub
lic have been howling about for
years and all too rarely getting.
Not that the singing was not the
best, by no means. Mafaldo Favero
had her best part of the season as
Mimi. She was unquestionably the
finest Mimi in recent years as far as
her acting was concerned, and her
full, rich. Grace-Mooreish voice was
gloriously true both to Puccini's
music and its sentiment.
Galliano Massini as Rudolfo gave
a magnificent demonstration of ro
bust tenor tone, and acted as con
vincingly as any tenor can be ex
pected to act. Carlo Tagliabue in the
part of Marcello was splendid in the
over-coat aria in the fourth act.
Norman Gordon justified his rise
from small to bigger parts as Col
line, and George Cahanovsky was
an amusing Schaunard.
Anne Jamison, of "Show Boat"
fame, was fickle as the fickle Mu
setta, although a little over-enthus
iastic in the waltz song. Louis D'An
gelo and Lucovico Oliviera com
pleted the cast as Alcindoro and
Benoit, the importunate landlord.
The chorus deserves several or
chids for its work also, as does Ar
mando Agnini for his superb Paris
street cafe set in the second act.
