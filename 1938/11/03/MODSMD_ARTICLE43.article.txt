# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I, too, am suspicious. The B.A.C.
was "suspicious" that something
fishy was going on when so many
student rooter tickets were called
for prior to the game. But I am
"suspicious" that there is something
fishy in the B.A.C. set-up. I reach
ed this conclusion after pondering
over the fact that the B.A.C. consid
ers it wrong to scalp tickets or to
loan student body cards.
I was unable to get my ticket to
the U.C.L.A. game when the B.A.C.
magnanimously gave them out up
here, so I called at the validation
booth at the Coliseum with my own
student body card to see if I might
obtain one. I was informed that
several rooter's tickets had been
turned in but that it would cost me
$2.50 to get one, and that ANYONE
COULD PURCHASE THE ROOT
ER'S TICKETS AT THE SAME
PRICE! Obviously the B.A.C. is not
interested in who sits io the root
ers' section but only in the total
take for the game.
I can't see why students should be
charged anything for any of the ath
letic contests in which the students
participate, regardless of the ar
rangements the B.A.C. has made with
other colleges. With all the money
that is taken in on football games it
seems illogical that students should
be chai'ged to see their own teams
play. And now the $2 punishment
fine! I wonder who gets this and for
what it will be spent.
When the B.A.C. itself will "scalp"
free rooters' tickets to Stanford
students OR THE GENERAL PUB
LIC at $2.50 a throw, it seems that
the mere loaning of student body
cards is a minor offense.
Plenty sore

The Editor, Sir:
I very seldom write "crank let
ters" because when I do raise my
self to the occasion I get so mad that
I'm liable to say anything that pops
into my head. I've counted up to
ten, however, so I think that it's
safe to go on.
First, I didn't get in the game last
Saturday until the middle of the
second quarter because of those
guys that were giving us all the
third degree as to our identification.
I personally think that the reason
given for not lending student body
cards is a weak one and that it is
the student's own business what he
does wtih his own Card. But this is
beside the point.
My suggestion is this: Why not
have an identification of the student
on the card itself? Also a small pic
ture of the student to complete the
identity. I think that this would
solve the problem of identification
once and for all.

The Editor, Sir:
B.A.C.'s action on Saturday caused
a great deal of indignant comment.
The reason stated was that illegal
users of student body cards would
n't know Stanford's songs and yells.
Perhaps not, but they could learn
them as fast as they were given.
And whether or not they did, the
additions to the rooters' section
would bolster the confidence of the
tram. This part of Saturday's affair
was mildly amusing, and I really
didn't mind the principle of the
ticket validations because I have

never loaned my student body card,
and I never expect to, though it was
rather a blow to our cherished
Honor Code. What made me want
to throw little sticks of dynamite and
call the B.A.C. nasty names was the
fact that I had to stand in line for
an hour before the game and all
during the first quarter just so some
idiot in a cage could ask me if I
were the person whose name appear
ed on the card. If the B.A.C. wants
to eliminate illegal usage of cards, it
will have to try some other method
because everyone who was in that
line knows that many people were
able to get in who had no right to;
for instance:
CASE CITED
A young fellow behind me, wear
ing a borrowed rooter's cap, was
asked if he had received his refund.
"Yes," he answered, taking a shot
in the dark.
"How much?" was the next ques
tion.
"Two and a quarter," the Angeleno
replied.
He got in.
But there were several students
who, after driving all the way down
to L.A., were refused admission on
their own cards because they failed
to remember on short notice what
their Bawl-out. average was. In
general, the long wait in line only
made for an angry and disgusted
rooters' section who came in with so
little remaining interest in the game
that they couldn't give the necessary
backing to the team. And they re
turned to the Farm with the wish
that they had stayed at home and
studied for mid-quarters as good
children should. If there is another
occurrence such as Saturday's, our
team may be looking at a sadly
depleted rooters' section.

rangements the B.A.C. has made with
other colleges. With all the money
that is taken in on football games it
seems illogical that students should
be chai'ged to see their own teams
play. And now the $2 punishment
fine! I wonder who gets this and for
what it will be spent.
When the B.A.C. itself will "scalp"
free rooters' tickets to Stanford
students OR THE GENERAL PUB
LIC at $2.50 a throw, it seems that
the mere loaning of student body
cards is a minor offense.
Plenty sore

The Editor, Sir:
I very seldom write "crank let
ters" because when I do raise my
self to the occasion I get so mad that
I'm liable to say anything that pops
into my head. I've counted up to
ten, however, so I think that it's
safe to go on.
First, I didn't get in the game last
Saturday until the middle of the
second quarter because of those
guys that were giving us all the
third degree as to our identification.
I personally think that the reason
given for not lending student body
cards is a weak one and that it is
the student's own business what he
does wtih his own Card. But this is
beside the point.
My suggestion is this: Why not
have an identification of the student
on the card itself? Also a small pic
ture of the student to complete the
identity. I think that this would
solve the problem of identification
once and for all.

The Editor, Sir:
B.A.C.'s action on Saturday caused
a great deal of indignant comment.
The reason stated was that illegal
users of student body cards would
n't know Stanford's songs and yells.
Perhaps not, but they could learn
them as fast as they were given.
And whether or not they did, the
additions to the rooters' section
would bolster the confidence of the
tram. This part of Saturday's affair
was mildly amusing, and I really
didn't mind the principle of the
ticket validations because I have

never loaned my student body card,
and I never expect to, though it was
rather a blow to our cherished
Honor Code. What made me want
to throw little sticks of dynamite and
call the B.A.C. nasty names was the
fact that I had to stand in line for
an hour before the game and all
during the first quarter just so some
idiot in a cage could ask me if I
were the person whose name appear
ed on the card. If the B.A.C. wants
to eliminate illegal usage of cards, it
will have to try some other method
because everyone who was in that
line knows that many people were
able to get in who had no right to;
for instance:
CASE CITED
A young fellow behind me, wear
ing a borrowed rooter's cap, was
asked if he had received his refund.
"Yes," he answered, taking a shot
in the dark.
"How much?" was the next ques
tion.
"Two and a quarter," the Angeleno
replied.
He got in.
But there were several students
who, after driving all the way down
to L.A., were refused admission on
their own cards because they failed
to remember on short notice what
their Bawl-out. average was. In
general, the long wait in line only
made for an angry and disgusted
rooters' section who came in with so
little remaining interest in the game
that they couldn't give the necessary
backing to the team. And they re
turned to the Farm with the wish
that they had stayed at home and
studied for mid-quarters as good
children should. If there is another
occurrence such as Saturday's, our
team may be looking at a sadly
depleted rooters' section.
Wondering
The Editor, Sir:
I, too, am suspicious. The B.A.C.
was "suspicious" that something
fishy was going on when so many
student rooter tickets were called
for prior to the game. But I am
"suspicious" that there is something
fishy in the B.A.C. set-up. I reach
ed this conclusion after pondering
over the fact that the B.A.C. consid
ers it wrong to scalp tickets or to
loan student body cards.
I was unable to get my ticket to
the U.C.L.A. game when the B.A.C.
magnanimously gave them out up
here, so I called at the validation
booth at the Coliseum with my own
student body card to see if I might
obtain one. I was informed that
several rooter's tickets had been
turned in but that it would cost me
$2.50 to get one, and that ANYONE
COULD PURCHASE THE ROOT
ER'S TICKETS AT THE SAME
PRICE! Obviously the B.A.C. is not
interested in who sits io the root
ers' section but only in the total
take for the game.
I can't see why students should be
charged anything for any of the ath
letic contests in which the students
participate, regardless of the ar
rangements the B.A.C. has made with
other colleges. With all the money
that is taken in on football games it

My suggestion is this: Why not
have an identification of the student
on the card itself? Also a small pic
ture of the student to complete the
identity. I think that this would
solve the problem of identification
once and for all.

The Editor, Sir:
B.A.C.'s action on Saturday caused
a great deal of indignant comment.
The reason stated was that illegal
users of student body cards would
n't know Stanford's songs and yells.
Perhaps not, but they could learn
them as fast as they were given.
And whether or not they did, the
additions to the rooters' section
would bolster the confidence of the
tram. This part of Saturday's affair
was mildly amusing, and I really
didn't mind the principle of the
ticket validations because I have

never loaned my student body card,
and I never expect to, though it was
rather a blow to our cherished
Honor Code. What made me want
to throw little sticks of dynamite and
call the B.A.C. nasty names was the
fact that I had to stand in line for
an hour before the game and all
during the first quarter just so some
idiot in a cage could ask me if I
were the person whose name appear
ed on the card. If the B.A.C. wants
to eliminate illegal usage of cards, it
will have to try some other method
because everyone who was in that
line knows that many people were
able to get in who had no right to;
for instance:
CASE CITED
A young fellow behind me, wear
ing a borrowed rooter's cap, was
asked if he had received his refund.
"Yes," he answered, taking a shot
in the dark.
"How much?" was the next ques
tion.
"Two and a quarter," the Angeleno
replied.
He got in.
But there were several students
who, after driving all the way down
to L.A., were refused admission on
their own cards because they failed
to remember on short notice what
their Bawl-out. average was. In
general, the long wait in line only
made for an angry and disgusted
rooters' section who came in with so
little remaining interest in the game
that they couldn't give the necessary
backing to the team. And they re
turned to the Farm with the wish
that they had stayed at home and
studied for mid-quarters as good
children should. If there is another
occurrence such as Saturday's, our
team may be looking at a sadly
depleted rooters' section.
Wondering
The Editor, Sir:
I, too, am suspicious. The B.A.C.
was "suspicious" that something
fishy was going on when so many
student rooter tickets were called
for prior to the game. But I am
"suspicious" that there is something
fishy in the B.A.C. set-up. I reach
ed this conclusion after pondering
over the fact that the B.A.C. consid
ers it wrong to scalp tickets or to
loan student body cards.
I was unable to get my ticket to
the U.C.L.A. game when the B.A.C.
magnanimously gave them out up
here, so I called at the validation
booth at the Coliseum with my own
student body card to see if I might
obtain one. I was informed that
several rooter's tickets had been
turned in but that it would cost me
$2.50 to get one, and that ANYONE
COULD PURCHASE THE ROOT
ER'S TICKETS AT THE SAME
PRICE! Obviously the B.A.C. is not
interested in who sits io the root
ers' section but only in the total
take for the game.
I can't see why students should be
charged anything for any of the ath
letic contests in which the students
participate, regardless of the ar
rangements the B.A.C. has made with
other colleges. With all the money
that is taken in on football games it
seems illogical that students should
be chai'ged to see their own teams
play. And now the $2 punishment
fine! I wonder who gets this and for
what it will be spent.
When the B.A.C. itself will "scalp"
free rooters' tickets to Stanford
students OR THE GENERAL PUB
LIC at $2.50 a throw, it seems that
the mere loaning of student body
cards is a minor offense.
Plenty sore

The Editor, Sir:
I very seldom write "crank let
ters" because when I do raise my
self to the occasion I get so mad that
I'm liable to say anything that pops
into my head. I've counted up to
ten, however, so I think that it's
safe to go on.
First, I didn't get in the game last
Saturday until the middle of the
second quarter because of those
guys that were giving us all the
third degree as to our identification.
I personally think that the reason
given for not lending student body
cards is a weak one and that it is
the student's own business what he
does wtih his own Card. But this is
beside the point.
My suggestion is this: Why not
have an identification of the student
on the card itself? Also a small pic
ture of the student to complete the
