# Cardinals Plan 'Most Gigantic' Big Game Rally
## 
### 
A tremendous parade before the !
Big Game rally and a "biggcr-than- j
ever" bonfire was the good word i
dispetised at a discussion of Big
Game activities at the regular meet
ing of Cardinals last night in the
Old Union.
A lenglhy parade down the row
on the Thursday evening before the
Cal game will start Big Game cele
brations. Every fraternity, sorority,
and hall is to enter floats in the
parade and prizes donated by local
business firms will be awarded to
the most original entry in every
division. Two steam rollers have
already been lined up to "chug on
down" in the march. All parade en
tries are to be turned in to Didi
Vibert, women's chairman of Rally
Committee.
Immediately following the parade
Cardinals have slated a rally to be
held in the Pavilion. Doodles Weav
er, ex-campus comic man, has defi
nitely consented to appear on the
roster of prominent speakers.
Doodles will lead the singing of
"Nuts to Cal" and other Weaver spe
cialties. According to Lomax Turner,
yell king, several new Stanford songs
will be sung at the rally. Included
will be three of the nicer verses to
"Son of a Gambolier," which Dean
Mary Yost and Dean John Bunn
have approved.
"The Big Game Bonfire is going
to be more gigantic than ever this
year, despite the fact that it is to
be built in one day." This was the
verdict rendered last night by Clint
Olsen, chairman of the Bonfire
Committee.
"Twice as many trucks as used
last year have been rounded up to
haul burnable material for the fire,"
Olsen said. In previous years two
days were used in building the pyre
but it was cut down this year to
eliminate any over-exuberance at
Roble.
Although the orchestra for the Big
Game Jolly-up, which is to be held
following the matinee performance
of the Gaieties, has not been chosen,
bids have been received from sev
ral Big Name bands and Cardinals
will choose one from the list at the
next meeting, according to Roy
Thompson, president of Cardinals.

Bentonite, which has compara
tively recently come into use in toilet
soap and cleansing clay, is used in
Arabia by the native women.

A tremendous parade before the !
Big Game rally and a "biggcr-than- j
ever" bonfire was the good word i
dispetised at a discussion of Big
Game activities at the regular meet
ing of Cardinals last night in the
Old Union.
A lenglhy parade down the row
on the Thursday evening before the
Cal game will start Big Game cele
brations. Every fraternity, sorority,
and hall is to enter floats in the
parade and prizes donated by local
business firms will be awarded to
the most original entry in every
division. Two steam rollers have
already been lined up to "chug on
down" in the march. All parade en
tries are to be turned in to Didi
Vibert, women's chairman of Rally
Committee.
Immediately following the parade
Cardinals have slated a rally to be
held in the Pavilion. Doodles Weav
er, ex-campus comic man, has defi
nitely consented to appear on the
roster of prominent speakers.
Doodles will lead the singing of
"Nuts to Cal" and other Weaver spe
cialties. According to Lomax Turner,
yell king, several new Stanford songs
will be sung at the rally. Included
will be three of the nicer verses to
"Son of a Gambolier," which Dean
Mary Yost and Dean John Bunn
have approved.
"The Big Game Bonfire is going
to be more gigantic than ever this
year, despite the fact that it is to
be built in one day." This was the
verdict rendered last night by Clint
Olsen, chairman of the Bonfire
Committee.
"Twice as many trucks as used
last year have been rounded up to
haul burnable material for the fire,"
Olsen said. In previous years two
days were used in building the pyre
but it was cut down this year to
eliminate any over-exuberance at
Roble.
Although the orchestra for the Big
Game Jolly-up, which is to be held
following the matinee performance
of the Gaieties, has not been chosen,
bids have been received from sev
ral Big Name bands and Cardinals
will choose one from the list at the
next meeting, according to Roy
Thompson, president of Cardinals.

tively recently come into use in toilet
soap and cleansing clay, is used in
Arabia by the native women.
