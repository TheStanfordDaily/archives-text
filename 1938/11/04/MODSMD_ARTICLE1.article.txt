# Odds Favor Husky Win Over Indians
## New Mental Attitude Enhances Cardinal Victory Tomorrow 
### ARCH JENKINS 
You wouldn't believe it to look
at the odds, but the Stanford In
dians are in better mental condition
for the Washington game tomorrow
than they have been all season.
Physically, Tiny Thornhill's ag
gregation looks like the aftermath
of a gang fight. But if the Husky
battle depends on spirit and sheer
determination, then a small wager
on the Cardinals won't be amiss.

Special report from the B.A.C.
says that the Washington game
tomorrow will begin at 2 o'clock
instead of the usual time of 2:30.

The bookies hereabouts will give
as high as 2 to 1 that the oft-beaten
dogs of Jimmy Phelan will come
up with a win. The Huskies were
positively graceful in losing to Cali
fornia by a touchdown. They were
positively lousy in losing to Minne
sota, Oregon State, Southern Cali
fornia, and tying little Idaho.
PLAYED FAIR FOOTBALL
Except for the Santa Clara side
show, Stanford has played a fail
type of ball considering her many
injuries. Two conference wins and
two losses without Paulman and
Fay isn't exactly pitiful.
Paulman will bless the squad and
Thornhill with his presence in the
starting lineup tomorrow, although
Thornhill didn't consider him in
good enough shape to scrimmage
Wednesday afternoon. Jack Bren
ner, a two-legged jack rabbit if there
ever was one, is slated to start at
right half with a charley horse.
Fred Ledeboer will play left half
and Norm Standlee, still limping,
fullback.
That gives the Indian starting
backfield three charley horses —
Paulman has two—one game ankle,
and a halfback with toothpick legs.
Still, every one of the four can run
and block. Ledeboer and Paulman
can pass exceptionally with the
other two considered fair. And
Paulman, may the gods protect
him, is the sweetest kicker in the
conference.
ZAGAR QUESTION MARK
In the line, Thornhill has been
playing By West at the left tackle
job formerly under option to Pete
Zagar, who now assumes the role
of an unmounted Renfrew of the
Mounted. But Zagar may start any
way, depending on how Thornhill
sleeps tonight.
The rest of the first team, accord
ing to word given out yesterday
will be Willard and Stojkovich at
end; Andersen at tackle; Pool and
Donahue at guard; and Calvelli at
center.
If the taped-up backfield cracks,
Tiny has groomed Rod Parker, a
devastating crusher from Salinas, at
fullback, Thor Peterson at left half,
Bill Kirsch and Hugh Gallarneau
at right half, and Glenn Hamilton,
Gene Coldiron and A1 Alustiza at
quarter or full.
I'll FLAN'S WORRIES
Phelan'.s chief worry, aside from
losing his job, has been an injury
sustained by Chuck Newton, his
ace quarter. Newton i.s the only real
injury on the squad, and his
wrenched back probably won't keep
him out of the starting lineup.
The Washington backfield of
Newton, Jimmy Johnston, Dubsky,
and A1 Cruver was supposed to be
the best on the Coast during pre
season workouts. Unfortunately the
Husky sophomore and junior line
couldn't block well enough to give
the quartet a decent break.

conference.
ZAGAR QUESTION MARK
In the line, Thornhill has been
playing By West at the left tackle
job formerly under option to Pete
Zagar, who now assumes the role
of an unmounted Renfrew of the
Mounted. But Zagar may start any
way, depending on how Thornhill
sleeps tonight.
The rest of the first team, accord
ing to word given out yesterday
will be Willard and Stojkovich at
end; Andersen at tackle; Pool and
Donahue at guard; and Calvelli at
center.
If the taped-up backfield cracks,
Tiny has groomed Rod Parker, a
devastating crusher from Salinas, at
fullback, Thor Peterson at left half,
Bill Kirsch and Hugh Gallarneau
at right half, and Glenn Hamilton,
Gene Coldiron and A1 Alustiza at
quarter or full.
I'll FLAN'S WORRIES
Phelan'.s chief worry, aside from
losing his job, has been an injury
sustained by Chuck Newton, his
ace quarter. Newton i.s the only real
injury on the squad, and his
wrenched back probably won't keep
him out of the starting lineup.
The Washington backfield of
Newton, Jimmy Johnston, Dubsky,
and A1 Cruver was supposed to be
the best on the Coast during pre
season workouts. Unfortunately the
Husky sophomore and junior line
couldn't block well enough to give
the quartet a decent break.
You wouldn't believe it to look
at the odds, but the Stanford In
dians are in better mental condition
for the Washington game tomorrow
than they have been all season.
Physically, Tiny Thornhill's ag
gregation looks like the aftermath
of a gang fight. But if the Husky
battle depends on spirit and sheer
determination, then a small wager
on the Cardinals won't be amiss.

Special report from the B.A.C.
says that the Washington game
tomorrow will begin at 2 o'clock
instead of the usual time of 2:30.

The bookies hereabouts will give
as high as 2 to 1 that the oft-beaten
dogs of Jimmy Phelan will come
up with a win. The Huskies were
positively graceful in losing to Cali
fornia by a touchdown. They were
positively lousy in losing to Minne
sota, Oregon State, Southern Cali
fornia, and tying little Idaho.
PLAYED FAIR FOOTBALL
Except for the Santa Clara side
show, Stanford has played a fail
type of ball considering her many
injuries. Two conference wins and
two losses without Paulman and
Fay isn't exactly pitiful.
Paulman will bless the squad and
Thornhill with his presence in the
starting lineup tomorrow, although
Thornhill didn't consider him in
good enough shape to scrimmage
Wednesday afternoon. Jack Bren
ner, a two-legged jack rabbit if there
ever was one, is slated to start at
right half with a charley horse.
Fred Ledeboer will play left half
and Norm Standlee, still limping,
fullback.
That gives the Indian starting
backfield three charley horses —
Paulman has two—one game ankle,
and a halfback with toothpick legs.
Still, every one of the four can run
and block. Ledeboer and Paulman
can pass exceptionally with the
other two considered fair. And
Paulman, may the gods protect
him, is the sweetest kicker in the
conference.
