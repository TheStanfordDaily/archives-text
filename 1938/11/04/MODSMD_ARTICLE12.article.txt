# Soph Dance To Feature Full Moon
## Fitzpatrick First Name Band To Play On Campus This Year 
### 
' All Stanford men out to see the
moon!"
On the third night of a limited
engagement, the moon will look hap
pily down on Stanfordites at to
night's annual Sophomore Cotillion,
to be held in the Women's Gym
from 9 to 1 o'clock.
Music will be sytled by Eddie
Fitzpatrick, creator of "contagious
rhythm" and first big-name band to
be featured on the Farm this year.
His group of 14 entertainers will
supply the svelte, sophisticated mu
sic that has made his orchestra na
tionally famed.
SEMI FORMAL
In semi - formal attire, dancing
Stanfordites will enter a Women's
Gym tonight converted into a rep
lica of London's old Limehouse slum
district by Ben Miller and his dec
orations crew. Authentic details of
setting were mapped by Gene Call
non, technical adviser.
Scenery, especially designed and
painted by the sophs, will form the
background for the "Let's Go Slum
ming" theme. Refreshments will be
served by Sid Miller and his band
of costumed pub-keepers from side
walk cafes. This will mark the first
time that campus dancers will have
an opportunity to sit and talk in
timately at tables.
"The check-i'oom attendants and
guards will be dressed in keeping
with the Limehouse motif," Bob
Anderson, general dance chairman,
said. "Every attempt has been made
to achieve the true Limehouse at
mosphere," he continued. "Setting,
costuming, lighting all will empha
size the idea."
