# Rally Gives Rooters' Rules
## 
### 
White shirts must be worn by all
men and women who wish to sit in
the rooting section at the Washing
ton game tomorrow afternoon, ac
cording to Rally Committee Chair
man Jack Laney.
Men must also wear rooters' caps,
which may be purchased at Roos
Bros., as a hat stunt has been plan
ned by the Committee. There will
be no card stunts, as all ideas are
being saved for the Cal game in two
weeks.
Women rooters must also carry
pom-pons. These are still being
sold at the A.S.S.U. office.
