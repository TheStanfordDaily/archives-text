# Faculty Votes Against Bills; Olson Wins
## Balloting Censures Dies Committee; Shows Liberalism 
### 
"Today's straw-vote on the com
ing state election showed more than
ever that the Stanford faculty as
well as the general public votes
according to interest groups."
This is the opinion of Edwin K.
Dole, president of the Pi Sigma Al
pha, national political science fra
ternity, which yesterday polled
Farm voters on their stand regard
ing men and measures which will
go before the California electorate
Tuesday.
The tabulated results of yester
day's balloting show that the faculty
as a group unanimously voted "no"
on the four proposed initiative
measures, and definitely condemned
the activities of the Dies Commit
tee as undemocratic.
FACULTY VOTING
Faculty voters gave no strong plu
rality to either the Democratic or
Republican parties in their vote on
the state gubernatorial and sena
torial elections. Olson, Democratic
candidate for the governorship won
by a two-vote lead over Frank Mer
riam, 73-71. The Republican can
didate for U. S. Senator, Phillip
Bancroft won over Democrat Sheri
dan Downey, 94-42.
The four proposed initiatives were
overwhelmingly defeated by faculty
voters. Not a single vote was cast
in favor of the "Thirty Dollars Ev
ery Thursday" issue. The faculty
group, as a whole, voted against the
Anti-Vivisection Act, the Anti-
Picketing "ordinance," and the
measure for repealing the old sales
tax.
RECORD OF VOTES
Records of the votes cast, accord
ing to faculty departments show a
decided leaning towards the Demo
cratic Party among members of the
Social Science and Education De
partments, with a strong plurality
given to the Democratic candidates,
and with the overwhelming defeat of
the initiatives in this group.
The Engineering and Business De
partments voted enthusiastically for
the Republican Candidates for State
officials, and defeated the initiative
measures. A surprising approval of
the investigations of the Dies Com
mittee was expressed by these
groups.
Other faculty departments divid
ed their votes between the Demo
cratic and Republican candidates, al
though a general defeat of the ini
tiatives was recorded.
