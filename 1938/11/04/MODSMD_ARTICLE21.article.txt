# Farm Votes Tory In Straw Vote
## Republicans Win by Landslide; Ham and Eggs, Pound Act Swamped 
### 
Rolling up an overwhelmingly conservative vote, more than 1000
Stanford students yesterday re-elected incumbent Governor Merriam, sent
Republican Philip Bancroft to the Senate, defeated the Thirty Thursday,
and strongly criticized the Dies Committee in the biennial straw-vote heid
under the auspices of Pi Sigma Alpha, national honorary political

fraternity.
Totally reversing the liberal
trend shown two years ago in the
1936 Presidential election, the Farm
soundly trounced Democrats Cul
bert L. Olson and Sheridan Downey,
swamped the famed "Ham and
Eggs" pension plan with which both
have been closely connected, and
condemned the activities of the Dies
Committee by a vote of 466-323.
Voting consistently Republican,
students gave Merriam a plurality
of 388 votes over Olson, and 493 over
Progressive Raymond L. Haight,
who has withdrawn from active
competition for the office. Evidently
a favorite with the Stanford elec
torate, the governor polled 590 votes
to 202 for Olson, and 97 for Haight.
His running-mate, Walter F. Frank
lin, defeated Democrat Ellis Patter
son, 631-231, to take the Lieutenant
governoi'ship.
COTTRELL'S PREDICTION
Justifying the prediction made
several days ago by Professor Ed
win A. Cottrell, head of the political
science department, Philip Bancroft
ran up an even greater Republican
majority in the Senatorial race than
was apparent in the battle for the
governorship. Roundly defeating
Ham-and-Egger Sheridan Downey,
he polled 692 votes to Downey's 153,
Soicalist Lillian Clements' 45.
On the "$3O Every Thursday" is
sue, the Farm was virtually unani
mous in its condemnation, only an
insignificant and probably deliber
ate minority of the 919 votes cast
being favorable. Closely paralleling
the vote against Downey, the bal
loting showed 845 opposing Califor
nia's short-cut to heaven, 74 uphold
ing it. Two voters held out for $60
every Saturday, but no provision
had been made for a vote on this
maesure, and their ballots were re
gretfully thrown out.
ANTI-VIVISECTION
Increased by a series of articles in
The Daily, student opposition to
Proposition No. 2, the so-called
"Humane Pound Act," resulted in an
814-73 defeat for it. Criticized by
many doctors and educators, among
them President Wilbur, the bill was
considered too reactionary by the
great majority of Farm voters.
Also thrown in the discard, Propo
sition No. 20, the "Single Tax" was
completely submerged by student
disapproval. Only 160 could be
found approving, while 704 con
demned it.
On Proposition No. 1 — "Anti-
Pickcting"—the Farm split, a slight
edge going to the conservatives, who
approved the measure 410-372.

Rolling up an overwhelmingly conservative vote, more than 1000
Stanford students yesterday re-elected incumbent Governor Merriam, sent
Republican Philip Bancroft to the Senate, defeated the Thirty Thursday,
and strongly criticized the Dies Committee in the biennial straw-vote heid
under the auspices of Pi Sigma Alpha, national honorary political

fraternity.
Totally reversing the liberal
trend shown two years ago in the
1936 Presidential election, the Farm
soundly trounced Democrats Cul
bert L. Olson and Sheridan Downey,
swamped the famed "Ham and
Eggs" pension plan with which both
have been closely connected, and
condemned the activities of the Dies
Committee by a vote of 466-323.
Voting consistently Republican,
students gave Merriam a plurality
of 388 votes over Olson, and 493 over
Progressive Raymond L. Haight,
who has withdrawn from active
competition for the office. Evidently
a favorite with the Stanford elec
torate, the governor polled 590 votes
to 202 for Olson, and 97 for Haight.
His running-mate, Walter F. Frank

son, 631-231, to take the Lieutenant
governoi'ship.
COTTRELL'S PREDICTION
Justifying the prediction made
several days ago by Professor Ed
win A. Cottrell, head of the political
science department, Philip Bancroft
ran up an even greater Republican
majority in the Senatorial race than
was apparent in the battle for the
governorship. Roundly defeating
Ham-and-Egger Sheridan Downey,
he polled 692 votes to Downey's 153,
Soicalist Lillian Clements' 45.
On the "$3O Every Thursday" is
sue, the Farm was virtually unani
mous in its condemnation, only an
insignificant and probably deliber
ate minority of the 919 votes cast
being favorable. Closely paralleling
the vote against Downey, the bal
loting showed 845 opposing Califor
nia's short-cut to heaven, 74 uphold
ing it. Two voters held out for $60
every Saturday, but no provision
had been made for a vote on this
maesure, and their ballots were re
gretfully thrown out.
ANTI-VIVISECTION
Increased by a series of articles in
The Daily, student opposition to
Proposition No. 2, the so-called
"Humane Pound Act," resulted in an
814-73 defeat for it. Criticized by
many doctors and educators, among
them President Wilbur, the bill was
considered too reactionary by the
great majority of Farm voters.

disapproval. Only 160 could be
