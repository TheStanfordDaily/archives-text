# Flower Authority Speaks at Farm
## 
### 
Using '"Flower Arrangement" as
his theme, J. Gregory Conway, au
thor and noted authority on flowers,
delivered a lecture at the Women's
Clubhouse yesterday afternoon. As
sisted by Helen Matsuoka, Mr. Con
way also gave demonstrations of
pleasing flower arrangements, using
antique bronze vases.
The lecturer, who is the only Oc
cidental ever to receive a diploma
from the Ohara School of Japan,
also teaches the only accredited
course in flower arrangement to be
offered in an American university.
The lecture was sponsored by the
Stanford Bookstore, which is cur

book, "The Art of Arrangement."
The only two areas in the world
where alligators (as distinguished
from crocodiles) are found today are
in the Lower Yangtzse in China and
Mississippi and Florida where ihe
larger Mississippi alligator occurs.
