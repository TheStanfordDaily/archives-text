# Claimants Get A.S.S.U. Cards
## Fifty-seven Cards Still Held at B.A.C. 
### 
Thirty-six of ninety-three A. S.
S. U. cards which were confiscated
from illegal holders by the Board of
Athletic Control at the Bruin game
last week have been reclaimed by
their rightful owners, Jake Irwin,
manager of operations for the
8.A.C., disclosed today.
Following a suggestion of the Ex
Committee early this week, B.A.C.
officials attached a $2 fine on each
ticket returned. Irwin was of the
opinion that the majority of the
pasteboards would be repurchased
before the Washington game Satur
day.
Practically every adverse criti
cism of the confication that has been
made has been '-absurd," according
to Irwin. Many complained because
they had to pay the extra $2 for
their tickets when "lots of others got
through without being caught."
To this Irwin confessed, "We
have made no claim to discovering
every guilty party. That would be
a near-impossibility." With but
two checking booths at the game, the
B.A.C. functioned as efficiently in
the matter as could be expected, he
implied.
Only the original buyers of the
confiscated cards arc eligible to
reclaim them, it was said.
A committee headed by A1 Horn,
president of Men's Council, is to de
cide on a permanent University pol
icy in regard to the transferability
of student cards, it was learned. Co
workers with Horn are Gretchen
Ahlswede, Carolyn Hibbard, Andy
Stojkovich, Pat Skinner, and A. S.
S. U. President 11. B. Lee.
