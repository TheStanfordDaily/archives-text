# Diggers Mistake Shakespeare Tomb

### 
LONDON, Nov. 3 (UP).â€”The dean
of Westminster Abbey today told a
group of excavators to pack up their
spades and get out after they had
opened the wrong grave in search
of an answer to the 170-year-old
dispute as to whether William
Shakespeare really wrote his own
stuff.
An attempt to prove, by digging
nearly four feet into the solid
foundations of the poets' corner in
the abbey to the tomb of Poet Ed
mond Spenser, that Francis Bacon
was the real author of Shakespeare's
plays ended in failure.
