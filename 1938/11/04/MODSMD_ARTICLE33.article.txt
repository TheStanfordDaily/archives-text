# Evacuation Closes Old Boathouse Era
## 
### 
When Ilal Weatherbe and Bill Hatch trudged down the hill from an
old wooden building beside a dried-up lake Wednesday, a minor era
ended on the Farm.
Twenty-five years ago, the Stanford boathouse was new and shiny. It
had just been constructed in answer to popular demand, the necessary

>$1800 being supplied by the Board of
Control on student athletic enter
prises, which handled such matters
at that time.
Today, musty and decrepit, it is
due to be torn down, when men with
axes and crow-bars come down from
San Francisco. This, too, is in an
swer to a student campaign.
In 1913, the lakeshore was a cen
ter for crew racing. Today, however,
the student body is beginning to pay
somewhere around $10,000 for a new
concrete structure to be used mostly
as a center for canoeing, sun-bath
ing, and swimming.
Even since last spring, when the
old boathouse made the San Fran
cisco papers by dropping 25 students
and a middle-aged man into Lake
Lagunita, the campus has shaken its
head. "She's about throught" has
been the consensus.
WILBUR GIVES SUPPORT
As the student campaign gathered
momentum this fall, President Ray
Lyman Wilbur lent support. "I have
been looking at the old building for
20 years," he was quoted as saying,
"and I see more and more clearly
that it is utterly outmoded."
Acting promptly on the situation,
Ex Committee spent most of its Oct.
18 meeting talking about a new boat
house—considering various types of
structures, mulling over possible
methods of financing the job, and
finally okaying a motion allocating
$2500 for down payment.
At that time, $7000 was set as the
probable cost of construction. Plans,
it was decided, would follow in gen
eral the plan submitted by Dick
Spencer, who won a contest, in
which numerous plans and sketches
were submitted.
After Architect Ernest Weihe had
adapted Spencer's plan to fit the
contractor's needs, and such ex
penses as landscaping, maintenance,
and the architect's fee had been in
cluded, total cost was expected at
the last announcement to reach al
most to the $10,000 mark.
$7500 NEEDED
Meanwhile, Ex Committee boat
house subcommittee has been meet
ing periodically, planning ways and
means for acquiring $7500. Accord
ing to their tentative plans, most of
the fund-raising is to be included
in one big campaign, lasting only a
day or two.
Recent discussion sessions of the
group have centered ax - ound a Boat
house Week-end to be held early in
December. A carnival will probably
be held the first night, preceded by
a barbecue, cost of the regular
evening meal at all living groups to
go to the Boathouse Fund.
Intramural finals the next after
noon would bring in additional
money, and a dance in the evening
would climax the campaign.
So work on the new lakefront
building begins—less than a month
after agitation began.
And when Weatherbe and Hatch
come back at the first of next quar
ter, the old lake just won't be the
same place.

contractor's needs, and such ex
penses as landscaping, maintenance,
and the architect's fee had been in
cluded, total cost was expected at
the last announcement to reach al
most to the $10,000 mark.
$7500 NEEDED
Meanwhile, Ex Committee boat
house subcommittee has been meet
ing periodically, planning ways and
means for acquiring $7500. Accord
ing to their tentative plans, most of
the fund-raising is to be included
in one big campaign, lasting only a
day or two.
Recent discussion sessions of the
group have centered ax - ound a Boat
house Week-end to be held early in
December. A carnival will probably
be held the first night, preceded by
a barbecue, cost of the regular
evening meal at all living groups to
go to the Boathouse Fund.
Intramural finals the next after
noon would bring in additional
money, and a dance in the evening
would climax the campaign.
So work on the new lakefront
building begins—less than a month
after agitation began.
And when Weatherbe and Hatch
come back at the first of next quar
ter, the old lake just won't be the
same place.
When Ilal Weatherbe and Bill Hatch trudged down the hill from an
old wooden building beside a dried-up lake Wednesday, a minor era
ended on the Farm.
Twenty-five years ago, the Stanford boathouse was new and shiny. It
had just been constructed in answer to popular demand, the necessary

>$1800 being supplied by the Board of
Control on student athletic enter
prises, which handled such matters
at that time.
Today, musty and decrepit, it is
due to be torn down, when men with
axes and crow-bars come down from
San Francisco. This, too, is in an
swer to a student campaign.
In 1913, the lakeshore was a cen
ter for crew racing. Today, however,
the student body is beginning to pay
somewhere around $10,000 for a new
concrete structure to be used mostly
as a center for canoeing, sun-bath
ing, and swimming.
Even since last spring, when the
old boathouse made the San Fran
cisco papers by dropping 25 students
and a middle-aged man into Lake
Lagunita, the campus has shaken its
head. "She's about throught" has
been the consensus.
WILBUR GIVES SUPPORT
As the student campaign gathered
momentum this fall, President Ray
Lyman Wilbur lent support. "I have
been looking at the old building for
20 years," he was quoted as saying,
"and I see more and more clearly
that it is utterly outmoded."
Acting promptly on the situation,
Ex Committee spent most of its Oct.
18 meeting talking about a new boat
house—considering various types of
structures, mulling over possible
methods of financing the job, and
finally okaying a motion allocating
$2500 for down payment.
At that time, $7000 was set as the
probable cost of construction. Plans,
it was decided, would follow in gen
eral the plan submitted by Dick
Spencer, who won a contest, in
which numerous plans and sketches
were submitted.
After Architect Ernest Weihe had
adapted Spencer's plan to fit the
contractor's needs, and such ex
penses as landscaping, maintenance,
and the architect's fee had been in
cluded, total cost was expected at
the last announcement to reach al
most to the $10,000 mark.
