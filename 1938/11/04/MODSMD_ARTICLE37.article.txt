### 
OAKLAND, Nov. 3 (UP). â€” The
Hamburg-American steamer Van
couver, flying the Nazi flag, was
wrecked in the Oakland Estuary to
day by an explosion which Captain
W. Moessinger, commander of the
vessel, said might have been caused
by a bomb.
The story of an eye witness lent
credence to the possibility of sabo
tage in the explosion in which four
membei's of the crew were injured.
A botanical explorer has found the
South American plant, which In
dians chew to make their teeth
black, preserves their teeth from
decay.
