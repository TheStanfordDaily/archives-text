# GATES TO JOIN CULT
## 
### 
AMHERST, N.H., Nov. 3 (UP).â€”
The pleas of his family and argu
ments of schoolmates failed tonight
to dent the determination of Har
rison K. '"Heavenly" Gates, crack
Dartmouth quarterback, to give up
football for life on a "Holy Ghost'
cult farm in the New Hampshire
hills.
