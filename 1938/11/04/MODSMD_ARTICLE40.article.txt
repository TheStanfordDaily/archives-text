LONDON, Nov. 3 ,(UP). â€”Viscount
Haliiax, British Foreign Secretary,
admitted in the House of Lords to
day the Anglo-Italian pact of friend
ship would have no effect in swerv
ing Premier Benito Mussolini from
his insistence upon an Insurgent
victory in the Spanish civil war.
The House of Lords approved, by
a vote of 55 to 6, Lord Halifax's mo
tion "welcoming" a decision to put
the pact into operation without de
lay. The House of Commons ap
proved a similar motion by a vote
of 345 to 138 Wednesday night.
