# MUDDERS IN BACKFIELD
## 
### 
PULLMAN, Wash., Nov. 3 (UP).
â€”With a wet field in prospect, coach
Babe Ilollingbery said today he
probably would start his "mudders"
in the Washington State backfield
against U.C.L.A. Saturday. Sopho
more Earle Stone, sturdy defensive
center, also has earned a place on
the starting eleven, Ilollingbery
said.
Incunabula was a name applied to
printed books before 1500.
