"The anti-vivisection measure will cripple medical research and set
back progress by at least 50 years," said Hadley Kirkinan of the Anatomy
Department at a public meeting, sponsored by the Palo Alto-Stanford
Teachers' Union, hold in the Palo Alto High School auditorium Thursday
evening. The group unanimously opposed the measure in a vote taken at
the conclusion of the talk.
A secret straw-ballot taken at the close of the meeting unanimously
condemned the so-called Labor Peace Initiative No. 1. Joel Berreman of
the Stanford sociology faculty pointed out that the measure was a death

blow to unionism, no aid to indus
trial peace, fraudulent misrepresen
tation of what it purports to accom
plish, and a direct attack on the
public interest through outlawing
consumers' organizations, church
groups, and other groups organized
to express the public's objection to
practices.
Professor Guido Marx, who pre
sided over the meeting, urged adop
tion of Proposition No. 13. revenue
bond measure, terming opposition
"a utility inspired attempt to block
the establishment of publicly owned
public utilities." The meeting sup
ported this opinion with only a
single dissent.
The attempted further removal of
our initiative process from popular
control by Proposition No. 17 was
urged as reason for its defeat by
Otis Brubaker of the Stanford Po
litical Science Department.
Professor Elmer Fagan opposed
Proposition No. 20 concerning tax
ation as using the wrong means to
achieve its needed purpose. He also
opposed Retirement Life Payments
as economically dangerous, infla
tionary, a penalty on salaried and
wages-receiving people, as certain
to reduce wages.
