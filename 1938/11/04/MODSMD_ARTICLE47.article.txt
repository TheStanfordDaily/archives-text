# Record Programs To Begin Monday
## 
### 
Record programs will be resumed
next Monday afternoon at 4:15
o'clock in the Little Theater, under
the auspices of the Division of Mu
sic. The first program will be devot
ed to the works of the late George
Gershwin.
A Memorial Album has just been
issued as a tribute by his friend,
Nathaniel Shilkret. Under the di
rection of Shilkret, a competent
vocal and orchestral ensemble to
gether with Jane Froman, Sonny
Schuyler, and Felix Knight, solo
ists, have recorded a varied program
of hits from "Swanee" to "Porgy and
Bess." An arrangement of the mid
dle movement of the "Rhapsody in
Blue," with choral effects, is includ
ed, but the whole rhapsody will be
played on Monday's program, in its
original form.
Ranging all the way from the
pathos of American negro song to
the tongue-in-cheek satire in "Of
Thee I Sing" and the exuberant
rhythms of "Strike Up the Band,"
these records are all truly American
music in the best sense of the word.
It is the sort of music that cultured
Europeans are eager to hear as typ
ical of this culture of ours, and it is
music of which no cultured Ameri
can need be ashamed.
Gershwin takes his place with
Stephen Foster, Walt Whitman,
Thomas Benton, John Philip Sousa,
Reginald de Koven, Victor Herbert,
and other artists who have sensed
the singing vitality of our democ
racy.
