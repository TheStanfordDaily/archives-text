# Stanford, California To Debate Tax Question
## 
### 
Stanford and California will in
augurate the fall Radio Debate Se
ries tomorrow afternoon when they
take to the air at 5 o'clock over
KSFO.
The Stanford representatives,
Gene Glassmann and Robert Cur
tiss, will take the negative and anal
ysis of the question: "Resolved, that
the state sales tax should be re
placed by increased taxes on high
incomes." The California debaters
will state the affirmative and eval
uation.
Initiated last year by the Coast
Radio Debate League, the series at
tained a large general following. To
satisfy this popularity the present
schedule provides for a tilt to be
broadcast every Saturday from No
vember 5 to December 10.
Participating in the league's pro
grams will be the Universities of
California, Santa Clara, St. Mary's,
San Francisco, Stanford and San
Jose State. As the schedule now
stands, Stanford will debate twice
over the air: tomorrow evening with
Cal and December 3 with the Uni
versity of San Francisco.
These debates are planned as non
decision bouts but some provision
may be made for an audience poll.
Representatives from San Jose
State journeyed to Stanford yester
day afternoon and debated the ques
tion: "Resolved, that an Anglo-
American mutual assistance pact
in case of aggression will be in the

best interests of world peace" with
Joel Boyce and Walt Stoessel. Al
though it was a non-decision de
bate, both sides argued their points
with a vigor that implied great
stakes. Commenting on the two
Stanford representatives, Leland T.
Chapin, varsity debate coach, de
clared: "These sophomore boys
demonstrated thejr exceptional abil
ities today and I am sure that they
will develop into fine debaters."
