Huskies have been taking stabs
at victories for some time now, and
tomorrow they'll take another—and
it may mean that the Indian's war
bonnet will lose another feather.
Injuries have run rampant on the
Husky squad all season, and the
two sophomores who were to make
the Northerners famous did not es
cape. Rudy Much and Dean Mc-
Adams gave them hopes of a world
beating backfield, but both have
lost considerable time from injuries,
and Rudy has been shifted to cen
ter.
But both will be ready to go to
mori'ow, and so will Stanford's
Norm Standlee, another sophomore
sensation just recovered from an
injury.
SANTA CLARA GAME
Fans will be reminded of Santa
Clara when they see the Wash
ington offense. The short side at
tack, with spinners and reverses,
is the basis of Coach Jimmy Phe
lan's ground offense.
! The Huskies use passes, too, and
i they are especially skilled in later
| als, which they toss usually after
j faking line bucks. They show little
i deception in their shift, which is
! slow and leisurely.
The Big Red Machine will have its
real trouble getting through a strong
and clever Washington defense.
The Huskies are large and powerful,
and Phelan has rigged up defensive
strategy as intricate as his offense.
After nearly every play, the captain
I calls signals and the Huskies line up
jin a new defensive formation. Try
! ing to call plays on a basis of the
Husky defense is almost useless for
j the opponent signal-caller.
PAULMAN BACK
The Indians played their best
j game last week, and tomorrow
they'll have Bill Paulman, for half
the game at least, to kick them
out of the hole. And practices
j this week would lead an observer
| to expect a much-improved Card
running attack.
The Huskies deserve to be favo
; rites tomorrow, but if the Indians
are at their best, there will be some
| long faces when the Washingtonians
J take their gridders and go home.
* * *
j ( CHAMPIONSHIP of the "Big Four"
j conference will be at stake to
-1 morrow when Stanford's undefeated
! Papooses take on California's Cubs
! tomorrow afternoon in the Little Big
j Game at Berkeley.
J Both teams have been hard hit
I with injuries, but each will field

eleven fine ball players with good
records. The Cubs have been dealt
the worst blow in the loss of Jack
McQuarry, man of their offense, and
Kenny Speer, quarterback. Each of
them has a chance of playing, but
they will not be in top form.
FINE TEAM
Stanford lias produced one of
the finest frosh teams in years tins
season, and it is a pleasant sur
prise after the early disappoint
ment in the small turn-out of grid
candidates mostly unheard-of in
the West. Unknown quantities
were the many players who hailed
from all over the United States,
hut they have panned out into a
fine hall club, and have chalked
up a series of decisive victories.
The Papooses have looked better
than ever before in practice this
week, and nobody need be surprised
if they come home tomorrow cham
pions of their conference.
* * *
i science has been injected
j ' into the Stanford polo team, and
we'll have a chance to see the new
| team in action against a crack ag
gregation from the San Mateo Polo
, Club on the Highway Field this
j afternoon.
MAJOR ALLEN
| Major Harry Allen, new polo
| coach for the Cards, is the same
: Pete Allen who was all-American

basketball star from Kansas some
years ago, and he has since coached
football and basketball there. He is
official timekeeper at all of Stan
ford's home games.
So the new coach is teaching
polo with a iniiul for highly sci
entific sports. Stanford riders
have learned a repertoire of plays
and signals, and the new tactics
should add appreciably to the
spectator interest at the games.
San Mateo is the best-mounted
team in this district, so if not for the
i game itself, you will find it worth
your while to drop around just to
see a bunch of horses that wouldn't
look like snails beside Seabiscuit.
♦ * *
and soccer will be
played in San Francisco this
week-end, and each game will begin
a repeat series for the Stanford rep
resentatives.
Indian swimmers will meet the
Olympic Club tonight in the second
tough game with a group consisting
mostly of former Berkeley stars. It
will be a close game and one that
j can fall either way.
Booters will play the San Fran
cisco Junior College tomorrow, and
their remarkable improvement since
they battled to a tie with the first
j team in their season opener gives
i the Cards a decided edge for a
| victory.

FINE TEAM
Stanford lias produced one of
the finest frosh teams in years tins
season, and it is a pleasant sur
prise after the early disappoint
ment in the small turn-out of grid
candidates mostly unheard-of in
the West. Unknown quantities
were the many players who hailed
from all over the United States,
hut they have panned out into a
fine hall club, and have chalked
up a series of decisive victories.
The Papooses have looked better
than ever before in practice this
week, and nobody need be surprised
if they come home tomorrow cham
pions of their conference.

i science has been injected

MAJOR ALLEN
| Major Harry Allen, new polo
| coach for the Cards, is the same
: Pete Allen who was all-American

basketball star from Kansas some
years ago, and he has since coached
football and basketball there. He is
official timekeeper at all of Stan
ford's home games.
So the new coach is teaching
polo with a iniiul for highly sci
entific sports. Stanford riders
have learned a repertoire of plays
and signals, and the new tactics
should add appreciably to the
spectator interest at the games.
San Mateo is the best-mounted
team in this district, so if not for the
i game itself, you will find it worth
your while to drop around just to
see a bunch of horses that wouldn't
look like snails beside Seabiscuit.

Indian swimmers will meet the
Olympic Club tonight in the second
tough game with a group consisting
mostly of former Berkeley stars. It
will be a close game and one that
j can fall either way.
Booters will play the San Fran

their remarkable improvement since
they battled to a tie with the first
j team in their season opener gives
i the Cards a decided edge for a

r pHOSE University of Washington l
Huskies have been taking stabs
at victories for some time now, and
tomorrow they'll take another—and
it may mean that the Indian's war
bonnet will lose another feather.
Injuries have run rampant on the
Husky squad all season, and the
two sophomores who were to make
the Northerners famous did not es
cape. Rudy Much and Dean Mc-
Adams gave them hopes of a world
beating backfield, but both have
lost considerable time from injuries,
and Rudy has been shifted to cen
ter.
But both will be ready to go to
mori'ow, and so will Stanford's
Norm Standlee, another sophomore
sensation just recovered from an
injury.
SANTA CLARA GAME
Fans will be reminded of Santa
Clara when they see the Wash
ington offense. The short side at
tack, with spinners and reverses,
is the basis of Coach Jimmy Phe
lan's ground offense.
! The Huskies use passes, too, and
i they are especially skilled in later
| als, which they toss usually after
j faking line bucks. They show little
i deception in their shift, which is
! slow and leisurely.
The Big Red Machine will have its
real trouble getting through a strong
and clever Washington defense.
The Huskies are large and powerful,
and Phelan has rigged up defensive
strategy as intricate as his offense.
After nearly every play, the captain
I calls signals and the Huskies line up
jin a new defensive formation. Try
! ing to call plays on a basis of the
Husky defense is almost useless for
j the opponent signal-caller.
PAULMAN BACK
The Indians played their best
j game last week, and tomorrow
they'll have Bill Paulman, for half
the game at least, to kick them
out of the hole. And practices
j this week would lead an observer
| to expect a much-improved Card
running attack.
The Huskies deserve to be favo
; rites tomorrow, but if the Indians
are at their best, there will be some

J take their gridders and go home.

two sophomores who were to make
the Northerners famous did not es
cape. Rudy Much and Dean Mc-
Adams gave them hopes of a world
beating backfield, but both have
lost considerable time from injuries,
and Rudy has been shifted to cen
ter.
But both will be ready to go to
mori'ow, and so will Stanford's
Norm Standlee, another sophomore
sensation just recovered from an
injury.
SANTA CLARA GAME
Fans will be reminded of Santa
Clara when they see the Wash
ington offense. The short side at
tack, with spinners and reverses,
is the basis of Coach Jimmy Phe
lan's ground offense.
! The Huskies use passes, too, and
i they are especially skilled in later
| als, which they toss usually after
j faking line bucks. They show little
i deception in their shift, which is
! slow and leisurely.
The Big Red Machine will have its
real trouble getting through a strong
and clever Washington defense.
The Huskies are large and powerful,
and Phelan has rigged up defensive
strategy as intricate as his offense.
After nearly every play, the captain
I calls signals and the Huskies line up
jin a new defensive formation. Try
! ing to call plays on a basis of the
Husky defense is almost useless for
j the opponent signal-caller.
PAULMAN BACK
The Indians played their best
j game last week, and tomorrow
they'll have Bill Paulman, for half
the game at least, to kick them
out of the hole. And practices
j this week would lead an observer
| to expect a much-improved Card
running attack.
The Huskies deserve to be favo
; rites tomorrow, but if the Indians
are at their best, there will be some
| long faces when the Washingtonians
J take their gridders and go home.

j ( CHAMPIONSHIP of the "Big Four"
j conference will be at stake to
-1 morrow when Stanford's undefeated
! Papooses take on California's Cubs
! tomorrow afternoon in the Little Big
j Game at Berkeley.
J Both teams have been hard hit
I with injuries, but each will field

eleven fine ball players with good
records. The Cubs have been dealt
the worst blow in the loss of Jack
McQuarry, man of their offense, and
Kenny Speer, quarterback. Each of
them has a chance of playing, but
they will not be in top form.
FINE TEAM
Stanford lias produced one of
the finest frosh teams in years tins
season, and it is a pleasant sur
prise after the early disappoint
ment in the small turn-out of grid
candidates mostly unheard-of in
the West. Unknown quantities
were the many players who hailed
from all over the United States,
hut they have panned out into a
fine hall club, and have chalked
up a series of decisive victories.
The Papooses have looked better
than ever before in practice this
week, and nobody need be surprised
if they come home tomorrow cham
pions of their conference.

i science has been injected
j ' into the Stanford polo team, and
we'll have a chance to see the new
| team in action against a crack ag
gregation from the San Mateo Polo
, Club on the Highway Field this
j afternoon.
MAJOR ALLEN
| Major Harry Allen, new polo
| coach for the Cards, is the same
: Pete Allen who was all-American

basketball star from Kansas some
years ago, and he has since coached
football and basketball there. He is
official timekeeper at all of Stan
ford's home games.
So the new coach is teaching
polo with a iniiul for highly sci
entific sports. Stanford riders
have learned a repertoire of plays
and signals, and the new tactics
should add appreciably to the
spectator interest at the games.
San Mateo is the best-mounted
team in this district, so if not for the
i game itself, you will find it worth
your while to drop around just to
see a bunch of horses that wouldn't
look like snails beside Seabiscuit.

and soccer will be
played in San Francisco this

a repeat series for the Stanford rep
resentatives.
Indian swimmers will meet the
Olympic Club tonight in the second
tough game with a group consisting
mostly of former Berkeley stars. It
will be a close game and one that
j can fall either way.
Booters will play the San Fran
cisco Junior College tomorrow, and
their remarkable improvement since
they battled to a tie with the first
j team in their season opener gives
i the Cards a decided edge for a
