# Papooses Have Slight Edge Over Bear Cubs
## Frosh Passing Attack Key to Grid Win In Little Big Game 
### 
A couple of riled-up football j
teams enter the field of forensics to- |
morrow at Berkeley when they at- j
tempt to debate the question, "Re- j
solved, that the 1938 Stanford!
freshman football team is the great
est yearling outfit from the Farm
since the Vow Boys."
However, these debaters wax elo
quent not with fluent words, but
with mighty shoulders, bulging bi
eeps, muscular bodies, and steel
like hips. On the affirmative will be
Coach Harry Shipkey's Papooses, un- j
defeated and untied, and determined
to prove conclusively the truth of I
the resolution.
Opposing them on the negative
are a bunch of bruisers representing
California, who, in their refutation,
will try to show that the Cards are
merely a one-man outfit riding to
victory on the brilliant play of sen
sational Frankie Albert.
ISEARCUBS UNDERDOES
It's the annual Little Big Game,
which takes a back seat to no con
flict on the Coast for thrills, inspi
rational playing, and upsets. Last
year the underdog Papooses reversed
the dope and defeated the Bearcubs,
13-0. This year Coach Clint Evans
will Ik? gunning for the upset.
Records for the teams give Stan
ford an edge, off comparative scores
against common foes, but no expert
is willing to concede the conclu
siveness of comparative scores, es
pecially in such a traditional game
as this.
Cal points out that Stanford has
run up its record by virtue of a
great passing attack, and that the
Papooses have shown little power
on the ground. Evans plans to have
Carl Leipzig and Ray Amling, Cub
ends, hound the Card passer, figur
ing that if Cal can break up Stan
lords aerial attack, they can spring
their upset.
GROUND PLAYS GOOD
But Shipkey has been working all
week on running plays, and with
Albert and Pete Kmetovic packing
the hod behind the brilliant block
ing ol Jack Francis and John Stur
geon, he sees no reason why the
ground plays shouldn't work.
Ihe Card coach also has a little
strategy for his passing attack up
his .sleeve. So far Frankie Albert
has done all the passing when he
was i-n the game. Tomorrow, how
ever, Shipkey is planning to work
reverse passes in both directions,
with Kmetovich and Sturgeon, the
halves, doing the tossing.
Shipkey claims that Stanford can
break up the Bear power attack if
the Papoose forwards outcharge their
loes instead of playing a waiting
game. The main difficulty is that
Stanford's line will be outweighed on
an average of 15 pounds to the man.

has done all the passing when he
was i-n the game. Tomorrow, how

reverse passes in both directions,

Shipkey claims that Stanford can
break up the Bear power attack if
the Papoose forwards outcharge their
loes instead of playing a waiting
game. The main difficulty is that
Stanford's line will be outweighed on
an average of 15 pounds to the man.
SQL'AD LISTED
Shipkey will take a squad of 40
men to Berkeley, led by Acting
Captain Frank Albert and Line Cap
tain Dave Patterson:
Ends—Fred Meyer, Burt Talcott,

Cowden, Bud Ames; Mel Ellett.
Tackles—Wink Jones, Bud Rad

A couple of riled-up football j
teams enter the field of forensics to- |
morrow at Berkeley when they at- j
tempt to debate the question, "Re- j
solved, that the 1938 Stanford!
freshman football team is the great
est yearling outfit from the Farm
since the Vow Boys."
However, these debaters wax elo
quent not with fluent words, but
with mighty shoulders, bulging bi
eeps, muscular bodies, and steel
like hips. On the affirmative will be
Coach Harry Shipkey's Papooses, un- j
defeated and untied, and determined
to prove conclusively the truth of I
the resolution.
Opposing them on the negative
are a bunch of bruisers representing
California, who, in their refutation,
will try to show that the Cards are
merely a one-man outfit riding to
victory on the brilliant play of sen
sational Frankie Albert.
ISEARCUBS UNDERDOES
It's the annual Little Big Game,
which takes a back seat to no con
flict on the Coast for thrills, inspi
rational playing, and upsets. Last
year the underdog Papooses reversed
the dope and defeated the Bearcubs,
13-0. This year Coach Clint Evans
will Ik? gunning for the upset.
Records for the teams give Stan
ford an edge, off comparative scores
against common foes, but no expert
is willing to concede the conclu
siveness of comparative scores, es
pecially in such a traditional game
as this.
Cal points out that Stanford has
run up its record by virtue of a
great passing attack, and that the
Papooses have shown little power
on the ground. Evans plans to have
Carl Leipzig and Ray Amling, Cub
ends, hound the Card passer, figur
ing that if Cal can break up Stan
lords aerial attack, they can spring
their upset.
GROUND PLAYS GOOD
But Shipkey has been working all
week on running plays, and with
Albert and Pete Kmetovic packing
the hod behind the brilliant block
ing ol Jack Francis and John Stur
geon, he sees no reason why the
ground plays shouldn't work.
