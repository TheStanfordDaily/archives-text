### 
Ousting last year's runner-up in
tramural touch football club from
further contention, Phi Gamma Del
ta turned in a stunning 6-0 upset
victory over Phi Delta Phi yester
day. After driving deep into Fiji
territory, a stray Phi Delt pass was
intercepted by Bayer, who galloped
through a broken field for a 98-
yard touchdown sprint.
The triumph eased the Fijis into i
the League VI title and left the in
tramural parade with four league
crowns still to be decided.

be installed League IX champs once
they get by Sigma Nu today.
