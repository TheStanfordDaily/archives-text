# Water Poloists Beat San Jose
## Indians' Lamb Makes Goal in Six Seconds 
### 
Cardinal varsity water poloists
yesterday outswam and outplayed
an inferior San Jose State College
squad to add another victory to their
long list of wins by the score of 7
to 3. The game was definitely Stan
ford's from the beginning of play,
it being only late in the last period
that San Jose produced any scoring
threat.
Outstanding play of the game
came in the first minute when In
dian Lamb, who played probably
the most consistent game for Stan
ford, grabbed and splashed the ball
into the opponents' goal a mere six
seconds after the fight began. From
that moment on, competition de
veloped such grunting and groan
ing as caused the packed stands to
sway with enthusiasm. Both Lamb
and Rothschild of the Cax'dinal team
then spent the remainder of the
afternoon each attempting to sur
pass the other in the number of
goals made, with the result that they
led the way to four scores in the
first period, and three in the second
period.
San Jose, bewildered by the Stan
ford flash, were only able to squeeze
through one tally early in the first
period. It was not until in the last
period that the down-state squad
began to click, with a net result of
two well-earned goals in the clos
ing moments of play.
