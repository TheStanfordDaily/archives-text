# Bob Breyer Takes Varsity Golf Lead
## 
### 
Bob Breyer carded a 73 to add to
j his total of 301 and took command
| in last week's varsity golf competi-
I tion. Breyer's lead will be only
j temporary, however, for Art Doer
ing, who topped the field by 15
I strokes the previous week, failed to
turn in a card and will undoubtedly
; regain his leadership when he does,
j Frank Tatum continued to pace
J the Frosh niblick by slapping out a
! 78 to give him an aggregate of 399,
! but he is being trailed closely by
I Guy Showley and Bud Spurlock,
who boast totals of 402. Tuesday
afternoon Dick Wright annexed the
annual San Jose Cily championship
i by defeating his team-mate, Warren
! Berl, two and one. Both golfers were
I severely handicapped by a driving
| rain and soggy greens and fairways.
