# Matinee Bids For Gaieties Sell Today
## 
### 
Tickets for a matinee performance
of the Big Game Gaieties will sell
on the English corner today from
9 to 12 o'clock and after that they
may be obtained at the A.S.S.U. of
fices.
Students should buy their tickets
early to be assured of good seats—
or of any seats at all—since it is ex
pected that the matinee perform
ance will be a second sell-out.
Prices will remain the same as for
the evening performance—sl.so, $1,
and 50 cents.
The show is slated for Friday,
November 18, from 2 to 4:15 o'clock
—so the matinee audience will miss
only the beginning of the Big Game
jolly-up from 4 to 6 o'clock.
Dramatics Council's plan for
eliminating troublesome scalpers,
by limiting four tickets to each
person, has so far proved highly
successful. There has, as yet, been
no evidence of complaints. This is
in marked contrast with last year's
ticket sale when 1600 seats went to
an estimated 300 students—and out
siders, bringing a deluge of verbal
and written abuse upon dramatics
officers.
