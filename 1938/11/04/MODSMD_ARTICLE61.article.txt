ACCORDING to the yelpyelpyelp of metro
politan columnists, the game tomorrow
between the Indians and the Huskies will be
only the stage setting for a more dramatic battle
behind the scenes—the battle of alumni versus
coaches.
According to those same columnists, both
Coach Thornhill and Coach Phelan are stand
ing on the edge of a brink—in Stanford's case,
a "graveyard of coaches" according to one col
umnist.
These self-appointed prophets even go so
far as to predict the end of coaching careers
for the two men; with a fine show of authority,
they can list half a dozen reasons why the axe
is about to fall.
So, according to these clamoring boys, the
parade of the two coaches matches pretty well
the march of the French aristocrats to the guillo
tine in 1793.
Too bad. With the fall of the coaches, Stan
ford and Washington fall. With the defeat of
the Indians or the Huskies, grass will sprout
like mad on the campi.
Poor Stanford. Poor Washington.
Their reputations are so shaky that they rise
or fall on the work of one man—the football
coach. All the rich educational background,
all the laboratories, all the libraries, all the work
of the faculty and brilliant alumni will go for
nought if Stanford's and Washington's coaches
miss fire.
If they go, if Stanford becomes a "graveyard
of coaches," the University doors will shut with
in 24 hours, marked "out of business."
Yeah?
When the coaches fall, Stanford and Wash
ington will cease to enjoy football as a game;
rooters will go back to their books, players will
go back to their books. But if the team has lost
three games in a row, there won't be any books.
Poor Stanford. Poor Washington.
Your fate rests on whether or not Tiny or Jim
win or lose, whether they go or stay, whether
they or their successors please the meddling
columnists.
Oh yeah?
