THE first gun in California's state election was
fired on the Farm yesterday, and if Pi Sigma
Alpha's straw-vote is any indication, it means
that Sacramento, the Senate seat, and political
control, will all remain firmly in the hands of
the Grand Old Party, West Coast Local.
For despite an optimistic editorial in yester
day's Daily, Stanford definitely did not go lib
eral. It turned upon Democrats Culbert Olsen
and Sheridan Downey, ripped them up and
down, and left them lying in little pieces around
the Law Steps; it jumped on labor with both
feet; and it cast votes so large that there can be
no possible guestion of its overwhelming con
servatism.
Just why Stanford should feel called upon to
repudiate Democratic Democracy in quite such
a resounding fashion, nobody knows. Probably
the Thirty Thursday issue has much to do with
it. Possibly it is the feeling that in an election
as bare of worth-while candidates as this is, it
is better to stay with the old than experiment
with the new.
In any case, there's no doubt about it now.
The Farm's Republican, and that's that. 590
Merriam votes say so; 692 Bancroft votes agree;
and the success of the dangerously discrimina
tory "Anti-Picketing" measure clinches the ar
gument.
Nothing of state wide significance can be ar
gued from Stanford's vote. In the long run it
may be that it indicates only what it has always
indicated: that a moderate amount of wealth and
a comparative freedom from responsibility tend
to increase, rather than diminish, the influence
of conservative backgrounds.
To Pi Sigma Alpha, somewhat disgusted with
the outcome but game in the face of adversity,
congratulations on getting out the biggest straw
vote ever held on the Farm under its auspices.

Whatever else it showed, it did prove that
the Farm is wide-awake to what is going on
out there at the end of Palm Drive.—A. S. D.
