# All's Well Farewell
## 
### 
OF all the problems that face the Division
of Speech and Drama—financial, casting,
choosing plays, staging — the most pressing
one, apparently, is that of publicity.
When the curtain drops tonight on "All's
Well That Ends Well," it will close a week-long
run of one of the best productions that has come
recently to Stanford. But somehow, Stanford,
for the most part, has passed it by. Crowds
have been satisfactory, but not as good as they
would have been if size were a direct result of
the production's quality.
Tonight's the last night, and most of Stanford
has missed the show.
Why? The Division wishes it knew.
It's all a problem of publicity.
But while the problem is unsolved, Stanford
is missing a good show.
