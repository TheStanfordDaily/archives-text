### JOHN COBBS 
CUSS TIIL COSSACKS
IYI Y BROTHER, the oracle, exploded into my room
last night with a broadside of Anglo-Saxon inter
jections.
"It's a tyranny," he declaimed, scratching the match
savagely as he lit one of my cigarettes.
"What's tyranny?" I asked, repatriating the matches.
"Those filthy cossacks they call police in Menlo.
They must have been reading stories about the Ges
tapo or something. Talk about the Assyrian and the
wolf on the fold. The Assyrian's a Christian gentleman
compared to those bandits."
"You got a ticket?" I asked gently, being in no
mood for a history lecture.
"Yes. You haven't got a chance if they think you're
a student. You know those stickers on my car?"
I know the stickers well. The car is so plastered
with them that nothing but a circus lion would feel at
home inside.
"Well, I was cruising through Menlo at about 30,
and some old fossil in a Cadillac went barrelling right
past me. There was a cop parked on the corner, and
he didn't even look at the old fool. The minute he saw
my sticker, he took out after me."
There were more comments in the same vein, and
after a time the oracle departed, trailing clouds of
sulphurous language.

/ORDINARILY I accept the stories of my brother,
the oracle, only after soaking in a strong saline
solution. But in this case I have no reason to doubt
him. The record of the relations of students and the
police in the whistle stop towns between here and the
city is documented with a long list of similar incidents.
For some reason the gendarmes who lurk along
the highway seem to think that finding a Stanford stu
dent is the same thing as finding a well-filled purse.
They look on the car with a red sticker in the same
way that the children of Israel looked on the quail
that Jehovah's relief bureau sent them during one of
their messier depressions.
It is an established fact of psychology that young
drivers are on the average better than their elders.
They began at a formative age, and they have grown
up under a system of rigid natural selection. If a man
gets the idea that no highway is complete without
smoking tire marks, the chances are that he will never
arrive at college age. Those of us who do manage to
survive are wary and timid.
But the neighboring police carefully nurse the idea
that a college might as well run berserk with a meat
cleaver as get behind a wheel. To them any car with
a Stanford sticker is just another entry in the cash
receipts book.
There doesn't seem to be much we can do about it.
Society frowns on any attempt to assassinate a police
man. And we can be sure that the towns won't alter
a policy that helps so nicely to balance the budget.
All we can do is run over the comments of my brother,
the oracle; and those are not reprintable here.
