|"NTRAMURAL sports arc a fine thing. There is prac
tically no one who can say anything against them.
But they have their Hidden Secrets.
Three years ago, for instance, there was a Zete
who had a brother who was a Los Arcos. The Los
Arcos never played mural football. The Zete played
mural football very well. Me played it so well that
he not only played for the Zetcs, but he played for
the Los Arcos as well. He played so well that he got
both himself and his brother on the all-intramural
football team.
There are some people, I hear, who aren't particu
larly bothered about this no parking in the campus
after dark stuff because they have found something
else to do after-the-show-is-over. They stand under
one of the several trees along one of the several roads
in the vicinity of Lagunita and sing duets.
That should be interesting to watch now that the
rainy weather is setting in.

FITTING POEM:
You can no longer come to the campus of Lcland
Stanford Junior University and park.
After dark.
To stand under a tree and sing ducts is better.
But wetter.
\ STORY about a timid guy with a room-mate:
A friend of mine took a gal out a couplc of times
last year, and then got his room-mate a date with
her. The room-mate, in his one date, made a definite
hit.
All three of them were in the same German class.
My friend and the girl were just there, the room
mate was there making A's. Every day after the date
they had had together, the gal made a mild but public
fuss over the room-mate. He didn't like it. It used to
worry him. It wasn't what he was used to. He finally
stopped going to class because of the girl.
And flunked the course.
I was just leaving the cashier's window at the
Union the other night when I saw a friend of mine
coming toward me.
"Hello, gigolo," I said.
My friend, without looking at nic, said hello under
his breath.
But another guy, a little guy who I'll always re
member because I saw him once when he had a big
moustache, was passing on the other side of me, and
he turned with a very startled look on his face and
boomed out, "Hello."
But his parking days are over.
