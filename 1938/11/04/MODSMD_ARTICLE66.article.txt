# Lewis Pictures "The Big Four" As They Were

â€¢THE BIG FOUR," by Oscar
Lewis, on sale or for rent at the
Stanford Bookstore:
"The Big Four" is a biography of
the men, Collis P. Huntington, Le
land Stanford, Mark Hopkins, and
Charles Crocker, who built the first
transcontinental railroad, and by so
doing brought the pioneer period of
American history to a close. If the
motives ol these men had been as
high as the eventual results of the
railroad enterprise were, "The Big
Foui'" would have been a much
more elevating, but probably less
entertaining book.
There are few unbiased accounts
of the Southern Pacific Company's
activities since most of the period
icals of the time were controlled by
that company, and so praised it to
the skies. Any remaining journals
were usually subsidized by the cor
poration's enemies and knocked all
its activities, good or bad. Oscar
Lewis has managed to sift all this
biased material and presents an ac
curate yet fascinating picture of the
group's history.
The four Sacramento store-keep
ers, who rose to national prominence
were real products of the West and
of their time. Times were raw and
dubiously moral in tone. So were the
Southern Pacific's business methods.
Lewis pictures the "Big Four" as
they really were: Crocker, the bluff
man of action who supervised the
actual construction ol the road;
Stanford, the slow and accurate, who
led the company's political activities;
Uncle Mark Hopkins, a conservative
allied with plungers, who acted as a
steadying influence; and finally the
"ruthless crocodile," Huntington,
who was the group's real leader.
