# CAMPUS OPINION
## COPPERS TAKE CARE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As long as people are talking
about parking on the University
grounds, I'd like to get my bit in. I
care very little whether the admin
istration lets us park on the campus
or not. It's not very fav to the edge
of this property. But if officials are
going to continue telling the stu
dents to move on, I'd like to make a
timely suggestion.
Tell those bouncers to turn on
their red lights, not their spot
lights, when they come around.
About a week ago Stanford just
about lost an official. Lots of people
have spot-lights besides officers of
the law, and with a spot-light in
your face thugs and coppers look
just alike. Plenty of people take the
precaution, which all ought to take,
of carrying guns in their cars, and
one of these nights if our cop gets
himself air-conditioned he has no one
to blame but himself. J.D.
"The Big Four" is a "must" book
'for those who want the true facts
about California's railroad kings,
yet it can be readily recommended
for pleasure reading as well.
Many deep and weighty conclu
sions concerning the evils of mo
nopoly and capitalism could nc
doubt be drawn from Lewis' biog
raphy, but the lay reader will prob
ably reach the conclusion succinctly
expressed by Charlie Crocker him
self: "Luck had a hell of a lot tc
do with it."

pagans.
