# Cancer Diagnosis Theory Blasted, Says Dr. Hall
## Educator To Study Metabolic Disturbances To Find Disease Cure 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Recent research has blasted any hope of diagnosing cancer and other
malignant diseases by studying the metabolism reaction in suspected can
cer tissues, according to Associate Professor E. V. Hall, who participated
in this research at Cornell University last year and who will continue this
work at Stanford in thejuture, if circumstances permit.
"Research on the metabolic disturbances in malignant tissues will be
carried further at Stanford," Dr. Hall, of the biology department, revealed.

"That is, providing that Bill No. 2+
does not pass, for it would not allow I
us to experiment with animals, thus
suppressing necessary work in the
fight against cancer."
LEUKEMIA CELLS STUDIED
In regard to the research already J
done, Dr. Hall explained that there i
is a disease called "leukemia" which
is a malignancy in that it is a fatal
disease and grows unregulated. Leu
kemia cells were studied to deter
mine whether or not it would be
possible to distinguish between nor
mal and malignant cells by observing
the way in which they obtain energy.
"The typical cancer cell has two
ways of getting energy," he pointed
out. "It burns foodstuffs by means
of oxidation with the subsequent
formation of carbon dioxide and wa
ter, The other reaction, metabolism,
is when sugar is split to form lactic
acid. On the other hand, the normal
cell obtains oxygen only from the
process of oxidation.
"We studied the leukemic cells of
very small pigs and found only a
small amount,of energy derived from
the splitting of sugar; thus, there is
no sharp distinction, but rather they
are an intermediate between normal j
and typical malignant cells."
MUST CHANGE IDEAS
Dr. Hall continued, "It is now
necessary to modify our ideas con
cerning the source of energy in ma
lignant tissues, and to recognize that
the distinction between them is not
so sharp as had been believed."
Significance of the research is that
the presence or absence of splitting
sugar cannot be depended upon as a
criterion for distinguishing between
malignant and normal cells.
This means that any hope of diag
nosing cancer by the study of me
tabolism of the suspected growth is
doomed to fail, and other diagnostic
methods must be found.
