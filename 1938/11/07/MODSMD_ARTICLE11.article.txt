# Music Series To Present Violin Artist
## 
### 
Yehudi Menuhin, when he opens j
the 1938-39 Stanford Concert Series'
in Memorial Hall Wednesday, will
play selections from his immense
collection of "urtext" music. These
original editions of great violin mu
sic he studied closely during the two
year retirement from which he
emerged just last year.
From studying these original
texts, he has been able to restore
in his own performance many in
tentions of the original composers
which have since been lost.
Yehudi, who has refused the many
motion picture contracts which have
been offered him, says that not until
Hollywood comes to realize that
great music wonderfully played is
capable of holding an audience with
out being reinforced by extravaganza
stage settings and comic by-play
will he sacrifice his art for broader
public acclaim.
A few of the special seats con
structed on the stage and over the
orchestra pit arc still on sale for
Menuhin's concert at $2 and may
be called for at the Concert Series
box office, where season ticket pur
chasers also may still call for their
tickets.
