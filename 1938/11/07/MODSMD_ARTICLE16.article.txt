# Mitchell Talk Leads J.C. Convention
## Registrar Announces New Entrance Policy On Junior Transfers 
### 
"Stanford is no longer requiring j
that junior college transfers have j
completed the same work that our |
lower division students have," an
nounced Dr. J. P. Mitchell, registrar
of the University, at the convention
of the Northern California Junior
College Association here last Sat
urday.
"This is not a fundamental change
in requirements," he explained, "but
signifies our recognition of the ex
cellence of the junior college fac
ulties, and our willingness to place
more responsibility on their shoul
ders."
Dr. Mitchell addressed approxi
mately 400 delegates to the conven
tion in the Cubberly Education
Building at the opening of the morn
ing meeting.
SWAIN SPEAKS
Following a greeting presented by
Dr. Robert E. Swain, professor of
chemistry at the University, the topic
of the convention, "The Place of the
Junior College," was presented by
Dr. Dwayne Orton, principal of
Stockton Junior College, and the
presentation address was followed by
audience discussion.
Dr. Orton stressed the importance
of what he termed an "organic" basis
for the junior college. This basis,
he said, was one which grew out of
the requirements of the school, as
opposed to a basis set up with no
consideration of the requirements.
A business meeting and election of
officers followed the discussion. C. S.
Morris, of San Mateo J.C., chairman
of the Committee on Educational
Legislation, pointed out in his report
that junior colleges are charging tui
tion fees and book and lab fees "ex
tra-legally." The committee had in
vestigated, he said, and had found
that there Ls no legal provision for
the collecting of fees by junior col
leges.
NO TUITION CHARGES
"Possession of large sums of money
collected by junior colleges in this
unlegal fashion is dangerous," he
said. "It is the opinion of the com
mittee that junior colleges should
charge no tuition fees at all."
Speaking on "Private Enterprise
in the Future" at a luncheon in the
Stanford Union following the morn
ing session, Dr. George W. Dowrie,
professor of finance, predicted that
"There will be no complete sociali
zation of business in the immediate
future. Non-co-operating and dis
satisfied farm or laboring factions
can push us into socialization," he
pointed out, "but I believe that la
bor's demands are not unreasonable
and can be met with satisfaction to
both labor and business."
Dr. Grayson N. Kefauvcr, dean of
the School of Education, presided at
the luncheon.
