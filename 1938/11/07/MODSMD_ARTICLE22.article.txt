# Washington Tilt Pushes Indian To Sixth Place
## Referee Takes a Hand in Indian Defeat; Last Half Rally Fails 
### ARCH JENKINS 
With the conferencc football race now two-thirds over. Stanford rests
snugly in sixth place after losing an uphill struggle to Washington last
Saturday 10-7.
The only teams below our Indians are Washington and Washington
State, the coast door-mat with six successive losses in the circuit. Southern
California, after her devastating defeat of the Cal Bears, has one foot

inside the Rose Bowl with U.C.L.A.
as her toughest barrier to an unde
feated conference season.
But the opinion is growing and
growing that our Indians didn't do
so badly despite their mediocre per
formance in the first half against tho
Huskies. Now that the officials have
definitely taken the great American
game away from the players, it's be
ginning to look like four or five of
them may be nominated for the Ro.se
Bowl job. They haven't lost a game
in years.
WHISTLES STOP STANFORD
In at least four instances, the
whistle tooters .through sheer op
tional rulings, put Stanford in a
hole from which they couldn't
emerge. The loss in morale alotie
would be enough to lick a champion
ship team.
The worst penalty of all, of course,
was Referee Jim Blewett's pass in
terference decision which gave the
Huskies ball possession on the In
dian one-yard line. Freddie Lede
boer became all tangled up with
McDowell in reaching for a high end
zone pass that was too high for either
of them, but the interference penalty
was too much when it was apparent
that the ball couldn't be touched.
At other well-spaced intervals, the
l>oys in white stole an Indian touch
down from Hugh Gallarneau on a
i holding penalty. They ruled an in
j complete pass of Ledeboer's a fum-

ble.
CALL CLIPPING
They ruled a beautiful high-low
block by two Stanford defensive
backs as clipping. They did other
things, too, but you can't write a
thesis about them. They even har
nessed the Husky on several occa
sions.
Maybe Washington would have
won anyway; still it would be nice
to play them again with trained offi
cials instead of a quartet of dictators.
The way Washington started out,
it looked like they might roll up half
a dozen touchdowns over the weak
ened Card line. As it was they got
the gift touchdown and a legitimate
field goal before Thornhill could gel
the situation under control.
TOUCHDOWN DRIVE
Stanford once again came to life
in the second half and culminated a
great 90-yard drive with a touch
down pass to Bill Kirsch. Not a pass
was dropped in the entire sustained
drive. Bill Paulman and Freddie
Ledcboer were at their best.
Later, when Stanford fell on a
Husky lateral on the Washington 20-
yard line, a ground attack failed.
Then as the last quarter waned,
Ledcboer tossed plenty of long shots,
but he couldn't get a man cleared.
Three new Stanford stars loomed
up in the personages of Rod Par
ker at fullback, Chick Ormc at guard
and Jim Sadler at tackle. Orme and
Sadler bottled up the Huskies
through the middle while Parker,
[ subbing for Standlcc, made fine
yardage in the few times he carried
' the ball and backed up the line ex
j eeptionally well. Parker, a junior
I from Salinas, hits like a ton of bricks
j and picks his hole instead r»f plung
ing blindly ahead—a fault which too
i many of Stanford's backs can't seem
I to correct.
