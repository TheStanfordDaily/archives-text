## 
### 
Victory was sweet to the Stanford
varsity water poloists as they aver
aged an early season defeat Friday
night by soundly trouncing the
strong Olympic Club team 13 to 7 in
San Francisco.
Jumping into an early lead on
Johnny Lamb's southpaw shot in
the first two minutes of the game,
the Cardinals never relinquished the
lead and at the end, were dominat
ing the play.
Rothschild and Lawrence shared
high scoring honors with five goals
apiece, but Stanford's Plate and
Lamb were close behind with 4 and
3 respectively.
In a preliminary game, the Olym
pic Club second team defeated the
Stanford junior varsity 4 to 1 in a
hard-fought match. The only score
in the second half was a free shot
by Dave Nottage, Cardinal for
ward.

A cow shed was recently convert
ed into a theater in a small English
town.
