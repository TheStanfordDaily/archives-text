# Papooses Smash Cal In 13-7 Win
## Little Big Game Closes Season Undefeated, Untied Frosh Gridders Set Best Yearling Mark Since 1901 
### JERRY MAYER 
Frankie Albert's sturdy left arm pitched Stanford's all-conquering
freshman gridders to a l.'l-7 victory over California's Uearcub>, last Satur
day at Berkeley's Memorial Stadium before .'{s(lo funs, to finish out the
greatest season any frosli team has run up since 1901.
Saturday's win gave Coach Ilarry Shipkey's Papooses an undefeated
and untied record for the year, a feat unequaled in yearling grid history
in (he n;is) M years. Even the Vow-#

ing Sophs had a tie with Cal to
mar their frosh record.
And it was that aforementioned
southpaw wing of Albert's which
can be directly credited with Stan
ford's win over Coach Clint Evans'
Cubs. Twice Albert swung his arm
with the precision of an execution
er's axe, and twice perfect strikes
spiraled into the arms of sure-fin
gered team-mates — Fred Meyer in
the second period and Ed Wilson in
the final stanza. Cal also scored on
X pass, a 29-yard flip from Roy Ar
nold to Len Tucker.
CUB LINE HEAVY
Stanford's yearlings ran up against
a Cal team that was primed for its
best game of the season. The Cubs
had a heavy line that charged low,
breaking up any Papoose attempt at
power, and a pair of ends in Ray
Amling and Carl Leipzig, who could
step into varsity berths right now.
Amling and Leipzig were on Al
bert's tail all day, especially when
he faded back to pass. Time and
again they set him down for losses
before he could get rid of the ball,
and it took a whole interference to
get them out of the way on running
plays.
But Stanford has its defensive
stars too, and not the least of them
was Jack Francis, line - backing
quarterback, who filled up the holes
in Stanford's line like an All-Amer
ican. Repeatedly, Francis' jarring
tackles held Cub backs to short gains
as they drifted through wide holes
in the line. Wink Jones, right
tackle, was another defensive pillar,
refusing to let Cal's avalanche of
power move him from his patch.
CARDS SCORE
Stanford made its initial tally
early in the second quarter, after
Albert had gotten off a sensational
57-yard punt, which Arnold took on
his 8 and ran back 16 yards to Cal's
24. On third down Dick Folmer.
Cub quarter, fell back to punt but
Ed Wilson broke through like a
flash from his left end position and
blocked the boot, which rolled out
of bounds on the 25.
On the next play Albert started to
circle his left end. suddenly stopped
and pitched a high, lazy pass diag
onally across the grid to Fred Meyer,
right end, who had streaked down
the right side line into the end zone.
Meyer took the high pass over the
head of Folmer for the score.
The Papooses got their second
scoring opportunity when Arnold
fumbled Albert's long punt, and
Yank Levin recovered on Cal's 15.
Albert went through left tackle for
eight yards, then threw a shovel
pass to Sturgeon, which lost a yard.
On third down, Albert started to
circle his own right end, but Leipzig
refused to be blocked out of the
play. After a couple of Stanford
interferers had bounced off the Cub
end, Albert decided that maybe that
side of the line was unhealthy so he
doubled back, only to find himself
swamped by Cub linemen.
THROWS PASS
Then, out of a blue sky, he stop
ped and whipped a pass to Wilson,
standing by himself in the end zone.
It was a truly spectacular bit of
thinking on Frankie's part. He then
converted.
Cal scored late in the final period,
when Francis fumbled and Hayden,
sub tackle, recovered for California
on the Card 13. After a penalty had
set Cal back to the 29, Arnold threw
a beautiful pass to Tucker in the
end zone, and McQuarry converted.

played in the 1938 Little Big Game

Ends, Burt L. Talcott, Fred D.
Meyer, Edgar B. Wilson; tackles,
Francis M. Radditz, Winford M.

end, Albert decided that maybe that
side of the line was unhealthy so he
doubled back, only to find himself
swamped by Cub linemen.
THROWS PASS
Then, out of a blue sky, he stop
ped and whipped a pass to Wilson,
standing by himself in the end zone.
It was a truly spectacular bit of
thinking on Frankie's part. He then
converted.
Cal scored late in the final period,
when Francis fumbled and Hayden,
sub tackle, recovered for California
on the Card 13. After a penalty had
set Cal back to the 29, Arnold threw
a beautiful pass to Tucker in the
end zone, and McQuarry converted.
The honor roll of Papooses who
played in the 1938 Little Big Game
is as follows:
Ends, Burt L. Talcott, Fred D.
Meyer, Edgar B. Wilson; tackles,
Francis M. Radditz, Winford M.
Jones, Lawrence R. Partridge;

Patterson, Jacob Levin; centers,

Frankie Albert's sturdy left arm pitched Stanford's all-conquering
freshman gridders to a l.'l-7 victory over California's Uearcub>, last Satur
day at Berkeley's Memorial Stadium before .'{s(lo funs, to finish out the
greatest season any frosli team has run up since 1901.
Saturday's win gave Coach Ilarry Shipkey's Papooses an undefeated
and untied record for the year, a feat unequaled in yearling grid history
in (he n;is) M years. Even the Vow-#

ing Sophs had a tie with Cal to
mar their frosh record.
And it was that aforementioned
southpaw wing of Albert's which
can be directly credited with Stan
ford's win over Coach Clint Evans'
Cubs. Twice Albert swung his arm
with the precision of an execution
er's axe, and twice perfect strikes
spiraled into the arms of sure-fin
gered team-mates — Fred Meyer in
the second period and Ed Wilson in
the final stanza. Cal also scored on
X pass, a 29-yard flip from Roy Ar
nold to Len Tucker.
CUB LINE HEAVY
Stanford's yearlings ran up against
a Cal team that was primed for its
best game of the season. The Cubs
had a heavy line that charged low,
breaking up any Papoose attempt at
power, and a pair of ends in Ray
Amling and Carl Leipzig, who could
step into varsity berths right now.
Amling and Leipzig were on Al
bert's tail all day, especially when
he faded back to pass. Time and
again they set him down for losses
before he could get rid of the ball,
and it took a whole interference to
get them out of the way on running
plays.
But Stanford has its defensive
stars too, and not the least of them
was Jack Francis, line - backing
quarterback, who filled up the holes
in Stanford's line like an All-Amer
ican. Repeatedly, Francis' jarring
tackles held Cub backs to short gains
as they drifted through wide holes
in the line. Wink Jones, right
tackle, was another defensive pillar,
refusing to let Cal's avalanche of
power move him from his patch.
CARDS SCORE
Stanford made its initial tally
early in the second quarter, after
Albert had gotten off a sensational
57-yard punt, which Arnold took on
his 8 and ran back 16 yards to Cal's
24. On third down Dick Folmer.
Cub quarter, fell back to punt but
Ed Wilson broke through like a
flash from his left end position and
blocked the boot, which rolled out
of bounds on the 25.
On the next play Albert started to
circle his left end. suddenly stopped
and pitched a high, lazy pass diag
onally across the grid to Fred Meyer,
right end, who had streaked down
the right side line into the end zone.
Meyer took the high pass over the
head of Folmer for the score.
The Papooses got their second
scoring opportunity when Arnold
fumbled Albert's long punt, and
Yank Levin recovered on Cal's 15.
Albert went through left tackle for
eight yards, then threw a shovel
pass to Sturgeon, which lost a yard.
On third down, Albert started to
circle his own right end, but Leipzig

CARDS SCORE
Stanford made its initial tally
early in the second quarter, after
Albert had gotten off a sensational
57-yard punt, which Arnold took on
his 8 and ran back 16 yards to Cal's
24. On third down Dick Folmer.
Cub quarter, fell back to punt but
Ed Wilson broke through like a
flash from his left end position and
blocked the boot, which rolled out
of bounds on the 25.
On the next play Albert started to
circle his left end. suddenly stopped
and pitched a high, lazy pass diag
onally across the grid to Fred Meyer,
right end, who had streaked down
the right side line into the end zone.
Meyer took the high pass over the
head of Folmer for the score.
The Papooses got their second
scoring opportunity when Arnold
fumbled Albert's long punt, and
Yank Levin recovered on Cal's 15.
Albert went through left tackle for
eight yards, then threw a shovel
pass to Sturgeon, which lost a yard.
On third down, Albert started to
circle his own right end, but Leipzig
refused to be blocked out of the
play. After a couple of Stanford
interferers had bounced off the Cub
end, Albert decided that maybe that
side of the line was unhealthy so he
doubled back, only to find himself
swamped by Cub linemen.
THROWS PASS
Then, out of a blue sky, he stop
ped and whipped a pass to Wilson,
standing by himself in the end zone.
It was a truly spectacular bit of
thinking on Frankie's part. He then
converted.
Cal scored late in the final period,
when Francis fumbled and Hayden,
sub tackle, recovered for California
on the Card 13. After a penalty had
set Cal back to the 29, Arnold threw
a beautiful pass to Tucker in the
end zone, and McQuarry converted.

Frankie Albert's sturdy left arm pitched Stanford's all-conquering
freshman gridders to a l.'l-7 victory over California's Uearcub>, last Satur
day at Berkeley's Memorial Stadium before .'{s(lo funs, to finish out the
greatest season any frosli team has run up since 1901.
Saturday's win gave Coach Ilarry Shipkey's Papooses an undefeated
and untied record for the year, a feat unequaled in yearling grid history
in (he n;is) M years. Even the Vow-#

ing Sophs had a tie with Cal to
mar their frosh record.
And it was that aforementioned
southpaw wing of Albert's which
can be directly credited with Stan
ford's win over Coach Clint Evans'
Cubs. Twice Albert swung his arm
with the precision of an execution
er's axe, and twice perfect strikes
spiraled into the arms of sure-fin
gered team-mates — Fred Meyer in
the second period and Ed Wilson in
the final stanza. Cal also scored on
X pass, a 29-yard flip from Roy Ar
nold to Len Tucker.
CUB LINE HEAVY
Stanford's yearlings ran up against
a Cal team that was primed for its
best game of the season. The Cubs
had a heavy line that charged low,
breaking up any Papoose attempt at
power, and a pair of ends in Ray
Amling and Carl Leipzig, who could
step into varsity berths right now.
Amling and Leipzig were on Al
bert's tail all day, especially when
he faded back to pass. Time and
again they set him down for losses
before he could get rid of the ball,
and it took a whole interference to
get them out of the way on running
plays.
But Stanford has its defensive
stars too, and not the least of them
was Jack Francis, line - backing
quarterback, who filled up the holes
in Stanford's line like an All-Amer
ican. Repeatedly, Francis' jarring
tackles held Cub backs to short gains
as they drifted through wide holes
in the line. Wink Jones, right
tackle, was another defensive pillar,
refusing to let Cal's avalanche of
power move him from his patch.
