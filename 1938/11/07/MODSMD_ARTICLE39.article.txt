It's like flunking an ex you i
thought you'd cooled to be penalized j
when your team is going strong in a
football game. But in the U.C.L.A. j
game and Saturday's 60-minute
grid-rule debate with University of
Washington, Stanford's gridders
showed themselves too big to let 15-
yard set-backs take the wind out of
their sails.
And Saturday's penalties were, at j
times, so doubtful that it looked as ;
though the referee and head lines
man should have been wearing ,
Washington uniforms. Yet most of !
the decisions were hard ones, and ;
the officials could have found rules
to form their defense. But just let
them prove that Calvelli's block—he
always blocks from the side — was
clipping from behind.

nriNY THORNHILL has devel
oped the greatest passing at- I
tack Stanford has ever seen—and j
the Washington game proved it. i
Early in every game, a signal- ;
caller has to feel his way around !
to find out what plays will work j
best against the opponents. Stan- ;
ford did just that Saturday, and {
found that what the Golden Bears
and many other teams had dis
covered was true — the Huskies i
have a fine pass defense.

But one thing that will pene
trate good pass defense is an aerial
attack that no defensive tactics
can break up. Stanford had just
that.

Photo finishes are becoming com
mon in Stanford football games. The
Cards' last-minute drive down the
field looked like a repeat perform
ance of the last 32 seconds of the
U.C.L.A. game until Freddie Lede
boer called a place-kick. We all
wonder what would have happened
if he had let that down-field drive
continue. But Paulman could make
nine out of ten place-kicks good at
32 yards, and the signal-caller had
a choice between a possible victory
and what looked like a sure tie.
* * *
Punts and punt returns were
long suits in the Cardinal hand.
Bill Paulman, the man whose
name in the starting line-up
brought comfort to Stanford root
ers, carried a pair of well-padded
charley horses around for (!0 min
utes —we thought he'd be good for
only 30 —and put on a kicking
performance that made Johnston,
Washington's highly-touted hoot
er, only a runner-up in the race
for Coast punting honors. And
Johnston was kicking with the
wind nearly every time. Paulman
also did a fine job of backing up
the line.
Shades of Jimmy Coflis appeared
Saturday when Ledeboer played
again at safety. He added yardage
to punt returns by catching the
ball on the run nearly every
time.

Washington's left tackle was reap
ing havoc with the Card backfield
when Billy Kirsch went into the
game. But Stanford's burly halfback
soon put the tackle in his place, and
Indian gridders made the drive that
ended in a scoring pass received by
Kirsch right next to the end zone.
Chick Orme and Jim Sadler de
serve credit for plugging up the
Cardinal defense against the Husky
short-side plays. Instructions had
been given before the game, and
they did a good job of following
them.

Photo finishes are becoming com
mon in Stanford football games. The
Cards' last-minute drive down the
field looked like a repeat perform
ance of the last 32 seconds of the
U.C.L.A. game until Freddie Lede
boer called a place-kick. We all
wonder what would have happened
if he had let that down-field drive
continue. But Paulman could make
nine out of ten place-kicks good at
32 yards, and the signal-caller had
a choice between a possible victory
and what looked like a sure tie.

Punts and punt returns were
long suits in the Cardinal hand.
Bill Paulman, the man whose
name in the starting line-up
brought comfort to Stanford root
ers, carried a pair of well-padded
charley horses around for (!0 min
utes —we thought he'd be good for
only 30 —and put on a kicking
performance that made Johnston,
Washington's highly-touted hoot
er, only a runner-up in the race
for Coast punting honors. And
Johnston was kicking with the
wind nearly every time. Paulman
also did a fine job of backing up
the line.
Shades of Jimmy Coflis appeared
Saturday when Ledeboer played
again at safety. He added yardage
to punt returns by catching the
ball on the run nearly every
time.

Washington's left tackle was reap
ing havoc with the Card backfield
when Billy Kirsch went into the
game. But Stanford's burly halfback
soon put the tackle in his place, and
Indian gridders made the drive that
ended in a scoring pass received by
Kirsch right next to the end zone.
