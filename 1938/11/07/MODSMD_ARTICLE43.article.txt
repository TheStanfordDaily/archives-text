Winning their game once in the
first quarter, then pulling it out of
the fire in the last period, the Stan
ford frosh soccer aggregation show
ed real scoring punch and defensive
power in defeating the Menlo J. C.
team 2 goals to 1 Friday afternoon

Playing with the wind at their
backs in the first half, the baby
Cards went great guns on offense,
finally tallying on a straight shot
by Dick Compton.
In the early second half the Menlo
forward wall began functioning and
pressed the Stanford defense close
to goal, finally scoring on a follow
up shot that went in from close
range.
Fighting to regain the lead again,
the Papooses countered with an at
tack that came close to scoring
time and again, culminating with a
beautiful goal shot by Lee Cham
pion. The goal was the deciding
tally, neither team threatening
again.
