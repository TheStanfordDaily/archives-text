# Varsity Wins Soccer Tilt At S.F.J.C.
## 
### 
Showing now offensive power that i
worked on equal terms with the de- !
fensive line, the Stanford soccer
varsity completely outplayed and
outscored a team from San Fran
cisco Junior College, 2 to 0. Satur
day morning on the Jaysee home
Held.
Playing on a dry field, with a!
heavy wind blowing, the Cards
were able to convert on two of their
scoring drives, while holding the rival
scoring wall powerless.
The forwards were aggressive and
showed fine offensive teamwork,!
working the opposing fullbacks
heavily throughout the game. Many I
more tries for a score were nullified j
by scant misses, and by the heavy
wind.
The defense functioned in the
same sterling manner that has char
acterized the Indian backs through
out the season. Outstanding were
Munser in goal, Cuthbertson, Ham- 1
ilton, Edwards in the backfield.
The first score came in the first
quarter. Gunther Gerbstedt, play
ing in the center forward position,
followed up a goal kick to boot the
ball past the goalkeeper for the
tally.
George Dole, playing in his sec
ond starting game, entered the lime
light in the third quarter when he
took the ball on a pass from Chris
Santum and placed it cleanly through
the uprights for the final score of
the day.
The entire forward wall showed
to excellence. Very few mistakes in
teamwork were apparent.
The win over the Jaysee team
means that the Stanford varsity has
a fighting chance to even the score
against the California Bears, who
still lead the league.
