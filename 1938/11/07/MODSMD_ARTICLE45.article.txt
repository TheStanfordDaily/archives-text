, KEZAR STADIUM, San Fran
cisco, Nov. G (UP). — Undefeated,
untied Santa Clara University won
its sixteenth straight football game
today by finally wearing down a sur
prisingly stubborn and alert San
Francisco University team, 7 to 0.
The big red Santa Clara Bronco
team — lacking vicious blocking and
charge in the first half—regained its
balance in the third period for the
only touchdown march of a desper
ately fought game.
