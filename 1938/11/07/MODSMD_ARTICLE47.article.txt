WHEN syllabus fees began to filter into the
mails this week-end, it didn't take long
for Stanford to notice an additional fifty-cent
charge on every bill entitled "Library."
And it didn't take long for the howl to rise.
In answer today, Nathan van Patten, Director
of University Libraries, explains the reason for
the unprecedented charge, explains it concretely
and completely.
And after all is said for and against the
charge, the final words—"lt had to be done"—
settle the problem. Whether in principle or in
practice charges should be made for a univer
sity facility like the library may be debatable,
but in the end, discussion amounts only to
philosophical contemplation beside the main
issue of economic necessity.
The problem which faced the Board of Trus
tees and the library when they made the charge
was one of long standing; the new turn which
it has taken is only the culmination of a com
bination of circumstances. While Stanford has
been growing in size, particularly in late years,
the library has been forced to remain economi
cally restricted. It has reached the point now
where it must take special measures to keep
up with Stanford, if possible, to pull abreast of
Stanford's needs.
The justification of the charge, however, will
come not from arguments but from the service
for which it pays. Stanford's library now has
reached the limits of the service which its
former financial means allowed, nor can the
budget be overloaded further to meet those re
quirements. Expansion is imperative.
No longer can the library facilities be part of
the birthright which the University sells for
$115. As it already pays for another University
building—Memorial Hall—Stanford must aid in
supporting the services which it demands —
those which the library has offered without
charge hitherto.
The lag between growth of demand and
growth of library facilities has gone far enough.
The gap must be closed.
And the syllabus fee method is the only way
to do it.
