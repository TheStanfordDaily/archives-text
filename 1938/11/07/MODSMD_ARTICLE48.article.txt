# Democracy Gone Crack-Pot
## 
### 
IN the face of political back-slapping and band
wagon tactics, it would appear that the
people of California do not recognize that a
greater problem than any individual legislative
measure faces them on Tuesday's ballot.
That problem is greater than "Ham and Eggs,"
is greater than anti-vivisection. It involves the
thought that perhaps Democracy has gone too
far overboard in allowing such measures to
arise for public consideration.
It is ridiculous that any small group could be
presumptuous enough to set itself up in judg
ment of centuries of successful medical re
search and practice.
It will be even more ridiculous if California
as a whole concurs in that judgment against the
denouncements of trained medical men. And
such concurrence will not be democracy —it
will be close to tyranny.
It is because of this and other such measures,
that President Wilbur has been led to suggest
that legislators arid trained consultants are far
better qualified for law-making than is the pub
lic, for the public is more likely to believe in
"let-there-be-light-from-God" publicity than they
are.
At this point, it is impossible for anyone to
predict the outcome of Tuesday's election. Per
haps, the situation is not as bad as it would
appear.
But, when the counting is all over Tuesday
night, it's sure to be known whether Democracy
has blown its first fuse in California. —H. L. S.
