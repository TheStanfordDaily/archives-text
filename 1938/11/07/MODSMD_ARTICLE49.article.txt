# Tax on Camels' Backs
## 
### 
WHEN five members of the Econ Department
refused one after another last Thursday to
comment upon Proposition No. 20, the so-called
"Single Tax," it became apparent that the issue
involved is not as simple as it sounds.
Unanimously agreed that the Thirty Thursday
is unsound, the professors could not come to
similar agreement on a measure whose oppo
nents have used against it every appeal to
prejudice which has been in vogue since Henry
George first proposed that taxes be reduced to
a single levy upon land.
Perhaps Professor Elmer Fagan best summed
up the Department's attitude when he stated
that if he were to give advice he would say vote
against it, but if he were to undertake a thor

ough discussion of it he would not be so sure.
In the long run it might be beneficial; in the
short run he could not predict. It would take
complete freedom from politics and long and
careful administration to make it work.
And there Professor Fagan put his finger on
the bill's chief weakness; the need for freedom
from politics, scarcely possible under the Amer
ican system, and a careful administration, which
is rarely achieved in the day of governmental
quick-tricks.
If it were an open-and-shut bill like the Thirty
Thursday, if it were either good or bad and not
ambiguously dependent upon its operation—
then it might be possible to vote for or against
it with a clear conscience. But in its present
state it evidently is not solid enough to merit
support by the state's voters. It will repeal the
sales tax —a valuable habit, easy to take—and
will substitute for it a tax procedure which
might—if all goes well—prove of benefit to the
state.
If everything the more vocal portions of the
populace want goes through tomorrow, Califor
nia is going to have worries enough without the
added burden of a violent change in her basic
tax structure. —A. S. D.
