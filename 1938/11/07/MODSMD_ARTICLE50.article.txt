GHOST STORIES
ABOUT this time last fall, I got a badly-mimeo
graphed letter from a "ghost writer" who offered
to handle my term papers and essays "for a considera
tion." Glowing with idealism, I pounded out a scorch
ing column declaring that Stanford was a poor market
for intellectual prostitution. I mailed the creature a
copy, and sat back feeling like a Hebrew prophet who
had just told off the idolators with a particularly in
spired sermon.
Yesterday, another letter came in from the ghost
writer. It informed me that if I hurry and establish
"working contacts" at once, I will be able to get the
prompt service and minimum rates of a steady cus
tomer.
Ordinarily I could take the letter in my stride, like
unclean words chalked on a fence. But when it comes
on top of tragedies like the refereeing at last Satur
day's football game, and the new library charge in
the syllabus fees, I find my faith in humanity wavering.
* # * *
Even the alumni don't pretend that the average
Stanford student is a genius, but most of us trust the
aptitude tests at least to keep out the village idiots.
It is disheartening to find that our ghost writer con
siders Stanford stupid enough to trade with him. And
it is doubly saddening to think that his experience
with us last year encouraged him to make a second
attempt.
I find it hard to believe that any man could be so
completely paralyzed above the ears that he would
pay $115 a quarter to get an education and would then
scrape up a "consideration" to insulate himself against
learning anything.
# * * *
'"PHE ghost writer, of course, is a pedigreed heel.
And to have reached such a state of perfection,
he must have come from a long line of sly little beasts.
Probably he is a direct descendant of Rigoletlo, and
undoubtedly his ancestors hung around the Borgias'
court, thinking up new poisons, but never able to
scrape together enough nerve to use them personally.
The ghost writer crawls about in the dark and
speaks with furtive double-meaning, like a thief try
ing to market stolen goods. On the evolutionary scale,
he is ranged by everything but the jellyfish and flat
worms.
* * 4 *
But the ghost writer himself does no more than
give us a vaguely uncomfortable feeling in the stomach,
as though we had run into an unpleasant odor. The
real danger comes from the students who trade with
him. No university can protect itself from men who
are so stupid that they think it. clever to cheat their
fellows and throw away their own tuition money.
My Sunday school training was strong, and so I
still have enough faith in man to believe that the
ghost writer has found a lean market at Stanford. If
he hasn't, the best thing to do would be to give the
Farm back to the racehorses and save our money.

scrape up a "consideration" to insulate himself against

'"PHE ghost writer, of course, is a pedigreed heel.
And to have reached such a state of perfection,
he must have come from a long line of sly little beasts.
Probably he is a direct descendant of Rigoletlo, and
undoubtedly his ancestors hung around the Borgias'
court, thinking up new poisons, but never able to
scrape together enough nerve to use them personally.
The ghost writer crawls about in the dark and
speaks with furtive double-meaning, like a thief try
ing to market stolen goods. On the evolutionary scale,
he is ranged by everything but the jellyfish and flat
worms.

But the ghost writer himself does no more than
give us a vaguely uncomfortable feeling in the stomach,
as though we had run into an unpleasant odor. The
real danger comes from the students who trade with
him. No university can protect itself from men who
are so stupid that they think it. clever to cheat their
fellows and throw away their own tuition money.
My Sunday school training was strong, and so I
still have enough faith in man to believe that the
ghost writer has found a lean market at Stanford. If
he hasn't, the best thing to do would be to give the
Farm back to the racehorses and save our money.
GHOST STORIES
ABOUT this time last fall, I got a badly-mimeo
graphed letter from a "ghost writer" who offered
to handle my term papers and essays "for a considera
tion." Glowing with idealism, I pounded out a scorch
ing column declaring that Stanford was a poor market
for intellectual prostitution. I mailed the creature a
copy, and sat back feeling like a Hebrew prophet who
had just told off the idolators with a particularly in
spired sermon.
Yesterday, another letter came in from the ghost
writer. It informed me that if I hurry and establish
"working contacts" at once, I will be able to get the
prompt service and minimum rates of a steady cus
tomer.
Ordinarily I could take the letter in my stride, like
unclean words chalked on a fence. But when it comes
on top of tragedies like the refereeing at last Satur
day's football game, and the new library charge in
the syllabus fees, I find my faith in humanity wavering.
* # * *
Even the alumni don't pretend that the average
Stanford student is a genius, but most of us trust the
aptitude tests at least to keep out the village idiots.
It is disheartening to find that our ghost writer con
siders Stanford stupid enough to trade with him. And
it is doubly saddening to think that his experience
with us last year encouraged him to make a second
attempt.
I find it hard to believe that any man could be so
completely paralyzed above the ears that he would
pay $115 a quarter to get an education and would then
scrape up a "consideration" to insulate himself against
learning anything.
