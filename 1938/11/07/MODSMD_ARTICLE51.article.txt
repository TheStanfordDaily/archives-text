### DOUG JAQUES 
A BEAUTIFUL thing happened in one of Palo Alto's
hamburger joints iifter the dance Saturday. I'm
sorry I didn't see it.
The place was crowded, and everyone was making
a terrific lot of noise. All of a sudden they all quieted
down.
Just in time to hear one guy whimper to his gal,
"But you always order onions."
it # * ❖
A hunch of people were talking rather unin
terestingly the other clay and to fill in a lull a gal
mentioned that a guy she knew was very nosey.
A friend of mine who is a had comedian asked her •
if she meant that her friend had a hig nose.
"Well, that's not what I meant, hut he does
have a hig nose." ■£
"What's his name?" my friend asked. "Cyrano
de Bergcrac?"
"I don't knjjw him very well," she said. "I don't
know what his name is."
* * * *
At, the Soph Cotillion a friend of mine lost his
coat check. He found that he had lost it about 11:30
o'clock when he got in line early to get his (and/or
his gal's) coat. He was almost up to the window when
he was convinced that he didn't have it. Thinking very
fast, and very badly, he furtively picked up a check
from the floor and confidently handed it to the hat
check guy.
It. didn't make any difference, of course, but he
hadn't even picked up a cost check. He had picked
up a hat check.
* * * *
(> UT of the hltic at the dance Friday night a
guy and a gal rame up to me and explained
that they did not stand under trees at nights sing
ing duets. They sat on a fence and sang duets.
Well.
* * * *
I printed a story here Friday about a gal who
drove a guy out of a German class last year with a
little obvious and public attention. I hear she trans
ferred to Washington this year. I also hear she came
down for the game.
If she read Friday's Daily, I'll probably hear about
that. too.
But it was something of a home-coming.

At, the Soph Cotillion a friend of mine lost his
coat check. He found that he had lost it about 11:30
o'clock when he got in line early to get his (and/or
his gal's) coat. He was almost up to the window when
he was convinced that he didn't have it. Thinking very
fast, and very badly, he furtively picked up a check
from the floor and confidently handed it to the hat
check guy.
It. didn't make any difference, of course, but he
hadn't even picked up a cost check. He had picked
up a hat check.

(> UT of the hltic at the dance Friday night a
guy and a gal rame up to me and explained
that they did not stand under trees at nights sing
ing duets. They sat on a fence and sang duets.
Well.

I printed a story here Friday about a gal who
drove a guy out of a German class last year with a
little obvious and public attention. I hear she trans
ferred to Washington this year. I also hear she came
down for the game.
If she read Friday's Daily, I'll probably hear about
that. too.
But it was something of a home-coming.
