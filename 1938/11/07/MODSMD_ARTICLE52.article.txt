# Ballet Form Americanized By Dancers
## 
### 
THE BALLET CARAVAN,
opening concert on the San Jose j
Concert Series.
A welcome step toward what will
eventually be an American ballet
was taken last Saturday night with
the staging of "Filling Station" and
"Billy the Kid" by a troupe of what
looked like a couple of dozen nat-

urally average
young men and
women who love
to dance.
That step was
taken in no un
orthodox attempt
at cheap popular
ization, either. It
was taken as a
nat ural adapta
tion of a classic

art form to fit a modern need. The
Ballet Caravan presented ballet in
a pure form, resorting not to trick- j
ery but to legitimate modernization I
—and made an average American j
audience understand it and like it.
MODERN THEME
In search of a modern tale, the
Ballet Caravan has built what they J
term a "ballet-document" about a
lively filling station attendant, a
motorist in plus-4's, his peroxided
wife, a pair of rowdy truck drivers,
and an imperious highway patrol- j
man. As a touch of reality, they i
even included the motorist's little j
daughter, who found it immediately j
necessary to go to the little girl's
room.
The modern theme was a happy |
thought. The dancers knew what j
they were doing, and so, remarkably, j
did the audience. Mac, the attend- j
ant, was a model service man, stack
ing his road maps, polishing the
equipment. The motorist, high spot !
of the show, dressed in a wonderful !
purple coat and yellow knickers'
with green leggings, was properly j
hen-pecked and convincingly lost. \
The truckmen, as we have said, were i
rowdy.
BILLY EXCELLENT
"Billy the Kid" was undoubtedly
the best staged of the two ballets.
A "character-ballet," it is designed
to present the life of a man who is
as much a piece of America as is i
burlesque. Billy was excellently pre- :
sented, killing viciously, a fiendish
smile stretched over his teeth, and
dying hunted and defiant.
As to the dancers themselves, it
would be difficult to name any one
who stood out above the others.
Harold Christensen, as the motor
ist, presented his character with
gross comedy. Eugene Loring as the
Kid, Lew Christensen as the at
tendant, and Fred Danielli exhib
ited probably the best command of
their art.
CONVINCING PERFORMANCE
Marjorie Moore, who looked like
the lovely blonde in Poly Sci 1, or
any other class, and Gisella Caccia
lanza, everybody's ideal of Latin
beauty, shared honors among the
women. They were the high spot in
an otherwise unfortunate attempt at
classic ballet, presented as the first
number on the program, danced to
music by Bach.
But the whole troupe was fine.
They presented a convincing per
formance of ballet which leaves us
sure that there is a future in Amer
ican ballet—the time is not far off
when it will take its place as a vital
part of the American theater.—Burtt

The newest sport, of the 20ih cen
tury is motorcycling. It started in
Belgium in the early 1900's.

gross comedy. Eugene Loring as the
Kid, Lew Christensen as the at
tendant, and Fred Danielli exhib
ited probably the best command of
their art.
CONVINCING PERFORMANCE
Marjorie Moore, who looked like
the lovely blonde in Poly Sci 1, or
any other class, and Gisella Caccia
lanza, everybody's ideal of Latin
beauty, shared honors among the
women. They were the high spot in
an otherwise unfortunate attempt at
classic ballet, presented as the first
number on the program, danced to
music by Bach.
But the whole troupe was fine.
They presented a convincing per
formance of ballet which leaves us
sure that there is a future in Amer
ican ballet—the time is not far off
when it will take its place as a vital
part of the American theater.—Burtt

Thumbs Up
THE BALLET CARAVAN,
opening concert on the San Jose j
Concert Series.
A welcome step toward what will
eventually be an American ballet
was taken last Saturday night with
the staging of "Filling Station" and
"Billy the Kid" by a troupe of what
looked like a couple of dozen nat-

urally average
young men and
women who love
to dance.
That step was
taken in no un
orthodox attempt
at cheap popular
ization, either. It
was taken as a
nat ural adapta
tion of a classic

art form to fit a modern need. The
Ballet Caravan presented ballet in
a pure form, resorting not to trick- j
ery but to legitimate modernization I
—and made an average American j
audience understand it and like it.
MODERN THEME
In search of a modern tale, the
Ballet Caravan has built what they J
term a "ballet-document" about a
lively filling station attendant, a
motorist in plus-4's, his peroxided
wife, a pair of rowdy truck drivers,
and an imperious highway patrol- j
man. As a touch of reality, they i
even included the motorist's little j
daughter, who found it immediately j
necessary to go to the little girl's
room.
The modern theme was a happy |
thought. The dancers knew what j
they were doing, and so, remarkably, j
did the audience. Mac, the attend- j
ant, was a model service man, stack
ing his road maps, polishing the
equipment. The motorist, high spot !
of the show, dressed in a wonderful !
purple coat and yellow knickers'
with green leggings, was properly j
hen-pecked and convincingly lost. \
The truckmen, as we have said, were i
rowdy.
BILLY EXCELLENT
"Billy the Kid" was undoubtedly
the best staged of the two ballets.
A "character-ballet," it is designed
to present the life of a man who is
as much a piece of America as is i
burlesque. Billy was excellently pre- :
sented, killing viciously, a fiendish
smile stretched over his teeth, and
dying hunted and defiant.
As to the dancers themselves, it
would be difficult to name any one
who stood out above the others.
Harold Christensen, as the motor
ist, presented his character with
gross comedy. Eugene Loring as the
Kid, Lew Christensen as the at
tendant, and Fred Danielli exhib
ited probably the best command of
their art.
