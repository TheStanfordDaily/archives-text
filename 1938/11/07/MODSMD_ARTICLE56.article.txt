DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT
The Editor, Sir:
Of all the weak-kneed and insig
nificant arguments in favor of the
transferability of student - body
cards, the one that claims they are
the property of the owners and
therefore may be used as the own
ers see fit is undoubtedly the weak
est. Now it doesn't make much dif
ference to me what the Excom de
cides, but I do think in making its
decision it should not be fooled by
catch-arguments instead of funda
mental facts.
Actually, it is not a question of
whether we have the privilege of
handing someone else our cards, but
a question of who shall sit in the
Stanford rooting section: Stanford
students only or friends and rela
tives of those Stanford students who
could not get to the game them
selves.
As far as the personal-property
conception of student body cards ar
gument goes, the school has the ab
solute authority to issue them with
any conditions it chooses to attach
to them. Furthermore, it has the
right to see that those conditions arc
held toâ€”as we unhappily saw last
1 Saturday at Los Angeles.
So don't mistake the issue at hand
it's not, "Can we loan our little or
ange cards?" but "Who will sit ir
Stanford's student rooters' seats al
the football games?"
