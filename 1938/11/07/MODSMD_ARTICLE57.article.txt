# ALARM ALARMS SLEEPER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It happened that because of sev- i
eral excellent reasons (chiefly finan- I
cial) I retired last Saturday night at !
the unnaturally early hour of 11:30. j
Al least it would appear that this is |
considered unnatural by certain ob- j
jectionable members of an other- [
wise estimable freshman class. In j
fact, it would appear that slumber j
indulged in by others at any hour
other than that which the objection
able ones so use is unnatural.
To those of you who do not live
within the unsanctified walls of En
cina it may be advisable to inform
you of the fact that I am referring
to the ringing of fire alarms, which
pastime takes place with consider
able frequency, particularly on
week-end nights. Saturday, for in
stance, they were set off at various

| times between midnight and 2:30,
i and not for only a few seconds' dura-
I tion but for periods of as long as
| ten minutes.
FIRE DANGER
Now, I am not only objecting be
! cause this is exceedingly annoying,
i but also because of the possible
i danger involved. Encina is not pre
| cisely a fireproof building, and it is
\ not a flight of fancy to assume that
some day it may catch on fixe.
But, if all the inhabitants have
been conditioned to stick their heads
| under their respective blankets at
; the sound of the gong in an attempt
! to recapture the pleasures of the

rapidly departing slumber, it is pos
sible that a goodly number will be
cremated on that eventful day.
ACTION ASKED
In short, I believe it should be im
pressed upon the freshman mind
(and here again I do not refer to the
entire class) that fire alarms are not
playthings. However, I do not sup
pose that any action will be taken
at this time. I fear tliat the admin
istration will wait until something
serious really occurs, at which time
it will gently hint to the freshmen
that mavbe thev had better refrain
from such activity in the future.
