# Van Patten Explains Fee For Library
## Trustee Board Acts On Recommendation Of President Wilbur 
### 
In explanation of syllabus fee of 50
cents charged to all students for use
of the Stanford library, Nathan Van
Patten, director of University libra
ries, issued the following statement:
"In 1927-28 the University libra
ries contained 491,256 volumes. Dur
ing this same period the circulation
of books has increased from 192,179
volumes to 356,547 volumes a year.
There have been many additions to
the curricula and an increase in the
size of both staff and student body.
"The University has been aware of I
the steadily increasing demand
which has been made upon its library
facilities and this demand has been
met as far as possible by the Board
of Trustees and the President. Every
possible effort has been made by the
library staff to give the finest pos
sible service under rather difficult
circumstances. The past decade has
not been a period in which budgets
could be substantially increased.
PRESIDENT SUGGESTS
"The Board of Trustees upon the
recommendation of the President
has established a library syllabus fee
of 50 cents a quarter. This fee does
not apply to students registered in
the School of Medicine in San Fran
cisco nor to the students of the
School of Law and the School of
Business. The latter schools have
their own library fees.
"The revenue from this new fee
will probably not exceed the cost of
various special services rendered to
students, i.e., call-slips, overdue
book-notices, publications on the use
of the library, etc. The cost of these
services will continue to be a charge
upon the regular budget of the li
brary. The new revenue will be de
voted solely to increasing the book
collections of the library and par
ticularly those in the reserve book
room where the need has been in
creasingly apparent. A part of the
new revenue will probably be used
to bind some of the accumulated ar
rears in binding thus making many
additional periodicals available for
use.
STUDENTS WILL BENEFIT
"The increase in library revenues
will amount to approximately $4,500
a year. Each student who pays this
50 cents as a library syllabus fee will
receive the benefit not only of his
own contribution but will share in
the benefit, accruing from the com
bined contributions of his fellow
students.
"It is regrettable that there should
lie any increase in student expendi
tures at the present time, even such
a small one. This increase is the
result of necessity and the return
will be used for the benefit of those
paying the fee.
"I am confident that the majority
of the students will recognize the
need for this fee. Every effort will
be made to justify its existence."
