# Menuhin Opens Concert Season With Recital
## Full House To Hear Violin Maestro Play Tomorrow Evening 
### 
The child prodigy who played
his violin on the campus five years
ago will reappear here as a mature
genius when Yehudi Menuhin opens
the 1938-9 Concert Series before a
capacity audience in Memorial Hall
tomorrow night.
When he emerged from his two
year retirement last year, Menuhin
played the famous Schubert Con
certo in St. Louis when it was
heard for the first time in America.
The performance had been post
poned four times by the German
government, which considered the
composition a treasure of national
culture which must fix-st be played
on German soil.
Menuhin was allowed to play the
concerto only after musicians all
over the world had succeeded in
cancelling the restrictions against its
being played until 1956. This delay
was due to a stipulation made in the
contract when the son of the com
poser Joseph Joachim sold the con
certo to the Prussian State Library
in 1907. Schumann had given the
concerto to the elder Joachim.
DEFENDS CONCERTO
' This concerto is the historically
missing link of violin literature; it is
the bridge between the Beethoven
and Brahms concertos. One is
struck with the fact that. Brahms
could never have been what he was
wJlhcut Schumann's influence."
Before the much-publicized Menu
lin marriages last year, Yehudi and
his .sister, Hephzibah, who plays the
piano, gave concerts together. Heph
zibah married Ychudi's brother-in
law, Lindsay Nicholas and now lives
in Australia.
PRAISES U. S. MUSIC
His younger sister Yaltah is mar
ried and living in Washington, but
the rest of the family and Ychudi's
wife will accompany him to the
campus tomorrow night.
Appealing to Americans to dismiss
the myth that. Europe has more or
better music than America, Menu
bin speaks his mind.
When it. comes to performances
of music, the American musician of
today gives to Europe at least a.s
much as Europe offers to him or
his country.
