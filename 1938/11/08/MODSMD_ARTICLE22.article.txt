# Encinamen Start Red Cross Drive
## 
### 
Encina Ex Committee decided to
turn the Red Cross campaign in En
cina over to corridor representatives,
at a meeting Sunday night. This new
plan sent representatives on a room
to-room canvass of the hall last
night, and according to Jim Mc
Kellar, acting chairman of the com
mittee in the absence of President
Gordon McDonald, the drive thi>
year should be simpler and produce
hotter results.
The committee also set January 27
as a tentative date for the Encina
Dance, to be held in the Encina
lobby.
