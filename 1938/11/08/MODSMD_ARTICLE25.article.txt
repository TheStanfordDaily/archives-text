# Election Hopes Of G.O.P. Gain New Heights
## Farley Asks Decisive New Deal Vote Of Democratic Workers 
### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 7 (UP). â€”The,
nation votes tomorrow in the climax j
of hotly fought general election
campaigns which left the fate of
several New Dealers in doubt and
raised Republican hopes of major
victories to the highest pitch in ten
years.
Record registrations from coast to
coast forecast a total vote in excess
of 40,000,000.
President Roosevelt and his fam
ily will lead the country to the polls,
voting early at Hyde Park, N.Y. He
spent a quiet pre-election day, his
only important caller being Works
Progress Administrator Harry L.
Hopkins.
Hopkins told the president yester
day that California and Michigan
would land safely in the Democratic
column tomorrow. Chairman James
A. Farley of the Democratic Na
tional Committee went beyond Hop
kins' two-state forecast and predict
ed sweeping Democratic triumphs.
He said in a radio speech that to
morrow's election transcends in im
portance "the mere political fate" of
scattered congressmen and accused
New Deal foes of seeking to sabot
age measures which have given the
"ordinary citizen a decent break in
our economic system."
Farley called on Democratic work
ers throughout the country to get
out the vote and bring the New Deal
a "decisive" victory.
Chairman John D. M. Hamilton of
the Republican National Committee
issued an election eve statement at
Washington, charging there is
abundant evidence WPA workers
have been coerced by Democratic
candidates. He made no forecast
about the outcome of the election,
beyond saying a large number of
relief beneficiaries were dissatisfied
with their present situation and
would vote Republican tomorrow.
Hamilton telegraphed all Repub
lican state chairmen to direct their
aides to keep close watch for evi
dence of coercion of WPA workers
for submission to congressional in
vestigation committees and possible
grand jury action.
Commenting on Hopkins' visit to
the White House and his report that
California and Michigan are safely
Democratic, Hamilton said:
"Over the week-end he witnessed
the spectacle of the relief adminis
trator reporting to his chief at Hyde
Park. After a tour of the country he
reported that politically things were
okay. Well, we shall see whether
Mr. Hopkins can get away with be
ing a political mentor for this
country."
