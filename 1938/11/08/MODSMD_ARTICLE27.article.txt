### 

BARON MANFRED VON KILLINGER, German consul-general at San Franirsco, said that his investiga
tion "indubitably established'* that an explosion which tore a hole in the Nazi steamer Vancouver in the
Oakland Estuary "came from the outside of the ship," which is shown above. He said he suspected Com
munists. Local and Federal authorities also investigated (lie explosion, which, had it occurred in deep water,
would have sunk the ship, which grounded after the blast. In top photo Coast Guard boats and tugs are
standing by a few minutes after the blast.
