# Certain Age Clicks Despite Antique Plot
## 
### 
"THAT CERTAIN AGE," cur
rently playing at the Fox-Stan
ford and starring Deanna Durbin:
This title sounds like the sort of
moronism you might expect from a
cheek-pinching old Elk on the
spectacle of adolescent love. And the
idea is obviously cribbed from Cer
tain Other Pictures. But that idea
has not yet become cut and dried.

And the picture is
not as full of sim
per i n g indulg
ence as the title
might hint.
In fact, "That
Certain Age" is a
bubbling and
sometimes keen
piece of enter
tainment. Unlike
many films built

around a special talent, this one has
a fairly full-fledged plot dealing
with Miss Durbin's puppy-mooning
over a man twice her age.
Moreover, the central theme is
dolled up with some sunny little re
minders of youth, notably the earn
est boy scout who is bent on seeing
that the South of Market troop has
a trip to camp; the flexing of biceps
by this same boy scout when he de
clares his undying devotion to Miss
Durbin; the amateur theatricals, and
the shaving without any blades.
In addition to the fact that Miss
Durbin is a lively little job, she
looks like the daughter of suburban
wealth and not like some acci
dentally unbleached Wampus baby
who once saw the word "whole
some" on a bread wrapper.
