# Drama Group To Present Bridie Comedy
## Stevens Promises Unusual Staging Of 'Tobias and Angel' 
### 
James Bridie's fantastic comedy,
"Tobias and the Angel," will be pre
sented December 2 and 3 in Memo
rial Hall Auditorium by the Divi
sion, Thomas Wood Stevens, direc
tor of the production, announced
yesterday.
This is the second Bridie play
Stevens has produced. In 1931 he
put on "The Anatomists" at the Bi
jou Theater in New York.
The play deals with the adven
tures of the Archangel Raphael, who
disguises himself as a porter and ac
companies Tobias, a Mesopotamia!!
youth, on his search for a wife and
a fortune.
The cast of the play has not yet
been selected. An unusual method
of staging has been promised by
James Bassett, acting technical di
rector of the Department of Speech
and Drama, but the details have not
been divulged.
Ashley Dukes, famous critic, de
scribes the play's London produc
tion in the current Theater Arts
Monthly as "a most lovely work, now
done with simplicity that brings out
all its qualities. I shall not hope to
spend a happier evening in the the
ater this season. If Bridie is a pro
j voking dramatist, as it is often said
J and rightly, let him go on provoking
his listeners mind as in Tobias.
J Theatrically he makes every gift a
! playwright can to his cast."
Bridie's "Sleeping Clergymen"
! was recently produced in New York
jby the Theater Guild. Other of his
I well-known plays include "The
| Amazed Evangelist," "The Switch
! back" and "Jonah and the Whale."
