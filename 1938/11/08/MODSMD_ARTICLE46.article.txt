CONSOLATION AWARD, or whatever it is, was at stake when Stanford was invaded by University of
Washington—the two "dark horse" teams of the season's start. The game ended a 10-7 victory for the Hus
kies, and here is a bit of action with Jay McDowell, Washington end, being downed after getting a pass front
A1 Cruver for a 10-yard gain. Under that welter of arms and legs—and no feet on the ground—Tony Cal
velli, Indian center, is doing the dowiii-pulling, with Clark (21), and liill Pauhnan (l(i) among the Cards
rushing in.
