Joe Palookas have
k been fighting it out for two
afternoons now to decide who will
enter the spotlight in the annual
novice boxing tournament Thursday
night.
It looks as if there will be a real
battle in every one of the eight
weight classes, if preliminary bouts
are any indication. And elimina-

tions so far have
put a variety of
boxers into the
running, includ
ing sluggers,
body - punchers,
two-handers, and
south - paws. All
have had some
training, and a

few of them are good scientific
fighters.
With the added attraction of
fencing and broadsword contests and
a gymnastic exhibition, Thursday
night will bring a highlight in
Stanford athletic entertainment.

GAME t ickcls, a dime a i
dozen until last Saturday, arc 1
at a premium now, and nothing
can change the market,
A week ago it looked as though
Cal would make a clean haul of
the Big Red Machine without
even a thrill to make it worth the I
climb up to the Berkeley stadium.
But since then the Indians have !
proved they are on the upgrade,
and Cal is coming down to meet
them. So the game will he closer
than we expected and a great deal
more exciting.

is sweeping through
Eastern teams in a real build- |
up for its Stanford invasion on the ,
Saturday after Thanksgiving. Brown ;

is the only col- j
lege that has been |
able to break i
through the boys!
from Hanover for !
two touchdowns, I
while Harvard, j
Yale, and Dickin- i
son have been !

content with one each. Bates, St.
Lawrence, and Princeton have been
held scoreless.
Meanwhile, the Dartmouth boys
have scored as many as 51 points in
a game and have held an average of j
33 a week since their season opened. I
Cornell will be their toughest match i
next Saturday, and may break the j
DartmotJth winning streak.

frnsh football team
deserves crcdit for saving the

face of its alma mater in grid cir
cles this season. The Papooses
have been the Wonder Team of
the "Little Big Four," and have
been held to teens by only the
California Bear Cubs in Saturday's
battle, which they won, 13-7.
And their "low" score at Berke
ley was somewhat of a fluke. The
rule-book fever had spread to the
frosh from the varsity field, and
the Papoose, like his father, was
stricken with had officiating. This
time it was not so one-sided, hut
it was faulty enough to take the
wind out of the freshman sails.

boys will shine on Novem
ber 19 if new pants now being
tested are ordered for the Big Game.
Are they green—no; are they blue—
no; just little silver panties. Yes,
they are silver satin, and they show
up white in the California sun. The
only catch is that they'll have to
take a beating at the cleaners' every
week, and they may not come out in
good shape.
So one pair is being worn like a
sore thumb on the varsity practice
field all week, and if they still look
like football pants alter Jim Lawson
puts them through the mill, we can
count on added color at the Big
Game.

have been the Wonder Team of
the "Little Big Four," and have
been held to teens by only the
California Bear Cubs in Saturday's
battle, which they won, 13-7.
And their "low" score at Berke
ley was somewhat of a fluke. The
rule-book fever had spread to the
frosh from the varsity field, and
the Papoose, like his father, was

it was faulty enough to take the

tested are ordered for the Big Game.
Are they green—no; are they blue—
no; just little silver panties. Yes,
they are silver satin, and they show
up white in the California sun. The
only catch is that they'll have to
take a beating at the cleaners' every
week, and they may not come out in
good shape.
So one pair is being worn like a
sore thumb on the varsity practice
field all week, and if they still look
like football pants alter Jim Lawson
puts them through the mill, we can
count on added color at the Big
Game.


Joe Palookas have
k been fighting it out for two
afternoons now to decide who will
enter the spotlight in the annual
novice boxing tournament Thursday
night.
It looks as if there will be a real
battle in every one of the eight
weight classes, if preliminary bouts
are any indication. And elimina-

tions so far have
put a variety of
boxers into the
running, includ
ing sluggers,
body - punchers,
two-handers, and
south - paws. All
have had some
training, and a

few of them are good scientific
fighters.
With the added attraction of
fencing and broadsword contests and
a gymnastic exhibition, Thursday
night will bring a highlight in
Stanford athletic entertainment.

GAME t ickcls, a dime a i
dozen until last Saturday, arc 1
at a premium now, and nothing
can change the market,
A week ago it looked as though
Cal would make a clean haul of
the Big Red Machine without
even a thrill to make it worth the I
climb up to the Berkeley stadium.
But since then the Indians have !
proved they are on the upgrade,
and Cal is coming down to meet
them. So the game will he closer
