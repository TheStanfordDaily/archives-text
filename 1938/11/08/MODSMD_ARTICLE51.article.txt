# Stanford Poloists Halt Pogonip Club
## 
### 
Card horsemen came through
their first outside match of the sea
son with flying colors Sunday when
they took the Pogonip Polo Club at
Santa Cruz to the tune of 9-3. This
match was scheduled on short no
tice after the game slated with the
San Mateo Polo Club for Friday
was called because of an over slip
pery field.
Sunday's match was a warm-up
for both teams engaged. The Pogo
nip Club, a top women's squad, is
aiming at the national women's
championship to be played off this
spring.
The Indians are gunning for their
Thanksgiving tour, which they top
off with the University of Arizona,
after meeting the New Mexico Mili
tary Institute and the Yuma Polo
Club en route.
