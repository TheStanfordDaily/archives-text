# First String Shows No New Injuries
## 
### 
For the first time this season,
Coach Tiny Thornhill was a Hie to
open a week of football practice
without worrying about revamping
his first-string line-up.
Not a single man on the first
eleven is on the questionable list
for the Oregon State game at Cor-

week-end will be admitted to the
Stanford - Oregon State football
game Saturday on presentation of
their student body cards. A! Mas

students that cards admit no one
but the owner.

vallis next Saturday. Bill Paulman,
who everyone leared wouldn't last
out the Washington tussle, played
the entire GO minutes and seemed to
get better as the game progressed.
Unless Paulman bangs up his two
healing charley horses before the
trip north, he might prove to be the
running as well as the kicking and
passing star ol the Beaver contest.
In one attempt against the Huskies,

| he skirted 10 yards around left end
1 without a limp. His passing was be-
I yond reproach and he kept even with
Jimmy Johnston in punting despite
; the bum pins.
Jack Brenner was definitely not in
top shape Saturday due to a charley
| horse which he picked up late in
! the week. He didn't aggravate it
j any, however, and might start
| against the Beavers.
The only face that will be missed
! will be that of Pete Fay, still recu
| perating. Fay's streptococcic throat
! infection is virtually cleared up, but
j the doctors don't want him to take
j 'any chances on a relapse. So it bc
j gins to look like Fay will be plenty
I iucky to be in good enough condi
! tion to play much of the Big Game,
! a minor engagement the Indians have
! scheduled with California two weeks
i hence.
