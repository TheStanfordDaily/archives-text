# Nuts to Cal

### 
THIS is the day for the gods to laugh, and
the shades of Uncle Joe Cannon and his crew
to hold their splitting sides while Thomas Jef
ferson rolls like a roulette wheel in his grave.
As they hover over California, watching the
voters go to drink from the horse-trough of
screw-ball initiative amendments, they should
turn to P. T. Barnum and say to his ghost, "You
were right."
In past years, The Daily has gone political in
a big way, beating the drums for favorite candi
dates and attempting to arouse Stanford to a
white heat of political fervor. Somehow, this
time, we just couldn't do it. Other than con
sidering certain issues which vitally affect the
University, The Daily is inclined to wash its
hands of the whole screwy affair.
This is probably an ostrich-like attitude, and
one which certainly does little to provoke sanity
in this current election. But in almost every
case the distinction between sanity and insanity
in voting has been so clear-cut that it warrants
little comment. In those cases where honest
doubt may be entertained on a measure or
nominee, The Daily is little more qualified to
mould opinion than the voter himself.
On these pages, however, opinions of indi
viduals capable of judging the merits of certain
measures have been printed, opinions coming
from faculty members and major or minor
prophets of politics. They should have been of
value to the group of Stanfordites who today
go to the polls to mark their X's in the little
squares.
But independent of specific election com
ment, The Daily does note one thing which
stands clear from all the sound and unsound
political talk which has hit the breeze in the
past few months.
In this, more than in any other election in
California's history, intelligence must save the
state from political and economic ruin. On the
ballot are enough mad measures to scuttle the
ship of state to the very bottom.
In no case can intelligence run afoul of bal
anced arguments which might make voting dif
ficult. On measures such as the Thirty-Thurs
day or the Anti-Pound Law only suicidal im
pulses could drive a voter to yes-ing the bills.
California's winds of freedom which blew
up the crack-pot schemes have done their work
wellâ€”too well. Now only intelligence can wipe
away the garbage - can odor they have left
around.
