# Frosh in the Limelight

FOR the first time in years, the freshman elec
tion is getting publicity enough to make it
sound important. Pictures on the front page,
long election stories, and an editorial.
Why? Why play up the embryonic political
activity of the first-year men? By experience,
it is certain that the victors of this election will
dig a political grave for themselves as far as
later student body offices go. And obviously
what goes on Encina Hall ballots makes little
difference to the campus as a whole.
So what's the fuss about?
It's simply because, whether they are or not,
class elections should be important. The whole
governmental structure of the A.S.S.U. rests
upon class organization; Ex Committee mem
bers are chosen on the class system, representa
tives to subsidiary bodies such as Men's and
Women's Council are class chosen. So why
shouldn't other class activities be important?
It's true, they aren't, but if the whole system
of class representation is moribund—and it is—
the fault lies precisely in that apathetic attitude.
Publicity for the freshmen may not make
Stanford class conscious. But the attempt will
have to be made before too late.
