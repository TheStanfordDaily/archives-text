# Council To Warn Paly Merchants
## 
### 
Palo Alto merchants will be
warned in the annual A.S.S.U. let
ter not to advertise in any campus
publication other than the Daily,
Quad, and Chappie unless it has
been authorized by the Publications
Council, it was decided by that
group today.
The action was taken after the
printing and distribution of a date
book for campus women caused the
advertising in official publications to
decline. No living group will be per
mitted to distribute such publica
tions without the authorization of
the council.
Sale of the Cal Grizzly will be
allowed on the campus any time
except ten days before the release
of Chappie, it was further decided.
Purchase of Quad dark-room equip
ment and Daily dark-room and office
equipment was authorized.
