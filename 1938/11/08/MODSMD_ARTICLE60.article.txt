# ... And on Fire

•"PHROUGH Campus Opinion, The Daily hears
L again, as it does at least once a volume, that
the frosh are playing fast and free with fire
alarm boxes in Encina. The subject has been
worn to an editorial frazzle long before this, so
for the present, we reprint a large portion of
Bull Sessioner Dave Mellinkoff's classic on the
subject.
Cutting through the dead silence of early
morning, the long mournful notes of the Fire
house whistle stirred the sleeping campus.
One long blast, a pause, and then nine more:
Encina was on fire.
By the time the fire department could be
roused into action, lower-floor Encina crack
led as a huge bonfire. The central staircase
was cut off: its four-story draft sucked the
roaring flames up to lick the base of the fifth
floor. Side stairways were hopelessly hot.

Like small chimneys, they burned and
smoked. Perhaps it was incendiarism; no one
knew.
Down the back walls of Encina's wings,
frantic, screaming freshmen attempted all at
once to crowd down the too narrow firelad
ders. But the ladders were too few, and the
frosh were too many, and too anxious. Heads
were bashed; arms and legs broken; it was
getting hot; they had to get out. Now, as the
flames reached the second, the third, and the
fourth floors, hundreds of freshmen—blinded
with smoke, dizzy with fear—knew they were
trapped. From the windows they leaped in
desperation. Some landed luckily on the
front lawn; more fell dead or unconscious on
the Bull Pen cement, and the surrounding
roads. The fire department was there, help
less against the giant furnace that was Encina.
As dawn broke, heaps of dead and mangled
bodies covered the ground.
There's a picture—lurid perhaps, but an ac
curate "might-be." The fact that frequent false
alarms lull Encinamen into slumber can be a
contributing factor to disaster if fire ever comes
to the dormitory.
And in this case, instead of being heroes of a
table, the lads who cry wolf would be roasted
along with the rest.
