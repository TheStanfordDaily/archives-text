# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
LAST-MINUTE MUSH
VE7HEN 74 voters in the recent straw ballot approved
that musical comedy measure, the Thirty Dollars
Every Thursday amendment, The Daily commented
with Christian charity that they were probably joking.
Yesterday we received a letter from one of the voters
rebuking us for giving him the benefit of the doubt.
He had voted for the plan, he said, because he hoped
that it would "lead indirectly through government
bankruptcy or directly through government planning
to a determined effort on the part of the government
to unleashe (sic) all productive mechanisms for the
subsequent welfare of all."
If that letter had come from a typical Thirty Thurs
day apostle, we could slug it Exhibit A for the prose
cution, and forget it. But it comes from a Stanford
student, who is supposed to have wriggled through
high school and the aptitude test. I read it. through
carefully looking for a joke or some bit of sarcasm
with over-subtle topspin. But when I finished, all I
could conclude was that the writer would benefit by
a nodding acquaintance with Websters, and that the
word "government" has an almost psychopathic fasci
nation for him.
i|! * *
If our correspondent really believes what he says,
he represents education gone berserk. Evidently he
has attended class just often enough to get the idea that
our society is not exactly the 24-carat paradise the
brothers Grimm and the American Legion would have
us believe it. And so when he hears a new idea, he
appropriates it, and settles back thinking himself very
liberal and far-sighted. He is too lazy to make an
appraisal, and he uses up all his knowledge of eco
nomics when he pronounces a catch-phrase.
He finds it much easier to make an impression by
pretending to unorthodox liberalism than by knowing
something about what he says.
* * * *
II? argument, of course, is about, as sound as a
Japanese lantern. Financial security through gov
ernment, bankruptcy is sheer economic mysticism, and
while the early saints spoke convincingly of life
through death, even they hesitated to identify failure
with prosperity. Perhaps our correspondent feels ca
pable of scuppering the present society and building a
new one. Most of us, though, are a little hesitant
about, it.
And somehow I can't see myself writing my father
that my account is overdrawn and that therefore he
should be very pleased because it will advance the
ultimate welfare of all. I have an idea that my father's
short-sighted reply would ignore the progress that
arises from economic dislocation.
* * At *!«
Today California will vote on the Thirty Thursday
plan. And our correspondent will play mechanic to
the machinery of cause and effect. Theoretically he is
one of the most qualified of the voters. He has fin
ished high school, and is now at Stanford.
God!

that my account is overdrawn and that therefore he
should be very pleased because it will advance the

God!
LAST-MINUTE MUSH
VE7HEN 74 voters in the recent straw ballot approved
that musical comedy measure, the Thirty Dollars
Every Thursday amendment, The Daily commented
with Christian charity that they were probably joking.
Yesterday we received a letter from one of the voters
rebuking us for giving him the benefit of the doubt.
He had voted for the plan, he said, because he hoped
that it would "lead indirectly through government
bankruptcy or directly through government planning
to a determined effort on the part of the government
to unleashe (sic) all productive mechanisms for the
subsequent welfare of all."
If that letter had come from a typical Thirty Thurs
day apostle, we could slug it Exhibit A for the prose
cution, and forget it. But it comes from a Stanford
student, who is supposed to have wriggled through
high school and the aptitude test. I read it. through
carefully looking for a joke or some bit of sarcasm
with over-subtle topspin. But when I finished, all I
could conclude was that the writer would benefit by
a nodding acquaintance with Websters, and that the
word "government" has an almost psychopathic fasci
nation for him.

If our correspondent really believes what he says,
he represents education gone berserk. Evidently he
has attended class just often enough to get the idea that
our society is not exactly the 24-carat paradise the
brothers Grimm and the American Legion would have
us believe it. And so when he hears a new idea, he
appropriates it, and settles back thinking himself very
liberal and far-sighted. He is too lazy to make an
appraisal, and he uses up all his knowledge of eco
nomics when he pronounces a catch-phrase.
He finds it much easier to make an impression by
pretending to unorthodox liberalism than by knowing
something about what he says.
