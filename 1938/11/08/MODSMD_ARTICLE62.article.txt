### DOUG JAQUES 
r tell me about the guy who went to a dance
Saturday night and had a merry if somewhat wob
bly time. When he got up the next morning, some of
his friends and fraternity brothers razzed him a bit
about the way they supposed he must feel.
He said it was all a lie. He said his reflexes were in
perfect order. He walked almost nonchalantly down
to take a shower, letting his casual and smiling man
ner prove that he felt fine.
A good 15 minutes later he came to his room; lie
J was no longer nonchalant. He was, in fact, ripping
out fierce oaths. He was cussing like hell.
He had forgot to take off his bedroom slippers when
he went into the shower.

Several weeks ago I wrote about a guy in a
French class who, when the instructor asked where
a certain egg was, said, "I can't imagine. He was in
history ten minutes ago."
He'll learn better, I wrote last time. I'm not so
sure now. hccausc last week the instructor asked
the same question and the guv said this time. "lie
was here before you got here. He was debating
whether lie should cut or not."

TANFORD, I hear, has two new Democrats. And
I two ex-Republicans.
A couple of the boys, hearing there was a free
Republican dance, etc., at the Palace last Saturday
night, got a couple of gals and went up. They heard
Merriam speak. They heard someone else speak. It
looked like there was going to be quite a number of
speeches after that. They saw a sign on the wall which
• said something about a la carte service for Young
| Republicans of! in another room.
That was more to their liking. They went in and
dined and danced for several hours.
And were very surprised and sore when the head
waiter came around with a bill for 10 bucks.
What did they think a la carte meant?
I What do they think ala carte will mean when used
J by the Democrats?
