The Editor, Sir:
What has become of the Roble
Rush?
Ever since we have been old
enough to realize the superiority of
Stanford men over the males of other
colleges, we have been looking for
ward to those famous days at Roble.
We have heard rumors that we are
the best crop of freshman women
ever to hit the Farm. What good do
rumors do? We want ACTION!

Starting in 1923, Helen Wills
Moody never failed to win the U.S.
Women's Singles championship. She
won the trophy eight times.
