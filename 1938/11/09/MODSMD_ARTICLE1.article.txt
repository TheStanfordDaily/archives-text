# Excom Goes Into Action On Wrecking
## Boathouse Razing Delay Ended; Work Starts Immediately 
### 
Ilazing of the old Boathouse may
begin today, A.S.S.U. President
Bcebs Lee told Ex Committee last
night, explaining the contract is to
be signed at 1 o'clock today when he
meets with contractors' representa
tives.
The Department of Buildings and
Grounds will not allow wrecking of
the structure to begin until a con
tract has been signed, Lee said.
Scheduled to begin last Thursday,
the wrecking job has been delayed
by time needed to draw up plans and
specifications and consequent delay
in signing the contract.
The Boathouse Weekend, a fund
raiser that Ex Committee had sched
uled tentatively for early December,
was postponed until the first part of
winter quark r, when members were
reminded of date conflicts.
"The program probably will ac
company the opening of the new
Boathouse," Lee said.
GAIETIES PROFITS: Hank Hou
scr, dramatics manager, appeared
before the body with suggestions for
disposition of profits, which may
mount as high as $1200, he said.
Acting on two of his proposals, Ex
Committee allotted $100 as a gift to
the Mothers' Club and up to $50 for !
furnishing a meeting room for Stag- j
crs, presumably in the basement # of l
Memorial Hall.
Disposition of the remainder was j
postponed until Ho user has investi- J
gated the possibility of using some ;
of the money for publishing some of j
ihe hit tunes from the show.
STUDENT BODY CARDS: Mak
ing a preliminary report, Al Horn,
whose committee has been studying
the problem, recommended student,
body cards be ruled non-transfer
able. This would be advantageous,
he said, because (1) it would allow
only Stanford students in the rooting
sections, and (2) the B.A.C. might |
find it necessary to charge admission i
to all football games if cards arc
transferable.
Horn said his committee will spend j
this week investigating feasibility of i
having each student's photograph on j
his card and having the words "non- '
transferable" printed on all the cards. |
CALIFORNIA GRIZZLY: In an
swer to a request that this magazine j
be allowed to be sold on the campus, j
Lee told members sale will not he j
allowed within the 10-day period j
preceding Chappie publication.
When it was pointed out the sub
ject matter might not always bo
satisfactory for campus circulation,
Lee said the magazine would be ex
amined before each issue Is put on
sale.
Andy Stojkovieh. objecting to sai<js '
methods, said Grizzly solicitors
' bring a bunch of pretty girls into
the fraternity houses, and you can't
refuse them. If you don't buy their,
magazine they no back to Cal and
say your house is a bunch of cheap
skates."
GRADUATE WOMEN: So that
Ex Committee "would know there
was such a group as the Associated
Graduate Women on the campus,"
Carolyn Hibbard read the organiza
tion's new constitution.
CONCERT SERIES: Acting on
Manager Delphine Joy's recommen
dation. the committee approved Lee's
appointment of John Collins as as
sistant manager to fill the place of
Carl Hansen, who failed to return to
school this quarter.
ELECTION RETURNS: Approv
ing frosh election results, Ex Com
mittee was told that counting votes
by the preferential ballot system was
"plenty tough," since there were 17
candidates for president and 13 can
didates for secretary-treasurer of the
frosh class, and Election Board
found it necessary to go over the
count a second time.
PEACE COUNCIL: Ex Commit
tee approved Lee's appointment of
John Hewitt and Kay Norris as rep
resentatives at large on the Stanford
Peace Council.

GRADUATE WOMEN: So that
Ex Committee "would know there
was such a group as the Associated
Graduate Women on the campus,"
Carolyn Hibbard read the organiza
tion's new constitution.
CONCERT SERIES: Acting on
Manager Delphine Joy's recommen
dation. the committee approved Lee's
appointment of John Collins as as
sistant manager to fill the place of
Carl Hansen, who failed to return to
school this quarter.
ELECTION RETURNS: Approv
ing frosh election results, Ex Com
mittee was told that counting votes
by the preferential ballot system was
"plenty tough," since there were 17
candidates for president and 13 can
didates for secretary-treasurer of the
frosh class, and Election Board
found it necessary to go over the
count a second time.
PEACE COUNCIL: Ex Commit
tee approved Lee's appointment of

Ilazing of the old Boathouse may
begin today, A.S.S.U. President
Bcebs Lee told Ex Committee last
night, explaining the contract is to
be signed at 1 o'clock today when he
meets with contractors' representa
tives.
The Department of Buildings and
Grounds will not allow wrecking of
the structure to begin until a con
tract has been signed, Lee said.
Scheduled to begin last Thursday,
the wrecking job has been delayed
by time needed to draw up plans and
specifications and consequent delay
in signing the contract.
The Boathouse Weekend, a fund
raiser that Ex Committee had sched
uled tentatively for early December,
was postponed until the first part of
winter quark r, when members were
reminded of date conflicts.
"The program probably will ac
company the opening of the new
Boathouse," Lee said.
GAIETIES PROFITS: Hank Hou
scr, dramatics manager, appeared
before the body with suggestions for
disposition of profits, which may
mount as high as $1200, he said.

the Mothers' Club and up to $50 for !
furnishing a meeting room for Stag- j
crs, presumably in the basement # of l
Memorial Hall.
Disposition of the remainder was j
postponed until Ho user has investi- J
gated the possibility of using some ;
of the money for publishing some of j
ihe hit tunes from the show.
STUDENT BODY CARDS: Mak
ing a preliminary report, Al Horn,
whose committee has been studying
the problem, recommended student,
body cards be ruled non-transfer
able. This would be advantageous,
he said, because (1) it would allow
only Stanford students in the rooting
sections, and (2) the B.A.C. might |
find it necessary to charge admission i
to all football games if cards arc
transferable.
Horn said his committee will spend j
this week investigating feasibility of i
having each student's photograph on j
his card and having the words "non- '
transferable" printed on all the cards. |
