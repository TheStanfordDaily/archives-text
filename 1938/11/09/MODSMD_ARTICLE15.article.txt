# Vote System Hits Snag In Ballot Check

With 37 embryonic politicians,
more candidates than in any pre
vious year in Stanford's history,
competing for two freshman class
jx)sts, "a new problem" was created
yesterday by the frosh elections, ac
cording to Dave Stephenson, chair
man of the Election Board.
Although the preferential ballot
ing system, used in all elections, is
ordinarily "very efficient," Stephen
son explained, the unusually large
number of candidates, coupled with
the fact that "after the first three or
four choices, students don't vote in
telligently but merely guess or skip
around," caused counting of the bal
lots to take "an unusually long time
for a small election."
More than four hours and the ef
forts of a dozen persons were nec
essary to determine the winner of
the election, revealed Stephenson,
who suggested that a nominating
committee to select candidates would
be a possible solution which con
ceivably might lessen the confusion
in the future by tending to limit the
number of nominees to five or six.
Adoption of this method of select
ing candidates would, however,
cause sophomore, junior, and senior
class elections "to be more demo
cratic" than the election for frosh
class officers, Stephenson explained,
