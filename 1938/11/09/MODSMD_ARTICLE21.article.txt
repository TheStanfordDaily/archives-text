### 
| BERLIN, Nov. 8 (UP).—Germany
I tonight engaged in sweeping anti-
Semitic vengeance for the shooting
!of a young Nazi diplomat in the
Paris embassy by a 17-year-old
Polish Jew.
Anger against Jews was at a high
| er pitch than at any time since the
1936 assassination of Wilhelm Gust
; loff, German Nazi agent in Switzer
! land, by a Jew named David Frank
| furter.
! There were strong official intima
! tions that measures were being con
j sidered for expulsion of all for
jeign Jews from Germany in retalia
tion for the shooting of Ernst Von
| Rathan, 29-year-old third secretary
j of the German embassy in Paris.
JEW PLOT CHARGED
J The shooting of Rath by Herschel
Fripel Grynszpan, who said he had
j a "divine mission" to claim veng
eance for the recent deportation of
his parents from Germany, and the
j slaying of Gustloff in Switzerland
I were described as "organized plots
| by international Jewry."
"The Jewish question will now be
I brought to a solution," a high Nazi
j told the United Press.
Rath remained in serious condi
| tion in a Paris clinic tonight.
The Nazi reprisals took form
! swiftly as German newspapers un
leashed a torrent of anti-Jewish
comment.
Authorities said they were con
vinced the Paris shooting was the
j result of a conspiracy involving
more than one assassin and that
I Grynszpan was only the dupe.
REPRISALS BEGUN
The Nazi reprisals included:
j 1. A ban on all Jewish newspa
pers.
2. A ban on Jewish meetings of
j any kind, even cultural.
3. Notice Jewish children no
longer will be permitted to attend
j German primary schools.
4. A demand by Der AngrifF, or
jgan of Propaganda Minister Paul
• Joseph Goebbels who belongs to the
! radical anti-Semitic wing of Nazi-
I ism, for "the sharpest measure
against Jews, especially foreign
Jews."
JEWS DISARMED
5. Police announcement that "the
j disarmament of Jews" in Berlin is
! underway and thus far has pro-
I duced 2.569 daggers and swords,
| 1,702 firearms and 20.000 cartridges.
|In Vienna, Nazi crowds gathered
I outside synagogues after learning of
i the shooting in Paris, booed rabbis,
J smashed windows and beat up sev
i eral passersby.
j Der Angriff, calling 'for "the grav
-1 est consequences for Jews as result
of the assassination attempt," said:
"The demand necessarily arises
from this misdeed to proceed
against Jews with the sharpest
means."
