# Labor Leader Talks to Grads
## Williams Speaks On Workers' Viewpoint 
### 
" 'Give us this day our daily job'
is, in brief, the prayer of every
worker," declared Whiting Williams,
labor and industrial relations me
diator, who spoke on "The Labor
Outlook" yesterday morning before
students of the Graduate School of
Business in the auditorium of the
new Education Building.
"We average Americans are en
tirely wrong in assuming that th«
worker desires only his daily bread,
represented by a few coppers in his
pocket and food in the family larder.
His job means a great deal more
than mere bread," asserted the
speaker.
FEAR INSECURITY
In order to determine just exactly
what was on the worker's mind,
and to prepare himself for indus
trial relationships, Mr. Williams left
his "white-collar" position with a
steel corporation to obtain jobs in
several European countries, mingling
with miners in France and England
and in the United States.
Mr. Williams, a former vice-presi
dent of the Hydraulic Steel Com
pany and a lecturer in the Graduate
School of Business of Harvard Uni
versity, believes that "90 per cent
of labor trouble is directly traceable
to man's fear of losing his job," ex
plaining that "this fear exists be
cause the worker's job determines
not only his livelihood, but, more
important, his status among his fel
low men, the social level on which
his wife and children will move in
the community."
C.1.0. SCORED
"The holder of the least important
job in a community is the least im
portant individual, while the holder
of the higher job is on a higher
plane," the speaker asserted. "Yet
this gap between top and bottom is
not as great as the gap between the
most insignificant job holder and the
man who has no job at all."
John L .Lewis' Committee for In
dustrial Organization tends to lessen
the possibility of promotion for
workers, Mr. Williams contended as
he described "C.1.0. upheaval and
loss of jobs."
