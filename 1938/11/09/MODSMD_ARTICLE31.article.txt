# Beaver Tilt May Revive Grid Jinx
## No-Win Tradition Faces Acid Test In Saturday's Contest 
### 
If the Oregon State Beavers de
cide not to spoil an old Farm tradi
tion, they will lose their football
game with Stanford Saturday at
Corvallis.
For the Beavers have never beaten
Stanford on the gridiron. The clos
est they, came was the scoreless tie
in the local stadium muck last year.
Psychologically, the Beavers should
be just as nervous as Washington
and U.C.L.A. were determined and
calm.
RECORD AGAINST BEAVERS
U.C.L.A. was playing to win for
a bereaved coach, the Huskies were
giving their all for a mentor al
ready half devoured by the wolves.
But Oregon State just isn't supposed
to lick the Indians, because they
never have before.
Still, if the Beavers ignore prece
dent, they ought to be favored by
odds of about 10-7, inasmuch as they
beat Washington by a touchdown
and pushed the Cal Bears all over
the field only to lose ultimately by
a single scoi'e. They traveled 51
yards on the ground in the first two
minutes of play at Berkeley, then
lost their advantage on a fumble.
Tiny Thornhill isn't revamping
much this week, and. probably won't
have any contact work in order to
give the battered squad a chance to
get in top shape befpre Thursday.
By moving Bill Paulman from quar
ter to fullback, Thornhill indicated
that his great kicking and passing
star probably would be utilized as a
ball carrier for the rest of the sea
son.
BACKFIELD SHIFTS
Norman Standlee is back at quar
terback with Freddie Ledeboer at
left half and Hugh Gallarneau tenta
tively at right half. Back of these
men are Gene Coldiron at quarter,
Red Parker at full, Jack Brenner at
left half, and Bill Kirsch at right
half.
Gallarneau showed again against
Washington that he has all the po
tentialities of a great running back.
He lacks the finesse of the more ex
perienced men, especially in han
dling the ball, but he shows bril
liancy and improves with season
ing.
