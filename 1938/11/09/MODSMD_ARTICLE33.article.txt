## JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor African Natives Originate Modern Game of Soccer 
### WILSON CANNON 
A far cry from the days when j
South African natives were wont to
boot an ex-enemy's skull about the
veldt, soccer as it is played today is.
nevertheless, directly derived from
that ancient beginning. Soccer was
the original team game played with
a ball. Rugby followed in the proc
ess of evolution, and American
football is a still later product.
The distinguishing feature of the
game is the fact that only one mem
ber on each team is permitted to i
touch the ball with his hands. The \
other team members may kick, butt, !
knee, or otherwise propel the unol- j
fending spheroid, but the goalkeeper |
is the only man who may touch it I
with his hands.
Even the goalie is restricted in |
this. Before his goal cage, two areas
are marked off. In the smaller he
may pick up the ball and kick it,
and an opposing player may not
shoulder him unless he has the ball.
In the larger of the sections, the
goalkeeper may still use his hands,
but this time he is the legitimate
j target for the opposing team mem
| bers.
Should any other man touch the
. ball with his hands, the opposing
] team is given a penalty shot from
! that point, usually resulting in "sud
den death" for the penalized goalie.
The main object of the game is to
boot the ball between the other
team's goal posts, even if the play
ers have to commit mayhem to do it.
J However, the mayhem is mutual,
j and nc hard feelings.
To the offense falls the duty of
making the scores. Five forwards
line up before the goal mouth,
spread in their positions across the
' field, and concentrate on booming
I the ball past, around, or through the
! goal keeper.
To keep this from happening, two
fullbacks aid the goalie, while three
halfbacks play a roving position be
tween the center line and their own
goal to stop the opposing offense be
fore it gets under way.
Should the ball roll out the side
lines during one of the melees, the
team who managed to make the
! other side touch it last is given the
! opportunity to throw it in, hoping
j all the while that some occasion will
present itself for a scoring thrust.
If the offense kicks the ball over
the end line, the opposing fullback

is given a free kick in from a spot
just in the playing territory. How
ever, if the defensive players boot it
over their own end line, the at
tacking team is given what is termed
a "corner kick."
In this type of play, the outside
forward on the side the ball went
out is given a free kick from the
corner of the field, and does his
best to set it squarely between the
posts so that a team-mate can bang
it through. Both teams generally
manage to squeeze into the mouth
of the goal to help proceedings
along, precipitating a near riot.

The distinguishing feature of the
game is the fact that only one mem
ber on each team is permitted to i
touch the ball with his hands. The \
other team members may kick, butt, !
knee, or otherwise propel the unol- j
fending spheroid, but the goalkeeper |
is the only man who may touch it I
with his hands.
Even the goalie is restricted in |
this. Before his goal cage, two areas
are marked off. In the smaller he
may pick up the ball and kick it,
and an opposing player may not
shoulder him unless he has the ball.
In the larger of the sections, the
goalkeeper may still use his hands,
but this time he is the legitimate
j target for the opposing team mem
| bers.
Should any other man touch the
. ball with his hands, the opposing
] team is given a penalty shot from
! that point, usually resulting in "sud
den death" for the penalized goalie.
The main object of the game is to
boot the ball between the other
team's goal posts, even if the play
ers have to commit mayhem to do it.
J However, the mayhem is mutual,
j and nc hard feelings.
To the offense falls the duty of
making the scores. Five forwards
line up before the goal mouth,
spread in their positions across the
' field, and concentrate on booming
I the ball past, around, or through the
! goal keeper.
To keep this from happening, two
fullbacks aid the goalie, while three
halfbacks play a roving position be
tween the center line and their own
goal to stop the opposing offense be
fore it gets under way.
Should the ball roll out the side
lines during one of the melees, the
team who managed to make the
! other side touch it last is given the
! opportunity to throw it in, hoping
j all the while that some occasion will
present itself for a scoring thrust.
If the offense kicks the ball over
the end line, the opposing fullback

is given a free kick in from a spot
just in the playing territory. How
ever, if the defensive players boot it
over their own end line, the at
tacking team is given what is termed
a "corner kick."
In this type of play, the outside
forward on the side the ball went
out is given a free kick from the
corner of the field, and does his
best to set it squarely between the
posts so that a team-mate can bang
it through. Both teams generally
