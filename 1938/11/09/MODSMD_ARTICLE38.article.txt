# Stanford Cagers Show Sparkle
## 
### 
Knowing it will be the object of ]
vengeance because of drubbings!
handed Coast Conference cagers by |
Hank Luisctti and Company over the I
past three seasons, Stanford's bas- !
ketball club nevertheless has been |
I sparking its workouts with increased i
j vigor under Coach Everett Dean.
The Indian nightmare which hit j
Cal, Troy and U.C.L.A. with ma
chine-like regularity is no more,
| with only Captain Phil Zonne left
J from the highly-touted "Laughing
1 Boys." The lour positions left va
i cant represents a man-sized gap for
! Dean to plug; but if the present
I spirit which has invaded the daily
j drills continues, the cagers will be
i well-drilled in making things in
{ teresting for both opponents and
j fans.
Any uncovering of this year's var
| sity basketballers will be kept in

the background until the U.S.F. tilt '<
here, Dec. 2, which will be the first j
practice game of the season.
With the first scrimmage sched- |
uled for sometime next week, the 29 [
cagers who survived the initial j
squad cut last week, have been ;
brushing up on more of Dean's of- !
fensive fundamentals for their |
first active test. The fast-breaking
i offense has been added to their list i
I of duties, as well as learning to take j
| the ball off the backboard and work j
! out various play formations. De
fensive tactics have also been work-
I ed into the daily sessions.
I A "B" team schedule is being ar-
J ranged by Dean to give the reserves
I a chance for development and to
j play more basketball. The present
] club will be cut down sometime
j after Thanksgiving, with the "B"
j squad being made up of those taken
I from the varsity.
