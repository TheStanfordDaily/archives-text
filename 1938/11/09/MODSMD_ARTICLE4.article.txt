# Card Team Will Debate At Berkeley
## 
### 
Two Stanford debaters, John G.
Moskovics and Francis McDowell,
journey to the Bear campus today to
uphold the negative side of the
Anglo-American question.
This question, "Resolved, that an
Anglo-American mutual assistance
pact in case of aggression would l>e
in the best interests of world peace,"
has been the principal outlet for
j Stanford's forensic abilities thus far
jthis term, although the Card teams
have not confined themselves to
either the affirmative or negative
j sides exclusively.
Today's debate is the first of the
quarter with Cal, and it is expected
that the Bear varsity will produce
its usual lively competition.
Jack Grovel* and Bob Moulton
presented the negative viewpoint of
the Anglo-American question yes
terday in the Santa Clara debate.
They demonstrated that the mutual
assistance pact plan was entirely
against American precedents, that
its success had been repudiated by
the fate of similar agreements, and
that it would be neither flexible nor
workable. The Bronco representa
tives brought out the facts that the
United States' foreign policy of iso
| lation was faulty, the benefits, eco
nomic and military, to be derived
from an Anglo-American pact, anc
its force as a factor in bringing about
world peace.
For the San Francisco State tilt
held in the city on Monday, a List -
minute change in the team was ef
fected. Walt Stoessel and Harrj
Horton were substituted for Gent
Glasmann and Armen Hampar. Tin
Card representatives made the trip
to present the affirmative side ol
the Anglo-American question.
