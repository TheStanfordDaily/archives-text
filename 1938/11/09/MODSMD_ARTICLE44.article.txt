# Thank God It's Over
## 
### 
THE reign of the Elephant is ended in Cali
fornia.
From results piled up at press time early this
morning, Olson, Patterson, and Downey had
forged into an indisputable lead for governor,
lieutenant-governor, and state senator. So the
Democrats take over, parched politically from
office drought since 1894.
The Donkey should kick up its heels today.
But perhaps Stanford will center more in
terest on the four amendments, Numbers 1, 2,
20, and 25, which have occupied the local and
state limelight throughout this election period.
One mass sigh of relief, and four small in
dividual ones should greet the news that all
were voted dov/n. Thirty-Thursday was the
bug-bear of the outfit. Shocking to economists,
alarming to social theorists, and incredibly long
haired to the layman voter, the mad scheme
went on the skids of crack-potism.
But after the scare is over, one sound conclu
sion can be drawn from its very existence:
Crazy as Thirty-Thursday was, it represented a
crying need—the need to provide for Califor
nia's elderly population. The defeat of the
amendment should not carry with it the disre
gard of that need. It is still pressing.
And Stanford's own particular boogey-man,
the Anti-Pound Law, went overboard, just as
did its three preceding anti-vivisection part
ners. California's centers of research still will
be left open to carry on scientific experimenta
tion under the same conditions of humanity
and animal care that they always have.
Reversing Stanford's own straw-vote deci
sion on the Anti-Picket amendment, California
votes that labor will still have its right to
march, to scream epithets at prospective buy
ers. But by the same vote, disinterested citi
zens will not have the right of free speech
threatened by Section 8 of the proposed and
defeated amendment.
And California is still conservative enough
not to want an experiment with the single tax
(No. 20).
So what does the state election prove?
At an early hour this morning, election fog
was too thick to know. The Daily retired with
out either a tremor or a conviction.
And, thank God, without the prospect of
phoney currency collected Thursdays to eke
out edit board salaries.

state limelight throughout this election period.
One mass sigh of relief, and four small in
dividual ones should greet the news that all
were voted dov/n. Thirty-Thursday was the
bug-bear of the outfit. Shocking to economists,
alarming to social theorists, and incredibly long
haired to the layman voter, the mad scheme
went on the skids of crack-potism.
But after the scare is over, one sound conclu
sion can be drawn from its very existence:
Crazy as Thirty-Thursday was, it represented a
crying need—the need to provide for Califor
nia's elderly population. The defeat of the
amendment should not carry with it the disre
gard of that need. It is still pressing.
And Stanford's own particular boogey-man,
the Anti-Pound Law, went overboard, just as
did its three preceding anti-vivisection part
ners. California's centers of research still will
be left open to carry on scientific experimenta
tion under the same conditions of humanity
and animal care that they always have.
Reversing Stanford's own straw-vote deci
sion on the Anti-Picket amendment, California
votes that labor will still have its right to
march, to scream epithets at prospective buy
ers. But by the same vote, disinterested citi
zens will not have the right of free speech
threatened by Section 8 of the proposed and
defeated amendment.
And California is still conservative enough
not to want an experiment with the single tax
(No. 20).
So what does the state election prove?
At an early hour this morning, election fog
was too thick to know. The Daily retired with
out either a tremor or a conviction.
And, thank God, without the prospect of
phoney currency collected Thursdays to eke
out edit board salaries.
