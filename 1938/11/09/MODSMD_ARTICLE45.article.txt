AS an example of remarkable financial prog- j
ress for a campus organization and of ex- ,
emplary long-range planning, consider Dra
matics Council, which last night presented to
Ex Committee a tentative proposal for disposal
of this year's Gaieties profits.
The proposal in itself might not evoke more
than passing notice were the history of student
dramatics not one of financial reverses and
figures in red. The profit they have shown in
the past two years nearly amounts to an inno
vation.
Through last year's Gaieties take, Council
funds are furnished with enough money to i
carry this and next year's budget—with plenty
to spare. This in addition to the new $500
scholarship which Stagers added to their
budget last year.
So when Hank Houser, Council manager,
came to Ex Committee last night with talk of
disposing of $100 here and $100 there, with a !
sizable amount left over to aid in payment of
the Memorial Hall debt, eyes popped.
Besides the congratulations that Council and
Stagers should receive for being in a position
to talk turkey, an added commendatory line
should be included for their far-sightedness in
planning the disbursement of their funds.
To student dramatics then, a bouquet—per
haps of Four Roses.
