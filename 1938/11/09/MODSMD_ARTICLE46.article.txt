r T~ I ONIGHT, a stocky, shaggy, blond-haired
1 young man will walk to the center of Memo
rial Hall stage to coax magic sounds from a
curious contrivance of wood and string that an
old cabinetmaker fashioned 200 years ago.

Tonight, Stanford and Palo Alto residents will
remember back nearly 20 years when word
first came of the phenomenal child genius play
ing in San Francisco. They will remember the
ovation he received when at the age of 15 he
came to Stanford for the first time, to fill the
empty rafters of the Pavilion with his music.
That was over five years ago, five years for
the artist they heard then to develop, to change
his title from precocious youngster to mature
genius.
Stanford will remember too with a perhaps
unwarranted pride that his remarkable develop
ment took place in a near-by country home in
Los Gatos, on Stanford's figurative hearth-stone.
Tonight, remembering all that but forgetting
it as he coaxes magical music from that curious
contrivance of wood and string, Stanford will
think,
"Welcome,"Yehudi Menuhin."
