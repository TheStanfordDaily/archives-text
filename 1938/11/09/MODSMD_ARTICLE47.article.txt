# BULL SESSION

### JOHN COBBS 
DRIVE OUT Ol BOUNDS
jVI Y FRATERNITY held u house meeting the other
night, after the manner of fraternities. The.' be
loved brethren were in good parliamentary form and
settled with ruthless efficiency the problems of park
ing, table manners, and house work. Just as I was be
ginning to hope that we could finish up wthiout spend
ing any money, somebody announced that the Red
Cross would like us to contribute 75 cents apiece. The
brethren ran off an assessment like good little sheep,
and the meeting closed in an atmosphere of piety, so
thick that it could have been bottled and sold com
mercially.
Personally, I have no objection to rendering the
Red Cross its customary tribute. Usually, it takes me
for a dollar, and if it is content with the present ar
rangement, I have no complaint. But it. frightens me
to see the assessment technique being used again.

Previous Stanford drive committees of assorted
types have established the custom of calling on living
groups for a lump contribution. By doing this they
cash in on mass psychology and also save themselves
the trouble of convincing each individual prospect that
his conscience will never rest easy unless he comes
through.
The trouble i.s that when this technique is applied
the minority gets caught under the steam-roller. Con
tributions supposedly are made voluntarily, and are
inspired only by our hope of salvation and our Chris
tian sympathy. It is hardly ethical to set up machin
ery that grabs innocent bystanders by the neck and
shakes them loose from an assessment.

Â£N THE case of the Red Cross, it doesn't matter a
great deal what they do. Most of us have been
reared to regard the Red Cross as a semi-sacred organi
zation which takes up a collection just as a church
docs. My first acquaintance with it occurred when as
a small child I swallowed one of its buttons. And since
then I have coughed up for it regularly.
But when the Red Cross uses the assessment tech
nique, it. sets a precedent which opens the way to an
annoying series of levies. Each new drive committee
admires the success of the last one, and puts its faith
in the old machinery. It doesn't, of course, demand
that the living groups contribute. But suggests that it
would be nice, and it publishes a list so that the
backsliders will be made to feel properly ashamed.
It speaks persuasively to house managers, and its
representatives speak with well practicd enthusiasm at
house meetings.

And so the living groups run through their assess
ments. The minorities write them off as windfall losses
and forget about it. The power of the traditional ma
chinery was demonstrated last year when a question
able scholarship drive secured lump contributions from
several houses even 1 hough it was disapproved by the
majority of the campus.
It is harder to contact students individually, of
course. And the contributions might be smaller. But
the present, system does some very shady manipulat
ing with the law of majority rule. And when this i.s
mixed with the elevated motives with which most
drives justify themselves, the ethical traffic jam i.s
appalling.
