A GAL who graduated last year was complaining to
a friend of mine about a sad thing which hap
pened to her in her sorority last year.
She could never keep one room-mate very long be
cause of some gold-fish she had, and finally she
couldn't keep the gold-fish. One of her sisters poisoned
them with ant powder. She sat up all night nursing
them, but they died anyway.
She says her room-mates complained because the
gold-fish made too much noise at night.
Well, maybe.
Last year there were gold-fish in the Alpha
Phi house, and I've heard on good authority that
there were hats in the Pi Phi house. This year
there are newts in one of the fraternities.
I wonder if the Irojjs in Lake Lagunita know
about all this.
Stanford shouldn't have got rid of the dogs.
Yesterday a friend of mine heard a guy saying, "I
left my sweater up at the A.TO. house List 'vear I

I did not like your pornographic letter.
P.S.: I don't think your telephone number is 5171.

A GAL who graduated last year was complaining to
a friend of mine about a sad thing which hap
pened to her in her sorority last year.
She could never keep one room-mate very long be
cause of some gold-fish she had, and finally she
couldn't keep the gold-fish. One of her sisters poisoned
them with ant powder. She sat up all night nursing
them, but they died anyway.
She says her room-mates complained because the
gold-fish made too much noise at night.
Well, maybe.
Last year there were gold-fish in the Alpha
Phi house, and I've heard on good authority that
there were hats in the Pi Phi house. This year
there are newts in one of the fraternities.
I wonder if the Irojjs in Lake Lagunita know
about all this.
Stanford shouldn't have got rid of the dogs.
Yesterday a friend of mine heard a guy saying, "I
left my sweater up at the A.TO. house List 'vear I
bad to join the house to net it back "
