# Farm Hears Blind Organist Play in Chapel
## 
### 
With sure, deft fingers and rap
idly moving feet, Andre Marchal,
celebrated organist of the Church of
St. Germain des Pres in Paris, un
erringly manipulated the keys and
pedals of the great organ of Memo
rial Church last night, executing in
tricate passages with the ease of
great familiarity. His recital was a
program of the Tuesday Evening
Series.
With a technique grown perfect
through years of training made more
dilTicult by the necessity of using
Braille music—Andre Marchal needs
no longer think about dynamics.
Rhythmic balance, clarity of tone,
complete understanding of the com
positions he played, and an uncan
ny memory were characteristics of
his performance.
The "Fantasie in F Minor,"' by
Mozart glittered with brilliance, and
Bach's "Third Trio Sonata" was
amazingly well executed.
"Fantasie," by Charles Tourne
mire, dedicated to Mr. Marchal, with
its dramatic changes of mood and
sustenutos, was mastered smoothly
by the artist.
Drawing the varied program to
conclusion, the French organist
proved his versatility by improvis
ing on a haunting plainsong theme,
selected by Dr. Warren D. Allen,
Memorial Church organist.
Listening attentively while Dr.
Allen picked out the melody on the
keyboard, Mr. Marchal without
hesitation extended and freely im
provised the basic theme until it cov
ered an introduction and three va
riations. —Hiler
