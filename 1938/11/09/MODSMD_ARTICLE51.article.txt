The Editor, Sir:
May I be so rash as to ask what
has become of Stanford as it has
been since the days of our illustrious
founders?
There comes a time when the
well-known straw breaks the pro
verbial camel's back; and I, at least,
reached such a state at last Satur
day's game.
Where has Stanford's tradition
been cast, when the female jitter
bugs are allowed to invade and con
taminate the men's rooting section?
Besides cluttering up the place with

| their pom-puns, or something, they
; seriously cramp the rooting style of
90 per cent of the male student body.
Most Roughs will remember 'way
back when the girls had to fight
hard to even obtain status as root
ers; and what pioneer woman has
forgotten the thrill of first sitting
with her friends in her own section,
just to the right of the men's rooting
section?
i Has Stanford become so effemi
j nate that the men can't take care of
j themselves any more?
I truly hope that Saturday's inci-
I dent was meant only as an cxperi-
