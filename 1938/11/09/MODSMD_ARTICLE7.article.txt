# Yehudi Bows To Stanford Tonight at 8
## Box Office to Open Early to Accommodate Capacity Audience 
### 
When the curtain rises in Memo
rial Hall at 8 o'clock tonight, Yehudi
Menuhin will open his concert with
Handel's "Sonata No. (Â» in K Major"
on his famous Khevcnheullcr Stradi
varius violin.
"Sonata No. 1 in G Minor" by Bach
will complete the first, group, .since
both composers are of the same pe
riod and society. However, the two
classical sonatas differ distinctly in
content and composition. Hendrik
Endt at the piano will accompany
the artist only on the first sonata.
A nineteenth century concerto
patterned after the early eighteenth
century sonata forms is Ernst's
"Concerto in F Sharp Minor, Opus
23," which Menuhin will play to
night.
VIOLIN SKETCHES
Concluding the program with five
short violin sketches, Yehudi will
play "Malaguena" and "Zapateado"
(The Cobbler's Dance) by Spain's
nineteenth century violinist compos
er, Pablo Sarasate.
Following "Andalusa" by Nin. a
rather obscure Cuban composer,
Menuhin will play Hartman's ar
rangement of Claude Debussy's "La
Fillc aux Chevcux de Lin."
Returning from the twentieth cen
tury to music of the Baroque period
with which he opened the concert,
Yehudi will conclude with "Laby
rinth," one from a series of 24 ca
prices written by Locatelli in 1723.
