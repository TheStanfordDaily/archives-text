# Eliot Discusses World Conflict
## Luncheon Club Hears Bostonian Speaker 
### 
Speaking on a subject appropriate
to Armistice Day, "Problems of In
ternational Conflict Today," Dr.
Samuel Eliot of Boston addressed
the Luncheon Club at its meeting
yesterday noon.
According to him, no country can
win a war; each country and par
ticipant loses. The fact we are liv
ing through the consequences of the
World War shows this to be true.
He cited the conditions of Europe
at present as showing that no one
is able to predict when a speech may
set the world ablaze. Enmity pre
vails on all sides.
PEACE PROBLEM
"There is no short-cut to peace in
the world," said Dr. Eliot. "It must
be won by untiring effort. War men
tality is entrenched in our inherit
ance, entangled in our traditions, and
allied with sentiments of patriot
ism.
"It is the spirit behind external
endeavor that counts. The peace
problem is not just a sentiment; it
must be tackled. A creative task
calls for all virtues—a surrender of
public interest to public good.
PREVENTION OF WAR
"War can and must be prevented.
By fostering the good neighbor
policy, explaining the international
mind, preventing selfish nationalism,
amending neutrality, and taking the
initiative in stabilizing currency,
i America may aid the cause of
peace," said Dr. Eliot.
"The price of peace is social in
telligence and militant Christianity.
War must be abolished so that we
may live in a world of co-operative
good will—not one of strife."
