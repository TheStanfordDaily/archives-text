# Gaieties Will Feature Fifteen New Melodies
## 
### KAY JOHNSON 
Myron Birnhaum sitting alone in the semi-darkness of the vacant room
in the old Women's Gym looked up, startled, from the music he was ar
ranging. There was that soft music again. Was he going crazy?
The eerie music of the phantom orchestra continued—still playing
"Tunc In on Love," the piece which he at that moment was arranging for
the first time.
Gradually the mystery cleared. It was the music of Eddie Fitzpatrick,
playing at the Sophomore Cotillion close by, which was floating in the

window. But how come "Tune lin
on Love"?
"My God, we've swiped some
body's song!" was Birnbaum's next
thought. But the orchestra kept on
playing note for note. It was too
much for coincidence. It was not till
the next day that the mystery was
dispelled. Milton Lees, "Tune In on
Love" composer, had had an ar
rangement of the song made by
Howdy Smith, former Gaieties com
poser, and had presented it to Eddie
Fitzpatrick to play at the Soph Co
tillion.
ARRANGES STUDY
Birnbaum, in a dugout in the old
Women's Gym across from the Quad
offices, works beside a pre-war
Steinway arranging and cementing
the fifteen Gaieties scores together
into an integrated musical back
! ground for the '38 Gaieties. On his
shoulders rests their effectiveness
and the musical success of the show.
After the sun goes down he wraps
himself in a blanket, turns on the
lights, and continues arranging "The
Moon Goes Down" or some other
Gaieties number until 2:30, when he
jumps in his car and drives back to
Sequoia for half a night's sleep.
ARRANGES FOUR SHOWS
Birnbaum has arranged music for
four Stanford shows—two Gaieties
and two Spring shows, being the
erstwhile partner of Ken Klec, who
is now ill in Chicago, and successor
to Pete Knecht, of some years back,
lie used to do construction work as
a stage hand until he got his chance
.I in the spiing of '37 by doing some
arranging for Charlie Ransom's band
j which was then playing on the cam
pus.
There will l>c more tunes in this
| year's Gaieties than in any Gaie
! lies heretofore, according to Birn
' baum. And all the music has been
written by Stanford students.
