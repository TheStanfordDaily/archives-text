# Debate Squad Lays Plans For Good Will Tour
## Eight Qualified Students Will Visit Indian Reservations 
### 
A tour of good will for the pur
pose of seeking accurate informa
tion on the situation of the American
Indian is being planned by experi
enced members of the Stanford de
bate squad.
As announced by Lee Chapin,
varsity debate coach, approximately
eight exceptional debaters of junior
and senior rank will make a trip to
the Indian i-eservations of New
Mexico and Arizona during the
Thanksgiving vacation.
LAYING CAREFUL PLANS
The students investigating the
reservations are laying careful plans
and have found the close co-opera
tion of authorities in the field, among
them John Collier, U. S. commis
sioner of Indian affairs, Professor
Joel Berreman of the Stanford fac
ulty, who has made a special study
of Indians in the Northwest, and
Professor and Mrs. Thomas Wood
Stevens, who have made a study of
the Indians of New Mexico, where
they resided for a number of years.
Also now resident in New Mexico is
Miss Edith Mirrielees, of the Stan
ford English department, who is now
doing research work in the depart- |
ment of Indian affairs.
This tour will be in accord with the
Stanford plan of developing types of
discussion and debate separate from
the tournament and decision con
tests. It is an effort to substitute the
symposium and conference hall in
the place of "soap box oratory."
Two years ago, Jim Reynolds, then
A.S.S.U. president, and James Hill,
Phi Beta Kappa and outstanding
senior, made a tour of Mexico, Gua
temala, and Salvador, investigating
the political and economic condi
tions in the central American states.
RECEIVED BY MINISTERS
They were received by American
ministers and ambassadors and stay
ed at the home of the Hon. F. P.
Corrigan, now American minister to
Panama.
Upon their return, Reynolds and
Hill conducted discussion meetings
and spoke before a large number of
forums, stimulating interest and
bringing first-hand information to
Stanford University and adjacent
communities.
It is with this trip as a pattern
that the debaters will conduct their
investigation. The names of those
chosen for the tour will be an
nounced shortly.
