## Well-Rounded Repertoire Ranges From Classical to Modern Works 
### PAT CORDNER 
A master played to Stanford on liis Stradivarius last night, and today
Stanford wonders if the genius of the modest boy who played his violin
last night can be as true as it was then.
Yehudi Menuhin thrilled his audience in Memorial Hall, thrilled it as
a Stanford audience has seldom been thrilled before. Ami with curtain

►after curtain call, Stanford rose hi
its feet in a sustained ovation which
brought Yehudi Menuhin back for a
round half-dozen encores.
Menuhin opened the concert with
Handel's Sonata No. (» in E Major,
displaying a purity and richness of
tone which we have never heard
equaled anywhere Perhaps the
loveliest movement of the sonata
was the famous Largo.
Closing the first half of the pro
i gram, Menuhin played the vibrant
| Sonata No. 1 in (i Minor for violin
alone (Bach) for what was perhaps
the most compelling artistic per
formance of the evening. Smooth
facility of technic that never fal
tered scattered rippling graces lik'*
water flicked across a .still pool,
lyric beauty of sostenuto, thought
ful, sincere interpretation of this
difficult, contrapuntal work made his
Bach a wonder of emotional sensi
tivity.
Ernst's song-like Concerto in F
Sharp Minor opened the conclud
ing portion of the concert, skillfully
handled to bring the most this work
of clever musical cliche.
But the audience fell ripely into
the palm of Menuhin's magical hands
when he went to the lighter works of
Sarasate, Nin, Debussy, and Loca
telli. Displaying to the utmost his
technical command of his medium,
but devoting his greater powers U>
the melodious essences of the Ma
lagucna and Zapatcado (Sarasate),
and the rhythmic vitality of the
Andalusa (Nin), Menuhin brought
the capacity crowd to a breathless
state when he played, and repeated,
Debussy's a Fille aux cheveaux do
lin. Though he concluded his formal
program with the Labyrinth of Lo
catelli, r the enthusiastic audience
brought him back for encore after
encore, graciously answers to the
response.
Going through Caprice Venoisc,
Davorak's Songs My Mother Taught
Me, the audience was only satisfied
to leave Memorial Hall when his
violin sang Schubert's Ave Maria.
It was a wonderful evening.
Stanford will long remember the
return of this youthful genius, Ye
hudi Menuhin, will look hopefully
at future Concert Scries programs
for his name.
