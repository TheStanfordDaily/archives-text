# Republican Rally Called Inevitable
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
A natural trend and not a political miracle—that is the way I'rofe-sur
Edwin A. Cottrell «»i the political science department regards the nation
wide rise in Republican fortunes in Tuesday's elections.
Inevitable when coat-tail riders begin to tall awa> from a popular
President, the victories of Republican governors and senators in such

slates as Pennsylvania and Massa-<
chusetts indicates only the eusto- j
mary mid-term purge which hits
Congress in the closing years of any i
administration, according to Pro
fessor Cottrell.
Commenting on the New York I
election and its effect upon the
President's chances of controlling the
1940 Democratic Convention, Mr.
Cottrell gave it as his opinion that ;
Governor Lehman's re-election was
almost entirely a personal triumph. j
GANG-Bl STER
"It is claimed as a Democratic
victory," he said, "but it was due
chieliy to (he governor's personality
and splendid record. .Vlr. Dewey is
colorful and appealing, but he has
had very little administrative ex
perience. Being a gang-buster isn't
enough, as the vote in New York
City shows.
"Lehman's personal difficulties
with the President will probably
have no effect on the composition
of the New York delegation in 1940,
nor will the loss of Pennsylvania to
Republican Governor-elect James
bother him . If he h.id lost New York

as well as Pennsylvania, he would
have lost everything; but ;;s it stands
now, he has complete control of
New York, and the Democratic ma
chine in Pennsylvania. He has been
weakened, but by no means se
riously."
Questioned concerning 1940 and
the G.O.P.'s prospects of capturing
the White House, Professor Cottrell
agreed that they had improved, but
pointed out that in none of the
states is there a Republican of na
tional caliber.
TAFT LIKE LAN DON
"Taft of Ohio is a possibility," lie
said, "but he seems to be a colorless
personality, with little experience in
public life. He would be better than
Landon; but you know what Landon
was. Dewey will be a fine candidate
in about eight years, but he's dead

now. There's nothing on ihe Pacific 1
Coast. Unless someone develops
;reatly between now and 1940, I
can't see that the Republicans are
any better of! than they were."
End of the Thirty Thursday in
California has given the Townsend
movement a boost, according to Pro
lessor Cottrell, and the new Con
gress will undoubtedly find itself
faced with demands for revision of
the Social Security Act to assure "a
broader base and a higher ante.
Rising prosperity, however, will tend
to keep these demands within ii*-
sonable limits.
In conclusion. Professor Cottrell
remarked that the election had done
little to change the most important
, fact in America's political scene: a
! status quo which depends, now as it
has for the past five years, upon the
personality of one man — the Presi
dent of the United States.

"It is claimed as a Democratic
victory," he said, "but it was due

colorful and appealing, but he has

"Lehman's personal difficulties
with the President will probably
have no effect on the composition
of the New York delegation in 1940,
nor will the loss of Pennsylvania to
Republican Governor-elect James
bother him . If he h.id lost New York

as well as Pennsylvania, he would
have lost everything; but ;;s it stands
now, he has complete control of
New York, and the Democratic ma
chine in Pennsylvania. He has been
weakened, but by no means se
riously."
Questioned concerning 1940 and
the G.O.P.'s prospects of capturing
the White House, Professor Cottrell
agreed that they had improved, but
pointed out that in none of the
states is there a Republican of na
tional caliber.

"Taft of Ohio is a possibility," lie
said, "but he seems to be a colorless
personality, with little experience in
public life. He would be better than
Landon; but you know what Landon
was. Dewey will be a fine candidate
in about eight years, but he's dead

now. There's nothing on ihe Pacific 1
Coast. Unless someone develops
;reatly between now and 1940, I
can't see that the Republicans are
any better of! than they were."
End of the Thirty Thursday in
California has given the Townsend
movement a boost, according to Pro
lessor Cottrell, and the new Con
gress will undoubtedly find itself
faced with demands for revision of
the Social Security Act to assure "a
broader base and a higher ante.
Rising prosperity, however, will tend
to keep these demands within ii*-
sonable limits.
In conclusion. Professor Cottrell
remarked that the election had done
little to change the most important
, fact in America's political scene: a
! status quo which depends, now as it
has for the past five years, upon the
personality of one man — the Presi
dent of the United States.
A natural trend and not a political miracle—that is the way I'rofe-sur
Edwin A. Cottrell «»i the political science department regards the nation
wide rise in Republican fortunes in Tuesday's elections.
Inevitable when coat-tail riders begin to tall awa> from a popular
President, the victories of Republican governors and senators in such

slates as Pennsylvania and Massa-<
chusetts indicates only the eusto- j
mary mid-term purge which hits
Congress in the closing years of any i
administration, according to Pro
fessor Cottrell.
Commenting on the New York I
election and its effect upon the
President's chances of controlling the
1940 Democratic Convention, Mr.
