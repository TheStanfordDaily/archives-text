EXISTS will fly tonight.
Novice boxing finals, one of
Stanford's favorite athletic events,
will attract students to the Pa
vilion tonight for an evening of
line minor sports entertainment.
If preliminaries are any indica
tion, tonight's matches will be
some of the best ever fought in
the Stanford ring. And variety
will be added in the form of fenc
ing and gymnastics exhibitions.
Among those wielding sabres will
he Fcrard Leicester, former Na
tional Intercollegiate Fencing
Champ.
And while Stanford is enter
tained, Circle S Society will be
putting together the two-bit
pieces to help some worthy minor
sports athlete contribute his talent
to the Stanford cause.
