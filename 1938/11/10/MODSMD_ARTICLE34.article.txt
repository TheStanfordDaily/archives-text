Washington Huskies were expected
to be in top physical condition for
the invasion Saturday of the Uni

it was revealed that A1 Cruver, who
led the Huskies to a 10-7 win over
Stanford last week-end, may play.
Cruver's lead was taken out of a
cast yesterday when it was deter

as first feared. Coach Jimmy Phelan

the day of the game whether he
will start Cruver.
