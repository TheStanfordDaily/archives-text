# Lamb Injury Saps Varsity Splasher Squad
## Farm Water Poloists To Meet Powerful S.C. Team in South 
### 
With Captain Johnny Lamb and
! his crutch watching from the side
i lines, the Stanford varsity water polo
| squad went through its final prac
tice before heading southward to
night for the important two-game
series with Southern California and
U.C.1..A. Friday and Saturday. The
Cardinals will meet the strong Tro
j jans Armistice afternoon and the
j U.C.L.A. Bruins the following morn
i ing.
( Lamb, all-conference star for two
I years and one of the mainstays on
| this year's team, broke a blood ves
| sel in his foot yesterday when he
I fell down some stairs in the gym.
j While he will be severely hampered
with the injured foot, Lamb will
| make the trip and will probably start
the U.S.C. game. In the event that
j Lamb will be unable to play the en
-1 tire game, Bill Hatch or Dave Not
! tage will replace him.
SHORT POOL HAMPERS
While both the Trojans and the
Bruins were defeated by the Indians
| in the local pool earlier this season,
the two forthcoming games will be
j much tougher, according to Coach
Norton Thornton, as the Stanford
; splash artists will be hampered by
the short 60-foot pools in Ihe south.
The Encina pool is considered a long
pool, being 75 feet in length. How
, ever, the full squad has been work
i ing out in the shorter diving tank
this week in an effort to become ac
j customed to the South's shrimp
sized pools.
With California leading the con
ference with four straight wins, the
i undefeated Stanford team must win
> both of these road encounters to
j meet the Golden Bears on even
terms next week. One loss Friday
!or Saturday would necessitate two
I straight, victories over California for
an undisputed championship. Two
losses this week-end would practic
i ally eliminate the Indians from
I grabbing the title.
S C. TOUGHEST
The Southern California game
Friday afternoon will be the tough-
I est of the two, according to Coach
| Thornton, as the Trojans will be
! seeking revenge from the rough and
; tumble, drag-'em-out 5 to 4 defeat
' handed them here last week. In an
I effort tfl repeat their local victory,
| the Cardinals have been practicing
all this week on a defense to stop
j the U.S.C. tip-in style of offense
: built around Paul Wolf, 1936 Olym
! pic team sprinter. With the reserves
1 using Trojan plays in every prac
i tice. the Stanford varsity was suc
cessfully able to stop the long throw
I and tip-in style of scoring.
The Indian offense may be slowed
j down by the fast swimming Wolf,
I who will guard the high-scoring
I Harvey Rothschild, Stanford center
i forward. The brunt of the scoring
i will probably be shifted to Jack
! Loupe, Bob Plate, or the injured
j Lamb.
"The U.C.L.A. game will be eas
ier," said Thornton, "but anything
; can happen." The Bruins, champions
last year, have not won a game this
| season in league competition. The
i game will be played in the Bruin
j pool Saturday morning at 10 o'clock.
SMALL SQUAD TRAVELS
A playing squad of 11 will accom-

' Bruce Jessup, Roy Vitousek, and

i lines, the Stanford varsity water polo
| squad went through its final prac
tice before heading southward to
night for the important two-game
series with Southern California and
U.C.1..A. Friday and Saturday. The
Cardinals will meet the strong Tro
j jans Armistice afternoon and the
j U.C.L.A. Bruins the following morn
i ing.
( Lamb, all-conference star for two
I years and one of the mainstays on
| this year's team, broke a blood ves
| sel in his foot yesterday when he
I fell down some stairs in the gym.
j While he will be severely hampered
with the injured foot, Lamb will

the U.S.C. game. In the event that
j Lamb will be unable to play the en
-1 tire game, Bill Hatch or Dave Not

SHORT POOL HAMPERS
While both the Trojans and the
Bruins were defeated by the Indians
| in the local pool earlier this season,
the two forthcoming games will be
j much tougher, according to Coach
Norton Thornton, as the Stanford
; splash artists will be hampered by
the short 60-foot pools in Ihe south.
The Encina pool is considered a long
pool, being 75 feet in length. How
, ever, the full squad has been work
i ing out in the shorter diving tank
this week in an effort to become ac
j customed to the South's shrimp
sized pools.
With California leading the con
ference with four straight wins, the
i undefeated Stanford team must win
> both of these road encounters to
j meet the Golden Bears on even
terms next week. One loss Friday
!or Saturday would necessitate two
I straight, victories over California for
an undisputed championship. Two
losses this week-end would practic
i ally eliminate the Indians from
I grabbing the title.
