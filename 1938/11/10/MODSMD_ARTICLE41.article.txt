# Grid Squad to Leave Tonight for O.S.C. Tilt
## 
### 
Thirty-two var; ity grid men were selected yesterday by Coaeb Tiny 1
Thornhill for the squad's longest trip of the season, an overnight junket j
to Corvatiis and the Oregon Slate camnih.
The team will leave tonight and start the expedition home immediately
after the game in order not to miss any practice before the Big Game.

Notable amnog the
l will be Pete Fay and possibly Steve
Keusseff, left guard. Fay ran through
■an extended signal drill last, night
but won't be in playing shape before
the middle of next week at the ear
liest. Keusseff has a "hip pointer"
which may keep him on the shelf.
In semi-final workouts last night
Jack Clarke was at left end on the i
first string in place of Bill Willard
with the rest of the first string line
the same as started against Wash
ington. Johnny Casey, a speed mer
chant right half, has been shifted to
fullback behind Bill Paulman and I
Rod Parker.
Thornhill again kept his charges i
out of contact drill, preferring to
work the mo nthe bags and in dum
my scrimmage. Execution of plays,
which varied almost equally be
tween running plays and an aerial
attack, looked smoother than it has
for several sessions.
Aside from Fay and Keusseff, the !
i entire squad appealed in better!
physical condition than it has been j
since before the Santa Clara game, t
