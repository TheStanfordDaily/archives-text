# Stands to Attention

WITH the best prospective cinder-path out
fit that Stanford has seen in years already
turning in phenomenal early - season marks,
track enthusiasts are hotter on the trail of Angell
Field bleachers than ever before.
They pick this year to act for several reasons:
that visiting teams refuse to jeopardize their rec
ords by running on the wind-tunnel Stadium
track; that Stanford's own stars will lose much
of their record-breaking chances by using that
same cinder-path; that with the Indians' pros
pects this year, huge crowds could be drawn to
Angell Field—if there were bleachers to ac
commodate them; that, with new stands, im
portant intersectional conference meets could
come to the Farm.
Further, they believe that track is a last dying
hope to revive intercollegiate athletics at Stan
ford.
Cost of 10,000 seats has been estimated at
530,000, money which would be repaid within
a few years by well-filled stands, so that from
there on out, clear profits would be returned to
all Stanford in added athletic prestige and, per
haps, in financial aid to the Farm's educational
plant.
Balanced against the large expenditure is the
possibility that, instead, handball courts will be
built for approximately the same amount.
Now, before track season opens, while Stan
ford still has its hot-footed squad intact, would
be the logical time to take action, it seems to
the S3O-thousand-for-stands leaders.
They ask for student opinion on the question,
if possible, for student support. They ask that
it should be given for the above-stated reasons,
and another one—that if anything should be
added to Stanford's athletic plant, it should be
Angell Field stands.
They are right there, including the word "if."
And it's on that single word thaf Stanford
student opinion, if it is to be recorded, must
stumble. Included in the two-letter word are
other concepts, perhaps balancing those for
building: the concept that, at this point, all funds
should be diverted to developing Stanford's
education plant—its original buildings, its fac
ulty, its equipment; the concept that Stanford's
intercollegiate standing is not in such great dan
ger as some suspect, and that what if it is?
the concept that building stands to prevent
building handball courts is a rather peculiar
form of economic theory; concepts, concepts,
concepts.
All neatly balanced on the needle-point of
the word "if."

that visiting teams refuse to jeopardize their rec
ords by running on the wind-tunnel Stadium
track; that Stanford's own stars will lose much
of their record-breaking chances by using that
same cinder-path; that with the Indians' pros
pects this year, huge crowds could be drawn to
Angell Field—if there were bleachers to ac
commodate them; that, with new stands, im
portant intersectional conference meets could
come to the Farm.
Further, they believe that track is a last dying
hope to revive intercollegiate athletics at Stan
ford.
Cost of 10,000 seats has been estimated at
530,000, money which would be repaid within
a few years by well-filled stands, so that from
there on out, clear profits would be returned to
all Stanford in added athletic prestige and, per
haps, in financial aid to the Farm's educational
plant.
Balanced against the large expenditure is the
possibility that, instead, handball courts will be
built for approximately the same amount.
Now, before track season opens, while Stan
ford still has its hot-footed squad intact, would
be the logical time to take action, it seems to
the S3O-thousand-for-stands leaders.
They ask for student opinion on the question,
if possible, for student support. They ask that
it should be given for the above-stated reasons,
and another one—that if anything should be
added to Stanford's athletic plant, it should be
Angell Field stands.
They are right there, including the word "if."
And it's on that single word thaf Stanford
student opinion, if it is to be recorded, must
stumble. Included in the two-letter word are
other concepts, perhaps balancing those for
building: the concept that, at this point, all funds
should be diverted to developing Stanford's
education plant—its original buildings, its fac
ulty, its equipment; the concept that Stanford's
intercollegiate standing is not in such great dan
ger as some suspect, and that what if it is?
the concept that building stands to prevent
building handball courts is a rather peculiar
form of economic theory; concepts, concepts,
concepts.
All neatly balanced on the needle-point of
the word "if."
WITH the best prospective cinder-path out
fit that Stanford has seen in years already
turning in phenomenal early - season marks,
track enthusiasts are hotter on the trail of Angell
Field bleachers than ever before.
They pick this year to act for several reasons:
that visiting teams refuse to jeopardize their rec
ords by running on the wind-tunnel Stadium
track; that Stanford's own stars will lose much
of their record-breaking chances by using that
same cinder-path; that with the Indians' pros
pects this year, huge crowds could be drawn to
Angell Field—if there were bleachers to ac
commodate them; that, with new stands, im
