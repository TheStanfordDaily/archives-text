# Drive Out of Bounds
## 
### 
ANOTHER finance drive found itself well es
tablished for the year at Stanford, this
week.
With only the most cursory examination, the
Y.W.C.A. was granted dates for its annual
appeal for funds. The Daily has no bones to
pick with this organization in regard to this
particular drive, other than that it indicates a
well-loaded stream flowing through the holes
in Stanford pockets.
What there is concern about, however, is the
fact that already this year more drives for stu
dent support are planned than ever before and
all are for causes better than ever before.
Stanford has gone through the Red Cross
drive, admittedly a beneficent undertaking,
without much griping and without feeling much
of a strain.
In addition to this, the libe gets 50 cents extra
this year; the Y.W.C.A. drive is already as
sured; the A.S.S.U. must have $10,000 to build
the now boathouse; the Convalescent Home
must be supported as always; there are un
doubtedly other drives nobody knows about
yet but which will slip in like sleepers on the

moonlit ranges. Where is it going to end?
Nobody knows and nobody seems to care
at this point. All anyone can see is the worthi
ness of objectives. The howl will arise at ap
proximately the time that the Convalescent
Drive ceases to make money.
There is such a thing in chemistry as the point
of saturation. And when Stanford cools off next
spring it's going to find unbalanced bank state
ments precipitated all over the bottom of the
test-tube.
The whole outlook more or less ties in with
the general feeling that organizations must
show a profit, whether that profit will be used
for anything or not. Since that is the philoso
phy, there's not a great deal that can be done.
There is one recommendation, however, that
can be made:
Let Ex Committee not be so preoccupied with
signing documents and borrowing fountain
pens when dates are granted, and pay more
attention to the problems at hand.â€”H. L. S.
