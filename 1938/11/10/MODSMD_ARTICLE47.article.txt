# BULL SESSION

### JOHN COBBS 
JEFF'EIISONIAN JAMBOREE
HALF a dozen amateur political scientists trotted
around yesterday to sing an "I told you so chorus
to the election returns. California voters, they pointed
out, had cut dead the moronic initiative propositions.
Thirty Thursday, anti-vivisection, anti-picketing, were
all tossed into the political trash basket last Tuesday.
Therefore, concluded the joyous Jeffersonians, Cali
fornia democracy has vindicated itself, and deserves
an humble apology from all of us who let our faith
waver during the election pandemonium.
But somehow, I don't feel able to join in the glad
anthem. In last Tuesday's election California voters
demonstrated only that they have the minimum of
intelligence necessary to keep the Indians from taking
back the country. The issues were clear-cut and
easily understood; no melodrama ever drew a sharper
line between the powers of light and the powers of
darkness. All the voters had to do was to apply a few
elementary principles that any grammar school child
could explain.
>|t i'fi si« #
And yet each one of the fantastic propositions polled
a support that would have been very close to a ma
jority in an ordinary election. Each issue was ihe sub
ject of a passionately illogical fight, and it. took all the
political artillery of the "intelligent citizens" to defeat
them. Very probably it also took a little well-managed
bribery and some wire-pulling that would not be ap
proved by the best civics texts.
The Thirty Thursday proposition was unconstitu
tional insanity, and yet the vote was terrifyingly close.

/ will also have to do a good deal of
explaining to justify a system that lets such meas
ures get on the ballot. As one student pointed out,
the law of averages makes intelligent voting easy in
this state. "You just vote 'no' on all initiative, and
'yes' on all referendum. You can't miss." I have a no
tion that in a properly managed Utopia, the ballot
wouldn't look quite as much like the plot of a
musical comedy.
We have finished up with this election, and we can
get back to worrying about the new boathouse and
the syllabus fees. No Thirty Thursday warrants will
carom around the campus to inflate Big Game ex
penses, and the anatomy department can invest in a
new whetstone confident that it will be able to use
it. But two years from now, we will have a new set
of propositions; I am offering very attractive odds
that they will be just as insane as this year's.
Perhaps the joyful chorus is right. Perhaps the
California voters have demonstrated their intelligence.
But somehow, I don't think that Tuesday's election
will be rated Exhibit A in Democracy's sales campaign.

Therefore, concluded the joyous Jeffersonians, Cali
fornia democracy has vindicated itself, and deserves
an humble apology from all of us who let our faith
waver during the election pandemonium.
But somehow, I don't feel able to join in the glad
anthem. In last Tuesday's election California voters
demonstrated only that they have the minimum of
intelligence necessary to keep the Indians from taking
back the country. The issues were clear-cut and
easily understood; no melodrama ever drew a sharper
line between the powers of light and the powers of
darkness. All the voters had to do was to apply a few
elementary principles that any grammar school child
could explain.

And yet each one of the fantastic propositions polled
a support that would have been very close to a ma
jority in an ordinary election. Each issue was ihe sub
ject of a passionately illogical fight, and it. took all the
political artillery of the "intelligent citizens" to defeat
them. Very probably it also took a little well-managed
bribery and some wire-pulling that would not be ap
proved by the best civics texts.
The Thirty Thursday proposition was unconstitu
tional insanity, and yet the vote was terrifyingly close.

explaining to justify a system that lets such meas
ures get on the ballot. As one student pointed out,
the law of averages makes intelligent voting easy in
this state. "You just vote 'no' on all initiative, and
'yes' on all referendum. You can't miss." I have a no

wouldn't look quite as much like the plot of a
musical comedy.
We have finished up with this election, and we can
get back to worrying about the new boathouse and
the syllabus fees. No Thirty Thursday warrants will
carom around the campus to inflate Big Game ex
penses, and the anatomy department can invest in a
new whetstone confident that it will be able to use
it. But two years from now, we will have a new set
of propositions; I am offering very attractive odds
that they will be just as insane as this year's.
Perhaps the joyful chorus is right. Perhaps the
California voters have demonstrated their intelligence.
But somehow, I don't think that Tuesday's election
will be rated Exhibit A in Democracy's sales campaign.

HALF a dozen amateur political scientists trotted
around yesterday to sing an "I told you so chorus
to the election returns. California voters, they pointed
out, had cut dead the moronic initiative propositions.
Thirty Thursday, anti-vivisection, anti-picketing, were
all tossed into the political trash basket last Tuesday.
