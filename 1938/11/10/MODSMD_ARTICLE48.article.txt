# Lightly... And Politely

A HORRIBLE thing happened to my room-mate's
father when he was down in this part of the
country seeing my room-mate last week-end. He was
over at Bay Meadows the day Seabiscuit and War
Admiral ran.
The man he was with asked him if he would like
to make a little bet on Seabiscuit.
"Sure I would like to make a little bet on Sea
biscuit," my room-mate's father said. *
"I'll bet. you $50 to $20 that Seabiscuit doesn't win,"
said the guy.
Just as the loud-speaker blared forth with the an
nouncement that Seabiscuit had just won the race.

Sometimes I sit here at the Shack for quite a
while of an afternoon. Like llie words in the song,
I can't get started. Sometimes I think of that song,
hut I can't even sing it because I don't know the
words nor the tune and I can't sing anyway. I
can just sit here and look had. My friends all
tell me I look had.
"What are you looking so had about?" they
say. "Did some one die? Did you bet on Mcr
riam?"
They ask me that, and they don't believe it
when I tell them the truth.
I'm thinking of funny stories.

r JPHERE are more disillusioned people on the campus
these days.
First it was my ex-Republican friends, now it's a
couple of other boys.
There was nn actor's benefit up in the city last
week, and a couple of stars or semi-stars were going
to perform. The actors couldn't advertise their charity
clam-bake in the papers, but they sent out cards "in
viting" people to it.
A couple of Stanford's fraternity boys not cards.
They were very flattered. They put on their prettiest
clothes one night and went up to it.
And were horribly shocked and disappointed when
they were socked $2.65 apiece to get in.

There's a sophomore going here who is mar
ried. A friend of mine says he's married to a
honey.
My friend has one class with this guy. One day
recently he noticed the guy wasn't in class, but the
guy's wife was. He went over and sat down he
side her.
He asked her why wasn't her husband there
today.
"Oh. he wanted to slay in bed today. I'm going
to all his classes and taking notes for him."
Utopia.
Overheard: One freshman telling another. "And

just one of those things, see? Just one of those things. '*

My friend has one class with this guy. One day
recently he noticed the guy wasn't in class, but the
guy's wife was. He went over and sat down he
side her.
He asked her why wasn't her husband there
today.
"Oh. he wanted to slay in bed today. I'm going
to all his classes and taking notes for him."
Utopia.
Overheard: One freshman telling another. "And
when you see your bed flying out the window, it's
just one of those things, see? Just one of those things. '*
A HORRIBLE thing happened to my room-mate's
father when he was down in this part of the
country seeing my room-mate last week-end. He was
over at Bay Meadows the day Seabiscuit and War
Admiral ran.
The man he was with asked him if he would like
to make a little bet on Seabiscuit.
"Sure I would like to make a little bet on Sea
biscuit," my room-mate's father said. *
"I'll bet. you $50 to $20 that Seabiscuit doesn't win,"
said the guy.
Just as the loud-speaker blared forth with the an
nouncement that Seabiscuit had just won the race.

Sometimes I sit here at the Shack for quite a
while of an afternoon. Like llie words in the song,
I can't get started. Sometimes I think of that song,
hut I can't even sing it because I don't know the
words nor the tune and I can't sing anyway. I
can just sit here and look had. My friends all
tell me I look had.
"What are you looking so had about?" they
say. "Did some one die? Did you bet on Mcr
riam?"
They ask me that, and they don't believe it
when I tell them the truth.
I'm thinking of funny stories.

r JPHERE are more disillusioned people on the campus
these days.
First it was my ex-Republican friends, now it's a
couple of other boys.
There was nn actor's benefit up in the city last
week, and a couple of stars or semi-stars were going
to perform. The actors couldn't advertise their charity
clam-bake in the papers, but they sent out cards "in
viting" people to it.
A couple of Stanford's fraternity boys not cards.
They were very flattered. They put on their prettiest
clothes one night and went up to it.
And were horribly shocked and disappointed when
they were socked $2.65 apiece to get in.
