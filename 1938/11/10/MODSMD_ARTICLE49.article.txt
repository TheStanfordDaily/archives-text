## 
### 
"II I WERE currently
playing at the Fox Stanford. 1
Starring Ronald Coleman.
Robin Hood in Medieval France.,
That is Paramount's version of the I
famous melodrama, "If I Were j
King." Ronald Coleman as Ihe |

swash buckling
poet, Francois
Villon, displays a
social conscious
ness incongruous
to his character.
Frances Dee, as
the lovely Lady
Catherine, has lit
tle to do but look
appealing and she
docs that to per-

fection.
Paramount's much heralded find.
Ellen Drew, is stiff and amateurish.
She plays the tavern wench like a
high school girl who has to kiss het
first man in the senior play.
RATI I BONE GOOD
Basil Rathbone as usual is superb
as King Louis. It is an effective
change from his customary suave
villain roles to play a sly, supersti
tious old king.
The story is well known. Francois
Villon, king of the Paris underworld,
boasts how, if he were king, he
would drive the besieging Burgun
dians from the gates of Paris. King
Louis XI, disguised as a wealthy
merchant, overhears him and gives
him an opportunity to make good
his boast by making him Grand
Marshal of France for the period of
a week, stipulating that at the end
of the time he must die on the gal
lows for the murder of the former
Grand Marshal.
FURIOUS BATTLE
How Francois uses his exalted po
sition to relieve the misery of the
people of Paris and how they in
turn unite and drive out the Bur
gundians in one of the best screen
battles of the year constitutes the
action of "If I Were King."
The picture is magnificently pro
duced and crammed full of excite
ment. It would have been superb in
technicolor. On the whole, it is the
type of picture that forms a welcome
escape from the mundane problems
of the Stanford student.
