# CAMPUS OPINION
## ATTENTION MR. COBBS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I was disappointed to see in Tues
day's Daily an error which deserves j
to be called much more than "social" j
or "professional." I refer to the let
ter by the student supporter of the '
Thirty-Dollar pension plan in which
he mis-spelled a word by adding
an "e".
I believe that gentlemanly jour
nalism would have dictated your
correcting that error, probably un
witting. Instead of this you let it
pass and permitted your Mr. Cobbs
to use it unwittily as a reflection on
the intelligence of the contributor.
THRASHING HINTED
I should derive righteous pleasure
in the privilege of lowering a cer
tain article of Mr. Cobbs' clothing,
removing the belt therefrom, and
therewith and forthwith adminis
tering the spanking (sic) he has
long needed.
Mr. Cobbs may courteously (if he
knows what courtesy means) legiti
mately attack any idea contrary to
j his convictions. Perhaps he may
I even legitimately hang like a vul
j ture over the Campus Opinion col
| umn and pounce on every idea that
I irritates his sophisticated nostrils
! and gouge it with figures of speech
j that strain the classics. But he
| should not be granted the privilege
| of reflecting in the slightest degree
j on the intelligence of any contribu
j tor regardless of grammatical or
' orthographical mistakes.
LENIENCY QUESTIONED
j I am inclined to question your
leniency in permitting him to scav
-1 enge Campus Opinion at all except
j in cases where the letters are aimed
i particularly at him, as is this one.
' Campus Opinion letters should be
i encouraged.
Before Mr. Cobbs brings Homer
or Cicero or Tennyson to his sup
! port in defense of his error, let him
, confer with the journalism depart -
I ment on the matter of ethical jour-
I nalism. He might dust off his Bible
! and learn a few quotations from
Jesus. Then he should get down
off his columnar pedestal onto his
literary knees and beg pardon for
! his wrong.
