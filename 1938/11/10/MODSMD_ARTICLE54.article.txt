# POST OFFICE DOORS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have a suggestion to make. Why
| not have doors on the post office
; hooked back so that there will not
j be so much crowding and pushing
I during the rush hours? As you
I probably know there is a mess in
the doorway between the classes.
Better than one door being hooked
back would be two of them hooked
back.
