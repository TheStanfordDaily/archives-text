# Indians, Oregon Staters Ready For Mud Battle
## Beavers Hold Decisive Offensive Edge Over Stanford on Wet Field 
### ARCH JENKINS 
'Diere's a guy up at Corvallis who holds in his hands the key to the
winner of tomorrow's Coast Conference football game between Stanford
and Oregon State.
This fellow, a particular enemy of the Indians, is a gent by name Jupe
Pluvius. He's been up in the Oregon country since Monday, raining like

all get-out on the scene of tomor-<
row's skirmish. If he leaves by mid- |
night tonight, Coach Tiny Thorn
hill will sleep in peaceful anticipa
tion. If he hangs around, Tiny will
probably bite his fingernails until
dawn trying to dope out some scheme
whereby his dry-weather crew can
wade through the best mudders in
the world.
For Tiny realizes that the Cards
haven't a single damp weather play

that is sure-fire, while the Orange
men never really get inspired until
they feel the water soaking up
through their socks. Coach Lon
Stiner has a typical crew of wading
backs who revel in dog-paddling
through the middle of a drowning
line.
Jim Kisselburgh, the Kohler boys,
Hal Higgins, in fact, the whole
water-logged crew, are probably
praying to old Jupe right now to
stick around until Saturday night.
If the rain doesn't go away, all
Tiny can do will be to try shots
through the guards with Norm
Standlee and Bill Paulman doing
most, of the swimming. And neither
of these two backs has reconditioned
his legs to the point where he is
likely to be able to take continued
punishment in inevitable pile-ups.
PASS ATTACK OUT?
What Thornhill had counted on
all week was a mixed array of end
and tackle plays, with more of the
kind of passing used against Wash
ington as a double threat. But it's
a cinch that Freddie Ledeboer and
Paulman won't be as accurate if the
fog hangs too close to the ground.
Stiner declared last Saturday that
Stanford had the best passing attack
he had seen all year. Naturally he
would be pleased no end if Pluvius
should upset the Thornhill aerial
circus.
Maybe the field will dry. Then
listen for a wide open fray all the
way with a possible offensive edge to
Stanford. .Jack Brenner still is
nursing a slight charley horse, al
though he made the northern trip.
Brenner is just about the only
breakaway threat Thornhill has to
offer.
bi:st m;rs
Hugh Gallarncau has developed
into a first-rate runner, however,
and while he has never played in
the goo, he has shown himself able
to keep his feet in excellent fash
ion. Ledeboer, too, is hard to knock
over, but he lacks weight. So it
looks as if Paulman and Standlee
will have to be the Indian mainstays
if it's still raining.
The Indian first-string is heavy
enough to stand up, fog or no fog. It
will probably be Jack Clark and
Andy Slojkovich, end; Stan Ander
sen and Pete Zagar, tackle; Hamp
Pool and Corky Donahue, guard;
and Tony Calvclii, center.
Paulman is slated for fullback;
Standlee, quarter; Ledeboer, left
half; and Gallarncau ,right half. And
wet or dry, Rod Parker, Gene Cold
iron, Brenner, Bill Kirsch, and oth
ers are primed for heavy duty in
the backfield.
