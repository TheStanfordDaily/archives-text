# 'Pin Money' Gift Of Cubberleys To Be Dedicated
## Former Education Dean to Speak At Formal Service Tomorrow 
### MARY JUNE MONTGOMERY 
l)r. Ellwood Patterson Cubberley will see dedicated lure tomorrow his
25-year-old dream come true, when he presents the new three-story School
of Education Building to the University through the Board of Trustees at
10:it0 o'clock. It was completed this fall at a cost of $5.'{5.000.
When Dr. Cubberley walked into President Wilbur's olTice one day
10 years ago and laid down $5,000 in securities, he announced:

« "For 15 years my wife and 1 have
dreamed of making this gift.. We
want to keep it a secret, but when
I retire wo will turn over all our
pin-money to the University. It's for
a new Education building."
During these 15 years he had ap
peared the typical "underpaid pro
fessor, ' but he had been carrying
out the decision he and his wife
made in 1013—that of devoting his
entire career to the advancement of
Stanford's rapidly expanding educa
tion school.
REFUSES OFFER
It was this decision which caused
him I<> refuse a professorship of
fered him at that time by a large
eastern university and remain here
as professor and dean of the School
of Education.
With Dr. Cubberley's retirement
in 193.3, his list of securities ap
praised in that depression year at
$400,000 was unfolded in Dr. Wil
bur's office. According to the orig
inal plan for construction, the build
ing was to be erected as a memorial
immediately following Dr. Cubbor
ley's death. Hence the carefully in
vested securities were placed in a
fund where interest accrual would
make this plan possible.
TRUSTEES APPROVE
When, however, the securities in
creased by more than $75,000 in the
recovery upswing and by a similar
amount in interest additions, Stan
ford's Board of Trustees approver!
plans based on Dr. Cubberley's tie
sign in July, 1936. They decided to
begin construction immediately so
that, the donor himself could take an
active part in carrying out his
dream.
Appropriately enough, Dr. Cub
berley accumulated his fund for it.s
educational cause in the rendering
oi educational services. By the time
of his retirement in 1933, he had
written or edited 100 volumes of the
"Riverside Textbooks in Education"
series and 18 other books on edu
cation.
The royalties from these books,
receipts from lectures and expert
consultation services, dividends, and
interest, comprise what Dr. Cubber
ley termed his "pin money," and
that alone went into his gift to the
University.
WORKS AS EDUCATOR
Dr. Cubberley had helped t/> turn
out 2500 school teachers when the
faculty and students of the School
of Education moved into their new
quarters this fall. Now the school's
facilities include four large class
rooms, numerous upstairs work
rooms, seminar rooms, laboratories,
a 500-scat auditorium with a fully
equipped projection booth, and so
cial quarters for the California Bu
reau ol Juvenile Research.
Only the library is not, complete.
Willi the dedication over, the re
tired Dean of Education will have
this last, detail of his dream to com
plete. The shelves of the building's
150,000-vol lime library are one-third
full, and will be completely stocked
from a special purchase fund sei up
for that purpose.
CONSULTED DAILY
i During the building's construction
these last two years, Dr. Cubberley
has been consulted almost daily con
| cerning details. Foreseeing a tre
j mendous increase in the importance
of education as a university study,
the donor does not £eel sure that
the spacious new quarters will sat
isfy Stanford's requirements for
more than 20 or 30 years.
"You might say it will be a quali
tative, rather than quantitative in
crease," he predicts. "Universities
won't train many more teachers in
the future, but they will train them
far more intensively. Just as med
[ ical men once were turned out with
| a year or so of study and a little ap
' prenticeship, so teachers once were
given a high school education and
possibly a bit of normal school
training."

of Education Building to the University through the Board of Trustees at

When Dr. Cubberley walked into President Wilbur's olTice one day
10 years ago and laid down $5,000 in securities, he announced:

« "For 15 years my wife and 1 have
dreamed of making this gift.. We
want to keep it a secret, but when
I retire wo will turn over all our
pin-money to the University. It's for
a new Education building."
During these 15 years he had ap

out the decision he and his wife
made in 1013—that of devoting his
entire career to the advancement of
Stanford's rapidly expanding educa

$400,000 was unfolded in Dr. Wil
bur's office. According to the orig
inal plan for construction, the build

immediately following Dr. Cubbor

plans based on Dr. Cubberley's tie
sign in July, 1936. They decided to
begin construction immediately so
that, the donor himself could take an
active part in carrying out his
dream.
Appropriately enough, Dr. Cub
berley accumulated his fund for it.s
educational cause in the rendering
oi educational services. By the time
of his retirement in 1933, he had
written or edited 100 volumes of the
"Riverside Textbooks in Education"
series and 18 other books on edu
cation.
The royalties from these books,
receipts from lectures and expert
consultation services, dividends, and
interest, comprise what Dr. Cubber
ley termed his "pin money," and
that alone went into his gift to the
University.
WORKS AS EDUCATOR
Dr. Cubberley had helped t/> turn
out 2500 school teachers when the
faculty and students of the School
of Education moved into their new
quarters this fall. Now the school's
facilities include four large class
rooms, numerous upstairs work
rooms, seminar rooms, laboratories,
a 500-scat auditorium with a fully
equipped projection booth, and so
cial quarters for the California Bu
reau ol Juvenile Research.
Only the library is not, complete.
Willi the dedication over, the re
tired Dean of Education will have
this last, detail of his dream to com
plete. The shelves of the building's
150,000-vol lime library are one-third
full, and will be completely stocked
from a special purchase fund sei up
for that purpose.
CONSULTED DAILY
i During the building's construction
these last two years, Dr. Cubberley
has been consulted almost daily con
| cerning details. Foreseeing a tre
j mendous increase in the importance
of education as a university study,
the donor does not £eel sure that
the spacious new quarters will sat
isfy Stanford's requirements for
more than 20 or 30 years.
"You might say it will be a quali
tative, rather than quantitative in
crease," he predicts. "Universities
won't train many more teachers in
the future, but they will train them
far more intensively. Just as med
[ ical men once were turned out with
| a year or so of study and a little ap
' prenticeship, so teachers once were
given a high school education and
possibly a bit of normal school
training."

l)r. Ellwood Patterson Cubberley will see dedicated lure tomorrow his
25-year-old dream come true, when he presents the new three-story School
of Education Building to the University through the Board of Trustees at
10:it0 o'clock. It was completed this fall at a cost of $5.'{5.000.
When Dr. Cubberley walked into President Wilbur's olTice one day
10 years ago and laid down $5,000 in securities, he announced:

« "For 15 years my wife and 1 have
dreamed of making this gift.. We
want to keep it a secret, but when
I retire wo will turn over all our
pin-money to the University. It's for
a new Education building."
During these 15 years he had ap
peared the typical "underpaid pro
fessor, ' but he had been carrying
out the decision he and his wife
made in 1013—that of devoting his
entire career to the advancement of
Stanford's rapidly expanding educa
tion school.

It was this decision which caused

fered him at that time by a large
eastern university and remain here
as professor and dean of the School
of Education.
With Dr. Cubberley's retirement
in 193.3, his list of securities ap
praised in that depression year at
$400,000 was unfolded in Dr. Wil
bur's office. According to the orig
inal plan for construction, the build
ing was to be erected as a memorial
immediately following Dr. Cubbor
ley's death. Hence the carefully in
vested securities were placed in a
fund where interest accrual would
make this plan possible.
TRUSTEES APPROVE
When, however, the securities in
creased by more than $75,000 in the
recovery upswing and by a similar
amount in interest additions, Stan
ford's Board of Trustees approver!
plans based on Dr. Cubberley's tie
sign in July, 1936. They decided to
begin construction immediately so
that, the donor himself could take an
active part in carrying out his
dream.
Appropriately enough, Dr. Cub
berley accumulated his fund for it.s
educational cause in the rendering
oi educational services. By the time
of his retirement in 1933, he had
written or edited 100 volumes of the
"Riverside Textbooks in Education"
series and 18 other books on edu
cation.
The royalties from these books,
receipts from lectures and expert
consultation services, dividends, and
interest, comprise what Dr. Cubber
ley termed his "pin money," and
that alone went into his gift to the
University.
WORKS AS EDUCATOR
Dr. Cubberley had helped t/> turn
out 2500 school teachers when the
faculty and students of the School
of Education moved into their new
quarters this fall. Now the school's
facilities include four large class
rooms, numerous upstairs work
rooms, seminar rooms, laboratories,
a 500-scat auditorium with a fully
equipped projection booth, and so
cial quarters for the California Bu
reau ol Juvenile Research.
Only the library is not, complete.
Willi the dedication over, the re
tired Dean of Education will have
this last, detail of his dream to com
plete. The shelves of the building's
150,000-vol lime library are one-third
full, and will be completely stocked
from a special purchase fund sei up
for that purpose.
CONSULTED DAILY
i During the building's construction
these last two years, Dr. Cubberley
has been consulted almost daily con
| cerning details. Foreseeing a tre
j mendous increase in the importance
of education as a university study,
the donor does not £eel sure that
the spacious new quarters will sat
isfy Stanford's requirements for
more than 20 or 30 years.
"You might say it will be a quali
tative, rather than quantitative in
crease," he predicts. "Universities
won't train many more teachers in
the future, but they will train them
far more intensively. Just as med
[ ical men once were turned out with
| a year or so of study and a little ap
' prenticeship, so teachers once were
given a high school education and
possibly a bit of normal school
training."
