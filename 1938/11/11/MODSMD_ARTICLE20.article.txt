THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION
The Editor, Sir:
The question of the status of stu
dent body cards is the subject of
general debate. A paragraph in
Wednesday's Daily concerning A1
Horn's preliminary report on the
matter, which hinted that the BA.C.
might adopt a unified policy of
charging students for admission to
gpmes in which students participate,
served merely to confuse the issue
in the minds of those who have only
the layman's viewpoint in regard to
campus government.
The editor is urged to consider the
suggestion that he clarify a situa
tion in which the athletic office ap
pears to be able to subtract one of
the privileges ostensibly granted by
the university and represented by
the card. For instance, just what are
the "other privileges" (in addition to
"preliminary games") accorded by
the Associated Students "to them
selves by moans of the certificate of
registration," or student body card?
And in return for these privileges,
what compensation is made to whom
by us Associated Students.
Heil Masters!
