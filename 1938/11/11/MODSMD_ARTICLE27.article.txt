# Polo Squad To Meet Monterey
## 
### 
Major Harry Allen's new stream
lined Card polo squad will ride on to
the highway field at 2:30 o'clock this
afternoon in their firs't official match
of the season when they meet the
powerful Monterey Presidio officers'
team. The presidio group, led by
Major Gerhardt, who himself has a
six-goal rating and is a ranking
army player, is one of the highest
goal teams the Indians meet.
While the Cards are not given
goal ratings by the polo association,
many returning veterans under the
masterful direction of Major Allen
have begun to shape up into a team
that will show some high class polo
in this afternoon's match. Major
Allen, a ranking army poloist and
all-around college athlete who
coaches the Indians for the first time
this season, has put the squad
through an intensive scientific train
ing period as they point toward their
big game during the Thanksgiving
vacation with the University of Ari
zona.

Under his direction polo is taught, j
as any team game, with plays, form- j
at ions, and chalk talks.
The starting Farm line-up will j
probably consist of Walt Sullivan :
at No. 1, Jim Fullerton (c) at No. 2. j
Steve Downey at No. 3, and Bert
McClintock at No. 4. Substitutions !
will depend on the way the game j
goes, but will be made from the A i
squad only.
Every Wednesday at 3 o'clock on i
the highway field round robin >
scrimmages among the 5 A squad'
teams will continue. The games as j
well as scrimmages are free to the ,
public and offer students a fine op
portunity to see first-rate polo ;
played here on the campus.
