Resolved to wipe the blemish oc- j
casioned by the San Jose State j
double victory from thei rescutch- i
eon, the Maloney-led Indian soccer I
varsity warms up this afternoon in j
its final practice session before the j
;"big game" with the league-leading
| California Bears, scheduled for to
] morrow morning at 10:15 o'clock on j
j the Card varsity field.
A team captain will be elected this '
j afternoon during the practice, ac- 1
[ cording to Coach Harry Maloney, ;
! who requested that all squad mem- i
| bers turn out for the meeting.
Indian chances in the big game are j
jgood, according to Maloney, who
I summed up the team's chances with,
"It all depends on the forward line."
OFFENSE WEAKNESS
Weaknesses in offense, he said, are
due to failure to get the ball away
in time, inaccuracy in passes and
shots, faulty team-work, and letting
opponents get to the ball first.
Defensive play during varsity
games has always been on a high
level this season. Many termed the
j backfield play in the game with San
Jose State Wednesday the "best de
' fensive exhibition ever given by a
| Stanford soccer team."
Even a victory in Ihe Cal series
will not give the Cards a win in the
I conference race. However, should
j the Indians defeat the Bears in the
; round-robin match, they will win
| the title of Intercollegiate Cham
pions.
