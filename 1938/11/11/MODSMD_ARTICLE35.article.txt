### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
A STUDIO preview of the 1938Â»
* Big Game will be presented in
Corvallis tomorrow in the form of
an Indian-Beaver grid battle.
Except for a dazzling array of ;
orange uniforms, Lon Stiner's grid
machine is the living image of the
one that is warming up over in Ber- ;
keley for its annual tussle over a
chromium-plated axe.
Oregon State football, featuring ;
the short punt and the single wing- j
back formation, is copied from the I
system that gave California a j
"Wonder Team."
Beavers copy the Bears, and they i
do a good job of it. In fact, they j

looked every bit j
as good as the vie- |
tors in the Cal - j
Oregon State tus- j
sle, although they J
came out on the |
short end of a 13- ;

7 score. So it takes a really good
team to stop Oregon State, a col
lege we all thought hadn't a chance.
The Cards are a team that can do
it. And if Stanford passes click as
| they did yesterday in the last home
1 practice, they will.
INDIAN soccer teams will take
the stage on campus tomorrow in
an attempt to break winning
j streaks of frosh and varsity Gold
j en Bear hooters.
Strictly a fourth-quarter team,
the Cal varsity has counted on a
strong forward wall to chalk up
high scores and victories over all
; opponents so far. The Cubs are
| heavier and just as fast as the
j Papoos.es.
j It would seem that the Cards are
I a far cry from conference honors in

that they will
have to swamp
the Bears tomor
row and again a
week later on
the Berkeley
field before they
wil lhave a shot
at the crown.
And then it will
be for only a tie
unless the Bears
play to a tie or
loss against some
other team.

But Stanford's hooters have
played fine hall in every game this
season and have not been decisive
ly defeated. They'll be underdogs
with a good chance tomorrow, and
there will be plenty of thrills and
good athletic entertainment for all
who are on the sidelines in soc
cer's Big Game.
* >!<
Splashing around Los Angeles this
week-end will be Stanford's Big Red
Battleship, still in the running for

conference water
polo crown. The
Cards will attempt
to repeat two vic
tories won in
home waters over
Bruins and Tro
jans with an eye
to the future and
two games with

Cal to complete the distribution of

final conference honors.
Appearance of Captain John Lamb
on crutches thus week lengthened
the faces of his team-mates, but
things will not be so bad as they
look. The lanky southpaw scorer j
will be ready to play this afternoon j
and will lack only the advantage of j
a couple days' training.
I INE of the nation's finest polo
teams will come to the Stan- 1
ford campus today from the Mon- j
teroy Presidio to demonstrate polo j
as it is played in the best circles. !
Led by Major Gerhardt, a six-goal ;
rider (ten-goal is the highest rat- j
ing possible), the Monterey officers |
have a better team rating than any I
other opponent of the Stanford j
varsity.
With today's game. Card polo- j
ists swing into action for the 1938 i
polo season. They will go to Gold- j
en (late Park a week from Sun- !
day to play San Mateo Polo Club i
for charity, and the following |
Tuesday they'll hop the Daylight !
for the South and Tuscon, where j
they will play their biggest game
of the season with a crack quar- i
tet of riders from the University
i of Arizona.
VV'OMEN will do their part to
| morrow in carrying the Stan
i ford sports banner against Mills
; College and University of California
I in the biggest athletic event of the
i year lor Stanford's weaker sex, the
i annual tri-sports competition.
| Hockey, fencing, archery, tennis,
j and golf will be the order of the day.
And if you think there's no such
i thing as the Athletic type" in wom
jen, just drop over tomorrow and
' watch Stanford's Eleven Hundred at
! play.
