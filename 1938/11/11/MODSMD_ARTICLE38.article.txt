# Concrete and the Man
## 
### 
CONCRETE ribbed with steel, arched corri
dors, spacious rooms and wide hallways,
housing for books, for people, for knowledge:
physical portion of Stanford's New Education
Building to be dedicated tomorrow.
Inside, walk down those wide hallways, past
large, richly furnished offices, past all the glass
doors to a small, tucked-away, glass-doored of
fice under the stairs with a name on the door:
Ellwood P. Cubberley.
Inside the half-million concrete building is
that office, inconspicuous, quiet with the seren
ity of the man inside it, the serenity and dignity
of the man whose gift will be dedicated to
morrow.
For then Stanford will stand by while certain
ceremonies are conducted, ceremonies of dedi
cation that will mark the official opening of the
building. But the real dedication has already
taken place.
No one noticed it when Ellwood Cubberley
dedicated the building to Stanford; it happened
long ago when he came to Stanford and de
voted years of constant service to the Univer
sity. The dedication ceremonies opened on the
day when he spoke his first lecture.
They ended when, to the University, he
quietly gave the money that was to be his new
building. The quiet close to ihe ceremony be
spoke little of what had gone on between its
opening and closing—of the years of work he
freely gave to Stanford, of the bounty of his
personality that enriched the life of his co
workers and his students, and finally, of the
reward which was his for independent work
in his field—his books. That reward was his,
his to keep.
But, as he had given of all else, that too was
dedicated to the ideal which Stanford repre
sented to him, the ideal which Ellwood Cub
berley and his wife had made a reality

offices, books and scholars, a ceremony:

To loyalty, to an ideal, to a man who through
Stanford dedicated himself to these.
