STATUS of student body cards still remains
doubtful and The Daily has been called
upon for clarification.
Consensus of student investigators and B.A.C.
officials first of all seems to be that A.S.S.U.
cards are for once and for all not transferable.
This action has been recommended by Ex Com
mittee's student committee and such recom
mendation will be passed on to the Board of
Athletic Control.
Special query has been directed in regard to
a hint "that the B.A.C. might adopt a unified
policy of charging students for admission to
games in which students participate."
The policy that has been adopted in this re
gard is that "if cards are transferable" such a
practice might be found necessary; otherwise,
a certain part of the general public would be
able to borrow student body cards and see
games for nothing from the rooting section,
while other members of the public, unable to
borrow cards, would have to purchase general
admission tickets.
There is, however, no danger that students
will be charged admission on a "unified policy"
basis, so long as cards are not transferable and
so long as students do not force the B.A.C. and
the University to such an extreme.
In other words, the student body card situa

tion will remain on a status quo basis, unless
loaned cards are depriving the B.A.C. and, ul
timately, the University from legitimate reve
nue.
"Other privileges accorded by the Associated
Students to themselves by means of the stu
dent body card" no doubt include such things
as a means of identification for use of the
library; admission to all athletic contests, ex
cept those with Cal and S.C.; admission to nu
merous dramatic productions throughout the
year; a score of other social events.
The situation, then, is clear: if cards remain
non - transferable, as they undoubtedly will,
Stanford will use its card as it always has, and
with the same game privileges.â€”H. L. S.
