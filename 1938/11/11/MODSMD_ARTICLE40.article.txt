# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
REQUIEM IN RED
A MERICA will observe Armistice Day this morning,
using the memory of our war dead as a spring
board for oratorical acrobatics and emotional high
dives. At Stanford we will place a wreath in the
church and then wait for a silent GO seconds. In that
minute, some of us will wonder in an idle soil of way
whether our war dead wouldn't feel a little cheated at
being forced to trade their lives for a moment of
reverent silence; to a nation of hard bargainers, the
price seems a bit high. Some of us will stare in politely
suspended animation at the back of the pew in front,
and some will stir restlessly at the thought of 11
o'clock classes.
But most of America will not be satisfied with so
ruild a ceremony. It wants action and drama; it de
mands an emotional binge that will combine the better
features of a good football game and a tear-jerking
movie.
»:« >|t j.t *
There will be parades, so that young shoe clerks
can display their National Guard uniforms and their
salesgirl sweethearts can jam the sidewalks to be im
pressed by lines of rifles slanting out from an olive
drab background. The men get a mild taste of the
emotional intoxication that comes with war. They find
this physical imitation of a hero a stimulating substi
tute for day-dreaming. The women have a chance to
cast themselves in the martyr roles; they enjoy a pre
view of the bitter-sweet thrill of sending their sweet
hearts off to war.
Some of the older men like it, too. There is a
type of man who reaches his happiest moments only
when he has crammed himself into khaki trousers,
hitched up his Elk's watch-fob, and joined the weav
ing ranks of marching "veterans."
* * * *
/4RATORS of all sorts have a beautiful time. Ar
mistice Day is the open season on cliche, and no
bedraggled phrase is outlawed. Rolling terms, like
"the ideals of our forefathers" and "the noble patriot
ism that inspired this supreme sacrifice," are geysered
forth at every assembly.
Participants come through the ceremonies feeling
very patriotic and proud of themselves. They have
convinced themselves that they are courageous bul
warks of liberty, who are ready to fight for their
ideals.
# * At *
All of this seems a poor sort of way to render trib
ute to men who were dragged out of normal, peaceful
lives and shoved into a French mudhole to be killed.
But the bad taste of it is not dangerous. The real evil
lies in the martial spirit it whips up, in the self
satisfied exhibitionism it arouses.
The people who dabble in emotional stimulation find
it growing on them. They are not satisfied with a few
parades and speeches. They forget that peace is a
frame of mind as well as a diplomatic circumstance.
And so the traditional American Armistice Day be
comes simply propaganda for another war.
' Stanford will lay a wreath on an altar and attempt
to Rive one minute's thought to the question of war
and peace. Most of America will go on an emotional
binge, using the memory of the war dead as an excuse.
Somehow, I don't think the war dead would like it.

There will be parades, so that young shoe clerks
can display their National Guard uniforms and their
salesgirl sweethearts can jam the sidewalks to be im

drab background. The men get a mild taste of the
emotional intoxication that comes with war. They find
this physical imitation of a hero a stimulating substi

cast themselves in the martyr roles; they enjoy a pre
view of the bitter-sweet thrill of sending their sweet

mistice Day is the open season on cliche, and no
bedraggled phrase is outlawed. Rolling terms, like
"the ideals of our forefathers" and "the noble patriot
ism that inspired this supreme sacrifice," are geysered
forth at every assembly.
Participants come through the ceremonies feeling
very patriotic and proud of themselves. They have
convinced themselves that they are courageous bul
warks of liberty, who are ready to fight for their

All of this seems a poor sort of way to render trib
ute to men who were dragged out of normal, peaceful
lives and shoved into a French mudhole to be killed.
But the bad taste of it is not dangerous. The real evil
lies in the martial spirit it whips up, in the self
satisfied exhibitionism it arouses.
The people who dabble in emotional stimulation find
it growing on them. They are not satisfied with a few
parades and speeches. They forget that peace is a
frame of mind as well as a diplomatic circumstance.
And so the traditional American Armistice Day be
comes simply propaganda for another war.
' Stanford will lay a wreath on an altar and attempt
to Rive one minute's thought to the question of war
and peace. Most of America will go on an emotional
binge, using the memory of the war dead as an excuse.
Somehow, I don't think the war dead would like it.
REQUIEM IN RED
A MERICA will observe Armistice Day this morning,
using the memory of our war dead as a spring
board for oratorical acrobatics and emotional high
dives. At Stanford we will place a wreath in the
church and then wait for a silent GO seconds. In that
minute, some of us will wonder in an idle soil of way
whether our war dead wouldn't feel a little cheated at
being forced to trade their lives for a moment of
reverent silence; to a nation of hard bargainers, the
price seems a bit high. Some of us will stare in politely
suspended animation at the back of the pew in front,
and some will stir restlessly at the thought of 11
o'clock classes.
But most of America will not be satisfied with so
ruild a ceremony. It wants action and drama; it de
mands an emotional binge that will combine the better
