¥ WAS quite surprised yesterday afternoon. I Hot a
post-card—from a reader.
From a woman.
Who is married to a grad student here.
She and her husband, she writes, have the tradi
j tional Stanford habit of picking up people coming be
■ tween the campus and Palo Alto.
; Wednesday afternoon she picked up a couple of
guys, a couple of big guys. "Extra husky," she calls
Ihem. About half way to town she got a flat. As soon
as the car stopped, the two big boys got out.
And immediately got a ride in another car going
to Palo Alto, leaving her there with the flat tire.
A couple of Stanford gentlemen. Yeah.
Wednesday night I went, to the concert, and as al
ways happens when I go to anything like that, my
throat goes bad on me and I have to cough. I was
trying very hard not to cough. I knew all the time I
was making some pretty funny sounds about it, but
I didn't know I was sounding like a horse.
Until a nice lady sitting in front of me turned
around and gave me a lump of sugar.

Yesterday a professor was lecturing quite vigorous
ly in his class. All of a sudden he stopped and bel
lowed to a guy in the fourth row, "Did you want to
ask a question?"
"Nope," the guy said. "Just scratching."

TRI DELT was sitting in her room the other night
eating from a box of candy. Some of the sisters
came in.
"What's that?" they coyly asked, pointing to the
candy.
"Oh, candy."
"What kind of candy?" They were still being coy
about it.
"Have some," the gal said, getting to the point.
"Johnny (fictitious name) gave it to me. His father
gave it to him for his birthday, and he doesn't like
chocolates, so he gave it to me."
Her sisters did have some.
The Tri Delt. also had a book which she was read
ing when her sisters came in.
After they had eaten of the candy, her sisters
asked her coyly, "What's that?"
"Oh, a book."
"Did Johnny give it to you?"
"Yes, his father gave it to him for his birthday.
I and he hasn t time to read it, so he gave it to me."
Her sisters now have the book in the house library.

about it.
"Have some," the gal said, getting to the point.
"Johnny (fictitious name) gave it to me. His father
gave it to him for his birthday, and he doesn't like
chocolates, so he gave it to me."
Her sisters did have some.
The Tri Delt. also had a book which she was read
ing when her sisters came in.
After they had eaten of the candy, her sisters
asked her coyly, "What's that?"
"Oh, a book."
"Did Johnny give it to you?"
"Yes, his father gave it to him for his birthday.
I and he hasn t time to read it, so he gave it to me."
Her sisters now have the book in the house library.

i Overheard at the concert right after the Bach num
' ber, someone saying quite violently. "Rut 1 jnst don't
like Wagner."
¥ WAS quite surprised yesterday afternoon. I Hot a
post-card—from a reader.
From a woman.
Who is married to a grad student here.
She and her husband, she writes, have the tradi
j tional Stanford habit of picking up people coming be
■ tween the campus and Palo Alto.
; Wednesday afternoon she picked up a couple of
guys, a couple of big guys. "Extra husky," she calls
Ihem. About half way to town she got a flat. As soon
as the car stopped, the two big boys got out.
And immediately got a ride in another car going
to Palo Alto, leaving her there with the flat tire.
A couple of Stanford gentlemen. Yeah.
Wednesday night I went, to the concert, and as al
ways happens when I go to anything like that, my
throat goes bad on me and I have to cough. I was
trying very hard not to cough. I knew all the time I
was making some pretty funny sounds about it, but
I didn't know I was sounding like a horse.
Until a nice lady sitting in front of me turned
around and gave me a lump of sugar.

Yesterday a professor was lecturing quite vigorous
ly in his class. All of a sudden he stopped and bel
lowed to a guy in the fourth row, "Did you want to
ask a question?"
"Nope," the guy said. "Just scratching."

TRI DELT was sitting in her room the other night
eating from a box of candy. Some of the sisters
came in.
"What's that?" they coyly asked, pointing to the
candy.
"Oh, candy."
"What kind of candy?" They were still being coy
about it.
"Have some," the gal said, getting to the point.
"Johnny (fictitious name) gave it to me. His father
gave it to him for his birthday, and he doesn't like
chocolates, so he gave it to me."
