# Pons, Pinza Win Acclaim In 'Coq d'Or'
## 
### 
"LE COQ DOR' by Rinisky- •
Korsakov, season's f'uial opera.
A splendid vision, the glittering, ;
fairy-like opera, "Le Coq d'Or" by
the Russian master, Rimsky-Korsa
kov, with its vaporous melody,
whimsical humor, spectacular set
tings, and colorl'ul symphony lightly

and extravagantly
brought the San
Francisco opera
season to a suc
cessful close.
Performed fo r
the first time in
San Francisco in
its original ver
sion, *'Le Coq
d'Or" proved
Rimsky's complete

mastery of the bright-hued music
which delicately casts a spell of
reality across a bizarre, ethereal
theme — dissolving the mists of the
past to disclose the magnificence of
an ancient court.
PINZAL EXCELS
Ezio Pinza as the foolish, infatu
ated old King Dodon received most
acclaim for a thoroughly artistic
performance in which he achieved
a rhythmic balance between the hu

morous pantomime of his role, and J
the dramatic qualities of his voice. |
As the lovely, mischievous Queen j
of Shemalca, Lily Pons rises to the
heights, both in the silvery quality
of her exquisite voice, and her
graceful, swaying action sequences.
The famous "Hymn to the Sun"
aria in the second act, sets off the
expressive technique of her voice
superbly.
The voice of the Golden Cock
which piercingly warns King Dodon
in startling melody each time dan
ger is approaching, was aptly sung
by the dramatic soprano, Thelma
Votipka.
CAPTIVATING MUSIC
The captivating sleep scene music,
the spectral music accompanying the
march of King Dodon and his sol
diers to the ghostly glen where his
sons lie slain, the colorful sym
phonic accompaniments of the
bridal procession, and the wailing
chorus of King Dodon's people at his
death—all combine to bring out the
social and dramatic implications of
j the opera, and its Russian folk
j quality.
Credit should also be given to
I Nicholas, Masseu, as the Astrologer;

Norman Cordon, as General Polkan;
Doris Dow, as Amelfa; and Con
ductor Gennaro Papi, whose fine ef
forts helped blend the whole into a
brilliantly sensitive performance,
fully worthy of its place as the cul
minating operatic work of the 1938
San Francisco opera season.
