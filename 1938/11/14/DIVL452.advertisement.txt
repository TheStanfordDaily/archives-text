Scarlet and Black
by STENDHAL
translated from the French by C. K. SCOTT-MONCRTFFF
(In tno volumes)
"One of the great, absorbing novels of the world," Scarlet and Black
is a brilliant story of success and excess. The life-history of a
French peasant who rises in the world, using ruthlessly every
honorable and dishonorable means, it offers an intensive psycho
logical study of middle-class French life — in the Paris and in the
provinces of the early 19th century.
EVERYMAN'S LIBRARY
contains over 200 other novels, and over 900 separate volumes in
all, on almost every conceivable subject, from politics to poetry.
Its scope is greater than that of any standard library. "Its con
venient size, its readable type, its careful editing and its rejection
of all but the best, as proved by time, have given it an honored
place. There are few books of established fame, available in
English, that are not obtainable from its list."--New York' Timet•
