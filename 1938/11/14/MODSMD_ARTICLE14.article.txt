# Songs of Farm Students to Be Gaieties Solos
## Mixed Glee Clubs, Band to Contribute Musical Background 
### 
Eleven songs by campus compos- j
ers, ten solo vocalists, the largest J
band to appear with a Farm show, i
arrangements by Myron Birnbaum,
and the Stanford Men's and Wom
en's Glee Clubs will highlight the
Big Game Gaieties next Friday
aflemoon and evening in the Me
morial Hall, it was announced yes
terday by J. P. Cahn, director.
The University glee clubs are ex
pected to play a large part in mak
ing this year's Gaieties an excep
tional musical show, Cahn dis
closed. Versatility has been dis
played by the organizations in offer
ing the campus programs ranging
from classical music to popular, he
said, yet have never before at
tempted anything but what might
be called other than choral work.
CHORAL BACKGROUND
This year, however, Stanford's
glee clubs are offering their serv
ices as a choral background for the
musical numbers of the Gaieties.
The background is an innovation in
modem orchestral work, and has
been used with great success by
Fred Waring.
The use of the choral back
ground involved much technical
skill in bringing, in fading, in shad
ing the music. Properly done, it
adds to the depth and richness of
the music. Delicacies in shading
improve tone and bring out certain
qualities of the music which would
not otherwise be attainable.
OLD GAIETIES SONGS
A double sextette will sing songs
from Gaieties going back to 1904. Its
members are Jane Roth, Elizabeth
Meyer, Lucille Laney, Betty Dean,
Kathleen Anderson, Marian Guysel
man, Herbert Woolley, Scott Rice,
Oliver Cope, Dick Payne, John Hol
tom, and Henry Kent.
"Urban," tone poem by Hank
Rhoades, is expected to be effective
with the use of a full choral back
ground. George Knoles directs the
combined musical groups.
