# Capt. Jack Lloyd 'Still a Kid,' But Spins 70-Year Old Yarn
## 
### HARRY SHELDON 
"Burning Daylight" landed smack
in the middle of the Inner Quad,
last Thursday, a pair of high-heel
riding boots supporting his bow
legged frame, a shoulder-length
shock of white hair under his wide
brimmed Stetson.
"Look any man right square in
the eye, and tell him to go to hell
it necessary," he philosophized as
he spun the yarn of his life, more
than his life; in fact, the story of a
passing era.
But he didn't tell that story as a
Had one—he told it with a sparkle in
his eyes and a beam behind his
BufTalo Bill Cody goatee. In his
own words, "I'm still a kid. Yep, it's
the old fossils that's holding me
back and holding you back, and the
rest of us kids.
STILL A KID
"Ye're as old as ya let old man
brain tell ya and I'm still a kid in
my mind here — psychology's the
thing.'
This from a man of 70, known the
world over as Captain Jack Lloyd,
soldier-of-fortune, hero of Jack
London's novel, "Burning Daylight,"
and old-time cattle-driver and In
dian fighter.
\\ hen Capt. Lloyd appeared, he
didn't ride in on a painted horse—
no, he rode in on a modem stream
lined bus to collect a mental pic
lure of Stanford—one of the few
"great universities of the world I
ain't seen."
LIFE STORY STARTS
Captain Lloyd's yarn starts in '68
when lie was left an orphan at the
aye of five—his mother and father
massacred during an Indian raid.
Picked up by cattle crews driving
north to Abilene, and farther North,
and yet still farther North, at 12
he was on his own, and had already
been adopted by a young lady,
popularly known as "Calamity Jane."
At 18, he joined the Texas Rang
ers and, during the period follow
ing, as a peace officer he claims to
have met and beaten to the draw
better than 67 of the West's bad men
in his travels throughout Montana,
Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mex
ico, Placer County of California, and
Idaho.
SEARCH FOR GOLD
He combined his talents with a
six-shooter with a chase for the
yellow metal "he's still searching for
—gold.
"Haven't never given up the chase
to find the fabulous pot o' gold at

the end of the rainbow," he drawls,
"and I'm still lookin' fur it.
"Lots of times when I went into
the gold camps an' they found out I
was a fast two-gun man, they'd make
me marshal to clean tilings up.
"If the town bully wouldn't talk
sense, we'd go fur our guns—well,
I'm still here."
67 DIE
Briefly, that's the story behind the
67 Boot Hill victims, fK) per cent of
thorn killed in Capt. Lloyd's capacity
as a peace officer.
Out-Greying Zane Grey, the Cap
tain diverges now and then to recol
lections of other early Western
characters, and recalls tales of Judge
Roy Elam Bean, the "Law West of
the Pecos," and Judge Isaac Park
er's Hanging Court, where more
than 100 outlaws met their doom on
the scaffold that was built, in the
courtyard.
WESTERN JUSTICE
Approximately 90 per cent went
out feet first from the latter Hall of
Justice, he says, i
"Didn't have no habeas corpus in
them days. By golly, if a man 'as
found guilty, he out the back
door to the scaffold."
As things got tame in the Wild
West, where he had seen Wild Bill
Hickok die and whose six-shooter
he still carries, Capt. Lloyd fol
lowed the restless urge of the yel
low metal northward to Alaska. It
was here that he met Jack London
and where the latter wrote of his
life.
ALASKA TO AFRICA
As the Yukon and Dawson coun
try toned down, the urge to move
on arose again. This time, the Cap
tain went to South Africa after dia
monds and gold, but ended up in
the Boer War.
Soldier-of-fortune he became, and
has since fought in four major wars,
16 revolutions, and in too many skir
mishes to count. He fought the Boers,
he rode with Teddy Roosevelt as a
Rough Rider in the Spanish-Ameu
ican conflict; he was a member of
the Legion of Death in the Russo-
I Japanese war; and was with a Brit
| ish Intelligence Outfit during the
| World War.
j Besides all this, "I done my hitch
j in the French Foreign Legion. When
i a man does his time in that outfit,
j he kin face anything in the world."
WAR AND REVOLUTION
Among revolutionaries, Capt.
Lloyd rode for three and a half
years with Pancho Villa, was with
Wing Fu Chau in North China, and
has fought with General Lee Christ
, mas, Ted Malone, Tex O'Reilly,
I Sammy Dereden, the "Fighting Jew,"
Carl Butler, Jack White, and Gen
eral Jim Standlee.
I "I've fought with a lot of others,
I too, when we got paid $.">0 a day in
1 gold—and paid every morning or we
J refused to touch our machine guns."
; FIGHTING ENDS
The Captain's fighting life ended
in the World War, when he was
gassed and lost all his teeth, and
since then he's prowled the world,
! "always lookin' fur excitement, in
j stead of goin' to the poor farm.
"I don't believe in warfare, the
; way it is today," he comments, add
! ing that "before the next war, the
United States, Great Britain, and
Russia will fight the rest of the
world.
! "Why?
"Because those countries have !)2

per cent of the oil produced in the
world—and no military-mad power
is any good without that.
"But it's gonna be funny when the
other side's got to run its airplanes
with coal and wants to loop-the
loop."
'HAM AND EGGS'
As to "Ham and Eggs," he re
sponds, "All I want's the right to get
out and live. I don't want no $30
a week.
"It's the same with all Western
ers; they don't want no charity.
That ain't the spirit of the Old West.
We all got to work together in this
country."
With which, one of the last of the
Old West's descendants trailed back
to the present, bunched his silver
hair under his sombrero, picked up
the ebony eane given him by Ma
hatma Ghandi, the 'man with the
diapers," and started for the Grey
hound hitching rack in Paly.
Headed south, "still Jookin' fur ex
citement," the old gunman is drift
ing happily toward the time that
someone drags his boots off . . .
toward the time he joins the last
round-up, where life is an endless
eternity . . .
Toward the time he spits in the
devil's eye and cracks, "Go fur yer
guns, you—l'm takin' over this man's
town."

SEARCH FOR GOLD
He combined his talents with a
six-shooter with a chase for the
yellow metal "he's still searching for
—gold.
"Haven't never given up the chase
to find the fabulous pot o' gold at

the end of the rainbow," he drawls,
"and I'm still lookin' fur it.
"Lots of times when I went into

67 DIE
Briefly, that's the story behind the
67 Boot Hill victims, fK) per cent of
thorn killed in Capt. Lloyd's capacity
as a peace officer.
Out-Greying Zane Grey, the Cap
tain diverges now and then to recol
lections of other early Western
characters, and recalls tales of Judge
Roy Elam Bean, the "Law West of
the Pecos," and Judge Isaac Park
er's Hanging Court, where more
than 100 outlaws met their doom on
the scaffold that was built, in the
courtyard.
WESTERN JUSTICE
Approximately 90 per cent went
out feet first from the latter Hall of
Justice, he says, i
"Didn't have no habeas corpus in
them days. By golly, if a man 'as
found guilty, he out the back
door to the scaffold."
As things got tame in the Wild
West, where he had seen Wild Bill
Hickok die and whose six-shooter
he still carries, Capt. Lloyd fol
lowed the restless urge of the yel
low metal northward to Alaska. It
was here that he met Jack London
and where the latter wrote of his
life.
ALASKA TO AFRICA
As the Yukon and Dawson coun
try toned down, the urge to move
on arose again. This time, the Cap
tain went to South Africa after dia
monds and gold, but ended up in
the Boer War.
Soldier-of-fortune he became, and
has since fought in four major wars,
16 revolutions, and in too many skir
mishes to count. He fought the Boers,
he rode with Teddy Roosevelt as a
Rough Rider in the Spanish-Ameu
ican conflict; he was a member of
the Legion of Death in the Russo-
I Japanese war; and was with a Brit
| ish Intelligence Outfit during the
| World War.
j Besides all this, "I done my hitch
j in the French Foreign Legion. When
i a man does his time in that outfit,
j he kin face anything in the world."
WAR AND REVOLUTION
Among revolutionaries, Capt.
Lloyd rode for three and a half
years with Pancho Villa, was with
Wing Fu Chau in North China, and
has fought with General Lee Christ
, mas, Ted Malone, Tex O'Reilly,
I Sammy Dereden, the "Fighting Jew,"
Carl Butler, Jack White, and Gen
eral Jim Standlee.
I "I've fought with a lot of others,
I too, when we got paid $.">0 a day in
1 gold—and paid every morning or we
J refused to touch our machine guns."
; FIGHTING ENDS
The Captain's fighting life ended
in the World War, when he was
gassed and lost all his teeth, and
since then he's prowled the world,
! "always lookin' fur excitement, in
j stead of goin' to the poor farm.
"I don't believe in warfare, the
; way it is today," he comments, add
! ing that "before the next war, the
United States, Great Britain, and
Russia will fight the rest of the
world.
! "Why?
"Because those countries have !)2

per cent of the oil produced in the
world—and no military-mad power
is any good without that.
"But it's gonna be funny when the
other side's got to run its airplanes
with coal and wants to loop-the
loop."
'HAM AND EGGS'
As to "Ham and Eggs," he re
sponds, "All I want's the right to get
out and live. I don't want no $30
a week.
"It's the same with all Western
ers; they don't want no charity.
That ain't the spirit of the Old West.
We all got to work together in this
country."
With which, one of the last of the
Old West's descendants trailed back

hound hitching rack in Paly.
Headed south, "still Jookin' fur ex
citement," the old gunman is drift
ing happily toward the time that
someone drags his boots off . . .
toward the time he joins the last
round-up, where life is an endless
eternity . . .
Toward the time he spits in the
devil's eye and cracks, "Go fur yer
guns, you—l'm takin' over this man's
town."
"Burning Daylight" landed smack
in the middle of the Inner Quad,
last Thursday, a pair of high-heel
riding boots supporting his bow
legged frame, a shoulder-length
shock of white hair under his wide
brimmed Stetson.
"Look any man right square in
the eye, and tell him to go to hell
it necessary," he philosophized as
he spun the yarn of his life, more
than his life; in fact, the story of a
passing era.
But he didn't tell that story as a
Had one—he told it with a sparkle in
his eyes and a beam behind his
BufTalo Bill Cody goatee. In his
own words, "I'm still a kid. Yep, it's
the old fossils that's holding me
back and holding you back, and the

LIFE STORY STARTS
Captain Lloyd's yarn starts in '68

massacred during an Indian raid.

tain went to South Africa after dia
monds and gold, but ended up in
the Boer War.
Soldier-of-fortune he became, and
has since fought in four major wars,
16 revolutions, and in too many skir
mishes to count. He fought the Boers,
he rode with Teddy Roosevelt as a
Rough Rider in the Spanish-Ameu
ican conflict; he was a member of
the Legion of Death in the Russo-

WAR AND REVOLUTION
Among revolutionaries, Capt.

years with Pancho Villa, was with
Wing Fu Chau in North China, and
has fought with General Lee Christ

I Sammy Dereden, the "Fighting Jew,"
Carl Butler, Jack White, and Gen

; FIGHTING ENDS
The Captain's fighting life ended
in the World War, when he was
gassed and lost all his teeth, and
since then he's prowled the world,
! "always lookin' fur excitement, in
j stead of goin' to the poor farm.
"I don't believe in warfare, the
; way it is today," he comments, add
! ing that "before the next war, the
United States, Great Britain, and
Russia will fight the rest of the
world.
! "Why?
"Because those countries have !)2

per cent of the oil produced in the
world—and no military-mad power
is any good without that.
"But it's gonna be funny when the
other side's got to run its airplanes
with coal and wants to loop-the
loop."
'HAM AND EGGS'
As to "Ham and Eggs," he re
sponds, "All I want's the right to get
out and live. I don't want no $30
a week.
"It's the same with all Western
ers; they don't want no charity.
That ain't the spirit of the Old West.
We all got to work together in this
country."
With which, one of the last of the
Old West's descendants trailed back
to the present, bunched his silver
hair under his sombrero, picked up
the ebony eane given him by Ma
hatma Ghandi, the 'man with the

hound hitching rack in Paly.
Headed south, "still Jookin' fur ex
citement," the old gunman is drift
ing happily toward the time that
someone drags his boots off . . .
toward the time he joins the last
round-up, where life is an endless
eternity . . .
Toward the time he spits in the
devil's eye and cracks, "Go fur yer
guns, you—l'm takin' over this man's
town."
"Burning Daylight" landed smack
in the middle of the Inner Quad,
last Thursday, a pair of high-heel
riding boots supporting his bow
legged frame, a shoulder-length
shock of white hair under his wide
brimmed Stetson.
"Look any man right square in
the eye, and tell him to go to hell
it necessary," he philosophized as
he spun the yarn of his life, more
than his life; in fact, the story of a
passing era.
But he didn't tell that story as a
Had one—he told it with a sparkle in
his eyes and a beam behind his
BufTalo Bill Cody goatee. In his
own words, "I'm still a kid. Yep, it's
the old fossils that's holding me
back and holding you back, and the
rest of us kids.
STILL A KID
"Ye're as old as ya let old man
brain tell ya and I'm still a kid in
my mind here — psychology's the
thing.'
This from a man of 70, known the
world over as Captain Jack Lloyd,
soldier-of-fortune, hero of Jack
London's novel, "Burning Daylight,"
and old-time cattle-driver and In
dian fighter.
\\ hen Capt. Lloyd appeared, he
didn't ride in on a painted horse—
no, he rode in on a modem stream
lined bus to collect a mental pic
lure of Stanford—one of the few
"great universities of the world I
ain't seen."
LIFE STORY STARTS
Captain Lloyd's yarn starts in '68
when lie was left an orphan at the
aye of five—his mother and father
massacred during an Indian raid.
Picked up by cattle crews driving
north to Abilene, and farther North,
and yet still farther North, at 12
he was on his own, and had already
been adopted by a young lady,
popularly known as "Calamity Jane."
At 18, he joined the Texas Rang
ers and, during the period follow
ing, as a peace officer he claims to
have met and beaten to the draw
better than 67 of the West's bad men
in his travels throughout Montana,
Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mex
ico, Placer County of California, and
Idaho.
SEARCH FOR GOLD
He combined his talents with a
six-shooter with a chase for the
yellow metal "he's still searching for
—gold.
"Haven't never given up the chase
to find the fabulous pot o' gold at

the end of the rainbow," he drawls,
"and I'm still lookin' fur it.
"Lots of times when I went into
the gold camps an' they found out I
was a fast two-gun man, they'd make
me marshal to clean tilings up.
"If the town bully wouldn't talk
sense, we'd go fur our guns—well,
I'm still here."
67 DIE
Briefly, that's the story behind the
67 Boot Hill victims, fK) per cent of
thorn killed in Capt. Lloyd's capacity
as a peace officer.
Out-Greying Zane Grey, the Cap
tain diverges now and then to recol
lections of other early Western
characters, and recalls tales of Judge
Roy Elam Bean, the "Law West of
the Pecos," and Judge Isaac Park
er's Hanging Court, where more
than 100 outlaws met their doom on
the scaffold that was built, in the
courtyard.
WESTERN JUSTICE
Approximately 90 per cent went
out feet first from the latter Hall of
Justice, he says, i
"Didn't have no habeas corpus in
them days. By golly, if a man 'as
found guilty, he out the back
door to the scaffold."
As things got tame in the Wild
West, where he had seen Wild Bill
Hickok die and whose six-shooter
he still carries, Capt. Lloyd fol
lowed the restless urge of the yel
low metal northward to Alaska. It
was here that he met Jack London
and where the latter wrote of his
life.

'HAM AND EGGS'
As to "Ham and Eggs," he re
sponds, "All I want's the right to get
out and live. I don't want no $30
a week.
"It's the same with all Western
ers; they don't want no charity.
That ain't the spirit of the Old West.
We all got to work together in this
country."
With which, one of the last of the
Old West's descendants trailed back
to the present, bunched his silver
hair under his sombrero, picked up
the ebony eane given him by Ma
hatma Ghandi, the 'man with the
diapers," and started for the Grey
hound hitching rack in Paly.
Headed south, "still Jookin' fur ex
citement," the old gunman is drift
ing happily toward the time that
someone drags his boots off . . .
toward the time he joins the last
round-up, where life is an endless
eternity . . .
Toward the time he spits in the
devil's eye and cracks, "Go fur yer
guns, you—l'm takin' over this man's
town."
"Burning Daylight" landed smack
in the middle of the Inner Quad,
last Thursday, a pair of high-heel
riding boots supporting his bow
legged frame, a shoulder-length
shock of white hair under his wide
brimmed Stetson.
"Look any man right square in
the eye, and tell him to go to hell
it necessary," he philosophized as
he spun the yarn of his life, more
than his life; in fact, the story of a
passing era.
But he didn't tell that story as a
Had one—he told it with a sparkle in
his eyes and a beam behind his
BufTalo Bill Cody goatee. In his
own words, "I'm still a kid. Yep, it's
the old fossils that's holding me
back and holding you back, and the
rest of us kids.
STILL A KID
"Ye're as old as ya let old man
brain tell ya and I'm still a kid in
my mind here — psychology's the
thing.'
This from a man of 70, known the
world over as Captain Jack Lloyd,
soldier-of-fortune, hero of Jack
London's novel, "Burning Daylight,"
and old-time cattle-driver and In
dian fighter.
\\ hen Capt. Lloyd appeared, he
didn't ride in on a painted horse—
no, he rode in on a modem stream
lined bus to collect a mental pic
lure of Stanford—one of the few
"great universities of the world I
ain't seen."
LIFE STORY STARTS
Captain Lloyd's yarn starts in '68
when lie was left an orphan at the
aye of five—his mother and father
massacred during an Indian raid.
Picked up by cattle crews driving
north to Abilene, and farther North,
and yet still farther North, at 12
he was on his own, and had already
been adopted by a young lady,
popularly known as "Calamity Jane."
At 18, he joined the Texas Rang
ers and, during the period follow
ing, as a peace officer he claims to
have met and beaten to the draw
better than 67 of the West's bad men
in his travels throughout Montana,
Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mex
ico, Placer County of California, and
Idaho.
SEARCH FOR GOLD
He combined his talents with a
six-shooter with a chase for the
yellow metal "he's still searching for
—gold.
"Haven't never given up the chase
to find the fabulous pot o' gold at

the end of the rainbow," he drawls,
"and I'm still lookin' fur it.
"Lots of times when I went into
the gold camps an' they found out I
was a fast two-gun man, they'd make
me marshal to clean tilings up.
"If the town bully wouldn't talk
sense, we'd go fur our guns—well,
I'm still here."
67 DIE
Briefly, that's the story behind the
67 Boot Hill victims, fK) per cent of
thorn killed in Capt. Lloyd's capacity
as a peace officer.
Out-Greying Zane Grey, the Cap
tain diverges now and then to recol
lections of other early Western
characters, and recalls tales of Judge
Roy Elam Bean, the "Law West of
the Pecos," and Judge Isaac Park
er's Hanging Court, where more
than 100 outlaws met their doom on
the scaffold that was built, in the
courtyard.
WESTERN JUSTICE
Approximately 90 per cent went
out feet first from the latter Hall of
Justice, he says, i
"Didn't have no habeas corpus in
them days. By golly, if a man 'as
found guilty, he out the back
door to the scaffold."
As things got tame in the Wild
West, where he had seen Wild Bill
Hickok die and whose six-shooter
he still carries, Capt. Lloyd fol
lowed the restless urge of the yel
low metal northward to Alaska. It
was here that he met Jack London
and where the latter wrote of his
life.
ALASKA TO AFRICA
As the Yukon and Dawson coun
try toned down, the urge to move
on arose again. This time, the Cap
tain went to South Africa after dia
monds and gold, but ended up in
the Boer War.
Soldier-of-fortune he became, and
has since fought in four major wars,
16 revolutions, and in too many skir
mishes to count. He fought the Boers,
he rode with Teddy Roosevelt as a
Rough Rider in the Spanish-Ameu
ican conflict; he was a member of
the Legion of Death in the Russo-
I Japanese war; and was with a Brit
| ish Intelligence Outfit during the
| World War.
j Besides all this, "I done my hitch
j in the French Foreign Legion. When
i a man does his time in that outfit,
j he kin face anything in the world."
WAR AND REVOLUTION
Among revolutionaries, Capt.
Lloyd rode for three and a half
years with Pancho Villa, was with
Wing Fu Chau in North China, and
has fought with General Lee Christ
, mas, Ted Malone, Tex O'Reilly,
I Sammy Dereden, the "Fighting Jew,"
Carl Butler, Jack White, and Gen
eral Jim Standlee.
I "I've fought with a lot of others,
I too, when we got paid $.">0 a day in
1 gold—and paid every morning or we
J refused to touch our machine guns."
; FIGHTING ENDS
The Captain's fighting life ended
in the World War, when he was
gassed and lost all his teeth, and
since then he's prowled the world,
! "always lookin' fur excitement, in
j stead of goin' to the poor farm.
"I don't believe in warfare, the
; way it is today," he comments, add
! ing that "before the next war, the
United States, Great Britain, and
Russia will fight the rest of the
world.
! "Why?
"Because those countries have !)2

per cent of the oil produced in the
world—and no military-mad power
is any good without that.
"But it's gonna be funny when the
other side's got to run its airplanes
with coal and wants to loop-the
loop."
