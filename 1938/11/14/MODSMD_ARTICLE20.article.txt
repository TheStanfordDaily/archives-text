Rovena Conn, chairman of the

ing, the committee will have reached
"I wish to thank all the Stanford
students for their splendid co-opera
tion in the Red Cross Drive.
"I feel that what with the funds
that we now have, plus those that
are yet to come in, we will have
completed a very successful and
worshipful campaign, and one in
which we are proud to have partici
pated. Likewise, 1 wish to express
my appreciation to all the workers
for their help," she said yesterday.
