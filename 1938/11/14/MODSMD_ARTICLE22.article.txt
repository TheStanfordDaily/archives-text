"ANTHONY AND ANNA." pro
duced las.t week-end at the Palo
Alio Community Theater:
Here is an example of a rather
baldly unimportant piny in a pro
dti :ion too good for it
In "Anthony and Anna," British
humowright St. John Ervine gives
the American sweat ethic a shellack
ing in favor of the English sense
of leisure. The issue is fairly
medieval and the wheezes which
are supposed to get it across posi
tively pre-Christian.
Bung neither immoral nor smart,
".Anthony and Anna" is intended to
pass as homespun humor—but home
spun humor is often another name for
owgeois inertia. However, that the
v-nole effect is about as vital as a

Lame Duck ses
sion and no less
passe is not sur
prising in view of
the fact that the
play was actually
written some time
ago. In any case,
it is certainly not
my aim to crack
down on a pres
entation that has

| rarely been matched and seldom
I topped in local amateur theatricals.
| Ruth Martin, as the buoyant
i American heroine, has a knack of
: bumping accidentally into a line,
a foxy use of gesture, and a fine il

[voice. Above all. she is thoroughly
I herself on the stage. It behooves
J the campus casting offices to get a

la practice of farming out her tal

I Joseph Donavan as a couple of
cockney waiters; and George Dewey,
