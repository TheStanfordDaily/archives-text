"Treasure Island will be so lighted
at night as to create the illusion of
a magical white city floating in the
middle of San Francisco Bay," re
veals A. F. Dickerson, illuminating
engineer for the Golden Gate Intel
national Exposition, who will speak
here tomorrow night.
Discussing '"Exposition Illumina
tion and What to Expect at Treasure
Island in 1939," the engineer, man
ager of the illumination laboratory
of the General Electric Company,
will present an illustrated lecture at
the Tuesday Evening Series in Me
morial Hall auditorium.
TEST LIGHTING
"Lighting for the fair will not be
complete until three or four weeks
before the exposition opens," asserts
Mr. Dickerson, explaining that
"we're out on the island nightly,
testing — getting the proper color
harmonies, avoiding clashing and
jarring effects—toning down hei*e,
and building up there."
A detailed lantern-slide review of
the illumination effects secured in
previous large expositions will be
presented by the lighting expert, in
cluding San Francisco's Panama-Pa
cific International Exposition of 1915,
now considered by many illumina
tion authorities "yardstick" for
fair lighting.
FLOODLIGHTS FALLS
Illumination of the exposition has
been designed so that "highlights
and shadows will break up the
monotony of the usual flatness of
floodlighted surfaces," explains Mr.
Dickerson, who conceived the idea
of floodlighting Niagara Falls and
was in complete charge of the proj
ect.
"There'll be no harsh garishness
or glaring on Treasure Island next
year," predicts the lighting engineer.
"Instead, a soft, jewel-like glow will
predominate, through the extensive
use of certain restful, harmonious
color combinations."
