Commenting on an alleged
attempt Friday night to set fire
to the Boathouse, Student Body
President H. B. Lee last night
issued a warning that any dam
age done to the structure will
increase cast of the new build

"According to our contract,"
he said, "all material taken
from the old building belongs
to the wrecking company. We
can use for the bonfire only
scrap wood that the company
doesn't want to salvage."
Lee said guards arc stationed
at the lake every night to pre
vent arson attempts.
