# Debaters to Face Santa Clarans
## 
### 
Francis Du√üois and Bob Putnam,
Stanford debaters, will accost Santa
Clara representatives on the Bronco
campus at 8 o'clock this evening.
Tonight's meet is in the nature of a
reciprocal one, the Santa Clara men
having debated at the Farm last
Tuesday.
Card representative< will present
the affirmative side of the Anglo-
American question on this occasion,
doing a right-about-face to their
forensic team-mates, Walter Stoessel
and Harry Horton, who expounded
the negative viewpoint at the first
Santa Clara meet.

In presenting their negative views
on ihe Anglo-American question,
"Resolved, that an Anglo-American
mutual assistance pact in case of ag
gression will be in the best interests
of world peace," the Stanford de
baters last week brought out the
facts that any such alliance is against
all precedents of the United States,
that there is no moral obligation, and
that the success of such pacts has
been repudiated many times.
There are 4.000.000 horses in Pol
and, enough to take all the inhab
itants riding simultaneously.
