## 
### 
LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 13 (UP).â€”
Rebounding from last week's Carne
gie Tech defeat, the Pittsburgh Pan
thers crushed Nebraska, 19 to 0, yes
terday before a capacity crowd of
34.000. Pitt played without Marshall
'Goldberg, injured Ail-American back
i and key man in the Pittsburgh of
fense, but did not need him. Dick
Cassiano and Harold Stebbins, hard
driving backs, carried the ball ex
pertly and nearly always picked up
I first downs when they were needed.
The Panthers collected 19 first
downs and 270 net yards to Ne
braska's four first downs and 88 net
yards. The name marked Nebraska's
fifth defeat of the season against one
! victory and one tie.
