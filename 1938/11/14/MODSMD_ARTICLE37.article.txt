# Beavers Drown Indian Squad 6-0
## O.S.C Slips Traditional Series Jinx Stanford Loses Tilt On Break in First Quarter at Corvallis 
### JERRY MAYER 
Thirteen may be a dreaded jinx
number in our fair land, but up
Corvallis way, where the Oregon
State Beaver hangs out, it stands a
symbol of mighty conquest.
For it was the thirteenth game of
the Stanford-Oregon State series,
last Saturday's contest, which saw
Coach Lon Stiner's brawny boys
finally snap a traditional jinx. It
was the first game Stanford has ever
lost to the northerners.
CARDS OUTGAIN BEAVERS
And if the Beavers aren't surprised
over their G-0 triumph they cer
tainly should be, because if ever a
team looked like a winning outfit
Stanford did last week-end. The
Cards rang up ten more first downs
than the Oregon Staters did, out
gained them 213 yards to 108 on the
ground, and 75 to nothing in the
air. Twice in the entire game the
winners had the bail in Card terri
tory, once they scored—and that was
the ball game.
And that touchdown by the Beav
ers was especially distressing to the
Indians because it came just at a
time when they thought Ihey were
going to be the scoring team—not
Oregon. Bill Paulman had just
punted out of bounds on the Beaver
six, and Fred Ledeboer returned Jim
Kissel burgh's return boot back to
the Oregon State 41. On fi>'st down
Ledeboer tried to cross up Oregon
with a quick pass to Hugh Gallar
neau, but the pass was just out of
the receiver's reach and Vic Kohler,
O.S.C. left half playing safety, came
in on the dead run to grab the ball
and romp 65 yards to a touchdown
without a single Stanfordite so much
as waving at him.
LEDEBOER FUMBLES PUNT
The Beavers' only other visit into
Redshirt territory was also the re
sult of a first-quarter fluke, coming
when Ledeboer fumbled a punt and
Schultz recovered for Oregon on the
Card 31. But instead of moving for
ward the Beavers, graciously aided
by the Indians, worked their way
backward and decided to hand the
ball to the Indians before they had a
safety tacked up against them. That
was the last time the Beavers ad
vanced into Indian land.
The rest of the story is all Stan
ford, because from that time on the
Cards riddled the Beaver line con
sistently, passed well, considering
the freezing weather and wet ball,
and did everything but score points.
The second half was a replica of
the first, with the Indians doing all
the ground gaining, and the Beavers
brawling to keep their goal line un
crossed. Fifty yards to O.S.C.'s 16,
the Cards' first drive went; and the
second carried 34 yards to the Beaver
32.
LAST-MINUTE BID
With but a single minute remain
ing Stanford made its final bid, on a
forward-lateral pass play from
Hamilton to Graft to Ledeboer, which
gained 42 yards to Oregon's 26.
However, a clipping penalty set the
Cards back to the 41, from where
Hamilton nailed Bill Kirsch on the
28.
A five-yard penalty for too many
times out set the Cards back, and on
the next and final play, Hamilton's
pass to GrafT was incomplete on the
goal line.
But Stanford in defeat Saturday
was a team that could have given
any team on the Coast a scare. The
line was charging viciously and
blocking effectively, opening tre
mendous holes in the Beaver line.
CARDS HAVE ABILITY
Make no mistake, the Indians off
the Palo Aito Farm are a very live
quality these November afternoons,
a quality which is quite likely to
turn California's newly-kindled Rose-
Bowl hopes into ashes come Satur
day. In spite of their unenviable
record of four straight losses, and
five defeats in seven games, the
Cards have ability, and all they have
to do to take advantage of that abil
ity is to block and charge like var
sity gridmen instead of intramural
touch football players.

LAST-MINUTE BID
With but a single minute remain
ing Stanford made its final bid, on a
forward-lateral pass play from
Hamilton to Graft to Ledeboer, which
gained 42 yards to Oregon's 26.
However, a clipping penalty set the
Cards back to the 41, from where
Hamilton nailed Bill Kirsch on the
28.
A five-yard penalty for too many
times out set the Cards back, and on
the next and final play, Hamilton's
pass to GrafT was incomplete on the
goal line.
But Stanford in defeat Saturday
was a team that could have given
any team on the Coast a scare. The
line was charging viciously and
blocking effectively, opening tre
mendous holes in the Beaver line.
CARDS HAVE ABILITY
Make no mistake, the Indians off
the Palo Aito Farm are a very live
quality these November afternoons,
a quality which is quite likely to
turn California's newly-kindled Rose-
Bowl hopes into ashes come Satur
day. In spite of their unenviable
record of four straight losses, and
five defeats in seven games, the
Cards have ability, and all they have
to do to take advantage of that abil
ity is to block and charge like var
sity gridmen instead of intramural
touch football players.
Thirteen may be a dreaded jinx
number in our fair land, but up
Corvallis way, where the Oregon
State Beaver hangs out, it stands a
symbol of mighty conquest.
For it was the thirteenth game of
the Stanford-Oregon State series,
last Saturday's contest, which saw
Coach Lon Stiner's brawny boys
finally snap a traditional jinx. It
was the first game Stanford has ever
lost to the northerners.
CARDS OUTGAIN BEAVERS
And if the Beavers aren't surprised
over their G-0 triumph they cer
tainly should be, because if ever a
team looked like a winning outfit
Stanford did last week-end. The
Cards rang up ten more first downs
than the Oregon Staters did, out
gained them 213 yards to 108 on the
ground, and 75 to nothing in the
air. Twice in the entire game the
winners had the bail in Card terri
tory, once they scored—and that was
the ball game.
And that touchdown by the Beav
ers was especially distressing to the
Indians because it came just at a
time when they thought Ihey were
going to be the scoring team—not
Oregon. Bill Paulman had just
punted out of bounds on the Beaver
six, and Fred Ledeboer returned Jim
Kissel burgh's return boot back to
the Oregon State 41. On fi>'st down
Ledeboer tried to cross up Oregon
with a quick pass to Hugh Gallar
neau, but the pass was just out of
the receiver's reach and Vic Kohler,
O.S.C. left half playing safety, came
in on the dead run to grab the ball
and romp 65 yards to a touchdown
without a single Stanfordite so much
as waving at him.
LEDEBOER FUMBLES PUNT
The Beavers' only other visit into
Redshirt territory was also the re
sult of a first-quarter fluke, coming
when Ledeboer fumbled a punt and
Schultz recovered for Oregon on the
Card 31. But instead of moving for
ward the Beavers, graciously aided
by the Indians, worked their way
backward and decided to hand the
ball to the Indians before they had a
safety tacked up against them. That
was the last time the Beavers ad
vanced into Indian land.
The rest of the story is all Stan
ford, because from that time on the
Cards riddled the Beaver line con
sistently, passed well, considering
the freezing weather and wet ball,
and did everything but score points.
The second half was a replica of
the first, with the Indians doing all
the ground gaining, and the Beavers
brawling to keep their goal line un
crossed. Fifty yards to O.S.C.'s 16,
the Cards' first drive went; and the
second carried 34 yards to the Beaver
32.
