WNSTEAD of long faces that usu
ally follow defeat, thirty gridders
got off the train yesterday afternoon
with only the regret that they have
to wait a week to show Stanford
rooters and the University of Cali
fornia that they can really play ball.
The score, as usual in Stanford
games, did not tell the tale in any
sense. Oregon State was walloped
offensively, defensively, and every
other way—the Indians did anything
they wanted with a "big and soft"
eight-man line except make a touch
down through it.
* * CI
T> ACKS for the Big Red Ma
chine were superb. Bill Paul
man hit like a freight train, and
made yardage every time. Norm
Standlee blocked in all-American
style, setting the ends so far from
the ball carriers that they wore
themselves out trying to get hack
in time for the next play.
Hugh Gallarneau was a shining
light on pass defense and a speed
burner when he got the hall in his
hands.

TACK CLARK played the game
he's supposed to play. He is one
of the finest ends on the gridiron
today, but bad breaks have hit him
on all sides. But he's in fine shape
now, and veterans on the Cal team
will recognize not only a familiar
face but a familiar game on Stan
ford's left flank.
Tony Calvelli played his usual
ail-American game, and with the
able assistance of Corky Donahue
and Hamp Pool, opened up the
Beaver line so that only the second
ary defense was available to stop
the Cards.
