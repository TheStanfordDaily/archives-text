the rest of the period the invaders
carried the offensive, but could not
find the punch to drive another goal
through.

ritory again during the early part
of the fourth period, the Bears
marked their second score when a
slashing kick from deep midfield
sailed cleanly through for the final
score.

SECOND HALF PUSH
Early after half time, the Gold and
Blue staged a not-to-be-stopped
drive for a score that culminated in
an onslaught from close in that gave
them their first tally. Throughout
the rest of the period the invaders
carried the offensive, but could not
find the punch to drive another goal
through.
Keeping the ball in Stanford ter
ritory again during the early part
of the fourth period, the Bears
marked their second score when a
slashing kick from deep midfield
sailed cleanly through for the final
score.
On the Papoose field, with the
Cal squad featuring an attack cen
tered on two fast wingmen, the
Cubs scored once in the second
quarter, again in the third, and
added two more in the final period,
j while bottling up the Stanford for
| ward line.
Captain Nick Bills and Tony Gun
termann were constant scoring
threats, while goalie Jack Burns and
backs Jim Mulchay and Jack Hurt
were strong factors in defense.
A double victory was chalked up
for Cal against Stanford Saturday
I morning, as the Indian varsity soc-
I cer squad bowed to the Cal eleven
jto the tune of 2-0, while on the
frosh field the Bear cubs throttled
the Papooses by a 4-0 score,
t Played to a standstill during the
| first two quarters, the Cal varsity
eleven poured on the power in the
second half to score once in the third
quarter and once in the final pe
| riod.
lIALFS SPARK BACKFIELD
Again it was the Stanford defense
that functioned mightily during the
entire game, as newly elected Cap
tain Kenny Cuthbertson and sopho
more Wilson Clark a£ halfbacks
[ sparked the backfield. Brilliant
! saves by goalies Sanz-Agero and
Rudy Munzer were features of the
Card defense.
The missing scoring push in the
forward wall once again was lack
ing as the Indian offense tied up time
; and again when in scoring position.
During the first quarter the Cal
forward wall functioned to perfee
i tion, playing on even terms with
j what Stanford Coach Harry Maloney
j terms "the best Indian backfield in
i years." In the second quarter the
Card aggregation played its best of
i fensive ball of the morning, carry
ing the spheroid into scoring posi
i tion only to be thwarted by brilliant
; Cal saves.
