# Fuel for '42

AS brush and scrap-wood pile higher and
higher on Lagunita's bed, Big Game Week
end excitement will start storing up to jimmy
campus classroom concentration and to burst
out in flames Thursday night to start a four-day
Roman holiday.
For one week, Stanford will go Joe College
all the yay, rah-rah trimmings and all, and will
revel in it. Gaieties stars will turn up with
dark circles under their eyes after whipping
the show into shape for Friday afternoon and
night. Rally Committee will flip cards back
and forth to evolve more and more complicated
stunts for the rooters' stands to sabotage on
Saturday. Cheer leaders will tentatively clear
their throats, wave their arms before mirrors,
and spend their, evenings memorizing the Axe
Yell.
And the team? Lights on every night in the
secret practice field.
Conscious that, unlike Rome, the Big Game
bonfire will be built in a day, frosh will work
like pack-rats collecting debris to start the pyre
on its way to the sky Thursday. Old alumni, old
seniors have shaken their heads at hearing of
the time limit for building. To their jaundiced
eyes, peering back at the good old days when
the fire was built long enough beforehand to
give Cal a chance to burn it, the fire this year
won't be big enough to toast marshmallows.
They'll be right, too, if the frosh don't take
the time limit as a challenge to their own spirit,
spirit which, as with every class, has been ques
tioned. In past years, the frosh, secure in the
knowledge that "there is plenty of time," have
allowed a few of their more active members and
Rally Committee to build the fire for them. This
year, it will take all their combined effort to
make the fire a gory monument to Saturday's
funeral—for the Bear, of course of course.
The fire can be built in a day if preliminary
arrangements are not tossed overboard by a
class of freshmen who have looked beyond
their years to the casual Stanford attitude to
ward anything remotely suggestive of old-time
football spirit.
So the Bonfire Thursday night will be the
freshmen's real Stanford test. High scores on
paint-brush work, clownish adolescence in re
gard to Encina fire alarm boxes, or the depth
of voice when yelling "Nuts to Cal" don't
count.
If that Bonfire is only a wan candle of hope
for the Big Game, the cry can be changed,
taken up by the whole school:
"Nuts to '42."

higher on Lagunita's bed, Big Game Week
end excitement will start storing up to jimmy
campus classroom concentration and to burst
out in flames Thursday night to start a four-day
Roman holiday.
For one week, Stanford will go Joe College
all the yay, rah-rah trimmings and all, and will
revel in it. Gaieties stars will turn up with
dark circles under their eyes after whipping
the show into shape for Friday afternoon and
night. Rally Committee will flip cards back
and forth to evolve more and more complicated
stunts for the rooters' stands to sabotage on
Saturday. Cheer leaders will tentatively clear
their throats, wave their arms before mirrors,
and spend their, evenings memorizing the Axe
Yell.
And the team? Lights on every night in the
secret practice field.
Conscious that, unlike Rome, the Big Game
bonfire will be built in a day, frosh will work
like pack-rats collecting debris to start the pyre
on its way to the sky Thursday. Old alumni, old
seniors have shaken their heads at hearing of
the time limit for building. To their jaundiced
eyes, peering back at the good old days when
the fire was built long enough beforehand to
give Cal a chance to burn it, the fire this year
won't be big enough to toast marshmallows.
They'll be right, too, if the frosh don't take
the time limit as a challenge to their own spirit,
spirit which, as with every class, has been ques
tioned. In past years, the frosh, secure in the
knowledge that "there is plenty of time," have
allowed a few of their more active members and
Rally Committee to build the fire for them. This
year, it will take all their combined effort to
make the fire a gory monument to Saturday's
funeral—for the Bear, of course of course.
The fire can be built in a day if preliminary
arrangements are not tossed overboard by a
class of freshmen who have looked beyond
their years to the casual Stanford attitude to
ward anything remotely suggestive of old-time
football spirit.
So the Bonfire Thursday night will be the
freshmen's real Stanford test. High scores on
paint-brush work, clownish adolescence in re
gard to Encina fire alarm boxes, or the depth
of voice when yelling "Nuts to Cal" don't
count.
If that Bonfire is only a wan candle of hope
for the Big Game, the cry can be changed,
taken up by the whole school:
"Nuts to '42."
