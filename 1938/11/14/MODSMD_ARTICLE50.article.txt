# Road Closed — Detour
## 
### 
THE key man in Stanford's road setup has
finished his vacation and returned to the
Farm. Assistant Comptroller Trowbridge is
back on the job, and things are humming.
It is true, of course, that the humming so far
boils itself down to a revived parking-lot be
tween the Libe and the Education Building; but
coming as it does after a long period of do
nothingism, this in itself is worthy of praise.
And if it could be taken as a sign that further
work was planned, it would be worthy of even
greater praise.
Unfortunately, however, that is not the case.
Mr. Trowbridge himself states that nothing's
going to be done to relieve congestion on the
How, and nothing's going to be done about
opening the road in front of the Libe. "No
body's got the money" to do the first; and "no
decision has been reached" on the second. The
status quo, traditional, inefficient, and annoy
ing, will be maintained.
Aside from the fact that keeping Lasuen
closed in front of the Libe furnishes the campus
with a continuous and fully justified gripe—if
no decision has been reached, why keep it
closed until one is?—the hands-off policy in
regard to the Row is a downright bad invest
ment for the University.
It may cost money to widen the alley behind
the houses and restrict parking to it, but acci
dents cost money, too; and in the long run
money spent on roads brings more credit than
money spent for damages and hospitalization.
Stanford hasn't had a death on the Row—yet;
but that's due more to driving skill than driving
facilities.
The Administration deserves much credit for
its new parking-lot beside the Libe. An obvious
answer to an obvious need, it is a step in the
right direction.
But unless it is followed up with a long-term
program of constructive action, it will be only
a step, and nothing more.—A.S.D.
Put It on the Cuff
T NCIDENTAL to Big Game Weekend, The
-L Daily received a call last week from a group
of puzzled Row men. It went something like
this:
"This the editor?"

"Yea."
"Say, listen, what do you know about this
tradition of the women paying halt the toll Big
Game night?"
"Nothing. Sounds like a good idea."
"Well, we gotta get dates and we want to
know exactly where we stand on the deal. How
about putting it in the paper that Big Game
night is dutch, traditionally?"
"Okay."
So after checking up with a pair of Roble
sponsors who confirmed the boys' idea that
instructions were out to make Big Game week
end a fifty-fifty deal, The Daily herewith plays
Emily Post.
Traditionally, Big Game night is a half-way
proposition financially, particularly in regard
to a certain down-the-coast luxury hotel.
But then you know how Stanford is about
traditions.
