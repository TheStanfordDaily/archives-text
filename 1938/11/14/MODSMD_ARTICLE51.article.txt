### JOHN COBBS 
GOT THE JITTERS
W/'HEN Ex Committee grappled gingerly with the
problem of night parking last week, Stanford's
ranking phantom, fear of publicity, stood in the corner
and leered through the tobacco smoke. It was there
throughout the brief discussion worded carefully as a
diplomatic note, and it remained after Excom had de
cided to leave the matter to the discretion of the cam
pus cops, thus catapulting the problem into that corner
of limbo reserved for tabled questions.
The issue is closed now, and Ex Committee can
speak without, shying at double meanings and wincing
at badly worded phrases. But the old publicity phan
tom still maintains legal residence on the campus.
i'fi * % *
Undoubtedly the night parking question was silly.
Under ordinary circumstances it would rate only a
casually caustic reference. But. Ex Committee, and the
students, and the administration attracted attention
to it by jumping like a rabbit with an inferiority
complex as soon as it was mentioned. And so we got
the very publicity we were trying to avoid.
For some years Stanford has been haunted by the
fear of unfavorable publicity. No persecuted politician
or "misunderstood" movie star has ever fled report
ers wtih such panicky haste.. And the princess in the
ivory tower was a prominent Broadway butterfly
in comparison with Stanford's ideal of modesty and
retirement.
<s * * *
FX COMMITTEE'S jittery handling of the parking
question is an example of the ingrained fear of
publicity. The general embarrassed and wary reaction
of the campus and administration strengthens the il
lustration. But the delicate problem of parked couples
is not the only citation.
The Public Exercises Committee keeps a care
fully maternal watch over all talks and meetings held
on the campus. Controversial subjects cannot be
discussed at open meetings unless the speaker is ap
proved by the committee. It doesn't take a great deal
of penetrating investigation to find the old fear of
publicity hiding behind the regulation.
When the Dies Committee honored three of our
professors by calling them "Reds," Stanford shuddered
at the publicity, forgetting that today mention by the
Dies Committee is almost as much an essential of re
spectability as a birth certificate. The prevalent atti
tude was that our professors had committeed a grave
crime in getting themselves mentioned, but that it
would be quite all right if they could manage to bomb
the Chapel or poison a few capitalists anonymously.
* * * *
Stanford, of course, has a good excuse for being
jittery about publicity. It has to convince the parents
of students that their beloved offspring are having
their characters shaped according to the best principles
of religion and patriotism. It depends on elderly mil
lionaires to feed the endowment fund kitty; and elderly
millionaires are usually textbook examples of the type
of respectability that closes like a trap at the first
hint of "scandal."
But Stanford carries its caution too far. Parents
are fairly tolerant these days, and the fact that they
send their children to school at all shows that they
have at least a minimum of trust in them. Even mil
lionaires were once young, and if we can believe the
biographies, most of them would need influential spon
sors if they tried for sainthood.
Perhaps if we would worry less about unfavorable
publicity we would get less of it. And it would be
much easier on our nervous systems.

The issue is closed now, and Ex Committee can
speak without, shying at double meanings and wincing

Undoubtedly the night parking question was silly.
Under ordinary circumstances it would rate only a
casually caustic reference. But. Ex Committee, and the
students, and the administration attracted attention
to it by jumping like a rabbit with an inferiority
complex as soon as it was mentioned. And so we got
the very publicity we were trying to avoid.
For some years Stanford has been haunted by the
fear of unfavorable publicity. No persecuted politician
or "misunderstood" movie star has ever fled report
ers wtih such panicky haste.. And the princess in the
ivory tower was a prominent Broadway butterfly
in comparison with Stanford's ideal of modesty and
retirement.

FX COMMITTEE'S jittery handling of the parking
question is an example of the ingrained fear of
publicity. The general embarrassed and wary reaction
of the campus and administration strengthens the il
lustration. But the delicate problem of parked couples
is not the only citation.
The Public Exercises Committee keeps a care
fully maternal watch over all talks and meetings held
on the campus. Controversial subjects cannot be
discussed at open meetings unless the speaker is ap
proved by the committee. It doesn't take a great deal
of penetrating investigation to find the old fear of
publicity hiding behind the regulation.
When the Dies Committee honored three of our
professors by calling them "Reds," Stanford shuddered
at the publicity, forgetting that today mention by the
Dies Committee is almost as much an essential of re
spectability as a birth certificate. The prevalent atti
tude was that our professors had committeed a grave
crime in getting themselves mentioned, but that it
would be quite all right if they could manage to bomb
the Chapel or poison a few capitalists anonymously.

Stanford, of course, has a good excuse for being
jittery about publicity. It has to convince the parents
of students that their beloved offspring are having
their characters shaped according to the best principles
of religion and patriotism. It depends on elderly mil
lionaires to feed the endowment fund kitty; and elderly
millionaires are usually textbook examples of the type
of respectability that closes like a trap at the first
hint of "scandal."
But Stanford carries its caution too far. Parents
are fairly tolerant these days, and the fact that they
send their children to school at all shows that they
have at least a minimum of trust in them. Even mil
lionaires were once young, and if we can believe the
biographies, most of them would need influential spon
sors if they tried for sainthood.
Perhaps if we would worry less about unfavorable
publicity we would get less of it. And it would be
much easier on our nervous systems.
GOT THE JITTERS
W/'HEN Ex Committee grappled gingerly with the
problem of night parking last week, Stanford's
ranking phantom, fear of publicity, stood in the corner
and leered through the tobacco smoke. It was there
throughout the brief discussion worded carefully as a
diplomatic note, and it remained after Excom had de
cided to leave the matter to the discretion of the cam
pus cops, thus catapulting the problem into that corner
of limbo reserved for tabled questions.
