r JpiiEY tell me there's a cook over in the Union Cel
lar who is approaching the alleged legal pension
age, and he was rabidly for the Thirty-Thursday plan.
The morning after it was defeated, various wags
and hasher friends of his came in and all ordered ham
and eggs for fc>reakfnst.
The cook blew up. The only statement, both intel
ligible and printable, that he said was, "I'll kill the
next, guy who orders ham and eggs."
To him ham and eggs is no longer a breakfast dish.
It's an economic concept.

One of the female ushers at the concert last
week had a tough time. Some people came up to
her screaming, "Some people are in our seats!
some people arc in our scats!''
The usher went down to those people and, in
good usher fashion, asked them for their stubs,
explaining that she thought they were in the wrong
seats.
And found out that the alleged scat-stealers
were Ychudi Mcnuhin's parents, wife, and pro
moter.

other day the guy who has that coke machine
ovci in Toyon found a letter and twenty-five
cents on his desk. The letter said:
"I'm giving you GO per cent of the money I've been
gypping your machine out of."
And another guy was complaining to him (he other
«ay- "I wanted a coke so bad I put a dime in—and I
didn't get anything."
You can see the poor guy. going up to the machine
with burning eyes and trembling hands, pulling a
dime out of his pocket and desperately shoving it in
the slot. And not getting anything.
How sad.
But another guy put in a nickel and got out two
cokes and 9 cents.
