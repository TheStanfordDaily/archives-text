# Nazi Chief Calls Killing Jewish Plot
## Goebbels Asserts Paris Shooting Plan To Stir Up Trouble 
### 
BERLIN, Nov. 13 (UP). — Propa- i
ganda Minister Paul Joseph Goeb- \
bels today asserted that the Paris I
assassination of a minor German '
diplomat — an act that unleashed
Naziism's worst anti-Semitic terror j
—was a Jewish plot to stir up trouble l
between Germany and the Western i
powers.
Goebbels warned that more re
strictive measures are to follow >
those of Saturday which levied a i
collective "fine" of $400,600,000 on ;
Germany's 700,000 Jews, virtually ;
eliminated them from economic and]
cultural life and confronted many I
with an actual threat of starvation, j
The propaganda minister, who
with Field Marshal Hermann Wil- i
helm Goering signed Saturday's se
ries of sweeping decrees, spoke at a
winter relief demonstration in
Berlin.
GUILTY OF SHOOTING
German Jews, he asserted, were
guilty of the shooting in Palis of
Ernst Von Rath, third secretary of
the Germany embassy, because all
Jewry throughout the world has
worked agajnst the Reich.
"Now they must suffer the conse
quences of their manifold crimes,"
Goebbels asserted.
'"The purpose of the shooting of
the German diplomat was to bring
about straining of relations be
tween Gel-many and the Western
powers, and thus again disturb the
international atmosphere which has
been clearing.
"They (the Jews) have been
spared all too long because of Ger
man generosity and good nature. Let
there now be an end to it.
"The Jewish problem will be
solved very shortly in accordance
with the will of the German people."
PEOPLE SUPPORT
Goebbels asserted that the drastic
decrees, such as Thursday's reign of
terrorism that extended to every
part of the nation with inestimable
destruction, was in accord with the
demands of the people. The Nazi
theory, he said, demands that gov
ernment action always must be dic
tated by the people themselves.
"The people want this and we are
only carrying out the people's will,"
he shouted.
Repeating his assertion that the
violence was "spontaneous" and un
organized, Goebbels said:
"The German people were filled
with unprecedented indignation and,
anyhow, they did not act against
persons but only against objects."
Goebbels warned the German
people to refrain from any further
violence against Jews or Jewish
property.
