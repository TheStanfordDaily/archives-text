# Card Band Says No Majorette, No More Music
## Women's Conference Dings Leader; Strike Threatened for Maxine 
### 
No majoretteâ€” no hand at the Biff Game.
That was the strike ultimatum of 100 members of the Stanford Hand in
response to a unanimous recommendation made yesterday by Women's
Conference that the organization "perforin in the future without the
majorette."
Rallying in support of Maxine Turner, 17-year-old San Leandro uirl
who has uerformed at half-times of home football names. the band members

subjected Caro
lyn Hibbard,
president of the
conference, to a
half-hour debate
when she an
nounced the re
quest at band
practice late
yesterday.
At the end of
th e discussion,
the 100 men drew
up and sent a
unanimous pro
test to The Daily
declaring that
Conference ob
jections are "un
substantiated."
"The band will
strike. If there
is no majorette,
there will be no
band, is our
unanimous opin
ion," Ed York,
m a n a g e r, said
last night.
"We will take
orders from no
one but Al Mas
ters, since the
band is a B.A.C.
unit; it has
nothing to do
with st it dent
body control."
Miss Hibbard,
speak i n g for
Conference, last

night made ihe following
"A matter recently discussed by
Women's Council was brought up in
Women's Conference today; namely,
the advisability of the drum major
ette performing at football games.
"The members of Conference, rep
resenting all of the women's living
groups on campus, unanimously
voted to to the Band
that, this group perform in the fu
ture without the majorette.
STUDENT GROUP
"The Band is a student organiza
tion, representing the University, as
a whole, and the Conference dele
gates feel that the majorette should
not be a part of this organization.
The matter would have aroused ear
lier consideration had it been freely
understood that Maxine was to be a
permanent adjunct to the Band, and
not just a temporary attraction.
"This afternoon, the women in
Conference expressed their opinions
on the subject. The Band has,
among other things, expressed itself
as desirous of listening to student
opinion. It is the hope of Confer
ence that favorable action will re
sult from these discussions."
BAND PETITION
The unanimous band statement is
as follows:
"It seems there are some self
styled 'representatives' of Stanford
women who are trying to stir up
trouble where none exists. We re
fer specifically to unsubstantiated
objection made by Women's Council
and Women's Conference to the
band's new majorette.
"Maxine Turner has presented
such a fine performance as a band



MAXINE TURNER and
CAROLYN HIBBARI)
leader that she has been publicized
in several metropolitan newspapers
as a feature of Stanford's football
season. Stanford students have
often shown their appreciation of
Maxine's excellent work by their ap
plause from the rooting section. Had
there been any objection to her fine
leading of the band a cry of protest
would have been sounded long ago.
"Yet these so-called 'representa
tive' Stanford women have insulted
both Maxine and Stanford women by
claiming our majorette to be unrep
resentative and a disgrace to Stain
ford. If we must indulge in person
alities, why not bring to light the
persons and motives behind these
false accusations. Better, we say, to
have favorable publicity for Stan
ford than prudish or catty 19th
century mud-slinging."
