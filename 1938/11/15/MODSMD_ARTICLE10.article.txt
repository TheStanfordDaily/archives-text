## 
### 
| Promise of the Shell Petroleum
I Company, that the new and modern
I filling station will be completed by
i November 26, cannot be kept ac
j cording to the statement made by
i building superintendent L. Geary
| yesterday afternoon. Said Mr. Geary,
"I do not think that we will put the
j finishing touches on the station for
|at least another three weeks. The
j large amount of plaster and cement
I work will hold up building produc
! tion."
Mr. Geary then continued by stat
j ing that the necessary time delay
1 will make for a much better station.
