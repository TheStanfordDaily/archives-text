## 
### 
"Propaganda is inevitable in society today and is a natural accompani- j
inent of conflict," Dr. Raymond I). Lawrence, acting associate professor
of journalism, assured listeners of the Stanford radio broadcast last night
when he spoke on the prevalence and importance of "Current Propagandas."
Many persons are of the belief that all propagnda is based on false-

hoods, but much of it is, in reality, 4
based on truth, Dr. Lawrence declar- 1
ed. "Nowhere, not even in one's own |
home, is he safe from insistent prop- f
Uganda. We are, at the moment, ob
jects of a foreign bombardment, one i
which is less destructive to your
home than a military attack but is ,
perhaps more disturbing to your
equanimity, though it comes on the
short wave.
"Propaganda is not a word re
served for the other fellow's 'isms'
but is an attempt to influence our
attitudes, and consequently, our ac- I
tions on the subjects about which !
there is a difference of opinion."
Propaganda far outdates recorded ,
history and many of the most :
prominent personalities of the past
were propagandists, the speaker de- I
clared.
Dr. Lawrence examined the cur
rent campaign of the National Manu- j
facturers Association, which is re- 1
portedly spending $500,000 a year in i
an attempt to counteract anti-busi- !
ness propagandists' contentions that i
business ethics are shady, its serv- I
ices to society of doubtful value, and j
its objectives selfish. He pointed out !
that "the menace comes not in propa- j
ganda from the manufacturers or
from their opponents but in sup- ;
pressing the right of the other side
aiso to propagandize.
In answering, "How can the aver
age American today hope to choose
intelligently from among the count
less conflicting claims of current
propagandas?"
