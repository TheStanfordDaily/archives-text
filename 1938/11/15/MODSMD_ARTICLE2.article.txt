# S.P.U. to Hold Caucus Today
## 
### 
The Labor party of the Stanford
Political Union will hold an import
ant caucus tonight at 7 o'clock in
Room 200H in the English Corner.
All members are urged to be there
because speakers and the party
stand for the meeting the next day.
The conservative party is expected
to oppose the resolution. A strategic
plan has been worked out to defeat
it, according to Tim Hays, party
leader.
Although the labor party has not
yet decided what stand it will take
it is expected that it will be wholly
in favor of the plan as it is stated in
the resolution.
The liberal party is expected to
[ either ride the fence or be split with
part being in favor of the resolu
tion and siding with the conserva
tives and part joining forces with the
laborites and upholding the question.
As the Union is patterned after
the United States Senate, the gal
> leries are open to the public which
! cordially invited to attend the meet
ing, stated Vincent Lemmon, presi
dent of the Union.
In answer to many questions, Mr.
Lemmon said. "The Union would still
j consider worthy applicants for the
Union although the rolls are now
full. Applications may be filled oul
at the A.S.S.U. office."
