# U.S. Envoy to Reich Temporarily Recalled
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14 (UP).—|
The State Department tonight an- j
nounced the summoning home from |
Berlin of Ambassador Hugh R. Wil- j
son "for an indefinite period of con- j
sulfations" on Germany's anti-Se- j
initic campaign and for a complete j
re-examination of German-Ameri
can relations.
At the same time it was reported
without confirmation that President
Roosevelt would issue a statement
tomorrow dealing with Germany's
treatment of Jews, and urging that I
the Reich government desist from j
measures which have roused protests ;
throughout the world.
Officials denied Wilson's recall j
was the first step in a diplomatic
breach. It was learned on high au
thority, however, that Wilson's stay
here would be prolonged and that it
is improbable he will return unless
the Hitler government recognizes the
Semitic question as a problem that
requires humanitarian consideration.

Wilson will leave for London Sun
day to catch a ship for New York.
Twice before —in 1870 and 1872—
the United States exhibited its dis
pleasure over maltreatment of Jews
by using such tactics.
Prentiss B. Gilbert, Counsellor of
Embassy, will be in charge in Wil
son's absence.
SUCCESSOR TO DODD
Wilson went to Berlin a year ago
last spring to succeed former Am
bassador William S. Dodd, who was
persona non grata because of his
anti-Nazi utterances. He was cho
sen for his diplomatic sagacity as
well as his keen knowledge of in
ternal German affairs.
