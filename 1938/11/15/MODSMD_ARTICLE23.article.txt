# Cards Repeat Debate Today
## S.F. State Gets Return Engagement 
### 
Staffing a return engagement, rep
resentatives from San Francisco
tSate and Stanford will take the plat
form this afternoon at 2 o'clock in
Room 100 to debate the Anglo-
American question. This topic was
also the subject of a debate held last
Monday in San Francisco between
the two colleges.
At last week's meet, the Stanford
debaters, Bob Moulton and Jack
Grover, took the affirmative of the
question, but Nelson Norman and
Armen Hamper, today's participants,
will present the negative. The com
plete question is: "Resolved, that an
Anglo-American mutual assistance
pat in case of aggression will be in
the best interests of world peace."
With last night's Santa Clara de
bate, today's meet with San Fran
cisco, and the semi-finals and finals
of the intersquad ti'youts, Stanford
debaters are having an unusually ac
tive week. In the semi-finals, to be
held today and tomorrow, the de
bates will be run off in the follow
ing order: team 17 vs. team 1, today
at 2 o'lock; team 7 vs. team 13, to
day at 4o'clock; team 12 vs. one of
today's winning teams, tomorrow at
4 o'clock.
Schedule for the final debate, to
be held Thursday, will be posted on
the bulletin board outside of Room
200T Wednesday evening. Final par
ticipants will be two of the teams
victorious in the current semi-final
matches. The entire debate squad is
invited to attend.
Some of the "universal" languages
proposed from time to time include
Volapuk, Esperanto, Mondolingue,
'Universala, and Kosmos.
