# Grid Squad in Shape For Clash; Fay Back
## 
### ARCH JENKINS 
"One hundred per cent physical
condition for the Big Game!"
That was the encouraging bit of
news which was confirmed yesterday
afternoon by team physicians after
looking over the squad in dummy
scrimmage.
If the Indians sneak through the
week and end up in California's
Memorial Stadium Saturday without
a crippled player on the bench, it
will be the first time all year that
the Big Red Machine has been at
full strength. And if the Indians are
in top shape, the high odds being
placed on the Bears might turn out
to be a sad, sad mistake.
LEDEBOER RESTS
Freddie Lcdeboer, who played an
other full game against Oregon State,,
was the only first string man ovit of
action last night. Dr. Fritz Roth,
team medic, instructed Ledeboer to
give a bruised thigh a two-day rest.
So Ledeboer's enforced vacation
should end this afternoon # provided
nothing unforeseen happens.

Tony Calvelli. Indian center and
sixty-minute man against Oregon
State, was awarded the Keehle pen
award yesterday for outstanding
play against the Beavers.

Incidentally eye witnesses of the
northern struggle came back with
the tear-jerking tale of Ledeboer's
attempted touchdown run on next
to the last play of the game. Lede
boer had caught Hamilton's pass and
was down to the Oregon 21 with one
measly Beaver oa.it in front. But he
was just too tired to churn his legs

any farther and was caught from
behind.
If Ledeboer had turned and later
aled to the Indian lineman behind
him. Stanford couldn't have missed.
Instead of catching a lateral, the
lineman was called for clipping from
behind, and the last Card threat was
nullified. It was simply a case of a
quick second action that came out
in reverse.
FAY BACK
Tiny Thornhill sent little Pete Fay
up onto ihe first string last night at
left half and Pete was running hard
long after dark doing his darnedest
io get in prime condition. Although
he isn't being figured on for more
than a half at the outside, Fay is
coming along so well after being
cooped up a month that he might
surprise everyone.
With Fay in the lineup. Thornhill
will put Ledeboer, "the one-man
quartet," at right half with Norm
Standlee still at quarter and Bill
Paulman at fullback. Standlee and
Paulman really put on a blocking
show for the snow-bound customers,
according to their team-mates.
Stan Andersen was also out of the
lineup last night, but he took an
extra day's leave in the north coun
try to toss a few snowballs in his
home town. He should be back in
harness this afternoon.

in reverse.
FAY BACK
Tiny Thornhill sent little Pete Fay
up onto ihe first string last night at
left half and Pete was running hard
long after dark doing his darnedest
io get in prime condition. Although
he isn't being figured on for more
than a half at the outside, Fay is
coming along so well after being
cooped up a month that he might
surprise everyone.
With Fay in the lineup. Thornhill
will put Ledeboer, "the one-man
quartet," at right half with Norm
Standlee still at quarter and Bill
Paulman at fullback. Standlee and
Paulman really put on a blocking
show for the snow-bound customers,
according to their team-mates.
Stan Andersen was also out of the
lineup last night, but he took an
extra day's leave in the north coun
try to toss a few snowballs in his
home town. He should be back in
harness this afternoon.
"One hundred per cent physical
condition for the Big Game!"
That was the encouraging bit of
news which was confirmed yesterday
afternoon by team physicians after
looking over the squad in dummy
scrimmage.
If the Indians sneak through the
week and end up in California's
Memorial Stadium Saturday without
a crippled player on the bench, it
will be the first time all year that
the Big Red Machine has been at
full strength. And if the Indians are
in top shape, the high odds being
placed on the Bears might turn out
to be a sad, sad mistake.
LEDEBOER RESTS
Freddie Lcdeboer, who played an
other full game against Oregon State,,
was the only first string man ovit of
action last night. Dr. Fritz Roth,
team medic, instructed Ledeboer to
give a bruised thigh a two-day rest.
So Ledeboer's enforced vacation
should end this afternoon # provided
nothing unforeseen happens.

Tony Calvelli. Indian center and
sixty-minute man against Oregon
State, was awarded the Keehle pen
award yesterday for outstanding
play against the Beavers.

Incidentally eye witnesses of the
northern struggle came back with
the tear-jerking tale of Ledeboer's
attempted touchdown run on next
to the last play of the game. Lede
boer had caught Hamilton's pass and
was down to the Oregon 21 with one
measly Beaver oa.it in front. But he
was just too tired to churn his legs

any farther and was caught from
behind.
If Ledeboer had turned and later
aled to the Indian lineman behind
him. Stanford couldn't have missed.
Instead of catching a lateral, the
lineman was called for clipping from
behind, and the last Card threat was
nullified. It was simply a case of a
quick second action that came out
in reverse.
