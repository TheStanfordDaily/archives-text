### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
, THE game isn't over yet.
J For weeks the Big Red Ma-
I chine has suffered from an acute at
tack of bad officialitis, but we hesi
tate to object because it sounds like
sour grapes and everybody knows
I that, an official's job is no cinch.
[But when it comes to out-and-out
| numbskull timekeeping that has a
j serious effect on the final results of
la game, you can't just let your blood
' boil and say nothing.
| Glenn Hamilton's last pass against
| Oregon State hit the ground five sec
|Onds before the end of the game, but
j nobody stopped the clock. Just as
in several games this season, Stan
! ford was alternating good and bad
(passes, and it was turn for a good
| one when the gun went off. The
time-keeper admitted his butch, and
j intended for Ihe game to go on.
I But Lon Stiner hurried his boys to
j the showers, and the O.S.C. student
1 body cluttered the field so that the
referee could see nothing better to
| do than call it quits.
Five seconds is hardly worth a
| beef even though it might have
| meant a touchdown, but in that final
j drive the clock didn't even stop
I while a 15-yard penalty was being
j measured off against the Cards,
j It appears that Stanford Indians do
their scoring in the last minute, and
; timekeepers will have to learn to
split hairs.
>|Cis »!<
j weather was bad news to ev-
I eryone who went North, par
ticularly to Hank Kaiser and his
managers. Wet field meant just one
thing to them—mud cleats. So they
got out their pliers and proceeded
to remove cleats from 33 pairs of
shoes and replace them with the
longer variety. Four managers
changed 4G2 cleats.
j Mud cleats to a player are as bad
! news as the weather itself. Not only
Ido (hey add considerable weight to
he carried around on his foot, but
he has to do some high stepping to
keep from tripping over them.
* # #
r pHERE will be some sad Pap
pooses when football numer
als are dished out this year to less
than two strings of players. What
ever the rule or the custom,
something should be done to re
ward a deep crew of freshman
i grid reserves for making the
: edition of the Little Red Machine
; one of the best in Stanford his
i tory.

d I AJRD water polo players, swim- |
| ming their way to the confer- j
! ence crown, met their Waterloo in J
Trojan waters last week-end, and it ,
now appears that chances remain 1
only for a tie.
To split the honors with Califor
nia, Stanford Indians will have to !
! swamp the Bears in two games, the J
I first to be played at Berkeley on
' Wednesday. And a jinx has pre
sented a Stanford victory in that |
j pool for many years.

Chances are that lack of a sta

ford's famous gridders, for phys- j
ical ami psychological reasons, j

Next spring quarter Dink Tem- 1
pleton will lield one of the finest
track teams ever to gather a ( onc
university, a team that will, if it
i has a chance, swamp competitors

ning off some of the most import
| ant track meets in the country, I
the Big Meet included, on Stan
