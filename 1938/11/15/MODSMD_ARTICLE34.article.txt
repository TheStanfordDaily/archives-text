# Water Poloists To Meet Bears
## Cal Team Unbeaten In Season's Starts 
### 
With the important California
[game and their next-to-last chance
at the title but two days away, Stan
ford's water poloists settled down
! yesterday to a long practice in an
] effort to stop the undefeated Goldon
i Bear. Both the varsity and the
j freshmen will meet California Wed
nesday afternoon in Berkeley.
Although both varsities look even
[ ly matched according to comparative
j games and scores, the California
team will be the favorite, as for the
i first time this season they will have
1 the phenomenal Ken Wheeler ready
jto play an entire game. Sometimes
j called America's greatest forward in
I water polo, Wheeler, captain of the
| Golden Bear squad, has never been
j stopped from scoring and only in
| juries have prevented him from mak
ing water polo history. So far this
season. Wheeler has only played four
S minutes in conference play, due to a
| badly wrenched shoulder, yet has
j won single handed both Southern
I California games with his uncanny
j scoop shots.
Undaunted by this and the fact
J that Stanford has not won a water
| polo match in the Berkeley pool in
1 the last four years, Coach Thornton
i has high hopes of stopping Wheeler,
j subsequently stopping California,
i Shifting his guards, Coach Thornton
lis planning on putting the sopho-
I more sensation, Ted Moreno, to
j guard the remarkable Wheeler and
j with a secret defense, think they
i can throttle the Bears' attack and
I put their own Hungarian system in
to action.
The freshman game, starting at
3:15 and a preliminary to the var-/
sity, will be a ding-dong battle with
i both teams evenly matched. Both
! the Papooses and the Cubs are high
j scoring outfits, but the California
frosh is less lenient with opponents'
scores, yet have lost more games.
The Indian freshmen have lost but
one game this season and that to the
strong San Jose State frosh.
