# Victorian Squaw Squalls

TROT out the Blue Stockings.
Dig out the shush-shush sound effect ma
chine.
Snaffle the smelling-salts and lavender per
fume from Grandma's horsehide trunk.
Here comes Queen Victoria, saying "We are
not amused" as she looks at Stanford's drum
majorette, cavorting before the Cardinals' Band.
Women's Council and Women's Conference,
tightening the stays to their moral corsets, have
pulled their eyebrows down to make a fur col
lar around their ankles. Maxine Turner, the
Band's spark-plug this year, is definitely on
their shucks list.
After four weeks of ovations from rooters'
stands, she is now being blackballed as guilty
of conduct unbecoming a Stanford woman,
and as being unrepresentative of Stanford
women. Evidently, her athletic antics, her
whirling red and white skirts, and her sprightly
stride denote a sin against the Indian gods and
squaws, who probably see in those lively attri
butes either a wish-fulfillment dream or a physi
cal impossibility.
But enough comment on Conference's in
credible mid-Victorianism. It is more shocking
than if Stanford's drum majorette would turn
out to be Sally Rand.
Since Conference's fall guy and spokesman,
Carolyn Hibbard, took the matter up with the
Band, and the subject will come up to Ex Com
mittee tonight, a few of the more serious aspects
should be dealt with between belly laughs at
Conference's unbecoming and unrepresentative
conduct.
A few questions might be asked: Why did
the matter not come up four weeks ago, when
Miss Turner first appeared? Why does Con
ference feel itself an authority on Stanford stu
dent opinion, in direct opposition to the ova
tions that greeted the Band's appearances in
the last four games? Why does Conference call
liveliness, skill in her craft, and popularity "un
representative of Stanford women"?
And, above all, just what kind of action does
Conference expect to take? The Band is a Board
of Athletic Control unit, not an A.S.S.U. sub
sidy. A1 Masters, Graduate Manager, has ex
pressed himself that student opinion should
govern the Band. That will be his stand when
and if any action is taken in Ex Committee to
night.
But the Band says only one thing: no major
ette, no band at the Cal game. And they
mean it.
So it looks as if Ex Committee is on one hot
spot. They are faced with the problem that if
they too decide a drum majorette is a shocking
exhibition for stodgy Stanford to put on, they
can follow up their feelings very easily by
leaving Stanford without a Band at the Big
Game. And will the Farm look like it is living
up to its name by becoming a real cow-college!
It s a nice kettle of fish from the very start.
It is demoralizing to think that the Conference
would bring it up, and discouraging to think
what will happen should the affair be pressed
to a no-majorette conclusion.
Ex Committee will have to be more agile than
even a drum majorette to spin off the spot that
Women's Conference put it on.
As for Conference itself, their misguided
morality has left a nasty taste in Stanford's
mouth. And it isn't Cardinal Red.
