# Transferring Controls
## 
### 
THE question of transferability of student
body cards is about to be pulled out of the
wind, where it has shivered ever since the
U.C.L.A. game.
Excom s sub-committee for investigation last
night definitely went on record in favor of cards
with pictures and immediate revocation until

consideration by Men's or Women's Council
as the solution to a frigid situation.
A1 Masters has agreed that this is the best
way to stop violations.
The matter is now in the hands of Ex Com
mittee.
Proponents of a policy which would permit
transferability of the cards have appealed to
the Honor Code, have argued that one should
be permitted to dispose of what one purchases.
Proponents of non-transferability also have
referred to the Honor Code, have felt that team
support in the rooting section should be com
posed solely of Stanford men and women.
The whole situation has arisen because of
confusion and misunderstanding, for there has
never been any definite statement or regulation
in regard to A.S.S.U. cards.
Whichever policy it may adopt, then, let Ex
Committee turn the wind-tunnel switch and un
precedentedly set precedent where precedent
has never existed.â€”H. L. S.
