PAY, AND PAY, AND . . .
WYLLABUS fee bills came due last week, which sur
prised no one except perhaps a few freshmen who
had trusted the University's fantastically optimistic
estimate of expenses. As in previous years I watched
my check vanish through the A-K window, feeling a
strong sympathy for the French Revolutionists and
the sponsors of the Boston Tea Party. And as I
checked over my receipted bill, I understood how
peaceful men could heave cobblestones and shake
fists after official coaches. In fact, if there had been
any cobblestones around the Ad Building, I would
have been strongly tempted.
The University's gentle little invitation to remit
listed two of my courses at $1.50 each. One was a
journalism course in which we have received several
bales of mimeographed material instead of a text.
The other was an econ course in which the only thing
given us so far has been a mimeographed mid
quarter consisting of three questions. Even the assign
ments were written on the blackboardâ€”assignments,
incidentally, in a $5 text.

Those two items baffled me. Journalists are no
toriously impractical. And yet our journalism depart
ment manages to stake us to a carload of syllabus
sheets on $1.50. At the same time our shrewd econ
omists find it impossible to conduct a course without
charging the same amount even though they haven't
a nodding acquaintance with the mimeograph machine.
It is possible, of course, that I have taken the wrong
approach. Perhaps the journalists are being imprac
tical in charging so little, and the economists are dem
onstrating chummy familiarity with the principles of
monopoly profit.

[yiEDITATING dejectedly on this confusing elusive
ness of Truth, I borrowed a Time Schedule and
started to investigate. The philosophy department, I
thought, would undoubtedly have the whole question
worked out. The economists had probably read biog
raphies of financiers at an early age and got their out
looks warped. But the philosophers could be trusted
to enthrone Justice in their assessments.
The philosophy department was disappointing. For
logic there is a 50-cent fee; for advanced ethics there
is none. Evidently there is either no logic in ethics or
no ethics in logic. Either wya ,it was obvious that
the philosophers were on no better terms with Truth
than the economists.

My own bit of detective work on the trail of Jus
tice is backed up by the complaints of the students.
In the apportionment of syllabus fees, we find neither
ethics nor consistency. Each department makes its
own estimates of what the traffic will bear, fixes its
own charges, and reports them to the cashier's office,
which then adjusts the gears of the collection machin
ery. The result is a sort of economic impressionism.
I am not optimistic enough to believe that Stanford
will revise the system. But for the sake of our peace
of mind and our faith in dear alma mater, I suggest
that it stop itemizing the bills.
