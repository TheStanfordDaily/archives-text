/ comes out tomorrow, and that reminds
J me of the fiunniest Chappie story this year, a
story which will not be printed by Chaparral.
Art Lcvinson, generally referred to by Art Levin
son as the Old Boy, was walking down Palm Drive one
night a couple of weeks before autumn quarter started
when he was given a ride into Palo Alto by a professor.
"What activity brought you back to school so
early," the professor asked him.
"Chaparral," Lcvinson answered, jerking the word
out of the corner of his mouth as he always does.
The professor asked him what work he had to do
on Chappie this far before school.
"Oh, the editor has some work for me to do,"
Lcvinson answered.
The professor asked a few more questions, which
Lcvinson answered briefly out. of the corner of his
mouth, and then the prof asked him, "Who is the
editor this year?"
"Well. I am.*
He wasn't ashamed of it. He just sounded that wav.

Overheard in the post oiTice: One guy say
ing to another, 'My God, man, you get as much
mail as my whole fraternity does."
"This is the El Campo box," the guy answered,
"not mine."

told me this story. He said it was a
funny story:
Some very funny guys called by a mortuary the
other night and said that someone had died in the
Thcta house and would they send a couple of good
guys out quick with a hearse.
The same very funny guys called the cops, and the
guy who did the talking said he was the father of
the dead girl—only he didn't come right out and say
he was the father of a dead girl. He said he was the
father of a girl who was missing.
So the guys with the hearse came out and had a
devil of a time finding the Theta house. They found
no corpse.
The cops didn't find anything.
That's the story .
I don't get it.

At the Phi Psi dance last week-end. one guy was
complaining that he was having an awfully hard time
dancing.
"But. the two people dancing on mv feet seem to
be doing all right," he said.
