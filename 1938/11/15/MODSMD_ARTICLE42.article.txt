# Illumination Of 1939 Fair Subject of Talk
## Lighting Engineer Will Speak Tonight In Tuesday Series 
### 
"Treasure Island and What to Ex
pect in 1939" will be discussed to
night by A. F. Dickerson, illuminat
ing engineer for the Golden Gate In
ternational Exposition, when he pre
sents an illustrated lecture in Me
morial Hall auditorium at 7:30 p.m.,
a program in the weekly Tuesday
Evening Series.
"Illumination of the exposition's
buildings and grounds will, create
the illusion that Treasure Island is a
magical white city floating in the
middle of San Francisco Bay," de
clares the engineer, who is manager
of the illumination laboratory of the
General Electric Company.
Mr. Dickerson, who uses kilowatts
and currents as an artist, uses oils,
is in complete charge of the lighting
effects for the 1939 fair, and explains
that there will be no "monotonous
glare" characteristic of the illumina
tion of previous expositions, but in
dicates that instead, "through the
extensive use of certain harmonious
color combinations, a soft, jewel-like
glow" will be obtained.
PREVIEW OF LIGHTING
A complete lantern-slide review of
lighting effects secured in past large
expositions will be presented by the
illumination expert. This review
will include numerous slides of San
Francisco's previous fair, the Pana
ma-Pacific International Exposition
of 1915, considered by many illumi
nation engineers as the "yardstick"
for fair lighting.
"Illumination of Treasure Island
has been designed so that high
lights and shadows will break up the
usual monotonous flatness of flood
lighted surfaces," explains Mr. Dick
erson, who conceived the idea and
had complete charge of illuminating
Niagara Falls.
"Weather made to order" will be
created for the exposition through
the use of proper colored lights, ac
cording to the engineer, who re
veals that the illumination plan for
the fair calls for such warm colors
as red, orange, and yellow on chilly
nights, while on balmy evenings
cool sea-greens and icy blues will
be used.
