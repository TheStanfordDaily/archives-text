# A.S.S.U. Cards May Have Student Photos If...
## 
### 
Excom's sub-committee on student
body card violations last night unani
mously approved a system whereby
student pictures would be a pint of
the student body card. Their deci
sion will be turned over to Ex Com
mittee tonight for final recommenda
tion to the B.A.C.
Also approved was a method of
handling violations of card trans
ferability. The offender will have his
card revoked and each individual
case will be referred to Men's or
Women's Council for further con
sideration.
Alfred Masters, general manager
of the 8.A.C., agreed that the pic
ture system was the best way to
stop the transferring of student body
cards. He also said that this plan is
in use at other western colleges.
Details of the system reconunend
ed last night include pasting of a
composite photo and signature on the
card. This will then be stamped,
partially on the picture, by the
Registrar in receipt of tuition pay
ment. Registrar J. P. Mitchell ex
pressed the opinion that this plan
could be prepared for use next
quarter if given final approval soon
enough.
The first accordion was patented
in 1829 by Z. Damian, a Venetian,
although seven years earlier a 17-
year-old German, Christian Busch
mann, brought out a crude instru
ment bused on the same principle.
