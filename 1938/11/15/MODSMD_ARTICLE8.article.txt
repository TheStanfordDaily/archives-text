# Bunn Sees Problem In Planning Vocations
## 
### 
Helping Stanfordites decide on their future occupations is one of Hie
big problems of the I)eaji of Men's office, Dean John Bunn told members
of the Faculty Women's Club at their meeting yesterday in the Women's
Clubhouse.
"One-third of our entering freshmen have no idea of what they want
to do," he said. "Another third change their minds during their four

•years at Stanford."
Responsibility for vocational guid
ance is particularly heavy at Stan
ford, according to Dean Bunn, be
cause of the high number of stu
denti that spend all four years here
—70 per cent, as compared with
40 per cent at. most state schools.
The housing situation, another
problem for the Dean of Men, is ag
gravated by the fact that, houses and
halls provide rooms for only 1700 of
Stanford's 2900 men students, ac
cording to Mr. Bunn.
"We have insufficient housing fa
cilities for junior transfers," he said,
"so there are many who are unable
to join a living group and do not
have the feeling of belonging to
Stanford."
Although there are about 75 jun
ior transfers now living in the men's 1
dormatories, there was room for
only 14.4 transfers at the first of
the quarter, according to the ratio
of vacancies that' has been allotted
them.
With 120 student organizations on
the campus, exclusive of athletic
teams, the dean has a problem on
his hands in explaining social regu
lations and customs to new students,
Mr. Bunn told the members.
"Sometimes we take it. for granted
that students know the rules and
don't take trouble to explain them
thoroughly," he said.
Commenting on the scholarship
problem, Dean Bunn explained it is
his responsibility to check up on stu
dents who have trouble with grades.
