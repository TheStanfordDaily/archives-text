Bonfire will take place at the Enema Pow-wow tonight at 10 o'clock in
the Encina lobby. A large turnout is expected by Gordon McDonald,

main speaker of the evening. Oth
ers who will give pep talks include

Announcement that the Standard
Oil Company has agreed to donate
a loud speaker system for directing

the construction work and also for
use at the rally around the blazing
fire was released by Clint Olson, co
chairman of the Bonfire Committee.
A real old-fashioned feud has
been started between two factions of
the Bonfire Committee. Jack All
tucker, construction chairman, after
having studied a new system of
stresses and trusses as used in the
San Francisco Bay Bridge, has chal
lenged Max Moore, scavenger com
mittee manager, that he can build
the framework so high that Moore
won't be able to get enough wood
to fill it. Moore has accepted the
challenge and is exhorting his com
mitteemen and frosh scouters to get
more wood. The winner will be de
termined Thursday night after a
long day of toil by the frosh build
ers.
CONSTRUCTION DETAILS
Details of construction plans re
leased by Alltucker include the use
of nine telephone poles. Those on
the outside are set in the shape of
an equilateral triangle with 30-foot
sides; there will be a flue down the
center with a ditch dug under the
base to provide sufficient, draft
needed by the great amount of
wood piled into the towering pyre.
The whole structure will be soaked
with 500 gallons of oil donated by
Horabin's Feed and Fuel Company
of Palo Alto.
Carl Phillips, head of the trucking
committee, who will have charge of
hauling all the wood to the site of
Ihe fire on the lake bed, announced
that a meeting of his committee will
be held at 12:45 o'clock today in the
Nitery. Those assisting Phillips are
Teller Weinmann, Warren Pinney,
Wilson Clark, Pete Whittlesey, Stan
Glikbarg, Larry Marks, Stan Swaf
ford, and Ned Pugh. These people
were requested to bring to the
meeting their lists of those who had
agreed to loan trucks.
TRUCKS STARTS AT I A.M.
Truck drivers, who will be select
ed at the pow-wow tonight, will be
expected to start picking up wood at
about 4 o'clock Thursday morning.
As soon as the loads begin to come
in, official construction will get under
way, with wood being piled inside
the telephone pole frame.
Workers will be served luncheon
by a group of hand-picked Roble
women under the direction of Mary
K. Horton and her food committee.
Food donations have been promised
from sororities, dormitories, and
other living groups. Ghirardelli
Chocolate Company has donated
chocolate bars to feed the hungry
workers.
