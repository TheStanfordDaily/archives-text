# Gaieties Tunes May Rate Vallee Medley
## 
### PARKER KIMBALL 
"You could tell the moment you
glanced about the room right where
the boss was and who he was," ex
plained J. P. Cahn. He was immac
ulately, though conservatively dress
ed, and had a quiet—but very defi
nite—air of authority about him.
And there, sure enough, were the
Rudy Vallee eyes — though other
wise he looked little as I had imag
ined him from pictures and carica
tures.
'"He greeted us warmly and, with
out our noticing it, put us complete
ly at ease. You know —he's one hell
of a swell fellow!"
Thus Cahn, director of the 1938
Gaieties, came away from an inter
view with the personable Rudy, con
vinced that the latter was a "right
guy"—not because he had listened so
well to what Cahn had to say about
radio possibilities for Gaieties tunes,
but because he, in Cahn's own
words, "acted like any good fellow."
VALLEE RECEPTIVE
What made Cahn feel even better
was Vallee's friendly statement that,
provided the tunes in this year's
show stand out sufficiently, he would
be very happy to have them ar
ranged for his band and play them
as a medley from his Los Angeles
home station. Rudy even said that
he would have been glad to have
made records of the Gaieties tunes
if he had only brought his recording
outfit with him.
The meeting between Cahn and
Vallee was arranged by telegram be
ween Buddy Lees, co-author of
Gaieties song, "Tune in On Love,"
and Vallee's secretary, Mr. French.
"Glad to see you any afternoon —
Rudy Vallee," the telegram read.
3ahn, not knowing for sure whether
to take him literally or not, finally
decided to beard "the lion" in hi:

den yesterday afternoon while the
rest of the Gaieties songsters and
dancers rehearsed for the first time
with orchestra in a dingy little room
on Turk Street.
GUY WITH CONNECTIONS'
Vallee is now appearing at the San
Francisco auto show and has little
time for interviewing. "There was
some other guy waiting around to
see him while we were there—some
guy with connections. You know—a
friend of a musician who's got a
brother affiilated with—etc. When we
left he was still waiting." To Cahn
and Co. Rudy was the height of
friendliness and geniality, exhibit
ing no impatience to break away,
which is one way of making loyal
fans, Cahn will tell you. To him,
Rudy looked more like a young
lawyer than a famous band leader,
and even less like the "ogre" which
he really expected to find.
"In our car we nearly ran down
a man wearing a Ititle candid cam
era about, his neck while we were
looking for Vallee and Mr. French,"
grinned Cahn. "We didn't know un
til about 20 minutes later that we
had nearly done away with out
source of introduction—Mr. French."
