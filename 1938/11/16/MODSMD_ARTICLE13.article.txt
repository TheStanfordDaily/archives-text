# Excom Says No Funds For Fair Exhibit
## Committee Suggests Alumni Groups Pay For Stanford Day 
### 
If Stanford Day at the San Fran- I
cisco Fair is to be held as planned,
Ex Committee doesn't want to pay
the bill.
Members found time at their meet
ing last night to give the matter
consideration, although they spent
an hour discussing the Stanford band
and its majorette.
Instead of the Associated Students,
the Alumni Association or the Stan
ford Associates should be the ones {
to finance the venture, it was the
consensus.
Stanford Day has been slated for
April 8.
NO FUNDS
Offering "whole-hearted moral i
support" to the project, members de- I
cided the Associated Students could
not afford to lend their financial
support because of heavy expendi
tures this year for construction of
the new Boathouse.
According to Chairman E. E. Rob
inson of the Committee on Public
Exercises, which is making plans for
the program, "a considerable appro
priation" will be necessary.
One item being scheduled is a mo
tion picture of Stanford life, which
will cost approximately $3,000,
A.S.S.U. President H. B. Lee told
members.
ALUMNI PROBLEM
Student Manager Tom Killefer
pointed out it is Ex Committee's re
sponsibility to publicize such proj
ects, but held it is "more directly
the problem of the Alumni Asso
ciation and the Stanford Associates
and groups like that, which have the
machinery for handling that sort of
thing."
Lee stressed the importance of
having a high quality program, par
ticularly since University of Califor
nia has planned both a California
Day and a permanent exhibit at the
Exposition.
"It wouldn't be worth while to do
anything that wouldn't be worth
while," he said.
Other business was as follows:
BOATHOUSE: So the University
can be sure the Associated Students
will stand good for the Boathouse
expenditure, Ex Committee ap
proved Killefer's motion that the
A.S.S.U. agree to pay all expenses in
connection with the project.
Killefer explained such a motion
was a necessary formality before the
contract could be signed. The Boat
house will take the form of a stu
dent body gift to the University, he
said.
SKI CLUB MOVIE: When Bill
Janss, president of the Stanford Ski
Club, asked for permission to show
a motion picture in Memorial Hall,
Dec. 4, his request was refused be
cause the date is too close to finals.
No dates are granted within 10
days of the beginning of finals, Lee
explained. Janss was asked to de
cide on a new date for the program,
perhaps to postpone it until winter
quarter.
STUDENT BODY CARDS: Ap
proving the report of A1 Horn's sub
committee, Ex Committee agreed to
recommend to the Board of Ath
letic Control that (1) cards be non
transferable, identified by photo
graph of owner ,and (2) conviction
on a charge of transferring a card
be punished by immediate forfeiture
of the card, further action to be
taken by Men's and Women's
Councils.
Final action on the question will
be taken by the 8.A.C., Horn said.
FROSH GRID NUMERALS: Act
ing on recommendation of Al Mas
ters, general manager of the 8.A.C.,
and Harry Shipkey, freshman foot
ball coach, Ex Committee approved
granting of numerals to the follow
ing:
Frank Albert. Paul Blanton, Rob
ert Crane, Jack Francis, Winford
Jones, Peter Kmetovic, Jacob Levin,
Colin McClintock, Peter Mackey,
Fred Meyer, Lawrence Partridge.
David Patterson, Francis Radditz,
Russel Smith, Douglas Stahle, John
Sturgeon, Burt Talcott, and Edgar
Wilson.
Action on three additional numer
als was postponed until Ex Commit
tee's next meeting.
SPECIAL TRAIN RATE: The
committee granted use of the Asso
ciated Students' name to Southern
Pacific, which plans a special rate
for students going south for Thanks
giving.
