# Conference Calls Action 'Too Hasty'
## 'Nothing Personal' Intended, Declares Hibbard to Excom 
### 
Admitting that Women's Confer
ence might have acted hastily and
that opinion of women's living
groups on the campus may not have
coincided entirely with the organi
zation's recommendation on Monday,
Carolyn Hibbard, president, last
night declared that "no personal
discrimination was intended against
Maxine."
Miss Hibbard's statement released
to The Daily Is as follows:
"I would like to try to make a few
things clear.
NO CRITICISM OF BAND'
"Women's Conference, in its
discussions and conclusions, did not
intend to criticize either the con
duct of the band or the person of
the majorette, neither did they real
ize that Ex Committee would be put
on the spot.
"Their only wish was to discuss
the matter of future action with the
manager and personnel of the Band,
which they recognize as operating
exclusive of their control.
"That the reception their recom
mendation was accorded would be
so overwhelming and one of such
condemnation from many sources
was unforeseen, and undesired, by
the women.
ASKS OPINION
"The whole question was brought
up in Conference by a woman who
was interested in seeing what the
other delegates thought of the situ
ation, a woman who is only inci
dentally a member of Women's
Council, a subsidiary organization
of Conference. The question was
discussed and the opinion was ex
pressed that some consultive action
with the Band should be taken im
mediately.
"Accordingly a vocal vote was
taken and there was no dissenting
opinion. Since the meeting on Mon
day, some of the delegates have been
informed by the members of their
living groups that they would, after
consideration, have expressed a dif
ferent opinion from that of Confcr
j ence.
"In a democratic student govern-
I ment everyone has the right to his
j own opinion, and an equal right to
I change the same.
"Therefore, a subsequent meeting
jof Conference might produce an
j expression of opinion varying from
I that of Monday."
