# Excom, Conference Apologize To Maxine
## Group Tables Majorette Row 'For Present' Costume Change for Baton-Twirler Suggested, Then Dinged at Meeting 
### 
Apologies to Maxine Turner, band majorette, will be extended from Ex
{Committee and Women's Conference, according to vote of the student
governing body last nigbt.
ALso agreed tbat "the best tiling to do is to drop (be matter for the
present," Ex Committee tabled all discussion to take up the matter at some

♦future indefinite date.
; The letter apologies will be writ
j ten by H. B. Lee, student president,
and Carolyn Hibbard, president of
| Women's Conference.
Underlying the move is regret on
the part of both Ex Committee and
j Women's Conference that "such a
furor has been created" and that the
women's governing body did not
consider the effect on Maxine per
sonally.
Miss Hibbard, speaking to Ex
I Committee in explanation of the
I Women's Conference recommenda-

tion, said, "A lot of conference dele
gates feel that they did what their
living groups do not now approve.
That opinion has changed is very
apparent."
Also suggested by Ex Committee
in its discussion of the problems was
that the band had acted "hastily and
uncooperatively" in threatening to
strike. Although a vote of censure
was suggested, no action was taken.
Tom Killefer, student manager, in
presenting his view of the affair,
said, "Let's cut out the moral issue
and decide two questions. First,
whether or not opinion that has been
expressed isn't hard on the girl, and
i secondly, it seems to me that the
. band took a whole lot in their own
i hands."
He also suggested that the middle
j of football season was not the time
j to discuss the situation, and that a
definite policy be set either at the
end of the season or at the start of
the year, at which time it could Ixi
! seen that that policy would be en
| forced.
Ed York, manager of the band, in
I reply to suggestions that the organi
sation had "forgotten it was a stu
dent organization," replied, "We've
taken a beating from the whole stu
dent body in the past, so we don't
consider the band solely as a part,
of the student body."
Queries as to Maxine's feelings
lin regard to the whole matter,
brought the reply from York, "Sure,
I know what she said in the papers.
I told her to say it."
Apologies to the leader were voted
after a letter from the band and
signed by its 100 members had been
read to the committee, which pro
ceeded to approve the apology mo
: tion.

tion, said, "A lot of conference dele
gates feel that they did what their
living groups do not now approve.
That opinion has changed is very
apparent."
Also suggested by Ex Committee
in its discussion of the problems was
that the band had acted "hastily and
uncooperatively" in threatening to
strike. Although a vote of censure
was suggested, no action was taken.
Tom Killefer, student manager, in
presenting his view of the affair,
said, "Let's cut out the moral issue
and decide two questions. First,
whether or not opinion that has been
expressed isn't hard on the girl, and
i secondly, it seems to me that the
. band took a whole lot in their own
i hands."
He also suggested that the middle
j of football season was not the time
j to discuss the situation, and that a
definite policy be set either at the
end of the season or at the start of
the year, at which time it could Ixi
! seen that that policy would be en
| forced.
Ed York, manager of the band, in
I reply to suggestions that the organi
sation had "forgotten it was a stu
dent organization," replied, "We've
taken a beating from the whole stu
dent body in the past, so we don't
consider the band solely as a part,
of the student body."
Queries as to Maxine's feelings
lin regard to the whole matter,
brought the reply from York, "Sure,
I know what she said in the papers.
I told her to say it."
Apologies to the leader were voted
after a letter from the band and
signed by its 100 members had been
read to the committee, which pro
ceeded to approve the apology mo
: tion.
Apologies to Maxine Turner, band majorette, will be extended from Ex
{Committee and Women's Conference, according to vote of the student
governing body last nigbt.
ALso agreed tbat "the best tiling to do is to drop (be matter for the
present," Ex Committee tabled all discussion to take up the matter at some

♦future indefinite date.
; The letter apologies will be writ
j ten by H. B. Lee, student president,
and Carolyn Hibbard, president of
| Women's Conference.
Underlying the move is regret on
the part of both Ex Committee and
j Women's Conference that "such a
furor has been created" and that the
women's governing body did not
consider the effect on Maxine per
sonally.
