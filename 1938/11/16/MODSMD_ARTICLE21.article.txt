# Deinum Compares U.S., Netherlands
## 
### 
"The Netherlands is as democratic as the United States, if not more so,
and we are farther advanced in social reforms than in this country."
Andreis Deinum was responsible for this surprising statement and he
very ably presented proof in its behalf.
"Let us compare for example the labor situation in (lie Netherlands and
in the United States. We have very little labor trouble, as our unions and

capital do not continually fight; they
co-operate with each other," Andreis
.stated. "But if a disagreement arises
that can't be settled between them,
the government acts as a mediator.
This government agency is similar to
your National Labor Relations Board
founded in 1936, while ours has been
in use for over 50 years."
GOOD-LOOKING YOUTH
Andreis is a tall, blond, and good
looking youth of 20 with an inter
esting personality. He does not have
a Stanford scholarship and traveled
about 7000 miles before arriving here
• —all at his own expense. lie in
tends to earn all his own expenses
from now on by working at school
and, if necessary, he will work every
other quarter.
Andreis said that the Dutch and
American people are similar in that
they both love freedom. And this
same desire for continued freedom
makes the Dutch fear Hitler, for he
wants the Netherlands. All German
maps now include the Netherlands
in the Nazi empire, as Hitler needs
this territory for his war against
England. And there will be a war.
Chamberlain only postponed the
conflict, and is giving Germany a
chance to get so strong that nothing
will be able to stop her.
DISTRUSTS ENGLAND
'"My country distrusts England and
looks toward America and Russia
to solve the world's problems. We
are very tolerant of Russia, realiz
ing that it is just a new system,"
Andreis explained. "In fact, the
communist movement is growing fast
in the Netherlands, but it is not
looked on as a menace."
When asked from what part of
Holland he came, Andreis was great
ly disturbed and lor the next five
minutes he delivered a lecture on
misinformation and geography. He
explained the Americans' belief that
the name for his country is all wrong,
for Holland is only one section of
the Netherlands nation. "I come
lrom Friesland, another part of the
country,' he stated. "This section
has its own institutions and lan
guage, although Dutch Ls the official
language of all the Netherlands."
"I came to America primarily to
gain experience on your newspapers,
but decided to first attend school to
familiarize myself with your culture
and ways," Andreis said. "I chose
Stanford because I have many
friends here."
Although registered as a junior,
Andreis revealed that he has only
attended school twelve years. He
graduated from the "gymnasium," a
four-year school that prepares stu
dents for higher education, with
enough units to enter Stanford as
an upperclassman. In this he was
i equiied to take Latin, Greek,
French, German, English, and Dutch
3.) hours in all—at the same time.
