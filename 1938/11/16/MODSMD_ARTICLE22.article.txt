er. Norman Nelson, Frank Mallory j
and John Moscovics will carry the '

tion will be upheld by the labor !

pected, ride its proverbial fence,!
with one section joining with the 1
conservatives and the other the la- j
borites or perhaps putting forward ,
a separate plan of its own.
DUES COLLECTED

door to collect dues, as this is the '
