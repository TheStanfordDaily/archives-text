# Dee Indicates Activity Plans
## Frosh President Confers with Gore 
### 
After conferring with student
body leaders during the past few
days, Larry Dee, newly elected
frosh class president, yesterday gave
some indication of his tentative plans
for frosh activities for the ensuing
college year.
"I think the freshmen should
have a real class spirit this year
and we can continue the fine record
set for u.s by our football team by
putting everything into the building
of the best bonfire ever seen on the
campus," Dee said.
With construction of the fire con
fined to one day for the first time,
this year's freshman class will have
a particularly stupendous job, he
pointed out.
Sue Atkinson, freshman secretary,
asked all Robleites to co-operate in
putting the bonfire over.
In disclosing some other activity
ideas, Dee said that he would try to
arrange exchange dinners between
Encinans and Robleites more fre
quently than in the past. In addi
tion, he said that last year's Stan
ford-California Frosh Frolic would
be revived next spring after the Big
Meet.
Dee consulted Art Gore, class of
'41 president, with an idea of enlarg
ing upon the activities which he
instituted.
