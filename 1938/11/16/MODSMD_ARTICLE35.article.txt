# Young Speaks On Far Hast To Lunch Club
## Speech Presented In Answer to Requests Of Student Groups 
### 
In a special effort to interest not
only students in general but those
who have any concern with affairs
of the Far East, Hobart Young of
the Food Research Institute will
speak on "Student Institute of Pa
cific Relations" at today's Luncheon
Club meeting.
This speech is to be presented in
answer to requests of various stu
dent groups interested in the prob
lem. Young has been associated
with the Student Institute of Pa
cific Relations since its founding.
FOUNDED IN !92<Â»
In 1926 this group was founded by
Cal, Stanford, and Mills students. It
was then sponsored by Japanese,
Chinese, Cosmopolitan and Interna
tional Relations Clubs and the Y. M.
C. A. and Y.W.C.A. groups. It was
finally incorporated in 1932 as a sep
arate and independent organization.
This student-run group has for
its purpose the bringing together of
foreign and American students to
discuss problems of the Pacific area.
The object is to help each student to
understand these questions better,
but not to form any group conclu
sions.
Among the prominent alumni of
the Institute are Miya Sanomiya of
the Japan Cultural Society in
Tokyo, a well-known Japanese naval
officer who recently participated in
important peace parleys, and Dr.
Reginald 8011, associate professor of
education at Stanford.
