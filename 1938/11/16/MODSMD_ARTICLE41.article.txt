CORVALLIS, Ore., Nov. 15 (UP).
â€”The Oregon State football squad,
conquerors of Stanford last Satur
day, went through only a light
workout today. The Beavers' next
game is with Oregon at Portland
November 26. Classes were dismissed
yesterday in celebration of the vic
tory over Stanford.
Mrs. Fred Clarke of Grand Rapids,
Mich., has been collecting clippings
on insomnia for 10 years and her
suggestions include counting sheep
and walking barefoot in the dewy
grass.
