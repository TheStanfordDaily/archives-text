HONOLULU. T.H., Nov. 15 (UP).
â€”The somewhat embarrassed U. S.
Army flying service, which trusts its
! big bombers only to men it has rig
idly trained for months, named
three separate boards tonight to in
vestigate Private Ben Flegielman's
feat in taking up one of the bombers
alone and Hying it five miles with
out having had five minutes training.
Fleigelman crashed, but not be
fore he had performed a feat
which until today Army men would
have said was impossible.
While nine officer experts are try
ing to find out the whys and hows
of the almost incredible flight, Flei
gelman lay in an Army hospital
recovering from the slight injuries
he suffered in the forced landing in
a pineapple plantation.
