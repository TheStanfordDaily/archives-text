# Chappie Jokes Funny For Forty Long Years
## 
### KATHERINE JOUNSEN 
NOW THAT campus life has had its 3(>oth laugh at itself—because last )
month's Chaparral is the .'{(>olh recording of campus life in comics—
Marco Thorne, '3!), is compiling a history hook from the things the
Farm has laughed at through the years.
Nine times a year for 40 years—from 1X!(8 to I)):lX—the Farm has

laughed at itself and others . . . so,<
"'Forty Funny Years" is the name
that will go to Thome's Chaparral
history.
He has written 100 alumni of
Hammer and Coffin in all parts of
the world inquiring about their days
on Chappie and their replies will be
published complete in the book. It
will be a cross-section of the hu
morous thought on the campus since
'98. There will be one chapter on
ihe best cartoons —then, there will
lie a study of the grade averages of
the Chappies, of what they did later
in life, and the number of them in
"Who's Who."
COPIED FROM CORNELL
There were only five college com
ics when Bristow Adams founded
Chaparral and patterned it after the
Cornell "Widow" —and edited it in
his Encina room.
"It is better to have loved and
lost than never to have loved iit
all" . . . The first Chappies laughed
Tennyson's proposal off and derived
from it their motto, "It is better to
have lived and laughed than never
to have lived at all" . . . and Chap
pies have been since practicing that
motto.
The Press Club —which also ed
ited The Daily—put out Chaparral
lor the ensuing years.
But, on April 17. 1906 a group of
Chappies met and decided that the
old regime was dead. They bull
sessioned about it through half the
night. Should they go home and
study and let the dead alone? Yes—
no—yes —no! So they continued
Iheir bull-session . . . which re
sulted in the formation of Hammer
;md Coffin Society.
CAME THE EARTHQUAKE
Four hours later—the Earthquake
of '00. The great tragedy which
prevented the lesser tragedy of some
funnymen flunking their exams the
next day.
Up until the time of the war,
Chappie humor is marked by play
on words. The typical joke (from
'01):
Harriet—Oh, it's a shame! You
were simply cut out to marry her.
Harry—l would have, if it hadn't
been for the fellow who cut me out.
Chappies of the first decade of the
20th century are half-filled with se
rious poetry — poems of sentimental
attachment to the University and
love sonnets — which later dwindle
out, never to return.
ANOTHER OLD-TIMER
Around the war time, women came
to the front in Chappie — women
joined the staff and the first comic
women appeared in Chappie car
toons. M. Bailey edited a women's
edition in '13. An excerpt from her
humor:
Yes, Redwood is the place for us."
the guileless Froshy said.
"Get out!" the doughty Sopho
mores cried, and banged him on
the head—
"Only the manly Sophomore hat
in Redwood streets is seen."
"Well, ain't it named for us?" he
cried. "Why redwood's ever
green!"
Before the war broke out, Editor
Lance of the Chappie had written
anti-war. So, when the United
States entered he resigned by pres
sure caused by his pre-war doctrine.
He went to France, and he is there
today as a French correspondent.
JOKES FROM FRANCE
Chaparral was issued all through
the war. The Chappies wrote their
funny-stuff in France and sent it
home. One complete issue of Chap
pie was edited by Editor Wully
Wohlford and other Chappies in the

| trenches and sent to Stanford for
; publication. The "Over There Num
| ber," it is culled . . . and between
j its covers is the bitterest irony that
Stanford hands have ever written.
J After the war—with the universal
eruption of standards — came the
blaze era in humor. And the "rah!
rah! . . . and so what does it all
amount to" attitude penetrated
Chappie's humor until '29, the de
pression year.
Then for the first -time, political
and economic thought—worldly af
fairs — figured to any extent, in
Chappie's art and quips. And this
satire on conditions continued domi
nant until the Hartmann - Gist re
gime began fashioning most of the
funny stuff to fit a "men and wom
en" theme.
