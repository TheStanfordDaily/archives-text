## Heinecke, Shell Oil Plan to Make Gift Yearly Tradition 
### 
A display of fireworks unprece
dented in the history of Stanford
Big Game Bonfires will be presented
by the Shell Oil Company and Walt!
Heinecke, '30, Shell dealer on the |
campus.
Heinecke, All-American center,
from Stanford in 1929, has expressed ]
a desire that this year's display will
start a Farm tradition and he has
stated that he plans to try and make
this spectacular show a yearly oc
curi-ence.
Details of the types of the $400
worth of pyrotechnic specialties to
be set off were told by Red Holman,
campus representative for Shell Oil
Company. He stated that the fire
works had been made up especially
for the Stanford bonfire. Many of
the aerial bomb pieces and night
flag shells will be shot to a great
altitude, then release a parachute
with Stanford banners, pet slogans,
and pictures. Other novelties will
include skyrockets and flash bombs.
Arrangements for the spectacular
show have been made possible
through A. R. Boyer, district man
ager of Shell Oil.
This bang-up starting of the-Bon
fire Rally is expected to get more
students than ever out to the rally
i and will add more interest and pep
jto the frenzied pre-game activities
of Farm students.
Confidence of the Shell Oil Com-
J pany in the continued patronage of
I the two campus service stations by
Stanford students has prompted
them to make this great donation to
the bonfire festivities. It is also be
j ing taken under considei'ation to
| make the gift an annual donation to
i the Bonfire committees of the future.
