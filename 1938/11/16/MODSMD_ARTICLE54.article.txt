# Lighting Expert Speaks on Fair
## Exposition to Stress 'Fineness, Beauty' 
### 
"The most beautiful exposition of
all time will be San Francisco's
Golden Gate International Exposi
tion on Treasure Island next year,"
predicted A. F. Dickerson, illumi
nating engineer for the fair, who
spoke last night in Memorial Hall.
"While New York's World Fair is
striving for 'bigness,' our exposition
in San Francisco Bay will emphasize
'fineness,' beauty, and quality," ex- j
plained the expert, who spoke on
"Exposition Illumination and What
to Expect at Treasure Island in
1939" at a program in the Tuesday
Evening Series.
USE "BLACK LIGHT"
Spectacular and striking lighting
effects will be secured for the fair
through the extensive use of ultra
violet illumination and fluorescent
paints, Mr. Dickerson asserted, re
vealing that "we must beat the 'yard
.slick of 1915,' San Francisco's pre
vious Panama-Pacific International
Exposition,' now considered by illu
mination experts the standard of
fair lighting.
"This ultra-violet or 'black' light,
which is being used on a large scale
out-of-doors for the first time at
Treasure Island, will make possible
colors you never saw before, even
on the stage," predicted the light
ing expert, who is manager of the
illumination laboratory of the Gen
eral Electric Company.
PRESENTS FAIR REVIEW
A lantern-slide review of the il
lumination of previous large expo
sitions, including Chicago's Century
of Progress Exposition in 1933, the
Brazilian Centennial in Rio de Ja
neiro in 1922, Dallas' "Texas Cen
tennial," and the Great Lakes Expo
sition in Cleveland in 1936, was pre
sented by Mr. Dickerson, who served
as illumination consultant for the
Dallas, Cleveland, and Brazilian
fairs.
The illumination expert was in
troduced by Frederick E. Terman,
professor of electrical engineering.
