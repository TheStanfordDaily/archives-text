# Waterdogs Will Meet Cal Today
## Tram Concentrates On Stopping Bears' Captain Wheeler 
### 
Stop Ken Wheeler!
With this objective in mind, the
varsity water polo squad under
Coach Nort Thornton will invade the i
Berkeley campus this afternoon to
meet California in the first of a two
game series to decide the Pacific >
Coast Conference title. The game
will begin at 4 o'clock.
Since the Bears are undefeated in j
conference competition, the Card
water dogs must win both games
to win the championship. One loss |
will give California its first undis- |
puted water polo championship in [
the 26 years of competition. Stan- '
ford, on the other hand, has won the
title 23 years out of the last 26.
BEARS FAVORED
The Golden Bears will be slightly !
favored, as their brililant Captain |
Wheeler will be able to play an en- I
tire game for the first time this sea
son. This great forward, who beat 1
the Trojans twice with only a total
of four minutes of playing time, has
been out most of the regular season
with a wrenched shoulder.
To counteract this, Coach Thorn
ton has devised a new secret defense !
built around Ted Moreno, stellar
sophomore guard, who has been
shifted from left to right guard, in
an efTort to stop Wheeler. While de
fense has been stressed, the Stanford i
offense will not be lacking with Cap
tain Johnny Lamb, Bob Plate, and
Jack Loupe in the forward wall. Thus ,
trio, backed by Harvey Rothschild,
has borne the brunt of the scoring
and has only gone down to defeat
twice this season.
STANFORD LINE-UP
The starting line-up for the In- !
dians for tomorrow's game is as fol- .
lows: Bob Plate, sprint; Johnny |
Lamb and Jack Loupe, forwards; '
Harvey Rothschild, centerback; j
Dick Hoover and Ted Moreno, i
guards; and either Frank Dowling j
or Roy Vitousek as goalie.
In a preliminary game, starting at
3:15 o'clock, the Card frosh will j
tangle with the California Cubs, i
Both teams are high-scoring outfits
with the Bearcubs slightly favored, j
due to a tighter defense. Dudley,
Manwaring, Bacon, Patty, Holton.
Pollack, Abrahamson, and Smith '
will probably start for ihe Indian
frosh.

or Roy Vitousek as goalie.
In a preliminary game, starting at
3:15 o'clock, the Card frosh will j
tangle with the California Cubs, i
Both teams are high-scoring outfits
with the Bearcubs slightly favored, j
due to a tighter defense. Dudley,
Manwaring, Bacon, Patty, Holton.
Pollack, Abrahamson, and Smith '
will probably start for ihe Indian
frosh.
Stop Ken Wheeler!
With this objective in mind, the
varsity water polo squad under
Coach Nort Thornton will invade the i
Berkeley campus this afternoon to
meet California in the first of a two
game series to decide the Pacific >
Coast Conference title. The game
will begin at 4 o'clock.
Since the Bears are undefeated in j
conference competition, the Card
water dogs must win both games
to win the championship. One loss |
will give California its first undis- |
puted water polo championship in [
the 26 years of competition. Stan- '
ford, on the other hand, has won the
title 23 years out of the last 26.
BEARS FAVORED
The Golden Bears will be slightly !
favored, as their brililant Captain |
Wheeler will be able to play an en- I
tire game for the first time this sea
son. This great forward, who beat 1
the Trojans twice with only a total
of four minutes of playing time, has
been out most of the regular season
with a wrenched shoulder.
To counteract this, Coach Thorn
ton has devised a new secret defense !
built around Ted Moreno, stellar
sophomore guard, who has been
shifted from left to right guard, in
an efTort to stop Wheeler. While de
fense has been stressed, the Stanford i
offense will not be lacking with Cap
tain Johnny Lamb, Bob Plate, and
Jack Loupe in the forward wall. Thus ,
trio, backed by Harvey Rothschild,
has borne the brunt of the scoring
and has only gone down to defeat
twice this season.
STANFORD LINE-UP
The starting line-up for the In- !
dians for tomorrow's game is as fol- .
lows: Bob Plate, sprint; Johnny |
Lamb and Jack Loupe, forwards; '
Harvey Rothschild, centerback; j
Dick Hoover and Ted Moreno, i
guards; and either Frank Dowling j
or Roy Vitousek as goalie.
