# Cards, Cal to Put Full Grid Strength on Field
## 
### 
Physically speaking, neither Stan
ford nor California will have an ex
cuse for losing the Big Game.
Almost simultaneously with the
word from the Indians' team phy
sicians that the Cards would be in
top condition came advice from
across the bay that the entire Bear
aggregation is in fine fettle bodily.
The only trouble over there is the
fact that too many Cal students and
players are already making reserva
tions for the Cocoanut Grove on
New Year's night.
Two weeks ago Southern Califor
nia looked like a cinch to get the
Rose Bowl bid. Then they lost to
Washington last Saturday and now
the Bears want that $100,000 to fur
ther educational pursuits or some
thing at Berkeley.
But Stub Allison and his corp of
coaches don't like to have their
men dreaming about Bowls until
they have thoroughly thumped the
Indians. That's where psychology
will favor Stanford.
Tiny Thornhill has brought his
men through a desolate season in
extraordinary mental shape. When
you read about strikes and team agi
tation at other losing schools, you
really have to hand a prize palm to
the Indian coaches for maintaining
morale as they have.
The Indians were hard at work
again last night under the lights, all
seeming very sincere in the belief
that they can upset the Bears and
knock the conference race into an
other tangle. Stan Andersen, right
tackle, was back from Oregon and
went to his old spot on the first
string. Freddie Ledeboer ran at left
half although he had his left shin
bandaged to prevent further damage
to his leg.
The only man of any doubt on the
first three strings was Jackie Bren

[ ner, who is still limping with an
| old charley horse. Brenner has per-
I formed more than creditably while
Pete Fay was out of commission and
might be missed Saturday.
If Brenner doesn't round into
j shape, Thornhill plans to use Thor
Peterson and Dick Carew as reserves
for the left hall and safety role
i when and if Fay gives out, provided
he doesn't shift Ledeboer over from
i right half.
