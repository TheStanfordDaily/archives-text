T~)UT back the Blue Stockings.
r Hush the shush-shush sound effects ma
chine.
Open Grandma's horsehide trunk again and
hide away the smelling-salts and lavender per
fume.
Queen Victoria has gone back to her grave.
And Stanford's two-day furor is over.
Ex Committee says so, Women's Conference
says so, and along with them, The Daily thank
fully winds up the unsightly skein of charges,
counter-charges, abuse, and rationalization.
The party's over. Let Stanford try to forget
its hang-over.
For what has been done, tv/o letters of apol
ogy are in the mail to Maxine Turner —one from
the Executive Committee and one from Wom
en's Conference. To these, let The Daily add
its regrets that on Stanford's campus such an
affair should have occurred.
Undoubtedly, comment could still be piled
on top of what already has been said, written,
or printed. It could be ripe and juicy—and ob
vious. But after tonight, after the matter is offi
cially dropped, further comment only can cast
reflections which are in as bad taste as the ini
tial action.
So, joining in the general backwards move
ment of parties concerned, The Daily perforce
forgets too. But not regretfully.
For the future, let Stanford turn its eyes to a
more important problem—the Big Game. No
schism should be allowed to tear a gash in
Stanford's traditional Big Game spirit.
That this break in the growing unity should
have occurred four days before the classic only
adds to the unfortunate appearance of the Ter
rible Turmoil. But now that it is over, the break
should be mended. It can only be accom
plished by whole-hearted co-operation of every
Stanford organization, acting either individually
or collectively.
Stanford will be on the field Saturday—not
simply the rooters' section, the drum majorette,
the cheer leaders, the Band, or the team.
In conclusion there is only one thing to say:
Long live the Band, Stanford's Band.
Long live Conference.
Long live tact, good taste, and grace in re
versing a field.
Requiescat in Pace.

more important problem—the Big Game. No
schism should be allowed to tear a gash in
Stanford's traditional Big Game spirit.
That this break in the growing unity should
have occurred four days before the classic only
adds to the unfortunate appearance of the Ter
rible Turmoil. But now that it is over, the break
should be mended. It can only be accom
plished by whole-hearted co-operation of every
Stanford organization, acting either individually
or collectively.
Stanford will be on the field Saturday—not
simply the rooters' section, the drum majorette,
the cheer leaders, the Band, or the team.
In conclusion there is only one thing to say:
Long live the Band, Stanford's Band.
Long live Conference.
Long live tact, good taste, and grace in re
versing a field.
Requiescat in Pace.
