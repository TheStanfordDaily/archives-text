# NYA Students To Report Jobs
## 
### 
Mrs. Irene Coverley, head of the
Student Employment Bureau, an
nounced yesterday that to date there
have been very few responses to the
bureau's notice concerning NYA job
holders.
Hoping for a better response, Mrs.
Coverley said, "All undergraduates
on NYA are again reminded to re
port promptly to the Employment
Bureau if they are not able to work
the full number of hours assigned to
them for the present payroll period,
which ends November 22.
"Also, all undergraduates must
sign new release cards between No
vember 22."
More jobs are expected for stu
dents with the coming of the Thanks
giving and Christmas holidays.
