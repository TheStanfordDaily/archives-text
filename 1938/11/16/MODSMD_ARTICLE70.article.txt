# Fire Up, Frosh
## 
### 
EVEN greater than the fire which has blazed
on Stanford's campus, will be the one which
reddens the sky Thursday night, flaming up
to the effigy of the California Bear, turning it
into flimsy ashes.
Stanford has turned in whole-heartedly to
feed fuel into the controversial blaze which
has occupied thought and comment for the last
two days.
Now it's the turn of the frosh to take a cue
from their campus, put enough between the
telephone poles on Lagunita's bed to confound
critics of the one-day building limit, to ignite
Stanford's Big Game spirit to a white-hot heal,
to make the Big Game Bonfire a magnificent
symbol of Stanford's part in Saturday's game.
The frosh, as always, have claimed the title

to the most spirited class ever to come to Stan
ford. So they get a real test tomorrow night,
one written not with ink but with orange-red
tongues of flame.
Initial plans for construction have been laid
carefully. But figured into them is an unknown
quantity to be solved for, symbolized by the
cryptic figures '42.
Realizing that the one-day limit only makes
the job tougher, Stanford's credits to the frosh
for work done Thursday have been cut on a
more generous scale than usual. But no one
gets credit for toasting marshmallows, anyone
can do that.
And besides, the weather's too cold for a
small fire.
It will be colder in the rooters' stands Satur
day if Stanford doesn't start a red-hot circulation
from the blaze tomorrow night.
Listen, frosh, you wouldn't want Stanford to
freeze, would you?
So pile it on, '42, pile it on.
