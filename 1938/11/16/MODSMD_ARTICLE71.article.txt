### JOHN COBBS 
OUR NIGIIT TO HOWL
d ORDINARILY Stanford students lead the quiet,
well-adjusted life that goes with good digestions
and easy consciences, but for the rest of this week,
the Farm is going to play Cinderella, emerging from
the ashes of midquarters and collateral reading into
the gay romance of Big Game week. Freshmen will
sleep lightly like trained shock troops, keyed to the
sound of the fire whistle alarm. Upperclassmen will
take a tactical interest in available fence pickets and
bricks, appraising with a military eye the Farm's de
fense facilities. The administration will pray with
pessimistic nervousness that the week will pass with
out manslaughter.
All of us, except possibly the administration, will
have a beautifLil time. The possibility of a Cal raid
gives us a feeling of romantic danger, like the thrill
that used to come from reading stories about Indian
fighters. As we go our alert way we realize that all
this would make excellent material for a novel, and
we feel vaguely proud of the fact that we are so
colorful.

About a generation ago, the universities were forced
to unload almost all their holdings of the old "college
spirit." The era of seriousness set in, and football games
became mere athletic events instead of national crises.
The ancient Fords decorated with wise-cracks were
replaced with sleek coupes which differed in no way
from those owned by grocers and insurance men. Cows
were left grazing placidly in meadows, and ceased
to appear suddenly in classrooms.
All of this was an improvement, of course; but
romance is always a precious commodity, and the new
seriousness left no place for romance. Today we read
of the old-time explosions ;md comfort ourselves with
the thought that we are getting our money's worth
out of our tuition. But we feel vaguely envious, as
though we had taken our Christmas presents in "prac
tical" things instead of alluring luxuries.

GAME gives us our one chance to flirt with
the colorful romance we had to desert. For a
week we can treat ourselves to enthusiastic nonsense
without imperiling our investment in education. We
can play cops and robbers with Cal raiders, and we
can get a pleasant thrill out of ihe old "school spirit"
that rattled around our ancestors' nervous systems.
During Big Game week, romance plays a return
engagement. Glamour and color lie over the campus in
a rosy mist. We are no longer emotional bourgeois;
we are gay, dashing cavaliers.

Undoubtedly the whole thing has a psychological
explanation and can be cross-indexed and pigeonholed
according to synapses and goal-sets. But we haven't
time to bother with the psychology of it. For iho rest
of this week we can be devil-may-care swashbucklers
instead of mousy intellectuals.
Don't wait up for us, alma mater.

of this week we can be devil-may-care swashbucklers
instead of mousy intellectuals.
Don't wait up for us, alma mater.
OUR NIGIIT TO HOWL
d ORDINARILY Stanford students lead the quiet,
well-adjusted life that goes with good digestions
and easy consciences, but for the rest of this week,
the Farm is going to play Cinderella, emerging from
the ashes of midquarters and collateral reading into
the gay romance of Big Game week. Freshmen will
sleep lightly like trained shock troops, keyed to the
sound of the fire whistle alarm. Upperclassmen will
take a tactical interest in available fence pickets and
bricks, appraising with a military eye the Farm's de
fense facilities. The administration will pray with
pessimistic nervousness that the week will pass with
out manslaughter.
All of us, except possibly the administration, will
have a beautifLil time. The possibility of a Cal raid
gives us a feeling of romantic danger, like the thrill
that used to come from reading stories about Indian
fighters. As we go our alert way we realize that all
this would make excellent material for a novel, and
we feel vaguely proud of the fact that we are so
colorful.

About a generation ago, the universities were forced
to unload almost all their holdings of the old "college
spirit." The era of seriousness set in, and football games
became mere athletic events instead of national crises.
The ancient Fords decorated with wise-cracks were
replaced with sleek coupes which differed in no way
from those owned by grocers and insurance men. Cows
were left grazing placidly in meadows, and ceased
to appear suddenly in classrooms.
All of this was an improvement, of course; but
romance is always a precious commodity, and the new
seriousness left no place for romance. Today we read
of the old-time explosions ;md comfort ourselves with
the thought that we are getting our money's worth
out of our tuition. But we feel vaguely envious, as
though we had taken our Christmas presents in "prac
tical" things instead of alluring luxuries.

GAME gives us our one chance to flirt with
the colorful romance we had to desert. For a
week we can treat ourselves to enthusiastic nonsense
without imperiling our investment in education. We
can play cops and robbers with Cal raiders, and we
can get a pleasant thrill out of ihe old "school spirit"
that rattled around our ancestors' nervous systems.
During Big Game week, romance plays a return
engagement. Glamour and color lie over the campus in
a rosy mist. We are no longer emotional bourgeois;
we are gay, dashing cavaliers.

Undoubtedly the whole thing has a psychological
explanation and can be cross-indexed and pigeonholed
according to synapses and goal-sets. But we haven't
time to bother with the psychology of it. For iho rest
of this week we can be devil-may-care swashbucklers
instead of mousy intellectuals.
