John Shallenberger, our sports editor, is having a
lot of trouble these days. One of our copyreaders, who
has been secretly in love with a great many Stanford
athletes, wants to write varsity basketball.
"I could do a very good job," she says.
"No."
"I would get you lots of pictures."
"No."
"It would be a new angle."
"Yes."
"Then I can write it?"
"No."
"Ah. pretty pretty pretty please."
"No."
It goes on day after day.

| 'WO Encina hashers and a head hasher acted out
very seriously and unconsciously an old, old story
the other day. It is very surprising that the right
characters were surprised and angry in the right
places.
The scene i.s the Encina Commons kitchen. The
time, before lunch:
Head Hasher: You are a dog, Hasher. Why didn't
you come to work this morning?
Hasher: I was very tired this morning. I was sick
yesterday and all last night. I couldn't conic to work
this morning.
Head Hasher: Well, maybe.
Hasher: So help me, I was sick.
Another hasher comes on stage upper loft.
Second Hasher: Say. boy, you were doing all right
last night. What a woman you had.
At this point the first hasher was very sore.
And the Head Hasher was surprised, shocked.
Can it be that the Stanford women complaining
against Maxine Turner are afraid their Stanford men
wiil become The Poy-frionHs of the Whirling Dervivh?
