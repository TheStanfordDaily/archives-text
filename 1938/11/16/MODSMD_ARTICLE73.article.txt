## MAJORETTE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What is this gripe that the Stan
ford Women's Conference have about
the Band's Majorette?
It seems that they don't think that
she is representative of the Stanford
women and that her performance on
the field is undignified.
The spectators have never paid
any attention to the band for years
so it seems that now because the
band has come out of its hiding and
gotten a little pep and swing, a few
jealous girls are trying to screw up
the works.
They claim she is not representa
tive of the Stanford woman, but, my
dear brethren, is the band repre
sentative of the Stanford women?
No, it is representative of the stu
dent body as a whole and not some
minor group of old ladies. The ma
jority of the students have signified
their approval by the ovation they
now give the band whenever it
marches on the field. Because ol
her, our band has gotten its best
publicity in years.
If they can interpret her per
formance on the field as undignified
they probably could read in a dirty
meaning for "Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs."
What, about the rally committee's
Indian Squaw at the W.S.C. game?
Did they consider her dignified? Dc
the ladies objecting think they coulc
carry the job out as well or with
more dignity? They probably woulc
look like a group of cows doing t
spring dance if they were to try it.
It also seems very peculiar that
they have waited so long in the sea
son before raising an objection, es
pecially just before Big Game, where
we want to make as fine a showing
as possible.
Abolishing our Majorette woulc
sure be a new high in raising oui
school spirit to a new low.
