The Editor, Sir:
In your Tuesday issue I happened ;
to come upon an article denouncing j
the leadership of the Stanford Band. I
As a former band member I wish to I
say a lew words in defense of a very !
versatile young lady. In years gone i
by much comment concerning the j
por quality of the band due to the j
lack of spirit has been much. This j
year the band has been rejuvenated
through Ihe efforts of this little gal.'
She has more spirit than many of our J
so-called spirited females. As a case ;
in point let me point to the girls who
brought their books to the last game.

' I was sitting right in back of them
so I know.
As far as conduct unbecoming a
j Stanford woman, I don't think that
| the women on this campus have a
j lot to crow about. You can see that
I for yourselves. Of all the prudish,
j bigoted, nasty, uncomplementary.
! libelous remarks to make, the one
I given out by Woman's Conference
| (our mid-Victorian aunts) that one
I concerning conduct is the craziest.
What must that little gal think of
! our university now? I've met her
| and she's really a grand kid, the
kind we ought to have on this cam
pus, not the kind we've got. I hope
j she sues for defamation of character.
More power to Maxine Turner
j and the Stanford Band. Long may
j they wave! Carry on!
