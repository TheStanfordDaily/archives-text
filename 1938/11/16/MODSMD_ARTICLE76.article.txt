It seems a pity that so many in
teresting courses have to be skipped
for the year 1938-H9. Just what can

such courses? The subject I have '
in mind is Studies in the Psychol- .

dience responses to dramatic situa

design, and movement on the stage
I know at least ten people win

enroll. Next year will be too lati
for us. Just what is to be done?
