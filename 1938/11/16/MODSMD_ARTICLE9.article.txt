# Farm to Have Unusual Stunts
## Rooters to Form Moving Card Tricks 
### 
A new era in Farm Card stunts
will be inaugurated Saturday at the
Big Game, according to Jack Laney,
Rally Committee chairman, when
moving card stunts will be used here
for the first time.
The new method of flipping the
cards so that the stunt moves grad
ually into the section makes it easier
to show a continued stunt which
has several parts. To make it easier
for the men to follow the stunts, each
trick will be numbered in order
instead of lettered.
There will be eight complete stunts
Saturday, consisting of 30 parts al
together. The first stunts will wel
come Cal with a large "UC." A red
flame will come up and recede, leav
ing a red "S." The second stunt will
show an Indian pushing a Bear off
a see-saw. In the third group the
Indian will chase the Bear until he
catches and upsets him, while the
Bear's face turns red.
AXKSTUNT
The fourth stunt will show the
Bear's head swelling as he wins each
game. But when he meets Stanford
his head bursts, leaving a large In
dian head. A special axe stunt has
also been planned by Rally Com
mittee.
The Stanford seal will be the sub
ject for another stunt and Tiny
Thornhiil's head will be featured in
another. There will also be a trick
about the Community Chest Drive.
Didi Vibert is being assisted with
the card stunts by Phil Clayburgh.
Virginia Sterry, and Sue Hyman.
Members and tryoutees of Pally
Committee have been working ever>
afternoon for the past week and a
half on the stunts.

A new era in Farm Card stunts
will be inaugurated Saturday at the
Big Game, according to Jack Laney,
Rally Committee chairman, when
moving card stunts will be used here
for the first time.
The new method of flipping the
cards so that the stunt moves grad
ually into the section makes it easier
to show a continued stunt which
has several parts. To make it easier
for the men to follow the stunts, each
trick will be numbered in order
instead of lettered.
There will be eight complete stunts
Saturday, consisting of 30 parts al
together. The first stunts will wel
come Cal with a large "UC." A red
flame will come up and recede, leav
ing a red "S." The second stunt will
show an Indian pushing a Bear off
a see-saw. In the third group the
Indian will chase the Bear until he
catches and upsets him, while the
Bear's face turns red.
AXKSTUNT
The fourth stunt will show the
Bear's head swelling as he wins each
game. But when he meets Stanford
his head bursts, leaving a large In
dian head. A special axe stunt has
also been planned by Rally Com
mittee.
The Stanford seal will be the sub
ject for another stunt and Tiny
Thornhiil's head will be featured in
another. There will also be a trick
about the Community Chest Drive.
Didi Vibert is being assisted with
the card stunts by Phil Clayburgh.
Virginia Sterry, and Sue Hyman.
Members and tryoutees of Pally
Committee have been working ever>
afternoon for the past week and a
half on the stunts.
