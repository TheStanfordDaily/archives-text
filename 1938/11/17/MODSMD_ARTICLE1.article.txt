rangements were made for the pow
erhouse whistle to blow in case any
further raids take place today.
TRUCKS ROLL
A fleet of trucks which started
to roll before dawn this mor»iii»g
will rumble up to the lake bed all
day long unloading their cargoes
of fuel to fill the hollow maw of the
Bonfire framework. Late this eve
ning the sixty foot tower will be
overflowing with wood and soaked
with 500 gallons of oil ready to
color the local firmament with its
seething flames.
All committees, under the co
chairmanship of Clint Olson and

group of Roble hostesses.
POLES IN PLACE

framework of the Bonfire have been
set by the Palo Alto Municipal
Power Company in the shape of an
equilateral triangle, 30 feet on a
side. Height of the tower will be
approximately 60 feet, with possibil
ity of the erection of braces and
trusses to add to the height if
enough wood is brought in. Draft
