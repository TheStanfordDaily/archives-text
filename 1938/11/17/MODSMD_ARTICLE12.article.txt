# New Gaieties Star Gets Affectionate
## 
### 
When Katrina Von Ruheswald,
scintillating new Gaieties star,
knocked a man down during re
hearsal the other evening and pro
ceeded to kiss the daylights out of
him as he lay on the floor, she was
not doing it for publicity. She was
just being friendly.
As her name implies, Katrina
boasts royal blood. Her great-great
grandfather was Emir Von Jura, in
ternational champion, the World's
Most Distinguished. But to the
Gaieties' cast she's just plain 'Trina
—a mighty cute Saint Bernard pup
with deep soulful eyes and a sunny
disposition.
In addition to acting, 'Trina goes
to school—just like the rest, of them.
At school she is working on her
CD (Companion Degree), after
which she will try to earn her CDX
-the highest degree given. School
work for Trina consists of learning
to obey commands; she's being
trained the "good old-fashioned
way." The school itself is called
"obedience school."'
Under the heavy strain of school
work and acting, 'Trina, the same
as any ordinary college girl, relies
strongly on her Coca Colas, though,
like many a campus maid (a thou
sand pardons) she greatly prefers
beer. Utterly democratic, she drinks
easily and gracefully out of a bottle.
When Katrina Von Ruheswald
leaves the Farm, it may be her last
appearance on the legitimate stage,
I according to her "manager," Chuck
j Hildcbrand. That is, if a possible
iVIGM contract can lure Ihe unpre
dictable Miss Von Ruheswald to

Hollywood.
Farm students who see 'Trim sit
ting in Hildebrand's coupe sometimes
wonder why she looks vaguely fa
miliar.

Chuck tells them they probablj
held the animal on their laps lasl
spring, when Trina was about twi
feet long instead of something like
five feet, the way she is now.
