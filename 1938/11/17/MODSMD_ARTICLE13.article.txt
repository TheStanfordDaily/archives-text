confronted Leland T. Chapin, var- j
sity coach and judge, with a prob- !

Terry.
PRAISES DEBATERS
"I feel that both sides did ex- |
ceedingly well, with a tremendous J
amount of cogent thinking and rea
soning all the way through," Chapin
remarked in announcing his deci
sion.
Whatever the outcome of the
finals, sophomores will taste victory,
as all participants are members of
that class. This situation, according
to Robert Curtiss, president of
Delta Sigma Rho, honorary debate
fraternity, is unprecedented in a
competition of this type, in which
entrants from all classes are eligible.
MellinkofT and Terry have worked
| together almost constantly since
I their advent on the Stanford foren
! sic scene nearly two years ago, and
! the combination has never been
beaten.

background similar to that of their
opponents, they have not had as

professor of speech and drama; Don
ald Paul McKclvey, instructor in the
same department, and Leland T.
Chapin, varsity debate coach.
