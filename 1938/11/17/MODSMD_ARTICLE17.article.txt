whoop it up for the Big Game with Cal. The Axe Yell and all the other
Big Game traditions will he brought out tonight as the Farm prepares
to avenge the defeats that the Golden Bear has handed out in the last

two years.
The S.C. pajamarino will be mild
and quiet in comparison to the spirit
that, the usually sedate Stanfordites

time is a charm, as the saying goes,
and Saturday will be the third time
we have met Cal since the Vow Boys
left and the defeats began.

tor, which has gained him the friend
ly enmity of Morse. It is expected
that the two rivals will have quite a
bit to say to each other.
Another big attraction at the Rally
will be the appearance of Doodles
Weaver, the mad monk of St. An
ford. Besides his immortal "Nuts to
Cal," Doodles has promised a new
number. In a letter to Jack Laney,
Rally head, Doodles scribbled, "I'll
be there. Yes, I will. Just give me
a piano. You can call me at Roble
Thursday."
THORNHILL WILL ATTEND
The two Stanford coaches will also
make their annual appearance to
night. Headman Tiny Thornhill will
make his first public campus ap
pearance of the year, and this is con
sidered good luck. Assistant Coach
Bobby Grayson, Ail-American and
"Vow Boy," will also make a short,
talk.
Laney has been assisted with plans
for the rally by Mollie West, Betly
Finch, Bob Richardson, and Paul
Slattery. Lomax Turner, head yell
king, and his assistants, Johnny
Seamans and Bill McCurdy, will be
on hand to lead the yells. The Stan-
I ford band wili march in full force
i to play all the Card songs.
President and vice-president of
Cal have been invited to attend the
rally tonight, since Cal is not having
one then. It is expected that there
will be quite a few rooters from
across the bay.
'"Firing hack the Axe!"
This will he the cry tonight as all Stanford gathers at the Pavilion to
whoop it up for the Big Game with Cal. The Axe Yell and all the other
Big Game traditions will he brought out tonight as the Farm prepares
to avenge the defeats that the Golden Bear has handed out in the last

two years.
The S.C. pajamarino will be mild
and quiet in comparison to the spirit
that, the usually sedate Stanfordites
will demonstrate tonight. The third
time is a charm, as the saying goes,
and Saturday will be the third time
we have met Cal since the Vow Boys
left and the defeats began.
MORSE TO SPEAK
Brick Morse, former Cal man now
a sports writer on the San Francisco
Chronicle, will be the headlined
speaker at the rally. Morse lias
iong been an upholder of Big Game
traditions and thinks that the spirit
of Stanford and Cal about now is
the best in the country.
Dink Templeton, Card track
coach, will be another of the speak
ers tonight. Dink has been gaining
some fame as a football prognostica
tor, which has gained him the friend
ly enmity of Morse. It is expected
that the two rivals will have quite a
bit to say to each other.
