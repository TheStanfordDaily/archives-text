## 
### 
I lobar! Young of (ho Food Research Institute spoke on "Student Re
actions to Problems of the Pacific" at yesterday's meeting of the Luncheon
Club.
Illustrating student reactions to international problems, Mr. Young
cited the case of the organisation formed by international students at
Stanford to increase understanding $

of international feeling.
In 192G the first groups of Cal, i
Stanford and Mills students gathered ;
at a conference at the Student In
stitute of Pacific Relations held at I
Thanksgiving to talk over the re- I
action to the European war. Some j
attention was paid to the Far East i
then, and the idea was that it was j
fair to talk things over.
"This Thanksgiving the students
will meet for the 13th time, but
ideas have changed. In this country
we are free to talk things over, but
in other places things cannot be dis
cussed so freely," said Mr. Young.
'"Students believe that it is demo
cratic to join the conference and I
they will gather at the Lokoya j
Mountain Lodge in Napa in dis- ]
cussion groups of small size. Mix- i
tures in these groups will be like }
the mixture in a democracy—dif- !
ferent in race, religion, and in every
way."
Mr. Young says that the purpose .
of those "glorified bull sessions" is
an opportunity for students to talk '
together with profitable and con- |
structive reactions on international j
patterne.
Reservations for the 1938 confer- j
once of the Student Institute of Pa- (
cific Relations may be made before I
November 20 by phoning George |
Alsberg, campus chairman, at Palo
Alto 3263.
