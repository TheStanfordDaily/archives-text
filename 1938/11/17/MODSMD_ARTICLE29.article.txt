# Water Poloists Stop Ken Wheeler; Win 3-2
## 
### MORRIS HENDERSON 
They stopped ihe great Ken Wheeler cold, and broke a four-year-old
jinx yesterday as the underdog Stanford varsitj water polo team, playing
their best game of the season, edged out the previously undefeated Cali
fornia squad .'{ to 2 in the Berkeley pool.
The Cards, hy virtue of this win. are tied with the Bears for the league
lead, Ihe final and deciding game to lie played in'the local tank next

Wednesday afternoon. The
Coast championship will be at stake. I
The game was very tightly played |
throughout with close guarding,
miraculous saves by both goalies,
and only clean breaks by the Stan
ford forward wall bringing scores.
Using a new offense in which Cap
tain Johnny Lamb, playing near the
side, fed the, ball to the forwards
as they broke down the opposite
side, opening the California defense, j
allowed ihe Cards to score. Harvey !
Rothschild, Jack Loupe and Bob j
Plate split scoring honors with one j
goal apiece. There were no fluke
goals to dispute the decision.
WIIEELER STOPPED
Every man on the Indian squad
starred, but chief laurels go to j
Sophomore Ted Moreno, who held I
the brilliant Wheeler, who is one >
of the greatest water polo players I
in the country, in complete check ;
throughout the game. No other j
man had been able to stop the Bear j
ace from scoring with his famous j
scoop shots this season, but Moreno, i
sticking close to him during the en- 1
tire game, stopped him cold.
Changing their Hungarian sys- !
tern of defense slightly, the Stan- \
lord water dogs started breaking !
two men in the open for clean shots !
which mystified the Bears, and only
impossible saves by the California
goalie kept the score down.
The Bears played a very good
game, good enough to win most
matches, but the Indians, playing j
better than they had ever played j
before this season, outshone them j
in almost every department to win ;
cleanly.
BREAK JINX
It was the first time that Stan
ford had defeated California in the
Berkeley pool in four years.
In a preliminary game, the fa
vored California frosh beat the j
Stanford yearlings 8 to 4 in an- '
other fast game. Perry Lamb, cap- j
tain of the frosh and brother of |
Stanford's varsity captain, Johnny. '
starred for the Bear cubs. They will j
meet again next Wednesday in the '
Stanford pool preceding the varsity !
game.

TANFORAN RACE COURSE, Nov.
1(» (UP). — Favorites scored this
afternoon when Quick Cloud, 7 to 5,
annexed the first race, and Suspen
sion, at even money, galloped home
in the second.
They stopped ihe great Ken Wheeler cold, and broke a four-year-old
jinx yesterday as the underdog Stanford varsitj water polo team, playing
their best game of the season, edged out the previously undefeated Cali
fornia squad .'{ to 2 in the Berkeley pool.
The Cards, hy virtue of this win. are tied with the Bears for the league
lead, Ihe final and deciding game to lie played in'the local tank next

Wednesday afternoon. The
Coast championship will be at stake. I
The game was very tightly played |
throughout with close guarding,
miraculous saves by both goalies,
and only clean breaks by the Stan
ford forward wall bringing scores.
Using a new offense in which Cap
tain Johnny Lamb, playing near the
side, fed the, ball to the forwards
as they broke down the opposite
side, opening the California defense, j
allowed ihe Cards to score. Harvey !
Rothschild, Jack Loupe and Bob j
Plate split scoring honors with one j
goal apiece. There were no fluke
goals to dispute the decision.
WIIEELER STOPPED
Every man on the Indian squad
starred, but chief laurels go to j
Sophomore Ted Moreno, who held I
the brilliant Wheeler, who is one >
of the greatest water polo players I
in the country, in complete check ;
throughout the game. No other j
man had been able to stop the Bear j
ace from scoring with his famous j
scoop shots this season, but Moreno, i
sticking close to him during the en- 1
tire game, stopped him cold.
Changing their Hungarian sys- !
tern of defense slightly, the Stan- \
lord water dogs started breaking !
two men in the open for clean shots !
which mystified the Bears, and only
impossible saves by the California
goalie kept the score down.
The Bears played a very good
game, good enough to win most
matches, but the Indians, playing j
better than they had ever played j
before this season, outshone them j
in almost every department to win ;
cleanly.
