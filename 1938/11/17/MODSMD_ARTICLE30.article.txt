# Cold Confines Pool in Hospital
## 'Moon' Mullin Also Out of Berkeley Tilt 
### 
Tiny Thornhill's dream of physical
perfection for the Big Game has fi
nally been shattered.
Hampton Pool, his ace left guard,
i went to the hospital yesterday with
! a badly swollen throat which com
| plicated a cold he caught up north,
j Team physicians refused to predict
| whether the blonde sensation would
be ready to go Saturday because he
: was running a temperature over a
I hundred with no signs of a let-down
J late last night.
DAKAN MAY TAKE PLACE
If Pool fails to rally today or to
! morrow, Thornhill will use Bob
J Dakan in the crucial center hole.
; Dakan played a bit of sparkling ball
against Oregon State and was a
regular before Pool switched over
from a backfield position. But Pool's
line play has improved greater than
any other man in the forward wall
i and his loss would undoubtedly
! lessen a Stanford shot at victory,
j With Pool out of the line-up, the
I California team would have to pick
! another Indian for their grudge
work. It was only yesterday that
the Bear players had intimated a
desire to "get" Pool ,a former Cal
freshman student. Pool and the rest
of the Stanford team had expressed
| the utmost glee over the prospects
lof such a battle. Now it looks like
; the two loving enemies will just
| play football unless the Indian
I guard's throat takes a turn for the
j better.
MULLIN ALSO OUT
"Moon" Mullin, one of Thornhill's
j best reserve backs, has also joined
'the sideline squad with a badly
wrenched arm. Mullin may not
even be in suit for the Bear foray.
A crew from the frosh squad, un
j der Ben Winkleman, worked the var
isity in California plays last night
[without any heavy contact work be
; ing attempted. Thornhill has ban
j ished all scrimmage sessions for
ifear of injuring one of his badly
; depleted outfit. Counting the water-
I boys and newspaper men in with
I the squad, Tiny is lucky these winter
evenings to have four full teams on
I the field.
