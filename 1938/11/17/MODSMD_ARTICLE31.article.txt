AN INTRAMURAL Big Game?
As finals in Stanford's touch
football series draw near, we begin
to wonder why intramural sports,
the kind that are played "for fun,"
don't deserve recognition along with
those that arep layed for the public.
While 50 students live and prac
tice football in the big green fence
the B.A.C. has built around them,
nearly 500 are having the time
of their lives battling it out in
Stanford's own intramural con
ference. While the varsity con
lines actual competition to Satur
day afternoons, touch teams play
nearly every day.
Curtains will be drawn on another
intramural grid season next Monday
afternoon, and some fraternity will
place a big silver football in full
view of visitors and rushees.
Sigma Chi gridders have been
working out for weeks on their
practice field (which consists of front
lawns from the Kappa house to Dean
Mary Yost's), and now they'll be
getting into shape for the finals—
may even keep training over the
Big Game week-end.
Meanwhile, last year's grid
champs, Delta Chis, having lost
Hamp Pool to the varsity, are losing
sleep over their semi-final contest
with Kappa Sigma. Victors will be
on hand Monday afternoon to scrap
with Sigma Chi for the intramural
crown, and the 1938 season will be
over.
But why stop there? Let's take
the winners up to Berkeley and find
new worlds to conquer. It may save
Stanford's gridiron face if we lose
the Big Game.

IJ U T who says we're going to lose
the Big Game? Three-to-one
odds against us would seem to cinch
a Cal victory, but you can't make
any such bets with those who really
know.
Indians have lost to teams the
Bears have beaten decisively. Gam
blers go by such results, and the
Coast conference records this year
unquestionably warrant high odds
against the Big Red Machine.
Take, for instance, the results up
in Corvallis last week-end. When
Stanford lost to a team Cal had de
feated, most people would have
picked Cal over Stanford.
. But look at the statistics. The
Oregon State Beavers gained only
108 yards against the Indians; yet
they carried the pill 243 through
the Bears. Stanford and Cal rolled
up the same amount against the
Beavers, .
Both made 16 first downs against
the Northerners, but the latter pick
ed up 15 against Cal and only 6
against Stanford.
Cards learned last week that they
do h«ve a ground attack, and they
have known for some time that they
are no mean passers. But they seem
to pass only in a pinch.
Well, the Big Game will be one
long pinch, and the Berkeley pass
defense has been shaky all season, so
let's take to the air every time the
Bears line up in their tight 6-2-2-1
ground defense. If we can't go
through them, we're a cinch to go
over their heads.
