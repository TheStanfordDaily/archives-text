southwest during Thanksgiving va
cation, Card horsemen will ride on
to the Golden Gate Park field at 2:30

some of the finest competition in this
vicinity.

Walt. Sullivan at No. 1, Steve Downey
at No. 2. Jim Fullerton (c) at No. 3,
and Bert McClintock at No. 4. This

Gilmore at No. 2, Pat Linfoot at No.
