# Card Gym Squad Ready for Bears
## 
### 
Improvement over gymnastic
squads of the past ffew years was
the key idea behind a statement
made yesterday afternoon by Ken
Edwards, instructor in gymnastics.
"We are improving rapidly, and
are certain to give the strong Cal
team stiff competition, although past
records have shown us the under
dog," he said.
Strong point of the squad is the
fact that all last year's men are back
and in excellent condition. A strong
combination of tumblers can be
found in Lomax Turner, head yell
leader, and Bill Grannis. These two
men took first and second in the Cal
meet last winter. Johnny Seamans
is a comer in tumbling.
Outstanding as all-around men are
A1 Kittell and Norm Jesberg. New
comers to the squad showing the
most promise in ability shape up
under George Mann and Bill Van
Dorn.
