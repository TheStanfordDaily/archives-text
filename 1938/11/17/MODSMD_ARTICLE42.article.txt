# Bonfire the Bear
## 
### 
STANFORD sits on a powder keg. The train
is laid from the bed of Lagunita along the
highways to Berkeley.
The torch will light in the Pavilion tonight
to the tune of "Nuts to Cal"; flaring brightly,
it will smoke over west of Roble, and the pow
der train will be lit.
Climbing the tower of oil-soaked wood that
the Frosh will have built today, it will spray
into the sky in a pyro-technic shower above the
roaring furnace below.
And the powder train will be lit, its slow
burning flames creeping over across the Bay,
with Stanford following after, walking into
the powder keg at the California Stadium.
With the sounding of the kick-off whistle
and the thump of a powerful toe against the
pigskin, the keg will blow sky high with Stan
ford riding on it.
The Big Game!
The most obvious part lasts only two hours
Saturday, while 22 men battle it out on the field.
But what happens before then, from the Rally
tonight on out, is all part of the whole thing.
This morning, while The Daily was rolling
out on the presses, the Frosh were out on
Lagunita, beginning the Bonfire. They are,
God and Rally Committee willing, still at it.
Tonight, in the Pavilion, Stanford will open
fire when the Axe Yell rocks the rafters. The
trek to the Bonfire, and the scorching blaze
that follows will be the fiery start of a Bear
hunt.
A few on the campus will not be around.
It's too high-schoolish. The Frosh are fools to
get up early and work all day. Rally Commit
tee is wasting its time. The Daily talks like an
excited school girl when it mentions Big Game.
Okay. Okay.
But nevertheless, Stanford will be out on the
Lake Bed tonight. Stanford will be filling Me
morial Hall seats to watch the Gaieties. Stan
ford will be right on the heels of the smolder
ing powder train which leads to Berkeley.
The keg is waiting.
The fuse is ready.
Tonight it will be lit with 100-foot high flames.
And Stanford blows up with the Big Game
week-end.
