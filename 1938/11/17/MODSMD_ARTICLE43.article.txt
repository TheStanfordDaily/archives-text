EDITORIALLY speaking, any mention of the
team is supposedly a tactical blunder until
precisely the day before the Big Game. Psy
chologically, one is supposed to ignore the red
stockinged squad, leaving out censure certainly,
and going light on praiseâ€”the underdog at
titude must be fostered, you know.
But the other day, one of the team members
happened to remark: "This is the game. Per
sonally, I'm going to fight."
Perhaps the statement is only one to be ex
pected before an important game. But some
how it seems more significant than usual.
It means one thing: that, as underdogs, Stan
ford is going to make its bid against the Bears
on the kind of overplay which has in the past
led to the traditional comment: "Stanford plays
better against Cal."
And, if anything, that fight Saturday will do
the trick.
It will have to.
