HUGH WILSON is coming home from Berlin,
the first American Ambassador to do so at
the request of the State Department since 1917;
and because his recall comes as the neatly
timod climax to a week of terror in the Reich,
it has significance considerably beyond that of
an ordinary diplomatic controversy —or even a
Game.
the action seems to indicate is a vir
,ual abandonment of friendly relations between
l,ie United States and Germany, at least as
far as Washington is concerned. Short of ask
ing the German Ambassador to leave this coun
ty, the Government has done all it can to
sever diplomatic contact with a nation whose
policies, external as well as internal, a free
nation cannot condone.

Behind Hugh Wilson's recall lies the bitter
ness which greeted the Munich defeat; the
nauseated anger caused by the present purge;
the rising tide of hatred for the name "Fascist,"
the symbol "Hitler," the organized insanity
which has been the Third Reich since 1933.
Possibly, also, there lies behind it a far
sighted statesmanship which sees in the present
crisis a chance to make a dramatic gesture just
before the America Republics assemble at Lima,
Peru, for the Pan-American Conference; which
feels that the gauntlet in what Carleton Beals
calls "The Coming Struggle for Latin America"
had better be thrown down now, when it can
be ratified within the month by Latin America
itself.
But whatever the reason for it, the step has
been taken, and "German-American relations"
(that vague subject Ambassador Wilson is sup
posed to be coming home to discuss) are off
with a bang on a new and sterner track.
America's action may not be altogether wise,
perhaps, but at least it's honest. We don't like
Hitler, we're strong enough so that we don't
have to like Hitler; we don't care to waste any
more time on Hitler.
Perhaps if we had reached that decision
sooner the democracies would be a little bet
ter off than they are today.—A. S. D.
