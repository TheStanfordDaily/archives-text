LET'S GET ASSOCIATED
COMMITTEE had a hard time of it last Tuesday.
It pianaged to gefover the problem of making an
aesthetic evaluation of whirling red skirts; but when
it changed gears from morals to economics, it found
itself stalled. Stanford, it was told, is supposed to have
a special program for one day at the Exposition next
year. The A.S.S.U., it was also told, has a boathouse
to support and can't afford to underwrite an exhibi
tion. The situation is badly cluttered up with budgets,
cost curves, first liens, and margins of security. But
one thing stands out like a spot on a shirt-front: If
Stanford goes on parade, the A.S.S.U. can't pay for it.
The situation is a perfect example of psychological
conflict, and the clash of positive and negative drives is
almost epic. Stanford has waited long years for a
chance to write its own publicity. Every time the city
papers have mutilated the news to make the Farm look
like a home for the feeble minded, we have squirmed
and wished for a chance to prepare an exhibit for the
defense.
# * * *
Stanford Day at the Fair is the opportunity we
want. If we could make up our own program we might
be able to convince the public that we are not proper
subjects for either a vice raid or an insanity hearing.
We could show that Stanford tampers with atoms and
snoops into the private life of the neolithic man just as
other universities do. We could offer evidence that
life at the Farm is well-behaved and orderly, instead
of a combination of the Battle of Waterloo and the
rape of the Sabine women.
But the A.S.S.U. can't afford to underwrite a Stan
ford Day. The disappointment is keen; and if we were
not. thoroughly normal and well adjusted, we would
probably all develop psychoses.
>|t * >;t *
¥>UT the fact that the Ex Committee has to work on
an end-of-the-month budget doesn't mean that we
must jettison the whole project. As Excom suggested
last Tuesday, Stanford Associates could adopt the wan
dering idea and rear it to healthy maturity.
Stanford Associates is an alumni group which at
tempts to smooth out the University's tangled rela
tions, internal and external. Publicity and exhibit is
its particular pet. And so the Stanford Day idea could
count on a good home if the Associates would take it in.
i{« >|» *
We can't, of course, leave the idea on the Associates'
doorstep in the dark of the financial night, and sneak
off hoping they'll take it in. But a few diplomatic
maneuvers might help. The Associates have been
Stanford's guardian saint in past publicity, and if we
prove the need, we can probably count on them in
this case.
The idea deserves expansion and proper develop
ment, As H. B. Lee said, "It wouldn't be worlh while
to do anything that wouldn't be worth while."

LET'S GET ASSOCIATED
COMMITTEE had a hard time of it last Tuesday.
It pianaged to gefover the problem of making an
aesthetic evaluation of whirling red skirts; but when
it changed gears from morals to economics, it found
itself stalled. Stanford, it was told, is supposed to have
a special program for one day at the Exposition next
year. The A.S.S.U., it was also told, has a boathouse
to support and can't afford to underwrite an exhibi
tion. The situation is badly cluttered up with budgets,
cost curves, first liens, and margins of security. But
one thing stands out like a spot on a shirt-front: If
Stanford goes on parade, the A.S.S.U. can't pay for it.
The situation is a perfect example of psychological
conflict, and the clash of positive and negative drives is
almost epic. Stanford has waited long years for a
chance to write its own publicity. Every time the city
papers have mutilated the news to make the Farm look
like a home for the feeble minded, we have squirmed
and wished for a chance to prepare an exhibit for the
defense.

Stanford Day at the Fair is the opportunity we
want. If we could make up our own program we might
be able to convince the public that we are not proper
subjects for either a vice raid or an insanity hearing.
We could show that Stanford tampers with atoms and
snoops into the private life of the neolithic man just as
other universities do. We could offer evidence that
life at the Farm is well-behaved and orderly, instead
of a combination of the Battle of Waterloo and the
rape of the Sabine women.
But the A.S.S.U. can't afford to underwrite a Stan
ford Day. The disappointment is keen; and if we were
not. thoroughly normal and well adjusted, we would
probably all develop psychoses.

¥>UT the fact that the Ex Committee has to work on
an end-of-the-month budget doesn't mean that we
must jettison the whole project. As Excom suggested
last Tuesday, Stanford Associates could adopt the wan
dering idea and rear it to healthy maturity.
Stanford Associates is an alumni group which at
tempts to smooth out the University's tangled rela
tions, internal and external. Publicity and exhibit is
its particular pet. And so the Stanford Day idea could
count on a good home if the Associates would take it in.

We can't, of course, leave the idea on the Associates'
doorstep in the dark of the financial night, and sneak
off hoping they'll take it in. But a few diplomatic
maneuvers might help. The Associates have been
Stanford's guardian saint in past publicity, and if we
prove the need, we can probably count on them in
this case.
The idea deserves expansion and proper develop
ment, As H. B. Lee said, "It wouldn't be worlh while
to do anything that wouldn't be worth while."
