/ \NE PROFESSOR announced an exam or some
thing in class yesterday, and the class, being highly
original, booed.
The prof vigorously, and with no little talent,
thumbed his nose at the class.
Last year in one of my classes, the class used to hiss
at the prof a lot—and the prof would hiss back. He
could out-hiss the whole class. I swear he could.
You can learn a lot of funny things at Stanford.

At a jolly-up of some sort recently, a guy bliss
fully escortcd a gal onto the dance floor, just started
to dance with her, and another guy came up and
very skillfully cut in without anyone quite realizing it
had happened.
The gal, at about the time she reached the dance
floor, had seen a friend of hers across the room. She
was busy keeping her eye on her friend while all
that cutting in business was going on, and as soon as
escort number two started dancing she subtly led
him over to her friend.
When she got there, everything was very fast and
merry for a couple of minutes, everyone was intro
duced to everyone, and the gal and her escort danced
away again.
About this time the gal looked at her escort for
the first time. Oh, she had glanced at him off and on.
but she hadn't really seen him.
And she was very shocked to find she was dancing
with escort number two. She hadn't realized there
had been more than one escort. She had even intro
duced escort number two as escort number one.
It gave her quite a start.

QVERHEARD: Some guys were walking down
toward the post office the other day arguing very
noisily about something. Suddenly you could hear one
guy quite clearly above the rest saying, "Well, even
if we can't pledge him we can still send him a house
bill."

A friend of mine who is a junior here stayed iti
j the library night before last until 10 o'clock—simply to
j hear the bell ring. In two years here, he has only
heard the bell ring once before.
He also sleeps with his socks on.
