ROGUE'S GALLERY
The Editor, Sir:
Attention Ex Committee. If I un
derstand things correctly, Stanford
is in the red in more ways than
one —also she wants non-transfer
able student body cards.
The most talked-of idea so far has
been to provide student body cards
with pictures attached —right? In my
mind a costly and ineffective meth
od, since substitution of pictures
would be possible.
In my sober judgment a far more
px-egnant thought would be to have
a file containing pictures of all stu
dents that come to Stanford. This
file could be divided into two sec
tions, each in a separate booth,
where students whose names began
with certain letters could have their
features checked against those con
tained on the pictures in the file
upon presentation of the student
body card bearing their name.

Non-Transferable
Student Body Cards
