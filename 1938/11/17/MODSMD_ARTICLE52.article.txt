# Bea Edmonds Improves On 'Our Town'
## 
### 
Beatrice Edmonds showed up at
the Farm yesterday in a reading for
the Mothers' Club of Thornton
Wilder's "Our Town." Miss Ed
monds, who pulled up her fences
from Stanlord, has been hobnobbing
with Thespis ever since. Her corn-

ment on the the
ater is spicy and
informative and
in her reading she
has all the virtu
osity with charac
ter of a high-class
diseuse.
For "Our Town"
she needed it.
Wilder's gallery of
Spoon River rubes

— our town's sweethearts and the ]
town drunk, our town's sober mar- j
ried couples and their kids — is a j
large and exacting one. That the)
whole picture was neither foggy nor ;
jumbled when she got through re- J
creating it is so much to Miss Ed- !
mond's credit.
The play itself, this year's Pulitzer j
prize winner, is written in the tempo
of a slow Yankee drawl and thread-«

Ed through with the homely doings
of its New Hampshire characters.
Sometimes "Our Town" is blandly
humorous and others, too blamed
folksy in the Ma Perkins tradition,
j Coupled with this tendency to mis
-1 take surface typicality for truth, the
play has the soil of appeal which
thaws out into just plain slush. How
| ever, it is high time modern play
j wrights stopped falling off the floor
with their dirty realism and looked
a little higher than the flop-house for j
the stuff dreams are made of. This
much Thornton Wilder does in "Our I
Town."
As Miss Edmonds aptly pointed !
out, the trend of this season's Broad
way is to boat a retreat to the hal
cyon days, to bring back mellow- j
ness and charm to the theater. And .
this play is right in line with a
wholesome trend.
