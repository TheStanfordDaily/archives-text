# Alumni Vote on Sport Scholarship at Farm
## 
### 
As Stanford football enthusiasm pyramids to Big Game height, Editor
Norrie James of (he Illustrated Review, official alumni publication, this
week directed the searchlight of public opinion on the issue of athletic
scholarships.
Asking the question, "In what form do you consider athletic scholar
ships to be advisable? For tuition only? For tuition, board, and room?"

â–ºJames received replies from over
4,000 Farm alumni.
Total vote revealed that more than
four out of every five men and
women who attended Stanford favor
scholarships for tuition only. That
is, 80 per cent of alumni are in ac
cord with the program advanced by
the Buck of the Month Club whereby
a certain number of athletic scholar
ships paying full or part, of tuition
costs are raised by the alumni
group.
Alumni attitude toward the second
question showed a strong resistance
against giving additional aid to ath
letes. More than 60 per cent con
demned scholarships that offered
athletes tuition, room, and board.
1931-1938 AGAINST
Strongest opposition to scholar
ships in any form came from the
classes of 1931 to 1938; on the other
extreme, the classes of 1911 to 1920
were wholeheartedly behind all
scholarship proposals.
Ralph "Jim" Reynolds, '09, strong
alumni leader, stated the case for
tuition, board and room scholar
ships, adding that they "eliminate
all the worry and effort which now
follows trying to make it possible
for our athletes at Stanford to sleep
warm and eat three meals a day.
"It perhaps would be more ideal
istic to stay on a tuition basis only,
but with so many other universities
giving the more comprehensive
scholarship, Stanford is placed at a
disadvantage athletically," Reynolds
continued.
Representing the attitude of those
who opposed athletic scholarships in
any form, Gregory G. Dexter, '31, of
San Francisco, said, "About the best
| way to spoil an athlete for citizen
ship Is to give him four years of
easy living or any compensation for
j athletic service, regardless of the
j form in which the compensation is
| paid.
"It is not only very unfair, but it
is rank unsportsmanship of the low
est type to have a group of paid pro
fessionals who would come to Stan
ford because they are paid to com
pete for places on Stanford team*
with men who go out for teams foi
the sheer glory and love of Stanford
and not for the financial gain in
volved."
