# Hare Talks to 'Y' At Peace Meeting
## 
### 
Speaking at a meeting of the
Pcaco Group of the "Y" yesterday,
Bill Hare, secretary of the Ameri
can Student Peace Service, ex
plained the fact that peace groups
cannot be hastily organized in times
of crisis, that they must build them
selves up gradually in order to be
effective.
According to Mr. Hare, much can
be done toward promoting peace on
American campuses. Some of the
various organs that could be uti
lized for this purpose at universi
ties like Stanford, he said, arc the
student newspaper, the radio pro
grams, discussions, debates, and bul
letin boards.
