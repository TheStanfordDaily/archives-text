Manager Henry Houser stated yes
terday that all persons wishing lo
turn in tickets must do so betorc 5

sale today and up to 12 o'clock to

able in every section of the theater,
those wishing good seats are warned
to buy them early, as none will be
held. Both performances will be
identical.
"Once you get inside the theater,
hear the songs, see the skits, and get
to hollering, it won't make any dif
ference whether it is the sun or the
â–  moon which is shining," pointed out
Director J. P. Cahn.
