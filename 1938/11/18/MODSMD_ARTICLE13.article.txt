In a statement issued by Presi- |
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur yesterday,
he suggested the spirit that should
underlie Big Game week, and the
manner in which it is hoped Stan
ford rooters will conduct them
selves during Saturday's game.
In conclusion President Wilbur ex
pressed extreme pleasure in the
team and its spirit throughout the
entire past year. The letter follows:
"Every Stanford man and woman,
old and young, feels an inner stir
ring when the days of the football
game with California come around.
No matter how involved our mental
processes, or how high our intellec
tual ideals, we want the Stanford
team to outkick, outrun and out
block the boys from California; and
we want it to show in the score
that makes the permanent record
when all of the alibis fade away.
"This loyalty and enthusiasm of
ours should not lead us to forget
that our team, our students, and all
who wear the Stanford Red, are in
the public eye. Out of it all we
want credit to come to the Stanford
we love. Our rooters should be as
fair and loyal and play as clean a
game as our team. If we can be
happy and restrained in victory and
proud and unbowed by defeat, Stan
ford will be the winner. This year
we have a team that in the face of
injuries and ill luck has stood to
gether until the pistol shot. I have
rarely been so pleased with any
group of players wearing the Card
inal."
