In a letter sent to The Daily last
night, Dean John Bunn advised that
Stanlord students should conduct
themselves in a manner which would
be a credit to our university. Wrote
Dean Bunn:
"Saturday we are the guests of
the University of California. I am
sure that we shall all want to ac
quit ourselves in a fashion that will
maintain our California-Stanford
relationship on a high plane that
will be a credit to ourselves and
our univei'sity. We can accept our
victory with modesty and forbear
ance. If we must, we can take de
feat in good grace and with a smile.
Somehow I feel that we shall win.
In any event, I hope all will act with
sufficient good sense so that our
Stanford family will be one hundred
per cent intact for school on Mon
day morning."
