# Police Warn Farm Groups Of Con-Men
## 
### 
Warning wf*s issued to all living
groups today by George Burns,
campus police officer, to be on their
guard against bunco artists, who
may in the future circulate on the
Stanford campus.
"All persons are not bona fide
students," he said, "even though
they may present a student body
card as identification when cashing
checks or carrying on monetary
transactions."
BUNCO EXAMPLE
As example, Burns mentioned a
bunco artist who, under the assumed
name of Petersen, was apprehended
recently in Oklahoma for the pass
ing of worthless checks in univer
sities in four states, including Stan
ford.
Last September, Petersen, a very
unassuming but mature man, x-eg
istered as a potential Stanford stu
dent, and presented officials with
the required check for $115. In the
meantime Petersen proceeded to the
bookstore, entered the back office,
and upon presentation of his stu
dent body card, was given $40 in
return for his check.
CASHES SECOND CHECK
Unknown to the office, he then
moved to the merchandise counter,
passed another check for $35 with
which he purchased one book. No
notice was taken of Petersen, as he
looked much like other students,
until all checks took the proverb
ial "bounce."
