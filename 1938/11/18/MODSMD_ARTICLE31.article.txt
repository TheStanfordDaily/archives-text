# Sparkling Gaieties Pace Wild Big Game Week-end
## 
### PARK KIMBALL 
Harvard has its "Hasty Pudding!
Show"; yes—and Princeton has its
famous "Triangle Show"; and this
afternoon and tonight, Stanford will
see its biggest, most hilarious, most
popular stage pageant — the Big
Game Gaieties, which will equal in
wit, originality, and ingenuity any
thing that either of the other two
celebrated shows can produce.
Since the good old days when ma
and pa were courtin' in Governor's
Lane, Stanford roughs have attended
the Gaieties to malign the Bear and
watch Farm funnymen tear the
mangy beast to pieces in scores of
ingenious ways and scatter him
from heck to luncheon over the
Gaieties stage.
This year just such a big show is
planned—on a more lavish scale
than was possible in the old assembly
hall it's true—but with the same feel
ing, the same "to hell with Cal"
spirit that characterized the Gaie
ties of old. The roughs are invited
to take over the show, to let every
one know that this is just one of
the big preparations to "bring back
the Axe."

Matinee tickets will be on sale
at A.S.S.U. office till 12 o'clock.
Box oilicc sale starts at 1:30 o'clock.
Evening performance starts at
8:15 o'clock this evening. The
matinee begins at 2 o'clock.

Guests of honor at dress rehearsal
last night were the Stanford vax-sity
football team members who are
kept from seeing the regular show
by training rules.
With such old maestros of mirth
as Marco Thorne and Bob Mallett
pulling the gags, wit and humor will
rise up and smite every funny bone
in the house. Nine songsters will
carry most of the romance. They
arc Audrey Clark, Ray Stahl, Vivian
Borrman, Bill Brigham, Pat Bernard,
Eloise Lambert, Brad Young, Hoy
Trowbridge, and—here is Stanford's
singing sweetheart again — Shirley
Jones.
BIG ORCHESTRA
Accompanied by the big 16-piece
Gaieties orchestra brought from San
Francisco, these nine songsters will
warble tender love ballads and
wacky little novelty tunes.
A tremendous addition to the mu
sical side of the Gaieties ledger has
been the inclusion of a choral back
ground to some of the featured
tunes. Sung by the glee club, the
40 voices are blended in with the
orchestral arrangements adding mel
lowness and depth of tone to the
numbers. All musical arrangements
have been made by Myron Birn
baum, known of late to his friends
as Ben Berny-baum.
Now, here are your songs and
skits—in brief:
Overture—by Birnbaum

Bleachers Blues — in which love
tackles the peanut gallery.
Faust and Last—in which the fair
name of Goethe is besmirched.
Stanford in the Rain—Gaieties ver
sion of one of the more popular
orchestras with a Birnbaum ar
rangement which is a killer. By
Bob Mallett.
MORE SKITS
Machine Age—a little bit of froth
hatched up over a couple of beers.
Suzanne—a musical "lift" by Bob
Staver — the neophyte who sold
three numbers to the show. "Sooz"
is sung in the fine baritone of Brad
Young, with the Stanford Glee
Club in on the play.
For Ever and Ever—a beautiful tune.
Soft, sweet, and sentimental like a
feather bed. By Jim Stone.
Thorne in Your Hide—Here is one
of the oldest—the best—funnymen
in Stanford. His skit is sextuplets
—six separate bits of repartee. He
ought to stop the show six times.
Tune in On Love—song title and skit.
One of the "big features." Buddy
Brown, Kent Ghirardelli, and Ray
Stahl hoof it.
Go Down to Harlem—hot jive at a
negro dive—written and executed
by "the Jeep."
AND MORE SKITS
Board and Above Board—a technical
knockdown, drag-out. A secret.
Indian Love Call—You'll be a love
sick Indian, too.
Urban—a sincerely wonderful bit of
music and acting. Tone poem by
Hank Rhoads, acting by Shirley
Jones. And a wonderful bit of
choral accompaniment.
Field and Stream — pantomime by
Dana Winters — newest comedy
"find." Aided and abetted by the
Moskovitz twins.
Last Year's Girl — the lovely, new
red-head, Audrey Clark ,singing
appropriately enough a "torch
song." Song by Sally Hyde.
Zooks—they treat their blonde part
ner awfully rough.
Moon Goes Down — another Bob
Staver tune. Eloise Lambert —
what a range she's got—sings it.
Blue Moonlight—hot hula-ing. Mu
sic by Bucky Henshaw.
Friday at the libe—it ain't neces
sarily true.
Take-offs—by Bob Mallett. Not a
S-T; just mimicry.
Trek on Down — Shirl Jones as
queen-bee of jitterbugs.
Camille—a frontier fantasy, podner.
Initiation—you can imagine. Or can
you?
The End—which there ain't no more
of.
And so be it. with this yarn.
Barracks costing $1,000,000 are to
be built in northern Ireland to house
the Royal Ulster Rifles.

Camille—a frontier fantasy, podner.
Initiation—you can imagine. Or can
you?
The End—which there ain't no more
of.
And so be it. with this yarn.
Barracks costing $1,000,000 are to
be built in northern Ireland to house
the Royal Ulster Rifles.
Harvard has its "Hasty Pudding!
Show"; yes—and Princeton has its
famous "Triangle Show"; and this
afternoon and tonight, Stanford will
see its biggest, most hilarious, most
popular stage pageant — the Big
Game Gaieties, which will equal in
wit, originality, and ingenuity any
thing that either of the other two
celebrated shows can produce.
Since the good old days when ma
and pa were courtin' in Governor's
Lane, Stanford roughs have attended
the Gaieties to malign the Bear and
watch Farm funnymen tear the
mangy beast to pieces in scores of
ingenious ways and scatter him
from heck to luncheon over the
Gaieties stage.
This year just such a big show is
planned—on a more lavish scale
than was possible in the old assembly
hall it's true—but with the same feel
ing, the same "to hell with Cal"
spirit that characterized the Gaie
ties of old. The roughs are invited
to take over the show, to let every
one know that this is just one of
the big preparations to "bring back
the Axe."

Matinee tickets will be on sale
at A.S.S.U. office till 12 o'clock.
Box oilicc sale starts at 1:30 o'clock.
Evening performance starts at
8:15 o'clock this evening. The
matinee begins at 2 o'clock.

Guests of honor at dress rehearsal
last night were the Stanford vax-sity
football team members who are
kept from seeing the regular show
by training rules.
With such old maestros of mirth
as Marco Thorne and Bob Mallett
pulling the gags, wit and humor will
rise up and smite every funny bone
in the house. Nine songsters will
carry most of the romance. They
arc Audrey Clark, Ray Stahl, Vivian
Borrman, Bill Brigham, Pat Bernard,
Eloise Lambert, Brad Young, Hoy
Trowbridge, and—here is Stanford's
singing sweetheart again — Shirley
Jones.
BIG ORCHESTRA
Accompanied by the big 16-piece
Gaieties orchestra brought from San
Francisco, these nine songsters will
warble tender love ballads and
wacky little novelty tunes.
A tremendous addition to the mu
sical side of the Gaieties ledger has
been the inclusion of a choral back
ground to some of the featured
tunes. Sung by the glee club, the
40 voices are blended in with the
orchestral arrangements adding mel
lowness and depth of tone to the
numbers. All musical arrangements
have been made by Myron Birn
baum, known of late to his friends
as Ben Berny-baum.
Now, here are your songs and
skits—in brief:
Overture—by Birnbaum

Bleachers Blues — in which love
tackles the peanut gallery.
Faust and Last—in which the fair
name of Goethe is besmirched.
Stanford in the Rain—Gaieties ver
sion of one of the more popular
orchestras with a Birnbaum ar
rangement which is a killer. By
Bob Mallett.
MORE SKITS
Machine Age—a little bit of froth
hatched up over a couple of beers.
Suzanne—a musical "lift" by Bob
Staver — the neophyte who sold
three numbers to the show. "Sooz"
is sung in the fine baritone of Brad
Young, with the Stanford Glee
Club in on the play.
For Ever and Ever—a beautiful tune.
Soft, sweet, and sentimental like a
feather bed. By Jim Stone.
Thorne in Your Hide—Here is one
of the oldest—the best—funnymen
in Stanford. His skit is sextuplets
—six separate bits of repartee. He
ought to stop the show six times.
Tune in On Love—song title and skit.
One of the "big features." Buddy
Brown, Kent Ghirardelli, and Ray
Stahl hoof it.
Go Down to Harlem—hot jive at a
negro dive—written and executed
by "the Jeep."
AND MORE SKITS
Board and Above Board—a technical
knockdown, drag-out. A secret.
Indian Love Call—You'll be a love
sick Indian, too.
Urban—a sincerely wonderful bit of
music and acting. Tone poem by
Hank Rhoads, acting by Shirley
Jones. And a wonderful bit of
choral accompaniment.
Field and Stream — pantomime by
Dana Winters — newest comedy
"find." Aided and abetted by the
Moskovitz twins.
Last Year's Girl — the lovely, new
red-head, Audrey Clark ,singing
appropriately enough a "torch
song." Song by Sally Hyde.
Zooks—they treat their blonde part
ner awfully rough.
Moon Goes Down — another Bob
Staver tune. Eloise Lambert —
what a range she's got—sings it.
Blue Moonlight—hot hula-ing. Mu
sic by Bucky Henshaw.
Friday at the libe—it ain't neces
sarily true.
Take-offs—by Bob Mallett. Not a
S-T; just mimicry.
Trek on Down — Shirl Jones as
queen-bee of jitterbugs.
Camille—a frontier fantasy, podner.

you?

Blue Moonlight—hot hula-ing. Mu
sic by Bucky Henshaw.
Friday at the libe—it ain't neces
sarily true.
Take-offs—by Bob Mallett. Not a
S-T; just mimicry.
Trek on Down — Shirl Jones as
queen-bee of jitterbugs.
Camille—a frontier fantasy, podner.
Initiation—you can imagine. Or can
you?
The End—which there ain't no more
of.
And so be it. with this yarn.
Barracks costing $1,000,000 are to
be built in northern Ireland to house
the Royal Ulster Rifles.
Harvard has its "Hasty Pudding!
Show"; yes—and Princeton has its
famous "Triangle Show"; and this
afternoon and tonight, Stanford will
see its biggest, most hilarious, most
popular stage pageant — the Big
Game Gaieties, which will equal in
wit, originality, and ingenuity any
thing that either of the other two
celebrated shows can produce.
Since the good old days when ma
and pa were courtin' in Governor's
Lane, Stanford roughs have attended
the Gaieties to malign the Bear and
watch Farm funnymen tear the
mangy beast to pieces in scores of
ingenious ways and scatter him
from heck to luncheon over the
Gaieties stage.
This year just such a big show is
planned—on a more lavish scale
than was possible in the old assembly
hall it's true—but with the same feel
ing, the same "to hell with Cal"
spirit that characterized the Gaie
ties of old. The roughs are invited
to take over the show, to let every
one know that this is just one of
the big preparations to "bring back
the Axe."

Matinee tickets will be on sale
at A.S.S.U. office till 12 o'clock.
Box oilicc sale starts at 1:30 o'clock.
Evening performance starts at
8:15 o'clock this evening. The
matinee begins at 2 o'clock.

Guests of honor at dress rehearsal
last night were the Stanford vax-sity
football team members who are
kept from seeing the regular show
by training rules.
With such old maestros of mirth
as Marco Thorne and Bob Mallett
pulling the gags, wit and humor will
rise up and smite every funny bone
in the house. Nine songsters will
carry most of the romance. They
arc Audrey Clark, Ray Stahl, Vivian
Borrman, Bill Brigham, Pat Bernard,
Eloise Lambert, Brad Young, Hoy
Trowbridge, and—here is Stanford's
singing sweetheart again — Shirley
Jones.
BIG ORCHESTRA
Accompanied by the big 16-piece
Gaieties orchestra brought from San
Francisco, these nine songsters will
warble tender love ballads and
wacky little novelty tunes.
A tremendous addition to the mu
sical side of the Gaieties ledger has
been the inclusion of a choral back
ground to some of the featured
tunes. Sung by the glee club, the
40 voices are blended in with the
orchestral arrangements adding mel
lowness and depth of tone to the
numbers. All musical arrangements
have been made by Myron Birn
baum, known of late to his friends
as Ben Berny-baum.
Now, here are your songs and
skits—in brief:
Overture—by Birnbaum

Bleachers Blues — in which love
tackles the peanut gallery.
Faust and Last—in which the fair
name of Goethe is besmirched.
Stanford in the Rain—Gaieties ver
sion of one of the more popular
orchestras with a Birnbaum ar
rangement which is a killer. By
Bob Mallett.
MORE SKITS
Machine Age—a little bit of froth
hatched up over a couple of beers.
Suzanne—a musical "lift" by Bob
Staver — the neophyte who sold
three numbers to the show. "Sooz"
is sung in the fine baritone of Brad
Young, with the Stanford Glee
Club in on the play.
For Ever and Ever—a beautiful tune.
Soft, sweet, and sentimental like a
feather bed. By Jim Stone.
Thorne in Your Hide—Here is one
of the oldest—the best—funnymen
in Stanford. His skit is sextuplets
—six separate bits of repartee. He
ought to stop the show six times.
Tune in On Love—song title and skit.
One of the "big features." Buddy
Brown, Kent Ghirardelli, and Ray
Stahl hoof it.
Go Down to Harlem—hot jive at a
negro dive—written and executed
by "the Jeep."
AND MORE SKITS
Board and Above Board—a technical
knockdown, drag-out. A secret.
Indian Love Call—You'll be a love
sick Indian, too.
Urban—a sincerely wonderful bit of
music and acting. Tone poem by
Hank Rhoads, acting by Shirley
Jones. And a wonderful bit of
choral accompaniment.
Field and Stream — pantomime by
Dana Winters — newest comedy
"find." Aided and abetted by the
Moskovitz twins.
Last Year's Girl — the lovely, new
red-head, Audrey Clark ,singing
appropriately enough a "torch
song." Song by Sally Hyde.
Zooks—they treat their blonde part
ner awfully rough.
Moon Goes Down — another Bob
Staver tune. Eloise Lambert —
what a range she's got—sings it.
Blue Moonlight—hot hula-ing. Mu
sic by Bucky Henshaw.
