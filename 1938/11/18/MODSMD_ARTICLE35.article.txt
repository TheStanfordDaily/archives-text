over Cal.
In keeping with the Big Game
spirit, the most colorful and elabo
rate card stunts of the year have
been planned by Rally Committee.
The new system of flipping each
part of every stunt, which gives the
appearance of animated pictures, will
be inaugurated tomorrow. Jack
Laney, rally head, who will give in
structions tomorrow, has asked that
all the rooters co-operate to make
the stunts successful. Since the
►Stanford section is not as large as
Cal's, it will be necessary that in
structions be followed carefully.
INSTRUCTIONS TO ROOTERS
In order that the stunts may run
smoothly tomorrow, instructions are
printed below.

Line up in straight vertical lines
behind the first row.
Men must wear white shirts and
rooters' caps.
It is absolutely necessary that men
wear white shirts and have their

without them will have to sit on
the bottom row. All men with root
ers' megaphones have been asked to
bring them to the game.
Didi Vibert, women's chairman of

the Indian chasing the Bear, till he
catches and throws him. on the

In another stunt the Bear's head
will get larger and larger as he wins
each game until he meets Stanford

Indian head.
In the short stunts, a picture of

the Stanford seal shown. There will
also be a trick about the Community

Phil Clayburg and Virginia Sterry,
have been working with Rally Com
mittee members and tryoutees for
the past two weeks on the stunts.
