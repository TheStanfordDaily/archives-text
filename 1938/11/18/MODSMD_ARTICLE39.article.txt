Jacqueline Cochran believes that
women are not fitted emotionally for
the job of piloting airliners, al
though she successfully competed
with male pilots to win the Bendix
trophy in this year's national air
races in Celvelond.
"My aviation experiences have
convinced me that women would
not make good airline pilots—we
could not stand the steady grind,"
she said.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP). —
