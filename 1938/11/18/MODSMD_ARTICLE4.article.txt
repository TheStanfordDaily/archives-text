# Rally, Execution Pyre Heat Up Bear meat Stew
## 7,000 Watch Cal Effigy Writhe As Flames Burn 250 Feet in Air 
### JACK BURTT HARRY SHELDON 
We Wiilcliol liiin hum.
It h not oltthey allow 7,(MM! wiliicHwvs at an execu
lion, hut they couliln'l keep them an ay.
OKI Man (.ill Man purged. I It* was fired to a hairless
crisp for Ins sins that have accumulated since tin* time ol
Ins questionable hirth I »y a jaundiced legislature.
And liis worst enemy, the Indian, caught up with liiin
last night.
(.aught up with him, wielded a hare axe, scalped him.
chopped him into cutlets and tossed him on the lire.
lie was too tough, too hitter to eat.
And the only reply the 7.(MX) had—Give 'cm the Axe.
So, they hitched him to a Cardinal sky-rocket and shot him back
to his friends in Berkeley for the game Saturday.
Scene of the execution was the dry bed of Lake Lagunita. His pyre,
constructed by assistant-executioners of the Class of '42, was 75 feet
high, built out of every spare and not-so-spare scrap of kindling on the
peninsula, and soaked with 500 gallons of oil.
As a salute of sky bombs heralded the lynching, frosh men touched
off the huge pile shortly before the Stanford Band marched in, not play
ing a mournful dirge, but playing a joyful funeral march.
The Hear s on Mis way to . . .
The flames ran quickly up the sides of the heap and the heat soon
gave him a good idea of where he was going.
And as he writhed, old grads, Palo Alto supporters, and the whole
tribe mentally sang unprintable words while the Band played "The
Cardinal Is Waving."
The idea was finally seeping -through the Bear's thick skull that he
wasn't going to escape alive. It looked to him like the Indians meant
business.
Two hundred and fifty feet the flames jumped—jumped into a cloud
of thick, black oil-smoke; their heat singeing the exposed tonsils of hun
dreds of spectators, who were driven back almost to the lakeshore.
Lomax Turner, Bill McCurdy and Johnny Seamans war-danced their
way to a vantage point and took charge with a Standard Oil public
address system.
From the remaining foundations of the boathouse, they whipped the
7.000 into "Come Join the Band," "Sons of the Stanford Red," five for
the lrosh, the locomotive clap yell for the first time this year, and it all
ended up with "Give 'Em the Axe."
Sky-rockets Light Funeral Pyre
Meanwhile, sky bombs and rockets, given by the Shell Oil Company
and Walter Heinecke, burst into Cardinal and white showers above the
fire.
From the top of the lakesides, the whole scene looked like what it
was—Stanford burning the Bear.
And it was Stanford doing it in a way appropriate to Farm tradition.
The Bear could h;ive been burned over a two-plate gas burner. But
Stanford put him out with a big show that the world may know it's safe
for Democracy.
It was all done to show the team the strength of Stanford support
when it goes to mop up the Bear's brethren Saturday.
It was all done to give vent to an accumulated grudge of 40 years.
It was all done to reach the mighty traditional conclusion once again
that the best way to purge the Bears is to GIVE 'EM THE AXE!

Sky-rockets Light Funeral Pyre
Meanwhile, sky bombs and rockets, given by the Shell Oil Company
and Walter Heinecke, burst into Cardinal and white showers above the
fire.
From the top of the lakesides, the whole scene looked like what it
was—Stanford burning the Bear.
And it was Stanford doing it in a way appropriate to Farm tradition.
The Bear could h;ive been burned over a two-plate gas burner. But
Stanford put him out with a big show that the world may know it's safe
for Democracy.
It was all done to show the team the strength of Stanford support
when it goes to mop up the Bear's brethren Saturday.
It was all done to give vent to an accumulated grudge of 40 years.
It was all done to reach the mighty traditional conclusion once again
that the best way to purge the Bears is to GIVE 'EM THE AXE!

So, they hitched him to a Cardinal sky-rocket and shot him back

Scene of the execution was the dry bed of Lake Lagunita. His pyre,
constructed by assistant-executioners of the Class of '42, was 75 feet
high, built out of every spare and not-so-spare scrap of kindling on the
peninsula, and soaked with 500 gallons of oil.

And as he writhed, old grads, Palo Alto supporters, and the whole

Cardinal Is Waving."
The idea was finally seeping -through the Bear's thick skull that he
wasn't going to escape alive. It looked to him like the Indians meant
business.
Two hundred and fifty feet the flames jumped—jumped into a cloud
of thick, black oil-smoke; their heat singeing the exposed tonsils of hun

Lomax Turner, Bill McCurdy and Johnny Seamans war-danced their

From the remaining foundations of the boathouse, they whipped the

ended up with "Give 'Em the Axe."
