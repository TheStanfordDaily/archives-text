BERLIN, Nov. 17 (UP).—Der An
grilT, the newspaper of Propaganda
Minister Joseph Goebbels, bitterly
assailed Mayor Fiorella La Guardia
today for establishing a Jewish po- ,
lice guard before the German Con
sulate in New York.
"La Guardia, whose fat Jewish
face is known to us by innumerable
agitations and demonstrations I
against Germany, is a person with- 1
out tact or decency," the newspaper
said.
(Editor's Note: Mayor La Guardia
is half Jewish.)
President Roosevelt's statement
Tuesday decrying the treatment of
Jews in Germany has not yet ap
peared in the German press.

President Roosevelt, it was learned i
today, will stress continental defense
as the keynote of the 76th Congress
when it convenes here in January.
