# Band Leader Backs Cards In Big Game
## 
### 
Josephy Sudy, whose orchestra is
being featured at the Sir Francis
Drake Hotel now, is one man who
is sure Stanford is going to beat Cal
tomorrow.
Sudy had an argument a few days
ago with some Cal students about
the outcome of the Big Game. Fi
nally they bet him a package of cig
arettes that Cal would win. He ac
cepted.
But that wasn't enough. Mr. Sudy
was so certain that Stanford will
win that he offered to bet every
student at Cal a package of ciga
rettes that the Bears will lose. Word
quickly got around the Berkeley
eampus and so far Sudy has had
more than 1000 takers with more
coming all the time.
That means that if things go light
tomorrow, Mr. Sudy will be 20.00C
smokes to the good; but if things g<.
wrong, Stanford looks to lose not
only the game, but one of its strong
est supporters.
