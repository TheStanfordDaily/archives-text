# Houses Put On Guard Against Burglaries
## 
### 
"Warning! Fraternities be on
guard for house robbers, especially
during Big Game week-end." It
was recommended by Gordy Davis
that unless a man is stationed at
each house during the game it would
be advisable to lock all the frater
nities," announced the Interfrater
nity Council at its last meeting.
"Members are urged to be on the
alert for the campus burglar who
has already perpetrated previous
house robberies this fall. All valu
ables should be hidden, and pre
cautions should be taken not to
leave wallets and cash lying around
in available places. The campus offi
cers will keep a sharp watch over
the week-end and fraternities are
asked to report any thefts and co
operate in every way possible."
SOLICITOUS NEED PERMIT
The Interfraternity Council also
reminded the houses of the request
of the Comptroller's office concern
ing solicitors. In the past frater
nities have been bothered somewhat
by visiting solicitors of all kinds who,
with or without invitations, have
entered the fraternities and set up

their wares. In the future all solici
tors must show a permit which the
comptrollers will issue the repre
sentatives of desirable merchants.
The council also decided to appoint
a representative for the Committee
lor the Pacific Coast School of Labor.
Any fraternity men interested should
contact their house presidents or th*
interfraternity office immediately.
EXTRA MEMBERS HELP
Mr. Warren Turner, fraternity au
ditor, *poke on finances, emphasizing
the desirability of keeping a full
number of men in the houses. He
pointed out that extra members don't
raise the fixed cost but enable the
houses to start a fund for future
rebuilding or repairs.
He also advised the desirability of
acquainting prospective pledges with
the exact financial obligation which
they would be required to face sp
that when they enter the house no
difficulties will result.
At the meeting of the Interfrater
nity Board of Control, it was an
nounced that the faculty had no
objection to signing scholarship
cards sent around by the houses if
•hey are presented at the right time
and place, which is during office
hours.
