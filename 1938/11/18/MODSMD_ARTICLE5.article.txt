### DICK DUDIMAN 
Stanford crowded into tin' Pavilion last night ami got j
ready for an appointment tomorrow to hack the head <»(T
the California Bear.
It wan the annual Itig Game Rally.
"The Cal Bear has heen fattening up for three yearn for
the kill." Dink Tcnipleton told the 4,000 rooters. "And Sat
urday he*M going to l»e slaughtered!"
Rocking the hall with their yells, rooters watched;
Doodles Weaver, the "Mad Monk," pound the piano and
yell, "Nuts to Cal!*'
"INuts to Cal!" they answered.
"•('al's a lug sinny!*' Doodles shouted.
"Cal's a big sissy!" echoed the rooters.
"Give 'em the Axe-ee-ay!" they all yelled together.
Then came the Axe yell. "Give 'em the Axe. the Axe, the Axe."
Stanford knew it was going to win. Saturday.
Blasting out with "Come Join the Band," the Stanford Band opened
the Rally as it tramped into the Pavilion followed by rooters who were
streaming in from the line of march of the parade.
Blaring trumpets and beating drums, resounding from the hardwood
floor to the sky-lighted roof, set the pace for the hour to follow, startling
Palo Allans and Paly Higii schoolers who had come early to get good seats.
Tramping in, singing their loudest, the rooters filled the stands and
crowded together on the floor. The building was packed.
Keyed up again by the Band—this time it was "Stop Bcatin' Around
the Mulberry Bush"—the Stanfordites heard a procession of speakers tell
why the Cards will win tomorrow.
Zajjar, Anderson '"Greatest Taekles*
"With the greatest pair of tackles that the Pacific Coast has ever seen
—Zagar and Anderson—Stanford will make California wish she'd never
opened her mouth about the Rose Bowl," Dink Templeton told them.
Bobby Grayson told them, "We'll make Cal pull in its ears."
Coach Tiny Thornhill, although he made no promises about tomor
row's game, was optimistic. "All the tough luck we have had this sea
son," he said, "shows that you just can't break a Stanford team's back.
"You've started something tonight that's going to take a hell of a lot
to stop," he told the rooters. "And Saturday it's up to us."
Surprise speaker of the evening was Cal's "perennial sophomore,"
Brick Morse, who played football for the Bears for years and years from
'91 on.
Telling Stanfordites the Big Game is the best athletic contest in the
world, he reminded them it is their responsibility to preserve the spirit
of friendly competition.
"We hated Stanford when I played for Cal," he said. "But among my
best friends now are those same Stanford football stars I played against."
'Wiser Choice than Santa Clara*
His parting shot was a recommendation that Stanford make a wiser
| choice than Santa Clara for its opening game in years to come.
Representing the University of California students were Allen Lindsay.
! president of the A.S.U.C., and Lora Titus, vice-president. Yell Leader Bob
[ Culver, asked by Stanford's Lomax Turner to lead a yell, asked for a
I whispered one for Cal and a loud one for Stanford.
Rooters booed and hissed when he told them he was more impressed
' by them than by the Stanford team.
Returning to the Stanford where he spent so many years, Doodles
Weaver addressed his first remarks to "students, faculty, graduates,
; members of the team, friends, children of the faculty, children of the
graduates, etc."
Dragging the microphone over to the piano, he led the 4,000 in his
traditional chant, "Nuts to Cal."
His final word was a reminder that "Stanford has never lost a game
when I was at the rally."
Then came the Axe Yell, and the 4,000 surged out of the Pavilion,
headed toward the Bonfire.
