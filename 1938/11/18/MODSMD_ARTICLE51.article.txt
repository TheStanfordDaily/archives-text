## 
### 
Stanford's Intersquad Debate
Tournament was brought to Â«< close
1 yesterday afternoon when Sherman
Mellinkoff and Sid Terry were ad
judged victors over Milton Marks
Jr. and Frank Mallory in the final
match.
As a result of their successful
presentation of the negative of the
Anglo-American question, MeUin
koff and Terry will represent Stan
ford in the debate with San Quentin
to be held in the near future. The
team will be composed of three men,
the third to be chosen within the
next week.
i Mellinkoff and Terry qualified for
the finals on the b;isis of their
showing in the semi-final round held
1 Wednesday evening when they de
' bated the affirmative of the Anglo-
American question. A proof of their
ability is the fact that with only
! overnight preparation they debated
the negative side of the same ques
i tion and won the match.
The intersquad debate tryouts
were sponsored by the honorary de
bating fraternity, Delta Sigma Rho,
and were under the supervision of
its president, Robert Curtiss. The
purpose of Delta Sig's sponsorship
was, according to Curtiss, to revital
ize the organization and restore its
, influence on the Stanford forensic
scene.
