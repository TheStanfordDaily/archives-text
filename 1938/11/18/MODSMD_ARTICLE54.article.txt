# Iturbi Slated Next On Series
## Pianist to Appear January 4th; Gorin, Jepson Due Later in Series 
### 
Jose Itnrl»i is the next artist who will appear on the 1938-39 Slan
lonl Concert Series which opened here Nov. 9 with the thrilling music of
Yehudi Meuuhiii playing his Stradivarius violin.
Though Iturbi. whose concert here will he .lan. 4, has become widely
known as one of the world's foremost conductors through his Sunday
evening broadcasts with the Fori*

Symphony Orchestra and his po
sition with the Rochester Philhar
monic, lie is first of all a pianist.
A native of Valencia in Spain,
Iturbi has been known in this coun
try only ten years, but during that
time has given more concerts here
than any other pianist except Pad
erewski. And his success here is
comparable only to that of Pad
erewski.
Devoted to Beethoven and Bach,
Iturbi has great faith in modern mu
sic. and is noted for his interpreta
tion of "Rhapsody in Blue." It is
'ui.s belief that in America we find
not only the future of music, but
the present of it.
GORIN TO SIN(; •
Appearing also on the series dur
ing winter quarter is Igor Gorin,
whose songs will be heard in Me
morial Hall March 1. Although he
is comparatively new to the concert
stage, Gorin's deep baritone has been
so sensational as to win him the
enthusiastic acclaim of music and
radio critics.
His interpretation of lusty Rus
sian ballads, several of which he
has composed himself, express his
love for his homeland, the Russian
Ukraine. Gorin learned his operatic
roles as the youthful star of the
Czechoslovakia State Opera.
Since his arrival in this country
he has been much impressed by
contemporary American music. As
a result of these • experiences and
preferences Gorin's programs always
run the gamut from grand opera
through Cossak songs to American
folk ballads. j

debut two years ago in New York j
opposite Lawrence Tibbet. When
she appeared with the Chicago
Gland Opera Company, her listen- '
ers paid her the tribute of declar- ,
ing her a successor of Mary Garden. !
Miss Jepson's life has been one I
which would substantiate the legend |
of the typical small-town girl makes i
good. Singing in a church choir, sell
ing phonograph records, and saving i
her money, she finally won a schol- j
. ship to Philadelphia's Curtis In- j
stitute. There she studied five years !
and was graduated with honors. i
She played with the Civic Opera

formances.

THE HAGUE. Nov. 17 (UP).—The |
Government. Press Service announc- i
ed today that the Netherlands would
admit only a restricted number of i
German refugees.
The announcement was made to |
correct an apparent impression
abroad that Holland had thrown j
open her border to an unlimited i
number.
Jose Itnrl»i is the next artist who will appear on the 1938-39 Slan
lonl Concert Series which opened here Nov. 9 with the thrilling music of
Yehudi Meuuhiii playing his Stradivarius violin.
Though Iturbi. whose concert here will he .lan. 4, has become widely
known as one of the world's foremost conductors through his Sunday
evening broadcasts with the Fori*

Symphony Orchestra and his po
sition with the Rochester Philhar
monic, lie is first of all a pianist.
A native of Valencia in Spain,
Iturbi has been known in this coun
try only ten years, but during that
time has given more concerts here
than any other pianist except Pad
erewski. And his success here is
comparable only to that of Pad
erewski.
Devoted to Beethoven and Bach,
Iturbi has great faith in modern mu
sic. and is noted for his interpreta
tion of "Rhapsody in Blue." It is
'ui.s belief that in America we find
not only the future of music, but
the present of it.
GORIN TO SIN(; •
Appearing also on the series dur
ing winter quarter is Igor Gorin,
whose songs will be heard in Me
morial Hall March 1. Although he
is comparatively new to the concert
stage, Gorin's deep baritone has been
so sensational as to win him the
enthusiastic acclaim of music and
radio critics.
His interpretation of lusty Rus
sian ballads, several of which he
has composed himself, express his
love for his homeland, the Russian
Ukraine. Gorin learned his operatic
roles as the youthful star of the
Czechoslovakia State Opera.
Since his arrival in this country
he has been much impressed by
contemporary American music. As
a result of these • experiences and
preferences Gorin's programs always
run the gamut from grand opera
through Cossak songs to American
folk ballads. j
