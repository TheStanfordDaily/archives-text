WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP). â€”
The United States signed historical
ly significant trade treaties with
Great Britain and Canada today in
ceremonies which link the three
countries as common foes of inter
national trade barriers and align
them against the totalitarian policy
of "self-sufficiency."
The revised treaty signed today
grants more favorable concessions to
exports of American farm, industrial
and other commodities than the
original pact which expires Decem
ber 31. according to a state depart
ment analysis tonight.
The agreement covers United
States exports valued at $80,000,000
annually, on the basis of 1937 com
merce. It broadens the present pact
to grant concessions to hundreds of
items.
"Among the major items on which
the new tariff status is improved by
the new agreement," the department
said, "may be mentioned fruits and
vegetables, fishery products, paper
products, certain manufactures of
wood, two large so-called 'basket'
groups of chemicals, numerous heavy
iron and steel products, including
tinplate, a large 'basket' group of
machinery, aircraft and engines, a
number of important textiles in
cluding warns, cloths and certain
made-up products such as weaving

apparel; also other manufactures of
cotton, silk and rayon.
"The duty on automobiles, one of
the major American products in the
Canadian market, had previously
been reduced as the result of the
'most-favored nation provision of the
1936 agreement, but the rate re
mained subject to increase by Ca
nadian legislation. The reduced
j rate is now bound against such in
!crease."
The agreements become effective
on January 1, 1939, and will run for
initial terms of three years. They
may continue in force indefinitely
! thereafter unless terminated by ei-
I ther government on six months'
I notice.
