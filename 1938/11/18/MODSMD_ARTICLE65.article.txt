# But...

LIKE Stanford right now, the editorial below
is more than a little on the hysterical side.
Notably lacking from it is the cold, calm delib
eration which supposedly governs editorial
thought and action.
In outward appearances, it, like the Rally,
the Bonfire, the Parade, and the Big Game, re
flects 44 years of tradition. And that tradition
is powerful stuff, aged in the wood as it is.
Because of it, when Big Game time rolls
around, Stanford starts rolling too, massing up
adrenalin and color that makes the weekend a
triumph of collegiana. The editorial is just an
other evidence of that collegiana.
But if it were to be Stanford's customary way
of thinking and acting, if Stanford were seri
ously considering living in the now-existing
fog of semi-hysteria, campus life would be
short, sweet, and insane. Most of Stanford,
however, takes it all as it was meant to be—
sound and fury and the most colorful week of
Stanford, but not as a major event in its life.
Stanford swings out in a blaze of carnival
spirit; but underneath it all, books, examina
tions, bank accounts, and Hitler pulse along.
And Stanford can hear that pulse; but very
few are letting it worry them —for Big Game
Weekend anyhow. They are answering to a
blood count that is considerably faster and
higher than normal.
Why not?
In the Pre-registration photolith section, The
Daily dubbed Stanford life "Swing." And Big
Game Weekend is a solo break on top of the
usual rapid staccato rhythm.
It is riding out toward high C right now, the
Indians with it.
But like Stanford, even Big Game Swing is
balanced.
It's terrific.
It's a flight into the manic state of insanity.
But it's only gloriously temporary.
It's balanced Swing.
It's the Big Game.
