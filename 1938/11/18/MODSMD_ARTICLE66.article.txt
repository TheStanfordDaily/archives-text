# The 						Show Goes On
## 
### 
AND speaking of Swing, Stanford's prize
show, Big Game Gaieties, rolls on this
afternoon and tonight. According to reports,
it will be a show about the Big Game; it will
be funny; it will have Hit Parade music; it will
toss into the ash-can the old idea that Stanford
women can't dance.
But no one pays attention to advance Gaieties
notices. No one cares about whether the show
is good or not. It's just the Gaieties, Stanford's
prize show.
And Stanford will like it even if the orches
tra is made up of four piccolos and a drum, if
the gags are from Joe Miller, the sets from
the attic.
So swing out, Gaieties.
You'll have to be hot to keep up with the
audience.
