STANFORD'S up in smoke for sure now.
It rolled down the Row behind a battery
of floats that tops any Parade yet.
It marched into the Pavilion to pack enough
energy jolts per sguare inch to blow up Stan
ford, California, and the whole Bay Region.
It streamed past the I.ibe, the Firehouse, the

Shack to Lagunita, where, like the Frosh-built
conflagration that burned higher than any for
years, it burst into flames under star-rockets
and parachute-flares, yelled the Axe Yell to
blast the hills with echoes.
Dink Templeton last night v/as right when
he gave the lie to last spring's Daily editor on
the subject of Stanford spirit. He had his proof
before him; it was in the yells all night.
It drove the Frosh into building their mam
moth Bonfire; it whipped the Band into a unit

it gathered together a Parade of Floats which
oozed down the Row in a brilliant stream.
It will flash out tomorrow on the California
gridiron to ignite the Indian squad into a fiery,
fighting machine.
Stanford's spirit is there.
