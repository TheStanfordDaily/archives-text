/ \PDINARILY it takes an experienced clairvoyant to
tell what the Stanford students are thinking about,
but this week-end no mediums need apply. The Farm
is going around in circles with the Big Game as the
center, and we can diagnose the thoughts of every
student, though we aren't even on nodding terms with
the spirits.
Freshmen stagger under loads of wood, looking
like war refugees fleeing for the border. The Gaieties
cast wanders about in a state of mind halfway between
amnesia ami melancholia, whispering lines in an intro
verted undertone. Fourth string tackles go to bed at
8 o'clock and squirm unhappily when tobacco smoke
blows their way. Mere Average Students trickle aim
lessly across the campus and congregate into groups
like the citizenry in a besieged town.

Big Game is Stanford's one great tradition, and on
it we concentrate all the enthusiasm that under other
conditions we would dissipate on senior benches, dink
hats, and class rushes. The Farm is short on certified
traditions, and we are a little sensitive about it. And
so when the legendary Big Game celebration turns
up with all its credentials in order, we give it the keys
to the campus.
A tradition is like a moustache; it takes time, care
ful cultivation, and optimistic distortion of the facts
to raise one. Stanford is still a fairly young univer
sity, and we haven't had the time to build up an
aristocracy of legendary events with good family back
grounds. It is also unfortunate that Stanford began its
career in the era of the cross index. Schools that got
under way before it was customary to embalm all
events in inter-ofiice memos can always find traditions
for themselves in the hazy period before their written
history. Stanford has an annoyingly complete record,
all in print.
A N . D so we single-shot our enthusiasm on Big Game.
Around it we have built up a structure of legends
and customs which is bomb-proofed against the as
saults of precise historians. It is our great tradition.
The Bonfire is a part of the Big Game celebra
tion. So are the raids, counter-attacks, and flank
movements that strike back and forth across the no
man's-land between here and Berkelev.
The Gaieties are joined to the Big Game in a sort
of mystic union. The plea of Big Game night is the
only assault which has ever penetrated the armor of
the lockout system.
* ij» *
The Farm may be short on wishing wells and magic
trees. We have no rivers across which Washington
threw a dollar, although there are so many such
rivers on the market, that their value is depreciated
and we could probably get one if we wanted it. We
have no corners reserved by legend for seniors, no
kissing rocks or wailing walls. But we have Big
Game.
Perhaps it's just as well to work it that way. It's
doubtful whether our constitutions could stand up
under two such traditions.

Big Game is Stanford's one great tradition, and on
it we concentrate all the enthusiasm that under other
conditions we would dissipate on senior benches, dink
hats, and class rushes. The Farm is short on certified
traditions, and we are a little sensitive about it. And
so when the legendary Big Game celebration turns
up with all its credentials in order, we give it the keys
to the campus.
A tradition is like a moustache; it takes time, care
ful cultivation, and optimistic distortion of the facts
to raise one. Stanford is still a fairly young univer
sity, and we haven't had the time to build up an
aristocracy of legendary events with good family back
grounds. It is also unfortunate that Stanford began its
career in the era of the cross index. Schools that got
under way before it was customary to embalm all
events in inter-ofiice memos can always find traditions
for themselves in the hazy period before their written
history. Stanford has an annoyingly complete record,
all in print.
A N . D so we single-shot our enthusiasm on Big Game.
Around it we have built up a structure of legends
and customs which is bomb-proofed against the as
saults of precise historians. It is our great tradition.
The Bonfire is a part of the Big Game celebra
tion. So are the raids, counter-attacks, and flank
movements that strike back and forth across the no
man's-land between here and Berkelev.
The Gaieties are joined to the Big Game in a sort
of mystic union. The plea of Big Game night is the
only assault which has ever penetrated the armor of
the lockout system.

The Farm may be short on wishing wells and magic
trees. We have no rivers across which Washington
threw a dollar, although there are so many such
rivers on the market, that their value is depreciated
and we could probably get one if we wanted it. We
have no corners reserved by legend for seniors, no
kissing rocks or wailing walls. But we have Big
Game.
Perhaps it's just as well to work it that way. It's
doubtful whether our constitutions could stand up
under two such traditions.
/ \PDINARILY it takes an experienced clairvoyant to
tell what the Stanford students are thinking about,
but this week-end no mediums need apply. The Farm
is going around in circles with the Big Game as the
center, and we can diagnose the thoughts of every
student, though we aren't even on nodding terms with
the spirits.
Freshmen stagger under loads of wood, looking
like war refugees fleeing for the border. The Gaieties
cast wanders about in a state of mind halfway between
amnesia ami melancholia, whispering lines in an intro
verted undertone. Fourth string tackles go to bed at
8 o'clock and squirm unhappily when tobacco smoke
blows their way. Mere Average Students trickle aim
