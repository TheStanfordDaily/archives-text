r r , HERE are, I have always thought, just, certain lim
ited way* of spending Big Game afternoon. You
can spend it on the 50-yard line, or you can spend it
on the 20-yard line, or you can spend it. behind the
goal-posts, or in dire cases I suppose you can spend it
home in bed with ihe pluvers or something. That, I
thought, was about the grand total of what a Stanford
man or woman could do Big Game time.
But one Farm woman has opened up a whole new
view.
"I never go to the Big Game," she says. "I just get
a bottle of wine, some cheese and crackers, and sit in
front of the radio and play solitaire and curse like
hell."
"Sometimes I don't even turn the radio on," she
adds.

Wednesday (bordering on Thursday) in the middle
of the night. I hear one of the boys on Ihe sleeping
porch of a fraternity woke several good people up by
saying, "Woo! Woo!"' in quite a loud voice several
times in his sleep, and then jumping out of bed, run
ning over to the window and yelling, "Wait for me!"
Still in his sleep, of course.
You would expect it. of Hugh Herbert.

A friend of mine was telling me the other day about
a guy who lived for two or three years in Central
Europe. It was in Italy, I believe, that he was always
getting arrested. They arrested him for everything.
His most serious offense was riding a bicycle with
out using his hands.

r years ago Wednesday night, when I was living
in Encina, everyone was sure that Cal was coming
over to burn the bonfire. They had frosh stationed at
Dumbarton Bridge, at the bonfire, everywhere.
A very funny fellow living in the room next to
mine thought it would be a very funny thing to call
up the firehouse, saying he was calling from the bridge
and that Cal was coming, so that the boys in the fire
house would ring the fire whistle, as they had planned
to do if they got word (hat Cal was coming.
So he did. And in three minutes everyone had
rushed out of Encina, getting into cars, running cross
country for the lake and bonfire.
My funny friend was standing on Encina's front
porch watching them rush out because Cal was com
ing. At first he got a big kick out of it. But in no
time at ail there were only about five of us left at
Encina, five of us who knew about the hoax, and I
could see that the whole thing was getting less and
less funny to him.
Finally he said. "My God. maybe Cal did come.
Let's go!" He picked up a piece of chair and rushed
down the steps to a car.
