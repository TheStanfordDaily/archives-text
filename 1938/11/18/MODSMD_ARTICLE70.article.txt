gineers. night they dug down
in their pockets and came up with
an endowment fund for a Stanford
geology scholarship in memory of

ford geology department.
Presentation of the scholarship

Stanford geologists and mining
engineers from all over the world

ters to "the Chief," as Professor Tol
man was called by his students. He
is a world authority on petroleum
and ore deposits and on earthquake
fault structures.
After-dinner speakers last night
