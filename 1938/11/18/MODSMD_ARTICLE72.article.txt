# Capra Amuses With Dizzy Production

• VOL' C AN'T TAKE IT WITH
YOU"
Mr. Sycamore's fireworks, which
are mistaken by the police as the
beginning of a Communist revolu
tion. set the keynote of this, the lat
est of Frank Capra's productions; it
moves at the tempo of a pin-wheel
and leaves one just about as dizzy.
Jean Arthur plays the heroine, the
one sane member of the now famous

"mad Sycamore
family." She falls
in love with her
boss, the heir to
one of the great
business houses in
New York, and
finds her love re
turned. The
course of true
love runs smooth
ly until the young

man's family comes to call on the
Sycamores. There they find the
heroine's sister practicing tours de
ballet to the accompaniment of her
husband's xylophone music. They
meet the girl's ballet master, who
proceeds to throw the visiting mag
nate to the mat, which is, in this
case, the living-room floor. The col
ored servant is sent to the comer
grocery to get an extra can of salmon
and dashes through the living
room on his errand disrupting the
conversation. The visitors are quite
unimpressed with the Sycamores.
A moral is inserted in the story,
which seemed to me quite unneces
sary, via Lionel Barrymore, who
plays a retired business man. "Why
work all your life for money when
you can find happiness in doing what
you want?" ask the authors. It is a
noble theory, but impossible in most
actual cases.
The acting is good throughout the
production, with special honors
going to Spring Byington, Donald
Meek, and Mischa Auer.
