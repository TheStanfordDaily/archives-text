# CAMPUS OPINION
## AXE WITHOUT PAUSES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Axe Yell is wonderful and
we love it dearly. We love it so
dearly, in fact, that it gripes us no
end when Yell Leader Lomax Turner
inserts not-so-sweet nothings where
pauses should be during the yell. In
our opinion, it ruins the bestest of
them all.
Here's for the pauses that refresh
during the Axe Yell. We're all for
them.
