The Editor, Sir:
We have a suggestion to make
which we believe will help Stanford,
the underdogs, win the Big Game
tomorrow. If the fourth quarter
could be played first, the third quar
ter second, and so on, we are sure
that the Stanford team would show
those Bears a thing or two. As it has
taken the eleven Indians at least
two quarters to warm up in every
game so far this season, this seems
to be the only plan that we could
use to win. How about it?
We will be rooting, watching, and
praying.

P.S.: Where can we get some pom
pons? We lost ours betting on the
S.C. game.
