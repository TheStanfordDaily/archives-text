# Gaieties Shows Campus Satire
## Staging, Individual Performance Make Annual Show a Success 
### JOHN FLAHERTY 
At last.
A Big Game Gaieties about the Big Game.
And more: a Big Game Gaieties that throughout focused a satiric spot
light on Stanford and Stanford life.
For the first time in years, the Gaieties was what it is supposed to Ik*—
a product peculiarly indigenous to Stanford, Stanford's attitude, and Big
Game week-end. Skit, after skit#

pounced upon quirks of campus life
and campus personalities, rode out
on the rails of everyone from the
administration and faculty, the B. A.
C., and The Daily, to the California
Bears.
It was Stanford's show all the way,
and Stanford licked it up; only its
extreme length prevented the audi
ence from asking for more.
P.A. SYSTEM FAULTY
Remarkable staging, clever, ex
plicit satire, an unusually high
standard of individual performance,
good orchestral support, and thor
ough direction built the show into
the best Gaieties that this writer has
seen. Only marring feature of the
show was, as usual, the public ad
dress system, which muffled voices,
made lyrics of the ample collection
ot songs total losses. Since this,
however, occurs year after year,
Stanford is probably getting used to
the irritation it causes.
From the welter of performers,
skits, songs, and production num
bers a few standouts might be list
ed—but, a complete list of superior
part of the Gaieties would extend
from here to Berkeley. Of the con
sistently fine mounting which the
skits received, those of "Tune in on
Love" (a huge stage-high-wide ra
dio), the Hawaiian "Blue Moon
light," and the background to "Urban
Nocturne" were high peaks. The lat
ter also was the outstanding musical
piece of the entire production. It's
Gershwinesque harmonies, the inte
gration of chorus and orchestra, and
the staging as a whole made it worth
remembering.
MALLETT OUTSTANDING
Bob Mallett, as he has done in
every campus performance since he!
hit Stanford, stopped the show with
his imitations, taking top honors by
a close margin from Eloise Lambert
with her monologue. Sing stars?
None standing out far above the oth
ers, but to be mentioned are Vivian
Borrmann on "Forever and Ever,"
Director J. P. Cahn on his "Go Down
lo Harlem," and Shirley Jones, mak
ing Stanford happy by returning to
sing two numbers, "Whenever I'm
with You," and "Look Out for
Love."
She, too, was responsible for the
swing dance routine which, as in the
Spring Show last year, moved out
high and wide. Noticeable was the
lack of good male voices to support
the wealth of promising women
singers.
THORN, ZOOKS STAR
But, because of the mike difficul
ties, much of the good music irr the
show was spoiled, will drift, away
simply because, not having heard it,
the audience won't remember it.
Two specialty acts, Marco Thome's
and Barbara Thrasher's pantomime,
and the Zook twins plus Rosemarie
Merrill's punch the Judy show. I
always thought that only a Zook
could lake it from a Zook, but the
little gal stood up to them like an
old hand at. the game.
CAHN GETS PLAUDITS
There is one more individual hon
or to be given, the biggest one. That
is to J. P. Cahn, director of the
show, who put the Big Game punch
into it, kept the audience hanging on
right up to the Axe Yell at the end.
And they weren't asleep then.
To him and to his staging assist
ant, Gene Callnon, goes all the credit
for the best staging that any campus
show has received.

piece of the entire production. It's
Gershwinesque harmonies, the inte
gration of chorus and orchestra, and
the staging as a whole made it worth
remembering.
MALLETT OUTSTANDING
Bob Mallett, as he has done in
every campus performance since he!
hit Stanford, stopped the show with
his imitations, taking top honors by
a close margin from Eloise Lambert
with her monologue. Sing stars?
None standing out far above the oth
ers, but to be mentioned are Vivian
Borrmann on "Forever and Ever,"
Director J. P. Cahn on his "Go Down
lo Harlem," and Shirley Jones, mak
ing Stanford happy by returning to
sing two numbers, "Whenever I'm
with You," and "Look Out for
Love."
She, too, was responsible for the
swing dance routine which, as in the
Spring Show last year, moved out
high and wide. Noticeable was the
lack of good male voices to support
the wealth of promising women
singers.
THORN, ZOOKS STAR
But, because of the mike difficul
ties, much of the good music irr the
show was spoiled, will drift, away
simply because, not having heard it,
the audience won't remember it.
Two specialty acts, Marco Thome's
and Barbara Thrasher's pantomime,
and the Zook twins plus Rosemarie
Merrill's punch the Judy show. I
always thought that only a Zook
could lake it from a Zook, but the
little gal stood up to them like an
old hand at. the game.
CAHN GETS PLAUDITS
There is one more individual hon
or to be given, the biggest one. That
is to J. P. Cahn, director of the
show, who put the Big Game punch
into it, kept the audience hanging on
right up to the Axe Yell at the end.
And they weren't asleep then.
To him and to his staging assist
ant, Gene Callnon, goes all the credit
for the best staging that any campus
show has received.
At last.
A Big Game Gaieties about the Big Game.
And more: a Big Game Gaieties that throughout focused a satiric spot
light on Stanford and Stanford life.
For the first time in years, the Gaieties was what it is supposed to Ik*—
a product peculiarly indigenous to Stanford, Stanford's attitude, and Big
Game week-end. Skit, after skit#

pounced upon quirks of campus life
and campus personalities, rode out
on the rails of everyone from the
administration and faculty, the B. A.
C., and The Daily, to the California
Bears.
It was Stanford's show all the way,
and Stanford licked it up; only its
extreme length prevented the audi
ence from asking for more.
P.A. SYSTEM FAULTY
Remarkable staging, clever, ex
plicit satire, an unusually high
standard of individual performance,
good orchestral support, and thor
ough direction built the show into
the best Gaieties that this writer has
seen. Only marring feature of the
show was, as usual, the public ad
dress system, which muffled voices,
made lyrics of the ample collection
ot songs total losses. Since this,
however, occurs year after year,
Stanford is probably getting used to
the irritation it causes.
From the welter of performers,
skits, songs, and production num
bers a few standouts might be list
ed—but, a complete list of superior
part of the Gaieties would extend
from here to Berkeley. Of the con
sistently fine mounting which the
skits received, those of "Tune in on
Love" (a huge stage-high-wide ra
dio), the Hawaiian "Blue Moon
light," and the background to "Urban
Nocturne" were high peaks. The lat
