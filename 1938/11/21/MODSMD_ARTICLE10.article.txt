# Farm's Fire-Fighters Hold Practice Drill
## 
### 
Practicing ladder and rescue
drills on the fire tower in the Cor
poration Yard, 10 members of the
Stanford Fire Department, under the
direction of Fire Marshall Robert E.
Dugan, worked out in a fire drill
last night.
The special drill supplemented the
regular Sunday afternoon practice
sessions of the local department, ac
cording to Mr. Dugan. He pointed
out the necessity of night practice
at a fire, and announced that such
drills would be held at intervals in
the future.
EXPERIENCE NEEDED
"However, no amount of practice
on fire towers can equal experience
at a fire," he said. "We are at
tempting chiefly in our practices to
give the men some idea of their
physical capabilities."
Practice drills are supplemented
by instruction in the theory of fire
fighting and in rescue work.
The Stanford department employs
16 men students, all of whom live
at the fire house. The men work in
two shifts during the day time, and
all are on call at. night.
"One of the chief features of our
department is that it makes it. pos
sible for a good many men to go
through the University each year,"
Mr. Dugan said.
BONFIRE PRAISED
Commenting on the Big Game
Bonfire last Thursday night, he
termed it. the "best, one yet." From
a standpoint of both efficiency and
economy, commending the idea of
building the bonfire in one day.
There was no waste ahd no cleaning
up afterward, he pointed out.
Fire Marshall Dugan has been
with the local department for 15
years, coming here from the San
Francisco fire department, where he
spent 18 years in service.
