The only accident on the campus
this week-end occurred when Clar

boy, turned his car over five times
and landed in a gully, according to
Campus Officer Gordy Davis.
Liles was driving a borrowed car
while drunk when his wheels
struck loose gravel on Mayfield Ave.
near Amherst and started to skid.
As he applied the brakes the car
skidded off the road and turned
over and over until it reached the
bottom of a gully. Liles escaped with
minor injuries, but the car is a
total wreck.
Highway patrol officers arrested
Liles and took him to the Palo Alto

trial on charges of driving in an in
toxicated condition.
Other than this accident, Stanford
had a very quiet week-end, ac
cording to Officer Davis. No dis
turbances or burglaries of any kind
were reported among any of the liv
ing groups.
