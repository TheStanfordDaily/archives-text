# Cheering Fans Back Fighting Cardinal Team
## Farm Rooters Show Best Football Spirit Since Vowing Sophs 
### 
A smashing, fighting, driving
team battled Cal Saturday. A roar
ing, screaming, cheering student body
backed up that team.
The Big Game of 1938 will go
down in Stanford history as one of
the greatest in 44 years of gridiron
rivalry, a game when a miraculous
ly rejuvenated team outclassed the
Boars' would-be-All-Americans.
Thirty-two hundred rooters gave
everything they had to out-yell
11,500 Cal men on the opposite side
of the Memorial Stadium, and they
did a good job of it. Stanford yells
and songs had spirit and volume
such as hasn't been heard since the
Vowing Soph era.
BAND SENSATIONAL
The band, led by Majorette Max
ine Turner, created a sensation.
Marching in elaborate formations,
forming a U.C. and an S.U., the red
coated music men confirmed the ru
mor that they have taken a new
lease on life this year.
Stanford's half-time card stunts,
directed by brisk, expert Jack Laney
went off like clock-work and were
hailed as the most original on rec
ord. A day of brililant autumn sun
light and a stadium packed to the
gills with 82,000 fans saw the Card
gridders make a joke out of the
three-to-one odds.
CAL FLAUNTS AXE
It wasn't, a down-hearted rooting
section that, watched California
flaunt the Axe in front of the stands
afterÂ»the game. It. was a section that
was proud of the fighting team that,
came twice within inches of scoring
and just missed two attempts at field
goals against what was supposed to
be one of the greatest teams in the
country.
All Saturday morning carloads of
students crossed the bay to Berke
ley to lunch at. fraternities, sorori
ties, and halls. Long before the 2
o'clock kick-off, they had settled
themselves in the stands with root
ers' caps, pom-potis, and megaphones
in place.
ROOTERS SCREAM
For 60 minutes of playing time
they screamed their throats dry;
between plays, during half-time and
time-outs they gave yells, sang
songs ,and screamed some more.
After the game most Stanford men
and women felt there was still
something to celebrate. The feeling
was especially strong in the hearts
of bettors that were given points.
And so the trek through the traffic
started to Del Monte and the City.
TRADITIONAL WEEK-END
Down at the Monterey peninsula
resort students spent the traditional
super week-end, and in San Fran
cisco hotels they jammed dance
floors and bellowed. "Come Join the
Band," whenever it was played.
L;lsI night they streamed back to
the Farm with a few shadows under
the eyes, a few hoarse voices, and a
few aching feet. It was the Big
Game.
