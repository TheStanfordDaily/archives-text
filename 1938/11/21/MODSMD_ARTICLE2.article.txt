# Activity Cards Carefully Filed
## Students' Records Available to Public 
### 
Student activity cards for both
men and women are being cross-in
dcxed according to interests profess
ed, and organization of the filing
system is drawing to completion, ac
cording to Harry Horton and Mary
Elizabeth Sladen, managers of men's
and women's files.
The women's files arc open for
use in Room 15 of Old Union, and
committee chairmen have been
availing themselves of the opportu
nity to pick students for various
duties. The Red Cross ,the Y.W.C.A.,
and the Conference sub-committee
for social regulation have also made
use of the files this quarter.
OPEN FOR PUBLIC
Miss Sladen announced that the
files were open for use at any time,
but recommended that an appoint
ment for their use be secured.
Freshman cards arc still being
turned in to the men's files commit
tee, according to Art Gore, assistant
to Horton. The files arc nearly com
pleted, he said, but organization is
still being carried through.
The men's files are available for
use during regular office hours, and
Gore said he would be in the office
from 4 to 5 o'clock on Mondays,
Tuesdays, and Thursdays.
The Pre-reg committee made use
of the files, and is expected t.o turn
in a report on the men they picked
from the files. "This should give us
some idea of the efficiency of the
filing system, which is a new thing
this year," Gore said.
RECENTLY ORGANIZED
Preliminary work on the files was
started last, years, according to Gore,
but they have not been completely
organized until this quarter, Names
are filed under a cross-indexed
catalogue of interests, and are de
signed to be of help to heads of
committees and others who want
students for various activities.
