# One Quick Thrust Beats Indian Team
## Bear Toss Pass in Final Quarter To Down Cardinals 6-0 in Big Game 
### ARCH JENKINS 
There still i.sn't any Stanford Axe in the Union showcase because the
goddess of chance was again playing football for California in the Big
Game.
The Thornhill Indians dominated play for 55 minutes and had the
Hose Bowl-conscious Bears in a complete state of jitters all the way.

Stanford lost 6 to 0 on an early
fourth quarter touchdown pass from
Vic Botlari to Angelo RegLnato, the
two especial favorites of the preju
diced goddess.
BEARS LUCKY
Now that it's Monday again and
the luckless Cards begin work for
their finale with Dartmouth on Sat
urday, the general opinion has been
formed that California couldn't turn
the trick again if they had a half
dozen shots at it. There were four
factors or breaks that gave the Bears
their chance at the $100,000 Bowl
endowment fund. Try to picture what
the outcome would have been with
out these factors:
1. Fumbles. The goddess rode with
the Bears when Pete Fay fumbled
on the three yard line and Califor
nia recovered for a scoreless touch
back in the end zone. And she whs
still in the driver's seat when Fred
die Ledeboer fumbled and Cal re
covered on the Indan 27 after the
Bears' only threat had been stymied.
From there on in, they scored in
three simple plays.
POOR STRATEGY
2. Goal-line qua iter backing. First
and ten on the Bear two-yard line.
Four downs for 6 feet; still the In
dians couldn't make it. Thornhill
substituted the light, tired Fay for
Hugh Gallarneau, heavy and power
ful, apparently in an attemtp to draw
out the Bear linemen for an end
sweep. But the Bears had raised
their line ante from five to nine.
I 1 ay couldn't, have gotten through the
middle in a month of Big Games.
Had the call been for Fay on an
end run or deep ofT tackle, or for
Norm Standlee, in the midst of his
finest game, through guard, it does
n't seem possible that the old show
case would still be axeless. Standlee
can hit his own guard square in the
middle of the back and still average
over two yards.
3. Pass interceptions. Bill Paul
tnan unfortunately injured the all
important guiding thumb on his
right hand in the second half and
Ledeboer didn t throw once during
•he game because of an injured
.shoulder. Nominally, these two
backs are the best pair of flingers In
the conference and wouldn't have
misshot. one in a dozen. Paulman
and Glenn Hamilton, dropped five
into Cal defensive arms Saturday.
SECOND STRING
4. Stub Allison's second-half strat
cSy- Allison started his second string
in the third quarter while Thornhill
used Ihe same eleven who were in
the stalling line-up. When Thorn
hill had to pull out. live linemen in
that period to give them more rest
and put them on a physical par with
the Bear top team, Allison. thi'ew
Bottari and his other starters at. tin
green Stanford seconds.
This put Thornhill in a nice kettle
of something or other because he
had to sit back and watch the pa
rade go by with men like Hamp
Pool, Corky Donahue, Stan Ander
sen, and Pete Zagat- loitering on the
| grass in wait for the fourth quarter,
