# Blind Man, Dog Miss Big Game; Walk to Paly
## Stanford Landmarks Guide Bella, Hanker On Campus Journeys 
### KAY JOHNSEN 
Stanford migrated over to Berke
ley Saturday, but Bella stayed at
home with F. C. Hanker, her blind
master, and took a walk down to
Palo Alto and back and then went
for an auto ride in the afternoon.
She is a German shepherd—one cff
the 500 Seeing Eye dogs scattered
throughout the United States. Bella
came to Stanford a few weeks ago
and lives at Kingscote with Mr.
Hanker, a Pittsburgh engineer, and
his wife.
FINDS LANDMARKS
After his arrival at Stanford, Mr.
Hanker had to learn the general
layout of the campus and then find
a few landmarks so that he could
give the dog directions.
'I must have landmarks that I
can feel — especially curbs," re
marked Mr. Hanker, "and that was
the great difficulty—there are so few
such landmarks here."
Bella understands such commands
as "right," "left," "forward," etc.
After going over a certain route a
number of times the dog has a tend
ency to go that way.
FOUR-YEAR COURSE
"But," continued Mr. Hanker, "I
prefer that she should not learn any
path, because then there is dif
ficulty involved in making her go in
a different direction."
Like other Seeing Eye dogs, she
has had a four-year course of
preparation, a three-months course
of schooling and a last month of
instruction with her master. She
knows when to obey and when to
disobey as well as how to guide; I
she obeys her master's commands in
order to lead him to places he wants
to go, she disobeys when obedience
would get her master in trouble—
she is more than a mere "yes" dog.
Bella has never figured in any
sensational rescue, but she has never
let her master get into anything like
that, according to Mr. Hanker.
Bella's harness is her uniform of
duty. When she is out of her
harness she chases cats, like any
other dog.
Once when Bella was in harness
leading her master down the street
he felt a sudden, slight jerk, but
nothing happened. It seems that at
Ihe moment they had passed a house
where a cat was sitting on the steps.
The canine instinct had faintly stir
red. But training quickly triumphed.
