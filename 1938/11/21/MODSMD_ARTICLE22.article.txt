# RANCHER DISCOVERS HUGE CAVERN
## 
### 

A SHEEP RANCHER, curious about a hole on a mountain-side near Carlsbad, N.M., led to the dis
covery of a magnificent limestone cavern, with one vaulted chamber more than three miles long, and
a ceiling so high that it could not be seen. Upper left is a queen almond-shaped limestone formation
tinted a delicate pink, found in the "tear-drop room." Upper right is a fluted pillar .18 feet in diameter,
more than 60 feet tall. Bottom are limestone deposits, thousands of years in the making, that startling
ly resemble Christmas trees, in the "Christmas tree" room.
