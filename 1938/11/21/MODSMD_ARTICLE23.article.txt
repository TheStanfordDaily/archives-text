# F.D.R. Heads South To Confer With Solons

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (UP). â€”President Roosevelt left for Warm
Springs, Ga., late today to spend Thanksgiving and later meet with his
congressional leaders in sessions which mav chart the New Deal along a
j more conservative course or swing it further to the left. Mrs. Roosevelt
accompanied him.
Every year the chief executive carves turkey for infantile paralysis
victims at the famous Warm Springs Foundation, but seldom does he rally

his ace strategists so iur away from<
home. Sharp Republican gains in
the recent congressional elections
were the apparent reason and he
was expected to take stock of what
the administration will be up
against.
SHIFT SEEN
When the election results were
announced Mr. Roosevelt refused to
see them as a body-blow to New
Deal liberalism. He said as much
at a press conference. But some of
1 his politically astute lieutenants saw
a definite shift to the right. They
think plans for future reform legis
lation should be shelved and Mr.
Roosevelt should consolidate his
forces for an inevitable battle
against a potentially strong con
servative Democratic - Republican
coalition.
In this connection one of his con
ferees will be House Majority Lead
! er Sam Rayburn (D., Tex.), who is
expected to indicate the future atti
tude of Vice-President John N.
Garner. Garner differed with the
President last session over New
Deal reforms and subsequently his
office became the rallying point for
anti-New Deal Democrats who
want him to run for president.
MAY LOSE GARNER
Observers believe the President's
chances for recapturing support of
conservatives, including Garner, are
nil if he persists in his reform pro

j
! gram. If he charts a too conserva
tive course he may lose his liberal
support. If he steers a middle course,
they say, he may be able to effect a
' consolidation that would frustrate
any attempt at a formidable coa
j lition.
