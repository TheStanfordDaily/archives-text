## SWING THE CLASSICS? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Once in a great while one wishes
to listen to and attempt to appreciate
music. Even if these moments come
while the listener is knotting a
broken shoe lace or driving the last
coffin nail they are something to set
daily high points by.
Probably once in a quarter one
wishes to listen to a song or melody
with a legend, an event, or the life
of a race and nation behind it. Such
tunes have distinctive features
which are as much their own as the
keys on a typewriter, or the middle
valve on the trumpet.
Isn't it a trifle disconcerting to
settle for a few moments ol "Swa
nee River," "Silver Threads Among
the Gold," "Maggie," or "Humor
esque" and hear it swung, vivisect
ed, and raped by an assemblage of
drums and horns? No, I am not a
simon-pure aesthete who cannot
listen to anything less exalted than
an organ; I am fond of the "Koo
doodlers," and I like swing as such.
If all broadcasting must cater to
popular demand, can't the directors
find enough new blats and tinkles
without invading established music?
An old melody must have been good
to survive. Can't someone save these
tunes with the heart of a region, a
person, a composer beating within
them from the blatting, pounding,
squalling, and plunking of appren
tice piano-tuners?
