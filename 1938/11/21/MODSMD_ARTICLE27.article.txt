# Explosion Stops Joplin Power
## Missouri Town Dark After Mystery Blast 
### 
JOPLIN, Mo., Nov. 20 (UP). â€”
Three men were sought tonight in
the dynamiting early today of a
power company sub-station which
was wrecked by two terrific explo
sions, cutting off the power supply
of Joplin and five neighborhood
towns for several hours.
The three were seen dashing away
from the plant five minutes before
the first explosion occurred. They
fled in a waiting automobile.
J. E. Harsh, general manager of
the Empire District Power Com
the explosion, saying: "We are re
pany, issued a statement soon after
luctant ot believe labor trouble was
responsible for the act." He of
fered a $5,000 reward for capture of
those responsible.
The company was involved in a
minor labor dispute last spring.
Prosecuting Attorney Roy Coyne
at once began an investigation of
the blast and said "there is no ques
tion but there was a deliberate at
tempt ot blow up the sub-station."
Police and highway patrolmen
joined in the hunt for the suspects,
described to them by Mr. W. O. Bar
rett, whose home was next to the
sub-station in downtown Joplin.
The explosions occurred shortly
after 12:30 a.m. Coyne said the dy
namite evidently was placed beneath
one of the transformers by someone
who cut through the wire gate to
the plant.
Oil pouring from the blasted
transformers burst into flames and
ignited Mrs. Barrett's house.
