## Touch-Football Reaches Finals Two Teams to Battle at 4 o'clock For 10-year-old Mural Trophy 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
With the Stanford-Cal game off I lie sports ledger, a new source of j
"Big Game" spirit flares on the Farm tliis afternoon in the* 1!»:>S intra- !
mural touch-football championship.
For the better part of an hour, starting at 4 o'clock, two of the best '
seven-man grid outfits ever to be produced by the Row, Delta Chi and

Sigma Chi, will lash out with all<
their pent-up fury for Stanford's in
tramural supremacy.
There'll be no love lost between
the two highly-powered clubs when
they get together on Field II for the
title play-off. Both will be out to
get their second legs on the now 10-
year-old intramural trophy.
SWAMP PIII DELTS
Delta Chi, holder of the cup for
the past 12 months, swamped Phi
Delta Theta, 9-0, to gain control,
rolling to victory on the strong run
ning and passing of Hampton Pool of
the present Indian grid varsity.
Sigma Chi will be after its second
leg, having moved into the finals in
1930 against Delta Tau Delta. The
Delts won the match with an ineli
gible player, thereby giving Sigma
Chi a co-championship. Phi Kappa
Sigma, with championship clubs in
'29 and '32, can gain permanent pos
session of the trophy with another
victory in the finals.
The finalists this afternoon will put
on a display of polished passing and
running attacks, which functioned
with amazing superiority during the
league season. Both outfits went
through their respective leagues with
unblemished records, piling up con
vincing margins over every team
met.
WIN FOUR GAMES
Delta Chi took League IV in stride,
knocking over four opponents by
margins of more than four touch
downs in each game, and then crash
ed through the Breakers for a 19-0
triumph and Kappa Sigma, 13-0, in
play-off games last week.
Pitted against no soft touches in
League IX, Sigma Chi came through
with four loop victories, and then
made off with twin play-off victories
over the Fijis, 21-0. and Phi Psi 11,
12-0, last week.
With an effective passing attack
which has accounted for more than
half of their scores, Delta Chi will
hold a slight pre-game edge; but
Sigma Chi is expected to take to
the air also with an equally dan
gerous aerial bombardment which
has more than held its own all year.
MAINSTAYS
Spearheads of Delta Chi's attack
will be Sully Sullivan and Jack
Laney, who will alternate in the
tail-back positions, running or pass
ing the porkhide. Sullivan will take
care of all the punting, while Laney
will again be the team's ace place
ment kicker for extra points and
kickoffs.
Herb Bull, Charles Mclntyre,
Stan Parker, Chet Smith, and Fred
die Baker will take over the remain
ing posts in Delta Chi's line-up.
Working out plays for Sigma Chi
will be Leo Feder and Jack Top
ham, who will take care of the run
ning and passing, respectively. Ed
Collom, the third man in the back
field, rates as one of the best pass
snaggers in the intramural business
and will be a marked man. On the
forward wall Dick Neeley, Bill
Martin, A1 Bardin, and Bill Leckie
will form the bulwark against Delta
Chi's line smashes and end sweeps.

mural touch-football championship.
For the better part of an hour, starting at 4 o'clock, two of the best '
seven-man grid outfits ever to be produced by the Row, Delta Chi and

Sigma Chi, will lash out with all<
their pent-up fury for Stanford's in
tramural supremacy.
There'll be no love lost between
the two highly-powered clubs when
they get together on Field II for the
title play-off. Both will be out to
get their second legs on the now 10-
year-old intramural trophy.
SWAMP PIII DELTS
Delta Chi, holder of the cup for
the past 12 months, swamped Phi
Delta Theta, 9-0, to gain control,
rolling to victory on the strong run
ning and passing of Hampton Pool of
the present Indian grid varsity.
Sigma Chi will be after its second
leg, having moved into the finals in
1930 against Delta Tau Delta. The
Delts won the match with an ineli
gible player, thereby giving Sigma
Chi a co-championship. Phi Kappa
Sigma, with championship clubs in
'29 and '32, can gain permanent pos
session of the trophy with another
victory in the finals.
The finalists this afternoon will put
on a display of polished passing and
running attacks, which functioned
with amazing superiority during the
league season. Both outfits went
through their respective leagues with
unblemished records, piling up con
vincing margins over every team
met.
WIN FOUR GAMES
Delta Chi took League IV in stride,
knocking over four opponents by
margins of more than four touch
downs in each game, and then crash
ed through the Breakers for a 19-0
triumph and Kappa Sigma, 13-0, in
play-off games last week.
Pitted against no soft touches in
League IX, Sigma Chi came through
with four loop victories, and then
made off with twin play-off victories
over the Fijis, 21-0. and Phi Psi 11,
12-0, last week.
With an effective passing attack
which has accounted for more than
half of their scores, Delta Chi will
hold a slight pre-game edge; but
Sigma Chi is expected to take to
the air also with an equally dan
gerous aerial bombardment which
has more than held its own all year.
MAINSTAYS
Spearheads of Delta Chi's attack
will be Sully Sullivan and Jack
Laney, who will alternate in the
tail-back positions, running or pass
ing the porkhide. Sullivan will take
care of all the punting, while Laney
will again be the team's ace place
ment kicker for extra points and
kickoffs.
Herb Bull, Charles Mclntyre,
Stan Parker, Chet Smith, and Fred
die Baker will take over the remain
ing posts in Delta Chi's line-up.
Working out plays for Sigma Chi
will be Leo Feder and Jack Top
ham, who will take care of the run
ning and passing, respectively. Ed
Collom, the third man in the back
field, rates as one of the best pass
snaggers in the intramural business
and will be a marked man. On the
forward wall Dick Neeley, Bill
Martin, A1 Bardin, and Bill Leckie
will form the bulwark against Delta
Chi's line smashes and end sweeps.
