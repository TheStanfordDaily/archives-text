# Varsity, Frosh Soccer Teams Lose to Dears
## Third-quarter Rally By Card Squad Fails; Papoose Game Close 
### 
Slipping behind, after a desperate j
third quarter rally barely failed to ;
knot the score, the Stanford varsity j
soccer team lost a 4-1 decision to
the California Bears Saturday morn- j
ing on the Berkeley field.
Not to be outdone by their upper
classmen brothers, the Blue 'n Gold
lrosh flashed a combination of speed
j and luck to defeat the Papoose soccer ;
aggregation by an identical score on
i the Cub field.
Featuring a set of strong fullbacks, !
and a strong forward line, the Ber- !
J keley varsity squad carried the of
! fensive to the Indian goal during
most of the first half, were set on
j their heels during the third period,
; and came back strong in the last
j quarter.
Starting for the Cards, a squad
"B" line-up played the entire first
j half, left the field with the score 2-1
! against them. The Indian goal came i
i in the dying minutes of the quarter
| when Ed Rogers, given a penalty
| shot from close in, boomed a fast
I kick into the net for the only Stan
ford goal against California this
season.
Opening the second half by inject
ing his varsity line-up into the
game, Coach Harry Maloney was
cost the services of ace offensive man
Gunther Gerbstedt early in the pe
riod, when a scramble put Gei'bstedt j
on the sidelines with an injury.
Carrying the ball to the Cal goal j
during the first half of the third pe
riod, the Card squad was denied |
j tieing and winning scores by unfor- ;
I tunate shooting and fine Bear saves, j
The Berkeley forward wall came
| to life late in the third period, and j
marched down the field on two j
I quick drives that netted them their j
I two final scores.
Faced with a bumpy field, the j
j Card frosh dropped a game that was |
j much closer than a 4-1 score would !
| indicate. Showing great improve- j
; ment both on offense and defense j
I over the first Cal game last week, j
j the Papooses missed points on j
I heart-breaking shots.
Centering their attack on the same \
| two fast wingmen who have been j
I their scoring threats all season, the
| Cal Cubs put one across in the first j
! period, another in the second, and j
I two more in the third. The Card!
| frosh were saved a whitewash when
late in the first quarter Captain Fred
"Nick" Bills pounded the day's final
! goal through the posts.
