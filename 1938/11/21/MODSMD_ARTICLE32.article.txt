Yy HAT a team!
Regrets that there is still no
chromium-plated axe in the Union
trophy case should be completely
overshadowed on the Stanford cam
pus today by tear-jerking pride in
eleven men who went up to Berke
ley Saturday and showed the world
that determination and a comeback
spirit ai'e worth a million victories.
And every man who added red
tinge to the Berkeley gridiron
played good ball. For all-around
grid talent no four men in the All-
American roster could have belit
tled Tony Calvelli, Hamp Pool, Pete
Zagar, and Bill Paulman. And if de
mand rises for speed or line back
ing, you could sell Pete Fay and Jack
Clark or Norm Standlee, respective
ly, for their weight in gold.

pR()WMN(« always on Sunday
morning; quarterbacking, The
Daily today slaps itself on the
back for calling the signals on
Friday.
Predictions written here then
could almost be printed today as a
write-up of the Big Game. Our
greatest concern was with Cal's
five-man line. We said it would
n't work for certain reasons, and
it didn't—for just those reasons.
It was fnrthcr predicted that if
the Cards got in a spot for a goal
line drive the Bears would go back
to their (i-2-2-1 formation and
could be pierced only by tossing
the ball over their heads or by
packing the ball through the cen
ter in the arms of Norm Standlec,
who can bow any line a yard or
two. without blocking, if neces
sary. Neither was done when the
whole defense was in the end
zone, nor did the Cards score.
However, it is not questioned
that a team that held the Tro
jans to downs on the one-foot line
would seem to be better attacked
off tackle. And if it had worked,
people would today be praising
the strategy. For as Assistant
Coach Ben YYinkclman has ex
plained this common situation.
"Nothing succeeds like success."
