# Card Poloists Defeated 4-0
## Team to Go South On Trip Tomorrow 
### 
Playing its last game before the j
scheduled trip to Arizona and Texas
next week, the Stanford polo team '
was defeated by the San Francisco I
All-Stars of San Mateo 4-0 at Golden
Gate Park yesterday afternoon. The i
game was witnessed by the largest
crowd of the year.
"According to the difference in '
handicap, we should have been al
lowed five goals at the opening of
the game," said Major Allen, coach j
of the team. "However, they refused
to allow them to us, and since the j
team needed the practice for the trip j
next week, we agreed to play. If i
this handicap had been granted, we ,
would have won the game."
Major Allen expressed his satis
faction with the playing of the |
team, saying that Stanford played j
"very good ball throughout the
game." Steve Downey and Jim
Fullerton were especially outstand
ing.
Tomorrow the team will leave on '
an 8-day trip south, where they '
will play the University of Arizona !
and several other teams. They will I
arrive back on Wednesday of next
week, and on the same day are I
scheduled to meet the University of!
Utah at Stanford.
