# MAYOR HELPS ANGLERS
## 
### 
Port Arthur's mayor likes to fish, i
so when he heard the speckled trout
in Lake Sabine were biting fur
iously he proclaimed that the draw- !
bridge between the city and the lake 1
should be closed an hour earlier and
kept so until the "specs" stopped â€¢
biting. He hoped the anglers could
get to their holes just that much
sooner.
