# Back in Harness

BY this time, the last colored rooters' card
will have been swept up out of Berkeley's
stadium by the long-suffering Grounds Crew.
Sports sections of the city papers will have
turned their columns to deciding the Rose
Bowl team choice. Garages will be working
overtime repairing bashed fenders.
Throats will begin to lose their harshness,
rooters' caps will be put back into the moth
balls in readiness for the Dartmouth game. And
Stanford will languidly pick up where it left
off.
The Big Game pageant is over.
Now, if Max Reinhardt were staging the
whole carnival, audiences conveniently re
moved on some high peak to watch would
call it the greatest spectacle since Nero packed
them in to watch some Christian baiting. Not
a cue was missed, the cast performed perfectly,
the costuming used every possible shade of
red, blue, and gold, meteorological lighting
was superb. It was a great show.
In fact, so great was the final scene in the
stadium Saturday afternoon that anything said
afterwards is an obvious anti-climax. What
is there to say except that Stanford's team made
one of the greatest exhibition of fighting de
termination, of brilliantly spirited drive, and of
sheer football? After a season of hard luck and
injuries, it was little short of unholy. The words
"moral victory" have been worked to death;
but tattered by misuse as the phrase is, it
fits here.
No tears are being shed because the Indians
were jinxed by the third 6-0 score. The game
they played before the gun sounded so colors
the final figures that they stand out red instead
of blue and gold.
California won; all credit to them for push
nig through.
But, unlike most games California takes from
Stanford, the Farm is not sad.
For once, there is no football hangover.
