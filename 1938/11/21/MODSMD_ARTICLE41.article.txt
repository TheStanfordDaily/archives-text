# Spiritual Aid to Athletes
## 
### 
THE Stanford Illustrated Review last month
dusted off the lens of its spotlight, focused it,
and brought to light a curious trend. Accord
ing to statistics which it gathered from an
alumni poll, classes of the last 10 years showed
the strongest opposition of all graduate groups
to athletic scholarships of any kind.
And directly opposing, the earlier classes
from 1911 to 1920 were strongest in favor of
any, all, and more aid.
Besides pointing out the trend away from
scholarship aid, the survey also explains one
thing—the constant alumni hammering at Stan
ford for not offering more financial help to its
athletes. According to them, the lack of "gravy
jobs," free and easy qualifications for abundant
scholarship funds, and the high entrance stand
ards are directly respopnsible for the last three
years of Stanford's victory famine. And in
that famine, they see the whole University
dragged down, grass growing in the streets
(but not the Inned Quad), and the red tiles peel
ing from the roofs.
If Stanford is to hold up her head in the
proud fashion that the older alumni dream it did
in their day, Stanford must retrench, forget edu
cational standards, devote funds and energy
to building up its football squad—so their tale
runs.
But one thing, in all this head-shaking the
orizing, the older alumni seem to forget: that,
even in their day, the campus as a whole did
no more to suppoprt the team that represents
it, yelled no harder at the Big Game, turned out
in no greater numbers for the Rally than it
does now. And that, even more important,
Stanford survived longer and dryer famines
than this one—and turned out the "Vowing
Sophs." But at the same time the remission of
entrance standards, the addition of financial aid,
the abundance of "gravy jobs" have increased
only to an insignificant degree, if at all.
They forget that in their days, Stanford prob
ably won no more games than it does now.
And yet, in spite of that, their undergraduate
spirit was not dampened; in fact, their very con
cern and often misguided enthusiasm now
shows that the spirit they had then was strong
enough to last a long, long time.

Still, in the face of their own loyalty which
was implanted then, and in the face of the en
thusiasm which made this Big Game the col
legiate Bacchanal that it was, they say that
Stanford teams and Stanford spirit are doomed
unless the University forgets completely its
status as an amateur.
After the game Saturday it should be ob
vious that there is something wrong in their
theory of the relation between financial aid
and team and campus spirit.
Athletic aid didn't make Stanford play as it
did then, nor the rooting section go mad for
two solid hours. And more athletic aid wouldn't
bring about the same spirit again or oftener.
It's not what Stanford needs to repeat the en
thusiasm game after game.
It just needs more Big Games.
