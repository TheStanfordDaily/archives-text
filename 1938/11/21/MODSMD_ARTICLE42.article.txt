# BULL SESSION
## HERE COME THE BRITISH 
### JOHN COBBS 
IF WE want a complete explanation of the battle that
stormed around Stanford's drum majorette last
week, we will probably have to wait until somebody
writes his memoirs. But one thing stands out clearly
against the background of "hasty" actions and parlia
mentary sabre-rattling. The Band, Stanford's sup
pressed minority, suddenly became the patriotic de
fender of liberty. Even the embattled farmers of Lex
ington and Concord couldn't have done a better job of
quick change in character.
Ordinarily the students regard the Band as a sort
of step-child of the B.A.C. They accept it with con
descending tolerance when it is on key, and pelt it
with sarcastic comment whenever the saxes and the
French horns have a difference of opinion.
But last, week the Band did an about-face in
morale, and did it with military precision. When
Women's Conference informed them that it consid
ered drum majorettes as conduct unbecoming, the
Band members acted with the speed and courage of
Minute Men. They told Conference that if the drum
majorette were censored, the Band would go on strike.
If Trilby had suddenly slapped Svengali's face, he
would not have been more surprised than Stanford
was.
I might explain here that I have nothing but the
greatest respect and admiration for Women's Confer
ence as an aggregation of individuals. The members
that I know are all very swefet and charming girls.
But as an organization, Women's Conference has an
unfortunate habit of extending its jurisdiction. Every
now and then Conference needs a gentle chiding to
keep it from over-working.
J<( ♦ * :)(
r. the drum majorette question, Conference was un
doubtedly out of bounds. The line which separates
matters pertinent to Stanford women from matters
where Stanford women are impertinent, is a vague one.
But the Band is definitely beyond Conference power.
In attempting to high-jack authority over a Band
member, Conference demonstrated its old weakness
for jurisdictional imperialism. And in any case it is
hard to see how a handspring can be unbecoming in
this athletic age.
When the Band revolted, it did more than prevent
a questionable bit of censorship. It made an issue of
the question of jurisdiction. Ex Committee's decision,
and student opinion backed it up. The whirling red
skirts on the Big Game field became a marker in stu
dent government history.
Perhaps the Band didn't act according to the best
Emily Post tradition. Perhaps it should have bowed
and said, "With your kind permission, mesdames, we
beg to disagree." But that is a minor issue. The im
portant fact is that it acted, which is more than most
student organizations have done in the past.
And after all, the British officers made some very
nasty remarks about the manners of the embattled
farmers at Lexington.

When the Band revolted, it did more than prevent
a questionable bit of censorship. It made an issue of
the question of jurisdiction. Ex Committee's decision,
and student opinion backed it up. The whirling red
skirts on the Big Game field became a marker in stu
dent government history.
Perhaps the Band didn't act according to the best
Emily Post tradition. Perhaps it should have bowed
and said, "With your kind permission, mesdames, we
beg to disagree." But that is a minor issue. The im
portant fact is that it acted, which is more than most
student organizations have done in the past.
And after all, the British officers made some very
nasty remarks about the manners of the embattled
farmers at Lexington.
IF WE want a complete explanation of the battle that
stormed around Stanford's drum majorette last
week, we will probably have to wait until somebody
writes his memoirs. But one thing stands out clearly
against the background of "hasty" actions and parlia
mentary sabre-rattling. The Band, Stanford's sup
pressed minority, suddenly became the patriotic de
fender of liberty. Even the embattled farmers of Lex
ington and Concord couldn't have done a better job of
quick change in character.
Ordinarily the students regard the Band as a sort
of step-child of the B.A.C. They accept it with con
descending tolerance when it is on key, and pelt it
with sarcastic comment whenever the saxes and the
French horns have a difference of opinion.
But last, week the Band did an about-face in
morale, and did it with military precision. When
Women's Conference informed them that it consid
ered drum majorettes as conduct unbecoming, the
Band members acted with the speed and courage of
Minute Men. They told Conference that if the drum
majorette were censored, the Band would go on strike.
If Trilby had suddenly slapped Svengali's face, he
would not have been more surprised than Stanford
was.
I might explain here that I have nothing but the
greatest respect and admiration for Women's Confer
ence as an aggregation of individuals. The members
that I know are all very swefet and charming girls.
But as an organization, Women's Conference has an
unfortunate habit of extending its jurisdiction. Every
now and then Conference needs a gentle chiding to
keep it from over-working.

r. the drum majorette question, Conference was un
doubtedly out of bounds. The line which separates
matters pertinent to Stanford women from matters
where Stanford women are impertinent, is a vague one.
But the Band is definitely beyond Conference power.
In attempting to high-jack authority over a Band
member, Conference demonstrated its old weakness
for jurisdictional imperialism. And in any case it is
hard to see how a handspring can be unbecoming in
this athletic age.
