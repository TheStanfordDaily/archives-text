Some time Saturday night after the game one
guy was standing around in his fraternity with a
beautifully blank expression on his face.
One of his brothers came up to him and said,
"What do you mean by throwing that megaphone
and cutting that girl's head?"
"I'm sorry." the guy said. "I was throwing at
the old lady standing beside her. Honest I was."
♦ * # #
Some guys were talking about a paper they had to
write for a course. They were moaning about how
long it was, how much work they had to do, and all
the standard moans.
And one guy came through with a wonderful idea.
But absolutely no convictions.
"I nearly gave the professor nil my notes," he
said, "and let him write his own paper."
* * * *
It's so old it's almost unbelievable, but it
happened Saturday.
A guy took his gal and mother, both of whom
had come up from down south just for that day, to
the game Saturday—and got clear over in Berke
ley before he found he didn't have bis tickets with
him. He came clear back to Stanford after them.
And he's a senior.
# # # *
yY FRIEND of mine went over to the game and met,
as he had planned to, a female friend of his at. one
of the sororities there. She was with some people, and
they had already started to eat when he got there.
So he wandered around, as he put it, until he found
a plate of food, wandered back to (he other room and
ate it.
He was still hungry when he finished, so he wan
dered back into the dining room again and wandered
around until he found another plate.
As he picked it up a rather large woman standing
near him said in a rather marked way, "Are you with
someone here?"
"Yes. thank you," said my friend, as if this large
woman were trying to piek him up.
As he wandered of! with this second plate, he
heard the large woman remarking to someone, "Some
of these people arc eating too much."
But he finished his second plate, wandered back
with his dishes, wandered around looking for dessert,
and not finding any, wandered out toward the front
door.
On his way out the large woman button-holed him
once again. "Are you still looking for food?" she
asked uninvitingly.
"No."
My friend wand»<rod on out of the house.
And found out later that the large woman was
the house mother there.

Some time Saturday night after the game one
guy was standing around in his fraternity with a
beautifully blank expression on his face.
One of his brothers came up to him and said,
"What do you mean by throwing that megaphone
and cutting that girl's head?"
"I'm sorry." the guy said. "I was throwing at
the old lady standing beside her. Honest I was."
♦ * # #
Some guys were talking about a paper they had to
write for a course. They were moaning about how
long it was, how much work they had to do, and all
the standard moans.
And one guy came through with a wonderful idea.
But absolutely no convictions.
"I nearly gave the professor nil my notes," he
said, "and let him write his own paper."
* * * *
It's so old it's almost unbelievable, but it
happened Saturday.
A guy took his gal and mother, both of whom
had come up from down south just for that day, to
the game Saturday—and got clear over in Berke
ley before he found he didn't have bis tickets with
him. He came clear back to Stanford after them.
And he's a senior.

yY FRIEND of mine went over to the game and met,
as he had planned to, a female friend of his at. one
of the sororities there. She was with some people, and
they had already started to eat when he got there.
So he wandered around, as he put it, until he found
a plate of food, wandered back to (he other room and
ate it.
He was still hungry when he finished, so he wan
dered back into the dining room again and wandered
around until he found another plate.
As he picked it up a rather large woman standing
near him said in a rather marked way, "Are you with
someone here?"
"Yes. thank you," said my friend, as if this large
woman were trying to piek him up.
As he wandered of! with this second plate, he
heard the large woman remarking to someone, "Some
of these people arc eating too much."
But he finished his second plate, wandered back
with his dishes, wandered around looking for dessert,
and not finding any, wandered out toward the front
door.
On his way out the large woman button-holed him
once again. "Are you still looking for food?" she
asked uninvitingly.
"No."
My friend wand»<rod on out of the house.
And found out later that the large woman was
the house mother there.
