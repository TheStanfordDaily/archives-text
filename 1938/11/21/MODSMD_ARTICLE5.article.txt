# Hitler Seeks New Refuge For Jews
## Hitler and Duce Warn Poland and Hungary In Ruthenian Dispute 
### 
BERLIN, Nov. 20 (UP). â€”Ger-
j many is negotiating with several
Central and South American nations
for admission of large numbers of
the Reich's 700,000 unwanted Jews,
it was understood in well-informed
quarters tonight.
The negotiations were said to be
progressing "favorably" with the
Dominican Republic, whose minister
to Berlin tonight was en route to
Munich, perhaps for consultation
with Chancellor Adolf Hitler.
NO HITLER STATEMENT
Hitler is spending the week-end
at his Berchtesgaden Alpine retreat,
near Munich, but it could not be
ascertained whether the Dominican
envoy's journey was connected with
the reported colonization plan.
Hitler's supposed efforts to find an
outlet for thousands of German Jews
were significant in view of the
forthcoming Pan-American confer
ence at Lima.
While Hitler is reported to be at
tempting to "unload' many Jewish
families in South and Central Amer
ica, Nazi officials and newspapers are
bitterly condemning the Lima meet
ing.
UNITED FRONT
The.press charges President Roo
sevelt is using the Jewish issue as an
argument for the establishment of a
common front among the American
nations against the totalitarian
powers.
"The Lima conference is exclu
sively a Pan-American affair in
which Germany has no political con
cern, an official German spokesman
said, but it was admitted privately
in high Nazi circles Hitler and his
aides would follow the work of the
conference closely.
All official indications were that
Germany is ignoring the Anglo-
American plan being developed in
London for the mass migration of
German Jews, providing them with
new homos in British colonies with
the United States providing the bulk
of the funds for the project.
Propaganda Minister Paul Joseph
GoebbeLs, in a speech Saturday, said
the Reich hoped other nations would
"love the Jews so they may take
our Jews."
He warned foreigners should
cease photesting against the fate of
Jews in Germany lest, there 1*? a
prompt intensification of Nazi anti-
Semitic measures.
GERMAN PRESS ANGRY
There was anger in the German
press over reports German Jews
might be settled in the pre-war Ger
man colonies, particularly Tangan
yika, which Hitler still hopes to re
gain.
While the German anti-Jewish
measures appeared to bo in a week
end lull, the breach between the
Reich and Roman Catholic Church
grew steadily wider.
Count Konrad Von Prcysing, Ber
lin's nobleman-priest, issued a pas
toral letter protesting against the
government s action in attempting to
induce Catholic parents to send their
children to state rather than confes
sional (parochial) schools.
