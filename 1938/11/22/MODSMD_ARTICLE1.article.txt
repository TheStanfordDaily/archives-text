# Water Poloists Clash for Title
## Coast Conference Crown at Stake In Today's Bear-Indian Splash-fest 
### MORRIS HENDERSON 
Two of the best college water polo teams in the country, Stanford and
California, will battle it out this afternoon in the Enciua pool with the
Pacific Coast Conference championship at stake.
Tied for the league lead with four wins and a single loss, the Card and
Rear varsities will hrcak this tie and one will grab the title in what prom
ises to be a ding-dong battle start-+

ing at 4 o'clock. It will be the final
game of the season for both teams.
Preceding their big brothers, the
frosh squads of both schools will
start the ball rolling when they tan
gle at 3 o'clock sharp.

Admission into the games for all I
students will be 25 cents with stu- |
dent body cards.
DIVING EXHIBITION
Between the freshman and the
varisty games, Roy Winkelmann,
Pacific Coast intercollegiate <living
champion, and Howard Adams, Pa
cific Coast A.A.U. champion, will
show their wares with some exhi- j
bition diving.
Despite the fact that Stanford I
knocked over California, 1937 co
champions, last Wednesday by a
score of 3 to 2, the Indians will not
be necessarily favorites, as both
teams are as evenly matched as any
two teams could be.
"Anything can happen," said
Coach Norton Thornton. "It might
be a tight game like the last one or
both teams might go wild, and it will
turn into a high-scoring game. It
all depends on which team is hot."
OFFENSIVES DIFFER
Not. only will two teams fight it
out for supremacy, but two entirely
different offensive systems, the Hun
garian-and the American, will bat
tle for top ranking. The Hungarian
offense, used by Stanford, features
the short pass, fast breaking style of
play, while the American system,
used by California, is built around
the long pass, non breaking, get into
position style.
Both teams will be at complete
strength for the game with only
Ted Moreno, Stanford guard, and
Ken Wheeler, California's All-Con
ference forward, ailing slightly. Mo
reno, absent from practice since last
Wednesday's game with sinus trou
ble, has recovered and will start in
his usual position. Wheeler was re
ported to have reinjured his shoul
der, which kept him out of most
of ihe season's play, but he too will
probably start today's game.
FORWARDS' LAST CAME
Today's game will be the last ap
pearance of two Stanford forwards
playing under the Cardinal and
White colors. The two seniors are
Captain Johnny Lamb, all-confer
ence for the last two years, and
Jack Loupe, his running partner on
the other side of the pool. It will
also be tho final collegiate game for
Captain Wheeler of the Bears.
Coach Thornton will start his
veteran team that has opened most
of the games so far this season. They
are Johnny Lamb, Bob Plate, Har
vey Rothschild, Jack Loupe, Ted
Moreno, Dick Hoover, and Roy
Vitousek.

garian-and the American, will bat
tle for top ranking. The Hungarian
offense, used by Stanford, features
the short pass, fast breaking style of
play, while the American system,
used by California, is built around
the long pass, non breaking, get into
position style.
Both teams will be at complete
strength for the game with only
Ted Moreno, Stanford guard, and
Ken Wheeler, California's All-Con
ference forward, ailing slightly. Mo
reno, absent from practice since last
Wednesday's game with sinus trou
ble, has recovered and will start in
his usual position. Wheeler was re
ported to have reinjured his shoul
der, which kept him out of most
of ihe season's play, but he too will
probably start today's game.
FORWARDS' LAST CAME
Today's game will be the last ap
pearance of two Stanford forwards
playing under the Cardinal and
White colors. The two seniors are
Captain Johnny Lamb, all-confer
ence for the last two years, and
Jack Loupe, his running partner on
the other side of the pool. It will
also be tho final collegiate game for
Captain Wheeler of the Bears.
Coach Thornton will start his
veteran team that has opened most
of the games so far this season. They
are Johnny Lamb, Bob Plate, Har
vey Rothschild, Jack Loupe, Ted
Moreno, Dick Hoover, and Roy
Vitousek.
Two of the best college water polo teams in the country, Stanford and
California, will battle it out this afternoon in the Enciua pool with the
Pacific Coast Conference championship at stake.
Tied for the league lead with four wins and a single loss, the Card and
Rear varsities will hrcak this tie and one will grab the title in what prom
ises to be a ding-dong battle start-+

ing at 4 o'clock. It will be the final
game of the season for both teams.
Preceding their big brothers, the
frosh squads of both schools will
start the ball rolling when they tan
gle at 3 o'clock sharp.

Admission into the games for all I
students will be 25 cents with stu- |
dent body cards.
DIVING EXHIBITION
Between the freshman and the
varisty games, Roy Winkelmann,
Pacific Coast intercollegiate <living
champion, and Howard Adams, Pa
cific Coast A.A.U. champion, will
show their wares with some exhi- j
bition diving.
Despite the fact that Stanford I
knocked over California, 1937 co
champions, last Wednesday by a
score of 3 to 2, the Indians will not
be necessarily favorites, as both
teams are as evenly matched as any
two teams could be.
"Anything can happen," said
Coach Norton Thornton. "It might
be a tight game like the last one or
both teams might go wild, and it will
turn into a high-scoring game. It
all depends on which team is hot."
OFFENSIVES DIFFER
Not. only will two teams fight it
out for supremacy, but two entirely
different offensive systems, the Hun
garian-and the American, will bat
tle for top ranking. The Hungarian
offense, used by Stanford, features
the short pass, fast breaking style of
play, while the American system,
used by California, is built around
the long pass, non breaking, get into
position style.
