# New Mexico Trip Planned By Debaters
## Redskin Reservation Destination of Annual Investigation Tour 
### 
Indians will meet Indians when a
Stanford debate team wanders
through New Mexican reservations
during Christmas vacation on a tour
of investigation and good will.
Members of the team have not
been selected as yet, according to
Dr. Leland T. Chapin, varsity debate
coach, who also announced that he
would be glad to'talk with anyone
interested in making such a trip.
Students are advised to see him at
his office in Room 200T as soon as
possible.
A first group will be selected on
the basis of their interviews with
Dr. Chapin while the second group,
and final team, will be selected after
an appearance before Debate Coun
cil. Members of the Council are
Leland T. Chapin, chairman, Jack
Strain, debate manager, Tom Kille
fer, student manager, and Gene
Glassmann, prominent debater.
TOURS TRADITIONAL
The tours have become somewhat!
of a tradition at Stanford, having
been initiated in 1936 when a team
which included Jim Reynolds, form
er student body president, and Jim
Hill, Jr., Phi Beta Kappa, traveled
through Mexico and Central America
gathering authentic material for fu
ture debates. Reynolds, at present on
the campus, commented that "if this
tour did as much good as ours, it
would be excellent indeed."
Unique feature of the Card debat
ing tours is that they reverse the
usual procedure through which a
team absorbs a good deal of knowl
edge from books on a given subject,
then goes touring to debate. Stan
ford's journey is for the purpose of
accumulating authentic data on the
problems of the American Indian
and then coming home to utilize it
in discussion groups and forensic
meets.
STUDENT SUPPORT
In planning the present lour, Mr.
Chapin atid Jack Strain, debate man
ager, have found that they not
only have the support of the student
body in general, but also have been
offered the enthusiastic assistance of
such Indian experts as Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Wood Stevens and Will
Rogers, Jr. Mr. and Mrs. Stevens re
sided in the southwest for a number
of years before Mr. Stevens took up
his post as director of the Stanford
Theater. They have made an exten
sive study of the problems confront
ing the American Indian, and their
knowledge has raised them to the
sphere of experts.
