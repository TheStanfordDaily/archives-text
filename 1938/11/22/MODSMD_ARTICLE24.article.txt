### 
BERLIN, Nov. 21 (UP).â€”The Yel
low Star of David, badge of medie
val ghettos, appeared in Berlin to
night as officials of the Nazi Labor
front began taking over Jewish
homes and house-to-house search
ers brought more arrests of Jews.
The Yellow Star of David, remin
iscent of the "yellow spot" which
Jews were forced to wear whenever
they ventured outside ghetto walls
in the middle ages, was posted on
the office doors of Jewish doctors.
Beneath the star, on a background
of blue, was the warning: "For med
ical treatment of Jews only."
