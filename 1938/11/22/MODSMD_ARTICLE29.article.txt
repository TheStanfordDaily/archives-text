PROMINENT WRITER
Rising to prominence through his

recent best-seller "The Education of
Hyman Kaplan," and his tales of the
"star-spangled" Hyman, fictitious
character which critics hailed as the
symbol of the immigrant American,
Mr. "Ross-Ilosten" is also prominent
as a serious student of political sci
ence and the author of "The Wash
ington Correspondents," an authori
tative book about "the men beliind
the news" from the nation's capital.
Contending that, for democracy to
continue in the United States, a
"vested interest for the people" must
be created, the author urges thai,
each man be given "a stake in
democracy."
"View your social security and so
cial health programs as defeat
measures and your democratic au
dience will become a democratic
army," he asserts. "We can't mud
dle through any longer; we've got to
fight our way Ihrough."
That the prosperous, "well-dress
ed" people of the country constitute
the key to the solution of many po
litical, social, and .economic prob
lems — both national and interna
tional—is the contention of th(»
speaker, who believes that "through
their action and support, the weli
dressed men and women can con
trol the future of the United
States."
HITLER DENOUNCED
Denouncing the aggressiveness of
European nations and their dictators,
particularly Nazi Germany and
Adolf Hitler, Mr. Rosten explains
that "in the past the world has
forced madmen to conform to its
boundaries, while today the world
conforms to boundaries set by the
same madmen."
"The demands of paranoid per
jsonalities can not be satisfied—it is
j impossible," declares the speaker.
"Thus, our only solution is to build
our convictions of right until they
I become strength. The history of dic
tators reveals that the more arms
the more their military might and
the less their ability to fight. The
old orthodox diplomacy is dead;
what we need are good political psy
chiatrists."

sity of Chicago, where he received
his Ph.B. and Ph.D. degrees, and

as a serious student of political sci
ence and the author of "The Wash
ington Correspondents," an authori
tative book about "the men beliind
the news" from the nation's capital.
Contending that, for democracy to
continue in the United States, a
"vested interest for the people" must
be created, the author urges thai,
each man be given "a stake in
democracy."
"View your social security and so
cial health programs as defeat
measures and your democratic au
dience will become a democratic
army," he asserts. "We can't mud
dle through any longer; we've got to
fight our way Ihrough."
That the prosperous, "well-dress

the key to the solution of many po

European nations and their dictators,
particularly Nazi Germany and
Adolf Hitler, Mr. Rosten explains

forced madmen to conform to its
boundaries, while today the world

same madmen."
"The demands of paranoid per
jsonalities can not be satisfied—it is
j impossible," declares the speaker.
"Thus, our only solution is to build
our convictions of right until they
I become strength. The history of dic
tators reveals that the more arms
the more their military might and
the less their ability to fight. The
old orthodox diplomacy is dead;
what we need are good political psy
chiatrists."
