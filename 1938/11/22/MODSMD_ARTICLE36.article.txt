# Delta Chi Wins Intramural Crown
## Team Takes Grid Laurels Second Time Victors' Air Attack Downs Sigma Chi 6-0 In Touch Football 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
An aerial-minded Delta Chi grid I
outfit, making its own scoring |
breaks and staving off several op- .
ponent thrusts at the goal, powered i
to its second consecutive intramural j
touch-football championship of the ]
Farm yesterday, (i to 0, over Sigma
Chi.
Outside of nearly seven minutes at
the .start of the second half when '
Delia Chi put on an air raid which !
resulted in a 20-yard touchdown i
pass, both clubs fought on fairly I
even grounds, with Sigma Chi dis- I
playing a dazzling running attack
which moved the ball into danger- !
ous territory twice only to be held j
off by a tightening defense.
It was one ol the toughest after
noons Delta Chi's last year's champs
experienced this season. Their pass
ing attack, which worked for most
of their scores during the league sea
son, was stymied several times
when the offense started clicking.
SULLIVAN PASSES
With Sully Sullivan in the passing
role and Jack Laney, Fred Baker, 1
Herb Bull, and Charles Melntyre on
the receiving end, Delta Chi held a
decided edge in the aerial depart
ment; but Sigma Chi evidenced su- !
periority on the ground with Leo j
Feder gaining huge yardage on end
sweeps.
Both clubs mixed up their attacks
with a variety of plays but the ad- '
vantages gained were quickly cut !
short as the two defenses closed in. j
Delta Chi took the second-half'
kick-off and moved up to the 30- !
yftrd line on Laney's run. After being j
set back to the 15 by a holding pen- ]
alty, Delta Chi opened its scoring !
drive with four consecutive first !
downs.
SCORE DRIVE STARTS
Sullivan passed to Bull for a first- j
and-ten on the 40 and then threw a j
strike to Baker for a new set of !
downs on Sigma Chi's 45. Breaking I
into the open out in the flat, Mc- !
Intyre speared Sullivan's next loss !
for a gain to the 30, but it took three '
passes to Smith and Baker to drive i
the ball to the 20.
At that point, Sullivan spotted
Baker out to his left and on the
goal line. Baker side-stepped a de- j
fensive back lor the championship j
pay-off. The conversion was nulli- j
fied when two Delt Chis touched the 1
pass attempt.
