<) NE more chance to win a Big
Game and one more chance to i
gain a conference crown!
Stanford will take to the water |
this afternoon in a fast, hard battle 1
with the crack University of Califor- |
nia swimmers to break a tie for
I 1938 conference water polo honors.
A 3-2 win dt Berkeley last week I
would seem to give the Indians an j

edge in their re
peat performance,
but experts still
hold the Bears
slightly in favor.
Both are fine
teams, each with
one loss against it, !
and all facts indi- [
cate that today's

battle will pack more thrills into 14
minutes than there are in a Zane
Grey melodrama.
Captain Johnny Lamb will j
stroke gracefully into scoring ter- |
ritory and lob the ball accurately :
with his left hand in sharp con
trast to the straight hard power i
shots of Jack Loupe, swimming in !
the opposite forward spot.
Boh Plate and Harv Rothschild, ;
key men of the new offense, will
break all over the pool and keep ,
the ball moving, sometimes feed- j
ing it to the forwards and some- j
times scoring themselves.
Guarding Cal's two high scorers j
will be one of the finest pairs of j
guards ever to appear in Stanford

water, Dick Hoo- |
vcr and Ted Mo- i
reno. Frank Dowl- I
ing, relieved occa- !
sionally by Roy !
Vitousek, will up- j
hold the Cardinal
secondary defense J
from the goal - j
guard spot.
Both teams will j
be keyed for their 1

final and deciding contest, and if the j
Indians play in home waters as they |
did in a jinxed Berkeley pool, they're i
a cinch to wear the conference i
crown.

(DARTMOUTH had a pair of
scouting coaches and a publicity
director in the press box at the Big
Game, and they were situated in
such a way that guffers of The Daily
could not help but hear (try as we
might) what they had to say and
look over their shoulders as they
charted our plays.
They are counting on a victory for
the Big Green, but they anticipate
one of the most colorful games in
1938 grid history. And with good
reason.
Dartmouth plays a typically east
ern type of game, patterned very
much like that used by the famous

Pittsburgh Pan
thers and other
fine eastern teams.
Not only that, but
the standings and
similarities of the
two universities
(while it is char
tered as a college,
Dartmouth is ideal-

ly a university made up of colleges)
I should add background to the con
test. Both are private institutions,
outstanding among their neighbors,
i and representative of others of their
i part of the countryâ€”Stanford of the
i informal co-educational universities
of the West and Dartmouth of the
aged and dignified Ivy Leaguers of
the East.
Asked last September what
game would he outstanding from
the spectator viewpoint, Ben Win
kelman. Card backficld mentor,
said, "I'd pick Dartmouth as the
game to see. Typical eastern and
western teams will he meeting in a
contest that will be good, interest
ing football."
j The Big Game aftermath would
ordinarily belittle a post-season
I game, but it can't this year. One of
the finest teams the East has pro
duced will arrive in California to
' day, and Saturday's game is dim
| ming in the past inside the big green
i fence where Stanford rehearses as
j the Indians suddenly realize that
j they have another hard job and a
j real game to play next Saturday
! afternoon.
