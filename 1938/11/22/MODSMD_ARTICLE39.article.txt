# Injuries May Hamper Grid Team Saturday
## 
### 
Tiny Thornhill finally got his best eleven men in shape for the start of
the Big Game but the good luck was just too good to last.
Fred Ledeboer, the only regular back to play in every game this year,
was finally caught up with in the first quarter of the Cal titanic. Now he's
wandering around the campus with his arm in a sling, waiting for the
preview of a set of X-ray shots. The team doctors weren't sure last night

whether Ledeboer's injury was just<
a bad bruise or something more'
serious. '
In any event, Ledeboer will miss
some practice. sessions before the i
Dartmouth game and might not be 1
allowed to play at all. He has prob- j
ably played more minutes this fall
than any other man on the squad
and would certainly be missed
against the Ivy League redskins.
Bill Paulman's trigger thumb on
his right hand was also smashed
up in the Bear battle, but it won't
keep him out of action.
While most of the squad mem
bers literally lost their shirts on the
Big Game, none of them looked a
bit ashamed of their exhibition yes
terday. Dartmouth, near-king of
Eastern football, may be the team
finally to get a taste of the luckless
Indians at their best.
