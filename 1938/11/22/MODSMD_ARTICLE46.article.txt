# Say It Isn't So
## 
### 
AFTER being pelted sporadically all season
with sure-fire rumors that Stanford will have
a new football coach, who he will be, who he
will not be, and just what alumni and what
columnists tell what administration heads how
to run the University, Stanford yesterday re
ceived the information that a new coach is on
the slave-block ready for the auction —and that
Tiny is on the guillotine stand.
Perhaps it is in bad taste to talk of such
things. Perhaps the dirty back-wash of rumor
should be ignored by Stanford and The Daily.
Perhaps, however, such talk should be consid
ered something of an insult to a man who in a
sense represents the campus as a whole, and
to the campus which, throughout the time he
has been here, has supported him. It seems
to say that extraneous organizations, writers,
and individuals know more what is good for
the University than those already in charge.
So Stanford probably will listen to the ru
mors, take them sitting down. Whether the
campus concurs with them or the spirit behind
them, or whether it resents their interference
makes little difference right now.
But, with all the talk from outside sources,
sources hardly qualified to be considered as
representative of Stanford opinion, some in
dication of campus thought would appear to
be in order. And it should come now, when
Stanford's opinion will bear some weight.
At the outset, it is plain that the opinion of
metropolitan writers should bear no weight in
forming University policies. Some of them say
so themselves. More consider themselves as
divinely appointed dictators of Universities
within their territory. But their ideas should
count for nothing.
Those of the alumni mean more. They sup
port athletics; for their support, though it is
given with no strings attached, they might be
entitled to voice opinions. But, in their spirit
of benefiting their University, they should, at
the same time, be ready to concur with the
present Stanford's own wishes on matters of
policy.
So while the talk is still in the air, The Daily
suggests that Stanford itself have something
to say.
If straws blown up by the enthusiasm of the
Big Game tell any tale, those rumors will be
scotched once and for all.
