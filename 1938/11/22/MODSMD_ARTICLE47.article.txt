# Amateurs Take the Field

WHEN Delta Chi took Sigma Chi in a 6-0
replica of the Big Game yesterday, the
opening event on Stanford's intramural pro
gram came to a close, but the year's diversi
fied line-up only began.
Stanford's forgotten men, that's what intra
muralists are. Slipped over for the most part
by publicity write-ups, playing to no cheering
crowds, managed quietly and efficiently from
an Encina Gym office, the program gets no
ballyhoo.
But nevertheless, it is the greatest single ac
tivity on the Farm. In its program, more of the
campus is involved than in any other sport,
committee, or organization.
Plus these features:
Little publicity—no alumni gripes.
No stadia—no expensive players to buy.
No coaches—no rumors.
No color, perhaps - organized intercollegiate
sports take that away.
But no headache.
