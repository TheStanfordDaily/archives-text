TUCKED away on the third floor of the
A.S.S.U. office is a card file, tended by watch
ful guardians, filling slowly with names of po
tential campus leaders. Unimpressive as it
looks or sounds, that card file may be the back
bone of the lower ranks of the A.S.S.U. ac
tivities workers. At least, it was conceived as
such.
Theoretically, committee appointments were
to be made from it. Proponents pointed to its
convenience and to its ability to spread jobs.
It was a good idea—if it worked.
Now, reports filter in that, slowly but surely,
the idea is taking hold. Committee heads are
dropping in to look for workers. Files man
agers are thumbing through to find likely
prospects.
Faint as the glimmer is, it strikes an encour
aging note. The whole project was based
on whether or not it would be used, that is
obvious.
The start has been made. If it snowballs
along, Stanford activities will set some sort of
record for fair and widespread distribution of
duties.
