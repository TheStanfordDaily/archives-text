VjT/UEN the Stanford Band stepped out of the shad
ows at the side of the stage last week and became
the gallant defender of civil liberty, we were rather
surprised. It is customary for the students to believe
that the less heard from the Band the better, and when
this Cinderella of the B.A.C. family threatened to
strike for its drum majorette, it upset our ideologies.
And so in the confusion of ignorant committees clash
ing by night, we overlooked another fact about the
Band. We forgot to notice that at some time this fall
it has learned to march and to play music.
For the Band to produce something actually ap
proaching music is almost as startling as its threatened
revolt. And when it also demonstrates that it can
parade across a field in good military order without
looking like a mob-scene, the achievement becomes a
miracle that ranks with anything the apostles staged.

Up to this year there has been some question as to
whether or not Stanford had a Band. It is true that
at football games a crowd of men in red suits wan
dered about the field making noises. But critical stu
dents pointed out that it takes more than red suits
to make a band, that there must be a certain unity
of opinion as to music and formation. Stanford's case,
they granted, was a borderline one, but they felt that
there was a little too much individualism to get it
under the wire.
Until this fall, activities in the half looked like a
voodoo ceremonial dance. The music was a confused
noise: the marching order closely resembled a New
York street scene. A few of the members were able
to keep together, but as Kipling said, it was a thin
red line of heroes when the Band began to play.

AT some time during the past three months the
metamorphosis occurred. Our grubby little band
became a beautiful butterfly. It produced a couple of
soloists who could turn out music instead of a weird
noise like the mating call of the moose. It gave up its
experiments in musical archeology and learned half a
dozen popular tunes.
More than that, it taught itself to march. Last Sat
urday it paraded across the field with lines as straight
as a dean's morals. No longer were the trombones
hanging to its skirts like frightened children; and the
horns in the rear presented a solid back instead of
trailing out like a fluttering veil.

The impression was magnificent. A trim, military
Band snapping about the field is something to make any
man sit up. For the first time, students this fall have
given a big six for the Band and meant it.
Credit, of course, goes to the Band itself. No oblig
ing saint swung the deal. It was based in hard work
and rehearsal. But even so, many an accredited
miracle has been less impressive.
