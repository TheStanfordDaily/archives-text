IJRAMA:
Four guys from Stanford were walking away
| from the stadium at Cal after the game. They had
their rooters' hats on. They saw four Cal guys with
rooters' hats, coming toward them. As one man, they
quickly took of! their own rooters' hats and furtively
hid them. The Cal guys took off their hats and hid
them.
The Stanford and Cal boys passed glaring at each
other, looked over their shoulders at exactly the same
time to glare once again, and then boldly put on their
hats.

PICTURE:
A frosh woman, sober but sleepy, couldn't get
i into her room at Del Monte very early Sunday morn
ing, and the egg she was with had gone down to the
desk to get a key to the room.
It was just too hard to stand there waiting for him
| to come back. She sat down on the floor, leaned against
! the door, and went half asleep.
1 All the time, she was clutching an unopened cham
pagne bottle which she had made a ritual of carrying
around all night.
Several people passed.
And commented.

OLD HAND:
"Liquor has never touched my lips,"' a gal was
primly telling the guy she was with.
"But I have seen you drink," he said. "What are
| you talking about?"
Liquor has never touched my lips. I always gulp
| it down."
