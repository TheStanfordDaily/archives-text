# CAMPUS OPINION
## GIVE BUNN CHANCE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The pages of history are filled with
accounts of men who have desired
to present an idea to the world but
who have failed because words, their
only means of communication, were
insufficient to convey the real and
intended meaning. Socrates in his
efforts to instill youth with a desire
for culture and wisdom was forced
to drink the hemlock because his
listeners hastened to wrong conclu
sions. People laughed as Pasteur in
jected his animals with the vaccine
which has brought endless rewards
to all of civilization. Christ had but
one desire, to help others and yet
the world mocked his idea of broth
erly love and put him to death!
Stanford students have come to
this institution with the failh that
those members of the faculty with
whom they come in contact will con
vey to them a useful and fundamen
tal foundation upon which to build
their lives. That same faculty has
seen fit to appoint a Dean of Men
who they feel is capable of admin
istering the affairs of that office.
Now if the students of Stanford
are really a select group, intellec
tually better than average, it seems
only reasonable that they should ex
amine carefully the words of our
Dean, before making a decision or
expressing an opinion concerning the
conditions he is trying to effect on
this campus. The question is, are we
giving Dean Bunn's opinion a fair
chance?
Thoughtful
