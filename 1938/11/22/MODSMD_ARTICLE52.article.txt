The Editor, Sir:
We of Roble wish to register our
objection to the Stanford band's
playing popular music at the foot
ball games. We feel that Stanford
songs or martial tunes would be
more appropriate than "Margie."
M. Elliott, E. Tanner, J. Thorn
ton, M. Boyd, J. Hannibal, H.
Greene, H. McShea, M. Miller,
J. Chambers, M. Harper, Betty
Droit, D. Thornton, W. Eaton,
M. McGuire, Polly Williams,
others if we had time.
