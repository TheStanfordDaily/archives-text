# "Great Waltz" Reflects Mood Of Composer
## 
### 
"THE GREAT WALTZ,'' cur
rently playing at the Warfield The
ater, San Francisco.
Smothered with whirling skirts,
three-quarter tune, and the charm
of old Vienna, the life of Johann
Strauss II has been filmed with the
usual lavishness of M.G.M.
Announced as an attempt to por
tray the spirit of the Waltz King
rather than the events of his life,
"The Great Waltz" submerges plot
and dialogue under one of the finest
and most complete musical scores
that has ever graced the screen.
Almost all of the best known
Strauss waltzes are brilliantly play
ed or sung by European soprano
MiUza Korjus. The plot of the pic
ture is the same old run of the Hol
lywood mill.
Fernand Gravet gives an accept
able, if undistinguished, portrayal
ol Strauss. As his demure little wife,
Luise Rainier does nothing but
blink her big eyes and look sensi
tive. In view of her performances
in such pictures as "The Good Earth"
and "The Great Ziegfeld" this inept
job is particularly disappointing.
The mellow soprano of Miliza Kor
jus, a European importation, is most
satisfactory for the score, but her
i ctmg is of the Theda Bara school
and her robust Continental figure
will not please the discerning rough
The mounting of "The Great
Waltz" is elaborate, charming, and
beautiful to look at. The photogra
phy is particularly original, employ
ing many odd and effective camera
angles.
For those who are still devoted to
Viennese waltzes and the charm of
nineteenth century Mittel-Europa,
"The Great Waltz" will be a delight.
Jitterbugs had better stay home with
Goodman.
