## 
### 
Learning to say "no" was recom- j
mended as the working technique of I
resisting modern high-pressure art- j
ists by Dr. James G. Emerson, asso- J
ciate professor of speech and drama.!
during the Stanford radio broadcast ,
last night.
Speaking on "Objectivity and Mr. i
Jones," a hypothetical man, Dr. Em
erson illustrated how Socrates man- \
aged to combine subjective and ob
jective thought in such a way that
when he got. people to say "yes" he
really got them to say "no—no" to
the demagogues and charlatans of j
his day, "no" to the peddlers who j
played upon the gullibilities of the 1
crowd, and "no" in the market place !
and forum.
The speaker defined objectivity as i
"that habit or attitude of mind which
enables a person to resist his im
pulsive feelings about a situation
and look at it fairly from all sides."
It is an open frame of mind, he said.
"The test of one's objectivity is his
ability to look squarely at things that
distress as well as those that please."
Dr. Emerson expressed high ad
miration for that aspect of salesman
ship which stresses service, with an
appreciation of the other person's
point of view, and said that, if sin
cerely practiced, such qualities con
stitute "a new way of life" for the
selfish individual. "Through the
manipulation of their subjective
fears and desires, whole peoples are
turned into parroting Charley Mc-
Carthys," the speaker contended.
