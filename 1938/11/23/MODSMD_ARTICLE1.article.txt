# Excom Gives $25 to Plug Show Junes
## Rudy Vallee Contacts Dramatics Council For Gaieties' Songs 
### 
For the first time in Gaieties his- |
tory, Dramatics Council will aid fi
nancially in the plugging of songs
from the annual Big Game show.
This was the decision made at last
night's Ex Committee meeting, when
$25 was voted to be used for pub
licizing the songs.
According to Hank Houser,. Dra
matics Council head, preliminary
contacts have been made with Rudy
Vallee, who has asked that records
be made of all the Gaieties tunes.
Vallee plans to have his arranger
work several of the songs into a
medley.
CONTACT BANDS
In addition, records and lead
sheets will be sent to other bands
all over the country, Houser re
vealed.
The $25 appropriation was taken
from Gaieties net profits, which
amount to approximately $1150. Pre
viously deducted from the $1300 total
profit was $100, which was given to
the Mothers' Club, and $50, used to
furnish a meeting room for Stagers
in the basement of Memorial Hall.
To investigate the methods by
which other schools handle distribu
tion of royalty profits from songs,
Houser was appointed a committee
of one, since there must be some di
vision of possible profits between the
song writers and Dramatics Counail,
which is undertaking the work of
publicizing the times.
