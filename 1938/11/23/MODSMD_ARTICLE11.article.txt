# Hanya Holm Gives Lesson To Orchesis
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
"You must consider the different
trends of the modern dance as you
do philosophy. There are many dif
ferent points of view. Yah, is it not
so?" «
Thus Hanya Holm, one of the most
famed modern dancers, answered the
question as to whether the new type
of dancing is becoming a static form.
; Miss Holm was present on the Farm
I yesterday to give a master dancing
I lesson to the Orchesis and Junior
j Orchesis groups.
A little, blonde, fortyish woman in
ian enormous furred coat, she looks
more like a German hausfrau than
one* of the age's foremost exponents
1' of the dance.
Before the lesson itself began.

Miss Holm spoke to the Stanford
dance group in the lobby of the
Women's Gym. Though her English
was a little halting, she made each
point, clear by the movement of her
graceful and expressive hands.
She emphasized the importance of
hard work as well as talent in the
field of modern dance. "It takes a
terrific time and it may be some
what painful at first, but, in the end
it wiil bring great satisfaction, for
you will then be able to express your
ideas with your body," she added.
Miss Holm approves of the uni
j versity schools of the dance, for
they not only build up a critical au
! dience for "us artists" but they also
I give the young dancer the right edu
cation and proper start. Over half

lof the dancers in the Holm group
'are college graduates, with Ben
nington and Sarah Lawrence fur
nishing the majority.
During the early afternoon the
dancer was taken on a tour of the
campus. She expressed amazement
at. the beauty and fine equipment of
the Stanford theaters. "All three of
them, the big one, Che little one, and
the out-of-doors one."
Hanya Holm displays little of the
temperament usually associated with
dancers of her calibre. She speaks to
her classes in a quiet tone and ex
plains each movement clearly.
As this interviewer left she was
j carefully explaining, "No, no. the
body must be a vortical up-right, not
| like a-a-a, what is it, ah—a ques-
I tion mark."
