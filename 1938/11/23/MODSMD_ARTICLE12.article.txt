# White Indians Arrive, Seek Revenge On Cards

It being pretty near Thanksgiving
Day—and the locals wouldn't under
stand the full significance of this
event to a New Englander—the treat
ment everybody is giving the Dart
mouth football squad since its ar
rival in California yesterday morning
reminds your Indian correspondent
of the treatment we give the turkeys
back home.
Kill them with kindness all year
and then lay the axe to their necks
for the big feed.
However, all Dartmouth does ap
preciate the fine relationships that
have grown out. of little soil and few
waterings between Stanford and
Dartmouth in football. Perhaps it's
because we see each other only at
rare intervals, or something; but at
any rate the game with Stanford has
been a rod letter contest on the
Green schedule this fall, and Mr.
Robert McLeod and his football
mates weren't naturally averse to
making a swell trip across this U.S.A.
and Into sunny California.
WARY OF C. OF C.
Most of the boys, including this
one, couldn't imagine what it would
be like until arriving, for the Cham
ber of Commerce, like every other
chamber of commerce, is apt to
stretch a point for the sake of a few
converts.
Much to everyone's surprise the
country is as swell as the literature
on the state claims it to be.
But to be very frank, the Big
Green won't be paying much atten
tion to the scenery ,as nice as it is
—and ably aided by the feminine
talent, too, may I add — for Dart
mouth has taken a long train ride
to win a football game if it is at all
possible.
TOUGII FIGHT SEEN
After seeing the Red Indians play
a grand game of pigskin folly against
your rival foe across the pond, I feel
that Dartmouth will have to be at
its best to win this last game on the
1938 schedule.
This is not to say that we don't
think Dartmouth will show you a
fair country football club on Satur
day.
Its admirers make no claims that
it is the best of football elevens. It's
pretty good though. You won't see
many better backs in the nation to
day than our Captain Bob McLeod,
who is supported by two other ball
carriers, Left Halfback Bill Hutch
inson and Colby Howe, who can run
when the occasion presents itself.
BREAKS MAY TELL
The whole question is: will the
occasion present itself? Sometimes
occasions are mean and refuse to
come forward. Dartmouth has lost
one game this fall. Two games in
three years. Both of the elevens that
can boast victories over the Hano
verites in this span of three semes
ters were big teams that wouldn't
budge for "nobody."
Stanford seems to have the kind
of defense that we saw in the game
at Berkeley. There are no weak
nesses in Tiny's forward wall, and
if there were there would have to be
big ones before the Indians' little
forward wall at 184 pounds could
make them speedway lanes for our
outstanding backs.
However, taking from the left
I hand while the right hand sleeps,
j the Big Green line, God bless it, is
no push-over. After all it went
through the Harvard game, the Yale
! tilt, the Princeton set-to, etc., with
j its head high and its courage un
questioned. Ends Whit Miller and
Jim Parks, tackles George Sommers
and Jim Feeley, guards Lou Young,
Jr., and Gus Zitrides and center Bob
Bob Gibson won't scare Stanford out
of the ball park with their size, hut
they will give the fans an example
of what excellent line coaching can
do with lamb instead of chicken,
j JUST NAMES TO WEST
'MacLeod, Parks, Zitrides, Gibson,
; Howe, Noppcr, Dilkps, Highmark,
' Mills, Wakelin, Feeley, etc., arc just
J names to you. But to those who have
seen them practicing in summer
I weather and winter snow storms on
j our own home field, who have seen
them in victory and defeat—all two
of them — in light spots and good
spots through the "Ivy League"
grid circles ,can recollect memories
| of these Dartmouth players in action
| that will ail be replayed as the last
I game of their careers takes place on
your field.
It may be a long way from home
i that the faces find themselves. The
| idea is just the same as if it were in
Hanover.
It would be my guess that you'll
see one of your best games of your
j season on Saturday, and write me
| a letter if I'm wrong.
