# Alumni on 'Dartmouth Special' Arrive En Masse Friday for Tilt
## 
### 
A strange tribe of Indians will
sweep into the state Friday morn
ing when the "Dartmouth Special"
grinds to a halt at the Oakland
terminal.
Praying for a massacre of the
Western Redskin, the Easterners
start on a two-day war dance
around the countryside, ending in a
dinner-dance and peace-pipe con
clave at the Fairmont Hotel on Sat
urday night.
In addition to the train from Bos
ton, two other specials will arrive,
one from Seattle and one from Los
Angeles, bearing rooters to partici
pate in the program arranged by the
Dartmouth Association of Northern
California. Game headquarters are
in the Fairmont Hotel.
Luncheons and sightseeing tours
will mark tho initial stages of the
pow-wow. A big "tribal feast" is
to be held in the Administration
Building on Treasure Island. This
location will serve the double pur
pose of allowing a free rein for
practicing the college yells that may
have grown rusty in the throats of
some of the old grads, and of giving
the visitors a preview of the grounds
and buildings of the 1939 World's
Fair.
Train, bus, and private car ac
commodations will help bring the
crowd down to the Stanford Sta

dium for the contest Saturday.
Singe the game will be the last
this season for both of the teams,
training rules will take a holiday
when the members of the two squads
gather with the Dartmouth and
Stanfoi'd alumnae for the big dance
Saturday night.
The specials will leave the sta
tion with the returning rooters and
players as soon after midnight Sat
urday as practical, going by way of
Los Angeles and the movie satrs.
Many of the vistors, however, in
tend to take the return trip in a
more leisurely fashion, leaving the
city later in the week.
Reports from the players and
coaches, who arrived yesterday and
have been installed in the Family
Club Farm at Woodside, tell of snow
on the ground when they left the
East and the trainers have expressed
some concern over the ability of the
men to do their best in view of the
unaccustomed warmth.
This pessimism probably won't
affect the hilarity of the Dartmouth
visitors. Their team has been beaten
only once this year, a loss to Cor
nell two weeks ago, an& the rooters
are all set to get behind their out
standing all-American candidate
and triple-threat ball packer, Bob
MacLeod, and boost the whole team
to win.

only once this year, a loss to Cor
nell two weeks ago, an& the rooters
are all set to get behind their out
standing all-American candidate
and triple-threat ball packer, Bob
MacLeod, and boost the whole team
to win.
A strange tribe of Indians will
sweep into the state Friday morn
ing when the "Dartmouth Special"
grinds to a halt at the Oakland
terminal.
Praying for a massacre of the
Western Redskin, the Easterners
start on a two-day war dance
around the countryside, ending in a
dinner-dance and peace-pipe con
clave at the Fairmont Hotel on Sat
urday night.
In addition to the train from Bos
ton, two other specials will arrive,
one from Seattle and one from Los
Angeles, bearing rooters to partici
pate in the program arranged by the
Dartmouth Association of Northern
California. Game headquarters are
in the Fairmont Hotel.
Luncheons and sightseeing tours
will mark tho initial stages of the
pow-wow. A big "tribal feast" is
to be held in the Administration
Building on Treasure Island. This
location will serve the double pur
pose of allowing a free rein for
practicing the college yells that may
have grown rusty in the throats of
some of the old grads, and of giving
the visitors a preview of the grounds
and buildings of the 1939 World's
Fair.
Train, bus, and private car ac
commodations will help bring the
crowd down to the Stanford Sta

dium for the contest Saturday.
Singe the game will be the last
this season for both of the teams,
training rules will take a holiday
when the members of the two squads
gather with the Dartmouth and
Stanfoi'd alumnae for the big dance
Saturday night.
The specials will leave the sta
tion with the returning rooters and
players as soon after midnight Sat
urday as practical, going by way of
Los Angeles and the movie satrs.
Many of the vistors, however, in
tend to take the return trip in a
more leisurely fashion, leaving the
city later in the week.
Reports from the players and
coaches, who arrived yesterday and
have been installed in the Family
Club Farm at Woodside, tell of snow
on the ground when they left the
East and the trainers have expressed
some concern over the ability of the
men to do their best in view of the
unaccustomed warmth.
This pessimism probably won't
affect the hilarity of the Dartmouth
visitors. Their team has been beaten
only once this year, a loss to Cor
nell two weeks ago, an& the rooters
are all set to get behind their out
standing all-American candidate
and triple-threat ball packer, Bob
MacLeod, and boost the whole team
