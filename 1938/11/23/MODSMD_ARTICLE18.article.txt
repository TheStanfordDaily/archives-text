# All-American To Take Field For Big Green
## 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Dartmouth's little White Indians
touched Stanford soil for the first,
time since 1930 yesterday and im
mediately swore full revenge upon
our big Red Indians for two pre
vious shellackings.
And the White Indians, victors in
22 straight games in three years
until Cornell upset them by a
single touchdown two weeks ago,
certainly have all the statistics in
their favor. Despite the amazing
gameness shown by Thornhill
coachcd squads in the past two sea
sons, the local tribe has eked out a
bare half-dozen wins in its last 17
games.
Dartmouth came out in 1920 and
lost 28-7 to Washington. They met
Stanford for the first time a decade
later only to lose 14-7. A year later
Stanford rambled way out East
against a great Dartmouth gang and
brought back a 32-6 victory. So
the Earl H. Blaik-tutored Ivy League
perennials have every reason to
want a West Coast victory.
ALL-AMERICAN BACK
Capt. Bob MacLeod, the Green's
already chosen all-American left
half, is considered by some to be
the classiest back on the Eastern
horizon, despite what the New York
scribes say about Sid Luckman and
others. MacLeod weighs in at 190
pounds and is 10 pounds heavier
than any of the other starting sec
ondary.
George Sommers at left tackle and
Jim Parks at right end are the big
boys in the starting eleven at an
even 200 pounds. Their first string
line averages less than 190, consid
erably lighter than Stanford's.
While Dartmouth scouts at the
Big Game expressed much surprise
at the power of Ihe Stanford attack
and predicted a rough afternoon for
the men in Green, they nevertheless
failed to see a scoring punch, a
slight matter of making points which
the Cards seem to have failed to
master.
INJURIES DROP
Bill Paulman returned to the
Stanford line-up last night, in fine
condition and "Corky" Donahue
sneaked out of the Rest Home, but
Freddie Ledeboer's injured shoul
der isn't any better. X-ray shots of
the member showed no breaks; still
the possibilities of his playing much
or any of his last game are ques
tionable.
Hugh Gallarncau went to tho top
team again at. right, half with Pete
Fay priming himself for a full ses
sion this time at left half. The line,
now being rated almost unanimously
as the best in the conference, Ls
intact.

Dartmouth's little White Indians
touched Stanford soil for the first,
time since 1930 yesterday and im
mediately swore full revenge upon
our big Red Indians for two pre
vious shellackings.
And the White Indians, victors in
22 straight games in three years
until Cornell upset them by a
single touchdown two weeks ago,
certainly have all the statistics in
their favor. Despite the amazing
gameness shown by Thornhill
coachcd squads in the past two sea
sons, the local tribe has eked out a
bare half-dozen wins in its last 17
games.
Dartmouth came out in 1920 and
lost 28-7 to Washington. They met
Stanford for the first time a decade
later only to lose 14-7. A year later
Stanford rambled way out East
against a great Dartmouth gang and
brought back a 32-6 victory. So
the Earl H. Blaik-tutored Ivy League
perennials have every reason to
want a West Coast victory.
ALL-AMERICAN BACK
Capt. Bob MacLeod, the Green's
already chosen all-American left
half, is considered by some to be
the classiest back on the Eastern
horizon, despite what the New York
scribes say about Sid Luckman and
others. MacLeod weighs in at 190
pounds and is 10 pounds heavier
than any of the other starting sec
ondary.
George Sommers at left tackle and
Jim Parks at right end are the big
boys in the starting eleven at an
even 200 pounds. Their first string
line averages less than 190, consid
erably lighter than Stanford's.
While Dartmouth scouts at the
Big Game expressed much surprise
at the power of Ihe Stanford attack
and predicted a rough afternoon for
the men in Green, they nevertheless
failed to see a scoring punch, a
slight matter of making points which
the Cards seem to have failed to
master.
INJURIES DROP
Bill Paulman returned to the
Stanford line-up last night, in fine
condition and "Corky" Donahue
sneaked out of the Rest Home, but
Freddie Ledeboer's injured shoul
der isn't any better. X-ray shots of
the member showed no breaks; still
the possibilities of his playing much
or any of his last game are ques
tionable.
Hugh Gallarncau went to tho top
team again at. right, half with Pete
Fay priming himself for a full ses
sion this time at left half. The line,
now being rated almost unanimously
as the best in the conference, Ls
intact.
