# Bears Edge Out Water Dogs, 5 to 4
## Cards Nipped In Over-time Tilt for Crown Water Poloists Drop Conference Crown In Last-minute Tally 
### MORRIS HENDERSON 
Wow! What a game!
Clean shots, lucky goals, solo dash
es, brilliant guarding, an over-time
period, and a thrill a minute —every-
thing was on the program as the
California varsity water poloists
edged out Stanford, 5 to 4. in a thrill
ing game yesterday to annex the
Pacific Coast Conference champion
ship.
Alter Stanford's Harvey Roths
child had forced the game into ex
tra time with a booming long shot
that tied the score in the last 20
seconds of regular playing time,
Ken Wheeler, Bear captain, shoved
one past Goalie Dowling in the mid
dle of the three-minute period to
break up the game. He had pre
viously fired two shots that Dowling
stopped. One floated aimlessly
around the cage, but failed to touch
the back.
In the last minute, Johnny Lamb,
Card captain, tried desperately to
score with several shots, but each
just barely missed. California
thwarted all further Stanford scor
ing by grabbing the ball and keep
ing it away from the Indians in the
last few seconds.
California opened the scoring in
the first two minutes of play when
Forward Cox scored when the In
dians were short-handed with Bob
Plate out of the pool on a foul. After
fighting like mad for another three
minutes, Plate redeemed himself by
dribbling down the center and drop
ping one in to tie the score.
With 45 seconds yet to play in the
first half, Rothschild scored a clean
goal to put Stanford in the lead at
the half-way mark. The Bears were
somewhat handicapped by being
without a goalie at this point. Wood
man was ejected from the game for
hanging onto the cage with his
hands.
Opening the second half, Califor
nia again started the scoring when
the Cards were shoi-t a man. Wheel
er made a free shot after Moreno
had fouled him. After battling up
and down the pool for several min
utes, the Bears jumped into the lead
for the first time when this same
Wheeler scored their first "legiti
mate" goal on his famous scoop shot.
With the boys getting a little tired
near the end of the game, the scores
became more frequent. Jack Loupe
tied up the score with a drop-in

shot. California went ahead again
when Wheeler in the last minute
scored his third goal on a tip-in
shot, and then came Rothschild's
thrilling solo dash and long shot in
the last few seconds.
Rothschild and Plate were out
standing for Stanford. Rothschild
with his two goals and Plate in his
sprint position getting the ball on
every tip-in after a goal. Wheeler
outshone the rest of his team-mates
with his four goals to lead both
teams.
Bab Plate, high-scoring sprint
man of the Stanford varsity water
polo team .was elected captain for
the 1!)39 season at last night's
water polo banquet at the Alpha

every tip-in after a goal. Wheeler
outshone the rest of his team-mates
with his four goals to lead both
teams.

polo team .was elected captain for

Wow! What a game!
Clean shots, lucky goals, solo dash
es, brilliant guarding, an over-time
period, and a thrill a minute —every-
thing was on the program as the
California varsity water poloists
edged out Stanford, 5 to 4. in a thrill
ing game yesterday to annex the
Pacific Coast Conference champion
ship.
Alter Stanford's Harvey Roths
child had forced the game into ex
tra time with a booming long shot
that tied the score in the last 20
seconds of regular playing time,
Ken Wheeler, Bear captain, shoved
one past Goalie Dowling in the mid
dle of the three-minute period to
break up the game. He had pre
viously fired two shots that Dowling
stopped. One floated aimlessly
around the cage, but failed to touch
the back.
In the last minute, Johnny Lamb,
Card captain, tried desperately to
score with several shots, but each
just barely missed. California
thwarted all further Stanford scor
ing by grabbing the ball and keep
ing it away from the Indians in the
last few seconds.
California opened the scoring in
the first two minutes of play when
Forward Cox scored when the In
dians were short-handed with Bob
Plate out of the pool on a foul. After
fighting like mad for another three
minutes, Plate redeemed himself by
dribbling down the center and drop
ping one in to tie the score.
With 45 seconds yet to play in the
first half, Rothschild scored a clean
goal to put Stanford in the lead at
the half-way mark. The Bears were
somewhat handicapped by being
without a goalie at this point. Wood
man was ejected from the game for
hanging onto the cage with his
hands.
Opening the second half, Califor
nia again started the scoring when
the Cards were shoi-t a man. Wheel
er made a free shot after Moreno
had fouled him. After battling up
and down the pool for several min
utes, the Bears jumped into the lead
for the first time when this same
Wheeler scored their first "legiti
mate" goal on his famous scoop shot.
With the boys getting a little tired
near the end of the game, the scores
became more frequent. Jack Loupe
tied up the score with a drop-in

shot. California went ahead again
when Wheeler in the last minute
scored his third goal on a tip-in
shot, and then came Rothschild's
thrilling solo dash and long shot in
the last few seconds.
Rothschild and Plate were out
standing for Stanford. Rothschild
with his two goals and Plate in his
sprint position getting the ball on
every tip-in after a goal. Wheeler
outshone the rest of his team-mates
with his four goals to lead both
teams.
