# Cards to Meet U.S.F. in First Cage Showing
## Dons Invade Pavilion Dec. 2; Fresno State Battles Here, Dec. 3 
### 
Stanford's first basketball parade
of the fast-break and Everett Dean's
| imported Indiana system, with the
varsity successors to the "Laughing
Boys" in the key roles, will be
| launched for public inspection a
week from Friday night, December 2,
against U.S.F., in the Pavilion.
It will be the first of a broken
string of pre-Coast Conference sea
! son basketball games for the Indians,
j who meet the invading Fresno State
I College quintet Saturday night, De
; cember 3, as a follow-up to then
initial test under Dean's tutelage.
So far this season the practice
sessions under the Pavilion's roof
have been limited almost exclusively
Ito concentration on perfecting the
; rudiments of the fundamentals etn
| ployed under Dean's system, which
were used so effectively in the Big
! Ten cage conference in recent years.
After opening afternoon drills
j with intensified fundamentals, the
| cagers have been put through scrim
j mages, stressing both offensive and
j defensive play.
! Dean's outstanding innovation into
| Stanford's attack this season, which
was not so conspicuous with Hank
Luisetti and Company last year, will
' be the fast-break from defensive to
; offensive formations. Teams from
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.. which were
j dazzled by the Hoosiers when they
I played in the south last winter, are
! out to prepare defenses for tying up
this fast-break.
Naming of his varsity and reserve
i basketballers, after cutting off four
j men next week, will be made before
I tackling U.S.F., Dean stated.
