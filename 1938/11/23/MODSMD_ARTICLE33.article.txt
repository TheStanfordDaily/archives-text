red jerseys meet green in
the Stanford stadium next Sat
urday afternoon, more will be at
stake than just the grid supremacy
of two universities.
Western supremacy is at stake in
every contest of the sort, and that
supremacy has been doubtful so far
this year. The East has reigned su
; preme in five major contests: Ala
; bama over Southern California;
i Fordham over Oregon; Fordham
over St. Marys, Wisconsin over U. C.
L. A., and Minnesota over Washing
ton.
Three western teams have saved
our face: Santa Clara over Michigan
State, Southern California over Ohio
State, and U.C.L.A. over lowa. The
! East can safely be given the edge in
at least two out of three remaining
| contests: Southern California-Notre
Dame, California-Georgia Tech. and
the Rose Bowl game.
Bare results will give eastern
football supremacy for li) 38 no
matter who wins Saturday, Red
Indians or White Indians. But if
the Cards were to defeat the Big
Green, the East could not laugh
(iff the fact that one of the finest
; teams it has produced had bowed
| to a representative of the West
that had itself been defeated by
| six of eight opponents on the Pa
cific Coast.
We'd all be glad to have that boast
I when we go east of the Mississippi,
i but that's not enough to stir the Big
! Red Machine to victory.
Like a man who has a really
funny joke to narrate but just
: can't seem to tell it so that people
will laugh, Stanford Indians this
year are absolutely confident that
they have a really fine ball club
—but they can't make the scores
prove it.
! The Big Game has been almost for
| gotten on the practice field this
week, and the thought that is fore
j most in the minds of Card gridders
lis the realization that they have just
one more chance—one more Satur
day to show the world that, "the
] team that might have been' is a team
1 that is.

|IJISTORY has a hard time rc
j pcating itself when it has to
score an upset to do so. but the
| last time Dartmouth invaded the

Stanford Farm, the Big Green
was rated Number One team in
the Eust .and the Cards were ad
mittedly a weak lot. But Stan
ford Indians earned a grand coup
over redskins from back Hanover
way by a 14-7 count. Dartmouth
i was favored again in 1931, when
the-Cards went East, but Stanford
cleaned them up 32-(>.
# s :< :J*.
Hanover Indians boast the best
j backfield in the country, and Bob
j MacLeod, spearhead of Dartmouth's
' offense, has been rated the greatest
i back in the country. Colby Howe
l seems to be the most familiar name
in the Big Green line-up. Newspa
| per accounts of eastern games praise
! the Dartmouth fullback for hi.s bril
i iian open-field running and his skill
! ful performance as safety man, so
1 skillful, in fact, that we have been
advised to tip oft Bill Paulman not
j to kick in Howe's direction.

Certain citizens who have seen
! them both play claim that Dart
! mouth's big center, Bob Gibson, is
ja better all-around pivot man than
! Tony Calvelli. But until Saturday
afternoon, we're from Missouri.

RIG Green Fence. Stanford Cain
pus.—About 30 midgets don
! Ned dark green jerseys and enter
ed the practice field here today un
j der the guise of the Dartmouth In
dians. Most of them look like
Charley McCarthys, and if there
is a 200-pounder in the lot, he
must have eaten lead for lunch.
But their size is all to their
credit. They have been rated as
high as third and no lower than
! sixth among the nation's grid
teams, so they must be plenty
tough and they must really know
I football.
They had warmed up once in
Chicago and came down to the
campus for their first real work
out. They expect to practice twice
a day on Stanford's secret practice
field before the Card workouts and
occasionally in the stadium.
