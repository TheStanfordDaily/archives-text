# Happy Thanksmass

### 
DEAR Babe:
So Thursday is Thanksmass.
And I've done my Thanksmass shopping
early. The shops were nice and full this year.
Thanskmass shopping was easy. I picked up
a dream of a Spanish revolution that had been
sitting around for a couple of years, dirt cheap
at half the price and all covered over with old
cob-webs, Communists, a wonderful Fascist
patina, and reeking with tradition and decaying
bones.
I also ran across, quite by chance, two Ori
ental sabers, with something that looked like
blood on them—probably just spilt rare wine.
Added to the genuine appearance of them
though. And I saw a lot more lying around, all
priced very reasonably at 100 million yen and
20 thousand killed civilians.
Over across the Plaza, in a dear little German
shop, an old Jewish father, white beard and
wearing the fashionable yellow Ghetto badge,
the Star of-David, which has become so popular
in the last few days, led me around through
nooks and corners. After searching around, he
finally dug out the sweetest little casket, all
filled with certificates of protective arrest and
confiscation of property. They dated way back
to 1933—a true collector's relic.
Then, up the street a little way, I stepped in
for a moment at the Labor Shoppe, where they
still have the delightful custom of afternoon
tea. They don't expect you to buy anything,
just act as if you dropped in for a moment of
chat and picketing. There were the duckiest
people sitting there, talking. One old gentle
man offered to take me to a place where I could
pick up some old bandages from a picket fight,
and he said if I were lucky, I might be able to
persuade some of the people there to tell me
the old legends about when labor and capital
got along together. I would have gone in a
minute, but just then Harriet came in and told
me about finding a genuine replica of a Town
sendite, complete with long hair and the typ
ical (but rarely found) tin cup.
So after sipping my tea and thanking the
natives, I hurried down across town to that
musty old corner of the city called the Farm,
which still preserves the qualities it possessed
simply ages and ages ago.
The people seem so carefree down there.
They never go out to buy anything, and when
I showed one of them all the lovely things
which I had picked up, they didn't seem at
all interested. I guess they don't celebrate
Thanksmass down there.
Well, anyhow, because they don't do any
Thanksmass shopping, I managed to have a
buyer's paradise as long as my money held
out. I looked in one of the weather shops, and
it didn't take me a minute to find some simply
perfect fall sunshine, and not a sign that it
had ever been out in the rain. I tried to pre
tend that I was used to looking at stuff like
that, and I managed to get ;t dirt cheap.
Then a little further along, I discovered some
old buildings, just thrown out as if the people
didn't want them anymore. I got them too, for
a song. And thrown in with it, I picked up
some very fine professors, a whole library of
books, and a Boathouse that didn't even have
the price-tag taken off.
I had a terrible time not appearing excited
about them. But all the people in the Farm
didn't even seem to care if I got them for
nothing; they acted glad to get rid of them,
instead of trying to raise the price because
they thought I was just another tourist.
Well, after I finally spent every cent I had,
I went home, tired to death. Honestly, you can't
imagine what a relief it was to get my Thanks
mass shopping over.
It was so much easier this year than last.
The shops were so full of nice things, and, my
dear, stumbling across the Farm, with all those
wonderful gifts just lying around, was a God
send, no less.
Well, write soon, and Happy Thanksmass.
Love,
N MAZIE.
