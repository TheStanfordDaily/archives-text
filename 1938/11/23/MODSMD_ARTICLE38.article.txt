HUSTLED to the old Farm, out in Woodside,
as soon as they arrived, Stanford has not
yet had much of a mirror look at the Eastern
tribe of Indians. But they will Sat
urday, when the curtain drops on the 1938 Card
football season.
In the meantime, Dartmouth supporters will
be drifting in to the campus, will be made wel
come as honored guests. Beautiful row and
hall girls will don their best to step out with
the Eastern contingent, houses and clubs will
put an extra plate or two down for dinner.

In usual Farm style, the gates will be open.
But the welcome Dartmouth receives dur
ing the next three days will be far warmer
than that to greet it after the kick-off Saturday.
When Indians go on the warpath, peace-pipes
are not in order.
After Stanford's phenomenal game last
week-end, the highly-touted Dartmouth outfit
may expect a scalping attack which would
take the hair off any team. Great as it was, the
Cards' Big Game showing was not a peak.
Piling up strength bit by bit throughout the last
three games, the Big Game was only the be
ginning.
So Saturday, the welcome to Dartmouth will
be a fine oneâ€”the right hand outstretched
firmly in the old Indian manner.
But in the left, behind Stanford's back, will
be clenched a mighty fine replica of the Axe
which California still possesses.
And it won't be used to chop weeds with.
