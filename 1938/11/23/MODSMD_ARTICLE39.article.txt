### JOHN COBBS 
NOT ONE CENT I OR TRIBUTE

Manager Tom Killefer was a little ruf
fled when I called on him yesterday. He emerged
from a drift of papers, shook himself like a retriever
getting the water out of his coat, and acknowledged my
Thanksgiving greetings with an absent rattle of the
larynx. "And a happy Thanksgiving to you. Sit down
and help me be very grateful for $200 in bills for
Bonfire damages."
I asked what Bonfire damages in a sympathetic tone.
Tom made soft growling noises, like a lioness who
sees her cubs kicked around, and then he sailed into
the story.
It seems that each year after the Bonfire the A.S.S.U.
has to stand up under a heavy bombardment of com
plaints about damages done in gathering material.
Every fall some good burgher finds that an indis
pensable outhouse has been removed, or that a gate
essential to the safety of his property has vanished.
And so he sends the bill to Stanford, prepared to
entrench himself behind the Layman's Legal Guide.
* # * *
This year the barrage is even heavier than usual,
which is rather peculiar because extreme precautions
were taken 'to be sure that no contraband went into
the Bonfire. Throughout the day the pyre was built,
campus cops waited about the lake examining the
wood brought in and appraising it in terms of legality.
Commtitees and wood collecting squads had special in
structions to take material only with the owners'
permission.
And yet the bills for damages amount to $200; even
if you figure in the sentimental value, it takes a lot of
gates to add up to that. The law of evidence backs up
the law of averages in declaring that some of the
claims are simply attempted highway robbery.
* * * *
'T'HE tradition has grown up in past years that the
Bonfire is a sort of grab-bag for local property
owners. The University always jumps like a neurotic
girl at the idea of unfavorable publicity, and so it
hits paid off all claims that weren't obviously piracy.
As a result, Palo Alto has built up the idea that Stanford
will play fairy godmother after each Bonfire.
Some of the claims are valid, of course. And the
frosh will need more than a snickering, boys-will-be
boys apology to avoid the blame. In the rush and
excitement we can't expect perfect discrimination be
tween obsolete gates and those that are the showpieces
of the estate. But there is no reason why we should
lay ourselves open to charges of plundering like a
conquering army.
# * 3(t *
But even if the frosh had razed the town some of
the bills would be illegitimate. And most of them
would still be over-valued. It is amazing how the
price of scrap-wood jumps when it is itemized.
We love the good villagers, of course. But Stanford
does not administer the Federal Housing Project's
funds. And it is too early in the year to play Santa
Claus.

from a drift of papers, shook himself like a retriever
getting the water out of his coat, and acknowledged my
Thanksgiving greetings with an absent rattle of the
larynx. "And a happy Thanksgiving to you. Sit down
and help me be very grateful for $200 in bills for
Bonfire damages."
I asked what Bonfire damages in a sympathetic tone.
Tom made soft growling noises, like a lioness who
sees her cubs kicked around, and then he sailed into
the story.
It seems that each year after the Bonfire the A.S.S.U.
has to stand up under a heavy bombardment of com
plaints about damages done in gathering material.
Every fall some good burgher finds that an indis
pensable outhouse has been removed, or that a gate
essential to the safety of his property has vanished.
And so he sends the bill to Stanford, prepared to
entrench himself behind the Layman's Legal Guide.

This year the barrage is even heavier than usual,
which is rather peculiar because extreme precautions
were taken 'to be sure that no contraband went into
the Bonfire. Throughout the day the pyre was built,
campus cops waited about the lake examining the
wood brought in and appraising it in terms of legality.
Commtitees and wood collecting squads had special in
structions to take material only with the owners'
permission.
And yet the bills for damages amount to $200; even
if you figure in the sentimental value, it takes a lot of
gates to add up to that. The law of evidence backs up
the law of averages in declaring that some of the
claims are simply attempted highway robbery.
* * * *
'T'HE tradition has grown up in past years that the
Bonfire is a sort of grab-bag for local property
owners. The University always jumps like a neurotic
girl at the idea of unfavorable publicity, and so it
hits paid off all claims that weren't obviously piracy.
As a result, Palo Alto has built up the idea that Stanford
will play fairy godmother after each Bonfire.
Some of the claims are valid, of course. And the
frosh will need more than a snickering, boys-will-be
boys apology to avoid the blame. In the rush and
excitement we can't expect perfect discrimination be
tween obsolete gates and those that are the showpieces
of the estate. But there is no reason why we should
lay ourselves open to charges of plundering like a
conquering army.
# * 3(t *
But even if the frosh had razed the town some of
the bills would be illegitimate. And most of them
would still be over-valued. It is amazing how the
price of scrap-wood jumps when it is itemized.
We love the good villagers, of course. But Stanford
does not administer the Federal Housing Project's
funds. And it is too early in the year to play Santa
Claus.
