### DOUG JAQUES 
JF YOU noticed, the regular drum major was carry
ing an axe rather than a baton at the game Satur
day. Everyone .said, "Yea, it's Big Game. Give 'cm the
axe. So he cai*ries an axe. Well—yes."
It was nothing like that. Hp, carried the axe be
cause: (a) He lost his baton, (b) The band is very
patriotic toward their drum major.
When he got on the train, he didn't have his baton;
he hadn't been able to find it. Some of the band knew
this. "My God, our drum major can't go to the Big
Game without a baton," they said. "We'll get him a
baton."
They went back in the baggage car. You wouldn't
believe it, but there right in front of them was a nice
new axe in a glass case. As one man the guys who
had gone to look for a baton started to reach for that
axe.
"Wait!" someone shouted. 'This has gotta lx' on
the up and up. The sign says, 'Take only in case of
fire'."
So they built a small fire. This was going lo be on
the up and up.
This happened as they were getting into the city.
For some reason some of the train officials began get
ting a little suspicious. They went back looking for
the guys in the baggage car just as they were getting
off the train. Quite a few of the band boys were out
side waiting for them to get off, and when they did
they all crowded in together to hide the axe.
A couple of the conductors came up to them.
"Have you got one of our axes?"
"No, of course not. We're from Stanford. Cal's got
all the axes. Have you looked there?" That, at least,
was the gist of what they told the conductor, and then
a couple of the guys started up the cry that someone
was still asleep way up at the front part of the train
and hadn't they better get them ofT.
The somewhat baffled chief conductor went off to
get A Person of! the train, but he told one of his side
condutcors to get the axe. They've got one of our
axes.
The band boys by this time were over across the
street waiting to get on the street car. The drum major
had the axe.
This sub-conductor came over to him—and was very
surprised and pleased to find the drum major was an
old high school pal of his.
They talked of this and that, and then the conductor
asked, "Say, have you got one of our axes?"
"Yeah, here it is," the drum major said.
"That s what I m looking for," the conductor said.
And wont off and told thr brad conductor that thosr
Stanford boys had no axe. Where would they get an
axe?

all the axes. Have you looked there?" That, at least,
was the gist of what they told the conductor, and then
a couple of the guys started up the cry that someone
was still asleep way up at the front part of the train
and hadn't they better get them ofT.
The somewhat baffled chief conductor went off to
get A Person of! the train, but he told one of his side
condutcors to get the axe. They've got one of our
axes.
The band boys by this time were over across the
street waiting to get on the street car. The drum major
had the axe.
This sub-conductor came over to him—and was very
surprised and pleased to find the drum major was an
old high school pal of his.
They talked of this and that, and then the conductor
asked, "Say, have you got one of our axes?"
"Yeah, here it is," the drum major said.
"That s what I m looking for," the conductor said.
And wont off and told thr brad conductor that thosr
Stanford boys had no axe. Where would they get an
axe?
JF YOU noticed, the regular drum major was carry
ing an axe rather than a baton at the game Satur
day. Everyone .said, "Yea, it's Big Game. Give 'cm the
axe. So he cai*ries an axe. Well—yes."
It was nothing like that. Hp, carried the axe be
cause: (a) He lost his baton, (b) The band is very
patriotic toward their drum major.
When he got on the train, he didn't have his baton;
he hadn't been able to find it. Some of the band knew
this. "My God, our drum major can't go to the Big
Game without a baton," they said. "We'll get him a
baton."
They went back in the baggage car. You wouldn't
believe it, but there right in front of them was a nice
new axe in a glass case. As one man the guys who
had gone to look for a baton started to reach for that
axe.
"Wait!" someone shouted. 'This has gotta lx' on
the up and up. The sign says, 'Take only in case of
fire'."
So they built a small fire. This was going lo be on
the up and up.
This happened as they were getting into the city.
For some reason some of the train officials began get
ting a little suspicious. They went back looking for
the guys in the baggage car just as they were getting
off the train. Quite a few of the band boys were out
side waiting for them to get off, and when they did
they all crowded in together to hide the axe.
A couple of the conductors came up to them.
"Have you got one of our axes?"
"No, of course not. We're from Stanford. Cal's got
all the axes. Have you looked there?" That, at least,
was the gist of what they told the conductor, and then
a couple of the guys started up the cry that someone
was still asleep way up at the front part of the train
and hadn't they better get them ofT.
