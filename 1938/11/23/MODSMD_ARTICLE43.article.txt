# FROM THE MEN:

The Editor, Sir:
Did your "date" letter bring any
response? Probably not. Why? The
men on the campus have expressed
the opinion that this year's "crop"
of Robleites has been struck by men
tal inflation.
P.S.: What about a "crossword
puzzle?
'39, '40', '41

Dear Editor:
It sebms that certain girls in this '
school, namely the Class of '42, think j
that they are qualified to change the'
place simply because they don't ap- i

prove of certain things. Stanford got
along pretty well before they "ma
triculated" here and will do pretty
well after they are gone. We are
terribly sorry the band doesn't
; please them and, in reference to their
j letter of a week or so back, this still
| isn't a "date heaven" for wall
j flowers.
I know of quite a few girls in
! Roble who don't complain of the
date situation. Wc, the men of '39,
'40, and '41, still pride ourselves
somewhat on our choice of dates.
After all, you know, selection is a
natural process.
'39, '40. '41
P.S.: The women of '39, '40, '41 still
j seem pretty good.
