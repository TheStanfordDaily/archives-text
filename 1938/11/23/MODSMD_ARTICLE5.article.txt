# Rosten Predicts Anglo-German Clash
## 
### 
"England and Germany will soon meet head-on, and British foreign
policy may lead to the ultimate sacrifice of Great Britain and even the
entire Empire," warned Leo C. Rosten, author, lecturer, and political ob
server of the international scene, who last night addressed a large audi
ence in Memorial Hall auditorium.
"Great Britain has what Germany wants and, by forcing central
European powers to surrender their possessions to Hitler, she has given
the Reich greater strength with which to fight," asserted the author, who

spoke on '"What the Well
Man Should Know about World
Politics" at a program of the Tues
day Evening Series.
Characterizing Adolf Hitler as a
"paranoid personality" whose de
mands it is impossible to satisfy,
Mr. Rosten explained that the very
act of accepting his ultimatums gives
the Nazi dictator the feeling of
righteous persecution and leads him
to issue fresh demands. "The more
Hitler gets, the more he wants," the
speaker declared.
OLD DIPLOMACY DEAD
"In the past, these paranoid per
sonalities were forced to conform
to civilization, while today civiliza
tion Is being made to conform to
the will of diseased minds," asserted
the author. "The old orthodox di
plomacy is dead. What we need to
day is good political psychiatrists."
The clash between strong wills
and stubborn personalities in Eu
rope today was described by Mi-.
Rosten as a "war." "Authorities
have asked if civilization can sur
vive the next war. The real ques
tion is, "Can civilization survive the
present war, for we are having a
war. Traditions have been brushed
aside, methods are different, but the
war exists nevertheless."
Discussing the recent four power
agreement of Munich, the author
declared that "Chamberlain did not
secure a peace; he merely got 'time
out,' for the whistle is about to blow
and the deadly game will soon be
resumed."
Neville Chamberlain, according to
Mr. Rosten, is "the greatest" English
| statesman since the Loch Ness sea
monster. The policy of the British
Prime Minister is one of realism â€”
find out what your enemy wants, and
then give it to him," the speaker
stated, explaining that "what your
enemy wants is defined as im
perialism, but what you want is
merely foreign politics."
URGES JAPAN BOYCOTT
That a strict economic boycott of
Japan, including the halting of the
exportation of munitions, should be
effected is the opinion of the author,
who believes that, on the basis of the
nine-power pact, the United States
should not aid Nippon in breaking
the agreement to which America is
a signatory. "We must not run the
risk of a military allegiance or al
liance with any power," declared
the speaker.
Warning his listeners that Amer
ica is being bombarded with vicious
propaganda of which it must beware,
Mr. Rosten asserted that "we in
I the United States are being sub
jected to all manner of appeals. W c
must never forget, however, that if
we get into a war, no matter what
the basis or the reasons, there is no
assurance that we shall come out of
it with our system of democracy
intact."
"Give each man vested interests,
a stake in democracy," urged the
author. "If social security and social
health programs are viewed as de
fense measures, your democratic au
dience will become a democratic
army. Any man will fight to defend
his home, but who ever heard of a
man fighting to defend his boarding
house."
CONTROL MONOPOLIES
Mr. Rosten believes that the po
litical power represented by the
control of nautral economic monop
olies must not be concentrated in
the hands of private enterprise, and
that governmental administration of
these monopolies is inevitable and
necessary.
"The problem of dealing with com
plex national problems will neces
i sitate the control of natural monop
olies, such as coal, oil, and the util
ities, by the federal government,"
the author concluded.

j sor of political science, introduced
