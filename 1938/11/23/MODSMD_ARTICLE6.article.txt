# Correspondent Discusses New Reporting Slant
## Leo Rosten Speaks Before Journalists At Luncheon Meeting 
### 
"The line between pugilism and
journalism is very thin," Leo C. Ros
ten, author and lecturer, told 40 stu
dents who attended a luncheon in
his honor yesterday in the Union.
"The newspapers come out with
'ICKES LASHES AT PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION,' when lekes,
asked what he thought of a proposed
bridge, has said he thinks it's about
time one is built there," he told the
students.
Speaking at. a luncheon sponsored
by Sigma Delta Chi and Theta Sigma
Phi, respectively men's and women's
journalistic fraternities, Mr. Rosten
gave most of his discussion to news
paper work in Washington, D.C.
ANGLE' NEW IDEA
Press conferences and hand-outs
have changed newspaper methods in
Washington, he pointed out.
"Competition has been shifted," he
said, "from scooping in time to
scooping in interpretation. Now they
break their necks to get an angle."
Until recently seniority has been
a big consideration in filling corre
spondents' positions in Washington,
he explained, so that there is a con
siderable group of men over 40 who
"are stand-offish and write with a
misleading judicial attitude "
BETTER TRAINING
"The younger me»," he said, "who
have been sent to the capitol after
a particularly good job of reporting,
are less easily buffaloed, and have
been trained more completely in the
social sciences. They haven't built
up a scries of professional reflexes
like the older men."
Typical of these older journalists,
he said, was a correspondent who
admitted he was utterly bewildered
by such terms as "crop control,
monetary devaluation, and collective
bargainin."
With only a grammar school edu
cation, this man spent most of his
time attacking or defending person
alities, incidentally doing a good job
of it.
ADDS PRESTIGE
One reason a publisher wants a
Washington correspondent, is for the
prestige value, according to Mr. Ros
ten, explaining the publisher then
can pass along such confidential
stories as Secretary Perkins' being
secretly engaged to Harry Bridges,
or President Roosevelt's being ac
cused of stealing rare stamps from
his friends.
Engaged at. present in a study of
Hollywood correspondents, Mr. Ros
ten pointed out that the film capital
has the largest number of newspa
per men in the United States next to
Washington.
"Hollywood represents the last
stronghold of America's Horatio Al
ger dream—that you can get to the
top if you try," he said. "A stenog
rapher reads that. Joan Crawford
has freckles and says, "They put
make-up on Joan; why can't they do
it to me?'"

Engaged at. present in a study of
Hollywood correspondents, Mr. Ros
ten pointed out that the film capital
has the largest number of newspa
per men in the United States next to
Washington.
"Hollywood represents the last
stronghold of America's Horatio Al
ger dream—that you can get to the
top if you try," he said. "A stenog
rapher reads that. Joan Crawford
has freckles and says, "They put
make-up on Joan; why can't they do
it to me?'"
"The line between pugilism and
journalism is very thin," Leo C. Ros
ten, author and lecturer, told 40 stu
dents who attended a luncheon in
his honor yesterday in the Union.
"The newspapers come out with
'ICKES LASHES AT PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION,' when lekes,
asked what he thought of a proposed
bridge, has said he thinks it's about
time one is built there," he told the
students.
Speaking at. a luncheon sponsored
by Sigma Delta Chi and Theta Sigma
Phi, respectively men's and women's
journalistic fraternities, Mr. Rosten
gave most of his discussion to news
paper work in Washington, D.C.
ANGLE' NEW IDEA
Press conferences and hand-outs
have changed newspaper methods in
Washington, he pointed out.
"Competition has been shifted," he
said, "from scooping in time to
scooping in interpretation. Now they
break their necks to get an angle."
Until recently seniority has been
a big consideration in filling corre
spondents' positions in Washington,
he explained, so that there is a con
siderable group of men over 40 who
"are stand-offish and write with a
misleading judicial attitude "
BETTER TRAINING
"The younger me»," he said, "who
have been sent to the capitol after
a particularly good job of reporting,
are less easily buffaloed, and have
been trained more completely in the
social sciences. They haven't built
up a scries of professional reflexes
like the older men."
Typical of these older journalists,
he said, was a correspondent who
admitted he was utterly bewildered
by such terms as "crop control,
monetary devaluation, and collective
bargainin."
With only a grammar school edu
cation, this man spent most of his
time attacking or defending person
alities, incidentally doing a good job
of it.
ADDS PRESTIGE
One reason a publisher wants a
Washington correspondent, is for the
prestige value, according to Mr. Ros
ten, explaining the publisher then
can pass along such confidential
stories as Secretary Perkins' being
secretly engaged to Harry Bridges,
or President Roosevelt's being ac
cused of stealing rare stamps from
his friends.
