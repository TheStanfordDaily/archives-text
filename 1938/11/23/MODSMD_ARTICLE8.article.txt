# 'Exterminate Non-Aryans,' Shout Nazis
## Neville Chamberlain Suggests Tanganyika Become Jew Colony 
### 
BERLIN, Nov. 22 (UP). â€” Das
Schwarz Korps, organ of Chancellor
Adolf Hitler's elite storm troops,
tonight predicted the "physical ex
termination" of Jews if any remain
in Germany after final enforcement
of the government's anti-Semitic
measures.
Propaganda Minister Paul Joseph
Goebbels tonight summoned Nazi
party leaders to a secret meeting to
plan intensified anti-Semitism and to
whip up nation-wide wrath against
the United States and Great Britain.
The secret session convened as the
Nazi press lashed out angrily at a
proposal, announced by British
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
in the House of Commons, to settle
thousands of the Reich's 700,000
Jews in the former German colony
of Tanganyika.
Hitler, at Berchtesgaden, was said
to be angered by Chamberlain's
statements regarding Tanganyika and
the unanimously-adopted motion in
the House of Commons condemning
the "deplorable treatment" of Ger
man Jews.
Informed Nazis discounted Lon
don reports, however, that Hitler
was preparing to recall his ambas
sador to London, Herbert Von Dirk
sen.
The Anglo-American plan to re
settle the Jews in what was German
East Africa before Britain took it
from Germany after the World War
was described as an insult, because
the Nazis claim the colony is "le
gally and morally" theirs.
The newspaper Nachtausgable
said Britain and the United States
were playing imperialistic politics,
attempting to thwart Chancellor
Adolf Hitler's demands for ret urn of
Tanganyika and the other war-lost
German colonies.
