# Stunts Set For Game
## 
### 
The most colorful welcome seen at
Stanford in many yearsAvill be giv
en this Saturday when the Dart
mouth Indians meet the Stanford In
dians in the Stadium.
Elaborate cards stunts have been
pjanned by Jack Laney and Didi Vi
bert, Rally Committee heads, to
show Dartmouth the football color
for which the West is famed.
The stunts will feature Dart
mouth traditions and history. One
stunt will tell the story of the found
ing of Dartmouth by Eleazer Whecl
ock, who set out to teach Indians with
500 galjons of rum. Now there is
only one Indian each year at Dart
mouth.
Another stunt will show a Stan
ford Indian pounding a sword, which
is the Dartmouth symbol, until the
sword turns into an axe. In addi
tion, the band is learning the song
of the eastern college and will play
it during the half. It is expected
that the Glee Club will sing with the
band.
Since there will not be many stu
dents on the campus for the game,
the rooting section will be mixed
and the women will help with the
card stunts. Both men and women
have been asked by Rally Commit
tee to wear white shirts. Men will
wear rooters' caps and women carry
pom-pons.
