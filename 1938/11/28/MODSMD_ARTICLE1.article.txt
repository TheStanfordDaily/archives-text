# Hitler Pays Professors Nazi Tribute
## Dr. Wilbur Slams German Medal Award To Lutz, Cooper 
### 
Two Stanford professors, Dr. Wil
liam Alpha Cooper, emeritus profes
sor of German, and Professor Ralph
Lutz, history department and dean
of graduate study, last week received
the Order of Merit of the German
Eagle.
Although the awards reputedly
were conferred by Adolf Hitler on
Wednesday, no official notification
yet has reached Stanford's two pro
fessors. At the same time, William
Lawrence Montgomery, foreign trade
department head of the San Fran
cisco Chamber of Commerce, re
ceived his second class medal, with
four swastikas and four eagles, lute
in September.
Reports from Berlin gave no rea
son for the award. Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, however, called the gesture
"an attempt by Hitler to look for
friends." Dr. Cooper, ill at the time
news of the award reached him, did
not wish to comment until he had
received offiical notification. Pro
fessor Lutz has been away, will not
return until some time today.
The award given to Professor
Emeritus Cooper was of the first or
der, that conferred upon Professor
Lutz, second order. Dr. Cooper has
been active in the past in the study
oi Germanic culture; his family said
they believed it was for this study
that the award may have been
made.
At the same time, other university
professors throughout the United
States were conferred the awards.
Included were Professor Karl
Geiser of Oberlin; Karl Krueger,
Springfield, Ohio; F. W. Elven, Fritz
Hailer, and F. C. Miller.
