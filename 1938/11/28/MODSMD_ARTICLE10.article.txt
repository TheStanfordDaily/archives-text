# Kicked-Around Red Roller Upholds Coast Supremacy
## Statistics Finally Prove Stanford Football Triumph 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
Stanford is laughing lastâ€”and not up Its sleeve.
For weeks the Indian has had a joke to tell, hut
until last Saturday he iu.st couldn't seem to tell it
i so that anyone would laugh. It was a story about
j si-ores and statistics; lie had won lots of football
J games, but the scores didn't prove it.
But he finished his 15K58 season in a blaze of glory,
i not only with a grand coup for bis own war bonnet
| but a triumph for western football. Despite a hoped
j for western supremacy, casual observers did not ex
i pcct Stanford, rotting in the conference cellar, to
vouch for it against one of the best grid combinations
the East could produce, a team rated up and down
I the ladder from third to sixth among the nation's
| teams.
Card gridders didn't know it couldn't be done, so
they did it. And now westerners can go east of the
j Mississippi with chest out and a smile from ear to
ear. Where basketball was the only safe topic last
I . year, we'll have plenty to say now when they start
i talking football.
Coach Tiny Thornhill's worry this year has been
one of bad breaks and injuries. Nobody needs to
beef, but it is comforting to think that fortune's

wheel wouldn't, have had to tip far*
to bring $(50,000 Rose Bowl profits
to Stanford B.A.C. coffers. The
team that, defeated Dartmouth Sat- |
urday and outstatisticked California i
the week before could, with an even
chance, have taken every opponent
to the cleaners.
This is easy to say now, and you
are wondering whether it would
have held true when the Big
Red Machine was matched with
the Southern California Trojans,
the only conference team that
distinctly outplayed the Indians.
Well, that game would have told the
tale, and it is more than conceivable i
that the added advantage of a first- :
string backfield and even breaks j
would have made the difference.
DETERMINED CLUB
So you don't have to stretch your
neck searching for a silver lining to
convince yourself that the Big Red
Edition for 1938 Ls one to be proud
of. For nine weeks you've been i
watching one of the best, bunches of
gridders that, has ever appeared at
Stanford, and on top of sheer grid
talent, they have shown determina
tion and comeback spirit that will
seldom be matched in gridiron his
tory.
Everybody connected with Stan
ford football can dust off his hands
with the coniidence that he has done
a good job, and falc alone should
take the rap if there isn't a con
ference crown on the Indian's head
or a chromium-plated axe in his
hand.
