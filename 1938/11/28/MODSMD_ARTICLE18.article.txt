# Win Over Nation's No. 3 Grid Team Aids Thornhill
## 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Tiny Thornhill can once again stick his tongue
out at a snarling pack of aliunni wolves and back
biting sports scribes.
For Tiny knows from tin- distant jmsl that the
wolves and gentlemen of the press do not often
heckle a coach who fields a team as good a* the
Stanford aggregation which thoroughly cleaned up
on Dartmouth last Saturday, 2\\ to 13.
Mayl>e the wolf pack never was very serious about
the Thornhill situation anyway, but none of them
would dare yap again after the games of the Inttt
two weeks.
Dartmouth came out as one of the strongest clubs
in the entire Eastern area. Stanford had only been
beaten six times including a loss in the Big Game
for the third year running. Odds went as high as 2
to 1 that the White Indians in green would slaugh
ter the injury- ridden, uninspired Redmen.
All Stanford did was to put on the best exhibi
tion seen on the West Coast this year. The Red In
dians had drive, a clever passing and running attack,
a pretty consistent defense, and something unseen
hereabouts since the Vow Boy regime—wide-awake
field generalship.

► Nobody has tried to dispute the
fact that Capt. Bob MacLeod of
Dartmouth was the nearest thing to
an in-the-flesh all-American half
back that we Westerners have seen.
MacLeod alone made over 120 yards
on pass-catching and the resultant
runs, this despite the fact that Stan
ford has a supposedly difficult aerial
defense.
He was equally brilliant on the
ground though no more sensational
there than his working mate, Hutch
inson. Hutchinson was on the throw
ing end of most of the Dartmouth
passes and was a virtual stand-off
with Bill Paulman in a masterful
punting duel. Paulman averaged
43.4 on his boots while Hutchinson
was slightly under his mark with
42.8.
When it comes to picking the out
standing plays and players, you
have to pick from an assortment as
great as the Stanford squad. Every
thing Stanford did was good. Dart
mouth was Simply playing a superior
foe in a tougher league.
PAULMAN BRILLIANT
Maybe the richest palm of all
should go to Bill Paulman, who in
his last Stanford game put. on just
about the finest show of his bril
liant but injury-infested career.
Paulman was the team captain and
called plays besides passing, run
ning, and kicking. His quartet back
ing on the goal line twice and dur
ing Stanford's 70-yard sustained
drive for the third touchdown
makes Vic Botlari look like a half
back on the Delta Gamma touch
football team.
If if. wasn't Paulman who was the
hero, maybe it was Norm Standleo
booming down the middle or Around
end, making holes for himself when
his line couldn't split Dartmouth. J.f
Standlce had been given the same
opportunities in the Big Game, es
jpecially in deep territory, the Stan
i ford players wouldn't all lx> bank-
I rupl today.
By West certainly played his fin
est gamp and topped off his last act
with a 20-yard touchdown run after
a lateral from Pete Fay. Had Wesf
not broken loose, Dartmouth, with
I MacLeod and Hutchinson as dan
gerous break-away artists, might
i have scored first and demoralized
i the Rods.
THEY'RE TOPS
Corky Donahue, Hamp Pool, and
Pete Zagar were tops. Donahue in
tercepted a pass that set up the In
dians' first offensive, while Pool
recovered a fumble from his roving
guard spot that paved flu- way for
the second thrust.
When Tony Calvelli was forced
out at, center and slow but persist
ent Wally DeWitt replaced him,
