### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
anti-war negotiations
with Germany are in danger. In
a nation-wide radio speech last
night, Premier Daladier accused la
borites and leftists of calling a one
day general strike Wednesday to
upset his move for Franco-German
peace.
II Daladier can break the strike
with military forces and conscript
ed workers, he probably will de
mand emergency powers which
will make him a virtual dictator.
In his speech he warned that un
less internal order is restored im
mediately the nation will be ex
tremely vulnerable at a crucial
time and an easy victim for an
enemy attack.
Labor's attack on the extension of
the 40-hour week under the new re
form decrees was classed by the
Premier as mass action to crush the
government. The general strike was
not called until the announcement
was made that France would sign a
no-more-war agreement with Ger
many in Paris this week.

The remarkably strong constitu
tion of I'ope Tilts XI has brought
him through another crisis. After
collapsing from a heart attack last
Friday, he had recovered Milli
ciently yesterday to address 400
Hungarian pilgrims for 10 minutes
after seating himself on the papal
throne without any aid.
He was described as looking pale,
but his motions were strong and un
hesitating. The entire Christian
world feared for the pontiff's life in
this latest of a series of acute ill
nesses. His death would have been
a serious blow to world peace under
present condition of international
unrest.

ACCUSED of being vicious and
un-American, in his radio
.speech on Nazi persecution of Jews
a week ago Sunday, Father Cough
-lin yesterday repeated a portion of
the address and asked his audience
to judge for itself.
Claiming that he has been the
victim of a campaign of misrep
resentation, the priest stated that
he did not defend Nazi outrages
against the Jews, hut did attack
and will continue to attack sup
porters of communism. Father
Coughlin cited the close connec
tion of Jews with communism in
Germany and their high state po
sitions in Soviet Russia.
President Roosevelt studied the
problem of religious persecution in
absolutist nations yesterday as he
conferred with Hugh Wilson, re
called ambassador to Germany, and
Wililam Phillips, ambassador to
Italy.
The United States' relations with
such governments will probably be
determined by conclusions express
ed by the diplomats on the present
European intolerance not only
toward Jews, but toward Catholics
and Protestants.
£ j}CCLPYIN( » the Slovak re
gions ceded to Poland in the
redrafting of the map of Europe
that followed the Munich pact.
Polish troops clashed with Czech
soldiers yesterday in the Javorina
district of northern Slovakia. Sev
eral were killed and wounded on
both sides. Surrender of the area
was set for December I. but Pol
and has announced it will occupy
the region ahead of schedule be
cause of Slovak "provocations."

United States military outposts,
especially the Panama Canal, are
glaringly weak, according to the an
nual report of Secretary of War
Harry H. Woodring. He recommend
ed fo President Roosevelt last night
a "protective mobilization plan"
which will provide for a strong de
fensive army and fortifications at
the Panama Canal and unlimited
supplies of war material at all gar
risons of outlying defenses.
Anxiety of the administration over
present world unrest is reflected in
Woodring's recommendation, which
complements Roosevelt's one-hem
isphere defense policy which will
probably be endorsed by the Latin-
American nations at the forthcoming
Pan-American Congress at Lima,
Peru.
