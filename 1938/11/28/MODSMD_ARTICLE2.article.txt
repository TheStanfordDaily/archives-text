# Premier Says Strike Blocks Peace Policy
## 
### 
PARIS. Nov. 27 (UP). â€”Premier'
Edouard Daladicr in a nation-wide
radio appeal tonight accused French
labor and leftists of calling a one
day general strike for next Wednes
day in an attempt to upset his
"policy of peace," particularly his
anti-war delegation with Germany.
"Next Wednesday will be a test
of strength between a proletarian
dictatorship and a legal govern
ment," he told France's 42,000,000
people.
Observers believed Daladier might
seek to establish himself as a vir
tual dictator, at. least temporarily,
over the internal troubles if he can
break the 24-hour strike wtih mili
tary forces and conscripted workers.
lie asserted in his radio appeal
that labor's attack on the extension
of the 40-hour week under the gov
ernment's new reform decrees was
a subterfuge for political motives
intended to "unleash mass action
against the government and force it
to capitulate by force."
Daladicr made his appeal after
decreeing military requisition of all
principal railroads and utilities in a
counter-move to the order of the
general confederation of labor call
ing out its 5,000,000 members in a
strike designed to paralyze national
life for 24 hours.
The Federal Workers' Federation
announced it would defy efforts to
operate the lines with army and navy
engineers.
