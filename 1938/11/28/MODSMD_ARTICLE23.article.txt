Headed by a 101 per cent sub
scription by the Firehouse crew, who
took out an additional membership
for their mascot, Prince, the Red
Cross roll call of non-student cam
pus residents has reached a total of
$450, according to Dr. C. A. Duliway,
chairman.
Workers in the University Press,
Convalescent Home, Palo Alto Hos
pital, Administration Building, libra
ry, and 8.A.C., as well as faculty
and other non-student residents,
were canvassed by the 20 collectors
working under Dr. Duliway.
