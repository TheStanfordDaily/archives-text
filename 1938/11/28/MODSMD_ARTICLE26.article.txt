NEW YORK. Nov. 27 (UP).â€”Do
mestic business last week continued
the recovery movement but stocks
slipped ofT to the lowest levels since
early October on the unsettling ef
fects of adverse foreign develop

of itself until the Saturday session,
when long selling developed and
forced prices down fractions to more
than 2 points.
