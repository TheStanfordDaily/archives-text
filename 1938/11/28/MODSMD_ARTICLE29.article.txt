till next year. That's what
they all say—Stanford said il
last year and Stanford says it this
year. But this time we mean it.
With half a chance in the form of 1
even breaks, good officiating, and a
reasonably small hospital record, the
Big Red Machine for 1939 has every
reason to mow 'em down.
Bill Paulman and Fred Ledeboer j
will be missed in the first-string |
backfield, but who could ask for a I
better quartet than Peter Fay (we ,
think he'll be back), Norm Standlee,
Gene Coldiron, and Hugh Gallar- !
neau. »
Fay has had a football biography
that would make Hollywood sit up <
and take notice. He didn't play as a !
sophomore, perhaps to save eilgi- I
bility, and the next year he starred
in practice, but the game itself gave !
him stage fright.
Jimmy Collis was handling things 1
in a manner that made him famous,'

but Tiny realized
he would gradual
ly need Fay more,
so he figured out
a way to make the
mellow - voiced
Irishman perform

in games as he did in practice. He
let Pete get game conscious as he
would and then offered him a seat
on the bench. As the game got un
der way, Fay cooled off, and he
could enter a game with the poise
and dignity of a veteran.
Fay saw considerable action last
year, and the more he saw the bet
ter he got. And in the Columbia
game, he made a rugby kick after a
futile attempt to carry the ball out
of his own end zone that gave him
national acclaim.
This season has been his best;
he has proved himself at every cor
ner of the triple-threat triangle, and
when he was calling signals Satur
day, Stanford could smile inwardly
with the feeling that Fay was the
solution to the 1939 field general
problems.
Standlee's performance all season
speaks for itself. He has gained
nearly every time he has had the
ball in his hands, and Stanford has
seldom seen a better line-backer.
But the good news is that Norm

! is no mean passer and kicker. There

has' been little oc
casion to teach
him kicking when
Paul man has been
on the scene, but
he has always
been consistent
with long punts,
and further prac
tice next spring
will put him

among the Pacific Coast's top-notch
hooters.
Coldiron, while he has always
gained with the ball, will not carry
it often next fall, but his blocking
will be priceless. And when it comes
to tackling, he'll be t4ie image of
Tony Calvelli on defense.
Hugh Gallarneau has made bril
liant throughout the 1938
season, and all he needs is experi
ence to become a consistent gainer.
Since experience seems to' be his
lacking, it is reasonable to expect
him to pick up with the passing of
time.
So while the backfield we boasted
before injuries darkened the scene
will never have another chance to
bring home the bacon, there is a
good one coming up, and we can be
gin to boast again.
London is the largest fish market
in the world, Boston is next.
