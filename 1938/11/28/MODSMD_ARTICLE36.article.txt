# Prophets with Honors

### 
A HOST of issues has sprung to life with the
announcement that two of Stanford's men
have been favored with a German award.
Two letters in Campus Opinion deal with the
topic; Dr. Wilbur has made his comment. Un
doubtedly more statements will be forthcoming
when Professors Lutz and Cooper actually re
ceive the awards, decide either to accept or
reject them.
In any case, the action will be taken as sym
bolical of a definite political attitude. The mat
ter seemingly is not simply one of receiving
or rejecting an honor. So great are the impli
cations of the term German or Nazi that any
action will be taken as a direct statement of
accession or negation of a whole nation.
Within the terms of the award, observers will
read only the story of Nazi conquest, Nazi per
secution, Nazi intolerance, Nazi unpopularity.
By the time the question of acceptance or re
jection of the honor is reached, little of the
original nature of it will be left.
Unmentioned will be the probability that the
two men in question merit the award for their
work in the particular field of German culture.
Because of the unsettled state of international
affairs, every move of an unpopular nation is
viewed with suspicion and alarm.
Dr. Wilbur calls the award an attempt to dig
up friends for Hitler. There is probably that in
it. But not too much, perhaps. It will take more
than two awards to two university professors
to counteract the effects of years of a hated
Nazi regime. Besides, it must be obvious that
Naziism and its supporters never come from the
intellectual ranks.
In spite of all this, however, the action of Pro
fessor Lutz and Professor Cooper will receive a
symbolic interpretation; no matter what they
themselves say, their move will be translated
into political terms.
It is too bad. Scholarship is a difficult
enough field to find honor in without having
ihe added complication of having to appear
a minor political prophet.
