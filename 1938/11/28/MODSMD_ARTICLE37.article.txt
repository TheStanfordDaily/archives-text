# Prophets without Honors

IN Tuesday's paper, The Daily asked for some
signs of the support to Stanford's team and
Stanford's coach which it felt was dominant on
the campus.
It had to wait until Saturday to get them,
though. But against Dartmouth, as against Cali
fornia, The Daily saw the answer to its question
in the team which would have scotched rumors
of a sad last year before they started had not
injuries and hard luck—not lack of material,
spirit, or coaching finesse—determined other
wise.
They started, as they always do, with a
stretch of bad games. And when three 6-0 af
fairs turned up, they looked like the hard-luck
kids to the grandstand coaches. Of course, a
single break in any of those games could have
turned the trick. And at the time, those breaks
were taken as part of the game. But later, they
were forgotten, and the boys who talked loud
est blamed the score on every other ascribable
cause—and one in particular.
Like most things written in a hurry (including
Daily editorials) gripes seldom see past the
noses of their authors. Those writers, having
had 6-0 scores set nicely on their snouts, saw
them, drew striking conclusions. Now, prob
ably, with equal skill, they can balance two
terrific games there and sing a new song
through the beak.
Even already the rumors are changing key.
Yesterday, it was set down for fact that Tiny's
new contract had been signed weeks ago.
Checks with authorities fail to substantiate the
rumor. But its nature indicates that, with a
couple of good games under Stanford's belt,
comment has already shifted around—to where
it should have been all year.
Now the curtain is closed. Stanford has
ended up as one of the strongest teams on the
Coast. And it took coaching to get it there.
The curtain has closed. With it should dim
the somber spotlight which back-shop prog
nosticators have persisted in throwing over the
man in the gray felt hat, sitting on Stanford's
bench during its games.
It wasn't asked for. It wasn't necessary.
As the campus looks forward to the basket
ball season about to start, let Stanford, the
columnists, the alumni pretend that it wasn't.
