# Prophets Again

### 
AT the beginning of the year, mention was
made of the fact that, for certain reasons,
The Daily would do without a summary news

column. Now, following in the footsteps of
Bill Millis' able "News in Reyiew" last year,
"Historyâ€”l93B" will fill the gap.
For a brief, interpretative summary of world
and national affairs, then, readers may turn to
the new column on page two, scan its para
graphs, and come out sadder and wiser men.
