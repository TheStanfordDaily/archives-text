### JOHN COBBS AH 
IS an axiom of student journalism that Monday
morning should be devoted to gentle philosophy
voiced in modulated tones. On a Monday morning fol
lowing a vacation this is especially true, and probably
the only appropriate comment would be, "God loves
us, even if we didn't open a book." The trouble is that
limitless though God's love may be, it won't fill a
column by itself. Further comment is necessary.
The whole problem of Monday melancholia arises
from the psychology of vacations, which is a sort of
unexplored scientific backwoods. According to the old
theory, the students spent vacation studying, sleeping,
and eating slowly, chewing each mouthful. Then they
returned to classes gay and energetic, with ravelled
sleeves of care properly darned, digestions working
smoothly, and all back work caught up.
* * * *
A few practical observations exploded this theory
some years ago. It was noted that the returning stu
dent showed all the enthusiasm of a wavering Chris
tian martyr who is told that his lion act is next on the
program. It was also noted that the curve for late
work alibis set an altitude record after each vacation.
The psychologists deserted their sinking theory and
transferred to a new doctrine which held that vaca
tions were a sort of celebration endurance contest.
The idea was that the student spent vacation burning
so many candles at both ends that he looked like
a chandelier.
# * * *
A s A matter of fact, both theories are stopped in the
academic scrimmage for no gain. Vacation is not
a period of hibernation, but neither is it a bachanalle.
It is a change of pace, and is excellent for body and
soul. But it is not the equivalent of a trip to a
sanitarium.
The main trouble with vacations as they are now
staged is that they don't have the benefit of the sci
ence and organization that go into school work. A
dance, for instance, is the holiday equivalent of col
lege athletics, and yet it is run off without any coach
ing or gym system. What we ought to do is put our
selves in the hands of a competent coach. Then in
stead of wandering aimlessly about the floor looking
for an open space, we could call an off-tackle play,
block out the couples on both sides, clip the man in
front (if the bouncer wasn't looking), and make our
own room, even as in football.
It would also be helpful if we could arrange for the
services of a good trainer in the half when the girls go
to powder their noses.
* * * *
The same thing applies lo the question of late hours.
When a man has wound up a term paper in a photo
finish with the dawn, if is foolish to say that his con
stitution won't stand a night of dancing. But in vaca
tion we roll out to play golf, while at school we
sleep peacefully and let our roommates turn in the
papers.
What we need, of course, is the application of scien
tific management to vacations. But until we have it,
Monday morning will remain dedicated to gently
pessimistic philosophy and double orders of coffee.

The same thing applies lo the question of late hours.
When a man has wound up a term paper in a photo
finish with the dawn, if is foolish to say that his con
stitution won't stand a night of dancing. But in vaca
tion we roll out to play golf, while at school we
sleep peacefully and let our roommates turn in the
papers.
What we need, of course, is the application of scien
tific management to vacations. But until we have it,
Monday morning will remain dedicated to gently
pessimistic philosophy and double orders of coffee.
IS an axiom of student journalism that Monday
morning should be devoted to gentle philosophy
voiced in modulated tones. On a Monday morning fol
lowing a vacation this is especially true, and probably
the only appropriate comment would be, "God loves
us, even if we didn't open a book." The trouble is that
limitless though God's love may be, it won't fill a
column by itself. Further comment is necessary.
The whole problem of Monday melancholia arises
from the psychology of vacations, which is a sort of
unexplored scientific backwoods. According to the old
theory, the students spent vacation studying, sleeping,
and eating slowly, chewing each mouthful. Then they
returned to classes gay and energetic, with ravelled
sleeves of care properly darned, digestions working
smoothly, and all back work caught up.
* * * *
A few practical observations exploded this theory
some years ago. It was noted that the returning stu
dent showed all the enthusiasm of a wavering Chris
tian martyr who is told that his lion act is next on the
program. It was also noted that the curve for late
work alibis set an altitude record after each vacation.
The psychologists deserted their sinking theory and
transferred to a new doctrine which held that vaca
tions were a sort of celebration endurance contest.
The idea was that the student spent vacation burning
so many candles at both ends that he looked like
a chandelier.
# * * *
A s A matter of fact, both theories are stopped in the
academic scrimmage for no gain. Vacation is not
a period of hibernation, but neither is it a bachanalle.
It is a change of pace, and is excellent for body and
soul. But it is not the equivalent of a trip to a
sanitarium.
The main trouble with vacations as they are now
staged is that they don't have the benefit of the sci
ence and organization that go into school work. A
dance, for instance, is the holiday equivalent of col
lege athletics, and yet it is run off without any coach
ing or gym system. What we ought to do is put our
selves in the hands of a competent coach. Then in
stead of wandering aimlessly about the floor looking
for an open space, we could call an off-tackle play,
block out the couples on both sides, clip the man in
front (if the bouncer wasn't looking), and make our
own room, even as in football.
It would also be helpful if we could arrange for the
services of a good trainer in the half when the girls go
