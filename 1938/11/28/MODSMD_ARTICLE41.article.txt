LONESOME
Up in the press box at the game Saturday our sports
editor, acting in official capacity or just out of curosity,
asked A1 Masters how many people were in the Stadium
watching the game.
Masters leaned over and whispered in his ear, "It's a
secret practice."

FRUSTRATION
Last week in one of his classes a professor built up
a neat lecture. It was well-rounded, complete, and
informative the professor thought. He had even built
it up to a strong climax at the end. a climax he had
thought which would hit the last word just as the
bell rang.
He came up to the last word, and paused a minute
for the bell to ring. No bell. He looked at his watch.
He had missed it by five minutes, there were five min
utes more before the hour was up.
He fidgeted for a minute. "Well. I thought I had
more to say than that." Another pause.
"Ah, I'm discouraged. I quit." And he walked out
of class.

He got in the main lobby just as the door was being
locked.
"Can I still get out. Miss Metzger?" he panted.
Miss Metzger paused, looked carefully at her walch.
and then said very sternly, "You have just five sec
onds. young man."
