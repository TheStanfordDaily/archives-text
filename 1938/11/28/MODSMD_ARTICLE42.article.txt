The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the news story on
page one of this Friday's Chronicle,
in which the President of our Uni
versity took such pains to degrade
the award of the Order of Merit of
the German Eagle to two very
prominent Stanford professors:
It is obvious that Chancellor
Hitler is not "looking for friends."
I think that the gesture merely
shows that in spite of the opposite
political, x'acial and economic views
of the German Dictator, he has evi
dently realized that there are men
in this country who are doing much
for the good of Germany as a coun
try, especially toward German cul
ture and international trade, without
having been branded Nazi by their
own countrymen.
I think it is a great distinction
that we have two such men at Stan
ford and that it is nothing to take
as a personal gesture of Hitler, as
our President would so sarcastic
ally have us believe.
Yours for more of
