The Editor, Sir:
In this morning's Chronicle I read
with interest of the honor conferred
on seven professors in American
universities by the Nazi regime. I
doubt not that this honor may re
sult in some hesitation on the part of
these professors. With this in mind
it will be pertinent to recall the simi
lar difficulty in the mind of the great
Pasteur in the time of the Paris
seige and of the way his difficulty
was solved. He returned his Bonn
diploma to that university under the
following letter of transmittal.
"While highly asseverating my
profound respect for you, Sir, and
for the celebrated professors who
have affixed their signatures to the
decision of the members of your
Order, I am called upon by my
conscience to ask you to efface my
name from the archives of your
Faculty, and to take back that
diploma, as a sign of the indig
nation inspired in a French sci
entist by the barbarity and hy
pocrisy of him who, in order to
satisfy his criminal pride, persists
in the massacre of two great na
tions.
"This letter will not have much
weight with a people whose prin
ciples differ so totally from those
that inspire us but it will at least
echo the indignation of French
scientists."
There will be many, I believe, who
will see a parallelism between the
two incidents.
