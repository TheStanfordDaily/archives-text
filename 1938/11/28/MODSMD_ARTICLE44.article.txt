WARM SPRINGS, Va., Nov. 27
(UP). â€”President Roosevelt tonight
explored the whole picture of re
ligious persecution with America's
envoys to Germany and Italy.
Seated before a roaring fire in
the pine-paneled living room of the
Little While House atop Pine Moun
tain, the chief executive heard from
Hugh Wilson, ambassador to Berlin,
and William Phillips, ambassador to
Rome, their conclusions on the Eu
ropean wave of intolerance directed
not only at the Jews but at Catholics
and Protestants as well.
From their reports observers felt
Mr. Roosevelt might delineate in
clearer terms the administration's
future relations with governments
prone to crack down on political,
racial, and religious minorities. Al
ready he has publicly rebuked the
Hitler government by technically
recalling his ambassador.
