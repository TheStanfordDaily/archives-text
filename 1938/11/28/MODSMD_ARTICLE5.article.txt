# Farm Leaders Thankful For Democracy, Stanford
## 
### KAY JOHNSEN 
The pilgrims .set apart a day for
thanksgiving at Plymouth immedi
ately after their first harvest in 1621,
and since then Americans have
celebrated the last Thursday in No
vember as Thanksgiving day. Chil
dren under 12—and sometimes those
over 12—are thankful when the day
rolls around on account of the tur
key and vacation. But with adults,
thanks of a more spiritual nature are
usually offered.
Last Thursday, here is what some
Stanford people were giving thanks
for:
President Wilbur- I find it diffi
cult for me to be specific I have so
many things to be thankful for . . .
but I am very thankful that Stanford
University is going right ahead and
making steady progress.
Dean Yost—l am most thankful
that I am living in a country where
democratic principles are accepted
and where, although we fall far short
of attaining our goal, democratic
practices can be followed. I am very
thankful that here at Stanford the
students are beginning to realize
that their own student activities are
a great laboratory in which they may
learn the democratic way of life. I
am hoping that more and more they
will judge their group activities first
of all by the criteria of democracy.
Dean Bunn — I, with all other
Stanford people, can be thankful for
the generous and thoughful plan
ning of Senator and Mrs. Stanford in
providing this great University, with
the wealth and freedom of opportu
nity which it affords. We can be
thankful that many others, friends
and alumni of Stanford have caught
the same spirit which motivated the
founders to the end that they have
added their efforts in helping our in
stitution among the leaders in edu
cation. We should live so that we

can be worthy of this great heritage.
11. IS. I —I am thankful for the
student action in regard to the boat
i house so that next spring we won't
have to use a shack full qf splinters
and loose nails.
Gretchen Ahlswede—Chairman of
| Women's Council—l am saving half
jof my thanks to give to the team
| after we beat Dartmouth Saturday.
A1 Ilom, chairman of Men's Coun
cil—Jean? Well, I think it's a hel
i uva world, but I am very thankful
j that I know you, anyway. (Ed. note:
i He was under the delusion that he
j was talking to someone else.)
Marco Thorne, Chappie — I am
j glad the Libe will be closed. Now 1
won't have to think up an excusc
for not studying.

a great laboratory in which they may
learn the democratic way of life. I
am hoping that more and more they
will judge their group activities first
of all by the criteria of democracy.
Dean Bunn — I, with all other
Stanford people, can be thankful for
the generous and thoughful plan
ning of Senator and Mrs. Stanford in
providing this great University, with
the wealth and freedom of opportu
nity which it affords. We can be
thankful that many others, friends
and alumni of Stanford have caught
the same spirit which motivated the
founders to the end that they have
added their efforts in helping our in
stitution among the leaders in edu
cation. We should live so that we

can be worthy of this great heritage.

The pilgrims .set apart a day for
thanksgiving at Plymouth immedi
ately after their first harvest in 1621,
and since then Americans have
celebrated the last Thursday in No
vember as Thanksgiving day. Chil
dren under 12—and sometimes those
over 12—are thankful when the day
rolls around on account of the tur
key and vacation. But with adults,
thanks of a more spiritual nature are
usually offered.
Last Thursday, here is what some
Stanford people were giving thanks
for:
President Wilbur- I find it diffi
cult for me to be specific I have so
many things to be thankful for . . .
but I am very thankful that Stanford
University is going right ahead and
making steady progress.
Dean Yost—l am most thankful
that I am living in a country where
democratic principles are accepted
and where, although we fall far short
of attaining our goal, democratic
practices can be followed. I am very
thankful that here at Stanford the
students are beginning to realize
that their own student activities are
a great laboratory in which they may
learn the democratic way of life. I
am hoping that more and more they
will judge their group activities first
of all by the criteria of democracy.
