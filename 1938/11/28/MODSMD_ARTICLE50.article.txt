# Davis, Flynn Score Slam In 'Sisters'
## 
### 
"The Sisters," currently playing at
the Fox - Stanford and starring l
Bette Davis:
"The Sisters" has the drop on any I
, movie we've seen in a good Jong i
time.
Adapted from Myron Brinig's ;
[.novel of the same name, its story of ;

a shinfhgly serene i
young woman, j
who sticks by her !
good-for-nothing j
husband, is noth- j
ing more than I
fruity melodrama.
But it is one in j
which the tear- i
jerking apparatus !
does not stick out j
like Diogenes in !

! the clink because "The Sisters" is
I much more than a story. An au
-1 thentic hark-back to the early 1900's, ,
| it sustains a beautifully plaintive and '
i nostalgic tone, and into it goes all the !
! fabulous paraphernalia of the horse- ;
I hair areaâ€”the furbelows and ostrich j
I plumes, the gas-lit election balls,;
and small town family life, the flush :
days of early San Francisco and the j
earthquake.
Into it, too, go several substantial
characterizations. Bette Davis soft- '
ens her cocktail contralto to play
i a nice girl and a forbearing wife. ]
j But her mettle is still unmistakably j
: there. Errol Flynn, an incurable I
: blade, has a little more to do this j
j trip than swashbuckle. And he does ;
lit well. His portrayal of a newspa- j
j perman and impulsive souse is an |
earnest piece of work.
