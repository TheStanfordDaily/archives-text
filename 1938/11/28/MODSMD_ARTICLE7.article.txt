Analyzing the recent Carnegie
Foundation Report, Professor L. M.
Terman, professor of psychology and
education at Stanford, will speak to
the Stanford Chapter of American
Association of University Professors
at a dinner meeting in the Stanford
Union at 6:15 o'clock tonight.
Dr. Terman will comment exten
sively on the nature and results of
the monograph by Learned and
Wood, of the Carnegie Foundation, a
paper which reported the exhaustive
study of several thousand high
school seniors, college sophomores,
and seniors on the basis of achieve
ment tests.
Among the results obtained by the
study of students in 49 Pennsylvania
universities were those suggesting
that many college seniors have
learned less than high school seniors,
|or college freshmen. Scores on the
achievement tests were compared
among departments of schools and
between the various schools them
selves. A study was made also of
the relation between achievement
.scores and the number of units taken
in a given subject.
From Â« r >o to 75 members of the
local chapter are expected to at
