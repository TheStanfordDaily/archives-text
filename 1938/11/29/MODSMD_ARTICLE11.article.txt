# Business Men Urged to Read
## Coman Emphasizes Importance of Books 
### 
That modern business men must
read extensively and intensively in
order to eonduet their businesses ef
ficiently was the assertion of Edwin
T. Coman, librarian in the Graduate
School of Business, when he spoke
on the Stanford radio broadcast
from San Francisco last night. Mr.
Com an's subject was "The Business
Man and His Books.''
"The business man has not read
much in the past because he could
successfully run his business with
out doing so," Mr. Coman remarked,
"but changing conditions within
business itself, and the social and
political shifts have brought home to
him the fact that he must read or go
out of business."
There have always been men who
have read widely and were well ac
quainted with what, written mate
rials there were in the field of busi
ness, but the largest body of Ameri
can business men have only just be
gun to recognize how much assist
ance business literature can give
them in solving their problems, the
speaker pointed out.
"The American business man is
not wholly to blame for his delayed
recognition of the value of books to
his daily work. Until recently, he
has been engaged in developing a
very rich continent; a rapidly grow
ing population has been demanding
his products almost faster than he
could make them; his means and
methods of production have been
small and closely related to the ex
tractive industries; and his market
has been largely local. With the in
creasing size of the individual busi
ness and the greater complexity of
modem life, the business man must
read to survive."
Today's business man "must turn
more and more to the trailed
librarian, the schools of business,
and to the special bibliographical
aids," he assured.
