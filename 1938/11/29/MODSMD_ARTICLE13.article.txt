The gift, of two valuable steam
turbo-generators to the Stanford
mechanical engineering department
was acknowledged at a luncheon last
week honoring Nathaniel G. Sym
oncls, vice-president of the West
inghouse Electric and Manufactur
ing Company, of Pittsburgh, Penn.
Mr. Symonds, a graduate of Stan
ford in electrical engineering in
1901, received an expression of
thanks for his company's gift from
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, and
from Dean Samuel B. Morris of the
School of Engineering. Paul H.
Davis, director of the Stanford
Fund, presided at the luncheon.
The Westinghouse turbo-genera
tors, worth $5000, will be used for
instruction and research on methods
of utilizing so-called "waste" steam.
They were received last week and
will be installed in the mechanical
engineering laboratory for use next
quarter. Professors Volney C. Finch
and U. A. Patchett of the mechanical
engineering department are in
charge of the work.
Talking before 20 members of the
faculty at the luncheon, Mr. Sym
onds said that the Westinghouse
Company, in times of financial stress,
Irims its research program the least
of any of its departments and is

constantly alert to aid research in
the universities.
"The salvation of democracy
means the salvation of the profit
system," he said, "and this must
come, in part, from technical ad
vances making possible lower pro
duction costs in industry." He de
clared that it is the obligation of
Stanford and other universities to
help industry solve its problems, not
only for the sake of the useful re
search involved, but also for the
sake of preserving the system of
private capitalism.
