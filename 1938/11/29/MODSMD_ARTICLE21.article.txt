# Terman Calls Grade Ratings Meaningless
## Psychology Professor Analyzes Recent Carnegie Foundation Report 
### 
"We have a product we sell to the world; but wc don't know anything
about what it is."
This was the conclusion reached by Dr. Lewis M. Terman of the psy
chology department in an analysis of the recent Carnegie Foundation
Report, given to the Stanford Chapter of the American Association of

â–ºUniversity Professors at a dinner
meeting in the Union Aleovc last
night.
Quoting Charles Eliot, who stated
in 1892 that "discrimination among
students, advancing each according
to his ability, should be the chief
task of the school administrator,"
Dr. Terman stated his belief that
American education as a whole had
advanced very little in that regard in
the 46 years since Dr. Eliot spoke.
''What we have now is 'package
education' which tends to destroy
the capabilities or the individual stu
dent, or at least tends to make the
grade ratings given him more or less
meaningless," he said. "Graduation
honors now mean simply that the
student has faithfully attended a
certain number of classes a certain
number of times, and has received
unit credit for them."
NUMEROUS COLLEGES STUDIED
The report, the first important,
study of individual differences at the
college level, has just been completed
by W. S. Learned and Ben D. Wood,
working under the auspices of the
Carnegie Endowment for the Ad
vancement of Learning. A study of
49 colleges in Pennsylvania plus 26,-
000 high school seniors in the same
state, it is the "by-product" of ten
years of achievement tests for high
school and college students.
Purpose of the report, according to
Dr. Terman, is to test the knowledge
of the individual student, rather
than the amount of information he
possesses at a given moment in a
given subject. Strongly skeptical of
so-called "values" to be gained out
side curricular work in college, the
authors have little patience with the
! Hutchins doctrine that the student
should be taught to "think" rather
than to learn.
STANFORD FLAN NOT BEST
"What they are interested in is
the amount which remains after the
knowledge assumed for credit has
dissipated," Dr. Terman said; "and
they don't hold out much hope for
the American system as it now ex
ists in that particular regard."
Commenting on Stanford's inde
pendent study plan in its relation to
the report, Dr. Terman remarked
that he considered it "only a good
drop in a big bucket."
"We are undertaking a construc
tive program, but so are many other
schools throughout the country; and
little real unity and very little real
progress can be found in their com
mon efforts."
Giving his own ideas for univer
sity education, Dr. Terman pointed
out that Stanford gives each student,
what amounts to a $350 scholarship
when he comes here, and then does
little to assure either itself or him
of a full return.
"If we could use that money in
giving scholarships to lliOO top stu
dents, carefully selected by com
petitive tests," he said, "we should
have a University which would soon
be a center of higher learning.
"If we would use aptitude tests
1 as a means of educational guidance
j rather than as a means of selection
! of students, we would come some
i what nearer the ideal in education."
Concluding the report, Learned
and Wood condemn American col-
I lege education in the following
j words:
"Underneath the book-work of
i the unit system lies educational
| chaos."
