### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
I INEXPECTEDLY. announcement
of a friendship agreement be
-1 ween Poland and Soviet Russia
burst upon the troubled European
scene yesterday. Following on Ger
many's refusal to let Polish and
Hungarian boundaries come together
through the annexation of Czecho
slovak Ruthenia, the pact comes as
a threat to Hitler's program of ex
pansion into eastern Europe.
Polish suspicion that Germany may
attempt to revive defunct Ukrainia,
of which Ruthenia was a part prior
to the partition of the Ukraine be
tween Poland, Soviet Russia, and
Czechoslovakia, is the probable
cause of the agreement. The new
understanding includes a pact which
brings to an end the press war that
has been raging between Warsaw
arid Moscow for many years.
At the same time hopes for
peace were bolstered by the an
nouncement from London that
l'rime Minister Neville Chamber
lain will visit Mussolini early in
January to further the "appease
ment" program resulting from the
Munich Pact. As in last week's
Paris conference, Viscount Hali
fax, British Foreign Secretary, will
accompany Chamberlain on his
mission to Rome.
Official London interprets the trip
as an indirect approach to the re
sumption of peace negotiations with
Hitler. It is significant that yester
day's announcement was made si
multaneously with that of the Russo-
Polish pact. Mussolini had favored
Hungarian annexation of Ruthenia,
hut his views were snowed under by
the Fuehrer's resolution to keep the
region independent. It may be that
Chamberlain is seeking gains for the
British cause in II Duce's loss of
prestige.

| N FRANCE it becomes more and
more apparent that Premier Dala
dier will be defeated by organized
labor. One after another, unions and
labor federations were swinging into
line last night to support the one
day general strike that has been
called to paralyze the French nation
tomorrow.
Daladier's counter-attack con
sisted of ordering all government
employees to continue work or
suffer dismissal and issuing a spe
cial decree authorizing the requi
sitioning under military supervi
sion of all public servants. If the
strike call succeeds it will mean
that the Premier will be unable to
demand the temporary powers of
dictatorship he desires in order to
restore internal order in France.

| JIPOLMATIC relations between
the United States and Germany
were still uncertain last night, al
though a normal course with Italy
has been assured.
Alter again conferring with Presi
dent Roosevelt yesterday on op
pressed minorities in European na
tions, Hugh R. Wilson, ambassador
1o Berlin who was summoned to
Washington in the midst of the Jew
ish persecution, was unable to state
how long it will be until he returns
to his post. It may be that Wilson
will remain in Washington as Coun
selor on German relations, but it is
almost certain that he or some other
ambassador will return to Berlin as
soon as the situation becomes less
tense.
Meantime, Ambassador to Italy
William Phillips, who also took
part in the conferences with the
President, has announced that he
will sail for Rome either Decem
ber 10 or 14; he has been consult
ing with the State Department in
Washington during the past ten
days.
