# The 						Magic Mirror
## 
### 
NOW it is recorded in the Book that a certain
magic mirror fell into the hands of a Uni
versity Man. How it came to him is not told,
but he fondled it and worshiped it as the apple
of his eye. For was not the mirror magic?
It possessed the curious property, instilled
in it at its making by the Black Witch of the
Red Countree, of reflecting the manner, bear
ing, costume, and divers other properties of its
owner—not as they so appeared to others or to
himself, but as they really were. These actions
the magic mirror recorded day by day so that
all might read what manner of man it was who
possessed the mirror.
So it was with the University Man (of whom
little else is recorded). Day by day, on the
magic mirror, his picture appeared, now in this
guise, now in that; now performing as a trained
bear, now as a monastic scholar, according to
the truth.
After a time, it so befell that the university
scholar, seeing himself in the mirror not as in
his own mind, grew discontented with his magic
gift. When it showed him as a grown man, wise
for his years and decorous in conduct, then he
walked proudly before it, gesturing and pos
turing to try the effect of his reflection.
But when the mirror portrayed him as a small
infant, crying for its rattle, or as a beardless
youth, reveling in folly, and unmindful of his
age or position, then he complained bitterly of
his lot, blaming the mirror for ridiculing him in
the eyes of the rest of the world.
So things went on; more and more the mir
ror reflected the University Man as he actually
was, and he was sore vexed at the appearance
which he made. The mirror, he proclaimd, was
a shame, a slanderous representation of himself,
a scandal monger. But inflexible as the sun, the
mirror went on reflecting him.
Now it happened that within the period of
three short months, the owner of the mirror
divested himself of all appearances of his rank,
capering about as a heedless infant, paying
little attention to the rights of those about him
in his careering. And each day, the mirror
showed brightly and clearly how things stood.
Until one day, the mirror shone no more.
There where it had hung lay nothing but splin
tered fragments of its magic glass. Yet, still
steady to its charm, it reflected its owner as he
had been when he shattered it—a mere child.
Here the chronicle endeth. But later it is
written that the scraps of the magic mirror were
gathered up, piece by piece, by a wise old
woman, and made into a college newspaper.
