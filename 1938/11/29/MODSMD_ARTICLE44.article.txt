# Grades on the Spot
## 
### 
WHEN he condemned the grade and unit
system in his talk to the Stanford Chapter
of the American Association of University Pro
fessors last night, Dr. Lewis M. Terman of the
psych department put his finger on the chief
weakness in American college education, and
at the same time placed himself in almost com
plete agreement with the present college gen
eration.
Too much account is taken of the ability to
memorize in the colleges today; too little is
taken of individual abilities, individual tastes.
Learning tends to become too much a process
of mechanics, an almost physical routine. So
many books, so many papers, so many hours,
so many grades: and an A.B., and an education,
signed, sealed, and certified.
If, as Dr. Terman suggests, the colleges could
devote the first week of freshman year to an
analysis of the student's mind and personality,
it might be easier to fit him into his proper
groove in the educational system. If the arti
ficial technique of grading, and the arbitrary
division set up by the unit system, could be
removed, it might be easier to point him toward
his particular field and interest.
The enthusiasm which must go with true
learning can be destroyed very easily, some
times by the student himself, but more often by
the artificial system within which he must
study. Until that system can be broken down,
until the student can move freely in the paths
which interest him most, American college edu
cation is going to remain what the Carnegie
Report calls it: a top-heavy superstructure, be
neath which lies "educational chaos."- A.S.D.
