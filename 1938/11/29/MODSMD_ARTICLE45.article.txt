# Gifts They Bear

MANY years ago, when the fable ol the col
lege education was in its glory, industry
rubbed its hands, said to itself: "This is a good
thing. We will fill our ranks with experts, the
experts will make our machines whirl faster, the

machines will fill our pockets with good things."
A few years later, with the onslaught of the
Great Disbelief (certainly to be confused with
the Great War), industry wiped its nose, said to
itself: "This is not so hot. Here we pay good
money for college graduates, the college gradu
ates know nothing about our business, they fill
our pockets with nothing but headaches and
red ink."
Now comes the swing of the pendulum back.
Industry is again rubbing its hands, but with
the wealth of experience behind it, and say
ing to itself: "These college boys, now, they
can be taught a few things if we catch them
young, if we use them properly."
Last week, Stanford received an indication of
the new era of industrial thought with the Wes
tinghouse gift of engineering equipment. At
the time, Stanford showed its appreciation of
the gift at the luncheon when it was accepted.
Later, it will be shown again when Stanford
turns out engineering graduates, trained on
the equipment which industry has donated,
equipped to fill a place which is purposeful and
valuable.
Few gifts pay so highly. Stanford is appre
ciative.
