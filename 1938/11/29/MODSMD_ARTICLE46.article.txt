# BULL SESSION
## SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP 
### JOHN COBBS 
VS7HEN it was announced last week that two oi - our
professors would receive honors from the German
government, Stanford reacted in about the same way
a naive audience does when Mephisto rolls in and
starts angling for a first lien on Faust's soul. Com
ment was acid enough to etch glass, and opinion
seemed to be that here was an international incident
which in future generations would be put to rhyme
for kindergarten memorization like the 1492-ocean
blue sequence.
The matter is interesting, of course, and its polit
ical facets might be worth a casual comment over
breakfast coffee. But there is no reason why it should
touch off an avalanche of comment. It takes more
than a couple of decorations to menace anything, even
that tender intangible, the "American system."
Personally I agree with majority opinion in hold
ing that Hitler is a filthy, crawling sort of a creature
like something that comes through the customs on a
bunch of bananas. And I am inclined to believe that
when man was sharing a two-family cave with a sabre
toothed tiger he was better off than he is in Nazi Ger
many. But I don't see how that belief can impose on
me a mandate to scream ' Treason!" when the German
government decides to decorate two of our faculty
members.
If the professors don't want the awards they can
send them back. And if comments scrawled on term
papers are a reliable guide, the professors will be able
to make their thank-you notes as acid as they like,
without the assistance of the public.

B UT if our two faculty members want to keep the
decorations, there is no reason why they should
not. The awards were not made for secret service
activities or for skill in massacre and tyranny. They
were based on achievement in academic work. Stan
ford has already recognized the value of that work by
putting the men on its faculty; it is a little inconsist
ent for Stanford to howl because the German govern
ment agrees with its evaluation.
Acceptance of the awards doesn't mean that the
professors arc honor-bound to poison young minds,
bum the city-hall, and flunk everyone suspected of
being a democrat. The decorations are given for work
that is already done, and they contain no clauses about
future conduct. If we trusted our growing minds with
the professors in the past, there is no reason why
recognition by Germany should frighten us off now.

As a matter of fact, Stanford was not concerned
with the effects of the decorations. We have developed
the habit of letting drive with a searing comment
whenever Hitler's name is mentioned, like small boys
from Republican families who automatically hiss a
Roosevelt news reel. We know that it is fashionable
to swear at Hitler; and we find it much easier to be
consistent instead of thoughtful.
In any case, it s none of our business. We weren't
decorated.
