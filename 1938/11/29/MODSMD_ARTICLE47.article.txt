### DOUG JAQUES 
A guy was having dinner at Dinah's Sunday night,
and when he was finished the waiter came around with
a cheek for $1.35 plus a few odd pennies. There was
something about the bill that the guy found large and
surprising, and it wasn't the few odd pennies.
He looked at the menu to see if it said anything
about $1.35. There it was, right in front of him—sl.3s.
Only it was written out in long-hand.
He had thought that was the address.
i But he paid.
