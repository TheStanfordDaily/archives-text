j Down south at the Palomar last week-end there
were:
Gene Krupa and his orchestra playing loudly and
wildly.
A Stanford guy who was studious and serious and
very romantic, and had a bilnd date with
A gal who wasn't.
Oilier people at their table.
A round of fruit punches.
At one point in the evening the gal who wasn't
shattered the guy's normal haze of blissful and un
expressed romance by quickly and cleverly and very
suddenly sitting on his lap and telling him ip qutie
direct terms that she liked him and he was a cute
kid.
The guy suggested they waltz.
To Gene Krupa's music.
