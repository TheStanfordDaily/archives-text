# 'Shining Hour' Plot Ancient; Acting Superb
## 
### 
"THE SHINING HOUR." cur
rently playing at the Loew's War
field in San Francisco.
Recipe: Take one well-worn plot,
mix with a number of stars; add a
new flourish or two and spice with a
tricky ending. Result: The usual
Hollywood movie.
M.G.M. followed this recipe to con
coct "The Shining Hour," but sur-

prisingly enough
the usual be
comes the un
usual, for this pic
ture is truly good.
Adapted from a
stage play by
Keith Winter, the
story tells of a
gentleman farm
er, Melvyn Doug
las, who marries
a. _1. .L J

a glamorous night club dancer, Joan
Crawford. As always, the aristo
cratic family objects to the bride.
The family consists of the farmer's
maiden sister, Fay Bainter, who is
the head of the household, his
younger brother, Robert Young, and
his brother's wife, Margaret Sulla
van. The misunderstood dancer con
quers all, except the sister, who pos
sesses a bitter hatred for her.
The story comes to life with a
bang, when Robert Young finds
himself in love with Joan Crawford.
Naturally, many problems and sit
uations arise, but with a true Holly
wood climax love conquers all, in
cluding the sour-puss sister.
But what lifts the picture out of
the ordinary class is the superb act
ing, which injects life and interest
to every scene. Margaret Sullavan
portraying intense love for her hus
band, turns in the outstanding per
formance. Fay Bainter runs a close
second. It is doubtful if any other
actress could show the emotions of
hate and lwve that were required
by the i*ole of the maiden sister as
well as Fay Bainter. Joan Crawford
did the best she could, and presented
a satisfying performance considering
the competitions she was up against.
Melvyn Douglas plays his con
sistently fine characterization, and
Robert Young is surprising in that
he handles a role that calls for more
than being just a bright playboy.
Of great aid to "The Shining Hour"
is its wi ioadytlglufjectsMETAET
is its witty dialogue, deft camera
shots, and fine musical score.
