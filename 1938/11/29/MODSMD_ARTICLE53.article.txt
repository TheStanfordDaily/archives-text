# Alumni Receive Lincoln Awards
## Arc Welding Papers Win Contest Prizes 
### 
Information that three Stanford
alumni, Alexei Maradudin, Nathan
iel Kendall, and Edgar Brooker,
have been recipients of awards in
the recent contest of the James F.
Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation,
was issued yesterday by Dr. Eliot
Blackwelder, professor of geology.
Subject matter for this contest was
the redesign of existing machines,
structures, and buildings with a sav
ing in the cost of production over
the previous method of construction.
The savings to industry by using arc
welding on these constructions, as
claimed by the contestants, amount
to $1,000,000,000.
"Welding Organization for a Typ
ical Oil Company" was the title of
Maradudin's paper. This was a plan
for conducting a welding organiza
tion in the petroleum industry. This
included administration and person
nel qualifications of a welding engi
neer, of foremen and gang leaders,
special training of welders, testing of
welders, equipment and procedure
and testing of weld rods.
Kendall's paper was entitled "Arc
Welded Design of Filter Wash Water
Troughs and Manifolds." The out
standing advantages of arc welded
construction over concrete and wood
constructions would be the decrease
in weight and ready attainment of
ideal shapes.
Brookcr's "Steel Arc Welded Roof
for Freight Cars" dealt with the dis
cussion of all-steel arc welded roof
to replace the riveted one on freight
cars. This would cause a gross sav
ing of $16,610,202.
