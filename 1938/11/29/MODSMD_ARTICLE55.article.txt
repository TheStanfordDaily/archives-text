## AL CAPONE'S AWARDS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There are a number of interesting
awards being given out to college
professors these days. But among
the most fascinating are the follow
ing, which have been reported by
secret agents and have been con
firmed by special investigation of the
Dies Committee:
1. A1 Capone has presented three
university professors with the high
est order of "de doity handy-billy,"
for outstanding service in the realm
of criminology.
2. Tammany Hall has awarded
four "silver-stuffed ballots" to uni
versity research workers for pre
serving work in the field of political
science.
3. And Sherman Bainbridge, pro
ponent of the Thirty Dollars Evei'y
Thursday fantasia, has announced his
firm intention to reward the scru
tinizing legal observations of two at
torneys with three large hams and
a hard-boiled egg.
There will doubtless be a number
of muddle-brained cranks who will
dogmatically deny that the recipi
ents of the awards should accept
them, simply because the donors arc
not fit, judges of who should get the
awards. Some will even insist that
the mere fact that A1 Capone has
murdered a few dozen people should
influence the decision.
But anyone with a real grasp of
logic and the principles of cultural
and scholastic achievement will im
mediately recognize that the awards
have nothing to do with A1 Capone's
murders or Sherman Bainbridge's
somewhat flighty imagination. The
px-ofessors, the lawyers, and the re
search workers should accept by ail
means. After all, Al Capone has
done a lot for the nationalistic feel
ing of the Chicago gangs, and, in the
last analysis, what is so valuable as
pure science? What, I repeal, what?
Heil Hitler,
Sherman McllinkofT
