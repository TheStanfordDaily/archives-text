# French Labor Organization Defies Daladier
## 24-hour Strike Is Protest Against Economy Decrees 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 28 (UP).—The Gen
eral Labor Federation (C.G.T.) de
fied Premier Edouard Daladier's
Government today and reaffirmed its
order for a 24-hour general strike
on Wednesday in protest against the
Government's economy decrees.
Members of the C.G.T. "adminis
trative board, which held an emer
gency meeting, rejected a suggestion
by the Socialist and Republican
union in Parliament that the strike
be called ofT in exchange for an
early parliamentary session, at!
which the decrees could be debated
— and the Government probably
overthrown.
DALADIER SUGGESTS
The suggestion came as Premier
Edouard Daladier, who has already
requisitioned the railways, ordered
the requisition of Paris subways and
buses and otherwise extended the
Government's preparations to defeat
the strike.
Daladier was firmly putting down
the premature and unauthorized
strikes which have been in progress.
The only new strike today was
among 5000 shipyard workers at
Dunkerque. They quit construction
of five warships and other ships.
GATES LOCKED
An intimation of reprisals against
unauthorized strikes was given when
the gates of the Renault Automo
bile Works were locked against strik
ers who tried to return to work.
More than half of the 30,000
Renault workers reported to resume
work. The company locked them out,
saying it was necessary to repair
damage done machinery last week
when mobile guards forcibly evicted
sitdown strikers from the plant.
