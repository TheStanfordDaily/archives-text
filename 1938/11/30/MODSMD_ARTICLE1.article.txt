# Greek Meet Condemns 'Hell Week'
## National Conference Shows Fraternities Lead Hulls in Grades 
### 
Flushing the spotlight on them
selves, over 400 fraternity rcpresen- j
tatives to the Thirtieth National In
terfraternity Conference last week !
agreed that Hell Week practices were
"absurd" and "asinine."
The annual meeting, to which Bud
McDufTie, Interfraternity Council
president at Stanford traveled over
Thanksgiving vacation, was held at
the Hotel Commodore, New York
City, brought officials of GO national
college fraternities, and represented
2,3G8 undergraduate chapters on 190
university campuses throughout the
United States and Canada.
It was Dr. Fred H* Turner, dean
of men at the University of Illinois,
who scored Hell Week tactics: "The
paddle and the practices of 'Hell
Week'," Dean Turner said, "furnish
the most asinine paradox which can
be found in the educational world
today. Paddling and 'hell week' are
hazing, and hazing has been ruled
out of every self-respecting college
and university in the country."
McDUFFIE REPORTS
In a letter to The Daily, Bud Mc-
DufTie commented: "I feel that the
remarks regarding 'Hell Week' are
particularly pertinent in view of the
fact that tomorrow begins our first
unified 'pre-initiation period' ever to
be held on the Stanford campus."
In a report presented by Dr. Al
van E. Duerr, scholarship chairman
of the conference, fraternity men
throughout the country revealed a
higher scholastic average than non
fraternity men for the eighth con
secutive year.
Fraternities increased by GO per
cent the margin by which they had
excelled the non-fraternity men of
the country a year ago, the report
stated. On the basis of this study,
Dr. Duerr felt, it is safe to say that
poor scholarship among fraternity
men is nothing more than a myth.
GRADES LEAD
The survey on scholarship cov
ered 1.930 fraternity chapters. The
greatest gains in scholastic ratings
were made at the University of Illi
nois where (he 56 fraternity chapters
doubled their relative of a year ago.
Commenting upon the results of
lhis survey, Bud McDufTie said: "It
was particularly gratifying to find
that despite the many accusations
hurled at fraternities in regard to
their detrimental effects upon schol
arship, that the standing of frater
nity men as a whole is above aver
age and is on the upturn.
FRATERNITIES IMPROVE
He further said: "1 was more than
pleased to learn that it Ls the belief
of fraternity leaders that:
"I. The national organization
should be loyal first to the colleges
in which it has chapters.
"2. That the chapter should bo loy
al first to the college in which it is
located.
"As you can easily see, this defi
nitely defines the co-operative trend
away from the old individualistic,
"to-hell-with-everyone-else" atti
tude with which fraternities have
been branded so long."

GRADES LEAD
The survey on scholarship cov
ered 1.930 fraternity chapters. The
greatest gains in scholastic ratings
were made at the University of Illi
nois where (he 56 fraternity chapters
doubled their relative of a year ago.
Commenting upon the results of
lhis survey, Bud McDufTie said: "It
was particularly gratifying to find
that despite the many accusations
hurled at fraternities in regard to
their detrimental effects upon schol
arship, that the standing of frater
nity men as a whole is above aver
age and is on the upturn.
FRATERNITIES IMPROVE
He further said: "1 was more than
pleased to learn that it Ls the belief
of fraternity leaders that:
"I. The national organization
should be loyal first to the colleges
in which it has chapters.
"2. That the chapter should bo loy
al first to the college in which it is
located.
"As you can easily see, this defi
nitely defines the co-operative trend
away from the old individualistic,
"to-hell-with-everyone-else" atti
tude with which fraternities have
been branded so long."
Flushing the spotlight on them
selves, over 400 fraternity rcpresen- j
tatives to the Thirtieth National In
terfraternity Conference last week !
agreed that Hell Week practices were
"absurd" and "asinine."
The annual meeting, to which Bud
McDufTie, Interfraternity Council
president at Stanford traveled over
Thanksgiving vacation, was held at
the Hotel Commodore, New York
City, brought officials of GO national
college fraternities, and represented
2,3G8 undergraduate chapters on 190
university campuses throughout the
United States and Canada.
It was Dr. Fred H* Turner, dean
of men at the University of Illinois,
who scored Hell Week tactics: "The
paddle and the practices of 'Hell
Week'," Dean Turner said, "furnish
the most asinine paradox which can
be found in the educational world
today. Paddling and 'hell week' are
hazing, and hazing has been ruled
out of every self-respecting college
and university in the country."
McDUFFIE REPORTS
In a letter to The Daily, Bud Mc-
DufTie commented: "I feel that the
remarks regarding 'Hell Week' are
particularly pertinent in view of the
fact that tomorrow begins our first
unified 'pre-initiation period' ever to
be held on the Stanford campus."
In a report presented by Dr. Al
van E. Duerr, scholarship chairman
of the conference, fraternity men
throughout the country revealed a
higher scholastic average than non
fraternity men for the eighth con
secutive year.
Fraternities increased by GO per
cent the margin by which they had
excelled the non-fraternity men of
the country a year ago, the report
stated. On the basis of this study,
Dr. Duerr felt, it is safe to say that
poor scholarship among fraternity
men is nothing more than a myth.
