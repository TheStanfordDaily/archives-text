# Cards to Meet Don Debaters
## Sun Quentin Tilt Will Be Held Sunday 
### 
Milton Marks, Jr., and Frank Mal
lory, Stanford debaters, will meet
the University of San Francisco
team tomorrow to take issue on the
perennial Anglo-American ques
tion.
The debate will be held in San
Francisco at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
evening. The Card team will take
the negative of the question.
Marks and Mallory are the team
which rose to the finals in the inter
squad tryouts two weeks ago, only
to meet defeat at the hands of Sher
man Mellinkoff and Sid Terry in
what Varsity Coach Leland Chapin
termed "an unusually even match."
Mellinkoff and Terry, along with
Stan Andersen, will represent Stan
ford in the San QuentLn debate to be
held there Sunday afternoon. This
forensic plum was awarded Mellin
koff and Teri-y as result of their vic
tory in the intersquad tryouts.
Concluding Stanford's participa
tion in the Radio Debate Series, Nel
son Norman and Armen Hampar will
broadcast the negative and evalua
tion of the Anglo-American ques
tion Saturday evening. This will be
Stanford's second and last, appear
ance on the program, which has be
come a regular feature of the Colum
bia Broadcasting System.
