# Five Dead in Freak S.F. Plane Disaster
## Survivors Blame Crash on Storm, Too Perfect Radio Reception 
### 
POINT REYES, t'al., Nov. 29 (UP). â€”Radio, illusive handmaiden of
eummcrcial aviation, played a eruel triek today, unintentionally sending
a United Air Lines plane to a crash landing in the Pacific Occan with a
loss of five lives on a storm-lashed flight from Seattle to San Francisco.
Two persons were saved. Captain Charles Baldwin Stead, 42, pilot of
the luxurious 14-passenger "Skylounge," and Isadore Edelstein, Los Auge-

les, an ex-convict released from life
imprisonment just last week on a
promise to leave the United States
forever.
The others might have escaped too
had they remained inside the cabin
of the plane as it floated shoreward
and broke up under the pounding of
the surf.
Coast Guardsmen, descending a
500-foot cliff after failing because of
the raging seas to reach the wreck
age from the sea, found the cabin
dry and intact. The rest of the
plane was splintered and scattered.
SIX MISSING
Those missing were Philip Harl,
president of the Pacific Bridge Com
pany, one of the largest in the coun
try; Ivan B. Hefleblower, San Fran
cisco, a partner in the financial house
of Leland M. Kaiser & Company;
Sidney L. Shunts, a San Jose min
ing engineer; Frona Clay, 24, stew
ardess, The Dalles, Ore., and Lloyd
Jones, Seattle, the co-pilot.
Neither Stead nor Edelstein was
hurt seriously and each was able to
give a graphic account of one of the
strangest accidents in aviation his
tory and the first for United Air
lines in 10 years of operation on the
Seattle-San Francisco run.
RADIO BLANK
Stead blamed the crash on a com
bination of "too perfect radio re
ception" and a high altitude storm
which had blown the plane off its
course on its night flight from Med
ford, Ore., to Oakland Airport on
San Francisco Bay.
"It is kind of hard to explain,"
Stead, who had been flying com
mercial planes for seven years, told
interviewers at the Point Reyes
Coast Guard station and again at
the home of his sister, Gwendolyn
Stead Cline, at San Mateo.
"It was too perfect a night for
radio reception. Portland came in
as clear as Oakland. All the time
there was absolutely clear radio re
ception, so exceedingly perfect sta
tions hundreds of miles away were
coming in more clearly than stations
close to us.
TROUBLE STARTS
"The result was we were getting
so much we were getting nothing.
"We didn't have serious weather
until 2:30 or maybe 3 o'clock when
we began to wonder about things.
We kept flying around, maintaining
contact until it was necessary to sit,
down. It was very dark but I picked
out a spot about 1000 yards off
shore."
Stead wasn't certain of the time
he set down the plane, with its
wheels retracted, on the surface of
the occan. It must have been after
5:22 a.m. when he dropped a flare,
and reported to Oakland the sea
was rough.
j WAVES DANGEROUS
The landing was made safely and
the waves started to carry the plane
toward shore.
"We got the passengers out oti the
wings first," Stead said. "Then we
grabbed blankets and climbed out.
after them. The co-pilot and two
| passengers were on the fuselage,
' back toward the tail. The stewardess
and another passenger were on one
wing and Edelstein and I were on
another.
"We must have drifted 25 minutes,
quite easily. Then the surf got us
and hurled us on the rocks."
The department of agriculture
plans to divert surplus hops into
fertilizer and mulch.
