I ABOR'S revolt against France's
swing to the right comes to its
climax this morning with the antici
pated walkout of 525.000 unionized
railroad workers, paralyzing service
on all lines. Already the one-day
general strike is well under way.
Starting at midnight last night, 5,-
001),000 workers folded their arms in
a protest against Premier Daladier's
recovery program, which includes
extension of the 40-hour week.
Basis of the general strike is
Communist and labor opposition to
Daladier's policy of Franco-German
amnity and his abolition of economic
reforms introduced under the Bium
government. Crux of the show
(town between the Premier and his
leftist opposition is the railroad
walkout; Daladier has ordered the
military requisition of all lines and
the conscription of workers at army
pay under threat of imprisonment.
If (he government can keep the
services running, (he revolt prob
ably will be broken* and Daladier
will emerge victorious to demand
powers amounting almost to dicta
torship. If the leftists are success
ful, (be Cabinet may be over
thrown; Leon Blum's Socialist
party has called a "rump session"
of Parliament for Friday morning
in defiance of Daladier.
Meanwhile, thousands of troops
and mobile guards surrounded la
bor-class districts throughout France
and rioters clashed with guards in
Valenciennes, the center of the
northern "red zone."

I ABOR'S revolt against France's
swing to the right comes to its
climax this morning with the antici
pated walkout of 525.000 unionized
railroad workers, paralyzing service
on all lines. Already the one-day
general strike is well under way.
Starting at midnight last night, 5,-
001),000 workers folded their arms in
a protest against Premier Daladier's
recovery program, which includes
extension of the 40-hour week.
Basis of the general strike is
Communist and labor opposition to
Daladier's policy of Franco-German
amnity and his abolition of economic
reforms introduced under the Bium
government. Crux of the show
(town between the Premier and his
leftist opposition is the railroad
walkout; Daladier has ordered the
military requisition of all lines and
the conscription of workers at army
pay under threat of imprisonment.
If (he government can keep the
services running, (he revolt prob
ably will be broken* and Daladier
will emerge victorious to demand
powers amounting almost to dicta
torship. If the leftists are success
ful, (be Cabinet may be over
thrown; Leon Blum's Socialist
party has called a "rump session"
of Parliament for Friday morning
in defiance of Daladier.
