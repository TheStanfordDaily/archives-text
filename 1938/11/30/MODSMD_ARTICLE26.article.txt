# Dr. Margery Bailey Is First An Actress
## 
### JOHN CLINE 
Dr. Margery Bailey Stanford asso
ciate professor of English, entered
her 10 o'clock class wearing a white
linen dress, a blue smock, brown
silk stockings, and brown health
sport shoes. On each of her wrists
was n yellow bracelet; about her
neck was a string of pearls, in her
ears, pearl ear-rings. She wore very
little make-up, and no nail polish.
Her gray hair, brushed straight
back, was caught in a knob by a
hair net at the back of. her head.
Immediately upon her entry, the
class became attentive. The Doctor
sat down on the (V.ge of her chair,
rocked back and forth, ran her fin
gers through her hair; then with
nervous gestures and changing in
tonations, began to read bits from
"Love for Love." Throughout the
entire 50 minutes, Dr. Bailey's mag
netic personality and lively hand
! gestures held the complete attention
| of poetic-looking girls, high school
teachers seeking Ph.D.'s, and cyn
; ical young men eager to write the
' Great American Novel. What she
said was interesting—how she said
I it was vastly more so. She could
steal anybody's show with nothing
better to recite than a Moon-June
• ballad by some third-rate Hollywood
hack.
I BAILEY S VIEWS
I She understands life and people—
j hates the modem trend of marriage
i as a mere cover-up for illicit rela
tions — heartily despises the Reno
sex mills—and believes in a sturdy
basis of personal ethics for govern
ing one's whole life intelligently.
Asked if she were married, the Doc
tor grinned and said,
"No—alas;" then added dryly,
"You'd better say Alas."
When I had suddenly forgotten all
the questions I wanted to ask her,
she smiled with her eyes and said,
I "Is that all you want to know?—
j you should inquire about aversions
I and hobbies."
j "Oh yes—what about your aver

] sions and hobbies, Doctor? I asked.
She looked keenly at me, then
said, "I used to walk a lot —until I
got arthritis; when I was younger I
liked to sing folk songs. I also used
jto go to San Francisco's old Tivoli
Theater."
FORMER INTERESTS
Dr. Bailey was born in Santa Cruz,
1 California, in 1891. She entered
! Stanford in 1910, graduated, and took
her Ph.D. at Yale in 1922. She's
listed in "Who's Who in America."
j Successful writers who studied un
der her at Stanford are John Stein
i beck, who wrote "01" Mice and
I Men"; the late Laird Doyle; Waldo
i Salt, who recently wrote the Holly
wood script for "Shopworn Angel";
and Archie Binns, her favorite. She
thinks Binns is a far more mature
| writer than Steinbeck. One of her
classmates at Stanford was the
■ playwright, Maxwell Anderson.
DISLIKES FARM ATTITUDE
! Dr. Bailey likes Stanford, but lists
jits chief evils as an inordinate love
of publicity, a "manana" attitude, a
; smug, self-satisfied complacency, and
a pitiful respect for money.
| Dr. Bailey's main interest —next to
her friends and her teaching—is the
theater. Her associates say she di
rects and act superbly—on the stage
land in the classroom; in fact, she
; does everything so intensely, and
! uses up so much of her great supply
! of energy, that at night she is com
j peltely tired out.
Her office is long and low-ceiling
jed; its walls are surrounded by
I books. It contains a desk some
'chairs, and a long conference table.
I Here she works, writes .and reads.
Before leaving, I asked her for
I some pictures, candid camera shots.
I She said, "No—not just now. Come
.
back this afternoon, and I'll be more
presentable — I just had my hair
washed and can't do a thing with
it!"
That afternoon The Daily pho
| tographer and I went to Dr. Bailey's
I office with a rough draft of this in
jterview and a candid camera. Dr.
I Bailey was sitting at her desk; her
beautiful, silver hair was perfectly
groomed; she looked very aristo
cratic. "Here, let me see what you've
j libeled me with this time," she said,
I reaching for the copy.
Reading down, she said. "What
i kind of bracelets am 1 wearing?—
You might as well learn these things
now—they're composition. I get all
my jewelry and all my dishes at
Woolworths — I practically support
the Princess M-Mdivani!" (She
dragged out the M.)
LAUGHS AT SELF
Reading further, she laughed out
loud and said, "Reno sex mills —
humph — you put it. as though 1
wished I were there; anybody would
dislike Reno, except the people from
Reno!"
While the candid shots were being
| taken, she kept up a constant bar
rage of barbed remarks, most of
which she directed at, herself.
Toward the end she said to the pho
j tographer:
"How about a profile (she pro
nounced it. "profeel)) in burlesque)
shot—this is a family nose."
When she finished reading the
draft of this interview (making
enough corrections to rate a by
| line), I asked her how she liked it.
She replied, grinning wickedly:
DISLIKES INTERVIEWS
"Young man, I don't like any in-
I terviews, but of all the interviews
j I've disliked, this is the worst libel
I've ever read; it's a wonder you
don't want to picture me smoking a
Santa Fe cigar, as I did in Romeo
and Juliet! What—CERTAINLY you
can quote me!"
A line from Virgil (slightly al
tered) well describes Stanford's
Associate Professor Margery Bailey,
Ph.D.—
"Happy is the woman who has
learned the causes of things, and has
I put under her feet all fears, and in
jexorable fate, and the noisy strife of
| the hell of greed."
