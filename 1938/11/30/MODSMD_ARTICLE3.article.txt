# New Major To Explore Middle Ages
## Degree to Be Given For 'Floating' Study 
### 
Provision for one of the outstand
ing advancements in Stanford educa
tional fields during the past few
years was officially revealed yester
day evening by Professor F. W.
Strothmann, chairman of the Com
mittee for Medieval Studies. Grow
ing interest in the Medieval ages has
made possible, through the assist
ance of the School of Letters, a
major and resulting A.B. degree, no
longer obtained by study in one de
partment but by study in several
Stanford schools mid departments.
This attempt to provide a new type
of eoliege education will offer stu
dents interested in Medieval ages a
knowledge, not of one aspect of Me
dieval life, but, with assistance com
ing from several departmental
sources, a knowledge of all sides of
life as it was lived in that age. Suc
cess in this experiment, as revealed
by Professor Strothmann, may pos
sibly lead to similar advancements
in other fields of Stanford educa
tion.
STROTIIMAN QUOTE
Below is the announcement as
provided by Professor Strothmann:
"The growing interest in medieval
j studies which has been so conspic
i uous in American universities dur
ing the last few years is producing
a new educational experiment here
at Stanford: an A.B. degree obtained
not in one department, but in the
chronological period of the Middle
Ages.
"The School of Letters has decided
to co-ordinate the medieval courses
offered by professors in various de
partments into an undergraduate
program, and to supplement, those
now given in order to make possible
a well-rounded study of medieval
culture.
"During the winter and spring
quarters two such new courses will
be offered: a seminar on Chivalry by
Professor Frederick Anderson, and
one on the Early Fathers of the
Church by Professor Henry Lanz.
Tentatively the following program
will be given during the academic
year 1939-40: Medieval Mysticism by
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, Medieval
Technology by Professor Lynn White,
and Medieval Heresies by Professor
Albert Lynd. This seminar will be
open to all juniors, seniors, and
graduate students. At. the present
time Stanford offers courses in me
dieval policies, philosophy, science,
technology, art, and in both the Latin
and vernacular literatures.
NEW TYPE MAJOR
"The project for a degree in me
dieval studies is regarded with in
terest as an attempt to provide a
new type of college education: one
which will give the student knowl
edge not of one aspect of life—po
litical, economic, artistic, or the like
—but rather of all sides of life as it
was lived in a single past age.
"The sponsors of the plan are con
fident that the study of all facets of
human nature, as they appear in a
cultural context very unlike our
own, will provide the student, with an
unrivalled opportunity to look at the
modern world with fresh and critical
eyes.
LEARN ABOUT PRESENT
"By scanning the axioms and
prejudices of the Middle Ages, he
may learn to probe the hidden as
sumptions of our own time. Indeed,
the present interest in medieval
studies throughout America is large
ly rooted in the growing conviction
on the part of thoughtful men that
the attempt to diagnose the ills of the
modern world on the basis of purely
modern assumptions is doomed to
failure if only because our troubles
may well be caused by the falsity of
those very assumptions.
"The ideal of the new medieval
curriculum is 1o enable the student
to saturate himself temporarily in
! the standard of values and judg
; ments commonly accepted by a great
I past culture thus freeing his mind
i from current cliches and presupposi
tions and enabling him to sec the
world around him from the outside
rather than from the inside alone.
