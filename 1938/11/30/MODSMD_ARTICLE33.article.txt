\V HEN sheepskins are handed out
next June, Stanford will be
holding Commencement exercises
and a funeral. Eulogies will flash in
the minds of football fans as they
watch a group of men who have put
away helmet and pads for cap and
gown.
Appearance of BILL PAULMAN
—he won't have a 16 on his back—
will call to the minds of those who
can remember the event of a Satur
day afternoon back in 1934, when
the quiet, unassuming blond ap
peared in the Papoose backfield
against a highly-touted freshman
team from Southern California.
The score was 13-0 in favor of the
Trojans, and Paulman was still just
a name on the program. In five
minutes his kicking and passing
brought the score to 14-13 and later
to 27-19 for the Stanford l'rosh. In
that game he threw 21 completed
passes out of 22 attempts and aver
aged 52 yards on his punts.
With Bobby Grayson and Bones
Hamilton to carry the ball the next

year, Paulman
worked in line as
a blocking back.
Then injuries hit
hi m right and
left, he missed a
whole year of
competition, and
was in the hospi-

tal much ol the last season. But
Paulman has played more all-
American ball in the few games he
has been well enough to participate
in than many ail-Americans have
played in three full years.
TONY CALVELLI will be remem
bered not only for genuine football
talent but for his willingness to put
everything he had into every play.
A transfer from San Mateo Junior
College year before last, he was
tried out in the Stanford backfield
and flashed in every department,
particularly in passing. But the
Cards were short a center, and Tony
was the logical man because of his
all-around skill. He did an excel
lent job there, and if he doesn't make
ail-American, injuries that forbade
him a season of 60-minute games
will be to blame.
JACK CLARK was one of the
most promising ends ever to appear

at Stanford, even
in his sophomore
year, when he
.watched from the
rbench a pair of
all - American
flankers, Topping
and Moscrip. He
was acclaimed as
an all-Coast se-

lection in his junior year, but in
jured his knee so badly that rein
juries kept him out for a .full sea
son. This year his knee still both
ered him but improved enough in
recent weeks to prove that Clark de
serves a place with the pair he suc
ceeded.
His greatest season is too recent to
need rehashing, but Stanford will
never forget that FRED LEDEBOER
was the man who carried the load
when Fay and Paulman were in the

hospital. He did well in every
backfield position, usually for 60
minutes, and will be hard to replace.
PETE ZAGAR spent his sopho
more year in the sun, and gained
ail-American recognition for his
fast, aggressive game at left tackle.
Then the hospital bug flies fiend
ishly over the Stanford practice field
picked out the biggest, toughest man
he could see, and it was Zagar. He
lost 15 pounds just as his second
varsity season got under way and
had lost nearly 40 when it closed.
He did not regain full weight and
health until a week before this year's
Big Game, and his performance
since has shown that Zagar might
easily have been and was to a great
extenf what experts had predicted
three years ago.
BILL KIRSCH was one of the fin
est defensive backs on the Coast, and
did a good job of carrying the ball
until he injured his knee in, an early
scrimmage this year.
BILL McELROY was an expert
pass catcher for the Cards during
his two years of competition, and
has handled the right flank with
skill and aggressiveness, particularly
on defense.
GLENN HAMILTON will be re
membered for triple threat talent
and for his performance on several
occasions when his bullet-like pass
es pulled the Indians out of the hole.
JIM SADLER transferred from
Menlo Junior College last year will)
an injured knee that has never been
fully cured. He played a good game
in spite of his handicap and was a
valuable tackle replacement.
JJAMP POOL is worrying confer
ence officials now. but there is
no reason why he should not be eli
gible another year. He played Plebe
iootball at West Point, before he
transfen-ed to Stanford, an informal
type of competition for first-year
men. He would have been eligible
there for three years on the Army
varsity, and if the powers forbid
him the rights of other transfers,
they'll have little to prove their
case.
