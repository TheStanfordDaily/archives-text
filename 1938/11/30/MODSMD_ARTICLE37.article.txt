# Ex-Footballers Try Diamond Drill
## 
### 
Now that the grid season is over'
several footballers will be hanging j
up their moleskins and donning a
pair of baseball spikes in an attempt
to bolster Coach Harry Wolter's 1939
team.
Most of these are outfielders and
will fit in nicely because of the lack
of talent in this department. Pros- ,
pective outfielders who have just j
wound up a grid season are Thor'
Peterson, Wally DeWitt, Cookie j
South, and Bill Clark.
Another department on the base
ball squad that is reported sadly !
lacking in that concerned with soph- 1
omore managers. All freshmen or
sophomores interested, in gaining
credit for gym through this medium i
are urged to get in touch with John !
Hewitt, 202 Toyon.
