LAST Saturday the thirtieth annual National
Interfraternity Conference came to an end
in New York City, alter a session which heard
one long-established belief disproved, and an
other strongly criticized.
The first, according to a clipping sent on by
Bud McDuffie, Stanford Interfraternity Council
president, is the ancient shibboleth that mem
bership in a fraternity tends to send scholastic
averages shooting downward; the second is the
carefully nurtured feeling that the whole fra
ternity structure will collapse if "Pre-Initiation"
activities are abandoned.
Commenting on the scholarship, a report
presented to the Conference stated that the
scholastic standing of fraternity men, higher
than that of non-fraternity men since 1930, has
completed its eighth consecutive year of su
premacy with a 60 per cent increase in its
margin of leadership.
Whether this is due to, or in spite of, the fra
ternity, the report does not say; but since it
seems unlikely that individual students could
raise an average so high, it seems safe to state
that it must be a group achievement; that fra
ternities, far from having a bad effect, are actu
ally active agents in furthering good scholar
ship.
Regarding "Pre-Initiation," the Conference
heard Dean Fred H., Turner of the University of
Illinois condemn it as "the most absurd and
most asinine paradox to be found in the edu
cational world today. Paddling and 'hell week'
are hazing, and hazing has been ruled out of
every self-respecting college and university in
the country."
With the Dean, the Conference presumably
agreed. Certain it is that the effort throughout
the country has been to minimize hell week
activities, cut down on the features of pre-initia
tion which have made it in the past more a
public nuisance than a private rite. In line with
this tendency, the Farm's own program has
resulted this year in a unified period, directed
and virtually controlled by the Interfraternity
Council, its more objectionable features almost
entirely done away with.
Pre-Initiation probably appeals too much to
the latent strain of torture-chamber in The Boys,
ever to be abandoned completely; but it is an
encouraging sign that the National Conference
is doing what it can to reduce it to a logical
place in the scheme of fraternity life.
A group which can show so good a national
scholastic record ought to be able to grow up
enough to do away with the last and most un
necessary hold-over from the Good Old Days.
A.S.D.
