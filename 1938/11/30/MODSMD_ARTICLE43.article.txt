THE DAILY, after scoring metropolitan col
umnists and alumni for venturing to meddle
with Stanford's athletic business, now reverses
its field with a qualifying statement which adds
the word "some" before the phrase "columnists
and alumni."
For, in the mail today was a short note from
Bill Leiser, columnist and alumni, which is
worthy of reprinting. It adds the final note of
unanimity to the story:
As a newspaper man I have the olcl-tash
ioncd idea that the business of employing or
firing a coach is the University's business, not
the newspaper's.
As an alumnus of Stanford University 1
have the idea that the coach who should be
employed is the coach the students, includ
ing the players, want.
The first test of any coach is what the play
ers think of him.
It's pretty plain that the students, including
the players, are solid for Tiny Thornhill. This
being the case, the issue, as far as 1 am con
cerned, is closed. V/hat various alumni might

think is interesting but unimportant.
It's only incidental that I happen to teel
sure the students and players, in backing
Mr. Thornhill, are entirely on the right track.
That's for one columnist.
Another in the parade was Harry Borba,
Monday, when he outlined pretty clearly the
process of nonthinking which blamed Tiny for
Pete Fay's illness, for Standlee's injuries, and
the host of other hard luck breaks, wound up
saying, "But Thornhill will get his new appoint
ment when the time comes."
The parade has started. And, as Leiser says,
the issue is closed. Stanford wants Thornhill.
Stanford should keep him.
Let the storm subside.
