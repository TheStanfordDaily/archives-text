# BULL SESSION

### JOHN COBBS 
WITH A BANG BANG
COME TIME yesterday an anonymous hand thumb
tacked a clipping addressed to me on The Daily
bulletin board. In the professionally dispassionate
terms of a news story, it reads: "Bucharest—Dr. Fran
cis Stefanescu-Doanga, rector of the University of
Cluj, was wounded critically by two shots today and a
detective accompanying him was killed. Before the
director lost consciousness, he said he believed the
perpetrators were students."
It is always hard to backtrack the motives behind
anonymous notes, and unless some amateur detectives
want to try out their mail-order fingerprint kits, the
origin of I his one will remain in the shadows. I hardly
think that it is a suggestion. This close to finals a pot
shot at a professor would be tactless to say the least.
It doesn't sound like a threat; and as far as I know
all my friends have perfect alibis*.
But even though the motives of my correspondent
are as mysterious as the third chapter of a detective
story, it is interesting to note that life in the European
universities is not quite the swash-buckling melodrama
that novels make il out.
Ordinarily we arc a little jealous of the students in
central Europe. We know that they take part in poli
tics, that they strike and revolt. We wonder some
times if we couldn't transplant their system to the
Farm.
JJUT this clipping indicates that regardless of how
we may feel about it, Stanford can never take over
their methods. Our system couldn't stand it.
Even the assassination of a minor instructor would
stall the machinery of Farm government. Ex Com
mittee would appoint a subcommittee to consider the
problem. At the following meeting the sub-committee
would report that it had called the campus cop and
had decided that Men's Council should handle the
matter.
Men's Council would deadlock as to whether shoot
ing a professor was a violation of the honor code or
simply conduct unbecoming. Women's Conference
would then decide that shooting around the campus
had an unsettling effect on* Stanford women, and
would assume complete jurisdiction.
si« * # s|:
In the meantime various officials would be deplor
ing mention of the sniping, pointing out that it brought
unfavorable publicity to Stanford, and that there was no
use in calling attention to such unpleasant things.
The cashier's office would hasten to add to the syl
labus fees an item for replacement of professors dam
aged by students. And undoubtedly the A.S.S.U. would
be billed for the funeral.
In the end the assassin would probably be readmit
ted if he promised to be in bed by 10:30 every night
and to drink only milk. But in the meantime our gov
ernment would have folded like an opera hat.
Undoubtedly the gay life of European universities
would be pleasant. But if the shooting of professors
is an unavoidable by-product, we just can't afford it.

we may feel about it, Stanford can never take over
their methods. Our system couldn't stand it.
Even the assassination of a minor instructor would
stall the machinery of Farm government. Ex Com
mittee would appoint a subcommittee to consider the
problem. At the following meeting the sub-committee
would report that it had called the campus cop and
had decided that Men's Council should handle the
matter.
Men's Council would deadlock as to whether shoot
ing a professor was a violation of the honor code or
simply conduct unbecoming. Women's Conference
would then decide that shooting around the campus
had an unsettling effect on* Stanford women, and
would assume complete jurisdiction.
si« * # s|:
In the meantime various officials would be deplor
ing mention of the sniping, pointing out that it brought
unfavorable publicity to Stanford, and that there was no
use in calling attention to such unpleasant things.
The cashier's office would hasten to add to the syl
labus fees an item for replacement of professors dam
aged by students. And undoubtedly the A.S.S.U. would
be billed for the funeral.
In the end the assassin would probably be readmit
ted if he promised to be in bed by 10:30 every night
and to drink only milk. But in the meantime our gov
ernment would have folded like an opera hat.
Undoubtedly the gay life of European universities
would be pleasant. But if the shooting of professors
is an unavoidable by-product, we just can't afford it.
WITH A BANG BANG
COME TIME yesterday an anonymous hand thumb
tacked a clipping addressed to me on The Daily
bulletin board. In the professionally dispassionate
terms of a news story, it reads: "Bucharest—Dr. Fran
cis Stefanescu-Doanga, rector of the University of
Cluj, was wounded critically by two shots today and a
detective accompanying him was killed. Before the
director lost consciousness, he said he believed the
perpetrators were students."
It is always hard to backtrack the motives behind
anonymous notes, and unless some amateur detectives
want to try out their mail-order fingerprint kits, the
origin of I his one will remain in the shadows. I hardly
think that it is a suggestion. This close to finals a pot
shot at a professor would be tactless to say the least.
It doesn't sound like a threat; and as far as I know
all my friends have perfect alibis*.
But even though the motives of my correspondent
are as mysterious as the third chapter of a detective
story, it is interesting to note that life in the European
universities is not quite the swash-buckling melodrama
that novels make il out.
Ordinarily we arc a little jealous of the students in
central Europe. We know that they take part in poli
tics, that they strike and revolt. We wonder some
times if we couldn't transplant their system to the
Farm.
JJUT this clipping indicates that regardless of how
we may feel about it, Stanford can never take over
their methods. Our system couldn't stand it.
