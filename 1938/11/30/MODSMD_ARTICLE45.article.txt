One of Stanford's senior women belongs or once
belonged to some Y.YV.C.A. group or something of the
sort, and went on a camping trip with them or some
thing of the sort, and wrote a song for them called,
"I Want To He a Mother."
That she wrote a song titled "I Want To Be a
Mother" is very definite.
And one lonely night a while ago, probably a
Friday night, she left her room alone and walked to
the library. As I said, it was a lonely night. There was
no one around any place—so she began singing very
loudly. "I want to be a mother."
Just as she reached the Libe steps she bellowed out
at full strength, "I want to be a mother!"
A guy stepped out of the shadows and said quietly,
"May I be of any help?"

Some of the boys and girls at the game Saturday
had but little love for one of the substitute football
players. They sat in the rooters' section for several
consecutive mniutes periodically calling him harsh
names.
A nice lady sitting behind them heard their re
marks. She had some connection with the football play
er or with the football player's mother or with someone
who knew the football player's mother.
She leaned over and tapped one of the guys. ''If
you say one more thing about him," she said, "if you
say one more thing about him, I'll slap your faces."
They said not one more thing about him.

Several weeks ago a guy went to one of his
classes, easily and quickly fell asleep and stayed sol
idly asleep for the whole hour.
At the end of the lecture the professor woke him
up and asked him to come to his office with him. The
guy came.
And the professor pulled out a thermos bottle of
coffee, poured the guy some, and went through his
lecture attain.

A guy called up Casa Ventura the other night be
cause he thought it would be a fine tiling to have a
date with one of the Iraq girls living there.
He didn t know the girl he wanted the date with,
so when he got a foreign accent on the phone right
off the bat. hi- said to himself, this is the one. and
started in on his line.
He went on for quite a while. Occasionally a few
foreign sounding words would drift in over the phone,
but they did nothing to encourage him.
Until he found he was talking to the Japanese
house-cleaner.

A guy called up Casa Ventura the other night be
cause he thought it would be a fine tiling to have a
date with one of the Iraq girls living there.
He didn t know the girl he wanted the date with,
so when he got a foreign accent on the phone right
off the bat. hi- said to himself, this is the one. and
started in on his line.
He went on for quite a while. Occasionally a few
foreign sounding words would drift in over the phone,
but they did nothing to encourage him.
Until he found he was talking to the Japanese
house-cleaner.
WIXU
One of Stanford's senior women belongs or once
belonged to some Y.YV.C.A. group or something of the
sort, and went on a camping trip with them or some
thing of the sort, and wrote a song for them called,
"I Want To He a Mother."
That she wrote a song titled "I Want To Be a
Mother" is very definite.
And one lonely night a while ago, probably a
Friday night, she left her room alone and walked to
the library. As I said, it was a lonely night. There was
no one around any place—so she began singing very
loudly. "I want to be a mother."
Just as she reached the Libe steps she bellowed out
at full strength, "I want to be a mother!"
A guy stepped out of the shadows and said quietly,
"May I be of any help?"

Some of the boys and girls at the game Saturday
had but little love for one of the substitute football
players. They sat in the rooters' section for several
consecutive mniutes periodically calling him harsh
names.
A nice lady sitting behind them heard their re
marks. She had some connection with the football play
er or with the football player's mother or with someone
who knew the football player's mother.
She leaned over and tapped one of the guys. ''If
you say one more thing about him," she said, "if you
say one more thing about him, I'll slap your faces."
They said not one more thing about him.
