## Anglo-American Alliance Set As Argument Subject 
### 
For the sixth annual forensic
contest on the convicts' home ter
ritory, Farm Debaters Sherm Mellin
koff, Syd Terry, and Stan Anderson
will go to San Quentin Sunday to
uphold the affirmative of the Anglo-
American Alliance question before
an audience of 500 inmates.
"The Stanford-San Quentin de
bates were inaugurated in 1932 as a
sort of a joke," said Leland Chapin,
varsity debate coach. "And they
have turned out to be some of the
most closely contested battles of
the season."
The prison squads, contrary to
expectation, have not been composed
of thugs and hoodlums. Farm rep
resentatives in past years have been
pitted against big-time swindlers,
world travelers, college professors,
a bank president, and an Oxford
graduate. "Of course," Mr. Chapin
observed, "you see we always meet
a select group."
Although they have lost some, the
majority of the debates throughout
the years have been won by Stan
ford. Once, however, the prison
squad alibied after a defeat. "Just
you wait," they said, "we're get
ting a new team-mate soon—the
former debate coach from the Uni
versity of California."
"The Sun Quentin debaters," Mr.
Chapin went on to say, "take the
contests very seriously and spend a
good deal of time in the prison li
brary looking up material in prepa
ration of their cases. Sometimes the
record of the debates counts toward
parole."
