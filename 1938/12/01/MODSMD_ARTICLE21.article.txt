# Lima Parley Will Consider American Union
## Colombia, Republic Of Santo Domingo To Present Peace Plans 
### 
Drawn up by Santo Domingo and
the Republic of Colombia, what may
be the blue-print for an American
League of Nations goes before the
eighth Pan-American Conference at
Lima, Peru, next, week, carrying in
its provisions a guarantee for
peace and mutual protection in the
Western Hemisphere.
Released to The Daily for publi
cation by Professor Graham Stuart
of the political science department,
the draft of the proposed treaty car
ries as its most significant feature
the substitution of rigid and auto
matic economic sanctions for the im
practical military controls estab
lished in the Covenant of the
League of Nations at Geneva.
VIOLATIONS
Guaranteeing the territorial in
tegrity and political independence of
member states, Article 23 establish
es a definite program of retaliation
against any American state violating
its provisions. Beginning with with
drawal of the chiefs of diplomatic
missions, the punishment will pro
ceed through rupture of diplomatic
relations; rupture of consular rela
tions; rupture of all communications;
the stopping of all imports and ex
ports; prohibition of market quota
tions on the money and securities of
the aggressor state; and an embargo
of all ships and cargoes in the ports
of member states which arc destined
to go to the aggressor state.
WAR RENOUNCED
Aggression from abroad is to be
met by immediate joint military ac
tion; the treaty upholds reduction
of armaments, but only so far as is
"consistent with safety."
Regarding the settlement of po
litical conflicts between Americar
nations, war is renounced and pro
vision is made for the automatic
transformation of the League—offi
cially styled "The Congress of the
Association of American Nations" —
into a Tribunal of Conciliation
Should conciliation fail, the differ
ence is to be submitted to Ihe Per
manent Court of International Jus
tice at The Hague, whose dccisioi
will be final.
Relations with the League of Na
tions at Geneva are to receive <
unique handling. Article 26 provide;
that the two Leagues are not in an;
way incompatible; that, on the con
trary, "a bond of regular and per
| manent collaboration should be es
j lablished by mutual agreement be
11 ween the two organizat ions."

JOINT POLICY
This bond, the article states, may
take the form of a joint declaration
of policy; or it may be an actual
physical relationship, with each or
ganization sending delegates to the
other. Further, Article 27 provides
that the American League will
designate the American countries to
be presented as candidates for Ihe
Council of the League at Geneva;
and goes on to say that they will
act at Geneva, not as individual
states, but as representatives of the
American League, a situation which
might place the United States in a
position of strong influence with the
League of Nations, which it has
never joined—a policy of eat-your
cake-and-have-it-too virtually un
precedented in world affairs.
The only weakness discoverable in
the treaty is that it permits member
.states to withdraw if their vetoes of
amendments are over-ridden — a
question which will probably not
arise at a time when European
conditions make close co-operation
in the Western Hemisphere virtu
ally imperative.
