# Stuart Approves New All-America League Proposal
## All-American Parley to Meet in Peru; Status of Canada to Be Discussed 
### ALLEN DRURY 
Before the month of Dcccmbcr ends, the Western Hemisphere from
Hudson's Bay in Canada to Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America
may be under the control of an American League of Nations.
What would be the most progressive step ever taken in the political
progress of the New World will be the chief item on the agenda of the

Eighth International Conference of
American States which opens in
Lima, Peru, on December 9; and ac
cording to Dr. Graham Stuart of the
political science department, an au
thority on Latin American afTaii-s, it
stands a very good chance of being
approved by the delegates.
Pointing out that the proposal —
which would establish a consulta
tive and judicial body empowered to
enforce its decrees by. economic
sanctions —will be presented by the
Dominican Republic and the Repub
lic of Colombia rather than by the
United States, Dr. Stuart expressed
his confidence that this would re
move the stigma traditionally at
tached to anything connected with
the "Colossus of the North."
U.S. IN BACKGROUND
"The United States is going to re
main discreetly in the background
on this," he said. "We will support,
the plan; we will not propose it. Any
pressure we may exert will be along
the line of friendly co-operation
with the other Latin American re
publics. We will not run the risk
of having a moment made psycho
logically perfect by the recent Eu
ropean crisis ruined by the old cry
that we are trying to dominate the
continent."
Defense will also be a major issue
at the conference, Dr. Stuart said,
indicating that it would tie in with
the league proposal. Recent state
ments by President Roosevelt re
garding the necessity for a unified
Pan-American military program
have been favorably received by all
the Latin American states; and con
structive action will undoubtedly be
taken.

STATUS OK CANADA
The position of Canada in Pan-
American affairs, long a question
mark, will probably be decided
definitely by the conference, Dr.
Stuart said. A formal invitation to
join will probably be issued before
the meeting adjourns.
"The completion two weeks ago
of the reciprocal trade agreements
with Canada and Great Britain have
lied Canada in closely with the eco
nomic set-up in North and South
America. This will mean two things:
an increase in the number of trade
treaties between the United States
and Latin America, in an attempt to
pass on the benefits gained in the
British pacts; and a much closer
political co-operation between Can
ada and the American republics.
"Until now Canada has not been
asked to join the Pan-American
Conference because its membership
is limited to strictly sovereign states.
To all intents and purposes, however,
she is virtually independent, now;
and the time seems ripe to recognize
her as such. The invitation will
probably make complete separation
from England—in regard to foreign
policy, that is — a prerequisite to
membership; and it seems improb
able that any objection will be
raised, either by England or the Do
minion itself."
AMERICAN DELEGATION
Commenting on the composition of
the American delegation to the con
ference, which he characterized as
"the most political, from a domestic
standpoint, ever sent abroad," Dr.
Stuart noted that it had been care
fully selected with the idea that a
League treaty will actually be drawn
I up—and that when it is, it will need
l public support in this courtly.
"All" Landon will satisfy the Re
publicans; Katherine Lewis, daugh
ter of the CIO chairman, and Dan
Tracy, president of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
will satisfy labor; the Rev. John
O'Hara, president of Notre Dame
| University, will satisfy the Catholics;
; acting as an unofficial observer will
be Louise Wright, a high-ranking
officer of the League of Women Vot
ers; so that it would seem that Mr.
Roosevelt is making sure that what
ever happens at Lima will be sup
ported by the American people."
Passage of the treaty in the Amer
ican Senate will be accomplished
with little difficulty. Dr. Stuart feels.
Congress has never interfered with
I Latin-American policy; and the con
' ference comes at a crucial time in
1 world history.

A series «f 87 aeronautical charts
covering the United States has
been completed by the Coast and
Geodetic Survey for use by air
plane pilots.

Twenty-eight foreign merchant I
ships have a greater tonnage than
the Manhattan and Washington, the I
largest liners Hying the United

What would be the most progressive step ever taken in the political
progress of the New World will be the chief item on the agenda of the

Eighth International Conference of
American States which opens in
Lima, Peru, on December 9; and ac
cording to Dr. Graham Stuart of the
political science department, an au
thority on Latin American afTaii-s, it
stands a very good chance of being
approved by the delegates.
Pointing out that the proposal —
which would establish a consulta
tive and judicial body empowered to
enforce its decrees by. economic
sanctions —will be presented by the
Dominican Republic and the Repub
lic of Colombia rather than by the
United States, Dr. Stuart expressed
his confidence that this would re
move the stigma traditionally at
tached to anything connected with
the "Colossus of the North."
U.S. IN BACKGROUND
"The United States is going to re
main discreetly in the background
on this," he said. "We will support,
the plan; we will not propose it. Any
pressure we may exert will be along
the line of friendly co-operation
with the other Latin American re
publics. We will not run the risk
of having a moment made psycho
logically perfect by the recent Eu
ropean crisis ruined by the old cry
that we are trying to dominate the
continent."
Defense will also be a major issue
at the conference, Dr. Stuart said,
indicating that it would tie in with
the league proposal. Recent state
ments by President Roosevelt re
garding the necessity for a unified
Pan-American military program
have been favorably received by all
the Latin American states; and con
structive action will undoubtedly be
taken.

STATUS OK CANADA
The position of Canada in Pan-
American affairs, long a question
mark, will probably be decided
definitely by the conference, Dr.
Stuart said. A formal invitation to
join will probably be issued before
the meeting adjourns.
"The completion two weeks ago
of the reciprocal trade agreements
with Canada and Great Britain have
lied Canada in closely with the eco
nomic set-up in North and South
America. This will mean two things:
an increase in the number of trade
treaties between the United States
and Latin America, in an attempt to
pass on the benefits gained in the
British pacts; and a much closer
political co-operation between Can
ada and the American republics.
"Until now Canada has not been
asked to join the Pan-American
Conference because its membership
is limited to strictly sovereign states.
To all intents and purposes, however,
she is virtually independent, now;
and the time seems ripe to recognize
her as such. The invitation will
probably make complete separation
from England—in regard to foreign
policy, that is — a prerequisite to
membership; and it seems improb
able that any objection will be
raised, either by England or the Do
minion itself."
AMERICAN DELEGATION
Commenting on the composition of
the American delegation to the con
ference, which he characterized as
"the most political, from a domestic
standpoint, ever sent abroad," Dr.

of the reciprocal trade agreements
with Canada and Great Britain have
lied Canada in closely with the eco
nomic set-up in North and South
America. This will mean two things:
an increase in the number of trade
treaties between the United States
and Latin America, in an attempt to
pass on the benefits gained in the
British pacts; and a much closer
political co-operation between Can
ada and the American republics.
"Until now Canada has not been
asked to join the Pan-American
Conference because its membership
is limited to strictly sovereign states.
To all intents and purposes, however,
she is virtually independent, now;
and the time seems ripe to recognize
her as such. The invitation will
probably make complete separation
from England—in regard to foreign
policy, that is — a prerequisite to
membership; and it seems improb
able that any objection will be
raised, either by England or the Do
minion itself."
AMERICAN DELEGATION
Commenting on the composition of
the American delegation to the con
ference, which he characterized as
"the most political, from a domestic
standpoint, ever sent abroad," Dr.
Stuart noted that it had been care
fully selected with the idea that a
League treaty will actually be drawn
I up—and that when it is, it will need
l public support in this courtly.
"All" Landon will satisfy the Re
publicans; Katherine Lewis, daugh
ter of the CIO chairman, and Dan
Tracy, president of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,
will satisfy labor; the Rev. John
O'Hara, president of Notre Dame
| University, will satisfy the Catholics;
; acting as an unofficial observer will
be Louise Wright, a high-ranking
officer of the League of Women Vot
ers; so that it would seem that Mr.
Roosevelt is making sure that what
ever happens at Lima will be sup
ported by the American people."
Passage of the treaty in the Amer
ican Senate will be accomplished
with little difficulty. Dr. Stuart feels.
Congress has never interfered with
I Latin-American policy; and the con
' ference comes at a crucial time in
1 world history.

Before the month of Dcccmbcr ends, the Western Hemisphere from
Hudson's Bay in Canada to Tierra del Fuego at the tip of South America
may be under the control of an American League of Nations.
What would be the most progressive step ever taken in the political
progress of the New World will be the chief item on the agenda of the

Eighth International Conference of
American States which opens in
Lima, Peru, on December 9; and ac
cording to Dr. Graham Stuart of the
political science department, an au
thority on Latin American afTaii-s, it
stands a very good chance of being
approved by the delegates.
Pointing out that the proposal —
which would establish a consulta
tive and judicial body empowered to
enforce its decrees by. economic
sanctions —will be presented by the
Dominican Republic and the Repub
lic of Colombia rather than by the
United States, Dr. Stuart expressed
his confidence that this would re
move the stigma traditionally at
tached to anything connected with
the "Colossus of the North."
U.S. IN BACKGROUND
"The United States is going to re
main discreetly in the background
on this," he said. "We will support,
the plan; we will not propose it. Any
pressure we may exert will be along
the line of friendly co-operation
with the other Latin American re
publics. We will not run the risk
of having a moment made psycho
logically perfect by the recent Eu
ropean crisis ruined by the old cry
that we are trying to dominate the
continent."
Defense will also be a major issue
at the conference, Dr. Stuart said,
indicating that it would tie in with
the league proposal. Recent state
ments by President Roosevelt re
garding the necessity for a unified
Pan-American military program
have been favorably received by all
the Latin American states; and con
structive action will undoubtedly be
taken.

STATUS OK CANADA
The position of Canada in Pan-
American affairs, long a question
mark, will probably be decided
definitely by the conference, Dr.
Stuart said. A formal invitation to
join will probably be issued before
the meeting adjourns.
