### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
fascist terror firmly
grips Nazi Germany, it re
ceived a death-blow in Rumania
today with King Carol's order for
a ruthless purge of the iron guard,
fascist anti-Semitic organization.
Corneliu Aelea Codranu, leader of
Roumania's Nazi terrorists, and lo
of his aids were killed at Ramnicu-
Sarat yesterday in what officials de
scribed as a break for freedom as
they were being transferred to a jail
at Bucharest. The iron guardists had
been imprisoned on charges of mur
der and high treason.
As arrests were being made
throughout the nation upon the or
der of the Dictator-King, fascist ter
rorists warned Carol "to make peace
with the Rumanian people, or we
will find another solution." The
purge by no means signifies a swing
I<> the left in Rumania; King Carol's
powers are absolute, and his pur
pose was merely to crush all oppo
sition to his royal dictatorship.

IN FRANCE today the outlook
on internal affairs was bright as
Premier Edouard Daladier crush
ed the attempted one-day general
strike, but foreign affairs took a
turn for the worse with Italian de
mands for cession of French col
onies.
Daladier's military requisitioning
of vital services and mass conscrip
tion of workers in government serv
ices were responsible for his victory
over laborers who opposed his ex
tension of the 40-hour week and
abolition of other economic reforms
gained under Communist Leon
Blum.
Only 10 per cent of the French
workers actually struck yesterday.
The projected mass walk-out was
doomed when thousands of troops
and mobile guards moved into stra
tegic industrial areas and operated
trains and other transportation
services under the military conscrip
lion decree.
Premier Daladier emerges from
the crisis with prestige unequalled
since Aristide Briand broke a rail
road strike in 1!)10; it is expected
that he will assume powers prac
tically amounting to dictatorship
in order to destore internal order
in a chaotic France. Meanwhile
he has ordered the punishment of
labor leaders, strike demonstrators,
and several thousand civil employ
ees as provided by French labor
Jaws.

advances for accord
with Italy were seriously shak
en yesterday when, on the first pub
lic appearance of French Ambassa
dor to Rome Francois Poncet, a wild
demonstration took place demanding
the return of French colonies for
merly belonging to Italy.
Interrupting a speech by Italian
Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo
Ciano before the Chamber of Depu
ties in Rome, Secretary of the Fascist
Party Starace led the deputies
shouting, "Tunisia! Savoy! Nice!
Corsica!" The demonstration was
especially significant because it took
place in the presence of the French
ambassador, sent to Italy to seek a
pact of friendship.
Count Ciano was interrupted as
he was revealing the fact that
during the Czechoslovak crisis
Italy was ready to give immediate
aid to the Reich in case of a gen
eral European war.

paign continued on its sadistic
way yesterday with the issue of the
first formal decree of ghetto regula
tions providing for restriction of
Jews to specific districts and order
ing them not to leave their houses
at certain times.
Nazi officials explained the tre
mendous number of Jewish deaths
during the last few days to suicides
and inability to withstand the
rigours of life in concentration
camps. However, no reports of mur
der or abuse within the camps are
allowed to cross the German fron
tier.

IN FRANCE today the outlook
on internal affairs was bright as
Premier Edouard Daladier crush
ed the attempted one-day general
strike, but foreign affairs took a
turn for the worse with Italian de
mands for cession of French col

Daladier's military requisitioning
of vital services and mass conscrip

over laborers who opposed his ex
tension of the 40-hour week and
abolition of other economic reforms
gained under Communist Leon

Only 10 per cent of the French
workers actually struck yesterday.
The projected mass walk-out was
doomed when thousands of troops

trains and other transportation
services under the military conscrip

Premier Daladier emerges from
the crisis with prestige unequalled
since Aristide Briand broke a rail
road strike in 1!)10; it is expected
that he will assume powers prac

in order to destore internal order

labor leaders, strike demonstrators,

ees as provided by French labor
