# Trueblood Discusses Alice in Wonderland
## 
### 
"Although Americans usually 1
associate July 4th with the libera
tion of America from England, it is
my hope that "Alice in Wonderland,"
of which Stanford owns the manu
script edition and which also came
into being on July 4th, will always \
indicate a new bond between the
two countries. England has given \
us this story which is loved by all j
children."
Such was the underlying thought I
in yesterday's Luncheon Club dis
cussion of the book, ''Alice in Won
derland," by Dr. D. Elton Trueblood.
It will be his last talk before he
leaves for a six months' stay in Eng
land.
"Reverend Charles L. Dodson of
Christ Church in England conceived
the story, which takes place in an
entirely different world — a rabbit
hole—in order to entertain three lit
tle girls whom he was taking on a
picnic," said Dr. Trueblood. "He

used Alice, his second daughter, as
the heroine of his impromptu tale.
The story was later made info book
form by Lewis Carroll and as such
has pleased children around the
world.
"In addition to appealing to chil
dren by its humor and fantasy, this
story holds much for adults reading
between the lines. There is a sur
face world and a real world behind
it, such as the rabbit hole. Grown
people have forgotten reality; -chil
dren see through pretense to the
truth.
"The world has a secret which
grown-ups can't find," declared
Dr. Trueblood. "All who know it
are little ones, and they won't tell."
Because rabbit fur dyes well, it is
used in great quantities in imita
tion of squirrel, seal, beaver, nutria,
chinchilla, muskrat, ermine, leopard,
and other furs.
