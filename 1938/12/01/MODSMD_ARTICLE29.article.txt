# Card Cagers, Dons To Clash Tomorrow
## 
### 
For the firs! time in three years of strong basketball teams, Stanford's
cagers will go into a lilt not the odds-on favorites to come through with a
cinch victory, as the case was in the "Laughing Boys" era.
The case will be the Card-University of San Francisco practice con
flict on the Pavilion floor tomorrow night, when the 19118-39 edition of the

Luisetti-less club opens its basket-*
ball campaignâ€”its first under the
tutelage of Coach Everett Dean.
No form of judgment will be
passed on the present club until
after this week's series with U.S.F.
on Friday, and then Fresno State
College here Saturday night. The
regular conference season does not
open until the middle of January,
while a series of practice games has
been arranged for Christmas vaca
tion as well as at the start of the
winter quarter.
Word comes from U.S.F. that the
Dons will average better than six
feet, a situation which will find the
Cards slightly dwarfed with the
tentative first-string line-up. With
a few substitutions, Coach Dean
could build up the height of the club
to cope with the invaders but he
would undoubtedly lose the advan
tage of the fast offensive club with
which he has been working this
week.
CARDINALS SHORT
Capt. Phil Zonne will be stationed
at center and may be the tallest
starting Stanford man on the floor
at (5 feet 4 inches. Derrol Huddle
son and Leon LaFaille, possible for
ward starters, average 5-11 each.
Bob Burnett, standing 5-8, and Dick
Lyon, reaching up 0-3 into the
ozone, may be named to the starting
guard posts.
The varsity went through its sec
ond vigorous drill yesterday, with
the purpose of allowing the coach
ing staff to pick the line-up and pos
sible early substitutes in the first
game. "B" games for those who
don't get into the varsity matches
will be held after the main event.
Freshman basketballers play San
Jose High School and Modesto Jay
see in afternoon set-to's.
