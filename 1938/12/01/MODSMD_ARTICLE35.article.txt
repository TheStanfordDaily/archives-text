# Fox Cinches N.Y. Light-Heavy Bid
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 29 (UP). â€”
"Tiger" Jack Fox of Spokane, Wash.,
scored a convincing, if not sensa
tional, victory over A1 Gainer 'of
New Haven, Conn., at the Coliseum
Tuesday to clinch a bout with Mello
Bettina of Beacon, N. Y., for the
New York version of the world's
light heavyweight title.
Fox's unoi'thodox, crab-like style
kept the New Englander guessing
from the start. He scored with hard
left hooks to the body and tossed
rights to the head from the most
peculiar angles. The Pacific Coast
puncher raised a lump under Gain
er's right eye in the sixth, and by
the end of the fight it had closed to
a bare slit.
The New York Commission no
longer recognizes John Henry Lewis
as the 175-pound titleholder because
of Lewis' refusal to meet Fox, the
local body's No. 1 challenegr.
