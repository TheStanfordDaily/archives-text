Hopes for a thorough practice,
and possible victory, were washed
into the gutters as rain drowned out
yesterday's varsity soccer tilt with
Menlo J. C. The game may possibly
be played at a future date, it was

The Card squad will meet the
strong University of San Francisco
soccermen in the last scheduled
game of the season next Saturday on

out for blood, as a victory would give
a chance shot at the coveted confer
ence and another shot at the Cali
fornia Bears. In addition, the booter
boys will be fighting to place some
team members on the mythical all
conference eleven.
