# U.S. Offers Wassermanns Free to Farm
## 
### 
Free Washermann tests for all stu
dents desiring them will be given at
the Student Health Service this
coming Saturday morning between
the hours of 9 and 11 o'clock, ac
cording to an announcement made
yesterday by Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
general director of the School of
Hygiene and Physical Education.
Given as part of a joint research
program carried on by the United
States Public Health Service, the
tests are an attempt to ascertain
why positive reactions are sometimes
produced in patients who have
never been exposed to syphilis. They
are being conducted at a number of
schools and universities through
out the country.
Stanford's participation in the pro
gram comes in response to the invi
tation of Dr. Charles W. Barnett of
the Stanford .Medical School, who is
also largely responsible for the gov
ernment's action in undertaking the
investigation.
