I With an undefeated yearling foot
ball te am as an inspiration, Coach
! Beebs eLe's frosh basketballers get
i their season under way tomorrow
I r
| afternoon in the Pavilion when they
tangle with San Jose High at 4
| o'clock. No admission will be
! charged.
I Lee has been heartened by the
improvement his quintet has shown
j in recent practice sessions, and fig- 1
I ures them natural favorites over the
I prep team. However, Saturday at 4
o'clock Modesto invades the Pa
j vilion to play the Papooses and the
j student body president-coach re-!
] fuses to concede a chance in the
| world for a Stanford victory.
Modesto has been Northern Cali
fornia jaysee hoop champion two
| years running, and critics claim that
i last year's outfit could have given
any Coast Conference .squad a good
j tussle. Modesto is a farm for U.S.C.
| and is coached by Jack Gardner,
j former Trojan forward.
STARTING TEAM
Lee will start the following team
against San Jose: Joe Messina and
Dick Ray, forwards; Bob Penn, cen
ter; and Hal Sams and Bill Cowdin, j
guards. Saturday's line-up will be
i determined on how the team per-
I forms tomorrow.
i Messina, from Marshall High in
| Los Angeles, is only 5-6 but is a
j flashy shot and clever ball-handler,
j Ray comes from Lowell and is an j
excellent dribbler and sharp de
fensive player. Chuck Smith,'
former Piedmont flash and best shot
on the team, is giving both these
boys a tough fight and only his er
ratic play is keeping him oft' the
first team.
Bob Penn, who towers 5 inches
over 6 feet, carries himself re
markably well for his height and is i
effective under the basket on both .
offense and defense.
I COWDIN KEY MAN
Cowdin, key man of the yearling i
defense, was instrumental in leading
Lowell to a 20-18 victory over last j
year's frosh team and Lee is glad to j
see him on ihe Card side of the I
fence this year. Sams, an Oakland i
j product, is a fast, clever ball handler, |
j although Bob Scharback, who play
ied forward in high school, is closely
j pressing him.

i last year's outfit could have given
any Coast Conference .squad a good
j tussle. Modesto is a farm for U.S.C.
| and is coached by Jack Gardner,
j former Trojan forward.
STARTING TEAM
Lee will start the following team
against San Jose: Joe Messina and
Dick Ray, forwards; Bob Penn, cen
ter; and Hal Sams and Bill Cowdin, j
guards. Saturday's line-up will be
i determined on how the team per-
I forms tomorrow.
i Messina, from Marshall High in
| Los Angeles, is only 5-6 but is a
j flashy shot and clever ball-handler,
j Ray comes from Lowell and is an j
excellent dribbler and sharp de
fensive player. Chuck Smith,'
former Piedmont flash and best shot
on the team, is giving both these
boys a tough fight and only his er
ratic play is keeping him oft' the
first team.
Bob Penn, who towers 5 inches
over 6 feet, carries himself re
markably well for his height and is i
effective under the basket on both .
offense and defense.
I COWDIN KEY MAN
Cowdin, key man of the yearling i
defense, was instrumental in leading
Lowell to a 20-18 victory over last j
year's frosh team and Lee is glad to j
see him on ihe Card side of the I
fence this year. Sams, an Oakland i
j product, is a fast, clever ball handler, |
j although Bob Scharback, who play
ied forward in high school, is closely
j pressing him.
