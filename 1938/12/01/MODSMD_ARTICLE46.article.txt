# 10-Cents-A-Saturday
## 
### 
CHICAGO'S young educational drum-beater,
President Robert M. Hutchins, is making a
fine thing out of Saturday Evening Post articles.
Sometimes he writes on one subject, some
times on another—but it always sounds sen
sational.
First it was a scream against technical
courses; now he cries "Down with intercol
legiate athletics." In both cases, Hutchins made
the headlines. In a blaze of fast talking and
speedy literary style, he sounds each time as
if he had something.
But has he? In the first instance, he cited
journalistic courses as fine examples of uni
versity time-wasters—failing to take into ac
count the fact that newspapers over the United
States now make a B.A. degree in journalism
practically a prerequisite to a job. In his latest
article, Hutchins proposes lowering football
prices to 10 cents per student on the grounds
that the schools themselves should pay for
their athletics out of pocket, not out of proceeds.
That's just fine. Ten cents would fit ad
mirably into the undergraduate budget. But
where, does Mr. Hutchins think, do full univer
sity pockets come from if not out of proceeds?
Perhaps his scheme, however, is really a
subtle plan to get rid of high priced athletics
altogether: adopt his 10 cent plan, the school
goes broke trying to feed the monster of ath
letics it hatched 20 years before, and the mon
ster itself finally starves to death.
If this demise is his ultimate goal, perhaps
he has something.
But the method he chooses to reach that goal
smacks strongly of a certain pension plan which
California voted down last month.
There was a laudable end in that case, too—
the care of old people. And there was a plan,
a fine and dandy one—the Thirty Thursday.
Now Mr. Hutchins feels a need—to de-empha
size intercollegiate sport. He has a plan besides
—the 10-cents-every-Saturday program.
And it would be just about as effective a
means to spear high-priced athletics as the pen
sion plan was in its field.
Mr. Hutchins has some other ideas. Walter
Camp was one of the first to suggest them:
put the coaching job more on the basis of a
professional position; let every student have a
chance to participate; emphasize games which
can be played later in life.
These are very good ideas. Of course, they
are pretty old.
But given a good lead paragraph—a second
Thirty Thursday plan, say—and they sell well
to the Saturday Evening Post.

These are very good ideas. Of course, they
are pretty old.
But given a good lead paragraph—a second
Thirty Thursday plan, say—and they sell well
to the Saturday Evening Post.
CHICAGO'S young educational drum-beater,
President Robert M. Hutchins, is making a
fine thing out of Saturday Evening Post articles.
Sometimes he writes on one subject, some
times on another—but it always sounds sen
sational.
First it was a scream against technical
courses; now he cries "Down with intercol
legiate athletics." In both cases, Hutchins made
the headlines. In a blaze of fast talking and
speedy literary style, he sounds each time as
if he had something.
But has he? In the first instance, he cited
journalistic courses as fine examples of uni
versity time-wasters—failing to take into ac
count the fact that newspapers over the United
States now make a B.A. degree in journalism
practically a prerequisite to a job. In his latest
article, Hutchins proposes lowering football
prices to 10 cents per student on the grounds
that the schools themselves should pay for
their athletics out of pocket, not out of proceeds.
That's just fine. Ten cents would fit ad
mirably into the undergraduate budget. But
where, does Mr. Hutchins think, do full univer
sity pockets come from if not out of proceeds?
Perhaps his scheme, however, is really a
subtle plan to get rid of high priced athletics
altogether: adopt his 10 cent plan, the school
goes broke trying to feed the monster of ath
letics it hatched 20 years before, and the mon
ster itself finally starves to death.
If this demise is his ultimate goal, perhaps
he has something.
But the method he chooses to reach that goal
smacks strongly of a certain pension plan which
California voted down last month.
There was a laudable end in that case, too—
the care of old people. And there was a plan,
a fine and dandy one—the Thirty Thursday.
Now Mr. Hutchins feels a need—to de-empha
size intercollegiate sport. He has a plan besides
—the 10-cents-every-Saturday program.
And it would be just about as effective a
means to spear high-priced athletics as the pen
sion plan was in its field.
Mr. Hutchins has some other ideas. Walter
Camp was one of the first to suggest them:
put the coaching job more on the basis of a
professional position; let every student have a
chance to participate; emphasize games which
can be played later in life.
These are very good ideas. Of course, they
are pretty old.
