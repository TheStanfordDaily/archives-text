# Peace from Peru
## 
### 
ONE HUNDRED and fifteen years ago to
morrow President James Monroe estab
lished the Doctrine which has controlled United
States policy in regard to Latin America ever
since. The anniversary falls just one week
before the eighth Pan-American Conference
opens at Lima, Peru.
Between December 2, 1823, and Deecmber 9,
1938, the Monroe Doctrine has undergone many
changes. It has been weak (for over forty years
nobody even remembered it); it has been
strong. It has been used to prevent European
imperialism and used to excuse U. S. im
perialism; it has been the prophet of Dollar
Diplomacy and the guardian angel of the Good
Neighbor policy. And always it has been dom
inated by one unswerving purpose: The Amer
icas for the Americans.
Elsewhere in The Daily can be found the
digest of a treaty which is basically nothing but
the Monroe Doctrine, made bilateral and given
a few teeth other than those provided by the
United States of America. Because that treaty
is going to be presented to the Lima Confer
ence, and because world conditions make it
likely that the Lima Conference will accept it
either as it stands, or with moderate changes
the anniversary of Mr. Monroe's address is
going to receive a celebration greater than it
ever has before.
What the treaty proposes to do is establish
an American League of Nations, independent
of Europe, yet interlocking with it. Co-operation
with the League at Geneva is provided for in
a way which makes it virtually certain that the
American republics will act, not as individuals,
but as a block -as a definite political unit, a
major division not only of the world's physical
surface, but of its political surface as well.
The Americas, in short, are waking up. They
are beginning to assume the position of leader
ship, never exercised, which has for so long
been rightfully theirs. They are getting ready
to take the first constructive step toward what
is probably the only real guarantee of collec-

tice peace: they are beginning to think in terms
of a regional League.
One hundred and fifteen years after Lima,
the nations may well look back upon a century
> of peace in which the League of Asiatic Na
, tions, the United States of Europe, the American
League, and the League of Russia and the
Slavic States have managed to work out their
conflicts and keep the peace. They may be
able to point with pride to an era in which
co-operation has been a real and living thing;
: when four houses have stood united enough
so that they would not fall, yet divided enough
; so that they could not encroach upon the
rights of others. They may be able to point
to lasting Peace.
And when they do, being possibly fair
minded men in that far-off day, they may re
j member that the initial impulse came from the
! West; that out of the nations across the At
i lantic, and more particularly out of one great
; nation across the Atlantic, there came the in
-1 spiration for the building of a new world upon
I the unhappy ruins of the old.
