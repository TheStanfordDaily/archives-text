### JOHN COBBS 
BOMBS RUSH
COMMITTEE opened up another guerrilla war
fare drive against movie monopoly last Tuesday
night, when it authorized final arrangements for Sun
day night, films next quarter. Present strategy calls
for a series of foreign or "classical" movies, with a 15-
cent. admission price; screeno, bank night, and amateur
hours will be unconstitutional.
All in all, the project looks like one of the most
attractive Causes that has come along recently. Revo
lutions have been fought for less; in fact, one of the
I main drawbacks to Excom's plan is that it doesn't
! involve any bombing of theaters or firing squad work
J on producers. But pleasant though the scheme is, it
| doesn't relieve that chronic annoyance that weighs
within us like an indigestible dinner.
| There is no valid reason why Stanford should be
forbidden to have any movies it wants. Last year we
had regular Sunday shows, which not only made money
but also scored a new record in psychological juggling
by pleasing the administration, the students, and the
Ex Committee. The series was choked of! suddenly
when the gods of Hollywood decided that local theaters
must be protected from its competition.
Ex Committee squirmed when the edict was is
sued; it appointed sub-committees, and wrote letters.
But the movie industry quietly ignored it and went
j ahead providing an illustration of how monopoly
power is exerted. Today Stanford has to be satisfied
i with foreign or classical pictures.
* * *
r jpilE proposed series will make an excellent consola
tion prize, but we can't expect it to be full settle
ment for the program the Hollywood rulei took from
us last spring. We still have to go to loci. I theaters
whenever we want an American picture, and the sight
of their complacently entrenched monopoly won't make
j us feel any better about our own lost Cause.
The neighboring movie palaces are pillars of the
business community. They pay their taxes and con
form to the building laws. But their tactics in enter
tainment are almost grounds for justifiable homicide.
An admission price of 40 cents would have been called
piracy in any age but. this. Second features compare
very favorably with the best tortures the Spanish In
quisitors devised.
* * * a|c
But it is the crowd situation which makes the un
fair competition excuse a rude mockery of our intelli
gence. When a Stanford man goes to a local movie
on a week-end, he has to prepare for a wait that
j would discourage the most fanatic sit-down striker. At
! the door an attendant smirks, and assures him, "Just
j a 10-minute wait. They're going in now." And so after
paying his 40 cents the student waits half an hour
while the feather in some woman's surrealistic hat
i jabs him in the neck. If he is lucky he finally man
ages to get a seat in the last row of the balcony where
! a billowing smoke screen obscures the stage.
; Our Sunday night foreign movies will be a pleasant
I and valuable project. But I am still in the market
j for a good correspondence course in nihilism.

BOMBS RUSH
COMMITTEE opened up another guerrilla war
fare drive against movie monopoly last Tuesday
night, when it authorized final arrangements for Sun
day night, films next quarter. Present strategy calls
for a series of foreign or "classical" movies, with a 15-
cent. admission price; screeno, bank night, and amateur
hours will be unconstitutional.
All in all, the project looks like one of the most
attractive Causes that has come along recently. Revo
lutions have been fought for less; in fact, one of the
I main drawbacks to Excom's plan is that it doesn't
! involve any bombing of theaters or firing squad work
J on producers. But pleasant though the scheme is, it
| doesn't relieve that chronic annoyance that weighs
within us like an indigestible dinner.
| There is no valid reason why Stanford should be
forbidden to have any movies it wants. Last year we
had regular Sunday shows, which not only made money
but also scored a new record in psychological juggling
by pleasing the administration, the students, and the
Ex Committee. The series was choked of! suddenly
when the gods of Hollywood decided that local theaters
must be protected from its competition.
Ex Committee squirmed when the edict was is
sued; it appointed sub-committees, and wrote letters.
But the movie industry quietly ignored it and went
j ahead providing an illustration of how monopoly
power is exerted. Today Stanford has to be satisfied
i with foreign or classical pictures.

whenever we want an American picture, and the sight
of their complacently entrenched monopoly won't make
