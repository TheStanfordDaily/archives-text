! I heard this story from someone who couldn't prove
j it, and I'm not. going to try and prove it myself. Be
j cause I'm afraid it's true. It's about a Farm female.
She is young and beautiful and popular and lives
j in Lagunita.
She has been having a nice stack of dates, so many
j that someone the other day told her she was cutting
! her own throat by having so many dates. She was
j told, by this very practical person, that some guys
i were worth going with and some guys weren't worth
j going with. Maybe one of the good ones would take
! her sometime, and maybe he would want to take her
; out again—and find her dated up far in advance by
| guys not worth going out with.
Maybe that had happened already.
The Farm female listened and was convinced.
She went up to her room and made a list of all the
1 people who had taken het; out in the last few months.
I After their names she put, as closely as she could fig
ure. the amount of money each one had spent on
her.
And decided to date exclusively the one she found
; had spent the most money on her.

Over the vacation a guy was dancving al a place
Over the vacation a guy was dancing at a place
unusual thing happened to him.
But then he is rather unusual himself, or at least
his hair is. It's very thick and curly and never combed,
j You can't imagine what it's like if you have never
I seen it.
So he was dancing along at the Palomar with his
| tfirl and all that hair. I don't think there is anything
| unusual about his dancing. I mean, I can't see him
I gliding along with a dreamy look in hi.s eyes with that
: wild hair of hi.s waving in time to Mr. Krupa's drum
J beats. No, that would be too much.
But as he was dancing, some woman there started
| following him with her eyes, and then actually follow
! ing him. All of a sudden she literally pounced on
j him and began vigorously rubbing her hands through
his hair.
"I—l just couldn't resist," she said
| And giggled And hurriedly left.

STANFORD IS MARRIACiE MARKET
! I heard this story from someone who couldn't prove
j it, and I'm not. going to try and prove it myself. Be
j cause I'm afraid it's true. It's about a Farm female.
She is young and beautiful and popular and lives
j in Lagunita.
She has been having a nice stack of dates, so many
j that someone the other day told her she was cutting
! her own throat by having so many dates. She was
j told, by this very practical person, that some guys
i were worth going with and some guys weren't worth
j going with. Maybe one of the good ones would take
! her sometime, and maybe he would want to take her
; out again—and find her dated up far in advance by
| guys not worth going out with.
Maybe that had happened already.
The Farm female listened and was convinced.
She went up to her room and made a list of all the
1 people who had taken het; out in the last few months.
I After their names she put, as closely as she could fig
ure. the amount of money each one had spent on
her.
And decided to date exclusively the one she found
; had spent the most money on her.

FROSiI
Over the vacation a guy was dancving al a place
Over the vacation a guy was dancing at a place
unusual thing happened to him.
But then he is rather unusual himself, or at least
his hair is. It's very thick and curly and never combed,
j You can't imagine what it's like if you have never
I seen it.
So he was dancing along at the Palomar with his
| tfirl and all that hair. I don't think there is anything
| unusual about his dancing. I mean, I can't see him
I gliding along with a dreamy look in hi.s eyes with that
: wild hair of hi.s waving in time to Mr. Krupa's drum
J beats. No, that would be too much.
But as he was dancing, some woman there started
| following him with her eyes, and then actually follow
! ing him. All of a sudden she literally pounced on
j him and began vigorously rubbing her hands through
his hair.
"I—l just couldn't resist," she said
| And giggled And hurriedly left.
