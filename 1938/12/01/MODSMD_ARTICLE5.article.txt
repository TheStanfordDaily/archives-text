Executive Council of the junior
class will hold its first meeting to
night at 7:30 o'clock in the Women's
Clubhouse. The committee which
includes members from practically
all campus living groups, will have
charge of all activities of the Class
of '40.
Patterned after the system used by
Dave Ryus in the administration of
junior affairs last year, the group
will concern itself with general class
policy. It will also supervise the
formation of all committees, al
though they will not necessarily be
chosen from the council member
ship.
Presiding at tonight's meeting will
be Class President Ken Cuthbertson,
assisted by Secretary - treasurer
Sally Holt. The plan of a represen
tative body to share in the handling
of class affairs proved entirely sat
isfactory last year. Representatives
of the University of California vis
ited the Farm earlier this quarter to
examine the system with the pros
pect of organizing Berkeley's huge,
heterogeneous classes in the same
way.
