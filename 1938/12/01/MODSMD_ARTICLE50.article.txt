# Orchesis Wins Acclaim For Dance Recital
## 
### 
An amusing satire on the WPA,
and a beautiful performance of a
dance drama, "The Juggler of Notre
Dame," based on an old French
legend, added greatly to the appeal
of the dance recital presented last
night in the Memorial Theater by
the Stanford Orchesis group.
A beautiful demonstration of the
methods of dance technique was
staged by the student dancers, in
their first public performance. The
first part of the program illustrated
the methods of acquiring strength
and flexibility for dance movement.
Dorothy Wilkins, Stanford student,
wrote original music to accompany
the fall study section of the pro
gram. An interesting percussion
study illustrated the possibilities of
a close alliance of the dance with
the musical arts.
"Themes of Celebration" was the
basis for a dance pattern danced to
music by Josephine Haskell, and de
veloped by last year's Choreography
classes.
High spot of the program was the
presentation of "The Juggler of
Nutre Dame." The prelude from an
old legend was read by J. P. Calm,
setting the mood of the drama. Jes
sica Fleming as the Juggler, and
Margo Crane as the Madonna de
serve orchids for their interpreta
tions of the principal roles of the
drama.—Cordner.
