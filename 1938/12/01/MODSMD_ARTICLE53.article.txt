The Editor, Sir:
There are many of us who sit in
our easy chairs and wonder why
; the German people ever let a man
iof the calibre of Hitler take their
powers and liberty away from them.
The answer seems to lie in the fact
that they aren't, or rather weren't,
alert. I have recently discovered a
I nefarious attempt to undermine the
liberties of the Stanford students.
Sequoia is staging a surrealistic barn
; dance!
Do you realize that if such a dance
is staged the subconscious mind
might take control of Stanford.
Where would our liberties go if we
took up thinking in terms of im
pressionism. What would become of
the virtue of the Stanford woman
(that precious thing so highly re
garded by the Women's Confer
ence) if she is seen through the im
j pressions upon the subconscious of
her escort. I think that for the good
of the morals of Stanford such things
| should be suppressed.
I Do you realize that only last year
Dean Culver characterized the at
titude of the men sitting in the Un
ion Cellar as "visual rape"? Consider
then what would happen if the Stan
ford woman were placed at the
' mercy of the subconscious of the
Stanford man. This whole matter
i appears to me to be an un-American
plot to destroy all that is noble in
Stanford.
