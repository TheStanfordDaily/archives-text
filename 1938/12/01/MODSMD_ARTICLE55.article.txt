# HYMAN KAPLAN AGAIN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I anticipate possible misin
! tcrpretations of your story on my
lecture to the journalism group at
i Stanford (in your issue of Novem
ber 23)? Your reporter said, quot
ing me, that "One reason a pub
lisher wants a Washington corre
spondent is for the prestige value
| . . . the publisher then can pass
: along such confidential stories as
Secretary Perkins being secretly en
[ gaged to Harry Bridges, or Presi
dent Roosevelt's being accused of
â€¢ stealing rare stamps from his
j friends."
These are obviously preposterous
illustrations which I used in order
| to impress my helpless listeners with
the extraordinary and absurd gulli-
I bility of those who accept utter gos
j sip as gospel truth. Need I empha
-1 size the fact that both illustrations
fall into the realm of high comedy?
Some people believe that Miss
Shirley Temple is an Alaskan mid
get. aged 32.
Painfully yours,
Leo C. Rosten
(Leonard Q. Ross)
