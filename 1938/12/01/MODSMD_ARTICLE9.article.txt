# U. C. Student To Speak Here
## 'Anti-Nazi Refugees' To Be Theme of Talk 
### 
"Problems Facing German Refu- ;
gee Students" will be the subject of
an A. S. U. and "Y" sponsored lec
ture to be given tonight by Miss
Gerti Landaucr, a senior at. the
University of California and a for
mer resident of Germany, at 7:30
o'clock in the auditorium of the
Women's Clubhouse.
Miss Landauer and her father,
Professor Carl Landauer of the
Economics Department of the Uni
versity of California, have been in
extremely close contact with many
of the refugee students through
friends, both in Germany and re
cently arrived in America. An at
tempt will be made to portray the
lives of college students under the
Hitler regime, and the injuries in
flicted upon Jewish and anti-Nazi
students.
In the "News and Views" of Oc
tober 31, 1938, Miss Landauer may
be quoted as saying: "It is today a
commonplace to say that a great
many people who are eager for
learning are excluded from the uni
versities of some European states.
But very few of us realize what
untold misery and danger lies be
hind this commonplace."
The Jewish students are not the
only ones who are being discrim
inated against in Germany, accord
ing to Miss Landauer in the same
article. "More than 40 per cent of
the students who are applying to the
International Student Service today
are not of Jewish descent."
Immediately following the lecture,
which is open to Stanfordites, an
informal reception has been planned
for Miss Landauer by the Trans
fer Group of the "Y." All interested
friends are invited to attend, ac
cording to Marion Guyselman, gen
eral chairman. Dorothy Beattie is in
charge of refreshments.
