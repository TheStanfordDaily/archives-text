# THE 						A.S.S.U. CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO STANFORD: A NEW BOATHOUSE
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
NOW it's five rows of concrete piling and some bare, unpainted
foundation work, springing from the southeastern rim of
Lake Lagunita.
But when Stanfordites return from Christmas vacation, the
Farm's new $10,000 boathouse will be completed, according to
announcement made yesterday by Tom Killefer, student man
ager.
Taking the prize-winning plans submitted to the A.S.S.U. by
Dick Spencer, Architect Ernie Wiehe rounded into shape designs
diving platform may be erected a short distance from the edge

that were approved by Excom a month ago when final contracts
were signed. Construction work is in the hands of Contractor
George Wagner, represented locally by Marty Martinez.
The 25-year-old boathouse began to topple week before Big
Game as wreckers salvaged some wood, stacked the waste mate
rial for use in the bonfire. Last week additional wood was moved
to the site of the new structure, piling for the foundation was
laid, a construction office was established and workmen started
raising the superstructure.
As pictured by Wiehe, the new boathouse will be a single
story in height, with two large wings stretching out from a pen

tagonal center section. General shape of the building will be
that of a wide-angle open triangle. First floor will house some :
50 canoes arranged so that they can be carried to the lake easily ;
through large sliding doors. ,
Center portion will contain an attendant's office and two
student rooms. Above will be a glass-enclosed lounge, dressing
rooms for men and women. Roof of the two wings will form
a modern sun-deck, complete with appropriate outdoor furniture.
Floats will line the entire front of the building, while a special
of the boathouse.
Preliminary financing of the project has been assured by a

grant from the general A.S.S.U. fund, Killefer said. "We don't
expect to borrow any money this year," he continued. "But we
hope to realize the $7500 needed from a Boathouse Weekend that
Ex Committee now has under consideration." Tentative plans
have set the drive for the week-end of March 4, Bob Moulton,
chairman of the affair, disclosed. "It's the weekend of the Cal
basketball game down here and most people will stay on
campus," Moulton said. Assisting him will be Lloyd Wilson,
though no committee has as yet been named.
So when Stanford returns to school in January, it will have
one more Christmas present to stack with its others.
