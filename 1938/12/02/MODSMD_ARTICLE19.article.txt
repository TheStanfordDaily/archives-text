### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
E JEACE on earth stands between
the devil and the deep today. On
the credit side of the ledger are
Mussolini's announcement that he
will join the 1936 naval agreement,
Britain's program of mobilization
for civil defense.
On the debit side are hints that
Italy may resort to war il France
does not meet her territorial de
mands, King Carol's campaign to
wipe out the fascist Iron Guards in
Rumania, Japan's threat to control
all Chinese trade with the western
world, and a new outbreak of
strikes in France in response to the
liring of workers in reprisal for the
abortive general strike.
There is a deficit on the ledger.

Fear of a Hungarian invasion to
recapture territory which was ced
ed to Rumania at the close of the
World War was believed responsible
lor Dictator-King Carol's ruthless
program of mass arrests, dismissal of
army officers suspected of Nazi sym
pathies, and military occupation of
aroused districts.
The campaign for the suppression
of the Iron Guards, which opened
yesterday with the killing of their
leader, Corneliu Codreanu, and 13 of
his associates, was set oft by re
ports that Hungary might try to
i/.e the province of Transylvania,
on the twentieth anniversary of its
union with Rumania.
It is certain, however, that the re
pression of the anti-Semitic, Nazi
fascist body accomplished King Car
ol's purpose of making his royal
dictatorship absolute.

A threat to Franco-Italian accord
was an article printed last night in
the Leghorn Telegrafo threatening
that Italy may resort to war to re
gain her former colonies from
France.
Wednesday's demonstration by the
Italian Chamber of Deputies, de
manding the cession of Tunis, Savoy,
Nice .and Corsica, was backed up
liy Mussolini's order yesterday for
military conscription of natives in
Lybia, next door to the French col
ony of Tunis.
While Italy whispered threats to
dove and olive branch by announc
peace, she shouted support to the
iiiM that she would join the 1936
naval accord which was signed by
France, the United States, and Great
Britain.

| N FRANCE Premier Daladier
banged his newly-acquired mailed
list, upon the table and ordered the
wholesale discharge of 700.000
workers guilty of participating in
the projected general strike which
was supposed to tie up the country
last Wednesday.
Immediately he was answered by
a new wave of strikes which he is
attempting to crush by armed force,
troops and mobile guard re-enforce
ments occupy centers of disturbance
throughout France today. Armed
with tremendous prestige gained in
crushing the general strike, Dala
dier has summoned Parliament to
meet next Thursday to approve his
labor reforms and a three-year pro
gram of national recovery.

in an uncertain Europe, England has
m recent weeks been concentrating
