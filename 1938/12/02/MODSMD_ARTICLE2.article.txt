# Universities, Health Dept. Join Forces
## Results Raise Query In Wassermann Tests Throughout Nation 
### 
Thirteen universities are aiding
the United States Public Health
Service in its study of positive Was
serman test reactions from persons
who have never been exposed to
syphilis.
From Yale and Harvard on the
East coast to Stanford and Califor
nia on the West, approximately 10.-
000 tests are being administered by
a committee of doctors working un
der government auspices with the
age group which shows least com
parative incidence of the disease,
and is judged to be least exposed
to contact with it.
Outgrowth of a "Conference on
the Significance of Positive Sero
logical Reactions in Unexposed Hu
man Beings," the research program
includes two main phases: compara
tive tests will be made of patients
with known syphilis, patients with
a positive reaction .normal animals,
syphilitic rabbits, and normal hu
mans; and lymphatic transfers will
be made from patients with the
positive reaction to experimental
rabbits.
Purpose behind the study, ac
cording to Dr. Thomas Storey of the
8.A.C., is to prove whether or not
the Wasserman test is as infallible
as its reputation says it is. An in
creasing number of unexplainable
positive reactions have lead some
physicians to question it; the gov
ernment's research program is the
answer.
Free Wassermans for Stanford
students will be given at Men's
and Women's Health Services to
morrow morning between 9 and 11
o'clock. Further tests will be held
next quarter during the month of
January.
