# Iturbi to Play On January 4
## Famed Artist to Give Second Farm Recital 
### 
Still remembered for his appear
ance on the Stanford oncert Series
in 1932. Jose Iturbi will again play
the piano for a Farm audience when
he appears in Memorial Hall the day
after winter quarter registration,
Jan. 4.
Although Iturbi has been known
in the United States for less than ten
years, he and his music were part of
the public life of his birthplace, Va
lencia, Spain, when he was seven
years old. He studied at home and in
Barcelona before he was sent to
Paris by a purse collected by Va
lencians for that purpose.
In Paris he earned his living by
playing in cafes all night and he at
tended the Conservatory by day,
graduating with first honors when he
was 17. Later, he held for four
years a position which Franz Liszt
once filled, that of head of the piano
faculty at the Conservatory of Ge
neva.
Having played 20 recitals in six
weeks in Mexico City in 1933, the
Spanish pianist seized the oppor
tunity to step from keyboard to po
dium. He has conducted many fa
mous orchestras since then and is
now permanent director of the Roch
ester Philharmonic.
"Iturbi's stick technique, like his
piano technique, serves a musical
purpose, and that purpose is a fine
respect for the composer. Iturbi
knows one of the principal secrets ol
Toscanini: that music must sing,"
wrote Robert A. Simon in the New
Yorker.
Iturbi, whose programs are famous
for their variety, is not a specialist
in the music of any composer. He
is interested in Beethoven and Bach
as well as modern music. "I think
the ultra-moderns have more 01
less lost their way and do not know
quite where they are going. Much oi
what they write seems to me to be
music to be read rather than to be
played," he says.
During Christmas vacation the
special seats which are to be set uj
for the concert will be available at
the A.S.S.U. office and at Davie
Keeble's in Palo Alto. All of these
seats are $2.
