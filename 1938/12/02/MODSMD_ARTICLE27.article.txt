### 
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Dec. 1
, (UP). â€”A Denver, Rio Grande and
Western Railroad freight train, trav-
I eling at almost a mile a minute
| through a snowstorm, smashed into
, a school bus at a grade crossing near
i here today, killing 23 school children
and the bus driver and injuring 18
! other children, some so critically
i they were not expected to survive.
Not a single person of the 42
aboard the bus escaped injury or
death in Utah's worst traffic tragedy.
The accident occurred at a cross
ing near Lampton, a beet-loading
1 station 15 miles south of Salt Lake
j City at a few minutes before 9
| o'clock this morning.
Farrold Silcox, of Riverton, Utah,
j driver of the bus carrying students
;to the Jordan High School, stopped
his bus at the crossing and then
j proceeded across the tracks.
| The train, bearing down on him at
! 52 miles an hour, struck the bus in
the center, crushed it, and carried
the wreckage several hundred feet,
strewing it along the tracks as En
gineer E. L. Rehmer. a railroad vet
eran, strove frantically to slop the
i 85-car train.
The exact cause of the accident
probably never will be known be-
I cause of Silcox's death.

Railroad officials, through W. E.
Speakman, said they were confident
Rehmer and his crew were not re
sponsible for the accident.
He said that the train speed, of
52 miles an hour, was "normal" and
that the engineer had sounded his
whistle several times as he ap
proached the crossing. There are no
obstructions at the crossing which
would interfere with the bus driv
er's vision, he said.
