### BUD AMES 
Out of the bleak cold north lands .
the tepid Stanford campus has
me Clarence Rusch with icicles i
ill dripping from his bushy eye- ;
ows. Yes, Clarence, the friend of
e eskimos from Milwaukee, has
me home to his native U.S.A., the
•id of automobiles and . home
oked chicken dinners done in the
iternity house style. But in spite
it all, there is regret in his eyes
he speaks of the friendly people
nong whom he worked and played
iring the past few years.
Clarence, who is now 28, after
ree years among the Alaska eski
os, has returned to the Stanford
mpus in order to earn his degree
sociology, a task which he hopes
complete in one year.
The young Milwaukeean, who
ok a civil service appointment in
laska because he "liked things that i
ere different," has for three years I
•en a teacher and recreational su-
Tvisor of the village of Koyukuk, I
jout 400 miles from Point Barrow,
Mthernmost tip of Alaska. He re
>rts that they have "real" weather
) there. For sixty days it would
• 20 degrees below zero.
•iKIMO DENTIST
When Rusch, a graduate of Mil
aukee State Teachers' College,
en! to Alaska, he thought his job
ould be like the one of the recrea
mal supervisor he had held at a
hool playground for two years. On
s arrival, however, he found that
-■ was supposed to become the
other of 175 Indians and Eskimos
ho looked to him for legal advice,
edical and dental treatment, teach
g and amusement. He lived in a
g cabin.
Willi his proverbial shingle
vinging in the Alaskan gales, Clar
ice set to work with brawn and
iers and daring his three year
top-over" he succeeded in talking
te trusting natvies out of 200 teeth
hich he yanked with no little
isto.
During the morning Rusch taught
ie three R's to some 45 children of
! ages. In the afternoon he or
mized games, or even minded, as
lly a true Milwaukeean can, a
jrsery school of Indian babies
hile their mothers worked. These
lildren presented him one of their
jad-embroidered dolls when he
ft Alaska for his return trip.
RGANIZES PLAYGROUND
Rusch organized the cutting of a
layground out in the trees. There
■i organized baseball and football
imes, evening songfests, clubs for
»ys and girls, and even a mothers'
üb, from which no doubt the Stan
»rd mothers got their first inspira
on. All hail the eskimos!
Our supervisor friend even went
> far as to give lessons in cooking

. and sewing, a fact which he admit
ted somewhat sheepishly.
March was the month of relaxa
; tion and games. It was a proud day
for Rusch when, after a winter of
practice, he won the three-mile race
on snowshoes. Only two other men
lived at Koyukuk with Rusch and
these two men were operators of
rival trading posts.
In spite of the fact that married
couples are favored for th£ super
visory positions, Rusch says he was
treated very hospitably by all the
natives, with whom he became the
best of friends. It is his hope that
some day, after earning his degree
jat Stanford, to return to Alaska as
supervisor of recreation and teach
ing.
