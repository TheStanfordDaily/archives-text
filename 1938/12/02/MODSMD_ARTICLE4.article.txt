# 'Tobias and Angel' Begins Run Tonight
## 
### MARJORIE PRAGER 
Amid Che swish of falling skirts and the scraping of moving scencry,
the dress rehearsal of "Tobias and the Angel" got under way last night.
A seven-foot fish, made from feather bolsters and inner tubes, appeared
beside the river bank; the dancing girls dropped the gossamer skirts to !
play a friendly game of ball, and the stage crew, dressed as Arabs, built a
lily pond, complete with lilies, in^

front of the audience.
When the curtain goes up tonight,
Saturday, and Monday at 8:15 o'clock
in the Memorial Auditorium, the
audience will see an apocryphal leg
end ti'ansformed into modern low
comedy. James Bridie has rejuve
nated a biblical legend, dressed it up
with colloquial dialect, and produced
one of the funniest comedies to ap
pear on the stage of the Memorial
Theater for many a moon.
The play, which kept London roar
ing for months, is well suited to the
talents of Douglas Bryan, Dan Hol
tom, Melba Rae Toombs, Robert
Coombs, Margaret Paulson and Gene
Callnon. The story concerns the ad
ventures of Tobias, a poor Nineveh
youth, and the Archangel Raphael,
disguised as a poor porter, on their
search for fortune and a rich wife
for Tobias.

DOG STEALS SCENES

Accompanied by the dog, Toby,
who does his best to steal the show
in tried and true theatrical manner,
they journey to Persia to collect a
debt for Tobit, the father of Tobias.
On the way he fights a seven-foot
fish on the banks of the Tigris and
subdues a bandit, but he has more
trouble in the person of Sara, the
beautiful but spoiled daughter of
his father's debtor.
The Oriental costumes were de
signed by Florence Hinds and Susie
Mae Lynch. They were made by
the costuming class, under the direc
tion of Mrs. Helen Green. Even the
wigs, including the brilliant gold one
worn by Sara, were created by stu
dents.

duction of "Tobias and the Angel"
for an evening of hilarity.
Amid Che swish of falling skirts and the scraping of moving scencry,
the dress rehearsal of "Tobias and the Angel" got under way last night.
A seven-foot fish, made from feather bolsters and inner tubes, appeared
beside the river bank; the dancing girls dropped the gossamer skirts to !
play a friendly game of ball, and the stage crew, dressed as Arabs, built a
lily pond, complete with lilies, in^

front of the audience.
When the curtain goes up tonight,
Saturday, and Monday at 8:15 o'clock
in the Memorial Auditorium, the
audience will see an apocryphal leg
end ti'ansformed into modern low
comedy. James Bridie has rejuve
nated a biblical legend, dressed it up
with colloquial dialect, and produced
one of the funniest comedies to ap
pear on the stage of the Memorial
Theater for many a moon.
The play, which kept London roar
ing for months, is well suited to the
talents of Douglas Bryan, Dan Hol
tom, Melba Rae Toombs, Robert
Coombs, Margaret Paulson and Gene
Callnon. The story concerns the ad
ventures of Tobias, a poor Nineveh
youth, and the Archangel Raphael,
disguised as a poor porter, on their
search for fortune and a rich wife
for Tobias.

DOG STEALS SCENES

Accompanied by the dog, Toby,
who does his best to steal the show
in tried and true theatrical manner,
they journey to Persia to collect a
debt for Tobit, the father of Tobias.
On the way he fights a seven-foot
fish on the banks of the Tigris and
subdues a bandit, but he has more
trouble in the person of Sara, the
beautiful but spoiled daughter of
his father's debtor.
The Oriental costumes were de
signed by Florence Hinds and Susie
Mae Lynch. They were made by
the costuming class, under the direc
tion of Mrs. Helen Green. Even the
wigs, including the brilliant gold one
worn by Sara, were created by stu
dents.
