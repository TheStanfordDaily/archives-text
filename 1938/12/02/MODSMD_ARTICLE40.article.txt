been moved up for this one month.
WAITING LIST
"Failure to sign cards will result
in the usual $5.00 penalty and may
mean removal from the list inas
much as a number of students are
on the waiting list, hoping to obtain
N.Y.A. employment for winter quar
ter.
"It is just as important that all
time sheets be turned in to the Ac
counting Department before leaving
the campus. Most of the supervisors
leave also and it is impossible for
the office to obtain any record of
work done.
REPORT HOURS
"Also, all students failing to work
the full number of hours assigned to
them must be sure to report these
hours to the student employment
office as soon as possible. Students

"Those students on the N.Y.A.
waiting list should check their ap
plications with Mrs. Coverly to be
certain that the financial statements
made are correct."
