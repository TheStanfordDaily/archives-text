# Trojans Polish Aerial Offensive
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1 (UP).â€”
At full strength for the first time in
more than a month, the University
of Southern California varsity was
paced through a light signal drill and
passing practice yesterday.
The Trojans were not permitted to
scrimmage, but Coach Howard Jones
polished up the aerial offensive in
signal drill. Blocking Halfback Bob
Hoffman, who has been on the bench
for the last two games, definitely will
start.
