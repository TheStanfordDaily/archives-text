# New National Park Planned by Congress
## 
### 
What is regarded as one of the
finest bits of unspoiled wilderness in
the State of California may next
year become a new National Park
if present plans are completed and
Congressional approval is given.
Cut by the three rushing forks of
the Kings River and topped by some
of the highest and most awe-inspir
ing mountains in all the Sierras, the
proposed Kings Canyon National
Park is at present the subject of a
bitter controversy between organ
ized sportsmen and the National
Park Service officials, who are sup
ported by many nature-loving pro
ponents of the park.
Hunters and sportsmen have ob
jected to the conversion of this area
into a park because it is one of the
last places in the Sierras to be un
spoiled by modern civilization. They
declare that it will spoil hunting,
hamper irrigation, and ruin this last
wilderness. The boosters of the
park, however, declare that pro
visions have been made for irriga
tion, and that restriction of hunting
in this area will foster more pro
fuse breeding of game animals and
therefore will furnish a greater sup
ply for the surrounding territory.
The rugged terrain and scenery
is similar to that of Yosemite Na
tional Park, though the canyons are
different in detail. There are not
so many unique rock features but a
much greater formation of age-old
rock carvings, worn down by the
flowing of swirling streams through
out the centuries.

Tehipite Dome is one of the out
standing sights, situated at the lower
end of Middle Fork Canyon and
rising 3700 feet above the canyon
floor. It is 100 feet higher than Yo
semite's El Capitan.
The whole section is dotted with
lakes, waterfalls, open meadows, and
great forests of cedar, pine, and fir.
To the south rises Mount Whitney,
highest peak in the United States,
and in the prospective park many
of the summits tower above the
14,000-foot mark.
In this magnificent setting may
spring up California's newest na
tional park. Congressman E. W.
Gearhart of Fresno has promised to
introduce the bill for the park's for
mation during the next session of
Congress in January.

rising 3700 feet above the canyon
floor. It is 100 feet higher than Yo
semite's El Capitan.
The whole section is dotted with
lakes, waterfalls, open meadows, and
great forests of cedar, pine, and fir.
To the south rises Mount Whitney,
highest peak in the United States,
and in the prospective park many
of the summits tower above the
14,000-foot mark.
In this magnificent setting may
spring up California's newest na
tional park. Congressman E. W.
Gearhart of Fresno has promised to
introduce the bill for the park's for
mation during the next session of
Congress in January.
