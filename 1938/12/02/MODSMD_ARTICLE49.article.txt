# Top One-acts Will Go to Fair
## Stagers Plan Entries In Exposition Contest 
### 
Winning plays entered in Stager's
one-act play contest will not only
be presented on campus, but, if suit
able, will be entered in a similar
contest being held in conjunction
with the 1939 San Francisco Expo
sition.
Names of winning plays and au
thors will be engraved on a plaque
donated by Stagers, to hang in the
foyer of Memorial Theater. Authors
of the top plays will also be invited
to join Stagers.
The competition is open to all
members of the student body, and
contestants are urged by Melba Rae
Toombs, director of the competition,
to have their entries in by Janu
ary 17.
As Stagers is particularly anxious
to discover new talent among Stan
ford students, the authors of the
winning plays will be asked to par
ticipate in the production or acting
side when the plays are presented
winter quarter.
