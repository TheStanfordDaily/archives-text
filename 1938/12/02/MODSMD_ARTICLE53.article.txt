# Schenck on Air Monday Night
## Speaker to Portray Modern Marco Polo 
### 
Travel by rail, bus, auto and air
j over the Asiatic route made famous
i by Marco Polo G43 years ago will be
described by Dr. Hubert G. Schenck,
j associate professor of geology, on
| the Stanford radio broadcast from
KGO next Monday at 8:30 o'clock.
Dr. Schenck, speaking on "Mod
| ern Marco Polos," will point out that
the country through which the
1 modern Marco Polos drive their cars
j is much different from the land of
Cyrus and Darius the Great, and
I of Abraham, Moses and Christ,
i The speaker will compare his ob
j servations made during a trip over
the historic route this summer, with
I Polo's written descriptions and the
i earlier Biblical writings. "For at
i least six thousand years the same
fundamental climate has prevailed
| over large areas of Asia and Africa,"
Dr. Schenck asserted.
"Bureaucratic regulations, im
proved roads, railroads, telegraphs,
filling stations and the like may be
expressions of westernization, but
they really are supeficialities. In the
main the character of the country
; has not changed for thousands of
; years. Explorers who get off the
principal routes meet with the same
; basic hardships that confronted Mar
j co Polo," he said.
