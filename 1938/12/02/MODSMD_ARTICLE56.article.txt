# A.S.U. Hears Simpson Talk On Unions
## 
### 
Saying that in 99 out of 100 la
bor arbitration cases, both parties
agreed to the arbitration board's de
cision, Gerald Simpson of the Pacific-
Coast Labor Bureau pointed out the
advantages of peaceful methods of
settling labor disputes at a meeting
sponsored by the Stanford chapter
of the American Student Union
Wednesday evening in the Women's
Clubhouse.
"A pretty good proportion of the
employers are willing to discuss dif
ficulties with union representatives,"
the young Stanford graduate said,
"but there is always that ten per
cent who don't believe in collective
bargaining and are out to beat you
from the start."
The Pacific Coast Labor Bureau
is under the direction of Harry P.
Melnikow and it is the only existing
office of its kind in the country to
day, the speaker said. It is a non
profit organization whose services
are available to both C.1.0. and
A. F. of L. unions.
Mr. Simpson is the first of a num
ber of prominent speakers on cur
rent affairs scheduled to appear on
the campus under the auspices of
the American Student Union this
year, according to Gene Glasmann,
president of the local chapter.
