### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
IVEKETT DEAN WILL MAKE IHS DEBUT
IS lIOOP TEAMS BEGIN 55-GAME SERIES

Stanford hoop squads will hit their basketball season head-on this
reek-end with six games of their 55-game schedule. Varsity, B squad,
nd frosh form an equation in three unknowns, and until they appeal in
ompetition, it will t;»ko more than a mathematician to solve it.
Everett Dean, who left an enviable record at Indiana to come out
Vest and take tip where John Bunn left off when he became Dean of
/leu, will make his debut tonight as Stanford basketball coach. HiS team
ucceeds one of the finest ever produced, and the Laughing Boys leit only
ne representative when they graduated last June.
So the new coach has been obliged to work with green, inexperienced
non. They have all the spirit and determination a coach could want, but
vhether or not they have fundamental basketball talent Is yet to be seen.
Already small of stature, Indian hoopsters are the shadows of
their former selves after hard out-of-doors exercise early in the
quarter. But they are in fine physical shape, and they go like lightning
in Dean's fast-breaking olTense, shaped to capitalize on the inherent
speed of small players.
Altering the Stanford type of play only in so far as changes fit the
material, the new coach has varied team tactics only slightly. Biggest
hange will be on defense. Where Butin stressed zone defense, Dean
■mphasizes assigned man-to-man work under the Stanford basket. There
vill be less shifting, only when necessary.
Dean has stressed offensive blocking in practice sessions in order to
increase use of such strategy and keep it legitimate so that the whistle
vill not blow constantly for illegal blocks. The Cards have also learned
o break fast when they get the ball on rebound from an opponent's
coring attempt.

[illegible] LUISETTI WOULD HAVE MADE
GOOD USE OF THIS YEAR'S RULES

Seating capacity problems have been .slightly increased in the Pavilion
vith the announcement of new basketball rules. The court has been
i ngthened four feet, two behind each basket.
Four feet from the basket to the boundary line instead of two, as it
used to be, will give the offense more room in which to maneuver and
improve officiating by decreasing the number of hair-line decisions
concerning players out-of-bounds. It is sad to think what Ilank Lui
setti might have done with his already unprecedented scoring record
if this rule had been made three years ago.
Where the whole free-throw key was previously sacred in that a man
• mid stay in it for only three seconds, the rule has been changed to permit
i nv 11 to st-'V in the outer half of the circle indefinitely unless he is in
jossession of the ball.
Permitting players extra rest, without penalty, the rules have been
•hanged to allow five time-out periods instead of four. Other changes
ire only slight.

BASKETBALL ROSTER INCLUDES MIDGETS
BUT DEAN WILL CAPITALIZE ON SPEED

I'HIL ZONNE, after two years' experience with the Laughing Boys, had
Stanford worried about his physical condition following a case of pneu
nonia, but he is in top shape now and will contribute his all-around hoop
dent as captain and center for the Cards. Indicating his confidence in
/ .onne, Coach Dean has said, ( 'I regard Phil as an outstanding basketball
layer and an excellent leader for the team."
LEON LAFAILLE has a good eye for shooting baskets, and has been
Inking them right and left in practice. Lafaille will be a forward for
He Indian five.
When the heal is on. DFRKOL HUDDLESON is at his best. He is fast
md alert, and will speed up Card offense from the other forward spot.
DICK LYON saw considerable action with Stanford's hoop champs, and
ms been shifted to guard because of his height, aggressiveness, and un
anny backboard skill. And to complete an already promising picture,
-yon's previous experience at center will give him a convenient edge on
■flense.
Speed will be the long suit played by 808 BURNETT, diminutive
first-string guard. And his basket shooting will pile up considerable
Stanford points.
With the absence of a quintet of champions. Coach Dean will find
considerable use for reserves this year, and he has a long list of men
who stack lip line beside the first stringers.

DEE AND CALDERWOOD STILL WITH CARD TEAM
BUT NOT WHERE WE'RE USED TO SEEING THEM

Watching the week-end events in the Pavilion will be a pair of hoop
■dars whom we'll miss plenty. Beebs Lee will be on hand as freshman
joaeh. while Jack Calderwood will be an assistant to Coach Dean. They
won't see what we sow when they were on the floor last year, and right
low nobody can predict just what they will see.
University of San Francisco will bring a team of veterans to Stanford,
hree of whom played first string last year. It will be a contest of veterans
igainst well-coached greenhorns, and the outlook now is for a toss-up.
Fresno State will come north with a team that is an unknown quantity,
•ven on a basis of previous records.
The week-end's games will have little significance in a conference way.
>ut they'll give us a chance to see two varsity teams and (he freshmen
under first. Two games will not be enough to tell the tale about the Big
Red Quintet, but we'll get a scant impression, and by the time they have
net Idaho, Dartmouth, and Oregon over Christmas vacation, Stanford will
enow its chances when the conference season opens against Southern Cali
fornia on January 13.

Stanford hoop squads will hit their basketball season head-on this
reek-end with six games of their 55-game schedule. Varsity, B squad,
nd frosh form an equation in three unknowns, and until they appeal in
ompetition, it will t;»ko more than a mathematician to solve it.
Everett Dean, who left an enviable record at Indiana to come out
Vest and take tip where John Bunn left off when he became Dean of
/leu, will make his debut tonight as Stanford basketball coach. HiS team
ucceeds one of the finest ever produced, and the Laughing Boys leit only
ne representative when they graduated last June.
So the new coach has been obliged to work with green, inexperienced
non. They have all the spirit and determination a coach could want, but
vhether or not they have fundamental basketball talent Is yet to be seen.
Already small of stature, Indian hoopsters are the shadows of
their former selves after hard out-of-doors exercise early in the
quarter. But they are in fine physical shape, and they go like lightning
in Dean's fast-breaking olTense, shaped to capitalize on the inherent
speed of small players.
Altering the Stanford type of play only in so far as changes fit the
material, the new coach has varied team tactics only slightly. Biggest
hange will be on defense. Where Butin stressed zone defense, Dean
■mphasizes assigned man-to-man work under the Stanford basket. There
vill be less shifting, only when necessary.
Dean has stressed offensive blocking in practice sessions in order to
increase use of such strategy and keep it legitimate so that the whistle
vill not blow constantly for illegal blocks. The Cards have also learned
o break fast when they get the ball on rebound from an opponent's
coring attempt.

[illegible] LUISETTI WOULD HAVE MADE
GOOD USE OF THIS YEAR'S RULES

Seating capacity problems have been .slightly increased in the Pavilion
vith the announcement of new basketball rules. The court has been
i ngthened four feet, two behind each basket.
Four feet from the basket to the boundary line instead of two, as it
used to be, will give the offense more room in which to maneuver and
improve officiating by decreasing the number of hair-line decisions
concerning players out-of-bounds. It is sad to think what Ilank Lui
setti might have done with his already unprecedented scoring record
if this rule had been made three years ago.
Where the whole free-throw key was previously sacred in that a man
• mid stay in it for only three seconds, the rule has been changed to permit
i nv 11 to st-'V in the outer half of the circle indefinitely unless he is in
jossession of the ball.
Permitting players extra rest, without penalty, the rules have been
•hanged to allow five time-out periods instead of four. Other changes
ire only slight.

BASKETBALL ROSTER INCLUDES MIDGETS
BUT DEAN WILL CAPITALIZE ON SPEED

I'HIL ZONNE, after two years' experience with the Laughing Boys, had
Stanford worried about his physical condition following a case of pneu
nonia, but he is in top shape now and will contribute his all-around hoop
dent as captain and center for the Cards. Indicating his confidence in
/ .onne, Coach Dean has said, ( 'I regard Phil as an outstanding basketball
layer and an excellent leader for the team."
LEON LAFAILLE has a good eye for shooting baskets, and has been
Inking them right and left in practice. Lafaille will be a forward for
He Indian five.
When the heal is on. DFRKOL HUDDLESON is at his best. He is fast
md alert, and will speed up Card offense from the other forward spot.
DICK LYON saw considerable action with Stanford's hoop champs, and
ms been shifted to guard because of his height, aggressiveness, and un
anny backboard skill. And to complete an already promising picture,
-yon's previous experience at center will give him a convenient edge on
■flense.
Speed will be the long suit played by 808 BURNETT, diminutive
first-string guard. And his basket shooting will pile up considerable
Stanford points.
With the absence of a quintet of champions. Coach Dean will find
considerable use for reserves this year, and he has a long list of men
who stack lip line beside the first stringers.

DEE AND CALDERWOOD STILL WITH CARD TEAM
BUT NOT WHERE WE'RE USED TO SEEING THEM

Watching the week-end events in the Pavilion will be a pair of hoop
■dars whom we'll miss plenty. Beebs Lee will be on hand as freshman
joaeh. while Jack Calderwood will be an assistant to Coach Dean. They
won't see what we sow when they were on the floor last year, and right
low nobody can predict just what they will see.
University of San Francisco will bring a team of veterans to Stanford,
hree of whom played first string last year. It will be a contest of veterans
igainst well-coached greenhorns, and the outlook now is for a toss-up.
Fresno State will come north with a team that is an unknown quantity,

Fresno State will come north with a team that is an unknown quantity,
•ven on a basis of previous records.
The week-end's games will have little significance in a conference way.
>ut they'll give us a chance to see two varsity teams and (he freshmen
under first. Two games will not be enough to tell the tale about the Big
Red Quintet, but we'll get a scant impression, and by the time they have

enow its chances when the conference season opens against Southern Cali

IVEKETT DEAN WILL MAKE IHS DEBUT
IS lIOOP TEAMS BEGIN 55-GAME SERIES

Stanford hoop squads will hit their basketball season head-on this
reek-end with six games of their 55-game schedule. Varsity, B squad,
nd frosh form an equation in three unknowns, and until they appeal in
ompetition, it will t;»ko more than a mathematician to solve it.
Everett Dean, who left an enviable record at Indiana to come out
Vest and take tip where John Bunn left off when he became Dean of
/leu, will make his debut tonight as Stanford basketball coach. HiS team
ucceeds one of the finest ever produced, and the Laughing Boys leit only
ne representative when they graduated last June.
So the new coach has been obliged to work with green, inexperienced
non. They have all the spirit and determination a coach could want, but
vhether or not they have fundamental basketball talent Is yet to be seen.
Already small of stature, Indian hoopsters are the shadows of
their former selves after hard out-of-doors exercise early in the
quarter. But they are in fine physical shape, and they go like lightning
in Dean's fast-breaking olTense, shaped to capitalize on the inherent
speed of small players.
Altering the Stanford type of play only in so far as changes fit the
material, the new coach has varied team tactics only slightly. Biggest
hange will be on defense. Where Butin stressed zone defense, Dean
■mphasizes assigned man-to-man work under the Stanford basket. There
vill be less shifting, only when necessary.
Dean has stressed offensive blocking in practice sessions in order to
increase use of such strategy and keep it legitimate so that the whistle
vill not blow constantly for illegal blocks. The Cards have also learned
o break fast when they get the ball on rebound from an opponent's
coring attempt.

[illegible] LUISETTI WOULD HAVE MADE
GOOD USE OF THIS YEAR'S RULES

Seating capacity problems have been .slightly increased in the Pavilion
vith the announcement of new basketball rules. The court has been
i ngthened four feet, two behind each basket.
Four feet from the basket to the boundary line instead of two, as it
used to be, will give the offense more room in which to maneuver and
improve officiating by decreasing the number of hair-line decisions
concerning players out-of-bounds. It is sad to think what Ilank Lui
setti might have done with his already unprecedented scoring record
if this rule had been made three years ago.
Where the whole free-throw key was previously sacred in that a man
• mid stay in it for only three seconds, the rule has been changed to permit
i nv 11 to st-'V in the outer half of the circle indefinitely unless he is in
jossession of the ball.
Permitting players extra rest, without penalty, the rules have been
•hanged to allow five time-out periods instead of four. Other changes
ire only slight.

BASKETBALL ROSTER INCLUDES MIDGETS
BUT DEAN WILL CAPITALIZE ON SPEED

I'HIL ZONNE, after two years' experience with the Laughing Boys, had
Stanford worried about his physical condition following a case of pneu
nonia, but he is in top shape now and will contribute his all-around hoop
dent as captain and center for the Cards. Indicating his confidence in
/ .onne, Coach Dean has said, ( 'I regard Phil as an outstanding basketball
layer and an excellent leader for the team."
LEON LAFAILLE has a good eye for shooting baskets, and has been
Inking them right and left in practice. Lafaille will be a forward for
He Indian five.
When the heal is on. DFRKOL HUDDLESON is at his best. He is fast
md alert, and will speed up Card offense from the other forward spot.
DICK LYON saw considerable action with Stanford's hoop champs, and
ms been shifted to guard because of his height, aggressiveness, and un
anny backboard skill. And to complete an already promising picture,
-yon's previous experience at center will give him a convenient edge on
■flense.
Speed will be the long suit played by 808 BURNETT, diminutive
first-string guard. And his basket shooting will pile up considerable
Stanford points.
With the absence of a quintet of champions. Coach Dean will find
considerable use for reserves this year, and he has a long list of men
who stack lip line beside the first stringers.

DEE AND CALDERWOOD STILL WITH CARD TEAM
BUT NOT WHERE WE'RE USED TO SEEING THEM

Watching the week-end events in the Pavilion will be a pair of hoop
■dars whom we'll miss plenty. Beebs Lee will be on hand as freshman
joaeh. while Jack Calderwood will be an assistant to Coach Dean. They
won't see what we sow when they were on the floor last year, and right
low nobody can predict just what they will see.
University of San Francisco will bring a team of veterans to Stanford,
hree of whom played first string last year. It will be a contest of veterans
igainst well-coached greenhorns, and the outlook now is for a toss-up.
