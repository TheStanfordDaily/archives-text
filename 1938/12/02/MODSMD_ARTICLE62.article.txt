best collegiate boxer to be seen on

three years should bring the Cardi
nals many a laurel wreath.
Hugh Gallarneau will return to

on the skill he showed against the
Pacific Coast light-heavies last year.

University meet can be expected in

the title-holder in hLs class.

entrants in the tourney is the Tun
ney award, presented by the ex
world's heavyweight champion. This
