Alter almost two months of work
with his varsity tennis squad, Coach
Sherm Lock wood yesterday said that
he was still looking for plenty of
improvement from his varsity can
didates before the opening of the
season against the California Coun
try Club on February 11.
"The tentative doubles combina
tions that have been working out
need lots of practice before they can
hope to stand a chance against con
ference competition," the varsity
mentor said.
Lockwood has live returning let
termen on which to build his team,
including Captain Jim Seaver, Lloyd
Gates, Dave Brock, Myron Folsom,
and Sherwood Armstrong.
Brock and Seaver showed last
year that another year's experience
was all that was needed to put them
in the winning column. Seaver,
coupled with Bob Underwood, went
back east la.st June to take the New
Jersey state doubles title.
From last year's frosh who licked
Cal and all other opponents but the
"powerhouse Pasadena team. Lock
wood will have Bob Low, Neil Bal
lard, Stan Owen, Bob Worthington,
and several others. Both Low and
Ballard went through their season
without suffering a loss in singles
matches.
Among candidates for the year
ling aggregation, Loekwood's out
standing prospect is Larry Dee,
Western and Pacific Coast junior
champion. Hugh Lowe and Mike
Levee have also shown promise.
