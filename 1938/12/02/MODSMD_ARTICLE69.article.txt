### JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor 
Stanford's frosh hoop team tees oil into its 19-game schedule today at
4 o'clock when Coach Beebs Lee's yearlings open the Pavilion doors to
the San Jose High cagers in the lirst local basketball game of the season.
The Papooses, who precede the varsity by a few hours as the official
I bapti/ers of the cage sport, tangic with Modesto Junior College at

the same time and place tomorrow.
! Both games will be free.
j Lee takes over the frosh mentor
i ing job from Wytze Goiter, who led
last year's Encinans to 16 victories
I in 20 games, including a three-game
I clean sweep over Cal's Bearcubs.
j Lee is already pointing the Papooses
for their first Little Big Game Feb-
I ruary 10.
STARTING LINE-UP
Today's starting line-up will find
IJoe Messina and Dick Ray teaming
j at forward, Bob Penn at center, and
; Bill Cowdin and Hal Sams at guard.
| Chuck Smith, forward, and Bob
jScharback, guard, will both see
plenty of action.
This septet forms one natural di
vision, according to Lee, and they
have been working together for sev
eral practice sessions, while another
group of eight men have also been
working together. This second sec
tion is composed of Jack Deacon,
Lew Reese, Jack Petteys, and Hank
Claflin, forwards; Bob Billings,
center; and Bob Breckner, Morgan
Noble and Olile Hamlin, guards.
MODESTO FAVORED
All these men will probably break
into today's game, with tomorrow's
; line-up being determined on today's
| performances.
Lee figures the Papooses should
[trounce the prepsters even though
I the latter are leading contenders for
j this year's P.A.L. crown. How-
I ever, he expects that all his charges
jwill get out of tomorrow's tussle
| with the jaysees is experience. Mo
desto, one of the strongest junior
college outfits in the West, has been
installed a heavy favorite over the
Papooses.
