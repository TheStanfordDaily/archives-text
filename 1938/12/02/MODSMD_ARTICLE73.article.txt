# Soccer Squad To Meet U.S.F.
## Dons Here Tomorrow; Menlo Test Cancelled 
### 
With the Menlo J. C. tilt definitely
cancelled from the books, the varsity
soccer squad now points for the last
of the season worries, tomorrow's
boot and bounce match with the all -
too-strong University of San Fran
cisco team on the Stanford campus.
Although a victory tomorrow
would possibly open the way to that
promised land, the conference title,
nevertheless Card men will be out
to work off steam in a final flash
of feet to place some of their team
j members firmly on the mythical all
conference eleven which is to be
chosen by the powers that be after
the conference play closes tomorrow.
Authority has it that Indians Rudy
Munzer, Ken Cuthbertson, and Wil
son Clark have better than average
chances to cop coveted berths on
that eleven.
Cam Pierce and Ned Pugh, both
of whom showed flashes against Cal,
will probably fill the positions left
vacant by Fullbacks Bill Hamilton
and Dick Harmon, who are ill. Rudy
Munzer wil lopen at goal, with Wil
; son Clark, Bill Edwards, and Cap
tain Ken Cuthbertson at halfback
spots. Bryan, McKenzie, and Tif-
fany will probably see action at
these three posts.
The starting forward wall will
include Gurbstedt, Dole, Sadullah,
I Stamtun, and Deßeneditti, with Ar
rasmith, Pellas, Rogers, and Barcan
ready to step in as alternates.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 1 (UP).—A
proposal that all recognized football
conferences form a committee to de
termine the nation's strongest team
and that the selected eleven be pitted
against the Pacific Coast Conference
champion in the Rose Bowl was
passed today by the Southern Cali
fornia Association of the Oklahoma
University Alumni.
