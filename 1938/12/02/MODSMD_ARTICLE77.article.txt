# Class Unconsciousness

### 
FROM the usual chaos of class governments
at Stanford has come order —in one out of
four cases. Last year's junior class president,
Dave Ryus, applied his Poli Sci I principles to
his own position, evolved a junior Ex Committee
to centralize and co-ordinate all class activities.
The idea has evidently become a junior class
legacy. At least, no other class has evidenced
any intention of following the juniors' example.
And this for no apparent reason.
The trial class Ex Committee last year worked
out in exemplary fashion. More junior activities
than ever before filled the docket. More class
members than usual participated in their own
activities.
To be sure, the committee had the usual draw
backs which any large legislative body has:
leadership came from a few, half-hearted fol
lowing sometimes characterized the many. But
at least, greater class representation, more job
spreading, and more minds to bear on class
problems were noteworthy end products.
This year's junior class is following in the
footsteps of last year's. And over across the
Bay, a similar plan for class government is
being presented in attempt to put coherency
into the shapeless class masses at California.
Included in the Berkeleites' program is one
measure which well might be considered here
by the juniors—by all classes, in fact. Rather
than appointing new committees — publicity,
patrons, dance, and so on—each time a class
function is on tap, the Californians suggest the
establishment of permanent committees, to func
tion throughout the whole year, and apply
themselves to each new problem that comes
along in their fields.
The idea has much to commend it, particu
larly on the grounds of efficiency. The con
fusion which always results each time a new
committee is broken in is avoided; each com
mittee develops work tactics which make expe
rience pay dividends in the form of smooth
committee functioning.
But Stanford false-prides itself on its democ
racy too much to accept the efficient plan
whole - heartedly. Political promises, carried
through in the name of spreading jobs, block
too rigid committee superstructure. And the
price paid for democracy is likely to be ineffi
ciency.
But when that happens, Stanford's student
government is excused by calling it only a
"training ground." The theory is that none but
the student manager must worry about effi
ciency. And, in the name of Stanford's democ
racy, he often does.
This suggested addition to the junior Ex Com
mittee system, however, is a consideration
which for the moment may be laid on the table.
In the main, the problem is not what changes
can be made to the juniors' system, but, in
the face of its excellent features, why other
classes have failed to adopt it.
