# Medieval Major(ette)
## 
### 
PRESUMABLY occupied with the end of the
football season and the beginning of bas
ketball. Stanford was a little amazed this week
to find out that professors of the School of
Letters have not been too preoccupied to insti
tute a new educational method.
No matter how hard it may be to conceive that
such a move achieves any gleam of impor
tance in the face of other such significant
events, it's not hard possibly to see a new facet
to modern education showing its first out-crop
pings.
The plan is simple—probably so simple that
educators previously have been afraid to try
it, afraid to cut the welter of inter-departmental
restrictions.
Primarily, the system is designed to allow
students to major in subjects covered by various
departments and divisions.
What the introduction means is that it may be
copied in other fields even though it is now
limited to Medieval Studies.
When it is, students will not have to gripe
about often unnecessary and abstract major de
partment requirements to eventually get what
they want. They will have more freedom in

choice of courses, will benefit materially by vir
tue of more complete ones.
Other departments and schools, then, will
probably do well to progress backward, take a
lesson from the Middle Ages.—H. L. S.
