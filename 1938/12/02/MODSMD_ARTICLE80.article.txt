sents its regular Christmas number today, trusting
that the Herald Angels will come to work a little early
this year and lend the proper atmosphere.

/"|NCE upon a time there was a boy who lived a
normal, bourgeois childhood and grew toward tax
paying maturity in the accepted manner. He took the
usual infantile diseases in his stride, and he acquired
the customary repressions and inhibitions that we are
supposed to pick up during the formative years. The
libido and the id got along well, and so by the time
he was ready for college he was a model of good psy
choiogical adjustment, thoroughly house-broken to
modern society.
In the beginning the boy believed in Santa Claus
and the Eastern Bunny, even as all normal boys are
supposed to do. He lost faith in the bunny fable when
a misguided uncle gave him a pair of Belgian hares.
The rabbits multiplied, after the manner of rabbits;
and the boys observed that they produced little rab
bits, not hardboiled eggs.

His faith in Santa Claus was rooted in a stronger
rock, the profit motive. But it, too, collapsed soon
after the boy entered school. He fell in with evil
companions, and sat in the back row so that he could
throw spitballs. Also in the back row was a young
hoodlum who was the acknowledged hero of the class
because he spent more time in the principal's office
than in the classroom. The young hoodlum told the
boy that there was no Santa Claus; the boy did a bit
of detective work and caught his father forging Santa's
name on a sled.

rpHUS, when he came to college his mind like his
mouth was wide open. He had the perfectly normal
conviction that he understood everything in the uni
verse, including women and relativity; his only worry
was that he would be unable to avoid graduating in
three years.
When he registered the University took his check
for $115. Immediately after that he paid class dues,
and joined Encina Club, which gave him the privi
lege of buying a bid to a dance once a year, and of
reading last year's magazines in the social room.

In the meantime there had been a flood in Mom
bassa, and the Red Cross dropped around to collect
his relief contribution. Axe Society discovering that
the Buck Club was about to scrap three obsolete ath
letes, staged a scholarship drive to pay for putting them
out to pasture.
When the spring Convalescent Home drive was
over, the boy went home scratching his poison ivy and
doing mental jiu-jitsu with a growing doubt.

The next fall ho came back to school and entered
his fraternity. Immediately he was put to work clean
ing the attic. He had just finished the job when the
house manager presented him with a bill that would,
have caused a cabinet crisis in any European country.
Shortly after that the boy learned that he was
expected to contribute to a fund which the students
were raising to build a boathouse for the university.
And on the same day he got his syllabus fees with
an extra assessment for the library.
* * * *
The boy wont home and added up his stub account.
The growing doubt exploded into certainty. "You damn
bet you there s a Santa Claus, he growled. "I'm it."
Suddenly he thought of the Easter Bunny. His face
blanched, and he shuddered in apprehension.
