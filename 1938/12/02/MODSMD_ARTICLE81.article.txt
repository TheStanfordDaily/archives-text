LONESOME
In the Libc the other night, a friend of mine who
usually goes there to study was not studying. He
was, for a queer reason, undoubtedly, looking at the
floor, and he saw a little piece of paper neatly folded.
Hnimm, a note, he said to himself, and picked it up.
He has a scholarly, inquisitive mind.
The note, written in a neat, feminine hand, said,
"So many uninteresting looking men!"

For some reason I seem to be swamped with stories
about guys.with hair.
Under my standards, if I have two stories about
anything—l'm swamped.
And I have a second story about a guy with hair:
It started out very simply. Sunday morning he
decided that for one week he wouldn't comb his hair.
He wouldn't touch it. For three days everything was
all right. He didn't comb his hair. People said funny
things to him about it. He felt very comfortable.
But Wednesday night' he was out a little late, and
when he came home he looked in the mirror—and
was frightened, frankly.
Not so good.
Then he remembered that he had a date Saturday
night. His hair was so bad and so mixed up that he
began to wonder whether he would be able to comb
it for the date. He got out. a comb and brush and
tried to comb it. He tried for five minutes.
He couldn't comb it.
He went to bed just a little worried. He likes the
gal he has the date with Saturday night. He wanted
to be pretty for her.
The next morning he got up and tried again. After
several tough minutes he finally got it combed.
Today there is hardly a hair out of place.
It will be that way until Sunday morning.

WITH A SMILE
A guy has a gal who had a birthday yesterday.
Being a wise guy he knew that Western Union
will sing birthday telegrams over the telephone to
people who get them if you want them to sing them.
Being a wise guy he telegraphed the words to
"Happy Birthday to You, etc.," to his gal.
And he hopes the guy in the telegraph oHice has
n good voirf.
