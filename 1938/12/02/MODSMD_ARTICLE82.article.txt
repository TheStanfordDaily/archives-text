# Authenticity, Technicolor Sell "Drums"

"Drums," currently playing at the
Fox-Stanford and produced by i
lliitain's Alexander Korda:
The lady behind me who asked
in the middle of this picture if Mo- j
hammed's water pipe was a pacifier,
I can only direct to Dr. Swoosh, ;
credit optometrists, no money down j
and forty weeks to pay. It didn't

I w I,
take most of the |
audience a second |
look to spot the
fact that the at- 1
nosphere in this !
picture is as bona j
!ide as a fraternity
handshake.
"Drums" is pro- ;
duced in techni- j
color and takes up i
the British wor-

ries in India. Now, Chamberlain j
didn't get those drooping moustaches j
from worrying about the white man's 1
burden. And the infinitely civilized
intrigues in the Khyber Pass are not;
of current cosmic import.
But the authentic fragments in 1
the filming—rthe glint of sun on the |
muskets of the snipers in the Pass, I
the cocky red-headed drummer boy
in kilties, the crumbling mosques of :
the ancient mountain city, the polite 1
sparring between enemies — mark i
"Drums" as one of those precise and j
careful foreign pictures. And the :
thin discords which trickle along as j
accompaniment should once and for •
all put those straight who associate !
Eastern music with the Raymond j
Scott Quintet in satin bloomers.
Moreover, the plot events build
up to a final British coup with the
tight-knit accumulation of actual
historical event.
"Swing That Cheer," playing second '
fiddle; collitch stuff.
