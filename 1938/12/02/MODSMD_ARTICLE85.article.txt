## HELL WEEK CONFLICT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We students have seen some fancy
double-crosses this year, but we've
had to wait until two weeks before
finals for the real stabbing.
In an honest attempt to co-oper
ate with the administration in rais
ing the grade average of the Row,
the Interfraternity Council tried
out a new system this year. The
fraternities were told to arrange
their schedules so that they could
all have their initiations during the
same week. The professors were
going to let up and take it easy.
It was a very good plan, at least
that's what the fraternities thought,
and I still think it is. They agreed
to it, and the faculty gave them to
understand that there would be no
ex's given or term papers called
for during that week. The week is
here, and nine of our pledges have,
altogether, eleven full-hour ex's and
three term papers. If that's co-op
eration, I'm for going back to our
newly-acquired antagonism.
