The Editor, Sir:
I haven't sqweaked much about >
| syllabus fees except the one for $5 .
at Ihe Women's gym. I would never i
: have sqweaked about that except !
I that in a certain sport which re- i
i quires nets —and it isn't tennis—
the women are requested to put up !
the nets themselves. Now I would I
hardly mind this, but after all we i
only get 45 minutes for the sport, j
j and if you spend 10 minutes putting j
i up the nets, and 10 minutes drag- i
, ging them down just how much ex- |
t ercise will you get?
Sincerely yours,
BENCHED. I
