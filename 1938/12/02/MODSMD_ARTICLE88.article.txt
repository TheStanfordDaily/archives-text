The Editor, Sir:
A front-page column informs me j
that ;i course in athletic appreciation j
! is to be given this winter, "so that |
women will be more appreciative |
i spectators of the games they will j
see."
As an enthusiastic supporter of j
I such trends in progressive educa- j

tion, I am led to wonder why the
powers that be do not introduce
other courses dealing with extra
curricular subjects. Why, specif
ically, should there not be a course
entitled "Night-Clubs 101," so that
Stanford women may be more ap
preciative spectators in the dives
they will visit. Even more popular
would be some such course as "Os
culation 13," which would teach
residents of Roble and Lagunita to
appreciate the different necking
techniques they will encounter.
