The Editor, Sir:
I was very much pleased and in
terested to note that you are now
running a regular column of news
summary and comment. I think
that adds a great deal to the paper.
Many of us who do not subscribe
to the City papers depend on The
Daily for world news, and since or
dinarily you print only a few ofT
campus stories, we are glad to have
a column that summarizes the main
events of the day.
The column seems well handled
and edited, and I think that you are
to be congratulated for installing it.
J. L.
