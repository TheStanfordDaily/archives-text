tional defense.
Representative J. Parnell Thom
as, a member of the Dies Commit

immcdiatcl)' introduce a resolu

across the Atlantic comes an
increasing number of reports
that. General Franco is going to win
the Spanish civil war almost any
minute now. Cables from the Ibe
rian peninsula state that the Fascist
troops have captured Artesa do
Segre, strategic center of communi
cations for Catalonia.
The capture of the city, which
Franco has been attacking for the
past 12 days means that the Insurg
ents control the highway over which
supplies are delivered to the Repub
licans from France.
Franco appears to have the sit
uation well in hand, and it looks
like when Mussolini welcomes
Chamberlain in Rome a week
from today he can dangle a Fas
cist victory in Spain and an ac
cordingly weakened position for
the democratic nations before the
nose of the British peacc maker.

increasing number of reports
that. General Franco is going to win
the Spanish civil war almost any
minute now. Cables from the Ibe
rian peninsula state that the Fascist
troops have captured Artesa do

the democratic nations before the
