# Health Service Releases Results of Syphilis Tests
## 
### 
Blood tests of students in 515
American colleges and universities
indicate that two out of every 1.000
undergraduates are infected with
syphilis, results of a survey con
ducted by the United States Public
Health service show.
The tests were given at Stanford
previous to the Christmas holidays',
as a part of the survey.
Figures are approximately the
same tor college and non-college
groups of the same age, comparison
to other Public Health statistics in
dicates.
Other findings show a difference
of about 15 per cent less syphilis
among college women than among
men. This difference is approxi
mately the same as the difference
between sexes for the nation.
As to programs for examination of
students for syphilis prevention, the
statistics showed that 11 per Cent or
23 schools give examinations on a
routine basis; 40 per cent have per
manent facilities for testing.
Five major conclusions made by
the American Social Hygiene Asso-

ciation from the survey include the
following:
"1. The prevalence of syphilis in
American colleges is 1.99 per 1,000,
a figure comparing closely with that
I for the corresponding age-group in
| the general population.
"2, The slightly lower rate among
I college women is also in line with
I the national figures.
| "3. Testing by selective methods
; results in many cases among college
I students remaining undetected; thus,
routine testing of all students would
1 seem necessary to find all cases.
"4. There is considerable agree
' ment concerning the educational
I value of blood testing, it being recog
i nized that a check at this important
I age-group will result in an ultimate
! lower prevalence rate for the whole
| population.
| "5. Cost has proved to be a minor
! factor in most cases since free state,
I county, or city laboratory facilities
| are usually available, which, because
I of their large volume of testing, can
j perform laboratory tests at a low
I unit cost."
