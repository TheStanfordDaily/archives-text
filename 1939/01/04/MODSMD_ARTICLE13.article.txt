WASHINGTON. Jan. :! (UP). The

mittee placed the politico-relief is
sue before Ihe new Congress today
in a report which condemned the
alleged use of Works Progress Ad
ministration funds for political pur
poses and recommended tightening
Of federal statutes to reduce election
corruption.

and one Republican informed the
Senate it investigated hundreds of
election complaints in 18 states and
found many of them groundless, but
il encountered abuses which warrant
a 16-point legislative program to
divorce politics from relief and pro
vide more drastic, regulation of elec
tions.
