### ALLEN DRURY 
Towering 210 feet above the tra
ditional low, rambling architecture
of the Quad, a $600,000 building to
house the "Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace" has been
authorized by the Board of Trustees,
according to an announcement made
December 8 by President Ray Ly
man Wilbur.
Made possible by gifts from pri
vate individuals and several foun
dations. the structure will house the
world's largest collection of war
time documents, gathered since 1911
from the secret files of the Allied
and Central Powers and at. present
stored in the Hoover War Library
wing of the main Stanford Library.
To be erected of reinforced concrete
and structural steel, the building
will be situated beside the Art Gal
lery. facing Memorial Hall.
Space for five principal collections
has been provided for in the archi
tect's drawings. The library proper
will occupy the main floor, which
will be 120 feet square, according fo
present plans, and other divisions
will be devoted to the Ray Lyman
Wilbur Collection on social prob
lems, Mr. Hoover's personal ar
chives, the Russian Revolution In
stitute, and the German Revolution
Institute.
TOWER TO MOUSE PAPERS
The main tower will be 55 feet
wide, and will consist of four stories
and nine half-stories. It will house
pamphlets, magazines, and govern
ment records. Storage space will be
provided in the basement for secret
books and documents upon whose
publication ;i, time-restriction has
been placed by the donors.
Plans for the structure were orig
inally drawn up in 1926, according to
Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz, present
chairman of the War Library's
board of directors. In November,
1930, they were altered, only to be
revised and given final form in
19.36, when the receipt of an anony
mous gift of $150,000 brought the
total endowment to $600,000.
Begun by Mr. Hoover in 1911, the
collection has grown to 5,000,000
documents through the constant co
operation of governments through
out the world. Forty countries have
contributed to the 31 archives which
at present, include 175,000 books and
pamphlets, 1.100 manuscripts, 26,000
posters and photographs, 1,600 maps,
and more than 300,000 feet of film.
GREATEST COLLECTION
Concerning the Versailles Treaty
and the peace conferences which
followed the War, the Library pos
sesses what is considered to be the
most extensive collection in exist
ence. Chief item in this is the libra
ry of Great Britain's Ministry of In
formation, shipped to Mr. Hoovcr
after the Armistice.
It is presumed that the structure,
which will give the Farm a cam
panile of its own to more than match
that across the bay, will form the
central building in the northern
section of a new Quad.
