# Prison Opens Gate to Debaters
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON AL ZELVER 
Above the choppy, slate-grey waters of San Francisco's north bay
loonns the massive stone bulk of San Quentin prison. Like a medieval
French chateau its corniced walls dominate the tidelands, stand in sharp
outline against tlu* rolling, green Sausalito hills.
Each year the heavy, menacing gates swing on friendly hinges to admit
three Stanford debaters and Varsity Coach Leland Chapin.
Last month so traveled Sherman MellinkofT. Stan Anderson, and Sidney
Terry, representing this year's squad. Proposing an Anglo-American peace
pact to outlaw war, the Farm trio,^

before an audience of 500 trus- !
ties, was pitted against three of San j
Quentin's best arguers.
STANFORDITES ENTER
Out in the grim, sunny reception j
room, while prisoners talked across I
guarded tables with sad-eyed rela- |
lives, Dr. H. A. Shuder, prison direc- I
tor of education, greeted the Stan
fordites, invited them in.
Stepping through a heavily barred i
gate, the men found themselves in
a carefully landscaped courtyard,
crossed by low fences and neatly |
swept paths. Loosely formed lines
of men passed quickly in single file. I
In the glass-enclosed office of Di- !
rector Shuder, the Farm men shook I
hands with the courteous, mild
mannered San Quentin convicts who
were to meet them on the platform.
Lines of curious prisoners barely
paused to "ogle" Footbal 1 -player I
Anderson, as San Quentin newspaper j
editor later expressed it.
AUDIENCE ATTENTIVE
Upstairs in the low-ceilinged room J
one debater after another stood be
fore the public address microphone, !
defined the question, pleaded its,
merits or condemned its vices.
Now and then, a good-humored j
stir moved the attentive audience as
Ihey heard a convincing argument !
or, perhaps, a joke about prison- life, j
Earnestly, with thorough prepara- j
tion and brilliantly turned points, j
the San Quentin team met Stanford's i
case, though the debate was non- ;
decision.
Swarming the platform to query ;
an issue or offer congratulations, the j
friendly audience praised Debater
Mellinkoff's closing rebuttal. One j
wry prisoner cracked, "Say, kid, 1
studying law?" "No," replied Mel- j
linkoff. "Well, if you ever hang out j
your shingle," the convict added, j
"let me know and I'll be around." |

Above the choppy, slate-grey waters of San Francisco's north bay
loonns the massive stone bulk of San Quentin prison. Like a medieval
French chateau its corniced walls dominate the tidelands, stand in sharp
outline against tlu* rolling, green Sausalito hills.
Each year the heavy, menacing gates swing on friendly hinges to admit
three Stanford debaters and Varsity Coach Leland Chapin.
Last month so traveled Sherman MellinkofT. Stan Anderson, and Sidney
Terry, representing this year's squad. Proposing an Anglo-American peace
pact to outlaw war, the Farm trio,^

before an audience of 500 trus- !
ties, was pitted against three of San j
Quentin's best arguers.
STANFORDITES ENTER
Out in the grim, sunny reception j
room, while prisoners talked across I
guarded tables with sad-eyed rela- |
lives, Dr. H. A. Shuder, prison direc- I
tor of education, greeted the Stan
fordites, invited them in.
Stepping through a heavily barred i
gate, the men found themselves in
a carefully landscaped courtyard,
crossed by low fences and neatly |
swept paths. Loosely formed lines
of men passed quickly in single file. I
In the glass-enclosed office of Di- !
rector Shuder, the Farm men shook I
hands with the courteous, mild
mannered San Quentin convicts who
were to meet them on the platform.
Lines of curious prisoners barely
paused to "ogle" Footbal 1 -player I
Anderson, as San Quentin newspaper j
editor later expressed it.
AUDIENCE ATTENTIVE
Upstairs in the low-ceilinged room J
one debater after another stood be
fore the public address microphone, !
defined the question, pleaded its,
merits or condemned its vices.
Now and then, a good-humored j
stir moved the attentive audience as
Ihey heard a convincing argument !
or, perhaps, a joke about prison- life, j
Earnestly, with thorough prepara- j
tion and brilliantly turned points, j
the San Quentin team met Stanford's i
case, though the debate was non- ;
decision.
Swarming the platform to query ;
an issue or offer congratulations, the j
friendly audience praised Debater
Mellinkoff's closing rebuttal. One j
wry prisoner cracked, "Say, kid, 1
studying law?" "No," replied Mel- j
linkoff. "Well, if you ever hang out j
your shingle," the convict added, j
"let me know and I'll be around." |
