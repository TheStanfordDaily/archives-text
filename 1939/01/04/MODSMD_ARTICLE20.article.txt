# Naturalist Tells Of Marine Life
## Floyd Schmoe Speaks At Tuesday Lecture 
### 
"The waters of the world, if they
1 could be properly exploited, are
I capable of producing enough food to
! support the entire population of the
j earth," asserted Floyd W. Schmoe,
University of Washington natui'alist,
who inaugurated the Tuesday Eve
ning Series for the winter quarter
j last night when he spoke in Memo-
I rial Hall auditorium.
Presenting an illustrated lecture
j entitled "I Live under the Sea," the
i speaker showed colored motion pic
j tures of the marine life to be found
; beneath the surface of Puget Sound
| and in the waters of the Pacific. For
eight years national park naturalist
j at Mount Rainier, Mr. Schmoe was
formerly executive secretary of the
; Puget Sound Academy of Science
| and director of its marine museum.
Because of its significance as a po
tential source of food, the ocean,
j "though one of the least explored
areas of the world, is "important eco-
J nomically as well as scientifically,"
; according to the lecturer.
To obtain first-hand information
concerning the marine life in north
j ern waters, Mr. Schmoe constructed
1 a huge concrete cylinder, which was
t partially submerged and anchored
| to a reef, and through whose glass
j port holes he could photograph fish
I in their natural habitat.
