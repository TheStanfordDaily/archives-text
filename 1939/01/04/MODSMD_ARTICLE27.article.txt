hands, and face from flying glass

took occasion to warn students
against careless driving, especially
during the rainy season to come. He
stressed the need of co-operation to
eliminate accidents.
DAVIS GIVES WARNING
"When the roads are slippery, ex
ceeding the speed limit even slightly
or failing to observe the arterial
signs may well result in serious in
jury and perhaps even death to the
offending driver and also to his vic
tim, Davis warned. He pointed out
the danger of speeding even 30 miles
per hour in a 20-mile zone, and
expressed a hope that students
would make a unified effort to con
