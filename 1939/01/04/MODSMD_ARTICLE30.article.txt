let anyone tell you Stan
ford hasn't a basketball team.
Observers of the Cards' two open
ing victories admitted that the team
looked good, but they realized that
Stanford could have been lucky.
Observers were from Missouri, and
ihe Cardinal hoopsters spent Christ
mas vacation showing them. There
is no doubt now but that Everett
Dean and his squad of green midgets
have rigged up a ball club that is far
1 letter than Stanford hoped for when
Luisetti and his crew graduated.
Conference competition is still
a week and a half away, and
Stanford's success so far is no sign
that the Indians will reach the top.
Willi such crack combinations as
the Cal and U.S.C. quintets in the
league, nobody can expect the In
dians even to approach it. Hut a
50-40 victory over Oregon, the
best the North can offer, will
reap a much needed confidence
among the young and inexperi
enced Cards.
Dartmouth was the only team to
] ut the Stanford Indians' shoulders
to the ground, but the Easterners
had a hard time doing it. The Cards
outplayed the five tall and skillful
hoopsters from Hanover but lost 48-
41 in an overtime period.
Fortunately, Idaho was not good
eaough to overtake the Cards, whose
game was not up to par and indi
c ited an after-finals slump. The In
dians won, 33-28.

AS practice sessions progressed
over vacation Coach Dean shuf
fled the deck and appeared with a
li2w hand for nearly every game.
And it is still hard to tell who will
ntake up the first five and where
they'll play.
Phil Zonne has been shifted to
forward opposite Leon Lafaille.

Ro o m is thus
made at center for
(Don Burness, who
must recover from
a torn knee liga
ment before he
can play again.
Dick Lyon has
diverse talents and
is taking time off
from guard to

share center du
ties with Dick Taylor. Will Ander
son and Bill Rapp, guards, will also
be tried in the pivot spot.
Bob Burnett and Ken Davidson
starred in the Oregon game and
will continue in guard spots. Rapp
and Gil Rahn will alternate with
them.
Harlan Copsey has improved fast,
and remains an able forward re
placement, while Huddleson, Wells,
and Williams strengthen the list.
Speed takes the place of height on
the Stanford varsity, and Dean has
taught the Cards to handle the ball
with remarkable accuracy. They
may not bring home the conference
bacon, but they'll play a fast and
spirited game that will make the
1939 basketball season one of the
most entertaining in Stanford his
tory.

- SEASON intersectional
football games proved only a
slight supremacy for western foot
ball, but when conference seasons
had closed and outstanding teams at
both ends of the country were sifted
out to celebrate New Year's in more
Bowls than there are cherries to fill
them, it was evident that the tale
would soon be told. And it was.
Reports came pouring in from
Rose, Sugar, Sun, Pineapple, Or
ange, and Cotton Bowls, and west
ern teams were on the long end of

all but one of the
scores that in
cluded them.
Southern Cali
ornia, Texas
Christian, St.
Mary's, and Utah
had overcome op
oonents whose

homes were in the direction of the
rising sun. U.C.L.A. Bruins left the
Pacific Coast in the opposite direc
tion and trounced University of
Hawaii.
Meanwhile, the tell-tale game of
them all was being played in San
Francisco. Stars of the East and
stars of the West had gathered at
Kezar Stadium to prove which end
of the country could get together
the best material. The West tri
umphed again.
And again the West has proved
its gridiron supremacy.
# * *
And speaking of the East-West
classic, it was like old times seeing
Bill Paulman and Tony Calvelli in
the spotlight, even among the na
tion's best gridders.
Faust was a fine punter, but
when he saw Paulman's quick kicks
soaring out 55 yards, far over the
safety man's head, he could expect
the smaller booting average.
Bottari made more spectacular
runs, but his average gain was
well under Paulman's. In fact, the
quiet blond averaged more than
twice the combined gains of Gold
berg and MacLeod.
Calvelli was his same determined
self. He fought his heart out on
every play and with the same suc
cess that makes us wonder if Stan
ford's banana-fingered center was
not a forgotten man in the ail-
American selections.
