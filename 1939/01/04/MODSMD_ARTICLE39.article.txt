# Frosh Cagers Practice Alter Christmas Layoff
## 
###

from scratch after a three-week
lay-off, Coach H. B. Lee's yearling
basketballers figured in their first
practice yesterday, sharpening their
shooting eyes for the Palo Atlo High

freshmen put in a rigorous two

ing positions of several of the first
stringers, while working a brand
new recruit in both center and
guard spots.

difficulties and form a framework
for a tall frosh varsity.
Bill Cowden stepped up from a
guard post to the center position,
while Bob Penn, lanky 6-loot 6-inch

tilts will be with prepsters, junior
college outlits, and the frosh clubs
of Santa Clara and St. Mary's.
All but starting the hoop season |
from scratch after a three-week
lay-off, Coach H. B. Lee's yearling
basketballers figured in their first
practice yesterday, sharpening their
shooting eyes for the Palo Atlo High
School tilt tomorrow night.
Instead of the usual holiday cage I
trips which have held the team to
gether for practice sessions in the
past, the Papooses were given free
rein from their first two tilts early
last month until yesterday.
Given a free slate to work on, the
freshmen put in a rigorous two
hour session, with Coach Lee shift
ing positions of several of the first
stringers, while working a brand
new recruit in both center and
guard spots.
SQUAD SHIFTED
Against the Paly High quintet. Lee j
will field a much-shifted around and I
also a nearly new first string. Vein \
Hoffman from Lodi High School 1
threatens to break into the starting |
line-up, if his first-day drill is any
criterion for the future book. Hoff
man is a rangy G-foot-3-incher,
who is expected to solve the guard
difficulties and form a framework
for a tall frosh varsity.
Bill Cowden stepped up from a
guard post to the center position,
while Bob Penn, lanky 6-loot 6-inch
skyscraper, has been shifted to for
ward from the pivot post. In spite
of the lay-off both players found
the hoop for a good share of long
and close-in shots against second
and third stringers.
HAL SIMS LEAVES
Transferring to Cal because of
financial difficulties, Hal Sims at
guard wil lbe difficult to replace.
However, Ollie Hamlin is being
groomed to fill the bill to work with
Hoffman. Chuck Smith was shifted
from forward to guard in the shake
up, while both Lew Reese and Dick
Ray are expected to see consider
able action tomorrow from their
customary forward posts.

stration for the women's athletic de
partment in the Pavilion.
