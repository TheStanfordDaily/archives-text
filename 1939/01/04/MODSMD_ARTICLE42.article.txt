# Hoopmen Take Late Lead, Beat Nebraska, 56-47
## Travelers Threaten Indian Five Burnett Takes High Point Honors With 15, kovanda Follows 
### 
Coach Everett Dean's Stanford
hoopsters picked up enough second- ;
half steam last night in the Pavilion !
to trounce the University of Nebras- J
ka's barnstorming outfit, SG-47.
The Indians started slowly in the j
first half, and even then lost speed [
rapidly to a Cornhusker team that I
has an invading victory record that |
is far from impressive. Little Bob I
Burnett's aggressive and alert of- j
fensive play helped stake the locals i
to an early 13-6 lead, which the !
speedy midwesterners then pre- j
ceded to whittle down until Grant I
Thomas's field goal just before the j
half ended gave Nebraska a 25-24 i
midway lead.
DEFENSE POOR
During the first period the In- j
dians showed little to recommend j
them as contenders in the coming |
Coast Conference hoop chase. Their !
defense was slow and frequently they j
got all tangled up as the tireless
Huskers fairly burned down the
floor every time they got the ball.
On offense the Cards refused to
break and contented themselves
with difficult shots from out on the
sides instead of cutting through the
middle. However, despite their mis
cues and the fact that they were
trailing, the Indians obviously were ;
the better team. Aside from William j
Kovanda, a clever forward who
scored 13 points, and Harry Pit- j
caithley, a chubby guard, Nebraska i
had nothing but speed.
ROUT STARTS
The second half was a rout, with
the Cards finally snapping out of
their slumber. Their passes click
ed, the defense straightened out —
and Nebraska faded. With a safe
55-40 lead and just a few minutes
left in the game, Dean started to
let in the subs, allowing the losers
to make a respectable final score.
Once again the sparkling Bur- |
nett was the fire-cracker in the Stan- '
ford team. He scored 15 points for
high honors and practically held the ;
team together during the dismal ]
first half.
However, it was a sophomore and i
two senior substitutes who starred |
during the last period. Kenny Dav- ,
idson, one of the aces of last year's •
frosh outfit, started at forward, but j
once he was shifted to his usual 1
guard post he did some clever pass- 1
ing and tricky defense work. Dav
idson seemed to be the only Indian I
who could consistently crack j
through the middle of the Nebraska |
defense.
SENIOR STARS
The seniors were Bill Rapp and j
Harlan Copsey, both of whom were \
on the squad last year but saw little !
action. But last night they were !
two of Stanford's principal spark- '
plugs. Rapp has a persuasive way !
of controlling the ball—even if he
has to spread his frame all over the
floor, while Copsey is an excellent
shot around the bucket.
In preparation for their opening
conference tilts against Southern
California on January 13 and 14 the
Cards mix with St. Mary's come
Friday night and Santa Clara Sat
urday evening.

Coach Everett Dean's Stanford
hoopsters picked up enough second- ;
half steam last night in the Pavilion !
to trounce the University of Nebras- J
ka's barnstorming outfit, SG-47.
The Indians started slowly in the j
first half, and even then lost speed [
rapidly to a Cornhusker team that I
has an invading victory record that |
is far from impressive. Little Bob I
Burnett's aggressive and alert of- j
fensive play helped stake the locals i
to an early 13-6 lead, which the !
speedy midwesterners then pre- j
ceded to whittle down until Grant I
Thomas's field goal just before the j
half ended gave Nebraska a 25-24 i
midway lead.
DEFENSE POOR
During the first period the In- j
dians showed little to recommend j
them as contenders in the coming |
Coast Conference hoop chase. Their !
defense was slow and frequently they j
got all tangled up as the tireless
Huskers fairly burned down the
floor every time they got the ball.
On offense the Cards refused to
break and contented themselves
with difficult shots from out on the
sides instead of cutting through the
middle. However, despite their mis
cues and the fact that they were
trailing, the Indians obviously were ;
the better team. Aside from William j
Kovanda, a clever forward who
scored 13 points, and Harry Pit- j
caithley, a chubby guard, Nebraska i
had nothing but speed.
ROUT STARTS
The second half was a rout, with
the Cards finally snapping out of
their slumber. Their passes click
ed, the defense straightened out —
and Nebraska faded. With a safe
55-40 lead and just a few minutes
left in the game, Dean started to
let in the subs, allowing the losers
to make a respectable final score.
Once again the sparkling Bur- |
nett was the fire-cracker in the Stan- '
ford team. He scored 15 points for
high honors and practically held the ;
team together during the dismal ]
first half.
However, it was a sophomore and i
two senior substitutes who starred |
during the last period. Kenny Dav- ,
idson, one of the aces of last year's •
frosh outfit, started at forward, but j
once he was shifted to his usual 1
guard post he did some clever pass- 1
ing and tricky defense work. Dav
idson seemed to be the only Indian I

break and contented themselves
with difficult shots from out on the
sides instead of cutting through the
middle. However, despite their mis
cues and the fact that they were
trailing, the Indians obviously were ;
the better team. Aside from William j
Kovanda, a clever forward who
scored 13 points, and Harry Pit- j
caithley, a chubby guard, Nebraska i
had nothing but speed.
ROUT STARTS
The second half was a rout, with
the Cards finally snapping out of
their slumber. Their passes click
ed, the defense straightened out —
and Nebraska faded. With a safe
55-40 lead and just a few minutes
left in the game, Dean started to
let in the subs, allowing the losers
to make a respectable final score.
Once again the sparkling Bur- |
nett was the fire-cracker in the Stan- '
ford team. He scored 15 points for
high honors and practically held the ;
team together during the dismal ]
first half.
However, it was a sophomore and i
two senior substitutes who starred |
during the last period. Kenny Dav- ,
idson, one of the aces of last year's •
frosh outfit, started at forward, but j
once he was shifted to his usual 1
guard post he did some clever pass- 1
ing and tricky defense work. Dav
idson seemed to be the only Indian I
who could consistently crack j
through the middle of the Nebraska |
defense.
SENIOR STARS
The seniors were Bill Rapp and j
Harlan Copsey, both of whom were \
on the squad last year but saw little !
action. But last night they were !
two of Stanford's principal spark- '
plugs. Rapp has a persuasive way !
of controlling the ball—even if he
has to spread his frame all over the
floor, while Copsey is an excellent
shot around the bucket.
In preparation for their opening
conference tilts against Southern
California on January 13 and 14 the
Cards mix with St. Mary's come
Friday night and Santa Clara Sat
urday evening.
