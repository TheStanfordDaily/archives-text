# Budge to Face First Pro Test
## Champ to Oppose Vines in N.Y.-Debut 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 3 (UP). —The
great Don Budge will reveal to the
sports world tonight whether he is
man or superman as he faces one
of the sternest tests ever to confront
any tennis player.
On a brilliantly illuminated green
canvas court in Madison Square
Garden, this slender, red-headed lad
from Oakland will make his pro
fessional debut against Ellsworth
Vines, rated by some experts as the
most formidable racket wielder of
all time.
Budge, king of the world's amateur
courts and America's No. 1 athlete
in 1938, will be hailed as a super
man indeed if he can triumph over
the lanky blond from Pasadena in
the initial match of their long tour.
To win tonight Don must rise
above his own handicaps in addition
to turning back Vines machine-gun
attack. That's why Budge will take
the court as a 6 or 7-5 underdog for
the first time since he rose to star
dom.
In his first money match Budge
will be playing under terrific pres
sure. He will be performing for the
first time on a canvas court. He
will be performing for the first time
before a whooping gallery of cash
customers—nearly 18,000 fans who
observe none of the polite amenities
of amateur crowds. The crowd will
pay about $48,000 for the privilege
of cheering or booing.
