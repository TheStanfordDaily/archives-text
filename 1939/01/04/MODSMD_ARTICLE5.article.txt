# Iturbi Flies Here To Play Tonight
## 
### 
Jose Iturbi, who got an airplane for Christinas, will fly here today for
his appearance on the Stanford Concert Series tonight. The renowned
Spanish pianist-conductor gave a concert in Eos Angeles last night.
Tonights program will range from eighteenth century classicism to
twentieth century ultra-modernism, because Iturbi, while revering the

â–º classics, is in sympathy with the
| mind and tempo of today. He be-
I lieves that many contemporary
j compositions arc not only the pres
ent of music, but also its future.
CLASSIC PROGRAM
I The program opens with Handel's
i Air with Variations, "The Harmo
l nious Blacksmith." Then, skipping
to a later date in the classical era,
| Iturbi will play "Sonata in F Major"
| by Mozart, a sonata in three move
i ments for solo piano.
I Following the intermisson the art-
I ist will play two piano sketches by
j Chopin: first the graceful "Fantasie
i Impromptu," and after that "Scher
! zo, B-Flat Minor," "more madness
j than merriment, more tragedy than
| comedy." Dcbussey's "Poissons
j d'or" and "Feux d'artifice," vivid
; piano sketches typical of the twen
tieth century impressionist.
Iturbi concludes his program with
Do Falla's spirited "Ritual Fire
Dance," a master work of Spain's
| great modern composer.
