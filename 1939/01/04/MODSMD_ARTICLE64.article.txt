# Mars' Ivory Tower

### 
LAST year was a year of Farm construction.
While trucks plowed up and down, shovels
down and up, and rivets played a strumming
obligato to lecturers, the Education Building
was completed, a fountain was built, a Boat
house was started, a monument to Shell gaso
line blossomed (adv.), roads were leveled, roads
were raised, and a new parking lot smoothed
the rear of the Cubberley Building.
And while the old year was dragging out,
announcement of a new building, a super-struc
ture, was made. Its picture spreads over the
front page of The Daily today; its fame will
spread throughout educational centers of the
world; its crest will nod blithely to the Campa
nile across the Bay.
Unquestionably, the Hoover War I,ihrary
will mean much to Stanford in publicity, in
prestige, in convenience. The famed collec
tion of war literature which it will house is a
possession unique to Stanford, of value to the
entire system of world education.
But shocked hands have risen and will con
tinue to rise at the thought of a 210-foot tower
on Stanford's campus. In an apparently pur
poseless departure from traditional Quad archi
tecture. Stanford's unity of design will be
broken by this peristylic giant. In lieu of any
other visible purpose for the break, one can
only conclude that, like the collection which
it will house, the tower is meant to represent
an ideal in its beacon-like stretch to the sky.
So be it. Then, within it should be materials
which are not merely used as mementos of
war, to be pored over by musty erudites, but
as potential weapons to rid the the world of its
chronic epilepsy of flame and steel. From its
windows, men should not look down placidly
upon the scarring earth; from the materials
within their grasp should come plans, ideas,
schemes born of the mistakes of the past which
will make the tower more than a storehouse for
books.
For surely the donations which made the
building possible, the expense and labor spent
to gather the collection, have a greater purpose
than prestige for Stanford, convenience for
librarians, or a flashy tower.
There must be an ideal behind it all.
If there is not, if idealism is not the founda
tion of the Hoover War Library, then the long
shadow which will some day stretch across the
campus will be the shadow of an ivory tower.
