# '39 Gun Salute
## 
### 
UNTIL some brilliant editor has a better idea,
January newspapers will spout forth like
Library fountains with New Year's messages
of light and cheer or of death and destruction.
Numbers of deaths, births, wars, and unem
ployed will clog editorial columns while predic
tions of hell and high water herald the begin
ning of this new year. Noting these things,
The Daily slides into the groove.
All the while, Stanford paces blithely down
the freshly oiled corridors in search of a cur
ricular program with no eight o'clocks, and
plods wearily to the whine of Reg Dance saxo
phones. And so Stanford begins the new year
as it did the old. Outside, the world peers out
apprehensively from behind the eight ball
where it was deposited during 1938.
Commentators, in the vanguard, are already
bringing back notices of a corner ahead around
which might possibly lurk better times. On
the other hand, for all the world knows, 1939
may bring more war, more purges, more busi
ness regressions. So the world is a little in
clined to prefer the temporary peace of the
eight ball. But because tradition has always
urged that that spot is a craven's corner, it will
dance out again to tread the measured paces
of dictators' polkas, demagogues' jigs, and so
ciety's groggy fox-trots.
Stanford, however, is a thing apart from all
this. It need not worry about the music of
dictators, demagogues, or society. It is free to
wander down the stately halls of free thought,
free living, and free tickets to the basketball
•

games (except California and U.S.C.).
And so while fear dominates a great part of
the world, while ill health another, overwork
a third, and poverty a fourth, Stanford will
peacefully watch the Hoover War Library climb
skyward, will shell out for name bands, will
curse the rain and grumble at units.
And all with the zest and spirit which greets
the Reg Dance tonight—bump, thump, and
slide-one-two-three.
Bump, thump, slide-one-two-three — Happy
New Year.

of light and cheer or of death and destruction.
Numbers of deaths, births, wars, and unem
ployed will clog editorial columns while predic
tions of hell and high water herald the begin
ning of this new year. Noting these things,
The Daily slides into the groove.
All the while, Stanford paces blithely down
the freshly oiled corridors in search of a cur
ricular program with no eight o'clocks, and
plods wearily to the whine of Reg Dance saxo
phones. And so Stanford begins the new year
as it did the old. Outside, the world peers out
apprehensively from behind the eight ball
where it was deposited during 1938.
Commentators, in the vanguard, are already
bringing back notices of a corner ahead around
which might possibly lurk better times. On
the other hand, for all the world knows, 1939
may bring more war, more purges, more busi
ness regressions. So the world is a little in
clined to prefer the temporary peace of the
eight ball. But because tradition has always
urged that that spot is a craven's corner, it will
dance out again to tread the measured paces
of dictators' polkas, demagogues' jigs, and so
ciety's groggy fox-trots.
Stanford, however, is a thing apart from all
this. It need not worry about the music of
dictators, demagogues, or society. It is free to
wander down the stately halls of free thought,
free living, and free tickets to the basketball
•

games (except California and U.S.C.).
And so while fear dominates a great part of
the world, while ill health another, overwork
a third, and poverty a fourth, Stanford will
peacefully watch the Hoover War Library climb
skyward, will shell out for name bands, will
curse the rain and grumble at units.
And all with the zest and spirit which greets
the Reg Dance tonight—bump, thump, and
slide-one-two-three.
Bump, thump, slide-one-two-three — Happy
New Year.
