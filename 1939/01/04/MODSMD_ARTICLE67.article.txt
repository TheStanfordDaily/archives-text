# BULL SESSION

### JOHN COBBS 
GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE
/ MIRISTMAS 1938 has transferred quietly front pres
ent to past tense, and theoretically Stanford should
snap back smoothly into the pursuit of knowledge, like
a well-trained greyhound catching sight of the electric
rdbbit. Bull Session should resume its spot at the
public address system to dispense heart-swelling praise
and withering censure with the debonair impartiality
of a .sports announcer.
But the Christmas holidays left behind them some
thing besides spots of tinsel ground into the rug and
rings on the piano where guests set their glasses. A
rarefied but identiliable remnant of the Christmas
atmosphere has survived the confusion of arranging
programs and writing checks, and so the students re
gard the academic electric rabbit with an apathetically
raised eyebrow. And Bull Session dreams idly, refus
ing to look in the direction of the debonair dispensa
tion of justice.
* »!* # *
Officially the pcace-on-earth-good-will-toward-men
spirit has been put away in tissue paper, like the
Christmas tree ornaments. The herald angels have fin
ished their number, and the angels bending near the
earth have gotten back above the legal minimum flying
altitude.
But a vague mist of holiday spirit still hangs in the
air. Under such atmospheric conditions the academic
scavnger hunt seems a game we have outgrown, as
feel relaxed, peaceful, and gently philosophic ,as
though we had just attended an impressive church
service and stayed awake for the sermon. Somehow
we know that an understanding of the sex mores of
(he Polynesians will make us no happier. And we feel
that an investigation of the outer rings of atoms will
add nothing to our present contentment.
* # * *
REALIZE that our attitude is rooted in pure
laziness. And we know that if our ancestors had
not held exactly the opposite opinion, mankind would
still have a cave bear for a landlord. But for the mo
ment we are reluctant to pack up the quiet satisfac
tion of the holidays.
While this anesthetic attitude lasts, there is very
little that a comment column can say. Bull Session,
of course, is not dedicated to the cause of dyspepsia,
sarcasm, and corrosive comment. It can slap backs and
shake hands like a small town mayor But any remark
that doesn't carry a Pollyanna credit line implies criti
cism. Even when he wrenches his shoulder throwing
bouquets at some glorious project, a commentator au
tomatically insults its opponents.
* * * >!<
At the moment we are in no mood for criticism. All
we want to do is sit quietly and meditate on the shin
ing glory of the holiday. We liked the world the way
it was during Christmas week, and we are in no hurry
to get back to the troubles of the marginal entrepre
neur and the problems of the unattached sodium ion.
We want to wait a moment and think of the star of
Bethlehem as a Cod-sent beacon, not as Exhibit A in
an astronomy lecture on novae.
Comment would break the enchantment, because
comment would drag us back into the confusion of
eight, o'clock classes, grade points, maladjusted com
mittees, bank balances, and social regulations
And so today Bull Session sits and dreams. Damn
the University calendar.

Officially the pcace-on-earth-good-will-toward-men
spirit has been put away in tissue paper, like the
Christmas tree ornaments. The herald angels have fin
ished their number, and the angels bending near the
earth have gotten back above the legal minimum flying
altitude.
But a vague mist of holiday spirit still hangs in the
air. Under such atmospheric conditions the academic
scavnger hunt seems a game we have outgrown, as
feel relaxed, peaceful, and gently philosophic ,as
though we had just attended an impressive church
service and stayed awake for the sermon. Somehow
we know that an understanding of the sex mores of
(he Polynesians will make us no happier. And we feel
that an investigation of the outer rings of atoms will
add nothing to our present contentment.
* # * *
REALIZE that our attitude is rooted in pure
laziness. And we know that if our ancestors had
not held exactly the opposite opinion, mankind would
still have a cave bear for a landlord. But for the mo
ment we are reluctant to pack up the quiet satisfac
tion of the holidays.
While this anesthetic attitude lasts, there is very
little that a comment column can say. Bull Session,
of course, is not dedicated to the cause of dyspepsia,
sarcasm, and corrosive comment. It can slap backs and
shake hands like a small town mayor But any remark
that doesn't carry a Pollyanna credit line implies criti
cism. Even when he wrenches his shoulder throwing
bouquets at some glorious project, a commentator au
tomatically insults its opponents.
* * * >!<
At the moment we are in no mood for criticism. All
we want to do is sit quietly and meditate on the shin
ing glory of the holiday. We liked the world the way
it was during Christmas week, and we are in no hurry
to get back to the troubles of the marginal entrepre
neur and the problems of the unattached sodium ion.
We want to wait a moment and think of the star of
Bethlehem as a Cod-sent beacon, not as Exhibit A in
an astronomy lecture on novae.
Comment would break the enchantment, because
comment would drag us back into the confusion of
eight, o'clock classes, grade points, maladjusted com
mittees, bank balances, and social regulations
And so today Bull Session sits and dreams. Damn
the University calendar.
GOD BLESS US EVERY ONE
/ MIRISTMAS 1938 has transferred quietly front pres
ent to past tense, and theoretically Stanford should
snap back smoothly into the pursuit of knowledge, like
a well-trained greyhound catching sight of the electric
rdbbit. Bull Session should resume its spot at the
public address system to dispense heart-swelling praise
and withering censure with the debonair impartiality
of a .sports announcer.
But the Christmas holidays left behind them some
thing besides spots of tinsel ground into the rug and
rings on the piano where guests set their glasses. A
rarefied but identiliable remnant of the Christmas
atmosphere has survived the confusion of arranging
programs and writing checks, and so the students re
gard the academic electric rabbit with an apathetically
raised eyebrow. And Bull Session dreams idly, refus
ing to look in the direction of the debonair dispensa
tion of justice.
