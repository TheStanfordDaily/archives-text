LOVELY TO LOOK AT
FRIEND of mine who goes to one of the Southern
California Junior Colleges had to take a certain
general course in English, and he heard that one of
the professors giving it was quite good. This prof is a
young guy and, in his own way, rather clever.
The prof had already turned down four guys that
day because his class was full, but my friend took a
chance. He walked into the room. The room seemed
to be full of young and beautiful members of the sex.
The cream of the crop was sitting in the front row.
Southern California girls, as you may or may not
know, wear their dresses quite short. The cream of
the crop, of course, has nice legs. As I say, they were
all sitting in the front row.
My friend went up to the prof's desk. The prof
was leaning with his chin resting on his hand staring
straight ahead.
"I want to register in this course," my friend said.
The prof didn't notice him. He repeated it. Nothing
happened. For a third time he said that he wanted to
register in the course. The prof was stiil staring.
My friend up temporarily and stared for a
spell himself. Then he turned to the prof and said,
"God, how do you stand it."
So the prof let him in the course. And promised to
Hunk him.

Yes, my dumbest friend, at a crucial point on his
journey home for the vacation, found he had forgot to
briny his railroad tickets with him.

One of our California girls, I hear, goes back East
to school, and before she went back she solemnly swore
that she would ski every day.
The first day out she broke her leg.
That isn't funny at all, of course. It's simply an
object lesson which should be told just before every
New Year's.
I hope none of you break your legs or anything on
New Year's resolutions.

A guy down south was talking to a Stanford egg.
The Stanford guy was telling him how handy it was
to have a ear here at school.
And the Southern Cal guy, realizing that Stanford
was called the Farm, asked very seriously, "Oh, you
mean you need a car there to get from class to class?"

WELL. l AKMEIJS. YES
A guy down south was talking to a Stanford egg.
The Stanford guy was telling him how handy it was
to have a ear here at school.
And the Southern Cal guy, realizing that Stanford
was called the Farm, asked very seriously, "Oh, you
mean you need a car there to get from class to class?"
LOVELY TO LOOK AT
FRIEND of mine who goes to one of the Southern
California Junior Colleges had to take a certain
general course in English, and he heard that one of
the professors giving it was quite good. This prof is a
young guy and, in his own way, rather clever.
The prof had already turned down four guys that
day because his class was full, but my friend took a
chance. He walked into the room. The room seemed
to be full of young and beautiful members of the sex.
The cream of the crop was sitting in the front row.
Southern California girls, as you may or may not
know, wear their dresses quite short. The cream of
the crop, of course, has nice legs. As I say, they were
all sitting in the front row.
My friend went up to the prof's desk. The prof
was leaning with his chin resting on his hand staring
straight ahead.
"I want to register in this course," my friend said.
The prof didn't notice him. He repeated it. Nothing
happened. For a third time he said that he wanted to
register in the course. The prof was stiil staring.
My friend up temporarily and stared for a
spell himself. Then he turned to the prof and said,
"God, how do you stand it."
So the prof let him in the course. And promised to
Hunk him.

Yes, my dumbest friend, at a crucial point on his
journey home for the vacation, found he had forgot to
briny his railroad tickets with him.
OBJECT LESSON
# * * *
One of our California girls, I hear, goes back East
to school, and before she went back she solemnly swore
that she would ski every day.
The first day out she broke her leg.
That isn't funny at all, of course. It's simply an
object lesson which should be told just before every
New Year's.
I hope none of you break your legs or anything on
New Year's resolutions.
