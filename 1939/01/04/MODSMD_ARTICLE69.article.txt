### 
"PYGMALION"' slated for San
Francisco showing soon:
For a long time now, aisle-seat
wiseacres have been smirking about
George Bernard Shaw's doddering
pen and testy conceit. This film ver
sion of his play goes to show that
the only moss-hung thing about

George Bernard
is his chin. And
long after thea
tergoers wouldn't
give an S & H
stamp to sec
Coward in tights,
(lis nibs will still
be master of civ
ilised travesty.
In "Pygmalion,"
Shaw revamps the

old Greek legend of the sculptor who
fell in love with his own handiwork.
Eliza Doolittle peddled violets in
Covent Square and Eliza had a bad
limey drawl and the class of a
mudhen. Eliza might have ended
her days as a leathery old hag if a
phonetics professor hadn't picked
her out of the gutter. The phonetics
professor makes a lady out of Eliza
and palms her off as a duchess.
Leslie Howard as the phonetics
expert who is so well bred that he
can afford to be snotty, is a searing
comment on the upper crust and
one that Howard fully understands.
Wendy Hiller, the Eliza Doolittle of
"Pygmalion," is a young actress of
a charm at once unorthodox, ir
regular, and many-sided. She de
velops in her characterization the
spirit of a guttersnipe into the pride
of a lady.—Slater.

The Suez canal was opened in
18G8.
