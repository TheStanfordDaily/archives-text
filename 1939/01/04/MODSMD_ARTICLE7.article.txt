# Boathouse Approaches Completion
## Present Schedule Calls for Opening In Three Weeks 
### 
While Ken Cuthbcrtson and his
committee yesterday afternoon wor
ried about attendance at last night's
Registration Boathouse dance, five
carpenters, under Superintendent
John Leavers, pushed nearer com
pletion Stanford's Christmas present,
the A.S.S.U.'s $10,000 boathouse.
"It should be ready in three
weeks," Leavers said. "There's no
particular reason to hurry because
the rains won't fill Lake Lagunita
for a long time," he added.
During the time that Stanfordites
were vacationing, Leavers' crew
added finishing touches to the nine
doorways that will provide access to
the canoe storage rooms, began
building the ramps that connect lake
and building.
WORK GOING SLOWLY
The white "priming" coat of paint,
applied last week to the unpainted
timber, accents the low, triangular
structure against the green back
ground of hills. Inside partitioning
of the pentagonal center portion has
not been completed, though skeleton
walls have been set. Work on the
attendant's office, student rooms and
dressing rooms is proceeding slowly.
Yet. uncompleted is the sun-deck
and glass - enclosed lounge which
will form the second floor of the
building.
The small crew of workmen, com
posed of four carpenters and an ap
prentice, will insure substantial Sav
ings in construction cost, according
to Leavers.
SUPERINTENDENT TALKS
Leavers has superintended all ma
jor Farm building projects in recent
years. "Yes, I've helped build Toyon
and Branner, Ihe Board of Athletic
Control office, Pavilion, and Lagu
nita." He mused a moment, and
then continued. "Yes, a lot more."
When he had finished naming the
rest, the list included the Education
Building, Memorial Hall, the Wom
en's Gym, Press Building, and the
Carnegie Laboratory. "In summer
time I help on the Row, too," he
added. "This summer it was the new
Sigma Chi house. We had to hurry
to get it done, but we made it.
"This boathouse jobâ€”it's a small
matter. But we'll finish it long be
fore spring quarter. You can't use
it until then, anyway. And we'll save
the student body money, too."
