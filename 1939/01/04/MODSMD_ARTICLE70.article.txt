# CAMPUS OPINION
## THAT'S NO LIE

The Editor, Sir:
The following item appeared in
the "thirty years ago" department of
"the Bakersfield Califomian" on De
cember 1. Thought it might interest
you to see "how times have chang
ed"' on the Farm.
"Seven cardinal sins" have been
adopted for Stanford co-eds, one
of them l>eing that women students
must not appear on the quads in
"froufrou" skirts, pcckahoo waists,
or light hosiery. Another is that
men and women students must not
stroll together in the evening in
single couples.
