EYES were on Washington,
D.C., yesterday as President
Roosevelt delivered his annual
message to Congress, but faces
turned East sharply, suddenly, to
see a new super-Fascist premier ap
pointed in Japan.
Roosevelt has blasted the dictator
ships again and again, but yester
day, in his message delivered in
person to a joint session of the
Senate and the House, he made his
first concrete proposals for action
against the totalitarian states.
Condemning the Fascist nations,
especially Germany, as enemies of
democracy, the President sug
gested economic sanctions against
lanyi-hungry aggressors. He
pointedly suggested a change in
present neutrality laws on the
ground that they often operate
more favorably upon aggressor
nations than upon the victims of
their land-grabbing projects.

J ROOSEVELT turned his interna
tional pronunciamento to the
New Deal's advantage by appealing
to controlling forces of the United
States to cease internal bickering
and stand together as a united front
against the menacing policies and
programs of the dictatorships.
The President's speech, which
was broadcast in six languages, was
enthusiastically welcomed by the
English and French govenunents
and was passed off with sneers in
Germany and Italy. Japan and
Spain, the actively aggressive na
tions of the world, upon whom the
projected economic sanctions would
fall, were silent on the subject of
the democratic attack.

As Roosevelt lashed totalitarian
governments here, in Tokio a
grade A, number 1 Fascist was
commanded by the Emperor to
form a cabinet and to take over
the post of Premier, a position
which, under the present govern
ment set-up, amounts almost to
dictatorship.
Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, presi
dent of the Privy Council, was
placed at the head of the cabinet
to replace the comparatively liber
al Prince Fuminaro Konoye. Cer
tain it is that new ultra-nationalist
government will not only intensify
the military struggle for Japanese
â€¢domination of China, but will as
sume complete control of the in
dustry and finance of the Empire.
Under the new regime the already
weakened Diet will be completely
masculated, and parliamentary gov
rnment in Japan will play eunuch to
Hinranuma's sutlan in the seraglio.
Probable purpose of the appoint
ment of a super-Fascist Premier, is
an efTort to successfully conclude
Japan's campaign to control the Far
East.

| N SPAIN the successes of Gen
eralissimo Franco continue, and
the final victory of his Insurgent
army seems practically assured.
With the capture of Borjas Blancas j
yesterday the entire line of the
southern Republican defense fell in i
the hands of the Fascists and the
second major objective of the rebel
forces was achieved.
Since the strategic town of Ar
tesa de Segre, center of communi
cations with the north, was cap
tured Tuesday and Franco's air
force is busy destroying the morale i
of the Loyalists by pelting refugee
trains with bombs, it appears that
before many weeks have passed
Spain may be added to the list of
nations labeled Fascist.

| PREMIER DALADIER continued
his tour of the French colonics
in Northern Africa yesterday, in
specting fortresses and reviewing
troops that stand ready to repel any
invasion, Italian or otherwise.
Meanwhile II Duces obedient press
hurled verbal brickbats at. France
because enraged natives had pub
licly burned an Italian flag in Tunis.
* it v
'I'he German foreign ollicc
warned the United States .yester
day that if Roosevelt's address to
Congress were too strong it might I
result in a breach of diplomatic j
relations, but there was no offi
cial response to the speech from !
the Reich.
