# Women's Editor Attends First Lady's Press Confab
## 
### PHYLLIS WHITE 
Characteristic of Mrs. Franklin D.
Roosevelt's informality and uncon
vcntionality arc her weekly press
conferences, one of which I attended
while spending Christmas vacation
in Washington. In retaliation for
the fact that women are not admit
ted to membership in the Washing
ton Press Club, the First Lady al
lows only women correspondents to
be present.
The first President's wife to hold
regular press conferences, Mrs. Roo
sevelt is herself a better newspaper
woman than most of those who in
terview her. Whereas most Wash
ington conferences consist entirely
of questions by the correspondents,
Mrs. Roosevelt comes prepared with
a list of items which she thinks will
be of interest to the press and says
frequently, "Don't you think it would
make a better story like this?"
TO WEAR RED CHIFFON
Typical of the First Lady's desire
to please the press was her remark
when she was asked what she would
wear at the coming-out dance being
given that evening, December 27,
for her niece, Eleanor Roosevelt.
"Well, I really don't know," she
said, "but I'll decide now—l'll wear
red chiflon."
When asked what she would wear,
the President's mother, Mrs. Sara
Delano Roosevelt, who was also
present, said humorously, "What I
always wear—black satin. There is
a sameness about my formal clothes.
Sometimes the train is longer, and
sometimes it is shorter, but it's al
ways black satin."
YOUTH MOVEMENTS
In her New Year's message, which
she gave out at the conference, Mrs.
Roosevelt particularly stressed the
importance of youth movements, in
which she is very much interested.
She made a plea to older people not
to condemn youth organizations
without first finding out what were
their purposes and objectives.
Condemning women voters for
their apathy, Mrs. Roosevelt said
there are "plenty of capable wom
en" to run for office, but that they
are not supported by the women of
the electorate. She expressed great

Women's Editor

interest in the outcome of the work
on women's rights at the Lima Con
ference.
FAMILY AFFAIRS
Questioned further on her stand
for the right of the members of the
President's family to lead their own
lives, the First Lady said she felt
that, so long as they did not go out
of their way to seek special favors
because of their position, they could
pursue their private careers as they
pleased. Mrs. Roosevelt's action in
taking over her son James' insur
ance business while he is absent in
Hollywood has occasioned a great
deal of criticism.
Mrs. Roosevelt holds her confer
ences upstairs in the East wing of
the White House in a small room
filled with the President's nautical
prints, which was formerly used as
the cabinet room. When she enters,
the First Lady goes around the
room, shaking hands with everyone
present, and calling the women she
knows best by their first names. She
left, only after everyone's questions
had been answered and she had
wished all the women a "happy New
Year."

TO WEAR RED CHIFFON
Typical of the First Lady's desire
to please the press was her remark
when she was asked what she would
wear at the coming-out dance being
given that evening, December 27,
for her niece, Eleanor Roosevelt.
"Well, I really don't know," she
said, "but I'll decide now—l'll wear
red chiflon."
When asked what she would wear,
the President's mother, Mrs. Sara
Delano Roosevelt, who was also
present, said humorously, "What I
always wear—black satin. There is
a sameness about my formal clothes.
Sometimes the train is longer, and
sometimes it is shorter, but it's al
ways black satin."
YOUTH MOVEMENTS
In her New Year's message, which
she gave out at the conference, Mrs.
Roosevelt particularly stressed the
importance of youth movements, in
which she is very much interested.
She made a plea to older people not
to condemn youth organizations
without first finding out what were
their purposes and objectives.
Condemning women voters for
their apathy, Mrs. Roosevelt said
there are "plenty of capable wom
en" to run for office, but that they
are not supported by the women of
the electorate. She expressed great

Women's Editor

interest in the outcome of the work
on women's rights at the Lima Con
ference.
FAMILY AFFAIRS
Questioned further on her stand
for the right of the members of the
President's family to lead their own
lives, the First Lady said she felt
that, so long as they did not go out
of their way to seek special favors
because of their position, they could
pursue their private careers as they
pleased. Mrs. Roosevelt's action in
taking over her son James' insur
ance business while he is absent in
Hollywood has occasioned a great
deal of criticism.
Mrs. Roosevelt holds her confer
ences upstairs in the East wing of
the White House in a small room
filled with the President's nautical
prints, which was formerly used as
the cabinet room. When she enters,
the First Lady goes around the
room, shaking hands with everyone
present, and calling the women she
knows best by their first names. She
left, only after everyone's questions
had been answered and she had
wished all the women a "happy New
Year."
Characteristic of Mrs. Franklin D.
Roosevelt's informality and uncon
vcntionality arc her weekly press
conferences, one of which I attended
while spending Christmas vacation
in Washington. In retaliation for
the fact that women are not admit
ted to membership in the Washing
ton Press Club, the First Lady al
lows only women correspondents to
be present.
The first President's wife to hold
regular press conferences, Mrs. Roo
sevelt is herself a better newspaper
woman than most of those who in
terview her. Whereas most Wash
ington conferences consist entirely
of questions by the correspondents,
Mrs. Roosevelt comes prepared with
a list of items which she thinks will
be of interest to the press and says
frequently, "Don't you think it would
