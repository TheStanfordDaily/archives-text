# 'Chains Stay Up,' Says University
## 
### 
Because Stanford is "one of
the few major universities in
l!»e country which has a trav
eled road between its class
rooms «nd its library," Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur and
the Academic Council have de
cided to keep Lasucn between
the Engineering and English
corncrs permanently closed, ac
cording to an announcement
yesterday by Acting Comp
troller J. Hugh Jackson.
The decision ends a two
month trial period originally
undertaken because il was
thought that use of the Educa
tion Building would increase
the danger of accidents to stu
dents going to and from the
T»ibe during evening study
hours.
According to I Van Jackson,
widening of the road past En
ema has been undertaken as
an answer lo the problem of in
creased traffic necessitated by
"the Libe delour," approxi
matcly f>o per cent of which
goes pa.st the freshman hall.
