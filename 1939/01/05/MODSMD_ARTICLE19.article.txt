# Iturbi Gives Outstanding Performance
## Famed Pianist Plays Program of Brilliant, Not Deep Selections 
### HARVA SPRAGER 
A great artist played at Stanford
last night.
Displaying the almost flawless
technique, feeling, and precision
that have made him one of the out
standing pianLsts of the day, Jose
Iturbi was master of the piano and
audience during the two-hour pro
gram in the Memorial Hall.
Perhaps the main criticism to be
made is that Mr. Iturbi's program
favored the more brilliant composi
tions and did not give the audience
enough of the more deliberate se
lections which he has played in the
past and for which he has won ac
claim by his sincere interpretation
of them.
NO EFFORT
Mr. Iturbi opened his program
with Handel's The Harmonious
Blacksmith which was played with
seemingly no effort. The intricate
scale passages served well to display
his mastery of piano technique.
The delicacy and charm of the
18th century was captured by Iturbi
as he played Mozart's Sonata in F
Major. It was by far the best of his
selections.
Schumann's Etudes Symphoniqucs
offered great possibilities for a show
of brilliance and color in its exe
cution and Mr. Iturbi took full ad
vantage of those possibilities.
ENCORES WITH WALTZ
The Spanish pianist was called
back for an encore before the inter
mission and played the popular
Waltz in A Flat by Chopin. In this
and his other Chopin numbers, Fan
taisie- Impromptu and Scherzo, B
Flat Minor, with which he opened
the second half of the program, Mr.
Iturbi made the piano sing, but hi.s
presentation was not unusual.
Debussy's Poissons d'Or and Fcux
d'Arlificc also gave Iturbi a chance
to display his remarkable technique.
Iturbi was at home in the Ritual
Fire Dancc by De Falla, one of hi.s
countrymen. The catching rhythms
of the Spanish music were clearly
defined.
PLAYED WITH EASE
Scvilla by Albeniz and Spanish
Dance in IS Minor by Granados, his
first two encores, were also played
with ease and familiarity. He was
tailed back for a third encore and
played Liszt's Eleventh Rhapsody.
Stanford liked Iturbi and felt he
was worth braving the elements to
hear.

was worth braving the elements to
hear.
He was.
A great artist played at Stanford
last night.
Displaying the almost flawless
technique, feeling, and precision
that have made him one of the out
standing pianLsts of the day, Jose
Iturbi was master of the piano and
audience during the two-hour pro
gram in the Memorial Hall.
Perhaps the main criticism to be
made is that Mr. Iturbi's program
favored the more brilliant composi
tions and did not give the audience
enough of the more deliberate se
lections which he has played in the
past and for which he has won ac
claim by his sincere interpretation
of them.
NO EFFORT
Mr. Iturbi opened his program
with Handel's The Harmonious
Blacksmith which was played with
seemingly no effort. The intricate
scale passages served well to display
his mastery of piano technique.
The delicacy and charm of the
18th century was captured by Iturbi
as he played Mozart's Sonata in F
Major. It was by far the best of his
selections.
Schumann's Etudes Symphoniqucs
offered great possibilities for a show
of brilliance and color in its exe
cution and Mr. Iturbi took full ad
vantage of those possibilities.
ENCORES WITH WALTZ
The Spanish pianist was called
back for an encore before the inter
mission and played the popular
Waltz in A Flat by Chopin. In this
and his other Chopin numbers, Fan
taisie- Impromptu and Scherzo, B
Flat Minor, with which he opened
the second half of the program, Mr.
Iturbi made the piano sing, but hi.s
presentation was not unusual.
Debussy's Poissons d'Or and Fcux
d'Arlificc also gave Iturbi a chance
to display his remarkable technique.
Iturbi was at home in the Ritual
Fire Dancc by De Falla, one of hi.s
countrymen. The catching rhythms
of the Spanish music were clearly
defined.
PLAYED WITH EASE
Scvilla by Albeniz and Spanish
Dance in IS Minor by Granados, his
first two encores, were also played
with ease and familiarity. He was
tailed back for a third encore and
played Liszt's Eleventh Rhapsody.
Stanford liked Iturbi and felt he
was worth braving the elements to
hear.
