## 
### 
"Nothing is wrong," remark
ed Ihe slight sexton in Memo
rial Church, when he was
questioned about the stained
glass window on the west side
which is now replaced by a
dirty old piece of taut canvas.
"We take out so many win
dows every year just to relead
them," the little man in a con
servative blue serge suit went
on to say, while he polished off
a brass door nob in one of the
Chapel's entrances.
"That window," he contin
ued, pointing up, "hasn't been
out since 1913. Last time they
didn't put heavy enough lead
around the glass so it sagged
more than usual. Now they put
heavier lead in, but the win
dows sag in time anyway.
Why, some of these windows
have three thicknesses of
glass."
When asked why, he simply
looked up from his polishing
and exclaimed, 'Oh. to get the
color."
