# Dr. Meritt Studies English Language
## 
### 
That there is no need to be at a
loss for words in oral or written
usage is ably proven by Dr. Herbert
D. Meritt, assistant professor of Eng
lish at Stanford, who has just com
pleted a comprehensive study of the
English language.
Dr. Meritt cites two reasons why
the English vocabulary is able to
cope with situations that leave one
speechless. First, there are about a
half million English words from
which to choose, and second, the
vocabulary is so constructed as to
enable one to borrow or even manu
facture words.
After studying the sources and
growth of the English language, Dr.
Meritt finds the vocabulary has
grown from an estimated 30,000 to
more than 50,000 words in the past
15 centuries. This increase may be
attributed to its remarkable capacity
for assimilating words from other
languages and its ability to form new
expressions from its own stock of
words.
EXPRESSIONS "REBUILT"
"With a meager stock of 30,000
words, the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes
came to Britain in the year 449 and
started the English language on its
way," explains Dr. Meritt. "Since
then Britain and the other English
speaking countries have continually
borrowed new expressions and re
built the old ones.
"Though borrowing was important

in the growth of the English vocabu
lary, the Anglo - Saxon language,
even from the very begining, has
been capable of wide variations in
expression. This arises from nu
merous derivational processes in
herent in English."
Dr. Meritt states that modern Eng
lish is especially resourceful in the
use of a phrase in a meaning differ
ent from that of each word by itself.
Thus, "calling up the stairs" is dif
ferent from "calling up one's friend."
NEW WORDS BORROWED
"The English vocabulary has little
trouble finding a word for whatever
may need expressing," Or. Meritt
summarizes. "On the one hand we
adopt words from all over the world
such as 'sofa' from Arabia, 'boomer
ang' from Australia, 'gorilla' from
Africa, 'bantam' from Java, and
'igloo' from the Eskimo. But we can
easily use material at hand to pro
duce such words as 'kickoff,' 'lip
stick.' 'funnies,' 'scurry,' and 'valen
tine.' "
In his research Dr. Merritt has
traced the borrowing of words by
the English language from approxi
mately eight other languages.

The most expensive saddles, made
of handworked leather and chased
with silver, sell for $200 to $250. A
California man recently paid the
record top price of $2000 for a
saddle.

Dr. Meritt states that modern Eng
lish is especially resourceful in the
use of a phrase in a meaning differ
ent from that of each word by itself.
Thus, "calling up the stairs" is dif
ferent from "calling up one's friend."
NEW WORDS BORROWED
"The English vocabulary has little
trouble finding a word for whatever
may need expressing," Or. Meritt
summarizes. "On the one hand we
adopt words from all over the world
such as 'sofa' from Arabia, 'boomer
ang' from Australia, 'gorilla' from
Africa, 'bantam' from Java, and
'igloo' from the Eskimo. But we can
easily use material at hand to pro
duce such words as 'kickoff,' 'lip
stick.' 'funnies,' 'scurry,' and 'valen
tine.' "
In his research Dr. Merritt has
traced the borrowing of words by
the English language from approxi
mately eight other languages.

The most expensive saddles, made
of handworked leather and chased
with silver, sell for $200 to $250. A
California man recently paid the
record top price of $2000 for a
saddle.
That there is no need to be at a
loss for words in oral or written
usage is ably proven by Dr. Herbert
D. Meritt, assistant professor of Eng
lish at Stanford, who has just com
pleted a comprehensive study of the
English language.
Dr. Meritt cites two reasons why
the English vocabulary is able to
cope with situations that leave one
speechless. First, there are about a
half million English words from
which to choose, and second, the
vocabulary is so constructed as to
enable one to borrow or even manu
facture words.
After studying the sources and
growth of the English language, Dr.
Meritt finds the vocabulary has
grown from an estimated 30,000 to
more than 50,000 words in the past
15 centuries. This increase may be
attributed to its remarkable capacity
for assimilating words from other
languages and its ability to form new
expressions from its own stock of
words.
EXPRESSIONS "REBUILT"
"With a meager stock of 30,000
words, the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes
came to Britain in the year 449 and
started the English language on its
way," explains Dr. Meritt. "Since
then Britain and the other English
speaking countries have continually
borrowed new expressions and re
built the old ones.
"Though borrowing was important

in the growth of the English vocabu
lary, the Anglo - Saxon language,
even from the very begining, has
been capable of wide variations in
expression. This arises from nu
merous derivational processes in
herent in English."
