baseball fans will see
' more baseball this year than
ever before. A glance at the first
honest-to-goodness practice session
yesterday indicated that there are
more good players on the Stanford
diamond now than there have been
since the conference champs of 1931.
Stanford can be sure of a mighty
fine group this year, but reports are
equally good from other practice
diamonds, including those of all the

other conference
competitors: Cal,
U. S. C., U.C.L.A.,
Santa Clara, and
St. Mary's. So
when Stanford
and Santa Clara
meet on February
IH, they'll be
i: : . iu. i*

lighting the luse
for a close conference series in
which anybody can win the crown.
And the Card nine has as much
chance as any.
Pitching will be Stanford's long
suit this season. AL LAZZARONE,
co-captain for 1938, and BILL
BALLHAUS will contribute experi*
â€¢enoe on the varsity mound, while
two promising candidates come up
from the frosh; COOTEY THOMP
SON pitched for the yearlings last
year, while CLAUDE PURKITT
will be changed over after a season
as a freshman catcher.
Indian catchers' mits will be dis
tributed this year among an excep
tionally fine array of hopefuls. BILL
JAMESON and SID WILLIS both
did well on last year's varsity nine,
while San Bernardino Junior Col
lege sends a transfer named 808
TEMPLETON, who looks good be
hind the plate.
NORM JUNEY, co-captain with
Lazzarone, leads a likely group of
outfielders. WAL-

LY DeWITT and
COOKIE SOUTH
have made their
reputations in the
past, and THOR
PETERSON
should move right
in from last year's
frosh. BILL AD
AMS. a transfer
from Marin Jun-

ior College, looks as though he will
hold his own with any of them.
Coach Harry Wolter will have
somewhat of a problem on his hands
when it comes to choosing men for
the infield positions. DICK SHORT
ALL will continue to cinch the short
stop post, but since there is a dearth
of promising candidates from last

year's frosh, the buses will be wide
open until practices are well under
way.
Exceptional pitching and well
rounded material in other positions
will give Coach Wolter something
to work on in his attempt to build
another championship team. It will
be a tough league of six crown con
tenders, but a fine defense and a
much improved offense, aided by
unusual speed all over the diamond,
may make a difference and bring
home the bacon to Stanford.

Y"OU'D expect to see Board of
Athletic Control officials run
ning around with smocks and paint
brushes the way they have been
dabbing color on Stanford athletics
lately.
The ball started rolling when they
tried to get silver satin football
pants for the Big Game. The idea
was not conceived soon enough, or
an already colorful contest would
have lingered in the memory like
brightly striped underwear.
But look at the basketball court.
The Pavilion is far from its
morgue-like self now that all of
the floor except the playing area
has been painted a solid red. And
the court itself has taken on new
life with cherry red markings and
a block S on a white background
in the center.
Even the divers at the Encina
Pools are getting their share. They
will dude their handsome physiques
in red satin trunks, decorated with
a white Stanford diagram on the
side.
The artists are not losing their
heads, and they are keeping their
efforts within bounds. They are
playing the psychology angle besides
adding life in an appropriate style,
and their work is to be appreciated.
