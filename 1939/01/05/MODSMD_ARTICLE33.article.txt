## JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor Strong Varsity Swim Team Points for Title Coach Thornton Says Cardinal Squad May Cop Coast Crown 
### 
Promising one of the best varsity
swimming squads ever to be as
sembled under the cardinal colors
of Stanford, Coach Nort Thornton
yesterday prophesied that the In
dians would have more than an even
chance of keeping the Pacific Coast
Southern Division swim title safely
in Stanford hands after two con
secutive years of Cardinal pool
supremacy in the West Coast divi
sion.
The Laughing Boys in Stanford
basketball and the football-playing
Vowing Sophs find a parallel in this
year's swim varsity, for major team
hopes fall upon this year's seniors,
the men who helped carry the
squad to the championship during
the past two years.
Only one junior is on the Card
varsity. The remainder of the team
is made up of the sophomores who
swept coast swimming as freshmen
last year.
TROY MAY UPSET
Led by Captain Winfield Need
ham, member of the Intercollegiate
Ail-American squad, and holder of
the conference 220 free-style title,
the squad looks forward to a sched
ule studded with possible upsets,
with the powerful U.S.C. swimmers
heading the list of challengers for
the title.
Title possibilities are brightened
by a squad fairly well rounded in
all positions. Roy Winkelmann,
holder of the conference diving title
for two consecutive years, and
member of the Inter-Collegiate All-
American squad during the same
period, is backed by Sophomore
Bill Nicolls, place-winner in last
year's little big meet.
Three sophomores present record
breaking possibilities in the 300-
yard medley relay. These three
swimmers hold the present national
freshman record for that event at
3:9.9. Bill Weeden, backstroke
member of the trio, is the holder of
the Cal-Stanford frosh inverted
swim title, clipping five seconds
from the Card varsity mark and
two-tenths of a second from the
Pacific Coast Conference figure on
the way in last year's meet.
MEDLEY TEAM
Roy Vitousek, lanky holder of the
freshman intercollegiate 50-yard
free-style title, will turn to breast
stroke for the medley swim. Chuck
Wiper, final medley man, will han
dle the free style, an event in which
he ranks as a man to watch.
Swimming the sprints will be
the veterans Dick Clarke and John
ny Brahtz, backed by Roy Vitousek
and Water-poloist John Lamb.
Lamb captained the water polo
team, but showed promise as a
sprint star by winning the events
in last year's intramural competi
tion. This year will be his first in
swim competition.
Team Captain Needham and
Chuck Wiper will handle the 220
event, with Needham and Hal
Weatherbe scheduled in the 440
swim. Weatherbe, winner of the
backstroke in the Big Meet during
the past two years, has been con
verted into a free-styler.
LIST SWIMMERS
Stepping into Weatherbe's posi
tion in the backstroke are Bill
Weeden and Dave Duncan. Either
is a potential record-breaker.
Bill Hatch and Lloyd Wilson will
paddle the breast-stroke events.
Vitousek, who swam both free and
breast stroke as a frosh, may be
saved for free style this year.
A top-ranking team in the 440-
yard relay is hoped for, with Clarke,
Vitousek, Wiper and Brahtz occu
pying the four positions.
First meet on the swim calendar
is scheduled within two weeks. The
interclass meet is set for Jan
uary 28.

Bill Hatch and Lloyd Wilson will
paddle the breast-stroke events.
Vitousek, who swam both free and
breast stroke as a frosh, may be
saved for free style this year.
A top-ranking team in the 440-
yard relay is hoped for, with Clarke,
Vitousek, Wiper and Brahtz occu
pying the four positions.
First meet on the swim calendar
is scheduled within two weeks. The
interclass meet is set for Jan
uary 28.
Promising one of the best varsity
swimming squads ever to be as
sembled under the cardinal colors
of Stanford, Coach Nort Thornton
yesterday prophesied that the In
dians would have more than an even
chance of keeping the Pacific Coast
Southern Division swim title safely
in Stanford hands after two con
secutive years of Cardinal pool
supremacy in the West Coast divi
sion.
The Laughing Boys in Stanford
basketball and the football-playing
Vowing Sophs find a parallel in this
year's swim varsity, for major team
hopes fall upon this year's seniors,
the men who helped carry the
squad to the championship during
the past two years.
Only one junior is on the Card
varsity. The remainder of the team
is made up of the sophomores who
swept coast swimming as freshmen
last year.
TROY MAY UPSET
Led by Captain Winfield Need
ham, member of the Intercollegiate
Ail-American squad, and holder of
the conference 220 free-style title,
the squad looks forward to a sched
ule studded with possible upsets,
with the powerful U.S.C. swimmers
heading the list of challengers for
the title.
Title possibilities are brightened
by a squad fairly well rounded in
all positions. Roy Winkelmann,
holder of the conference diving title
for two consecutive years, and
member of the Inter-Collegiate All-
American squad during the same
period, is backed by Sophomore
Bill Nicolls, place-winner in last
year's little big meet.
Three sophomores present record
breaking possibilities in the 300-
yard medley relay. These three
swimmers hold the present national
freshman record for that event at
3:9.9. Bill Weeden, backstroke
member of the trio, is the holder of
the Cal-Stanford frosh inverted
swim title, clipping five seconds
from the Card varsity mark and
two-tenths of a second from the
Pacific Coast Conference figure on
the way in last year's meet.
MEDLEY TEAM
Roy Vitousek, lanky holder of the
freshman intercollegiate 50-yard
free-style title, will turn to breast
stroke for the medley swim. Chuck
Wiper, final medley man, will han
dle the free style, an event in which
he ranks as a man to watch.
Swimming the sprints will be
the veterans Dick Clarke and John
ny Brahtz, backed by Roy Vitousek
and Water-poloist John Lamb.
Lamb captained the water polo
team, but showed promise as a
sprint star by winning the events
in last year's intramural competi
tion. This year will be his first in
swim competition.
Team Captain Needham and
Chuck Wiper will handle the 220
event, with Needham and Hal
Weatherbe scheduled in the 440
swim. Weatherbe, winner of the
backstroke in the Big Meet during
the past two years, has been con
verted into a free-styler.
LIST SWIMMERS
Stepping into Weatherbe's posi
tion in the backstroke are Bill
Weeden and Dave Duncan. Either
is a potential record-breaker.
Bill Hatch and Lloyd Wilson will
paddle the breast-stroke events.
