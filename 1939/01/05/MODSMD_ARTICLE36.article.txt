# Women Watch Frosh Quintet
## Spectator Class Sees Team in Action 
### 
Going on exhibition before Stan
ford women in the Spectator Sports
class last night, the Cardinal frosh
hoopsters put in their second heavy
practice session of the quarter, with
Coach H. B. Lee in the role of ring
master.
Still on the lookout for a winning
combination before they take the
floor against Polytechnic High School
of San Francisco tomorrow night,
Lee worked his newly found talent,
which he discovered through an en
rollment and also shifted positions,
through a two-hour drill before the
women who are learning to appre
ciate sports.
Vern Hoffman of Lodi High was
once again in the spotlight as he
showed that he'll probably be in
there tSmorrow night at guard. The
transfer of Cowden to center from
guard and Bob Penn from center to
forward shows promise of paying
dividends in a big way for the fresh
men in their two week-end entan
glements. These men, along with
Forward Reese and Guard Hamlin,
will form an entirely revamped line
up from the one which opened the
season's schedule last month with
two defeats.
With these two losses to San Jose
High School and Modesto Junior
College, the yearlings must come
back against Poly and George Wash
ington High, who will act as guinea
pigs for Lee's shifting around ex
periments in which the club will
have excellent chances to get on the
black side of the win and loss ledger.
Improving rapidly after their
three-week layoff during the holi
days, the frosh appear to have found
their real strength and have shown
a zest, zip, and fire in the two hard
practices this week.
