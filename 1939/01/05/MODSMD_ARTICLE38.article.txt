# Card Hoopsters Change Defense In Short Drill
## Nebraska Game Shows Weakness in Indian Style, Explains Dean 
### 
Attempting to pick up the loose
ends of a shaky defense, Coach Ev
erett Dean sent the Stanford var
sity hoop team through a short
hour-and-a-half drill on that phase
of the game yesterday afternoon in
the Pavilion.
Dean explained that the reason
the Cards had so much trouble
messing up Nebraska last Tuesday
was because the Cornhuskers were
playing an all-over-the-court of
fensive, which makes a man-to
man defense such as the Cards em
ploy look bad.
Another difficulty was that the
Indians retreated too deep before
the advance of the Huskers, allow
ing them plenty of time on their
long shots.
SHOW IMPROVEMENT
However, the Card team has
come right along since their first
game and have shown steady im
provement. In six games to date, it
has suffered but one defeat, 48-47,
in an overtime period at the hands
of Dartmouth. In turn, the Dean
men have defeated S.F.U., 38-20;
Fresno State, 60-32; Idaho, 33-28;
Oregon, 50-46 in an upset; and Ne
braska, 56-47.
In spite of its fine record the team
is not at full strength, with Don
Burness being out of action at pres
ent with a pulled ligament. The
ace sophomore center injured him
self just when he was expected to
step into a starting berth and Dean
has been forced to shift the team
around in an effort to get a scoring
punch.
SHU T MEN
Captain Phil Zonne has been
shifted from center into his more
familiar forward post, and Dick
Lyon and Bill Py'<p, who both start
ed the season guard, are now al
ternating at th pivot position. Ken
ny Davidson, another sophomore
star, moves into the starting line
up at guard opposite Bobby Bur
nett.
Several of the subs have also
flashed good form, including Har
lan "Bomber" Copsey, Don Wil
liams and Frank Wells at forward;
Dick Taylor, giant center; and Gil
Rahn, guard.
