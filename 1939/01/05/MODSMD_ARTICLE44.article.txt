# Blows Nobody Good

### 
FRIDAY the 13th, traditionally unlucky day,
will this year wash the ill wind from its
breath to charm sorority sisters and take much
of the sting from last year's Revolt in Roble.
This is not so much a prediction as a fact.
Although last year's rebellion brought chill
to sorority hearts and nicked pledge lists, its
effect diminished rapidly after its abrupt end.
It was too much a mere gesture on the part of
a few, certain of pledging, but temporarily
standing by uncertain friends. When pressure
was applied, they guickly deserted their guns.
But in spite of the flash-in-pan character of
the Revolt, it was a visible handwriting on the
wall. Springing from the growing movement
to regard sororities with a dubious eye, it means
that revolts will come again and again—until
there is no longer any need for them.
This year, sorority rushing will go along
much as it always has. Houses will come nearer
to filling their quotas than they did last year.
Hysterics will reign in Roble as the fatal day
draws near. And lucky frosh will slowly build
an intangible wall between themselves and
their less fortunate classmates as the year
draws to a close.
And yet those who pledge do so at their own
risk. The handwriting on the wall is still legible.
Unseen forces are arising, born of more sane
thinking on the subject of sororities, increasing
prominence of hall women in campus life, and
the sororities' own boring from within when
they keep out self-supporting women. And all
the signs substantiate the one-word description
of sororities which is written on ihe wall—
OUTMODED.
The docile Robleites who pledge will be
casting their lot with a dying system.
But the ominous clouds are held back this
year and Friday the 13th will be a lucky day
for the sororities.
Perhaps not so lucky for Roble.
