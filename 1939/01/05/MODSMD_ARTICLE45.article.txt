# The 						Closed Door
## 
### 
COMING after more than two months of
official inaction and student criticism, the
Administration's decision to keep the road along
the Quad permanently closed crystallizes a
status quo which has hampered Farm drivers
since the middle of last quarter.
Excused on the ground that the University
has suddenly realized—evidently for the first
time since it was established—that it is "one
of the few schools in the country which has a
traveled road between its classrooms and its
Library," the arbitrary promptness with which
it has finally been closed seems not only un
necessary but somewhat absurd, in view of the
many, many years during which Stanford bore
her unique disgrace with a strong heart and an
unfaltering will.
Furthermore, it is still hard to follow the logic
behind an action which cuts off the Farm's main
artery to Palo Alto, and necessitates a ponder
ous detour and an inexcusable congestion past
the halls.
True, wilh the growth of Stanford, the road
way has been part of the pedestrian's path
to the Library. But the "traveled road" has
never, at any time, been open more than a few
hours, and has always been closed during
classtime, when congestion is greatest. These
things The Daily, with the whole campus, has
noted. It has suggested widening the road and
restricting parking to make it safer during the
hours when it is open. It has been maintained
throughout that with more than half the student
body owning cars, the traffic problem must be
handled as efficiently and as directly as pos
sible.
Rut with tho Administration's final word on
thr subject, it yields at last to superior logic;
convinced that what must be must be, and
looking with ill-concealed eagerness toward a
future made bright by grass on Lasuen, a sky
scraper on every corner, and that mad, glad
day when Stanford finally revives the horse.
