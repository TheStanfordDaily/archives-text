# Peace with Honor
## 
### 
CHINA has its Japanese invasion, Spain has
its Franco. Africa has its Mussolini, Stanford
has its peace course.
Created through popular demand of the stu
dents, that course began yesterday morning.
And the classroom was so jammed that there
hadn't been enough syllabus sheets prepared—
that won't stop Professor Stuart from preparing
more, but it does indicate that Stanford's Happy
New Year has started off with a consciousness
that all is not well with this best-of-all-worlds.
The course, according to Professor Stuart, as
well as being created by the students, will in
clude student suggestions as to material.
Yesterday morning's greeting proved at least
two things:
Student demand is sufficient to create addi
tions to Stanford's study-list.
Student demand for courses of this type lends
a lie to the statement that Stanford is completely
impervious to the world about it.
Boiled down, the course will poke into the
successes and failures of world peace plans—
now let Stanford men and women poke into
textbooks, push out some sound peace ideals.
