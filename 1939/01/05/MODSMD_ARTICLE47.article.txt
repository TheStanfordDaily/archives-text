### JOHN COBBS 
BUREAU OF FALSE PROPHETS
YY/hile God was resting merry gentlemen and
Christendom was celebrating the glad Noel, pio
neers on the frontier of civilization continued to scout
the way to Utopia. During vacation one of my col
leagues mailed me an advertisement from a San Fran
cisco paper which shows the results of their work.
Headed, "Talk Way into Magic Circle," it describes
the tragedy of poor Jean who is always left out when
other guests get together in happy little groups. More
than that, it suggests a remedy. "If Jean would only
spruce up her vocabulary! She'd seem bright, vivid
to that new man if she'd say, 'What a glorious day!
I wonder if you love its crisp autumn tang as much
as 1 do.'"

It goes on to describe how "that pleasant, chatting
group would welcome her if she would speak color
fully of 'the crackle of the fire,' or 'the queer little
man who waddled down the street.'" It points out
that smooth forms of slang, like "let's go places,"
would be the key to the wrought iron doorways. And
it closes by suggesting that Jean write immediately
for her copy of the 32-page booklet on improving your
vocabulary.
Unquestionably the cultural frontiersmen who spon
sored that ad arc striving for a glorious goal; but I
have the feeling that they are leading civilization into
a blind alley. It is dangerous to risk Jean's future in
society on the chance that queer little men may waddle
into view at just the moment the magic circle is sit
ting in judgment on her vocabulary.

jgUT the weakness of the plan is even more funda
mental than that. If the program of vocabulary
improvement is to succeed, it must work on a mass
production basis. And the booklet? The happy little
groups will sit grimly about the fire waiting for it to
crackle; at the first sputter the company will recite in
chorus, and will then stampede to the window to watch
for queer little men.
It is frightening to think what might become of
the pleasant chatting groups if the wood was dry and
the fire burned in efficient silence, if queer little men
stayed oft the streets, and if the humidity vetoed the
crisp, autumn tang. It is alarming to brood on the
reaction of that new man if he miisnterprcted Jean's
sprightly "let's go places," and regarded it as evidence
of designs either on his morals or on his pocketbook.
Jean can take a flier on the 32-page booklet if she
likes. Personally, I feel safer pegging my chances with
the magic circle on the glitter of a toothpaste smile.
