STANFORD STUDENT
f|NE of our little Stanford girls w;is running herself
ragged yesterday. She would scurry, yes scurry,
from the English Corner to the Education Building to
the Poli Sci lecture rooms to the Psych Corner to the
—well, in short, she was getting around.
Finally, when she was sore in the legs, flat, in the
feet, and mentally ju.st no good at all, she asked some
one where is Room IG3. I've got to find Room 163.
I can't find Room 163.
Her benefactor very patiently showed her, with
the aid of a crisp new Time Schedule, that 163 was
the number of her course, not the room.
I would like to be there when she pays her syllabus
fees.
HOSE HOWE
Listening to the Rose Bowl game Monday, I heard
the announcer explain carefully four times that they
called Duke Eric Tipton "Eric the Red," "even though,"
he would say, "even though he doesn't have red hair.
They must call him that because he makes the other
team see red."
I wonder where that guy was when kids his age
were going to grammar school.

JUSTICE
One guy coining up to the Farm after the vacation
made it in seven hours. If you have ever made the
trip, you know the guy wasn't going 30 miles an hour
all the way. And at one point he stopped for five
minutes and did a little illegal rabbit hunting on the
side.
And just before he gol to the campus a cop gave hint
a ticket forgoing 50 in a 45-mile /.one.

You may remember the story 1 printed a month <>r
->o ago about the very bashful Farm guy who went
down south during Thanksgiving vacation and had a
blind date with a gal who, well, wasn't bashful.
One of his fraternity brothers was South during
Christinas vacation. And made a point of having a
date with the same girl. Tleenti.se you see, tie wasn't
lNi.sb.ful either.
I.IKE THE SON<;
A friend of mine was studying madly for finals
last quarter and smoking furiously the while. At one
point he smelled something burning.
And found, after taking a hasty inventory, that
lie was smoking a pencil and had a burning cigarette
