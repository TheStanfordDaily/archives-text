# Professor Tells Luncheon Club Of Lima Parley
## Dr. Martin Stresses Protective Factors Of Pan-Americanism 
### 
Dr. Percy Martin, of the Stanford
history department, was the speak
er for the Luncheon Club, which
met yesterday noon for the first time
this quarter. "South America and
the Lima Conference" was his topic.
"Eight Pan-American conferences
have been held to date," said Dr.
Martin, "the first being held in 1889
to discover in what respects coun
tries of the New World had interests
or problems in common that were
somehow different from those in
Europe. Some of these problems
were determined as peace preserva
tion, theoretical belief in democracy,
attempt to improve trade relations
by tariff concessions, improved
transportation and communication,
and closer cultural relations.
NEED STRONG RELATIONS
"Pan-Americanism should become
stronger to oppose the rise of the
totalitarian states—this is what made
the present conference of such vital
interest. The propaganda presented
by Italy and Germany to win sym
pathy to their ideals, discredit de
mocracy, and improve trade relations
is a very real menace. It is under
mining United States influence and
democracy."
As an example of this, Dr. Martin
cited the case in the present confer
ence in which Argentina did not
sympathize with Hull's demands for
a resolution that would specifically
mention danger rising from totali
tarian states. He said that the in
fluence of dictatorships caused this.
BRAZIL IS BEST FRIEND'
"However," he continued, "there
is no intention of allowing fascist
states to get a foothold. Brazil is
the United States' best friend, and
the good neighbor policy has allayed
suspicion and developed a feeling
of confidence in Latin American at
titudes. As a result the conference
passed a resolution, adopted by all
of its members, that declared that
whenever the sovereignty or freedom
of any of the Latin American coun
tries was menaced by outside pow
ers, before action should be taken
consultations should take place.
"Roosevelt was anxious to con
vince them that this policy of good
faith was not just his, but the policy
of the American people—this was
why he had Landon go to the con
ference. Success or failure will de
pend upon us because South Amer
ica is still suspicious."

the good neighbor policy has allayed
suspicion and developed a feeling
of confidence in Latin American at
titudes. As a result the conference
passed a resolution, adopted by all
of its members, that declared that
whenever the sovereignty or freedom
of any of the Latin American coun
tries was menaced by outside pow
ers, before action should be taken
consultations should take place.
"Roosevelt was anxious to con
vince them that this policy of good
faith was not just his, but the policy
of the American people—this was
why he had Landon go to the con
ference. Success or failure will de
pend upon us because South Amer
ica is still suspicious."
Dr. Percy Martin, of the Stanford
history department, was the speak
er for the Luncheon Club, which
met yesterday noon for the first time
this quarter. "South America and
the Lima Conference" was his topic.
"Eight Pan-American conferences
have been held to date," said Dr.
Martin, "the first being held in 1889
to discover in what respects coun
tries of the New World had interests
or problems in common that were
somehow different from those in
Europe. Some of these problems
were determined as peace preserva
tion, theoretical belief in democracy,
attempt to improve trade relations
by tariff concessions, improved
transportation and communication,
and closer cultural relations.
NEED STRONG RELATIONS
"Pan-Americanism should become
stronger to oppose the rise of the
totalitarian states—this is what made
the present conference of such vital
interest. The propaganda presented
by Italy and Germany to win sym
pathy to their ideals, discredit de
mocracy, and improve trade relations
is a very real menace. It is under
mining United States influence and
democracy."
As an example of this, Dr. Martin
cited the case in the present confer
ence in which Argentina did not
sympathize with Hull's demands for
a resolution that would specifically
mention danger rising from totali
tarian states. He said that the in
fluence of dictatorships caused this.
BRAZIL IS BEST FRIEND'
"However," he continued, "there
is no intention of allowing fascist
states to get a foothold. Brazil is
the United States' best friend, and
the good neighbor policy has allayed
suspicion and developed a feeling
of confidence in Latin American at
titudes. As a result the conference
passed a resolution, adopted by all
of its members, that declared that
whenever the sovereignty or freedom
of any of the Latin American coun
tries was menaced by outside pow
ers, before action should be taken
consultations should take place.
"Roosevelt was anxious to con
vince them that this policy of good
faith was not just his, but the policy
of the American people—this was
why he had Landon go to the con
ference. Success or failure will de

ica is still suspicious."
