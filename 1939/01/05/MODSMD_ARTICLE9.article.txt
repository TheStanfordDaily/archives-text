# 'Amphitryon' Set for Sunday
## French Film Chosen For Initial Program 
### 
Featuring "Amphitryon," a French
film version with English sub-titles
of the classic Greek legend, and "The
River,"' Pere Lorenz's celebrated
government documentary on the
Mississippi, this quarter's Sunday
Night Movie Series will open Sunday
at 7 o'clock in Memorial Hall. Ad
mission will be twenty cents.
"Amphitryon" uses the same story
as Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontaine
recently acted on the stage in the
play of the same name. The comical
plot deals with an amorous god,
Zeus, who decides he wants to win
the heart of the most faithful woiruin
in all the world, the wife of Am
phitryon, a valiant soldier who is
away at battle.
The only manner in which Zeus
is able to achieve his goal is to dis
guise himself as Amphitryon and go
to see the warrior's wife. The poor
woman is of course hoaxed, but not
until the real Amphitryon arrives
home from the wars and uncxplain
able situations have arisen does she
begin to suspect anything.
The other film to be shown, "The
River," is a treatment of the Mis
sissippi and the problems it presents
to the nation. Second of a series of
government-financed movies, "The
River" achieved immediate national
recognition following its release last
year. James Joyce, the famed mod
ern writer, remarked that the ac
companying narration was among
the most beautiful prose that he had
heard in the last decade.
