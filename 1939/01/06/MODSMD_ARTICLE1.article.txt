### Larry Livingston 
Of® of America's great liberal,
legal minds was appointed to
the Supreme Court yesterday. To
fill the post left, vacant by the death
of Associate Justice Cardozo, Presi
dent Roosevelt selected Professor
Felix Frankfurter of Harvard, like
his predecessor a Jew, a loose con
stitutional constructionist, and one
of the most respected lawyers in
the country.
Born 56 years ago in Vienna,
Frankfurter came to the United
States at the age of 12, unable to
speak English. Twelve years later
lie graduated with highest honors
from the Harvard Law School and,
cxcept for brief periods in public
service, he has devoted himself to
an academic career.
Today this immigrant hoy sits
with the highest judicial body of
the nation. It is not difficult to
imagine the way the Berlin papers
will report his appointment.
Frankfurter's story could only
have happened in the United
States.

npHE new associate justice has long
been known as a champion of
the rights of the common man
against governmental oppression
and a finm believer in an elastic
interpretation of the constitution as
a document designed to meet the
needs of a changing society. He has
been active behind the scenes in the
New Deal as an adviser to Presi
dent Roosevelt.
It. is expected that the Senate
will immediately confirm Professor
Frankfurter's appointment, which
was hailed by all interested parties
cxcept a few who hoped to see a
Westerner in the office and mem
bers of such enlightened groups as
the Dies Committee. Since his
views coincide with Cardozo's,
Frankfurter will not disturb the
present liberal (seven) — conserva
tive (two) line-up of the court.

Approval in Washington was
not so unanimous when President
Roosevelt presented his annual
budget message yesterday as it
was for his court appointment.
He demanded nine billion dollars
for an enlarged national defense
program and continuation of re
lief projects, particularly farm
subsidies.
The U.S. public debt will sky
rocket to an all-time high, within
a half million dollars of the limit
allowed under present laws, as a
result, of the gigantic new budget.
It. is expected that Roosevelt will
ask Congress to raise this ceiling on
'he ground that the government
must be ready to meet any and all
emergencies.
The rich will be soaked to help
pay for the New Deal's expensive
New Year's presents to the nation;
moderate tax increases, designed to
have no repressive influence on
purchasing power, will effect main
ly those in the upper economic
brackets.

\Y/II EN Neville Chamberlain ar
rives in Rome next week, Sig
nor Mussolini will probably be
able to smile blithely at the Brit
ish prime minister's attempts to
make peace according to demo
cratic principles and point to a
new fascist power in Europe.
Today it. is practically certain that.
Generalissimo Francisco Franco's
troops wiil walk of! with the silver
loving-cup in the Spanish civil war.
Yesterday, with the assistance of
numerous Italian "volunteers," the
rebels held Barcelona's defense line
in a death grip ,and advanced to a
position within GO miles of the Re
publican headquarters.
In a final attempt to withstand
Franco's attack, the Spanish Loy
alists ordered all boys and men from
17 to 39 to report for military duty
in Barcelona. A faint note of hope
for the Republic comes in the report
that. Insurgents retreated in disor
der yesterday before a surprise Loy
alist attack on the Estramadure
front, south of Madrid.

j|N BERLIN were heard repercus
sions of President Roosevelt's an
nual message to Congress which
bluntly attacked the policies of Eu
ropean dictatorships. Hitler's offi
cial Nazi news organ claimed that
Roosevelt is urging a break in Ger
man-American relationships and in
tends to eventually start a war with
the Reich.
