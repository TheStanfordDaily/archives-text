# 'Tobias and Angel' To Be Repeated
## 
### 
Due to popular demand, the Divi
sion of Speech and Drama will pre
sent a repeat performance of the
successful "Tobias and the Angel"
January 12 in Memorial Hall Audi
torium. Admission will be 50 cents.
The cast for the production will
be substantially the same as that, of
last December's production, with
leading roles being taken by Rob
ert Coombs, Melba Rae Toombs,
Dan Holtom, and Douglas Bryan.
The story, based on an ancient bib
lical legend, has been rejuvenated
by James Bridie into a modern low
comedy.
The plot deals with the adven
tures of Tobias, a poor youth of
Nineveh, and the archangel Raphael,
on earth disguised as a poor porter.
â€¢Together they set out for Persia,
accompanied by Tobias' dog, Toby
(who almost stole the show in the
last production), in order to collect
a debt for Tobias' father, Tobit.
The elaborate scenery, designed
by William Bassett, will be changed
on the stage in full view of the au
dience. The brililant. Oriental cos
tumes. designed by Florence Hinds
and Susie Mae Lynch, were made
by the costume design class under
the direction of Mrs. Helen Green.
