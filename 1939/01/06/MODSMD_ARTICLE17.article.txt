# ARTISTS EXHIBIT IN GALLERY
## Cooperative Group Shows Work 
### JACK BURTT Harry Sheldon

When the artists of America
banded together two years ago to
form the American Artists Group,
they did a fine thing. They popu
larized the art of the United States,
made it available at low prices, but
did not cheapen it.
Their efforts have made the citiz
ens of this country more art-con
scious than ever before. The finest
young art work in America is now
being produced by these artists, and,
appropriately enough, an exhibit of
their work has been hung in the
Stanford Art Gallery.
The exhibit is entirely of etch
ings, woodcuts, and lithographs, all
originals and most of them signed,
with the addition of three unusual
appearing things called "stencils."
Standout artist of the show Is prob
ably Rockwell Kent.
Kent's name, through Random
House publication of several classics
adorned with his illustrations, has
become familiar to every American.
He is perhaps our best known artist.

I Only two lithographs are in the
i show, but they are recent and the
best of his we have seen. "And Now
Where" and "And Women Must
Weep"—the titles indicate the som
ber theme—are the two, and it would
! be difficult to find anywhere two
more perfect expressions of sorrow.
Our favorite was, however, Paul
! Landacro, represented by three
woodcuts. Two of them, "Rima" and
j "Forest Girl," he did a couple of
years ago as entries in a Limited Edi-
I tions Club illustration contest for
their edition of W. H. Hudson's
I "Green Mansions." Landacre's typi
' cally intense light effects, with great
paths of light descending diagonally
I into the picture to spot the central
figure, make these stand out in any
gallery. Were they not so beauti
| fully formed, they would glare.
The third, "Sultry Day," is one of
Landacre's finest blocks. Darker
j than the other two, with none of
their fantasie, "Sultry Day" is as
drab and real as Studs Lonigan.
It is unfortunate, we thought, that
nothing newer by Landacrc was
i included in the show. In the past
II wo years, the artist lias improved

his technique lo the point where lie
can make a woodcut as liquid and
soft as a fine lithograph. He had not
achieved such technique when he
cut the three blocks exhibited.
Other notable prints, all litho
graphs, included Howard Cook's ar
chitectural "Looking Up Broadway,"
Mabel Dwight's bizarre and perti
nent "'Queer Fish," William Grop
per's strange, moving "Refugees,"
Conrad Buff's soft, white "Forest
Folk" and "The Family Outing,"
two accurate representations of cir
cus life by Waldo Peirce, Alice Mur
phy's lively "Umbrellas," and Jean
Chariot's grotesque, humorous "Tor
tilla Maker."
A word of criticism, however—the
prints were exhibited in the lecture
room, making it difficult to get close
enough to read titles and artists'
names without falling over chairs.
The lighting for the exhibit, was
also not bright enough. And we
would suggest that more pains be
taken with the matting job next
time. The mat around nearly every
print, was somewhat wrinkled and
lacked the neatness which the qual
ity of the exhibit demanded.

I tions Club illustration contest for
their edition of W. H. Hudson's
I "Green Mansions." Landacre's typi
' cally intense light effects, with great
paths of light descending diagonally
I into the picture to spot the central
figure, make these stand out in any
gallery. Were they not so beauti
| fully formed, they would glare.
The third, "Sultry Day," is one of
Landacre's finest blocks. Darker
j than the other two, with none of
their fantasie, "Sultry Day" is as
drab and real as Studs Lonigan.
It is unfortunate, we thought, that
nothing newer by Landacrc was
i included in the show. In the past
II wo years, the artist lias improved

his technique lo the point where lie
can make a woodcut as liquid and
soft as a fine lithograph. He had not
achieved such technique when he
cut the three blocks exhibited.
Other notable prints, all litho
graphs, included Howard Cook's ar
chitectural "Looking Up Broadway,"
Mabel Dwight's bizarre and perti
nent "'Queer Fish," William Grop
per's strange, moving "Refugees,"
Conrad Buff's soft, white "Forest
Folk" and "The Family Outing,"
two accurate representations of cir
cus life by Waldo Peirce, Alice Mur
phy's lively "Umbrellas," and Jean
Chariot's grotesque, humorous "Tor
tilla Maker."
A word of criticism, however—the
prints were exhibited in the lecture
room, making it difficult to get close
enough to read titles and artists'
names without falling over chairs.
The lighting for the exhibit, was
also not bright enough. And we
would suggest that more pains be
taken with the matting job next
time. The mat around nearly every
print, was somewhat wrinkled and
lacked the neatness which the qual
ity of the exhibit demanded.

When the artists of America
banded together two years ago to
form the American Artists Group,
they did a fine thing. They popu
larized the art of the United States,
made it available at low prices, but
did not cheapen it.
Their efforts have made the citiz
ens of this country more art-con
scious than ever before. The finest
young art work in America is now
being produced by these artists, and,
appropriately enough, an exhibit of
their work has been hung in the
Stanford Art Gallery.
The exhibit is entirely of etch
ings, woodcuts, and lithographs, all
originals and most of them signed,
with the addition of three unusual
appearing things called "stencils."
Standout artist of the show Is prob
ably Rockwell Kent.
Kent's name, through Random
House publication of several classics
adorned with his illustrations, has
become familiar to every American.
He is perhaps our best known artist.

I Only two lithographs are in the
i show, but they are recent and the
best of his we have seen. "And Now
Where" and "And Women Must
Weep"—the titles indicate the som
ber theme—are the two, and it would
! be difficult to find anywhere two
more perfect expressions of sorrow.
Our favorite was, however, Paul
! Landacro, represented by three
woodcuts. Two of them, "Rima" and
j "Forest Girl," he did a couple of
years ago as entries in a Limited Edi-
I tions Club illustration contest for
their edition of W. H. Hudson's
I "Green Mansions." Landacre's typi
