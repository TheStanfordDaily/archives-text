# Varsity, Papoose Hoopsters Slate Double-Headers
## Frosh Cagers Meet Paly High In Preliminary 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Stanford's frosh hoopsters, play
ers who will be called upon to step
into several varsity berths next
year, will attempt to take a new
lease on life when they tangle with
Polytechnic High School of San
Francisco in tonight's 6:30 o'clock
curtain-raiser to the Indian - St.
Mary's basketball encounter.
Although this week's practices
have been the first since the yeer
ilngs lost two games a month ago.
Coach H. B. Lee believes he litis
partly threshed out the difficulties
of numerous high school system* of
basketball and expects a consider
ably improved brand of ball from
his hirelings.
SQUAD REVAMPED
Since taking it on the chin two
times last month from San .Jose
High School and Modeslo Junior
College, the freshmen have been al
most completely revamped by Lee,
who held down guard last year
with Luisetti and company. Besides
being revamped â€” only two men
who started those games wi'l be on
the floor at whistle time tonight,
the squad has been shifted avcurd
-with guards becoming forwards and
centers, and vice versa.
Lee's experiment, tried out in
three practice sessions this week,
has worked out satisfactorily while
the change has instilled a keener
spirit among the players. Although
all the offensive and defensive
wrinkles have not been completely
smoothed out, observers are expect
ing the now taller outfit really to
function tonight for the first time
this season.
WASHINGTON HIGH NEXT
After tackling Poly, one of the
strongest high school outfits in the
bay district, the first-year cagcrs
will go into a Saturday night fray
with George Washington High
School as a preview to the Card-
Santa Clara joust.
After these tilts, the Papooses will
be busy every week-end until March
4, when they close their 19-game
schedule with Cal's Bear Cubs in
the third game of their annual
grudge series.
Bill Cowden, who has been moved
from guard to center, and Bob
Penn, lanky 6-foot 6-inch player,
who has been shifted from the pivot
post to forward, are the lone starters
from the crew which played first
string last month.
NEW MEN APPEAR
Vein Hoffman is the prized re
cruit dug up over the holiday ivory
hunting season. The Lodi High
transfer is almost a sure starter at
guard, although he has been work
ing out with the squad only this
week. Impressed by the work of
Ollie Hamlin at guard and Lew
Reese at forward, Lee has moved
these men up to the first string to
work with the tall Penn-Cowden-
Hoffman combination.
Dick Ray, Joe Messina, Chuck
Smith, Paul Blanton, Jack Deacon,
Bob Billings, Jack Bettys, Hank
Claflin, Bob Breckncr, Morgan
Noble, and Bob Scharbach arc un
derstudies to the first-string quin
tet and are expected to sec consid
erable action.
