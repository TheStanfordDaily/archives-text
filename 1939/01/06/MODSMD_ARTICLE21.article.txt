# Cardinal Squad Set for Tough Gaels, Broncs
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
Stanford's varsity hoopmen yet a
glimpse of some more big time com
petition tonight and tomorrow night
ir the Pavilion when they engage
St. Mary's and Santa Clara, respec
tively. Both games start at 8
o'clock with admission fo" Stanford
students lree.
Despite the fact that Coach Dean
is looking a week ahead toward the
opening conference scries with the
University of Southern California,
he isn t overlooking the excellence
that this week-end's foes possess.
Dean himself scouted Santa Clara
in an early game while Ben Win
kelman covered the Gaels in their
last game against the California Ag
gies. So the Indians know just
what they're up against tonight.
BRONCOS STRONG
Those men who played last year
don't need to be convinced of toe
Bronco's strength after the way
they extended Hank Luisetti and

Company to an overtime period be
fore losing 56-55 in one of the most,
exciting games of the season.
The Cards' starting line-up to
night will find Captain Phil Zonae
and Leon Lafaille at forward, Bob
Burnett and Kenny Davidson at
guard, and either Dick Lyon or
Bill llapp at the center position.
However, on defense Burnett, moves
to forward and Zonne back to guard
where his height can be utilized on
rebounds, while Burnett, who is one
of the fastest men on the team, can
scoot down the floor on fast breaks.
LAFAILLE EXPERIENCED
However, once the ofTense is set.
up, Burnett goes back to guard and
Zonne to forward. Lafaille played
quite a bit last year and has a wick
ed shooting eye to go with his ex
perience.
Lyon and Rapp arc about a stand
oil at center, both being tough boys
to handle around either basket.
Dean is counting on these two sen
iors to make up for the loss of Don
Burness, highly touted soph who is
out at present with a pulled leg
ligament.
Kenny Davidson is another of the
many second-year stars, and he
bides fair to become an outstanding
hoopman before lie gets through.
Right now, he takes a back seat to
few players for alert defensive play
and clever offensive passing.
llKill-POINT MAN
Of course, diminutive Bob Bur
nett needs no introduction with his
spectacular shooting and sensational
defensive work. Burnett, only 5
feet. 8 inches tall, and an offensive
guard, is high-point man for the
team thus far with (!2 points in six
games, or an average of 10 1/3 digits
a game.
St. Mary's will probably start a
line-up composed of Andrade and
Meetz, forwards; Fcency, center;
and Noonan and Wood, guards.
Noonan is the boy that took nine
shots against the Cal Aggies—and
sank eight of them. The Gaels,
coached by Harlan Dykes, have
dropped a game to California, but.
