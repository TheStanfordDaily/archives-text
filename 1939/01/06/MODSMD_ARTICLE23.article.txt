# Debate Squad Plans Frosh-Soph Contest
## 
### 
Members of the varsity debate
squad were advised of plans for
coming tours, the success of the In
dian tour and the proposed fresh
man-sophomore debate at a general
meeting yesterday afternoon. The
meeting was conducted by Bob Put
j.am, acting debate manager.
Bob Curtis, president of the local
chapter of Delta Sigma Rho, hono
rary forensic fraternity, announced
that the formerly traditional fresh
man-sophomore debate was to be
revived Jan. 26. The debate will be
presented in the auditorium of the
Education Building, and will be giv
en in the formal, Joftre style. The
general topic will be "America and
World Peace."
The sophomore team will be com
posed of Milton Marks, Hugh O'Don
nell and Walt Stoessel, while the
freshman team will include Roger
Boas, George Jackson and Bob
Hanna.
Putnam gave several interesting
sidelights on the trip, remarking
that although members of the tour
traveled quite extensively through
the southwestern Indian territory,
their journey was limited by the
wet weather and snows encoun
tered at this time of year. He an
nounced that while there would be
no tour during spring quarter this
year, due to a limited budget, it
was anticipated that another journey
would be taken sometime fall quar
ter to continue the work started by
this term's travelers.
FIVE TRAVEL
The Stanford men who went on
tour were Walt Stoessel, Bob Moul
ton, Harry Horton, Bob Putnam and
Howard Roberts, Quad photogra
pher. They made the trip in ten
days during Christmas vacation and
gathered volumes of material con

cerning the American Indian and his
problems.
Apropos of successful completion
of the tour, Leland Chapin, debate
coach, said yesterday that such
tours were an integral part of his
proposed "backward" procedure for
Stanford debaters. Mr. Chapin went
on to say that the customary pro
cedure has been for speakers to delve
into books for knowledge on a cer
tain subject, then launch on a tour to
debate various far-flung groups.
SECURE INFORMATION
In contrast, he maintains that the
tour should be taken first to secure
information on some timely topic;
then the debaters return armed with
first-hand knowledge and can en
gage in constructive forum activity.
