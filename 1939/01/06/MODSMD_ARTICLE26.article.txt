# European Differences Handicap Scientists

### JACK BURTT 
The rise of the dictators and the
precarious international situation in
Europe today have imposed tremen
dous difficulties on scientific re
search on the continent, with po
litical differences directly affecting
conferences on even so far-removed
a subject as physiology, according to
Dr. J. P. Baumberger, professor of
physiology, who returned recently
from a six-month sojourn abroad.
Dr. Baumberger found, however,
that in spite of the handicap of
constant political interference, sig
nificant research in physiology is
being carried on in Europe. He
pointed out that this was especially
the case in small, inconspicuous and
comparatively civilized countries,
as Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark,
Holland, Belgium, and Czechoslo
vakia.
While abroad, Dr. Baumberger
presented a paper at the 50th anni
versary meeting of the Internation
al Physiological Congress, held in
Zurich last August. His subject was
"Oxygen Consumption in Tissues,"
a problem which is also concerning
Swedish investigators at the pres
ent time.
Physiological research is con
stantly turning to a greater em
phasis on the nature of the com
plex chemical reactions which oc
cur in cells, both normal and path
ologic, according to Dr. Baumberg
er. He pointed out that this swing
of interest has opened new fields for
the study of cancer.
Research has shown that certain
types of cancer may be dependent

upon the deviations from the noi-m
of sex hormones. He said that this
was important in that as soon as the
agencies which actually cause can
cer are discovered it is possible that
the nature of their disturbances of
cells may be known. He feels that
there is more chance now thari ever
before that cancer may be under
stood.
Dr. Baumberger considered that
the physiological conference had
been a tremendously valuable one.
Over 1500 scientists from most of the
countries of the western world were
present, and a great number of truly
significant papers were presented,
many of which he feels will some
day be recognized as of great im
portance. He added the information
that Russia sent no delegation to the
conference, and that outstanding
scientists either remained aloof
fiom the gathering or were kept
away altogether because of political
considerations.

the case in small, inconspicuous and
comparatively civilized countries,
as Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark,
Holland, Belgium, and Czechoslo
vakia.
While abroad, Dr. Baumberger
presented a paper at the 50th anni
versary meeting of the Internation
al Physiological Congress, held in
Zurich last August. His subject was
"Oxygen Consumption in Tissues,"
a problem which is also concerning
Swedish investigators at the pres
ent time.
Physiological research is con
stantly turning to a greater em
phasis on the nature of the com
plex chemical reactions which oc
cur in cells, both normal and path
ologic, according to Dr. Baumberg
er. He pointed out that this swing
of interest has opened new fields for
the study of cancer.
Research has shown that certain
types of cancer may be dependent

upon the deviations from the noi-m
of sex hormones. He said that this
was important in that as soon as the
agencies which actually cause can
cer are discovered it is possible that
the nature of their disturbances of
cells may be known. He feels that
there is more chance now thari ever
before that cancer may be under
stood.
Dr. Baumberger considered that
the physiological conference had
been a tremendously valuable one.
Over 1500 scientists from most of the
countries of the western world were
present, and a great number of truly
significant papers were presented,
many of which he feels will some
day be recognized as of great im
portance. He added the information
that Russia sent no delegation to the
conference, and that outstanding
scientists either remained aloof
fiom the gathering or were kept
away altogether because of political
considerations.
The rise of the dictators and the
precarious international situation in
Europe today have imposed tremen
dous difficulties on scientific re
search on the continent, with po
litical differences directly affecting
conferences on even so far-removed
a subject as physiology, according to
Dr. J. P. Baumberger, professor of
physiology, who returned recently
from a six-month sojourn abroad.
Dr. Baumberger found, however,
that in spite of the handicap of
constant political interference, sig
nificant research in physiology is
being carried on in Europe. He
pointed out that this was especially
the case in small, inconspicuous and
comparatively civilized countries,
as Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark,
Holland, Belgium, and Czechoslo
vakia.
