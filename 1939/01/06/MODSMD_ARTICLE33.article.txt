# New Gale Threat Fades in North
## 
### 
F'ORTLAND, Ore.. Jan. .5 (UP).â€”
Clale warnings were lowered along
the Northwest coastline today, after
a North Pacific storm "flattened out"
before reaching the mainland.
Heavy seas and near-record tides
continued to hatter Oregon and
U. liington coast cities, however,
and ship traffic across the Columbia
Piver bar was halted.
