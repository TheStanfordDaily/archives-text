! STANFORD hoopsters will play a
lot of basketball this week-end,
and hoop fans will see five good
I games.
St. Mary's College should be easy
meat for the Indian ball-handling
' speed-burners even though their
I record so far is a fine one. The Cal
i live has been the only team to take
St. Mary's so far, and then only by
pulling out from behind in the last
three minutes of the game.
The Gaels are about the same
I size as the Cards, and they too have
ito capitalize on speed. The Stan
! lord-Nebraska contest Tuesday
| night was a good example of what
| sometimes happens when two fast
teams meet. —so many players are
i sprawled on the floor that it is hard
to tell whether the game is played
I on the feet or horizontally. But the
I problem solved itself as the game
! progressed, and tonight's game
I should be fast and smooth.
Noonan and Woods of St. Mary's
j have a reputation for high-scoring,
j while Andrade adds color with one
i handed shots that can't be blocked.
; But they use a modified zone de
| fense that will be certainly easier to
penetrate than Nebraska's pick-up
j system.
* i:<
OEEBS LEE'S yearlings will play
their first preliminary tonight
! and their first game against a well
organized high school quintet.
It's a hard job to take live fresh
| men who play five systems of bas
j ketball and mold them into one
j team, but Lee has done a fine job
of it so far, and tonight his boys
will be put to a real test. If they
defeat Polytechnic High, they're a
y , fine team. And

if they lose, they
J, might still be.
Tomo r r o w
night they'll play
another prelimi
nary. against an
other high school

I aggregation, George Washington
1 High, another unknown quantity.
| But a high school should have the
: edge in any case until lreshmen
' have had considerable experience
; together.

' Indians will probably
! K meet their hardest opponent to
morrow night when Santa Clara re
! turns from a successful barnstorm
ing tour of the Midwest.
Adding to the excitement of a
close contest will he the fact that
Stanford and Santa Clara play
practically the same kind of bas
ketball. Both have reputations
for speed and sharp ball-handling,
and both use an assigned man-to
man defense.
It has not been forgotten that
' Santa Clara gave Hank Luisetti and
| the Laughing Boys a run for their
i money last year, and lost to the
i Cards only in an overtime period
j and by one point. Giannini. the
j man who was said to be the out
standing challenge to Luisetti's
1 claim to hoop fame, will be on the
: floor again. Nelson. 6-6 Bronco cen
| ter, and the Lautz brothers, dead
| eyes of the first water, will also be
I on hand to add their talent in an
attempt to defeat the Cards and
break their morale just lie fore the
j conference openers.
' The Broncos have done that bo
fore.
