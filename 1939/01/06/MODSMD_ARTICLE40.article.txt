# Rain Slows Up Card Trackmen
## 
### 
Although rains threaten to put the
Farm's trackmen behind the eiyht
ball |pr the next week, everything
but the spark of championship
spirit has been dampened down on
Angell Field.
Captain Stan Hiserman, Clvde
Jeffrey, Bill Wohle. Russ Wulff. et
al, leaders of the new Stanford
spirit which sees a potentially crack
outfit this spring, have taken to
various other practice fields during
the current storm.
Claiming to be better fast-track
performers rather than mudders.
Coach Dink Tempelton's runners
have been slowed up considerably
by Jupiter Pluvius. but they still
point to their record-breaking marks
in November. With these marks to
show the critics, the Indian short
pantied athletes have every reason
to anticipate the best cinder season
since the "boom days" of Ben East
man and Hec Dyer.
Two new recruits were taken into
the Templeton-EUington fold during
the holidays, while S.C. has still
failed to lure Jeffrey from the Farm.
Hiserman is being counted upon to
have his best year—only this time
as a low hurdler instead of as a
sprinter. Russ WuKT, a 6-loot 6-inch

1 high jumper in his own right, has
been building up his weak ankles
by turning in fair quarter and half
mile marks under Templeton's
tutelage.
Bill Wohle, who put the shot over
the 50-foot mark during fall prae
( tice. will head one of the .strongest
weight divisions in Stanford's his
tory. Bill Trout, transfer from
Bakersfield Junior College this
, quarter, is considered an outstand
ing prospect to team with Wohle,
Stan Anderson and Allen Grey. All
are consistently better than 50 feet
when in shape.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 5 (UP).—The
