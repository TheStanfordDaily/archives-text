# Milk Is Spilt

WHEN the announcement came that the
Junior Executive Committee, squirming
before circumstances, agreed to change the
Prom to spring quarter, a biting editorial
seemed inevitable.
Where was the apparent logic in putting the
Prom in company with the lew other items
which jam the last months of school: the
Masque Ball, the Senior Prom, the Senior Ball,
the Convalescent Home Drive, senior projects
and general expenses, and the all-round hurri
cane of house and hall dances?
Why should the juniors bow gracefully to
Scabbard and Blade, an independent, unrepre
sentative body who will charge a neat $4.00
for their bids? Why should not Stanford howl
when, laboring under the theory that it is to find
its entertainment at home, it is apparently knifed
in the back by the Blade, undermined by a
short-sighted date-planning policy, and clubbed
by the weak-kneed Prom committee? But the
editorial blast would be somewhat unfair, for
none of these crippling blows fell, not exactly,
that is.
In this case, circumstances beyond control
cast the die. Because of the basketball schedule,
the Pavilion will be free only on the night of
the Cal game at Berkeley and on two other
successive week-end nights. Obviously it
would be suicide to hold two high-priced,
name-band dances on successive week-ends.
(The alternative of jamming into spring quar
ter seems hardly better, however, except as a
temporary solution.)
And since Scabbard put in its bid first, Scab
bard rates the only bid winter quarter dance.
For the moment, everyone is relatively happy.
There the story endsâ€”for this year anyhow.
Under the present system of date planning and
dance planning, nothing else can be done to
remedy the situation. The course taken was
the only wise or possible one.
But the whole date system of first come, first
serve has reached the end of its rope. It has
come to the point now where no amount of
juggling will untangle an overcrowded spring
quarter schedule.

Under its reign, campus entertainment has
become anything but entertainment for the
campus: rather it is a prestige-getting device
for the different organizations; a race to out
name band the previous dance; a project finan
cially controlled with an eye only to swimming
out of the deep water which name-bands have
brought, and not to bring entertainment within
easy reach of the campus as a whole.
Quite obviously, too, all good resolves of
student leaders to attempt long-range planning
are doomed to failure before they are put into
effect.
First come, first serve may be a fair policy,
removed from the arbitrary dictatorship of
a planning committee. But it will never keep
spring quarter from piling on the rocks of too
many expensive projects; it will never prevent
the continual addition of more activities while
old ones are repeatedly log-rolled back into
position.
And it will never prevent unavoidable
clashes such as the Prom-Scabbard fracas, for
which the remedy is only a little better than
the malady.
Perhaps everything will work out all right;
perhaps every dance this year, and year after
year, will show a profit; perhaps the campus
will be financially strong enough to provide
those profits.
Perhaps it will get fed up and go to the com
parative quiet of the city ball rooms.
