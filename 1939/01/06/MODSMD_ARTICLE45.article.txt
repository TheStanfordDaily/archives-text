# Farm Flicks Flick

MOVE out the kleigs, turn out the lights—
the flicks are back at Stanford.
Despite Will Hays, despite the movie indus
try, despite innumerable obstacles, super-fe
neigler Coline Upshaw and her Ex Committee's
sub-committee will sell Sunday movies in Me
morial Hall on Sunday night at 20 cents per.
The movie question, long though dead, will
come to life with Zeus, Mrs. Amphitroy, and
the Old Man himself. Although Farm film
goers will still be prevented from seeing cur
rent Hollywood releases in the Hall, a com
bination of foreign films and specialties such
as this Sunday's feature, Pare Lorenz' "The
River,'' will make good entertainment.
The arguments for and against Sunday night
movies were well hashed over last year—but
the most important one—that they bring good
films cheaply and conveniently—still holds.
And any profits will most probably be used
to help pay for the boathouse.
That is, if there are no more contract tie-ups;
if Stanford wants Sunday night movies as
much as it seems to.—H. t.. S.
