# BULL SESSION

### JOHN COBBS 
WESTWARD WOE
A COUPLE of friends of the family rolled around
just at the end of vacation and found me cursing
the institution of travel and transport through a
mouthful of the bathrobe I was trying to fold. The
female half of the combination made cooing, motherly
noises and crooned, "But I am sure that travel has
done so much for me. Travel is so broadening." I
looked at her silhouette and agreed absently.
Today I am back in the arms of dear alma mater
—two days late because I am convinced that only
elderly ladies and maladjusted young intellectuals
would conijder spending New Year's Eve on an econ
omy train westbound out of Chicago. I have broad
ened neither in beam nor in outlook; but four days of
regarding the American continent have left me with
a few definite ideas that were not included in my
course in grammar school geography.

Practically all of the impressions I picked up on
the trip go to back up one of two general ideas which
gradually developed as 1 watched, like one of the
movies that are shown classes in elementary biology.
There are, of course, a few other stray bits of informa
tion, such as the fact that Los Angeles is a town where
doctors wear their white coats out to lunch; but these
are trivial.
The two conclusions that I reached were: (1) The
interior of this continent should never have been taken
from the Indians; and (2) The representatives of hu
manity found in a club car are the inferiors both in
entertainment value and in manners of the representa
tives of the animal kingdom found in any respectable
zoo.

T REALIZE that even an unbiased observer must be
a little cautious about dismissing so cavalierly the
"backbone" of the United States. But I have, spent
the last four days exiled in representative sections of
Nebraska, Wyoming, Nevada, and similar desolate
places. They all look like the stage set for the witches
scene in Macbeth.
Probably people learn to love the interior of this
continent. But what I can't understand is why any
body would stop there long enough to learn anything.
In fact, I sincerely hope that if H. G. Wells' Martian
invaders ever land on earth, they see Nebraska first.

If the country along the way had looked a little
less like Egypt after the plagues of Moses, I might
have been able to ignore the odds and ends of people
that cluttered up the club car. As it was even a deep
rooted faith in the virtue of charity couldn't keep me
from regarding them as Exhibit A in the case for
birth control.
The club car fauna divided into three general
classes. There were the relaxing business men, with
unbuttoned vests and collars loosened to clear their
auxiliary chins. Accompanying this species was a set
of determinedly youthful women, obviously other peo
ple's wives in spite of slacks and hair bleach.
The third class consisted of slightly overweight,
obviously unmarried women. They wore pince-nez
and read good books; but they hopefully crossed
pudgy legs, crammed into sheer hose, so that their
inadequate skirts revealed the maximum of billow
ing calf. Nothing ever happened to them, but they
were evidently prepared for any insult God might
grant.
I reached Stanford after four days in which I
shifted my attention desperately from the landscape
to the club car, and then desperately shifted back.
One of the beloved brethren dropped in to see if
there were any Christmas presents worth borrowing.
He fingered the check-room tags on my suitcase and
said enviously, "Gee, you know travel is really broad
ening."
