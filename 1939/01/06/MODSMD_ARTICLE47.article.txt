Sometimes I think I'll turn communist, times when
I'm sitting here in the Shack typing on a ribbon so
grey that I'm continually hitting my nose with the
keys when I try to see what I have written.
Not that I particularly want to see what I have
written, but. they tell me I have to watch spelling
errors and things—'l'm an old hand at phonetic spell
ing—because, they say, someday someone might be
looking through my column. "And for God's sake,"
they say, "let's not have spelling errors too."
Yes, sometimes I think I'll turn communist. Every
now and then some stray piece will fall ofE my type
writer, and then I have to put up with rattles as well
as with a very grey ribbon. It's funny about these
modern typewriters. An awful lot of things can fall
ofT them before they stop writing.

But that doesn't stop me from wanting lo turn
communist sometimes. Those sleek boys from the
business staff come strutting through here in their
pretty clothes carrying their capitalistic ads out
to the backshop. They never look at us and our
sweatshop ribbons. They never look at anything
but the dollar signs before their eyes.
It would be so easy for theni to give us a few
pence to buy (blue) ribbons with and to get a
little glue to put our typewrtiers back together
with, but they just go on making money and
then making more money and then making more
money.
And they look so damn rich!
When the revolution comes, those guys had bet
ter look out.

Our sports editor is the only one who can get.
anything away from them. He went into the business
office yesterday.
"I need a new ribbon for my typewriter."
"What d'ya mean? You've already had a ribbon
this year," the vice-president in charge of Petty Af
fairs growled.
"Sure, four months ago."
The Vice-President in charge of P.A. turned to
the boys in his office. "This guy got a brand new dis
carded ribbon four months ago. and already he wants
{mother one. He thinks we're made of money."
"I'm just trying to save you some money."
"Huh!"
"That ribbon I got is so bad that the linotype opera
tor has to read my copy in Braille. Do you know how
much more it costs to have him read Braille?"
"My God!" The possibilities of this expense imme
diately staggered the V.-P. in charge of P.A. "Don't
tell me!" For the first time in three years dollar
signs stopped floating in front of his eyes, and his
eyes actually began to focus a little. He reached into
the bottom drawer of his desk for a new ribbon—ac
tually a brand new one-—and gave it to Shally, gasped
something about don't let this happen again, and
fainted dead away.
When the revolution romes, I'm goinc to see
that the business staff pels nothing but blind lino
typists.
And the guy I'm going to make Chief Com
