# Diva Reveals Exciting Life In New Book
## "SUCH SWEET COMPULSION," 
### Geraldine Farrar 
The autobiography of any opera
star, if written with any degree of
intelligence, is sure-fire entertain
ment. Add to this point the fact
that Geraldine Farrar is a witty and
brililant woman who has engaged in
rather more of the extra-curricular
activities attendant to a musical ca
reer than some of her straiter
laced colleagues, and the result —
"Such Sweet Compulsion" —is a
fascinating book.
Gerry Farrar, born in Melrose,
Mass., in 1882, made her debut with
the Berlin Royal Opera before she
was 21. When she retired from the
concert stage in 1931, she was the
best known American singer in the
world. For her time Farrar was a
revolutionary type of diva, for she
was one of the first of the singing
actresses.
This theatrical sense was carried
into her personal life, and she was
one of the pre-war glamor girls.
This is made clear in her book, be
cause, fortunately for the reader's
entertainment, Miss Farrar is not.
exactly modest.
Beautiful, smartly gowned opera
stars, who in those days carried with
them a slight air of disrespectability,
were in great demand. Miss Farrar
was no exception, and she managed
to know most of the famous people
of her day.
Of course many of her acquaint
ances were those of her own pro
fession and she covers them all —
Nordica, Caruso, Scotti, Calve, Des
tinn, and the rest. Her comments
are marked in some cases with a
very acid sense of humor. Maria
Jeritza, when she came to the Met
ropolitan from Vienna, brought with
her a new and daring bit of business
for La Tosca. During the famous
"Vissi d'arte," she would lie on the
floor in a pose of "unashamed aban
don." Remarks Miss Farrar, "I was
surprised at. the questionable flaunt
ing of a well-cushioned and obvious
posterior."
Mata Hari, Isadora Duncan, the
Crown Prince of Germany, Tosca
nini, all pass under her amusing
and very sharp pen. Yet in spite' of
the many people and places with
which she deals, she manages to give
a clear portrait of the great opera
star and fascinating woman, Ger
aldine Farrar.—Nowell
