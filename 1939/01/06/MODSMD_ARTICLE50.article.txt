# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
I wish to protest and deplore this
thing, the Hoover War Library. This
campus is dedicated to the proposi
tion that all buildings shall be
Spanish Mission. This edition of the
Coit tower is not S.M. Why a tower
of Babel in our midst?
There's enough space around hers
to build the Yankee Stadium, a race
track and a railroad terminal; a
skyscraper is as out of place here
as in the Sahara desert. I'm be
ginning to hear talk of another dy
namite fund. This building LOOMS,
and we can't stand looming build
ings. •
