### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 5 (UP).—
Zane Grey, no*ed novelist, sailed
today aboard the liner Mariposa en
route to a lonely island in the In
dian ocean to write his next book—
about a mammoth cattle migration
in Australia.
"It will be a true account," he said,
"of a dramatic cattle drive started
by 25 men and 7,000 animals across
the wastes of Australia, and finished
by only two of the men and 200 of
the animals."
