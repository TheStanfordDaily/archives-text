# Earhart's Death Legally Declared
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 5 (UP).—
Eighteen months after her round
the-world plane disappeared in the
South Pacific, Amelia Earhart was
declared legally dead today.
Judge Elliot Craig signed an order
which waived the costomary seven
year-law and permitted her hus
band, George Palmer Putnam, to
dispose of her estate valued "in ex
cess of $10,000." The court said it
was setting aside the customary law
because of the abundance of evi
dence pointing to her fate.

NEW YORK, Jan. 5 (UP).—Fire
swept through a five-story "old
law" tenement today, killing at least
four persons and driving 200 others
into the street.
