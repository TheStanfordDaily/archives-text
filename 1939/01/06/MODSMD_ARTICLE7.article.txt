## Ex-Council Debates Winter Prom Date 
### 
To join or not to join the current
squabble over winter quax*ter dance
dates, and the announcement of
early-committee appointments were
shot through the first short meeting
of Senior Executive Council last
night.

After a brief welcome by Class
President Dave Ryus, and the state
ment that letters had been sent, to
universities throughout the counti*y
to ask for novel Senior Week activi
ties, the committee heard and ap
proved the appointment of A1 Horn
as chairman of the Programs and
Announcements Committee.
COMMITTEE NAMED
To work with him will be Gret
chen Ahlswede, Didi Vibert, Bob
Burnett, Dcane Johnson, and Dick
Stepp. The committee will imme
diately contact printers in an ef
fort to make an early decision on
style and costs.
But. the main business of the
meeting circled around the sugges
tion that the senior class step into
the date vacated by the juniors to
hold a winter quarter Senior Prom.
The dance, if carried through, would
be held on February 17, one week
befoi'e Scabbard and Blade's dance.
Some decision will be made before
the next Ex Committee meeting,
and, if favorable, request for the
date will be made at that time.

Meanwhile, a Prom committee
headed by Chuck Prince will con
sider possible plans. In charge of
publicity will be John Shallcn
berger; decorations, Jack Laney,
