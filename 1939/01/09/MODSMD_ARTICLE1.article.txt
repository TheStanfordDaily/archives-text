### Larry Livingston 
I IKE the? first week-end of the
J quarter at Stanford, disturbed
only by the sound of roller skates,
the world has been comparatively
quiet during the past few days. At
a time when sensational develop
ments in world a flairs are the usual
tiling, it is somewhat surprising to
view 48 hours marked only by the
lengthening shadow of Adolph Hit
ler in eastern Europe and the
homecoming of Tom Mooney.
Germany's designs on the great
wheat-producuig lands of the
Ukraine, Hungary and Roumania
grow continually more apparent as
border clashes arc taking place be
tween Hungary and Carpatho-
Ukraine, easternmost province of
Czechoslovakia. In a Reich using
all its resources in the production
of armaments, the food supply is
bound to run low eventually.
Adolph Hitler knows this, and
lie knows that someday he is go
ing to have to do something about
it. So he is keeping his eye on
that logical source of a future Ger
man food supply, the bread basket
of eastern Europe.
It. is generally agreed that the
little border unpleasantries cur
rently taking place were instigated
by Czech troops upon the timely
suggestion and encouragement of
German officials. In the two en
gagements which took place yes
terday, a Czechoslovak officer was
seriously wounded and several
houses were fired as the Hungar
ian? steadfastly held their ground
against the invaders.
Starting wilit an eight-hour bat
tle Friday at the little village of
Dovhe, the fighting continued
Saturday and yesterday. So far,
no move toward settlement of the
difficulties has been made by
either Hungarian or Czechoslovak
government officials. The fighting
may still be going on this very
minute.

IN WASHINGTON today anti-
New Deal Democrats are still
smarting as a result of President
Roosevelt's polite invitation that
they quit the party in his Jackson
Day dinner speech last Saturday.
Conservative Democrats, infuriated
by the President's declaration that
the party must remain liberal and
his suggestion that anybody who
thinks it should be a "Democratic
Tweedledum to a Republican
Twecdlcdce" should take a walk,
are expected to intensif riiu'; en
large the Congressional opposition
to New Deal measures in the cur
rent session.
JN CONGRESS this week, pro-
Roosevelt and anti-Roosevelt
members are girding their loins for
the big fight over relic, appropria
tions, amounting to a little less than
nine million dollars, request ' by
the President to maintain the /PA.
The New Deal expects a vic
tory in the House because repre
sentatives fear that a vote against
relief may mark them for defeat
in the elections two years from
now. However, in the Senate only
one-third of the members will be
up for election in 1940, and the
administration can't be so sure
of success in that department.

TIIE National Labor Relations
1 Board, in a report tcf the Presi
dent and Ihe Congress, predicted
peace in the divided ranks of or
ganized labor in 1939, Tom Mooney,
released after a 20-year term in
San Quentin and welcomed back to
San Francisco yesterday, was made
the symbol in" a new united labor
movement.
AFL and CIO, joining hands for
the moment, gave Mooney their ben
ediction, dubbed him "the labor
martyr," and declared him the
patron saint of a new movement to
patch up the differences that have
split American labor into two camps
for many month past.
Certain aspects of the home
coming ceremony in San Fran
cisco's Civic Center, attended by
50,000 labor-sympathizers and
curious crowd-lovers, resembled
the Place de la Revolution in
Paris during the French Revolu
tion. Absent were the guillotine
and the knitting citizcncsscs, but
present was Tom Mooney to play
the Godcss of Reason.
Whether Mooney will prove as
much an empty symbol of the la
bor movement as Miss Reason was
of the cause of the sans-culottes is
a question. It would be a shame to
see all the men who used to spend
their time collecting money for a
new trial for Mooney go hungry.

| NSURGENT General Franco got
a set-back yesterday when Loyal
ist troops made advances in south
western Spain, capturing what they
have reported as "eight towns and
thousands of prisoners." The gov
ernment gains bring the Leftist
troops within artillery range of the
main railroad line connecting Se
ville with northern Insurgent Spain.
Loyalist successes in the drive
toward I'ortugstl were repeated
yesterday in Estramadure, south
west of Madrid, where Franco's
reinforcements were unable to
check the drive of government
lriM»|is, rehabilitated at the instant
when final defeat seemed almost
inevitable.

TIIE National Labor Relations
1 Board, in a report tcf the Presi
dent and Ihe Congress, predicted
peace in the divided ranks of or
ganized labor in 1939, Tom Mooney,
released after a 20-year term in
San Quentin and welcomed back to
San Francisco yesterday, was made
the symbol in" a new united labor
movement.
AFL and CIO, joining hands for
the moment, gave Mooney their ben
ediction, dubbed him "the labor
martyr," and declared him the
patron saint of a new movement to
patch up the differences that have
split American labor into two camps
for many month past.
Certain aspects of the home
coming ceremony in San Fran
cisco's Civic Center, attended by
50,000 labor-sympathizers and
curious crowd-lovers, resembled
the Place de la Revolution in
Paris during the French Revolu
tion. Absent were the guillotine
and the knitting citizcncsscs, but
present was Tom Mooney to play
the Godcss of Reason.
Whether Mooney will prove as
much an empty symbol of the la
bor movement as Miss Reason was
of the cause of the sans-culottes is
a question. It would be a shame to
see all the men who used to spend
their time collecting money for a
new trial for Mooney go hungry.

| NSURGENT General Franco got
a set-back yesterday when Loyal
ist troops made advances in south
western Spain, capturing what they
have reported as "eight towns and
thousands of prisoners." The gov
ernment gains bring the Leftist
troops within artillery range of the
main railroad line connecting Se
ville with northern Insurgent Spain.
Loyalist successes in the drive
toward I'ortugstl were repeated
yesterday in Estramadure, south
west of Madrid, where Franco's
reinforcements were unable to
check the drive of government
lriM»|is, rehabilitated at the instant
when final defeat seemed almost
inevitable.
I IKE the? first week-end of the
J quarter at Stanford, disturbed
only by the sound of roller skates,
the world has been comparatively
quiet during the past few days. At
a time when sensational develop
ments in world a flairs are the usual
tiling, it is somewhat surprising to
view 48 hours marked only by the
lengthening shadow of Adolph Hit
ler in eastern Europe and the
homecoming of Tom Mooney.
Germany's designs on the great
wheat-producuig lands of the
Ukraine, Hungary and Roumania
grow continually more apparent as
border clashes arc taking place be
tween Hungary and Carpatho-
Ukraine, easternmost province of
Czechoslovakia. In a Reich using
all its resources in the production
of armaments, the food supply is
bound to run low eventually.
Adolph Hitler knows this, and
lie knows that someday he is go
ing to have to do something about
it. So he is keeping his eye on
that logical source of a future Ger
man food supply, the bread basket
of eastern Europe.
It. is generally agreed that the
little border unpleasantries cur
rently taking place were instigated
by Czech troops upon the timely
suggestion and encouragement of
German officials. In the two en
gagements which took place yes
terday, a Czechoslovak officer was
seriously wounded and several
houses were fired as the Hungar
ian? steadfastly held their ground
against the invaders.
Starting wilit an eight-hour bat
tle Friday at the little village of
Dovhe, the fighting continued
Saturday and yesterday. So far,
no move toward settlement of the
difficulties has been made by
either Hungarian or Czechoslovak
government officials. The fighting
may still be going on this very
minute.

IN WASHINGTON today anti-
New Deal Democrats are still
smarting as a result of President
Roosevelt's polite invitation that
they quit the party in his Jackson
Day dinner speech last Saturday.
Conservative Democrats, infuriated
by the President's declaration that
the party must remain liberal and
his suggestion that anybody who
thinks it should be a "Democratic
Tweedledum to a Republican
Twecdlcdce" should take a walk,
are expected to intensif riiu'; en
large the Congressional opposition
to New Deal measures in the cur

JN CONGRESS this week, pro-
Roosevelt and anti-Roosevelt
members are girding their loins for
the big fight over relic, appropria
tions, amounting to a little less than
nine million dollars, request ' by
the President to maintain the /PA.
The New Deal expects a vic
tory in the House because repre
sentatives fear that a vote against
relief may mark them for defeat
in the elections two years from
now. However, in the Senate only
one-third of the members will be

Czechoslovakia. In a Reich using
all its resources in the production
of armaments, the food supply is
bound to run low eventually.
Adolph Hitler knows this, and
lie knows that someday he is go
ing to have to do something about
it. So he is keeping his eye on
that logical source of a future Ger
man food supply, the bread basket
of eastern Europe.
It. is generally agreed that the
little border unpleasantries cur
rently taking place were instigated
by Czech troops upon the timely
suggestion and encouragement of
German officials. In the two en
gagements which took place yes
terday, a Czechoslovak officer was
seriously wounded and several
houses were fired as the Hungar
ian? steadfastly held their ground
against the invaders.
Starting wilit an eight-hour bat
tle Friday at the little village of
Dovhe, the fighting continued
Saturday and yesterday. So far,
no move toward settlement of the
difficulties has been made by
either Hungarian or Czechoslovak
government officials. The fighting
may still be going on this very
minute.

IN WASHINGTON today anti-
New Deal Democrats are still
smarting as a result of President
Roosevelt's polite invitation that
they quit the party in his Jackson
Day dinner speech last Saturday.
Conservative Democrats, infuriated
by the President's declaration that
the party must remain liberal and
his suggestion that anybody who
thinks it should be a "Democratic
Tweedledum to a Republican
Twecdlcdce" should take a walk,
are expected to intensif riiu'; en
large the Congressional opposition
to New Deal measures in the cur
rent session.
JN CONGRESS this week, pro-
Roosevelt and anti-Roosevelt
members are girding their loins for
the big fight over relic, appropria
tions, amounting to a little less than
nine million dollars, request ' by
the President to maintain the /PA.
The New Deal expects a vic
tory in the House because repre
sentatives fear that a vote against
relief may mark them for defeat
in the elections two years from
now. However, in the Senate only
one-third of the members will be
up for election in 1940, and the
administration can't be so sure
of success in that department.

1 Board, in a report tcf the Presi
dent and Ihe Congress, predicted
peace in the divided ranks of or
ganized labor in 1939, Tom Mooney,
released after a 20-year term in
San Quentin and welcomed back to
San Francisco yesterday, was made
the symbol in" a new united labor
movement.
AFL and CIO, joining hands for
the moment, gave Mooney their ben
ediction, dubbed him "the labor
martyr," and declared him the
patron saint of a new movement to
patch up the differences that have
split American labor into two camps
for many month past.
Certain aspects of the home
coming ceremony in San Fran
cisco's Civic Center, attended by
50,000 labor-sympathizers and
curious crowd-lovers, resembled
the Place de la Revolution in
Paris during the French Revolu
tion. Absent were the guillotine
and the knitting citizcncsscs, but
present was Tom Mooney to play
the Godcss of Reason.
Whether Mooney will prove as
much an empty symbol of the la
bor movement as Miss Reason was
of the cause of the sans-culottes is
a question. It would be a shame to
see all the men who used to spend
their time collecting money for a
new trial for Mooney go hungry.

| NSURGENT General Franco got
a set-back yesterday when Loyal
ist troops made advances in south
western Spain, capturing what they
have reported as "eight towns and
thousands of prisoners." The gov
ernment gains bring the Leftist
troops within artillery range of the
main railroad line connecting Se
ville with northern Insurgent Spain.
Loyalist successes in the drive
toward I'ortugstl were repeated
yesterday in Estramadure, south
west of Madrid, where Franco's
reinforcements were unable to
check the drive of government
lriM»|is, rehabilitated at the instant
when final defeat seemed almost
inevitable.
I IKE the? first week-end of the
J quarter at Stanford, disturbed
only by the sound of roller skates,
the world has been comparatively
quiet during the past few days. At
a time when sensational develop
ments in world a flairs are the usual
tiling, it is somewhat surprising to
view 48 hours marked only by the
lengthening shadow of Adolph Hit
ler in eastern Europe and the
homecoming of Tom Mooney.
Germany's designs on the great
wheat-producuig lands of the
Ukraine, Hungary and Roumania
grow continually more apparent as
border clashes arc taking place be

Ukraine, easternmost province of
