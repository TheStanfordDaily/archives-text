# SHALL SORORITIES STAY? Women Speak for Themselves
## 
### BETTY KLINE 
(The following survey of Stanford women on
the j.orority question was made independently for
work in Sociology by the author and was sub
mitted for publication only long after its comple
tion. Because the survey and the conclusions
which are drawn from it are handled with ad
mirable impartiality, and because of the general
interest which such a survey should have at the
present time, The Daily prints an abstract of its
material.
It is the first of a series of articles on this ques
tion; tomorrow both sides of the problem will be
discussed from interviews with Dean Mary Yost
and members of Pan-Hellenic Council.)

"WOROniTY life," wrote a Stanford sorority woman
last spring, "is living in a house with a bunch of
women your own age. Most of them you like; a few
you don't, but that makes it ail the more interesting.
You study with them, play with them, borrow their
finger-nail polish and go on double-dates with them;
you have a swell time."
"Life in the halls I can tell you about too," she con
cluded. "I lived in Roble for a year. You go on dates
and borrow finger-nail polish there too. There's not.
so much difference, but it's all good fun." '
LIVING GROUPS SATISFACTORY
To determine the actual attitude of women on
campus towards the sorority situation, a short sur
vey was conducted last spring. The most striking
revelation of the survey is that the majority of Stan
ford women are happy as they arc. From a total of
300 questionnaires proportionately distributed in every
women's residence, only 12 out of 90 Hall women felt
they would be any happier in other types of resi
dences.
Conversely, five sorority women believed that they
would prefer large or small residence units to life on
the Row. However, among the 12 Hall women above,
half preferred sororities, three large units, and three
small ones. These, and other questions, were an
swered anonymously.
Points pro and con regarding sororities were dis
cussed at length in the questionnaires. One sorority
woman stated that they best foster the development of
certain individuals, and that more personal interest is
taken in a sorority woman by her sisters than by
fellow residents in a dormitory. She declared that
sorority life gave the individual encouragement in
scholarship and activities and valuable training in
social entertaining.
A few sorority women felt, that "encouragement"
amounted to "pushing" in scholarship and to "mo
nopoly" in activities, while social entertaining at a
certain point stretched into burdensome obligation
rather than valuable training.
CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT PRAISED
Some women commented on the excellent spirit of
co-operation for the benefit of the organization, while
a few felt that this spirit, amounted to stifling of indi
vidual initiative and independence.
Opinion in the halls was likewise divided. Most
women wrote of their enjoyment of a congenial liv
ing group along with the benefits of personal inde
pendence, more time of their own, and a circle of
acquaintances unlimited in any way. Those who pre
ferred a smaller and more intimate group of friends
felt, that the benefits of a residence unit, such as Elm

or Mariposa duplicated those of a sorority without
the accompanying obligations of amiual rushing or
house duties.
A few felt that they would be happier in a sorority
because of the security and backing of their own so
cial group, because of the closeness and intimacy, or
because of the homelike atmosphere.
But since statistics definitely showed a majority of
Stanford women happy as they are, the conclusion may
be safely reached that Row and Hall are alike in pro
viding benefits of a congenial living group. In many
eases, Hall and Row women alike considered the
sorority system of invitational pledging the chief dif
ference between the two".
As might be expected, a majority of Row women
voted overwhelmingly to retain sororities, while the
majority of Hall women voted to abolish them.
Speaking for abolition, one sorority woman said,
"There are too many people who attach undue im
portance to sororities who haven't had the cxpericncc
of living in them." On the same side, one Roble
sponsor wrote, "On a comparatively small campus
like Stanford, I can see no reason for further dis
crimination or segregation."
Feeling on the Row was far more pro-sorority than
feeling in the Halls was anti-sorority. Sorority women
showed more interest, also, in returning the ques
tionnaires. Of 88 distributed on the Row, 71 were re
turned; of 200 distributed in the Halls, only 92 were
returned. Since smaller units such as Manzanita or
Hawthorne returned the questionnaires in a much
larger percentage than did Lagunita or Union, the high
er Row and small unit returns may be due to greater
spirit of co-operation to be found in the closer-knit
groups.
PLEDGING IS PERSONAL AFFAIR
Main conclusion of the survey is that, pledging and
sororities are a personal matter, variable with the
individual. For certain women the more intimate and
helpful—if narrower—attitude in a sorority was rec
ommended, while for others it was rated equally un
desirable. One common complaint found in the sur
vey was that, at Stanford the sororities find room only
for the already poised and mature type of woman
while those who would benefit by development, in such
a group are often left to themselves.
Another point, brought, out most strongly is that the
greatest evil of sororities is the undue importance which
is attached to them.
"If the problem of living in a house with 25 women
and a Greek name, or a Hall with 25 women without
a Greek name is going to mean the making or break
ing of some individuals," wrote one sorority woman,
"then something should surely be done, either about
the individuals or the Greek names."
ANTI-ROW TREND SEEN
That increase in the number of sororities would
be only a temporary relief measure is believed by
many who point out the complete anti-Row trend
represented by the Roble rebellion last year and by
the recent abandonment of sororities in Eastern uni
versities. That this, tr<>nd has spread to (lie West coast
is shown in the set-ups of such newer universities as
Pomona, where all students are housed in large or
small residence units.
But if Greek letters actually add as little to the
sum of happiness at. Stanford as the survey would
show, it is probable that sororities will eventually go
from the campus. If sororities do ofTer advantages
over university-run dormitories, many women then
maintain they should be continued.
(The following survey of Stanford women on
the j.orority question was made independently for

But if Greek letters actually add as little to the
sum of happiness at. Stanford as the survey would
show, it is probable that sororities will eventually go
from the campus. If sororities do ofTer advantages
over university-run dormitories, many women then
maintain they should be continued.

the j.orority question was made independently for

"WOROniTY life," wrote a Stanford sorority woman
last spring, "is living in a house with a bunch of
women your own age. Most of them you like; a few
you don't, but that makes it ail the more interesting.
You study with them, play with them, borrow their
finger-nail polish and go on double-dates with them;
you have a swell time."
"Life in the halls I can tell you about too," she con
cluded. "I lived in Roble for a year. You go on dates
and borrow finger-nail polish there too. There's not.
so much difference, but it's all good fun." '
LIVING GROUPS SATISFACTORY
To determine the actual attitude of women on
campus towards the sorority situation, a short sur
vey was conducted last spring. The most striking
revelation of the survey is that the majority of Stan
ford women are happy as they arc. From a total of
300 questionnaires proportionately distributed in every
women's residence, only 12 out of 90 Hall women felt
they would be any happier in other types of resi
dences.
Conversely, five sorority women believed that they
would prefer large or small residence units to life on
the Row. However, among the 12 Hall women above,
half preferred sororities, three large units, and three
small ones. These, and other questions, were an
swered anonymously.
Points pro and con regarding sororities were dis
cussed at length in the questionnaires. One sorority
woman stated that they best foster the development of
certain individuals, and that more personal interest is
taken in a sorority woman by her sisters than by
fellow residents in a dormitory. She declared that
sorority life gave the individual encouragement in
scholarship and activities and valuable training in
social entertaining.
A few sorority women felt, that "encouragement"
amounted to "pushing" in scholarship and to "mo
nopoly" in activities, while social entertaining at a
certain point stretched into burdensome obligation
rather than valuable training.
CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT PRAISED
Some women commented on the excellent spirit of
co-operation for the benefit of the organization, while
a few felt that this spirit, amounted to stifling of indi
vidual initiative and independence.
Opinion in the halls was likewise divided. Most
women wrote of their enjoyment of a congenial liv
ing group along with the benefits of personal inde
pendence, more time of their own, and a circle of
acquaintances unlimited in any way. Those who pre
ferred a smaller and more intimate group of friends
felt, that the benefits of a residence unit, such as Elm

or Mariposa duplicated those of a sorority without
the accompanying obligations of amiual rushing or
house duties.
A few felt that they would be happier in a sorority
because of the security and backing of their own so
cial group, because of the closeness and intimacy, or
because of the homelike atmosphere.
But since statistics definitely showed a majority of
Stanford women happy as they are, the conclusion may
be safely reached that Row and Hall are alike in pro
viding benefits of a congenial living group. In many
eases, Hall and Row women alike considered the
sorority system of invitational pledging the chief dif
ference between the two".
As might be expected, a majority of Row women
voted overwhelmingly to retain sororities, while the
majority of Hall women voted to abolish them.
Speaking for abolition, one sorority woman said,
"There are too many people who attach undue im
portance to sororities who haven't had the cxpericncc
of living in them." On the same side, one Roble
sponsor wrote, "On a comparatively small campus
like Stanford, I can see no reason for further dis
crimination or segregation."
Feeling on the Row was far more pro-sorority than
feeling in the Halls was anti-sorority. Sorority women
showed more interest, also, in returning the ques
tionnaires. Of 88 distributed on the Row, 71 were re
turned; of 200 distributed in the Halls, only 92 were
returned. Since smaller units such as Manzanita or
Hawthorne returned the questionnaires in a much
larger percentage than did Lagunita or Union, the high
er Row and small unit returns may be due to greater
spirit of co-operation to be found in the closer-knit
groups.
PLEDGING IS PERSONAL AFFAIR
Main conclusion of the survey is that, pledging and
sororities are a personal matter, variable with the
individual. For certain women the more intimate and
helpful—if narrower—attitude in a sorority was rec
ommended, while for others it was rated equally un
desirable. One common complaint found in the sur
vey was that, at Stanford the sororities find room only
for the already poised and mature type of woman
while those who would benefit by development, in such
a group are often left to themselves.
Another point, brought, out most strongly is that the
greatest evil of sororities is the undue importance which
is attached to them.
"If the problem of living in a house with 25 women
and a Greek name, or a Hall with 25 women without
a Greek name is going to mean the making or break
ing of some individuals," wrote one sorority woman,
"then something should surely be done, either about
the individuals or the Greek names."
ANTI-ROW TREND SEEN
That increase in the number of sororities would
be only a temporary relief measure is believed by
many who point out the complete anti-Row trend
represented by the Roble rebellion last year and by
the recent abandonment of sororities in Eastern uni
versities. That this, tr<>nd has spread to (lie West coast
is shown in the set-ups of such newer universities as
Pomona, where all students are housed in large or
small residence units.
But if Greek letters actually add as little to the
sum of happiness at. Stanford as the survey would
show, it is probable that sororities will eventually go

"WOROniTY life," wrote a Stanford sorority woman
last spring, "is living in a house with a bunch of
women your own age. Most of them you like; a few
you don't, but that makes it ail the more interesting.
You study with them, play with them, borrow their
finger-nail polish and go on double-dates with them;
you have a swell time."
"Life in the halls I can tell you about too," she con
cluded. "I lived in Roble for a year. You go on dates
and borrow finger-nail polish there too. There's not.
so much difference, but it's all good fun." '
LIVING GROUPS SATISFACTORY
To determine the actual attitude of women on
campus towards the sorority situation, a short sur
vey was conducted last spring. The most striking
revelation of the survey is that the majority of Stan
ford women are happy as they arc. From a total of
300 questionnaires proportionately distributed in every
women's residence, only 12 out of 90 Hall women felt
they would be any happier in other types of resi
dences.
Conversely, five sorority women believed that they
would prefer large or small residence units to life on
the Row. However, among the 12 Hall women above,
half preferred sororities, three large units, and three
small ones. These, and other questions, were an
swered anonymously.
Points pro and con regarding sororities were dis
cussed at length in the questionnaires. One sorority
woman stated that they best foster the development of
certain individuals, and that more personal interest is
taken in a sorority woman by her sisters than by
fellow residents in a dormitory. She declared that
sorority life gave the individual encouragement in
scholarship and activities and valuable training in
social entertaining.
A few sorority women felt, that "encouragement"
amounted to "pushing" in scholarship and to "mo
nopoly" in activities, while social entertaining at a
certain point stretched into burdensome obligation
rather than valuable training.
CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT PRAISED
Some women commented on the excellent spirit of
co-operation for the benefit of the organization, while
a few felt that this spirit, amounted to stifling of indi
vidual initiative and independence.
Opinion in the halls was likewise divided. Most
women wrote of their enjoyment of a congenial liv
ing group along with the benefits of personal inde
pendence, more time of their own, and a circle of
acquaintances unlimited in any way. Those who pre
ferred a smaller and more intimate group of friends
felt, that the benefits of a residence unit, such as Elm

or Mariposa duplicated those of a sorority without
the accompanying obligations of amiual rushing or
house duties.
A few felt that they would be happier in a sorority
because of the security and backing of their own so
cial group, because of the closeness and intimacy, or
because of the homelike atmosphere.
But since statistics definitely showed a majority of
Stanford women happy as they are, the conclusion may
be safely reached that Row and Hall are alike in pro
viding benefits of a congenial living group. In many
eases, Hall and Row women alike considered the
sorority system of invitational pledging the chief dif
ference between the two".
As might be expected, a majority of Row women
voted overwhelmingly to retain sororities, while the
majority of Hall women voted to abolish them.
Speaking for abolition, one sorority woman said,
"There are too many people who attach undue im
portance to sororities who haven't had the cxpericncc
of living in them." On the same side, one Roble
sponsor wrote, "On a comparatively small campus
like Stanford, I can see no reason for further dis
crimination or segregation."
Feeling on the Row was far more pro-sorority than
feeling in the Halls was anti-sorority. Sorority women
showed more interest, also, in returning the ques
tionnaires. Of 88 distributed on the Row, 71 were re
turned; of 200 distributed in the Halls, only 92 were
returned. Since smaller units such as Manzanita or
Hawthorne returned the questionnaires in a much
larger percentage than did Lagunita or Union, the high
er Row and small unit returns may be due to greater
spirit of co-operation to be found in the closer-knit
groups.
PLEDGING IS PERSONAL AFFAIR
Main conclusion of the survey is that, pledging and
sororities are a personal matter, variable with the
individual. For certain women the more intimate and
helpful—if narrower—attitude in a sorority was rec
ommended, while for others it was rated equally un
desirable. One common complaint found in the sur
vey was that, at Stanford the sororities find room only
for the already poised and mature type of woman
while those who would benefit by development, in such
a group are often left to themselves.
Another point, brought, out most strongly is that the
greatest evil of sororities is the undue importance which
is attached to them.
"If the problem of living in a house with 25 women
and a Greek name, or a Hall with 25 women without
a Greek name is going to mean the making or break
ing of some individuals," wrote one sorority woman,
"then something should surely be done, either about
the individuals or the Greek names."
ANTI-ROW TREND SEEN
That increase in the number of sororities would
be only a temporary relief measure is believed by
many who point out the complete anti-Row trend
represented by the Roble rebellion last year and by
the recent abandonment of sororities in Eastern uni
versities. That this, tr<>nd has spread to (lie West coast
is shown in the set-ups of such newer universities as
Pomona, where all students are housed in large or
small residence units.
But if Greek letters actually add as little to the

the individuals or the Greek names."
ANTI-ROW TREND SEEN
That increase in the number of sororities would
be only a temporary relief measure is believed by
many who point out the complete anti-Row trend
represented by the Roble rebellion last year and by
the recent abandonment of sororities in Eastern uni
versities. That this, tr<>nd has spread to (lie West coast
is shown in the set-ups of such newer universities as
Pomona, where all students are housed in large or
small residence units.
But if Greek letters actually add as little to the
sum of happiness at. Stanford as the survey would
show, it is probable that sororities will eventually go
from the campus. If sororities do ofTer advantages
over university-run dormitories, many women then
maintain they should be continued.
(The following survey of Stanford women on
the j.orority question was made independently for
work in Sociology by the author and was sub
mitted for publication only long after its comple
tion. Because the survey and the conclusions
which are drawn from it are handled with ad
mirable impartiality, and because of the general
interest which such a survey should have at the
present time, The Daily prints an abstract of its
material.
It is the first of a series of articles on this ques
tion; tomorrow both sides of the problem will be
discussed from interviews with Dean Mary Yost
and members of Pan-Hellenic Council.)

"WOROniTY life," wrote a Stanford sorority woman
last spring, "is living in a house with a bunch of
women your own age. Most of them you like; a few
you don't, but that makes it ail the more interesting.
You study with them, play with them, borrow their
finger-nail polish and go on double-dates with them;
you have a swell time."
"Life in the halls I can tell you about too," she con
cluded. "I lived in Roble for a year. You go on dates
and borrow finger-nail polish there too. There's not.
so much difference, but it's all good fun." '
LIVING GROUPS SATISFACTORY
To determine the actual attitude of women on
campus towards the sorority situation, a short sur
vey was conducted last spring. The most striking
revelation of the survey is that the majority of Stan
ford women are happy as they arc. From a total of
300 questionnaires proportionately distributed in every
women's residence, only 12 out of 90 Hall women felt
they would be any happier in other types of resi
dences.
Conversely, five sorority women believed that they
would prefer large or small residence units to life on
the Row. However, among the 12 Hall women above,
half preferred sororities, three large units, and three
small ones. These, and other questions, were an
swered anonymously.
Points pro and con regarding sororities were dis
cussed at length in the questionnaires. One sorority
woman stated that they best foster the development of
certain individuals, and that more personal interest is
taken in a sorority woman by her sisters than by
fellow residents in a dormitory. She declared that
sorority life gave the individual encouragement in
scholarship and activities and valuable training in
social entertaining.
A few sorority women felt, that "encouragement"
amounted to "pushing" in scholarship and to "mo
nopoly" in activities, while social entertaining at a
certain point stretched into burdensome obligation
rather than valuable training.
CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT PRAISED
Some women commented on the excellent spirit of
co-operation for the benefit of the organization, while
a few felt that this spirit, amounted to stifling of indi
vidual initiative and independence.
Opinion in the halls was likewise divided. Most
women wrote of their enjoyment of a congenial liv
ing group along with the benefits of personal inde
pendence, more time of their own, and a circle of
acquaintances unlimited in any way. Those who pre
ferred a smaller and more intimate group of friends
felt, that the benefits of a residence unit, such as Elm

or Mariposa duplicated those of a sorority without
the accompanying obligations of amiual rushing or
house duties.
A few felt that they would be happier in a sorority
because of the security and backing of their own so
cial group, because of the closeness and intimacy, or
because of the homelike atmosphere.
But since statistics definitely showed a majority of
Stanford women happy as they are, the conclusion may
be safely reached that Row and Hall are alike in pro
viding benefits of a congenial living group. In many
eases, Hall and Row women alike considered the
sorority system of invitational pledging the chief dif
ference between the two".
As might be expected, a majority of Row women
voted overwhelmingly to retain sororities, while the
majority of Hall women voted to abolish them.
Speaking for abolition, one sorority woman said,
"There are too many people who attach undue im
portance to sororities who haven't had the cxpericncc
of living in them." On the same side, one Roble
sponsor wrote, "On a comparatively small campus
like Stanford, I can see no reason for further dis
crimination or segregation."
Feeling on the Row was far more pro-sorority than
feeling in the Halls was anti-sorority. Sorority women
showed more interest, also, in returning the ques
tionnaires. Of 88 distributed on the Row, 71 were re
turned; of 200 distributed in the Halls, only 92 were
returned. Since smaller units such as Manzanita or
Hawthorne returned the questionnaires in a much
larger percentage than did Lagunita or Union, the high
er Row and small unit returns may be due to greater
spirit of co-operation to be found in the closer-knit
groups.
PLEDGING IS PERSONAL AFFAIR
Main conclusion of the survey is that, pledging and
sororities are a personal matter, variable with the
individual. For certain women the more intimate and
helpful—if narrower—attitude in a sorority was rec
ommended, while for others it was rated equally un
desirable. One common complaint found in the sur
vey was that, at Stanford the sororities find room only
for the already poised and mature type of woman
while those who would benefit by development, in such
a group are often left to themselves.
Another point, brought, out most strongly is that the
greatest evil of sororities is the undue importance which
is attached to them.
"If the problem of living in a house with 25 women
and a Greek name, or a Hall with 25 women without
a Greek name is going to mean the making or break
ing of some individuals," wrote one sorority woman,
"then something should surely be done, either about
the individuals or the Greek names."
ANTI-ROW TREND SEEN
That increase in the number of sororities would
be only a temporary relief measure is believed by
many who point out the complete anti-Row trend
represented by the Roble rebellion last year and by
the recent abandonment of sororities in Eastern uni
versities. That this, tr<>nd has spread to (lie West coast
is shown in the set-ups of such newer universities as
Pomona, where all students are housed in large or
small residence units.
But if Greek letters actually add as little to the
sum of happiness at. Stanford as the survey would
show, it is probable that sororities will eventually go
from the campus. If sororities do ofTer advantages
over university-run dormitories, many women then
maintain they should be continued.
