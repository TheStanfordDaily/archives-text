# 'Loyalists Can Triumph— If Aided,' Says Volunteer
## 
### OLIVER WYMAN 
Newspapers throughout the country since the beginning of the Spanish
Civil War have emphasized Franco's success with the Insurgents, that
the government under the banner of the Loyalists ever had or ever
will have an opening for victory is seldom thought of, and the current
of opinion is: that Democracy is doomed in Spain.

Nevertheless, in this count ry,<
Mexico, the U.S.S.R., and others,!
men and women gather with the i
one idea in mind: "that Fascism can j
be beaten." It was at one of these
meetings on (lie waterfront in San
Francisco that this reporter met
several Americans who had just re
turned from the Loyalist trenches I
on the Spanish front.
AUDIENCE ENTHUSIASTIC
To see and hear the eleven who
had formed part of the Abraham |
Lincoln International Brigade were j
several hundred, among them fath- ;
ers and mothers, friends and sweet- !
hearts of those who had volunteered j
"for the cause." And some of them j
will never come back.
When Archie Brown, 32-year-old
longshoreman and veteran of seven j
months, had completed his news j
and comments on the struggle, lie |
called for donations to the fund be- |
ing raised "to help our comrades j
who have been wounded, and assist >
others not yet out of Spain." (An
attempt is now being made to clear j
I hat state of all foreign troops.)
Tremendous enthusiasm was regis- !
tered by the crowd, most of whom
were sailors, longshoremen, and
teamsters, and as much as ten and \
twenty dollars can?\e from some !
pockets to swell the collection.
LOYALISTS NEED FOOD
"If the arms embargo were re- j
moved, and Loyalist Spain could get i
food and arms from this country, |
the trend of the strife would quickly i
change." So spoke Dave Thompson,
once Broadway man for Life maga
zine, and now one of the leaders in |
this country to raise funds for re- I
turning veterans. He is also a cous- I
in of the author, Kathleen Norris.
"I served for 19 months," he con- I
tinned, "and all of us who have been |
obliged to return are only sorry we ;
are out of the trenches."
In comparing the spirit of the op- j
posing forces Mr. Thompson made
it clear that a large part of the In- »
01 rue is wc'i' **c , ns ,, *''ple'l. tnd

forced to fight, for the Fascists,
while the Loyalists were a united
body "determined to fight to the last
man."
UNREST UNDER FRANCO
Asked how long the war might
continue, Ihe tall 30-year-old leader
replied, "Given the same support
Franco's men receive from outside
sources, the Loyalists can win in
about a year."
Archie Brown, who led a company
of infantry in the Ebro campaign,
added to this, saying, "There is a
growing feeling of unrest, among
parts of Franco's forces; many arc
beginning to realize that he is not
their man. This will ultimately
bring added strength to the gov
ernment troops.
And so ended an interview illus
trating a spirit that may mean the
ultimate defeat of the Rebel forces.
