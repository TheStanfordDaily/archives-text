SUPPLY SHIP, above, passing Anking on the Yangtze river, China, is loaded with food for the Japanese
fighting men. All supply and transport ships of this kind are heavily guarded against attacks of Chinese
guerilla hands ashore. The Japanese in the foreground are ready to return the fire of the enemy, as the
ship moves up the river.
