# CAMPUS OPINION
## SORORITIES UNFAIR 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Congratulations on your editorial
marking "the docile Robleites who
pledge" as "casting their lot with a
dying system." You have hit the
nail on the head—so far as the
sorority system on the Stanford
campus is concerned.
There is one point I would like to
make which I think has been over
looked in most previous discussions
of the sorority question.
Today, the people of the United
States have retained their ideals of
life, liberty, and property which
have been imbedded in the rock on
which this country was founded.
Democracy is an ideal that every
true American must cherish. It is
an ideal that was a part of the phi
losophy of Leland Stanford when he
founded this university.
But, it seems to me that today
the sorority system on the Stanford
campus has become an insidious
moss slowly splitting the rock upon
which this country and this uni
versity were founded. Can an in
stitution whose membership is lim
ited by financial and even religious
restrictions be truly democratic?
That is the question that comes
to my mind. Would not Stanford
University be demonstrating its
true democratic spirit by abolishing
the sorority system now? Each
year there is a reoccurrence of ill
feeling and unhappiness in Roble
and the sororities on the Row. Re
ports indicate that this year will be
no exception.
My plea is that the sororities
themselves take the initiative to al
leviate the distress that is inevitable
each year; that the sororities dem
onstrate for themselves and Stan
ford University that democracy is
not dead but a vital part of this
campus.
