# Exhibit Shows State Scenes
## Art Gallery Displays Water Color Views 
### 
Most unusual exhibit to be shown j
at the Stanford Art Gallery in the i
last few months is the collection of !
water-colors by Miss Gordena'
Parker Jackson, which is currently
being displayed.
The exhibit is composed of 41 viv
idly colored landscapes, typical of
the coast range. Included are
mountain, water, and ranch scenes
familiar to inhabitants of Northern
California.
Miss Jackson's water-colors are
unique in that she employs a tech- j
nique that is different from the usual
water-color technique. She uses
color rather "dry," mixing on the
paper by applying one color over;
another. The effect that is produced
singles her work into a class of its
own.
Although Miss Jackson does oil
paintings and black and white draw
ings, she likes best to work in water
colors. This Berkeley artist has had
her work exhibited in most of the
best known galleries and exhibitions
in Northern California.
Miss Jackson's collection will be
on exhibit at the Stanford Art Gal
lery until January 15. The gallery is
open to the public, admission free,
from 10 o'clock to 5 o'clock daily.
