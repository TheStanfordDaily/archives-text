# Fad Hits Farm; Skaters Careen Through Campus

Some say it was started by the Betas and the Pi Phis, some say it was
|)ickcd up from southern California high school kids over Christmas
vacation, but cloudy as the origin may be the result is obvious: parts of
Stanford have gone hog-wild on roller skates.
Early Friday afternoon a few people were seen floating around the
campus on skates, and by sun-down their ranks had thickened. The
skaters would zoom down the Row,* __ ...

and the guys and gals looking out
their windows would see them.
And in a little while they would
be out skating themselves.
One store in Palo Alto is reputed
to have sold 150 pairs of skates—
its entire stock, in short. Other
local tradesmen found themselves
suddenly swamped with unexpected
orders for the diminutive four
wheeled buggies.
The cry was going around among
the skaters, "We'll skate to class
Monday morning." It. will be, their
voices said, a picnic.
But Gordy Davis objc •' and is

ikating on tut* Quad. So
Stanford's newest lad is destined to
remain a healthy, if somewhat ju
venile, week-end pastime.
Virtually a Row movement at
present after its one week-end's ex
istence, a few Hall people, mostly
women, have taken their first hesi
tating glides on farm sidewalks.
Is this spring quarter?
