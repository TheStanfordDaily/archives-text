# Gaels, Broncs Sneak Narrow Wins
## card Cagers Drop Games 51-47, 37-34 Zonne Hits Scoring Form, But Hoopsters Shaky on Defense 
### JERRY MAYER 
A very dirty trick was done our
Injuns last week-end when a swirl
ing Gael and a wicked Bronco qui
etly sneaked on respective nights
into the Pavilion to whisk away nar
row victories over Stanford's basket
ball outfit.
St. Mary's invaded the Pavilion
Friday night and walked away with
a 51-47 victory, while the following
evening a smooth, imperturbable
Santa Clara squad wreaked disaster
by a 37-114 score. But despite the
pair of defeats by non-conference
goes, Coach Everett Dean's men
showed that all is not lost as far
as Stanford is concerned this sea
son.
/ONNE SCORES
For one thing, Captain Phil
Zonne finally hit the scoring form
expected of him this season when
he went hog-wild in the second
half of the Bronco game to tank 13
points—which gave him high-point
honors for the evening with a total
of 21 digits. In other words, Zonne
accounted for 61.7 per cent of Stan
ford's 34 points.
Another virtue that the Cards
showed in exceptional quantity was
good old-fashioned bust-'em-up
fight. They may have been out
manned by both foes, they may have
been badly outplayed at times, but
they never stopped driving. Stan
ford played rough in both games,
especially so when one remembers
the smooth excellence of last year's
Card team, but it was that very
drive that brought Stanford close to
victory each night.
DEFENSE MISSES
But. the debit side of the ledger
also had its points. The Deanmen
still can't seem to master their man
to-man defense, and the Gaels and
Broncs were continually breaking
men into the clear for set-ups. Also,
the passing is erratic, especially the
long fioor-length heaves which were
being continually intercepted by the
Gael and Bronc guards.
But perhaps the most serious dif
ficulty is the lack of a consistent
scoring threat in the front line.
Bobby Burnett hits consistently
from the outside, and Lee Lafaille
is a dead-eye on set-shots, but no
one seems to be able to hit the
bucket consistently from close in.
GAELS TAKE LEAD
The St. Mary's game started out
as if it were scheduled to be a
slaughter when the Gaels ran an
early lead to 21-9, but the fighting
Indians came back to narrow the
half-time score to 23-16.
Early in the second half, A1 An
drade, St. Mary's forward, fouled
himself out, crippling the Gael of
fensive severely, as Andrade had
scored 10 points in his short tenure
in the game. Later Joe Noonan,
Gael guard, also fouled out — and
Stanford started rolling.
When Bill Rapp dumped in a
bucket out of a melee under the
Gael basket, the Indians trailed by
only a 46-45 margin with two min
utes to go. But the effort was too
much and the Cards faded in those
last few moments.
BRONCS REPEAT
The Santa Clara game was almost
a repetition of the previous night's
game. The game was five minutes
old before Zonne scored Stanford's
first point with a free throw, and it
wasn't until five minutes after that
that Lafaille brought the score to
11-5 with Stanford's first basket.
The Indians were trailing but 22-18
at the half, and v\men Zonne went
wild during the second Stanford half
once more came into one point of
victory with two minutes to play.
But with the score at 34-33 the In
dians once again couldn't quite come
through.

the team for its opening Conference |
series against U.S.C. this week-end
in the Pavilion.

pair of defeats by non-conference
goes, Coach Everett Dean's men
showed that all is not lost as far
as Stanford is concerned this sea
son.
/ONNE SCORES
For one thing, Captain Phil
Zonne finally hit the scoring form
expected of him this season when
he went hog-wild in the second
half of the Bronco game to tank 13
points—which gave him high-point
honors for the evening with a total
of 21 digits. In other words, Zonne
accounted for 61.7 per cent of Stan
ford's 34 points.
Another virtue that the Cards
showed in exceptional quantity was
good old-fashioned bust-'em-up
fight. They may have been out
manned by both foes, they may have
been badly outplayed at times, but
they never stopped driving. Stan
ford played rough in both games,
especially so when one remembers
the smooth excellence of last year's
Card team, but it was that very
drive that brought Stanford close to
victory each night.
DEFENSE MISSES
But. the debit side of the ledger
also had its points. The Deanmen
still can't seem to master their man
to-man defense, and the Gaels and
Broncs were continually breaking
men into the clear for set-ups. Also,
the passing is erratic, especially the
long fioor-length heaves which were
being continually intercepted by the
Gael and Bronc guards.
But perhaps the most serious dif
ficulty is the lack of a consistent
scoring threat in the front line.
Bobby Burnett hits consistently
from the outside, and Lee Lafaille
is a dead-eye on set-shots, but no
one seems to be able to hit the
bucket consistently from close in.
GAELS TAKE LEAD
The St. Mary's game started out
as if it were scheduled to be a
slaughter when the Gaels ran an
early lead to 21-9, but the fighting
Indians came back to narrow the
half-time score to 23-16.
Early in the second half, A1 An
drade, St. Mary's forward, fouled
himself out, crippling the Gael of
fensive severely, as Andrade had
scored 10 points in his short tenure
in the game. Later Joe Noonan,
Gael guard, also fouled out — and
Stanford started rolling.
When Bill Rapp dumped in a
bucket out of a melee under the
Gael basket, the Indians trailed by
only a 46-45 margin with two min
utes to go. But the effort was too
much and the Cards faded in those
last few moments.
BRONCS REPEAT
The Santa Clara game was almost
a repetition of the previous night's
game. The game was five minutes
old before Zonne scored Stanford's
first point with a free throw, and it
wasn't until five minutes after that
that Lafaille brought the score to
11-5 with Stanford's first basket.
The Indians were trailing but 22-18
at the half, and v\men Zonne went
wild during the second Stanford half
once more came into one point of
victory with two minutes to play.
But with the score at 34-33 the In
dians once again couldn't quite come
through.

showed in exceptional quantity was
good old-fashioned bust-'em-up
fight. They may have been out
manned by both foes, they may have
been badly outplayed at times, but
they never stopped driving. Stan
ford played rough in both games,
especially so when one remembers
the smooth excellence of last year's
Card team, but it was that very
drive that brought Stanford close to
victory each night.
DEFENSE MISSES
But. the debit side of the ledger
also had its points. The Deanmen
still can't seem to master their man
to-man defense, and the Gaels and
Broncs were continually breaking
men into the clear for set-ups. Also,
the passing is erratic, especially the
long fioor-length heaves which were
being continually intercepted by the
Gael and Bronc guards.
But perhaps the most serious dif
ficulty is the lack of a consistent
scoring threat in the front line.
Bobby Burnett hits consistently
from the outside, and Lee Lafaille
is a dead-eye on set-shots, but no
one seems to be able to hit the
bucket consistently from close in.
GAELS TAKE LEAD
The St. Mary's game started out
as if it were scheduled to be a
slaughter when the Gaels ran an
early lead to 21-9, but the fighting
Indians came back to narrow the
half-time score to 23-16.
Early in the second half, A1 An
drade, St. Mary's forward, fouled
himself out, crippling the Gael of
fensive severely, as Andrade had
scored 10 points in his short tenure
in the game. Later Joe Noonan,
Gael guard, also fouled out — and
Stanford started rolling.
When Bill Rapp dumped in a
bucket out of a melee under the
Gael basket, the Indians trailed by
only a 46-45 margin with two min
utes to go. But the effort was too
much and the Cards faded in those
last few moments.
BRONCS REPEAT
The Santa Clara game was almost
a repetition of the previous night's
game. The game was five minutes
old before Zonne scored Stanford's
first point with a free throw, and it
wasn't until five minutes after that
that Lafaille brought the score to
11-5 with Stanford's first basket.
The Indians were trailing but 22-18
at the half, and v\men Zonne went
wild during the second Stanford half
once more came into one point of
victory with two minutes to play.
But with the score at 34-33 the In
dians once again couldn't quite come
through.

series against U.S.C. this week-end

A very dirty trick was done our
Injuns last week-end when a swirl
ing Gael and a wicked Bronco qui
etly sneaked on respective nights
into the Pavilion to whisk away nar
row victories over Stanford's basket
ball outfit.
St. Mary's invaded the Pavilion
Friday night and walked away with
a 51-47 victory, while the following
evening a smooth, imperturbable
Santa Clara squad wreaked disaster
by a 37-114 score. But despite the
pair of defeats by non-conference
goes, Coach Everett Dean's men
showed that all is not lost as far
as Stanford is concerned this sea
son.
/ONNE SCORES
For one thing, Captain Phil
Zonne finally hit the scoring form
expected of him this season when
he went hog-wild in the second
half of the Bronco game to tank 13
points—which gave him high-point
honors for the evening with a total
of 21 digits. In other words, Zonne
accounted for 61.7 per cent of Stan
ford's 34 points.
Another virtue that the Cards
showed in exceptional quantity was
good old-fashioned bust-'em-up
fight. They may have been out
manned by both foes, they may have
been badly outplayed at times, but
they never stopped driving. Stan
ford played rough in both games,
especially so when one remembers
