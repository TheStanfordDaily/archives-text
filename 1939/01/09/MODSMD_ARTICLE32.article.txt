UNLUCKY start, several not
too-serious injuries, a few points
lost by inches, and Stanford foot
ball goes $17,000 into the red.
At first glance, it is hard to con
ceive that football could lose
money, but it is really very sim
ple when you consider what it
has to pay for. Stanford athletic j
income has to go into one big pot
and then l>e dished out to all
sports, even to those that fail to
ante. College sports are neces
sarily run on the Marxian sys
tem—from each according to his
ability and to each according to
his need.
Before he can tell how much can
be spent on sports each year, A1
Masters must predict the future
football income as a basis for ath
letic expenditures. Gate receipts j
this year were slashed by the un- j
fortunate flukes that turned a good i
team into a losing one, and the in
come, of course, did not meet his
expectations. Thus the B.A.C. ex- I
penses, budgeted and spent, could I
not be covered by football gate re- j
ceipts.
Fortunately, last year's income !
was greater than predicted, and the J
'■carry-over was large enough to
meet the deficit. The B.A.C. had '
lost $17,000, but they can still j
the gas bill.
jjc :Jc
It hardly seems appropriate to re
sume our campaign for a track sta
dium when the B.A.C. is dipping its
pen in red ink, but we have seen
that things are not in a state of

bankruptcy over
there. And they
have not com
pletely given up
the idea.
"No action at
X'this time," was
/"the resolution
passed at the i
Board meeting |
Fridav nieht. and

i nuct}' JiigJii, dllLl
track bleacher visions looked dim. |
But the men around the table knew |
that the bleachers would he built i
some time in the near future, de- ■;
pending upon the balancing of the ;
books.
While things are not in the pink
financially, the time does seem
ripe for consideration of track
expenditure, Th" Vowing Sophs '
had their stadium and the Laugh
ing Boys their Pavilion. Stanford
is about to see its greatest track ,
season since Dyer and Eastman
made history in 1932, and if the
Board can possibly see its way !
clear, now is the time.
But the B.A.C. is too big a plant
to be operated from hand to mouth,
and it cannot be expected to spend
its last penny. Stanford can only |
hope that bleachers can be built by
money appropriated in some other
way, perhaps in place of expendi- j
tures already budgeted.
If such an alternative appears, |
and Stanford students are given the
choice after the next B.A.C. meet- I
ing, February 15, it will be their!
chance to promote improved spec- |
tator facilities at Angell Field so!
that students and fans can sit com- J
fortably and watch a fine team
bring home the bacon.

UNLUCKY start, several not

has to pay for. Stanford athletic j
income has to go into one big pot

ability and to each according to
his need.
Before he can tell how much can

football income as a basis for ath

this year were slashed by the un- j
fortunate flukes that turned a good i
team into a losing one, and the in
come, of course, did not meet his

penses, budgeted and spent, could I
not be covered by football gate re- j

Fortunately, last year's income !
was greater than predicted, and the J

UNLUCKY start, several not
too-serious injuries, a few points
lost by inches, and Stanford foot
ball goes $17,000 into the red.
At first glance, it is hard to con
ceive that football could lose
money, but it is really very sim
ple when you consider what it
has to pay for. Stanford athletic j
income has to go into one big pot
and then l>e dished out to all
sports, even to those that fail to
ante. College sports are neces
sarily run on the Marxian sys
tem—from each according to his
ability and to each according to
his need.
Before he can tell how much can
be spent on sports each year, A1
Masters must predict the future
football income as a basis for ath
letic expenditures. Gate receipts j
this year were slashed by the un- j
fortunate flukes that turned a good i
team into a losing one, and the in
come, of course, did not meet his
expectations. Thus the B.A.C. ex- I
penses, budgeted and spent, could I
not be covered by football gate re- j
ceipts.
Fortunately, last year's income !
was greater than predicted, and the J
'■carry-over was large enough to
meet the deficit. The B.A.C. had '
lost $17,000, but they can still j
the gas bill.
jjc :Jc
It hardly seems appropriate to re
sume our campaign for a track sta
dium when the B.A.C. is dipping its
pen in red ink, but we have seen
that things are not in a state of

bankruptcy over
there. And they
have not com
pletely given up
the idea.
"No action at
X'this time," was
/"the resolution
passed at the i
Board meeting |
Fridav nieht. and

i nuct}' JiigJii, dllLl
track bleacher visions looked dim. |
But the men around the table knew |
that the bleachers would he built i
some time in the near future, de- ■;
pending upon the balancing of the ;
books.
While things are not in the pink
financially, the time does seem
ripe for consideration of track
expenditure, Th" Vowing Sophs '
had their stadium and the Laugh
ing Boys their Pavilion. Stanford
is about to see its greatest track ,
season since Dyer and Eastman
made history in 1932, and if the
Board can possibly see its way !
clear, now is the time.
But the B.A.C. is too big a plant
to be operated from hand to mouth,
and it cannot be expected to spend
its last penny. Stanford can only |
hope that bleachers can be built by
money appropriated in some other
way, perhaps in place of expendi- j
tures already budgeted.
If such an alternative appears, |
and Stanford students are given the
choice after the next B.A.C. meet- I
ing, February 15, it will be their!
chance to promote improved spec- |
tator facilities at Angell Field so!
that students and fans can sit com- J
fortably and watch a fine team
bring home the bacon.
