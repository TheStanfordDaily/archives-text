## JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor Papoose Basketballers Down Two Bay Squads 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Sparkling on both offense and defense beyond Coach 11. B. Lee's fond
est dreams, Stanford's yearling cagers mildly surprised fans with vastly i
improved teamwork, chalking up a pair of basketball victories and
vindicating a like number of Card varsity defeats over the week-end.
Experimenting with a one-week-old combination which included an i

almost completely revamped line-,
up in both personnel and positions,
Lee fielded a squad which made up
for its lack of long practice together
with aggressive floorwork, which
stopped Polytechnic and George
Washington High Schools of San
Francisco.
BAY QUINTETS FALL
Both powerful Bay quintets were
paralyzed by second-half exhibitions
of shooling skill and defensive tac
tics. Poly fell 40-30 Friday night
and Washington was crushed 32-19
Saturday.
The most surprising experiment of
the week-end double bill was the
performance of Bob Penn, trans
planted center, who was a firebrand
at his new forward post, and Lew
Reese, who was elevated to first
string forward after warming the
bench in the season's first two
games last month, when the frosh
took two on the chin.
Penn, a lanky 6-foot 6-incher,
came up with 20 points, chalking up
14 in Saturday's encounter, while
Reese countered with 17 points Fri
day and four Saturday for high
scoring honors with 21 points. Be
sides leading the scoring parade,
the two forwards were powers on
defense along with Bill Cowden,
Ollie Hamlin and Vera Hoffman.
Dick Ray hooped 13 points as a
sub, raising his stock for seeing con
siderable action from now on at
both forward and guard posts.

*
Handcuffers of both Poly's and
Washington's sharpshooters were
chiefly Hamlin and Cowden, who
broke up numerous scoring plays
and were able feeders on offense to
Penn and Reese.
Bottled up with 10 points the first
half, the freshmen turned around
and stole the play away from the
Washington squad during the second
period in taking the 32-19 decision,
while limiting the invaders to six
points. The Papooses held a 22-17
edge at half-time against Poly.
Shades of another successful sea
son for Lee's proteges loom. After
starting out with a small club in
the first two tilts, Lee has built up
a taller quintet around Penn, Reese,
Hoffman, and Cowden. Hamlin is
the smallest man, while Ray is a
shade under six feet, but with an
other week of practice observers
belfeve the club will be set to give
Gallileo and Piedmont High Schools
both barrels this week-end. Lee i
figures to smooth out flaws in ball- j
handling while setting up shots at i
the hoop.

of shooling skill and defensive tac
tics. Poly fell 40-30 Friday night
and Washington was crushed 32-19
Saturday.
The most surprising experiment of
the week-end double bill was the
performance of Bob Penn, trans
planted center, who was a firebrand
at his new forward post, and Lew
Reese, who was elevated to first
string forward after warming the
bench in the season's first two
games last month, when the frosh
took two on the chin.
Penn, a lanky 6-foot 6-incher,
came up with 20 points, chalking up
14 in Saturday's encounter, while
Reese countered with 17 points Fri
day and four Saturday for high
scoring honors with 21 points. Be
sides leading the scoring parade,
the two forwards were powers on
defense along with Bill Cowden,
Ollie Hamlin and Vera Hoffman.
Dick Ray hooped 13 points as a
sub, raising his stock for seeing con
siderable action from now on at
both forward and guard posts.

*
Handcuffers of both Poly's and
Washington's sharpshooters were
chiefly Hamlin and Cowden, who
broke up numerous scoring plays
and were able feeders on offense to
Penn and Reese.
Bottled up with 10 points the first
half, the freshmen turned around
and stole the play away from the
Washington squad during the second
period in taking the 32-19 decision,
while limiting the invaders to six
points. The Papooses held a 22-17
edge at half-time against Poly.
Shades of another successful sea
son for Lee's proteges loom. After
starting out with a small club in
the first two tilts, Lee has built up
a taller quintet around Penn, Reese,
Hoffman, and Cowden. Hamlin is
the smallest man, while Ray is a
shade under six feet, but with an
other week of practice observers
belfeve the club will be set to give
Gallileo and Piedmont High Schools
both barrels this week-end. Lee i
figures to smooth out flaws in ball- j
handling while setting up shots at i
the hoop.
Sparkling on both offense and defense beyond Coach 11. B. Lee's fond
est dreams, Stanford's yearling cagers mildly surprised fans with vastly i
improved teamwork, chalking up a pair of basketball victories and
vindicating a like number of Card varsity defeats over the week-end.
Experimenting with a one-week-old combination which included an i

almost completely revamped line-,
up in both personnel and positions,
Lee fielded a squad which made up
for its lack of long practice together
with aggressive floorwork, which
stopped Polytechnic and George
Washington High Schools of San
Francisco.
BAY QUINTETS FALL
Both powerful Bay quintets were
paralyzed by second-half exhibitions
of shooling skill and defensive tac
tics. Poly fell 40-30 Friday night
