TO the conclusions drawn by the author from
statistical material of the sorority survey
printed in The Daily today, little new need be
added.
But one point revealed by questionnaire an
swers deserves emphasis: that, regardless of
living group, Stanford women are satisfied with
their own particular unit. This point, appar
ently, has been completely overlooked when
the sorority question has been discussed—in
these columns as well as elsewhere.
It throws strong light on the large body of
arguments for and against sororities which
are based on one of two major objectives: "for
the good of the University," and "for the good
of the girls." From the survey, it is immediately
apparent that discussion on the latter plane has
been meaningless, since, by the girls' own tes
timony, they are satisfied.
The intrinsic falsity of the first may be dealt
with nearly as summarily: the existence of
sororities or fraternities has little effect on the
actual theoretical functioning of student gov
ernment, although it may play a large part in
the personnel by which it functions. Socially,
although the Row may partially destroy the
unity of Stanford women as a whole, its effect
is only a little more exaggerated than that of
any other living groups.
But, arguments and surveys aside, the un
questionable fact remains that sororities are
dying by slow self-poison. Unless they are
revamped to fit the changing economic position
of Stanford women, unless they forget tradi
tional pledging customs to cope with increas
ing Hall leadership, they will inevitably follow
the ponderous steps of the old-fashioned dino
saur.
