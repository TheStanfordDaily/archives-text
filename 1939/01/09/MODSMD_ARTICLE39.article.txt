# Mooney on Parade
## 
### 
TWENTY-TWO years of bondage for the
world's most famous prisoner came to an
end in Sacramento Saturday, when California's
new Governor Culbert L. Olson granted free and
unconditional pardon to Thomas J. Mooney,
convicted but unproved bomber of San Fran
cisco's 1916 Preparedness Day parade.
For 22 years the Captive of San Quentin has
been a red flag to labor's agitators, a painful
annoyance to capital's apologists. Jailed on
the evidence of perjured witnesses, and never
proved legally guilty, he has been for radicals
the symbol of capitalist oppression, for liberals
the symbol of a justice gone tragically wrong.
Repeatedly offered parole by Mr. Olson's five
predecessors, he has refused each time, deter
mined to prove his innocence, determined too,
perhaps, to make of his name even more of a
legend than it was before. With the inaugura
tion of the Olson Administration, he has at last
achieved the unconditional release he has al
ways sought.
What uses he will make of his freedom, prob
ably he alone can say. In his address at the
hearing Saturday he dedicated himself to "the
building of a new social order," a remark suf
ficiently vague to commit him to nothing, suffi
ciently high-sounding to retain for him the
sentimental allegiance he has so long received
from self-anointed liberals and the major labor
groups. His interests lie with labor; it is through
labor that he will undoubtedly work.
It is to be hoped that that work will consist,
not of widening the breach in labor's ranks, not
in continued and bitter attacks upon the society
which imprisoned him for 22 years, but in
constructive "elder statesmanship" in the best
interests of organized labor and the Nation.
For his sake, and for the sake of those who
believe in him, it is to be hoped that he will not
use his enormous prestige to foment trouble
for trouble's sake. Governor Olson feels he
has righted a long-standing wrong; it would
be just a little too ironic if all he had done was
open a Pandora's Box for California.

the symbol of a justice gone tragically wrong.
Repeatedly offered parole by Mr. Olson's five
predecessors, he has refused each time, deter
mined to prove his innocence, determined too,
perhaps, to make of his name even more of a
legend than it was before. With the inaugura
tion of the Olson Administration, he has at last
achieved the unconditional release he has al
ways sought.
What uses he will make of his freedom, prob
ably he alone can say. In his address at the
hearing Saturday he dedicated himself to "the
building of a new social order," a remark suf
ficiently vague to commit him to nothing, suffi
ciently high-sounding to retain for him the
sentimental allegiance he has so long received
from self-anointed liberals and the major labor
groups. His interests lie with labor; it is through
labor that he will undoubtedly work.
It is to be hoped that that work will consist,
not of widening the breach in labor's ranks, not
in continued and bitter attacks upon the society
which imprisoned him for 22 years, but in
constructive "elder statesmanship" in the best
interests of organized labor and the Nation.
For his sake, and for the sake of those who
believe in him, it is to be hoped that he will not
use his enormous prestige to foment trouble
for trouble's sake. Governor Olson feels he
has righted a long-standing wrong; it would
be just a little too ironic if all he had done was
open a Pandora's Box for California.
