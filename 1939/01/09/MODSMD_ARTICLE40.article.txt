# Propaganda Unmasked
## 
### 
FURTHER evidence of Stanford's new-lound
interest in world affairs presents itself when
Kirm philosophers tonight begin to project their
metaphysical minds on the problem of "Propa
ganda in a series of five lectures.
The faculty of the philosophy department
will attack its subject from five different and
individual angles, will thoroughly explore what
is rapidly becoming a vicious art both nationally
and internationally. The series promises to be
mort? than a discussion of methods; it will be an
inquiry into the social and moral values and
the mental thought-sequences that lie behind

everyday attempts to draw hazy curtains be
tween the world and truth.
What Stanford may expect to gain from the
lectures will be a far-from-ordinary intellectual
work-out. The net result to audiences will be
an orderly classification of values that will make
easier judgment of fact and action that appear
in the news and in history.
Probably disappointed will be those who go
to hear local philosophers pan Hitler, Musso
lini, European statesmanship, totalitarianism, or
boost Democracy. It would appear from the
program that lectures will follow a more meta
physical trend.
And it is more likely that sound ideas will
arise from professorial contemplation like this,
than from emotional denunciation as might
easily be the case.
Stanford may be surprised, should be pleased
to find its philosophy department pushing its
nose out of weighty, but removed, doctrines,
awakening long enough to put its mind on
twentieth-century problems.—H. L. S.
