## WOTTAMAN THE PHI BETE 
### JOHN COBBS 
/ of my friends was propped up in. the corner of
a Union booth the other morning, making cautious
advances to a cup of black coffee. He looked like
something left unburied because it wasn't considered
fit for holy ground.
"What's the matter with you?" I asked brightly.
"Bad mineral water?"
He gave me a look that blistered the paint on the
back of the booth. "This damn university," he
snarled, "is just 45 million dollars worth of frustra
tion. I don't know what you can do safely, but I do
know that if you try to study, you automatically start
heading for a drunkard's grave."

The theory interested me, and so I established my
self in the opposite corner. As the coffee began to
take the fuzz off his mind, my friend undertook to
back up his indictment.
It seems that on the night before he had steeled
himself to an evening of intensive study. Immediately
after supper he grabbed his books and bolted for the
library, sternly ignoring a group of the brothers who
were talking about a party scheduled for that evening.
At the libe he entrenched behind a text and started
untangling concepts with earnest concentration. But
the reading room resounded with its typical surf
like roar, built up of scraping feet and whispers. The
radiator at the end of the room cut loose with its ma
chine gun sound effects. A group of girls at the next
table began to giggle. A blonde on the other side
crossed her legs indiscreetly.

TI/IY FRIEND lasted half an hour, and then stalked
out. disgustedly. He spent another 30 minutes in a
Quad room, squirming on a chair that could be com
fortable only for a fat man or a hunchback. By nine
o'clock the room was cold enough to give a penguin
chilblains, and so my friend went home and locked
himself in his room. As soon as he got in, three neigh
boring radios were turned up to full volume, and a
group of carefree youths congregated outside his door,
arguing bitterly about the merits of twin beds for
married couples.
Shortly before ten o'clock, my friend tossed his
books on the desk and stormed off to the party. He
spent the rest of the night drinking a brand of punch
that combined the best features of blasting powder
and paint remover.

I heard the story sympathetically, and after my
friend had eased himself out of the booth, I sat
brooding on the paradoxical way dear alma mater
treats her step children. The situation is rather fright
ening. I have a reasonably strong constitution, but
getting a B.A. degree is going to put a terrible strain
on it.

"What's the matter with you?" I asked brightly.
"Bad mineral water?"
He gave me a look that blistered the paint on the
back of the booth. "This damn university," he
snarled, "is just 45 million dollars worth of frustra
tion. I don't know what you can do safely, but I do
know that if you try to study, you automatically start
heading for a drunkard's grave."

The theory interested me, and so I established my
self in the opposite corner. As the coffee began to
take the fuzz off his mind, my friend undertook to
back up his indictment.
It seems that on the night before he had steeled
himself to an evening of intensive study. Immediately
after supper he grabbed his books and bolted for the
library, sternly ignoring a group of the brothers who
were talking about a party scheduled for that evening.
At the libe he entrenched behind a text and started
untangling concepts with earnest concentration. But
the reading room resounded with its typical surf
like roar, built up of scraping feet and whispers. The
radiator at the end of the room cut loose with its ma
chine gun sound effects. A group of girls at the next
table began to giggle. A blonde on the other side
crossed her legs indiscreetly.

TI/IY FRIEND lasted half an hour, and then stalked
out. disgustedly. He spent another 30 minutes in a
Quad room, squirming on a chair that could be com
fortable only for a fat man or a hunchback. By nine
o'clock the room was cold enough to give a penguin
chilblains, and so my friend went home and locked
himself in his room. As soon as he got in, three neigh
boring radios were turned up to full volume, and a
group of carefree youths congregated outside his door,
arguing bitterly about the merits of twin beds for
married couples.
Shortly before ten o'clock, my friend tossed his
books on the desk and stormed off to the party. He
spent the rest of the night drinking a brand of punch
that combined the best features of blasting powder
and paint remover.

I heard the story sympathetically, and after my
friend had eased himself out of the booth, I sat
brooding on the paradoxical way dear alma mater
treats her step children. The situation is rather fright
ening. I have a reasonably strong constitution, but
getting a B.A. degree is going to put a terrible strain
on it.

a Union booth the other morning, making cautious
advances to a cup of black coffee. He looked like
something left unburied because it wasn't considered
fit for holy ground.
