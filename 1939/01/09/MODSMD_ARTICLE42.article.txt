Before one of Stanford's freshman women came to
school last, fall, an upperclassman Rough was stuffing
her with advice.
"Stay round the English Corner," he said. "Go to
the Union. Go there a lot. People will think you are
getting around."

The boys up on the Row, I hear, are making it,
tough again for the Roble gems going up for their
nerve-wracking grind at sorority teas, luncheons, and
dinners.
They yell at them as they go up, but that is to
be expected. More than anything, though, they create
a general impression of pandemonium. I mean on most
Sundays it would create nothing but a gentle stir if a
bunch of Row men went up and down the Row stop
ping at all sororities turning the tops down on con
vertables and shouting that spring is here.
But they did that yesterday and it was quite effec
tive. It gave the word chaos a vivid meaning for the
freshman women.
And one senior, taking advantage of his knowl
edge that the Roble beauties are more than a little
ofT-center mentally and emotionally during rushing,
saw one of the frosh get out of a high-powered Pack
ard and go into one of the sororities.
He immediately called that house and asked for
the woman with the Packard. She came to the phone.
"I'm interested in Packards," the guy said. "Would
you let me have the keys to your car for a few
hours?"
She gave them to him. Without hesitation she gave
them to him.
Wait until about Thursday.

That freshman who is all the time popping off in
class that Mr. Whatsis isn't here but he was in my
history class ten minutes ago is undoubtedly the guy
who would be picked by a majority of popular maga
zine writers as the Stanford undergraduate who has
the best chance of becoming a professor.
He is unbelievably absent-minded.
One evening he looked at his watch. It was (i:2O.
He rushed to his bureau, picked up a package of
matches, tore down to the Commons, and waited in
line to get in to cat with this paper match clutched
in his hand. He was firmly convinced that he had his
meal ticket.
And it is nothing al all to see him waiting patiently
at the door for 15 or 20 minutes on that day in the
week when the Commons isn't open.

That freshman who is all the time popping off in
class that Mr. Whatsis isn't here but he was in my
history class ten minutes ago is undoubtedly the guy
who would be picked by a majority of popular maga
zine writers as the Stanford undergraduate who has
the best chance of becoming a professor.
He is unbelievably absent-minded.
One evening he looked at his watch. It was (i:2O.
He rushed to his bureau, picked up a package of
matches, tore down to the Commons, and waited in
line to get in to cat with this paper match clutched
in his hand. He was firmly convinced that he had his
meal ticket.
And it is nothing al all to see him waiting patiently
at the door for 15 or 20 minutes on that day in the
week when the Commons isn't open.

Before one of Stanford's freshman women came to
school last, fall, an upperclassman Rough was stuffing
her with advice.
"Stay round the English Corner," he said. "Go to
the Union. Go there a lot. People will think you are
getting around."

FEMALE HUSHING
The boys up on the Row, I hear, are making it,
tough again for the Roble gems going up for their
nerve-wracking grind at sorority teas, luncheons, and
dinners.
They yell at them as they go up, but that is to
be expected. More than anything, though, they create
a general impression of pandemonium. I mean on most
Sundays it would create nothing but a gentle stir if a
bunch of Row men went up and down the Row stop
ping at all sororities turning the tops down on con
vertables and shouting that spring is here.
But they did that yesterday and it was quite effec
tive. It gave the word chaos a vivid meaning for the
freshman women.
And one senior, taking advantage of his knowl
edge that the Roble beauties are more than a little
ofT-center mentally and emotionally during rushing,
saw one of the frosh get out of a high-powered Pack
ard and go into one of the sororities.
He immediately called that house and asked for
the woman with the Packard. She came to the phone.
"I'm interested in Packards," the guy said. "Would
you let me have the keys to your car for a few
hours?"
She gave them to him. Without hesitation she gave
them to him.
Wait until about Thursday.
