# French Movie Makes Big Hit
## First Sunday Night Picture Draws 384 
### FRANCES SLATER 
"Amphitryon," presented last night
in Memorial Theater as first in a
bCT"\-> of Sunday uighi movies,
sounds like a good three units in
anybody's time schedule.
Actually, it is exceedingly smart
Smokehouse stuff—urbane and pi
quant wit with a classical title, Gal
lic subtitles, and off-shade meanings
visible to the color-blind for fifty
miles on a clear day.
It involves Papa Jove as the brow
beaten husband of a portly old biddy
who has dark circles under her eyes
from waiting up nights.
Papa Jove flutters down by um
brella to woo Alcmene, who finds her
husband better company and a more
efficient lover. Papa Jove falls asleep
on Damos wine.
The portrayal of Mercury as a
skinny deadpan—the picture of Jove
as a French boulcvardier with clas
sical sideburns—the racy, impudent
dialogue by Jean Giradoux make
"Amphitryon" a splitting farce. The
Greeks had a word for it, but you
won't find it in Plato.
The first in a group of non-profit
making films to be shown weekly,
"Amphitryon" drew more than 384
persons.
