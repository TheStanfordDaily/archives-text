### Larry Livingston 
|>RIME Minister Chamberlain Ls;
traveling again. In all proba
bility the results of his trip to Italy
via France will have no such sensa
tional outcome as the shot-gun
wedding of Fascism and Democracy
which was solemnized on the occa
sion of his Munich jaunt last sum
mer.
When he met with Hitler. Musso
lini, and Daladicr in Munich, Mr.
Chamberlain had only one object in
mind—preservation of the peace of
Europe. And when he meets II
Duce tomorrow, after a stop-over
in Paris for tea with Daladicr this
afternoon, the British prime minis
ter will be concentrating on the
same idea.
First on Chamberlain's docket
funics discussion of the problem
of the Spanish Civil War and a
proposal that Italian troops aid
ing the Insurgent cause be re
called to their homeland. On the
other band, first on Mussolini's
list comes a demand that Eng
land aid in mediation to satisfy
Italy's territorial demands on
France.
Chamberlain has announced his I
intention to steer clear of the Italo- j
French dispute, but Fascist news
organs' state, in no uncertain terms,
that unless Britain will intervene to
settle the troubles caused by Italy's
claims on France, the meeting will i
come to naught.
If Mr. Chamberlain does agree to j
stick his nose in the fracas, he will |
take no direct action but will pay a
return visit to France with sugges
tions for conciliation, territorial
transfer, and peace. However, if he
does not take a liking to the idea,
another meeting of the Big Four
may be necessary in order to settle
the matter.
In brief, what Mussolini modest
ly demands from M. Daladicr is
(I) parcels of land in the French
colony of Tunisia, (2) rights in the
use and control of the Suez Canal,
and (.'I) possession of the French
Sonialiland port of Djibouti,
which is the outlet of Addis Ababa
to the sea.

IL DUCE expected that when
Prime Minister Chamberlain
came to Pome to talk about the
Spanish War, he would be able to
present him with a final Insurgent
victory. In order to assure this, he
placed every available Italian re
source at Franco's disposal in the
furious drive on the Catalonian front
last week.
But. today the success of the Reb
els seems very questionable. Sig
nificant. perhaps is the fact that j
Spanish and Italian members of j
Franco's general staff are not agree- I
ing as to what the next move in |
their campaign should be. Leaders i
of Mussolini's "volunteers" insist on |
pushing on to the Catalonian sea- j
coast to crush the Loyalists with a
super-colossal victory.
Insurgent generals, fearing the
effect of defeat on their army's
morale, hold that troops should !
be withdrawn from Catalonia to
bolster the crumbling Rebel line
at Estramadurc where the Re
publicans' last stand has met with
surprising succcsses.
Last reports as Franco myste
riously closed the Spanish frontier i
to all communication last night were I
that the concentrated Insurgent I
force would complete the drive on :
Catalonia.

r PHF. U.S. Congress learned yes
terday, in the annual report of
the National Munitions Control
Board, that the State Department
has been engaged in a little extra
curricular activity in connection
with Japanese bombing of civilians
in China.
Invoking moral sanctions, Sec- !
rctary Cordcll Hull put a halt to '
Japan's purchasing of military J
aircraft in the United States in i
the middle of the summer after ■
the Nipponese aggressors were !
officially blacklisted. The report !
does not specifically mention Jap- j
an, but it is the only country af- j
fected by limitations on the liccns- i
ing of exports of most armament
. producers.
Moral pressure, plus official regu
lation was responsible for almost j
completely stopping shipments of 1
aircraft equipment to Japan; the re
port made vague mention of "one !
notable exception."
MORE trouble seems to be in
store for the nation's No. 1 ;
troubled citizen today. Enough op- I
position to three of President Roo- j
scvelt's recent appointees seems to |
have materialized to delay substan- ]
lially their confirmation in the Sen- ,
iite and to give the Chief Executive |
a good-sized headache.
The Senate Commerce Commit- '
lee, headed by anti-New Dealer
Joseph W. Bailey, decided yester
day to hold open hearing on the
nomination of llarry L. Hopkins,
former WPA chief, to the post of
Secretary of Commerce. Also de
nounced were the appointments of 1
former Senator James P. Pope to
the TVA directorate and Floyd
Roberts as a federal district judge.
