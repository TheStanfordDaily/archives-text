Stanford without sororities—how it could be brought about and what
it might Ih> like; this is the situation described in a recent interview by'
Dean of Women Mary Yost.
"In the future as in the past." she declared, "there will be no pressure
tpon the sororities to turn in their charters. If, however, the houses should
?ver come to feel that the disadvantages of continuing in their present

►position overbalance the advantages,
the University stands ready to take
over their houses and run them as
small living groups."
That this prospect is indeed a dis
tant one, however, is indicated by
the present attitude on campus as
illustrated by the results of the sur
vey conducted last spring. Only 13
of 81 sorority women registering
opinions (including 12 pledges liv
ing in Ruble) indicated that they
would vote for sorority abolition if
the question were ever to arise.
The University's ability in this
event to operate the present sorority
houses as regular residences has
been proven, Dean Yost stated, in
its present operation of the small
cottages and houses which are Un
ion units. In each house there would
be living a resident assistant, per
haps a graduate student studying to
be a dean, as are many of the resi
dent assistants in the Union units and
Lagunita casas today. For each
group of houses there would be a
residence director, as there is for
each of the larger dormitories today.
All residence directors and assist
ants would be actual members of
Dean Yost's staff, as they arc at the
present time.
The years of transition, during
which a few sorority members re
mained undergraduates, would con
stitute the main difficulty, according
to the Dean. Insofar as they would
desire, she continued, these girls
would be allowed to continue living
in their respective houses, and would
be given some choice as to the new
women who would move in to fill up
vacancies. After all sorority mem
bers had graduated, housing would
be conducted by drawing for resi
dence, as in the halls today.
The probable effect on campus life
with the discontinuation of sorori
ties was further outlined by Miss
Yost, who formerly attended a col
lege where there were no sororities
as well as a collcgc where she is a
sorority member. The "national"
advantages of a sorority she feels can
be largely duplicated by university
alumni clubs in cities all over the
nation.
Miss Yost went on to say that
school feeling is stronger, in her
opinion, in universities where there
arc not divided loyalties and compe
tition of groups within.
The main advantages of sorority
life, in Miss Yost's opinion, are those
of "line young people living to
gether." This conclusion is rein
forced by returns of last spring's
survey where an overwhelming ma
jority of How women put down as
the main reason for retention of
sororities that, (hey "fostered friend
ships" and made "a homelike atmos
phere away from home."
The disadvantages of sororities,
however, Miss Yost reasons, arc not
of the people in them but of the
system itself. Therefore she believes
that if the system could be done
away with, the advantages could
still be retained in regular univer
sity residence units.
This opinion is, however, actively
contested by the great majority of
sorority members. Members of Pan
hellenic Council, when questioned as
a representative group, felt that un
der the system women have more
freedom and independence than
would be possible under a larger,
more centrally controlled group of
units. Although the lack of freedom
for an individual in sororities is
often scored as one of the strongest
points against them, Panhellenic
members feel that this is more than
offset by the amount of self-determi
nation and initiative which can be
shown by the group as a whole.
They explain that, while house
mothers in sororities have little or
no authority, directors in university
units necessarily have a large share
in the planning and administration
of group activities.
They state further that whereas in
a dormitory participation of the in
dividual in group activities is only
encouraged, in a sorority it is abso
lutely ncccssary. Duties such as
planning social events are regularly
assigned to all members. While this
self-administration inevitably results
in increased living expenses as com
pared to the halls, sorority women
feel that the added experience more
than compensates the waste.

my group than the larger group in
which I lived before," wrote one
