# Air Reserve May Include Farm Flyers
## Intercollegiate Wins Raise Hope for Part In National Program 
### 
Possibility that Stanford may be
come a part of the president's pro
gram for training 20,000 university
youths as military reserve fliers was
seen last December 29 when the
San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce communicated with the U.S.
Civil Aeronautics Authority, re
questing that this University and
the University of California bo
granted a share in the extensive
plan.
Mention was made in the radio
gram of the leading part played by
Stanford and the flying club in the
nation's intercollegiate aviation
activities.
ORGANIZED IN mi;
The Stanford Flying Club was or
ganized in March, 1936, as the re.sull
of six years of interest in aviation
on the part of students, and has
since competed in three national air
meets with excellent success. Stu
dent fliers, financing their own trips,
have attended air meets in Detroit,
in 1936, New York City in 1937, and
Akron in J938. Two first places and
one second place were taken in
these meets.
The University is at presept pos
sessor of the Grover Leoning award,
highest that can be given in col
legiate Hying. The award, won in
1938, was based on the fact that
Stanford exceeded every other uni
versity in 1937-38 in amount, varia
tion, and intensity of flying activity.
The program of flight training is
being conducted by the National
Youth Administration and the Civil
Aeronautics Authority. Eight uni
versities have already been named
to take part in the mechanical train
ing, but none has been chosen as yet
to give training in flying.
PALO ALTO SUPPORT
The Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce is also interested in having
the program established here. The
aviation committee has furnished
the corresponding committee in San
Francisco's Chamber of Commerce
with information concerning Stan
ford's flying activities.
The Palo Alto group has also
communicated with Dr. William F.
Durand, Stanford aeronautics â€¢ au
thority, now in Richmond, Va., and
Dr. David L. Webster, professor of
physics at the University, who is
now in Washington, D.C., to ask
them to bring their influence to bear
in having Stanford chosen.
More than 70 University students
are now flying, and it. is estimated
that over 100 more have more than
ten hours dual or solo instruction
to their credit.
