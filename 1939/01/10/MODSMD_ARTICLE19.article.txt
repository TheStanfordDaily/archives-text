ATTENDS SUMMER SESSIONS

and Louis Horst, musician-composer
and teacher of dance composition.

workshop production of "Panorama"
in 1935, and during the two succeed
ing sessions served as a choreog

works. At present she is on a leave
of absence from the University of
Chicago in order to teach on the
faculty of Mills College.

dance group include Eleanor Lauer,
Ruth Heisey, Susan Loeb, and Polly
Ann Schwartz, all of whom are con

fessional Chicago group and who
accompanied her to the West Coast.
The danseuse and her group have
given a demonstration of dance
composition before the Mid-west
Physical Education Convention for
the past two years.
Mr. Gregory Tucker, member of
the Bennington College faculty, has
composed several of the pieces for
the dance concert. Miss Esther Wil
liamson. a teaching fellow at Mills
College, will serve as pianist for the
program.
