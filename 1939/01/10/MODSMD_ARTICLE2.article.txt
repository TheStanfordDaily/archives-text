# Philosopher Classifies Propaganda
## Dr. Brown Criticizes Education as Mere 'Coloration of Ideas' 
### 
Considering propaganda and its
influence on education and public
opinion, Professor Harold Chapman
Brown, head of the philosophy de
partment, addressed a capacity au
dience in the Education Building
auditorium last night.
"In short," said Dr. Brown, "all
education is and should be propa
ganda, but it is a form of high
minded propaganda that is not dis
honest, in either withholding facts
or attempting to include false no
tions. It, brings out the coloration,
and inevitable set, views that are a
part of higher education.
"We must not. fool ourselves into
thinking we can escape its influ
ences. but must learn to weigh, an
alize, and recognize propaganda that
honest men can approve."
MODERN INTERPRETATION
Opening his discussion, Professor
Brown brought out the modern in
terpretation of the word px-opaganda.
"All terms and expresisons of our
language are subject to peculiar
interpretations and emotional atti
tudes, with the result that the term
under consideration when employed
today, is known as a weapon of at
tack."
"As such a weapon, its object is
to influence either action or thought
of an audience along predetermined
lines, and its technique can be di
vided into various types."
The first method, which was con
sidered the worst by Professor
Brown, is that which distorts and
disguises facts, employing appeal to
the emotions to shift the emphasis of
evidence into the desired channels.
SECOND CLASSIFICATION
Also dishonest but not necessarily
immoral was the second classifica
tion which includes propaganda
aimed to benefit those propagandiz
ed. In this case, falsification is pres
ent, but there is no thought of
complete deceit or injury in its out
look.
In this light Professor Brown took
time to consider our modern edu
cational system. "In many cases
college courses are set along par
ticular lines, and various viewpoints
which might be included in univer
sity curriculums, are omitted, be
cause it is considered best, not to
"bring them out."
ABSENCE OF COURSES
"Examples of this type of propa
ganda are seen in the noticeable
absence of courses in labor rela
tions, trade unionism, and radical
movements."
A third division of propaganda is
that which distorts facts only
through its personal coloring. "This
tendency," said the professor, "is
natural in human nature, as all
thought Ls tempered by definite per
spectives."
