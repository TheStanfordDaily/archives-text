CLARA has tossed a
wrench into another Big Red
Machine.
Broncos came to Stanford and
knocked the Indian off his high horse
just before the footbnll season
opened, and they tried it again in
basketball. Again they won their
game, but this time the Indian
knows better than to take the de-

featist attitude.
The Cards play
]e d some fine
teams this week
end, and they
have little reason
to lose confi
dence. True, their
ball - handling
was a little rag
ged, but that need
not excite the

moi uxcut" tne
fans, especially if they saw the Stan
lord team earlier in the season.
They have proved that they can
handle the ball like clock-work, and
the chances are they'll do it again.
If light and determination could
be sold, the Big Red Quintet
would be worth its weight in gold.
Of course it is well and good to
put up a scrap when you lose the
ball, but it is much better not to
lose it. Still, you will remember
that many of those scraps last
week-end followed successful at
tempts by the Cards to free a
ball in the opponents' possession.
As lor defense, Stanford's was
not excellent, but if it improves as
much this week as it did from Fri
day to Saturday last week-end, no
team will be able to score very
often on short shots. And yester
day's practice indicated that such
improvement is continuing.
In every department of basket
bail, the Indians have proved them
selves. All they have to learn now
is to do well in all departments at
once. Stanford has an even chance
for an even break against Southern
California this week-end, and no
body can say a team with the fight
and talent of the Cards hasn't a
chance.

JT WAS the morning after the
night before when Nebraska re
turned to the Pavilion floor last
Wednesday morning to get one
more workout before they left for
home. It would not have been so
significant that. Stanford defeated
the Cornhuskers a second time, but
this time only the Card reserves
took part.
Ben Winkelman officiated, but no 1
score was kept. It was obvious,
however, that a skillful group of In
dian second-stringers had trounced
the Nebraska firsts, and by a greater
margin than the Card varsity had
the night before.
Gil Rahn. Ralph Meigs. Will An- !
derson, Frank Wells, and Ted Ly- J
011s all turned in superior per- \
tormanccs, and it was an excellent
chance for the coaches to see
where they would stand if they
were to lose their regulars.
And their worries would not be
so great. In fact, if Rahn, Ander- j
son, and Wells continued at their j
present pace, they'll have as much
chance as anybody on a first string '
that is not yet permanent.

this time only the Card reserves
took part.
Ben Winkelman officiated, but no 1
score was kept. It was obvious,
however, that a skillful group of In
dian second-stringers had trounced
the Nebraska firsts, and by a greater
margin than the Card varsity had
the night before.
Gil Rahn. Ralph Meigs. Will An- !
derson, Frank Wells, and Ted Ly- J
011s all turned in superior per- \
tormanccs, and it was an excellent
chance for the coaches to see
where they would stand if they
were to lose their regulars.
And their worries would not be
so great. In fact, if Rahn, Ander- j
son, and Wells continued at their j
present pace, they'll have as much
chance as anybody on a first string '
that is not yet permanent.

CLARA has tossed a
wrench into another Big Red
Machine.
Broncos came to Stanford and
knocked the Indian off his high horse
just before the footbnll season
opened, and they tried it again in
basketball. Again they won their
game, but this time the Indian
knows better than to take the de-

featist attitude.
The Cards play
]e d some fine
teams this week
end, and they
have little reason
to lose confi
dence. True, their
ball - handling
was a little rag
ged, but that need
not excite the

moi uxcut" tne
fans, especially if they saw the Stan
lord team earlier in the season.
They have proved that they can
handle the ball like clock-work, and
the chances are they'll do it again.
If light and determination could
be sold, the Big Red Quintet
would be worth its weight in gold.
Of course it is well and good to
put up a scrap when you lose the
ball, but it is much better not to
lose it. Still, you will remember
that many of those scraps last
week-end followed successful at
tempts by the Cards to free a
ball in the opponents' possession.
As lor defense, Stanford's was
not excellent, but if it improves as
much this week as it did from Fri
day to Saturday last week-end, no
team will be able to score very
often on short shots. And yester
day's practice indicated that such
improvement is continuing.
In every department of basket
bail, the Indians have proved them
selves. All they have to learn now
is to do well in all departments at
once. Stanford has an even chance
for an even break against Southern
California this week-end, and no
body can say a team with the fight
and talent of the Cards hasn't a
chance.
