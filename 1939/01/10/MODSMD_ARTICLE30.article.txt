# Track Team Sets Early Year Marks
## Templeton Squad Shows Championship Material in Practice 
### 
Skeptics who were dead against a
i B.A.C. expenditure to erect a set
of bleachers 011 Angell Field be
cause they didn't believe the Indian
trackmen could produce such start
ling marks last quarter probably
got the rudest shock of their lives
yesterday afternoon.
Actually stealing the thunder
from marks they set in fall prac
tice, Coach Dink Templeton's cin
dermen definitely put the skids un
der their own "bests" with perform
ances that gave them a real look of
a potential championship squad.
The occasion was Templeton's
first time-trial track meet of the ;
current quarter. Surprising were;
the times and marks recorded when j
most of the cindermen were sup
posed to be out of shape after the |
holiday season and recent rains.
UNSUNG MEMBERS STAR
Unsung members of last season's
track squad were in the spotlight
for really the first time. Craig Wil
liamson, the 440-yard dash speed
ster who has the job of filling in for
Captain Ray Mallot, was spotted 15
yards by Charley Shaw and finished
in 48.9 seconds, equaling his pre- |
vious "best." Shaw himself crossed i
the line in 50.1 seconds.
Flashing his best form of the sea
son, Bill Hawkins nosed out Dick
Simpson and Sid Hayes in a 14.9-
second 120-yard high hurdle race,
which tied Hayes' mark last quar
ter. Captain Stan Hiserman reeled j
off a 24.6-second low hurdle test j
in trimming Simpson and Hayes.
Proving that their 4:20.5 race
early in the fall practice was 110
fluke, Marston Girard and Paul
Moore continued their mile rivalry I
with a 4:26.5 standard, remarkable
considering the lack of practice since
exams.
POOL, KENYON SURPRISE
Biggest surprises came from
Hampton Pool and Bob Kenyon. i
Pool, taking a whirl in the discus j
ring, tossed out a 144-foot effort
while Kenyon came up with a 13- i
foot mark in the pole vault. Fresh- I
man Ray Durham and Sophomore !
Hiler had marks of 136 and 133 for !
excellent distances. Pete Zagar, !
Coast Conference discus king and ;
national champion, has only recent- 1
ly reported for work.
Clyde Jeffrey was a 9.9-second j
winner of the 100-yard dash over
Hiserman and then later flashed a
21.8 220-yard dash race, definitely
stamping him as the best sprinter on
the coast and a sure-fire point win
ner in the nationals. Ernie Clark
got in a 1:59.1 half-mile and Ray j
Brown jumped 22:6 in the broad i
jump in other marks yesterday.

cause they didn't believe the Indian
trackmen could produce such start
ling marks last quarter probably
got the rudest shock of their lives
yesterday afternoon.
Actually stealing the thunder
from marks they set in fall prac
tice, Coach Dink Templeton's cin
dermen definitely put the skids un
der their own "bests" with perform
ances that gave them a real look of
a potential championship squad.
The occasion was Templeton's
first time-trial track meet of the ;
current quarter. Surprising were;
the times and marks recorded when j
most of the cindermen were sup
posed to be out of shape after the |
holiday season and recent rains.
UNSUNG MEMBERS STAR
Unsung members of last season's
track squad were in the spotlight
for really the first time. Craig Wil
liamson, the 440-yard dash speed
ster who has the job of filling in for
Captain Ray Mallot, was spotted 15
yards by Charley Shaw and finished
in 48.9 seconds, equaling his pre- |
vious "best." Shaw himself crossed i
the line in 50.1 seconds.
Flashing his best form of the sea
son, Bill Hawkins nosed out Dick
Simpson and Sid Hayes in a 14.9-
second 120-yard high hurdle race,
which tied Hayes' mark last quar
ter. Captain Stan Hiserman reeled j
off a 24.6-second low hurdle test j
in trimming Simpson and Hayes.
Proving that their 4:20.5 race
early in the fall practice was 110
fluke, Marston Girard and Paul
Moore continued their mile rivalry I
with a 4:26.5 standard, remarkable
considering the lack of practice since
exams.
POOL, KENYON SURPRISE
Biggest surprises came from
Hampton Pool and Bob Kenyon. i
Pool, taking a whirl in the discus j
ring, tossed out a 144-foot effort
while Kenyon came up with a 13- i
foot mark in the pole vault. Fresh- I
man Ray Durham and Sophomore !
Hiler had marks of 136 and 133 for !
excellent distances. Pete Zagar, !
Coast Conference discus king and ;
national champion, has only recent- 1
ly reported for work.
Clyde Jeffrey was a 9.9-second j
winner of the 100-yard dash over
Hiserman and then later flashed a
21.8 220-yard dash race, definitely
stamping him as the best sprinter on
the coast and a sure-fire point win
ner in the nationals. Ernie Clark
got in a 1:59.1 half-mile and Ray j
Brown jumped 22:6 in the broad i
jump in other marks yesterday.
Skeptics who were dead against a
i B.A.C. expenditure to erect a set
of bleachers 011 Angell Field be
cause they didn't believe the Indian
trackmen could produce such start
ling marks last quarter probably
