# Card Hoopmen In Hard Grind For Troy Meet
## Strong Trojan Five Narrows Chance For Indian Victory 
### 
Some wise guy once shot off his I
mouth that the straight and narrow !
path is the one to success and lame,
1 but maybe he never heard about the
Stanford basketball team.
For yesterday Coach Everett Dean
I started the Cardinal cagers on an
; extremely narrow path which he !
hopes will lead to at least one vic
, tory over the powerful University of i
Southern California quintet this
week-end in the opening Conference
tilts of the season for both teams,
j STRONG TROY SQUAD .... j
| The Trojans will bring north their
i finest team in several years, one
which is favored to annex the south
j ern division championship. Follow
; ing the men of Troy, the Reds tangle
with Cal's strong squad, so that nar
- row trail may very easily be very i
! long before it leads lo victory.
Stanford play.s U.C.L.A. after Cal j
and it is assumed that the Indians i
will trounce the Bruins. If they
can't squash the lowly Uclans then
they don't belong in the same league
with the Trojans and Bears.
j DEAN HOPEFUL
However, Dean is optimistic over j
i Stanford's chances against Troy Fri- J
day and Saturday, after the great |
tussles it gave St. Mary's and Santa
i Clara last week. The inexperienced
! Indians looked outclassed at times,
j but they never stopped driving, and
in each game they overcame tre- j
' mendous leads to come within an t
i ace of winning each game.
Dean sent the same first team
' through drills yesterday that started I
[ last week's games, namely, Captain j
i Phil Zonne and Lee Lafaille, for- ,
: wards; Bill Rapp, center; and Bobby
Burnett and Kenny Davidson,,
guards. There is a bare possibility j
that Don Burness may see some j
action against U.S.C., but even if,
he does get in. he is in far from
! adequate playing shape.
NOTED COACH
Coach Sam Barry of Troy is noted
. as one of the finest and most success- :
; ful casaba coaches in the country,
| but no one has ever accused him of j
I preventing his boys from playing on
the rough side. This" year, however,
i he will find against him a Cardinal
! team that takes a back seat to no I
j team for getting in the middle of ;
! things and throwing anatomies
' around. There's not one man on the j
squad who can't hold his own with I
anything the Trojans try to toss at
the Indians.
But it's that very fight that may
! bring the Indians home a surprise
winner this week-end. It brought
! them close to victory in their last \

NOTED COACH
Coach Sam Barry of Troy is noted
. as one of the finest and most success- :
; ful casaba coaches in the country,
| but no one has ever accused him of j
I preventing his boys from playing on
the rough side. This" year, however,
i he will find against him a Cardinal
! team that takes a back seat to no I
j team for getting in the middle of ;
! things and throwing anatomies
' around. There's not one man on the j
squad who can't hold his own with I
anything the Trojans try to toss at
the Indians.
But it's that very fight that may
! bring the Indians home a surprise
winner this week-end. It brought
! them close to victory in their last \
Some wise guy once shot off his I
mouth that the straight and narrow !
path is the one to success and lame,
1 but maybe he never heard about the
Stanford basketball team.
For yesterday Coach Everett Dean
I started the Cardinal cagers on an
; extremely narrow path which he !
hopes will lead to at least one vic
, tory over the powerful University of i
Southern California quintet this
week-end in the opening Conference
tilts of the season for both teams,
j STRONG TROY SQUAD .... j
| The Trojans will bring north their
i finest team in several years, one
which is favored to annex the south
j ern division championship. Follow
; ing the men of Troy, the Reds tangle
with Cal's strong squad, so that nar
- row trail may very easily be very i
! long before it leads lo victory.
Stanford play.s U.C.L.A. after Cal j
and it is assumed that the Indians i
will trounce the Bruins. If they
can't squash the lowly Uclans then
they don't belong in the same league
with the Trojans and Bears.
j DEAN HOPEFUL
However, Dean is optimistic over j
i Stanford's chances against Troy Fri- J
day and Saturday, after the great |
tussles it gave St. Mary's and Santa
i Clara last week. The inexperienced
! Indians looked outclassed at times,
j but they never stopped driving, and
in each game they overcame tre- j
' mendous leads to come within an t
i ace of winning each game.
Dean sent the same first team
' through drills yesterday that started I
[ last week's games, namely, Captain j
i Phil Zonne and Lee Lafaille, for- ,
: wards; Bill Rapp, center; and Bobby
Burnett and Kenny Davidson,,
