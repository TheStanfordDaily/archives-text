# Frosh Swim Hopes Center Around Stars
## 
### 
With team strength centered upon!
three of perhaps the strongest swim
mers ever to compete for (he Stan
ford Papooses, Coach Nort Thorn
ton yesterday promised that his
i yearling tanksters would "smash
records for sure, win meets if weak
spots in the squad could be filled
, out."
i Headliner among frosh swimmers \
!is Paul Herron, called by Coach :
| Thornton "the best swimmer Stan-
I ford ever had." Herron swims every
I event in any stroke faster than any !
man enrolled in Stanford ever has,;
in addition to being a diver of no |
I mean ability on the side.
Herron holds the junior national
: 5006-meter title at the present lime.
He swam the fastest 200-meter free- j
| style race in the nation last season, j
Backing him up are two yearlings
[ with almost as impressive a record.:
I In the breaststroke, Scott Dudley,
member of the' Ail-American high
school team for the past two years,
will be the outstanding contender.

Gardiner Miller, former Kansas City
prep star, is the Papoose hope in the
free-style events.
Team weaknesses include diving,
in which event no frosh is entered,
and the backstroke. Howard Adams,
pint-sized diving entrant, was de
clared ineligible. Frosh who have
competed in either event are urged
by Thornton to turn uut.
Yearling free-style swimmers in
clude Brad Young. Ted Smith, Fred
Manwaring, and Roscoe Jones. Jim
Canning and Hadley Bacon round
out the backstroke squad.
Possibilities for team victories
depend upon improvement in the
latter men, according to Thornton,
most of whom show much promise.
Team members are now getting in
trim for the interclass meet, set for
January 28 in the Encina Pools.
