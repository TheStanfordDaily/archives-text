# Farm in the Air
## 
### 
ANNOUNCEMENT that the Farm may be
chosen one of the 20 aviation training
schools proposed by the President in his new
defense plans brings fitting recognition to a
University which has risen in the short space
of two and a half years to a virtually unchal
lenged position at the top of collegiate aviation.
Organized under the auspices of the Stanford
Flying Club in March, 1936, Farm flyers have
already garnered for the Cardinal two firsts in
National Intercollegiate meets, the Grover Loe
ning Trophy, highest aviation award given to
colleges, and the distinction in 1937-38 of be
ing the country's most air-minded school. They
have proved beyond question not only their
enthusiasm for aviation, but their right to de
mand a place in America's air arm proportionate
to their ability in aviation.
It is possible to argue, of course, that the
President's plan is simply a not-too-subtle ap
peal to the pride of those who will play the
most important part if war comes: the young,
who will have to die. But it is also possible
to argue that conditions in a dictator-ridden
world make increased armament for America
imperative, and that in such armament young
hands, young brains, young men, will be able
to serve most capably.
Since this latter is the thought which predom
inates in the national mind at the moment, it is
only common sense to undertake the training
of the proposed 20,000 reserve aviators within
the established framework of the colleges. And
it is only common sense that Stanford, a school
standing head and shoulders above its fellows
in this regard, should be allowed to help.
When Congress gives NY A and the Civil
Aeronautics Authority the money and the go
ahead sign they are almost sure to get, it will
do well to remember the Farm's record in avia
tion, and to take to heart the fact which that
record makes apparent: the fact that (to use an
old and memory-filled slogan) Stanford is ready
to do her part. â€”A.S.D.
