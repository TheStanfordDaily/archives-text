# Football in the Red
## 
### 
IT slipped out this week that football was
517,000 "in the red"; thus, ready academi
cians were given a good chance to point ac
cusing fingers. Yet the picture does not look
as bad as it might.
The .$17,000 was not lost on the 1938 foot
ball season; there was merely $17,000 less taken
in by football than estimated in the 1938-1939
athletic budget. The amount is readily taken
care of by sinking and reserve funds, set up in
former years.
For the present, then, there is little need to
worry that Stanford has pushed athletics to
the down-hill side of the point of diminishing
returns.
Primary reason for the under-estimation is a
poor football team plus a heavily weighted
home schedule. Next year, it is thought that
there will be no repetition of this year's trouble
with traveling schedule and gate guarantees.
However, the warning is clear. Football can
no longer be figured on the up-grade as it was
in the pre-Branner Hall days.
The circumstances raise a doubt that football
will continue long to support the entire athletic
budget. But they do not as yet show that foot
ball will not pay for itself or not be profitable
to athletics and to the university.
It cannot, therefore, be suggested that foot
ball be abolished or curtailed, but only that
Stanford watch demand and supply curves and
remember the discretion of valor if by future
trends two and two do not make four.—H. L. S.
