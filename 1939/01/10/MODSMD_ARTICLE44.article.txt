# Row in the Rough
## 
### 
WHILE most discussion has been concen
trated on sororities, almost all that may
be said can apply equally well to fraternities —
with this exception: that fraternities are not dy
ing while sororities are.
An examination of this statement, and of the
status of fraternities in general, will, at the same
time, concern sororities. As was suggested
yesterday, and as is demonstrated by Stanford
fraternities, the Row splits the campus no more
than other groups. Politically, each has its day.
Scholastically, while Stanford's contingent still
finds itself slightly below school average, it
may hope to respond to the nation-wide trend
which has scholastically elevated Row above

Hall men in many schools.
All this is equally true of sororities. But the
security of fraternities, like the insecurity of
sororities, lies in the relative adaptation they
have made in response to changing economic
patterns.
While sororities have been firm in segre
gating the non-supporting (or wealthy) from
the self-supporting class of women, the frater
nities have found a place for the man who
works, by so doing add greatly to their chance
of maintaining house strength. To all general
respects, they are like any other living group
in type of membership. And, obviously, the
individuals make the house, or the system.
Yet the women are still wearing Grandma's
clothes. And sooner or later, all the glamour,
still strong, which they possess will be gone
down the drain of permanent Hall strength.
Only if they change to meet Hall competition
on an economic as well as glamour basis, will
they quietly regain strength.
For the latter attraction, still the strongest
which they possess, is becoming a trifle
weather-beaten.
