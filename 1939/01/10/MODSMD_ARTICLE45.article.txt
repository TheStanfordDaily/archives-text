# BULL SESSION

### JOHN COBBS 
IIEIL DEIt FUROR
OOBLE women and the sororities are now maneu
vering about the Stanford stage in their annual
presentation of the melodrama of rushing. From the
Stanford balcony comes the usual assortment, of cheers
and cat-calls. The situation, I realize, is a delicate and
dangerous one; and I am well aware that the only
safe course of action for a man is a strict hands-off
policy both toward women and toward their affairs.
But in a situation like this it would take inhuman self
control to keep Bull Session from adding its voice to
the ci'owd noises.
Probably it is best to begin by stating that I can
detcct no difference between sorority women and any
other women. In both cases there seems to be equal
distribution of girls who ai - e so magnificent they are
beyond description, girls who are so mediocre they
need no description, and girls who are best not
described.

In any event, the question of personalities has noth
ing to do with the matter. Unless the argument is
limited to the problem of sororities as an institution,
the whole discussion slumps to the "you're another"
level of back-fence bickering.
Ostensibly all the comments so far have been
beautifully objective appraisals of Stanford sororities
in the abstract. But here and there, the personality
argument has slipped in, hiding behind the skirts of
that sacred word, "Democracy." Sororities, it is said,
are "an insidious moss, slowly splitting the rock on
which this university was founded."

'JHIIE metaphor is enchanting, even though it docs
involve mechanical difficulties. But unfortunately
it makes a mistaken idea of democracy serve as a
flimsy disguise for a personal attack on sorority
women. The question of democracy is not involved
in the sorority situation. Under a democratic system
there is no reason why the women should not sort
themselves out into whatever groups they please. All
that democracy can guarantee is equality of rights; it
makes no attempt to enforce equality of benefit.
The sorority system is perfectly consistent with
Stanford's beloved democracy. The real question is
whether or not the sororities are worth the trouble
that centers around them, whether or not they can
stand on their own feet. Personally I believe that their
feet are deformed, and I hope that Stanford sororities
will shortly go to join the dodo and dinosaur. But I
base my judgment on an estimate of the benefits they
give their members as opposed to the very vocal
misery they cause women who take themselves too
seriously.

Row women who read the above paragraph will
kindly remember lhat this is an objective comment on
sororities as an institution.
