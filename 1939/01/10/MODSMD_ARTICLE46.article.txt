TIIUKBER DRAWING
Stories will be coming in about roller skating now,
I suppose. Every new thing that, comes up brings new
stories with it. Several people have told me stories
about different, things. It seemed an easy thing for
them to do." They came in and quite simply told me
the story. And then they have come in and said, "My
God, Jaques. I've got to write two anecdotes for
English. How can I write two anecdotes? My God,
two!"
But to get back to skating, the guy I would like
to see is the slightly mammoth frosh football player
who was trying to skate for the first time down En
cina's halls.
And not quite falling . . .
YOUNG CYNICS
Two of Encina's hashers were talking.
"Going up for rushing this week?" one of them
asked.
"Well, it's a free meal," the other said.
TYPICAL
During rushing at one of the houses here a couple
of years ago a couple of the brothers went out to the
kitchen, probably to avoid rushing if I know anything
about it, and found a guy sitting there they had never
seen before.
Purely out of reflex action, probably, they went
through the motions. They found out he was a
freshman, that he did speak English, that he did act
fairly human.
So, as they say in fraternities, they put the pin
on him.
The story has a happy ending. According to re
ports he is considered by his house as one of the
better boys, and most of the brothers know him now.

LET S get that straight
Three guys went over to Lagunita for supper Sun
day night, picked up their gals, moved into the dining
room and got a table. Soon another couple came up
and asked if they could sit there. Sure.
Everything started off very smoothly. The orig
inal six kept things going and the stray, if I may call
them that, couple came through now and then.
But then things started going a little too fast.
The six started talking very fast and confusingly. As
friends do, they were talking largely by implication—
using phrases for sentences and leaving out pertinent,
pronouns and such. They were going pretty fast.
And right in the midst of all the hubbub the fe
male of the couple pointed her fingers at one of ihe
gals and said. "Wait! Before you go any farther, are
you out with soineonr else's husband'.'"
