PARKING PEEVE
The Editor, Sir:
It's a hell of a note when we get
notices for parking our cars in the
only available space near our
classes.
The Fine new parking lot is re
served for faculty; the rest is listed
"no parking." In other words, edu
cation students must park at least a
block away from their classes.
Personally, I don't like to get up
15 minutes earlier to park the car
and then walk to class through mud.
What do you do when it rains? How
about some parking provisions for
the education corner.
