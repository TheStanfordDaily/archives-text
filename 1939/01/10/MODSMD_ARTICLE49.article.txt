# SATURDAY SLEEPER

The Editor, Sir:
Why not convert some of the 3-
unit elective courses that arc given
only on Tuesday, Thursday and
Saturday into 2-unit. courses by
eliminating one-third of the study
curriculum? It seems to me that
there arc many courses that would
not suffer irreparably by such a
change. The professors would not
be alTectcd other than by a possible
increase of their Saturday sleeping
hours. And the student would reap
great benefit by the changc. The
old curse of the Saturday morning
class would be practically eliminat
ed, thus allowing many more stu
dents than now to enjoy a week
end that meets labor union require
ments.
This is of course a question for the
Administration to consider and de
cide upon, but without strong and
frequently expressed approval ex
pressed by influential campus or
ganizations, it can never hope to be
considered, T. W. P.
