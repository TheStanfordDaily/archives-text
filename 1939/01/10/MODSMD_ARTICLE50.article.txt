# Extravaganza Of Fashiohs Stars Bennett
## 
### 
"AIJTISTS AND MODELS
ABROAD," currently playing at the
Fox-Stanford Theater, is an ex
travaganza of beautiful girls and
impossible fashions, in which Jack
Benny turns in his usual brand of
humor aided by the adequate per
formance of Joan Bennett.
In spite of this cast, the musical
still refuses to jell because of a
hackneyed plot. It concerns a Iroup
of American hoofers stranded in
Paris sans cash. In the course of
their troubles they are joined by
an American' heiress. Chased from
one holel to another they finally
hide in a dress shop, which gives
rise to a fashion show as beautiful
as any ever seen on the screen.

Among some of
the fashion ex
h i b i to r s are
Sehiaparelli, Mag
gy Rouf, and Pa
t o u . However,
even they have
> gone Hollywood,
i their creations
running to slinky
dresses with high
necks and no
backs.
I n producing
this show Holly
wood must have

tried to please all. At. least, they
have used the well known formula
of pretty girls, fair humor, and
some good songs, including "What
Have You Got that Gets Me." How
ever, as said before, it doesn't quite
add up. Maybe it's just that mu
sicals are all the same, or maybe
Jack Benny's dry humor has lost its
edge.
