# Coffee, Cokes Lead In Cellar Output
## 
### VIC ROWLAND 
Order please.
Bring me 7500 cups of coffee, 1700 cokes, <>00 glasses of milk. 31 pounds
of butter. 13 dozen eggs. 51 dozen rolls, 31 loaves of bread, 120 glasses of
orange juicc, and 12 gallons of ice cream.
Although that isn't a very well balanced diet in itself, it constitutes the
average school day food requests, in part, of 2500 Stanfordites who depend

upon the Union Cellar for suste-i
nance. About 2000 request, corre
sponding amounts of such food on
Saturdays and Sundays. The aver
age daily consumption of meat and
vegetables at the Cellar is undeter
mined because such food sold there
is but a part of that prepared for all
the Union eating places on the cam
pus, Miss Doris Braddock, manager,
revealed.
About 650 of the 2500 served on
Mondays through Fridays go for
breakfast. The noontime crowd runs
a close second with an average of
500. Dinner caters trail at 200. The
other 1150 "just drop in" for cokes,
coffee, sundaes, or milk shakes.
At one time 190 can be accommo- |
dated in the Cellar.
Breakfast is served from 7:150 to
11:30 a.m., lunch from 11:30 a.m.
to 2 p.m., and dinner from 5:30 to
8 p.m. In addition, fountain service
' 7
is available at all hours from 7:301
a.m. to 11 p.m. Coke and coflee j
drinkers arc predominant, between |
2 and 5:30 p.m. and 8 and 11:30 p.rn. |
The How of customers to the Cel- j
lar is very irregular and spasmodic,
with a majority coming 15 minutes
before and 15 minutes after the be
ginning of each class.
Sixty-two persons are in the em
ploy of the Cellar, 28 of whom are j
regular salaried workers. Others are |
students who work for their meals, |
with no cash remuneration. Of the j
total, two are day and night man- j
agcrs, three arc cashiers, 17 are on |
the fountain, 17 are waiters, one is |
a waitress, 6 are bus boys, 15 arc j
in the kitchcn as cooks and dish i
washers, and one is a porter. Work
is divided into two shifts daily.
General menus are planned a day
in advance by Miss Braddock. Divi
| dend dinners, which average 30 per
j cent of all food consumed in the Cel
j lar, are planned one week in ad-
I vance. Thi.s is done so that students
j who the Dividend dinners regu
j larly will have no duplication in
j menu over a week's time, Miss
j Braddock declared. The favorite
I Dividend dish is spaghetti and meat
balls, she said.
Dividend dinners were inaugurat
ed last year at. the suggestion of
A.S.S.U. officials, who supervise
control over all Union eating estab
lishments. "The dinners are plan
ned to offer students unaffiliated
i with fraternities, sororities, or eat
-1 ing clubs an opportunity to get |
j good, wholesome, and well-balanced j
| meals at reasonable cost," Mrs. i
i Helen G. Miller, acting director of j
| university dining halls, disclosed.
'All food is transported ot. the Cel- j
lar from the main kitchen of the
! Union in steel wagons.
Seventy-five dozen water glasses ;
and 40 dozen each of plates and cups
are in daily use. The silverware
1 consists of 50 dozen knives. 48 dozen
| forks, and 90 dozen spoons. More
I spoons than either knives or forks
I arc used because of the added need
for the many coffee drinkers, it was
said. Dish and glassware breakage
and silverware loss during the first
nine months of last year amounted
to $1700.
Many orders at the fountain are
filled through a number system:
"101" is fountain jargon for one
chocolate milkshake. The first "1"
indicates the flavor. The zero
means "milk shake" in fountain
terminology, and the last "1" re
veals the number of the shakes
wanted. "201" is soda-jcrkers' slang
for one vanilla shake; "301," one
coffee or mocha shake; "401." one
strawberry shake; and "501," one
pineapple shake. If a customer asks
for a vanilla shake with an egg,
the fountainecr shouts, "201 square."
Calls for malted milks and other
fountain foods are managed in a
similar manner.
Nearly all food served in the Cel
lar comes from San Francisco. The
Union maintains its own ice cream
plant.

2 and 5:30 p.m. and 8 and 11:30 p.rn. |
The How of customers to the Cel- j
lar is very irregular and spasmodic,
with a majority coming 15 minutes
before and 15 minutes after the be
ginning of each class.
Sixty-two persons are in the em
ploy of the Cellar, 28 of whom are j
regular salaried workers. Others are |
students who work for their meals, |
with no cash remuneration. Of the j
total, two are day and night man- j
agcrs, three arc cashiers, 17 are on |
the fountain, 17 are waiters, one is |
a waitress, 6 are bus boys, 15 arc j
in the kitchcn as cooks and dish i
washers, and one is a porter. Work
is divided into two shifts daily.
General menus are planned a day
in advance by Miss Braddock. Divi
| dend dinners, which average 30 per
j cent of all food consumed in the Cel
j lar, are planned one week in ad-
I vance. Thi.s is done so that students
j who the Dividend dinners regu
j larly will have no duplication in
j menu over a week's time, Miss
j Braddock declared. The favorite
I Dividend dish is spaghetti and meat
balls, she said.
Dividend dinners were inaugurat
ed last year at. the suggestion of
A.S.S.U. officials, who supervise
control over all Union eating estab
lishments. "The dinners are plan
ned to offer students unaffiliated
i with fraternities, sororities, or eat
-1 ing clubs an opportunity to get |
j good, wholesome, and well-balanced j
| meals at reasonable cost," Mrs. i
i Helen G. Miller, acting director of j
| university dining halls, disclosed.
'All food is transported ot. the Cel- j
lar from the main kitchen of the
! Union in steel wagons.
Seventy-five dozen water glasses ;
and 40 dozen each of plates and cups
are in daily use. The silverware
1 consists of 50 dozen knives. 48 dozen
| forks, and 90 dozen spoons. More
I spoons than either knives or forks
I arc used because of the added need
for the many coffee drinkers, it was
said. Dish and glassware breakage
and silverware loss during the first
nine months of last year amounted
to $1700.
Many orders at the fountain are
filled through a number system:
"101" is fountain jargon for one
chocolate milkshake. The first "1"
indicates the flavor. The zero
means "milk shake" in fountain
terminology, and the last "1" re
veals the number of the shakes
wanted. "201" is soda-jcrkers' slang
for one vanilla shake; "301," one
coffee or mocha shake; "401." one
strawberry shake; and "501," one
pineapple shake. If a customer asks
for a vanilla shake with an egg,
the fountainecr shouts, "201 square."
Calls for malted milks and other
fountain foods are managed in a
similar manner.
Nearly all food served in the Cel
lar comes from San Francisco. The
Union maintains its own ice cream
plant.
Order please.
Bring me 7500 cups of coffee, 1700 cokes, <>00 glasses of milk. 31 pounds
of butter. 13 dozen eggs. 51 dozen rolls, 31 loaves of bread, 120 glasses of
orange juicc, and 12 gallons of ice cream.
Although that isn't a very well balanced diet in itself, it constitutes the
average school day food requests, in part, of 2500 Stanfordites who depend

upon the Union Cellar for suste-i
nance. About 2000 request, corre
sponding amounts of such food on
Saturdays and Sundays. The aver
age daily consumption of meat and
vegetables at the Cellar is undeter
mined because such food sold there
is but a part of that prepared for all
the Union eating places on the cam
pus, Miss Doris Braddock, manager,
revealed.
About 650 of the 2500 served on
Mondays through Fridays go for
breakfast. The noontime crowd runs
a close second with an average of
500. Dinner caters trail at 200. The
other 1150 "just drop in" for cokes,
coffee, sundaes, or milk shakes.
At one time 190 can be accommo- |
dated in the Cellar.
Breakfast is served from 7:150 to

'All food is transported ot. the Cel- j
lar from the main kitchen of the
! Union in steel wagons.
Seventy-five dozen water glasses ;
and 40 dozen each of plates and cups
are in daily use. The silverware
1 consists of 50 dozen knives. 48 dozen
| forks, and 90 dozen spoons. More
I spoons than either knives or forks
I arc used because of the added need
for the many coffee drinkers, it was
said. Dish and glassware breakage
and silverware loss during the first
nine months of last year amounted
to $1700.
Many orders at the fountain are
filled through a number system:
"101" is fountain jargon for one
chocolate milkshake. The first "1"
indicates the flavor. The zero
means "milk shake" in fountain
terminology, and the last "1" re
veals the number of the shakes
wanted. "201" is soda-jcrkers' slang
for one vanilla shake; "301," one
coffee or mocha shake; "401." one
strawberry shake; and "501," one
pineapple shake. If a customer asks
for a vanilla shake with an egg,
the fountainecr shouts, "201 square."
Calls for malted milks and other
fountain foods are managed in a
similar manner.
Nearly all food served in the Cel
lar comes from San Francisco. The
Union maintains its own ice cream
plant.
Order please.
Bring me 7500 cups of coffee, 1700 cokes, <>00 glasses of milk. 31 pounds
of butter. 13 dozen eggs. 51 dozen rolls, 31 loaves of bread, 120 glasses of
orange juicc, and 12 gallons of ice cream.
Although that isn't a very well balanced diet in itself, it constitutes the
average school day food requests, in part, of 2500 Stanfordites who depend

upon the Union Cellar for suste-i
nance. About 2000 request, corre
sponding amounts of such food on
Saturdays and Sundays. The aver
age daily consumption of meat and
vegetables at the Cellar is undeter
mined because such food sold there
is but a part of that prepared for all
the Union eating places on the cam
pus, Miss Doris Braddock, manager,
revealed.
About 650 of the 2500 served on
Mondays through Fridays go for
breakfast. The noontime crowd runs
a close second with an average of
500. Dinner caters trail at 200. The
other 1150 "just drop in" for cokes,
coffee, sundaes, or milk shakes.
At one time 190 can be accommo- |
dated in the Cellar.
Breakfast is served from 7:150 to
11:30 a.m., lunch from 11:30 a.m.
to 2 p.m., and dinner from 5:30 to
8 p.m. In addition, fountain service
' 7
is available at all hours from 7:301
a.m. to 11 p.m. Coke and coflee j
drinkers arc predominant, between |
2 and 5:30 p.m. and 8 and 11:30 p.rn. |
The How of customers to the Cel- j
lar is very irregular and spasmodic,
with a majority coming 15 minutes
before and 15 minutes after the be
ginning of each class.
Sixty-two persons are in the em
ploy of the Cellar, 28 of whom are j
regular salaried workers. Others are |
students who work for their meals, |
with no cash remuneration. Of the j
total, two are day and night man- j
agcrs, three arc cashiers, 17 are on |
the fountain, 17 are waiters, one is |
a waitress, 6 are bus boys, 15 arc j
in the kitchcn as cooks and dish i
washers, and one is a porter. Work
is divided into two shifts daily.
General menus are planned a day
in advance by Miss Braddock. Divi
| dend dinners, which average 30 per
j cent of all food consumed in the Cel
j lar, are planned one week in ad-
I vance. Thi.s is done so that students
j who the Dividend dinners regu
j larly will have no duplication in
j menu over a week's time, Miss
j Braddock declared. The favorite
I Dividend dish is spaghetti and meat
balls, she said.
Dividend dinners were inaugurat
ed last year at. the suggestion of
A.S.S.U. officials, who supervise
control over all Union eating estab
lishments. "The dinners are plan
ned to offer students unaffiliated
i with fraternities, sororities, or eat
-1 ing clubs an opportunity to get |
j good, wholesome, and well-balanced j
| meals at reasonable cost," Mrs. i
