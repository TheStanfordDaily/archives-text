in Europe by the end of
spring quarter. Even Stanford,
safe and smug in its private world,
far from the ugliness of realities,
must sit up and take notice when
the American ambassadors to Eng
land and France make such a pre
diction.
And yesterday, make it they did.
In secret testimony before the
House and Senate Committees on
Military Affairs, Joseph P. Ken
nedy, Ambassador to the Court of
St. James, and William C. Bullitt,
Ambassador to France, prophesied
war as a result of Italian demands
on France's possessions in Africa.
Premier Daladicr is a strong
minded man, and the French are
a pretty determined people. They
have definitely decided that they
will make no territorial conces
sion to Mussolini, in the interests
of European peace or otherwise.
France has willingly supported
Prime Minister Chamberlain's ap
peasement policy so far, hut she
draws the line at giving up any
nart of her colonial empire to
Italy.
One fact, however, in the Am
bassadors' opinions, may save the
day for peace; although France is
unwilling to attend any map-mak
ing party similar to the Munich
Conference, in which Britain or Ger
many have a part, she will probably
agree to a general conclave of Med
iterranean powers to settle the ter
ritorial problems.

America's representatives
were making their gloomy pre
dictions, Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain was still bending over
backward to keep the wayward con
tinent on the other side of the At
lantic from war. Stopping in Paris
on his way to Rome, he persuaded
Premier Daladier to let him carry to
Mussolini an offer to come to terms
on all non-territorial questions. This
sounds pleasant, but unfortunately
it is upon the settlement of the ter
ritorial questions that peace de
pends.
From Paris reports that Eng
land has promised to support
France against the menacing
moves of the German and Italian
dictatorships. That this was a pre
arranged, horn-blowing state
ment, which did not result from
today's Chamberlain - Daladier
meeting, was apparent from the
fact that it had been inadvertent
ly labeled, "not to be issued until
after tea."
Apparently the reason for Eng
land's fiery determination to keep
peace at any price is not. exactly all
brothcrhood-of-man stuff with a
neon halo over the head of St. Ne
ville. The fact of the matter is that
Britain simply cannot afford to get
involved in a war when her arma
ments are pathetically weak in
comparison with the supcr-cfficient
military machines of Germany and
Italy.

r JMIE United States is a democ
racy, its Constitution provides
for fredcom of spcech ,and this right
includes the privilege of every citi
zen to voice his opinions, his be
liefs, and his prejudices. Some
times the exercise of this right has
harmful results, results quite unlike
those the founding fathers had in
mind when they added the first
amendment to the Constitution.
Yesterday two voices were rais
ed in a Senate hearing against
confirmation of the appointment of
Felix Frankfurter as an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court on
the grounds of Ins Jewish birth
and alien origin. Members of the
committee showed annoyance and
impatience with Witnesses George
E. Sullivan and Collis Kedd, rep
resentatives of anti - radical
groups who attacked the Harvard
liberal with repeated reference to
bis "alien-mindcdncss."
. Senators insisted that in future
hearings opposition to Frankfurter's
appointment, must be based on con
crete evidence on why he is ju
dicially unsuited to occupy the Su
preme Court, post.. If the opposition
can think of a better man, they had
better bring him around. Repre

Apparently the reason for Eng
