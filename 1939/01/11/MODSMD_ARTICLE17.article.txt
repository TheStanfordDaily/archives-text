the sorority question.)

What to do about pledging will be
an important problem at Roble to
night. But the more common if less
dramatic question facing the great
majority of freshman women this
evening is what to do about not
pledging.
Naturally many women who do
not pledge will be living in halls
next year because they sincerely
feel they would most prefer that type
of living group. But just, as natu
rally will there be a certain portion
of tearful lassies up against what
may seem to them now, in spite of
all evidence and advice to the con
trary, the first major personal prob
lem of their lives.
Since they were old enough to
think about college, these troubled
freshmen may have heard glamor
ous tales of the delightful atmos
phere of sorority life. Perhaps
mother or Aunt Suzie was a member
of some particular sorority and is
especially anxious for Jennie to join.

SITUATION CHANGED

But mother forgets, and so does
Aunt Suzie, that circumstances are
very different than when they at
tended college. There are eleven
hundred women at Stanford, and
only nine sororities with under 30
members each. There is no getting
around it mathematically—the great
majority of Stanford women do not
live in sororities.
Moreover, sororities have been on
the campus about twenty years since
mother was here. Each year the
number of alumnae has increased,
and with it the sororities' number of
connections and obligations. If so
rorities at present took in all "lega
cies" or women toward whom they
had some fraternal obligation, their
pledge classes would be limited to
practically no one else.
After all, one of the prime aims of
sorority life is living with friends
of one's own choosing. Many sorority
women have friends from home
town or high school whom they
would naturally be more anxious to
have in their living group than an
unknown woman with connections |
through some alumna whom they '
might scarcely have met.
Moreover, under the present rush- i
ing system sorority women and new
women are given so little oppor- '
tunity for normal contact that it is
practically impossible to know i
whether or not the members like a
girl unless they have known her
personally before. Jennie, herself,
is going to have to make some sort
of adjustment. According to ac
cepted techniques of mental hygiene
and sociology there are several i
general principles which she might j
apply.
First of all, if she has been dis- j
appointed, she must find some sort I
of substitute into which to turn her 1
energies and ambitions. If she was
not asked to join the house of her !
choice, another house may furnish
a suitable social medium. Or if she !
was not asked to join any house,
there are any number of activities
to which she can turn her attention.
Friendships formed on student body
committees or athletic teams can be
quite as valuable and permanent as
those of a living group.

SOLUTION PATTERNS

Secondly, she must forget she ever
wanted to join a sorority. The past
is past, and there are problems
enough in the present to utilize all
a person's energies. A former head
sponsor at Ruble once stated that she
owed her success in university ac
tivities to deliberate sublimation of
disappointment at not joining a so
rority into renewed energy to satisfy
ambition through other channels.
Thirdly, she can remember that
the solution she evolves for her pres
ent problem is laying the pattern for
the way she will make far more im
portant adjustments in later life.
Difficult as it is to see the situa
tion sanely at this particular time,
she should try to remember that the
majority of Stanford women are
happy and well adjusted in whatever
type living group they reside, and
that within a surprisingly short time
the whole affair may come to seem
relatively unimportant to her.

FACE SITUATION

Lastly, she must realize that this
is her own problem and she must
face it herself. The protective fam
ily circle in which the majority of
Stanford women have always lived
may not have furnished her ade
quate tools for working out the situ
ation, but she must remember that
she will have to start out on her own
sometime, and that at Stanford she
is a "woman" and not a girl.
Most of all Jennie must face the
situation squarely and should not
evade the question by becoming re
tiring and introverted in order to
avoid future rebuffs. She should re
member it has been proved many
times that equally happy lives may
be led either in the halls or on the
Row.

face it herself. The protective fam
ily circle in which the majority of
Stanford women have always lived
may not have furnished her ade
quate tools for working out the situ
ation, but she must remember that
she will have to start out on her own
sometime, and that at Stanford she
is a "woman" and not a girl.
Most of all Jennie must face the
situation squarely and should not
evade the question by becoming re
tiring and introverted in order to
avoid future rebuffs. She should re
member it has been proved many
times that equally happy lives may
be led either in the halls or on the
Row.

What to do about pledging will be
an important problem at Roble to
night. But the more common if less
dramatic question facing the great
majority of freshman women this
evening is what to do about not
pledging.
Naturally many women who do
not pledge will be living in halls
next year because they sincerely
feel they would most prefer that type
of living group. But just, as natu
rally will there be a certain portion
of tearful lassies up against what
may seem to them now, in spite of
all evidence and advice to the con
trary, the first major personal prob
lem of their lives.
Since they were old enough to
think about college, these troubled
freshmen may have heard glamor
ous tales of the delightful atmos
phere of sorority life. Perhaps
mother or Aunt Suzie was a member
of some particular sorority and is
especially anxious for Jennie to join.

SITUATION CHANGED

But mother forgets, and so does
Aunt Suzie, that circumstances are
very different than when they at
tended college. There are eleven
hundred women at Stanford, and
only nine sororities with under 30
members each. There is no getting
around it mathematically—the great
majority of Stanford women do not
live in sororities.
Moreover, sororities have been on
the campus about twenty years since
mother was here. Each year the
number of alumnae has increased,
and with it the sororities' number of
connections and obligations. If so
rorities at present took in all "lega
cies" or women toward whom they
had some fraternal obligation, their
pledge classes would be limited to
practically no one else.
After all, one of the prime aims of
sorority life is living with friends
of one's own choosing. Many sorority
women have friends from home
town or high school whom they
would naturally be more anxious to
have in their living group than an
unknown woman with connections |
through some alumna whom they '
might scarcely have met.
Moreover, under the present rush- i
ing system sorority women and new
women are given so little oppor- '
tunity for normal contact that it is
practically impossible to know i
whether or not the members like a
girl unless they have known her
personally before. Jennie, herself,
is going to have to make some sort
of adjustment. According to ac
cepted techniques of mental hygiene
and sociology there are several i
general principles which she might j
apply.
First of all, if she has been dis- j
appointed, she must find some sort I
of substitute into which to turn her 1
energies and ambitions. If she was
not asked to join the house of her !
choice, another house may furnish
a suitable social medium. Or if she !
was not asked to join any house,
there are any number of activities
to which she can turn her attention.
Friendships formed on student body
committees or athletic teams can be
quite as valuable and permanent as
those of a living group.

SOLUTION PATTERNS

Secondly, she must forget she ever
wanted to join a sorority. The past
is past, and there are problems
enough in the present to utilize all
a person's energies. A former head
sponsor at Ruble once stated that she
owed her success in university ac
tivities to deliberate sublimation of
disappointment at not joining a so
rority into renewed energy to satisfy
ambition through other channels.
Thirdly, she can remember that
the solution she evolves for her pres
ent problem is laying the pattern for
the way she will make far more im
portant adjustments in later life.
Difficult as it is to see the situa
tion sanely at this particular time,
she should try to remember that the
majority of Stanford women are
happy and well adjusted in whatever
type living group they reside, and
that within a surprisingly short time
the whole affair may come to seem
relatively unimportant to her.

FACE SITUATION

Lastly, she must realize that this
is her own problem and she must

ily circle in which the majority of

ambition through other channels.
Thirdly, she can remember that
the solution she evolves for her pres
ent problem is laying the pattern for
the way she will make far more im
portant adjustments in later life.
Difficult as it is to see the situa
tion sanely at this particular time,
she should try to remember that the
majority of Stanford women are
happy and well adjusted in whatever
type living group they reside, and
that within a surprisingly short time
the whole affair may come to seem
relatively unimportant to her.

FACE SITUATION

Lastly, she must realize that this
is her own problem and she must
face it herself. The protective fam
ily circle in which the majority of
Stanford women have always lived
may not have furnished her ade
quate tools for working out the situ
ation, but she must remember that
she will have to start out on her own
sometime, and that at Stanford she
is a "woman" and not a girl.
Most of all Jennie must face the
situation squarely and should not
evade the question by becoming re
tiring and introverted in order to
avoid future rebuffs. She should re
member it has been proved many
times that equally happy lives may
be led either in the halls or on the
Row.

What to do about pledging will be
an important problem at Roble to
night. But the more common if less
dramatic question facing the great
majority of freshman women this
evening is what to do about not
pledging.
Naturally many women who do
not pledge will be living in halls
next year because they sincerely
feel they would most prefer that type
of living group. But just, as natu
rally will there be a certain portion
of tearful lassies up against what
may seem to them now, in spite of
all evidence and advice to the con
trary, the first major personal prob
lem of their lives.
Since they were old enough to
think about college, these troubled
freshmen may have heard glamor
ous tales of the delightful atmos
phere of sorority life. Perhaps
mother or Aunt Suzie was a member
of some particular sorority and is
especially anxious for Jennie to join.

SITUATION CHANGED

But mother forgets, and so does
Aunt Suzie, that circumstances are
very different than when they at
tended college. There are eleven
hundred women at Stanford, and
only nine sororities with under 30
members each. There is no getting
around it mathematically—the great
majority of Stanford women do not
live in sororities.
Moreover, sororities have been on
the campus about twenty years since
mother was here. Each year the
number of alumnae has increased,
and with it the sororities' number of
connections and obligations. If so
rorities at present took in all "lega
cies" or women toward whom they
had some fraternal obligation, their
pledge classes would be limited to
practically no one else.
After all, one of the prime aims of
sorority life is living with friends
of one's own choosing. Many sorority
women have friends from home
town or high school whom they
would naturally be more anxious to
have in their living group than an
unknown woman with connections |
through some alumna whom they '
might scarcely have met.
Moreover, under the present rush- i
ing system sorority women and new
women are given so little oppor- '
tunity for normal contact that it is
practically impossible to know i
whether or not the members like a
girl unless they have known her
personally before. Jennie, herself,
is going to have to make some sort
of adjustment. According to ac
cepted techniques of mental hygiene
and sociology there are several i
general principles which she might j
apply.
First of all, if she has been dis- j
appointed, she must find some sort I
of substitute into which to turn her 1
energies and ambitions. If she was
not asked to join the house of her !
choice, another house may furnish
a suitable social medium. Or if she !
was not asked to join any house,
there are any number of activities
to which she can turn her attention.
Friendships formed on student body
committees or athletic teams can be
quite as valuable and permanent as
those of a living group.

SOLUTION PATTERNS

Secondly, she must forget she ever
wanted to join a sorority. The past
is past, and there are problems
enough in the present to utilize all
a person's energies. A former head
sponsor at Ruble once stated that she
owed her success in university ac
tivities to deliberate sublimation of
disappointment at not joining a so
rority into renewed energy to satisfy
ambition through other channels.
