What to do about pledging will be
an important problem at Roble to
night. But the more common if less
dramatic question facing the great
majority of freshman women this
evening is what to do about not
pledging.
Naturally many women who do
not pledge will be living in halls
next year because they sincerely
feel they would most prefer that type
of living group. But just, as natu
rally will there be a certain portion
of tearful lassies up against what
may seem to them now, in spite of
all evidence and advice to the con

think about college, these troubled
freshmen may have heard glamor
ous tales of the delightful atmos

hundred women at Stanford, and
only nine sororities with under 30
members each. There is no getting
around it mathematically—the great
majority of Stanford women do not
live in sororities.
Moreover, sororities have been on

number of alumnae has increased,
and with it the sororities' number of
connections and obligations. If so

had some fraternal obligation, their
pledge classes would be limited to
practically no one else.
After all, one of the prime aims of
sorority life is living with friends
of one's own choosing. Many sorority
women have friends from home
town or high school whom they
would naturally be more anxious to
have in their living group than an
