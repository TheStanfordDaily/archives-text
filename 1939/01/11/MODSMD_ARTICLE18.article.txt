# Chaplain to Speak At Luncheon Club
## 
### 
Thomas E. Oliver, acting chaplain
at Stanford in the absence of Dr.
Trueblood, will discuss the Welsh
language and customs at today's
meeting of the Luncheon Club.
Oliver's discussion is being given
in explanation of the living Welsh
language in the recent movie based
on A. J. Cronin's "The Citadel." The
chaplain's talk will be taken from a
background gained from actual work
in Welsh mines similar to those por
trayed in "The Citadel."
"The existence of a Welsh tongue
is often questioned by historians,
who frequently consider it. a dia
lect," says Oliver. "Unlike Gaelic,
the official language of Ireland,
Welsh is a living, spoken language
that has survived in its country due
largely to the opposition it has suf
fered. The official recognition of the
language and encouragement of its
use in universities has probably al
ready sounded its death knell by the
removal of opposition."
