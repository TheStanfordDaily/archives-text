# Military Ball Date Set By Excom
## A.S.S.U. Card Good For Two Sunday Show Admissions, Decision 
### 
Date of the Military Ball this year
will be Feb. 17, and bids may cost
considerably less than $4, the price
originally set, according to action
taken last night at Ex Committee's
first meeting of the quarter.
Jack Nissen, secretary of Scab
bard and Blade, told committee
members the price had been set high
because (1) the dance will feature
a big-name band, and (2) attend
ance at the Military Ball has dwin
dled steeply during the past several
years.
Decision as to whether A.S.S.U.
will underwrite the dance was Jcft
up to Tom Ki liefer, student man
ager, since the budget has not yet
been prepared.
Other business covered last night
included the following:
SUNDAY NIGHT MOVIES: Last
Sunday's showing of "Amphitryon"
and "The River" pleased everyone
except the non-students, who were
turned away at the door. Acting on
complaints of these, Ex Committee
reaffirmed the ruling that a student
body card must be presented when
a ticket is purchased.
Two tickets can be bought with
the same student body card, mem
bers decided. The question came up
when A1 Horn asked, "What does a
student do who wants to bring his
wife and she isn't a student?"
PROM COMPS: Complimentary
bids to the Pledge Prom will be
granted the seven members of the
committee, it was ruled.
OUTSIDER PROBLEM: Because
a drum majorette became center of
a controversy last fall, Ex Commit
tee is busy defining its long-range
policy in the matter of outside stu
dents' participation in student activ
ities.
Hired performers and tradesmen,
such as the Gaieties orchestra and
professional cartoonists for publica
tions, aro not in this group, it was
decided. To find the extent of this
problem, President H. B. Lee ap
pointed Harry Horton and Pat Skin
ner to survey campus activities.
PRE-REG: Lee's appointment of
Ned Pugh as chairman of the pre
reg program next year was ratified
by the committee.
DEBATE MANAGER: Bob Strain
having been graduated, the position
of debate manager was left open.
The committee followed his recom
mendation for a successor and ap
pointed Bob Putnam to the office.
TROPHY CASE: Since Cardinals
haven't been changing contents of
the Cellar trophy case once a week
as they were expected to. Ex Com
mittee turned the job over to the
new Block S Society organized at
the end of last quarter.

handed in his resignation for his
position on Student Aid Commis
sion. The committee approved Lee's
appointment of himself to fill the
