# GRADUATES REPLACED
## 
### 
Six lettermen graduated from last
year's U.S.C. outfit, including two
regular guards, Hal Dornsife and
Hill Remsen, and the first-string
center, Carl Anderson. But the wily
Barry has made more than adequate
replacements for these losses. Gail
Goodrich was switched from his
(list-string forward post to guard
toward the fag end of last year, and
he becomes a starter this year at one
end of the defense posts, teaming
with Tom MeGarvin, a hard-driving
sub who made his letter last year.
Goodrich, a clever ball-handler
and excellent defense man, also fig
ures to be the highest scoring guard
in the conference due to his previous
forward experience. MeGarvin is
the type of player who likes to
rough it up, but he is an ace de
fensive man.
Taking Anderson's place at cen
ter is Dale Sears, who practically
alternated with the former last year
although he didn't start many games.
Sears has been leading the southern
team in scoring so far this season,
having scored 121 points in the
Trojans' first ten games.
