Returning at the forward posts
are two veterans, Ralph Vaughn
and Clem Ruh. Vaughn was pretty
generally overlooked by cage fans
last year clue to the l'act that a gent
named Hank Luisetti was hanging
around, but the southpaw S.C.
speedster scored 174 points to finish
second to Luisetti, and Barry thinks
he has a chance of eventually bet
tering Luisetti's individual record.
He has another year of competition.
Ruh is only 5 feet, 9 inches tall
but he's fast and clever, besides
boasting two years of experience.
However, a dead-eye substitute
forward named Jack Morrison will
probably see plenty of action
against the Cards, and if the Stan
ford defense neglects him to concen
trate on Vaughn or Sears they're
likely to see Morrison do some high
power scoring.
