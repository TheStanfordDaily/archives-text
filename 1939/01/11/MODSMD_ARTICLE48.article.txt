The real thrilling battle of the
evening was that in which Sequoia II
nosed out in the final minutes a
fighting Oriole A.C. quintet, 27-26.
Plenty of points poured through the
hoop in the last period of play and
1 Sequoia's unit, whose main strength
lies in the fact that all its men were
scorers, nosed out its rivals. The
big guns in the Oriole attack were
Franich and Tsoutsouvas, who each
garnered 8 points.
In a game that saw the winners in
full control lor most of the game,
Independents I downed Beta 11, 24
lo 16. Witherly, performing for the
Independent outfit, copped scoring
honors with a total of 10.
