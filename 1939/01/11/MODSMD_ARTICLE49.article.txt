They don't ask for scholarships,
they don't ask for publicity, and they
don't play for glory. Sixty enthus
iastic Stanford students spend two
hours a day playing rugby for the
fun of it, and for fun alone.
Rugby could easily be made a
major or minor sport, but the
men who play it would rather
keep things as they are. The
15.A.C. gives them their equip
ment and tourist class accommo
dations on their trips. The play
ers appreciate the donation and
ask no more.
Even the coaches donate their
services, in fact, go to considerable
expense and inconvenience to leave
their businesses to attend daily
practice sessions from 4 to 6 o'clock
on the frosh football field.
JliVl WYLIE, head coach, played
against Stanford on two interna
tional teams in the days when rugby
was the only major sport of its kind.
After playing first for Australia and
iater for New Zealand against the
Indians, he became a Stanford stu
dent himself. His business is now
in San Jose, and he closes his of
five at 4 we£k days and Saturday
afternoons to coach the Card rug
gers.
WILLARD CLAUSEN, an assist
ant coach, is a San Francisco geol
ogist who once played for Stanford.
He drives to the campus each alter-,
noon without compensation.
NORMAN CLiEAVELAND, also
an assistant, played both rugby and
American football at Stanford. His
business keeps him in Red Bluff,
but he flies down as often as pos
sible to contribute his services on
the rugby field.
Rugby is supervised by Harry
Maloney, minor sports director, who
has had considerable rugby expe
rience and is now president of the
California Rugby Union.
