## 
### 
The Ram's Head plaque, symbol
of Big Game skit-writing superiority
and long bandied about, with start
ling changes in locale, has at last
been discovered nestling in the pos
session of Gene Krupa, famed drum
star and orchestra leader.
The cubnination of the search for
this traditional Gaieties relic will
come Thursday night at the Shali
mar Bowl in San Francisco. Pres
entation of the trophy to a member
of Stanford Stagers will be made by
Krupa himself, although the famed
drummer has not promised to reveal
the manner in which i< came into
his possession.
