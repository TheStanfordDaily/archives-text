into popularity in 1917. Stanford
and California agreed to add it to
the list, but not to give up rugby.

rial, and went to Antwerp in 1920,
became Olympics champs, and re
peated their victory in 1924, at the
Olympic Games in Paris.
Ending in a blaze of glory, rugby
suddenly lost its grip at Stanford,
and it was not until six years ago
that Maloney and other interested
parties revived the sport. Since
then, Cal and Stanford had alter
nated annual trips to British Colum
bia until financial arrangements
could not be made satisfactory
enough to warrant Stanford taking
its turn during l the last Christmas
vacation.
