# IT'S A ROUGH GAME BUT EASY TO LEARN
## 
### 
! Whiie players must be in fine
I condition to take the knocks, rugby
is easy to learn. As one Stanford
football star observed as he was
leaving the first practice session,
i "They blow the whistle to call 60
men together—many of them have
never seen a game—and 10 minutes
later we're holding scrimmage."
i There are 15 men on a team, and
i they do more running than any
| thing else. Spirit cannot help but
run high, because the boys are out
there for their own entertainment,
i They are determined to win games
| in two leagues and against Prince
ton University, who will oppose the
| Indians at the Exposition on Stan
| ford Day. April 8.
i While the game is rapidly increas
i ing in popularity, rugby is not a big
! sport from the standpoint of gate
receipts, and the team won't help
! much to put Stanford on the map.
! But it is a rare satisfaction to know
■ that Stanford men are willing to de
-1 vote their time and energy to ath
; letics for the joy of competition—
S that Stanford athletes are playing
; for fun.
