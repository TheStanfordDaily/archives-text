# Gymnasts Prepare for Cal Tilt
## 
### 
"Gymnastic team members and
the team as a whole have been shap
ing up surprising well due to fre
quent conscientious workouts."
jSuch was the semi-pleased state
ment made public yesterday by Ken
Edwards, coach of the Cardinal
gymnastic team. "All elforts," he
continued, are being directed toward
a tentative meet which we hope to
hold with California sometime about
two weeks before the end of win
ter quarter."
With Frank, Jesberg, Kittell, Met- |
calf and Sanders, last year's trust
ies, forming the squad skeleton.
Coach Edwards has been filling in
the vacancy gaps with additional j

and much needed material which
has come to the fore in the per
sonages of George Mann, Van
Dorn, and Johnny Seamans.
Under the able tutoring of Myron
Sprague team tumblers have been
developing back breaking flip-flops
which are expected to add many
meet points to Farm scores. Out
standing among tryout tumblers are
Lomax Turner, yell leader, Bill
Grannis, and Johnny Seamans.
Except for the Cal meet, which
will probably be held at Berkeley,
no other meets have been scheduled
| during this quarter since true gym
nastic season does not officially.open
until this spring. Scarcity of neigh
boring gym teams has made any
i practice meets next to impossible.
