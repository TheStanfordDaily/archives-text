# Who's Made of Money

AMAZINGLY enough, the winter quarter
date scramble has been unscrambled to
the satisfaction of everyone. Scabbard and
Blade rides out of the ruck with the first big
dance date, the juniors have slid into spring
quarter, and the seniors have picked off the
last open date before finals for their "Back to
the Farm" Prom.
So, black as the outlook was a few days ago,
everything is fine now. Except for the campus
who is to attend the Scabbard and Blade dance.
At the projected $4.00 per bid, the campus is
stuck, and stuck hard.
And very few reasons can justify the* price.
In recent years, the career of Scabbard and
Blade functions has been checkered, to speak
lightly. Gradually declining in campus at
tendance, the dance last year was finally called
off with a spare 20 bids sold. Now Scabbard
is attempting to recoup.
But in the attempt, Stanford is left with the
unfortunate choice of paying an exorbitant
rate for the dance, or not going. And the
alternative is too easy to figure out.
The very price which Scabbard's dance com
mittee has set denotes its own doubt of suc
cess. It evidently expects a small crowd, hopes
to make up the difference by the high cost of
bids, a negative, as well as shaky, basis on
which to plan.
With their favorable spot on the calendar—
the first big dance—and with the recent ex
ample of the Soph Cotillion which made money
with a moderately scaled bid price, Scabbard
is trying to make money the hard way. Know
ing the campus, it should be able to count on
a financial success with the dance it plans—
if it does not overreach itself by charging too
much.
And 54.00 is too much.
