# Mother Sheds a Tear
## 
### 
WHILE, on the Farm, sororities and Roble
are maintaining a one-day silence before
the storm, the tempest raging outside the walls
is anything but quiet. Unless this year is an
exception, fond mothers and doting patrons of
Susie Freshman are biting their nails even
more furiously than the girls themselves. Even
The Daily draws up a list of consolation prizes
for the girls who don't.
And, when pledge lists finally come out,
while Stanford has relaxed and is rapidly for
getting the hysterics and the disappointments,
the fond mothers and doting patrons will be
posting air-mail-special-delivery letters of wrath,
sympathy gone wrong, and vengeance. For
months, Susie Hallgirl will be greeted by the
exclamation of her S.C. friends, "Oh, didn't you
pledge? spoken in a tone of voice which indi
cates that she has just broken out with a slight
case of leprosy.
Alumni who tucked Susie under their wings
will be withering house presidents with pointed
allusions to the mentality of the women who
let Susie slip by. And mothers will make the
poor girl miserable by recounting how she
pledged Sappa anyhow.
These are the exceptional cases exemplify
ing the system. But our local statistician reports,
to date, over 50 long distance phone calls into
Roble in one night, and numerous telegrams
to sponsors—the storm is breaking. And from
this attitude of these outsiders, spoken or im
plied, comes more misery than the girls can
hatch up themselves.
These too-well-meaning godmothers, basing
their knowledge of Stanford's sorority situation
on that of other Alma Maters, completely over
look the point that, qualifications aside, only
a very small percentage of girls can possibly
hope to move into the limited group of Stan
ford sororities. There isn't room. And they
base their sympathy for the girl who misses
on the rigid attitudes of former days, when to
miss pledging was actually an indication that
the girl was a misfit.
They can't understand that those days are
gone forever.
But no girl need quench her own sensible
outlook to take on the misplaced frustration
which these mothers and foster-mothers offer
with open hands. For the moment, their false
identification with Susie Hallgirl is as patho
logical and as illusory as any paranoidal case
in Agnews.
Tn the words of the too-well-read tot of ten,
who scorched a wailing four-year-old acquaint
ance, Susie Hallgirl may turn sweetly to the
matriarchal mourner's bench and say: "You're
Freudian,"

the girl was a misfit.
They can't understand that those days are
gone forever.
But no girl need quench her own sensible
outlook to take on the misplaced frustration
which these mothers and foster-mothers offer
with open hands. For the moment, their false
identification with Susie Hallgirl is as patho
logical and as illusory as any paranoidal case
in Agnews.
Tn the words of the too-well-read tot of ten,
who scorched a wailing four-year-old acquaint
ance, Susie Hallgirl may turn sweetly to the
matriarchal mourner's bench and say: "You're
Freudian,"
WHILE, on the Farm, sororities and Roble
are maintaining a one-day silence before
the storm, the tempest raging outside the walls
is anything but quiet. Unless this year is an
exception, fond mothers and doting patrons of
Susie Freshman are biting their nails even
more furiously than the girls themselves. Even
The Daily draws up a list of consolation prizes
for the girls who don't.
And, when pledge lists finally come out,
while Stanford has relaxed and is rapidly for
getting the hysterics and the disappointments,
the fond mothers and doting patrons will be
posting air-mail-special-delivery letters of wrath,
sympathy gone wrong, and vengeance. For
months, Susie Hallgirl will be greeted by the
exclamation of her S.C. friends, "Oh, didn't you
pledge? spoken in a tone of voice which indi
cates that she has just broken out with a slight
case of leprosy.
Alumni who tucked Susie under their wings
will be withering house presidents with pointed
allusions to the mentality of the women who
let Susie slip by. And mothers will make the
poor girl miserable by recounting how she
pledged Sappa anyhow.
These are the exceptional cases exemplify
ing the system. But our local statistician reports,
to date, over 50 long distance phone calls into
Roble in one night, and numerous telegrams
to sponsors—the storm is breaking. And from
this attitude of these outsiders, spoken or im
plied, comes more misery than the girls can
hatch up themselves.
These too-well-meaning godmothers, basing
their knowledge of Stanford's sorority situation
on that of other Alma Maters, completely over
look the point that, qualifications aside, only
a very small percentage of girls can possibly
hope to move into the limited group of Stan
ford sororities. There isn't room. And they
base their sympathy for the girl who misses
on the rigid attitudes of former days, when to
miss pledging was actually an indication that
the girl was a misfit.
They can't understand that those days are
gone forever.
