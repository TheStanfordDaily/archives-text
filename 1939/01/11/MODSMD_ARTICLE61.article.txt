IIELL ON WHEELS
IJOLLER skating, I understand, has swept over the
Stanford campus in a psychological tidal wave
that neither dignity nor timidity could withstand.
Merry bands of carefree youngsters skim the side
walks, taking pedestrians in their stride with the
nonchalance of a French aristocrat whose barouche
happened to knock off a couple of the peasantry. It
is a pleasant and peaceful scPhe, like something out
of a children's book. But it cannot last. It is only
a question of days now before WomeiVs Conference
decides to abolish roller skating on the grounds that
it has an undesirable influence on Stanford women.
The sport seems well entrenched. Laughing stu
dents haul themselves out of ditches. Bashful girls
evade the question of where it hurt. As The Daily
expressed it, "parts of Stanford have gone hog-wild on
roller skates." But the neat, feminine handwriting is
on the wall, and at any time now it will be transcribed
to the minute book.
<t # Jfr #
The whole thing is really none of my business.
I gave up skating at the age of eight, when I coasted
backwards down a flight of stone steps and rico
cheted off the sidewalk into a rosebush. But I feel
that it is only Christian charity to warn students
who are contemplating investing in a pair of skates.
I realize also that on first examination roller skat
ing looks hs innocent as a bed-time story. It. involves
exercise .fresh air, sunshine, vitamins, and all the
other things that are supposed to be good for growing
bodies. It builds healthy mental attitudes; and it would
not, be an overstatement to say that immoi'ality on
roller skates is practically impossible. Apparently it
merges all the best, principles of democracy, psychiatry,
and medicine.
* * # *
OUT considered from the Conference angle, skating
is revealed as a deadly menace. In the first place,
women skate; therefore Conference has complete jur
isdiction over the sport. And observe the subtle men- '
ace. A girl who skates cannot possibly expect to main
tain that standard of dignity and poise which we wish
Stanford women to display to the world. The law of
averages says that she will spend at least part of the
time on her ear. Are we to permit visitors to the
campus to judge Stanford women by the on-their-ear
conduct of those few representatives they see about
the sidewalks?
More than that, the prospect of falling, or' the
fear of seeing a friend take a bite out of the curb,
would undoubtedly have a nasty psychological effect
on the girls. Probably the freshmen would become
hysterical, and that must be avoided at any price.
* * * *
Clinching the argument is the symbolism of skat
ing. A girl on skates admittedly moves fast; that is a
simple matter of physics. And the first principle of
the social regulations is that a Stanford woman is
never fast-
It is obvious, then, where the duty of Conference
lies. And Conference does not shirk its duty.

decides to abolish roller skating on the grounds that
it has an undesirable influence on Stanford women.
The sport seems well entrenched. Laughing stu
dents haul themselves out of ditches. Bashful girls
evade the question of where it hurt. As The Daily
expressed it, "parts of Stanford have gone hog-wild on
roller skates." But the neat, feminine handwriting is
on the wall, and at any time now it will be transcribed
to the minute book.

The whole thing is really none of my business.
I gave up skating at the age of eight, when I coasted
backwards down a flight of stone steps and rico
cheted off the sidewalk into a rosebush. But I feel
that it is only Christian charity to warn students
who are contemplating investing in a pair of skates.
I realize also that on first examination roller skat
ing looks hs innocent as a bed-time story. It. involves
exercise .fresh air, sunshine, vitamins, and all the
other things that are supposed to be good for growing
bodies. It builds healthy mental attitudes; and it would
not, be an overstatement to say that immoi'ality on
roller skates is practically impossible. Apparently it
merges all the best, principles of democracy, psychiatry,
and medicine.

OUT considered from the Conference angle, skating
is revealed as a deadly menace. In the first place,
women skate; therefore Conference has complete jur
isdiction over the sport. And observe the subtle men- '
ace. A girl who skates cannot possibly expect to main
tain that standard of dignity and poise which we wish
Stanford women to display to the world. The law of
averages says that she will spend at least part of the
time on her ear. Are we to permit visitors to the
campus to judge Stanford women by the on-their-ear
conduct of those few representatives they see about
the sidewalks?
More than that, the prospect of falling, or' the
fear of seeing a friend take a bite out of the curb,
would undoubtedly have a nasty psychological effect
on the girls. Probably the freshmen would become
hysterical, and that must be avoided at any price.
* * * *
Clinching the argument is the symbolism of skat
ing. A girl on skates admittedly moves fast; that is a
simple matter of physics. And the first principle of
the social regulations is that a Stanford woman is
never fast-
It is obvious, then, where the duty of Conference
lies. And Conference does not shirk its duty.
IIELL ON WHEELS
IJOLLER skating, I understand, has swept over the
Stanford campus in a psychological tidal wave
that neither dignity nor timidity could withstand.
Merry bands of carefree youngsters skim the side
walks, taking pedestrians in their stride with the
nonchalance of a French aristocrat whose barouche
happened to knock off a couple of the peasantry. It
is a pleasant and peaceful scPhe, like something out
of a children's book. But it cannot last. It is only
a question of days now before WomeiVs Conference
decides to abolish roller skating on the grounds that
it has an undesirable influence on Stanford women.
