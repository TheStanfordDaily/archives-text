NO SYLLABUS FEES
A few of Stanford's fraternity girls started thinking
about it Christmas vacation. They pot out their note
books and did a little calculating, a litlle addition and
multiplication. They got their boy friends over and
had them work it out on their slide rules.
And came to the conclusion that it cost no more to
spend winter quarter at the famed Sun Valley than
it did to spend it at Stanford.
And went to Sun Valley.

I'LL TRY IT
A graduate from one of the Oregon colleges (who
ever knows which Oregon school anyone goes to) was
visiting the campus. A friend of hers here was going
to the Library.
"Going to the Library?" the gal from Oregon asked
with some amazement. "What arc you going to the
Library for?"
"To study, of course."
"Study! We go to the Libe to get dates!"

AMERICAN COLLOQUIALISM
One of last year's frosh had a rather confusing way
of signing the Honor Code. He would write an exam
and then sign the ever-present, designated line with a
bouyant:
"You know me."

PICTURE
A friend of mine was telling me the other day
about, the time, when he was in high school, that a
club he was in went to San Francisco or someplace
for an inter-club conference.
When they got there their chapcrones told them
they couldn't leave their hotel rooms that night. The
order had something to do with an important meeting
coming up the next, day which they had to be in
shape for.
All right, said the high school boy, and they
sneaked one of their members out the back door to
get the grog. They would have a party in their rooms.
So the guy came staggering back loaded with bottles
and got them safely into the rooms. But the chap
crones were pretty wise. They patrolled. They saw
that nothing more boisterous than dirty jokes told with
French tag lines went on. Sooner or later, realizing
the futility of their situation, the high school kids
went to bed.
Heaving a sigh of relief, the chapcrones did like
wise. The next morning they got up and went down
to breakfast. Waiting for the kids to come down, they
were congratulating themselves on the success they
had had in keeping the forces of law and order.
When one by one the kids started coming in to
breakfast. Only they weren't just coming in. They
were weaving in. Staggering in. They were all drunk
as lords.
They had got up at 4 o'clock in the grey of the
dawn to have their party.
