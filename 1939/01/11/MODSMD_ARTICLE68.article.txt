The Editor, Sir:
1 want to add my piotest to those
who cannot quietly accept the idea
of a Hoover tower dominating Stan
ford University campus. It will
stand only as a monument of
wounded vanity. Much as we
would sympathize with the gnaw- j
ing disappointments of anyone's ego,
the beautiful uniformity of our be
loved campus should not be the I
scene of the holocaust. I should sug
gest to the late President, the fin
ancing of the new hospital wing,
an adjacent home for nurses, etc. '
Let the Hoover Library, I repeat,
financed by the University, be built
to conform with the architectural
plan of the University.

Trial by jury was originated by
the Normans.
