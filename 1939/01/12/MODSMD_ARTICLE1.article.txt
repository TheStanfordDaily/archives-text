### Larry Livingston 
| I OOD news comes to those who
dreamed last night of bombing
planes over London, who imagined
lines of trenches advancing south
ward from the Rhine, who thought
they saw the towers of Notre Dame
crash down upon thousands of
praying Parisians.
Mussolini has backed down. When
he met with Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain in Rome yesterday, 11
Duce did not strike his fist on the
table and reiterate his demand for
parcels of France's African colonies.
Instead he declared his conviction
that Italy's "natural aspirations" can
be satisfied without claiming any
French territory.
In contrast to the militant Fas
cist attitude of last week, yester
day Signor Mussolini met Mr.
Chamberlain with soft-spoken
avowals of a desire for peaceful
settlement of the problem and a
general God-kless-you-all atti
tude. Just what form Italy's non
terirtorial demands will take re
mains to be revealed today in the
second of the four-day series of
meetings.
Banqueting and back-slapping,
symbolic of friendly relations be
tween Britain and Italy, took up
most of the time yesterday, but from
now on the world's spotlight will
play on Rome's Palazzo Venizia,
awaiting definite results of the meet
ing of Mussolini and Chamberlain.
At all costs, we can be sure that
II Duce realizes he dare not provoke
a European war. And we, inside the
Jgoldfish bowl, can breath easily
again.

■ N Washington yesterday the
Senate subcommittee, consider
ing the nomination of Professor
Felix Frankfurter to the Supreme
Court, listened to the testimony of
Mrs. Elizabeth Hilling. Evidently,
shortly before Mrs. Hilling was
horn, her mother was frightened
by a Red-baiter.
With all the annoying assuredness
of a Dies Committee member, the
woman author of "Red Network"
not only referred to Frankfurter as
an "associate of revolutionaries,"
but also glibly offered to prove that
President and Mrs. Roosevelt, Re
publican Leader Glenn Frank, and
Associate Justices Brandeis and
Stone are dangerous radicals.
After listening impatiently to this
self-constituted authority on the Red
menace, it. will be a treat for the
committee to listen to Dr. Frank
furter himself, when he replies today
;*to the criticism that has been lev
elled against him. The contrast
should be great.

A NOTIIER of President Roose
velt's new appointees was on
the carpet yesterday. Harry L.
Hopkins staunchly defended his
actions and policies as head of
the WPA, in the hearing of a Sen
ate committee considering his ap
pointment as Secretary of Com
merce.
Yes, he had made mistakes, ad
mitted Mr. Hopkins, but. they were
honest mistakes, and he never
forced relief workers to vote New
Deal of used WPA funds for polit
ical purposes. Yes, he had made
political speeches in the recent pri
maries, but he realized he had made
a mistake in doing so.
No, he never made the statement,
attributed to him, that "We will
spend and spend, tax and tax, and
elect and elect." Mr. Hopkins of
fers no apologies for his adminis
tration.
At # *
help the Jews in Germany.
It looks like they're in for it
again. Shots were fired during the
past week into the German Con
sulate at. Amsterdam and into the
legation at The Hague, and natur
ally the Nazis assume that it was !
the work of the international Jew- !
, ish menace.
Just as a barbaric anti-Semitic
drive followed the assasination of j
Diplomat Von Itath by a Polish i
Jew in Paris two months ago. so
today fierce reprisals are expected '
to result from these new incidents, j
Although the guilty parties have I
never been discovered, Nazi logic 1
precludes their being anything •
but noil-Aryans. Ami so again the i
Jews will suffer.

f ITERRORIST clashes on the Hun- i
garian - Czechoslovak frontier
were resumed yesterday after a si
lence on that front since Sunday.
The presses of the two nations in- !
volved rather naturally name each
other as the aggressor. Certain it is
that hand grenades, machine guns, !
and rifles were used in a three-hour I
battle at Bervinkos in Ruthenia, near
the scene of last week-end's fracas, |
and two Czechs were wounded.
It is difficult to judge whether this i
is a case of a Hungarian attempt to ]
carry out a plan to extend her fron- !
tier to Poland by grabbing Ruthenia, !
or a Czech move with German back- ,
ing, to regain the village of Mun- i
kaes and the region around it as a
base for Hitler's advance into the j
Ukraine.
In Spain. Insurgent forces re-
Mimed their momentarily inter- j
rupted drive to victory yesterday.
