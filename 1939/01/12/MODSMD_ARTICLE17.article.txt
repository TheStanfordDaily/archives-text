## 
### 
Considering the Monroe Doctrine and its' present relation to Latin
American affairs, Rafael Valle, of the University of Mexico and Hon
orary Curator of the Hoover War Library, gave an address in the audi
torium of the Education building yesterday afternoon.
"We of Hispanic-America," said Professor Valle. "have pledged our-

►selves to Democracy; and in view
|of I lie co-operative altitude dis
j played during the Lima conference
i and of (he Good Neighbor policy, we
j are convinced that the Monroe Doc
: trine will in the future be a guaran-
I tee of our continental solidarity."

DOCTRINE AS CLOAK

Professor Valle pointed out that
the doctrine had its beginning as a
declaration of American foreign pol
icy against possible .European ag
gression, and traced it to its pres
ent status in this hemisphere as a
guarantee against Fascist and Com
munistic invasion.
"Since 1823, Latin-American coun
frics have been subjected to inroads
under the guise of the Carribbean
policy and dollar diplomacy, which
with the cloak of the Monroe Doc
trine have served to exonerate the
violent and aggressive acts of Amer
ican financial and political interests
in the southern hemisphere.
"The result of such a precedent,"
continued the professor, "was to
make Latin-Americans suspicious to
all the plans this country made with
regard to its southern neighbors."

NEW ATTITUDE

Dr. Vallc explained that with the
inauguration of Roosevelt's Good
Neighbor Policy thi.s feeling has lost
its emphasis but still presents the
biggest stumbling block on the road
to perfect harmony in the hem
isphere.
Commenting on the results of the
Lima Conference of last month, Dr.
Valle said that. Ihe signatures on the
Declaration of Inter-American Sol
idarity implied no obligation for
direct action.
"It merely reflects an attitude,"
said the professor, "but. nevertheless
it is definite evidence of a new
western consciousness which is vital
in the development of an effective
democratic front."

EUROPEAN INFLUENCE

Pointing to recent, European in
fluences in South American states,
Dr. Valle showed that they were in
part, clue to trade relations which
inevitably bring nations closer to
get her.
"Furthermore," concluded the pro
fessor, "we must remember that
many cultural ties link our conti
nent with Europe, but the significant
attribute is the predominant, belief
in democracy, and the growing will
ingness of Latin-America to sup
port the Roosevelt program against
possible Fascist and Communist in
roads.

"It merely reflects an attitude,"
said the professor, "but. nevertheless
it is definite evidence of a new
western consciousness which is vital
in the development of an effective
democratic front."

EUROPEAN INFLUENCE

Pointing to recent, European in
fluences in South American states,
Dr. Valle showed that they were in
part, clue to trade relations which
inevitably bring nations closer to
get her.
"Furthermore," concluded the pro
fessor, "we must remember that
many cultural ties link our conti
nent with Europe, but the significant
attribute is the predominant, belief
in democracy, and the growing will
ingness of Latin-America to sup
port the Roosevelt program against
possible Fascist and Communist in
roads.
Considering the Monroe Doctrine and its' present relation to Latin
American affairs, Rafael Valle, of the University of Mexico and Hon
orary Curator of the Hoover War Library, gave an address in the audi
torium of the Education building yesterday afternoon.
"We of Hispanic-America," said Professor Valle. "have pledged our-

►selves to Democracy; and in view
|of I lie co-operative altitude dis
j played during the Lima conference
i and of (he Good Neighbor policy, we
j are convinced that the Monroe Doc
: trine will in the future be a guaran-
I tee of our continental solidarity."

DOCTRINE AS CLOAK

Professor Valle pointed out that
the doctrine had its beginning as a
declaration of American foreign pol
icy against possible .European ag
gression, and traced it to its pres
ent status in this hemisphere as a
guarantee against Fascist and Com
munistic invasion.
"Since 1823, Latin-American coun
frics have been subjected to inroads
under the guise of the Carribbean
policy and dollar diplomacy, which
with the cloak of the Monroe Doc
trine have served to exonerate the
violent and aggressive acts of Amer
ican financial and political interests
in the southern hemisphere.
"The result of such a precedent,"
continued the professor, "was to
make Latin-Americans suspicious to
all the plans this country made with
regard to its southern neighbors."

NEW ATTITUDE

Dr. Vallc explained that with the
inauguration of Roosevelt's Good
Neighbor Policy thi.s feeling has lost
its emphasis but still presents the
biggest stumbling block on the road
to perfect harmony in the hem
isphere.
Commenting on the results of the
Lima Conference of last month, Dr.
Valle said that. Ihe signatures on the
Declaration of Inter-American Sol
idarity implied no obligation for
direct action.
