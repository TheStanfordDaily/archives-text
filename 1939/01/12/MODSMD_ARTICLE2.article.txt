# 'Tobias' Cast To Repeat Play Tonight
## Good Performances, Excellent Costuming, Marked by Reviewer 
### JOHN FLAHERTY 
Unless the chubby and naive To
bias, his dog, and his guardian angel
have changed radically since they
first came to Stanford last quarter,
their return tonight will be as de
lightful as their first appearance.
With its charming fantasy, sly
irrepressible wit, and rich mixture
of legend and realistic dialogue,
James Bridie's "Tobias and the An
gel" can hardly miss. And given a
skillful performance by Stanford's
own embryonic repertory company,
the bet is an even safer one that
the repeat performance will still
leave parts of the audience crying
for more.
In a rather subtle way, "Tobias"
is very nearly the smoothest piece
of work yet done by the division.
Not only are individual portions of
the show carried out with technical
skill and directorial grace, but the
parts combine into an excellently
smooth whole.
Dan Holtom's Tobias, Doug Bry
an's work as the Archangel Raphael,
and Kae Kalcnborn's part as the
young wife were particularly out
standing. And yet, in view of Rob
ert Coombs' work as the garrulous
old Tobit, Melba Toombs' part as his
wife, and the host of smaller parts,
it is more and more necessary to
emphasize the group work which
wove a delightful evening from the
play.
Costumes and settings, glittering
and imaginative, m;ide a picture set
ting before which unfolded the
Marco-Polocsque talcs of Tobias
and the Fish, Tobias and the Wicked
Robber, Tobias and the Beautiful
Princess, Tobias and the Demon,
and, in short, "Tobias and the An
gel."
Because of the imminence of
finals when young Tobias first walk
ed the stage of Memorial Hall, more
missed the show than snw it. Hence
the repeat performance. And, from
a reviewer's point, of view, it's a
fine idea. No one but. a confirmed
misanthrope can fail to bubble over
the tongue-in-cheek twist to the
old legend, the dialogue which
bursts like popcorn in the faces of
the audience, and the quietly expert
handling of the performance by the
cast, technical crew, and director.
Statistically, the curtain rises at
8:15 o'clock with tickets at 50 cents
for all scats in the hall.
