# Party Heads Push F.R.'s Relief Bill
## Democrat Leaders Rally to Support First New Deal Test 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP).—
Administration leaders rallied forces
in a rebellious house tonight in an
attempt to restore $150,000,000
trimmed from President Roosevelt's
$875,000,000 deficiency relief bill and
thus win the first test of New Deal
strength in the 76th Congress.
The issue was precipitated when a
House appropriations subcommittee
led by Representative Clifton A.
Woodrum, D., Va., reduced the sum
asked by Mr. Roosevelt despite
v/amings that u smaller appropria
tion will force several hundred thou
sand persons' oft' the relief rolls.
The explosive issue comes to the
floor tomorrow under right-of-way
status maneuvered by Majority
Leader Sam Rayburn who hopes to
force a final vote by Friday night.
Rayburn won a pledge from both
Democrats and Republicans that de
bate will be limited to 10 hours,
after which amendments will be
offered.

CIVIL service issue

In addition to reducing the appro
priation, the subcommittee inserted
a provision blocking the president's
executive order that 33.000 WPA ad
ministrative workers be placed under
civil service and added a restriction
requiring that the appropriation last
until June 30, end of the present
fiscal year.
The action brought sharp criticism
from Mr. Roosevelt who warned
human misery will follow. It also
brought a deluge of telegrams and
letters from state and municipal
officials and congressmen who de
manded the president's full request
be voted.
The administration leaders were
counting on this "pressure" to bring
recalcitrants into line before the final
vote.

CANNON LEADS FIGHT

Representative Clarence Cannon,
D., Mo., high-ranking member of
the appropriations committee, was
charged by the administration with
leading the fight to obtain the full
$875,000,000. Cannon originally pro
posed the committee vote only $300,-
000,000 to carry WPA until April 1
alter which new funds could be
sought on the basis of needs.
He conferred privately with Presi
dent Roosevelt and House leaders in
the interim and is convinced $875,-
000,000 is "the minimum" needed and
must be voted.

dent Roosevelt and House leaders in
the interim and is convinced $875,-
000,000 is "the minimum" needed and
must be voted.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP).—
Administration leaders rallied forces
in a rebellious house tonight in an
attempt to restore $150,000,000
trimmed from President Roosevelt's
$875,000,000 deficiency relief bill and
thus win the first test of New Deal
strength in the 76th Congress.
The issue was precipitated when a
House appropriations subcommittee
led by Representative Clifton A.
Woodrum, D., Va., reduced the sum
asked by Mr. Roosevelt despite
v/amings that u smaller appropria
tion will force several hundred thou
sand persons' oft' the relief rolls.
The explosive issue comes to the
floor tomorrow under right-of-way
status maneuvered by Majority
Leader Sam Rayburn who hopes to
force a final vote by Friday night.
Rayburn won a pledge from both
Democrats and Republicans that de
bate will be limited to 10 hours,
after which amendments will be
offered.

CIVIL service issue

In addition to reducing the appro
priation, the subcommittee inserted
a provision blocking the president's
executive order that 33.000 WPA ad
ministrative workers be placed under
civil service and added a restriction
requiring that the appropriation last
until June 30, end of the present
fiscal year.
The action brought sharp criticism
from Mr. Roosevelt who warned
human misery will follow. It also
brought a deluge of telegrams and
letters from state and municipal
officials and congressmen who de
manded the president's full request
be voted.
The administration leaders were
counting on this "pressure" to bring
recalcitrants into line before the final
vote.

CANNON LEADS FIGHT

Representative Clarence Cannon,
D., Mo., high-ranking member of
the appropriations committee, was
charged by the administration with
leading the fight to obtain the full
$875,000,000. Cannon originally pro
posed the committee vote only $300,-
000,000 to carry WPA until April 1
alter which new funds could be
sought on the basis of needs.
He conferred privately with Presi
dent Roosevelt and House leaders in
the interim and is convinced $875,-
000,000 is "the minimum" needed and
must be voted.
