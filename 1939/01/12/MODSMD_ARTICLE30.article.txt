# Mutiny Charges Will Be Probed

HOLLYWOOD. Jan. 11 (UP). â€”
The treasure cruise of a Hollywood
countess and the late Jean Harlow's
step-father, who hired greenhorn
sailors to sail a "hell ship" to the
South Seas, was described today to
the federal grand jury which was
trying to decide whether two of the
crew members were mutineers or
martyrs.
The schooner Metha Nelson was
towed into port yesterday, not so
good as she was last October when
Marino Bello and the Countess
Dorothy Di Frasso sailed her out of
the harbor and smacked into the
breakwater. In answer to subpoenas
handed them when they stepped
ashore, all 22 crew members and
Capt. R. B. Hoffman, the skipper,
appeared at the federal building to
tell conflicting stories.
Captain Hoffman affirmed there
was mutiny aplenty and he clapped
several of his men in irons. He de
nied he had requested the arrest of
Kappellner and Charles Segal.
These two, neither one a seafarer,
were arrested and charged with mu
tiny in federal complaints after they
returned home on another boat sev
eral weeks ago.
