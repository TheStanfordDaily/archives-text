There has never been a time when

i was "de trop" on the Stanford eam

I chicken had found a quiet nook in
' the Phi Delt house for some two

j months it's time to see what's going
1 on here.
The complete history of Leader—
| that was the name of the illustrious
j bird—is surrounded in mystery but
| some few pointers came to light
j after a lengthy investigation.
It seems that some Beta got the
I idea last September that a little life
1 was needed around the place with
! the result that Leader was brought
home from a Palo Alto chicken farm.
I In her veins, however, was the
j blood of the wanderer, and in a
; couple of weeks the noble creature
| turned to patrolling the lawn be
| tween the Phi Delts and the D.G.'s.
Unfortunately the Phi Delts were
j unaccustomed to nursing chickens,
I and in late November the great
| Leader was seen wending her way
1 up the hill toward the Zete house.
Rumor has it that the once cher
j ished bird met the end of her trail
j there as a dainty tidbit in one of
i their Sunday suppers.
