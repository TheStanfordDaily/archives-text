# Troy Cage Go Will Reunite Prep Stars
## Phil Zonne to Face Morrison, Olson, Ex-L.A. Teammates 
### 
An interesting sidelight to the '
Stanford-Southern California series :
this week-end will be the reunion of
several cage siars who played to
gether several years ago for Los An
geles High on what is generally con
ceded to be one of the finest high
school teams ever assembled in
southern California.
Phil Zonne, Stanford's captain ,
and team backbone, and Jack Mor
rison and Dean Olson of the Trojan '
squad are the former team-mates i
who will be on opposite sides of the
fence tomorrow and Saturday [
nights. They were the mainstays of j
a team that went undefeated through
its practice and league schedules to i
a city championship.

HIGH SCHOOL STARS

Other stars of the same team who '
became collegiate aces are Harley i
Humes, regular forward at U.C.L.A.
this year; Harry Holt, who made his 1
letter for the Bruins last year; Bob!
Carley, who became a flash at Oc
cidental College; and Pete McAr- .
thur, present senior at Stanford who |
made his Papoose numeral in 1936
but turned to baseball after his I
frosh year.
Yesterday Coach Everett Dean
again drilled the Indian on both of
fense and defense against U.S.C.'s
set-up. The Indians continued to ;
show improvement in both their
man-to-man defensive assignments 1
and in smoother ball handling on
olTense, and on top of that Zonne j
seems to have permanently recov- i
ered his shooting form.

ZONNE IN STRIDE

In practice all week Phil has been
dumping in baskets with the same
form he displayed last year, but
strangely lacking in Stanford's early
season games. His 21-point per
formance against Santa Clara last
week is the best offensive effort any
season, and stamps him as one of
the southern divisions' outstanding
hoopsters.
The first string remains the same,
with Leon Lafaille, Bill Rapp, Kenny
Davidson, and Bobby Burnett team
ing with Zonne. Lafaille, Burnett
and Davidson have spent the last
couple of nights in the Rest Home
trying to brush off the effects of
colds. All of them will be in shape
for the Trojans.

BURNESS SEES ACTION

Don Burness scrimmaged at guard
with the second team Jast night, with
the rest of the team composed of
Frank Wells and Don Williams at
forward, and Gil Rahn and Dick
Taylor at guard. Burness' shooting
eye looked good, but it's doubtful
whether his shape will allow him to
last more than a few minutes
against the speedy Trojans. Don
was noticeably favoring his injured
leg, which was taped.
While the Trojans and Cards are
churning up the Pavilion, the Cali
fornia Bears will be tangling with
U.C.L.A.'s Bruins in Los Angeles'
Olympic Auditorium. Coach Nibs
Price is gunning for the champion
ship this year with a team of mon
strous giants and the Bears are fa
vored to take the Bruins in stride.
However, Coach Caddy Works at
Westwood has a fair team and if the
Bears are looking ahead toward
their game with Stanford next week,
the Bruins may possibly give the
Bears a surprise.
