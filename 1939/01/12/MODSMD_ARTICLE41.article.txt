# Boxing Tourney Date Set for January 19
## 
### 
Date for the 193!) all-University Tournament has been set on Jan
uary 19, according to Boxing Coach Clayton Frye. The >. how will put
before the Stanford enthusiasts the best boxing talent that the campus
has seen this season.
That Farm interest in these boxing exhibitions is increasing was in-
*dicated bv the fact that the attend-

ance at the Novice Tourney, held j
last term, was considerably above j
that of previous years. A large part!
of the i-ise was due to the greater l
number of women who saw the I
matches.
In the coming meet, the out- t
standing heavyweight should be 1
Soph Ward, who captured the all- j
U last year, and who has brought j
enthusiastic comment from the box- j
ing staff in-.his meetings with Coast j
opponents. Hal Saunders rates the!
pre-match favorite in the light-1
heavy division. It is probable that i
Stan Andersen and Hugh Gallar
neau will not enter this tourney. An- |
dersen bowed to Ward in the meet j
last year, but might stand a good :
chance of reaching the finals this \
year, while Gallarneau took the >
light-heavy crown in his sophomore
year.
Out of the matches on the 19th
will come the aspirants for the Gene !
Tunney awards. These gold medals j
come from the ex-champ himself,
and are awarded to an outstanding j
man in each of the weight divisions, i

A specimen of cypress wood in a
Louisiana museum is said to be
