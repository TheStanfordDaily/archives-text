# Frosh Hoopmen To Face Galileo
## Yearlings Will Meet Piedmont High Next 
### 
Coach H- B. Lec had his troubles
yesterday and they all concerned
the freshman basketball squad.
With the club supposed to meet
Galileo and Piedmont High Schools \
in the Pavilion tomorrow and Sat
urday nights, the yearlings have ■
come up with a crop of injuries
which threaten to bench two regu- ,
lars for part of both tilts and elim- i
inate a second-string forward from
action.
Besides that, the ex-Stanford
guard is worrying about the effects
the current rushing period will
have on the boys come tomorrow
at (i:3O o'clock.

REESE. cowden injured

Lew who was uncovered j
after spending most of his time on !
the bench during (he first two games i
of the season, has Lee worried about
a sprained ankle which may force j
him to see limited duty this week- j
end. Another of Lee's front rank
players, Rill Cowden, re-injured his j
arm, which was broken in football j
practice last fall and will be forced \
to play with a cast on his arm in j
both tilts. The other man who has j
been incapacitated is Tony Mes- j
sina, clever little forward who!
usually fills in for Reese or Rob!
Penn.

RAY MAY SEE ACTION

Ed Ray, who played bang-up for
ward and guard positions in the
Papooses' double victories last
week, will be Lee's choice to open
at forward if Reese still hobbles by
, game time. Cowden is expected to
! play a good share of both tilts un
less the extent of the injury is
! greater than believed. His subs will
;be either Chuck Smith or Bob
i Scharbach, both of whom are slated
j to see considerable action in any
j event this week.
