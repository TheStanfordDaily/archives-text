### CHARLES SMITH 
Marred by two defaults, last}
night's intramural basketball games j
produced three overwhelming vie- I
tories and one close battle.
Two strong teams, Dekes and Phi 1
Delta, were not given a chance to |
show their basketball prowess last
night because of the failure of their j
opponents to arrive in time for their '
games. The Dckes were given credit I
for a 1 to 0 win over a Kappa Sig j
five for this reason and likewise the i
Phi Delts defeated the Civil Engi- •
neers by the same score.
Andy Stojkovich, intram.ural man- I

in the tournament that they not only
lose ground in their league compe
tition by defaulting but also points !
from their intramural totals.

ALPHA DELTS WIN

The high-scoring Alpha Del Us ran j
roughshod over a freshman unit

plenty of basket-shooting stars,!

Schroeder with 8, and Hillbaeh with
8. Their performance last night in
making good on long and short
shots, ball control, and defense make
the Alpha Delts a strong contending
team in the tournament. Freshman
Stolie proved to be a star in his
own ri&ht, making 11 of his team's
15 digits. Chalking up such a total
is no easy task while playing on a
losing team.
A "brother act" stole the show in
a lop-sided battle of freshmen in
which the Encinamen from 3E
dumped their fellow classmen from
o\V 42-15. The Judy brothers, play
ing forwards for the victors, scored
25 points between them, Jim tank
ing 15 and Vern 10. Jim's total is
