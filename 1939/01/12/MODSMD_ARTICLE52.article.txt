WITH the repeat performance of the popular
"Tobias and the Angel" tonight, the high
flung cries of misguided irritation which were
raised last year against the Division of Speech
and Drama are dissipated on the winds.
Basis of the moans were one or two plays
which departed from the "tired business man's"
type of entertainment, and were wrongly in
terpreted as being evidences of a complete
disregard, on the Division's part, for campus
tastes. Actually, they were the net result of
classroom necessity in the Division and the
belief that good entertainment was better than
obvious entertainment. •
The assumption that the Division's policy was
directed to confounding the campus can hardly
stand when, in response to reguests from the
campus, a repeat performance of a popular play
is given, the second occurrence of its kind in
the last six months—"Kind Lady" was repeated
during the spring quarter.
And in the quality of the work being done
in the theater now, one can only remark how
far student dramatics at Stanford have come
since the days of the Assembly Hall, when
plays were simply thrown together as another
type of extracurricular activity.
The reviewer of "Tobias" today is not speak
ing amiss when he refers to "Stanford's embry
onic repertory company." That is almost ex
actly what Stanford has. And, without too much
prejudice, one can add that it is a good one.
