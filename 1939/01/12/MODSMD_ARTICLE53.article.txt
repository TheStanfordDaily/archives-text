# Monroe Indoctrinated
## 
### 
WHEN Serior Rafael Valle of Mexico City
spoke on "The Monroe Doctrine" yester
day afternoon in the Education Building, he
stated clearly the supposed chief weakness of
the highly touted Lima Conference which ended
1938 in a blaze of Pan-American glory.
The main trouble, according to Senor Valle,
was the way in which the Conference carefully
avoided any attempt to restate and revise the
Doctrine which has guided United States policy
in the Western Hemisphere since 1823. Among
republics "who honor democracy more in the
breach than the promise," Cordell Hull's action
in deliberately side-tracking a study of the
Doctrine seemed to indicate a policy half
hearted, vacillating, uncertain. The way in
which Argentina was allowed to block forma
tion of an American League and a binding
military alliance was regarded by the majority
of Latin American states as good neighborli
ness carried to an unnecessary extreme.
And yet in expressing this view, both Sehor
Valle and the opinion he represents overlook
the fact that the present and presumably the
future policy of the United States is one of
co operation and not coercion. Although a dan
gerous nationalism is almost certainly going to
develop along with a greatly increased Navy,
the American Government and the American
people have no intention—as yet —of once more
enforcing their Latin American policies at the
point of a gun.
For this reason the avoidance of the Monroe
Doctrine was a wise psychological move, what
ever effect it may have had on the final word
ing of the Declaration of Lima. It indicated to
Latin America that the United States knows
well the basic principle of the united front: it
must come through willing co-operation; it

cannot be enforced, or it will split apart at the
first hint of dissension.
The United States has no wish to embark
upon a renewed imperialism; it wants demo
cratic covenants democratically arrived at, to
offset the threat of the European madness.
When Latin America decides unanimously and
of its own accord to give teeth to a revived
Monroe Doctrine—as Sehor Valle and enlight
ened thought everywhere in this hemisphere
hope—the time will have come for the Colossus
of the North to lead. Until then, unless some
unforeseen event arises, she is content to
follow.—A. S. D.
