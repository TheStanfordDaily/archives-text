ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
4 4NE of the main drawbacks to the popular sport of
complaining about things is that somebody always
drops around the next day and demands constructive
suggestions in an I-don't-see-why-you-weren't
strangled-at-birth tone of voice. I have known about
this for some time, and last Monday when I grouched
at the University for failing to give us a decent place
to study, I was reconciled to pitying the customary
price for my fun. Today, then, I will present a con
structive criticism of studying conditions at Stanford.
The students won't be better or finer men for reading
it, and the University won't bother to notice it at
all. But it will be "constructive."
The problem should be obvious to any Stanford
man who has ever attempted to study on the campus.
Working in his room is almost out of the question.
Neighbors turn up their radios ,and the place vibrates
to a combination of bed-time stories and assorted bits
of music that sounds like a couple of wolves chasing
a sleigh across t he steppes.

If the would-be student goes to the library, he finds
it wrapped in a blanket of sound. A dull wave of
noise surges about the reading room; in the reserve
room, htere is a clatter which radio sound effects men
reserve for riots and battle scenes. Besides that, if
the student goes to the Jibe he will probably be
caught in one of the cross-currents of flirtation, and
even if he is not, he will be distracted by the romantic
rip-tide of the reading room.
The Quad is no better. Its chairs are torture racks.
Its sounding board walls magnify every whisper, so
that girls half-way down the hall blush when a man
stumbles on the stairs. Worse than that, the heat
gradually vanishes, until only a polar bear with a
good circulation could stick it. out after 9 o'clock.

'JPHE constructive suggestion to which this column is
dedicated is as obvious as the complaint. The
University could provide us with small, comfortably
furnished rooms scattered about the campus. A few
small rooms, equipped wilh overstuffed chairs and
floorlamps would serve as oases in our desert of dis
tractions.
There are objections, of course. Comptrollers will
complain that the rooms would be used only a few
hours a day, and would be useless at other times. But
there is no reason why classes should not. meet in
them. Thei-e is no proof for the theory popular among
educators that students cannot absorb knowledge un
less their spines are being wrenched out. of shape.
Personally, I feel that I could Jearn just as well in a
comfortable chair as in one of those combinations of
a hitching post and a pigeon hole that the University
is pleased to call classroom seats.

Comptrollers will also object that Stanford has no
money to refurnish rooms. I suggest that Stanford
build fewer libraries and devote the money to pro
viding places for study.
There are other aspects to the question. But I
feel that I have been sufficiently constructive for one
day. After all, the University will ignoi-e this.

If the would-be student goes to the library, he finds
it wrapped in a blanket of sound. A dull wave of

4 4NE of the main drawbacks to the popular sport of
complaining about things is that somebody always
drops around the next day and demands constructive
suggestions in an I-don't-see-why-you-weren't
strangled-at-birth tone of voice. I have known about
this for some time, and last Monday when I grouched
at the University for failing to give us a decent place
to study, I was reconciled to pitying the customary
price for my fun. Today, then, I will present a con
structive criticism of studying conditions at Stanford.
The students won't be better or finer men for reading
it, and the University won't bother to notice it at
all. But it will be "constructive."
The problem should be obvious to any Stanford
man who has ever attempted to study on the campus.
Working in his room is almost out of the question.
Neighbors turn up their radios ,and the place vibrates
