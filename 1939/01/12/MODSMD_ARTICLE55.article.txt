The other morning a guy in one of Ihe fraternities
picked up the Daily and read that 2200 people are ex
peeled to attend the pledge dance. "Ilrnm 2200 peo
ple," he said. "That means 1100 women. My God,
(here are only 1200 in school." He rushed to the
phone and dialed a number.
"Boy, I hope this is one of the hundred," he said
as he waited for his connection.

At the basketball game last week one guy tried to
get in with one of these new non-transferable root
ers' cards—one that belonged to someone else.
The B.A.C. cop who does or docs not let. you in
took the card to punch it. Glancing at the name, he
recognized it as belonging to a guy lie had known
for some impossible time like twelve years.
He looked up at the guy who had given him the
card. "Say, do you know the guy who owns Ibis
card?"
"Hell yes."
Which was a fool thing to say if he wanted to see
the basketball game. He got one of the quicker
bounces.

A guy with a nick-name, which translated rather
loosely means fast worker, working true 1o form called
up one of our sorority girls dunirg Christmas vacation
—way back then—and asked for a date for the Pledge
dance. Fine.
The other night he called the gal up for the first
time this quarter to arrange the finer details of the
date.
"Pledge dance? What Pledge dance?" the gal asked.
The guy told her what Pledge dance.
"I'm sorry, but I have a date for that."
The guy explained how he called up way back dur
ing Christmas vacation for the date and don't tell me
you've forgotten.
"Oh, I thought that was for the Reg dance. I
waited until after ten-thirty for you to come. And
you never showed up. You cad."

There's an unverified rumor going around that while
the brand new boat house has two beautiful stories,
it has absolutely no stairway.
I suppose you have to wait until high tide and
then float upstairs.
And the engineering department is snickering at
the carcfully planned book elevator in the new Edu
cation building put in to bring heavy truckloads of
books from the building up to the first floor of the
Li be.
i Only the designers blissfully forgot a three-step
difference of level between the two buildings, so now
the books still have to be carted up those three steps.
| Which makes that elevator just a little useless.

The other morning a guy in one of Ihe fraternities
picked up the Daily and read that 2200 people are ex
peeled to attend the pledge dance. "Ilrnm 2200 peo
ple," he said. "That means 1100 women. My God,
(here are only 1200 in school." He rushed to the
phone and dialed a number.
"Boy, I hope this is one of the hundred," he said
as he waited for his connection.

At the basketball game last week one guy tried to
get in with one of these new non-transferable root
ers' cards—one that belonged to someone else.
The B.A.C. cop who does or docs not let. you in
took the card to punch it. Glancing at the name, he
recognized it as belonging to a guy lie had known
for some impossible time like twelve years.
He looked up at the guy who had given him the
card. "Say, do you know the guy who owns Ibis
card?"
"Hell yes."
Which was a fool thing to say if he wanted to see
the basketball game. He got one of the quicker
bounces.

A guy with a nick-name, which translated rather
loosely means fast worker, working true 1o form called
up one of our sorority girls dunirg Christmas vacation
—way back then—and asked for a date for the Pledge
dance. Fine.
The other night he called the gal up for the first
time this quarter to arrange the finer details of the
date.
"Pledge dance? What Pledge dance?" the gal asked.
The guy told her what Pledge dance.
"I'm sorry, but I have a date for that."
The guy explained how he called up way back dur
ing Christmas vacation for the date and don't tell me
you've forgotten.
"Oh, I thought that was for the Reg dance. I
waited until after ten-thirty for you to come. And
you never showed up. You cad."

There's an unverified rumor going around that while
the brand new boat house has two beautiful stories,
it has absolutely no stairway.
I suppose you have to wait until high tide and
then float upstairs.
And the engineering department is snickering at
the carcfully planned book elevator in the new Edu
cation building put in to bring heavy truckloads of
books from the building up to the first floor of the
