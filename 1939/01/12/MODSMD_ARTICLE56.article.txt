# Rainer Goes Dramatic In New Offering
## 
### 
"DRAMATIC SCHOOL," current
ly playing at the Fox-Stanford The
ater.
When she didn't give the impres
sion that she had a cold and had
to breathe through her mouth or that
her hair was in her eyes, Louise
Rainier gave a very dramatic per-

formance in "Dra
matic School," the
life, as Hollywood
sees it, of stu
dents in a Pari
sian school of the
theater.
As the stage
struck girl who
puts her love for
the theater above
all else, Miss
Rainer played her
part to the hilt
and in some cases
she didn't stop at

the hilt. The story was very old. It
included the jealous elder actress,
Gale Sondergaard, the villainous
Marquis who is sorry for every
thing in the end, Allan Marshall,
and the envious schoolmate, Paul
ette Goddard. No one in the cast
failed to do justice to his part.
Robert Sinclair, the director,
brought out the best in all the art
ists, blending his material into good
entertainment and giving Luise
Rainer a chance to display her
large soulful eyes, wistful smile, and
frowsy hair. Unless you are a
Rainer fan, this picture will prove
very boring.
