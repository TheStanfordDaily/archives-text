# CAMPUS OPINION
## MAN BITES BID 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Say, what's this stufl about pay
ing $4 to go to a Scabbard and
Blade dance this quarter? This
school is expensive enough as it is
without them charging that much
for bids.
They flopped last year and if they
persist in trying to squeeze blood
out of us turnips, they'll flop again.
Besides, we can go up to the city
to hear Krupa for a lot less, and
when the fair gets open,i, there'll be
a lot of other bands to go to at a
lot less price.
Can't something be done about it
before it's too late? We like to go
to campus dances when they're
good, but at $4 a bid we couldn't
go to this one if Stokowsky and
the Philadelphia symphony were
playing.
