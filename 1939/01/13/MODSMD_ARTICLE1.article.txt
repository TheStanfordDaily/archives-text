# Hoopmen Face Troy in League Start Tonight
## 
### Jerry Mayer 
Stanford Pavillion.
Stanford vs. Southern California.
Opening conference game.
1938.
It's the same setup tonight, ex

There also are Dale Sears, who al
ternated on the first string last
year, and Tom McGarvin, who
made his letter.

or 24—Little Beebs Lee? Such is
the fame that the boys who wear
these latter three numbers this year
aren't good enough to sit on the
varsity bench. Numbers that car

ketball fame it has ever known.
Number 7 is back, worn by Lee
Lafaillc, who plays forward oppo

making bis letter.
RAPP AT CENTER
Bill Rapp, a 6 ft. 3 in. senior who
played hardly at all last year, is at
center.
At guard, is Bobby Burnett, 5 ft.
8 in. tall, another squadman who
pot his perspective from the bench
last year, and Kenny Davidson. In
