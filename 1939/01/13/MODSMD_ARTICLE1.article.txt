# Hoopmen Face Troy in League Start Tonight
## 
### Jerry Mayer 
Stanford Pavillion.
Stanford vs. Southern California.
Opening conference game.
1938.
It's the same setup tonight, ex
cept substitute the year 1939. The
same, and yet so very much dif
ferent. U. S. C. looks just about
as it did last year when it opened
the season against the Indians in
the Pavilion. There's Ralph
Vaughn, Clem Ruh and Gail Good
rich from last year's regular team.
There also are Dale Sears, who al
ternated on the first string last
year, and Tom McGarvin, who
made his letter.
GONE ARE THE BOYS
But the Indians! Phil Zonne is
there, but the famous Number 7
isn't worn by a raven-haired, smil
ing youth who answers to the name
of Luisetti. Where is 36—Jack
Calderwood, and 26—Art Stoefen,
or 24—Little Beebs Lee? Such is
the fame that the boys who wear
these latter three numbers this year
aren't good enough to sit on the
varsity bench. Numbers that car
ried Stanford to the greatest bas
ketball fame it has ever known.
Number 7 is back, worn by Lee
Lafaillc, who plays forward oppo
site Zonne. Lafaille played quite
a bit last year, but just missed
making bis letter.
RAPP AT CENTER
Bill Rapp, a 6 ft. 3 in. senior who
played hardly at all last year, is at
center.
At guard, is Bobby Burnett, 5 ft.
8 in. tall, another squadman who
pot his perspective from the bench
last year, and Kenny Davidson. In
1938, when the opening tip-off play
was in motion, Davidson was in
the showers with the rest of the
frosh cagers.
Even the Stanford bench is dif
ferent. Instead of gray-haired, ex
cited John Bunn there's quiet, slow
speaking Everett Dean, who is
coaching his first year on the
coast after 14 years at the Univer
sity of Indiana.
MORE BLOCK PLAYS
If Stanford gets the opening tip
off you'll notice still more changes.
The same old fast break; but now
there are more block plays off the
set formation. If the Trojans get
the tip, you'll see a completely re
vamped Indian defense. The Bunn
shifting zone style is gone, and in
its place is a strict man-to-man.
Yes, the scene is practically the
same, but the personnel is certain
ly different.
Dean has undeniably done a
wonderful job with his material, no
matter how this week-end's series
comes out. He has taken a team
boasting but a single letterman
and taught it an entirely new sys
tem. That Dean's first team lacks
the talent of the last few Cardinal
teams is an evident truth. But it
is splendidly coached, and that's a
great part of the battle.
PLENTY OF HUSTLE
Another estimable phase is hustle,
and even the great Laughing Boys
didn't have more than this year's
inexperienced outfit has. When a
ball rolls free watch the flash of
white jerseys dive after it. Watch
them pile into melees, and tie up
the Trojans into held balls.
Unfortunately, offensive punch is
another important factor in win
ning basketball games. Stanford
has it aplenty in Zonne, Lafaille
and Burnett—and Davidson isn't so
bad either—but so far no two of
them has been able to get hot the
same night. If perchance all
THREE of them started hitting
tonight, S. C. may be a very sad
team when it returns southward.
