# English 'Row' Life Features Large Groups

### 
Another leaf in the history of
Stanford fraternities has been turn
ed, and in view of the contrast, it
is interesting to glance at the com
parable set-up in English and Scot
tish universities.
The undergraduate entering Ox
ford University sees an extensive
"College Plan" prepared to care
for his social activities. As a mem
ber of one of the 22 units, he finds
himself living with perhaps 150 fel
lows with whom he will spend
most of his college days, and at the
same time he may seek member
ship in a club representing some
university activity.
Such organzations as the Oxford
Union, the Grid Iron Club, and nu
merous literary societies have been
in operation since the early days of
the University, and admittance
into one of hese carri s varying de
grees of social prestige.
In addition to these closely-knit
units, a number of exclusive dining
clubs exist within the colleges which
foster a spirit somewhat compar
able to that of our own fraternities.
The attitude of the undergradu
ate in the University of Edin
borough is one of distinct dislike
for large living units.
Illustrating this is the fact that
since its founding, members of the
university have insisted on living
in groups of eight or ten or even
less.
In recent years, an attempt has
been made to further some form
. of college system similar to that
â€¢ of Oxford, but acceptance has been
I unenthusiastic.
A start toward this residential
plan has been made in an organiza
tion known as University Hall.
With a membership of 90, certain
qualifications including approval by
residents is required before vacan
cies are filled; but the small out
side living groups are predominant.
There are no organizations with
any great social prestige, working
along definite lines. But in the
atmosphere of well-known coffee
shops and unique dinner clubs may
be found a feeling of brotherhood
somewhat similar to that of the
Stanford social scheme.
