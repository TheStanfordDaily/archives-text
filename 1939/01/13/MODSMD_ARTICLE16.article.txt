# Women Watch Frosh Row Trek
## 
### Mary Clinton 
It's definitely a man's world, es
pecially today with Stanford's em
bryo big shots strutting proudly
around with their decorative pledge
pins. To ancient ears, the raucous
cries of the wet-eared youth of '42
reverberating through the Campus
bring back many a precious mem
ory.
Carefully contemplating the par
ade with either sarcastic glances
or open admiration, the Kampus
Kween enjoys many a silent laugh
at the various specimens of "fra
ternity fodder" which file past the
feminine gallery.
Her catalogue is complete—she
knows all types. There's the star
ry-eyed kid, ambitious and indus
trious, nursing dreams of being a
top-notch activity man now that
the house and the brothers arc be
hind him.
ONLY TOO SOON
Then there's the student, fresh
from the glorificaton of high school
honor scholarship societies (which
don't mean a thing at • ollege—he'll
soon find out), and not yet too
Stanfordizcd to forget the Bawlout.
And if she knows him, she se
cretly pats herself on the back
every time the bashful Romeo who
lowers his eyes in class happens
to lower them when looking her
way. Her card file has an example
of all of 'em.
Inevitably, however, the frater
nity steamroller will produce from
this turbulent, chaotic mass of dis
heveled small fry, the suave, charm
ing sophisticates for which Stan
ford is noted.
SAME OLD ROW MEN
Those are the guys who may be
found lolling on English Corner
with the casual nonchalonce of an
old-timer, with the same old line,
with their hair parted on the same
side, with their cashmere sweaters
bagging.
But right now, the Kampus
Kween remembers that they are
freshmen. And she reminds her
self that she still will break a date
with a frosh for anyone else, still
will borrow his notes and drink
his cokes and smile sweetly when
she wants a ride—but invite him to
the house dance?

she wants a ride—but invite him to
the house dance?
