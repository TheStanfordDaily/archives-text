# Frosh Cagers Face Weekend Hoop Tests
## 
### 
"Nuggets" to their basketball
coach, H. B. Lee, as well as to
some fraternities, a fast-improving
freshman basketball squad, handi
capped by injuries to three key
men, takes the floor at 6:30 tonight
and tomorrow night in preliminary
games to the Indian-Trojan var
sity clashes in the Pavilion.
First on the list of opponents
for the week-end is Galileo High
School, once a power in the Bay
City ranks when Hank Luisetti
starred five years ago. Opponent
No. 2 is Piedmont High, which
claims the son of Herb Dana, the
Coast Conference referee commis
sioner, who is slated to enter Stan
ford next fall.
EXPECT TWO TESTS
Both games are expected to test
the newly-found Papooses who will
be without the services of Bob
Reese, while Bill Cowden, regular
center, will be forced to play with
a small cast on his arm which was
reinjured this week after being
broken in football season. Little
Jdf: Messina, sub forward, is out
of the twin bill with a sprained
back muscle.
Replacing Reese at forward will
be Dick Ray, scrappy forward,
who, although lacking in height,
will make up for it in his sharp
shooting which earned him the
title of third high scoring man last
week-end. Besides that, Ray is a
regular ball-hawk on defense in
breaking up plays.
PENN AT FORWARD
Operating at forward, a switch
from center last week, will be lanky
Bob Penn, 6 foot 5 incher, who
should lead the offensive attack
with Reese on the sidelines. Back
at his old high school position af
ter a brief tenure at center, Penn
bagged 21 points to snare high scor
ing honors last week and threatens
to sink more if guarding is lax.
Vern Hoffman and Ollie Hamlin
will be stationed at guard by Lee,
with Chuck Smith and Bob Schar
bach in line for early substitute
duty. Others who will see action
are Claflin and Petteys, a couple
of fast forwards.
