# Unpledged Frosh To Find Hall Doors Open Next Year
## 
### 
Next year, when 175 un-pledged
Encinamen face Stanford life, they
will find the doors of Toyon and
Branner open.
In addition, they will find seven
eating clubs ready to welcome
them to the informal atmosphere
in which approximately half of
Stanford's men live.
Members of the Class of '42 who
have chosen the Mall way need not
?ccl themselves social outcasts, for
on a campus such as Stanford's,
where the division is so even, Hah
men are social equals of their fra
ternity friends.
HALL SOCIAL LIFE
Dances and exchange dinners,
smokers and club meetings pro
vide the necessary social back
ground for the Halls. In number
of dances each quarter, the Hall
surpasses even the notoriously
"smooth" Row.
Enc.ina friendships need not end
<n June, contrary to the old notion
for Row men frequently entertain
theii Hall friends ai fraterniv
houses, and Hall men reciprocate
with invitations 1o ea» ig clubs.
SUPERIOR ROOMS
Superiority of living accomoda
tons : n Toyon and Br.mncr is an
accepted truth. Much l?ss crowded
t''r»n the houses, the Halls offer
privacy, improved sleeping and

Two rooms comprise the average
Hhil s lite—on»: room for study and
one t'T sleep. However, a few
singles arc available for those who
hibei nate.
Recreation and study rooms are
numerous in Farm dormitories.
With comfortable leather chairs
and couches, large oak tables,
adequate lighting, the study rooms
provide excellent spots for late
study. Ping-pong and pool rooms,
a lobby with radio, piano, current
magazines and several daily papers
permit the relaxation and recrea
tion that punctuate days of classes
and study.
Intimately connected with Hall
life is the eating club. Seven clubs
offer eating facilities to 150 Stan
ford men. Membership is by in

vitaton. In addition, Sequoia oper
ates a club, open to all men.
Two rushing periods his year
introduced several hundred En
cinamen to the Hall-eating club
side of Farm life. Last year
marked the first year that this pro
cedure had been followed, but its
success demanded further trial.
Without high-pressuring Frosh, the
Hall men showed them the advan
tages of dormitories and eating
clubs, allowed them to make their
own choice.
