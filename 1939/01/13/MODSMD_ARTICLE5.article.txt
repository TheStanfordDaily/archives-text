# 2000 to Dance To Two Prom Bands Tonight
## 
### 
Wending their way toward the
Woman's Gym, some 2,000 row
men, pledges and their dates will
go dancing in the softly lighted
gym and dance studio tonight.
There will be two orchestras,
Harry Barris "the lovable lunatic,"
and Neil Bondshu.
Music on both floors will begin
at 9:30 and will continue until 1:30
o'clock. During intermissions, Bar
ris and his vocalists will entertain
with novelty numbers.
MONEY OR MUSIC
Unlike last year's Prom, there
will be no midnight supper but
punch will be served, as it was felt
by the Prom committee in charge
of the dance that the money which
would be put into the meal could
be better spent on the orchestras.
The committee was composed of
Tom Nichols, chairman, Bill Clat
worthy, D. B. Hill, George Hislop,
Walt Meyer, Herb Schoencn, and
Andy Shirey.
Harry Barris and Loyce Whit
man are well-known entertainers
on the coast. Barris was one of the
original Rhythm Boys with Bing
Crosby and has played the role of
orchestra leader in several of
Crosby's pictures.
PLAYS IN OAKLAND
Neil Bondshu has recently finish
ed playing an engagement at the
Lake Mcrrit Hotel in Oakland.
Vicki Lang, his vocalist, has been

dance will be Mr. and Mrs. Charles

Fagan, Mr. Harold M. Bacon, Mr.
and Mrs. Warden M. Turner, Mr.
