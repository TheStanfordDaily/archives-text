# Fraternities Pledge 257
## Phi Delta Theta Leads Houses With 14 Pledges 
### 
With a grand total leading last year's pledge list figure by exactly
one good frosh and true, Phi Delta Theta played king to the annual
pledging mountain this afternoon with 14 new members.
Breathing upon Phi Delt's neck were Chi Psi, Kappa Sigma, Phi
Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi, Sigma Chi, and Zeta Psi, with 13 each

tucked safe in the fold.
A total of 257 members of the
freshman class received formal
pledging cards from Warren M.
Turner, Interfraternity Auditor, and
Interfraternity Council president,
Bud McDuffie, in the Encina spon
sor's room this afternoon. Hold
ing steadfast in number with last
year's pledging figure, the number
is still far below the 307 scored
two years ago.
MARCH UP ROW
While some frosh bit nails, made
up their minds late, others,
already pledged, marched up the
Row to their respective houses, to
be greeted with horns, whistles,
bells, and bombs.
So it's all over but the shouting.
And as deafened residents along
Lasuen will testify, there was plen
ty of that. With pledging over,
the Pledge Prom swinging out, the
reign of silence in Encina comes
to a welcome close.
Special dinners will be set before
the pledgees, while preparations
to fete them at the Pledge Prom
are in the making.
FIGURE DROPS
Although the Phi Belt's 14 was
top for this pledge period, it drops
one down from the Dekes, Delts,
and Chi Psi's of last year, who top
ped the list then with 15 apiece.
But bolstering up the final total
was the relatively unform distribu
tion of pledges throughout most
of the houses.
