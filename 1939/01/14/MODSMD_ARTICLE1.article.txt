# Ball-Hawking Indians Hot For Second Win Tonight
## 
### Jerry Mayer 
University of Southern California's "wonder" basketball team is
doing some wondering today.
Last night the Trojans were highly favored to defeat Stanford in
their first step toward annexation of the Conference championship, but
instead it was the ambitious southeners who were tripped up as the rag-

ing Cards battled their way to an<
upset 42-39 victory in a furious
game in the Pavilion.
And tonight Coach Sam Barry's
men of Troy are wondering just
what the unpredictable Indians are
going to throw at tliem in the final
contest of the two-game series. Last
night it was fight, and a tricky of
fensive tha*. drew the S. C. play
ers into positions unfamilar to
them.
Tom McGarvn, Trojan guard who
who excels at taking the hall off the
backboard, was lured out from un
der the basket so that lie couldn't
utilize his rebounding ability while
Ralph Vaughn was forced to play
in the "hole" for the Trojans.

VAUGHN SCORING STAR

Vaughn was the scoring star for
S. C. with 15 points, but lie's at
best only a mediocre defensive
player, and the fact that he was
playing the important shit 011 de
fense contributed 110 little part to
Stanford's victory.
As usual the Indians were forc
ed to come from behind to win.
First it was 7-2, with the Trojans
looking very, very good. But that
was the last time cither of the teams
was ahead by more than four
points, until the Cards barged into
a 42-37 lead with two minutes to
play.
