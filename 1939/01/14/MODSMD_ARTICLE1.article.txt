# Ball-Hawking Indians Hot For Second Win Tonight
## 
### Jerry Mayer 
University of Southern California's "wonder" basketball team is
doing some wondering today.
Last night the Trojans were highly favored to defeat Stanford in
their first step toward annexation of the Conference championship, but
instead it was the ambitious southeners who were tripped up as the rag-

ing Cards battled their way to an<
upset 42-39 victory in a furious
game in the Pavilion.
And tonight Coach Sam Barry's
men of Troy are wondering just
what the unpredictable Indians are
going to throw at tliem in the final
contest of the two-game series. Last
night it was fight, and a tricky of
fensive tha*. drew the S. C. play
ers into positions unfamilar to
them.
Tom McGarvn, Trojan guard who
who excels at taking the hall off the
backboard, was lured out from un
der the basket so that lie couldn't
utilize his rebounding ability while
Ralph Vaughn was forced to play
in the "hole" for the Trojans.

VAUGHN SCORING STAR

Vaughn was the scoring star for
S. C. with 15 points, but lie's at
best only a mediocre defensive
player, and the fact that he was
playing the important shit 011 de
fense contributed 110 little part to
Stanford's victory.
As usual the Indians were forc
ed to come from behind to win.
First it was 7-2, with the Trojans
looking very, very good. But that
was the last time cither of the teams
was ahead by more than four
points, until the Cards barged into
a 42-37 lead with two minutes to
play.
Kenn Davidson's field goal
from 25 feet out gave Stanford a
12-10 lead in the first half, but just
before the gun sounded Vaughn
droppel in a field goal and two foul
shots, and the Trojans were out
ahead, 22-19, at the end of the
initial period.
CARDS START MOVING
But the real ifun began when S.
C. tied the score at 36-36 on Jack
Morrison's set-up off a fast break.
Harlan Copsey, sub forward,
dumped in a foul and then a sec
ond later ran the Card lead to 39-
36 when he jumped high under
neath the basket to get Zonne's
pass and dropped the ball in the
bucket while he was still in the air.
With Gail Goodrich, S. C. captain,
hanging all over him, Don Burness
dropped in a left-hander over his
head. Phil Zonne concluded Stan
ford's scoring when he sank a foul
shot, awarded bccause Forward
Keith Lambert failed to report
when he entered the game.
Phil Zonne proved conclusively
that he has regained his shooting
eye when lie pumped 17 points
through the netting for high hon
ors, his effort being two points
better than Vaughn's.
BURNESS, RAPP STAR
Don Burness, the other soph
star, although obviously hampered
by his bandaged knee, entered the
contest in the first half and played
the rest of the game, rebounding
phenomenally on the defense.
The senior was Bill Rapp, a ball
hawk with no superior. Rapp was
rebounding sensationally last night
making fifty percent of the Cards'
rebounds.
Tonight Coach Dean announces
that Burness will start the game
at center, with Bill Rapp being
moved to forward opposite Zonne,
and Davidson and Burnett playing
guard.

Stanford (42) (39) S. C.

men of Troy are wondering just
what the unpredictable Indians are
going to throw at tliem in the final
contest of the two-game series. Last
night it was fight, and a tricky of
fensive tha*. drew the S. C. play
ers into positions unfamilar to
them.
Tom McGarvn, Trojan guard who
who excels at taking the hall off the
backboard, was lured out from un
der the basket so that lie couldn't
utilize his rebounding ability while
Ralph Vaughn was forced to play
in the "hole" for the Trojans.

VAUGHN SCORING STAR

Vaughn was the scoring star for
S. C. with 15 points, but lie's at
best only a mediocre defensive
player, and the fact that he was
playing the important shit 011 de
fense contributed 110 little part to
Stanford's victory.
As usual the Indians were forc
ed to come from behind to win.
First it was 7-2, with the Trojans
looking very, very good. But that
was the last time cither of the teams
was ahead by more than four
points, until the Cards barged into
a 42-37 lead with two minutes to
play.
Kenn Davidson's field goal
from 25 feet out gave Stanford a
12-10 lead in the first half, but just
before the gun sounded Vaughn
droppel in a field goal and two foul
shots, and the Trojans were out
ahead, 22-19, at the end of the
initial period.
CARDS START MOVING
But the real ifun began when S.
C. tied the score at 36-36 on Jack
Morrison's set-up off a fast break.
Harlan Copsey, sub forward,
dumped in a foul and then a sec
ond later ran the Card lead to 39-
36 when he jumped high under
neath the basket to get Zonne's
pass and dropped the ball in the
bucket while he was still in the air.
With Gail Goodrich, S. C. captain,
hanging all over him, Don Burness
dropped in a left-hander over his
head. Phil Zonne concluded Stan
ford's scoring when he sank a foul
shot, awarded bccause Forward
Keith Lambert failed to report
when he entered the game.
Phil Zonne proved conclusively
that he has regained his shooting
eye when lie pumped 17 points
through the netting for high hon
ors, his effort being two points
better than Vaughn's.
BURNESS, RAPP STAR
Don Burness, the other soph
star, although obviously hampered
by his bandaged knee, entered the
contest in the first half and played
the rest of the game, rebounding
phenomenally on the defense.
The senior was Bill Rapp, a ball
hawk with no superior. Rapp was
rebounding sensationally last night
making fifty percent of the Cards'
rebounds.
Tonight Coach Dean announces
that Burness will start the game
at center, with Bill Rapp being
moved to forward opposite Zonne,
and Davidson and Burnett playing
guard.
