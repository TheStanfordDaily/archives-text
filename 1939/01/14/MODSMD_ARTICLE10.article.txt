# '42 Women Pledge Without 'Roble Revolt'
## 
### 
Firmly convinced that friendship
can remain intact when the class is
split by the traditional Row-Hall
break, Roble's Class of '42 this year
has made no attempts at revolt as
happened last year at this time.
Starting in a Sunday midnight
bull session of a few women, part
of whom were assured of bids, part
of whom were sure that those who
accepted would be carried away
from first-year friendships, the
anti-sorority movement quickly
spread through the hall.
News of the "revolt" was slow
to leak out, and the campus in
general didn't hear of it until the
following Tuesday morning.
FRIENDS "HEARTBROKEN"
"It's—it's just that so many of
our friends are just heartbroken
over it—that we don't think it's
all quite fair. VVe think that some
thing's wrong somewhere. VVe like
the sorority girls, but we think
that something should be done to
make their system fairer all
around," one spokesman argued.
Meanw h i 1 e, sorority women
gathered to the defense, quickly is
sued statements in support of the
Row.
"Rebels," voting in a hall-wide
conference, finally agreed to pledge
but at the same time censured the
system of rushing and bidding.
ONLY 28 FAVORABLE
First ballot of the meeting re
vealed that only 28 out of 110 pres
ent were definitely in favor of ac
cepting pins from the houses, but
as the meeting went on, opinions
changed and two questions were
submitted to vote: one on whether
the class would pledge, the other
on the sororiy system.
Result was almost unanimous de
cision to pledge and a definite in
dictment of the system.
Final result of the week-long
discussions was an unprecedented
drop in number of freshmen women
to accept Row bids and the Farm's
nine sororities could count only 89
pledges when formal bidding ended.
