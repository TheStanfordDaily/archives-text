# Encinamen Issue Ultimatum To Row-Conscious Robleites
## 
### 
Tossing aside the usual topic of
bull session discussion, Encina
men drew up a stern ultimatum to
all Roble sorority pledges warning
them that a Greek pin signifies less
than nothing to them and debunk
ing the theory that the "cream of
the Roble crop" goes sorority.
Frosh men viewing the situation
from all angles and ankles, arguing
both pro and con, finally came to
a decision in a startling pronuncia
mento.
The ultimatum reads as follows:
Whereas pledges are selected by
sororities on a basis that is far from
satisfactory, which include such im
portant items as make and cost of
automobile, ability to apple polish,
skill in tipping a tea cup, financial
rating, and the like, combined with
the fact that women fulfilling these
requisites lack the necessary mon
opoly on feminine pulchritude and
that it is indeed difficult to date and
have a good tine with a financial
statement.
Furthermone, the only advantage
pledges have over other campus
women is the possession of a little
pin.
Therefore, men of the Class of

'42 advise you, the sorority pledges,
enjoy to the utmost your "queen
ship for a day and then climb
off your high horse tomorrowâ€”or
else!
What effect this daring move
will have has not yet been deter
mined. Encina men are in the
throes of speculation as to whether
or not the soronty maidens will take
retaliatory actions in an attempt to
punish them, but even at this early
date more than just a few males
have a certain worried look in their
eyes.
