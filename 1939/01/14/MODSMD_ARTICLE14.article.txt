# Frosh Hoopmen Beat Galileo Despite Worry over Pledging
## 
### 
With their minds more on pledg
ing rather than the business at
hand—a basketball game with Gal
ileo High School—the Farm's
frosh hoopsters nevertheless took
time out long enough last night to
roll up a 37-16 victory in the pre
liminary game to the Stanford-U.
S. C. upset.
Billed to meet a much stronger
outfit at 6:30 o'clock tonight in
Piedmont High School, Coach H.
B. Lee's cagers will have to shake
loose from their lethargy if they
have any ideas of making it four
straight victories. Boasting one
of the top-notch outfits on the Ber
keley side of the Bay, Piedmont
figures to give the Papooses a much
tougher argument than the club
which was held to a single field
goal in the first half last night.
FROSH CAN'T CONCENTRATE
Hank Luisetti's prep alma mater
actually wouldn't have been in the
same loop with the Indian yearlings
if it hadn't been for Row pledging,
which proved to be the chief topic
of discussion before the game, at
half-time, and probably on the

bench during the game. Lee just
couldn't get the boys interested in
the game, and so they only won by
a 37-16 score where it might just
as well have been up in the 50's or
60's.
TWO POINTS IN HALF
Observers were agreed, however,
that if the frosh were attempting a
little pledging on the side, as a side
line to their basketball playing, it
was quite a mistake for them to
hold the visiting cagers to just one
field goal in the opening half. Af
ter listening to fight talks from
the various houses this week, the
frosh apparently got a little mixed
up on what the smooth tactics ac
tually are.
After watching their new bro
thers in action during the first half,
upper-class fraternity men probab
ly took some of their "nuggets"
aside in the half-time intermission—
to the protest of lnterfraternity
Council and Coach Lee—and gave
them some worldly advice on "how
to pledge players and lose mem
bers".
GALILEO GETS HOT
So in the second half, Galileo
scored 12 points while Stanford's
club put only 17 points through he
bucket. An unfounded rumor had
it that all the Galileo players had
been signed and sealed but would
not be delivered until next year.
In the meantime, the report from
the Row had it that Piedmont would
be next on the list of pledging to
night.
Of the three injured yearlings,
only Lew Reese was held out of
action, although lie may possibly
get into the pledging affairs to
night. Bill Cowden played despite
a cast on his arm, which was brok
en last fall and reinjured this week
in practice. Joe Messina also got
into the ceremonies.
GOOD DEFENSE
Dick Ray and Bob Penn teamed
at forward, Cowden held down cen
ter and Ollic Hamlin and Vern
Hoffman manned the guard berths.
Chuck Smith and Henry Claflin
were outstanding among the sub
stitutes.
With a ragged edge to most of
their offensive plays, the club did
a much better job on defense even
with subs in action during the sec
ond half. Ball handling was far off
key from the performance of last
week-end as the jittery playing had
them missing numerous set-up
shots while bad passing nullified
possible field goals.
