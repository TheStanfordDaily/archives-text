Commending the quiet and or
derliness of this year's rushing, in
which there was no repetition of
last winter's "Roble Rebellion," and
praising the impartial spirit of all
concerned, Dean Mary Yost yester
day issued the following statement:
"From what T have observed and
heard the women's rushing this
year on the part of both the soror
ities and the new girls has been
conducted with fairness and with
less emotional and physical strain
than we have had in some years.
"In promoting a saner, more bal
anced attitude toward the question,
the careful planning of Panhellenic
to forsce and overcome as many
difficulties as possible and the dis
passionate discussion through the
"Daily" of the advantages as plac
es to live of both the halls and the
sorority houses undoubtedly had in
fluence.
"Also effective were the efforts
of the sponsors in Roble, especially
the talk at housemeeting this quar
ter by the head sponsor, in having
the freshmen face the realities of
our situation here and realize that
the success and happiness of the
individual depends largely on her
self whether >he lives in one of the
halls or on the Row."
