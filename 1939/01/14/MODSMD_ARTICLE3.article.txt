# Lagunita, Union To Accomodate Independents
## 
### Phyllis White 
While hysterically happy fresh
men women trek up the Row to
night, the majority of their Roble
sisters, some hysterically unhappy,
some glad of it, and some just re
signed, will sit at home, asking
themselves, "Little Girl, what
now?"
The "what now" at Stanford is
good enough to be first choice in
stead of an unhappy alternative
with a good many women. Since
the opening of Lagunita Court for
fall quarter in 1934, the University
has had what is considered by
many to be the best residential
plant in the country.
NEW WINGS
What with the addition of two
new wings, Casas Granada and
Olivo, to Lagunita last year, and
the remodeling of the Scrra Street
apartment houses into Casa Ven
tura, the University is well pre
pared to take care of the rest of
the 1100.
To many women, life in Lagun
ita, which combines the advantages
of both a small and large living
group or in one of the smaller
Union units, with its greater inde
pendence and opportunity to make
a wider and freer selection of
friends, seems preferable to dig
ging in behind one of the nine
Greek-lettered doors up Lasuen
way.
HOUSES 288
Lagunita was built to relieve the
tremendous overcrowding in Roble,
where upperclassmen and freshmen
were formerly thrown in together,
when the Board of Trustees let
down the barriers which had kept
the feminine element on the Farm
clown to 500. The admission of
more women made necessary the
addition of the two extra wings,
so that the greater Lagunita today
houses 288 women, with 35 more
from Ventura eating in the main
dining hall.

While Row women hold out for
sisterhood in the sacred bond, and
Hall women extoll personal free
dom and individual wash basins, it
would seem that, by the end of their
senior year, both sides are glad
they chose the group they did in a
week of madness and mob psy
chology when they were freshmen.
