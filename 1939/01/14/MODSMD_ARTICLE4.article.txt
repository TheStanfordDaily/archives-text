# Farm's Sororities Hold Open House
## 
### 
When the tumult and the
shouting dies tonight at 7:30,
the captains and the kings will
depart, but not for home.
They will go, insead up the
Row, along which the Farm's
nine sororities will be holding
open house for the purpose of
introducing their new pledges
to the campus. Engulfed in a
wave of good-fellowship induced
by punch, cookies, and small
dance orchestras, the new mem
bers of Stanford's mighty min
ority will be formally presented
not only to Row men, but abo
to any from the halls who wish
to come.
Open house will start at 8
o'clock, continue till midnight.
