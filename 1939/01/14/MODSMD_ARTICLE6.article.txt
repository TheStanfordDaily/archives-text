Pan-Hellenic President Jean
Welch last night issued the follow
ing statement as 1939's season of
sorority rushes was concluded with
pledging ceremonies.
"With all the excitement of rush
ing behind us once again, I would
like to thank first of all the spon
sors, the rush chairmen, and the
Administration for their splendid
cooperation in a most satisfactory
rushing period this year. I would
also like to express my apprecia
tion to the freshmen and other new
women for their fine spirit ahout
and understanding of our rushing
system.
"I sincerely hope that the wo
men who have just been pledged
will find their sorority experiences
valuable and satisfying to them
both as individuals and as mem
bers of the Stanford student body."
