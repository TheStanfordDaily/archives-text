75% OF DOCTORS
DIE FKOM EXHAUSTION
The average Doctor is a good etample of what his parienrn
shouldn't do, in the way of burning up energy faster than it
can be replaced by nature.
Directly, or indirectly, in the case of 75T- of the Doctors who
die each year, plain exhaustion is the cause. Depletion from
over-work, worry and lack of rest induces heart trouble,
kidney disorders, acute gastric conditions.
The physical and mental demand on a Doctor with a busy
practice, would appall the average business man. lie simply
would not be able ro understand why the Doctor does not
systematize his practice better and insure himself a more
healthfully rounded out routine.
However, the patient can often help, by being on time to
appointments, telephoning only when necessary, calling at
night only in cases of emergencyâ€”and co-operating with the
Doctor's treatment.
Usually when it is necessary for you to wait on a Doctor,
someone has been late to an appointment, or some unexpected
emergency has arisen
