### Larry Livingston 
J'VE just come home from a week
end's skiing to find the world is
still "schussing" uncertainly on its
down-hill course. Despite the in
tense effort that has been made
since last September to keep Eu
rope at peace, (he wayward conti
nent is splitting inevitably into two
camps.
Far away on the too-white slopes
of Badger Pass it is difficult to re
alize that the nations of the world
are lining up for a game all their
own, but just the same they are.
This time it's going to be Democracy
vs. Fascism in a very special and
super-colossal war, a war such as
has never been seen before.
Italy, firmly supported by the
Rome-Berlin axis, announced so
positive a stand when Chamberlain
and Mussolini met last week that
the British Prime Minister finally
has given up in his attempt to recon
cile the opposing views of Europe's
democratic and totalitarian states.
When II Duce told the would-be
peace maker that he will not even
consider lubrication of the Italo-
French friction until an Insurgent
victory in Spain has been assured,
Neville Chamberlain came to the end
of his rope. What Mussolini meant
was that he will remain aloof from
mediation or arbitration until Eng
land and France grant the Spanish
Rebels belligerent rights, which will
aid the Insurgents winning the war.
lie also told the British Prime
Minister, in a polite but firm tone
of voice, that Italy will not with
draw her forces from Spain until
Franco meets victory. And so Mr.
Chamberlain returned to London
yesterday with his banner of ap
peasement furled and waving an
anti-Fascist standard with appar
ent enthusiasm.
At long last Britain is standing
firm. In response to public opinion
at home and Chamberlain's inabil
ity to change / black to white, and
vice versa, England is out to show
the world that the Anglo-French
alliance is just as strong as the
Rome-Berlin axis.
We shall see.

foreign minister, that England will

Franco's hoys these days, have
captured the city of Tarragona.
Now the captures of little Span

day has become so usual that it. is
beginning to make poor newspaper
copy, but when Franco captures
Tarragona, he's really got something
there. This city is only 25 miles
from Barcelona, the capital and last
great, stronghold of the Loyalists;
with its capture comes a tremendous
advance for the Insurgent troops all
the way along the Catalonian front.
The Republicans have ordered
every able-bodied Spaniard to stand
ready for military service, and this
command applies to men and women
of all ages. This time the Loyalists
have really got. their backs to the

Rebels belligerent rights, which will

American bodies and souls together I
J'VE just come home from a week
end's skiing to find the world is
still "schussing" uncertainly on its
down-hill course. Despite the in
tense effort that has been made
since last September to keep Eu
rope at peace, (he wayward conti
nent is splitting inevitably into two
camps.
Far away on the too-white slopes
of Badger Pass it is difficult to re
alize that the nations of the world
are lining up for a game all their
own, but just the same they are.
This time it's going to be Democracy
vs. Fascism in a very special and
super-colossal war, a war such as
has never been seen before.
Italy, firmly supported by the
Rome-Berlin axis, announced so
positive a stand when Chamberlain
and Mussolini met last week that
the British Prime Minister finally
has given up in his attempt to recon
cile the opposing views of Europe's
democratic and totalitarian states.
When II Duce told the would-be
peace maker that he will not even
consider lubrication of the Italo-
French friction until an Insurgent
victory in Spain has been assured,
Neville Chamberlain came to the end
of his rope. What Mussolini meant
was that he will remain aloof from
mediation or arbitration until Eng
land and France grant the Spanish
Rebels belligerent rights, which will
aid the Insurgents winning the war.
lie also told the British Prime
Minister, in a polite but firm tone
of voice, that Italy will not with
draw her forces from Spain until
Franco meets victory. And so Mr.
Chamberlain returned to London
yesterday with his banner of ap
peasement furled and waving an
anti-Fascist standard with appar
ent enthusiasm.
At long last Britain is standing
firm. In response to public opinion
at home and Chamberlain's inabil
ity to change / black to white, and
vice versa, England is out to show
the world that the Anglo-French
alliance is just as strong as the
Rome-Berlin axis.
We shall see.

Tarragona, he's really got something

with its capture comes a tremendous
advance for the Insurgent troops all

The Republicans have ordered
every able-bodied Spaniard to stand
