# Fellowships Granted By E.I. duPont
## Chemistry, Paralysis Research Gifts Total $37,500 
### 
Fellowships totaling $25,500 for re
search in chemistry and a grant of
$12,000 for the study of infantile
paralysis were received by the Uni
versity last week, according to an
nouncements yesterday. The fel
lowships were given by E. I. du Pont
de Nemours and Co., and the re
search grant was made by the Na
tional Foundation for Infantile Pa
ralysis.
Receipt of the Du Pont awards
marks the third successive year in
which the University has been so
honored, according to Professor
Robert Eckles Swain, head of the
department of chemistry, who made
the announcement of the award.
Including six fellowships for $2,000
to be made available for funda
mental research in organic chem
istry, and 18 fellowships of $750 for
chemistry research in postgraduate
divisions, Dr. Swain said he believed
the awards were made in the same
number and amount .is formerly.
FOR CHEMICAL RESEARCH
"These fellowships are being given
to outstanding graduates working
for their doctorates who are doing
valuable work in chemical research,"
he explained. He added that, so far
as he knows, Stanford is the only
university in California, and one of
a very few in the West, which was
so honored.
The University is one of 24 insti
tutions throughout the country se
lected for this award.
The grant from the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
is also a re-issuance of an earlier
award, according to announcements.
It is given for use in scientific re
search and for prevention and treat
ment of after-effects of poliomyelitis.
LARGE GRANT
Of the eight universities and medi
cal schools in the nation which re
ceived the research grant, Stanford
was awarded the largest portion.
Other grants were also made to
various research institutions.
Other coast institutions receiving
parts of the fund were the University
of California medical school, $5,000;
University of Southern California
medical school, $10,000; and the Or
thopedic Hospital in Los Angeles,
$7,500.
Money for these awards was de
rived from last year's series of Pres
ident's Birthday Balls held through

Receipt of the Du Pont awards
marks the third successive year in
which the University has been so
honored, according to Professor
Robert Eckles Swain, head of the
department of chemistry, who made
the announcement of the award.
Including six fellowships for $2,000
to be made available for funda
mental research in organic chem
istry, and 18 fellowships of $750 for
chemistry research in postgraduate
divisions, Dr. Swain said he believed
the awards were made in the same
number and amount .is formerly.
FOR CHEMICAL RESEARCH
"These fellowships are being given
to outstanding graduates working
for their doctorates who are doing
valuable work in chemical research,"
he explained. He added that, so far
as he knows, Stanford is the only
university in California, and one of
a very few in the West, which was
so honored.
The University is one of 24 insti
tutions throughout the country se
lected for this award.
The grant from the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
is also a re-issuance of an earlier
award, according to announcements.
It is given for use in scientific re
search and for prevention and treat
ment of after-effects of poliomyelitis.
LARGE GRANT
Of the eight universities and medi
cal schools in the nation which re
ceived the research grant, Stanford
was awarded the largest portion.
Other grants were also made to
various research institutions.
Other coast institutions receiving
parts of the fund were the University
of California medical school, $5,000;
University of Southern California
medical school, $10,000; and the Or
thopedic Hospital in Los Angeles,
$7,500.
Money for these awards was de
rived from last year's series of Pres
ident's Birthday Balls held through
out the country.
Fellowships totaling $25,500 for re
