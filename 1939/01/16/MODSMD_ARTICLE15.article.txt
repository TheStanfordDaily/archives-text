# Dr. Hall Will Define Propaganda Tonight
## 
### 
Using as his subject "What Is Propaganda?" Everett W. Hall, associate
professor of philosophy, will lecture in the Auditorium of the Education
Building this evening at 7::>0 o'clock.
Tliis is the second in a series of lectures sponsored by the philosophy
department under the general heading, "The Philosophy of Propaganda."

Professor Hall, in his address
evening will be primarily concerned \
with presenting a technically sound
definition of the term propaganda,
and he will also point out some of
its characteristics which should en
able those propagandized to recog- j
nize the fact.
Included in the discussion will be j
a reconsideration of the statement
that "all education is propaganda." ,
This was the conclusion reached
by Professor Brown in the lecture
last Monday, and its validity will be
questioned by a conflicting proposi
tion to be presented by Professor
Hall.
In this connection it has been an- j
nounced by sponsors of the lecture
series that no single point, was be- j
ing built, up by the various speak- ;
ers. Instead, each would consider i
the subject of propaganda and edu- |
cation from his own particular an
gle, leaving all conclusions t: othc i
audience.
The three speakers remaining on !
the lecture series are Professors
Henry Lanz and John Reid of the
philosophy department, and Pro
fessor Frederick Anderson of the
Romanic languages department.
