# Card-Troy Meet Ends In Toss-up
## Indian Cagers Win 42-39; Trojan Crew Gets 45-32 Revenge 
### 
It doesn't come under the head
ing of late news but in case you
haven't heard, Stanford and South-,
em California split their conference
opening series in the Pavilion last
week-end.
Coach Everett Dean's Stanfords
annexed Friday night's affair, 42-
39, but the Trojans came back in
the second game Saturday evening
to win, 45-32.
Today Dean will resume drills for
the first California game, which is
scheduled for Friday night in the
Pavilion. Saturday the Cards will
play a double-header against San
Francisco State and the barnstorm
ing University of Mexico outfit.
CARDS WIN FRIDAY
Stanford's night against the Tro
jans was Friday. That evening the
Indians committed a minimum of
mistakes as they outfought and out
thought the southerners in winning
their thrilling victory.
Except for the first fe\y minutes
when Troy led 7-2, the Cards were
ahead of the visitors during the en
tire first half of Friday's game—un
til Ralph Vaughn dropped in a field
goal and two foul shots just before
the hall to give the Trojans a 22-19
advantage at the gun.
Field goals by Don Burness and
Phil Zonne at the start of the sec
ond half put the Indians in the lead
once more, 23-22, and they held it
until the Trojans finally tied it up
at 36-all.
RED SCORING SPREE
It was at this point that Stanford
proceeded to leave the Trojans in
the ruck. While Vaughn was sink
ing a foul shot, Harlan Copsey
pumped a field goal and a free
throw into the hoop, Don Burness
sank a difficult one-hander, and
Zonne plopped another foul through
the netting to put the Cards out
ahead 42-37 with two minutes to go.
They nursed that lead successfully
although Clem Ruh narrowed the
margin just before the gun by
sneaking under the basket and
dropping in a set-up.
The Indians couldn't do anything
wrong Friday. The tricky offense
Dean taught them just for this se-
lies worked perfectly. Tom Mc-
Garvin, the best rebounder on the
Trojan team, was drawn out into
the front ranks, while Vaughn, the
poorest defensive player for the vis
itors, was lured into the important
"hole" spot.
ZONNE IN TOP FORM
And another estimable factor in
the Cards' triumph was Captain
Phil Zonne's shooting. Phil potted
six field goals in ten attempts, while
the best the highly-touted Vaughn
could do was sink four in seventeen
attempts. With their foul shots
thrown in, Phil nabbed high-point
honors for the evening with 17
points and Vaughn was runner-up
with 15.
However, Saturday was the Tro
jans' night and Coach Sam Barry's
proteges made mince-meat of their
erstwhile conquerors. They guarded
the Cards so tightly that half-time
score was 17-6, and could have been
worse if the Trojans had been on
their shooting eyes.

It doesn't come under the head

haven't heard, Stanford and South-,

Coach Everett Dean's Stanfords

the second game Saturday evening

CARDS WIN FRIDAY
Stanford's night against the Tro
jans was Friday. That evening the
Indians committed a minimum of
mistakes as they outfought and out
thought the southerners in winning
their thrilling victory.
Except for the first fe\y minutes
when Troy led 7-2, the Cards were
ahead of the visitors during the en
tire first half of Friday's game—un
til Ralph Vaughn dropped in a field
goal and two foul shots just before
the hall to give the Trojans a 22-19
advantage at the gun.
Field goals by Don Burness and
Phil Zonne at the start of the sec
ond half put the Indians in the lead
once more, 23-22, and they held it
until the Trojans finally tied it up
at 36-all.
RED SCORING SPREE
It was at this point that Stanford
proceeded to leave the Trojans in
the ruck. While Vaughn was sink
ing a foul shot, Harlan Copsey
pumped a field goal and a free
throw into the hoop, Don Burness
sank a difficult one-hander, and
Zonne plopped another foul through
the netting to put the Cards out
ahead 42-37 with two minutes to go.
They nursed that lead successfully
although Clem Ruh narrowed the
margin just before the gun by
sneaking under the basket and
dropping in a set-up.
The Indians couldn't do anything
wrong Friday. The tricky offense
Dean taught them just for this se-
lies worked perfectly. Tom Mc-
Garvin, the best rebounder on the
Trojan team, was drawn out into
the front ranks, while Vaughn, the
poorest defensive player for the vis
itors, was lured into the important
"hole" spot.
ZONNE IN TOP FORM
And another estimable factor in
the Cards' triumph was Captain
Phil Zonne's shooting. Phil potted
six field goals in ten attempts, while
the best the highly-touted Vaughn
could do was sink four in seventeen
attempts. With their foul shots
thrown in, Phil nabbed high-point
honors for the evening with 17
points and Vaughn was runner-up
with 15.

RED SCORING SPREE
It was at this point that Stanford
proceeded to leave the Trojans in
the ruck. While Vaughn was sink
ing a foul shot, Harlan Copsey
pumped a field goal and a free
throw into the hoop, Don Burness
sank a difficult one-hander, and
Zonne plopped another foul through
the netting to put the Cards out
ahead 42-37 with two minutes to go.
They nursed that lead successfully
although Clem Ruh narrowed the
margin just before the gun by
sneaking under the basket and
dropping in a set-up.
The Indians couldn't do anything
wrong Friday. The tricky offense
Dean taught them just for this se-
lies worked perfectly. Tom Mc-
Garvin, the best rebounder on the
Trojan team, was drawn out into
the front ranks, while Vaughn, the
poorest defensive player for the vis
itors, was lured into the important
"hole" spot.
ZONNE IN TOP FORM
And another estimable factor in
the Cards' triumph was Captain
Phil Zonne's shooting. Phil potted
six field goals in ten attempts, while
the best the highly-touted Vaughn
could do was sink four in seventeen
attempts. With their foul shots
thrown in, Phil nabbed high-point
honors for the evening with 17
points and Vaughn was runner-up
with 15.
However, Saturday was the Tro
jans' night and Coach Sam Barry's
proteges made mince-meat of their
erstwhile conquerors. They guarded
the Cards so tightly that half-time
score was 17-6, and could have been
worse if the Trojans had been on
their shooting eyes.
