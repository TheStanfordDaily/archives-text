# New Debate Manager Issues Policy Change
## 
### 
Speaking opportunities at Stanford will be considerably broadened
tins quarter, according to a declaration ol' policy by Bob Putnam, debale
manager. Putnam was formally appointed to his position at last week's
Ex Committee meeting to replace Jack Strain, who was graduated.
Gist of the policy is that debating and informal events have liereto-

i fore been confined to those definitely<
| "out" for the activity, while those
j interested in speaking only occa
| sionally have not felt free to volun
j leer for just one or two engagements
, a quarter.
! A portion of Putnam's statement
j reads as follows: "Stanford is from
j time to time asked to participate in
j outside, informal speaking events,
j We want to give anyone interested
I an opportunity to get out and ad
| dress audiences throughout North
â€¢ ern California. Good contacts are
! made on these trips and transpor
tation and accommodation costs are
paid.
EXPERIENCE VALUABLE
"We feel that this type of expe
rience would be particularly valu
able to students with specific and
I definite ideas on subjects of current
interest. It would give them a
chance to present their opinions to
an audience and thereby evaluate
them."
Among the invitations thus far re
ceived by the debate manager is
one from the Mill Valley Commun
ity Forum for speakers to discuss
current economic questions of na
tional importance. Pro and con
views will be presented, and in the
manner of the Town Meeting of the
Air, the audience will submit
I questions.
Another invitation has come from
the Lindsay Town Meeting request
! ing speakers to participate in discus
i sions of America's foreign policy, the
! Wagner Labor Relations Act, and
; Socialized Medicine.
IN FEBRUARY. MARCH
These engagements are for Feb
j ruary and March and. according to
I Putnam, "now is the time to get
j started." Further information will
| be available in the debate office, on
i the second floor of Old Union, be
! tween 4 and 5 o'clock.
Those signed up to try out for the
S Hawaiian debate tour should con
; suit the sign-up sheet outside Le-
I land T. Chapin's office some time to
| day. The tryouts will be held to
i morrow in Room 200R between 1:30
! and 6 o'clock.
