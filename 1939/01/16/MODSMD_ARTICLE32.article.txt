# Frosh Five to Face Lowell after Wins
## 
### 
After a hectic week-end of basketball and pledging—basketball really
took a hack scut to activities on the Row—Stanford's yearling cagers. re
viewing their twin victories, must have made an awful vow today.
That vow—if they took it—would concern the serious business of get
ting down to brass tacks and taking a quick look at what looms tor them

in the coming four weeks of basket
ball, starting this Friday and Sat
urday nights.
The pride and joy of the Bay cir
cuit, Lowell High School, invades
the Pavilion first and then Sacra
mento Junior College has the floor
in the second game. It's a mean
assignment for the freshmen to
tackle, especially if they look back
at the performances against Galileo
and Piedmont.
First, the frosh put on a ragged
exhibition but played just well
enough to swamp Galileo, 37-16.
Then the team pulled itself together
for a tougher assignment and came
out with a none too effective 41-35
triumph over Piedmont.
After it was all over, Coach H. B.
Lee, granting to the boys the fact
that tliey could hardly l'eel like play
ing with pledge week as the chief
center of attraction, mapped out a
drill this week which ought to make
up for any lack of concentrated
practices last week.
With labs this afternoon, Lee has
scheduled a "get-together" party,
which will probably turn out to be
one of the toughest Monday drills
of the season. Tuesday will be an
other drill, both long and hhrd. A
scrimmage, which should polish
some of their ragged edges which
turned up over the week-end
games, will occupy Wednesday; and
Thursday will be a tapering-off
practice for timing.
With a comparatively easy as
signment in Galileo Friday, the
yearling floormen found a different
situation in Piedmont. Putting Bill
Cowden on Jack Dana, the pivot
ace of the Bay quintet., Stanford in
stead found that one Frank McCann
should have been watched more
closely as the tricky forward dump
ed 17 points into the hoop for high
point honors.
Bob Penn almost matched his ef
fort with 14 points but got six foul
shots and only four field goals,
which were scored mostly through
fast-breaking plays set. up by Cow
den, Ollie Hamlin, Dick Ray, and
Vern Hoffman. With a brilliant per
formance while he was in there,
Chuck Smith hit the hoop for eight
points, and with Bob Scharbaeh
formed the perfect substitute team
for Hamlin and Hoffman.
Matching the Piedmont cagers
with 15 field goals, the freshmen
nevertheless scored most of their
shots from far out as they ran up
against the zone defense for the
first time this season and had diffi
culty in breaking out into the clear
for close-in attempts. The differ
ence was Stanford's meshing 11 of
15 free-throw attempts.
In meeting Lowell and Sacra
mento, the frosh will be up against
two tall outfits, which should test
Lee's own lanky quintet with Penn
at 6:5, Cowden at 6:3, and Lew Reese
at 6:3. Reese favored an injured
ankle, sitting on the bench during
both games.

ence was Stanford's meshing 11 of
15 free-throw attempts.
In meeting Lowell and Sacra
mento, the frosh will be up against
two tall outfits, which should test
Lee's own lanky quintet with Penn
at 6:5, Cowden at 6:3, and Lew Reese
at 6:3. Reese favored an injured
ankle, sitting on the bench during
both games.
After a hectic week-end of basketball and pledging—basketball really
took a hack scut to activities on the Row—Stanford's yearling cagers. re
viewing their twin victories, must have made an awful vow today.
That vow—if they took it—would concern the serious business of get
ting down to brass tacks and taking a quick look at what looms tor them

in the coming four weeks of basket
ball, starting this Friday and Sat
urday nights.
The pride and joy of the Bay cir
cuit, Lowell High School, invades
the Pavilion first and then Sacra
mento Junior College has the floor
in the second game. It's a mean
assignment for the freshmen to
tackle, especially if they look back
at the performances against Galileo
and Piedmont.
First, the frosh put on a ragged
exhibition but played just well
enough to swamp Galileo, 37-16.
Then the team pulled itself together
for a tougher assignment and came
out with a none too effective 41-35
triumph over Piedmont.
After it was all over, Coach H. B.
Lee, granting to the boys the fact
that tliey could hardly l'eel like play
ing with pledge week as the chief
center of attraction, mapped out a
drill this week which ought to make
up for any lack of concentrated
practices last week.
With labs this afternoon, Lee has
scheduled a "get-together" party,
which will probably turn out to be
one of the toughest Monday drills
of the season. Tuesday will be an
other drill, both long and hhrd. A
scrimmage, which should polish
some of their ragged edges which
turned up over the week-end
games, will occupy Wednesday; and
Thursday will be a tapering-off
practice for timing.
With a comparatively easy as
signment in Galileo Friday, the
yearling floormen found a different
situation in Piedmont. Putting Bill
Cowden on Jack Dana, the pivot
ace of the Bay quintet., Stanford in
stead found that one Frank McCann
should have been watched more
closely as the tricky forward dump
ed 17 points into the hoop for high
point honors.
Bob Penn almost matched his ef
fort with 14 points but got six foul
shots and only four field goals,
which were scored mostly through
fast-breaking plays set. up by Cow
den, Ollie Hamlin, Dick Ray, and
Vern Hoffman. With a brilliant per
formance while he was in there,
Chuck Smith hit the hoop for eight
points, and with Bob Scharbaeh
formed the perfect substitute team
for Hamlin and Hoffman.
Matching the Piedmont cagers
with 15 field goals, the freshmen
nevertheless scored most of their
shots from far out as they ran up
against the zone defense for the
first time this season and had diffi
culty in breaking out into the clear
for close-in attempts. The differ
ence was Stanford's meshing 11 of
