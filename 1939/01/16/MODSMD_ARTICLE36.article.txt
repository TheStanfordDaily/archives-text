# THE 						STANFORD DAILY SPORTS
## SIDELINE SLANTS... 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
I ET'S talk about Friday night.
But before we get the idea that
(he Cards deserved their trouncing
Saturday night, we must realize
what the boys were up against.
Overcoming a team that has every
advantage is no easy task, and the
Stanfords sapped their physical and
nervous energy in lighting a smooth
combination of Trojan veterans to 1
defeat. And the Cards are to be ■
greatly admired for being able to 1
hold out in a second battle as well j
as they did.
Stanford's victory in its confer
ence opener brought to light some i
comforting truths. We have known
and contended for some time that
Phil Zonne was to become hot when
the season got under way and that
\vhen that time came, Stanford
would find itself on the'long end of
a score.
Zonnc had a heavy assignment
early this season with the job of
playing both backboards, and it
was not until the Santa Clara
game that Coach Everett Dean was
able to relieve the lanky captain
of part of this duty. Zonnc con
tinued his efforts at both ends of
the court, but still felt relieved of
his double responsibility and had
more time to think about sinking
his shots, which he did with
amazing accuracy. As for his de
lensive work, you could ask no
more.
Don Burness played a fine game,
marked by unusually fine timing in
playing the defensive backboard,
but it is more to his credit that he
broke into his first college game,
one of the toughest, and turned in a
remarkable performance under the
handicap of an injury.
Kenny Davidson found himself in
every department of the game. As
though it was not enough that he
was sinking his shots from right and
left, he guarded Ralph Vaughn,
Southern California's high scorer,
in a fashion deserving of credit no
end.
Bob Burnett and Leon Lafaille
entered the week-end's tilts un
der the distinct handicap of a so
journ in the rest home with colds
that necessarily impaired their ac
curacy and endurance. Coach
Dean knew their plight and no
doubt made comforting discover
ies concerning his other men.
Bill Rapp played a talented re
bound game, and marked himself as
an excellent ball-hog; Harlan Cop
sey showed amazing speed and ag
gressiveness; and Dick Lyon turned
in a fine performance on the back
boards.

Jt was a familiar sight to see Peter
Fay and Jack Brenner cutting
back and forth all over the field in
Saturday's intersquad rugby con-

test. Not only Stanford football
stars were on the field, but there
were numerous carry-overs from
soccer and baseball.
They played a spirited game,
and added color to a contest that
is exciting in itself. That people
sometimes discover new thrills
from games they do not often see
was evidenced by a large group of
spectators on the sidelines.

Sardines are lucky they d<m't
have to carry on fistic battles with
each other as sparring partners,
anyone who has entered the all-
University boxing tournament
will agree.
Boxing facilities in the Encina
gym are good but limited in space,
and those who are getting into shape
for Thursday night's battles—not to
mention dozens of elementary box
ing students—are fore d to spar and
skip rope in shifts.
Bricks aren't r ' r, and the
walls of the gym I hardly be
stretched, but there would be ample
space if the B.A.C. were to remove
a six-inch wall that separates the
punching bags from the mat and
ring room.
