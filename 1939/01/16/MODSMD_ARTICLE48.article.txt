THIS is a high-schoolish editorial.
It has to be to fit the high-schoolish actions
of the Stanford rooters at Friday's basketball
game.
Every editorial which shush-shushes obvious
ly unsportsmanlike tactics or blasts unseemly
demonstrations takes on a tone which seldom
accomplishes anything.
Every rooter at Friday's game who believed
that the officials could be birded into winning
the game for Stanford, and who acted on this
belief, accomplished nothing.
Obvious as this writing is, speaking earnestly
of decent conduct and fair tactics from non
players, it is not as obvious as the type of
rooter who messed up the Pavilion air.
And while the words to this song-and-dance
editorial are old, they are at least well-known
enough to sing. Which is more than can be
added concerning the way in which Stanford's
yell-leaders led Stanford's songs Friday night.
The whole affair, in type and in the Pavilion,
is high-schoolish.
In fact, it out-high schools most high schools.
Because Stanford does not like S.C., because
tradition has it that during any athletic contest a
spirit of rivalry must exist, Stanford invites its
sports guests to a mixture of abuse and verbal
mayhem which is a long way from good clean
fun.
However, it is pleasant to know that only
verbal evidences of poor sportsmanship have
been shown so far—no actual dismembering
of a dangerous player on the opposite side.
It is pleasant to know that Stanford breeds
refined boors.
