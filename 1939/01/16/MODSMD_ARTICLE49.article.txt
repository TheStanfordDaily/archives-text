# That Nasty Car Menace
## 
### 
SOONER or later, an editorial writer is ap
proached with the urge to "get cars off
the campus." Usually, the speaker is either (1)
someone with no car and an inferiority com
plex, or (2) someone with a car who couldn't
find a place to park and when he did, got a
fender smashed. Campus Opinioner who writes
on the subject today may be neither.
But the picture he paints of a earless campus,
and the horrors of student life which he sees
directly attributable to automobiles, make one
suspicious.
At least he is guilty of mistaking symptoms
for causes.
And in the second place, only a very few
car owners are guilty of the faults which he
ascribes to all. As regards the hello tradition,
and its decease (along with all other Stanford
traditions), one might point out that it's not the
cars who don't say hello, but the men in them.
And if those men (and women) drive by with
their noses high, one can add equally well
that their hellos when walking on Quad are no
more frequent.
Nor can one assume that gasoline at Stanford
has some sort of God-given urge to be mixed
with alcohol. As a matter of fact, the Univer
sity's greatest liquor blow-off came back in the
good old days, when cars were still known as
horseless carriages.
Perhaps, however, Campus Opinioner is be
ing subtle. Perhaps he means: "Take away
cars, and those who use them undemocratically
will go too." But if that is his plan, he is using
a battleship to fish for sardines.
For the most part, empty parking lots would
be about the only apparent change in Stanford's
face were cars to vanish. The statement is not
so obvious as it sounds. For those to whom cars
are a means to a social end little would be
done. They would still be pseudo-aristocratic,
a parasitic element at Stanford. But for the
great majority of car owners, who use their
property as they would use any other conve
nience, the deprivation would be unwarranted.
Campus Opinioner detects signs of decay
at Stanford. To get rid of the disease, he would
lop off the outward manifestations. He would
saw off an arm of the man with a handful of
poison oak.
Without stopping to think that it would prob
ably spread to another part of his body. If a car
is owned by a snob, he will persist in his snob
bishness, car or no.
And if he's not a snob, why take his car
away?

ably spread to another part of his body. If a car
is owned by a snob, he will persist in his snob
bishness, car or no.
And if he's not a snob, why take his car
away?
SOONER or later, an editorial writer is ap
proached with the urge to "get cars off
the campus." Usually, the speaker is either (1)
someone with no car and an inferiority com
plex, or (2) someone with a car who couldn't
find a place to park and when he did, got a
fender smashed. Campus Opinioner who writes
on the subject today may be neither.
But the picture he paints of a earless campus,
and the horrors of student life which he sees
directly attributable to automobiles, make one
suspicious.
At least he is guilty of mistaking symptoms
for causes.
And in the second place, only a very few
car owners are guilty of the faults which he
ascribes to all. As regards the hello tradition,
and its decease (along with all other Stanford
traditions), one might point out that it's not the
cars who don't say hello, but the men in them.
And if those men (and women) drive by with
their noses high, one can add equally well
that their hellos when walking on Quad are no
more frequent.
Nor can one assume that gasoline at Stanford
has some sort of God-given urge to be mixed
with alcohol. As a matter of fact, the Univer
sity's greatest liquor blow-off came back in the
good old days, when cars were still known as
horseless carriages.
Perhaps, however, Campus Opinioner is be
ing subtle. Perhaps he means: "Take away
cars, and those who use them undemocratically
will go too." But if that is his plan, he is using
a battleship to fish for sardines.
For the most part, empty parking lots would
be about the only apparent change in Stanford's
face were cars to vanish. The statement is not
so obvious as it sounds. For those to whom cars
are a means to a social end little would be
done. They would still be pseudo-aristocratic,
a parasitic element at Stanford. But for the
great majority of car owners, who use their
property as they would use any other conve
nience, the deprivation would be unwarranted.
Campus Opinioner detects signs of decay
at Stanford. To get rid of the disease, he would
lop off the outward manifestations. He would
saw off an arm of the man with a handful of
poison oak.
