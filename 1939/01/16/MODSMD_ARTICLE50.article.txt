BUT while Stanford's rooting section fouled
itself out this week-end, Stanford's basket
ball, in its first conference competition, sur
prised S.C., surprised itself, and made an aus
picious opening for Stanford's new coach.
S.C. was purported to be able to snatch
feathers from the Indian's topknot with one
hand used for picking his teeth; he was mis
taken. Stanford thought that without the mighty

Luisetti and last year's close-knit first string,
the Indian would be left without a blanket to
cover his lack. Stanford was mistaken.
So with a win-one. lose-one start, Stanford
may begin to fill the Pavilion again, instead
of leaving several hundred tickets for general
admission. The money will be well spent.
At least, in yelling.
