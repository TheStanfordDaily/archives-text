# BULL SESSION
## AFTER THE BRAWL IS OVER 
### JOHN COBBS 
IVOW that the sacred bonds have been forged and
rushing has become a memory instead of a men
ace, freshmen and fraternity men are cultivating
looks of experience and are stating their opinions of
rushing in the impressive past tense. One of the first
subjects to come up for rationalization is the system
of informal pledging before the official date. Living
room philosophers develop elaborate arguments justi
fying the practice. Freshmen wander off into intro
spection, describing how they felt when they were ap
proached informally.
As a matter of fact, the system of early pledging
needs no support either from philosophy or from true
confessions. It is a practical necessity, and it is im
plicitly sanctioned by the Stanford rushing rules.
With fortifications like that the system can withstand
indefinitely the siege of its critics, and it does not
need protection by volunteer, philosophic minute
men.
«■ t< it m
The whole Stanford fraternity rushing system is
built around the idea that freshmen and Row men
will sort themselves out informally before that radiant
day when pledge pins ai*e permitted to come out of
inside pockets. The interfraternity rules say that in
formal contact between Row and Encina shall be legal.
And this provision was not written into the rules to
promote camaraderie or to keep freshmen from being
lonely during the long evenings. It was intended to
make early pledging possible.
Freshmen are not clairvoyant. If anything they
are the contrary. Aiid Row men are not talented either
in mental telepathy or in hypnotism. Something more
than symbolism and double talk is needed to make
the pledge day machinery work.
Us * * *
t\RATERNITY men often forget this, and sneak forth
on their trips to Encina looking like the third
conspirator in Macbeth. They preface their invitations
with involved explanations, and they risk their hope
of Salvation by telling the frosh that he is such an
incredibly good man that they just can't wait.
Freshmen usually know nothing about the pledge
system anyhow. Some of them shy at an early bid
like a Victorian girl at a questionable story. They
feel somehow that their honor is menaced, their in
tegrity threatened with seduction. Others develop a
sort of double standard outlook, letting the fraternities
do the worrying about ethics. Both types have a
vague, but not displeasing, feeling of wickedness when
they take a pin early. ,
In their sweet innocence they forget that the pledge
day routine is based on the idea that freshmen and
Row have already matched up. They overlook the
fact that without, previous arrangements, the orderly
line that moves through Encina office would turn into
a cross between a hunger riot and a guessing game.
Early pledging permits freshmen to make up their
minds before the official ten seconds. And it gives
them the option of backing out without any furor if
they decide to change. Any system that does that
needs no rationalization. It is quite capable of taking
care of itself.

t\RATERNITY men often forget this, and sneak forth
on their trips to Encina looking like the third
conspirator in Macbeth. They preface their invitations
with involved explanations, and they risk their hope
of Salvation by telling the frosh that he is such an
incredibly good man that they just can't wait.
Freshmen usually know nothing about the pledge
system anyhow. Some of them shy at an early bid
like a Victorian girl at a questionable story. They
feel somehow that their honor is menaced, their in
tegrity threatened with seduction. Others develop a
sort of double standard outlook, letting the fraternities
do the worrying about ethics. Both types have a
vague, but not displeasing, feeling of wickedness when
they take a pin early. ,
In their sweet innocence they forget that the pledge
day routine is based on the idea that freshmen and
Row have already matched up. They overlook the
fact that without, previous arrangements, the orderly
line that moves through Encina office would turn into
a cross between a hunger riot and a guessing game.
Early pledging permits freshmen to make up their
minds before the official ten seconds. And it gives
them the option of backing out without any furor if
they decide to change. Any system that does that
needs no rationalization. It is quite capable of taking
care of itself.
IVOW that the sacred bonds have been forged and
rushing has become a memory instead of a men
ace, freshmen and fraternity men are cultivating
looks of experience and are stating their opinions of
rushing in the impressive past tense. One of the first
subjects to come up for rationalization is the system
of informal pledging before the official date. Living
room philosophers develop elaborate arguments justi
fying the practice. Freshmen wander off into intro
spection, describing how they felt when they were ap
proached informally.
As a matter of fact, the system of early pledging
needs no support either from philosophy or from true
confessions. It is a practical necessity, and it is im
plicitly sanctioned by the Stanford rushing rules.
With fortifications like that the system can withstand
indefinitely the siege of its critics, and it does not
need protection by volunteer, philosophic minute
men.

The whole Stanford fraternity rushing system is
built around the idea that freshmen and Row men
will sort themselves out informally before that radiant
day when pledge pins ai*e permitted to come out of
inside pockets. The interfraternity rules say that in
formal contact between Row and Encina shall be legal.
And this provision was not written into the rules to
promote camaraderie or to keep freshmen from being
lonely during the long evenings. It was intended to
make early pledging possible.
Freshmen are not clairvoyant. If anything they
are the contrary. Aiid Row men are not talented either
in mental telepathy or in hypnotism. Something more
than symbolism and double talk is needed to make
the pledge day machinery work.
