# Lightly. . . And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
TENDERLY PLATONIC
Several times when her escort was engaged in
doing one thing or another, she found herself free to
wander to and fro as she wished at. the party. The
circumstances were perfect for striking up a beautiful
friendship with someone during her footloose inter
vals. And she did, with a very tall guy.
Only she was very short herself.
"I would like to dance with you," her tall friend
said, "honest I would. Only you're just, too short and
I'm just too tall."
Bui. their friendship, brief and restricted as it was,
was a beautiful thing that evening.
The next day she was a little surprised on answer
ing the phone to hear the voice of her very tall, new
friend.
"You know," he said, "I think you're swell. Only
you're just too short, and I'm just too tall. But if any
one ever docs anything you don't like, anything, just
tell me. I'll sock him good for you."
Chivalrously she answered, "That goes for me, too."

UNORTHODOX
Calmly showing their indifference to all this rush
ing and pledging hullabaloo that went on the end of
last week, the guys in the firehouse were out in front
of their place playing a little touch football. A La
gunita gal came by and watched for a while.
"Can I play, too?"
Sure, she could play. They gave her the ball and
she kicked it. Pretty good. They let her run with it.
She'll do. They showed her how to pass.
They put her on one of the teams. She fitted in
nicely. In short, a good time was had by all.
And, in the manner of the popular song, when the
game was over, they said you look good to us. For a
bunch of non-pledging bachelors, they did a funny
thing: they made her their house mother. With a
badge and all.
Which was a nice thing to do.

TOO TRUE
An alumnus, '.'{7 vintage, was back on tlic Farm a
couple of days ago looking around. Nothing impressed
him so much as the roller skaters.
He asked, with a mixture of polite curiosity,
resignation, and cynicism in his voice. "Hmm. When arc
they going to start the intramural marble tourna
ment?"

WARNING
Personally, I think all this business of blocking off
that street near Roble and the one in front of the
Libe. and of restricting the parking on the South Side
of the Education building and reserving the choice
parking space for the faculty is simply boring-from
within tactics on the part of the administration.
I expect a Dies committee investigation.
