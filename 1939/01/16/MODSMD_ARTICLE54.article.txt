## "HELLO" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In accordance with the "hello" j
tradition at Stanford I have been |
making some observations with the j
result that I must here account the
various forms of unspoken "hellos"
that have greeted me.
There are several expressions to |
he confronted as you walk from
classes, left-over expressions.
It is not especially pleasing to be !
greeted by a broad grin, return it, j
and then realize it was meant for
the fortunate person preceding you. |
Or, in the same way, to be the re- !
ceiver of a midnight scowl sweeping j
you from higher thoughts into the
depths of gloom, and curiosity as to j
the cause of the passec's grouch—no i
breakfast, bad marks or something. J
There are other sccond-hand j
faces that have gone by me, v-igueiy
pleased ones, cynical and blank i
ones, all these have passed me and 1
once out of every seven times (I've !
counted) I get my own special I
"hello" or smile.
Why isn't there a drive to control
facial muscles and to do away with \
left-over expressions?
Wonderingly yours,
