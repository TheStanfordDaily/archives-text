# HARNESS THE HORSE

The Editor, Sir:
Recently at an informal gather
ing of Stanford Alumni in Los An
geles I was indeed surprised to find
the discussion centered about the
disastrous effect of the automobile
upon the life of the Stanford cam
pus—a bold statement but upon
analysis found to be perfectly true.
What a long way the campus has
come from the days of the intimate
Stanford student body when every
one knew everyone and if you said
"hello" you got an answer. Why is
it that, no longer can a campus dance
compete against off-campus and
city dancing? The answer is all too
obvious. Students are now able to
get in their cars and be whisked to
the city in 45 minutes. The cry
seems to be to get away from the
campus to the highway which would
be a pcrfeclly natural reaction for
Cal students but not for Stanford
students who are favored by the
very isolation of the Farm. Yes.
Stanford is literally being pulled
apart by the car.
HOUGH ROLLED
The Stanford rough has followed
the cigar store Indian into oblivion
—and maybe good riddance but

what he stood for should go on. He
was a firm believer in democratic
spirit and action. But that same at
titude now looks to be on the way
out—behind the wheel of a 12-cyl
inder "super-super," whether you
care to admit it or not.
The biggest problem Stanford fac
es today is drinking. This menace,
if it be such, would be greatly re
duced providing students would not
drive after they had quaffed a few.
If there were no cars on the campus,
the students would have to take a
long walk before and after drink
ing. That has its advantages.
MM-HM
Imagine if you will a campus car
less except where absolutely neces
sary for off-campus students. Buss
er and trains would be chartered for
trips and I'm afraid the Palo Alto
bus line would grow rich on its ex
tended service. But don't try to tell
me that there wouldn't be better
school spirit, better scholastic rec
ords, better school dances, more and
better campus life, lower costs to
students and more genuine campus
co-operation all around. It means a
certain amount of self sacrifice but.
it would benefit the students as well
as the reputation of Stanford, par
ticularly if the students initiated the
measure.
Now there is something for you to
chew on. Go to it, you editorialists.
I'd like to see some real student ac
tion on this—and so would a lot of
other recent students.
Sincerely youi's,

The Editor, Sir:
Recently at an informal gather
ing of Stanford Alumni in Los An
geles I was indeed surprised to find
the discussion centered about the
disastrous effect of the automobile
upon the life of the Stanford cam
pus—a bold statement but upon
analysis found to be perfectly true.
What a long way the campus has
come from the days of the intimate
Stanford student body when every
one knew everyone and if you said
"hello" you got an answer. Why is
it that, no longer can a campus dance
compete against off-campus and
city dancing? The answer is all too
obvious. Students are now able to
get in their cars and be whisked to
the city in 45 minutes. The cry
seems to be to get away from the
campus to the highway which would
be a pcrfeclly natural reaction for
Cal students but not for Stanford
students who are favored by the
very isolation of the Farm. Yes.
Stanford is literally being pulled
apart by the car.
HOUGH ROLLED
The Stanford rough has followed
the cigar store Indian into oblivion
—and maybe good riddance but

what he stood for should go on. He
was a firm believer in democratic
spirit and action. But that same at
titude now looks to be on the way
out—behind the wheel of a 12-cyl
inder "super-super," whether you
care to admit it or not.
The biggest problem Stanford fac
es today is drinking. This menace,
if it be such, would be greatly re
duced providing students would not
drive after they had quaffed a few.
If there were no cars on the campus,
the students would have to take a
long walk before and after drink
ing. That has its advantages.
MM-HM
Imagine if you will a campus car
less except where absolutely neces
sary for off-campus students. Buss
er and trains would be chartered for
trips and I'm afraid the Palo Alto
bus line would grow rich on its ex
tended service. But don't try to tell
me that there wouldn't be better
school spirit, better scholastic rec
ords, better school dances, more and
better campus life, lower costs to
students and more genuine campus
co-operation all around. It means a
certain amount of self sacrifice but.
it would benefit the students as well
as the reputation of Stanford, par
ticularly if the students initiated the
measure.
Now there is something for you to
chew on. Go to it, you editorialists.
I'd like to see some real student ac
tion on this—and so would a lot of
other recent students.
