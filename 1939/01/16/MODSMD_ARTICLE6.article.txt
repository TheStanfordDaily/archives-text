differences exist between the people

have Germany and France.

viewpoint, Dr. Guerard will also
describe the internal situation of
the country in terms of how it. af
fects the international political pic
ture, explaining that "the internal
situation of France is much more
constant than the sudden shifts in
the political scene have indicated."
Subjects to be included in the
lecture include brief discussions of
the Versailles Treaty and the part
France has played in the revision of
its terms, the problem of French
colonial possessions, and the rela
tionship of this factor to the political
