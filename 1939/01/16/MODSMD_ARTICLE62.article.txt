# Oliver Advocates Spiritual Power

"It is one thing to come to church,
but it is another to worship," said
Rev. Thomas E. Oliver, acting chap
lain of the University, in his ser
mon yesterday, "Traffic Laws of the
Temple."
There is a great deal of religious
interest today, but not spiritual
power, he continued. "Too many
of us never come close enough to
the real spirit of worship to have
anything happen to us spiritually.
"We must not be spectators around
the rim, but we must go through to
the core of religion to receive any
satisfaction," he concluded.
