# Culture, Morals Need Emphasis, Says Alumni
## 
### 
Today cultural and moral training in American universities does not
receive sufficient emphasis.
This is the verdict of nearly 3000 Stanford alumni balloting in the Illus
trated Review's poll of public opinion, conducted monthly by Editor
Norris James.
At a time when, apparently, cultural and intellectual independence

.has been discarded for regimented
thinking and when ethical codes
have been tossed to the winds, form
er Farm students, by a vote of over
two to one, show their disapproval
of university curricula that slight
cultural and moral education.
Women were stronger than men in
their condemnation of American
schools for neglecting these two is
sues. Similarly, class groups from
1892 to 1910 voted three to one that
colleges were slighting cultural and
moral training.
More recent graduates, those who
received their degrees from 1931 to
1938, found their days on the Quad
less devoid of ethical and intellec
tual stimuli.
Answering Editor James' ques
tion, "Are American universities to
day placing sufficient emphasis upon
cultural and moral training?" 1,431
alumni voted yes; 2,998 said no.
Voicing the opinion of recent
graduates, one spokesman from the
Class of '29 thinks that social train
ing is being neglected. "The gravest
weakness apparent in the man who
has recently received his college
diploma is his inability to under
stand people and to deal with them
successfully. Due to the time he
must spend in college studies, he is
generally deprived of the experi
ence in human relations which he
might have gained otherwise.
"If the teaching staff of Stanford
would make a concerted efTort to
encourage the reasoning, originality,
and individuality in students that
other colleges and universities arc
doing their best to destroy, being a
Stanford man would mean twice
what it signifies even now."
