Stanford University women
will report to the Presidio of
San Francisco this morning to work
on the building of fortifications";
thus the emergency order of the
de fense staff of the President of the
United States.
Such an idea sounds impossible,
fantastic to hundreds of University
women, living comfortably in their
houses and halls, their minds oc
cupied with a thousand inconse
quential odds and ends. Even
though such a situation seems ridic
ulous on the 120 th meridian west,
still, on the prime meridian, similar
orders are being issued right this
minute.
In Barcelona every man and
woman up to 50 years of age has
been commanded to aid in build
ing defenses for the last stand of
the Spanish Republican govern
ment against the smashing forces
of Generalissimo Francisco Franco.
In their firm resolution to fight to
the last ditch, the Loyalist govern
ment is rapidly organizing suicide
squads to delay the advance of the
Insurgent army while seige forti
fications arc rushed to comple
tion around the Republican capi
tal.
The enemies of Fascism don't give
in easily, but it looks as if the
cards are definitely stacked for their
defeat. Attempting to make things
easier all the way 'round, Franco
last night delivered a radio appeal
to the people of Barcelona to sur
render and escape the certain death
that awaits them if the Rebels take
the city by storm.
But our latest picture of Loyalist
Spain shows us young girls and mid
dle aged men and women with stern,
strained faces clumsily aiding in
building barricades and digging
trenches for Democracy's last, stand
on the Iberian Peninsula. They, like
the unnamed millions through all
history, are fighting for an ideal.

FASCISM rolls on its way
to victory in Spain, France
finds herself in an extremely cm
barassing position, about to fall
into the unappetizing embrace of
three totalitarian states. The suc
cess of the Spanish Insurgents
means that within a short time
the menacing figures of Hitler,
Mussolini, and Franco probably
will stand exchanging significant
glances over the French frontier.
Meanwhile both the French and
Italian presses are doing their best
to infuriate the patriots of both na
tions. An exchange of insults has
a daily occurrence, and these
innoculations of propaganda are
showing definite results.
Mussolini's claims on France's
colonies in Africa are still unset
tled, and a final victory for the
Fascists in Spain might easily en
courage him to do something about
them. "The French are a gay peo
ple, fond of dancing and light wines."

r CIIE Irish don't like the Eng
lish, or perhaps you've heard.
Willi the final establishment of
the free state of Eire, leaving only
the Protestant counties of North
ern Ireland as a part of the Brit
ish Empire, England thought that
she had seen the last of the re
volts and uprisings that Ireland
lias been staging periodically
throughout the last few centuries.
But yesterday symptoms appeared
which may .signify that the Irish are
ready to make trouble again. Six
eases of bombing and sabotage oc
eurcd in England at. the same time
that, proclamations mysteriously ap
peared throughout Northern Ire
land demanding a supreme effort to
get rid of British rule.
The declarations, signed by the
outlawed Irish Republican Army,
may amount to nothing but the
idle, threats of a few fire-eaters,
but on the other hand it may
mean that the Irish are at it
again, that they will be content
with nothing less than complete
independence for every inch of
the Emerald Isle.
IN Washington yesterday Presi
dent Roosevelt recommended a
new means of speeding recovery;
lie suggested that social security
old-age pensions should be paid
starting next year instead of in
I!H2 as the legislation originally
provided.
At the same time the President
warned Congress against any fly-by
night scheme of social security that
might come up during this session.
With veiled, but definite, allusions
to such crack-pot ideas as the
California "ham and eggs" bill, the
Chief Executive warned the na
tion's legislators to steer clear of
any such unsound proposal. Roose
velt also recommended that the
pension provisions be broadened to
include a greater field of citizcns
rceciving benefits.
In the Senate subcommittee
considering President Roosevelt's
relief appropriation bill, things
look pretty black for the New
Deal. It is extremely doubtful
that committee members will rec
ommend that the $150,000,000 clip
ped from the bill by the House be
restored

old-age pensions should be paid
starting next year instead of in

provided.
At the same time the President
warned Congress against any fly-by

With veiled, but definite, allusions
to such crack-pot ideas as the
California "ham and eggs" bill, the
Chief Executive warned the na

any such unsound proposal. Roose

pension provisions be broadened to
include a greater field of citizcns

In the Senate subcommittee
considering President Roosevelt's

In Barcelona every man and

been commanded to aid in build

the Spanish Republican govern

In their firm resolution to fight to
the last ditch, the Loyalist govern

squads to delay the advance of the
Insurgent army while seige forti

The enemies of Fascism don't give
in easily, but it looks as if the
cards are definitely stacked for their
defeat. Attempting to make things
easier all the way 'round, Franco
last night delivered a radio appeal
to the people of Barcelona to sur
render and escape the certain death
that awaits them if the Rebels take
the city by storm.
But our latest picture of Loyalist
Spain shows us young girls and mid

strained faces clumsily aiding in
building barricades and digging
trenches for Democracy's last, stand
on the Iberian Peninsula. They, like
the unnamed millions through all
history, are fighting for an ideal.
