# Sororities S.P.U. Issue
## 
### 
Ignoring party lines, a general |
caucus of members of the Stanford j
Political Union will be held in Room
200H of the English corner tonight j
at 7 o'clock.
Announcement has been made by '
President Vincent. Lemmon that j
members will at that tune indicate |
their preference on "Resolved, that j
sororities should be abandoned on J
the campus," the question which !
will come up for debate at Thurs- j
day evening's regular meeting.
Jean Halliburton has been named
to present the negative side of the '
resolution, but as yet no one has
been chosen from the halls to sup- i
port the measure.
Since the usual divisions of Con
servative, Liberal, and Labor will
be abandoned for debate on the j
question of local interest, party j
leaders will give way to Fran Du- ]
Bois and Bob Sheldon, who have |
been arbitrarily named to lead the j
discussion.
