# Hall Defines Education,
## Philosopher Opposes Views of Dr. Brown In Second of Series 
### OLIVER WYMAN 
"The most distinguishing feature
between the terms education and
propaganda," said Everett W. Hall,
associate professor of philosophy,
during his address in the auditorium
of the Education Building last night,
"is that propaganda is concealed
controversy while education ls
avowed controversy."
In differentiating between the
terms in this way, Professor Hall op
posed the view presented by Dr.
Brown, who, in his lecture last week,
came to the conclusion that "educa
tion is propaganda,"
Mr. Hall considered tliat both
terms, although they might be in
cluded under the connotation of
"advocacy," were, in their deroga
tory meanings, essentially different,
and must be considered so since they
are associated with entirely different
attitudes in their everyday usage.

DIFFERENT ATTITUDES

"When wc consider education and
propaganda under a general head,"
said the professor, "we note that they
both refer to ways of affecting peo
ple, but at the same time we sec that
in their narrower sense they imply
entirely different attitudes.
"In our daily experience we are
aware that we consider any implica
tion of propaganda in a suspicious
sense, whereas we usually think of
education as that process whereby
critical faculties are aroused."
In light of this differentiation, Dr.
Hall proceeded to explain the nar
row definition of propaganda as
qualified in the phrase "concealed
controversy."

NARROW OUTLOOK

"Every question or proposition
which may be presented to a people
for consideration," said Dr. Hall,
"must naturally have more than one
aspect, but if such a proposition is
advertised from only one angle, if
only one aspect is examined, and
pretense is made that there is only
that one side, it is nothing more than
a form of high-pressure propa
ganda."
Dr. Hall went on to explain that in
this way part of the case was being
concealed, and only those aspects
were brought to one's attention
which would shift public opinion or
action into the channels desired by
those issuing the information.
"In a general sense," continued the
professor, "the propagandist makes
an attempt to force the individual's
line of thought into certain lines the
value of which he will not judge
through his own faculties."

EDUCATION CONTRAST

"I) is the propagandist's object, to
make up the recipient's mind for him,
and hence eliminate nil possibility of
questioning the so-called 'authori
tative sources' of information."
In contrast to this Dr. Hall dis
cussed education as that, form of
advocacy which recognizes all the
possibilities with regard to debatable
topics, and presents them in their
most obvious light.
"In thi.s way," concluded the pro
fessor, "we note the difference !><•-
t ween this form of advocacy which
is impartial, and the veiled, decep
tive, and limited perspective of
propaganda."

cluded under the connotation of
"advocacy," were, in their deroga
tory meanings, essentially different,
and must be considered so since they
are associated with entirely different
attitudes in their everyday usage.

DIFFERENT ATTITUDES

"When wc consider education and
propaganda under a general head,"
said the professor, "we note that they
both refer to ways of affecting peo
ple, but at the same time we sec that
in their narrower sense they imply
entirely different attitudes.
"In our daily experience we are
aware that we consider any implica
tion of propaganda in a suspicious
sense, whereas we usually think of
education as that process whereby
critical faculties are aroused."
In light of this differentiation, Dr.
Hall proceeded to explain the nar
row definition of propaganda as
qualified in the phrase "concealed
controversy."

NARROW OUTLOOK

"Every question or proposition
which may be presented to a people
for consideration," said Dr. Hall,
"must naturally have more than one
aspect, but if such a proposition is
advertised from only one angle, if
only one aspect is examined, and
pretense is made that there is only
that one side, it is nothing more than
a form of high-pressure propa
ganda."
Dr. Hall went on to explain that in
this way part of the case was being
concealed, and only those aspects
were brought to one's attention
which would shift public opinion or
action into the channels desired by
those issuing the information.
"In a general sense," continued the
professor, "the propagandist makes
an attempt to force the individual's
line of thought into certain lines the
value of which he will not judge
through his own faculties."

EDUCATION CONTRAST

"I) is the propagandist's object, to
make up the recipient's mind for him,
and hence eliminate nil possibility of
questioning the so-called 'authori
tative sources' of information."
In contrast to this Dr. Hall dis
cussed education as that, form of
advocacy which recognizes all the
possibilities with regard to debatable
topics, and presents them in their
most obvious light.
"In thi.s way," concluded the pro
fessor, "we note the difference !><•-
t ween this form of advocacy which
is impartial, and the veiled, decep
tive, and limited perspective of
propaganda."
"The most distinguishing feature
between the terms education and
propaganda," said Everett W. Hall,
associate professor of philosophy,
during his address in the auditorium
of the Education Building last night,
"is that propaganda is concealed
controversy while education ls
avowed controversy."
In differentiating between the
terms in this way, Professor Hall op
posed the view presented by Dr.
Brown, who, in his lecture last week,
came to the conclusion that "educa
tion is propaganda,"
Mr. Hall considered tliat both
terms, although they might be in
cluded under the connotation of
"advocacy," were, in their deroga
tory meanings, essentially different,
and must be considered so since they
are associated with entirely different
attitudes in their everyday usage.
