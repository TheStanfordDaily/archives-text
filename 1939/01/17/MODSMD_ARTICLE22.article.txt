# Radio Audience To Hear Wilbur In Symposium
## Chicago University To Face Stanford In Air Debate 
### 
Radio dialers will have one of
their infrequent opportunities to hear
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford
President, when he conducts a .sym
posium on Jan. 28 featuring speakers
from Stanford and Chicago Univer
sities.
Dr. Wilbur's part in the broadcast
includes introducing the Stanford
representatives together with com
menting on and concluding the half
hour program which is scheduled to
start at 2:30 o'clock.
Arrangements for the broadcast
were concluded late yesterday be
tween Ed Lindblom, Chicago debate
coach; Leland T. Chapin, Stanford
debate 1 coach, and Robert Putnam,
Card debate manager. Lindblom,
who formerly attended Stanford,
held the position of debate manager
while he was here and also won the
prized Joffre medal for forensic ex
cellence.

LINDBLOM'S PLAN

It was Lindblom who conceived
the idea of a radio symposium and
who suggested most of the plans.
According to present preparations,
the college speakers will discuss
"Learning for Living," this subject
having been suggested by the book
"Higher Learning in America" by
Robert M. Hutchins, president of
Chicago.
Stanford representatives will be
first to expound their views for a
.six-minute period from San Fran
cisco and then Chicago men will
take the ether for the same length of
time from the Middle West. Con
trols will be switched back to the
coast for another six minutes and
Chicago will get the last word in.
This schedule gives each side twelve
minutes and also gives each a chance
of rebuttal by dividing that period
up.

SECOND DEBATE SET

That same evening, two other
Farm forensic men will face the
mike at 5:30 o'clock to debate Santa
Clara over the Columbia Broad
casting System. This event is part
of a series sponsored by the Radio
League of America and is conducted
among the collegiate debating group.
Definite selection of participants
for either of these radio programs
has not as yet been made. However,
announcement from the debate office
will probably be made within the
week.
