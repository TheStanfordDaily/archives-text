# Farm to 'Go Swing' In Recordings Series
## 
### JACK BURTT 
Franz Liszt and Cole Porter on the same program sounds unlikely. The
Philadelphia Symphony and Bunny Bcrigan and his men playing to the
same audience sounds impossible.
But that is what the artists named are going to do tomorrow afternoon
at 4:15 o'clock in the Choir Room of Memorial Church. The Division of
Music, in the first of a series of recorded programs of swing and classical

music, has decided to kick over the#
traces and do its part toward fur
thering the recognition of swing as
an art.
Opening the study in contrasts will
be the Czech Philharmonic Orches- j
tra playing two numbers by the,Bo- j
hemian composer Smetana, one of ,
the greatest representatives of his ;
country in the field of composition. !

GOODMAN RECORDINGS

Benny Goodman follows Smetana \
on the program, playing "Bach Goes j
to Town," from Alee Templeton's j
"Topsy-Turvy Suite," and "Opus Mj." !
Goodman's interpretation of Bach j
shows excellent artistry in arrange- j
merit and delivery, and is done in j
great good humor. Mr. Bach would
have fixed it up himself if it had
occurred to him. "Opus V 2," featur
ing Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wil
son, Dave Tough and Goodman, is j
an excellent choice as an example '
of modern swing.
Cole Porter's latest number, "My !
Heart Belongs to Daddy," will be j
given by Elisse Cooper, soloist with i
Eddie deLange's orchestra. It's about
a girl who made love to a caddy, but
her heart belonged to daddy.
Our guess as to the most interest- !
ing number on the program is I
Bunny Berigan's recording of the !
strange, haunting "In a Mist," writ- i
ten by swing's brightest soloist of !
the late 1920 s, Bix Beiderbecke. "In j
a Mist," arranged for symphony, j
would be nearly indistinguishable j
from Debussy.

PRESENT CLASSICS

Liszt's "Legend of St. Francis j
Walking on the Water" will be in- i
eluded on the program as illustrat
ing the essential unity of classical j
music and swing. Careful students I
of music have claimed to find close j
parallels between the phrases of j
Liszt and those of the masters of j
swing.
Also on the program will be Jo- |
hann Strauss' "Tales from the Vien- j
na Woods," in both conventional and I
modern manner, and selections from j
the "Symphonia Domestica" of I
Richard Strauss.
