# Cottrell Speaks On Air Series
## 'Common Sense' Of Electorate Praised 
### 
"California has proved that the
people are thoroughly interested in
registering and voting their opinions
on matters of vital concern," assert
ed Professor Edwin A. Cottrell, head
of the political science department,
when he spoke last night on "We,
the People, Do Enact" on the Stan
ford University Hour over station
KGO.
A "remarkably high batting aver- !
age of political common sense" has |
been recorded for the state's voters i
during their 2(J years of self-govern- j
merit through direct legislation, ac- !
cording to the speaker, and this I
"despite the bitter emotional bat- ;
ties over 'weird' or highly contro- I
versial proposals that have charac- !
terized many a biennial election in i
California."
That the people of the state have
understood a majority of the meas
ures presented on the ballot in past
elections, and "as a whole have
acted wisely in making their deci
sions. ' is the opinion of Dr. Cottrell,
who nevertheless cited several .short
comings in tlie present system of
direct legislation.
"Direct legislation in California
has presented as many good pro
posals as bad, but the most import
ant. point is that the issues are
separately and thoroughly .stated." j
declared Cottrell, who believes that
"great credit should be given to the
press" for clarifying ballot pro
posals, for "ambiguous wording or
hidden meanings are more readily j
explained by the newspapers than
in the official publicity pamphlet or
on the stump."
