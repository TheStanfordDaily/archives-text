## Gordy Urges Extra Driving Precautions 
### 
"Traffic conditions on the campus
last quarter were about average,"
said Gordy Davis, University pa
trolman, in a recent comment on
the conduct of Stanford drivers.
There were no serious accidents
during the lail quarter, and very
little property damage involved in
the three minor occurrences, but
with one bad crash already on the
records this quarter, Gordy empha
sized the fact that increasing care
must be exercised by campus driv
ers during the rainy season.
'"With wet streets adding an addi
tional hazard to motorists," contin
ued Gordy, "slower speeds and ex
treme caution at night should be
observed by everyone."
ISSIES WARNING
With all points of the University
so close to one another, Gordy re
stated the warning that there is no
necessity for being in a big hurry to
go from piace to place.
"The most you can do," he said,
"is to save a few seconds, and the
risk is far too great when you con
sider that this is the most motorized
canYpus in the country."
To the possibility that there may
be a general tightening of traffic
regulations from now on, Gordy re
marked that no possible number of
rules could increase the safety on
the roads.

Instead he concluded that "a little
sportsmanship, and courtesy can do
a lot more to make driving safer
lor everyone in the university."
During the i'all quarter reports
show that 192 citations were issued.
One hundred i'orty-seven of these
were for illegal parking, and the
remaining 45 for traffic violations.
As a result of these, $300 in lines
were collected by the university.
