NEW YORK, Jan. 1G (UP).â€”Ear
ly announcements from Messrs. Di-
Maggio, Foxx, Newsom, Van Mungo,
etc., warn that the annual gas at
tack, known as the holdout season,
is virtually upon us.
Jimmy Foxx, first baseman of the
Boston Red Sox and champion bats
man of the major leagues, wants
$40,000 for the 1939 season. Joe
DiMaggio, the New York Yankees'
brilliant outfielder, notifies that he'll
be satisfied this time if his salary is
boosted from 25 to 30 grand.
Big Buck Newsom of the St. Louis
Browns vows that he'll pitch nothing
but hay if brass hats in St. Louis
don't give him 20 grand, and Van
Lingle Mungo, stormy petrel of
Brooklyn's Dodgers, already has
sent back his contract because Larry
MacPhail tried to pare down his
$15,000 salary of 1938.

Farmers are now using their trac
tors an average of 500 to 750 hours a
year compared to 150 to 200 hours
a generation ago.
