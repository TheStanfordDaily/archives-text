JJEEBS LEE and his freshman
hoopsters have met their test,
and fans are beginning to turn out
in time for preliminary contests to
see a well-coached quintet piling
up points under the red S on the
score-board.
Early appearances of the frosh
five were somewhat disheartening,
and all the players on the squad
looked about the same. Even now
there are no particular standouts
head and shoulders above the rest,
but Coach Lee has had more time to
organize them into one unit, the
players themselves have had a bet
ter chance to combine their efforts,
and the mental strain of the first
quarter in college has eased off. And
they have won decisive victories
over four good high school teams.
Card freshmen mimic their big
brothers in the fast break, and
they do it very well. When they
miss out on the speed plays, they
change their tactics and strive for
possession and control with goal
tries on the conservative side.
They are particularly brainy for
neophytes, and their spirit and de
termination to carry out their as
signments can not he beat.
808 PENN is the lanky forward
who seems always to be the first
one down the floor on offense. He
sinks a good many on the fast break,
and between times shows remark
able accuracy with step-away shots
and one-handers from every corner
of the court.
DICK RAY is the short, light
footed blond who sinks most of the
Papoose tip-ins. His clever timing
at the backboard and uncanny abil
ity in anticipating his opponent's
moves make him particularly valu
able on defense.
BILL COWDEN is a 6 ft. 3-inch
center whose sturdy build makes his
height deceiving to the eye. He has
remarkable endurance, covers both
backboards, and can jump at the
basket forever without tiring. He
is an effective guard — Lee always
assigns him to the toughest oppon
ent —and will probably get the nod
on next year's varsity in that posi
t ion.
OLLIE lIAMLIN plays a consist
ent and well-rounded game at guard
for the frosh. His shortness fails to
put him to a disadvantage, and he
performs with amazing accuracy in
his passing and shooting—long shots
and one-handers in close are his
long suits. His ability to anticipate
opponents' passes give him numer
ous interceptions.
CHUCK SMITH plays a fine game
at either guard or forward. He is a
stylist with good form in every de
partment of the game, dependable
on defense and accurate on offense.
While his record with long shots is
good, his shorter ones are more no
ticeable because he tosses them from
behind his head, where no guard
can interfere.
VEIINE HOFFMAN entered Stan
ford this quarter and is already
worrying first-string guards. He has
a distinct advantage in height, and
is accurate with the most unconven
tional shots. He uses his wrists al
most entirely, and seldom leaves the
floor. His bullet-like throws at the
basket defy the customary arch
shot, but they are surprisingly ac
curate.
LEW REESE got his first real
chance more than a week ago, and
he chalked up 17 points in one game.
He did most of his scoring by one
handers from across-court drib
bles. And he is also accurate on
tip-ins and fast-break shots. He is a
spirited ball-hawk, and plays a
sound defensive game.
808 SCIIARBACH is a form
player at guard. He is a fine ball
liandler and a versatile shooter. His
greatest attribute is cool-headedness
under fire.
Besides those who have been
weeded out to carry most of the
frosh burden, he has an abundance
of fast-improving reserves who
threaten constantly to break into
the starting line-ups.
True, the Class of '42 has met its
test on the basketball court, but
harder trials are yet to come. Pre
liminary to the Cal-Stanford con
test next Friday night, the Stanford
frosh will be pitted against a highly
touted Lowell High combination.

CHUCK SMITH plays a fine game
at either guard or forward. He is a
stylist with good form in every de

on defense and accurate on offense.
While his record with long shots is
good, his shorter ones are more no
ticeable because he tosses them from
behind his head, where no guard
can interfere.
VEIINE HOFFMAN entered Stan
ford this quarter and is already
worrying first-string guards. He has
a distinct advantage in height, and
is accurate with the most unconven

floor. His bullet-like throws at the
basket defy the customary arch
shot, but they are surprisingly ac
curate.
LEW REESE got his first real
chance more than a week ago, and
he chalked up 17 points in one game.
He did most of his scoring by one
handers from across-court drib
bles. And he is also accurate on
tip-ins and fast-break shots. He is a
spirited ball-hawk, and plays a
sound defensive game.
808 SCIIARBACH is a form
player at guard. He is a fine ball
liandler and a versatile shooter. His
greatest attribute is cool-headedness
under fire.
Besides those who have been
weeded out to carry most of the
frosh burden, he has an abundance
of fast-improving reserves who
threaten constantly to break into
the starting line-ups.
True, the Class of '42 has met its

JJEEBS LEE and his freshman
hoopsters have met their test,
and fans are beginning to turn out
in time for preliminary contests to

Early appearances of the frosh
five were somewhat disheartening,
and all the players on the squad
looked about the same. Even now
there are no particular standouts
head and shoulders above the rest,
but Coach Lee has had more time to

808 PENN is the lanky forward
who seems always to be the first

of the court.
DICK RAY is the short, light

Papoose tip-ins. His clever timing
at the backboard and uncanny abil

BILL COWDEN is a 6 ft. 3-inch
center whose sturdy build makes his
height deceiving to the eye. He has
remarkable endurance, covers both
backboards, and can jump at the

is an effective guard — Lee always
assigns him to the toughest oppon

ter chance to combine their efforts,
and the mental strain of the first
quarter in college has eased off. And
they have won decisive victories
over four good high school teams.
Card freshmen mimic their big
brothers in the fast break, and
they do it very well. When they
miss out on the speed plays, they
change their tactics and strive for
possession and control with goal
tries on the conservative side.
They are particularly brainy for
neophytes, and their spirit and de
termination to carry out their as
signments can not he beat.
808 PENN is the lanky forward
who seems always to be the first
one down the floor on offense. He
sinks a good many on the fast break,
and between times shows remark
able accuracy with step-away shots
and one-handers from every corner
of the court.
DICK RAY is the short, light
footed blond who sinks most of the
Papoose tip-ins. His clever timing
at the backboard and uncanny abil
ity in anticipating his opponent's
moves make him particularly valu
able on defense.
BILL COWDEN is a 6 ft. 3-inch
center whose sturdy build makes his
height deceiving to the eye. He has
remarkable endurance, covers both
backboards, and can jump at the
basket forever without tiring. He
is an effective guard — Lee always
assigns him to the toughest oppon
ent —and will probably get the nod
on next year's varsity in that posi
t ion.
OLLIE lIAMLIN plays a consist
ent and well-rounded game at guard
for the frosh. His shortness fails to
put him to a disadvantage, and he
performs with amazing accuracy in
his passing and shooting—long shots
and one-handers in close are his
long suits. His ability to anticipate
opponents' passes give him numer
ous interceptions.
CHUCK SMITH plays a fine game
at either guard or forward. He is a
stylist with good form in every de
partment of the game, dependable
on defense and accurate on offense.
While his record with long shots is
good, his shorter ones are more no
ticeable because he tosses them from
behind his head, where no guard
can interfere.
VEIINE HOFFMAN entered Stan
ford this quarter and is already
worrying first-string guards. He has
a distinct advantage in height, and
is accurate with the most unconven
tional shots. He uses his wrists al
most entirely, and seldom leaves the
floor. His bullet-like throws at the
basket defy the customary arch
shot, but they are surprisingly ac
curate.
LEW REESE got his first real
chance more than a week ago, and
he chalked up 17 points in one game.
He did most of his scoring by one
handers from across-court drib
bles. And he is also accurate on
tip-ins and fast-break shots. He is a
spirited ball-hawk, and plays a
sound defensive game.
808 SCIIARBACH is a form
player at guard. He is a fine ball
liandler and a versatile shooter. His
greatest attribute is cool-headedness
under fire.
Besides those who have been
weeded out to carry most of the
frosh burden, he has an abundance
of fast-improving reserves who
threaten constantly to break into
the starting line-ups.
True, the Class of '42 has met its
test on the basketball court, but
harder trials are yet to come. Pre
liminary to the Cal-Stanford con
test next Friday night, the Stanford
frosh will be pitted against a highly
touted Lowell High combination.
Present San Francisco champs,
the hoys from Lowell have not
been defeated in their last 25
