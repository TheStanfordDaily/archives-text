## Varsity Cagers Rest Following Big Week-end Dean Gives Chalk-talk; Squad Slightly Below Peak Form for Bears 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor 
Stanford's battered basketball
players were given an extra day
of rest yesterday when Coach Ev
erett Dean gave them a chalk-talk
instead of practice drills. They
didn't even suit up.
The Indians are going into their
first game with California Friday
night in far from peak physical
form. Captain Phil Zonne has a
slight charley-horse, while Kenny
Davidson, Lee Lafaille, and Bob
Burnett are still suffering from
colds.
The latter three boys went through
the Southern California series badly
hampered by the sniffles, Lafaille

in particular being in such poor
shape that he could play but a short
time in each contest.
The Bears, leading the conference
following their two easy triumphs
over U.C.L.A., have already been in
stalled favorites over the Indians.
Averaging 6 feet 5 inches, Coach
Nibs Price's outfit is one of the tall
est teams in the country. The In
dians will average approximately 6
feet l\ r 2 inches but, of course, dimin
utive Bob Burnett brings it down
considerably.

scorers in the conference following
the first week-end's games:
