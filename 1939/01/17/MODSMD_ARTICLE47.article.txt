# Trackmen Set Record Marks In Early Tries
## Zagar, Moore Shine As Templeton Crew Goes Through Paces 
### 
As sure as fate — it has never
failed yet. Stanford's potentially
crack championship track and lield
squad turns in blistering record
shattering times and marks one
week after another with unusual
regularity.
At the same time, the team's
morale continues to mount, while
the squad from the captain down to
the sophomore managers are talk
ing about the meet with U.S.C. —
which is still two months or more
away.
There was no break in the way
which more early season marks
were turned in yesterday afternoon
in Coach Dink Templeton's weekly
Monday afternoon track and field
seminar on Angell Field.

ZAGAR IMPRESSIVE

Pete Zagar, the rugged footballer,
was in the spotlight this time. Paul
Moore came in second, while Bob
Kenyon and Clyde Jeffrey were
close thirds for outstanding per
formances.
There was no mistaking Zagar.
All the national discus champion
did in one of his preliminary efforts
was to toss the platter out 165 feet
—but the managers, who were run
ning the event, said it was unoffi
cial because he wasn't officially en
tered.
Zagar then cut loose with a IGI
- toss to prove that he could
make something official. He has his
eyes on setting some national rec
ords this spring and also making
the Olympic squad at the Helsing
fors Twelfth Olympiad in 194(1.

HALF-MILE RECORD

While Zagar was twirling in the
ring, Moore, the junior transfer
from Fullerton, dipped the previous
best 880-yard run record for the
practice season down to 1:56.1. For
good measure, Templeton cracked
the whip while Moore toured the
two-mile grind in a little better
than 10 minutes late in the afternoon
workout.
Templeton immediately predicted
that the half-miler would cut the
time to 1:52 the first day he offi
cially sets foot on the track in a
major meet. That'll probably be
U.S.C., just when the Indians will
need him most to match Louie Zam
perini.
