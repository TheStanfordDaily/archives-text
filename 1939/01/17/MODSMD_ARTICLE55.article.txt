# Branner White Elephant
## 
### 
OF all buildings, institutions, or organizations
at Stanford which have been called White
Elephants, one, never given that title, leads all
the restâ€”the Branner Dining Hall.
It stands gathering dust the year round, fully
equipped and tailored to fit, opened only for the
Senior Ball breakfast. This is Stanford's White
Elephant to end White Elephants.
Not through some perverseness of the ad
ministration does it remain idle, but only for the
very simple reason that, during the year that it
was first used, it failed to pay its way. Some
how, Branner and Toyon residents weren't in
terested.
And until some sort of change is recorded in
Hall opinion on the culinary problem, it will
remain locked up, gathering dust.
It is somewhat of a mystery why the Hall
should have been a dead loss, why Branner res
idents did not consider it natural to eat in the
dormitory in which they lived.
Perhaps the existence of eating clubs had
some effect. And, in passing, it might be said
that the existence of eating clubs is a masterly
solution to a Dining Hall-less hall. They should
continue.
But for the problems of a greater number of
hall residents, foraging at large for their sup
pers, the Branner dining room would seem a
logical solution. Most universities, in fact,
would consider it an inevitable one.
It is not The Daily's suggestion that the ad
ministration take a leap in the dark, open the
Dining Hall again with the prayer that this time
it will be successful. But certainly some test of
hall opinion on the question should be made.
Through the Dean of Men's office might
come a simple survey of eating conditions in
the halls, questionnaires to be filled out at
the time when $5.00 is planked down for the
right to reserve a Toyon or Branner room.
Perhaps opinion has not changed. It may be
that hall residents still prefer eating clubs or
down-town cafes. But they should be given
the opportunity of saying so, or of asking for
another chance at the eating unit.
As it stands, the University is losing money
by letting the Dining Hall stand idle. The cost
of making a brief survey would be negligible
beside the possibility of turning the White Ele
phant into a paying beast of burden.
