# Mauve Morals

YESTERDAY there appeared in The Daily an
1 old, old charge, dragged out of the moth
balls on an average of at least fifty times each
generation, and repeated in each case with a
stern and moral inflection of the voice. The
younger generation's going to the dogs, say the
Farm's alumni, and something ought to be done.
Nearly 4500 Stanford graduates balloted in
the Illustrated Review's most recent monthly
poll, some 2,998 of them agreeing that American
universities today are not placing sufficient
emphasis upon cultural and moral training. The
end product of this system, they intimate, is an
undergraduate group sadly lacking in the Finer
Points.
Granted that they do have a case, it still does
not seem altogether fair to blame the univer
sity for it. True, if collegiate manners and
morals are worse, the fault does lie to a certain
extent with the college administrations; but to
stop there is to take a view narrow in the ex
treme.
As American higher education is constituted
now, the colleges cannot play any very large
part in the progress of society. They should,
and they know it, but society won't let them.
It gives them very little positive say in shaping
events. It only permits them to reflect the in
fluences which come to them from the outside.
For this reason, if their curricula lack proper
cultural and moral training, it is because they
are suffering from the ills of an age which could
scarcely be called cultural and moral. They can
be blamed for many minor deficiencies, but the
basic trouble lies outside their power to correct.
Before they criticize too much, Farm alumni
might take that fact into account. They criticize
the colleges; but the colleges are up against a
social trend. It isn't as easy as it looks.â€”A. S. D.
