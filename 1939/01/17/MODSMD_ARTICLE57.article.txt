PROVING the old adage that it's an ill wind
that blows nobody good, from the fracas in
volving "a certain young lady" and "a certain
musical organization at Stanford" has come
action which will be of no little service to the
University.
lust under way is an Ex Committee-authorized
survey of campus activities to determine exactly
how many non-Stanfordites are concerned in
student projects. On face value, the committee's
invitation to "reveal all," issued by letter to stu

dent officers, sounds foreboding.
But far from being a local Dies Committee
investigation, the survey is prompted by the
sanest motives: unless those concerned in Stan
ford activities are actually Stanford people, no
control may be had over their actions.
Again, working on the assumption that every
non-campus participant in activities bounces a
campus aspirant out of a job, the survey may be
expected to open the activities gates a little
wider.
This survey won't crack headlines, as did a
memorable Daily questionnaire a year or so
back. But it will make sense.
