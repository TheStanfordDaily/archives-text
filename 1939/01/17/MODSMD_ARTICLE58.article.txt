## SERMONS IN STONES DEPARTMENT 
### JOHN COBBS 
IT IS NOT my custom to go stalking about with a
journalistic microscope, tracking down hidden won
ders in back offices and sneaking up on inspiring
works modestly concealed in outdated committee min
utes. But at the moment Stanford's various step
children are minding their own business and keeping
their heads down; besides that the weather is favor
able for gentle philosophy. And so I find myself re
garding the current interviews for the activity card
file with a sort of wonders-of-science-made-plain-for
the-layman attitude.
The card file system works quietly, and the campus
knows its operation only through an occasional couple
of inches in The Daily. Its silence arises neither from
unusual modesty nor from unusual efficiency, but
from the simple fact that there is nothing about the
system to stir up more than passing comment. In
comparison with the majestic progress of Ex Commit
tee and the frantic scurrying of Women's Conference,
its casual administration is about as exciting as an old
maid school teacher.

But the card file as a part of the evolution of stu
dent government may in the well-known long run be
come more important than all the px-ecedents Ex Com
mittee ever set. It is an experiment in student admin
istration, and its results will be used as a guide to
future tinkering with the present machine.
The system was started last year in an attempt to
establish a flood control project for student govern
ment gravy. The idea was to maintain a file which
would list the names and ratings of all committee
workers. Appointments then could be made on a
basis of record and ability; no longer would an in
efficient worker be hoisted into important commit
tees simply because somebody with a hazy memory
thought he was "a hell of a good guy."
¥T WILL be several years before anyone who doesn't
know a good clairvoyant can risk a prediction about
the success of the card file. Assorted prophets have
already attempted a peeping Tom act through the
curtain of the future. But the question is decorated
with too many conditional clauses, and too many
qualifying conjunctions to make prophecy safe for
anyone who isn't on speaking terms with one of the
more important angels.
If the card system works out, it will provide a
pattern for ail other student governments, and it will
serve as a basis for a new appointment system at. Stan
ford. Its possible advantages shine like a jewelry
show case. If it is successful it may offer Stanford a
good Emily Post introduction to Justice, Impartiality,
and allied virtues.

If it fails, the Farm will go back to executive im
pressionism; Justice and Co. will cut us dead.
And so it appears that beneath the hands of the
card file manager flow the mighty forces of evolution.
Quietly Stanford is experimenting with a new type of
government. And that, my friends is your beautiful
thought for today.
