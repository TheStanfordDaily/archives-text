### DOUG JAQUES 
It All
If I were a pretty little thing, I don't suppose I
would mind so much. But I'm not a pretty little
thing.
I swear practically all the letters I got last quarter
were letters sent through our house president from the
Quad to the effect that I hadn't had my picture taken.
Imagine that!
The president would come in once a week with a
handful of these letters, and waving them intimidat
ingly in my face he would threaten me hideously with
a namely future if I didn't have my picture taken.
"So help me, Jaques, get your damn picture taken,"
is a nice, clean summary of what, he used to say to me.
And now he's starting it again. "So help me,
Jaques, get. your damn picture taken tomorrow," is a
nice, clean summary of what he said to me after lunch
today.
Why not just use my last year's picture? Have I
changed so much in one year? And would anyone
ever notice it in those diminutive Quad pictures? Even
if he looked?
Those Quad pictures wouldn't even show the dif
ference a Rood night's sleep makes.
And let's not get a high hat or a fat head about a
picture. No one looks at it, anyway. I certainly
don't. I even select my proofs upside down. It's
simply a device those capitalistic Quad money-chang
ers use to keep us peasants in our monetary pigeon
holes.
Comes the revolution, they had better watch out,
too. And our house president.
But. until then—
Dear President: Please remind me to put on a
suit tomorrow (today) so I can get. my picture taken.
Thank you very much, Dear President.

Taking up a medium-sized parking space in front

wood with a note conspicuously stuck on the end of
it. The note said:

Just borrowed it! Tain't stolen. Leave it at the

Swearing that there was no funny business what
soever in the thing and that it is the gospel, a friend
of mine claims that he took his gal to the show Sun
day night, parked in back of the theater, got. out to
lock his car—and couldn't find the keys.
He loked all over. No keys. He went into the
show, and when he came out. he had to call up one
of his brothers to come and bring him a duplicate
set of keys. The next day he found the keys down
under the seat.
Now if you can tell me how a guy can take his keys
out of the ignition, get out <>f the esir. get his gal out,
and in the meantime lose the keys down underneath
the seat, I wish you would.
Or perhaps you had better tell him.

ingly in my face he would threaten me hideously with
a namely future if I didn't have my picture taken.
"So help me, Jaques, get your damn picture taken,"
is a nice, clean summary of what, he used to say to me.
And now he's starting it again. "So help me,
Jaques, get. your damn picture taken tomorrow," is a
nice, clean summary of what he said to me after lunch
today.
Why not just use my last year's picture? Have I
changed so much in one year? And would anyone
ever notice it in those diminutive Quad pictures? Even
if he looked?
Those Quad pictures wouldn't even show the dif
ference a Rood night's sleep makes.
And let's not get a high hat or a fat head about a
picture. No one looks at it, anyway. I certainly
don't. I even select my proofs upside down. It's
simply a device those capitalistic Quad money-chang
ers use to keep us peasants in our monetary pigeon
holes.
Comes the revolution, they had better watch out,
too. And our house president.
But. until then—
Dear President: Please remind me to put on a
suit tomorrow (today) so I can get. my picture taken.
Thank you very much, Dear President.

Swearing that there was no funny business what
soever in the thing and that it is the gospel, a friend
of mine claims that he took his gal to the show Sun
day night, parked in back of the theater, got. out to
lock his car—and couldn't find the keys.
He loked all over. No keys. He went into the
show, and when he came out. he had to call up one
of his brothers to come and bring him a duplicate
set of keys. The next day he found the keys down
under the seat.
Now if you can tell me how a guy can take his keys
out of the ignition, get out <>f the esir. get his gal out,
and in the meantime lose the keys down underneath
the seat, I wish you would.
Or perhaps you had better tell him.
It All
If I were a pretty little thing, I don't suppose I
would mind so much. But I'm not a pretty little
thing.
I swear practically all the letters I got last quarter
were letters sent through our house president from the
Quad to the effect that I hadn't had my picture taken.
Imagine that!
The president would come in once a week with a
handful of these letters, and waving them intimidat
ingly in my face he would threaten me hideously with
a namely future if I didn't have my picture taken.
