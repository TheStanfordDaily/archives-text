Even the beautiful technicolor, the
lilting music and the grand voices of
Jeanette Mac Donald and Nelson Ed

an audience.
Miss Mac Do

are beautiful and
her acting is good.
Nelson Eddy's

voice is beautiful but his acting is
inclined to be on the "hammy" side.
Florence Rice and Frank Morgan
take supporting honors as secre
tary and producer. The usually
competent Mischa Auer never hits
his stridfc.
MGM certainly missed fire on this
picture, thinking that the team of
Jeanette McDonald and Nelson
Eddy could make up for anything,
even a weak and dragging story.
They can't. —Sprager
