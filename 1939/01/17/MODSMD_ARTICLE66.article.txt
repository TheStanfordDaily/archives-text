# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Being a member of the dangerous
species, I was pleasantly amazed by
the absolute chivalry of a certain
young man on the Quad. I was in
distress. My pen was empty. My
brain had started to rotate and I was
in the midst of delivering a brain
child.* My pen needed nourishment.
1 looked around for someone, any
one who could possibly have a pen.
There was no one in sight.
Finally a lone individual straggled
by. I called and asked him for aid.
He didn't have a pen or pencil. It
appears he carries notes in his head.
But, he told me where I could find
some ink. I expected that, but I
didn't expect this—he took my pen,
called me lazy, and went all the way
to a filling station and treated my
pen to breakfast, and brought it
back.
Imagine, he treated me as though
I were helpless! It really was won
derfully thrilling. (And I know he
was pleased with himself.)

The Editor, Sir:
The editor, himself a Ilall man,
ought to have had more foresight
than to have allowed the publication
of such libellous articles as de
scribed the Clubs and Halls in the
fraternity-extra. The extreme asi
ninity of the entire issue makes it
unnecessary to comment: the head
lines contained sophomorish insinu
ations, and the comparison between
the Row and the English universi
ties was a ridiculous reflection of
egotistic complacency. A growing
feeling of distaste pervades me
whenever I pick up a copy of your
paper, with an accompanying re
gret for being forced by the Univer
sity to contribute toward its sup
port.
The real reason why I transferred
to Stanford was the anticipation of
reaching a place where fraternities
would not be annoying; and conse
quently I shall be firm in my in
sistence upon the maintenance of
the Hall-Club reputation for dig
nity, intelligence, and fair treatment
of one's fellows. It is not out of
place to ask that another special is
sue be devoted to the other half of
the picture.

The Editor, Sir:
Being a member of the dangerous
species, I was pleasantly amazed by
the absolute chivalry of a certain
young man on the Quad. I was in
distress. My pen was empty. My
brain had started to rotate and I was
in the midst of delivering a brain
child.* My pen needed nourishment.
1 looked around for someone, any
one who could possibly have a pen.
There was no one in sight.
Finally a lone individual straggled
by. I called and asked him for aid.
He didn't have a pen or pencil. It
appears he carries notes in his head.
But, he told me where I could find
some ink. I expected that, but I
didn't expect this—he took my pen,
called me lazy, and went all the way
to a filling station and treated my
pen to breakfast, and brought it
back.
Imagine, he treated me as though
I were helpless! It really was won
derfully thrilling. (And I know he
was pleased with himself.)
Just Me

The Editor, Sir:
The editor, himself a Ilall man,
ought to have had more foresight
than to have allowed the publication
of such libellous articles as de
scribed the Clubs and Halls in the
fraternity-extra. The extreme asi
ninity of the entire issue makes it
unnecessary to comment: the head
lines contained sophomorish insinu
ations, and the comparison between
the Row and the English universi
ties was a ridiculous reflection of
egotistic complacency. A growing
feeling of distaste pervades me
whenever I pick up a copy of your
paper, with an accompanying re
gret for being forced by the Univer
sity to contribute toward its sup
port.
