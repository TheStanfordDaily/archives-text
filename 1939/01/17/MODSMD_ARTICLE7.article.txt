FOLLOW CROPS

Poor shelter and inadequate cloth- |
ing have resulted in much suffering |
for those unfortunates who follow!
California crops during the winter i
months.
Consequently, the Simon J. Lubin i

Society, which considers labor prob
lems in the state, the Western Sum
mer School for Workers, and the
Steinbeck Committee for Migratory
Relief organized the drive of which
the Stanford organization forms a
part.
Goal of the campus committee is
to get a contribution from every un
dergraduate on the campus.
"Monday is the deadline for mak
ing donations," said Otis Brubaker,
"and since the cause is one of im
mediate concern to the state, we fend
sure Stanford will come through
whole-heartedly."
