"I>LEASE make all checks pay- '
abie to Stanford University"— I
yes, this is a world that runs on {
dolalrs and cents, where something
for nothing rates headlines.
Japan has learned a lot since
Commodore Perry sailed into the
harbor of Tokyo in 1853, and not
the least effective of these lessons
has been one in the business meth
ods of the West. Today Japan has
something to sell, and she's ottering
it to the world at a very fancy
price.
Exactly what the Nipponese |
have set on the counter is this: 1
trading rights in China will he
granted to the United States and
the major European powers if
they pay for thvm by removing
restrictions on Japanese immigra
tion and Japanese goods.
Both England and the United
States strongly desire the Open
Door in China, but it will take more
than a couple of Charlie Chans and
assorted Mr. Motos to turn the trick
where immigration laws and tariff
walls are concerned. I believe the
proper response to the Japanese
proposal is to bow toward the east
and solemnly suggest they go climb
a tree.
YESTERDAY the Spanish Loyal
ists made their goal-line stand.
It was fourth down and Franco's
boys had only 28 miles to go, but a
strong Republican line broke up
their scoring play and they lost the
ball. The game isn't over yet, but
the Rebel touchdown threat is defi
nitely a thing of the past.
When the Insurgent drive on Bar
celona seemed almost certain ol
success, when Franco was practical
ly on the point of pounding at the
gates of the Republican capital, the
Loyalists came through and halted
the boseigers 28 miles from their ob
jective.
Young girls and middle-aged
women building barricades, unskill
ed workers frantically working on
steel and concrete trenches, squad
rons advancing to certain suicide in
order to impede the invaders' prog
ress, all these have had their effect.

Tp'RENCH cabinet ministers have a
reputation for being wishy
washy; yesterday they lived up to
their name and announced that
France will take no action on the
Spanish Civil War. Despite the
menace of a third Fascist neighbor,
the Daladier government announced
it will give no aid to the Loyalist
cause.
Members of the opposition in
general, and ex-Priemier Leon
Blum in particular, did everything
except throw pop-bottles at the
weak-kneed ministers in their de
nunciation of a policy which will
allow the Fascist bandwagon to
roll merrily over the prostrate
form of Laßcllc France.

jyi EANWHILE the Italian press
continues to crow over what it
terms Italian victories in Spain and
to call the French a lot of nasty
names. Line after line of Mussolini
approved type tells the Italians that
they are all set to go to war to de
fend their national honor, to satisfy
their natural territorial demands,
and because they're just, too damn
good to be licked.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT isn't in
black-face, down on one knee,
his arms outstretched, sobbing,
"Sonny Boy" to Congress, but he's
pulling every other tear-jerker out
of the bag in his effort to save his
new relief bill from being hacked
to pieces.
Yesterday he announced that
unless the House's $150,000,000 cut
is restored (o the appropriation, a
million workers will he thrown
off relief this summer.

Japan has learned a lot since
Commodore Perry sailed into the
harbor of Tokyo in 1853, and not
the least effective of these lessons

trading rights in China will he
granted to the United States and

Both England and the United
States strongly desire the Open
Door in China, but it will take more
than a couple of Charlie Chans and
assorted Mr. Motos to turn the trick
where immigration laws and tariff
walls are concerned. I believe the
proper response to the Japanese

YESTERDAY the Spanish Loyal

It was fourth down and Franco's
boys had only 28 miles to go, but a
strong Republican line broke up
their scoring play and they lost the
ball. The game isn't over yet, but
the Rebel touchdown threat is defi

When the Insurgent drive on Bar
celona seemed almost certain ol
success, when Franco was practical
ly on the point of pounding at the
gates of the Republican capital, the
Loyalists came through and halted
the boseigers 28 miles from their ob

Young girls and middle-aged
women building barricades, unskill

steel and concrete trenches, squad
rons advancing to certain suicide in
order to impede the invaders' prog

Tp'RENCH cabinet ministers have a
reputation for being wishy
washy; yesterday they lived up to
their name and announced that
France will take no action on the
Spanish Civil War. Despite the
menace of a third Fascist neighbor,
the Daladier government announced
it will give no aid to the Loyalist
cause.
Members of the opposition in
general, and ex-Priemier Leon
Blum in particular, did everything
except throw pop-bottles at the
weak-kneed ministers in their de
nunciation of a policy which will
allow the Fascist bandwagon to
roll merrily over the prostrate
form of Laßcllc France.
