# Engineers Plan Dinner Tonight
## Malone Will Speak On Industrial Phase 
### 
Stanford Engineers will hold their
second annual banquet in the din
ing room of the Stanford Union this
evening at 6:30 o'clock with George
W. Malone scheduled to address the
gathering on the "Industrial Expan
sion in the Western States."
Tau Beta Pi, national honorary
engineering society, sponsored the
first of these dinners last year with
the purpose of having a well known
engineer present some phase of his
work which might be of interest to
the undergraduates on the campus.
So successful was the affair that
plans for this evening's program
were enthusiastically received by
members of the engineering depart
ment.
Mr. Malone, who is at present gen
eral manager of The Industrial
West, Inc., has had a distinguished
career in the West during the last
few years.
One time engineer for the state of
Nevada, he did much to co-ordinate
various branches involved in plan
ning the Boulder Dam project, and
since he has been with the Indus
trial West, Inc., Mr. Malone has
undertaken several investigations in
an attempt to discover potential
commercial possibilities in the coast
regions.
All members of the engineering
faculty as well as students are in
vited to the dinner, and tickets may
be obtained in the A.S.S.U. for 75
cents.
