# Money-Savers Given Men's Health Service
## 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Day by day it costs less and less to get sick at Stanford.
Latest money-savers are two new pieces of equipment that have been ,
given to the Men's Health Service—a fluoroscope and an audiometer.
Most spectacular of the two is the new fluoroscope, which will enable
the physicians to get an X-ray view of diseased portions of the Stanford j

nan without going to the trouble
and expense of taking X-ray pic
lures. Students will save from $1000
io $1500 a year in this way, esti
mates Dr. Charles E. Shepard, di
rector of the Men's Health Service.
MORE SAVINGS
This figure doesn't tell the total
amount that will be saved, however,
Dr. Shepard points out. Now that
internal disorders can be detected
merely by pressing a button, many
diseases such as tuberculosis and
bronchial pneumonia are being dis
covered while still in their incip
ient stages.
During the routine physical exam
ination to which all entering stu
dents are subjected, physicians will
use the fluoroscope if they see signs
of any possible lung disorder. Before
this quarter such a thorough exam
ination has been impractical unless
a disorder of this sort was clearly
evident.
HOW IT STARTED
There's something of a story be
hind this gift to the Health Service
and indirectly lo all 2800 of the
Stanford men. The instrument was a
Christmas present, and it was in
stalled two days before Christmas.
Dr. Shepard was over at the
Men's Rest Home one afternoon last
December, chatting with its direc
tor, Mrs. C. G. Allen. They were
worried about a boy whom they had
just sent to the hospital with tu
berculosis.
"We could have detected it weeks
ago if a fluoroscope had been
available," remarked Dr. Shepard.
That was all Mrs. Allen needed
to set her in action. "How much
would it cost?" she asked. Six hun
dred dollars. "I think we can ar
range it," she told him.
COINS START ROLLING
That day she started her fund.
Many students and professors put
in contributions when they heard
what was needed. A couple of
checks from grateful parents were
added.
Mrs. Allen's fund had grown con
siderably after two or three days,
but it wasn't until she went to call
on Mrs. Louis Stern in Palo Alto
that she really hit the jack-pot.
Mrs. Stern, donor of the Palo Alto
Community Center, is known for
her many friendly acts of assistance
lo Stanford students. And when
Mrs. Allen suggested she probably
would want to have a small part in
the project, Mrs. Stern liked the idea
so well that she made the chief
contribution — enough so that Mrs.
Allen had to look no farther for
funds.
OTHER GIFT
The second gift—an audiometer—
is a radio-like instrument used to
test hearing scientifically. It was
presented to the Men's Health Serv
ice by two doctors at the Stanford
Lane Hospital in San Francisco, Dr.
John A. Bacher, associate clinical
professor of surgery, and Dr. Ed
ward C. Sewall, clinical professor of
surgery.
Designed to replace the inaccurate
ticking-of-the-watch test formerly
given all entering students, the au
diometer will aid in detection of
slight cases of deafness often over
looked until now.

available," remarked Dr. Shepard.
That was all Mrs. Allen needed
to set her in action. "How much
would it cost?" she asked. Six hun
dred dollars. "I think we can ar
range it," she told him.
COINS START ROLLING
That day she started her fund.
Many students and professors put
in contributions when they heard
what was needed. A couple of
checks from grateful parents were
added.
Mrs. Allen's fund had grown con
siderably after two or three days,
but it wasn't until she went to call
on Mrs. Louis Stern in Palo Alto
that she really hit the jack-pot.
Mrs. Stern, donor of the Palo Alto
Community Center, is known for
her many friendly acts of assistance
lo Stanford students. And when
Mrs. Allen suggested she probably
would want to have a small part in
the project, Mrs. Stern liked the idea
so well that she made the chief
contribution — enough so that Mrs.
Allen had to look no farther for
funds.
OTHER GIFT
The second gift—an audiometer—
is a radio-like instrument used to
test hearing scientifically. It was
presented to the Men's Health Serv
ice by two doctors at the Stanford
Lane Hospital in San Francisco, Dr.
John A. Bacher, associate clinical
professor of surgery, and Dr. Ed
ward C. Sewall, clinical professor of
surgery.
Designed to replace the inaccurate
ticking-of-the-watch test formerly
given all entering students, the au
diometer will aid in detection of
slight cases of deafness often over
looked until now.
Day by day it costs less and less to get sick at Stanford.
Latest money-savers are two new pieces of equipment that have been ,
given to the Men's Health Service—a fluoroscope and an audiometer.
Most spectacular of the two is the new fluoroscope, which will enable
the physicians to get an X-ray view of diseased portions of the Stanford j

nan without going to the trouble
and expense of taking X-ray pic
lures. Students will save from $1000
io $1500 a year in this way, esti
mates Dr. Charles E. Shepard, di
rector of the Men's Health Service.
MORE SAVINGS
This figure doesn't tell the total
amount that will be saved, however,
Dr. Shepard points out. Now that
internal disorders can be detected
merely by pressing a button, many
diseases such as tuberculosis and
bronchial pneumonia are being dis
covered while still in their incip
ient stages.
During the routine physical exam
ination to which all entering stu
dents are subjected, physicians will
use the fluoroscope if they see signs
of any possible lung disorder. Before
this quarter such a thorough exam
ination has been impractical unless
a disorder of this sort was clearly
evident.
HOW IT STARTED
There's something of a story be
hind this gift to the Health Service
and indirectly lo all 2800 of the
Stanford men. The instrument was a
Christmas present, and it was in
stalled two days before Christmas.
Dr. Shepard was over at the
Men's Rest Home one afternoon last
December, chatting with its direc
tor, Mrs. C. G. Allen. They were
worried about a boy whom they had
just sent to the hospital with tu
berculosis.
"We could have detected it weeks
ago if a fluoroscope had been
available," remarked Dr. Shepard.
That was all Mrs. Allen needed
to set her in action. "How much
would it cost?" she asked. Six hun
dred dollars. "I think we can ar
