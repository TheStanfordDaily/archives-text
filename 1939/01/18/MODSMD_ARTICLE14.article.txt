# U.S. Finances To Be Topic For Debate
## 
### 
Dick Carew and John Moskovics,
j Stanford debaters, will meet repre
! sentatives from the Banking Institute
of America this evening at, 7:30
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse
to uphold the negative side of the
Pi Kappa Delta question, "Resolved,
i that the United States should cease
J to use public funds for the purpose
' of stimulating business."
The question has been used only
i a few times the last two quarters,
; as it is a subject that calls for an
j almost technical knowledge of pub
' lie funds and their use.
The more general Anglo-Amcri
j can question has been very suc
! cessful among colelgiate groups, but
when the invitation from the
a√ünking Institute of America was
i received, Stanford forensic men
felt that here was the ideal oppo
sition to the P.D.K. question.
Tryouts for the Hawaiian tour
! were begun yesterday afternoon in
; the Memorial Auditorium and will
I continue this afternoon. From the
tryoutees it will be up to the judges
to select two men for the trip to the
! islands later this quarter.
