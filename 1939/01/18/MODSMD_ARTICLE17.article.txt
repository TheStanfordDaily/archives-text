mented as follows upon tabulations
of the Daily-Interfraternity Council
questionnaire of recently pledged
Encinamen:
"It is particularly gratifying to note
that in so far as the rushee-rusher
relationship goes, the freshmen ap
prove of a liberal interpretation of
rushing rules. It is because of the
same desire for a generally normal
relationship between them that the
Board of Control has made efforts to
allow contact of an informal nature
on the campus.
"However, I am convinced that
'liberal interpretation' should not
mean approval of such flagrant vio
lations as off-campus rushing or
breach of silent period.
"Informal pledging has of course
never been deemed illegal and has
generally been accepted as a supple
mentary part of Stanford's rushing
system.
"The small majority for a shorter
period is a general indication of the
trend shown throughout the coun
try by fraternity leaders that shorter
elapsed rushing time is less disrupt -
I ing to normal campus life."
