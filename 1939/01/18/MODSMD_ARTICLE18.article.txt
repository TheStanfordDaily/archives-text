# 'Frankfurter Great Liberal
## Kirkwood Lauds New High Court Jurist 
### ALLEN DRURY 
A great liberal, working for pro
gressive change through the medium
of constitutional methods — that is
Ihe view of Felix Frankfurter held
by Dean Marion R. Kirkwood of the
Stanford School of Law, who com
mented yesterday upon the Senate's
confirmation of the Supreme Court's
newest Justice.
Tracing Frankfurter's legal back
ground, Dean Kirkwood noted the
fact that the immigrant boy who
left Vienna at 12 and graduated
from the Harvard Law School at 24
has had not only academic, but
practical experience as well.
''Following his graduation from
Harvard," he said, "he spent sev
eral years in private practice. After
1 his he was elevated to the position
of Assistant United States Attorney
for the Southern Division of New
York. This actual practice in the
workings of the law, plus his aca
demic background of almost 25
years on the faculty of the Harvard
Law School, make him a very well-

EFFECT ON NEW DEAL

equipped jurist."
The course of his decisions, Dean
Kirkwood feels, will be along the
same line as those of the three great
Justices of the post-war period —
Holmes, BrandeLs, and the Cardozo
whose place he fills.
"A great personal admirer of these
three, his opinions will help main
tain the constructive liberal tradi
tion which is coming to be associat
ed with the present Court."
Commenting upon the effect the
appointment might have upon the
future course of New Deal legisla
tion, and upon the group of "Frank
furter men" around the President,
Dean Kirkwood refuted ihe idea that
the new Justice will act as a sort
of "back-door adviser" to the Chief
Executive.
"I can't imagine him in such a
role," he said. "He has too much
regard for the position of the Court,
too much respect for the traditions
of the country. Although he will be
a ioyal supporter of the President—
within the limits of the Constitu
tion, that is—it. is quite probable
that there will be much less per-

WESTERN REPRESENTATION

sonal contact than ihcrc has been."
Turning for a moment to the pos
sibility of further appointments be
fore Mr. Roosevelt leaves ofTicc in
1940. Dean Kirk wood gave it as his
opinion that the western states
should be Riven some representa
tion on the Court.
"Since the retirement of George
Sutherland a year ago," he said,
"Ihe West has had no one on the j
bench. I don't believe too much
in the necessity for equal represen
tation of all parts of the country, but
I do feel that at least one member!
should be there to provide first
hand knowledge of western prob- j
Icms. There are times when they!
are distinct from those of the East,
and they should have a sympathetic j
advocate in Washington."
KIRKWOOD ADDITION
Returning to Mr. Frankfurter, 1
Dean Kirkwood reaffirmed his be
lief that he will uphold both the
integrity of the Court and the wel- j
fare of the nation,
"A man who has a great knowl- |
edge of the Constitution, a fine re- !
gard for the traditions of law, a dis- j
like for hasty legislation, and the j
backbone to stand up for what he '
believes, whether the pressure to j
give in comes from his fellow-mem- J
hers or the President himself, he is !
a man cut to the pattern of the great |
liberal Justices who have preceded '
him. His capabilities and his intel- j
iectual honesty make him an excel
lent addition to the nation's Supreme '
Bench."
