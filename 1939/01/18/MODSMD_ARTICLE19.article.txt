## Daily Survey Shows Shows New Row Men In Favor of Pre-formal Pledging 
### HARRY SHELDON 
By HARRY SHELDON

Approving: liberal interpretation of rushing rules, Stanford's 257 new
Row men yesterday sanctioned pre-formal pledge pin hanging, according to
a questionnaire survey conducted Monday night.
In support of their view, the Encinamen revealed that 118 had pledged
houses before formal pledging during the recently completed rushing pe-

riod and that only 23 had not pledg
ed previous to January 13. The
questionnaire also revealed that 3f>
had accepted pins of two houses,
while 13 of the group accepted three
pins.
In answer to' the question, "Are
you for strict enforcement of rush
ing rules or for a liberal one?" the
pledges preferred the latter course
by a vote of 168 to (59.
In choosing houses, the men de
clared they were more interested in
fellow members of pledge classes by
a vote of 198 than in "personality of
upper classmen," which they voted
second with 140 votes. Third on
their list of most influential factors
in choosing a house was campus
reputation.
TOPPED OTHER REASONS
The above ihree qualities topped
by a wide margin such other factors
as athletic achievement of members,
general campus activity, and phys
ical aspects and campus location of
houses.
In being rushed, the frosh felt,
houses were looking for "good per
sonality," "personal appearance,"
and "participation in activities," in
prospective members as the top three
factors.
By a vote of 87 to 09, the pledges
favored a shorter rushing period
before formal pledging.
"Shorter, sweeter, snappier, save
the pledges," one suggested.
SHORT PERIOD SUGGESTED
Also in line with this opinion
were suggestions that "formal pledg
ing be held before Christmas," and
that "the period be shortened to
about six weeks."
As 1 to contact between freshmen
and fraternity men, several cxiti
cized existing Row methods.
"Let there be more contact be
tween freshmen and fraternity men
so that they may know each other
better," one questionnaire declared.
! Another suggested that frosh
I "go to all houses for the first couple
of periods" to insure wider contact.
ONLY FORMAL PLEDGING
Those who were in favor of strict
enforcement of rushing rules gen
erally complied with the statement
of one freshman who said, "Allow
no pledging before formal pledging.
It Ls too easy for the freshman to
say, 'Yes,' before he has taken time
to consider. Later he may get a
chance to pledge a house he likes
better."
Many agreed with the statement,
"Don't be so secretive about phon
ing students before formal pledging
and don't act like you're breaking a
strict rule by offering a pin before
that time."
Conducted by The Daily in con-
I junction with Interfratcrnity Coun
| cil, results of the poll will be turned
| over to the latter office, where tab
ulations and suggestions will be
considered by Council President
Bud McDuflic and house represen
tatives.

ical aspects and campus location of

In being rushed, the frosh felt,
houses were looking for "good per
sonality," "personal appearance,"
and "participation in activities," in
prospective members as the top three
factors.
By a vote of 87 to 09, the pledges
favored a shorter rushing period
before formal pledging.
"Shorter, sweeter, snappier, save
the pledges," one suggested.
SHORT PERIOD SUGGESTED
Also in line with this opinion
were suggestions that "formal pledg
ing be held before Christmas," and
that "the period be shortened to
about six weeks."
As 1 to contact between freshmen
and fraternity men, several cxiti
cized existing Row methods.
"Let there be more contact be
tween freshmen and fraternity men
so that they may know each other
better," one questionnaire declared.
! Another suggested that frosh
I "go to all houses for the first couple
of periods" to insure wider contact.
ONLY FORMAL PLEDGING
Those who were in favor of strict
enforcement of rushing rules gen
erally complied with the statement
of one freshman who said, "Allow
no pledging before formal pledging.
It Ls too easy for the freshman to
say, 'Yes,' before he has taken time
to consider. Later he may get a
chance to pledge a house he likes
better."
Many agreed with the statement,
"Don't be so secretive about phon
ing students before formal pledging
and don't act like you're breaking a
strict rule by offering a pin before
that time."

Approving: liberal interpretation of rushing rules, Stanford's 257 new
Row men yesterday sanctioned pre-formal pledge pin hanging, according to
a questionnaire survey conducted Monday night.
In support of their view, the Encinamen revealed that 118 had pledged
houses before formal pledging during the recently completed rushing pe-

riod and that only 23 had not pledg
ed previous to January 13. The
questionnaire also revealed that 3f>
had accepted pins of two houses,
while 13 of the group accepted three
pins.
In answer to' the question, "Are
you for strict enforcement of rush
ing rules or for a liberal one?" the
pledges preferred the latter course
by a vote of 168 to (59.
In choosing houses, the men de
clared they were more interested in
fellow members of pledge classes by
a vote of 198 than in "personality of
upper classmen," which they voted
second with 140 votes. Third on
their list of most influential factors
in choosing a house was campus
reputation.
TOPPED OTHER REASONS
The above ihree qualities topped
by a wide margin such other factors
as athletic achievement of members,
general campus activity, and phys
ical aspects and campus location of
houses.
