# Gutenberg Page Kept In Rare Book Room
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
It's a weird sensation to hold a
book in your hands that was writ
ten before Columbus discovered
America; it's downright ghostly to
see the comments in the margin cas
ually jotted down in Latin by some
former owner dead these five hun
dred years. No one seems to know
just when Stanford acquired this
book and a few of the other unique
volumes now contained in the rare
book room of the library.
Before this room was established,
all the valuable books were kept in
the Stanford Room adjoining the
reference room and in the Director's
office. There they were inaccessible,
and uncatalogued, so in 1931 an
empty room on the fourth floor of
the library was remodeled so that
it might house the collection. Today
this collection, unusual in the West,
contains about 3200 volumes.
The collection specializes in incu
nabula or books printed before 1500.
Since the first Gutenberg Bible was
printed sometime between 1450 and
1455, these are rare and expensive.
There are five covers in the collec
tion. including a page from the 42-
line Gutenberg Bible itself.
One of the most unusual of these
early printed works is the "Nurem-

[ burg Chronicle" by Schedel, an il
| lustrated history of the world. Evi
-1 dently the early printer needed more
i pictures than he had, so he eompro-
I mised and printed the same picture
I four or five times, carefully tagging
1 it with a different name in each case.
| Also in the library is a fine group
j of facsimile editions which are re
: j productions of unique or costly
j works. The Greenland collection,
j assembled by a Danish doctor, T. N.
I Krabbe, is one of the largest of its
! kind, and has proved of special in
i terest to explorers, especially Lin
• ! coin Steffens. who spent several
; I hours looking it over last year when
, 1 he was here.
i ' More modern is the typographical
collection, the gift of Albert M. Ben
• der. Two hundred forty-two private
| presses are repi-esented. Most of
, ! these are from limited editions of
i 500 copies and they come from Eng
land, the Continent, and Asia, as well
, ! as the United States.
; i Fascinating as the rare book room
I I is, students there are nearly as rare
. ;as the room's contents, but Miss
! Jeannette Hitchcock, who is in
charge, doesn't seem to mind. She
leafed through the pages of an enor
■ | inous board-bound book, called "The
Offices of the Dead of the Roman
Catholic Church," pointing out that
it was so large because books were
j expensive and so there was only one
; for the choir boys to read from. She
; stopped at one of the lovely illumi
| nations. There beaming out from one
' i corner was a jovial looking death's
head with a crown tilted rakishly
over one eye. "They had a marvelous
sense of humor," she remarked.

empty room on the fourth floor of
the library was remodeled so that
it might house the collection. Today
this collection, unusual in the West,
contains about 3200 volumes.
The collection specializes in incu
nabula or books printed before 1500.
Since the first Gutenberg Bible was
printed sometime between 1450 and
1455, these are rare and expensive.
There are five covers in the collec
tion. including a page from the 42-
line Gutenberg Bible itself.
One of the most unusual of these
early printed works is the "Nurem-

[ burg Chronicle" by Schedel, an il
| lustrated history of the world. Evi
-1 dently the early printer needed more
i pictures than he had, so he eompro-
I mised and printed the same picture
I four or five times, carefully tagging
1 it with a different name in each case.
| Also in the library is a fine group
j of facsimile editions which are re
: j productions of unique or costly
j works. The Greenland collection,
j assembled by a Danish doctor, T. N.
I Krabbe, is one of the largest of its
! kind, and has proved of special in
i terest to explorers, especially Lin
• ! coin Steffens. who spent several
; I hours looking it over last year when
, 1 he was here.
i ' More modern is the typographical
collection, the gift of Albert M. Ben
• der. Two hundred forty-two private
| presses are repi-esented. Most of
, ! these are from limited editions of
i 500 copies and they come from Eng
land, the Continent, and Asia, as well
, ! as the United States.
; i Fascinating as the rare book room
I I is, students there are nearly as rare
. ;as the room's contents, but Miss
! Jeannette Hitchcock, who is in
charge, doesn't seem to mind. She
leafed through the pages of an enor
■ | inous board-bound book, called "The
Offices of the Dead of the Roman
Catholic Church," pointing out that
it was so large because books were
j expensive and so there was only one
; for the choir boys to read from. She
; stopped at one of the lovely illumi
| nations. There beaming out from one
' i corner was a jovial looking death's
head with a crown tilted rakishly
over one eye. "They had a marvelous
sense of humor," she remarked.
It's a weird sensation to hold a
book in your hands that was writ
ten before Columbus discovered
America; it's downright ghostly to
see the comments in the margin cas
ually jotted down in Latin by some
former owner dead these five hun
dred years. No one seems to know
just when Stanford acquired this
book and a few of the other unique
volumes now contained in the rare
book room of the library.
Before this room was established,
all the valuable books were kept in
the Stanford Room adjoining the
reference room and in the Director's
office. There they were inaccessible,
and uncatalogued, so in 1931 an
empty room on the fourth floor of
the library was remodeled so that
it might house the collection. Today
