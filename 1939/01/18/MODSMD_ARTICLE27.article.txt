# 'War Gaining,' Says Guerard In Lecture
## U.S. Rearming For Imminent Conflict, Professor Predicts 
### 
"War has not been averted by the
Peace of Munich. Instead, it is gain
ing on us," warned Dr. Albert L.
Guerard, professor of general liter
ature, when he spoke on "France in
Europe" last night in Memorial Hall
auditorium at a program of the
Tuesday Evening Series.

"The United States realizes that
war is imminent, and we are rearm
ing in preparation for it," asserted
the speaker, who believes that "Ger
many and France will riot be friends
forever" for having signed an agree
ment "which is not worth the paper
it is written on. Franco-German re
lations have not yet been settled, and
in these relations is to be found the
central problem of Europe today."

That the "profound pacifism" of
the French people has caused them
to permit themselves to be bluffed
and successfully defied by other
major European powers is the opin
ion of Dr. Guerard, who explained
that this reluctance to go to war is
due to "their recent and deep expe
rience with war, an experience that
has penetrated deep into the French
soul.
"Severely beaten at the Munich
Conference, Italy suffered a defeat
which rankles within her. The pres
ent Franco-Italian enmity has been
manufactured pux-ely for a psycho
logical reason," declared the lecturer,
"and has given Mussolini a way in
which to demonstrate his power by
defying France and making humili
ating territorial demands."
Products of the same continental
civilization and having a common
racial origin, with no radical reli
gious or cultural differences, Ger
many and France possess no "heri
tage of hatred" and foster no heredi
tary enmity toward each other, ac
cording to Dr. Guerard. "Far more
rivalry and antipathy have existed
between England and France than
between Germany and Franee," ex
plained the speaker.
