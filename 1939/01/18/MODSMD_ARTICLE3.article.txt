# Excom Holds Aid Request Discussion
## Needy Sino Student Fund Contribution Decision Held Over 
### 
Ex Committee last night balked
at a request for funds to aid needy
Chinese students but held its final
decision in the matter until next
week.
Basis of discussion was a letter
from Mary K. Horton, president of
Y.W.C.A., in which she stated that
the organization has lowered the
quota of this year's fund drive to
$500 —enough to cover expenses—
and has allotted all surplus to the
Far Eastern Student Service Drive.
The "Y" hopes to raise $300 above
their quota—enough money to pro
vide room and board for 10 stu
dents for six months. The campus
drive is scheduled for January 24
to 27, according to Miss Horton.
She asked that the A.S.S.U. make
a contribution.
OTHER COLLEGES GIVING
Sponsored by the National Stu
dent Federation of America, of
which Stanford is a member, the
fund drive has a national quota of
$50,000. Many colleges and univer
sities in the country already have
contributed, according to Tom Kil
lefer.
Committee members, however,
were inclined to be cool toward the
funds plea. Representative state
ments follow:
Gretchen Ahlswede: "With our
present student projects, we should
not contribute. And I may be
wrong, but I think this soil of thing
is all propaganda."
Coline Upshaw: "Wouldn't we be
setting a precedent, so that people
would think the A.S.S.U. was an
easy mark?"
CHARITY AT HOME
Bill Turner: "I'm in favor of sur
vival of the fittest—taking care of
ourselves. That's a heck of an atti
tude, I know, in this country where
we have all the breaks."
A1 Horn: "Breaks? We've got
enough trouble right here at Stan
ford and in the United States. Why
go thousands of miles to help a lot
of Chinese?"
Postponing final action until next
Tuesday, President H. B. Lee ap
pointed Bill Turner to investigate
the purposes of the drive.
USHERS' BOILED SHIRTS: Now
that male Concert Series ushers
wear tuxedos, it costs them just over
71 cents per concert in laundry and
cleaning bills, Usher Bill Heidt told
j the committee.
On motion of Killefcr, it was
ruled that men ushers will be paid
65 cents per concert. Women al
ready are paid—in honor points and
| glory—committeemen were told.
ACTIVITIES FORUM: Sensing
the need for a general self-evalua
tion on the part of all student activ
ity groups, members named Jan
uary 26, 7:15 o'clock, as the time for
a meeting of 40 junior and senior
activity leaders, including Cardinals
members. The meeting is to be
j held in the Nitery.
To plan an agenda for the con
ference, Betty Davis will meet later
in the week with A1 Horn, Jim
Stone, and Gretchen Ahlswede.

teemen okayed Andy Stojkovich's
