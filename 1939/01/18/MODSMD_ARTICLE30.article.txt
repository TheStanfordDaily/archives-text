# Steinbeck Sees Increased Migratory Labor Problem
## 
### 
That the plight of California's I
migratory worker is growing stead- :
ily worse is the conclusion drawn
from a recent report issued by John
Steinbeck. Stanford graduate and
noted author. Mr. Steinbeck is i
chairman of one of the committees
organized to relieve this problem.
Estimates have placed the num
ber of workers making a living by
following seasonal crops up and
down the state at 250,000 to 300,000
people who receive an average
yearly income of $235.
Most of them come from states in
the southwest, where depression, |
crop reduction, mortgage fore- |
closure, and dust storms have
driven them off their own land in ]
search of new fields from which to |
eke out an existence.
WEATHER ATTRACTS
California's mild winters combined j
with extensive campaigns on the I
part of out-of-state Chambers of j
Commerce have added to the influx ;
of these unfortunates, who are even
displacing low wage Mexican and !
Japanese labor.
Willi 100.000 jobs supporting the
population of 300.000. it is only too |
obvious that some state or county I
relief agencies must be ready to j
provide them with occasional food, j
shelter, and clothing, particularly ;
during the winter season, when fruit !
growers' labor requirements are \
few.
Most of these migratory workers
make the rounds of the various
counties in cars that should have j
been on the scrap heap long ago. !
and their food is either picked out
of garbage dumps or is the result
of farmers' charity.
For shelter a very few possess!

worn tents or bits of canvas, while
their clothing is seldom suitable to
keep out the cold of winter months.

Since the great majority of these
laborers are constantly on the move
it is practically impossible for them
to be the recipients of county re
lief, as most of these agencies re
quire a period of residence prior to
the time assistance is rendered.

As a result of thsi deplorable sit
uation several groups have been
organized throughout the state to
gather funds and clothing, and here
on the campus the Stanford Relief
Committee is making a similar drive
to aid in relieving the plight of
(he migratory worker.
