\\'HEN rackets begin swinging in
practice games on the varsity
tennis courts next month, Stanford
netters will be warming up to one
of their hardest seasons, if reports
from Cal and U.S.C. are to be be
lieved.
But the Cards will be strong in
their own right, at least stronger
than in recent years. They will be

underdogs against
everyone but the
U. C. L. A. Bruin,
but they have po
tential power that
may see them
through to an oc
casional victory
against the fa
vored Bears and
Trojans.

BOH LOW. na
tional interxcholastic champ in 1937,
leads the varsity held. He reached
the semi-finals of the national jun
iors last year, but senior tourneys,
in which he piays Don Budge and
his calibre, give him more trouble—
but none have defeated him easily
and decisively. Low's powerful
backhand is his long suit, and he |
uses clever strategy in covering the
court and stroking from the net.
Forehand honors on the Indian j
varsity go to DAVE BROCK, who
puts a top-spin on the ball that '
makes it hard to return. He is quick
on his feet and does well with
serves and volley shots. Brock won
the Montana .state singles crown
last summer.
Ineligibility takes LLOYD GATES
from the roster temporarily, but the
chances are he'll be ready to go
again after this quarter. Gates' fine
back-court game and sound ground
strokes have taken him up the var
sity ladder faster than any other
member of the team.
Bl I) BIORKMAN has moved into
a varsity role by way of a severe 1
service and heady ground play.
CAPTAIN JIM SEAVER is a
plugger and a hard lighter with
good steady talent. While he and
Bob Underwood lost out in the na
tional intercollegiate double com
petition this summer, few observers i
remembered that they had defeated :
all their victors, national champs
included, earlier in the summer i
when the Stanford boys took the j
New Jersey state crown.
Further competitive experience
will take MYRON FOLSOM a long
way. His hard-hitting and forcing j
game make a fine foundation. Fol
som teamed with Brock last sum- ;
mer to win the Montana state dou
bles championship,
JACK LAXLY is light on his feet
and moves about the court with
amazing speed. His net play is ham
pered by his lack of size and reach, j
but he makes up for it in fine court
play. And he has experience that i
will contribute much to the Stan- 1
ford varsity.
SHERWOOD ARMSTRONG is I
particularly valuable in doubles i
competition, and experience is in his |
favor. He is skillful at the net, and
plays a sound court game.
With six singles matches and three j
doubles to be played in each tourna- i
ment. Coach Sherman Lockwood '
will have considerable use for the
less experienced men on his squad, j
STAN OWEN, MEL BALLARD,!
El) CLARKE, and RAY STAIIL re- I
main likely candidates for team '
positions.
