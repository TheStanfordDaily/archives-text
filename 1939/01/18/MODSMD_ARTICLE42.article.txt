# Frosh Quintet Changes Flays
## Clubs Slated to Fare Lowell Outfit Friday 
### 
While the alleged proselyting
racket of Lowell High School has
rocked the Bay City athletic circles,
causing the breaking off of basket
ball relationships, Stanford's frosh
cagers in the meantime have devised
a new offensive to spring on the
colorful prep outfit Friday night.
If the system works and clicks
successfully against Lowell, Sac
ramento Junior Colelge's top-notch
quintet will run up against it Sat
urday night. The two games mark
the beginning of 13 tough tilts which
remain on the yearlings' schedule.
Because the first-year team uses
about the same type of play that
the Indian varsity employs, Coach
H. B. Lee drilled his proteges on the
new offensive attack yesterday be
cause he is certain that the team
has been well-scouted by the Low
ell coach in recent games.
Fundamentals of the new style of
attack were picked up rather
quickly by the hoopsters, who will
practice the plays again this after
noon in a rigid scrimmage session,
while tomorrow will be left to
brushing up on the old and new
plays.
Lew Reese was still on the side
lines yesterday with his injured
ankle, which kept him out of action
against Galileo and Piedmont last
week. His return would give the
Papooses a slight advantage in the
Lowell tilt because of his height and
ability to sink shots from fast
breaking plays. Reese was ably
subbed for by Dick Ray over the
week-end and the little forward

may be called upon to see equal
duty even if Reese does see action.
