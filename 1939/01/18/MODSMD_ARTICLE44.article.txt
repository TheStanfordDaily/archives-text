## 
### 
Bill Greer, sophomore boxer, pro
vided a major upset in the .semi
finals of the all-University tourna
ment yesterday, when he eliminat
ed Hal Saunders, pre-match favo
rite, in the 175-lb. class.
The Sacramenot boy was obvious
ly in there to win, while Saunders
couldn's seem to get going until the
last frame of the three-round meet
ing. Greer will now meet Yank
Levin, frosh gridder, in the finals of.
the tourney.
The big show will be staged in the
Pavilion this Thursday night at 8
o'clock. Admission will be free to
holders of student body cards, and
55 cents to the general public.
Under the guidance of Coach
Clayton Frye and Manager Coit
Kirby, the affair will have a num
ber of highlights outside the ring
itself. The Stanford band will give
out between matches, and the troup
of gymnasts who got such a big
hand at the boxing show last fall
will be seen again on the parallel
bars.
Among the judges for the meet
will be Harry B. Smith, San Fran
cisco sports writer, coming down
from the iCty to get a preview on
some of the lads who will be the

best intercollegiate boxing material
on the Coast this year. Jake Irwin
will referee the bout.s, scheduled to
go three rounds in all divisions.
Tom Mac Michael, hard-hitting
sophomore, earned a place on the

final card 'with a close decision over
Ed Stein in yesterday's semi-finals.
Mac Michael also won the IGS-Ib.
title in the novice tourney in the
fall.
Two bouts on the Thursday night
program can be counted on to have
close decisions. At 135 lbs., John

Wilson and Bob Hovey are a good
match, and in the 145 lb. class
Chuck Mclntyre has shown a left
hook that will keep Jack Rice busy.
In his elimination bout, Mclntyre
was given the nod by Coach Frye
after a punch that had his opponent
headed for the iÂ«pes.
Larry Bel lwill face Wayne Zook
at 120 lbs., and Bruce Berg vs. Larry
Winter at 127 lbs. rounds out the
card. Bell is another man who comes
to the all-U after winning the nov
ice three months ago.
