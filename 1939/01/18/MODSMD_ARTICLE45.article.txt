tligh point in the a!l-U tourney
set for tomomvo night in the Pa
vilion will be an exhibition match
between Stanford's Johnny Ward
and .lini Svercheck of the Olym
pic Club of San Francisco.
Ward, a sophomore on the
Farm, is such an excelelnt boxer
that there is no one on the campus
who has a good chance of stand
ing up to him in a real bout.
Only Stan Anderson, heavyweight
slugger whom Ward eliminated in
last year's a!l-l T , might give him
a hard time, but Anderson has
not entered the meet this time.
