# Frosh Have Their Say
## 
### 
THE fraternity survey, filled out by some 250
freshmen Monday night — presumably a
mixed group of pledges and non-pledges—de
bunks a great many of the superstitions, tradi
tions, and hocus-pocus about rushing which
have been popularly current.
It is something of a bubble-popper, and yet
something of a monument to Interfraternity
Council's system of rushing.
Popped bubble number one was that, in the
eyes of the rushed frosh, the houses consider
athletic prowess an important factor. And vice
versa, that a display of lettermen in a house
is one of the main things frosh do not look for.
Instead, a rather sane attitude prevails, ap
parently, in both Encina and on the Row. The
frosh are looking for the qualities of the pledge
class of which they are members, the person
ality of the upper classmen, and the general
campus reputation of the house. Contrariwise,
the houses impress Encina by looking for good
personalities, good personal appearance, and
the freshman's prospective participation in
campus activities. Only one of the latter group,
the second, appears to be an invalid basis for
pledging.
Further, and bearing out what Interfraternity
Council has already said, pledging before the
final day is not only advised by the freshmen
themselves, but practiced. This, obviously, is
as it should be. Some sorting process must
occur, and the only problem is to remove the
somewhat sinister connotation of the phrase
"take a pin."
That there is such an implication, in the
minds of both freshmen and Rowmen, may be
seen in suggestions given for improving the
rushing system, where frosh decry the appar
ent necessity of "sneaking around corners."
Of late, Interfraternity Councils have attempted
to point out that this necessity is neither real
nor implicit in the system.
Their efforts have apparently had little re
sults, judging by the number of times the com
plaint against this undercover phase of rushing
came up in the survey.
But if this last superstition—that pin-hanging
is one of the Cardinal sins—can be thoroughly
debunked, Stanford's rushing system will be a
long way on the road to idealism.
What Interfraternity Council will find worthy
of note in the survey is yet to be determined.
But, in view of the source of information which
the questionnaires contain—Encina, still damp
from rushing—suggestions for smoothing the
rush road should be considered with more than
usual care.
They ask, among other things, for informal,
off-campus rush parties, for more naturalism
during the rush period, for open-house rush
periods, for pre-Christmas pledging, for spring
quarter pledging, a few for less liquor. And,
with a few exceptions, they are serious.
They know. They've just been through the
mill. And it isn't hard to feel where the paddles
hurt the most. In the survey, they're telling
Interfraternity Council.
