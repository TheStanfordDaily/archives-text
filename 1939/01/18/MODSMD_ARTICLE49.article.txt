# F.D.R. Has His Court
## 
### 
THE Senate yesterday confirmed Franklin
Roosevelt's third appointee to the Supreme
Court of the United States, thereby clinching
an argument which began some two years ago
with the introduction of the Court Bill and has
gradually ended with the appointment of three
profoundly liberal Roosevelt men to a Bench
which only yesterday was damned the length
of the land as deadly, conservative.
That it is not today is due in part to the oblig
ing leftward swing of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes,
the gracious tendency on the part of Mr. Justice
Roberts to play along with the boys, and the
never-shaken integrity of Mr. Justice Stone and
Mr. Justice Brandeis. More immediately, it is
due to the addition of the slap-happy Mr. Jus
tice Black, the self-effacing Mr. Justice Reed, and
now the progressive Mr. Justice Frankfurter.
The condition of Mr. Justice Butler and Mr.
Justice Mcßeynolds, neither of whom has ever
run a temperature higher than 1910, remains
unchanged.
Franklin Roosevelt has his liberal Court at
last, and its newest member is perhaps thp

best appointee of all. A liberal, a jurist, a Jew;
a man who believes in orderly progress under
law, whose respect for the Court will not make
him slight the people, nor his sympathy for the
people make him slight the Court; a man whose
race makes him a fitting appointment for the
world's greatest democracy; a man capable of
seeing the occasional necessity for sacrificing
the law's fine points in order to preserve its
broad, general principles; Cardozo's successor,
and a worthy one.

A symbol—two symbols, one of liberalism,
the other of democracy— Mr. Frankfurter joins
the Supreme Court of the United States with the
best wishes of his adopted country. It is a
comforting thought that in one nation, at least,
man goes forward, and not back.—A. S. D.
