### JOHN COBBS 
AW. GO SPLIT A PARTICIPLE
JYJY BROTHER, the oracle, dropped in last night to
do a maintenance job on the sacred bond and to
lay in some tobacco to last him through the winter.
I was going down for the third time in a whirlpool of
business law, and so he was able to get himself thor
oughly entangled in the best chair before I could think
up a good excuse for tossing him. He filled his pipe
carefully, pocketed it, and quietly attached one of my
cigarettes. Then he hauled a book from under his
arm and spoke like a fundamentalist mullah to a fal
tering Mohammedan.
'This guy," he said, "has really got something.
Listen to this." He began to read with an impressive
ness, usually reserved for wills and sacred scriptures.
I gave up my fight with the rights of innocent third
parties, which it seems are not faculty teas, although
they are equally uninteresting.

The article was a critical essay by a professor, and
was intended to reveal just what's wrong with modern
students and modern colleges. Once upon a time a
student had come to the professor with a question
about a course. The good pedagogue had started in
to answer and had sidetracked into a discussion of
Greek poetry. Half an hour later he paused to comb
the dactyls out of his beard, and the student repeated
his original question. That, said the professor, be
trayed a mind lower than the underside of a worm.
The student, he concluded, would get his information,
but he had a mind that would split participles forever.
It took me some time to get my brother and his
mental wings out of the room. But after I had seen
him into the hall, I took a minute off to fume about
professors who write books to show the world what
beautiful machinery they have under their mortar
boards.

i N , this case I don't at all grudge the professor the
jolly time he had palling around with Homer and the
boys. But a soaring mind like his ought to see that
even without an honor code Homer would be damn
little use on an examination in another subject. It.
seems to me that the student demonstrated an I.Q.
that made the professor look like something the au
thorities ought to investigate. The student knew that
he was going to get that particular point or one just
like it on the next exam. And he knew that the whole
Greek civilization couldn't raise his grade one point
if he didn't know it.
I have never been able to understand how some
professors get the idea that we dissect grammar be
cause of some innate urge to tear things apart, or
split infinitives for exercise. There seems to be a divi
sion of intellect among professors that is almost psycho
pathic. They spend their days teaching us how to
sneak up on commas, and then they go home to
write books about the comma-cursed mind of the
student.
>;< >i« * $
It wasn't the students who put the commas in the
curriculum. The professors introduced English A and
allied evils. We take them because we are forced to,
and we comfort ourselves with the thought that they
may be good for the soul.
I suggest that the next time a professor has an urge
to write a book about students he do a little reading on
the legal subject of duress. I also refer him to the
scriptures. He who sows the wind shall reap the
whirlwind. He who sows commas shall reap semi
colons.
