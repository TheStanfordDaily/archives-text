MONDAY IN THE LIRE

In one of my very, very many trips to the Library
yesterday, I went up to the desk upstairs just as a
gal, with three obviously overdue books in front of
her, was saying to the guy in charge:
"As I always say, honesty always pays."
"Yeah, but not as much as this is going to cost
you," the guy said.
And sooner or later I was in the Reference room
thumbing through the wrong volume of John Lyly's
works, and I came across a page with the word
"Poetry" written across the top iti large letters. And
underneath it in parenthesis was the caption, if I
may call it that, "doubtful."
Which was exactly the way I felt about it.

Speaking of libraries, a transfer woman from Ore
gon came up to me the other day and wanted to do
me nameless bodily injuries for printing the remarks of
another Oregon gal that at Oregon people go to the
library to get their dates, and nothing more.
"It's all a lie," she said. "I had plenty of dates when
I was at Oregon—and I never once had to go to the
library."
But I still don't see why she seemed so wrought up
about the matter. After all, what I said was that the
library there is used for practically nothing but date
getting, not that the library was the only place you
could get a date.

Every now and then I think of it. It was a perfect
picture of futility.
It was one stiflinßly hot spring quarter Sunday two
years ago. I had just come out of The Daily Shack
and was walking down toward the Quad when a some
what bedraggled looking woman tugging two slightly
damp kids along by the hands stopped me. She was
going in the other direction.
"Where." she asked, "where are the Cactus Gardens.,
I didn't have the heart to tell her that they were
half a mile back the other way, and she wouldn't like

me nameless bodily injuries for printing the remarks of
another Oregon gal that at Oregon people go to the
library to get their dates, and nothing more.
"It's all a lie," she said. "I had plenty of dates when
I was at Oregon—and I never once had to go to the
library."
But I still don't see why she seemed so wrought up
about the matter. After all, what I said was that the
library there is used for practically nothing but date
getting, not that the library was the only place you
could get a date.
Docs that make it any clearer?

BLEAK
Every now and then I think of it. It was a perfect
picture of futility.
It was one stiflinßly hot spring quarter Sunday two
years ago. I had just come out of The Daily Shack
and was walking down toward the Quad when a some
what bedraggled looking woman tugging two slightly
damp kids along by the hands stopped me. She was
going in the other direction.
"Where." she asked, "where are the Cactus Gardens.,
I didn't have the heart to tell her that they were
half a mile back the other way, and she wouldn't like
them anyway. Not on a hot, drab day like that. With
those two damp kids.
I told her they were straight ahead a couple of
blocks. I'm sure she found the lake much more re

MONDAY IN THE LIRE

In one of my very, very many trips to the Library
yesterday, I went up to the desk upstairs just as a
gal, with three obviously overdue books in front of
her, was saying to the guy in charge:
"As I always say, honesty always pays."
"Yeah, but not as much as this is going to cost
you," the guy said.
And sooner or later I was in the Reference room
thumbing through the wrong volume of John Lyly's
works, and I came across a page with the word
"Poetry" written across the top iti large letters. And
underneath it in parenthesis was the caption, if I
may call it that, "doubtful."
Which was exactly the way I felt about it.
CAN he
Speaking of libraries, a transfer woman from Ore
gon came up to me the other day and wanted to do
me nameless bodily injuries for printing the remarks of
another Oregon gal that at Oregon people go to the
library to get their dates, and nothing more.
"It's all a lie," she said. "I had plenty of dates when
I was at Oregon—and I never once had to go to the
library."
But I still don't see why she seemed so wrought up
about the matter. After all, what I said was that the
library there is used for practically nothing but date
