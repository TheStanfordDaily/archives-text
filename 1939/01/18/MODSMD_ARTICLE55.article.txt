## CHESS CLUB NEEDED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There is something which has
puzzled u.s since we entered this uni
versity. Why is there no chess club
at Stanford? Why can't one of the
oldest and finest recreations be fos
tered here? Do all of your chess
playei* waste all of their time play
ing only with their queens? There
must be some students on the cam
pus who wish to improve their
minds as well as have a lot of fun.
Then why not organize a chess club
to enable us to these men
tal gymnastics?
