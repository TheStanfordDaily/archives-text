# RAIN, RAIN, GO AWAY

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford students are optimistic
without the least doubt as proved
when a boat house was ordered
with a shout.
The old boathouse was good enough
for a lake that was dry but tear
it down, burn it up, that was the
campus cry.
A chance of a lake lull of water was
one we had to take until the
weather man's report causes our
hearts to quake.
So it's hurry, men, hurry, saw that
board, pound that nail, complete
this boathouse because it might
rain of hail.
And if it did—what in hell do you
suppose we could do with water,
water everywhere—even enough to
float a canoe.
