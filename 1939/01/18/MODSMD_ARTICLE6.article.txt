TRYING OUT THEIR PRESENTS, the doctors at the Men's Health Service are showing how their two latest pieces of equipment are

McGuire. (Incidentally, he found none.) To the right, Dr. Charles E. Shcpard shows how a person operates the new audiometer that was
given the Health Service by two of the doctors in the Stanford Lane Hospital. (Daily Photos)
