### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
r |MIE Patent Leather Kid could
lightâ€”sure he could; you've
never seen a welterweight with a
left like that. But. somehow, the
Kid didn't have the stufT; when he
got in the ring he folded, he was
yellow.
Right now France has her own
Patent Leather Kid. The time has
come for Premier Daladier to climb
under the ropes and give the Span
ish Loyalists a little help, but he
hasn t. got the guts to take the only
action which will keep France from
l>eing strangled in the embrace of
three Easiest neighbors.
Daladier refuses to open the
Spanish frontier for the transpor
tation of munitions and food sup
plies to the Republican forces.
Despite the excited opposition of
the Ix-ft. the French Premier will
not take the decisive step which,
he knows will pour salt on the
Italo-French wound.
A Frenchman is an extremely
emotional patriot, and today a good
many Frenchmen arc pretty rabid
on the subject of Italy's aid for
Rebel Spain. The time has come,
they think, for Franco to come
across with a little practical help
lor a Loyalist government that is all
set. to go down for the third time.
Daladier refuses to open the fron
tier; 50,000,000 Frenchmen think
that's treason.
Even a man with his popularity
and prestige can't get away with an
unpatriotic stand. All eyes will be
<>n Paris for the next 'IS hours to
see if the Daladier cabinet will
stand or fall when the Deputies vote
on the yellow foreign policy.
| )OWN on the Spanish penin
sula the Loyalists are still
keeping a stilT upper lip. I inn in
their resolution to light to the last
ditch to keep Barcelona from
Franco's hands, the government
yesterday rushed truckloads of
troops to the little town of Igulada,
lis miles from the capital.
Objt ?ct of this move is to keep the
Rebels from capturing the village
and using it for a new base for at
tacks upon Barcelona's ring of
fortiiications. With superior equip
ment. and plenty of Mussolini's '"vol
unteers" in his favor, Franco is go
ing to be a tough man to stop. But
the Republican government stiil
lives, and where there is life there's
hope.
IJIUTAINS left wing yesterday
added its voice to demands that
the democracies of Europe inter
vene in favor of Loyalist Spain.
In front of London's most famed
private residence, 10 Downing
Street, 2000 Communists gathered,
nhouting "Arms for Spain!" until
they were dispersed with typical
efficiency by courteous hut firm
Itohhies.
Meanwhile, the Labor Party pro
tested the government's non-inter
vent ion policy and petitioned Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain to
send arms to Barcelona. Typical was
the conservative reply of Europe's
one-time peace-maker; His Majes
ty's Government, fearing that inter
vention would only lead to a spread
of the conflict, will take no action.
The defeat of the Armada seems
so long ago.
IN GERMANY Adolf Hitler and
Co. is due for a little shake-up. It
seems that Paul Gocbbels, vice
president in charge of propaganda,
Jew baiting, and movie actresses is
going to be demoted, and General
Goering is going to be moved up to
the front office.
Returning from a vacation neces
sitated by what may have been a
severe beating administered by
friends of the husband of his movie
mistress (United Press) or an at
tack of influenza (official Nazi news
agencies), Gocbbels will find that he
has lost the Propaganda Ministry
and has been relcgaled to the posts
of leader of National Socaili.st dis
tricts and Governor of Berlin.
Gocbbels' set-hack and the
awarding of the Vice-Chancellor
ship and the Ministry of War to
uniform-loving Goering, dclinite
l\ establish him as Public Nazi
No. 2. There are a lot of people
in this world that are shedding no
tears over the club-footed. Aryan
propagandist's taking a back seat.
