# Steinbeck Plan Suggests Migratory Labor Solution
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
A Migratory Labor Board should
be established to handle the prob
lem of California's wandering
workers.
So suggests Stanford graduate
John Steinbeck, whose pamphlet,
"Their Blood Is Strong," concludes
its study of the state's chief prob
lem with this specific proposal for
its solution, and incidentally makes
clear why the newly organized
Stanford Relief Committee is can
vassing the campus this week in an
attempt to gather discarded
clothes.
Forced to follow .seasonal crops,
drifting from one end of the slate
to the other as the year changes, his
security threatened by low wage
made lower by the competition <>l
Japanese and Mexican labor, the
migratory worker in California find
his livelihood extremely precarious,
his chances of ever e: I iblishing a
stable economy extremely slim.
Crowded into makeshift tents on
the outskirts of agricultural com
munities which are unequipped to
support him, and have no facilities
for the schooling of his children,
his lif<> has been complicated still
more in the past year by the enor
mous influx of indigent familie from
the Dust Bowl areas of the Middle
West.
At the present time, according lo
Mr. Steinbeck, the federal govern
ment is attempting to solve this
problem by offering semi-perma
nent housing to the unemployed, in
two different camps. (There are
now three, one having been estab
lished fit Farmersville since Mr.
Steinbeck wrote.) Built a little over

a year ago at Arvin, near Bakers
field, and Marysville, near Sacra
mento, the original two furnish, in
the words of the report, "a social ;md
economic study of great interest."
Present camps are set. up on '
leased ground, although the govern- !
inent plans to buy the land for the !
remaining seven it hopes to estab- |
li.sh. Tent-space is provided, and
such permanent structures as wash
rooms, toilets, and showers, arc I
provided. Equipment ;it the Arvin '
ramp, exclusive of land-rent, cost j
approximately $18,000.
Social organization at. the camps j
provides a part-time nurse, and a,
resident manager who directs day- i
to-day life and maintains order, i
There are only three restrictions on I
residence: the men must be bona |
lido farm people, intending to work;'
they mu: • help pr< crvc the ck'anli-j
ness ol the camp; and, in lieu of j
paying rent, they must devote two J
hours a week toward the mainte
nance and improvement of the
camp.
Encouragement of self - govern- j
ment ha: resulted in .1 "simple and
workable democracy." the report
states. On the basi of four divi
ion.s, each of which elects a repre
entative to .1 central governing
committee, the camp runs it elf,
subject to a veto rarely exercised •
by the camp manager. An enter
tainment committee, a maintenance
committee, and a "Good Neighbors"
committee a women's social and
charitable organization complete
the structure of migrant self-gov
ernment.
No one on relief is admitted to
; the camps, according to Mr. Stein
' beck. It is because many on relief
' try that he would establish a Migra
tory Labor Board. It would have
branches throughout the state, and
would be able to furnish labor un
ions with advance information on
crop needs, thereby eliminating the
"great, disorganized gold rush" for
jobs which characterizes migrant
I labor now. It would also do away
with the problem which Stanford is
j at present helping to solve — the
1 problem of providing adequate
I clothing for indigent Americans.
