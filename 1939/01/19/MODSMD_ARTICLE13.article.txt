PROMOTES friendship
C iiculator of the petition is Mau

j scheme as a chance for hall men to
j to know each other better.
"It wouldn't just lx' the back-wash
from the fraternities and eating clubs
i' hat. would lx' eating there," lie said
j last night. "There arc plenty of
rhall men on the campus who want
remain independent of any formal
organization but still need a good
place to eat."
The petition follows:
"We, the undersigned residents ol
Stanford University halls, would be
interested in eating at the Branner
dining room, and we request the
University authorities to open and
operate said dining room for our
use."
CLOSED KM aIT YEARS
Opened nine years ago when Bran
ner Hall was built, tlx; dining hall
was shut, down before the first year
had passed because of lack of pa
tronage.
One method of preventing recur
rence of this, Mr. Erwin pointed out,
would be to charge a heavy deposit
at the beginning of the year, appli
cable on the spring quarter board
bill, heavy enough to keep students
from dropping out before the year
is up.
The kitchen is modern and en
tirely adequate, having been built,
later than the one serving Encina
Commons. Getting the place into
shape after its eight years of idle
ness probably would cost $5,000 or
more, Mr. Erwin said. Included in
this amount is the cost of assembling
a kitchen staff, fitting the place with
new plates and silverware, and in
stalling several improvements not in
use when the kitchen was built.
Dean ol Men John Bunn was em
phatic in his approval of trying to
start the dining hall functioning
again. It is too bad that one of the
best equipped kitchens on 'he cam
pus remains idle, while many of
the students arc forced to cat at.
restaurants," he said.
"Use of the dining hall was stopped
because of lack of demand. Now it
begins to look as if there is again a
demand. If a sufficient number ol
persons would eat there to make it
a paying proposition, I'm quite sure
the University would be willing to
operate the dining room again."

The kitchen is modern and en
tirely adequate, having been built,
later than the one serving Encina

more, Mr. Erwin said. Included in
this amount is the cost of assembling
a kitchen staff, fitting the place with
new plates and silverware, and in
stalling several improvements not in
use when the kitchen was built.
