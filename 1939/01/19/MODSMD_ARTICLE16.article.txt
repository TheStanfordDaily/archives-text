# Luncheon Club Hears Organist
## Music, Propaganda Subject of Speech 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist and chairman of the Division
of Music, spoke on "Music and
Propaganda" at yesterday's meeting
of the Luncheon Club. He was aid
ed in his discussion with sound ef
fects on the bugle by Charles Buck.
"Music has meaning," he said,
"but only that which is read into
it."
"In the recent lectures on propa
ganda," said Allen, "two views are
presented; one that propaganda and
education are synonymous, and one
that America is the only
where propaganda may be freely
discussed. There was never more
rigid control of music than in Nazi
Germany. Connecting music with
politics arouses indignation in many;
others say music was made for pow
er and should be used to dominate
ideas. '
"Military music was as snappy as
concert music was witty in the past,
but revolution brought a different
style of march. It became a style of
protest to raise up a lethargic peo
ple to shake off oppression.
"I predict that if another war
should come, we will be 'swung'
into it. Swing music would lose its.
comic appeal, but it would be the
prevalent type," said Mr. Allen.
"True appreciation of music comes
from a love of both kindsâ€”contem
plative and active. Unless we get to
enjoy both for educational purposes,
we are apt to be victims of propa
ganda."
