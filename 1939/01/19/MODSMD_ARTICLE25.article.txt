### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
will begin to fly at 8 o'clock
tonight to determine all-Univer
sity boxing champs for 1939.
If you get there early, you'll see
a miniature edition of the Tunney-
Dempsey classic. Chuck Mclntyre,
fighting Jack Rice in the 145-pound
class, will mimic Tunney with good

straight punches,
while Rice is a
dead ringer for
Dempsey with his
> weaving style and
effective hooks.
Bob Hovey,
with his varsity

experience in his
favor, and John Wilson, who won
on a technical in the recent novice
bouts, will make an even match of
the 135-pound class.
Another match worth going early
to see will be in the featherweight
division. Bruce Berg, a weaver and
a hard hitter, will fight rangy Larry
Winter, who has taken on weight
since he won the bantam contest in
the novice tournament.
Bill Wilbur is a former University
champ in the welterweight division,
and he moves up a class to meet
Jim McLoud, who reached the nov
ice finals. Jim's real name is Ferdi-

nand, but you'll
sec by his amaz
ing strength and
beautiful hooks
\ that it is a mis
nomer.
When Bill Greer
moved into the
175-pound finals,

fans and coaches
began to sit up and take notice.
Greer is a good competitive fighter
with plenty of strength and powerful
punches, but he is aiming toward
mod school and finds little time to
get into shape.
You'll see a change in Yank
Levin, who bowed to Tom Collins
in the novice finals. The stocky
fiosh grid star was wearing
gloves almost for the first time
three months ago. but lie has
learned a great deal in the mean
time. lie is less of a slugger
and more of a fighter—and he
knows more about protecting him
self from the opponent's blows.
Outstanding performance of the
evening will be the heavyweight ex
hibition bout between John Ward
and Jim Svercheck, who holds sev
eral titles for the Olympic Club..
Ward automatically wins his gold
en glove by default of University
competition, but the bout has been
arranged to give observers a chance
to see Stanford's number one var
sity boxer in action.

Jim McLoud, who reached the nov
ice finals. Jim's real name is Ferdi-

nand, but you'll
sec by his amaz
ing strength and
beautiful hooks
\ that it is a mis
nomer.
When Bill Greer
moved into the
175-pound finals,

fans and coaches
began to sit up and take notice.
Greer is a good competitive fighter
with plenty of strength and powerful
punches, but he is aiming toward
mod school and finds little time to
get into shape.
You'll see a change in Yank
Levin, who bowed to Tom Collins
in the novice finals. The stocky
fiosh grid star was wearing
gloves almost for the first time
three months ago. but lie has
learned a great deal in the mean
time. lie is less of a slugger
and more of a fighter—and he
knows more about protecting him
self from the opponent's blows.
Outstanding performance of the
evening will be the heavyweight ex
hibition bout between John Ward
and Jim Svercheck, who holds sev
eral titles for the Olympic Club..
Ward automatically wins his gold
en glove by default of University
competition, but the bout has been
arranged to give observers a chance
to see Stanford's number one var
sity boxer in action.

yesterday in the mat room of

tumbling champ, took a workout.
Formerly a University of California
gymnast, he was asked by Myron

tonight to determine all-Univer

If you get there early, you'll see
a miniature edition of the Tunney-
Dempsey classic. Chuck Mclntyre,
fighting Jack Rice in the 145-pound
class, will mimic Tunney with good

straight punches,
while Rice is a
dead ringer for
Dempsey with his

Bob Hovey,
with his varsity

experience in his
favor, and John Wilson, who won
on a technical in the recent novice
bouts, will make an even match of
the 135-pound class.
Another match worth going early
to see will be in the featherweight
division. Bruce Berg, a weaver and
a hard hitter, will fight rangy Larry
Winter, who has taken on weight
since he won the bantam contest in
the novice tournament.
