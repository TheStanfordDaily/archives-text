# Fifteen Boxers Set For Tourney In Pavilion At 8
## 
### BILL RICHEY 
After two days of rest, the 15 best boxers on the Farm are ready
to go in the biggest all-University Tournament that this campus has
ever staged. The Stanford hand will sound the call to arms at 8
o'clock tonight, when the first fighters enter the ring at thv Pa
vilion. Admission will he free to holders of student body cards, and

55 cents to the public.
Outstanding event on the pro
gram will be the exhibition match
between Sophomore Johnny Ward
and Jim Svercheek, of the San
Francisco Olympic Club. Heavy
weight Ward is so far above the
rest of the campus boxers that none
of the tourney entrants has been
able to stand up to him, so the ex
hibition match promises to give the
Farm a chance to see in action the
most skilled boxer it; has produced
in years.
A major upset of the pre-tourney
dope came in the last ol' the semi
final matches when Bill Greer
eliminated Hal Saunders to gain a
spot on tonight's card in the heavy
weight division. All sources rated
Saunders the best bet to enter the
Pavilion ring against Yank Levin,
frosh griddcr, but Greer, a sopho
more from Sacramento, was in
there to win while Saunders seemed
to show the effects of poor condition.
Tonight's show will have a num
ber of highlights outside of the
ring. The troup of gymnasts who
were a favorite with the crowd at
the last boxing show will appear
again, and the university band will
give out between matches.
Among the judges for the meet
will be Harry B. Smith, San Fran
cisco sports writer. Jake Irwin will
referee the bouts, scheduled to go
three rounds in all eight divisions.
Completing the list of entrants are
Tom Mac-Michael. John Wilson, Bob
Hovey, Larry Bell, Wayne Zook,
Chuck Mclntyre, and Jack Rice.
From tonight's victors will come
the aspirants for the Gene Tunney
awards, one in each weight division.
Given by the ex-champ himself,
these awards are the highest boxing
recognition offered at the Farm.
