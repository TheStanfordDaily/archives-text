# Clean Sport, Flying Fists Lure Women
## 
### 
Boxing has always been a man's
j sports, it's true. But until women
: changed from animal skins to skirts,
took the bones out of their hair and
clipped in a gardenia, they were
always interested spectators.
Unfortunately, boxing history
year after year has shown women
I to be losing their love for the smell
j of manly sweat in their longing for
i Nuit de Paris together with a gen
j eral timid shrinking from any thud
!of fusts. It has only been during
j the past couple of years that, deli—
i cate feminine features have been
i blooming among the rank beards of
' the Rough at Stanford's All-Univer
j sity boxing matches.
Now to their surprise they are
! finding that they have been missing
| years of a sport which is good and
! clean and embodies the speed of
: basketball, the pugnaciousness of
J football, and the accuracy of tennis
! —and which is not at all like the
| Whitman massacre as they had ex
pected.
HANGOVER HOLDS
! Boxing unfortunately has a hang-
I over from the anything-goes days
I when the spectators usually ended
! up in the ring alongside the pugil
i ists for a little genuine rough-and
| tumble. Flying fists, flailing ring
i posts, and colorful fight language
! undoubtedly seemed a poor en
vironment for ladies of that day.
The difference today lies in the
! fact that everything is done accord
j ing to rules. A referee calls the
' punches. The contestants will be
! congratulated instead of beaten,
and the language would not offend
Queen Victoria herself.
NO GREEK GORILLAS
Tonight, red-blooded women at
tending the all-Universities will not
| see two battered gorillas trading
, whacks; they will see fellows whom
j they know well "squaring off" for
' the sake of miniature golden boxing
| gloves which will signify champion
i ship in one sport at least which can
j unreservedly be considered a Man's
; Sport.
May the women's "o-o-ohs" and
"a-a-ahs" of yesterday change to a
i "Hit'm in the stomach! Slug—!" of
| today.

Boxing has always been a man's
j sports, it's true. But until women
: changed from animal skins to skirts,
took the bones out of their hair and
clipped in a gardenia, they were
always interested spectators.
Unfortunately, boxing history
year after year has shown women
I to be losing their love for the smell
j of manly sweat in their longing for
i Nuit de Paris together with a gen
j eral timid shrinking from any thud
!of fusts. It has only been during
j the past couple of years that, deli—
i cate feminine features have been
i blooming among the rank beards of
' the Rough at Stanford's All-Univer
j sity boxing matches.
Now to their surprise they are
! finding that they have been missing
| years of a sport which is good and
! clean and embodies the speed of
: basketball, the pugnaciousness of
J football, and the accuracy of tennis
! —and which is not at all like the
| Whitman massacre as they had ex
pected.
HANGOVER HOLDS
! Boxing unfortunately has a hang-
I over from the anything-goes days
I when the spectators usually ended
! up in the ring alongside the pugil
i ists for a little genuine rough-and
| tumble. Flying fists, flailing ring
i posts, and colorful fight language
! undoubtedly seemed a poor en
vironment for ladies of that day.
The difference today lies in the
! fact that everything is done accord
j ing to rules. A referee calls the
' punches. The contestants will be
! congratulated instead of beaten,
and the language would not offend
Queen Victoria herself.
