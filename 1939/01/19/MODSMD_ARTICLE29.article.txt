# Dean Plans Secret Plays For Cal Tilt
## 
### 
Unimpressed by California's 52-
35 victory over the Cal Aggies last
i Tuesday or by the 43-36 win the
Bear reserves scored over the Na
tional University of Mexico the
night before, Stanford's cagers con
| tinued their preparations for Fri
day night's "Big Game" in the Pa
j vilion.
Coach Everett Dean is cooking up
| something for the Bears, but just
j what his plans are won't be re-
I vealed until game-time Friday
; night. One definite advantage the
Indians will have this week-end that
was absent against S.C. is tip-top
i physical condition.
Lee Lal'aille is once again round
i ing into, shape after a severe cold,
j and his return complicates the sit
uation extremely, with Dean having
j six men to fill the five starting posi
: tions. Captain Phil Zonne is sure to
! open at one forward, but the rest
I of the starting positions are now in
| a jumble between Lafaille, Bill Rapp,
Don Burness, Kenny Davidson, and
! Bob Burnett. Dean indicated that
| he won't be sure of his starting
| quintet until 8 o'clock Friday eve
i ning.
The danger of an upset loss to
j San Francisco State Saturday looni
(ed a strong possibility for the
1 Cards, with Dean putting all stress
! on the Bear game, and completely
j overlooking the Staters.
Coach Dan Farmer has in Joe
Sanz one of the best shooting for
i wards in the Bay Region, and Dave
j Kirwin has a reputation of being on
I a par with any of the guards on
1 big league teams. The Staters have
â–  won ten out of eleven games, and
t number among their victims the
i Olympic Club and Y.M.I, quintets.
; Stanford's reserves will play the
I University of Mexico in the second
j game of Saturday night's double
| header.
