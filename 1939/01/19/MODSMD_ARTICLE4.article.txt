# Committee Proposes Chinese Aid
## International Group May Suggest Two Lingnan Scholarships 
### HARRY SHELDON 
Already faced with the problem
of the foreign .student at Stanford,
the A.S.S.U. International Commit
tee this week announced that it was
ready to step into the international
scene and help foreign students
abroad.
Still in the formative stage, the
committee's idea as outlined by Mel
j Jacoby, former student from Stan
i ford at Lingnan University in
j China, is to establish two scholar-
I ships for Chinese students at that
institution.
In acknowledgment of scholar
ships given American students in
past years at Lingnan as well as a
gesture of good will, the committee
feels that establishment of such
j scholarships is particularly needed
j to aid worthy scholars who are pro
j hibited from attending the univer
[ sit.y because of financial difficulties.
CANTON SCHOLARSHIPS
For the past four years, from two
| to six men and women students
I from Stanford and approximately 15
I other American universities, includ
ing Harvard, the University of Penn
| sylvania, and the University of
! California, have received scholar
ships to study in Canton.
In return, only occasional Chinese
I students have come to the United
Slates for study.
Principal reason for the discrep
j ancy in number of students ex
| changed lies in the difference in
] monetary value, where the Ameri
i can money is worth approximately
five times that of the Chinese,
j *200 NKILDKI)
For approximately $200 in Ameri
can money, the committee could es
tablish a scholarship in China which
would be equivalent to $1000 in this
country.
Started by American missionaries,
Lingnan was turned over to the
Chinese government during the
j Nationalist, movement.
Al the present time, however, the
missionaries retain some of the uni
versity's properties and money for
sending American students is raised
in the United States, given to the
University, and then redrawn.
CLASSES AT NIGHT
Recently bombed, the university's
j Canton campus was closed last
j month, and professors and students
j moved to Hong Kong, where
classes are held at night on the
Hong Kong University campus.
Pointing to the difficulty of main
taining the institution during war
conditions, Jacoby said that profes
sors, of whom about one-third arc
American, have recently taken a
one-third cut in salary.
Present Stanford students who
hfve attended Lingnan in former
I years include Helen Oilman, Max
i Shaffrath, Frank Wilson, Maygcnc
j Dunbar, and Jacoby.
j INTERNATIONAL RKTICKNCE
In the meantime, still concerned
with the status of the foreign stu
dent on the Stanford campus and
the Farm's general indifference to
j the problem, the committee is con
! tinning work on the establishment
I of some type of "International" rcsi
j dence on campus.
I Last year, two such problems
| faced the committee.
As one foreign student said, "Our
problems here, naturally, are nu
! mcrous, but they can be remedied
j very easily.
"The two most important are
| getting our units properly evaluated
i when we come here, and our not
! knowing anyone here, and having
, little chance of ever knowing any-
I one well."
j To correct the fust, the commit
tee this year had members posted
j in the Administration Building to
i aid students on Registration Day, to
j help them (ind residences, and wade
j through oilier necessary red tape.
Not quite so simple has been the
solution to the latter. On a limited
budget, the committee has been
able to carry on a program of month
ly social meetings for foreign stu
dents at professor's homes.
EXCHANGE IDEAS
Ideal toward which the committee
is working is the International
house idea, however, whereby
both foreign and American students
would live together, exchange ideas,
and foreign students would be
drawn into Stanford's social and
political life.
Possible solution suggested last
year was that men could be housed
on the top floor of Encina but no
positive action was taken. Still in
the future is the construction of a
university graduate men's dormi
tory, where foreign men could be
housed.
