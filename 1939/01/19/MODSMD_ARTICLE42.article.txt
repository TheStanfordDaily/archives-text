# Knocking on Branner's Door
## 
### 
WHEN The Daily struck a match to light
some of the obscurity enveloping the
Branner Dining Hall, it apparently set fire to a
pile of tinder-dry brush.
Within two days, a blaze has started to make
the Dining Hall reopening closer to reality than
it has been since its first unsuccessful trial run.
The University is behind the proposal to the
extent of saying it is "very likely" that Toyon
and Branner-ites may eat at home next year if
150 will agree to patronize their own Dining
Hall.
But even more astounding has been the re
sponse from the actual persons concerned with
the problem—the eating club-less, Dining Hall
less residents. Led by active Maurice Knox, over
half the requisite number have already signed
the petition for reopening which he has circu
lated during the last day and one-half.
The snowball is rolling; with only a little
more impetus it will bowl down the hill until
it smashes open the Dining Hall door.
It should not stop now.
Here is the chance for which foot-loose Hall
men have been waiting. And there are enough
of them. Eating clubs only partially solve the
dilemma of the Dining Hall-less hall, since, like
fraternities, they retain the right to be exclu
sive, do not provide eating facilities for more
than half of Toyon-Branner residents. The rest
have unwillingly faced the unfortunate alter
native of shifting for themselves.
Evidently they are sick of it.
Here is their chance.
Campus Opinioner No. 1, writing today on
the subject, has already looked forward to the
possibility that the attitude toward eating at
home which first closed the Dining Hall has
not changed; his suggestions for alternative
uses to which the room may be put are worth
considering—later, if the movement fails.
But now the battle is half won. With the
completion of Knox's petition (the present Uni
versity feeling persisting when it is presented),
it will be all over but the shouting.
Exactly 71 more names are needed, exactly
71 Toyon or Branner men who are sick of the
three-times daily trek to Palo Alto or the Cellar.
They can have their own Dining Hall, if they
will only ask for it.
Let them ask.

Evidently they are sick of it.
Here is their chance.
Campus Opinioner No. 1, writing today on
the subject, has already looked forward to the
possibility that the attitude toward eating at
home which first closed the Dining Hall has
not changed; his suggestions for alternative
uses to which the room may be put are worth
considering—later, if the movement fails.
But now the battle is half won. With the
completion of Knox's petition (the present Uni
versity feeling persisting when it is presented),
it will be all over but the shouting.
Exactly 71 more names are needed, exactly
71 Toyon or Branner men who are sick of the
three-times daily trek to Palo Alto or the Cellar.
They can have their own Dining Hall, if they
will only ask for it.
Let them ask.
WHEN The Daily struck a match to light
some of the obscurity enveloping the
Branner Dining Hall, it apparently set fire to a
pile of tinder-dry brush.
Within two days, a blaze has started to make
the Dining Hall reopening closer to reality than
it has been since its first unsuccessful trial run.
The University is behind the proposal to the
extent of saying it is "very likely" that Toyon
and Branner-ites may eat at home next year if
150 will agree to patronize their own Dining
Hall.
But even more astounding has been the re
sponse from the actual persons concerned with
the problem—the eating club-less, Dining Hall
less residents. Led by active Maurice Knox, over
half the requisite number have already signed
the petition for reopening which he has circu
lated during the last day and one-half.
The snowball is rolling; with only a little
more impetus it will bowl down the hill until
it smashes open the Dining Hall door.
It should not stop now.
Here is the chance for which foot-loose Hall
men have been waiting. And there are enough
of them. Eating clubs only partially solve the
dilemma of the Dining Hall-less hall, since, like
fraternities, they retain the right to be exclu
sive, do not provide eating facilities for more
than half of Toyon-Branner residents. The rest
have unwillingly faced the unfortunate alter
native of shifting for themselves.
Evidently they are sick of it.
Here is their chance.
