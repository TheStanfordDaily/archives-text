# Stanford's Internationals
## 
### 
WORKING quietly behind the walls of Stan
ford's indifference to the world outside,
for the last two years a small group has effi
ciently gone about the business of being hospi
table to foreign students on this campus.
That group's record for its short-lived exist
ence is impressive. A year ago, little outside
of small parties had been organized for the
foreigners. This year, it met a large problem
by helping them through the red tape of regis
tration.
At present, with the largest problem of all—
campus housing of foreign students—still star
ing them in the face, members of the committee
have tackled the idea of establishing two
scholarships at Lingnan University in China.
Offhand, the idea may seem quixotic; yet,
the committee merely realizes that it is time to
retaliate for favors received. And the commit
tee has chosen the hard way; it's not going to
ask Ex Committee for funds.
As to the campus housing problem, nothing
definite has been done. Everyone from the
alumni in Southern California to the adminis
tration at Stanford has expressed his approval
—but no funds, no action.
Women foreign students are well off. For
tunately, there are few enough of them to be
included in Lagunita and other campus living
groups.
The men, however, picked in many cases
by their own governments as the best in that
country, are shoved into Paly, where they
have no opportunity to meet Stanford and ex
change ideas with its American students.
They are left out of social life, spend most of
their time traveling back and forth when not
studying.
As a consequence, when they leave school
at the end of a year, they have little better
idea of Stanford than when they arrive.

Not only do they lose; Stanford loses.
Suggestions as to what could be done have
been excellent. Yet nobody, outside of the
committee, is actively concerned.
In the face of the arguments, it might be well
for Stanford to take its cue from the Inter
national Committee and forget its traditional
lethargy of interest. —H. L. S.
