OVERDRIVE
A s FAR as I can tell, no research worker has yet
nerved himself to exploring that psychological
backwoods, the minds of the managers of student
drives; and it. is an established fact that even the best
yogis will change the subject tactfully when the mat
ter comes up. I have, therefore, no statistical evidence,
but even so one fact seems obvious. On the Stanford
campus, drive managers consider the A.S.S.U. a fairy
godmother who can work pleasant little miracles like
turning red figures into black. This conclusion is sup
ported by records which chronicle the innumerable
times that assorted Causes have rattled the tin cup
before Ex Committee.
Last Tuesday night the Y.W.C.A. proved the axiom
that though you live on the second floor of the Union,
if you have something to give away the world will
beat a path to your doer. It petitioned the Ex Com
mittee to make a contribution to the Far Eastern
Student Service Fund.
According to present plans the Y.W.C.A. will keep
only $500 of the take from its annual drive and will
turn the rest over to the Fund. The A.S.S.U., it said,
should seize this chance to contribute to one of the
best causes since the Crusades.
Perhaps it would be well to mention at this point
that I have no quarrel with the fund, or with the
Chinese students, or with the Y.W.C.A. The organiza
tion is composed of very fine girls; and its aims are
above reproach. Similarly, the drive is probably one
of the worthiest that has come up since the time when
the Children of Israel were refugees from the Egyptian
purge.
♦ * 4* $
B UT when the Y.W.C.A., or any other drive spon
sor, starts flirting with the A.S.S.U. treasury, it
should have its hands slapped gently. The Associated
Students is a business organization, not a charitable
institution, and its funds are intended for Stanford,
not for Chinese students.
The confusion arises from one of the more ele
mentary points of business law, one that often tosses
dreaming students in corporation finance. For most
purposes the A.S.S.U. is a separate entity, entitled to
handle its own affairs. But. its funds are contributed
by the students ,and are intended to be administered
in Ihe interests of the students. In its drive the
Y.W.C.A. collects once from the students; if it gets
A.S.S.U. money, it collects double from them. And
that is a questionable practice, quite out. of keeping
with the Christian ideals of the organization.
# * sit sj t
If the A.S.S.U. contributes to the Fund, it means
that in effect there has been a blanket assessment,
levying on each Slanford student. And the assessment
will be piled on top of any contributions that Ihe drive
committee has already managed to smile out of the
campus.
The ethics of the situation should appeal to the
Y.W.C.A. even if the economics of it doesn't. After
all, charity springs from the heart, not from blanket
assessments. And in these days of depression even a
fairy godmother can't afford to waste her miracles.

but even so one fact seems obvious. On the Stanford
campus, drive managers consider the A.S.S.U. a fairy
godmother who can work pleasant little miracles like
turning red figures into black. This conclusion is sup
ported by records which chronicle the innumerable
times that assorted Causes have rattled the tin cup
before Ex Committee.
Last Tuesday night the Y.W.C.A. proved the axiom
that though you live on the second floor of the Union,
if you have something to give away the world will
beat a path to your doer. It petitioned the Ex Com
mittee to make a contribution to the Far Eastern
Student Service Fund.
According to present plans the Y.W.C.A. will keep
only $500 of the take from its annual drive and will
turn the rest over to the Fund. The A.S.S.U., it said,
should seize this chance to contribute to one of the
best causes since the Crusades.
Perhaps it would be well to mention at this point
that I have no quarrel with the fund, or with the
Chinese students, or with the Y.W.C.A. The organiza
tion is composed of very fine girls; and its aims are
above reproach. Similarly, the drive is probably one
of the worthiest that has come up since the time when
the Children of Israel were refugees from the Egyptian
purge.
♦ * 4* $
B UT when the Y.W.C.A., or any other drive spon
sor, starts flirting with the A.S.S.U. treasury, it
should have its hands slapped gently. The Associated
Students is a business organization, not a charitable
institution, and its funds are intended for Stanford,
not for Chinese students.
The confusion arises from one of the more ele
mentary points of business law, one that often tosses
dreaming students in corporation finance. For most
purposes the A.S.S.U. is a separate entity, entitled to
handle its own affairs. But. its funds are contributed
by the students ,and are intended to be administered
in Ihe interests of the students. In its drive the
Y.W.C.A. collects once from the students; if it gets
A.S.S.U. money, it collects double from them. And
that is a questionable practice, quite out. of keeping
with the Christian ideals of the organization.
# * sit sj t
If the A.S.S.U. contributes to the Fund, it means
that in effect there has been a blanket assessment,
levying on each Slanford student. And the assessment
will be piled on top of any contributions that Ihe drive
committee has already managed to smile out of the
campus.
The ethics of the situation should appeal to the
Y.W.C.A. even if the economics of it doesn't. After
all, charity springs from the heart, not from blanket
assessments. And in these days of depression even a
fairy godmother can't afford to waste her miracles.

nerved himself to exploring that psychological
backwoods, the minds of the managers of student
drives; and it. is an established fact that even the best
