AND lIOW ARE YOU
They say this is the campus where all tradition is
gone, where people are no longer friendly, where no
one says, "Hello." I'm not so sure about, that.
Yesterday morning I was drifting down the street
in tront of the Li be on my way to an eleven o'clock
class. I was early and the ten o'clocks hadn't let
out yet. Some guy came up from behind me and
asked if he could bum a cigarette.
It was a little unusual, because I had never seen
him before, but not too unnatural. I gave it to him
and when he had it lit I expected him to go his way
and to leave me to drift blissfully on my eleven
o'clock.
But no. He settled back 011 his heels and said mer
rily, "How are you?" And before I could utter more
than a tentative, "Uh—he asked, "Have a good
vacation?"
From there it was easy. We had quite a pleasant
chat. He summed up New York in a sentence, and I
summed up ong Beach in a sentence. We took a
flier at. women, and a passing crack at alcohol. It
was just like talking to someone I know. We talked
for quite a while.
He has an awful lot of troubles.

MODERN ST. AUGUSTINE
As rare a letter as can be found in the annals of
the saints and martyrs is this one received by Men's
Council last month. It ran:
"Sirs:
"Early in 1932 a speeding fine was given me by
your predecessors in office. The amount would have
been disproportionate to the ofTen.se at any time, but
in the black spring of 1932 it denoted appalling lack of
judgment 011 the part of the administrators (in the
opinion of the offender).
"At any rate,» in protesting the amount I used an
excuse, which, while far from devoid of elements of
truth, has at odd intervals rather gnawed at my cow
ard's resort called conscience.
"Although I am of the unshaken conviction that I
have already paid more than the offense called for, I
choose to buy my way back into my own good graces
by the remittance (the amount by which the tine was
reduced by reasons of my using the excuse referred
to) enclosed."
Enclosed was five dollars.

STAR
Our house had a basketball game the other night.
Very natural. Much more natural than (he fact
that they let. me play for a few minutes. Maybe they
were getting tired, or maybe they said, well, we're
getting beaten anyway so what the hell.
But I got in.
Tlie last time I had played basketball, we had been
going one way down the court. This time wc were
going the other way. I was quite mixed up.
We got. the ball down under the basket. I had the
ball (someone must have handed it to me). It looked
clear, so I took a shot. Someone hacked at me as I
shot, but I didn't notice it. I was thinking. My God,
what a thing I've done. I've shot at the wrong basket.
I was very mixed up. It wasn't the wrong basket
at all. And I got two free throws for being fouled
while 1 was shooting.
Which is the story of How I Once Made a Point
Playing Basketball.
