BRANNERITE NO. I
The Editor, Sir:
Your Editorial in today's Daily
about the Branner dining hall has
prompted me to write this letter.
For years before I came to Stanford
I was impressed by the fact that
fraternities were not the only broth
erhood organization that Stanford
had. Those persons who couldn't or
wouldn't go fraternity could always j
join one of Stanford's hospitable j
eating clubs. But, now the sad truth j
must be revealed.
The eating clubs have tlie pre- i
tense of being as exclusive or more
exclusive than fraternities. Of the;
more than 300 hall residents less j
than half belong to clubs. The clubs, \
it is true, cannot accommodate all i
those hall residents, but some clubs j
make no attempt to even let them I
in. Why, there is one club that has j
a membership of less than 20 fcl- j
lows.
MUST EAT AROUND
As a result of this condition many j
persons must involuntarily "eat |
around." There are more than |
enough Toyon and Brannerites to |
warrant the opening of the Branner j
dining hall.
It. has been told to me that there 1
was a poll taken a few years ago,!
asking how many would be inter- |
ested in eating at Branner; and that j
the administration received an in
sufficient amount of favorable an- ;
swers. I should like to emphasize i
that the exclusive nature of eating
clubs would cause the balloting to !
swing the other way today.
NOT LIKE HOME
Stanford (according to the Frosh |
bible) is a residence university,
"just like home." Well, at home, I j
never had to walk, ride, or take the !
train in order to get my meals. The j
food was always right downstairs in
the dining room. Thanks for your j
interest.
