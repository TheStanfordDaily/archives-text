# BRANNERITE NO. 2
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It's about time someone publicized
the lamentable neglect of Branner's
dining hall. The Daily is to be
praised for dragging this skeleton
out of the closet.
The hall is well lighted, attractive
ly decorated, and has a large floor j
space which is unobstructed. Here
are a number of possible uses I
have heard discussed.
1. Gymnasium for Toyon and
Branner men. Such games as bad- i

minton, handball and volleyball
could be played with little expense.
Removable paint wouldn't mar the
floor.
GAME ROOM SUGGESTED.
2. Game room. The Branner lobby
might well be used for its intended
purpose, as a reception room, and
the hall used for ping-pong, pool,
cards. All these at present crowd
the lobby considerably.
3. Informal study and clubroom,
such as the resident houses at Har
vard have. It is impossible at pres
ent to use the Branner lobby for
this purpose. Would provide a good
atmosphere for reading and smok
ing, not possible in the library, and
would be free from distractions,
noise and hard seats.
4. Official hall for jolly-ups. The
B.A.C. is put to the expense of sev
eral hundred dollars each year in
resanding and repolishing floors in
the Pavilion and Women's Gym torn
up by thundering hooves at jolly
ups. Tlie hall is more suited to
dances than these barn-like struc
tures, and the floor is large enough,
about 30 by 75 feet, for the average
jolly-up.
DINING HALL POSSIBLE
5. Dining Hall. A person of some
experience has told me that the
Branner dining hall kitchen is one
of the most completely equipped he
has ever seen. At. present it is slowly
depreciating and returning no inter
est on the investment.
Upperclassmen objecting to eat
ing in the Commons, high prices in
the Cellar, or little variety in the
Encina store might be induced to
return to the campus if it were
opened.
The total revenue of the dining
halls would be increased in this
way, even if the Cellar and others
showed a smaller individual profit.
One alternative would be a co
operatively run dining hall inde
pendent. of the Union, Commons, and
store.
At least they are worth considera
tion.
