### 
Sequoia, the home of the Farm's
greatest extroverts. claims a
world's rcrord.
It claims that \cstcrday more
water - hags were thrown there
than have e\er been thrown in
one -po| at one time before.
Ignoring self-fashioned water
bags as piker stuff, the guys from
Sequoia went down to Palo Alto
and bought brand new paper sacks
lo throw around.
One store is reputed to have
sold I.V)0 sacksâ€”its entire stock,
B\ 7 o'clock lasl night there
wasn't a dr> sack in the place.
Or even one which could be
[ thrown.
