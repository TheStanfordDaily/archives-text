SPRAWLED OUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS is the way Stan
ford looks from ground level. But from 1000 feet in
the air. the University is a unified little group of sand-

stone buildings crouched on a flat space between a bay
and some rolling foothills. In the top picture, the Quad
is seen from above Palm Drive. Below is the group of

dormitories which house Stanford's hall men. Left to
right, they are Brainier, Toyon, and hig hulking Kncina.
