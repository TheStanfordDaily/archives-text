a famous tweed in the new narrow
herringbone and in a diagonal twill
"Brashy" is the English weavers' word meaning crisp on
top and mellow below. And men who have always worn
tweeds know that if it isn't "Brashy"' it isn't authentic
tweed such as is woven on the British Isles. • Now, an
American mill has imitated these almost unimitable Eng
lish tweeds and Roos presents them in the new 3-button
"British Lounge" Model with its easy comfortable drape, its
slightly broader shoulders, lower waistline, slimmer hips,
tapered sleeves and broader lapels—all contributing to the
illusion of greater height, fuller chest and narrower hipline.
