### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
"IT'S the most distressin' situation
that ever you have seen. They're
hangin' men and women now for
wearin' o' the green."
For many and many a year the '
men of Erin have been making
trouble for Mother England. Each
century was marked with the story
of another Irish rebellion until, in
our own day, matters came to a
head with Ireland's last big drive
for independence.
Shortly after the War the Irish
Free State was established, but still
anti-British extremists were not
satisfied. These men formed the
Irish Republican Army and waged
guerilla warfare against the Free
State government until they were
finally defeated, their organization
dissolved and outlawed.
In the past few days the Re
publican Army has given convinc
ing evidence that it is not a de
funct organization, that it still has
ideas of driving England from
Protestant Northern Ireland.
Abortive attempts at bombing
factories throughout England
were followed yesterday with an
effort to bag Neville Chamber
lain's son, Frank, while he was i
visiting in Eire.
Some wild-eyed Irishman tossed j
a bomb at the modest little hotel ]
where the Prime Minister's boy was j
staying, but all it. accomplished was j
to toss a few of the neighbors from j
the beds and splinter the hotel ;
walls.
The whole affair sounds silly, it's
true, but those Irish are a deter
mined lot; when they decide they're
going to make trouble they usually
succeed.
The imprint of the Sinn Fein on j
history is still pretty fresh.

r J' , IIOSE Spanish Loyalists are as
determined a bunch as that land
of lazy gentlemen has ever turned
out. Realizing that Barcelona is in
what might be understood as an
extremely perilous position, the Re
publican government is making
plans to move to Valencia in case
the present capital is taken.
There is only one way the Loy
alists can reach Valencia, and
that is through the Mediterranean
Sea, whicb means they will have
to run Franco's super-effective
naval blockade. Rut they've made
up their minds to do it, and though
you may be able to repulse a
Spanish Loyalist's lighting force,
it's not so easy to change his mind.

r J' , HE United States is hard up;
brief, blunt, but accurate state
ment. The government stands
greatly in need of increased reve
nue, and yesterday President Roo
sevelt renewed his request that
Congress provide a new source of
taxation by legalizing levies on the
salaries of all public servants and
on income Xrom government securi
ties.
The President originally pre
sented this idea last spring, and
now, as then, he backs it up with
three New Deal reasons. It will
equalize taxation, it will divert great
amounts of private capital from tax
exempt bonds to circulation in the
business world, and, obviously, it
will increase government revenues.

Taking no chances in an unpre
dictable world, the United States
is busy arming itself to the teeth.
Latest item on President Roose
velt's emergency defense program
is a $65,000,000 measure for the
construction of 12 new naval
bases.
The significant part of this story
lies in the fact that one of these
bases is going to be located at
Guam, the U. S. possession in the
South Pacific that is practically
within shouting distance of Japan.
Rumor has it that this situation
will be the basis for a stiffened
diplomatic attitude toward the
Japanese on the part of Secretary
Cordell Hull, and will lend a little
much-needed strength to U. S. ar
guments in dealings with Nippon.
