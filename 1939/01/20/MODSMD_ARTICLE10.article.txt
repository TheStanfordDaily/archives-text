# 100 Men Sign Petition To Reopen Dining Hall
## 
### 
Led by dynamic Maurice Knox, over 100 hall men have signed a
petition to reopen the Branner Dining Hall.
After conferences with Assistant Comptroller Ernest Erwin and Direc
tor of Dining Halls Christine Ricker, Knox moves into the third day of
operations with virtual assurance that the hall will be opened if a sulli-

cient number of students so desire.^
From the meeting with Miss j
Ricker, Knox learned that several
plans for running the hall are un
der consideration. The most popu
lar suggestion under consideration
is similar to the one being used by
the Sequoia Eat big Club, where
members pay for their meals day
by day.
Even after a favorable decision,
the Hall could not possibly be open
ed immediately, Knox learned. The
comptroller's office must first figure
costs, prices, and method of pay
ment. Kitchen and service staff
must be assembled, new plates and j
silverware must be obtained, and
several improvements must be un
dertaken. It is estimated that cost
of opening the dining hall would
amount to $5000 or more. Thus, if
the plans arc approved, the hall will
not be available for at least two I
months. i
In a tally early yesterday evening, j
Knox counted 100 signatures on the j
student petition asking for the re- !
opening of the Branner Dining Hall, j
This total includes only Branner and j
Toyon residents. Encinarnen, who
will be able to use the dining hall
next year will be approached in the
next few days.
Branner and Toyon students and
j those living in private residences
! will be eligible to eat in the hall,
j according to present plans. Another
problem that has yet to be ironed
out is how to assure continuous
patronage of the hall throughout
the school year. One method sug
gested is to charge a large deposit
at the beginning of the year, to be
applied on the spring quarter board,
so that the members will not drop
out before the year is up.
This would be to prevent the re
| currence of what happened nine
! years ago, when the Branner Din
ing Hall was first opened. The hall
was closed before the first year was
completed, due to a lack of patron
age.

amount to $5000 or more. Thus, if
the plans arc approved, the hall will
not be available for at least two I
months. i
In a tally early yesterday evening, j
Knox counted 100 signatures on the j
student petition asking for the re- !
opening of the Branner Dining Hall, j
This total includes only Branner and j
Toyon residents. Encinarnen, who
will be able to use the dining hall
next year will be approached in the
next few days.
Branner and Toyon students and
j those living in private residences
! will be eligible to eat in the hall,
j according to present plans. Another
problem that has yet to be ironed
out is how to assure continuous
patronage of the hall throughout
the school year. One method sug
gested is to charge a large deposit
at the beginning of the year, to be
applied on the spring quarter board,
so that the members will not drop
out before the year is up.
This would be to prevent the re
| currence of what happened nine
! years ago, when the Branner Din
ing Hall was first opened. The hall
was closed before the first year was
completed, due to a lack of patron
age.
Led by dynamic Maurice Knox, over 100 hall men have signed a
petition to reopen the Branner Dining Hall.
After conferences with Assistant Comptroller Ernest Erwin and Direc
tor of Dining Halls Christine Ricker, Knox moves into the third day of
operations with virtual assurance that the hall will be opened if a sulli-

cient number of students so desire.^
From the meeting with Miss j
Ricker, Knox learned that several
plans for running the hall are un
der consideration. The most popu
lar suggestion under consideration
is similar to the one being used by
the Sequoia Eat big Club, where
members pay for their meals day
by day.
Even after a favorable decision,
the Hall could not possibly be open
ed immediately, Knox learned. The
comptroller's office must first figure
costs, prices, and method of pay
ment. Kitchen and service staff
must be assembled, new plates and j
silverware must be obtained, and
several improvements must be un
dertaken. It is estimated that cost
of opening the dining hall would
amount to $5000 or more. Thus, if
the plans arc approved, the hall will
not be available for at least two I
months. i
