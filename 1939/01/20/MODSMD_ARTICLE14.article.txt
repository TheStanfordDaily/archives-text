# Robleites Invade Encina Frosh Hold Exchange Dinner
## 
### 
ROBLE
Sixty Robleites nervously await
ed their Encina partners for the Ex
change Dinner last night, wonder
ing whom they would get and what
he would be like. The girls were
prominently labeled with identifi
cation numbers and were feeling
very much like Exhibit A for the
defense.
When the Encina "roughs" start
ed to arrive they wandered through
(he lobbies with a look on their faces
very much like that of the magazine
solicitor looking for a street num
ber in the dark. But after they
were matched up, after everyone
knew where everyone else was
from and why they came to Stan
ford, things proceeded merrily and
the little group of 120 trouped in to
dinner.
Surprise of the evening came
when nine of the Robleites dining
"stag" in the other dining room
j staged a vocal revolt. Sue Atkinson,
| "Little Bug" Lacey, Sylvia Berry,
j Emma Edwards, Jane Thornton,
I Helen Green, Mildred Bevil, Bar
bara Anderson, and Harriet Fly
I trouped in and let go with the fol
| lowing touching verse to the tune
; of Notre Dame's fight song: "We
J are the wallflowers, wallflowers are
I we; we are the goon girls of old
| Roble, for we did not rate a date
| with Encinamen tonight."
After dinner, the gathering ad
! journed to Encina for dancing,
| where a pleasant and profitable
I evening ended in swingtime.

ENCINA
Three score Roble queens last
night walked timorously under the
oft-sprinkled Encina stairwell ex
pecting any instant to be showered
with a chlorinated water bomb
made from the musty pages of a
not-so-old Daily. This was the of
ficious beginning of Encina's half of
the frosh class's first exchange
dinner.
When they had successfully pass
ed the first hurdle, the Robleites
gathered in the lobby to be looked
over by the Encinamen, who were
on their best behavior according to
the wishes of their prexy, Gordy
McDonald. After dinner dates had
been hand-picked, the exchangers
departed for the east dining hall.
Having treated the gals to a 10-min
ute wait before the doors were
opened, the boys ushered them into
the flower-bedecked and candle-lit
dining hall, where Mrs. Bell and the
kitchen staff really did themselves
proud.
After leisurely completing their
repast under a barrage of camera
flash bulbs, the diners returned to
the lobby for an hour of dancing,
but with the 240 exchangers and
the rest of Encina forming an eager
stag line, little was accomplished
toward this end.
But regardless of Ihe bruised
shins, etc., frosh smoothies and
smoothettes adjourned the party
with eager demands for a return
engagement at an early date. The
committee which handled Ihe event
included Jim McKcllar, Gordy Mc
Donald, Peggy Andrews, and Diana
Clark.
