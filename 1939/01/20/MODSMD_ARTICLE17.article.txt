# Cardinals Keyed For Bear Cagers In Series Opener
## Invaders Vow Revenge for Defeats From Luisetti-less Indians Tonight 
### JERRY MAYER 
University of California's gigantic basketball team gallops onto the Pa
vilion floor tonight at 8 o'clock for what Coach Nibs Price hopes will be
the first installment of a four-chapter serial entitled "Compensation for
Three Years of Defeats" or "Frustration."
It's been a long time since Price has had a chance to send his Bears
against a Luisetti-less Card team, and he is gunning for victory tonight

in the first of the four Big Games
on the Conference schedule.
California brings to the Pavilion
one of the finest teams fielded across
the bay in several years. With a
height average of slightly over 6 ft.
3 in., it's a team which would have
given even the great Laughing Boys
a stiff tussle. And with the Stanford
greats of last year gone, the Boars
have been installed heavy favorites
over their successors.
FINE CAKI) SPIRIT
But the Cards have a fine new
coach, Everett Dean, and a spirit
second to no team on the Coast.
Dean's great strategy and the hustle
of the team itself carried the locals
to an upset split series last week
end over a heavily favored Trojan
team.
However, the Cards have their
work cut out for them tonight. The
Trojans were just about the same
height average as Stanford, and the
Indians had an even chance to con
trol the rebounds. Tonight, the
Deanmen will face a team that has
three men towering 6 ft. 4 in. or taller
in Bill Ogilvie, Bob Chalmers and

Bill Biggerstaff, and rebounding
ligainst such a trio of giants is a
matter that has stumped taller teams
than Stanford.
Another factor that favors the
Bears is the fact that they've been
playing together as a unit sincc the
start of the season, wiih only one
man among the substiti es having
seen more than a slight amount of
action.
DEAN SHIFTS MEN
Dean on the other hand has been
shifting men and positions around
continually in order to get a work
ing combination. Phil Zonne started
out as center, Bill Rapp at guard.
Zonne has since been shifted to for
ward, while Rapp has played every
position on the team. Tonight Stan
ford's starting lineup won't even be
set until just before game time, with
six men—Zonne, Rapp, Don Bur
ness, Bob Burnett, Lee Lafaille and
Kenny Davidson—to fill in five posi
tions.
That list doesn't complete the
Cards' talent. Harlan "Bomber"
I Copsey, who regularly plays for
j ward but might see action tonight at
guard in order to utilize his height,
I and Dick Lyon, an aggresisvc guard,
i are both capable replacements. Cop
sey in particular will probably play
an important part in tonight's game.
Along with Ogilvie, Chalmers and
Biggerstaff, the Bears will start Ivor
Harris and Walt Bickerton tonight,
while Guard Harvey Shirk will be

Tomorrow evening, a surprising

i invades the Farm and figures to give
1 the Cards quite an argument. The

and are gunning for recognition by

University of California's gigantic basketball team gallops onto the Pa
vilion floor tonight at 8 o'clock for what Coach Nibs Price hopes will be
the first installment of a four-chapter serial entitled "Compensation for
Three Years of Defeats" or "Frustration."
It's been a long time since Price has had a chance to send his Bears
against a Luisetti-less Card team, and he is gunning for victory tonight

in the first of the four Big Games
on the Conference schedule.
California brings to the Pavilion
one of the finest teams fielded across
the bay in several years. With a
height average of slightly over 6 ft.
3 in., it's a team which would have
given even the great Laughing Boys
a stiff tussle. And with the Stanford
greats of last year gone, the Boars
have been installed heavy favorites
over their successors.
FINE CAKI) SPIRIT
But the Cards have a fine new
coach, Everett Dean, and a spirit
second to no team on the Coast.
Dean's great strategy and the hustle
of the team itself carried the locals
to an upset split series last week
end over a heavily favored Trojan
team.
However, the Cards have their
work cut out for them tonight. The
Trojans were just about the same
height average as Stanford, and the
Indians had an even chance to con
trol the rebounds. Tonight, the
Deanmen will face a team that has
three men towering 6 ft. 4 in. or taller
in Bill Ogilvie, Bob Chalmers and

Bill Biggerstaff, and rebounding
ligainst such a trio of giants is a
matter that has stumped taller teams
than Stanford.
Another factor that favors the
Bears is the fact that they've been
playing together as a unit sincc the
start of the season, wiih only one
man among the substiti es having
seen more than a slight amount of
action.
DEAN SHIFTS MEN
Dean on the other hand has been
shifting men and positions around
continually in order to get a work
ing combination. Phil Zonne started
out as center, Bill Rapp at guard.
Zonne has since been shifted to for
ward, while Rapp has played every
position on the team. Tonight Stan
