# Student Asks Stanford's Aid In Migratory Drive
## 
### 
Joining the Stanford Relief Week j
drive to collect old clothing for
j California Migratory Workers, An
j dries Deinum, visiting student this
year from Holland, today discusses
problems behind the Drive in a let
i ter to the editor.
| The Drive Committee, chairman- ;
1 ned by Otis Brubaker, assistant in
j structor in political science, has
j spent this week touring living
groups in search of cast-off clothing.
The drive will close Monday.
Deinum's statement follows:
It is one of those amazing con
i trasts I noticed in the U.S., to re- j
] alize how no more than 100 miles
I from here thousands of Americans
j are starving, while California is i
such an extremely rich country
j with so many wealthy people living ,
I in it.
; SCORES INDIFFERENCE
| But still more amazing is the al
! most complete indifference of most
i Californians for these migratory
i workers in the San Joaquin Valley,
j The indifference usually is due to
ignorance. The horrible conditions
of these workers make headlines in
European newspapers, but not here.
Are Americans afraid to face facts?
I knew about the problem of
J migrant labor before 1 came here;
I I have been studying it ever since,
j and I am sorry to say that nothing
j has impressed me more in America
: than the spectacle of workers' camps
j in the valley. And it certainly was
j not a favorable impression! The
I conditions they live under are far
i worse than those of the people
■ with the lowest standards of living
j in eastern Europe, an authority
j wrote; and I do not doubt it, for
j they could not be any worse.
j The posters along your highways,

saying, "The American Way is the I
Best Way" become a farce in for- j
eign eyes. Why is there so little 1
done about this nameless and end- '
less misery?
People apparently do not want to
be disturbed by thoughts about
large-scale starvation and injustice.
But it is high time now that Stan
ford should be stirred up out of its
lethargy. The majority of students
on this campus seems to be glorious
ly unconscious of what is going on
under their very noses.
HELP WORKERS
This week they get a chance to do
what has been neglected for so long
a time, by giving all they can in
the drive for the migrant workers.
I hope this week will prove that
Stanford - democracy is not just a
phrase but a reality. Let the cam
pus show a little human solidarity!
There is very much needed in mate
rial things — almost everything is
lacking—but most of all is needed
the sympathy of the citizens of
California, instead of the unreason
able hatreds and misunderstandings
that exist now.
Furthermore, it should not be
forgotten that all this help is only
temporary and that we therefore
should unite and work to remove
the conditions that caused the mis
ery of the migrant workers and
other underprivileged. I am not
blaming anybody; I only want to
point out, however, that there must
be something wrong some place in
our social order, when things like
these can happen.
We should look to the future; that
is why I am suggesting now that
the Stanford Committee for Relief
of California Migratory Workers
should become permanent to prevent
the student body from falling socially
asleep again. Everything is yet to
be done in this field and Stanford
as one of California's major insti
tutions should not be behind.
The Stanford spirit could build a
huge bonfire in one day; I am sure
the same spirit will make a suc
cess of this drive. The passive
motto, "Live and let live" should be
changed forever in "Live and HELP
live."
And that means ACTION right,
now!
