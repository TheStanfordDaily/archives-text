# Boathouse Gets Final Touches
## 
### 
While John Leavers and his
crew of carpenters beat a
hasty retreat this week paint
ers and electricians moved
in to apply finishing touches
to the Farm's new boathouse.
Partitioning of the student
rooms, erection of a railing
around the sun porch, and
mounting of glass in the sec
ond-floor lounge was finished
as the carpenters relinquished
control. Painting and wiring
may occupy another week, it
was estimated yesterday.
