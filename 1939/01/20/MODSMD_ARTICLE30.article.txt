# All-U Boxing Champs Crowned Before 2000 Fans
## Greer Punches Out Decision; Wilber Victor 
### BILL RICHEY 
Stanford lias seen bigger crowds than (lie 2000 men and women who
witnessed the all-University boxing tourney in the Pavilion last night, hut
enthusiasm per fan reached a new high as the spectators went wild
time and again to applaud the work of the new Farm champions.
It was a pitched battle between the classes of '41 and '42 when Sopho-

more Bill Greer met and
Light-heavy Yank Levin in the
hottest match of the evening. It
takes a couple of amateur fighters
to give the fans action from the first
bell, and with frosh and soph root
ers screaming for their boys, Greer
and Levin kept their gloves flying
until the finish.
One of the biggest hands of the
evening went to the tumblers and
gymnasts on the parallel bars. On
the tumbling mat, Lomax Turner,
campus yell king, gave the audience
a laugh with a head-and-heels
landing, and Bill Granniss had the
house howling while waiting to see
which end came down first after a
somersault.
LIGHTER WEIGHT WINNERS
In the junior middleweight divi
sion, Bill Wilber took the decision
from Jim McCloud. Wilber's reach
and tight defense proved to be bet
ter than McCloud's rushing style
and in the frequent clinches the
winner's right uppercut helped turn
the tide.
Chuck Mclntyre's meeting with
Jack Rice in the welter class was
the narrowest decision of the meet.
A right-cross that seemed to slip
through Rice's guard brought Mc-
Intyre the title. A technical knock
out was scored when John Wilson
stopped Bob Hovey in the light
weight division.
A third-round show of speed and
punching gave Larry Winter the
nod over Bruce Berg in the feath
erweight class. Wayne Zook and
Larry Bell provided an unexpected
sensational bout in their bantam
weight light as the former captured
the crown in this class.
As an addition to the all-U tour
ney last night, Johnny Ward boxed
an exhibition match against Jim
Svercheck from the San Francisco
Olympic Club. Sharp, heavy punch
ing and quicker defense work mark
ed a contrast with the enthusiastic
but more ragged performances of
the tournament fighters.

ter than McCloud's rushing style
and in the frequent clinches the
winner's right uppercut helped turn
the tide.
Chuck Mclntyre's meeting with
Jack Rice in the welter class was
the narrowest decision of the meet.
A right-cross that seemed to slip
through Rice's guard brought Mc-
Intyre the title. A technical knock
out was scored when John Wilson
stopped Bob Hovey in the light
weight division.
A third-round show of speed and
punching gave Larry Winter the
nod over Bruce Berg in the feath
erweight class. Wayne Zook and
Larry Bell provided an unexpected
sensational bout in their bantam
weight light as the former captured
the crown in this class.
As an addition to the all-U tour
ney last night, Johnny Ward boxed
an exhibition match against Jim
Svercheck from the San Francisco
Olympic Club. Sharp, heavy punch
ing and quicker defense work mark
ed a contrast with the enthusiastic
but more ragged performances of
the tournament fighters.
Stanford lias seen bigger crowds than (lie 2000 men and women who
witnessed the all-University boxing tourney in the Pavilion last night, hut
enthusiasm per fan reached a new high as the spectators went wild
time and again to applaud the work of the new Farm champions.
It was a pitched battle between the classes of '41 and '42 when Sopho-

more Bill Greer met and
Light-heavy Yank Levin in the
hottest match of the evening. It
takes a couple of amateur fighters
to give the fans action from the first
bell, and with frosh and soph root
ers screaming for their boys, Greer
and Levin kept their gloves flying
until the finish.
One of the biggest hands of the
evening went to the tumblers and
gymnasts on the parallel bars. On
the tumbling mat, Lomax Turner,
campus yell king, gave the audience
a laugh with a head-and-heels
landing, and Bill Granniss had the
house howling while waiting to see
which end came down first after a
somersault.
LIGHTER WEIGHT WINNERS
In the junior middleweight divi
sion, Bill Wilber took the decision
from Jim McCloud. Wilber's reach
and tight defense proved to be bet
ter than McCloud's rushing style
and in the frequent clinches the
winner's right uppercut helped turn
the tide.
