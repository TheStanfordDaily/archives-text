# Frosh to Face Lowell Quintet
## 
### 
Rigged up with a brand new of- |
I fensive attack—a special system for
j Lowell High School and Sacramento
; Junior College, Stanford's frosh
j basketballers officially head into the
i toughest part of their cage schedule
' at 6:30 o'clock tonight and tomor
; row in the Pavilion.
It'll be something different for
j Lowell's classy cagers when they
| take the floor tonight. It'll be their
| first game this week, since Galileo
| failed to go through with a sched
j uled game after charges of proselyt-
J ing were hurled by four Bay city
i high schools this week.
Following the Lowell and Sacra
| mento games, a series of classy
games have been scheduled which
! will have the Card freshmen step-
I ping out into the hardest classes un-
I til they polish off their season with
i Cal's frosh, March 4.
Hustling with a completely intact
! line-up for the week-end tilts, the
J yearlings will attempt to shake the
Lowell quintet from the start with
the new offense. Coach H. B. Lee

changed the team's system this
week, and if the idea works as well
in the game as it has in practice
sessions, the invaders will have a
tough time on their hands trying to
figure out a way to stop the attack.
With their old system to fall back
on or shift to from time to time, the
yearlings may be able to stump the
invaders, which claims the best Bay
club and a ball-hawk who claims
to be a second Hank Luisetti and
| the best since Don Burness came
j out of the prep ranks.
Jack Calderwood, who assists both
| Lee and Coach Everett Dean with
| the frosh and varsity, devised the
new style of play. Lee is testing out
the idea, with the probability that
it will get a chance with the varsity
if it shows any possibilities against
I either invading club.
Lowell with its tall outfit and one
of the best defensive outfits in the
Bay circuit will be a logical lest for
| the system and Sacramento should
serve the purpose of polishing it
! Saturday night.

Rigged up with a brand new of- |
I fensive attack—a special system for
j Lowell High School and Sacramento
; Junior College, Stanford's frosh
j basketballers officially head into the
i toughest part of their cage schedule
' at 6:30 o'clock tonight and tomor
; row in the Pavilion.
It'll be something different for
j Lowell's classy cagers when they
| take the floor tonight. It'll be their
| first game this week, since Galileo
| failed to go through with a sched
j uled game after charges of proselyt-
J ing were hurled by four Bay city
i high schools this week.
Following the Lowell and Sacra
| mento games, a series of classy
games have been scheduled which
! will have the Card freshmen step-
I ping out into the hardest classes un-
I til they polish off their season with
i Cal's frosh, March 4.
Hustling with a completely intact
! line-up for the week-end tilts, the
J yearlings will attempt to shake the
Lowell quintet from the start with
the new offense. Coach H. B. Lee

changed the team's system this
week, and if the idea works as well
in the game as it has in practice
sessions, the invaders will have a
tough time on their hands trying to
figure out a way to stop the attack.
With their old system to fall back
on or shift to from time to time, the
yearlings may be able to stump the
invaders, which claims the best Bay
club and a ball-hawk who claims
to be a second Hank Luisetti and
| the best since Don Burness came
j out of the prep ranks.
