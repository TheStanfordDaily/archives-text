# Fund Drive History Told To Seniors
## 'Invest in Stanford' Selected as Motto; Alumni Head Speaks 
### 
To smooth the road for the An- |
nual Stanford Fund Drive, to which
senior class members will contrib- [
ute, the Senior Executive Council
last night was given the back
ground to the drive which this year
will be launched on the slogan: "In
vest in Stanford."
Speaking to council members was
Dave Jacobsen, assistant to Paul
Davis, alumni association head, who
sketched the history of Stanford
Associates, and the Annual Fund
Drive.
Comparative endowment figures of
Stanford and other large universi
ties rocked the council when it
learned that, while in 1903 Stanford
ied all universities in endowment,
at the present time its position is
tenth. In that period of time, such
universities as Harvard, once be
low Stanford, have increased en
dowment funds nearly 100 per cent.
STANFORD TRADEMARK
"Stanford gives you a trade
mark," Jacobsen said, "which you
carry with you the rest of your life.
An investment in Stanford will pre
serve that trademark, preserve its
meaning."
As a companion phrase to the
association's battle cry, Jacobsen
pointed out that every contributed
dollar equals $25 in endowment.
Further, in outlining the debt which
students owe to the university,
Davis told council members that
they were paying only 45 per cent of
the cost of their education. The re
mainder is paid by the university,
through endowment and other
sources.
Though the drive will not start
until spring quarter, Jacobsen
spoke to the council to give it the
history of the appeal, said that such
information was being given to all
other university classes in an at
tempt to build up familiarity with
the needs of Stanford.
TENTATIVE ACTIVITIES
Setting forth tentative plans for
opening senior activities in winter
and spring quarters, Class President
Dave Ryus broached the subject of
a Senior Promenade and a "Back
to the Farm" dance, asked for com
ments or suggestions. As described
by Ryus, the Promenade would go
back to previous years, would con
sist of a class gathering in Union
Court after dinner, early in spring
quarter, an hour of music, followed
by a Promenade down the Quad,
around Memorial Court, and end
ing with the singing of the hymn
before Memorial Church.
As for the "Back to the Farm"
dance, tentatively set for March 10,
calculated to take the place of the
more formal Senior Prom, criticism
was raised that the prom would lose
the place which it has heretofore
taken in campus dance activities.
Action was deferred on both
suggestions until the next meeting,
to be held within the next two
weeks.

Stanford and other large universi
ties rocked the council when it
learned that, while in 1903 Stanford
ied all universities in endowment,
at the present time its position is
tenth. In that period of time, such
universities as Harvard, once be
low Stanford, have increased en
dowment funds nearly 100 per cent.
STANFORD TRADEMARK
"Stanford gives you a trade
mark," Jacobsen said, "which you
carry with you the rest of your life.
An investment in Stanford will pre
serve that trademark, preserve its
meaning."
As a companion phrase to the
association's battle cry, Jacobsen
pointed out that every contributed
dollar equals $25 in endowment.
Further, in outlining the debt which
students owe to the university,
Davis told council members that
they were paying only 45 per cent of
the cost of their education. The re
mainder is paid by the university,
through endowment and other
sources.
Though the drive will not start
until spring quarter, Jacobsen
spoke to the council to give it the
history of the appeal, said that such
information was being given to all
other university classes in an at
tempt to build up familiarity with
the needs of Stanford.
TENTATIVE ACTIVITIES
Setting forth tentative plans for
opening senior activities in winter
and spring quarters, Class President
Dave Ryus broached the subject of
a Senior Promenade and a "Back
to the Farm" dance, asked for com
ments or suggestions. As described
by Ryus, the Promenade would go
back to previous years, would con
sist of a class gathering in Union
Court after dinner, early in spring
quarter, an hour of music, followed
by a Promenade down the Quad,
around Memorial Court, and end
ing with the singing of the hymn
before Memorial Church.
As for the "Back to the Farm"
dance, tentatively set for March 10,
calculated to take the place of the
more formal Senior Prom, criticism
was raised that the prom would lose
the place which it has heretofore
taken in campus dance activities.
Action was deferred on both
suggestions until the next meeting,
to be held within the next two
weeks.
To smooth the road for the An- |
nual Stanford Fund Drive, to which
senior class members will contrib- [
ute, the Senior Executive Council
last night was given the back
ground to the drive which this year
will be launched on the slogan: "In
vest in Stanford."
Speaking to council members was
Dave Jacobsen, assistant to Paul
Davis, alumni association head, who
sketched the history of Stanford
Associates, and the Annual Fund
Drive.
