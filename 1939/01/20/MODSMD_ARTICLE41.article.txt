# The 						Snowball Rolls

WHILE Maurice Knox has scoured Toyon and
Branner for home-loving diners, men who
may next year eat their meals in Branner's slick
and well-nigh unscratched Dining Hall, Encina
still remains a field untouched. Yet, within its
battered walls are nearly 250 men eligible to
move into Stanford's upper-class dormitories
next year. And when they do, they will also
move into the time-worn dining problem which
scatters over half the hall residents far and wide
at meal times.
The answer is obvious in view of the move
ment already half completed to open the Bran
ner Dining Hall. Within Encina are enough men
looking forward to the inconvenience of "eating
around" to fill the petition many times over.
Nor is Encina the only field left untouched.
Now living off-campus are men who next year
will move into Toyon or Branner. They can
make the margin of safety which officials de
mand.
These men, freshmen and upper classmen,
will next year face the same problem which
now has prompted over 100 Hall residents to
petition for a dining hall. But unless immediate
action comes from those potentially in the same
water-logged boat as the men who already have
signed, the chance will be gone, and gone for
some years to come if past history is any
example.
Toyon and Branner have done their part; it
behooves next year's residents to look ahead,
add their weight to what already has been done.
There are enough of them in Encina and off
campus to swing back the Dining Hall doors.
They need only sign on the dotted line.
