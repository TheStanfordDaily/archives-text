# Not Only Old Clothes
## 
### 
ALTHOUGH the Stanford Relief Committee
has been canvassing the campus for the
past three days in praiseworthy search of old
clothes, it is not by old clothes, nor is it by
pamphlets such as Josn Steinbeck's "Their
Blood Is Strong," that California's migratory
labor problem will be solved. Both are ideal
istic, Mr. Steinbeck's book painfully so, but nei
ther can do much long-range good.
The only thing both can achieve is the thing
exchange student Andries Deinum hopes to see
ihem achieve—an awakening of public opinion,
both on the campus and elsewhere, to the state's
most serious problem.
If that public opinion can be awakened, and
if it can make itself felt where it will do the
most good—in the city of Washington, D.C.—
then a solution may eventually be reached.
For in the last analysis, it is in the city of
Washington, D.C., that the answer will be found.
Bad though the problem was before, it could
have been handled by the state. It is only since
the Farm Resettlement Administration took a
hand that its present desperate condition has
developed.
It is the FRA which has lowered relief rates
in the Dust Bowl. It is the FRA which has raised
them in California. It is the FRA which has
-dragged migrant workers half-way across the
continent into a state which doesn't want them,
and to which they didn't want to go. It is the
enlightened FRA which solves the ill-housing
of one-third of a nation by building corrugated
iron houses at Farmersville in the middle of the
San Joaquin Valley, where temperatures aver
age over 100 degrees all summer. It is the FRA
which proposes to usher in a new day by over
loading the relief rolls of a state which is al
ready one of the two or three most burdened in
the country.
Until an aroused public opinion strikes back
at this haphazard policy from Washington, the
migratory worker problem will remain un
solved. Until tongue-in-the-cheek social plan
ning stops, no one is going to get anywhere
with it. Until a little less theory and a little
more sanity are applied, it is going to remain
a dead weight—a dangerous dead weight—on
the government and the people of California.—
