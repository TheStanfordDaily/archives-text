# Bear Hunt Again
## 
### 
THEIR status at the present time is a 50-50
business, but when Stanford's five varsity
hoopmen take to the hardwood floor tonight
against Cal their chances to stay near the top
of the conference will be determined.
Last Friday night, with the crowd behind
them, the basketball team ran circles around
the Trojan; Saturday night, the wise old audi
ence knew it couldn't happen again, saw S.C.
look like Luisetti and Co.
Tomorrow night, the team is up against Cal
and already Stanford is groaning over its loss.
"Jeez, if we only had Hank again this year," is
a fond wish incapable of fulfillment, with re
gard to tomorrow's game.

And in the face of that circumstance, it is not
fare to make comparisons with last year's team
and then gripe about it. It's not fair to the new
team; it's not fair to Stanford's new coach.
What's more to the point is for Stanford to
remember it's up against the Berkeley Bear
tomorrow night, that the team needs all the
support the Farm can give it.
After the game, Bear and Indian will join
hands and dance at the Junior Jamboree in the
Women's Gym.
A fine idea, for friendly rivals; but it doesn't
alter the fact that Stanford needs a change in
attitude toward its team, that the team needs the
support, and that Bear meat hamburgers would
be good for refreshments at the dance.â€”H. L. S.
