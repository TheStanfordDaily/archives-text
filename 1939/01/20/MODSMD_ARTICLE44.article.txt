# BULL SESSION
## AXE THE MAN WHO OWNS ONE 
### JOHN COBBS 
O ne of the sure signs of a slack week is a little
crackpot tempest over the question of automobiles
on the campus; history shows that the .student mind
takes a workout with the subject only when deans are
behaving themselves and Roble women have managed
to light off their customary hysteria. According to this
standard, the past week has been as dull as a presi
dent's reception.
Recently several Campus Opinion letters have com
bined with assorted bull sessions to create a gentle
ripple of comment that might, by a liberal interpre
tation of the word, be called a species of clamor.
Opinion varies, but the more vocal debaters seem to
think that the automobile is a Menace on wheels, that
threatens the ideals of our pioneer ancestors.

Two main arguments against the automobile have
risen. The first holds that it is undemocratic, because
it enables the propertied gentry to make better time,
both geographically and socially, than the dismounted
cavaliers. The second objection is that automobiles
are bringing Stanford into contact with the gross outer
world, shattering its quiet rural peace.
Personally, I find it hard to work up any rise in
blood pressure over the car situation. Throughout my
Stanford career I have trudged up and down the Row,
avoiding the Dcke house where water bags are thrown
with manners and aim that are equally bad. But I
have never felt the surge of revolutionary resent
ment. Still, I too find it a slack week.
CO FAR the arguments presented against automo
k biles have been mere logical lacework. The democ
racy theory is simply an approved way of expressing
jealousy. It is the traditional howl of the have-nots.
But even the loudest equalitarians bog down when ihey
try to explain how taking a car from one man can
cure the blisters on another's feet.
The back-to-nature argument is no better. It is
very probable that without cars the Stanford stu
dents would remain on the campus. But there is no
reason for believing that they would be better and
finer men for staying. In fact, it is likely that if the
students were forced to stay home they would have
to think up new amusements. And the dean's office
will tell you that most things.that are amusing are
immoral. It is better to stick to the evils we know.
Stanford may not like the idea but it is not her
metically sealed from the rest of the world. The old
days of pastoral isolation are over, and we can't legis
late them back into existence. We might as well try
abolishing electric lights because candles are more
flattering. Stanford has adjusted to the new system,
and if we went back to the old, all we would get would
be sore feet.
Besides, if we abolish cars, how the devil am I go
ing to borrow one?
