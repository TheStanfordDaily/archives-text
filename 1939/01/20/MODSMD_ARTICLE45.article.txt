# Lightly. . . And Politely

Once I read a column which started out with some
thing about "my deadline is 45 minutes ago so I
guess I'll have to hurry."
Which means that, among other things, I can't
even get an original lead for my column today. Be
sides, my deadline is only 39 minutes ago.
Some people say I have a permanent deadline. It
starts at my neck.
And runs either way.

The gals in one of the sororities felt the same way
about one of their inshees (luring the last rushing
period.
In that house—in all houses, for all I know—
they use black marbles for black-balling un
wanted Roblcitcs. And once when the freshman
women were up, one of them found one of these
marbles in the living room.
She picket! i( up and looked at it for a minute.
"Why, this looks just like a black marble," she
said.
Yes, il is a black marble, they told her.
"What is it doing in your living room?"
They had a hard time explaining to her that
the sisters had a strange fondness for playing
marble games at night. With little black marbles.

And one of our Farm professors undoubtedly had
something of the same thing in mind about one of
his students the other day.
This student had had an afternoon seminar with
the prof, and after il was over he had gone to the
Cellar.
The prof came into the Cellar shortly after and
saw him.
"Oh, are you still awake?" the ptuf asked him.

I just had a brief and fiery argument with a
guy about whether he was or was not in love
spring quarter, and whether—in either case—lie
did or did not comb his hair during that period.
I say lie was and didn't.
lie says he was and did.
It was probably the most ridiculous argument I
have ever had.

The best spring quarter I ever had was back in the
early twenties. Only we didn't call it "spring quarter"
then. We just called it "spring."
I was very much in love.
With a girl in my first grade class. Her name was
Betty.
One week an old, tent Chautauqua was playing
across the street from our school. Some days it would
have matinees.
I sat in the back seat at one side of the room. She
sat in thi' back seat at the other side. When the class
would get a little dull I used to lean way back in
my seat and yell across the room: "Ya going to the
Chautauqua after school?"
"Yeah. Are you."
"Yeah."
And we would both go to the Chautauqua after
school.
But we never went together.
