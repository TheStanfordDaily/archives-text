# War Movie Shows Life Of Dawn Patrol
## 
### 
"The Dawn Patrol, playing at the
Stanford Theater.
This sort of film is always diffi
cult to review. Everyone knows
what to expect before he goes, neat
ly uniformed chaps who seem to do
nothing but give orders and take
orders with stiff upper lips, men in

b arrack rooms
drinking reckless
ly in face of im
minent death,
shots of planes
charging head
long into the sec
ond seat, fourth
row in the bal
cony firing a rain
jf machine - gun
bullets at the au
dience — and we
must not forget
the pale, teenish
lad who shows

the white feather just before the at
tack and thus accentuates the stern
er stuff of the hero who reassures
him with a good-humored pat on
the back designed to put the flunky
on his feet in time to get killed for
the next scene. Yet, despite the in
evitable cliches, the picture is good
entertainment. It has Basil Rath
bone, who has yet to turn in a bad
performance despite flimsy roles. It
has Errol Flynn and a chap by the
name of David Niven who is des
tined to become more and more
popular as his roles increase.
At any rate, the picture repre
sents an interesting change since
"All Quiet on the Western Front."
"The Dawn Patrol" is a confused
mixture of the romantic and the
realistic attitude toward war. We
feel that it wants to be romantic
but its conscience tells it to be
realistic. The result is that the
characters play lip service to their
consciences and then run off and
have a merry time. Perhaps Pvlu
nich has revealed that there has been
too much pacifism in the last dec
ade. Too many sissies who do not
want to fight are being produced
by it and it is time we turned back
to produicng he-men again. After
all, with a billion and a half dollar
arms budget, we will have to find
somebody to fly the darned crates.

realistic. The result is that the
characters play lip service to their

have a merry time. Perhaps Pvlu

too much pacifism in the last dec

want to fight are being produced
by it and it is time we turned back
to produicng he-men again. After
all, with a billion and a half dollar
arms budget, we will have to find
somebody to fly the darned crates.
