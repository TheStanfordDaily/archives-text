### 
In one of the most active sessions
of the year, the Stanford Political
Union voted 40 1o 25 last night, in
support of the proposition: "That
sororities should be abandoned on
the campus."
With a large gallery of non-union
members gathered to hear the dis
cussion, Ellen Douglas, guest, speak
er from Lagunita, opened the case
for the affirmative, and Betty Kline
replied for the sororities.
Arguments in favor of the reso
lution rested on the view that
sororities were undemocratic and
prejudiced in their system of rush
ing; that as units they represented
nothing more than small snobbish
pressure groups, destroying any pos
sibility of building a single tradi
tion among Stanford women.
Members of the opposition, how
ever, took the stand that the sorori
ties themselves were not to blame
for the so-called present inequality
between hall and sorority women.
Insisting that only in the close
associations of the houses could be
found the necessary balance be
tween academic and non-academic
life, the proposition was put for
ward that more sororities, and not
their abandonment, would solve the
problem.
In this way all women could en
joy the atmosphere of these living
groups, instead of a limited few.
