# Fair to Employ Stanford Men
## Seeks Farm Alumni With Sales Ability 
### 
Students graduating this year and j
seeking employment in the Bay Re- j
gion will be at a great advantage.
This is the prediction of Miss Ruth
Tracksell of the Appointment Serv- j
ice.
This year should be a peak year
for local business, and in addition
to the generally favorable employ
ment conditions for recent graduates,
the Exposition itself will engage
many college men.
At present at the Appointment
Service there is an unusual demand
for graduates, particularly those
trained in engineering and distri
bution, from the Classes of '36, '37,
and '38. There have been calls for
approximately 140 employees.
'SALES PERSONALITY'
"Stanford alumni will not be em
ployed selling pop-corn or hot dogs
at the Fair," remarked Miss Track
sell, "but employed, rather, by
large industrial exhibitors. How
ever, the man sought by these em
ployers is the man with a 'sales
personality'."
Most of the positions arc for dem
onstrators, usually requiring tech
nical acquaintance within certain
fields. Women will be employed as
information secretaries. Salaries for
these Exposition jobs range from
$85 to $150.
MAY BE PERMANENT
i Calls in Miss Tracksell's office re
cently have been from International
Business Machines Corporation, E. I.
DuPont DeNemours and Co., Inc.,
Ford Motor Co., Pan American Air
ways, Exhibit in the Hall of Science,
and Columbia Steel.
According to Miss Tracksell, there
is about a 50 per cent chance that
the employment will be permanent,
depending, of course, upon the in
dividual case.
