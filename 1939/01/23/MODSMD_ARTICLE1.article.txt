### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
JJARK days for Germany came in
the years immediately follow
ing the Great War. Morally defeat
ed and economically spent, the
Reich nearly committed financial
suicide with a program of hog-wild
inflation, a futile attempt to save the
nation's crumbling monetary sys
tem.
When you went to buy the day's
groceries, you had to take a fair
sized cart with you to carry the
huge pile of paper money it took to
pay for them. Postage stamps cost
one trillion marks then, but those
days are gone forever—maybe.
Saturday Ilerr Hitler stuck his
finger in Gcrnianys' financial pie
and pulled out Itcichsbank Presi
dent I)r. Iljalmar Schacht; not
only did be pull him out, but he
gave him bis walking papers, too.
Replacing the conscrvat ve Dr.
Schacht is der Fuehrer's minister
of economics, Walter Funk, whose
ideas seem to swing decidedly in
favor of inflation.
Cetrain it is that the conservative
element of the Reichsbank, Schacht
and his two chief assistants, have
been given the well known Hitler
treatment, and the financial future
of Germany lies hot in the hands of
der schoener Adolf's stooges.
Whether or not inflation will
come, whether or not the mark will
drop again to an infinite figure, re
mains to be seen. But the fact re
mains that another of the Reich's
few sane policies is gone.

jyjELODRAMATIC conceptions
1 of the next war by Sunday
supplement artists are almost com
ing true today in Barcelona. A
circle of concrete and steel trench
es around (he capital of Repub
lican Spain was supposed to in
sure the Loyalists against defeat,
but their troops were about as ef
fective as the Mills badminton
team against the smashing Insur
gent drive.

All business, except war indus
tries, has been suspended in Barce
lona, every able-bodied man is
fighting at the front while the wom
en commandeer supplies and dig
trenches, and all the while Franco's
planes are peppering the city with
death.
The Loyalists' plan to abandon
Barcelona and escape to Valencia
by sea has been frustrated by an
Insurgent naval blockade, as threat
ening on the water as Franco's
HOO.OOO are on land. And so the capi
tal of the gasping Republican gov
ernment is doomed to attempt to
withstand a seigc, which is pretty
stiff punishment to take under the
conditions of modem warfare.
It looks like the Insurgents aren't
going to need a Trojan horse.

SOCIALIZED medicine recently
1 has become little more than
the favorite topic of high school
debating societies, but today it
|M>ps into the news again. For to
day President Roosevelt is expect
ed to request Congress to make a
special appropriation for a 10-
year national health program,
which is to receive support from
both state and federal treasuries.
Provision of free medical care for
the man who can't pay doctor bills
is the main object of the scheme,
but anti-New Dealers will have no
trouble finding a place for it in their
little lists of Roosevelt's over-en
thusiastic expenditures.

CROSS the Atlantic again, Pre
mier Mussolini yesterday in
formed a bunch of open-mouthed
Italian peasants that Italy's enemies
are too dumb to be worth worrying
over.
Addressing a group of prize-win
ning farmers, II Duce announced,
for the benefit of a listening inter
national press, I hat. he isn't fooling
around when he threatens France
and that Italian diplomatic adver
saries are all goons.
