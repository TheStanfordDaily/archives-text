### 
Warning that America must em
phasize the development and educa
tion of youth rather than the sup
port of the aged and infirm, Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur spoke be
fore the Portland, Ore., Junior
Chamber of Commerce Saturday
night on "Grandfather vs. Grandson
in America Today."
Pointing to the "current battle
between youth and old age for the
tax dollar," he said that "we must
make way for our boys and girls
even though they have not the po
litical power of the aged."
MUST EMPHASIZE YOUTH
"If this nation," he said, "gives
social security priority and makes
it the main objective, it will inevi
tably undei'go considerable degen
eration. With the best of heart for
the care of the sick and infirm and
the aged, we must still reserve our
main emphasis and support for
youth in order that they may have
full opportunity and may develop
independence.
"Some of us hope that the organ
ized political power of the older
members of our society will not re
sult in a contraction of the privi
leges and opportunities given our
boys and girls."
Citing the decline in the influence
of the home on children, President
Wilbur challenged society to volun
teer its service in developing youth.
AGED MAY SERVE
"In the discussion of old age pen
sions we seem to have forgotten the
possible service which the mature
can give to our form of society. If
we begin to view old age as a period
of parasitism, we will lose the very
finest forces of our civilization.
There is just as much opportunity
for many of our old people to ren
der service as there is for youth."
Declaring that America may ex
pect a period of expansion in its
school systems to extend educational
opportunities up to the period of
about 20 to 21 years of age, Dr.
Wilbur pointed out. that the princi
pal problem facing education is to
provide personal, vocational, and
educational guidance and a wider
opportunity for vocational train
ing.
"Before long," he said, "we will
have to go at this problem from the
standpoint of giving young people
both training and opportunity,
rather than to take the easy method
of extending relief."
