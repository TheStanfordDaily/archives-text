# 'Fanny Elssler' Disappointing
## Dance Scenes Prove 'Badly Out-of-place' 
### FRANCES SLATER 
Despite a title which held prom
ise of such dandy things, "Fanny
Elssler" turned out to be so much
fancy-dress tripe. "Fanny Elssler,"
presented last night in Memorial
Hall, was second in a series of Sun
day night movies.
Several dances by the Fanny Elss
ler troupe set in the court of Met
ternich were designed to relieve the
tension of a labyrinthine plot to keep
the son of Napoleon off the French
throne. The dances proved highly
ill-informed.
In one sequence, a group of male
dancers, one of whom was distinctly
noted to be off-side, squatted in line
formation and sniffed at Fanny's
Javanese skirt. In another, some
Austrian prototypes of the Ritz
brothers in batik B.V.D.'s thumbed
their noses at Fanny as she twirled
by. And in still a third, Fanny
danced the fandango, clad only in
the briefest and scrubbiest of lamp
shades. All this, of course, took place
in the court of Metternich.
Meanwhile, a hot-house amour
sprouted between Fanny (Lillian
Harvey) and the son of Napoleon.
Most of tho house agreed that Fanny
was a little peaked for a woman of
destiny.
