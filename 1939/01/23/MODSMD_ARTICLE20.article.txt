# 'Stagers' Name Now Ramshead
## Return of Plaque Brings Title Change 
### 
With the return of the long lost
sheep to the fold—the Ramshead
plaque—Stagers yesterday awarded
Phi Kappa Sigma and French House
top honors for Gaieties work, and
simultaneously changed its own
name from Stagers to Ramshead.
Pending of the new
name by Ex Committee, Stagers—
or now Ramshead—returned to the
name of a former student dramatics
association because "it had more
tradition," according to President
J. P. Cahn. The original name
"Stagers" was given to the joint
group formed by last year's merger
of Ramshead, Barnstormers, Masqu
ers, and Sword and Sandals.
Prize awards for Gaieties con
tributions were made on the basis
of general aid to the production,
number of persons participating in
Gaieties — considered proportion
ately to size of the group those per
sons represented.
Tri-Delt and Encina were close
seconds in the award, Cahn said.
Names of the two winning organiza
tions will be inscribed on the two
plaques which will be hung in the
lobby of Memorial Hall. The awards
will be continued in subsequent
years.
History of the missing Ramshead
plaque is somewhat obscure. Last
fall it was found to be missing, did
not turn up until this quarter, when
a San Francisco band leader pre
sented it lo a "mystery woman."
After another week of hiding, the
plaque, at latest reports, is finally
in Ramshead's hands.
