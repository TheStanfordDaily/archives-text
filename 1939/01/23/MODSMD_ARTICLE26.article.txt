# Frosh, Sophs To Hold Debate
## Evils of Fraternity System to Be Argued 
### 
What are the evils of the frater
nity system, and to what extent do
they justify its abolition?
These are two phases of the frosh
soph debate on "Resolved, that fra
ternities should be abolished," which
the affirmative team, composed of
Sophomores Walt Stoessel, Milton
Marks, Jr., and Hugh O'Donnell, is
expected to bring out. The fresh
men, George Jackson, Roger Boas,
and Bob Hammett, will probably
draw conclusions formulated dur
ing the period of rushing, from
which they recently emerged.
This debate, to be held Thursday
evening at 8 o'clock in the audi
torium of the Education building, is
being sponsored by Delta Sigma
Rho, honorary forensic fraternity.
Formal challenge for this year's
tilt was issued to the freshman class
as a whole by Walt Stoessel, Phi
Delt, at the Encina smoker last
week. The frosh accepted through
George Jackson and sides were de
termined. Teams were elected by
(he respective class debate teams.
Following the actual debate, Bob
Curtis, chairman and president of
Delta Sigma Rho, will announce a
question period similar to that con
ducted on the Town Hall of the
Air program.
