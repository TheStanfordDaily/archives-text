# Dr. Anderson To Give Talk Tonight, 7:30
## 
### 
Professor Frederick Anderson of
the Romanic language department
will speak on the topic, "Whom
Shall We Trust" in the auditorium
of the Education building tonight
at 7:30 o'clock.
This will be the third address in
the Philosophy of Propaganda se
ries sponsored by the philosophy
department.
In contrast to the two preceding
discussions, which differentiated
between education and propaganda,
Professor Anderson will deal with
the question of the trustworthiness
of sources of knowledge both in
the field of science and human af
fairs.
The professor's primary aim will
be to emphasize the fact that most
of. our knowledge is based on
authority with the resulting need of
a sound basis for the appraisal of
these authorities.
This will lead to a consideration
of methods for deciding who can be
trusted in science, and whom the
public can rely on in the field of
world affairs.
In completing this series of lec
tures, Professors Henry Lanz and
John Reid of the philosophy de
partment are scheduled to speak
during the next two weeks.
