# F.D.R. Fights To Restore Slashed Funds
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UP). â€”
The administration tonight opened
a last ditch light to restore to the
$725,000,000 relief bill the $150,000,-
000 slashed out by the House, with
a warning from Sen. Robert F. Wag
ner, D., N.Y., the cut would threat
en the current business revival.
He said the bill ; issed by the
House and revised by the Senate
Appropriations Committee would
force more than 1,000,000 off relief
rolls and private industry would not
be able to absorb more than half of
them.
Recalling the recession that fol
lowed curtailment of government
spending in October, 1936, Wagner
cautioned Congress against making
the same mistake again, saying it
"would be a form of national eco
nomic suicide."
Wagner's warning came as the
Senate prepared to .take up the re
lief bill, probably within 48 hours.
It will be the first Senate test of
the economy move in the House.
"The outcome of the fight was in
doubt tonight. A coalition of con
servative Democrats and Republic
ans is confident the lower relief
appropriation will be accepted in the
upper chamber. The appropria
tions committee approved it by a
vote of 17 to 7 yesterday.
