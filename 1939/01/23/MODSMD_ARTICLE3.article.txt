NEH 10KK, Jan. 22 (UP). —The Standard Oil tanker Esso Baytown
ploughed through the storm-lashed Atlantie tonight to bring to medical
aid ten survivors of the wrecked Imperial Airways flying boat Cavalier
which sank at sea .'{oo miles oil the Jersey coast Saturday.
At least one of the survivors—Captain M. It. Alderson, pilot of the
flying boat—was believed to be in critical condition, according to radio

messages from the rescue vessel.*
A rising gale was expected to de
lay the arrival of the Esso Baytown
until after dawn tomorrow, instead
of around midnight tonight as was
previously expected.
SEARCH FOR MISSING
Meanwhile the Coast Guard cutter
Champlain reported search for three
remaining persons, who were aboard
the big flying boat when it was
forced down, would be abandoned at
nightfall unless it found some trace
of them.
The story of the rescue of the ten
survivors—five men and five women
—was supplied by the master of the
Esso Baytown, Captain Frank Spurr,
in a radio message to the Standard
Oil Company here.
The Esso Baytown, after once
missing the cluster of floating hu
mans, returned to the spot where
they were found an hour before
midnight last night and heard the
voices of men over the wind
whipped ocean.
HEARD VOICES
"While proceeding to one of the
positions (of the lost plane) given
by radio," Captain Spurr reported,
"at. 10:30 p.m. the voices of survivors
were heard.
'"Number one lifeboat, in charge
of Chief Officer Anderson, found the
survivors in rubber life belts and
took them into the life boat, bring
ing them alongside and they were
safely taken on board.
"All survivors able to travel by
motor car. Five men, five women
require overcoats, shoes, trousers for
temporary transfer. Suggest vessel
be moored alongside suitable dock
for motor car transfer.
"Signed, Spurr."
STORY OF RESCUE
Behind this message was the story
—told by survivors, radio messages
and official reports—of one of the
most dramatic rescues ever made
at sea.
One lifeboat, crawling over the
mountainous waves in the dead of
night with only the faint cries of the
drifting men and women to guide
them, was overturned by a wave
and another rescue crew had to pull
them in.
The rescue was accomplished in
weather so heavy that an hour later
the U.S. gunboat Erie, which raced
to the side of Esso Baytown, was
unable to put a doctor aboard the
tanker.*

STORY OF RESCUE
Behind this message was the story
—told by survivors, radio messages
and official reports—of one of the
most dramatic rescues ever made
at sea.
One lifeboat, crawling over the
mountainous waves in the dead of
night with only the faint cries of the
drifting men and women to guide
them, was overturned by a wave
and another rescue crew had to pull
them in.
The rescue was accomplished in
weather so heavy that an hour later
the U.S. gunboat Erie, which raced
to the side of Esso Baytown, was
unable to put a doctor aboard the
tanker.*
NEH 10KK, Jan. 22 (UP). —The Standard Oil tanker Esso Baytown
ploughed through the storm-lashed Atlantie tonight to bring to medical
aid ten survivors of the wrecked Imperial Airways flying boat Cavalier
which sank at sea .'{oo miles oil the Jersey coast Saturday.
At least one of the survivors—Captain M. It. Alderson, pilot of the
flying boat—was believed to be in critical condition, according to radio

messages from the rescue vessel.*
A rising gale was expected to de
lay the arrival of the Esso Baytown
until after dawn tomorrow, instead
of around midnight tonight as was
previously expected.
SEARCH FOR MISSING
Meanwhile the Coast Guard cutter
Champlain reported search for three
remaining persons, who were aboard
the big flying boat when it was
forced down, would be abandoned at
nightfall unless it found some trace
of them.
The story of the rescue of the ten
survivors—five men and five women
—was supplied by the master of the
Esso Baytown, Captain Frank Spurr,
in a radio message to the Standard
Oil Company here.
The Esso Baytown, after once
missing the cluster of floating hu
mans, returned to the spot where
they were found an hour before
midnight last night and heard the
voices of men over the wind
whipped ocean.
