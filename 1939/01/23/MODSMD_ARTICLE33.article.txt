# Survey Shows 1398 Students Employed
## 
### 
According to statistics recently compiled at the Registrar's olTice, 33.5fi
per cent of Stanford's total enrollment is employed.
"These figures," Dr. Mitchell qualified, "present only a partial pic
ture of the student employment. There is no method by which an
accurate survey of employment could be made."

Two considerations which should'
be taken into account in interpret
ing the data are that the figures are
based only on (1) employment se
cured through Stanford's Employ
ment Service, and (2) employment
which was secured through that of
fice last quarter.
At any rate these statistics show
that the percentage of men em
ployed is much greater than that of
women. The total percentage of
men employed is 43, of women, 11.
Twenty-three per cent of the 1263
men employed earn under 50 per
cent of their expenses, and 17 per
cent earn between 50 and 100 per
cent of their expenses.
Six per cent of the total enrolment
of women earn under 50 per cent of
their expenses; 3 per cent earn be
tween 50 and 100 per cent of their
expenses. In numbers there are 135
women, or slightly over 11 per cent
of the total enrolment of women
employed.
Three hundred eight men and 38
women earn more than 75 per cent
of their expenses.
"If there were any way in which
we could estimate the private em-
I ployment of students, the percent
: age of employment would undoubt
[ edly be much higher," remarked
Dr. Mitchell.
