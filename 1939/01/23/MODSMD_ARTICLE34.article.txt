### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (UP).— j
President Roosevelt may not ask j
Congress for a renewal of his power i
to fix the price of domestically mined
silver when the authorization expires
on June 30, it was reported semi
officially tonight.
The reports first gained circulation |
last Friday when Mr. Roosevelt i
omitted any reference to the silver J
program in asking Congress for a i
two-year extension of his power to j
devalue the gold content of the dol- j
lar and for continuation of the j
$2,000,000,000 currency stabilization i
fund.
The price - fixing authority was !
vested in' the President under the j
1934 Gold Reserve Act and was in- j
tended to provide an indirect sub- '
sidy to domestic producers in an j
attempt to rehabilitate the industry. I
