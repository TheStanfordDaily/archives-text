HENDAYE, Franco-Spanish Fron

stores and business places in Cata
lonia tonight were closed by decree
with the exception of war industries
as five Insurgent army corps smashed
to within 16 miles of Barcelona's bar
ricaded streets.
The roar of Generalissimo Fran
cisco Franco's guns blasting the last
remaining fortifications around the
city echoed through Barcelona in in
creasing volume. Squadrons of
bombers dumped tons of explosives
on the capital as they swept upon it
in relays, at almost half-hour in
tervals.
Loyalist resistance was said to have
halted the Insurgents along the main
Igualada-Barcelona highway at Cas
telloli Pass, seven miles east of
Igualada, a manufacturing town
which Insurgents said had been left
on fire and in partial ruins by the
retreating Loyalists.
Both southern columns were with
in artillery range of the Llobregat
river, the last fortifications protect
ing the city.
