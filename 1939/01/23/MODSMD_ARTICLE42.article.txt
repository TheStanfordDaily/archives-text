# Bears Dump Indian Cagers
## Captain Phil Zonne Stars for Stanford 
### 
Stanford's basketball team played
one conference* game last week-end,
and slipped down a notch in the
league standings.
The Golden Bears from Berkeley
way dropped into the Pavilion to
chat a while, and departed with a
45-29 victory over the Indians.
It was all very friendly, just a
good old-fashioned family brawl
with no holds barred. No one was

1 really very angry. The boys were
\ only hipping and slapping each
I other in the spirit of good clean
fun.
But the Bears were the bigger,
so they stomped off with the verdict.
STANFORD OUTCLASSED
Coach Nibs Price's quintet was
the better outfit by far, in playing
! basketball, and Stanford's chief
; consolation was that at one time it
1 led the visitors, 9-8, early in the
(first half, and that it drew up with
-1 in four points, 24-20, in the second
I half after trailing 21-13 at half
j time.
Even in defeat Captain Phil Zonne
j played a great game for Stanford.
1 Phil couldn't locate the bucket, but
j he rebounded sensationally, fighting
j it out himself on even terms with
' Bill Ogilve, Bill Biggerstaff and Bob
Chalmers, the three Cal giants.
] CHALMERS HITS HIGH MARK
j Chalmers popped 11 points in the
I first half and then sank a one-
I hander a single second before the
| final gun sounded to take high
point honors with 13 digits. Don
j Burness scored 11, Chalmers' last
i second basket robbing him of a
high-point tie.
! Saturday night, reserves saw the
greater amount of action as the In
dians scored a double win over San
Francisco State, 39-29, and Univer
' sity of Mexico, 48-31.
