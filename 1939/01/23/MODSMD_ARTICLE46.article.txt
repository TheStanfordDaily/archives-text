# Card Swim Stars Win In Fairmont Classic
## 
### 
Churning the water with speed
and precision, two Stanford swim
mers chalked up easy pre-season
victories Friday night at the Fair
mont Terrace Plunge in the annual
A.A.U. Senior and Junior 50-yard
events.
Paul Herron, Card frosh, and
Roy Vitousek, headliner on last
year's yearling swim team, .showed
their heels to competition in their
respective events to garner two
trophies for the Thornton-coached
entrants.
Both victories were unofficial
wins for Stanford, however, for
both men were swimming unat
tached.
WIPER FOURTH
Other entries from the Farm,
Chuck Wiper in the novice, Johnny
Brahtz in the junior, and Gardiner
Miller in the senior division, failed
to place. Wiper gained a spot in
the final bracket of his division, but
finished a close fourth.
Herron's victory in the senior di
vision was the outstanding event
in the aquatic turmoil. After quali
fying in the trials with the fastest
time posted, he came back fresh in
the final race to show his superiority
over defending champion Steve Ar
anson, California's ace, in the fast
time of :24.4.
CLASS MEET PLANNED
Vitousek's junior class victory
was an easy one. The lanky sopho
more led the field by a wide margin,
finishing in :25 fiat.
All eyes on the Farm aquatic
front now turn to the interclass
swimming meet, scheduled for Sat
urday, January 28. Slight favorites
in this competition are the seniors,
who have two consecutive inter
class titles tucked beneath their
belts and are now gunning for their
third crown.
Determined to wrest the title
from the Class of '39, Encina's stal
warts, led by Paul Herron, Gardiner
Miller, and Scott Dudley, are con
ceded almost an even chance to
break through for a decisive victory.
