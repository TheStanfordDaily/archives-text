# Frosh Defeat Marin Cagers
## Papoose Team Loses To Lowell, 31-28 
### 
Stymied by a pair of clever for
wards who paced Lowell High
School to a 31-28 cage victory Fri
day night, Indian frosh basketball
ers were strong enough Saturday to
make it an even break for the
week-end games.
Substituted on the yearling sched
ule at the last minute, Marin Jun
ior College roughed it with the
Papooses but were checked 38-35
when Dick Ray broke up a tie with
a one-hander from out by the foul
line.
With a four-game post-holiday
winning surge shattered by the
Lowell invaders, the freshmen start
ed out Saturday with what may be
another streak but will have then
work cut out for them this week
when they tackle Santa Clara's
frosh outfit and Visalia Junior Col
lege here.
Testing out Jack Calderwood's
and Lee's new offensive attack, the
frosh were able to do slight damage,
but Lowell's defense checked it to
some extent with their loose man-
to-man style. By trading off with
their former system, the yearlings
gained a 28-28 deadlock in the clos
ing minutes of the game hut a field
goal and a technical foul shot, plus
a missed set shot by Lew Reese and
a missed foul attempt, but the skids
under the frosh.

It was probably the best game the
freshmen have put under their
belts this season, but where they
lost the game was in their failure to
control the ball more on rebound
shots under both baskets.
Bill Cowden, who led the week
end scoring with 20 points — 12
points against Lowell — was the
strength of the first-year club, but
was unable to take the ball off the
backboard on his own team's shots.
Cowden scored 11 of his total points
on free throws, making 10 of his
last foul shots good, while missing
only three attempts.
