## Pianist Will Play On Lecture Series

Percy Grainger, famed pianist,
conductor, and composer, will play
tomorrow night in Memorial Hall
auditorium in a program of the
Tuesday Evening Series, according to
an announcement yesterday by the
Committee on Public Exercises, in
charge of the series.
Playing several of his own com
positions, the renowned virtuoso
will present a piano concert featur
ing selections by Chopin and Bach.
The program will include the fol
lowing numbers:
"Toccata and Fugue, D. Minor,"
by Bach, in which both Tausig and
Busoni transcriptions for piano will
be used; "Sonata in B Minor," Opus
58, by Chopin, including "Allegro
Maestoso," "Scherzo," "Largo," and
"Finale"; "Mississippi Floortide" and
"Spirit of '39," by Lewis Slavit; and
"Colonial Song" and "The Hunter
in His Career," the former com
posed and the latter set to music by
the pianist.
Returning only two weeks ago
from the Grainger Museum at the
University of Australia, Melbourne,
the artist will remain on the Pacific
Coast until the early part of next
month, according to the Committee
on Public Exercises.
Making his American debut in re
cital in New York in 1915, Mr.
Grainger has made three successful
tours through Australia, his native
country, and New Zealand, and one
through South Africa. Among his
published compositions are: "Irish
Tune from County Derry," "Four
Irish Dances for Piano," "Spoon
River," and "To a Nordic Princess."
