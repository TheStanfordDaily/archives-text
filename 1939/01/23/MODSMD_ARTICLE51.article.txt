## Card Nine Shows Battery Improvement 
### 
"Pleasantly surprised," was about
the only comment varsity Coach
Harry Wolter had to make yester
day concerning the efforts of his
diamond men in last Friday's tight
battle and 2-1 defeat before the
Berkeley Kenney All-Stars. "Our
loss was no disgrace since those All-
Stars were a cracker-jack team and
plenty hard to beat in any league."
This past week has shown great
improvement in the pitching and
catching staff clearly evident by the
swell ball hurling and backing-up
performances turned in Friday.
Battery improvement is, however,
ofiset by the rather weak outfield
which has not been coming along as
well as had been hoped by Coach
Wolters.
"Give every man a try" has been
Coach Wolter's playing program,
thus making noticeable the absences
of First Baseman Cookie South
Masters, mound man, and Team
mate Peterson from the line-up.
These men were, however, kept
benched due to illnesses which
handicapped their playing ability.
