STANFORD took a long step forward when
it created the Activities File last spring.
In its homely metal case should be a secret to
solve the main problem of Stanford's democracy
how to insure the entire student body a
chance to participate in activities.
But, well as the files system has functioned
in the first year of its existence, the system is,
as yet, half-baked. Certain wheels of the ma
chine have been set in place, but gears are
lacking to make it work up to potential strength.
Constitutionally, one single addition can be
made: the establishment of a Committee on
Committees. Partially made up of the heads
of both men's and women's files, the Committee
would be powerful and omniscient. Roughly,
its duties would consist of checking all com
mittee appointments, rejecting, correcting, or
adding to them along the basic lines of thought
which the Committee exemplifies—that jobs
should be spread.
Just where the jurisdiction of such a commit
tee should end is a major problem, but at first
glance, it would appear that all organization
committees whose duties concern the general
student body should be subject to their ap
proval. Naturally, then, all A.S.S.U. committees
would be under control; dance committees,
whose work affects the whole campus, would
be included; and special committees, appointed
from within specific organizations, but working
outside them, would be under advisement.
The Committee's control must be broad to
be effective.
But details will be ironed out when the system
tastes first blood of action. The question con
cerns itself now only with the necessity of es
tablishing such a Committee.
And there can be little doubt of that. Too
long has there been no check on committee
appointments. Only fragile theory of job
spreading has carried the burden, and, by itself,
it has been dubiously successful. Some ma
chine whereby it can function must be estab
lished.
Part of that machine-—the activities file—is
oiled and turning over a capacity load in its
sphere; but unless that sphere is enlarged, its
energy harnessed and applied to the great
wheels of student government, it functions with
out purpose.
The gear between the files and student gov
ernment is the Committee on Committees. Its
name sounds like double talk, but, linked be
tween the files and the parade, it will field gen
eral Stanford to a democracy in practice as well
as in name.

be effective.
But details will be ironed out when the system
tastes first blood of action. The question con
cerns itself now only with the necessity of es
tablishing such a Committee.
And there can be little doubt of that. Too
long has there been no check on committee
appointments. Only fragile theory of job
spreading has carried the burden, and, by itself,
it has been dubiously successful. Some ma
chine whereby it can function must be estab
lished.
Part of that machine-—the activities file—is
oiled and turning over a capacity load in its
sphere; but unless that sphere is enlarged, its
energy harnessed and applied to the great
wheels of student government, it functions with
out purpose.
The gear between the files and student gov
ernment is the Committee on Committees. Its
name sounds like double talk, but, linked be
tween the files and the parade, it will field gen
eral Stanford to a democracy in practice as well
as in name.
STANFORD took a long step forward when
it created the Activities File last spring.
In its homely metal case should be a secret to
solve the main problem of Stanford's democracy
how to insure the entire student body a
chance to participate in activities.
But, well as the files system has functioned
in the first year of its existence, the system is,
as yet, half-baked. Certain wheels of the ma
chine have been set in place, but gears are
lacking to make it work up to potential strength.
Constitutionally, one single addition can be
made: the establishment of a Committee on
Committees. Partially made up of the heads
of both men's and women's files, the Committee
would be powerful and omniscient. Roughly,
its duties would consist of checking all com
mittee appointments, rejecting, correcting, or
adding to them along the basic lines of thought
which the Committee exemplifies—that jobs
should be spread.
Just where the jurisdiction of such a commit
tee should end is a major problem, but at first
glance, it would appear that all organization
committees whose duties concern the general
student body should be subject to their ap
proval. Naturally, then, all A.S.S.U. committees
would be under control; dance committees,
whose work affects the whole campus, would
be included; and special committees, appointed
from within specific organizations, but working
outside them, would be under advisement.
The Committee's control must be broad to
be effective.
