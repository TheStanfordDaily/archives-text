WHEN 32 manuscripts turned up as entries
in Ram's Head's One-Act Play Contest,
Ram's Head was amazed. More amazed is The
Daily, which has fondly believed that the
number of writers at Stanford could be counted
on the fingers of one hand—that is, writers not
on The Daily, that is, that is.
Stanford wouldn't like to admit it; it would
sound too much as if the Rough had been trans
planted by a bunch of sissies. But Stanford has
more writers per square inch of territory than
most schools twice its size.
Writers, that is, with energy enough to turn
out a play manuscript. Which exempts most
English majors and Campus Opinion writers.
