# Old-Age-Old Problem
## 
### 
STRIKING embarrassingly close to one of
modern economics' fair-haired ideas, Presi
dent Wilbur Saturday night voiced the con
servative view that priority to social security
will mean degeneration to America.
In effect, his speech pointed out that renewed
emphasis should be placed on opportunity for
youth, that the aged should aid in replacing
that emphasis, and that it will soon be neces
sary to provide young people with both train
ing and opportunity, "rather than take the easy
method of extending relief."
Based on the theory that there is a conflict
between the young and the old for their respec

tive cuts in the "tax dollar" at the present mo
ment, Dr. Wilbur's argument is enough to ques
tion the purposes for which public relief ex
penditures are being made and to raise a doubt
that all is well with economics' plan for in
creased purchasing power for the aged.
The debate lies in the question as to how
much use the aged may be, how much oppor
tunity there is for the aged in competition with
youth. Modern trends of thought seem to clas
sify old age as a near-state of parasitism.
That even a certain percentage of the old
people themselves agree with this point is evi
denced by $30-a-week.
