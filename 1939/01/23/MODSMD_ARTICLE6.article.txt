# Proud Retriever Hides, Takes Life In His Own Hands
## 
### 
BERKELEY. Jan. 22 (UP).â€”Hen
ry C. Lovcll's big problem solved
itself today.
The problem was what to do
about Trapper, his 13-year-old
Chesapeake Bay retriever.
The Lovells, one night last week,
were discussing whether it would
be more humane to have a vet
dispose of Trapper, who was feeble
and stiff. Trapper, after listening
to the conversation, stalked out and
did not return.
Saturday he was found in a creek
bed near the Lovell home.
"I don't know whether he was
hiding there or got. down and
couldn't get up," Lovell, who be
lieves the dog knew they were talk
ing about disposing of him, said.
"And I can't decide now whether
to have him destroyed or to let. him
live."
This afternoon Lovell reported
sadly Trapper had solved the prob
lem. He died of natural causes.
