# BULL SESSION
## GOOD LUCK, BUT WATCH IT 
### JOHN COBBS 
in this morning's Campus Opinion
column is a remarkably Christian letter from the
Y.W.C.A., in which the dear girls do a first class job
of turning the other cheek to my recent comments
about their designs on the A.S.S.U. treasury. They
ask with saintly self-control for "discussion of the
issue," and after a few arithmetical gymnastics they
state that the extra burden on students would amount
to only half a cent—or perhaps that was their valua
tion of my comment; there was some obscurity on the
point.
I have no intention of challenging the Y.W.C.A.'s
figures. They say that a $20 contribution from the
A.S.S.U. would amount to half a cent per student
stuck, and I am willing to leave it at that. Nor have I
any criticism of their intention to contribute the pro
ceeds of the drive to the Far Eastern Student Service
Fund. I approve of the fund, and I expect to pay up
with a minimum of objection when they put the bite
on me.

B UT , when the Y.W.C.A. starts making eyes at the
A.S.S.U. treasury, I say that it should have some
instruction in financial etiquette. The A.S.S.U. was
set up to manage student affairs, not to subsidize
drives. Possibly the majority of the students would
like to contribute to the Fund. If so we can depend
on the drive sponsors to give them the chance. There
is no need to legislate charity into to their souls.
It is not that I grudge the Y.W.C.A. their half
cent per student. But the "Y" should remember that
its well-manicured hands are not the only ones that
itch. At. the moment the campus has a drive to help
migratory workers. Half a dozen groups designed to
help somebody or other in Spain are floating around
the campus. In these days of high pressure good
Samaritanism, there are innumerable Causes, just as
worthy as this particular fund.
* * * !»
If the "Y" succeeds in making a touch for $20,
there is no reason why its sister drives shouldn't yell
for an equal contribution. Once the Ex Committee
sets the precedent it establishes a perpetual open
season on A.S.S.U. funds.
And the student treasury is hardly in a position
to take over the work of the Rockefeller Foundation.
We have a boathouse to pay for; Ex Committee is
in a mood to do a little cup rattling itself.
The average student stands at the focus of a dozen
equally worthy drives. He has to decide for himself
which deserve his contribution. And he is well quali
fied to do that without having the Ex Committee
make up his mind for him.

sets the precedent it establishes a perpetual open

The average student stands at the focus of a dozen
equally worthy drives. He has to decide for himself
which deserve his contribution. And he is well quali

make up his mind for him.
in this morning's Campus Opinion
column is a remarkably Christian letter from the
Y.W.C.A., in which the dear girls do a first class job
of turning the other cheek to my recent comments
about their designs on the A.S.S.U. treasury. They
ask with saintly self-control for "discussion of the
issue," and after a few arithmetical gymnastics they
state that the extra burden on students would amount
to only half a cent—or perhaps that was their valua
tion of my comment; there was some obscurity on the
point.
I have no intention of challenging the Y.W.C.A.'s
figures. They say that a $20 contribution from the
A.S.S.U. would amount to half a cent per student
stuck, and I am willing to leave it at that. Nor have I
any criticism of their intention to contribute the pro
ceeds of the drive to the Far Eastern Student Service
Fund. I approve of the fund, and I expect to pay up
with a minimum of objection when they put the bite
on me.

B UT , when the Y.W.C.A. starts making eyes at the
A.S.S.U. treasury, I say that it should have some
instruction in financial etiquette. The A.S.S.U. was
set up to manage student affairs, not to subsidize
drives. Possibly the majority of the students would
like to contribute to the Fund. If so we can depend
on the drive sponsors to give them the chance. There
is no need to legislate charity into to their souls.
It is not that I grudge the Y.W.C.A. their half
cent per student. But the "Y" should remember that
its well-manicured hands are not the only ones that
itch. At. the moment the campus has a drive to help
migratory workers. Half a dozen groups designed to
help somebody or other in Spain are floating around
the campus. In these days of high pressure good
Samaritanism, there are innumerable Causes, just as
worthy as this particular fund.
