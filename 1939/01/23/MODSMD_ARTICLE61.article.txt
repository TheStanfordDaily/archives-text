FRUSTRATION
Double frustration.
There is a Farni egg with a pretty green Packard,
which, I understand, he leaves parked very frequently
in front of the Union. One day he got. in his car and
noticed there was a package on the seat.
You can see the guy. Here's a neatly wrapped
package in his car. It doesn't belong to him. He
doesn't know how it got there. He reaches for it . .
it's not mine. He leaves it there.
For a week he parks his car in the same place
during part of every day, waiting for the package to
be removed by whoever put it there. No one takes it.
After a week, she s a too much. He boldly grabs
the package and opens it.
Inside he finds a very pink, frilly nightgown.
He probably blushed.
But who. who put it there? Did some bashful
guy in a rash mood buy it for one reason or another,
suddenly lose his courage and, glancing around him
like some fugitive, quickly toss it in the first car he
came to?
Or did someone simply just lose it? People lose
keys and money and combs and fountain pens and
cigarettes. They can lose pink nightgowns, too.
I suppose.

CUTE KID
He thought she was a pretty good gal. He didn't
know her too well, but she seemed good to him.
Beautiful, but not too beautiful. Lively, but not too
lively. Friendly, but not over-anxious. You know,
good.
So he got a dale with her. One of his better friends
had double-dated, as they say, with him, and the
friend and his girl were out in the car when he went
in to get. the gal he thought was good.
He brought her out to the car, and, of course, in
troduced her to his friends.
"How do you do, I don't like your necktie," she
said to his friend.
After that everything was just no damn use. No
one had any fun at all.

IT'LL DO
One of the eating clubs has a co-operative post
office box with a fiendish combination. One of its
numbers ends in a one-half. That one-half has to be
hit right on the nose or the box doesn't, open.
As a result it's practically impossible to open it on
the first crack. The bovs get pretty sore at it.
One of the boys, in fact, got thoroughly fed up
last week with toying for 10 minutes every day for
his mail.
So he broke the glass.
All they have to do now is just reach in and get
their mail. When any of it is left.
