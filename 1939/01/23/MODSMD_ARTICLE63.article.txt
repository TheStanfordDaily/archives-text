# CAMPUS OPINION
## Y.W.C.A. PETITION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
John Cobbs' discussion of the
Y.W.C.A.'s petition to Ex Commit
tee for a contribution to the Far
Eastern Student Service Fund raises
some interesting questions of pol
icy. ' The funds," says he, "of A.S.
S.U. are contributed by students
and are intended to be adminis
tered in the interests of the stu
dents." Accordingly they should be
spent on Stanford campus—or so he
means to conclude.
We should like to see some dis
cussion of this issue, which he has
stated so clearly. Is it not possible
to interpret "the interests of stu
dents" more widely? Is every
"Cause which rattles the tin cup"
to be met with refusal irrespective
of merit, because, by definition, it
is not in the "interest of Stanford
students"? Apparently other Stu
dent Associations are not so limited
or the National Student Federation
of America would not be sponsoring
the Far Eastern Student Service
Fund drive.
Mary Kay Horton,
President, Y.W.C.A.
P.S.: Just one feminine postscript
please. For all my appreciation of
the principle involved I could not
repress a chuckle at John Cobbs'
fear that Stanford students would
suffer a double assesment should
A.S.S.U. contribute to the Far
Eastern Student Service Fund via
the Y.W.C.A. In our most op
timistic momenls we have not con
templated raising more than $300
for the Service Fund and that from
approximately 800 students and
faculty.
Stanford's student body numbers
4000. Should* A.S.S.U. contribute,
say, $20, it would mean a double
assessment of 5/10 of a cent for the
previous contributors. Hardly
worth a Bull Session, is it?—or is it?
