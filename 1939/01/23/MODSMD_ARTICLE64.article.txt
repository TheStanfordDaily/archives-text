# CAMPUS CARS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I feel that I am exceptionally j
well qualified to enter into a dis- |
cussion regarding this newly-arisen 1

to - drive - or-not-to-drive-on-the -
campus question.
Being neither (1) one with no car,
nor (2) someone with a car who can
n't find a place to park, I can be
long in the unprejudiced car
owners class.
And being unable at the present
time to spend my money foolishly
on 30-mile jaunts to the city, I can
also be said to belong to the pedes
trian class.
UNBIASED OPINION
With this fortification of facts, I
think it can be safely assumed that
I will treat this question in an un
biased manner. And I will proceed
to do this by stating that I agree
with V.D.M. that , student-driven
cars should have no place on the
campus.
It isn't a question of the influx of
persons with "super-supers" and
the resultant death of the hello tra
dition that prompts me to make
thus statement.
It is rather the question of wheth
er cars are necessary at a place
like Stanford. The students should
be thankful for the isolation which
the Farm offers them, and should
not be raring to get as far away
from it as possible as often as they
can.
AUTOS BARREI)
And they should not literally
"drive away" an opportunity for
indulging in a nominal amount of as
healthful an exercise as is walking.
The University of Michigan can
be used as an example of an insti
tution which bars the use of auto
mobiles on its campus. In its in
formation bulletin the following in
formation is printed. "No student
in attendance at the University shall
operate any motor vehicle. In ex
ceptional cases at the discretion of
the Dean of Students this rule may
be relaxed."
It would be a good idea for such
a rule*to be inserted in the In
formation Bulletin of Stanford Uni
versity.
