### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
W/HAT are they fighting for?
Day after day the lives of sol
diers are being thrown away on both
sides in the Spanish Civil War. Some
of these men still have their heads
full of idealistic dreams despite the
horror of the war; the rest fight be
cause they have to.
We all know that the Loyalists are
struggling valiantly to save Spain
from the dragon of Fascism which
is devouring the nations of Europe
in frightening succession. The In
surgents too have a set of ideals.
They see the Popular Front govern
ment as a Red menace, the shadow
of the hammer and sickle over the
Spanish peninsula.
Our stomachs turn a little when
we read of the anti-Semitic atroci
ties in Germany. The blood of an
Insurgent soldier bubbles and
steams when he sees the persecu
tion of the Catholic clergy by Loy
alists. Somehow no cause, no
matter how good it is, seems able
to exist without someone going
just a step too far.
And so as starry-eyed young In
surgents charge the defenses of Bar
celona, they carry with them a men
tal picture of the Bishop of Tara
gonna being boiled in oil, or the
burning of a convent by the Loy
alists. These vague ideals, backed
up by the thought of facing a firing
squad for desertion, make men
fight in Spain.
This war, like all others, must end
someday, and that time may not be
too far in the future, because the
Rebels come closer and closer to
Barcelona. Yesterday but nine miles
separated Franco's forces and the
Republican capital, frantically or
ganizing its forces and resources for
final resistance.
As bombs fell in rapid succes
sion and the Insurgent troops
came nearer to the city, the Loyal
ist cabinet members showed that
they were far from certain of suc
cess by fleeing from what may
soon become a death trap. Mean
while Franco made a smart move
and landed several thousand men
at San Sebastian, north of Barce
lona, to cut oIT all communication
between the capital and the
French frontier.
As we are snug and smug at
Stanford this morning, two groups
of animals, who look very much
like we do, are fighting it out to the
death.

T he two most powerful politicians
in Britain are still at each oth
er's throats. As Prime Minister Ne
ville Chamberlain appealed to his
countrymen to volunteer for serv
ice in his war-time mobilization
scheme yesterday, his most influ
ential opponent denounced his
milk-and-water stand on the Span
ish issue.
Former Foreign Minister An
thony Eden warned England
against the results of the estab
lishment of another Fascist pow
er which is bound to he under
the thumb of Hitler, Mussolini,
and Co. When the dictatorships
arc helping Franco, his argument
runs, why shouldn't England give
the crumbling Republic a little
support?
Mr. Chamberlain has been steer
ing the British bark through Eu
rope's choppy sea for quite some
time now, and he is getting rather
used to Anthony Eden's rocking
the boat.
# * #
financial leaders' fear
of the uncertainty of the fate of
the Continent was increased over
the week-end by the removal of
the conservative Dr. Schacht as di
rector of the Reichsbank and Mus
solini's boasts about what, he is go
ing to do to France. Gold is pour
ing rapidly into the United States'
vaults as the furrows grow deeper
in the brows of Europe's bankers.
Uneasiness toward the interna
tional situation is no greater this
week than last, judging by the
news reports, but the giants of
finance seem to think otherwise
because every day more gold is
being shipped across the Atlantic
to the comparative safety of the
United States.

r ro Congress yesterday President
Roosevelt submitted his antici
pated national health program.
Those who expected sensational de
velopments in the field of socialized
medicine were disappointed; the re
port. contained only recommenda
tions for a 10-year scheme to pro
vide medical care for the underpriv
ileged with expenses to be divided
equally between state and federal
governments.
The United States government
will take no big dive into the field
of providing medical care for its
citizens; it will merely sponsor
health services within the states by
means of grants-in-aid.

medicine were disappointed; the re

tions for a 10-year scheme to pro
vide medical care for the underpriv
ileged with expenses to be divided
equally between state and federal

The United States government
will take no big dive into the field
of providing medical care for its
citizens; it will merely sponsor
health services within the states by
means of grants-in-aid.

Day after day the lives of sol
diers are being thrown away on both
sides in the Spanish Civil War. Some
of these men still have their heads
full of idealistic dreams despite the
horror of the war; the rest fight be
cause they have to.
We all know that the Loyalists are
struggling valiantly to save Spain
from the dragon of Fascism which
is devouring the nations of Europe
in frightening succession. The In
surgents too have a set of ideals.
They see the Popular Front govern
ment as a Red menace, the shadow
of the hammer and sickle over the
Spanish peninsula.
Our stomachs turn a little when
we read of the anti-Semitic atroci
ties in Germany. The blood of an
Insurgent soldier bubbles and
steams when he sees the persecu

r ro Congress yesterday President
Roosevelt submitted his antici
pated national health program.
Those who expected sensational de
velopments in the field of socialized
medicine were disappointed; the re
port. contained only recommenda
tions for a 10-year scheme to pro
vide medical care for the underpriv
ileged with expenses to be divided
equally between state and federal
governments.
The United States government
will take no big dive into the field
of providing medical care for its
citizens; it will merely sponsor
health services within the states by
means of grants-in-aid.
W/HAT are they fighting for?
Day after day the lives of sol
diers are being thrown away on both
sides in the Spanish Civil War. Some
of these men still have their heads
full of idealistic dreams despite the
horror of the war; the rest fight be
cause they have to.
We all know that the Loyalists are
struggling valiantly to save Spain
from the dragon of Fascism which
is devouring the nations of Europe
in frightening succession. The In
surgents too have a set of ideals.
They see the Popular Front govern
ment as a Red menace, the shadow
of the hammer and sickle over the
Spanish peninsula.
Our stomachs turn a little when
we read of the anti-Semitic atroci
ties in Germany. The blood of an
Insurgent soldier bubbles and
steams when he sees the persecu
tion of the Catholic clergy by Loy
alists. Somehow no cause, no
matter how good it is, seems able
to exist without someone going
just a step too far.
And so as starry-eyed young In
surgents charge the defenses of Bar
celona, they carry with them a men
tal picture of the Bishop of Tara
gonna being boiled in oil, or the
burning of a convent by the Loy
alists. These vague ideals, backed
up by the thought of facing a firing
squad for desertion, make men
fight in Spain.
This war, like all others, must end
someday, and that time may not be
too far in the future, because the
Rebels come closer and closer to
Barcelona. Yesterday but nine miles
separated Franco's forces and the
Republican capital, frantically or
ganizing its forces and resources for
final resistance.
As bombs fell in rapid succes
sion and the Insurgent troops
came nearer to the city, the Loyal
ist cabinet members showed that
they were far from certain of suc
cess by fleeing from what may
soon become a death trap. Mean
while Franco made a smart move
and landed several thousand men
at San Sebastian, north of Barce
lona, to cut oIT all communication
between the capital and the
French frontier.
As we are snug and smug at
Stanford this morning, two groups
of animals, who look very much
like we do, are fighting it out to the
death.

T he two most powerful politicians
in Britain are still at each oth
er's throats. As Prime Minister Ne
ville Chamberlain appealed to his
countrymen to volunteer for serv
ice in his war-time mobilization
scheme yesterday, his most influ
ential opponent denounced his
milk-and-water stand on the Span
ish issue.
Former Foreign Minister An
thony Eden warned England
against the results of the estab
lishment of another Fascist pow
er which is bound to he under
the thumb of Hitler, Mussolini,
and Co. When the dictatorships
arc helping Franco, his argument
runs, why shouldn't England give
the crumbling Republic a little
support?
Mr. Chamberlain has been steer
ing the British bark through Eu
rope's choppy sea for quite some
time now, and he is getting rather
