, PRAISED BY GREIG
Hailed by Eduard Grieg as "a
, great genius," Mr. Grainger has his
greatest admirer in the Norwegian
composer, whose estimation of the
pianist has been preserved in pas
! sages in the hitter's diary. Grieg has
written of the artist: "All compari
son fails when we deal with the
I truly great. Grainger is himself. He
has actually realized my ideals of
pianism.
"I had to become 64 years old bo
fore I could hear Norwegian piano
music rendered with such genius
and understanding. In playing . . .
as he does, Grainger is blazing a
new trail for himself, for me, and
for Norway."
AUSTRALIAN VISIT
Returning less than two weeks
ago from his native Australia, the
artist is to remain on the Pacific
Coast until the early part of next,
month, according to the Committee
on Public Exercises. He has been
at the Grainger Museum, Mel
bourne, since last July.
Presenting his first recital when
still in his teens, Mr. Grainger has
since toured the world in the course
of his career, and has been presented
in concerts in the leading cities of
every continent. Much of his time
has been spent in "rediscovering"
old English folk-songs, and he has
been a leader in the movement for
their preservation.
AMERICAN DEBUT
The virtuoso made his American
debut in recital in New York in
February, 1915, and since that time
has presented a number of concerts
in the major cities throughout the
country. He has also made three
successful tours of Australia and
New Zealand, and one through
South Africa.
Among the published works of the
composer are: "Irish Tune from
County Derry," "To a Nordic Princ
ess," "Molly on the Shore," "Spoon
River." and "Four Irish Dances for
Piano."
