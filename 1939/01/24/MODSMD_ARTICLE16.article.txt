## Chapin Affirms Need Of Chinese Students 
### 
"There is a very definite place at
Stanford for an organization that
seeks to develop the religious life
of our women," stated Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, in a r.Kicnt letter to
Miss Katherine Rogers, executive
secretary of the Y.W.C.A. "Through
out the history of Stanford Univer
sity the Young Women's Christian
Association has been of real help
to many hundreds of our students,"
he added.
Dean Mary Yost also voiced her
opinion of the important potential
values the "Y" has for the campus
in the following statement:
DEAN COMMENDS
"First, student life tends to crys
tal ize around the living groups. The
Y.W.C.A. draws from all living
groups and, therefore, tends to pro
mote campus-wide friendliness and
democratic standards of judging one'
fellows.
"Second, student life tends to be
provincial since students' interests
are so largely campus-centered.
The Y.W.C.A. offers opportunity
through their social scrvice work
and their discussion groups to en
large knowledge and sympathetic
understanding of groups beyond the
campus gates.
"Third, the Y.W.C.A. offers var
ied and interesting activities to stu
dents who arc asking to make more
friends, who wish opportunities for
leadership, and who have interests
and talents not developed through
other means.
HIGH POTENTIALITIES
"Fourth, in the present world of
shifting and confused values the
Y.W.C.A. offers its standard of
Christian ethics and tries to help
its members apply this standard to
daily life.
"Whether or not the potential val
ues of the Y.W.C.A. are realized in
any one year," Dean Yost added,
"depends on the thinking co-opera
tion of the membership and the vis
ion and leadership of the cat -»ct."
Of the "Y" Drive, Dr. Leland T.
Chapin comments: "As one who
taught for three years in the Orient,
I am pleased to note the interest of
the Y.W.C.A. in far eastern stu
dents. Stanford students are too
well fed to realize the struggle of
fellow students in China unless
some worthy organization calls
their attention to the ways in which
they can serve mankind."

Stanford for an organization that
seeks to develop the religious life
of our women," stated Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, in a r.Kicnt letter to
Miss Katherine Rogers, executive
secretary of the Y.W.C.A. "Through
out the history of Stanford Univer
sity the Young Women's Christian
Association has been of real help
to many hundreds of our students,"
he added.
Dean Mary Yost also voiced her
opinion of the important potential
values the "Y" has for the campus
in the following statement:
DEAN COMMENDS
"First, student life tends to crys
tal ize around the living groups. The
Y.W.C.A. draws from all living
groups and, therefore, tends to pro
mote campus-wide friendliness and
democratic standards of judging one'
fellows.
"Second, student life tends to be
provincial since students' interests
are so largely campus-centered.
The Y.W.C.A. offers opportunity
through their social scrvice work
and their discussion groups to en
large knowledge and sympathetic
understanding of groups beyond the
campus gates.
"Third, the Y.W.C.A. offers var
ied and interesting activities to stu
dents who arc asking to make more
friends, who wish opportunities for
leadership, and who have interests
and talents not developed through
other means.
HIGH POTENTIALITIES
"Fourth, in the present world of
shifting and confused values the
Y.W.C.A. offers its standard of
Christian ethics and tries to help
its members apply this standard to
daily life.
"Whether or not the potential val
ues of the Y.W.C.A. are realized in
any one year," Dean Yost added,
"depends on the thinking co-opera
tion of the membership and the vis
ion and leadership of the cat -»ct."
Of the "Y" Drive, Dr. Leland T.
Chapin comments: "As one who
taught for three years in the Orient,
I am pleased to note the interest of
the Y.W.C.A. in far eastern stu
dents. Stanford students are too
well fed to realize the struggle of
fellow students in China unless
some worthy organization calls
their attention to the ways in which
they can serve mankind."
"There is a very definite place at
Stanford for an organization that
seeks to develop the religious life
of our women," stated Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, in a r.Kicnt letter to
Miss Katherine Rogers, executive
secretary of the Y.W.C.A. "Through
