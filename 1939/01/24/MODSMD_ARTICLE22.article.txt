## 
### 

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S EMPHASIS OF DEFENSE as a vital national issue may revive in Congress
interest in the old Florida ship canal. The proposed course of the canal is shown in the map. The canal
was begun in 1935 and $5,400,000 was spent on it. but after that Congress refused to add another $12,000,000
and work was stopped. Proponents of the canal say that in time of war shipping would be protected and
the distance from the Pacific shortened. The scenes show general construction features.
