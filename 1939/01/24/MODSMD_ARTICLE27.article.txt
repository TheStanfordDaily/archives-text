I forensic men will be turning neat i
; phrases in praise or condemnation !
! of Stanford's fraternity system, Soph

sion following the debate has ended
and the judges have declared their j

j the winning class.
Delta Sigma Rho. honorary debat- j
ing fraternity, this year sponsors the j
; event and its president, Bob Curtis,
