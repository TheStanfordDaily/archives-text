# Excom Set To Discuss 'Y' Request
## Chinese Fund Drive, Bonfire Site Change Slated for Session 
### 
With an all-star cast of disput
able topics on the agenda, Executive
Committee will move into what
may be its most constructive ses
sion of the year tonight.
Held over from last week's meet
ing will be the question of an
A.S.S.U. contribution to the Y. W.
C. A. drive. Speaking for the "Y"
last meeting was Betty Davis, who
outlined financial plans of the cam
paign, passed on the request that
the Ex Committee authorize a dona
tion, "however small" to swell the
fund which will go to aid Chinese
students.
Mary Kay Horton, president of
the "Y," tonight will speak to the
committee in an effort to clear up
misunderstandings, start the Drive
ball rolling with an Ex Committee
contribution.
BIG GAME
Looking far forward to next, year's
Big Game, Ex Committee will turn
to the question of the bonfire site.
Criticism in the past has been lev
eled at the location of the pyre on
the grounds that it is too disturb
ing to Roble Hall. In an effort to
remove the friction point, an at
tempt tonight will be made to
change the site of the fire. Possible
new location would be the large
field behind the Encina Commons.
Ex Committee's periodic check-up
on the wheels of student govern
ment will come this evening when
two suggestions, planned to correct
certain practical defects in Stan
ford's system, are considered: the
establishment of a Committee on
Committees, and the delegation to
Cardinals of the job of planning a
year's date schedule.
ACTIVITIES FILES
As tentatively outlfeied, the
Committee on Committees would
work with the activities files now in
existence, would have control over
student body appointments.
Final decision on the Freshman
Handbook will be made tonight, with
the indication that three organiza
tions will seek editorship of the
book â€” Women's Conference, Axe
Society, and Sigma Delta Chi.
Seeking minor sport recognition
will be the Rifle and Pistol Club,
hoping to revive the official stand
ing which it enjoyed in years past.
