## Foreign Nationals Prepare to Evacuate; British Ships Hit 
### 
PERPIGNAN. Franco - Spanish
Frontier, Tuesday. Jan. 24 (UP). —
The Spanish Loyalist government
today departed from Barcelona as
Insurgent armies drove close to the
suburbs.
It was reported from Perpignan
on the frontier that a motorized
Insurgent column has reached San
Boy, only two and one-half miles
from Barcelona's suburbs, and an
Insurgent announcement at Burgos
said that the drive had carried to a
point five miles east of Martorell.
The fate of Martorell, 10 miles from
Bareclona, was uncertain.
Since his Catalonian offensive be
gan one month ago today, Franco's
300,000 troops have conquered 15,000
square miles of Catalonian soil and
seized 500 cities, towns and villages.
DAY'S MARCH
The Insurgents, only a day's
march from Barcelona's streets, said
the Loyalist ranks were breaking in
terror and even the cream of the
government's shock troops were
surrendering.
The Loyalist government, depend
ent upon the French communica
tions for food, also sought to keep
an open door through Puigcerda for
escape if Barcelona and the rest of
Catalonia falls.
The 200 American citizens in and
around Barcelona were told to evac
uate at once and the United States
cruiser Omaha was ordered to sail
at midnight from the French Medi
terranean port of Ville-Franche to
evacuate the U.S. consular staff and
50 American refugees from Caldetas,
a sheltered port 20 miles north of
Barcelona.
The U.S. destroyers Badger and
Jacob Jones waited, off the coast
with steam up to answer a similar
call.
EVACUATION PREPARED
Great Britain also prepared to
evacuate her nationals aboard war
ships already in the Mediterranean.
The Barcelona government an
nounced it would remain there, de
spite the approach of the Rebels
whose planes rained bombs on the
city throughout the day with a
heavy toll of life and property.
There was reason to believe, how
ever, some of the government's bu
reaus already had been transferred
to Gerona, 26 miles from the French
border.
PRISONERS CONDEMNED
It was understood 090 prisoners,
condemned to death by Loyalist
courts martial in Barcelona and
awaiting execution for pro-Rebel
activities, already had been trans
ferred to Gerona.
A Barcelona announcement to
night said General Sebastian Pozas
had been appointed military chief
of Gerona Province, responsible only
to the defense ministry over which
Premier Juan Negrin—now armed
with the powers of a dictator—pre
sides.
