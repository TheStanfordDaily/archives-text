# CAMPUS OPINION
## MODERN DANCE 
### 
The Editor. Sir:
Please, dear sir, will you have
someone who knows something
about Modern Dance write the ar
ticles lor your otherwise excellent
paper?
Particularly offensive was the
phrase "the angularity and jerking
rhythms characteristic of the mod
ern dance" in an article about Mar
ian Van Tuyl's concert last week. I
protest that freedom from the regi
mented patterns of ballet doesn't in
fer this. The writer's understanding
is too shallow to be allowed in The
Daily.
However, many thanks for the ap
preciation of the little fellow.
Up.
Incidentally, xMiss Van T. belongs
at this time to Mills.
Thank you.
Mills Dancer
