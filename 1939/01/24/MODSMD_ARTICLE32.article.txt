# REVOLT OF '39
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the article appear- j
ing in The Daily on Firday, Jan. |
20, which dealt with the decisions
of the senior class officers for the
disposition of class funds, we as
members of the Class of '39 refuse
to accept the decisions of these offi- j
cers unless the issues are put to some
kind of class discussions or vote. \
This refers more specifically to class i
dues, donations to the University, I
and the Senior Prom.
As transfers to the Class of 1939 j
it has been brought to our attention 1
that there is apparently no provi- '
sion for a class discussion of these I
issues. The only alternative there
fore seems to be to disregard the |
decisions of the class officers on the |
grounds that these decisions are in
no way binding on members of the
class either collectively or indi- '
vidually.
