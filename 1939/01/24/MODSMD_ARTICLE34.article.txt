### 
The American Broadcasting Com

Mis. John Archibald claimed she had
received as a result of fright occa
sioned by their broadcast of H. G.
Wells' drama "The War of the
Worlds," by Judge Elmer E. Robin
son in Moot Court last night.
"The argument of the representa
tives of the appellant on the ques
tion of the moral responsibility of
the broadcasting company were in
spired," said Judge Robinson, "but
in the absence of previous legislation
on moral obligation in cases of this
type we must uphold the defendant."
Attorneys for the appellant were.
Edward Butterworth and George
Whitney, while David Lombardi and
Leroy Wright represented the re
spondent.
The session was the first winter
quarter hearing held by the Moot
