]%IAIL order track and field j
coaches are mighty rare, prob- |
ably unique, but Tex Byrd is just |
that.
Tex was a successful track men- ,
tor at San Mateo Junior College two I
years ago, but one day he rolled J
up (he tape, pawned his stop watch, j
and came to Stanford to teach \
hygiene.
He had left behind a glorious five- j
year record, had turned out some j
fine athletes, among them Stan j
Hiserman, Vic Boore, Bill Wohle,j
Tom Montgomery, and numerous j
Stanford track and field artists ol j
the past. Since that time, however,!
he has turned exclusively to teach- |
ing and intends never to return to

coaching as a
profession.
His mail order 1
work began, how- j
ever, as a curios- j
ity, when some i
tftussian athletes \
r wrote and asked!
his help in coach- j
ing them. They !
asked some spe- |

cific questions, and he got a kick i
out of answering them. Soon lie j
found himself carrying on a regular |
correspondence with his foreign j
proteges and Wohle did the inter- '
preting.
It seems that in Russia the ath- !
letes represent towns and not i
schools, and the men who write !
him comprise the Kharkov var- |
sity. They have no coach, and
take their instructions entirely j
from Byrd's letters. Occasionally, '
the aspiring athletes send pictures [
of themselves in action. Tex then J
criticizes them and occasionally j
sends pictures showing better j
form.
And the boys in his tutelage are I
making good use of their cor re- j
spondence course. Their town took !
third in the Russian nationals last j
year, and two of the men became !
national champs in their events, I
shot and discus, respectively.
Tex is having a great time with I
his hobby, and some far-away ath- 1
letes are getting some free coach- \
ing. The mail order system seems 1
to be working, but Sears and Roe
buck will never include athletic ;
ability in its catalog.
University of California i
as underdogs is no fun, particu- J
larly for the reserves who count on j
the Big Game basketball series to
win their Block S awards.
Other conference games are out I
of the question with respect to let
ters for all but first-stringers, be-

cause they must
play half of those
i games for Block
S recognition. Or
when Stanford is
playing post-sea
son games,
awards go to those
who get in for
half the playing
time in them
alone.

Last year was a banner year in
basketball, but Stanford had only a
few standouts. So it was to be ex
pected that few would earn their
awards. Seven basketball players
won letters last year.
This year, with reserve strength
more closely matching the first
string, more awards will be earned.
But even then, Block S sweaters
will not be passed out far enough,
simply because the requirements are
too hard to meet.
From a roster of 35 football
players last season, 28 earned
their letters; 80 per cent of the
men on the squad are wearing
Block S sweaters.
Seventeen men spend two hours
a day practicing basketball. Eight
have a good chance of winning
awards — ten may — but under the
present requirements the number
recommended for major sports rec
ognition will be far below 80 per
cent of the number who love basket
bal land play an important role in
practice sessions and when they are
needed in competition.
Coaches can do nothing. Their
job is to win games, and they
would he severely criticized if
they took out the first string for
half of every game or for a sixth
of the total playing tijne in Cal
games. The only solution is to
ease the requirements so that
more men could fill them.
Players do not ask for awards—
some do not care whether they
get them—but it seems only fair
that if Stanford is going to recog
nize anybody for basketball per
tormance, awards should go to all
who deserve them.
