# Freshman Swimmers Hope For Victory
## 
### 
With enthusiasm high in campus ;
aquatic circles, undergraduates who j
can swim or dive are being sought !
out by classmates for entry in the !
annual interclass meet to be held
Saturday, January 28, in the Encina
Pools.
Swimming mentor Nort Thorn
ton, from his vantage point as chief
of the varsity and frosh tanksters,
prophesies the closest point finish
ever staged in such an all-Univer
sity meet. Strangely enough, it is
this year's current freshmen who
are expeected to threaten the two
year supremacy of the class of '39.
SENIORS FAVORED
With a duo of consecutive inter
class victories behind them, the sen
iors, led by Varsity Captain Win
Needham, Dick Clarke, and Roy
Winkelmann, will present a strong
front to challengers.
The Papoose brigade, headlined
by Paul Herron, Gardiner Miller,
and Scott Dudley, promise to give
the defending champions more than
a handful of competition. Herron,
fresh from his week-end victory in
the senior 50-yard event in the Pa
cific A.A.U. championships, is fa
vored to win whatever three events
he may enter.
Strength for the Encinamen will

be added by Howard Adams. De
clared ineligible for yearling compe
tition, the pint-sized Far Western
A.A.U. diving champion will be a
strong threat to take varsity diving
ace Roy Winkelmann's crown.
VICTORY UNSURE
The sophomore class, led by such
stalwarts as Roy Vitousek, Bill
Weeden, and Chuck Wiper, are cer
tain of ending high up in the point
totals, but are not conceded too big a
chance for victory.
Junior tanksters, apparently over
looked in the rush for picking favor
ites, are promising upsets in the fin
ishes of several events. Swinging
enough second and third-place points
to be a high-point thx-eat, they may
turn into the surprise of the meet.
With the seniors and the frosh
confident of several first-place win
ners apiece, second and third-place
points will probably be the deciding
factor in the final tabulation.

PITTSBURGH, Jan. 23 (UP).—Be
cause Coach Carl Olson had failed to
return travel permits for meets dur
j ing the past two indoor seasons, Uni
versity of Pittsburgh track and field
i athletes were barred from competing
I in open events by the A.A.U. regis
-1 tration committee.

ites, are promising upsets in the fin
ishes of several events. Swinging
enough second and third-place points
to be a high-point thx-eat, they may
turn into the surprise of the meet.
With the seniors and the frosh
confident of several first-place win
ners apiece, second and third-place
points will probably be the deciding
factor in the final tabulation.

PITTSBURGH, Jan. 23 (UP).—Be
cause Coach Carl Olson had failed to
return travel permits for meets dur
j ing the past two indoor seasons, Uni
versity of Pittsburgh track and field
i athletes were barred from competing
I in open events by the A.A.U. regis
-1 tration committee.
With enthusiasm high in campus ;
aquatic circles, undergraduates who j
can swim or dive are being sought !
out by classmates for entry in the !
annual interclass meet to be held
Saturday, January 28, in the Encina
Pools.
Swimming mentor Nort Thorn
ton, from his vantage point as chief
of the varsity and frosh tanksters,
prophesies the closest point finish
ever staged in such an all-Univer
sity meet. Strangely enough, it is
this year's current freshmen who
are expeected to threaten the two
year supremacy of the class of '39.
SENIORS FAVORED
With a duo of consecutive inter
class victories behind them, the sen
iors, led by Varsity Captain Win
Needham, Dick Clarke, and Roy
Winkelmann, will present a strong
front to challengers.
The Papoose brigade, headlined
by Paul Herron, Gardiner Miller,
and Scott Dudley, promise to give
the defending champions more than
a handful of competition. Herron,
fresh from his week-end victory in
the senior 50-yard event in the Pa
cific A.A.U. championships, is fa
vored to win whatever three events
he may enter.
Strength for the Encinamen will

be added by Howard Adams. De
clared ineligible for yearling compe
tition, the pint-sized Far Western
A.A.U. diving champion will be a
strong threat to take varsity diving
ace Roy Winkelmann's crown.
VICTORY UNSURE
The sophomore class, led by such
stalwarts as Roy Vitousek, Bill
Weeden, and Chuck Wiper, are cer
tain of ending high up in the point
totals, but are not conceded too big a
chance for victory.
Junior tanksters, apparently over
looked in the rush for picking favor
ites, are promising upsets in the fin
ishes of several events. Swinging
enough second and third-place points
to be a high-point thx-eat, they may
turn into the surprise of the meet.
