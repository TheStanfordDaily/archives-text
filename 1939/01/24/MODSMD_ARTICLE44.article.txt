# Hoopmen Get Set For Winged-O Tilt
## 
### 
Coach Everett Dean gave six of his players leave of absence from
yesterday's basketball practice as he began preparing for this week-end's
games against Olympic Club and College of Pacific Friday and Saturday
nights.
Bill Rapp. Phil Zonne. Bob Burnett. Kenny Davidson. Harlan Cop.sey

.and Dick Taylor were given ihe day
off; only Don Burgess was among J
the five regulars reporting for duty. ]
Despite the wide margin of defeat!
Stanford suffered against California \
last Friday, the Indians didn't look |
hopeless. With seven minutes to;
go the score was only 30-26 in the i
Bears' favor. However, the Indians]
tried too hard to make up the deficit ]
and consequently tied up.
COULDN'T HIT BUCKET
Stanford had its chance to beat!
Cal because the Bears themselves
didn't perform at their best, but
with Don Burness still handicapped
by his bandaged leg, and Bob
Burnett, Bill Rapp and Phil Zonne
unable to come close to the bucket,
the whole burden was on Kenny
Davidson.
Dean was pleased with the play
ing of some of the reserves Satur
day against San Francisco State. The
Indians were loosened up and play
ed the ball just right against the
flashy Staters.
SUBS ARE GOOD
Gil Rahn and Dick Lyon played
bang-up games against San Fran
cisco State, effectively controlling
the rebounds and slowing down the
offense. Harlan Copsey also played
an outstanding game, dropping in
10 points to tie for high honors.
Wilbert Anderson guarded Joe
, Sanz, offensive star of the State
team, making him look so ineffective
j that he was jerked by Coach Dan
j Farmer. Anderson scored seven
i points from his forward position,
J making a perfect record by sinking
[ all five of his foul shot attempts.
Don Wililams, sophomore forward,
also looked good. Williams scored
| l(j points against the University of
I Mexico.
