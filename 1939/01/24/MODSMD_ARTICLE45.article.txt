# Track Team To Face Test In Friday Meet
## First Appearance Of Clyde Jeffrey To Be at S.F. Meet 
### 
For more than three months Stan-
I ford's track and field team has been
j waiting for the chance which will '
; come this Friday night—the first test '
| which ought to tell for sure whether ;
the Farm will be blessed with a po- I
| tentially strong outfit this spring.
With 23 athletes entered in the
Pacific Coast Indoor meet champion- j
] ships in San Francisco, the Indians
will be nobly represented by men
I who have come through remarkably
[ under practice conditions with blaz
| ing times and marks. Friday will be '
j their time to prove that the grand-
J stands which have been proposed for
| Angell Field really should be theirs.
Having run in the Southland, in
: the East and in Europe against the
; classiest sprinters of the nation last
j year as a Riverside Jaysee competi
tor, Clyde Jeffrey will be making his
I first appearance in the Bay area—
i this time in a cardinal and white
j uniform, even though the Trojans
made desperate bids and offers to
| secure his services. Jeffrey has con
j sistently been running the 100-yard
j dash in 9.9 seconds and yesterday
j hit the tape in 21.6 seconds in the
220.
JEFFREY NOT FAVORED
I Jeffrey will be entered in the 50-
| yard dash along with Captain Stan
| Hiserman but will not be favored,
j since he hasn't the fastest start in the
I world and running on the boards
j may prove to be something different
| for him from cinder sprinting.
I Most of the other events arc well
! stocked with athletes three and four
| deep. Chief center of attraction on
; the field will be Russ Wulff in the
| high jump and Bill Wohle in the
j shot put, who have a stiff field to
compete against. Wulff did 6 feet 2V£
j inches yesterday in practice, his
l highest mark of the season, while
Wohle put the 16-pound shot out 49
I feet 11 Va inches for his best effort
| since the holidays. Stan Anderson
j and Bill Trout, who are expected to
j form a one-two-three team with
Wohle, are also entered.
MOORE HITS NEW STRIDE
Getting back to the November
j stride which he hit in fall practice,
| Paul Moore got in a 4:22.4 one-mile
mark in Dink Templeton's Monday
j afternoon session leading Marston
j Girard, his mile twin. Pete Zagar,
who won't get a chance to perform
I in the discus at the indoor meet be
! cause of lack of facilities, was again
| in rare form yesterday tossing out
the platter 150 feet. The distance
was 11 feet off last week's mark but
still stands as proof that the foot
baller intends to get plenty of na
tional honors this year.
Johnny Emanuel was good for a
9:54.5 two-mile race. Bill Hawkins
j nosed out Sid Hayes in his second
I straight 14.9-second high hurdle
| race. Ernie Clark was timed in
j 1:58.2 in the half-mile and Bill Bra
i heny tossed the javelin out 179 feet
! in other marks.
