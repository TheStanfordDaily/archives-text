# Why "Y"
## 
### 
WHETHER Ex Committee does or does not
authorize a contribution to the Y.W.C.A.
Drive is beside the point of the Drive spirit. If
Excom refuses a donation, it is not, at the same
time, censuring the Drive. It is merely saying
that, as an individual, the A.S.S.U. is not con
tributing.
In this case, however, the A.S.S.U. is not
Stanford's student body. Its actions are merely
incidental to the whole task of collecting
enough money to run Y.W.C.A. affairs for a
year, and, if possible, to expand "Y" interests
across the Pacific.
The cause is worthy enough by itself—the
"Y's" place at Stanford is not a small one. But
to add to the credit of those directing it is this
gesture toward students more troubled than
those on the Farm.
The gesture is not an empty one, for to make
it, the "Y" has had to cut down its own budget
by precisely the amount which it hopes to send
to China.
The A.S.S.U. may not contribute; in fact, with
present financial obligations (a fancy name for
the Theater and the Boathouse), it probably
should not.
But Stanford should.
