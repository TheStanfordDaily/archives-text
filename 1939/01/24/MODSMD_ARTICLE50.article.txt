# Bawlout the Row

### 
ELSEWHERE in The Daily is a statement
which should be of some importance, not
only to fraternities constantly facing the charge
of inferior scholarship, but also to freshman
pledges hoping to move to the Row next fall.
It calls attention to a regulation first made oper
ative some two years ago, and makes its warn
ing well in advance, on the theory that fore
warned is forearmed, and that Stanford frosh
will know a good thing when they see it.
Under the Interfraternity Council ruling
guoted, "No freshman may move into a frater
nity unless he has a "C" average in the Bawl
out or a "C" average the quarter before he
moves in." Tying in with Axe Society's attempt
to improve freshman scholarship by improving
study conditions and attitude toward study, this
ruling puts the matter squarely up to the most
important group in the Row's scholastic set-up:
the incoming pledge class, on whom will de
pend the eventual correction of the low grade
average which has long kept fraternities at the
bottom of the Farm's scholastic heap.
If there is an excuse for the drop in grades
which follows joining a house—and few can
see it—it probably lies in the attitude of the new
men toward them. When this attitude is stopped
at its source one at least of the Row's many
worries will have been solved.—A. S. D.
