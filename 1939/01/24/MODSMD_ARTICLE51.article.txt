WHEN Ex Committee sits down tonight, it
won't be looking forward to an evening of
flashy argument on colorful subjects. For if
any agenda ever set out a great array of prob
lems where sheer intellect, sane judgment, and
quietly decisive action were to be called out, that
agenda never came before Ex Committee until
tonight.
Stanford's student body representatives will
be talking democracy, not in terms of fighting
a troublesome minority or an urgent adminis
tration, but in terms of their own basis for
being, their own democratic system.
Within the propositions which will take air
tonight lie potent curatives for some of Stan
ford's student ills. And Excom will be called
upon to look farther than campus walls at China,
will decide to reaffirm or break the precedent
of non-contribution on difficult terms. Because
of the nature of the "Y" request for A.S.S.U.
support, or perhaps because the question of
contributing has come up so often lately, Ex
Committee's policy tonight will be finally defi
nite.
But hiding under less vivid garb than the
"Y" Drive contribution question are three
others: the Bonfire, the Committee on Commit
tees, and long-range planning.
Every one is an immediate problem and yet
a test of broad theory and policy. The Bonfire—

harried from pillar to post, yet still a bone of
contention. Complaints have come from above,
not from the students in general; but those
complaints are insistent. If the Bonfire is moved,
Ex Committee will be showing the better part
of valor—discretion.
And around that table can come something
long asked for, long required—a committee to
make long-range planning more than a Leader
ship Institute talk. Cardinals can do the job; the
nature of the group makes it a logical candidate.
If Ex Committee assigns them the task, and,
more important, if they do it, Stanford will seem
a saner place to a spring quarter visitor.
Committee on Committees, a ridiculous title,
but possibly an ideal come true —if Ex Com
mittee can see it. Through its foundation can
come theory put in practice. Job spreading
might possibly become a reality if the Com
mittee were created.
Ex Committee is going to sit a long time to
night. But what they do can either strong-arm
student government over tall hurdles, or put
it out of the running again.
Grapenuts to Ex Committee.

long asked for, long required—a committee to
make long-range planning more than a Leader
ship Institute talk. Cardinals can do the job; the
nature of the group makes it a logical candidate.
If Ex Committee assigns them the task, and,
more important, if they do it, Stanford will seem
a saner place to a spring quarter visitor.
Committee on Committees, a ridiculous title,
but possibly an ideal come true —if Ex Com
mittee can see it. Through its foundation can
come theory put in practice. Job spreading
might possibly become a reality if the Com
mittee were created.
Ex Committee is going to sit a long time to
night. But what they do can either strong-arm
student government over tall hurdles, or put
it out of the running again.
Grapenuts to Ex Committee.
WHEN Ex Committee sits down tonight, it
won't be looking forward to an evening of
flashy argument on colorful subjects. For if
any agenda ever set out a great array of prob
lems where sheer intellect, sane judgment, and
quietly decisive action were to be called out, that
agenda never came before Ex Committee until
tonight.
Stanford's student body representatives will
be talking democracy, not in terms of fighting
a troublesome minority or an urgent adminis
tration, but in terms of their own basis for
being, their own democratic system.
Within the propositions which will take air
tonight lie potent curatives for some of Stan
ford's student ills. And Excom will be called
upon to look farther than campus walls at China,
will decide to reaffirm or break the precedent
of non-contribution on difficult terms. Because
of the nature of the "Y" request for A.S.S.U.
support, or perhaps because the question of
contributing has come up so often lately, Ex
Committee's policy tonight will be finally defi
nite.
But hiding under less vivid garb than the
"Y" Drive contribution question are three
others: the Bonfire, the Committee on Commit
tees, and long-range planning.
Every one is an immediate problem and yet
a test of broad theory and policy. The Bonfire—

harried from pillar to post, yet still a bone of
contention. Complaints have come from above,
not from the students in general; but those
complaints are insistent. If the Bonfire is moved,
Ex Committee will be showing the better part
of valor—discretion.
And around that table can come something
long asked for, long required—a committee to
make long-range planning more than a Leader
ship Institute talk. Cardinals can do the job; the
nature of the group makes it a logical candidate.
