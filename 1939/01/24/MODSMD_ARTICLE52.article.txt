## PHONOGRAPHIC LITERATURE 
### JOHN COBBS 
some three days now, the sweeping lines of a
nickel phonograph have lomed up from the shad
ows in the back of the Union Cellar. It is an imposing
structure, so resplendent with colored lights and shin
ing glass that it looks like the central exhibit for a
world's fair. But the hashers glower at it like socially
conscious French peasants regarding the Bastille, and
the inhabitants of the cellar swing mental axes as they
stare at its shining glory.
The phonograph was installed on the .request of Ex
Committee, to help raise money for the new boat
house, and is started its career with the best type of
official blessing. Evefi now, it rates an occasional ad
miring look, for it is unquestionably an impressive
thing, a sort of mechanical princess amidst the Union's
proletarian machinery.
* * * *
even the glowing lights won't compensate for
the rip-tide of contention that kicks up whenever
the phonograph starts playing. It seems that to date,
no two men have been able to agree on the proper
volume, and the more impatient spirits are whisper
ing darkly that the machine has no proper volume,
that it is designed solely for the purpose of starting
arguments over whether or not it is too loud.
Personally, I have no great stake in the acoustical
status of the cellar. I was raised in a family that
included three children and a couple of dogs, and at
an early age I acquired a resistance to noise that no
mere phonograph can break. But it hurts me to see
the obvious pain on the faces of my friends. And I
pity the hashers who scurry back and forth changing
the volume to suit the latest demand. Besides, there's
a hole on the back page, and it's to early in the week
to start picking on Women's Conference.

According to latest statistics there are three major
parties involved in the controversy. There is a minority
group which insists that the music is loud enough to
take the plaster off the walls. Another minority com
plains bitterly that it is so low only the secret service
could detect it. The majority states somewhat briskly
that it doesn't give a damn what it is, just so it stays
that way.
All of this, of course, will have very little efTect
on the history of the University. Nor is it likely that
any indvidual lives will be shattered because of the
cellar phonograph. But Ex Committee expects to make
money out of the gadget, and if the present trend
continues the phonograph is destined to spend most
of its time in glistening silence. At the moment the
habitual coke-swiggers are ready to cut the throat of
any man who puts in a nickel and starts the row going
again.
I hate to see Ex Committee disappointed. And so I
suggest that someone do a little research in acoustics.
But I am not particularly upset about it.

parties involved in the controversy. There is a minority
group which insists that the music is loud enough to
take the plaster off the walls. Another minority com
plains bitterly that it is so low only the secret service
could detect it. The majority states somewhat briskly
that it doesn't give a damn what it is, just so it stays
that way.
All of this, of course, will have very little efTect
on the history of the University. Nor is it likely that
any indvidual lives will be shattered because of the
cellar phonograph. But Ex Committee expects to make
money out of the gadget, and if the present trend
continues the phonograph is destined to spend most
of its time in glistening silence. At the moment the
habitual coke-swiggers are ready to cut the throat of
any man who puts in a nickel and starts the row going
again.
I hate to see Ex Committee disappointed. And so I
suggest that someone do a little research in acoustics.
But I am not particularly upset about it.
some three days now, the sweeping lines of a
nickel phonograph have lomed up from the shad
ows in the back of the Union Cellar. It is an imposing
structure, so resplendent with colored lights and shin
ing glass that it looks like the central exhibit for a
world's fair. But the hashers glower at it like socially
conscious French peasants regarding the Bastille, and
the inhabitants of the cellar swing mental axes as they
stare at its shining glory.
The phonograph was installed on the .request of Ex
Committee, to help raise money for the new boat
house, and is started its career with the best type of
official blessing. Evefi now, it rates an occasional ad
miring look, for it is unquestionably an impressive
thing, a sort of mechanical princess amidst the Union's
proletarian machinery.

even the glowing lights won't compensate for
the rip-tide of contention that kicks up whenever
the phonograph starts playing. It seems that to date,
no two men have been able to agree on the proper
volume, and the more impatient spirits are whisper
ing darkly that the machine has no proper volume,
that it is designed solely for the purpose of starting
arguments over whether or not it is too loud.
Personally, I have no great stake in the acoustical
status of the cellar. I was raised in a family that
included three children and a couple of dogs, and at
an early age I acquired a resistance to noise that no
mere phonograph can break. But it hurts me to see
the obvious pain on the faces of my friends. And I
pity the hashers who scurry back and forth changing
the volume to suit the latest demand. Besides, there's
a hole on the back page, and it's to early in the week
to start picking on Women's Conference.
