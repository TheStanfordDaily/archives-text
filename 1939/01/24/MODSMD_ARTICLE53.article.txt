It sounds like something out of a novel by Aldous
Huxley—if you look at it right. Otherwise you would
just think it was from one of the more trite Hollywood
comedies.
But you wouldn't think it was from real life and
happened on our own little Farm:
One of the married boys in the Speakers Bureau
was scheduled to speak the other night. Just, before
the time came, he called up the Speakers Bureau
oflice.
"I can't give my talk tonight," he said. "I'm going
to have a baby."
But don't tell his wife.

Long known as a poor place to study, a fine place
to sleep, a so-so place to get a date, the Library is
fast becoming a place full of hazards and pitfalls, a
dangerous place to spend an evening.
And no good at all for sleeping any more.
It's all because of the current run of firebugs which
have, evidently, replaced the book-worms.
One guy, thinking the Library was still the Library,
fell blissfully asleep the other day. A couple of the I
firebugs crept in under a table and gave him a hot
foot.
Last week another of the boys went to sleep there
in a normal, cvery-day manner.
The firebugs spotted him. They slunk over and set
fire, to his shoe lace. He woke up when the flamos
were lapping at the cuffs of his parils.
I'm waiting for some Ruy with a beard to fall
asleep in the Libe.

Among the dozens of Farm people up in the City
skating Saturday night, there was one guy who
didn't skate so well And every time he fell down,
he lost his girl. . . . The guy who reported the
story in yesterday's Daily about the football game
between the Firehouse Ruys and the women from the
Union was so fascinated watching the game that he
wrote three pages about what fun the huddles seemed
to be. . . . Which the Daily did not print. . . . One
of the boys was telling a friend of his that he was '
going to flunk an ex he had just taken. "That's a
Rood idea, the friend said. "It's a good idea, today
you II get an F. Then when you come through with
aD— you 11 have a reason for celebrating."
