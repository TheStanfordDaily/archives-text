# Lee, Norman To Debate Over Radio
## 
### 
Selection of speakers to represent
Stanford in the coming radio sym
posium with the University of Chi
cago was announced yesterday by
Robert Putnam, debate manager.
The st udent participants will be H. B.
Lee, student body president, and
Nelson Norman, prominent debatei\
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford
president, is to conduct the pro
gram. f
Final arrangements for this pro
gram, to be heard over station
KPO from 2:30 to 3 o'clock, Satur
day, Jan. 28, were concluded by
phone early last Saturday. The sub
ject of the discussion is to be
"Learning for Living."
Much time was expended by Mr.
Leland T. Chapin, varsity debate
coach, and his associates from the
Speech and Drama Department in
choosing men. Not only did they
have to have good voices, but good
radio voices as well. More than 50
were auditioned over microphones
last week, their identity known to
judges only by a number.
JUDGES LISTED
Assisting Mr. Chapin in his se
lection were Dr. J. G. Emerson, Dr.
Virgil Anderson, Dr. Benjamin
Bock, and Ben Alexander, now
studying at Stanford, formerly heard
as master of ceremonies for the
Carefree Carnival radio show.
Lee, after having proved his radio
speaking ability, was considered an
ideal choice because of his study of
education which will add much to
the discussion of the subject, "Learn
ing for Living." This topic was
adapted from the book "Higher
Learning in America," written by
Robert M. Hutchins, president of
the University of Chicago. Nelson
Norman has been very active in de
bating during the last year and, ac
cording to Putnam, has had the ex
perience necessary for radio speak
ing.
SPEAKERS ALTERNATE
The four speakers, two from each
university, will be run off alter
nately on six-minute schedules.
This will entail quite a bit of ether
nip-ups as the program will origi
nate in San Francisco and then
have to be switched to Chicago and
back again Dr. Wilbur is ex
pected to open .comment on, and
conclude the program.
The radio symposium was con
ceived by Ed Lindblom, now debate
coach at the University of Chicago,
formerly Stanford student and win
ner of the Joffre medal for forensic
excellence. Lindblom broached the
idea to Mr. Chapin two weeks ago
and tentative ararngements were
made by letter. These plans were
made final last Saturday morning
when Mr. Chapin spoke to Lind
blom by telephone.
