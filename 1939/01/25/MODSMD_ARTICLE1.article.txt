### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
LAST the inevitable has come
to pass; Barcelona has fallen.
Today is Francisco Franco's big day.
His troops will enter the Repub
lican capital in triumph to listen to
the half-hearted cheers of those
who could not or would not flee, to
bring death to anyone foolish enough
to offer final resistance to the vic
torious Insurgent.
The great Rebel objective has
been accomplished, but civil war
in Spain is still not at an end.
Probably Franco will turn from his
new capital at Barcelona toward
Madrid and the final annihilation of
the Spanish republic, but it is pos
sible that the Loyalists in the south
em provinces may be able to re
sist the Fascist forces in that sector
and the war will go on.
Last night Rebel planes flew low
over Barcelona, this time drop
ping not bombs, but leaflets, on
the starving city. In the darkness
of a barricaded street, lit only by
a distant bonfire, a cripple leaned
over one of the papers and read,
"All those who are not criminals
have nothing to fear—food is ar
riving for you."
As long as there is no resistance
when Franco enters his new capital
this morning, he will show mercy
to the defeated Loyalists, but one
pot-shot at an Insurgent soldier will
be enough to drench the city in
blood. Unconvinced by the Rebel's
guarantee of quarter, thousands of
refugees were rushing north from
Barcelona to the French border last
night.
However, they will be unable to
leave their homeland because the
French government has ordered the
frontier closed to all Spaniards.
These lost oyalists will have no
place to go; already diplomats are
suggesting that they be allowed to
seek refuge in the independent
state of Andorra, high in the Pyran
nees.
It has taken Generalissimo
Francisco Franco 33 days to fight
his way through the determined
line of Republican resistance that
occupied the 78 miles between
the Segrc valley and Barcelona.
With another smoothly executed
drive and a well timed blow at
the Loyalists in the southern prov
inces, the Insurgents can win the
Spanish Civil War from them
selves— and. unfortunately,'" for
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hit
ler. too.

Europe reminds me
w of Encina, and this is one of
those times. The nations on the
other side of the Atlantic are acting
like a bunch of ci'azy frosh today;
they don't know exactly where
they're going or what they're do
ing, but they're getting very excited
over the whole thing anyway.
The fact of the matter is that
the democratic powers of Europe
are extremely worried over the fall
of Barcelona. French Deputies are
running around the Chamber tear
ing their hair and acting like excit
ed Frenchmen in the movies. Span
ish Foreign Minister Del Vayo is in
Paris demanding last-minute aid
for an almost defunct Republic, but
Premier Daladier stands firm in re
fusing to move a finger in favor of
the Loyalists.
The Italian press is crowing
joyfully over the whole affair,
and continues to thumb its nose
at France. True it is that there
were no concrete developments in
the capitals of Europe yesterday,
but the air is charged with elec
tricity, nerves are on edge, and
governments, both democratic
and dictatorial, arc ready for
war.
Not comforting arc the reports
that Germany has adde 100,000 men
to hed army in the last few months,
the prospect that. France and Brit
ain may seize Mussolini's air base
for the Spanish ivil War at Minorca
within the next, few days, the an
nouncement that the technical skill
of Ihe Reich has produced a rubber
substitute so cheaply and in such
quantity that it. will henceforth be
used exclusively in the German
automobile industry and has already |
supplied tires for all of Hitler's,
army trucks.
Dozens of rumors that promise
war by spring fill the air, but today, I
January 25, 1939, we have peace.]

Europe reminds me
w of Encina, and this is one of
those times. The nations on the
other side of the Atlantic are acting
like a bunch of ci'azy frosh today;
they don't know exactly where
they're going or what they're do
ing, but they're getting very excited
over the whole thing anyway.
The fact of the matter is that
the democratic powers of Europe
are extremely worried over the fall
of Barcelona. French Deputies are
running around the Chamber tear
ing their hair and acting like excit
ed Frenchmen in the movies. Span
ish Foreign Minister Del Vayo is in
Paris demanding last-minute aid
for an almost defunct Republic, but
Premier Daladier stands firm in re
fusing to move a finger in favor of
the Loyalists.
The Italian press is crowing
joyfully over the whole affair,
and continues to thumb its nose
at France. True it is that there
were no concrete developments in
the capitals of Europe yesterday,
but the air is charged with elec
tricity, nerves are on edge, and
governments, both democratic
and dictatorial, arc ready for
war.
Not comforting arc the reports
that Germany has adde 100,000 men
to hed army in the last few months,
the prospect that. France and Brit
ain may seize Mussolini's air base
for the Spanish ivil War at Minorca
within the next, few days, the an
nouncement that the technical skill
of Ihe Reich has produced a rubber
substitute so cheaply and in such
quantity that it. will henceforth be
used exclusively in the German
automobile industry and has already |
supplied tires for all of Hitler's,
army trucks.
Dozens of rumors that promise
war by spring fill the air, but today, I

r American vaudeville show I
has a new act today, one |
guaranteed to divert only those with |
extremely broad senses of humor, |
to profoundly annoy anyone else.
This number is being put on by one
of the old Dies Committee troupe.
Representative J. Parnell Thomas of
New Jersey, and his routine fea
tures indictment proceedings against
Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins.
The charge he brings against j
Madame Secretary is that she |
aided and abetted by two of her
associates, has obstructed the dc- ]
portation of that well known man
about - the-San Francisco-water- |
front, llarry Bridges. Against a
melodramatic background of dark
and dire deeds, Representative
Thomas sets his report of how the
Secretary of Eahor is responsible
for the twisted justice that allows
Bridges to remain in the United
States.
LAST the inevitable has come
to pass; Barcelona has fallen.
Today is Francisco Franco's big day.
His troops will enter the Repub
lican capital in triumph to listen to
the half-hearted cheers of those
who could not or would not flee, to
bring death to anyone foolish enough
to offer final resistance to the vic
torious Insurgent.
The great Rebel objective has
been accomplished, but civil war
in Spain is still not at an end.
Probably Franco will turn from his
new capital at Barcelona toward
Madrid and the final annihilation of
the Spanish republic, but it is pos
sible that the Loyalists in the south
em provinces may be able to re
sist the Fascist forces in that sector
and the war will go on.
Last night Rebel planes flew low
over Barcelona, this time drop
ping not bombs, but leaflets, on
the starving city. In the darkness
of a barricaded street, lit only by
a distant bonfire, a cripple leaned
over one of the papers and read,
"All those who are not criminals
have nothing to fear—food is ar
riving for you."
As long as there is no resistance
when Franco enters his new capital
this morning, he will show mercy
to the defeated Loyalists, but one
pot-shot at an Insurgent soldier will
be enough to drench the city in
blood. Unconvinced by the Rebel's
guarantee of quarter, thousands of
refugees were rushing north from
Barcelona to the French border last
night.
However, they will be unable to
leave their homeland because the
French government has ordered the
frontier closed to all Spaniards.
These lost oyalists will have no
place to go; already diplomats are
suggesting that they be allowed to
seek refuge in the independent
state of Andorra, high in the Pyran
nees.
It has taken Generalissimo
Francisco Franco 33 days to fight
his way through the determined
line of Republican resistance that
occupied the 78 miles between
the Segrc valley and Barcelona.
With another smoothly executed
drive and a well timed blow at
the Loyalists in the southern prov
inces, the Insurgents can win the
Spanish Civil War from them
selves— and. unfortunately,'" for
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hit
ler. too.

aided and abetted by two of her
associates, has obstructed the dc- ]
portation of that well known man
about - the-San Francisco-water- |
front, llarry Bridges. Against a
melodramatic background of dark
and dire deeds, Representative
Thomas sets his report of how the
Secretary of Eahor is responsible
for the twisted justice that allows
Bridges to remain in the United
States.
LAST the inevitable has come
to pass; Barcelona has fallen.
Today is Francisco Franco's big day.
His troops will enter the Repub
lican capital in triumph to listen to
the half-hearted cheers of those
who could not or would not flee, to
bring death to anyone foolish enough
to offer final resistance to the vic
torious Insurgent.
The great Rebel objective has
been accomplished, but civil war
in Spain is still not at an end.
Probably Franco will turn from his
new capital at Barcelona toward
Madrid and the final annihilation of
the Spanish republic, but it is pos
sible that the Loyalists in the south
em provinces may be able to re
sist the Fascist forces in that sector
and the war will go on.
Last night Rebel planes flew low
over Barcelona, this time drop
ping not bombs, but leaflets, on
the starving city. In the darkness
of a barricaded street, lit only by
a distant bonfire, a cripple leaned
over one of the papers and read,
"All those who are not criminals
have nothing to fear—food is ar
riving for you."
As long as there is no resistance
when Franco enters his new capital
this morning, he will show mercy
to the defeated Loyalists, but one
pot-shot at an Insurgent soldier will
be enough to drench the city in
blood. Unconvinced by the Rebel's
guarantee of quarter, thousands of
refugees were rushing north from
Barcelona to the French border last
night.
However, they will be unable to
leave their homeland because the
French government has ordered the
frontier closed to all Spaniards.
These lost oyalists will have no
place to go; already diplomats are
suggesting that they be allowed to
seek refuge in the independent
state of Andorra, high in the Pyran
nees.
It has taken Generalissimo
Francisco Franco 33 days to fight
his way through the determined
line of Republican resistance that
occupied the 78 miles between
the Segrc valley and Barcelona.
With another smoothly executed
drive and a well timed blow at
the Loyalists in the southern prov
inces, the Insurgents can win the
Spanish Civil War from them
selves— and. unfortunately,'" for
Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hit
ler. too.

Europe reminds me
w of Encina, and this is one of
those times. The nations on the
other side of the Atlantic are acting
like a bunch of ci'azy frosh today;
they don't know exactly where
they're going or what they're do
ing, but they're getting very excited
over the whole thing anyway.
The fact of the matter is that
the democratic powers of Europe
are extremely worried over the fall
of Barcelona. French Deputies are
running around the Chamber tear
ing their hair and acting like excit
ed Frenchmen in the movies. Span
ish Foreign Minister Del Vayo is in
Paris demanding last-minute aid
for an almost defunct Republic, but
Premier Daladier stands firm in re
fusing to move a finger in favor of
the Loyalists.
The Italian press is crowing
joyfully over the whole affair,
and continues to thumb its nose
at France. True it is that there
were no concrete developments in
the capitals of Europe yesterday,
but the air is charged with elec
tricity, nerves are on edge, and
governments, both democratic
and dictatorial, arc ready for
war.
Not comforting arc the reports
that Germany has adde 100,000 men
to hed army in the last few months,
the prospect that. France and Brit
ain may seize Mussolini's air base
for the Spanish ivil War at Minorca
within the next, few days, the an
nouncement that the technical skill
of Ihe Reich has produced a rubber
substitute so cheaply and in such
quantity that it. will henceforth be
used exclusively in the German
automobile industry and has already |
supplied tires for all of Hitler's,
army trucks.
Dozens of rumors that promise
war by spring fill the air, but today, I
January 25, 1939, we have peace.]
