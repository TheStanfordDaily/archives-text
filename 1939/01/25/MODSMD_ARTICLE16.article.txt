# Excom Approves Far East Drive
## A.S.S.U. Refuses Contribution Because of Traditional Policy 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Ploughing through a long, long agenda, Kx Committee last night took
action on problems ranging from the war in China to campus yell leader
tryoutees.
Although the committee refused an Associated Students' grant to the
Far Eastern Service Fund, it recommended almost unanimously that sub-

sidiary organizations contribute.
Ex Commtitee's refusal to mala
an appropriation for the fund was
due to (1) A.S.S.U.'s established
policy of subscribing to no outsidr
appeals for funds, and (2) duplica
tion that would result, sincc A. S.
S. U. funds come ultimately from
the students.
Chief objection to the motion
sanctioning the fund drive was made
by Harry Horton.
"I don't think this money is go
ing to college students at all," he
said. "I think it will go to continue
the war. I don't think there is any
one in .school over there. They are
all out lighting."
Bill Turner, who has spent the
past week investigating the fund,
explained the money is to be used
to move Chinese students out. of
war areas.
