# Insurgent Force Takes Barcelona
## Moors in Vanguard As Loyalist Capital Falls to Fascists 
### 
PERPIGNAN, Franco - Spanish
Frontier, Jan. 24 (UP). —Generalis-
simo Francisco Franco's Insurgents
tonight marched into the streets of
Barcelona, his Lerida field base an
nounced, but delayed their triumphal
occupation of the doomed Loyalist
capital until after daylight.
The city was in darkness, lighted
only by fires set by Insurgent artil
lery blasting the crowded port dis
trict, and Franco apparently feared
dangers lurking along the already
barricaded streets.
LAST STANI) PREPARED
Syndicalists and anarchists, real
izing they face death before firing
squads if captured by the Insurgents,
mobilized for a last stand in the
streets, Barcelona dispatches said.
The Insurgents also feared Loyal
ist extremists might have mined the
boulevards leading into the Plaza
Cataluna, the hub of Spain's most
prosperous city.
Franco's Lerida base announced
shortly before midnight that, bearded
Moors under General Juan Yague
had stormed into the city from the
south after capturing the suburbs of
Hospitalet. and Casa Antunez as well
as Prat, de Llobregat airport.
TEMPORARY CAPITAL
Within 24 hours, the Insurgents
jubilantly proclaimed, Barcelona will
be the temporary capital of Insurgent
Spain and hundreds of food trucks
will roll through the streets with
tons of foodstuffs for the city's 2,000,-
000 people.
Swarms of Insurgent planes circled
the city dropping leaflets saying "All
those who are not criminals have
nothing to fear—food is arriving for
you."
Although Franco's Moroccans were
in the vanguard of the smashing
drive into Barcelona's streets, it was
indicated they would be held back
and General Juan Solchaca's Navar
rese would lead the triumphal entry.
MOORS HATED
Franco, it was said, realized the
Moors would create an unfavorable
impression at a time when he is de
sirous of pacifying Barcelona's popu
lation. Tlie Loyalists' hatred of the
Moors is exceeded only by their bit
terness toward his Italian Black
shirts.
Barcelona's gates opened to the
Insurgents after a day of swift en
circling operations that included the
fall of three key towns—Manresa,
Tarrasa and Martorell—the collapse
of the government's last line of de
fenses outside the capital along the
Llobrekat River.
The Loyalists had counted upon
the Llobregat to serve to hold off
the invaders, but six columns of In
surgents crossed the flood-swollen
river at four points and closed in
upon the capital.

Frontier, Jan. 24 (UP). —Generalis-
simo Francisco Franco's Insurgents
tonight marched into the streets of
Barcelona, his Lerida field base an
nounced, but delayed their triumphal
occupation of the doomed Loyalist
capital until after daylight.
The city was in darkness, lighted
only by fires set by Insurgent artil
lery blasting the crowded port dis
trict, and Franco apparently feared
dangers lurking along the already
barricaded streets.
LAST STANI) PREPARED
Syndicalists and anarchists, real
izing they face death before firing
squads if captured by the Insurgents,
mobilized for a last stand in the
streets, Barcelona dispatches said.
The Insurgents also feared Loyal
ist extremists might have mined the
boulevards leading into the Plaza
Cataluna, the hub of Spain's most
prosperous city.
Franco's Lerida base announced
shortly before midnight that, bearded
Moors under General Juan Yague
had stormed into the city from the
south after capturing the suburbs of
Hospitalet. and Casa Antunez as well
as Prat, de Llobregat airport.
TEMPORARY CAPITAL
Within 24 hours, the Insurgents
jubilantly proclaimed, Barcelona will
be the temporary capital of Insurgent
Spain and hundreds of food trucks
will roll through the streets with
tons of foodstuffs for the city's 2,000,-
000 people.
Swarms of Insurgent planes circled
the city dropping leaflets saying "All
those who are not criminals have
nothing to fear—food is arriving for
you."
Although Franco's Moroccans were
in the vanguard of the smashing
drive into Barcelona's streets, it was
indicated they would be held back
and General Juan Solchaca's Navar
rese would lead the triumphal entry.
MOORS HATED
Franco, it was said, realized the
Moors would create an unfavorable
impression at a time when he is de
sirous of pacifying Barcelona's popu
lation. Tlie Loyalists' hatred of the
Moors is exceeded only by their bit
terness toward his Italian Black
shirts.
Barcelona's gates opened to the
Insurgents after a day of swift en
circling operations that included the
fall of three key towns—Manresa,
Tarrasa and Martorell—the collapse
of the government's last line of de
fenses outside the capital along the
Llobrekat River.
The Loyalists had counted upon
the Llobregat to serve to hold off
the invaders, but six columns of In
surgents crossed the flood-swollen
river at four points and closed in
upon the capital.
