# Frankenstein Comes Bach; Frosh Quake
## 
### 
At 10:30 o'clock Monday night En-
I cina echoed and re-echoed screams,
as enthusiastic listeners to the "Dev- '
! il's Scrapbook" program turned off
! their radios and let loose pent-up
nervous emotion with many hor
rible varieties of screams.
At 11:30 o'clock, (any) three]
I sleeping students (reading Barnes,
History of Western Civilization)
: were aroused from their lethargy by
a slow, deliberate knock on the
| door. One of them ambled over,
poked his head out, muttered "Oh.
my God!" and backed unsteadily
j into the room. The other two look
j ed up. There were hoarse croaking
â€¢ noises and a gulp, as three scalps
! stood up and tingled with terror,
j Lumbering into the room with ex
l pertly spaced, low growls, came a
; wonderfully horrible Frankenstein.
I Then from the hall came loud rolls
i of laughter. The three now unsleepy
j students grinned sheepishly and
j joined the crowd following Frank-
I enstein Bud Ames on his tour of
j Encina.
The painted cardboard forehead,
j pencil-stub plugs in his neck, an
| old coat padded in one shoulder
| with towels, expertly applied green
| crayon, and Ames' shaggy hair
j kept Encina in an uproar for over
j an hour.
