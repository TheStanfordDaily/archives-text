WE NEEDN'T BE ANGELS •
BUT LET S WISE UP
W'HEN Stanford spirit is at par,
Stanford is seldom compli
mented. but as soon as it goes rot
ten, sour grapes columnists give a
Boy Scout salute and begin to cru
sade against booing and small-time ;
sportsmanship. Occasionally, how
ever, somebody notices a superior
altitude among sports fans at Stan
ford and it goes into print.
Ilarry B. Smith, sport editor of
the Chronicle, was well-impressed
with Stanford spirit at the all -
University boxing tournament.
He heard lots of cheering and no
booing—well, very little anyway—
a few of the younger students had
n't been around long enough to
catch on. Mr. Smith was able to
discount shortcomings of the
newcomers, and was lavish in !
his praise of Ilarry Maloney and
bis successful promotion of the
Stanford gentleman movement.
But what has happened to Card
basketball fans? Refereeing a Stan
ford game was once a pleasure, and
suddenly it has become a dreaded
task. Could we have been short
sighted in believing that the gentle
manly altitude of Stanford rooters |
was a tradition rather than the nat
ural spirit that accompanies a 1
winning basketball team?
Of course, every rooting section
has its quota of l-know-the-rules
alul -I-want-everyone-to-know-it
fans, who spend 40 minutes coach
ing the referees just to impress j
neighbors with their brilliant grasp
of the general idea. But the im
pression, probably, is ironically to
the contrary.
Those who really know realize;
that the men with the white duck I
pants probably know more about j
their business than Joe Know-it- '
all. As am matter of fact, the refs do j
know the rules cold, but they do not i
always observe them. Their jobs j
includes the task of keeping things
running smoothly, and they give the
rules a loose or strict interpreta- j
tion as they see fit to make the game |
a good one. Why, if the referees had j
called all the fouls in the Cal game
last Friday, most of us would have
got up and gone to a movie.
Now the referee must be con
sistent in his interpretation of the
rules, and this is the principal
basis of his short-comings. But it
is logical to believe that he knows
what he is doing when he lets a
foul go by or calls a thin one.
Occasionally, it is obvious that he
doesn't, but why antagonize him?
Why not try a little tact? Follow
the example of the players when
they think they've been dealt a
rotten deal. They're not putting
their arms around the ref because
they love him.
So let's keep on the good side
of the men who can win or lose
the game for us; and if they know
a little more about the game than
you, just remember that "it is bet
ter to keep your mouth closed
and he thought a fool than to open
it and remove all doubt."
And if you're sentimental about
traditions or care to help in giving
Stanford a name for which you can
carry your chest high when you get
out, the impression you give by
gentlemanly spirit at athletic con
tests will be velvet.
TINY IS BUILDING
TItIPLE-TIIREAT BACKS
r riNY THORNHILL is anticipat
ing the loss of Bill Paulman as
a triple-threat man next year, and
lie is solving the problem right now.
Norm Standlee will be needed GO

minutes in the backfield, and he
won't just be running. He has been

spending a little
time nearly ev
ery day with the
varsity mentor
learning to kick
and pass. Tiny
has had time to
break Stanford's
ace line charger
of his main faults

in kicking and passing the ball,
and by spring practice Standlee will
be ready to go to work in any de
partment of the triple-threat tri
angle.
Helping him to fill Paulman's
shoes, Tiny has also been giving
concentrated attention to Gene
Coldiron. The red-headed scrapper
came to Stanford highly recom
mended as a kicker, and he has lit
tle trouble resuming the knack. And
his passing game is improving fast.
Besides a regular turnout of about
four men, Rod Parker is usually on
hand lor extra instruction, and Peter
Fay drops over occasionally before
rugby practice.
The regulars are really out for
track, and they work with a foot
ball only after their progressive re
lays, designed and supervised by
Dink Templeton for gridders and
weight men.
