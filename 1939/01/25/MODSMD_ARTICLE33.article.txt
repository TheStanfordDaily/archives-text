# Yearlings Head for Cal Cage Game
## 
### 
Out to build up to a special peak
â€”all for Cal's frosh team, whom
they meet Feb. 10, and for which
they'll have four games of tough
caliber to help prepare them, the
Farm's yearling cagers has been
getting its customary dose of prac
tice for their games with Sacra
mento and Auburn Junior Colleges
this week.
A change of schedule left Santa
Clara's yearlings out of this week's
festivities and Sacramento plays in
its place after last week's sudden
shift in plans. Coach H. B. Lee will
work his basketballers on a system
to solve the man-to-man defense
used by the Capitol club. Auburn
is not considered a great threat, al
though teams of fair caliber have
been turned out in the past.
After one week of practice and
two games in which to test it out,
Lee has the team out polishing the
timing on Jack Calderwood's and
his new offense. Several variations
of the system will be worked out
in this week's practices.
At the same time practice on in-
I dividual guarding against drib
i bling, which proved to be one of
j their weak apots against Lowell
High School last Friday, will get
| considerable attention from Lee,
i who has a scrimmage set for the
! boys this afternoon. Tuning up. for
| the week-end games will occupy to-
I morrow's sessions.
