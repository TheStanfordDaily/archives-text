# Card Cagers To Tackle Olympic Club
## Former Cal, S.F.U. Stars to Play Friday For Winged-O Team 
### 
With the Conference schedule giv
ing the Indians a bye this week-end
before the U.C.L.A. series February
3-4. Coach Everett Dean sends Stan- J
ford's basketballers out against the
Olympic Club and College of the
Pacific in the Pavilion Friday and ,
Saturday nights as tune-ups for the
Bruins.
The Winged-0 hoopmen boast an
experienced outfit that could prob
ably rate as one of the best on the
coast if the business-men athletes
got a chance to practice often. This
game will be a resurrection of col- |
lege Big Games for four of the
Olympics, who are former disciples
of Nibs Price at California.
CAL STARS I'LAY
They are Ray Balsley, Ray Ouson, ;
Don Jensen, and Ed Dougery. Bals
ley and Olson are former Bear cap
tains while Dougery was a regular 5
on last year's Cal outfit that handed
the Indians one of their two Con- j
ference setbacks.
Supplementing this quartet are Al
Baylacq, the powerfully built midget 1
who sparked San Francisco Univer- j
sity last year, Arville Hedman and a
gent named Anderson. Ray Olson,
incidentally, is now attending grad
school at Stanford.
Dean intimated that he may give
his reserves a chance to get in some
action against College of the Pacific
Saturday. The Bengals scored an
upset win over San Jose State ear
lier in the season but haven't shown
enough talent since to seriously
threaten Stanford.

U.C.L.A. last Friday night to erase :
