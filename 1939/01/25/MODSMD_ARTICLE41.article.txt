# Sigma Chi Capers Beat Independents
## 
### 
There is an axiom among basket
ball players that a good team cannot
play well against a poor one. This ,
belief wis verified by two strong
intramural quintets in last night's
games.
The first strong team to become
tied up by poorer opponents was the
powerful Sigma Chi's. After 30 min
utes of sloppy ball against a helpless
Independent IV quintet, the Sigma
Chi's rolled into ;i decisive lead in
the late minutes of the contest i,o
take a 27-15 victory. Every player,
however, was a point-better for the
winners and the snappy passing of
Jack Topham set up several buckets
for his team mates.
TRAILED AT HALF
Trailing at halftime by one point,
12-11, an eflicient Phi Delta Phi unit
finally hit its stride and when click
ing smoothly, pulled away from its
weak opponents, Deke 11, 42-18. Arch
Zamloch was high for the winning
live and for the evening with 10
markers. Ken Volk, Deke forward,
closely followed with 9.
SLOWEST GAME
The slowest game of the evening
was the match between S.A.E. and
Business School 11. The Business
School quintet managed to outfum
ble the fraternity men and lost 1.4-8.
In another sloppy, listless contest,
Phi Kappa Sigma I turned back a
week Sigma Nu II five 20-7. Points
throughout the battle were few and
far between; the majority of them
being made by Don Grossman and
Lee Garretson who each got 7 digits
for the victors.
Kappa Alpha II team failed to
show for their scheduled game with
Business School I and the latter was
declared the winner 1-0.
