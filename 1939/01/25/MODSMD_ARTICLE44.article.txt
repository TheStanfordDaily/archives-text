# They Sat to Conquer

### 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE last night walked
into a round of intellectual punches which
might have sent it down for the count before the
first period was over. Strange to say, when the
session rose two and one-half hours later, it was
groggy but unbowed.
Before it lay the bloody heads of a half dozen
problems which, by themselves, could have
given the group a nasty hour or two. But Ex
Committee took it last night, and gave better
than it received.
A summary of their actions, among the most
important they have taken this year, is not
amiss.
In three successive moves, Excom advanced
its student body queen into near-checkmate
position in the game of Stanford student de
mocracy.
Cardinals was officially authorized to straight
en out the Chinese puzzle of activities dates;
discussion, with action to come when a definite
plan was submitted, approved the founding of
a Committee on Committees, a job-spreading
organization which may turn contemplation of
theory into practice; and Ex Committee passed
a resolution which may make the Bonfire burn
with a brighter light when it approved attempts
to change Bonfire site to a spot more removed
from campus dormitories.
In type, those actions look dead; they were
not so last night; they will not be when put into
effect.
All of them might have come long ago if
Plato had held student government reins. That
they come now, when stress on the student
position is heavy, stands as a sort of monument
to student powers to think through their own
problems, their ability to act decisively and
quickly.
Lest Excom be accused of acting without
sufficient backing from other student leaders,
the meeting of junior and senior activities heads
tonight will bring discussion on the self-same
questions which Ex Committee took in stride
tonight.
The way has been lighted by Excom's actions;
juniors and seniors tonight should be able to
follow it without difficulty, cast added brilliance
from the lanterns which they carry.
They may not find wise men at Stanford
with those lanterns, but they will find the foot
prints of sensible ones written in the Ex Com
mittee minutes tonight.
