T NDICATION by the President of the Univer
-1 sity that he favors the establishment of a gov
ernment aviation training school at Stanford
removes the last obstacle on this end of the
line to action on a matter of prime importance
to the Farm. If Washington can see its way
clear, fitting recognition will come to a school
whose fliers stand at the peak of intercollegiate
competition.
On psychological grounds, however, the pro
posal cannot be greeted with quite the same
enthusiasm. Granted its justification from the
standpoint of Mr. Roosevelt's rearmament pro
gram, there can be little from the standpoint of
the cannon-fodder whose sympathies it will
enlist in a dangerous cause.
What will become of Stanford's dislike for
war when regular practice flights are held and
the drone of the mass formation sings an omi
nous and ever-present overtone to the life of
the campus? What will happen to all the fine
talk and idealism when Stanford is cited, as it
will be, for its excellence, its "outstanding rec
ord"? What will be the result when the over
powering pomp and circumstance of military
rigmarole is brought to bear in a form as dra
matic as aviation is? How long will it be then
before the Cardinal enters the biggest game
of all and "Come join the band" means "The
devil with peace"?
It is posible, of course, that Stanford will take
the whole thing as calmly 'and sanely as it
should; but the chances of that are so small as
to be practically non-existent. Too many things
encourage a war psychology; too much hangs
in the balance. America has a rendezvous with
destiny, says her President; and who are we to
hang back?
It. will be good to see the Farm's excellent
fliers recognized for the experts they are; but
it is with mixed feelings that we await the day
when the shadow of a bomber lies always on
the Quad. â€”A.S.D,
