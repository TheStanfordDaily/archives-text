## IT'S YOUR BABY 
### JOHN COBBS 
JT IS fashionable these days for Stanford to speak
of student government as an expensive and dan
gerous plaything, valuable only because it keeps the
undergraduates off the streets. In line with this atti
tude, the administration in the past has been content
to treat the student representatives as amiable, though
backward, children; recently, however, it has given
us to understand that its cloak of paternal patience
is wearing a bit at the elbows. Student government,
we are told, is ineffiicent and annoyingly unsatisfac
tory. There are dark hints that the day of judgment
is at hand.
Before the administration begins its weighing-in
the-balance project, I would like to suggest respect
fully that it has never permitted Stanford to have a
pure student government. Therefore it has no reason
to complain that student government is unsatisfactory.

In form we have all the machinery of student con
trol, complete with officers, councils, and assorted com
mittees. But the influence of the University adminis
tration drives that machinery, and when the adminis
tration scowls at student government, it is insult
ing its own reflection.
This statement may seem a shade on the strong
side to anyone who has used the Frosh Bible as a
rock on which to build his temple of ideology. But a
check through this year's record shows that the ad
ministration has never been content to let the stu
dents play quietly with their government. It laid
down limits and applied pressures until the student
machinery became simply a cushion for administra
tive action. And then it complains that our govern
ment is bad. A rat-running psychologist might with
equal justice blame his white mice because they al
ways move along the paths of the maze instead of
making an air-line for the bait.
r JpHE Bonfire question, which is now spoiling the
digestions of student leaders, is a typical example
of the way the process works. The undergraduates
like the Bonfire the way it is; last year they shouted
out their voice boxes with a minimum of damage
and a maximum of satisfaction. But the dean of
women thinks that the Bonfire has an unnerving
effect on freshmen. And so Women's Conference is
informed that something must be done about it.
Conference has always had a distressing habit of
singing chorus to any solo from the dean's office, and
in this case it is playing its usual parts. The stu
dents are satisfied, but even so something must be
done. Faced with a situation like this, Talleyrand or
Bismarck would have turned -.in a blank score, and
yet the administration expects us to solve it.

Another example is freshman discipline. Some
time ago, it was announced that, moved by democ
racy and Christian charity, the University would give
the freshmen representation in sponsors' meeting. In
form this was student government at its best, the
classmates of the offenders handing out the discipline.
But on the first day of the new year, the dean of men
informed all freshmen that anyone who broke Univer
sity property would be tossed out of school.
This set-up is a type of risk-shifting that would
make a political scientist break into tears. The fresh
men representatives take the responsibility and blame;
the administration sets the penalties.
* * * *
The whole course of student government is shaped
and limited by the administration. It uses its prestige
and influence over us to tell us what must be done
and how to do it. It narrows the limits of our opera
tion until we can move only in one direction, like a
man in a tunnel.
When the administration fumes about student gov
ernment, it is assaulting a very convenient piece of
machinery that serves both as a weapon and as a
shield. Somehow, I can't think that the administra
tion is as dissatisfied*as it would have us believe.
