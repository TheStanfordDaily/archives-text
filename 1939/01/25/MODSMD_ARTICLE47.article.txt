### DOUG JAQUES 
It's one thing staying up late at night. It's another
thing being up late at night writing a column. Without
a funny story to your name.
That's probably very profound. I have noticed that
things get more profound in direct proportion to the
lateness of the hour—up until about 4:30 in the morn
ing, when you get just silly, or very sleepy and in
clined to dislike people.
Also, somewhat profoundly, I iust realized how
different everything is after midnight. I mean
right here on our own little Farm. It's quiet, like
in a deaf man's head. It's so quiet it buzzes.
I'm quite positive that if I went outside and yelled
I'd hear an echo.
And it's quiet here at the house, too. It's one
of those nights when most of the hoys turned off
their radios before they went to bed. It's even
quiet over at the Libe. A lot of good that does
anyone.
But then there are those very, very beautiful rec
ord programs to keep you entertained. Yeah. All the
announcers on them are very bad. If they are not
very bad, they are very sleepy.
At any rate, one and all, they mumble. Every
hour they make more dedications than Jimmy Walker
has in a lifetime. Listening to them you are pain
fully aware how limited people's vocabularies are
when they come around to dishing out names for their
cute little sons and daughters. You hear exactly the
same names, over and over again, in somewhat dif
ferent arrangements, dedicating and being dedicated
to—and I don't think that's because the same dozen
people do all the dedicating on all the programs. Be
sides, I have heard three Mr. X's dedicating or being
dedicated songs so far tonight. What lively imagina
tions some people have.
And one way to find out what songs were
popular three months ago is to listen t«• those rec
ord programs for a night. If you listen two nights,
you tan almost tell what order they will come in.
On the program I'm listening to now (that's
certainly going to look funny when it comes out
in Wednesday's paper), the announcer just gave
the name of a song and then added, "I knew that
would come sooner or later."
We both knew.
One thing about being up late is that you always
run out of cigarettes, and then you can go around
the house like someone with a reward out for him
and a series of numbers under his name trying to
find what your friends and brothers have done with
their cigarettes. They can hide them in the most
fiendish places, let me tell you. But if you are any
good at all, you can find them.
If any of the boys in (he house break a well
established habit and read Ibis column clear down
to here, I know I'm going to be accused of a lot
of things. Three sepaarte brothers have pub
licly announced the loss of three packages of cig
arettes. Two banks have been stolen from the
house this year. Once we had a coke box. At the
end of the month 20 bottles were missing and un
acocuntcd for.
I didn't take any of that stuff. I want to make
that very clear.

I didn't take any of that stuff. I want to make
that very clear.
It's one thing staying up late at night. It's another
thing being up late at night writing a column. Without
a funny story to your name.
That's probably very profound. I have noticed that
things get more profound in direct proportion to the
lateness of the hour—up until about 4:30 in the morn
ing, when you get just silly, or very sleepy and in
clined to dislike people.
Also, somewhat profoundly, I iust realized how
different everything is after midnight. I mean
right here on our own little Farm. It's quiet, like
in a deaf man's head. It's so quiet it buzzes.
I'm quite positive that if I went outside and yelled
I'd hear an echo.
And it's quiet here at the house, too. It's one
of those nights when most of the hoys turned off
their radios before they went to bed. It's even
quiet over at the Libe. A lot of good that does
anyone.
But then there are those very, very beautiful rec
ord programs to keep you entertained. Yeah. All the
announcers on them are very bad. If they are not
very bad, they are very sleepy.
At any rate, one and all, they mumble. Every
hour they make more dedications than Jimmy Walker
has in a lifetime. Listening to them you are pain
fully aware how limited people's vocabularies are
when they come around to dishing out names for their
cute little sons and daughters. You hear exactly the
same names, over and over again, in somewhat dif
ferent arrangements, dedicating and being dedicated
to—and I don't think that's because the same dozen
people do all the dedicating on all the programs. Be
sides, I have heard three Mr. X's dedicating or being
dedicated songs so far tonight. What lively imagina
tions some people have.
And one way to find out what songs were
popular three months ago is to listen t«• those rec
ord programs for a night. If you listen two nights,
you tan almost tell what order they will come in.
On the program I'm listening to now (that's
certainly going to look funny when it comes out
in Wednesday's paper), the announcer just gave
the name of a song and then added, "I knew that
would come sooner or later."
We both knew.
One thing about being up late is that you always
run out of cigarettes, and then you can go around
the house like someone with a reward out for him
and a series of numbers under his name trying to
find what your friends and brothers have done with
their cigarettes. They can hide them in the most
fiendish places, let me tell you. But if you are any
good at all, you can find them.
If any of the boys in (he house break a well
established habit and read Ibis column clear down
to here, I know I'm going to be accused of a lot
of things. Three sepaarte brothers have pub
licly announced the loss of three packages of cig
arettes. Two banks have been stolen from the
house this year. Once we had a coke box. At the
end of the month 20 bottles were missing and un
acocuntcd for.

that very clear.
