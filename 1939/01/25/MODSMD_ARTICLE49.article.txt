### HARVA SPRAGER 
Combining a piano concert with a lesson in music history, theory and
execution, composer, pianist. Conductor Pcrcy Grainger was presented
to Stanford by the Committee on Public Exercises as part of the Tuesday
Evening Series.
Mr. Grainger preceded most of his selections with short exnlanations

which were thoroughly
They were accompanied by ges- I
tures, piano illustrations, and Mr.
Grainger's tenor voice.
In his execution of his program,
Mr. Grainger displayed the qualities !
which have made him the world- i
famous artist that he is — the mu- I
sieianship of a composer; the feel
ing and depth of a conductor; the j
execution of a pianist.
Mr. Grainger opened his program |
with J. S. Bach's "Tocacta and Fugue j
D Minor of Organ." He pro- ;
duced remarkable effects, making j
the piano sound like an organ as |
he captured the Baroque style of j
which Bach is typical.
CIIOPIN OUTSTANDING
The Larog movement from "So
nata in B Minor, Opus 58" by Cho
pin was one of the most beautiful
parts of the program. The German,
French ,and Russian motifs in this
sonata were brought out and played
in their characteristic styles.
"Missisippi Floodtide" and "Spirit
of '39" by Lewis Slavit, young
American composer, were presented
for the first time last night. The
music was thoroughly American
and Mr. Slavit was extremely lucky |
to have them first performed by
Mr. Grainger for his interpretation
of them left nothing to be desired.
CLOSES WITH OWN WORKS
Mr. Grainger closed his program i
with two of his compositions, "Co
lonial Song" and "Hunter in His
Career," played with a familiarity
and ease which gave them the air
and charm of improvised composi
tions.
His own ever-popular "Country
Garden," done with the sly humor
which only comes when played by j
the composer, was the first encore, j
"Londondary Air" arranged by Mr.!
Grainger and David Gunn's setting j
of "Turkey in the Straw," were the 1
other two encores.
It will be a long time before the j
success and enjoyment of the eve- j

Combining a piano concert with a lesson in music history, theory and
execution, composer, pianist. Conductor Pcrcy Grainger was presented
to Stanford by the Committee on Public Exercises as part of the Tuesday
Evening Series.
Mr. Grainger preceded most of his selections with short exnlanations

which were thoroughly
They were accompanied by ges- I
tures, piano illustrations, and Mr.
Grainger's tenor voice.
In his execution of his program,
Mr. Grainger displayed the qualities !
which have made him the world- i
famous artist that he is — the mu- I
sieianship of a composer; the feel
ing and depth of a conductor; the j
execution of a pianist.
Mr. Grainger opened his program |
with J. S. Bach's "Tocacta and Fugue j
D Minor of Organ." He pro- ;
duced remarkable effects, making j
the piano sound like an organ as |
he captured the Baroque style of j
which Bach is typical.
CIIOPIN OUTSTANDING
The Larog movement from "So
nata in B Minor, Opus 58" by Cho
pin was one of the most beautiful
parts of the program. The German,
French ,and Russian motifs in this
sonata were brought out and played
in their characteristic styles.
"Missisippi Floodtide" and "Spirit
of '39" by Lewis Slavit, young
American composer, were presented
for the first time last night. The
music was thoroughly American
and Mr. Slavit was extremely lucky |
to have them first performed by
Mr. Grainger for his interpretation
of them left nothing to be desired.
CLOSES WITH OWN WORKS
Mr. Grainger closed his program i
with two of his compositions, "Co
lonial Song" and "Hunter in His
Career," played with a familiarity
and ease which gave them the air
and charm of improvised composi
tions.
His own ever-popular "Country
Garden," done with the sly humor
which only comes when played by j
the composer, was the first encore, j
"Londondary Air" arranged by Mr.!
Grainger and David Gunn's setting j
of "Turkey in the Straw," were the 1
other two encores.
It will be a long time before the j
success and enjoyment of the eve- j
ning will be repeated at Stanford, i
