# Chapin's Debaters to Study Current Social Problems
## 
### 
Discussion based upon fresh ex
perience rather than on textbook
theory, propositions maintained by
personal verification of fact, rather
than by tautological disputation of
opposing forensic procedure, de
bates far removed from traditional
battles of sharp wits and dull jokes,
but dedicated to the presentation of
important sociological material — so
Professor Lee Chapin describes the
new era of debate which he ush
ered in this Christmas when he sent
four men to the Southwest to study
Indian life.
Debating, to him and to the debat
ers who work with him, means
more than argument on the plat
form. In his group of Stanford
debaters he sees an agency for
studying current social problems, of
gf-ithering material into presentable
form, and disseminating that mate
rial through every campus agency—
his own speakers and debaters, the
Daily, and in published form.
WIDER RANGE
As he sees it, debate at Stanford
can become more than apparently
isolated group of men and women
interested in speaking decisively; it
can, and should, he feels, become a
group whose work is spread far out
side the campus, and yet. in whose
actions the entire student body
may have a part and an interest.
These were the basic concepts
which he and his debating emis
saries devised for their three-year

schedule of trips to the Southwest,
as well as the trip which last year
sent debaters to Central America.

and Quad Photographer Howard
Roberts on a two weeks jaunt dur
ing Christmas vacation.
Starting early December 17, driv
ing two cars, the five men spent, a
night in Needles, California, before
moving on to Flagstaff, Arizona,
where they interviewed Dr. Coltom,
owner of the Museum of Northern
Arizona.
First entrance into Indian terri
tory came next day, when the night
was spent at Villade Cuberto, and
a visit made to the Navajo pueblo
of Acoma—a "sky city."
VISITS ALBUQUERQUE
Preliminary visits over, the quin
tet moved on to Albuquerque,
where Dr. Aberle, superintendent of
Southwest Indian Affairs, a grad
uate of Stanford, outlined an itin
erary for the next, week of travel.
Visits were made to numerous
pueblos, including Pueblo James,
where the government is carrying
on irrigation projects; the Univer
sity of Arizona project outside of
Santa Fe where an Indian village is
being reconstructed, and the Indian
pueblo of Santa Clara.
Most, interesting Indian territory
encountered, say the five, was the
district of Taos, outside Santa Fe,

1 where Indians still live in their an
cient communistic system.
Christmas Eve was spent in watch
ing Indian dance ceremonies around
Santa Fe, and Christmas in travel
ling on to El Paso. After a brief
stay there and a trip to Juarez,
Mexico, the five men hit the home
ward trail, arriving in the southern
part of the stato on the 27th.
Diaries were kept by each man,
and a photographic record of the
trip prepared by Howard Roberts,

I of the trip will be presented through
