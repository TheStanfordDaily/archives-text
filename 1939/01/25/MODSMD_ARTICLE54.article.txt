"GOING PLACES." currently
playing at the Stanford Theater.
Here's another racing picture, even
more trite than the last one and
not helped a bit by the presence of
Dick Powell.
"Going Places" involves the usual
Powell plot—he has to ride a horse

and he doesn't
know how to ride.
The girl (Anita
Louise) loves
horses and thinks
that Powell is a
famous sportsman
who can ride any
thing — you can
guess the rest.
Dick Powell
sings in his usual
sweetly smiling
fashion. Anyone

who has seen Bob Mallet's imper
■ sonation of him can't keep from
i laughing every time Powell is on
the screen. And Anita Louise isn't
much better. She wanders around
| stables during most of the picture
dressed in a formal that looks like
| a sheet. But the last straw is when
| she tries to sing.
But there is one redeeming fea
! ture in "Going Places" and that is
Louis Armstrong's trumpeting of
"Jeepers Creepers." He really
' swings it out and almost makes the
picture worth seeing. "
