# Y.W. Drive Opens; Goal Set at $800
## Far East Students To Benefit; Leaders Ask Aid for Cause 
### 
Workers began the canvass yes
terday for the annual Y.W.C.A.
Fund Drive. With a quota set at
$800, $500 of which will be used
for "Y" expenses, and the remain
der for the Far Eastern Student
Service Fund, Drive Committee
Head Virginia Sterry announced
that the collections were progress
ing well, though the results will not
be available till Thursday.
Commenting on the drive, Student
Manager Tom Killefer stated: "On
a campus as little actively interest
ed in national and international

problems as ours, the work of the
"Y" in connection with a peace pro
gram is especially noteworthy. Any
help this group may receive from
the campus will in itself be a pro
gressive step."

Carolyn Hibbard, head of Wom
en's Conference, says of the "Y":
"The "Y" is one of the few organi
zations on campus that is able and
glad to include in its friendly group
any and all Stanford women who
arc interested in the activities and
opportunities for friendship and
guidance it provides. This year the
"Y" lias meant a great deal to many
individuals and to the campus as a
whole, and I should think that one
of the best ways for each of us to
demonstrate that it should continue
to function effectively in Stanford
life would be to contribute as gen
erously as possible to the finance
drive."
Adding to the list of campus lead
ers who support the drive, Gretchen
Ahlswede, president of Women's
Council, said, "The purpose of the
"Y" is excellent, but it should have
more student interest and support.
It lends both social and cultural ad
vantages, but too few people avail
themselves of these advantages."
ROBLE SPONSOR
Putzie Hinrichs, head sponsor of
Roblc, expressed her opinion of the
"Y" work as follows: "I feel that
the most important and beneficial
work the "Y" does is to provide an
opening to any girl for getting into
campus activities and for the meet
ing of so many other people, which
would otherwise be impossible."
Tlie general steering committee in
charge of the drive includes: Mary
Kay Horton, "Y" president, Vir
ginia Sterry, general chairman,
Virginia McCloskey and Jean Hiler,
publicity, Leila Arthur, office chair
man, Olive Freeman, treasurer, and

ing well, though the results will not
be available till Thursday.
Commenting on the drive, Student
Manager Tom Killefer stated: "On
a campus as little actively interest
ed in national and international

problems as ours, the work of the
"Y" in connection with a peace pro
gram is especially noteworthy. Any
help this group may receive from
the campus will in itself be a pro
gressive step."
CONFERENCE HOLD
Carolyn Hibbard, head of Wom
en's Conference, says of the "Y":
"The "Y" is one of the few organi
zations on campus that is able and
glad to include in its friendly group
any and all Stanford women who
arc interested in the activities and
opportunities for friendship and
guidance it provides. This year the
"Y" lias meant a great deal to many
individuals and to the campus as a
whole, and I should think that one
of the best ways for each of us to
demonstrate that it should continue
to function effectively in Stanford
life would be to contribute as gen
erously as possible to the finance
drive."
Adding to the list of campus lead
ers who support the drive, Gretchen
Ahlswede, president of Women's
Council, said, "The purpose of the
"Y" is excellent, but it should have
more student interest and support.
It lends both social and cultural ad
vantages, but too few people avail
themselves of these advantages."
ROBLE SPONSOR
Putzie Hinrichs, head sponsor of
Roblc, expressed her opinion of the
"Y" work as follows: "I feel that
the most important and beneficial
work the "Y" does is to provide an
opening to any girl for getting into
campus activities and for the meet
ing of so many other people, which
would otherwise be impossible."
Tlie general steering committee in
charge of the drive includes: Mary
Kay Horton, "Y" president, Vir
ginia Sterry, general chairman,
Virginia McCloskey and Jean Hiler,
publicity, Leila Arthur, office chair
man, Olive Freeman, treasurer, and
Ruthelen List, workers' tea.

terday for the annual Y.W.C.A.
