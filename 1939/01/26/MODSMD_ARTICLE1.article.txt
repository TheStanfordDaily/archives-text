### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
/ iNE April clay in 1906 a great
.sandstone arch at the entrance
to the Stanford quad was shaken to
the ground, a heavy eclectic steeple
on the Memorial Church crashed
down upon the tiled roof. One man
a caretaker, was killed in the earth
quake—and Stanford is still talking.
Yesterday in the city of Chilian
in South Central Chile 10,000 peo
ple, one-fourth of its population,
were crushed to death in one of
the greatest natural disasters of our
generation. Chilian is only the cen
ter of Chile's agricultural and coal
mining district, where thousands
more are lying dead today. It will
be some time before we learn the
whole horrible truth about the
earthquake.
At this time when the world is
saturated with thoughts of war,
nature lias seen fit to show man
that he's just a piker when it
tomes to dealing out death. A
state of national emergency exists
today in Chile; tragedy has left
that narrow strip of land on the
west coast of South America pow
erless. It's difficult to keep from j
thinking that if a natural disaster I
had to strike yesterday, it's too
had it didn't pick a nation that
threaten the world's peace.

INSTEAD of putting on a big old
fashioned show by marching vic
toriously into Barcelona, General
issimo Francisco Franco is using
his head and forcing the city to
surrender without his destroying it
and murdering the population.
Gradually his iron ring of Insurgent
troops is surrounding the doomed
Loyalist capital until only an eight
mile gap on the Mediterranean
coast Ls left open.
Through this breach are fleeing
the defenders of Barcelona, north
toward the French frontier. But, un
responsive Premier Daladier will al
low no Spaniard to cross the bor
der; so the refugees are assembling
in a tiny strip of neutral territory
that has been set up on the Spanish
side of the Pyrannees.
Within the walls of Barcelona
there are starvation and wreck- !
age, little else. One great, blast
from Franco's war machines could J
wipe out the city completely, hut
the Insurgent general has a heart
—and a head. He is forcing the
Lo. to surrender without
fighting, thereby avoiding need- I
less destruction of life and sav
ing Barcelona for a Rebel base.
Franco is so close to complete vic
tory in the Spanish Civil War that
international correspondents are
already considering whether or not
they will call it the Rome-Berlin-
Madrid axis.

i 1 ONE are the romantic days of
* intrigue in Italy: that charming
age of Michiavelli and the Borgias
when no one said anything of im
portance in a voice louder than a
mutter. The subtlety and smooth
ness of Renaissance politics and
diplomacy are things of the past;
now Italy blasts like a public ad
dress system by Associated.
During the past weeks II Duce's
hig noise has all been directed
toward Paris; he abuses France in
his press, demands her colonies,
calls her a poltroon, and warns
her to keep her nose out of the
Spanish Civil War. At first
France, which is composed of sonic
50,000,000 extremely excitable
Frenchmen, was very annoyed
ahout Italy's attacks.
But now she is going about her
business with a sficks-and-stones
may-break-my-bones attitude. Pre
mier Daladier will allow her to give
no aid to the Spanish Loyalists, and
she is keeping busy arming herself
for the war that may come. Today
France is placing, with the United
States, an order for GOO fighting
planes. While she is sulking quietly
in her corner, she is getting set to
turn around and kick Italy in the
face.

r jPIHNGS are pretty quiet in the
United States today; Congress
and the President arc taking time
out for a breathing spell Ik-fore the
fur begins to fly again. Now Deal
ers claim that they have organized
sufficient. Democratic support in the
Senate to restore the $150,000,000
lopped off Roosevelt's relief bill by
the economical House. The proof of
the pudding probably will come in a
vote late this afternoon.
Leaders of the American Fed
eration of Labor, slill fussing and
fuming over (he Wagner Act,
yesterday asked Congress to cut
down flie powers of the Labor
Hoard and permit employers (o
make use of (lie act in union rep
resentation disputes. Results of
the move would be not only to
curb the board's power but to give
craft unions more protection in
the establishment of collective
bargaining units.
r | I HE Rumanian Iron Guard, the
Fascist bunch that was purged
early this winter, stirred up new
excitement yesterday with the dis
covery of their plot to blow up vital
communication centers and gov
ernment buildings in Budapest.
The 21 conspirators arrested un
doubtedly will bo treated with the
customary European remedy for
dangerous minorities.
