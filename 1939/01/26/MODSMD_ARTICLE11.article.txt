# New Dealer Discusses Valley Migratory Problem
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
Certain tilings I knew about Jona
than Garst: he was Regional Direc
tor of the Farm Security Admin
istration; he was the man respon
sible for the care of the thousands
of migrants who have come to Cali
fornia from the Dust Bowl; he was
anathema in the San Joaquin Val
ley, where I come from; and he was
to speak in the Women's Clubhouse
Thursday night, at which time he
would discuss the migratory worker
problem and show the government
film, "The Plow that Broke the
Plains." But I had never seen him,
had not ever known he lived in
Palo Alto. He would be the first
high official of the Roosevelt Ad
ministration I had ever met; and
since I thought he might perhaps be
able to throw a Little light upon
some things in it which had puzzled
me, I looked forward with a good
deal of interest to interviewing him.
THE MAN WHO KNOWS
He began by reading me the paper
which outlined what he was sup
posed to talk on tonight; he wasn't
quite sure, he said, and he read the
whole thing to me while he re
freshed his memory. He talks
slowly, with a slightly over-drawled
emphasis which goes perfectly with
the sardonic face and eyes and the
slightly twisted mouth. He is aver
age height, a man getting toward his
fifties; whether deliberately or un
consciously, he gives the impression
of being uninterested in particulars;
or perhaps it was simply that he
was too busy to be bothered. In
any case, there was apparent at

once a certain broad and generous
disregard for absolute fact.
To begin the interview, I asked
him about the migratory labor prob
lem. He was the regional director,
the man to go to, certainly. I told
him I knew something about it in a
general way, most people were be
ginning to; but I didn't know much
about its specific phases. Could he
tell me the number of workers now
in the valley?
He finished lighting his cigarette
before he spoke, tossed the match in
the fireplace and looked at me,
grinning a little.
"You're asking me to tell you the
impassible," he said.
I must have looked surprised, for
the grin deepened.
WORKING WEST
"I can't keep track of all the
people down there," he said. "It's
impossible. Too many of 'em; I can't
be running all over the state check
ing up; I don't know how many
there are. I do know this, however:
I think you can say that in the last
two or three years the number has
steadily gone down."
"Well," I said, "what about the
influx of people from the Dust Bowl
areas? It seems to me there's been
a big increase from there; we cer
tainly notice it in the valley, at any
rate."
He shrugged; his tone became a
little more earnest.
"Why," he said, "I don't believe
the Dust Bowl has had much effect
on the problem; I don't believe there
are very many Dust Bowl people
out here. I think the number com
ing in from there has just about
stopped now; it's been falling off
for months."
"Most of them around home are
from the Dust Bowl," I said.
"They're the ones you read about,
at any rate."
"Oh, sure," he said. "You read
about 'em, but I think if you were
to make a thorough study you'd find
that they are really pretty much in
the minority."
"Is any such survey being made?"
He looked surprised. "No."
"Then I don't suppose there's any

real way of knowing the exact num
ber, is there?"
"Not any way I know of,"' he said.
WE DON'T MOVE PEOPLE'
I took notes for a moment before
asking my next question. He start
ed to speak, thought better of it. I
went on.
"What's the long-range plan be
hind your program?" I asked. "What
are you going to do with these peo
ple? Are you going to attempt U>
send them back home and establish
them on their own farms again?"
His look said "No" before he did.
"We don't move people around,"
he said, almost impatiently. "We're
not going to take Americans and
force them to go where they don't
want to go. That isn't our job.
They came out here in answer to
propaganda by Chambers of Com
merce and the corporation farms,
and what we have to do is take care
of them when they can't find work."
"And you'i'e doing that through
these migratory camps?" I said.
"Yes," he said. "We have about
12 now—not all open at the present
time, but 12 altogether. We provide
toilet facilities, heat and light, basic
necessities."
FARMERS VILLE
"I've heard," I said, "that in the
camp at Farmersville the govern
ment has built its houses—"
"With tin roofs?" he said. "You
know, I've heard that too. I won
der if that's true? I'm going to go
down there and check up on that
one of these days."
"How is that handled?" I asked.
"Does that come through your office,
or—"
"Oh, yes," he said, "that's up to
me, all right. You sec, we let out
building out on a regular contract
ing basis. As a matter of fact, I
think I have heard about that
Farmersville business. It seems to
me they're going to put aluminum
paint on the roofs. That makes 'em
cooler; and then I believe they can
be opened up pretty much around
the sides. I guess they'll probably
want to do that." He laughed; and
thinking of 115 degree temperatures,
I was a little amused myself, if not
in quite the same way.
"What I've been trying to do," he
said, "is get all these little valley
towns to establish their own camps
under the federal slum-clearance
program. In that way we hope to
provide permanent homes."
"Supposing the town isn't equip
ped to care for these people?" I said.
"School facilities, and so on."
"All the teachers are paid out of
the state funds," he said. "It's only
a question of getting the space; and
as for the other things, all these
towns have the light, heating, and
sewage facilities to handle the
problem."
"But supposing they can't assimi
late them; supposing the migratory
worker takes the job of the man
who normally lives in their town."
"Why!" he said. "This is a free
country, and I never heard of any

way yet to stop Americans from
taking jobs from other Americans if
they were willing to work for them.
Have you?"
I had, but this was scarcely the
place to bring it up. So I said, "No,"
and he went on, his last remark
almost vehement.
'WE CAN'T WASTE TIME
"What I'm interested in as u Cali- i
fornian is helping those peqple!
There must be—l don't know how
many there are out there. Twenty
thousand — thirty thousand — forty
thousand—"
"There's no telling, is there?" I :
said; and I must have said it pleas- i
antly, for he smiled.
"There is not!" he said. "And if I '
have anything to say about it, there
won't be. It's an immediate problem
we have to solve, and we can't af
ford to waste time making surveys!"
For just a moment, aided by the
tone of his remark, so pragmatic,
so familiar, I seemed to see sum
med up in that shrewd face and
that vague, vague philosophy a
whole system of government, which
in six years has missed the greatest
opportunity any government ever
had for constructive social prog
ress.
But it was getting late, and time
for a deadline; and I had presumed
long enough. As we stood on the
lawn talking a moment before I
left, Mr. Garst remarked on the im
minence of a full moon, which he
said would soon stand high over
head. It was behind the trees to
me, but climbing in the car after we
had said good-night, I could see that
what he had said was true. Within
a week it will indeed stand high
over the campus and the town.
And it will stand over the valley,
too; the valley, where countless
thousands whose numbers neither
you, nor I. nor Mr. Garst will ever
know, drift without purpose and
without rest along the million
dollar highways of the Golden State.
