# New Dealer Discusses Valley Migratory Problem
## 
### ALLEN DRURY 
Certain tilings I knew about Jona
than Garst: he was Regional Direc
tor of the Farm Security Admin
istration; he was the man respon
sible for the care of the thousands
of migrants who have come to Cali
fornia from the Dust Bowl; he was
anathema in the San Joaquin Val
ley, where I come from; and he was
to speak in the Women's Clubhouse
Thursday night, at which time he
would discuss the migratory worker
problem and show the government
film, "The Plow that Broke the
Plains." But I had never seen him,
had not ever known he lived in
Palo Alto. He would be the first
high official of the Roosevelt Ad
ministration I had ever met; and
since I thought he might perhaps be
able to throw a Little light upon
some things in it which had puzzled
me, I looked forward with a good
deal of interest to interviewing him.
THE MAN WHO KNOWS
He began by reading me the paper
which outlined what he was sup
posed to talk on tonight; he wasn't
quite sure, he said, and he read the
whole thing to me while he re
freshed his memory. He talks
slowly, with a slightly over-drawled
emphasis which goes perfectly with
the sardonic face and eyes and the
slightly twisted mouth. He is aver
age height, a man getting toward his
fifties; whether deliberately or un
consciously, he gives the impression
of being uninterested in particulars;
or perhaps it was simply that he
was too busy to be bothered. In
any case, there was apparent at

once a certain broad and generous
disregard for absolute fact.
To begin the interview, I asked
him about the migratory labor prob
lem. He was the regional director,
the man to go to, certainly. I told
him I knew something about it in a
general way, most people were be
ginning to; but I didn't know much
about its specific phases. Could he
tell me the number of workers now
in the valley?
He finished lighting his cigarette
before he spoke, tossed the match in
the fireplace and looked at me,
grinning a little.
"You're asking me to tell you the
impassible," he said.
I must have looked surprised, for
the grin deepened.
WORKING WEST
"I can't keep track of all the
people down there," he said. "It's
impossible. Too many of 'em; I can't
be running all over the state check
ing up; I don't know how many
there are. I do know this, however:
I think you can say that in the last
two or three years the number has
steadily gone down."
"Well," I said, "what about the
influx of people from the Dust Bowl
areas? It seems to me there's been
a big increase from there; we cer
tainly notice it in the valley, at any
rate."
He shrugged; his tone became a
little more earnest.
"Why," he said, "I don't believe
the Dust Bowl has had much effect
on the problem; I don't believe there
are very many Dust Bowl people
