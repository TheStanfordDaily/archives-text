# Class Heads Confirm Excorn Plans
## Juniors, Seniors Hit Campus Problems In Discussion Meeting 
### 
Hitting the high and low spots of
Honor Code enforcement, Pie-regis
tration, Committee on Committees,
date planning, and the Bonfire, 45
junior and senior leaders last night
in general confirmed Ex Committee
action Tuesday night on similar
problems, added suggestions of then
own for future action.
Called by Ex Committee and aimed
to bring upper class leaders together
to consider student body democracy
in general and specific phases, the.
two-hour meeting found, in general,
that dates should be planned in ad
vance along lines on which Cardi
nals is working; that the Committee
on Committees is a natural evolu
tionary outcome of the activities
files system.
BONFIRE QUESTION
Concerning the Bonfire, less una
nimity on the question of changing
the site was recorded, but, for the
most part, the informal committee
held that the site could be changed
without affecting Big Game spirit,
yet, at the same time, doing away
with the more unfavorable aspects of
the ceremony. Suggestions were
made to provide more rigorous check
on material burned on the pyre.
Discussion was less specific on the
broader questions of pre-registration
and the Honor Code. Particular em
phasis was placed, in the former
question, on the necessity to include
junior transfers in pre-reg activities.
In regard to the latter, the sugges
tion was made by Chairman H. B.
Lee that the phrase be added: "nor
no one seen giving or receiving aid,"
to be signed with the customary "no
aid given or received." The idea,
though, according to Lee, working
in other schools, met with serious
opposition.
CODE DISCUSSION
"It would change the Code from
being based on honor to a system of
mass policing," said Ken Cuthbert
son, summing up arguments against
the plan. Most preferred emphasiz
ing freshman education on the Code,
and individual responsibility for
speaking to guilty persons rather
than being held responsible to out
side parties for observed infractions
of the Code.
Discussion bogged on the question
of jurisdiction of Committee on Com
mittees, though the group unani
mously agreed that such a group
should be founded. General opinion
was that a dictatorship shouJd not
be created, that committee heads
should reserve the right for final
choice of their own workers. It was
suggested that authority of the Com
mittee hold only to A.S.S.U. groups
and permanent class committees.
DATE DISSENSION
Dissension on the date-planning
scheme was recorded on the ques
tion of rigidity versus elasticity of
the pre-planned schedule. Some
felt that if the system were rigid,
new organizations would Ix? checked
in extending their activities. Op
posing speakers held that only a
rigid system was practical, that
loose planning would be no better
than the system now in use.
Chairman H. B. Lee, in closing
the session, complimented leaders
on their co-operative attitude in
discussing problems, added that val
uable suggestions had been received
which will guide Ex Committee and
other campus leaders in future ac
tion.
When occasion arises, he felt, sim
ilar meetings should be called. Min
utes of the discussion were kept,
will be sent to members present.
