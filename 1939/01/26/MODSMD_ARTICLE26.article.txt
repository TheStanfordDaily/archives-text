national sport is
gradually finding its way back
into the college limelight, and
Stanford is no exception. Unprece
dented increases in recent freshman
baseball rosters are a good sign.
When Bohhy Grayson and Harry
Shipkey took over the yearling
squad several years ago, tliey
couldn't get enough frosh to
gether to organize practice games.
The coaches had to pitch in them
selves, and usually they recruited
someone from the sidelines.
Now more than 40 freshmen look
forward every day to a few hours
on the frosh diamond. Grayson

coaches the base
and battery posi
tions, while Ship
key works with
vthe outfielders.
jPractice sessions j
include more
playing than fun- j
damentals.
It looks as!

though the frosh arc playing for the !
fun of it, but they'll average three '
games a week when their season !
gets under way, and if spirit is any '
indication, the Class of '42 will con- j
tinue its athletic prowess in base- !
ball.
RUSS SMl'i II stands on the mound j
and wings a left-handed curve that 1
ties up the best hitters. He seems I
to have unusual control for a j
southpaw, and he plays a brainy ;
game. If a good fast ball is hard to I
return, plenty of opponents will '
strike out when FREI) MEYER is |
doing the pitching.
LEE DcWITT makes an excellent j
target as a catcher, find is a fine I
hitter. Equally skilled with a catch- '
er s mit is HOB lIERINGER, whose j
name is a familiar one in Stanford l
baseball circles. While his two i
brothers were pitchers for the !
Cards, Bob turned out for short- !
stop and was moved to the home \
plate.
Two giants show most promise for j
the first-base spot. BILL GLUND- i
BERG, whose height makes him a
powerful hitter, was shifted from i
second. DAVE MACAULEY looks I
taller yet, and while he is a little
green at the position, he turns in a 1
fine performance.
Second base looks wide open at
present. About half a dozen fresh
men are trying out, but so far, I
there have been no particular i
standouts.
JIM Ml EC All V is probably the
most experienced man on the squad, '
and he plays third for the yearlings. ■
He is a legacy to the Stanford
mond, brother of the greatest short- j
stop in Card history. DICK KEND-
RfCK also does a fine job on third,! l
but he may be needed at second i
before the season gets under way. [
At short for the Papoose batters'
is I'AI L BEANTON, a versatile
light-foot with a good arm. JOHN
NY POLLOCK, another short stop

candidate, covers a lot of ground
fast and has uncanny ability in an
ticipating the direction of the ball.
JACK DITZ will see action behind
the pitcher by virtue of his fire and
chatter.
An abundance of likely candidates
fills the frosh outfield. MILT VUCl-

NICII is a tall left j
fielder, and if he
can hit the line
as he hits a base- j
ball, Stanford's |
newest football
prodigy will be a J
fine nucleus for!
the next frosh !
grid team.

fast as a hitter.
Dark horse of the squad is TOM j
BOYLE. He has climbed right up!
the ladder, and from recent ap- j
pearances, he may be one of the
ace freshman batters.
BUI) AMES, Daily .sports staff's j
pride on the diamond, has had lit- j
tie experience, but is going great j
guns in the outfield. He is a fine fly i
chaser and a spirited fire-ball.

JACK DITZ will see action behind
the pitcher by virtue of his fire and
chatter.
An abundance of likely candidates
fills the frosh outfield. MILT VUCl-

NICII is a tall left j
fielder, and if he
can hit the line
as he hits a base- j
ball, Stanford's |
newest football
prodigy will be a J
fine nucleus for!
the next frosh !
grid team.
JOH N N Y
S T U ft G EON

adds considerable speed to the I
yearling outfield. He is a good I
judge of fly balls, and has improved ,
fast as a hitter.
Dark horse of the squad is TOM j
BOYLE. He has climbed right up!
the ladder, and from recent ap- j
pearances, he may be one of the
ace freshman batters.
BUI) AMES, Daily .sports staff's j
pride on the diamond, has had lit- j
tie experience, but is going great j
guns in the outfield. He is a fine fly i
chaser and a spirited fire-ball.
