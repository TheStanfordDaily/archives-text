# Net Matches Get Under Way
## Coach Slates Heavy Practice Schedule 
### 
With balmy spring weather help
ing to round his squad into shape,
Coach Sherm Lockwood has outlined
a vigorous practice schedule for po
tential varsity and frosh netmen for
the three remaining weeks prior to
the opening of actual competition.
Only upset in varsity challenge
matches to date was Myron Fol
som's extra-set win over Bud Biork
man last week. Other victories
were scored by Bob Low, present
number one man, over Dave Brock
and by Lloyd Gates over Captain
Jim Seaver.
The pairings for this week pit Low
against Gates, Brock against Seaver,
and Folsom against Neil Ballard, last
year's frosh captain.
Coach Lockwood again tentatively
shifted his varsity doubles teams,
putting Seaver with Low, Gates with
Stan Owen, Brock with Folsom, and
Biorkman with Sherwood Arm
strong.
Larry Dee, spectacular frosh star,
continues to head the yearling list
with Mike Levee in the number two
spot. These two pair together to
top the doubles rankings.
The varsity team will take on the
California Tennis Club in the sea
son's opener on February 11.
