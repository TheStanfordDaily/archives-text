# Pueblo Indians Present Ancient-Modern Paradox
## 
### JACK BURTT 
The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico are living in a constant sway be
tween the age-old and the modern, according to Bob Putnam, debate
manager, one of four Farm debaters who toured the Indian country of
New Mexico during Christmas vacation.
"The Indians like ot be modern," Putnam explained. "Tliey like radios,

►they have a keen appreciation of
the technique of modern trade
which leads them into a good deal
of commercialism, and they are
] learning modern, effiicent methods
j of agriculture.
"But, in spite of this, they cling
j to old customs and traditions, hold
! ing secret rituals never witnessed
jby white men, dancing ancient
dances in weird costume, and pre
serving tribal unities carefully."
SELF-GOVERNING
The Pueblo Indians do not live on
reservations, but are rather the
residents of federal municipalities.
Each tribe has its own grant of land
from the federal government, and
Ls comparable to any self-governing
community.
The Indians carry on a near-Com
munistic existence in the Pueblos,
under the offiical leadership of a
governor elected by themselves
from the members of the tribe. In
one pueblo, Santa Clara, they hold
caucuses, nominate three or four
candidates for the governorship, and
then vote on printed ballots with
! rubber stamps in much the same
! way as many American communi
i ties do.
However, this governmental ma
• chinery is only a modern aspect of
' the Indian community in New Mex-
I ico. The real leadens of the tribes,
! virtual dictators, arc unknown.
! They stay quite behind the scenes,
! directing the life of the tribe.
LEADERS UNKNOWN
I The government has no particu
lar wish to discover these men, as it
has become the general policy to
treat the Indians with no interfer
| ence. But the government couldn't
| find out if it did want to. The only
j time these religious dictators ever
j appear in their actual capacity, even
I before their own people, is during
J the Kiva ceremonies—and no white
man has ever been inside of a Kiva
j during these ancient rites.
Traditional tribal ceremonies are j
combined almost, gratesqucly with
modern life and religion, according
Ito Putnam. The debaters attended
I a Christmas Eve celebration at Tu
i suque Pueblo in which this was
, well illustrated.
After meeting in a Kiva for most i
j of the evening, the tribe convened |
| at. the Catholic Church located at i
the pueblo and spent an hour or j
I more in silent prayer, chants and i
j singing Christmas hymns in Eng- |
lish. After this part of the cere- \
mony, some 40 braves danced into j
the church, painted wildly, huge!
j feathered head-dresses waving, and 1
j performed several ancient tribal !
j dances.
RITES EXIIIBITIONISTIC
And at. the conclusion of the!
ceremonies, the governor stood up, I
;iddi essed the visitors to the cole- '
l bration, thanked them for attend- j
I ing, and expressed the wish that j
I they might come back next year. ;
It seemed to make the ceremony
J almost a display, Putnam com
| mented This is nearly universal,;
however, and is a natural out- j
I growth of the modernization proc- j
j <\ss. The Indians have been shown
the ways of commercialism, and |
! seem to know that oturists are;
; worth money.
At the Acoma Pueblo, high on top
of a mesa in the midst of a bar
ren desert, the visitor is greeted,,
| after his hard climb, by a commit- i
tee of Indians displaying a huge
parchment. The parchment author
izes them to collect. $1 from each
tourist who visits the mesa. And
in the midst of the pueblo, sur
rounded by aged adobe buildings,
stands a general store, liberally cov
ered with Coca-Cola advertise
ments.
The Indian governors of the tribes
are fine, intelligent, and education
men, Putnam observed. They dis
played great hospitality and seemed
anxious to .have the visitors examine
the pueblos.
Each pueblo is different, making
the study of Indian life in New Mex
ico a matter of learning entirely
varying customs for each of the 19
pueblos. The dress of each is dis
tinctive— some of them go in for
brilliantly colored Sears and Roe
buck blankets while others prefer
cowboy costume.
Putnam concluded with the com
ment that "The Indians are a happy
people. Nothing seems to bother
them particularly. The new govern
ment policy of helping them preserve
their racial unity, instead of at
tempting to assimilate them, is re
sulting in the creation of self
sufficient groups of constructively
inclined people."
