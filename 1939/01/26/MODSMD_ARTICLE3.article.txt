# Pueblo Indians Present Ancient-Modern Paradox
## 
### JACK BURTT 
The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico are living in a constant sway be
tween the age-old and the modern, according to Bob Putnam, debate
manager, one of four Farm debaters who toured the Indian country of
New Mexico during Christmas vacation.
"The Indians like ot be modern," Putnam explained. "Tliey like radios,

►they have a keen appreciation of
the technique of modern trade
which leads them into a good deal
of commercialism, and they are
] learning modern, effiicent methods
j of agriculture.
"But, in spite of this, they cling
j to old customs and traditions, hold
! ing secret rituals never witnessed
jby white men, dancing ancient
dances in weird costume, and pre
serving tribal unities carefully."
SELF-GOVERNING
The Pueblo Indians do not live on
reservations, but are rather the
residents of federal municipalities.
Each tribe has its own grant of land
from the federal government, and
Ls comparable to any self-governing
community.
The Indians carry on a near-Com
munistic existence in the Pueblos,
under the offiical leadership of a
governor elected by themselves
from the members of the tribe. In
one pueblo, Santa Clara, they hold
caucuses, nominate three or four
candidates for the governorship, and
then vote on printed ballots with
! rubber stamps in much the same
! way as many American communi
i ties do.
However, this governmental ma
• chinery is only a modern aspect of
' the Indian community in New Mex-
I ico. The real leadens of the tribes,
! virtual dictators, arc unknown.
! They stay quite behind the scenes,
! directing the life of the tribe.
LEADERS UNKNOWN
I The government has no particu
lar wish to discover these men, as it
has become the general policy to
treat the Indians with no interfer
| ence. But the government couldn't
| find out if it did want to. The only
j time these religious dictators ever
j appear in their actual capacity, even
I before their own people, is during
J the Kiva ceremonies—and no white
man has ever been inside of a Kiva
j during these ancient rites.
Traditional tribal ceremonies are j
combined almost, gratesqucly with
modern life and religion, according
Ito Putnam. The debaters attended
I a Christmas Eve celebration at Tu
i suque Pueblo in which this was
, well illustrated.
After meeting in a Kiva for most i
j of the evening, the tribe convened |
| at. the Catholic Church located at i
the pueblo and spent an hour or j
I more in silent prayer, chants and i
j singing Christmas hymns in Eng- |
lish. After this part of the cere- \
mony, some 40 braves danced into j
the church, painted wildly, huge!
j feathered head-dresses waving, and 1
j performed several ancient tribal !
j dances.
RITES EXIIIBITIONISTIC
And at. the conclusion of the!
ceremonies, the governor stood up, I
;iddi essed the visitors to the cole- '
l bration, thanked them for attend- j
I ing, and expressed the wish that j
I they might come back next year. ;
It seemed to make the ceremony
J almost a display, Putnam com
| mented This is nearly universal,;
however, and is a natural out- j
I growth of the modernization proc- j
j <\ss. The Indians have been shown
the ways of commercialism, and |
! seem to know that oturists are;
; worth money.
At the Acoma Pueblo, high on top
of a mesa in the midst of a bar
ren desert, the visitor is greeted,,
