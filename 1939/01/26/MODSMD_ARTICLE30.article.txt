## JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor Delts Trounce Theta Chi, 74-6 In Mural Tilt New lulling Ejects Double Defaulters, Stojkovich Reveals 
### 
Revenge was sweet and decisive
j for the Delta Tau Deity I team last
1 night, which after seeing their
1 number II team topple to defeat
30-G, completely smashed a Theta
i Chi quintet 74 to 6. Jack Earhart,
with 20 points, Ken Cuthbertson,
with Hi, and George Dole at 14,
I helped the winners roll up their
j tremendous total.
| The 30 to (5 setback suffered by
the Delt II team came at the hands
j of Theta Xi I. Good defensive work

by "all hands" and sharpshooting
by Hugh O'Donnell contributed to
the Theta Xi triumph.
Rolling slowly in the first half,
tanking only 6 points, the El Capi
tal! I five gathered momentum to
roll over Alpha Sigma Phi I 20-8.
High scorers for the eating club
team were Bill Bailey with 10 mark
ers and Charles Roberts with 6.
Again the schedule was marred by
a default. By failure to arrive with
in 10 minutes of the scheduled start
ing time, Chi Psi II forfeited their
game to Delta Upsilon I 1 to 0. A
new ruling by Intramural Manager
Andy Stojkovich decrees that any
team which defaults twice will be
automatically dropped from its
league and will have points deduct
ed from its intramural total. This
new regulation is an attempt to
remedy the epimedic of defaults
prevalent during the present bas
ketball schedule.
In the closest fought game of the
evening, El Toro I turned back a
fighting Fiji quintet 36-27. Lanky
Jack Butler led the victorious Bulls
with 19 points and Intramural Man
ager Andy Stojkovich took a vaca
tion from his administration duties
to chalk up 9 points for the winning
cause.
