# Louis Cools Lewis In First Round K.O.
## 
### MARGE HOVEY 
Joe Louis blasted John Henry
Lewis onto the canvas with a tech
nical knockout last night after the
world's heavyweight championship
bout had gone only 2 minutes and
29 seconds into the first round.
John Henry had his back against ;
the ropes almost from the start of
the fight as Joe Louis peppered him
with rights and lefts to the face.!
Twice Lewis went down, but each J
time staggered up without a count ,
only to meet the crushing blows of j
the champion.
After a little over 2 minutes of
fighting, Joe Louis delivered a
smashing right to the body that was I
the winning blow. He followed with !
a left to the jaw that barely con- :
nected but was enough to send John I
Henry down for the count of six, i
when Referee Arthur Donovan j
stopped the fight.
Louis barely used his left hand, I
but smashed Lewis with rights to i
the body that were too much for the j
smaller man. The challenger was'
completely outclassed and didn't j
even get to think about anything I
except defense.
Louis' easy victory wasn't much '
of a surprise to boxing experts, as I
he is at the peak of his career now,
while Lewis passed his a couple of j
years ago. The odds were boosted
to 7-1 in favor of Joe just before j
the bout.
With the defeat of John Henry j
last night, there was much specula- |
tion as to who would be the next !

to meet the champion. Tony Galento
and Max Baer both think they
should have a crack at the title but
some experts think California's Lou
Nova is next in line.

An average of 1080 vessels per
month have called at the port of
Oakland for the last 15 years.
