champion, and member of the all-
American collegiate swim team for
the past two years, will have his

the diminutive Adams, top diver of
the Far-Western A.A.U.
Adding to the interest of compe

live Olympic dives in addition to
live optionals.
The Olympic requirements will
call for more difficult and more
sensational performances.

into shape as a top-notch board
man, will also compete. Nicolls'
present performances mark him as
a comer in this event.
Sharing top interest in the meet
will be the rapid pace set in the
50-yard free-style event, in which

Clarke, senior, are expected to end

from each other, the winner taking
the title by inches.

shorter race in thrills and excite
ment, with Clarke, Brahtz and
Miller competing in a race that can
