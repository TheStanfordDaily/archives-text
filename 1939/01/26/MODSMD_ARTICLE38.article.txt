# Speaking for Peace

BACKED by a list of prospective speakers
which reads like a Government "Who's
Who," Chairman Bob Livingston of Peace Day
turned up before Ex Committee Tuesday night
with arguments so plausible that that occasion
ally august body kicked through with $200 and
a tentative promise of more if necessary.
Headed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull
and including Senators Nye and Norris and
ex-President Benes of Czechoslovakia, the list
is the Utopian kind which sometimes stands a
better chance of getting somewhere than one
less ambitious. The committee acts in the name
of a college, one of the best known in the
country; and although previous engagements
and the press of official business will serve to
shear off many names, it does not seem too
improbable that the Peace Day speaker will
come from among those proposed.
If that proves the case, Stanford will have a
Peace Day to match the peace spirit which has
developed since the observance first started
some three or more years ago. And it will have
a Peace Day which continues a practical tra
dition.
While other campuses go on strike for peace,
the Farm will gather in Memorial Hall to hear
a distinguished leader in the fight for peace.
Possibly there will be a panel discussion, of
the sort which last year pitted Chappie Editor
Bob Hartmann against student organizer Ce
leste Strack. There may—although in the light
of past experience it seems improbable—be a
constructive contribution to the problem; at
least there will be a sincere and positive at
tempt to make such a contribution.
It is because the Farm's Peace Day goes a
little farther than most in the direction of solid
achievement that it has become one of the
most stable of Stanford's transitory traditions.
If Bob Livingston and his committee can get
as a good a speaker as they want, the gesture
in this troubled 1939 will more than justify
any outlay Excom cares to make.—A. S. D.
