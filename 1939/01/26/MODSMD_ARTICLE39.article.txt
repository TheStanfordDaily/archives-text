WITH preliminary work nearing its end, the
third alumni appeal of the Stanford Fund
will soon be sent to Farm alumni and graduat
ing seniors.
This year, the appeal will stress two main,
ideas: gifts for specific purposes are encour
aged; it is the only appeal for funds made on
behalf of the entire University.
Lying behind the entire idea are the figures
that Stanford, once first in endowment, now
ranks tenth in comparison with other American
universities; that where Stanford has received
approximately 10 millions of dollars in gifts
and bequests from 1920 to 1937, universities
such as Yale and Harvard have received from
130 to 156 millions of dollars.
The fund is not asking gifts in particular
amounts—it stresses only the fact that a one
dollar gift to Stanford annually is worth the
return on $25 of endowment for a year.
Purpose the money is used for is not obscure.
It can be traced directly to its destination, either
through preliminary ear-marking by the donor
or by watching annual emergency expendi
tures.
The fund is designed to meet the needs of
the University as they arise.
The return Stanford men and women receive
from their donations is in the abstract—the
knowledge that the quality of the University is
being protected, the satisfaction that they may
have a part in maintaining Stanford's high
standards.
Which is worth far more than an off-hand
evaluation would indicate.
The Stanford label worn by the individual
is worth only so much as the present and future ,
Stanford graduates make it; the Stanford Fund
is used to maintain the quality of that label.
Giving a dollar, when the time comes, then,
will be an easy way to protect the $4,000 invest
ment that most Stanford men and women make
in their education.— H. L. S.
