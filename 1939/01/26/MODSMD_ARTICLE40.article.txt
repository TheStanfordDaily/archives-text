# BULL SESSION
## IT'S STILL YOUR BABY 
### JOHN COBBS 
IT WAS not my intention to preach a holy war or
call for a blood purge yesterday when I pointed out
how Stanford's administration cracks the executive
whip over student government. I have no desire to
see barricades erected on the Quad, and I have no
intention of leading a march on the Ad Building. But
I would like to remind tho administration that re
sponsibility and power are Siamese twins. If Stan
ford's executives work the switches, they should have
no complaint with the track student government takes.
I do not intend to wander off into the psycholog
ical backwoods, attempting to analyze the administra
tion's motivation. Probably most of the pressure it
puts on student representatives is unconscious. After
years of trial and error tinkering with the machinery
it has fallen into the convenient habit of making
suggestions that are really commands.

But even if the administration didn't know it was
loaded, the fact remains that student government goes
through its act only after careful coaching from the
executives. The gentle suggestions that look so inno
cent standing alone acquire divine authority when
clothed in the majesty of official stationery.
The University authorities have all the prestige
of seniority and experience. Moreover, the students
have to depend on them for scholarships and job
recommendations. When the executives speak they
cash in on all the authority that the University has
accumulated during the past 50 years.

on being tossed to the lions, but. he is sure to go under

impudent young pup.
Typical of the way administrative pressure works
was "l'affaire majorette" last quarter. Women's Con
ference started the party going, which may or may not
be significant in view of the rapport between Confer
ence and the Dean of Women's Office. Ex Committee
considered the subject on the night of November 16,
and decided that at current exchange rates, whirling
red skirts were worth more than Conference's pride.

the President. "No one not a student is to partici

Presumably Dr. Wilbur was only calling attention
to the A.S.S.U. constitution. But the constitution reads
simply, "represent Stanford in any intercollegiate activ
ity." Dr. Wilbur's suggestion became a piece of
executive legislation.
If the President's letter had come half a day earlier,
Ex Committee would have had to choose between
reciting its lines like good little children, and acting
in direct defiance of the President's decree.

Another example is interesting. Last spring Confer
ence took a deep breath and passed a rule permitting
two women to go together to men's living groups with
out chaperones. Authorities were distressed.
This fall freshmen were told that the rule was to
be changed, that women should not enter men's liv
ing quarters except under the guns of a protecting
ehaperone. Somewhat later the dean had Conference
up for dessert and advised them that they must be
more careful about hasty action. Of course they didn't
realize what they were doing, but trouble might result
from such careless legislation.

Perhaps' the administration knows best. Certainly
it acts on that assumption. But even so, that doesn't
explain why Stanford executives are complaining that
student government is inefficient. It may be that the
administration needs to have its hands slapped, but
it is surprising to see it doing it itself.
