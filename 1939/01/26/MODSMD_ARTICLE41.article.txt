All that noise which sounded like there was at
least a three-alarm fire on the campus early this
morning was nothing but half the fire trucks on the
Peninsula racing up the Row to throw a little cold
water on a smouldering car.
Their sirens woke up half the campus. The half
that, didn't want to get up for eight o'clocks.
A friend of mine tells me that the guy who owns
the car which was on fire has been having trouble
starting it these days.
My friend claims the guy built a fire under it this
morning to get it to start.
He started plenty, including a whispering campaign
on our sleeping porch that all of Encina was on fire,
so what the hell if we did get a small pledge class.
And a guy from one house tells me that, the sirens
got. their awakener up on time for the first time this
quarter.
On the one morning when they didn't need him.

That new record machine in the cellar caught the
practical eye of one of the practical men in the prac
tical Business School yesterday.
He looked at it for a minute, analyzing it closely,
and then pushed all the record buttons "on" and sat
down to wait.
It didn't take long. A stupid undergraduate came
in with his girl, went up to the machine, selected his
song, put a nickel in, and pushed the button "off."
Then he and his gal went over lo the counter and,
smiling contentedly in a wine-woman-and-song sort
of way, ordered a coke.
The record machine started to play. But it wasn't
the song he had ordered. He was very puzzled. The
guy from the Business School was quietly gloating.
The piecc ended. The guy put another nickel in
and went through the same procedure.
The same wrong song came out. The light was be
ginning to go out of the guy's life.
By the time that had happened the third time, no
one was having any fun but the fiuy in the Business
School.
The guy and his girl got up and left. Fifteen cents
to hear a song he didn't like three times!
And as they went out past the cigar stand, the
radio was playing the same song.

Some time ago a friend of mine was taking a trip,
and he stopped at some wayside joint to get lunch.
Among other things he ordered a glass of milk.
The milk, when it came, was butter milk. He had
the waitress come and take it away and bring another
glass of milk.
This time the milk was in a glass, not in a bottle.
Tlie guy tasted it. It was sour.
He got the waitress over again. "This milk is sour."
The waitress looked at him. "You know." she
said, "that's what I thought."

Then he and his gal went over lo the counter and,
smiling contentedly in a wine-woman-and-song sort
of way, ordered a coke.
The record machine started to play. But it wasn't
the song he had ordered. He was very puzzled. The
guy from the Business School was quietly gloating.
The piecc ended. The guy put another nickel in
and went through the same procedure.
The same wrong song came out. The light was be
ginning to go out of the guy's life.
By the time that had happened the third time, no
one was having any fun but the fiuy in the Business
School.
The guy and his girl got up and left. Fifteen cents
to hear a song he didn't like three times!
And as they went out past the cigar stand, the
radio was playing the same song.

Some time ago a friend of mine was taking a trip,
and he stopped at some wayside joint to get lunch.
Among other things he ordered a glass of milk.
The milk, when it came, was butter milk. He had
the waitress come and take it away and bring another
glass of milk.
This time the milk was in a glass, not in a bottle.
Tlie guy tasted it. It was sour.
He got the waitress over again. "This milk is sour."
The waitress looked at him. "You know." she
said, "that's what I thought."

All that noise which sounded like there was at
least a three-alarm fire on the campus early this
morning was nothing but half the fire trucks on the
Peninsula racing up the Row to throw a little cold
water on a smouldering car.
Their sirens woke up half the campus. The half
that, didn't want to get up for eight o'clocks.
A friend of mine tells me that the guy who owns
the car which was on fire has been having trouble
starting it these days.
My friend claims the guy built a fire under it this
morning to get it to start.
He started plenty, including a whispering campaign
on our sleeping porch that all of Encina was on fire,
so what the hell if we did get a small pledge class.
And a guy from one house tells me that, the sirens
got. their awakener up on time for the first time this
quarter.
On the one morning when they didn't need him.

That new record machine in the cellar caught the
practical eye of one of the practical men in the prac
tical Business School yesterday.
He looked at it for a minute, analyzing it closely,
and then pushed all the record buttons "on" and sat
down to wait.
It didn't take long. A stupid undergraduate came
in with his girl, went up to the machine, selected his
song, put a nickel in, and pushed the button "off."
Then he and his gal went over lo the counter and,
smiling contentedly in a wine-woman-and-song sort
of way, ordered a coke.
