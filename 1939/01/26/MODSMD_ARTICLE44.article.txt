## WHY WAR PILOTS? 
### 
The Editor Sir:
Congrats to A.S.D. for his edi
torial on Stanford's proposed air
training school. I have been won
dering for many weeks when some
body would contribute some perti
nent comments on this issue.
Why is it such a "fitting recogni
tion" of our Class A sportsmen fly
ers that we scramble in the manner
of small town politicians for a
handout from this latest pork bar
rel? Why is it appropriate that
Stanford, a stronghold of higher
education and intellectual integrity,
be subsidized as a training school
for robot pilots for our irresistibly
expanding war machine?
What place does this have in a
university curriculum, when con
trasted with our highly scientific
aeronautical engineering course?
Finally, why must our students be
exposed to a politically-adminis
tered, regimented training in one of
the most dangerous of skills, flying
â€”especially military flying?
Must even Stanford fall guilty to
the hypocrisy of indulging in the
vitx-iolic criticism of the strangling
of higher education in the totali
tarian states by the encroachments
of the political and military ma
chines, and then submit to similar
inroads here as joyful, unquestion
able sheep?
