# SPACE TO MOVE IN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I am a transfer student, and I
like Stanford. I like the Stanford
Library so much that I spend most
of my time there. It is a great
library. The lighting is good, the
students are quiet, the books are
available, but there is one section
of the building which I have occa
sion to visit from time to time and
which I find always crowded.
Such a situation is, to say the
least, inconvenient. Since I am from
a farm, I don't care much about
style, but I do miss the proper fa
cilities. I should like to see Chic
Sale put to work.
Waiting
