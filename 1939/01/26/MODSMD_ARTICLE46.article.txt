The Editor, Sir:
I heartilf agree with '39, '40, '41,
'42, and Grad, that Stanford ought
to have a chess club. Chess is the
greatest sedentary game in exist
ence. Other games are invented,
have their day, and die; but chess
seems to go on forever. We ought
to have at Stanford some organiza
tion devoted to it.
There must be, on the campus, a
respectable number of chess play
ers, but they are scattered and un
known to one another, so that they
have no way of getting together.
Some way of giving them the oppor
tunity to play is needed. A chess
club would fill this need.
