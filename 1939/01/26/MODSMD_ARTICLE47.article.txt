The Editor, Sir:
It's a helluva note when you can't
park your car in front of Encina
because it is slightly ancient.
Tonight the night watchman came
around and said for us to move
"Dorothy," our car of slightly aged
vintage, from the front of Encina
into the back because it is an "eye
sore."
We were also told if we didn't
move it, the corporation yard crew
would walk away with it and put
it in cold storage. The idea iso
the dog pound trend—pay to
your dog or car out if your ca» .
ragged or your dog is without a

Do you have to have a '38 Cad
illac to park around here?
