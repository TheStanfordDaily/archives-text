### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25 (UP).-
It wouldn't happen once in two life
times, but it happened today to Or
ville Austin. He strolled into a hotel
lobby to inquire the time of the day
of the clerk, Daniel May. May pulled
out his watch and Austin yelled for
police, who detained the clerk on
suspicion of burglary. Austin said
it was his watch, stolen from a
jewelry repair shop several months
ago.
