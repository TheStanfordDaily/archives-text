the gates of Stanford
University nearly 4000 young
men and women live in a private
world, unconscious of the war that
threatens Europe. Only appointees
to peace and international commit
tees, a few of the non-polo playing

eral students who self-consciously
scorn English Corner's small talk
realize that the international situa
tion is as dangerous now as it was
in those sunny September days
just before the Munich Conference.
On the Continent every young
man of university age is being
trained to fight in the next war, is
learning about bombs and trenches
and poison gas. The youth of Eu
rope is supremely aware that he
must be prepared for a world con
flict at any moment.

QNE warm night last summer I
lay sleeping on my bunk in a
Youth Hostel in Amsterdam; a
.young German with whom I had
explored the city during the day
was on the bed opposite mine. I
awoke to find him supporting his
head on his elbow, staring at me.
lie smiled half-seriously, leaned
toward me ,and whispered, "Would
n't it be awful if we should be stick
ing bayonets into each other a year
from now?" Then and only then,
the realization struck home; maybe
we aren't as safe and happy as we
think we are at Stanford.
>{< >it *
AY/HEN my German friend spoke
to me, neither of us had the
slightest suspicion that within 45
days the Czechoslovakian crisis
would menace the peace of Europe.
There have been a great many war
scares since 1920, and as yet a
major international conflict has been
avoided; yet we must look facts in
the face and realize that war can
come.
Thank God that Stanford men
and women can sleep through 8
o'rlocks, drink cokes in the Cellar,
ogle each other in the Lihe. Thank
God we're not busy learning how
to make war. But let us not for
get that there are thousands just
like us who are learning the art
of legalized murder this morning
—and not enjoying it any more
than we would.

jyjUSSOLINI celebrated the In
surgent capture of Barcelona
yesterday with one of his usual
speeches to the populus romanus as
sembled in the Piazza Venizia be
low the windows of his office.
Again the theme of the meeting was
"to hell with France," and II Duce
interspersed his congratulations to
Franco and the Italian troops in
Spain with thinly-veiled insults and
threats for the French.
As usual the Romans were the
perfect audience; wild-eyed students j
shouted "On to Paris," and the rest
of the mob responded with the old
chorus, "Nice, Savoy, Corsica, Dji
bouti, Tunis," a complicated but
significant refrain.

amateur theatricals that Mussolini
presents but they are keeping
sharp eyes on certain Italian
schemes that arc concocted of i

France is afraid that II Duce will
drive his support of the Spanish In
surgents to a practical end by mak- i
ing Majorca and some of the other
Balearic Islands air bases from
which he can threaten the French
colonial empire in North Africa.
However, before Mussolini puts
that one over, he will have to reckon
with the British, who are sure to re
sent. any hazard on the road through
the Mediterranean between England
and India. Certain it is that Italy's
ambitions constitute such a hazard,
that. II Duce will face powerful
Anglo - French opposition if he
makes a grab for lands, rights, or
air-bases on the Mediterranean
Sea.

AY/HEN my German friend spoke
to me, neither of us had the
slightest suspicion that within 45
days the Czechoslovakian crisis
would menace the peace of Europe.
There have been a great many war
scares since 1920, and as yet a
major international conflict has been
avoided; yet we must look facts in
the face and realize that war can
come.
Thank God that Stanford men
and women can sleep through 8
o'rlocks, drink cokes in the Cellar,
ogle each other in the Lihe. Thank
God we're not busy learning how
to make war. But let us not for
get that there are thousands just

of legalized murder this morning
