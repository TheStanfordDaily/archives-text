# Inter-Union Strife Blocks Industrial Advance, Says Eliel
## 
### 
No one ever gains anything from a
jurisdictional strike, according to
Professor Paul Eliel, Director of the
Division of Industrial Relations of
the Graduate School of Business,
and everyone involved—labor un
ions, public, and employers—suffers.
DOUBLE CLAIM
Discussing the topic which will
form the chief subject of the Stu
dent-Worker Conference, to be held
this Sunday afternoon from 2:30 to
5:30 o'clock in the Women's Club
house, Professor Eliel defined the
jurisdictional strike as "a dispute
between two unions, both claiming
sovereignty over a given economic
area."
Three different types were cited
by Mr. Eliel. First is the struggle
for power between rival unions—in
most cases the A. F. of L. and the
C.1.0. Second is caused by a change
in some mechanical art, resulting in
a substitution of one crafts union j
for another. Last and rarest type '
occurs when an employer attempts !
to substitute a craft paying lower 1
wages for one paying higher wages. !
LABOR AGITATION
Pointing to a specific case of the
first type, Professor Eliel spoke of j
the fifiht between the Teamsters'|
Union and the Brewers' Union in I
Michigan; a contest as to which will !
drive the beer trucks engaged in
intra-state commerce. This argu- i
ment, he stated, has been before the 1
A. F. of L. for 37 years, and is in a
constant state of agitation.
Commenting on the jurisdictional
strike and the National Labor Rela
tions Act, Professor Eliel stated that
the National Lalx>r Relations Board '

has no authority to decide in such
cases. Nor does he believe that any
amendment of the Act in this Con
gress will provide such authority.
A. F. OF L. SPEAKER
"Most of the amendments which
will come up," he said, "will be
on matters of procedure. It seems
unlikely .that any attempt will be
made to change the basic policies of
Ihc Act. Jurisdictional strikes will
probably not be touched."
A worker's view of the question
will be provided this Sunday after
noon when John McGuire, a member
of the Executive Committee of the
San Francisco A. F. of L. Central
Labor Council, speaks in the Wom
en's Clubhouse in connection with
the annual Student-Workers Con
ference. A participant in the gen
eral strike of 1034 and the recent
warehouse strike, Mr, McGuire will
emphasize in his discussion some of
the most pressing problems now fac
ing the city's labor and employment
leaders.

Also on the program will be Miss
Marget Larson, a member of the ex
ecutive committee of the Retail
Clerks, Local 1100, of San Francisco,
who will speiik on "The Value of a
Worker's Education in My Union

tives of all campus living groups.

ing the city's labor and employment
leaders.
IIEI)I,EY IS CHAIRMAN
Also on the program will be Miss
Marget Larson, a member of the ex
ecutive committee of the Retail
Clerks, Local 1100, of San Francisco,
who will speiik on "The Value of a

Work."
The Conference, chairmancd by
Dr. George C. Hedley, director of
the Pacific Coast School for Work
ers. will be sponsored by a campus
committee made up of representa
tives of all campus living groups.
Women's Conference, and the Y.W.
C.A. It will run from 2:30 to 5:30
o'clock.
No one ever gains anything from a
jurisdictional strike, according to
Professor Paul Eliel, Director of the
Division of Industrial Relations of
the Graduate School of Business,
and everyone involved—labor un
ions, public, and employers—suffers.
DOUBLE CLAIM
Discussing the topic which will
form the chief subject of the Stu
dent-Worker Conference, to be held
this Sunday afternoon from 2:30 to
5:30 o'clock in the Women's Club
house, Professor Eliel defined the
jurisdictional strike as "a dispute
between two unions, both claiming
sovereignty over a given economic
area."
Three different types were cited
by Mr. Eliel. First is the struggle
for power between rival unions—in
most cases the A. F. of L. and the
C.1.0. Second is caused by a change
in some mechanical art, resulting in
a substitution of one crafts union j
for another. Last and rarest type '
occurs when an employer attempts !
to substitute a craft paying lower 1
wages for one paying higher wages. !
LABOR AGITATION
Pointing to a specific case of the
first type, Professor Eliel spoke of j
the fifiht between the Teamsters'|
Union and the Brewers' Union in I
Michigan; a contest as to which will !
drive the beer trucks engaged in
intra-state commerce. This argu- i
ment, he stated, has been before the 1
A. F. of L. for 37 years, and is in a
constant state of agitation.
Commenting on the jurisdictional
strike and the National Labor Rela
tions Act, Professor Eliel stated that
the National Lalx>r Relations Board '

has no authority to decide in such
cases. Nor does he believe that any
amendment of the Act in this Con
gress will provide such authority.
A. F. OF L. SPEAKER
"Most of the amendments which
will come up," he said, "will be
on matters of procedure. It seems
unlikely .that any attempt will be
made to change the basic policies of
Ihc Act. Jurisdictional strikes will
probably not be touched."
A worker's view of the question
will be provided this Sunday after
noon when John McGuire, a member
of the Executive Committee of the
San Francisco A. F. of L. Central
Labor Council, speaks in the Wom
en's Clubhouse in connection with
