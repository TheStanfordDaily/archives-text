# Debaters Go On Network Tomorrow
## Card Squad to Meet Teams from Chicago, Santa Clara on Air 
### 
Four Stanford debaters will go on
the air tomorrow in two debates, one
against the University of Chicago
debaters over the NBC red network
at 2:30 o'clock, and the second with
Santa Clara over station KSFO at 5
o'clock.
H. B. Lee and Nelson Norman will
represent Stanford in the Chicago
debate, speaking on the symposium
question "Learning for Living."
President Ray Lyman Wilbur will
preside.
Lee will discuss the problems con
fronting higher education today in
impartial, informative speech. A
Chicago speaker will follow him, ad
vocating the plan for higher educa
tion suggested by President Robert
Maynard Hutchins, of the University
of Chicago, in his book "The Higher
Learning in America."
WILBUR MAY SPEAK
Norman will be the second speaker
for Stanford, criticizing the plan of
fered by Chicago. A Chicago speaker
will then wind up the debate.
Dr. Wilbur has been invited to ex
press briefly his personal views at
the beginning and again at the end
of the discussion. The invitation
came from NBC and the debaters
concerned.
Lee will express the dilemma con
fronting university education today,
pointing out that it is difficult to
determine whether undergraduates
should be educated for practical vo
cations, whether they should receive
an education consisting of "the pur
suit of truth" alone, or whether the
university is responsible for both.
As an answer, the Chicago speak
ers will present Dr. Hutchins' plan.
This plan, according to the debaters,
stresses philosophy and logic—the
study of principles rather than the
study of usefulness. Norman will
then attempt to criticize the views
of the Chicago team.

impartial, informative speech. A
Chicago speaker will follow him, ad
vocating the plan for higher educa
tion suggested by President Robert
Maynard Hutchins, of the University
of Chicago, in his book "The Higher
Learning in America."
WILBUR MAY SPEAK
Norman will be the second speaker
for Stanford, criticizing the plan of
fered by Chicago. A Chicago speaker
will then wind up the debate.
Dr. Wilbur has been invited to ex
press briefly his personal views at
the beginning and again at the end
of the discussion. The invitation
came from NBC and the debaters
concerned.
Lee will express the dilemma con
fronting university education today,
pointing out that it is difficult to
determine whether undergraduates
should be educated for practical vo
cations, whether they should receive
an education consisting of "the pur
suit of truth" alone, or whether the
university is responsible for both.
As an answer, the Chicago speak
ers will present Dr. Hutchins' plan.
This plan, according to the debaters,
stresses philosophy and logic—the
study of principles rather than the
study of usefulness. Norman will
then attempt to criticize the views
of the Chicago team.
DEBATE EXPLAINED
The Chicago debate was developed
at the instigation of Edward Lind
blom, former Stanford Joffre winner
and present debate coach at the Uni
versity of Chicago.
In the Santa Clara debate, Robert
Putnam and Vincent Lemmon of
Stanford will take opposite stands on
the question "Should the state subsi
dize hospitalization?" Putnam will
argue on the affirmative side, while
Lemmon will discuss the negative
view.
