# Garst Tells Worker Ills

Attributing California's migratory
worker problem to the fact that the
South has too many farmers for its
land. Regional Director Jonathan
Garst of the Farm Security Admin
istration spoke in the Women's
Clubhouse last night under the aus
pices of the American Student Un
ion on "The Migratory Worker in
California."
Seven million farmers live in
America, according to Mr. Garst,
and of that number some three mil
lion arc in the South and Southwest,
region hardest hit by the drought
of 1934. Approximately 1,000,000 of
these are surplus, working unpro
ductive land, or working as share
croppers on land owned by coinpa
nies of large land-holders.
With the coming of the drought,
which coincided with bumper crops
in California, there came a demand
for labor and a desire on the part
of labor to migrate, according to Mr.
Garst. These two factors, taken to
gether, resulted in a greatly in
creased (low of workers to the Pa
cific Coast.
Describing the program of the
Farm Security Administration in
handling this problem, Mr. Carsl
traced the development of migra
toi-y labor camps in the San Joaquin
Valley, and described the demo
cratic method of controlling them
which has been adopted. Besides a
government manager, there is a
camp committee, democratically
elected by people who in many
cases have never voted before, due
to exorbitant poll taxes in their na
tive states. Under their manage
ment, the life of the camp proceeds
without any arbitrary supervision by
the Security Administration.
Following Mr. Garst's address, the
government glm, "The Plow Which
Broke the Plains," was shown. Trac
ing the history of the Great Plains
area, the picture records the grad
ual advance of the cattle herds, the
coming of the plow, the war-boom
which put every available acre un
der cultivation, the slump which
followed the War, and finally the
great migration west which has re
sulted in California's migrant prob- j
lem.

With the coming of the drought,
which coincided with bumper crops
in California, there came a demand
for labor and a desire on the part
of labor to migrate, according to Mr.
Garst. These two factors, taken to
gether, resulted in a greatly in
creased (low of workers to the Pa
cific Coast.
Describing the program of the
Farm Security Administration in
handling this problem, Mr. Carsl
traced the development of migra
toi-y labor camps in the San Joaquin
Valley, and described the demo
cratic method of controlling them
which has been adopted. Besides a
government manager, there is a
camp committee, democratically
elected by people who in many
cases have never voted before, due
to exorbitant poll taxes in their na
tive states. Under their manage
ment, the life of the camp proceeds
without any arbitrary supervision by
the Security Administration.
Following Mr. Garst's address, the
government glm, "The Plow Which
Broke the Plains," was shown. Trac
ing the history of the Great Plains
area, the picture records the grad
ual advance of the cattle herds, the
coming of the plow, the war-boom
which put every available acre un
der cultivation, the slump which
followed the War, and finally the
great migration west which has re
sulted in California's migrant prob- j
lem.
