# Indoor Meet Lures Farm Cindermen
## Hiserman, Jeffrey To Lead 19 Cardinals In Trackfest Tonight 
### 
Dink Templeton probably will be
jotting down two sets of mental
notes tonight, when 19 Farm track
and field athletes compete on the
boards in the Pacific Coast Indoor
championships at the San Francisco
Civic Auditorium.
One will be filed away and kept
for future reference when Stanford
has its annual cinder engagements
with the Berkeley Bear, the Olym
pic Club, and Fresno State College.
The other will undoubtedly be
brought into play next Monday af
ternoon at Templeton's weekly
seminar.
Templeton doesn't like to waste
much time in telling his men what
improvements can be made in their
forms, and he'll have every oppor
tunity to see what the Indians can
do on the indoor board track
against the best sprinters, distance
men, and jumpers in the state.
LINE ON BEARS
A line on the Cal Bear will be
the most important outside of what
Stan Hiserman, Clyde Jeffrey, and
the other 17 men do tonight.
Tliere'll probably be no opposition
from any Trojan athlete unless en
tered unattached. Former cinder
aces at both Stanford and Cal, com
peting for the Olympic Club, will
also bear watching.
Competing on the board track will
be a new experience for most of
the Indian short-pantied artists, but
the odds won't be against them since
the team is in its best winter shape
in a long time. Not since Ben East
man and Hec Dyer ran for the Farm
back in 1931 and '32 have the Card
tracksters been in such a strong
position to take championship hon
ors this spring.
JEFFREY IN SPOTLIGHT
Because of his phenomenal times
last summer while touring the Unit
ed States and Europe, Jeffrey will
undoubtedly rate the spotlight in
the meet. Expected to shatter all
kinds of sprinting records before he
gets out, Jeffrey will take his mark
in the 50-yard sprint — but if he
comes out a winner it'll probably be
more of a surprise to himself and
Templeton than anyone else.
Against fast starters like Ray
Dean, ex-Stanford ace, and Tommy
Nelson of Fresno State, Jeffrey may
be forced to take a second or third
place—but just this once, because
his race is the century and furlong
in which he has 9.6 and 20.6 second
marks.
DISTANCE MEN
The distance twins—Paul Moore
and Marston Girard—will be in ac
tion, but not against each other.
Moore is lined up for the half-mile
and one-mile races, while Girard is
scheduled for the two-mile grind.
Bill Hawkins and Dick Simpson
will carry on in the high hurdles.
Four potentially consistent 50-foot
shot-putters, Bill Wohlc, Stan An
derson, Bill Trout and Allen Grey,
also will be Stanford entries. .
The complete entries:
50-yard dash: Jeffrey, Hiserman,
Carew, and Grant.

rey, Simpson, Johnson, Clark, Mac
