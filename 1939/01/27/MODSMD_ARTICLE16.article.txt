# Stuart Claims France, Britain Will Support Franco Regime

I Far away from the practicalities
I of Francisco Franco's iron fingers
| tightening on Barcelona, Professor
j Graham Stuart, authority on inter
j national affairs, yesterday predicted
i that. Rebel victory in Spain will not
; mean as much to Germany and Italy
I as the world supposes.
Looking at possible realignments
on the European continent, he forc-
I sees support of the Insurgent gov
ernment by both Great Britain and
I France.
International affairs are a matter
of selfish interest." he said. "Lost
! causes don't stimulate outside sup
port. And it's all a matter of who
puts up the biggest bluff."
Despite the fact that idealists may
consider the Loyalist cause supe
j rior to that of the winning Rightists,
Dr. Stuart pointed out that neither
France nor England can aflord to
align themselves with anyone else
other than Franco.

"All you've got to do is look at
the map," lie declared.
The present position held jointly
by the two European democracies i>
control of both gateways to the
Mediterranean — France in Tunis
Great Britain at Gibraltar; both at
Suez.
Neither, Dr. Stuart feels, will be
willing to let Italy acquire posses
sion of the strategic Balearic Is
lands, now Spanish territory, even
though Italy may demand them in
return for military assistance to
Franco.
Germany is not much interested,
he said, and has been relatively un
important in the Spanish situation
In support of this reasoning, Dr.
Stuart calls attention to the lack of
French and Italian support of the
Loyalists.
"There must be some reason for
their refusing to open frontiers and
supply war materials to govern
ment forces. It wouid seem they
realized the latter haven't had a
chance and are merely waiting until
it's all over-to make a deal with
Franco."
Franco, although he has received
aid from both Germany and Italy,
will most probably accept such a tie
up with the Democratic powers, if it
is an agreement to respect Spanish
territorial integrity, he indicated.
KEEP SPAIN INTACT
Concisely, Spain wants to stay in
tact— that, Franco has maintained
for the last three years.
"Any definite agreements with
Italy would most probably mean a
loss of at least one of the Balearics;
an agreement with Great Britain and
France would necessitate no loss.
In fact, it would mean something to
both sides."
The dual profit in the latter in
stance would be respect for terri
torial integrity of Spain and protec
tion of Britain's life-line of empire
through the Mediterranean and
France's outlet to African posses
sions and spheres of influence. -
ITALY ON LIMB
That Italy is more or less out on
a limb and at the control of Ger
man/" in the matter he showed by
pointing again to the European map
and referring to the character of the
Rome-Berlin axis.
What Hitler will probably advise
Mussolini to do is to demand prac
tical control of the Addis-Ababa-
Djibouti railroad; possibly, some
deal in Somaliland; and some voice
in control of the Suez Canal. This,
he indicated, would be far better
from Italy's standpoint than to de
mand one of the Balearics—a bluff
that might be called.
Germany, at the present moment,
might conceivably extend its sphere
of influence to the East from
Czechoslovakia, into Danzig, through
Hungary, parts of Roumania, and
even into the Ukraine—with only
disapproving scowls from England
and France.
RUSSIAN INDIFFERENCE
Even Russia might not object too
strenuously, he indicated, since the
U.S.S.R. is preoccupied with Japa
nese activity in Asia.
"This, of course, is only theory,"
he concluded. "You have to look at
these things from the selfish inter
ests of the nations involved.
"When you get into international
politics, you soon lose your ideals;
they always get in the way.
"As to the validity of these pre
dictions, don't count on them too
strongly. Political scientists are sup
posed to deal with facts; journalists
can play with probabilities."
