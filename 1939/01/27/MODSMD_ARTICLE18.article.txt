# Fraternities Hit As Sophs Win Class Debate
## Row Ignores Own Standards, Class Orators Maintain 
### 
That Stanford fraternities should
be abolished was forcefully proven
last night when a sophomore debate
team showed that fraternities do not
uphold the principles and standards
set forth and accepted by the frater
nities themselves.
In the revived frosh-soph debate,
the squad of sophomores quoted
from the "Fraternity Criteria" five
doctrines that fraternities should
uphold, but don't. They stated that
fraternities demand loyalty to them
selves first, divide the campus, are a
detriment to a high standard of mor
als, are low scholastically, and are
financially unstable.
Speaking for the sophomores were
Walt Stoessel, Milton Marks, and
Hugh O'Donnell. Freshman repre
sentatives were George Jackson,
Roger Boas, and Bob Hammett.
The freshman arguments were
that the present fraternity system is
satisfactory, and it would be finan
cially impossible to abolish them.
After the formal debate, the ques
tion was open for general discussion
during which the audience asked
many pertinent questions.
A silver plaque was presented to
Sophomore President Park Kimball
by Bob Curtiss, chairman and presi
dent of Delta Sigma Rho, sponsor of
the debate. Frosh President Larry
Dee was also present—just in case.
Judges were Professors Philip
Buck, Thomas Barclay, and William
Bark.
