# Card Five Faces Olympic Clubmen
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball team limps out onto the Pavilion floor this eve
ning at S o'clock to tangle with the Olympic Cluh hoopmen. Admission
is free.
Kenny Davidson is suffering from a heavy head cold and won't even
suit u)>. while Don Burness turned his had knee in practice and prohahly

also won't see action this week-end.
So the Winged-O tonight and
College of Pacific tomorrow night
will face a crippled Stanford team
that probably will have its two
sophomore cogs watching from the
sidelines. Tomorrow night's game
will also be in the Pavilion, with
no admission charged.
Bill Rapp will drop back from
forward to guard to replace David
son in the starting line-up, and will
team with either Dick Lyon or Bob
Burnett. Captain Phil Zonne is still
a mainstay at forward, and Harlan
Copsey will move into Burness' va
cated pivot position.
The surprise starter erf the eve
ning will be Don Wililams at for
ward spot opposite Zonne. Williams,
an ace of last year's strong frosh
team, has been coming fast with his
clever and aggressive floorwork and
accurate shooting eye. He pumped
eight Held goals through the netting
against the University of Mexico
last week, although he played only
little more than half the game.
LYON BALL-HAWK
Lyon caught Coach Everett
Dean's eye with his rebounding
against San Francisco State last
week-end and may start in place of
Burnett, who has to score frequent
ly in order to be of value to the
team since his small stature makes
his worth in rebounding negligible.
Burnett has been in a shooting
slump in recent weeks, but has
shown signs of snapping back into
form during practice sessions this
week. Dean has been giving Bob,
along with the other regulars, the
rest cure this week in an effort to
prevent their going stale. The regu
lars took both Monday and yester
day off from practice.
CLUBBERS THREATEN
Olympic Club looms a potent
threat to trim the Indians tonight,
now that the latter are going into
the tussle at three-fifths strength.
Backboned by such former Califor
nia stars as Ray Balsley, Ray Olson,
Don Jensen and Ed Dougery, and
sparked by Arville Hedman, the
Winged-0 are gunning for an up
set win tonight.
College of Pacific brings to the
Farm an unimpressive record
brightened only by a 27-26 upset
over San Jose State. Paul Rippon,
stocky little forward, and Bud
Doyle, a guard, are the bulwarks of
the Bengals' team.

Burnett. Captain Phil Zonne is still
a mainstay at forward, and Harlan
Copsey will move into Burness' va
cated pivot position.
The surprise starter erf the eve
ning will be Don Wililams at for
ward spot opposite Zonne. Williams,
an ace of last year's strong frosh
team, has been coming fast with his
clever and aggressive floorwork and
accurate shooting eye. He pumped
eight Held goals through the netting
against the University of Mexico
last week, although he played only
little more than half the game.
LYON BALL-HAWK
Lyon caught Coach Everett
Dean's eye with his rebounding
against San Francisco State last
week-end and may start in place of
Burnett, who has to score frequent
ly in order to be of value to the
team since his small stature makes
his worth in rebounding negligible.
Burnett has been in a shooting
slump in recent weeks, but has
shown signs of snapping back into
form during practice sessions this
week. Dean has been giving Bob,
along with the other regulars, the
rest cure this week in an effort to
prevent their going stale. The regu
lars took both Monday and yester
day off from practice.
CLUBBERS THREATEN
Olympic Club looms a potent
threat to trim the Indians tonight,
now that the latter are going into
the tussle at three-fifths strength.
Backboned by such former Califor
nia stars as Ray Balsley, Ray Olson,
Don Jensen and Ed Dougery, and
sparked by Arville Hedman, the
Winged-0 are gunning for an up
set win tonight.
College of Pacific brings to the
Farm an unimpressive record
brightened only by a 27-26 upset
over San Jose State. Paul Rippon,
stocky little forward, and Bud
Doyle, a guard, are the bulwarks of
the Bengals' team.
Stanford's basketball team limps out onto the Pavilion floor this eve
ning at S o'clock to tangle with the Olympic Cluh hoopmen. Admission
is free.
Kenny Davidson is suffering from a heavy head cold and won't even
suit u)>. while Don Burness turned his had knee in practice and prohahly

also won't see action this week-end.
So the Winged-O tonight and
College of Pacific tomorrow night
will face a crippled Stanford team
that probably will have its two
sophomore cogs watching from the
sidelines. Tomorrow night's game
will also be in the Pavilion, with
no admission charged.
Bill Rapp will drop back from
forward to guard to replace David
son in the starting line-up, and will
team with either Dick Lyon or Bob
Burnett. Captain Phil Zonne is still
a mainstay at forward, and Harlan
Copsey will move into Burness' va
cated pivot position.
