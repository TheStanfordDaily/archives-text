# Frosh to Face Two jaysees In Cage Tilts
## New Defense Due As Yearlings Tackle Sacramento, Auburn

i 10, Coach H. B. Lee will have his
j Card frosh Cagers trying out a

junior college outfits this week-end.

I vored 8 o'clock position against the
| Winged "O" and College on the Pa

of worthwhile and interesting shows

[ against Sacramento tonight and Au
burn tomorrow at 6:30 o'clock.
TOUGH DRILL
In a couple of rough-and-tumble
games last week-end against Lowell
High and Marin Jaysee, the year
lings came out with a .500 batting
average, but their fighting average
was a full 1.000. Certain weaknesses
which cropped up in both games
have been put through tough drills
this week in efforts by Lee to iron
out the difficulties which the frosh
encountered.
Attention was concentrated chiefly
on defense against fancy dribblers,
which the team ran up against in
Lowell's Delos, Delmar and Cerf.
Tricked by these men time and
again when they broke through the
defense set up by the Papooses, the
yearlings were in no way to stop
the charge.
GUARDS READY
With that partly cleared up, Lee
will have his guards, Chuck Smith,
Ollie Hamlin, Bob Scharbach and
Verne Hoffman, ready to meet what
ever Sacramento or Auburn has to
offer in the way of offensive trick- j
ery.
The entire team has been working
on new variations from the new of
fensive system rigged up by Jack
Calderwood and Lee last week. At
times against both outfits, the club
made the plays from the new sys
tem work amazingly well, and with
the additional week's practice and
the added variations they will offer
a greater variety of possibly of
fensive shots for Lew Reese, Bob
Penn, Bill Cowden, and Dick Ray.
These men will split up the starting
forward and center duties.
Both Reese and Penn tonight will
be out to regain their shooting eyes, j
which failed them in last week's en- ,
counters. Cowden and Ray shared i
scoring honors, with Cowden tank- i
ing 10 of his last free shots. i

TOUGH DRILL
In a couple of rough-and-tumble
games last week-end against Lowell
High and Marin Jaysee, the year
lings came out with a .500 batting
average, but their fighting average
was a full 1.000. Certain weaknesses
which cropped up in both games
have been put through tough drills
this week in efforts by Lee to iron
out the difficulties which the frosh
encountered.
Attention was concentrated chiefly
on defense against fancy dribblers,
which the team ran up against in
Lowell's Delos, Delmar and Cerf.
Tricked by these men time and
again when they broke through the
defense set up by the Papooses, the
yearlings were in no way to stop
the charge.
GUARDS READY
With that partly cleared up, Lee
will have his guards, Chuck Smith,
Ollie Hamlin, Bob Scharbach and
Verne Hoffman, ready to meet what
ever Sacramento or Auburn has to
offer in the way of offensive trick- j
ery.
The entire team has been working
on new variations from the new of
fensive system rigged up by Jack
Calderwood and Lee last week. At
times against both outfits, the club
made the plays from the new sys
tem work amazingly well, and with
the additional week's practice and
the added variations they will offer
a greater variety of possibly of
fensive shots for Lew Reese, Bob
Penn, Bill Cowden, and Dick Ray.
