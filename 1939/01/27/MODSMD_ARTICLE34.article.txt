"y r OU LL really have to make the
rounds if you want to see every
thing in the way of Stanford ath
letics on the campus this week-end.
Six baseball games would be
enough in themselves, but there will
be rugby, baseball, and swimming
to boot, the last three taking place
simultaneously in one afternoon.
Stage is set to give Card reserves
a chance to show their stuff' this

week - end a n d
next. Promising
first-string candi
dates will see ac
tion tonight and
tomorrow night,
and any player
who shows ear
marks of being a
dark* horse may
get conference ex
perience against

the none-too-good Bruins next
week-end.
With second stringers drafted for
duty in the varsity tilts, coaches will
dig deeper than ever into the squad
for the B-games that follow. These
games are thrillers in their own
right, and as second features, they
are uniquely entertaining.

|>ADIO broadcasters have taken
a sudden interest in the Stanford
rugby situation, and tomorrow's As- j
sociated Sportscast will be pro- 1
logued over KQW tonight at 7:30 j
o'clock, when Peter Fay, Lymie
Calkins, Coach Jim Wylie, and Su- ;
pervisor Harry Maloney will dis- j
cuss tomorrow's games with first
and second teams from the Univer
sity Club of Berkeley, composed
mostly of Cal graduates. Fay will
speak over the same station at 7
o'clock on Ernie Smith's program.
To assist tomorrow's spectators, j
members of the rugby team have 1
printed the rugby rules as com- j
pared with those of American foot
ball. The rules are really quite \
simple and the comparisons will j
make them even easier to under- j
stand.

WCENE of a great many sports j
k thrills tomorrow afternoon will
be the Sunken Diamond, where j
Stanford's much enlarged varsity
will meet the Pacific Greyhound ball j
club in a practice contest.
The bus drivers won the Oakland
Winter League last year, and they ;

can be expected j
to give the Cards j
a tough battle, j
The latter have !
been doing pretty j
well themselves, '
however, so odds
are even at best. '
To avoid ath- j
let ic conflicts in

the future, Coach Harry Wolter ■
plans to hold as many practice
games as possible on Wednesdays. !
Conference games, of course, will
be played as scheduled, on Wednes- j
days and Saturdays.
Loyal class rooters will spend j

part of a busy sports afternoon at
the Encina Pools to watch the inter
class swimming and diving con
tests.
Roy Winkelmann and Howard
Adams will compete on the spring
boards for the first time since they

met in last year's
junior nationals,
in which they took
fourth and third
p laces, respec
tively. They'll be
using the new
competitive dives
and their favorite
optionals.

Cutting the waves will be some
frosh stars who will be perform
ing for Stanford grandstands for the
first time. Paul Herron, all-event
sensation, will compete in three
contests, as will Gardner Miller, who
has turned in some remarkable
times in practice.

gest on-campus sports week

tational ski meet at Reno.

Molybdenite has been discovered
