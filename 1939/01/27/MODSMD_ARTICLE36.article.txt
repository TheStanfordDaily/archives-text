# Baseball, Rugby, Interclass Swimming Give Farm Three-ring Show Tomorrow
## Baseballers Ruggers Swimmers 
### 
With two victories and one de
feat so far this season for moral sup
port, Coach Harry Wolter's varsity
diamond men tomorrow at 3 o'clock i
toss in the ball on their fourth
game of the season against the Pa
cific Greyhound nine.
But more than a mere (>OO per cent j
! game average will be required to
! turn in a win over the semi-profes
sional Greyhound boys who have
I one of the strongest baseball units
j in the bay area.
Coach Wolters, although pleased
| by last Wednesday's Cardinal vic-
I lory over the Gaddini All-Stars, still
j looks for a general improvement of
! team defensive play. The juggled
I outfield filled the necessary gaps,
j but the infield as a whole turned in
i a ragged performance.
Moundmen have taken a recent
slump, as was clearly shown by the
wild hurling displayed during the
Gaddini tilt. Only Masters appears
to possess complete control in the
clutches. The catching must under
go noticeable improvement before
reaching top game form.
The Cardinals, over-anxious dur
ing these opening season games, are
experiencing difficulty in breaking
themselves of the ball juggling and
dropping habit.

With the final practice before to
morrow's game with the University
Club tucked beneath their belts,
Harry Maloney's rugby men will
take a brief siesta this afternoon in
order to open the fray tomorrow in
top-notch condition.
Satisfied with the improvement of
their charges, Volunteer Coaches
Jim Wylie and Willard Clausen
yesterday expressed the belief that
the Cardinals would go into the
j game with considerably more
j knowledge of the fundamentals of
| the game than they evinced last
I Saturday.
If' the improvement is in scoring
| ability, the University Club ruggers
| are in for a bad day tomorrow, for
| in last week's fracas, the Farm var
j sity pounded out a very convincing
23-0 win over the Stanford Medics.
With almost two full teams show
ing what amounts to almost equal
ability, the starting line-up for the
game will not be announced until
just before the opening whistle.
The opening game, previously
scheduled to open at 2:15 o'clock,
will not start until 15 minutes later.
Admission to the Stanford Sta
dium will be free. The game will
be broadcast over nine stations for
1 the benefit of bay listeners.

With excitement at a fever for
tomorrow's interclass swimming
classic, scheduled to begin at 2:30
o'clock at the Encina Pools, last
minute reports from the waterfront
reveal the freshman class to be
slight favorites to win the meet.
A dope sheet, compiled by Coach
i Nort Thornton, gives the Encina
team a two-point edge over the sen
i iors, the prognosticated scored end
j ing with the defending champions
| trailing 56-54.
In any event, no matter who wins
j the meet, Farm records will be
clipped, if recent times in practice
sessions by Paul Herron, Roy Vit
ousek and Dill Weeden are any in
i dication.
j The forecast sets the sophomores
j in third place with 39 points, the
! two-man junior team ending in the
| tail position with 4 digits.
Thornton's figures give the frosh
: four possible first places, the sophs
j four, the seniors one, and the jun
! iors none. However, the Class of '39,
j with more seconds and thirds, are
j picked to end up ahead of the
j sophomores and trailing the Encina
men by a thin dime's margin.
Thornton, however, refuses to
consider himself infallible. "Any
thing can happen," he comments.
"It still is anybody's meet."

With almost two full teams show
ing what amounts to almost equal
ability, the starting line-up for the
game will not be announced until
just before the opening whistle.
The opening game, previously
scheduled to open at 2:15 o'clock,

Admission to the Stanford Sta

With excitement at a fever for
tomorrow's interclass swimming
classic, scheduled to begin at 2:30
o'clock at the Encina Pools, last
minute reports from the waterfront
reveal the freshman class to be
slight favorites to win the meet.
A dope sheet, compiled by Coach
i Nort Thornton, gives the Encina
team a two-point edge over the sen
i iors, the prognosticated scored end
j ing with the defending champions
| trailing 56-54.
In any event, no matter who wins
j the meet, Farm records will be
clipped, if recent times in practice
sessions by Paul Herron, Roy Vit
ousek and Dill Weeden are any in
i dication.
j The forecast sets the sophomores
j in third place with 39 points, the
! two-man junior team ending in the
| tail position with 4 digits.
Thornton's figures give the frosh
: four possible first places, the sophs
j four, the seniors one, and the jun
! iors none. However, the Class of '39,
j with more seconds and thirds, are
j picked to end up ahead of the
j sophomores and trailing the Encina
men by a thin dime's margin.
Thornton, however, refuses to
consider himself infallible. "Any
thing can happen," he comments.
"It still is anybody's meet."
With two victories and one de
feat so far this season for moral sup
port, Coach Harry Wolter's varsity
diamond men tomorrow at 3 o'clock i
toss in the ball on their fourth
game of the season against the Pa
cific Greyhound nine.
But more than a mere (>OO per cent j
! game average will be required to
! turn in a win over the semi-profes
sional Greyhound boys who have
I one of the strongest baseball units
j in the bay area.
Coach Wolters, although pleased
| by last Wednesday's Cardinal vic-
I lory over the Gaddini All-Stars, still
j looks for a general improvement of
! team defensive play. The juggled
I outfield filled the necessary gaps,
j but the infield as a whole turned in
i a ragged performance.
Moundmen have taken a recent
slump, as was clearly shown by the
wild hurling displayed during the
Gaddini tilt. Only Masters appears
to possess complete control in the
clutches. The catching must under
go noticeable improvement before
reaching top game form.
The Cardinals, over-anxious dur
ing these opening season games, are
experiencing difficulty in breaking
themselves of the ball juggling and
dropping habit.

With the final practice before to
morrow's game with the University
Club tucked beneath their belts,
Harry Maloney's rugby men will
take a brief siesta this afternoon in
order to open the fray tomorrow in
top-notch condition.
Satisfied with the improvement of
