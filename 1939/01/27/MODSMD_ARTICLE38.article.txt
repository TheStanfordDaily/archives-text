OFFICIALLY announced yesterday was the
acceptance of nearly half a million dollars'
worth of gifts to Stanford University.
In general, these donations will be put to
various uses—for the construction of the Hoo
ver Library, for experimental study in educa
tion, for maintenance of scholarship funds, for
scientific research.
One instance is a particularly good example
of the spirit in which the great majority of gifts
to Stanford is made; that is the joint fund set up
by Mr. and Mrs. George Wagner for "mainte
nance" of the Cubberley Education Building.
Mr. Wagner is head of the firm that has built
more than a dozen Stanford buildings in the
last 20 years.
As an endowment for building maintenance,
the gift is the first of its kind in Stanford history.
Consequently, the Farm profits two ways: it
gets an additional return from having buildings
built; it gets a start on a new endowment fund
for a definitely worthy, yet not spectacular pur
pose.
In appreciation of this and the other gifts
tendered with the same spirit, the one thing
Stanford can do is to see that the money is put
to the uses for which it has been donated in
the most efficient and profitable manner.
But at the same time not forget its manners
by neglecting a sincere thank you for tangible
favors received.—H. L. S.
