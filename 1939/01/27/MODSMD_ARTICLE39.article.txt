DEBATING is centuries old in the world, but
young at Stanford—green behind the years,
you might say. And yet from this young sprout
on the Farm has come an idea which the cen
4uries of formal debate never had.
In action, the idea sent two debaters to Cen
tral America last year, prompted five Stanford
men to go south this Christmas vacation into
Indian territory.
The idea is simple: that in Stanford's debaters
lies a group of men and women fitted to act as
a body of investigation of hitherto obscure
social questions. Hence the three-year schedule
of study on Indian life in the Southwest.
From the material gathered will come sur
veys, speeches, articles. Debate will not be
simply a matter of hedging on questions, spik
ing opponents with a slippery tongue, but will
be discussion based upon personal knowledge,
argument backed by observed fact.
Social critics will maintain that their surveys
will be superficial. Perhaps so; but not so super
ficial that they will be valueless to a campus
which is completely uninformed on subjects
which the debaters are after.
From Indians in the Southwest, Stanford's
little survey agency can branch out into migra
tory worker problems, the Negro question, Ori
ental assimilation on the West Coast.
The Greeks (or was it the Babylonians?)
started debate with some fine ideas; it has per
sisted in ever more refined forms ever since.
But Stanford put a new twist to the old game.
