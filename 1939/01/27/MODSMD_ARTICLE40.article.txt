# Take It Easy

### 
RUNNING along quietly for the last few days,
the juggernaut which moved on Branner's
Dining Hall last week has saved up steam to
be released next week at a meeting of possible
culinary candidates.
If the meeting is successful, the Dining Hall
is just that much nearer to reopening. If it is
not, no harm has been done. But, though the
outcome of the whole affair is still doubtful,
eating clubs already have been mildly alarmed
at the supposed threat of a Hall dining room.
They need not be. Those who will eat in the
Hall, and who now spread over the surrounding
countryside at meal times, are not going to for
sake the clubs for their new Dining Room, if it
opens. For the most part, they pass by the clubs
because they want to, or, sad as it must be to a

thoroughly democratic mind, because the clubs
do not want them.
So when 100 or more sign for their own Hall,
they are acting, not as club-fodder led astray
by frustrated leaders, but as men who know
what they want.
But if it is simply competition the clubs are
fearing, then the Dining Hall movement has
been good, not bad. Competition, to a certain
degree, can do much to better the status quo.
Clubs are by no means perfect; or, at least, they
vary in degree of splendor. A little competition
may boost slack organizations, will do no harm
to those secure in the knowledge that they have
something to offer.
The Branner Dining Hall is still bolted. But,
because it may open, clubs need not fear that
the lock will simply be transferred from Bran
ner's door to theirs.
