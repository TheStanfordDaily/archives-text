# BULL SESSION
## SNOOP, HONOR. AND REPORT 
### JOHN COBBS 
lUST at the moment, Stanford seems to be indulging
** in a fit of introspection that is almost neurotic,
though unquestionably good for our collective soul. At
the meeting of student leaders last Wednesday the
question of overhauling the honor code came up;
and with it came the suggestion that after each exam
ination the student should sign a pledge that he had
seen no cheating.
Three years or so of journalistic shadow boxing
over the keyboard of a doddering Underwood have
dealt very cavalierly with the illusions my Sunday
school teacher implanted in me. But my faith in the
success of the present honor code has managed to
come through unsoiled. In my opinion, if the student
leaders want to take a flier in mechanics, they can
find a lot of machinery that needs tinkering before
they get to the honor code.

I HAVE no intention of wande ring of! here into an
ethical pep talk about our duty to each other and
to society, home, and mother. But as far as I can
see, the honor system is based on the idea that each
man has a conscience that is capable of keeping him
from cheating. If this assumption is wrong, there is
no point in trying to keep the system. If it is right, it
is foolish as well as insulting to make each student a
deputy sheriff, commissioned to spy on his neighbor.
It will be objected that cheating does occur, that
there are some students who can't understand that
beating the game eventually benefits no one. But
these objections apply just as strongly to any system
of "mass policing."
* * * Si
The frosh bible to the contrary, Stanford is not
the Kingdom of Heaven, and as long as we have stu
dents we will have cheating. All we can do is try
to keep it at a minimum.
Personally, I fail to see how we will reduce any
thing by making each student responsible for the
molality of the man in the next seat. I have entirely
too much trouble with my own conscience to be the
keeper of my neighbor's. The whole idea of the honor
system is that the responsibility for a man's actions
rests on his own ethical sense. If we start to shift the
blame we junk the old foundation and are left with a
beautiful building and no place to put it.
The main reason why proctor systems fail is that
they make cheating a jolly little game in which stu
dents try to score one on the professor. The honor
system avoids this curse, but mass proctoring would
diag it back in, with none of the honor system com-
Besides that, anybody who is so dumb that he
cheats wheie the class can see him is much too stupid
to stay in Stanford long, and so we needn't worry
about him.

success of the present honor code has managed to
come through unsoiled. In my opinion, if the student
leaders want to take a flier in mechanics, they can
find a lot of machinery that needs tinkering before
they get to the honor code.

I HAVE no intention of wande ring of! here into an
ethical pep talk about our duty to each other and
to society, home, and mother. But as far as I can
see, the honor system is based on the idea that each
man has a conscience that is capable of keeping him
from cheating. If this assumption is wrong, there is
no point in trying to keep the system. If it is right, it
is foolish as well as insulting to make each student a
deputy sheriff, commissioned to spy on his neighbor.
It will be objected that cheating does occur, that
there are some students who can't understand that
beating the game eventually benefits no one. But
these objections apply just as strongly to any system
of "mass policing."

The frosh bible to the contrary, Stanford is not
the Kingdom of Heaven, and as long as we have stu
dents we will have cheating. All we can do is try
to keep it at a minimum.
Personally, I fail to see how we will reduce any
thing by making each student responsible for the
molality of the man in the next seat. I have entirely
too much trouble with my own conscience to be the
keeper of my neighbor's. The whole idea of the honor
system is that the responsibility for a man's actions
rests on his own ethical sense. If we start to shift the
blame we junk the old foundation and are left with a
beautiful building and no place to put it.
The main reason why proctor systems fail is that
they make cheating a jolly little game in which stu
dents try to score one on the professor. The honor
system avoids this curse, but mass proctoring would
diag it back in, with none of the honor system com-
Besides that, anybody who is so dumb that he
cheats wheie the class can see him is much too stupid
to stay in Stanford long, and so we needn't worry
about him.
lUST at the moment, Stanford seems to be indulging
** in a fit of introspection that is almost neurotic,
though unquestionably good for our collective soul. At
the meeting of student leaders last Wednesday the
question of overhauling the honor code came up;
and with it came the suggestion that after each exam
ination the student should sign a pledge that he had
seen no cheating.
Three years or so of journalistic shadow boxing
over the keyboard of a doddering Underwood have
dealt very cavalierly with the illusions my Sunday
school teacher implanted in me. But my faith in the
success of the present honor code has managed to
come through unsoiled. In my opinion, if the student
leaders want to take a flier in mechanics, they can
find a lot of machinery that needs tinkering before
