This must be a hoi I of a world.
That is, it must be to anyone with a stomach strong
enough and a mind weak enough to read, absorb, and
enjoy the latest contribution of our little friends up
stairs: The Chaparral.
After reading it simply as a task, as A Thing
Which Needed Doing, I wonder:
What Thorne Ls going to use for a soap-box and
pulpit when he's through writing for Chaparral.
How long it's been since Thorne has read "Pit
cairn Island, and how long it's been since Levinson
has read "Jurgen."
Who told Chaparral that red ink makes a good
display.
Whether Thorne cries himself to sleep at night or
not. '
Whether Levinson knows the difference between
writing a poem and clipping fillers, and if so, why he
doesn't clip more fillers.
Whether Levinson's edits are so sublimely satisfy
ing to everyone as they are to Levinson.
Whether anyone on the staff would know a humor
magazine when he sees one, and if not, what are they
doing trying to put one out.
Why MellinkofT doesn't write more poems and
fewer whispered dispatches of month-old news and
third-rate epigrams.
Why anyone would put out a whole magazine just
to print one good short "letter home". Or, phrased
another way, why an alleged complete humor staff
headed by a marvelously shrewd and witty Old Boy
and supported by many wits (with a tradition) and a
so-called bevy of beautiful sales babes can't print a
magazine with more readable stuff in it than a bare
four inches.

The other night, I hear, quite a goodly number of
people went up to (lie city, and, getting back about 2
o'clock, parked out in front of Lagunita for the alloted
half hour.
There was some tremendous number like six per
sons in the car. But it's cosier that way, I suppose.
After a little one of the gals asked what time it
was. Someone looked at his watch. It was 2:10, but
to give his friends a thrill, he said, "2:29Vj."
The unexpected line in the back scat came from
one of the gals who said to the egg she was with,
"My, but you make the time go fast.''

ODE TO THE SEASON
In the tender words of poets and old ladies, they
were lovers.
Watching them pass through a scries of blissful
billings and cooings through the autumn past,
I hope that through all this wet weather, which I
am quite positive is coming on
Things will be able to go on the way they tire 1
'til spring with nothing more coming
Between the twain
Than rain.

After a little one of the gals asked what time it
was. Someone looked at his watch. It was 2:10, but
to give his friends a thrill, he said, "2:29Vj."

ODE TO THE SEASON
In the tender words of poets and old ladies, they
were lovers.
Watching them pass through a scries of blissful
billings and cooings through the autumn past,
I hope that through all this wet weather, which I
am quite positive is coming on
Things will be able to go on the way they tire 1
'til spring with nothing more coming
Between the twain
Than rain.
JEEZ
This must be a hoi I of a world.
That is, it must be to anyone with a stomach strong
enough and a mind weak enough to read, absorb, and
enjoy the latest contribution of our little friends up
stairs: The Chaparral.
After reading it simply as a task, as A Thing
Which Needed Doing, I wonder:
What Thorne Ls going to use for a soap-box and
pulpit when he's through writing for Chaparral.
How long it's been since Thorne has read "Pit
cairn Island, and how long it's been since Levinson
has read "Jurgen."
Who told Chaparral that red ink makes a good
display.
Whether Thorne cries himself to sleep at night or
not. '
Whether Levinson knows the difference between
writing a poem and clipping fillers, and if so, why he
doesn't clip more fillers.
Whether Levinson's edits are so sublimely satisfy
ing to everyone as they are to Levinson.
Whether anyone on the staff would know a humor
magazine when he sees one, and if not, what are they
doing trying to put one out.
Why MellinkofT doesn't write more poems and
fewer whispered dispatches of month-old news and
third-rate epigrams.
Why anyone would put out a whole magazine just
to print one good short "letter home". Or, phrased
another way, why an alleged complete humor staff
headed by a marvelously shrewd and witty Old Boy
and supported by many wits (with a tradition) and a
so-called bevy of beautiful sales babes can't print a
magazine with more readable stuff in it than a bare
four inches.

The other night, I hear, quite a goodly number of
people went up to (lie city, and, getting back about 2
o'clock, parked out in front of Lagunita for the alloted
half hour.
There was some tremendous number like six per
sons in the car. But it's cosier that way, I suppose.
