# History ... 1939
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
years ago today the swastika
first flew over Germany. Six
years ago the firm hand of Adolf
Hitler grasped absolute control of
the Reich; since 193 it has not re
laxed.
What der Fuehrer says today
when he addresses the opening of
the Reichstag may shake the
world—we have good reasons for
thinking so. For this Reichstag has
not the same membership as the
body which heard Hitler's first
speech when he assumed the chan
cellorship. New to Berlin today are
the members from Austria and Su
deten Czechoslovakia, the independ
ent democracies of 1933 which are
the German provinces of 1939.
# * *
r democracies hope that to
day's speech will prove a mere
declaration of Adolf Hitler's suc
cess in making Germany the
mightiest, most feared nation in
Europe. However, the world an
ticipates statements of policy
which may threaten its flimsy
pcacc.
Since Mussolini backed up the
Reich in its annexation of Austria
and its grabbing of Czechoslovakia
at the Munich Conference, not at
all surprising would be an expres
sion of German support for Italy's
clair i,n Ihe French power in the
Med ,'anean. Less probable is the
threa„ hat Hitler will announce a
drive to regain the Fatherland's Af
rican colonies, lost in the signing
of the Treaty of Versailles.
The great fear for peace lies in
the fact that der Fuehrer may de
cide to follow the advice of his more
extreme counsellors and seize the
occasion as an opportunity to an
swer recent criticism poured on
him by the two great English
speaking leaders, Roosevelt and
Chamberlain.
* * *
IN his Birmingham speech last
week the British Prime Minis
ter appealed to the peoples of
the totalitarian states to act over
the heads of their dictators and
preserve the peace of Europe.
Similar was the theme of Presi
dent Roosevelt's address at the
opening of Congress, hut to it he
added a sharp, severe condemna
* : on of Germany's treatment of
ihe Jews.
Now it is Herr Hitler's turn, and
the probability is strong that he
may make the hair on the backs
of democracies stand on end with
some sharp remarks in rebuttal.
Until noon today we shall not know
which course he will follow. We
nwait the words of Adolf Hitler.,
which today are the words of fate.
* *
W/ITH defeat for the Spanish Loy
alists comes the inevitable
demoralization. Clearly realizing the
hopelessness of resistance and fear
ful of the vengeance of Franco's
troops, thousands of the defenders
of Barcelona have started to flee
toward the French border. But
there are those among the ragged
Republican ranks who have not yet
lost the burning idealism, the crazed
determination with which they de
fended the doomed capital.
These men, anarchists and ex
tremists, have turned on their
fleeing comrades and started
shooting them down. Determined
to fight to the end, this group is
using bombs, blockades, every
means available to prevent the
escape of the Loyalist soldiers
from the battlefield of Catalonia.
, * * *
MEANWHILE the northern col
" umn of the Insurgents is mov
ing north of Barcelona up the Segre
valley driving before it thousands
of Loyalist refugees struggling to
reach the French frontier. What
will become of these men and wom
en, starving and diseased, remains
an ugly question. The government
of France has issued positive orders
that the border is to remain strictly
closed, that all Spaniards must be
kept on their own side of the
Pyrennees.
Already refugees, cut off by
opposing political forces both to
the north and south, arc estab
• lishing themselves in make-shift
concentration camps along the
frontier to await the final suc
cess of Franco in Spain and the
mercy that is in heaven.

r pODAY in Washington, D.C., will
arrive an envelope containing
10 cents for the President's Birth
day fund, a dime which may some
day be one which completes the
payment of a salary or the purchase
of an instrument for the man who
will discover the cause of infantile
paralysis.
There are few other significant
developments on the Washington
scene. The Supreme Court of the
nation resumes its full nine-man
strength again today when Associate
Justice Felix Frankfurter takes his
seat to fill the vacancy caused by the
death of Benjamin Cardozo.
With the President's relief bill
definitely set at $725,000,000 by the
Senate, it will return to the llou.se
of Representatives tomorrow for
approval by the members of that
body. Few are the fears that the
already reduced measure will not
be passed.

What der Fuehrer says today
when he addresses the opening of
the Reichstag may shake the
world—we have good reasons for
thinking so. For this Reichstag has
not the same membership as the
body which heard Hitler's first

which may threaten its flimsy
pcacc.
Since Mussolini backed up the
Reich in its annexation of Austria
and its grabbing of Czechoslovakia
at the Munich Conference, not at
all surprising would be an expres
sion of German support for Italy's
clair i,n Ihe French power in the
Med ,'anean. Less probable is the
threa„ hat Hitler will announce a
drive to regain the Fatherland's Af
rican colonies, lost in the signing
of the Treaty of Versailles.
The great fear for peace lies in
the fact that der Fuehrer may de

extreme counsellors and seize the

W/ITH defeat for the Spanish Loy
alists comes the inevitable
demoralization. Clearly realizing the
hopelessness of resistance and fear
ful of the vengeance of Franco's
troops, thousands of the defenders
of Barcelona have started to flee
toward the French border. But
there are those among the ragged
Republican ranks who have not yet
lost the burning idealism, the crazed
determination with which they de
fended the doomed capital.
These men, anarchists and ex
tremists, have turned on their
fleeing comrades and started
shooting them down. Determined
to fight to the end, this group is
using bombs, blockades, every
means available to prevent the
escape of the Loyalist soldiers
from the battlefield of Catalonia.

years ago today the swastika
first flew over Germany. Six
years ago the firm hand of Adolf
Hitler grasped absolute control of
the Reich; since 193 it has not re
laxed.
What der Fuehrer says today
when he addresses the opening of
the Reichstag may shake the
world—we have good reasons for
thinking so. For this Reichstag has
not the same membership as the
body which heard Hitler's first
speech when he assumed the chan
cellorship. New to Berlin today are
the members from Austria and Su
deten Czechoslovakia, the independ
ent democracies of 1933 which are
the German provinces of 1939.

r democracies hope that to
day's speech will prove a mere
declaration of Adolf Hitler's suc
cess in making Germany the
mightiest, most feared nation in
Europe. However, the world an
ticipates statements of policy
which may threaten its flimsy
pcacc.
Since Mussolini backed up the
Reich in its annexation of Austria
and its grabbing of Czechoslovakia
at the Munich Conference, not at
all surprising would be an expres
sion of German support for Italy's
clair i,n Ihe French power in the
Med ,'anean. Less probable is the
threa„ hat Hitler will announce a
drive to regain the Fatherland's Af
rican colonies, lost in the signing
of the Treaty of Versailles.
The great fear for peace lies in
the fact that der Fuehrer may de
cide to follow the advice of his more
extreme counsellors and seize the
occasion as an opportunity to an
swer recent criticism poured on
him by the two great English
speaking leaders, Roosevelt and
Chamberlain.
