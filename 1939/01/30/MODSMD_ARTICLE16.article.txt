# Pure Science Points Way To Apparatus
## klystron Discovery Incidental to Search For Atom-smasher 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Like most major advances in ap
plied science, the klystron grew out
of a research in pure science
William W. Hansen, associate pro
fessor of physics, has been looking
for a way to get higher voltages with
which to smash the atom and had
invented an electric resonator for
that purpose. Instead of the usual
coil-and-condenser of ordinary ra
dio practice, the resonator was a
copper tank inside of which radio
waves surged back and forth.
Because the seductive undulation
of the electric energy in the resona
tor reminded versatile physics stu
dents of the rhumba, the tank was
nicknamed "rhumbatron."

But Hansen's gadget didn't remain
confined to atom-smashing. It came
to the attention of Sigurd Varian,
who for eight years had been a flight
captain for Pan-American Airways
on Latin - American runs. Flying
over Mexico in all weather, Mr.
Varian became convinced that aero
nautical radio had to be improved.
Enlisting the help of his brother
Russell, a Stanford graduate in phys
ics with wide experience in radio and
television, he took a leave of ab
sence from the air service. Together
the two brothers came to Dr. Han
sen's laboratory at Stanford.
The result of their pooled efforts,
with the guidance of Professor Web
ster, was the invention of the kly
stron by Russell Varian and its de
velopment by the whole group.
USE TWO RIIUMBATRONS
Two rhumbatrons, called the
"buncher" and the "catcher," togeth
er with other apparatus, make up
the klystron. Its name comes from
the Greek verb "klyzo," denoting
the breaking of waves on a beach.
This is roughly descriptive of the
action of the device. In the buncher
rhumbatron is an oscillating elec
tric field, parallel to a stream of elec
trons passing through it The field is
of such strength as to change the
speeds of the electrons by appre
ciable fractions, accelerating some,
slowing down others.
After passing through the buncher,
the electrons with increased speeds
begin to overtake those with de
creased speeds which are ahead of
them. This motion groups the elec
trons into bunches separated by rela
tively empty spaces.
CONVERTED INTO POWER
By passing the stream through the
catcher rhumbatron, within which
is an oscillating electric field chang
ing synchronously so as to take en
ergy away from the bunched elec
trons, a considerable fraction of the
power of the electron-bunches is
converted into power of high-fre
quency oscillations.
Advantages of the klystron prin
ciple arc threefold. (1) It produces
strong waves; (2) they are at stable
frequencies; and (3) they have
strong amplification at the receiving
end. In addition, such waves emitted
from a reflector having a diameter of
one meter would radiate within a
narrow angle of only six degrees.

strong waves; (2) they are at stable

strong amplification at the receiving

Like most major advances in ap

of a research in pure science
William W. Hansen, associate pro
fessor of physics, has been looking
for a way to get higher voltages with
which to smash the atom and had
invented an electric resonator for
that purpose. Instead of the usual
coil-and-condenser of ordinary ra
dio practice, the resonator was a
copper tank inside of which radio
waves surged back and forth.
Because the seductive undulation
of the electric energy in the resona
tor reminded versatile physics stu
dents of the rhumba, the tank was
nicknamed "rhumbatron."
NEED IMPROVED RADIO
But Hansen's gadget didn't remain
confined to atom-smashing. It came
to the attention of Sigurd Varian,
who for eight years had been a flight
captain for Pan-American Airways
on Latin - American runs. Flying
over Mexico in all weather, Mr.
Varian became convinced that aero
nautical radio had to be improved.
Enlisting the help of his brother
Russell, a Stanford graduate in phys
ics with wide experience in radio and
television, he took a leave of ab
sence from the air service. Together
the two brothers came to Dr. Han
sen's laboratory at Stanford.
The result of their pooled efforts,
with the guidance of Professor Web
ster, was the invention of the kly
stron by Russell Varian and its de
velopment by the whole group.
USE TWO RIIUMBATRONS
Two rhumbatrons, called the
"buncher" and the "catcher," togeth
er with other apparatus, make up
the klystron. Its name comes from
the Greek verb "klyzo," denoting
the breaking of waves on a beach.
This is roughly descriptive of the
action of the device. In the buncher
rhumbatron is an oscillating elec
tric field, parallel to a stream of elec
trons passing through it The field is
of such strength as to change the
speeds of the electrons by appre
ciable fractions, accelerating some,
slowing down others.
After passing through the buncher,
the electrons with increased speeds
begin to overtake those with de
creased speeds which are ahead of
them. This motion groups the elec
trons into bunches separated by rela
tively empty spaces.
CONVERTED INTO POWER
By passing the stream through the
catcher rhumbatron, within which
is an oscillating electric field chang
ing synchronously so as to take en
ergy away from the bunched elec
trons, a considerable fraction of the
power of the electron-bunches is
