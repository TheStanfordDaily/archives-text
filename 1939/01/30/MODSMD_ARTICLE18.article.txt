# Four Stanford Physicists Improve Short-wave Radio
## Klystron Invention May Prevent Airline Accidents: Aid Television 
### HARRY SHELDON 
Foreseeing its use as an aid to prevent blind landing accidents in fly
ing, four Stanford physicists announced Saturday the invention and pre
liminary developments of ultra-short wave radio apparatus, described as
"the most important advance in radio since Ik-Forrest's invention of the
audion tube in 190(Â».''
Called the "klystron," the device is a new type of ultra high-frequency

generator and receiver sending and
receiving on wave lengths as low as
10 centimeters, at efficiencies not
hitherto attained.
Of such high frequency thai they
may be handled almost as easily as
light, the waves may be focused and
directed for so-far unattained dis
tances, because of the amount of
energy that may be put behind the
waves.
FOUR INSTRUMENTAL
The klystron was developed by
Russell H. and Sugurd F. Varian,
research associates; Associate Pro
fessor William W. Hansen, and Pro
fessor David L. Webster, head of
the physics department.
Commenting upon practical ap
plication, Dr. Fred L. Terman, head
of the electrical engineering depart
ment, called attention to use of the
high frequency waves in flying.
Primary reason for the importance
of the discovery is that the klystron
solves the problems that lower fre
quency waves are not easily focus
ed and that higher frequencies waves
developed before have not had suf
ficient force for practical use, he
indicated.
"This invention has broken away
entirely from conventional meth
ods," he said, calling attention to the
property of the waves which al
lows them to be focused by a cop
per reflector.
SAFETY IN LANDINGS
In application, {his means that
devices for aiding blind landings of
airplanes will be far more efficient
than at present and will aid mate
rially in abolishing accidents such
as the one in which a TWA Main
liner crashed in the ocean of! Point
Reyes.
That crash, he declared, was par
tially the result of confusion re
sulting in reception of too many
beacon signals; with the new appa
ratus, waves are so short that they
may be confined to a small beam
and focused so as not to interfere
with other beams nearby.
Describing a theoretical arrange
ment, he said that by the time
klystron beams from a San Fran
cisco airport reached a point above
Los Angeles, they would have pen
etrated the ionized layer above the
earth and would be above possible
interference.
"It is also true that these waves
tend to be more immune to static,"
he declared, indicating the solution
to another problem facing aeronau
tical navigation.
SHORT WAVE LENGTH
Present working minimum wave
length employed by airlines in radio
work is about one meter. The Stan
ford klystron produces waves one
tenth that length and the inventors
believe wave lengths considerably
less than .10 centimeters can be
reached.
This opens a practical application
to transmission of television, Dr.
Terman said.
"In all broadcast ranges, at pres
ent there are only one million
cycles with one meter wave lengths.
The situation in regard to televi
; sion is that physicists are talking
about broadcasting on frequencies
! of six million cycles," he said.
In other words, television needs
| six times as many cycles as has
| heretofore been possible.
At one-tenth of a meter wave
I length, as being developed by the
J klystron at present, frequencies up
I to three billion cycles are developed.
At. shorter wave lengths of five
hundredths of a meter, many times
this number of cycles are devel
oped.
These latter length, although not
developed as yet, are thought to be
possible by using the same method,
he explained.
"With this in mind, it is easy to
see that an important obstacle to
development of television is re-
moved," he said.
WIDE APPLICATION
Questioned on other applications,
Dr. Terman said, "Anything like
this has innumerable applications;
if you want to let your imagination
wander."
Such ramifications might be in
relation to the machinery of war,
i wireless transmission at short dis
| tances, and in relaying radio broad
casts, he suggested.
Summarizing the importance of
j the klystron, he again called atten
tion to the properties of the ultra
short waves which permit sufficient
force and energy to be placed be
hind them for efficient application.
