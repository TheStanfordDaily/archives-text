A SMALL MONGREL pup. looking a little hesitant, poses before the ovens of a hogan in the Indian
pueblo of Taos, high on a plateau in northern New Mexico. Taos was visited by Stanford's traveling de
baters, after a journey 05 miles up the tortuous canyon of the Rio Grande river. Indians at Taos still
maintain their ancient living customs, are the least commercialized of all Indian groups which Stanford
men saw on their trip.
