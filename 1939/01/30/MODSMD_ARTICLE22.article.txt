Re: The Recent punitive action
taken against a "certain" fraternity
by the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol. That house needs reforming—
there is no doubt about it —but I
know that there are 10 or 15 other
houses in just as bad or in worse
condition. Both of iyiy roommates—
pledges of two prominent fraterni
ties, were out like a light on pledge
day. They both had been taken "up
the road" and had absorbed so much
that their brothers-to-be had to
take them back to the houses and
put them to bed for the afternoon!
And this is just one pitiful case
out of many. I know that many fra
ternities completely disregarded sev
eral rushing rules, such as prohibi
' tion of off-campus rushing, etc.,
' which the "certain" house followed
i religiously.
Now I ask you, and I ask the
j sober students of Stanford: Is it fair
to punish severely one fraternity
and to expose all its bad points
without attempting to investigate
fraternity conditions in general? All
I can say is this: unless the board
! looks into other fraternities, this is
! a helluva deal!
