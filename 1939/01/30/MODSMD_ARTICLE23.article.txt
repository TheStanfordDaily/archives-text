The Editor Sir:
Doug Jaques:
A critic, as Webster puts it, is one
"disposed or competent to judge."
Do you aspire to that?
Constructive criticism, I am sure,
would be welcomed by the editor
and staff of the "Chaparral," who, it
would seem, are not letter perfect.
But straining conscientious, com
mendable effort through a rag such
as The Daily, merely to scrape the
already too well picked bone, seems
j a little on the short side of com
j mon sense. Or are you common?
Palo Alto Citizen
; The Editor, Sir:
' Doug Jaques:
i Well, Mr. God, now that you have
! passed judgment, what are you go
ing to do about it? What Chaparral
j needs on its staff is something good
j—a really good writer, like you, for
| instance. F. Y.
I The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the delightful "Lightly
i and Politely" that tried lightly and
| politely to squelch the Chaparral,
, we submit the following:
j It's certainly fortunate for The
Daily that its' circulation does not
i depend upon the salesmanship and
i beauty of its "babes." If this were
j the case, the horror-stricken stu
i dent body would cringe in fright
| and shriek in terror at the spectre,
i In humiliation and disgrace the il
lustrious Daily staff would have to
j resort to drowning themselves in the
Libe fountain, which is as shallow
j as they are.
Heavily and Rudely
P.S.: We suggest you substitute a
"Dear Dorothy Dix" column for
I "Lightly and Politely."

On receiving the so-called funny
1 magazine of the campus, I was dis
-1 gusted as I turned the leaves and
: found putrid, stinking jokes. It
i seems as though Stanford could pro
duce something more original and
funny than this anthology of weak,
| old, faltering quips, jokes old and
i worn out—jokes that merely take up
the space between bourgeoise ad
vertising.

The Editor Sir:
Doug Jaques:
A critic, as Webster puts it, is one
"disposed or competent to judge."
Do you aspire to that?
Constructive criticism, I am sure,
would be welcomed by the editor
and staff of the "Chaparral," who, it
would seem, are not letter perfect.
But straining conscientious, com
mendable effort through a rag such
as The Daily, merely to scrape the
already too well picked bone, seems
j a little on the short side of com
j mon sense. Or are you common?

; The Editor, Sir:
' Doug Jaques:
i Well, Mr. God, now that you have
! passed judgment, what are you go
ing to do about it? What Chaparral
j needs on its staff is something good
j—a really good writer, like you, for
| instance. F. Y.
I The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the delightful "Lightly
i and Politely" that tried lightly and
| politely to squelch the Chaparral,
, we submit the following:
j It's certainly fortunate for The
Daily that its' circulation does not
i depend upon the salesmanship and
i beauty of its "babes." If this were
j the case, the horror-stricken stu
i dent body would cringe in fright
| and shriek in terror at the spectre,
i In humiliation and disgrace the il
lustrious Daily staff would have to
j resort to drowning themselves in the
Libe fountain, which is as shallow
j as they are.
Heavily and Rudely
P.S.: We suggest you substitute a
"Dear Dorothy Dix" column for
I "Lightly and Politely."

The Editor, Sir:
On receiving the so-called funny
1 magazine of the campus, I was dis
-1 gusted as I turned the leaves and
: found putrid, stinking jokes. It
i seems as though Stanford could pro
duce something more original and
funny than this anthology of weak,
| old, faltering quips, jokes old and
i worn out—jokes that merely take up
the space between bourgeoise ad
vertising.
