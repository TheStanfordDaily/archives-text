# Labor Head Proposes Solution for Strikes
## 
### 
Proposing as a solution to labor's
problems an increase of enlightened
industrial unionism, John L. Mc-
Guire of the A. F. of L. Central
Labor Council gave the chief talk in
the annual Student-Worker Labor
Conference, held yesterday after
noon in the basement of the Wom
en's Clubhouse under the auspices
of the American Student Union and
the Y.W.CA.
Quoting a series of decisions which
have been reached in San Francisco
strikes, Mr. McGuire pointed out the
absurdities in them and proposed a
greatly broadened industrial union
ism, similar to that of the C.1.0. but
removed from the politics and arbi
trary leadership of the C.1.0., to
'restore sanity to the city's labor
scene.
"In the long run," he stated, "the
jurisdictional strike will kill the
labor unions unless something is
done about it. It succeeds only in
alienating public opinion, something
the unions cannot get along with
out."
Describing the work of the Pacific
School for Workers, Dr. George
Hedley, director, and chairman of
yesterday's conference, character

ized it as "a means of aiding the
worker to better fulfill his place in
society."
"More students from Stanford
than from any other university have
/"attended the school," he stated, "and
j"we have had at least one Stanford
I -professor on our faculty .each year"
The School was established in
*1933, according to Dr. Hedley, as the
I outgrowth of an earlier week-long
! conference. It is held each summer
j for one month, this year on the
I 'campus of the Pacific School of Re
' ligion in Berkeley. Anyone inter
j ested in attending the 1939 session
i may get in touch with Mary Beaton
j or Otis Brubaker.
