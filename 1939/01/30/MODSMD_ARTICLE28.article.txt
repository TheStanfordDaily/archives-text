## Farm, Chicago Men Discuss Education 
### 
Under pressure of time, Dr. Ray I
j Lyman Wilbur, Stanford president, i
briskly concluded the radio sympo- I
| sium on "Learning for Living" be- |
tween Stanford and Chicago de
-1 baters Saturday afternoon. Student :
i participants for Stanford were H. B.
> Lee, student body president, and
Nelson Norman, prominent debater. |
Because the program started three j
j minutes late, Dr. Wilbur's concluding
statement was briefly but composed- ,
; ly delivered, while a tense techni
cian peered through his glass win- '
j dow casting anxious glances first at
J the large clock overhead, then at
Dr. Wilbur. The Stanford president, {
however, had efficiently reorganized I
| his remarks and finished with time !
\ to spare: three seconds of it.
i Dr. Leland Chapin, varsity debate j
i coach, summed up the performances j
| of Lee and Norman with one obser
| vation: ' "Jhey certainly acquitted
! themselves admirably." Lee spoke
first, surveying the general educa- ;
! tional problems confronting the na- 1
tion today and questioning the mc^ - -
| its of educational theory applied at
j Chicago under the supervision of
; Robert M. Hutchins, president of
I that university.
In closing. Dr. Wilbur said, "Cer
tainly we do not want to have higher
j education standardized throughout
' the nation. That would take too
| much of the sparkle out of our com
j mon living and would certainly give
| but little chance for such a friendly'
| and interesting debate as this one to
j travel on the air between«two of our
j most interesting universities."
