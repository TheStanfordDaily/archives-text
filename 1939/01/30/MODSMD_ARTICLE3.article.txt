# Pueblo Indians Self-sufficient Though Poor, Debaters Find

### JACK BURTT 
Though the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico are poor and live by very
low standards, they are self-sufficient to a large degree, needing no aid
beyond what subsidies they get from the federal government at the pres
ent time, according to Bob Moulton, Farm debater, who made a study of
the economic condition of the Indians on the Christinas debate trip.

"The present status of the Indians"
is due to five things," he explained.
"These are falling prices, failure to
save for lean years, their habit of
selling an item to the traders in
the fall and buying the same item
back in the spring for twice the
price, their willingness to work for
$3 or $4 per week simply to be able
to live of! their reservations, and
their over-grazed lands which made
it necessary for the government to
cut the numbers of their stock."
Moulton pointed out that their eco
nomic system is essentially capital
istic. "They do have communal
lands where products for the poor
est Indians are grown, but the
main part of their lives is spent in
working for themselves," he added.
"Each family tries to be self-suffi
cient."
The Indians are subject to the
same economic forces as the white
businessman. Their surplus crops
are sold on the open market through
the trading posts, and prevailing
prices are paid for them. These
crops, chiefly corn, sheep, and cat
tle, pottery, blankets and rugs, cu
rios, souvenirs, silver work, leather
goods, and furs are the main com
modities sold by the Indians.
"The traders are fair to the point
of near-benevolency," Moulton com
mented. "They are the basis for the
Indian's trade."
Many Indians are working on
WPA projects in the Indian terri
tory for the benefit of other Indians.
Water is a problem in New Mexico,
and government engineers are di
recting irrigation projects for the
Indians, Moulton concluded.
