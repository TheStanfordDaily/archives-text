# Farm Hoopsters Grab Two Wins
## Bears Pake One, Lose One with U.S.C. Olympic Club, College of Pacific Bow; 
### 
While Cal's first-place stock fell and then soared in a surprising week T j
end of basketball fluctuation, Stanford's varsity hoopsters, without the 1
pressure of league opposition, grabbed off a couple of practice game
victories in line style.
Both the Indians and U.C.L.A. were idle in league competition but i
will get back into the Southern Division cage Yace when they hook up in^

the Pavilion next Friday and Satur-<
day nights. The two-game series |
should demonstrate whether the
Cards are going to be an upper
flight contender along with Cal and
U.S.C. or just a lower division out
fit, struggling to keep out of the
cellar.
Caddy Works' Bruins, who have
played in the conference cellar so
long that they are known as the
perennial door-step champions,

have rounded up a fighting ball
club, which made things mighty in
teresting for Cal and the Trojans in
the first three league set-to's. The
only difference between Stanford
and U.C.L.A. is that Coach Everett
Dean has been able to throw a little
more polish onto his club's offensive
and defensive attacks so that they
look just about as good in defeat as
they do when they win.
OLYMPIC CLUB TOUGH
Although looking good in taking
the two triumphs, Coach Dean had
to get his club to really hustle in
their game with the Olympic Club,
when they spotted the Winged O
eight points with only nine minutes
to go and then took the decision,
47-44. There just wasn't much to
the College of the Pacific's cagers
who were tripped, 52-30, Saturday.
Dividing their crucial two-game
series with the Trojans in Los An
geles, Cal's cage giants put the
brakes on Ralph Vaughn, while Bill
Ogilvie and Harvey Shirk gave the
Bears a 36-34 upset Saturday after
losing 38-34 the night before. All
that did for the Bears was bounce
them to the top of the standings
with a full-game edge over the Tro
jans, and did the Indians the favor
of leaving U.S.C. only two games
out in front and within striking
distance, if the Cards can trim the
lowly Bruins this week.
REGULARS TAKE REST
Coach Dean gave most of his
regulars a good rest when he start
ed makeshift line-ups in both en
gagements, but instead of turning
out to be so-so, the irregulars had
a few individual ball aces in their
own right. Don Wililams, who has
been holding down third string
regularly since the season opened,
started both games. The fact that
not one of the scoring stars turned
in two hustling games will go
well with him when Dean starts
calling for subs in the crucial league
games coming up.
Of course Don Burness and Ken
ny Da/vidson actually led the In
dians to victory against the Pacific
team, but their performances are
generally conceded to be steady
since they have been playing first
string regularly. Both tossed in .10
points Saturday to lead the scoring.
High scoring over the week-end was
Harlan Copsey, who netted 18
points. Phil Zonne had 16. Williams
hit the bucket for five field goals in
the two games and fed the ball well
in setting up his teammates for
shots.

The ourangoutang, chimpanzee and j
gorilla are the three animals most J
closely resembling man.

played in the conference cellar so
long that they are known as the
perennial door-step champions,

have rounded up a fighting ball
club, which made things mighty in
teresting for Cal and the Trojans in
the first three league set-to's. The
only difference between Stanford
and U.C.L.A. is that Coach Everett
Dean has been able to throw a little
more polish onto his club's offensive
and defensive attacks so that they
look just about as good in defeat as
they do when they win.
OLYMPIC CLUB TOUGH
Although looking good in taking
the two triumphs, Coach Dean had
to get his club to really hustle in
their game with the Olympic Club,
when they spotted the Winged O
eight points with only nine minutes
to go and then took the decision,
47-44. There just wasn't much to
the College of the Pacific's cagers
who were tripped, 52-30, Saturday.
Dividing their crucial two-game
series with the Trojans in Los An
geles, Cal's cage giants put the
brakes on Ralph Vaughn, while Bill
Ogilvie and Harvey Shirk gave the
Bears a 36-34 upset Saturday after
losing 38-34 the night before. All
that did for the Bears was bounce
them to the top of the standings
with a full-game edge over the Tro
jans, and did the Indians the favor
of leaving U.S.C. only two games
out in front and within striking
distance, if the Cards can trim the
lowly Bruins this week.
REGULARS TAKE REST
Coach Dean gave most of his
regulars a good rest when he start
ed makeshift line-ups in both en
gagements, but instead of turning
out to be so-so, the irregulars had
a few individual ball aces in their
own right. Don Wililams, who has
been holding down third string
regularly since the season opened,
started both games. The fact that
not one of the scoring stars turned
in two hustling games will go
well with him when Dean starts
calling for subs in the crucial league
games coming up.
Of course Don Burness and Ken
ny Da/vidson actually led the In
dians to victory against the Pacific
team, but their performances are
generally conceded to be steady
since they have been playing first
string regularly. Both tossed in .10
points Saturday to lead the scoring.
High scoring over the week-end was
Harlan Copsey, who netted 18
points. Phil Zonne had 16. Williams
hit the bucket for five field goals in
the two games and fed the ball well
in setting up his teammates for
shots.

The ourangoutang, chimpanzee and j
gorilla are the three animals most J
closely resembling man.
While Cal's first-place stock fell and then soared in a surprising week T j
end of basketball fluctuation, Stanford's varsity hoopsters, without the 1
pressure of league opposition, grabbed off a couple of practice game
victories in line style.
Both the Indians and U.C.L.A. were idle in league competition but i
will get back into the Southern Division cage Yace when they hook up in^

the Pavilion next Friday and Satur-<
day nights. The two-game series |
should demonstrate whether the
Cards are going to be an upper
flight contender along with Cal and
U.S.C. or just a lower division out
fit, struggling to keep out of the
cellar.
