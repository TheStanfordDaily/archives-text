# Frosh Swamp Two Opponents Over Week-end
## Sacramento, Auburn Lose 45-27, 45-32; Subs Given Chance 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Very effectively —to say the J
least — Stanford's freshman basket- !
bailers polished off two more cage :
opponents over the week-end.
Sacramento Junior College was
the first to oblige and give Coach |
H. B. Lee's colorful outfit a 45-27
victory. Auburn Jaysee turned out
to be the frosh's seventh victim of j
the season when they took the j
count, 45-32. j
In both games, Lee could have
left his first stringers—or the seven
regulars who usually take care of J
the starting assignments — in the J
game and built up a (50-odd score, j
but instead he chose to give most j
of his subs a chance to get into ac
tion. As a result he came up with j
a couple of players who looked good 1
while in there and who may be the j
leading role when the Papooses j
tackle Visalia Junior College and \
Mission High School of San Fran- J
cisco this Friday and Saturday.
PENN, COWDEN STAR
Bob Penn and Bill Cowden, who j
at this writing look as if they'd be
the only ones to have a really good ]
chance of making the varsity next !
year, came out of both scraps with |
their usually fine performances. |
Penn accounted ofr 27 points in the ,
two games and Cowden hit the hoop
for 19 points.
The lanky center. Penn, was par
ticularly effective in his tipping-in
shots which his teammates missed,
while Cowden found the bucket in
long shots from beyond the foul
circle or after breaking away from
his guard.
Unsung subs in the past, Messina,
Deacon, Claflin and Petteys, played I
outstanding ball while in the two'
games.
SECOND HALF ROUT
To show how effectively and
thoroughly the first string tied up I
Auburn Jaysee, the frosh offer this!
as a second-half Exhibit A:
Reese sinks one from around the '
foul circle and Penn is set up by i
Chuck Smith. Auburn makes three!
points on a field goal and foul shot j
but Penn sinks a free shot and then i
puts one in when a team-mate's
shot rolls off the backboard. Cowden
goes into action with two field goals,
one from the foul ring and the other
while going away from the basket,
a la Luisetti.
Reese fakes and sinks one from
the foul circle again and Smith fol
lows it up with a set shot passed in
by Dick Ray, the clever little for
ward. Deacon subs for Penn and
sinks one on a set shot and Cowden
makes another one from the edge of
the circle. Auburn finally makes j
three more points as the frosh subs
start coming in.
