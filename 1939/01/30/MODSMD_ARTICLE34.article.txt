jfJUMORS about Stanford football
coaches are wisely taken with a
grain of salt.
Wolves that bark at the B.A.C.
door arc strictly Stanford grid
fans, and their loyalty must have
kept them from gritting their
teeth with a defeated cause when
Tiny Thornhill's Indians showed
their stuff against California and
Dartmouth. Some continue to
howl, but their voices are soft
and their arguments weak.
If Stanford fans would only read
beyond the scores and consider the
outcome of the 1938 season in the
light of statistics and handicaps; if
they would realize that there were
times when, if another reserve back
had been needed, Tiny would have
had to send a manager in; perhaps
they would be convinced that Tiny
turned out a fine team; a team
which, despite handicaps, was only
four touchdowns from the Rose
Bowl.
Latest publicized rumor is the
possibility of Pop Warner's return
to Stanford as an advisory coach.
But the rumor itself is over a
month old; it was passing in in
ternal circles about the time of
the Rose Bowl game. Sudden pub
licity gives it the atmosphere of
a political campaign, which is hard
to explain.
There being no room for com
plaint. the idea appears weak at the
outset; but there are other factors
in connection with this particular
rumor that are worth consideration.
First of all, Stanford uses the War
ner system, and nobody is better
qualified to map the plays than Pop
Warner himself, admittedly one of
the nation's outstanding offensive
coaches.
But any leader, whether he be
a corporation president or colonel
of a regiment, knows that {he sug
gested staff set-up will not work.
Thornhill and Warner have been
head coaches for some time, and
thought they arc close friends and
mutual admirers, they can hardly
be expected, under ordinary cir
cumstances. to work smoothly to
gether with almost equal respon
sibility even though one acts in
an advisory capacity.

Digging deeper into the facts, we
are confronted with a truly touch
ing picture. We see an old gentle
man who has known and loved
Stanford to an/ extent almost incon
ceivable in our young eyes, a man
who has spent five football seasons
in the East longing constantly to re
turn to familiar soil, a man who
may now be hoping for a chance to
spend his later years where he has
spent his happiest ones — with au
thoirty to keep a hand in his fa
vorite stew.
These arguments have not been
presented by promoters of the
movement, because they have read
Dale Carnegie and they know bet
ter than to believe they can jerk
tears from the eyes of the B.A.C.
Let us continue to regard the ru
mors and publicized issues lightly.
But if the powers-that-be can fig
ure out some system at their meet
ing on February 11, which will
bring Pop Warner back to Stanford
and to football without questioning
in any way the proven worth of
Stanford's present grid mentor, they
will by their efforts and diplomacy
perform a service that Stanford, as
a university, will discover and ap
preciate in years to come.

their stuff against California and
Dartmouth. Some continue to
howl, but their voices are soft
and their arguments weak.
If Stanford fans would only read
beyond the scores and consider the
outcome of the 1938 season in the
light of statistics and handicaps; if
they would realize that there were
times when, if another reserve back
had been needed, Tiny would have
had to send a manager in; perhaps
they would be convinced that Tiny
turned out a fine team; a team
which, despite handicaps, was only
four touchdowns from the Rose
Bowl.
Latest publicized rumor is the
possibility of Pop Warner's return
to Stanford as an advisory coach.
But the rumor itself is over a
month old; it was passing in in
ternal circles about the time of
the Rose Bowl game. Sudden pub
licity gives it the atmosphere of
a political campaign, which is hard
to explain.
There being no room for com
plaint. the idea appears weak at the
outset; but there are other factors
in connection with this particular
rumor that are worth consideration.
First of all, Stanford uses the War
ner system, and nobody is better
qualified to map the plays than Pop
Warner himself, admittedly one of
the nation's outstanding offensive
coaches.
But any leader, whether he be
a corporation president or colonel
of a regiment, knows that {he sug
gested staff set-up will not work.
Thornhill and Warner have been
head coaches for some time, and
thought they arc close friends and
mutual admirers, they can hardly
be expected, under ordinary cir
cumstances. to work smoothly to
gether with almost equal respon
sibility even though one acts in
an advisory capacity.

Digging deeper into the facts, we
are confronted with a truly touch
ing picture. We see an old gentle
man who has known and loved
Stanford to an/ extent almost incon
ceivable in our young eyes, a man
who has spent five football seasons
in the East longing constantly to re
turn to familiar soil, a man who
may now be hoping for a chance to
spend his later years where he has
spent his happiest ones — with au
thoirty to keep a hand in his fa
vorite stew.
These arguments have not been
presented by promoters of the
movement, because they have read
Dale Carnegie and they know bet
ter than to believe they can jerk
tears from the eyes of the B.A.C.
Let us continue to regard the ru
mors and publicized issues lightly.
But if the powers-that-be can fig
ure out some system at their meet
ing on February 11, which will
bring Pop Warner back to Stanford
and to football without questioning
in any way the proven worth of
Stanford's present grid mentor, they
will by their efforts and diplomacy
perform a service that Stanford, as
a university, will discover and ap
preciate in years to come.
jfJUMORS about Stanford football
coaches are wisely taken with a
grain of salt.
Wolves that bark at the B.A.C.
door arc strictly Stanford grid
fans, and their loyalty must have
kept them from gritting their
teeth with a defeated cause when
Tiny Thornhill's Indians showed
their stuff against California and
Dartmouth. Some continue to
