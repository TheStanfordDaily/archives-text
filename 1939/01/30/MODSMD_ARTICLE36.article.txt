# Senior Poolmen Sneak by Frosh In 58-56 Win
## Herron Tops National Freshman 220 Mark Of 2:18 by 2 Seconds 
### 
A fighting crop of seniors upset
I the dope sheet Saturday afternoon
at the Encina Pools, and eked out a
; 58-56 interclass swimming victory
over an astonishing freshman team
paced by a tow-headed youngster
who cracked one national freshman
swimming record and lowered two
Stanford frosh pool marks.
And those amazing boys from
Encina almost came through with
the first victory ever staged by a
Stanford freshman team in an in
i terclass meet. Leading the defend
| ing champions by two points, with
i only the relay left to go, they were
i forced to be content with third
place points and second in the totals
The final score found the third
place sophomores with 34 points,
while the two-man junior team
wound up with 2 digits.
ADAMS INJURED
Luck was a heavy factor in the
seniors' victory. Howard Adams,
I frosh diver who was a top favorite
to topple Senior Roy Winkelmann,
met with an injury and handed the
j seniors enough points, by default,
! to win the meet.
Most impressive individual per
; formance of the meet was that of
newly-elected frosh captain Paul
Herron. Herron's 2:16 mark in the
220 shattered the existing national
freshman record by two seconds,
! incidentally clipping four seconds
| from the previous Stanford frosh
' mark.
NEW FROSII RECORD
; In the 440-yard event, Herron
| sped to a new Card freshman rec
! ord, leading Conference Champion
Win Needham to the tape by a
full pool length. In his third ap
| pearance of the day, he captured
first honors in the 200-yard race.
Best contest of the meet was the
200-yard breaststroke race between
Sophomore Roy Vitousek and Fresh
i man Scott Dudley. Dudley tagged
wall inches before the sopho
more, failing .by only :0.2 seconds
| to better Vitousek's own freshman
1 record in this event.
