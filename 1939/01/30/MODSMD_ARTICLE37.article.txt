Coming back after trailing in the

J team registered an 11-5 victory Sat
urday afternoon over the strong
University Club outfit, while in the
second game the Cardinal "B" squad
made it an all-Stanford day by
! spanking the University Club sec
j onds 6-3.
D;jve Carnahan's educated toe
I turned the trick in the first set-to.
After missing conversion on Pete
! Fay's try in the first half, he re
i deemed himself with a perfect boot
j after a second half score by Jim
i Grubbs, adding three more points in
1 the same period with a penalty
i kick from 25 yards out.
Fay's score came early in the first
half. Little Pete capitalized on his
football experience by running 30
yards through a broken field after
a lateral pass attack coming out of
a Stanford scrum.
Shortly after, the University Club
| team countered with a 25-yard run
|by Dixie Powell for a try, and
| jumped into the half-time lead
j when Nix converted for two more
I points.
It was then that Cijrnahan booted
; the first of his winning kicks, con
i verting on a penalty kick from a
! difficult angle to put the Farm squad
! into a (5-5 lead.
Jim Grubbs crossed the visiting
team's goal line again after plung
| ing through a pile-up from the five
; yard line to put the Maloney-men
! definitely into the lead. Carnahan's
i conversion ended the scoring.
