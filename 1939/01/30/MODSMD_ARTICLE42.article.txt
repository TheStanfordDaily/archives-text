# Chicago Graded and Shaded
## 
### 
CONDUCTED under difficulties but con
cluded with unshaken imperturbability,
the University of Chicago-Stanford University
radio debate Saturday came to an end with a
significant statement by the latter's President.
Objecting to "standardization" in education,
Dr. Wilbur rejected the oft-made proposal by
Chicago's Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins that
American universities in general should ac
cept the philosophical approach to learning
which he has revived and re-popularized. Too
much similarity in higher education, Dr. Wilbur
felt, would result in an inevitable leveling-off,
and at a level he intimated might not be com
pletely desirable.
With this thesis there can be no quarrel.
Nor can there be any possibility of its ever
being refuted in actual fact. To standardize
higher education over an area the size of the
United States would take an energy that no one,
not even Dr. Hutchins, possesses. And to for
malize college curricula to a nation-wide pat
tern would be a task beyond even the scope of
a government—if any government in America
were ever permitted to try it. With Dr. Wilbur's
plea for diversity there can be only agreement.
In behalf of Dr. Hutchins, however, it might
be well to point out that his basic idea is praise
worthy. Although it has taken a somewhat
sensational turn, his main aim is good. He him
self is protesting against a standardization; a
standardization not of subject-matter, but of
curriculum.
Within the narrow confines of the unit-and
grade system, somewhere under the dead mass
of requirements, there exists in the American
collge today an education. Most get an occa
sional hint of it as they pass through the four
years which constitute a normal university ca
reer; very few ever find it. It is because he
thinks that more should do so that Dr. Hutchins
has revised the Chicago curriculum so drasti
cally.
Progress in the field of higher education
must be made slowly, for the colleges deal
with the greatest variable ever known: the hu
man mind. The answer does not lie in complete
liberalization of curriculum; no more does it lie
in a rigid system of grades and requirements.
Independent study tries hard to solve the
problem; but at present its benefits are restricted
to a select and artificially chosen few. As yet
they are not extended to the general student;
up to the present there has been no broadening
of the democratic basis of education to include
the rank-and-file collegian.
It is because Dr. Hutchins is attempting to
give learning a wider basis that he deserves
credit. In that sense, at least, "standardiza
tion" in American higher education cannot be
criticized with any real justice.—A. S. D.
