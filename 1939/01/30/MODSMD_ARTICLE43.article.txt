# Science and the Mammon
## 
### 
FOR some time, foua Stanford physicists have
been v/orking late hours in the musty, small,
dark quarters under Physics Corner, where
they some day hoped to find a means of de
veloping ultra-short waves.
Last Saturday, they officially announced the
success of their venture.
So successful have they been that other
scientists have even ventured to stick their
necks out in a dignified way and predict what
may be done with the high-frequency develop
ment.
What is significant besides their success,
however, is the fact that amidst the groans of

typical critics of pure science these Stanford
men have proved that pure science is conscious
of the needs of industry and related fields.
For a long time, it has been practically an
axiom that theoretical science has always
needed funds, that financial support of research
has been noticeably lacking, and that scientists
have been practically forced to invent new ex
plosives to secure any financial backing.
Despite these difficulties, despite deplorable
laboratory conditions, the four men labored
long, imagined freely, developed "the most
important advance in radio since 1906."
With this much done, then, perhaps Stan
ford scientists can look forward to more finan
cial support from hard-headed pragmatists,
should, at least, find a more sympathetic re
ception.â€”H. L. S.
