# BULL SESSION
## THE 						QUALITY OF MERCY 
### JOHN COBBS 
W/TIEN Interfraternity Board of Control disciplined
a "certain fraternity" last week, it showed a tal
ent for administration that takes it out of the amateur
class. Somehow it managed to work out a decision
that applied the best principles of morality, justice,
and diplomacy. Even Solomon in his prime never
wrote a better opinion.
Plato, I believe, pointed out some time ago that
a good judge was one who could take a firm stand
while straddling the fence between sentimentality and
sanctimony. According to this standard, Interfrater
nity Board looks like good supreme court material.
It managed to punish the offenders mercifully, and
soothe outraged authority at the same time. That is
almost a definition of practical justice.

W/'HEN the trouble came up, the board found itself
playing no-man's land for two opposing pressure
groups. The fraternity had tossed a jolly if indis
creet party on pledge day, thereby thumbing its
Grecian nose at all the Stanford laws of God and man.
Insulted virtue demanded that the house be thrown off
the campus, with its members accompanying it. Ex
tremists even indicated that a little purging in the
Russian manner would be appropriate if somebody
could figure out a way to keep the district attorney
from hearing about it. <
On the other side, various pressure groups fought
for complete acquittal. Boys, they said, will be boys,
And they spoke darkly about him who is guiltless
casting the first stone, implying that if that rule were
followed, rock throwing would become a lost art.

Interfraternity board had to tread gingerly between
Victorian morality and slushy sentimentality. And it
turned in one of the neatest bits of gingerly treading
on record, soiling its shoes with neither.
The decision puts the house on social and scholas
tic probation, which means that if it leads a blameless
career in the future, it will get off without punish
ment. Seniors will have to move out of the house,
an annoying ruling, but one that puts the blame
where it best belongs.
* * * *
The members of the house have not been dismissed
with a sentimental pat on the head. But neither have
they been thrown out of school. The punishment has
been equated with the crime.
And so it appears that the board has been able
to navigate in a straight line of justice despite the
contradictory shoves of sympathy and of outraged
virtue. It has combined mercy and practical necessity
in equal parts. Justice should be smiling under her
blindfold.
