### DOUG JAQUES 
PURELY FICTITIOUS
It was nearly 10 o'clock when he slammed his
book shut, jumped up and ran. over to Roble. She
was waiting for him in the lobby.
"Why, I'll never know," she said.
But she was waiting. He made a jumble of sounds
which meant, "Come on, we've got to hurry."
"You've been running again," she said.
He simpered. "Yeah."
Resignedly she said, "Let's go."
Steering her somewhat more gently than he did
the plow on his father's farm during the summer, he
propdled her to the Union.
They went into the Cellar to one of those semi
lovers'-paradLse-booths. You know, one of those
booths out in the center which, at about 10 o'clock at
night, are delightfully dark. But shockingly out there
in the open.
Quickly, if not too gracefully, he got two cokes and
brought them back to the booth.
"You've been running again," she said.
He simpered. "Yeah." He took an embarrassed
and spasmodic gulp of coke. And choked on a very
large piece of ice.
During the rest of his coke he was more careful.
They didn't say anything. He quietly watched her
drink her coke. In his eyes there was the light of
love.
To the people in the booth across the way, it
looked as if he were ogling her. It was nothing of
the sort.
After a little he lifted his hand to the table. He
started moving it slowly nearer to her.
"No, not here," she said. .»
"It's dark, no one would notice."
"Yes they would."
"Let me."
"Oh, all right." She moved a little to the corner
of the booth.
Quickly he grabbed her glass, and squeezed it
until he was red in the face. The glass collapsed in
his hand, shattered.
"See. I told you I could do it.."
H<* didn't know what he would do if he didn't
I have something new to show her every night when
he brought her to the Union.
The time would come, he told himself, when he
would kiss her good-night.

his hand, shattered.
"See. I told you I could do it.."
H<* didn't know what he would do if he didn't
I have something new to show her every night when
he brought her to the Union.
The time would come, he told himself, when he
would kiss her good-night.

FATE
The man and woman who run one of our favorite
late-at-night eating spots in Palo Alto are going to
marry today or tomorrow.
They had planned to be married Sunday. Only he
forgot to get up in time to get the license.
PURELY FICTITIOUS
It was nearly 10 o'clock when he slammed his
book shut, jumped up and ran. over to Roble. She
was waiting for him in the lobby.
"Why, I'll never know," she said.
But she was waiting. He made a jumble of sounds
which meant, "Come on, we've got to hurry."
"You've been running again," she said.
He simpered. "Yeah."
Resignedly she said, "Let's go."
Steering her somewhat more gently than he did
the plow on his father's farm during the summer, he
propdled her to the Union.
They went into the Cellar to one of those semi
lovers'-paradLse-booths. You know, one of those
booths out in the center which, at about 10 o'clock at
night, are delightfully dark. But shockingly out there
in the open.
Quickly, if not too gracefully, he got two cokes and
brought them back to the booth.
"You've been running again," she said.
He simpered. "Yeah." He took an embarrassed
and spasmodic gulp of coke. And choked on a very
large piece of ice.
During the rest of his coke he was more careful.
They didn't say anything. He quietly watched her
drink her coke. In his eyes there was the light of
love.
To the people in the booth across the way, it
looked as if he were ogling her. It was nothing of
the sort.
After a little he lifted his hand to the table. He
started moving it slowly nearer to her.
"No, not here," she said. .»
"It's dark, no one would notice."
"Yes they would."
"Let me."
"Oh, all right." She moved a little to the corner
of the booth.
Quickly he grabbed her glass, and squeezed it
until he was red in the face. The glass collapsed in
his hand, shattered.
"See. I told you I could do it.."
