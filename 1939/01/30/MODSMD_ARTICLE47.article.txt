# CAMPUS OPINION
## FLIERS STRIKE BACK 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
An injustice has been done the
cause of civilian flying by the edi
torial appearing in The Daily yes
terday. While we sympathize with
the anti-war spirit of the article, it
seems certain that the writer has
been misled concerning the form of
the civilian pilot training movement,
and has presented a very incorrect
picture of its aims.
The true picture is far different
from that of the editorial. Except
for government supervision of ex
penditures and qualifications of in
structors, the movement will be a
civilian one from start to finish.
Civilian instructors will train civil
ian student pilots in civilian ships on
civilian fields to qualify for civilian
licenses. Pilots so trained will have
no army status whatsoever.
ADVANTAGES OF TRAINING
Far from composing a militarist
element, the men who have had
this training will better realize the
waste and futility of war and will
have seen for themselves the de
glamorized hazards it entails. Here
will be a pacifist force with con
crete facts to back its contentions.
As for the training itself, it holds
real advantages for the men who
receive it. In civilian life, flying
ability is daily becoming more de
sirable. In many of the technical
branches of business, a knowledge
of flying is a tangible asset to the
graduate looking for a job. The
fact remains that this advantage is
going to be given to the men in
other colleges in the nation, and the.
requirements of competition demand
that Stanford graduates be able to
match it.
FACE THE FACTS
Let's face reality! If this country
SHOULD be forced into a war and
we do have to fight it, isn't it a hell
of a lot better to go into action with
some previous experience and
knowledge of what you must do?
Lift your men out of the "cannon
fodder" class; give us a chance to
know something of what we'll be
facing.
A parting word, directed at the
verbose crank who signed himself
Grad in yesterday's Campus Opin
ion. Is a man qualified to design an
automobile if he has never driven
one? And we are headed for the
school of aeronautics of which he
speaks so glibly. Get your head out
of the sand, Ostrich!

and has presented a very incorrect
picture of its aims.
The true picture is far different
from that of the editorial. Except
for government supervision of ex
penditures and qualifications of in
structors, the movement will be a
civilian one from start to finish.
Civilian instructors will train civil
ian student pilots in civilian ships on
civilian fields to qualify for civilian
licenses. Pilots so trained will have
no army status whatsoever.
ADVANTAGES OF TRAINING
Far from composing a militarist
element, the men who have had
this training will better realize the
waste and futility of war and will
have seen for themselves the de
glamorized hazards it entails. Here
will be a pacifist force with con
crete facts to back its contentions.
As for the training itself, it holds
real advantages for the men who
receive it. In civilian life, flying
ability is daily becoming more de
sirable. In many of the technical
branches of business, a knowledge
of flying is a tangible asset to the
graduate looking for a job. The
fact remains that this advantage is
going to be given to the men in
other colleges in the nation, and the.
requirements of competition demand
that Stanford graduates be able to
match it.
FACE THE FACTS
Let's face reality! If this country
SHOULD be forced into a war and
we do have to fight it, isn't it a hell
of a lot better to go into action with
some previous experience and
knowledge of what you must do?
Lift your men out of the "cannon
fodder" class; give us a chance to
know something of what we'll be
facing.
A parting word, directed at the
verbose crank who signed himself
Grad in yesterday's Campus Opin
ion. Is a man qualified to design an
automobile if he has never driven
one? And we are headed for the
school of aeronautics of which he
speaks so glibly. Get your head out
of the sand, Ostrich!

The Editor, Sir:
An injustice has been done the
cause of civilian flying by the edi
torial appearing in The Daily yes
terday. While we sympathize with
the anti-war spirit of the article, it
seems certain that the writer has
been misled concerning the form of
the civilian pilot training movement,
and has presented a very incorrect
picture of its aims.
The true picture is far different
from that of the editorial. Except
for government supervision of ex
penditures and qualifications of in
structors, the movement will be a
civilian one from start to finish.
Civilian instructors will train civil
ian student pilots in civilian ships on
civilian fields to qualify for civilian
licenses. Pilots so trained will have
