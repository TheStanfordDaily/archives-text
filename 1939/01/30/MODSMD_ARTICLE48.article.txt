The Editor, Sir:
And of course if cars were for
bidden on the campus, as has been
suggested, it would mean that many
of us would have to quit school; for
we depend on our cars to get us to
work between classes, at noon, and
immediately after afternoon ses
sions.
That would be my caseâ€”l know
it is true of others.
