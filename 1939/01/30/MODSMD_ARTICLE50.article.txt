# Taylor Virile, Scenario Weak In New Film
## 
### 
"Stand Up and Fight," playing at the
Stanford Theater
This is the third in the series of
M.G.M. efforts to put hair on Robert
Taylor's chest. One more and he
will be worthy of the name role in
the next King Kong picture.
In "Yank at Oxford" Mr. Taylor
was a heel, but he was regenerated
by the love of a good woman; in
"Stand Up and Fight" he is a heel
and a weakling. Florence Rice and
the B. & O. Railroad take care of
the regeneration angle.
TAYLOR vs. RICE
The time is 1844, Taylor is the
spoiled but penniless scion of a
Maryland plantation. While seeking
to recoup his fortunes, he becomes a
railroad detective, investigating the
slave-running activities of Wallace
Beery who is ostensibly the manager
of Miss Rice's stage-coach line. Tay
lor versus Beery; Taylor versus
Rice; Taylor versus a lot of mus
tached frontier characters who dis
like dudes; and finally, Taylor versus
those reactionaries who dislike prog
ress, personified in the railroad.
True to the tradition of his brave
blue-blooded ancestors, our hero tri
umphs over all his adversaries, and
emerges a finer and truer man.
BEERY AS USUAL
Wallace Beery whuffles through
his usual parts in his usual un
washed fashion, supplying those
laughs which are intended. There
are many other laughs, but these
were unintentionally added by the
scenario-writers.
Fights, guns and fists make up a
goodly portion of the picture, and
Taylor is allowed to appear with
blood practically covering his beau
tiful face.
The picture was filmed in sepia
film, and is lovely to look at. How
ever, if its prospective customers de
mand intelligent entertainment, they
are advised to save their money. But
it does a lot for Taylor's hair.—Now
