### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
two hours and fourteen min
utes the world held its breath
yesterday, listening to the pulse
beat of peace. When Adolf Hitler
finished his Reichstag speech, mil
lions of men relaxed, relieved to
know that he whom they fear is not
ready to go to war.
In his address, telling of the
achievement, the power, and the
problems of Nazi Germany, was no
declaration of the Reich's support
for Italian aggression against France
in the Mediterranean, no threat to
light for the return of African col
onies lost after the Great War, no
proclamation of a drive into wheat
basin of eastern Europe. Der Fueh
rer gave the world cause to sit up
and take notice, but not to reach
for its guns.

/ I EMENTING the solidity of the
' Rome-Berlin axis, Herr Hit
ler announced his intention of
supporting Italy in the event of
any attack made against her, hut
he promised no aid for Mussolini's
aggressive Mediterranean proj
ects.
Firmly the Nazi dictator demand
ed the return of the African colo
nies taken from Germany by the
Treaty of Versailles, but the threat
grew weak when he told the Reich
stag that he would not use war to
force the issue.
* * iii
Hitler turned to the recent
attacks on the Reich by lead
ers of the great democracies, his
words struck home. Lashing out
against American interference and
criticism of the Nazi international
policy, der Fuehrer warned the
United States not to interfere with
the commercial relationships be
tween Germany and the Latin
American nations.
"Mind your own damn busi
ness," was the gist of Herr Hit
ler's remarks to President Roose
velt and Secretary of the Interior
Harold Ickcs, whom he impres
sively titled, "an apostle of war."
However, despite all his puffing
and blowing, the world's number
one bogey-man did not say one
word which can be interpreted as a
direct threat to peace. That Adolf
Hitler, he's SO tactful!

W/ITH a remarkable lack of spec
tacular finesse, the Spanish In
surgents are going about the busi
ness of wiping the Loyalists off the
map of Catalonia. Yesterday's re
ports on the situation are a bit con
fusing since the Rebels announce a
smashing drive north to the French
border, and at the same time Re
publican bulletins claim that a re
habilitated offensive has brought the
Franco men to a standstill.
All Loyalist refugees, not fit for
military service, have been per
mitted to cross the French fron
tier and settle themselves in
make-shift concentration camps,
hut the soldiers of Barcelona will
have to face the vengeance of
Franco. Certain it is that their
names are listed in his little black
hook.
JN the New World yesterday most
eyes and ears were trained on
Adolf Hitler, but at the same time
the Supreme Court of the United
States made a major decision spell
ing success for the Tennessee Val
ley Authority. Answering the chal
lenge of 14 private utility companies,
the nine old men ruled that their
claim that the TV A invades rights
reserved to the states is not a valid
basis for suit.
The decision hinges on a tech
nicality, but it practically insures
the nation's great power plant
against further attacks.
Instead of promptly passing the
President's reduced relief bill, the
House of Representatives yester
day referred it to a conference
committee. It is practically cer
tain that the act, already approv
ed by the Senate, will not suffer
further reductions, but will
inerelv he amended in committee.
