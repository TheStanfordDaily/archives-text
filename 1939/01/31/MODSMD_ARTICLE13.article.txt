# Conference To Follow Voting Plan
## Women's Elections To Be Superintended By Nominating Group 
### 
As a result of favorable opinion
on the functioning of the nominat
ing committee in women's elections
last spring, Women's Conference
pjans to try this scheme again for
mid-year elections.
Membership on the committee
elected yesterday includes women
who have expressed divergent opin
ions on the advisability of the nomi
nation procedure, and it is hoped
that this will bring forth suggestions
fbr improvement of its function
ing.
ADVANTAGES MANY
However, Conference feels that
the advantages of the system far
outweigh the drawbacks, and that |
the system will be repeated for |
spring elections. This was discussed j
and voted on in house meetings last |
week.
The committee is elected on a I
representative basis with its chief
function the interviewing of pos
sible candidates for offices. Among
advantages brought forth in support
of the system is the fact that it ex
cludes those ineligible for office by
making a thorough investigation of
their standing and grades and af
fords equal opportunities to aLI, as
anyone may hand in his own or a
friend's name to the committee. And
a prime factor is that the group
explains the duties and functions of
various offices which candidates
often do not realize, thus tending
toward greater efficiency in admin
istration.
