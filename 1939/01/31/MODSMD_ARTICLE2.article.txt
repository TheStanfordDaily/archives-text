# Farm Institute Eyes Nazi Wheal

### 
The Stanford University Food Re
scarch Institute reported today that
"the two fascist nations (Germany
and Italy) have shown anxiety to
increase stocks and little tendency
to relax restrictions on wheat con
sumption in the face of larger do
mestic supplies."
This wheat accumulation has been
taking place since the Czechoslo
vakia crisis last September and
the survey said wheat shipments to
Europe through mid-January were
the largest in seven years.
Practically the only concession to
wheat consumption, made by the
German government, has been
change in requirements for admix
ture by other flour with wheat
flour.
