# Speech Bureau Springs from Quake
## 
### MARGE HOVEY 
Six years ago Long Beach had an
earthquake, Chuck Schafer had an j
idea and—indirectly—Stanford got j
a new activity.
During the earthquake Chuck or- !
ganized a group of speakers to go l
out and sell bonds to rebuild de- I
molished school buildings. They .
sold their bonds, the schools were ;
rebuilt, and Chuck Schafer came to |
Stanford.
Chuck came to the Farm full of
ideas and enthusiasm. He was j
amazed when he learned that speak
ers from Stanford were in great de- i
mand, but there were no speakers. 1
Political Science Professor Edwin
Cottrell was constantly having to re
fuse Farm speakers to peninsula j
clubs.
Schafer mixed together some of'
his ideas and enthusiasm and came '
out with the Stanford Speakers' j
Bureau. which would provide
speakers on all subjects to any I
nearby organization.
OFFICIAL OKAY
The bureau was okayed by Ex l
Committee ' and endorsed by Cam
pus Leaders Bobby Grayson, Jim!
Reynolds, . and Bones Hamilton.
Schafer talked William Timmons in
to serving as faculty adviser, a re- j
view board was established to okay
speakers, and a call was made to !
all students interested in speaking.
This was in January, 1935.
News of the bureau got around. ;
The story of a Stanford sophomore i
who had organized a group of
speakers to "sell" Stanford made j
news in metropolitan papers. By
May there were 20 speakers, aver- j
aging two engagements a day. Re
quests for everything from religious
talks to dancers came in to the |
bureau.
Paul D. McKelvey became faculty
adviser and helped the speakers im- i
prove their style and delivery. Ra
dio appearances became frequent, j
The bureau reached a high in 1936
when the ■ most popular speakers 1
were Bob Gros, who talked on "Will
Rogers, the Man"; Walt Wickett, j
whose subject was "The Eighteen
inch Eye"; and Bob Niccols, on
"When I Was a Cable Spinner."
Since leaving Stanford Niccols has
become a writer and an article by
him on cable-spinning appeared in a
recent Esquire.
AIDES CARRY ON
After leading the bureau for two
years, Chuck Schafer graduated,
leaving his brain-child in the arms
of Bob Maiden, one of the speak
ers. Most of the speakers graduated 1
with Schafer, and it was up to Maid- j
en to create new interest.
Last fall Bram Gorter took over |
management of the bureau and be
gan to rebuild it with additional
speakers and publicity sent to clubs J
and organizations. There are now
15 members of the group and sev
eral more will be added before the'
supplementary roster comes out!
next week. i

This year's speakers are John
Porter, who talks on "Federal
Housing"; Konrad Krauskopf, "Mil
lion-dollar Quakes"; Bob Maiden,
"Saga of the Leaping Leviathans";
Jack Anderson, "Man-made Sharks";
Enid Olivi, "The Italian Way of It";
Doug Bryan, "Prisons, Paroles, and
the Public"; Bob Livingston, "Mem
ory Mystery"; Norma Dales, "Dol
lars and Scents"; Ted and Dick
Lyon, "Around the World in Thirty
Minutes."
NEW SPEAKERS
The new orators who have been
added this quarter are Bob Stevens:,
"Co-operative Relief"; Mary Beaton,
"Workers School"; Jack Grover,
"The Hand Is' Quicker Than the
Eye"; John Robert Clarke, "A Story,
Please"; and Bob Efteland, "The
Brotherhood of Youth."
Five other students are preparing
talks now with the help of Mr. Mc-
Kelvey. The .speakers are Frank
Lineville, on "War Is Inevitable";
Hank McMicking, on "The Spanish
Revolution"; Brooke Von Faulken
stein, "I Worked on the Stock
Market"; Elizabeth Meyer, "Quack
ery Medicine"; and Jack Grover,
"Mental Telepathy."
TALKS CHECKED
All talks are passed on by the
review board, which consists of
Arvin Brown, Gerry Schreiber, Bob
Putnam, Mr. McKelvey, and Bram
Gorter. If the board thinks the
taik needs polishing, the speaker is
helped to overcome his faults, then
repeats his talk to the board.
But the activities of the bureau
are not confined to speaking alone.
The bureau led to romance for two
of this year's members, Norma Dales
and Bob Maiden having been mar
ried recently.

With the speaking schedule filling
up and the list of speakers grow
ing, the bureau looks ahead to a re
turn of the prosperous days of
Chuck Schafer. The idea of selling
Stanford has changed to giving
Stanford the reputation of produc
ing good speakers on any subject.
