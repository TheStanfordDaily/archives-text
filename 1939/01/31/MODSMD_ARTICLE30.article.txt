# Globe Trotter To Tell of Trip
## Captain Dwight Long To Speak Tomorrow 
### 
Captain Dwight Long, 25-year-old
adventurer and skipper of a 32-foot
boat in which he sailedâ€¢ 35,000 miles
around the world, will tell' of his
experiences tomorrow afternoon at
4:15 o'clock when he speaks in the
auditorium of Memorial Hall.
Arranged especially for the stu
dent body, the lecture is a special
presentation of the Committee on
Public Exercises, in charge of the
program. Captain Long will illus
trate his talk with motion pictures
and lantern slides taken on his
round-the-world cruise.
Pilot of the smallest craft to sail
to England via the Pacific Ocean and
the Mediterranean, the youthful
globe trotter four years ago decided
to forsake the comparative security
of classrooms at the University of
California to acquire a liberal edu
cation through visiting via sailboat
to the far corners of the world. Since
his return, he has set down his ex
periences in "Sailing All Seas in the
Idle Hour."
With a companion no older fhnri
himself, both virtually ignorant of
the rudiments of navigation, Captain
Long left his home in Seattle four
years ago on his trip around the
world. Sailing down the coast, the
two adventurers entered the Golden
Gate and made port in San Fran
cisco. After a short visit with
former President Hoover, who pre
sented the skipper with some fish
ing tackle, the 25-year-old captain
set sail for Honolulu on the first
leg of his round-the-world ad
venture.
Visiting the islands of liahiti, New
Zealand, Australia, Java, Ceylon,
Jerusalem, and the countries of the
Mediterranean, Captain Long last
year reached England, where he
lectured at theaters, colleges, and
universities.
