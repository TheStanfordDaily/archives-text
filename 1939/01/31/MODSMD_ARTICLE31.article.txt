The importance of the Pueblo In
dians is more and more recognized
by the federal government, accord
ing to Harry Horton, Stanford de
-1 bater, who made a study of the rela
tionships between the government
and the Indians during the recent
trip to New Mexico made by four
members of the debate team.
"The old policy concerning the
Indians in New Mexico was to as
similate them and try to forget
them," he said. "It has since been
recognized, particularly in relation
I to the fact that they own the lands
which drain into Boulder Dam. that
they must receive more considera
tion."
TREATY TERRITORY
The Indians live on treaty terri
i tory, he explained. This territory
| was given them by the Spaniards,
i and when the United States took the
Southwest the grants were renewed,
i The legal status of these grants is.
difficult, to determine. They are con
, sidered as contracts, but the federal
government has at various times
changed the provisions of the grants
without consulting the Indians, he
| pointed out.
"The status of an individual In
! dian or of a tribe is also unique,"
| he said. "The Indian is foally a
ward of the government, though the
1 government would far rather see
him living his own life independ
; ently. The tribe is the agency for
the federal government, eliminating
' states in the administering of Indian
j affaire."
Because of the poor value of the
grazing lands around the pueblos,
the government is attempting,
! through the Wheeler-Howard Act, to
j change the Indian from a stock farm
! er to an agriculturist, Horton said.

I The Indian is obtaining a more sure
tooted existence by the help and
advice in modern methods of agri
culture which is given him.
MINOR PROBLEMS
"The minor problems confronting
; the government in its relations with
the Indians include prohibition and
; crime, Hoi ton commented. "It is
1 illegal to sell liquor to an Indian,
j or to possess liquor on a reservation,
but the law is very hard to enforce."
He pointed out that the Indians
, revert to savagery when they are
; intoxicated, and this often leads to
crime. The Indian definition of
crime is very different from the
| white man's, and disputes arise from
| this clash of customs.
j "We do not understand their
; customs, and they do not understand
| ours," Horton said. "There is occa
, sional conflict between the two, and
j it is impossible for justice to be done,
I due to the difference in outlook.
| For the most, however, the relations
|of the Indians to white people are
| smooth and friendly," he concluded.
