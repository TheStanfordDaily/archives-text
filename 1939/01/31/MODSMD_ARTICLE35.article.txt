|Â£NEES knock and teeth chat
ter when you're slicking your
chin out in print. And it was no
exception when this column was
being ticked out lor yesterday,
stating that Pop Warner is home
sick and predicting he would re
sign his position as head football
coach at Temple.
Comforting relief was the news
appearing shortly thereafter, that
Warner had resigned and had
made a statement strongly imply
ing a desire to return to Stanford.
Warner is homesick, and he re
grets ever having left. lie is back
in Palo Alto for good; whether or
not he'll have his hand in the Card
grid stew will be decided on Feb
ruary 11. when the Board of Ath
letic Control will get together to
prepare Tiny Thornhill's new con
tract.

life appeared in the week
end hoop tilts. Reserves did so
well that it looked almost as though
Everett Dean would be able to get
together enough standouts to try the
unit system, making replacements
by teams instead of by men.
While the shortage is still too great
to take advantage of the benefits of
keeping a fresh team constantly on
the floor, fine performances turned
in by several non-regulars wei'e
comforting to Stanford rooters.
Don Williams showed just about
all that could be desired in a bas
ketball forward. His high scoring
was only secondary to his fine team
play that set up shots for everyone.
And (he quality mdst in his favor
right now is defensive ability that is
equaled only by regular varsity for
wards.
Dick Lyon corrected every habit
that kept him from 40-minute bail
in previous games. His passing was
consistently accurate, his defensive
stance was considerably more effec
tive, and his scoring eye was at its
best. This marked improvement,
added to his inherent aggressiveness
and team play, will cinch him a reg
ular guard spot for a large part of
the games to come.
Coaches smiled in unison at the
fine work of Wil Anderson, reserve
forward who has been starring in
B-contests and who played a re
markably steady game with the var
sity on Saturday night.
While it is enough to say that first
stringers, between rest periods, con
tinued at their usual pace, Don
Burness' value as a scoring center
can hardly be overemphasized. "I
found a new spot," he smiled, as he
lugged a heavy knee cast down the
floor after a series of buckets from
the corner of the court.

DOW DEN. rod-faced Cali
fornia swimming coach, thinks
he has what it takes for a con
ference championship this year,
but he is not forgetting (hat Stan
ford and Southern California are
still in the league.
No doubt he'll study carefully
the results of Stanford's interclass
swimming meet as they appeared
in yesterday's Daily. He'll use
them to advantage when he pre
pares for competition with Stan
ford next April.
Cal had its own interclass meet
over a week ago. hut Stanford's
Nort Thornton has not seen the re
sults. For some unexplainable
reason, the issue of the Daily Cali
fornian in which those results
we re printed, has never been sent
for Stanford files either at The
Daily olTice or at the B.A.C. Dow
den has been known to do some
strange things, but surely he is not
so worried about Stanford as to
have withheld the only issue of
the Berkeley paper that would do
Stanford swimmers any good.
lIOW would you like to carry 14
units along with the duties lh.it

! fall on Beeb Lee? You'd think the
many conferences and meetings he
must attend as student body presi
| dent would be enough to keep him
i up three nights out of the week; but
I on the side, he has turned out a
i freshman basketball team whose
j fine organization would seem to re
quire unlimited attention of the
I head coach.
His fingers have been drawn into
many stews, and nearly everyone
calls him "Beebs." The name is
i still "Beeb," without the plural, and
I it dates back to authority and cir
| cumstances that cannot properly be
quoted or explained here.
