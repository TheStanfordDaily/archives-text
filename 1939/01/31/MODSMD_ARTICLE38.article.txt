## Bruin Cagers Set for Tilt With Cardinals U.C.L.A. Hoopmen Hope for Victory Over Indian Squad 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor 
There's trouble a-Bruin' for the
Indian hoopsters this week-end.
U.C.L.A.'s cagers, perennial cel
j lar occupants of the Southern Divi
sion who usually can be counted
; upon to take a "'dive" in at least
three of each four games with the
other conference teams, are acting
up and are actually trying to get
out of the hole.
J They have their eyes on third
| place. Stanford in turn has its eye
| on Cal and U.S.C. in first and sec
j ond place. Cal is on the lookout for
j all the rest oi its opponents, while
the Trojans don't care just so they
! get on top of the heap where they
1 think they belong.
lIIGII CLIMBING
To get back to the impending
j Stanford-U.S.C. double engagement
here Friday and Saturday nights,
the Bruins are after third place,
while the Indians can't afford to
( lose either game if they're to catch
| the Trojans.
! That the Bruin can brew up somp
difficulty for Coach Everett Dean's
j anxious Indians and overtake them
is not an impossibility, according to
chief scouts who have mapped out
I U.C.L.A.'s offensive and defensive
1 campaign for Stanford to work on
! between now and Friday.
CARDS READY
While his opponents are gathering
! steam, Coach Dean has his men on
I their toes, knowing what is in the
offing for them if they don't hustle.
A comparatively light workout
| was yesterday's order of practice,
; with the major half of the varsity
| polishing and taking on new of
, fensive assignments, while others
drilled in Bruin plays and will test
j out the varsity this afternoon and
tomorrow. Guarding assignments
j v/ill be made at the same time for
! Ace Calkins, Crossan Hays and
Weldie, the three high-scoring
\ Uclans.
