# MONTREAL ICE WIN
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Jon. 30 (UP). â€”The
j Montreal Canadians made a move
toward climbing out of the National
Hockey League cellar last night
; when they nosed out the Chicago
; Blackhawks, 1-0, before a crowd of
j 12,500 at the stadium. The two points
I gained in league standings left Mont
! real only a game and a half behind
the Hawks.
