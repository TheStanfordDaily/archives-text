Recent rains have thrown many kinks into a tight-packed varsity dia
mond schedule, and will undoubtedly result in slightly sore throwing
arms when the horschide jugglers, both varsity and frosh, begin practice
some time this week.
I lie promised varsity pitch battle with the Pacific Greyhound nine
got the no go sign last Saturday because of too wet grounds. Frosh

nuriers also took a week-end rest 4
when a soggy infield made play j
against the San Francisco Commo
dores next to impossible.
Swing and swear fans need not j
turn out for tomorrow's proposed
game with San Jose State, since last
night's grumblings from the coaches' !
dressing room ran definitely to the
effect that only the worms and
water would trot the bases tomor
row.
Batteries made the best of yes
terday, however, by taking short t
workouts in the new pitching shack I
that was built this year just behind I
the varsity field for just such wet
emergencies. Noticeably absent
were frosh hurlers and backstop
men who were also expected to use
the shack to keep their arms in top
notch condition.
Weather and grounds permitting,
the varsity diamond men will swing
it out with the strong Athens Ath
letic Club tomorrow.
