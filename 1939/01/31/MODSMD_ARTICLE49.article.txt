THROUGHOUT the last few months, Chapar
ral has repeatedly dropped down to the
Shack with the offer to revive the ancient Chap
pie-Daily feud. Why, God only knows, unless
they hope to uncover handy editorial material
without searching for it.
Chappie has been rather hurt that The Daily
has ignored its efforts. The boys are very ear
nest about their work. At any rate, all should
be well now that columns and Campus Opin
ions have devoted themselves extensively to
Chaparral.
So far, the feud is little more than a battle of
verbal vituperation. This reflects nfot so much
on the writers as on the subject. There simply
is little worth saying about Chappie. As it gal
lops along full tilt in mediocrity, it reflects fixed
editorial and staff capacities, both well-nigh
impregnable to the assaults of criticism. Carp
ing does no more good than wild-eyed letters
by Chappie in defense of Chappie.
But on one ground might criticism from The
Daily be justified, now that you mention it.
The staff here is tired of having to provide
Stanford with its only humor publication. (But
The Daily does a pretty fair job considering
that it is not meant at all to be funny.)
Yet in the face of Chappie sell-outs and a
sinking fund large enough to cast speculative
eyes at a new Publications building, criticism
becomes unfounded.
Or at least it shows a lack of patience. It
is a well-known axiom that the success of
every campus publication rests almost com
pletely with the staff rather than with any in
trinsic quality.
So though Chappie is an ill wind now, it may
blow good next year.
