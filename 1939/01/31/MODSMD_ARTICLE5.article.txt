# Chinese Mind Plods, Says Chapin in Talk
## 
### 
A firm belief in reasonableness, rather than faith in methods of reason
ing, according to Professor Leland Chapin, who spoke in the auditorium
of the Education building last night, is one of the typical traits of the
Chinese mind.
Dr. Chapin, who spent three years on the faculty of Lingnan Univer-

sity in Canton, made a thorough"
study of Japanese and Russian
propaganda methods, and noted
the comparative futility of these
foreign agencies to effectively im
press the native population.
"In understanding or getting at
the foundation of arguments and
principles," said Dr. Chapin, "the
Oriental mind relies almost totally
on intuition rather than on the
complexities of the scientific meth
od."
"With this background of con
servative philosophy," continued the
professor, "it is not hard to explain
the difficulty of communist propa
gandists and Japanese extremists, to
materially alter the native attitude
toward their local government and
economy."
The professor pointed out that
these "methods of high pressure
salesmanship, filled with complex
generalities," were too pseudo-sci
entific to impress the Chinese.
