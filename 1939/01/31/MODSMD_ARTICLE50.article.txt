YESTERDAY Women's Conference, officiat
ing over the shoulders of their member who
wrote the Daily story announcing today the
reinauguration of the Conference nominating
committee, suggested editorial comment on the
system.
Evidently, the idea was that such an im
portant move should not pass unnoticed.
Whether Conference wished to be backed up
in what was undoubtedly a minor tussle to
put the committee back to work, or whether
it wished adverse criticism on which to base
counter-arguments, only Conference knows.
But basically it is just a heads-tails proposi
tion, with no one bothering to flip. The com
mittee may give itself an official title only to
do secretarial work in searching out candidates'
bawl-out averages; or it may actually widen
opportunities for heretofore backward- leaders,
delineate exact duties for those prospective
candidates who do show up. That will be fine.
But it makes little difference actually. Ap
proximately the same people will run whether
Conference's committee functions or not. The
caliber of women leaders will remain the same.
Women's voting will be appreciably no more
sensible than it has been in the past, nor no
less.
At worst, the committee is doing work which,
when done, accomplishes little. At best, it is
a mechanism whereby more political theory can
be put in practice. Of course, no one yet has
safely determined whether that theory is demo
cratic or autocratic, but the consideration of its
theoretical basis can be laid aside for the
moment.
Practically, the committee is neither good
nor bad.
And anyhow, who is going to argue with a
council room of determined women.
