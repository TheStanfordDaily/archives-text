# Double Strike-Out
## 
### 
THE two men whose pictures appear today
on page one walked out of the Shack last
night, not to appear until voting time this
afternoon. I said "Good luck" to both of them.
And meant it.
There wasn't much else to say. There still
isn't. Not that the idea isn't concrete enough.
Pre-election editorials have been written on
election Tuesday for a good many years now,
and The Daily keeps very complete reference
files for me.
But it is a little difficult to write a nice jovial
message to A. S. D. and H. L. S. when I know
that this afternoon one of them will try
to wash away disappointment with the thought
that the Daily work he has already had is an
end in itself.

Of course it is, when you get down to it.
But the injustice of a system which rewards
only one of two outstanding men on the Daily
staff and shuts the door on the other is a little
hard to swallow at first. But systems are sys
tems; this is the best yet to be devised; it is far
worse than I or anyone else could wish. But
it is the system.
Sure I am however that next volume's editor
will be big enough for his office. I have worked
too long with both men, compared them too
favorably with past editors, not to know that in
either one The Daily—and Stanford—will have
an able leader.
So there's really not much to say. I hated to
see my two associates walk out the door last
night. It means an end of the line for one of
them. (Or perhaps I am just projecting my own
feelings; their exit and mine nearly coincide.)
Next week, one of those men will be ham
mering out his first editorial on this machine.
The other and I will look back.
