# BULL SESSION
## IVORY TOWER NOT FOR SALE 
### JOHN COBBS 
/ of my friends wandered into the cellar the
- ther day, carrying with him the weight of the
world's misery which he packs around conscientiously.
He found me prowling carelessly through the maga
zine counter and bore down on me like a dog-catcher
sighting an unlicensed poodle. I greeted him warily
and braced myself for a lecture on the sin of super
ficiality. It came.
"Your world," he said, "Is artificial."
I have never set my world up on an accept-no
substitutes basis, but it has always seemed reasonably
real. In fact, there have been times toward the end
of the quarter when my bank balance ran low and my
world seemed annoyingly real. I said so.
* * * >»<
"You are just like the rest of Stanford," he com
plained. You sit here while people starve, and all
you do is read magazines. You live in an escape
world. This whole University is nothing but an over
grown padded cell."
There was more in the same vein, and then my
friend shouldered his misery and went off to worry
about the plight of somebody or other.
>1* *
Perhaps my friend is right. At any rate, he doesn't
have to sing solo. One of the more popular sports
around the campus is damning Stanford students for
hiding their heads in the intellectual sand. The Farm,
we are told, is an ivory tower; undergraduates are
pathological princesses, afraid to look outside.
But if we arc sheltered little children, wo manage
to be very happy about it. And there, I think, is the
real cause of the howling of the "socially conscious"
prophets.

The average Stanford student is well adjusted and
content. He likes the school and the people and the
checks he gets from home. There is no reason why
he should spoil the little sleep he gets by worrying
too much about the plight of the world.
It is not sympathy that makes undergraduates sor
row for downtrodden minorities. It is psychological
compensation. Only the unhappy and/or unsuccessful
students can get suffiicently wrought up about the
problems of the world to qualify as really socially
conscious.
The ordinary student has plenty to keep him busy.
The little time that the professors leave him has to
be divided among the highway, activities, and the
women's living groups. He is here to get a liberal edu
cation and to develop well rounded character, not to
make a soap-box orator out of himself.

We don't customarily cry ourselves to sleep, but
that doesn't mean that we are apathetic or unsympa
thetic. It means simply that we are sensible enough
not to make ourselves miserable over something we
can't help.
We see enough of the world to get an idea of what
it is like. We don't think much of a lot. that we see,
and so we decide to enjoy things while we can, hop
ing that when we have to sneak out from behind
alma mater's skirts some of the things we have learned
will help us.
College students aren't supposed to be responsible
for the problems of the world. Life insurance statis
tics indicate that they they will have quite a while
later on to do their worrying.
