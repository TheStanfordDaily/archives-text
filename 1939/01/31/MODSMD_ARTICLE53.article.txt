CALL ME CHIEF
One of the boys, walking down the Quad this morn
ing, saw a friend of his named Ray some distance
down the Quad from him.
"Hey, Ray," he yelled.
And immediately became conscious of a tall man
in a tall stiff collar between him and his friend.
The tall man in the tall collar turned and gave
him a severe, presidential stare.

TRAGEDY
In order to get a date for an Event which was
coming off last Sunday, one of the boys called up a
gal quite late one night several weeks ago and asked
her to go with him.
He called up so late, in fact, that the young lady
had to be yanked from sleep and pulled out of bed
to answer the phone.
She heard the guy say something about a date.
She felt he was talking for a long time. She was quite
sure he was asking her for a date. "Yes, I'd love to,"
she said, and went back to bed. She was asleep in a
matter of seconds.
So Sunday the guy got all dressed and called the
gal for the first time since the initial plunge.
And found out that not only did she have a date
for Sunday night with someone else, but she never
remembered his calling.
Many girls tell the boys that.
But most of them don't have such a pretty alibi.
"I guess I was still asleep."

The lobby of Lagunita was littered Friday night
by a bunch of the boys dressed prettily in tuxes wait
ing to pick up their gals and take them to the Toyon
formal.
Stretched around the lobby they looked like so
many starched shirts. Some probably looked like
bigger starched shirts than others, but there was little
difference in them.
At one point one of the wals came bouncing into
the room. She stopped short and looked around from
starched shirt to starched shirt.
"Well."' she said, "which one is mine?"
