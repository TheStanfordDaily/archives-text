### 
"Chapayev, the Red Commander,"
Soviet Russia's film epic, will be
featured as this coming Sunday eve
ning's motion picture in Memorial
Hall at 7:15 o'clock.
Adapted from a narrative based
on the life and revolutionary activi
ties of one of the Soviet's best loved
heroes, the producers of "Chapayev"
have filmed events as they actually
happened in authentic locales.
Chapayev, a low-born carpenter
who fought during the world war
as a common soldier, became a self
styled leader of peasants and work
ers following the revolution of 1917.
The shrewd, illiterate fighter at
tracts many volunteers and wins
victory after victory on the eastern
front.
After Chapayev achieves official
recognition from Moscow for his
conquests, however, headquarters
sends a Commissar Furmanov to ad
vise him in military tactics and dis
cipline. The bold, swaggering peas
ant, happy with his own lighting
methods, resent interference.
English subtitles have been ef

fectively super-imposed on the film |
and mass choruses singing Russian i
folk songs have been dubbed in I
throughout the production.
