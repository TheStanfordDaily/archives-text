## Franco deemed heartless 
### 
: The Editor, Sir:
Apropos of "History, 1939," Jan
j uary 2G, I hope Larry Livingston
was speaking in an ironic vein when
i he credited Franco with a heart be
! cause he did not wipe out the en
i tire city of Barcelona.
It is quite probable that the kind
j hearted "savior" of Spain was anx
, ious to conserve Barcelona as a
I rebel base, but a man who has per
j mitted Italian invaders to slaughter
thousands of civilians in air-raids
j without military purpose can scarce
ly be considered a great humani-
I tarian.
Sincerely,
