# 'Lake Will Fill,' Says McDonnell

With the; now, bonthou.se standing
nearly completed on the rim of
Lake Lagunita, attention turned this
week to whether or not "the gods
of rain" would give the Farm
enough water to use its $10,000 in
vestment.
James W. McDonnell, superin
tendent of buildings and grounds,
said yesterday that tardy rains
should give Stanfordites little cause
to worry. "Though the lake is usu
ally full by the first of February,
I've soon it fill up lots later than
that," he said. "It takes a couple of
weeks for the overflow from Sears
ville to come down the narrow
ditch from San Francisquito
Creek."'
Queried as io whether, in case of
insufficient rainfall, additional water
might be diverted from Searsville
Lake for Lagunita, Mr. McDonnell
disclosed that such procedure
would be impossible, since Sears
ville Lake provides just enough
water for the University's use.
