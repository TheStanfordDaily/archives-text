### LARRY LIVINCSTON 
A T LAST in the murky fog of |
conflicting views and sentiments
that hovers over Washington, we
see the faint glimmer of a light. We
begin to find out more than what j
President Roosevelt says concern
ing the Democracy-Fascism bout;
we discover some of the things he
is actually doing about it behind
the scenes.
At a meeting with the Senate Mil
it iry Affairs Committee yesterday,
the President revealed that he has
already taken steps in favor of
France and stands ready to act fur- |
tiler in the cause of the democratic
powers of Europe against Benito,
Francisco, and Adolf. Sounding a
pessimistic note on the inevitability
of war, Roosevelt plainly expressed
his intention of keeping the United
States on the side of England and
Flo" "n in any conflict that may de
velop.
# * *
r pilE whole thing started when
France placed with the United
States a colossal order for (100 of
the latest type fighting planes.
Pacifists held up their hands in
horror and started ranting about
American merchants of death;
War Department officials griped
that their best secret military ma
chines were going to fight a war
in Europe instead of protecting
the United States.
However, President Roosevelt:
had an idea or two of his own on
the situation. Feeling that it is this
country's duty to protect democracy
against the oF debbil Fascism, the
number-one New Dealer made ar
rangements with the War and
Treasury Departments to sell
France GOO of the Super-super planes
that the United States usually re
serves for its exclusive use. Any
way, that's the way the inside story
goes.
# * *
IN HIS conference with members
of the Military AfTairs Committee,
who were pledged to secrecy, the
President dismissed the plane pur
chase affair as a mere bagatelle, and
put all his emphasis on the import
ance of breaking the power of the
Rome-Berlin-Tokio axis.
Despite Hitler's comparatively
peaceful speech yesterday and the
present breathing space between
war-scares, Roosevelt seems de
termined to have England and
France ready for any trick the
dictators may decide to pull out
of the hat. The President of the
United States has started to act,
and when he acts—well, ask any
Republican.
"YESTERDAY Mr. Chamberlain
decided to call Adolf Hitlei''s
bluff. In his speech to the opening
session of the House of Commons,
answering the Reichstag dissertation,
the British Prime Minister called
upon der Fuehrer to back up his
declaration of a desire for peace by
concrete action: "Adolf, reduce
your armaments."
The first reply we can think of as
coming from the Reich's dictator is
the Nazi equivalent of "Go chase
yourself." However, this is not the
answer that Hitler will give, be
cause Chamberlain made proposals
yesterday which may definitely be
interpreted as offers to restore
some of her lost African colonies to
Germany if she will cut down on
armaments.
Jj» >Ji
r I' , IIUS England returns to the
path of appeasement; true it is
that it leads in a slightly differ
ent direction this time, hut is the
same old policy that Chamberlain
used from the time of the Munich
crisis until his unsuccessful visit
to Rome early this year.
The House of Commons express
ed strong support for the slightly
battered program yesterday when
it. gave the Prime Minister a strong
vote of confidence on his stand for
non-intervention in the Spanish
Civil War.

ing the Democracy-Fascism bout;
we discover some of the things he
is actually doing about it behind
the scenes.
At a meeting with the Senate Mil
it iry Affairs Committee yesterday,
the President revealed that he has
already taken steps in favor of
France and stands ready to act fur- |
tiler in the cause of the democratic
powers of Europe against Benito,
Francisco, and Adolf. Sounding a
pessimistic note on the inevitability
of war, Roosevelt plainly expressed
his intention of keeping the United
States on the side of England and
Flo" "n in any conflict that may de
velop.

r pilE whole thing started when
France placed with the United
States a colossal order for (100 of
the latest type fighting planes.
Pacifists held up their hands in
horror and started ranting about
American merchants of death;
War Department officials griped
that their best secret military ma
chines were going to fight a war
in Europe instead of protecting
the United States.
However, President Roosevelt:
had an idea or two of his own on
the situation. Feeling that it is this
country's duty to protect democracy
against the oF debbil Fascism, the
number-one New Dealer made ar
rangements with the War and
Treasury Departments to sell
France GOO of the Super-super planes
that the United States usually re
serves for its exclusive use. Any
way, that's the way the inside story
goes.

IN HIS conference with members
of the Military AfTairs Committee,
who were pledged to secrecy, the
President dismissed the plane pur
chase affair as a mere bagatelle, and
put all his emphasis on the import
ance of breaking the power of the
Rome-Berlin-Tokio axis.
Despite Hitler's comparatively
peaceful speech yesterday and the
present breathing space between
war-scares, Roosevelt seems de
termined to have England and
France ready for any trick the
dictators may decide to pull out
of the hat. The President of the
United States has started to act,
and when he acts—well, ask any
Republican.
"YESTERDAY Mr. Chamberlain
decided to call Adolf Hitlei''s
bluff. In his speech to the opening
session of the House of Commons,
answering the Reichstag dissertation,
the British Prime Minister called
upon der Fuehrer to back up his
declaration of a desire for peace by
concrete action: "Adolf, reduce
your armaments."
The first reply we can think of as
coming from the Reich's dictator is
the Nazi equivalent of "Go chase
yourself." However, this is not the
answer that Hitler will give, be
cause Chamberlain made proposals
yesterday which may definitely be
interpreted as offers to restore
some of her lost African colonies to
Germany if she will cut down on
armaments.
