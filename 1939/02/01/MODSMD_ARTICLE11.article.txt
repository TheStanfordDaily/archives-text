# Music Termed 'Social Force'
## Conductor Explains Importance of Song 
### 
That music could bring about "a
better understanding among the
people of the world" and could ex
ercise important influence in achiev
ing international peace and good
will is the opinion of Walter Bates,
well-known Canadian conductor,
singer, and musician, who spoke on
"Music: A World Force" last night
in Memorial Hall auditorium in a
program of the Tuesday Evening
Series.
"A powerful social force, music is
much deeper and broader than most
of us realize," declared the speaker.
"It could be a rule for living, for
the principles of harmony and coun
terpoint could provide the basis for
harmonious human relations. If we
all had more music in us, wars would
soon cease, for music makes us cu
rious about other peoples, and you
can't fight a person whom you es
teem."
Explaining the sociological as
pects of music, Mr. Bates asserted
that it is "more than merely an art.
Music can serve as a great moral
and leavening influence," which
could aflect the relations between
foreign nations.
"We are developing in America
today a definite musical aristocracy
and musical peasantry," warned the
conductor, who decried "the tre
mendous devotion to swing music"
in this country. "I have no quarrel
I with swing music, but we can get
|to much of any good tiling. With
I this present craze for swing, we arc
: turning for our music to the older
aboriginal types of music."
Mr. Bat es emphasized that music
j can exert a powerful sociological
force, and could serve as a medium
I to bring the people of the world into
• a better understanding, as well as
! being a big factor in clTccting inter
! national pcace.
"If the United States and Canada
] are to take our place in the lead, we
! must look to the finer, Ihe bigger
; things in life. Let us, the people of
North Amcricn, who live in the
I freest, finest, and grandest country
j in the world, sing the music that is
I fine and eood, and that will Rive vis
j a feeling of hope. In this way, we
lean help to Ret this world ruled in
a better way than the manner in
j which it is now being ruled," the
ispeaker concluded.

That music could bring about "a
better understanding among the
people of the world" and could ex
ercise important influence in achiev
ing international peace and good
will is the opinion of Walter Bates,
well-known Canadian conductor,
singer, and musician, who spoke on
"Music: A World Force" last night
in Memorial Hall auditorium in a
program of the Tuesday Evening
Series.
"A powerful social force, music is
much deeper and broader than most
of us realize," declared the speaker.
"It could be a rule for living, for
the principles of harmony and coun
terpoint could provide the basis for
harmonious human relations. If we
all had more music in us, wars would
soon cease, for music makes us cu
rious about other peoples, and you
can't fight a person whom you es
teem."
Explaining the sociological as
pects of music, Mr. Bates asserted
that it is "more than merely an art.
Music can serve as a great moral
and leavening influence," which
could aflect the relations between
foreign nations.
"We are developing in America
today a definite musical aristocracy
and musical peasantry," warned the
conductor, who decried "the tre
mendous devotion to swing music"
in this country. "I have no quarrel
I with swing music, but we can get
|to much of any good tiling. With
I this present craze for swing, we arc
: turning for our music to the older
aboriginal types of music."
Mr. Bat es emphasized that music
j can exert a powerful sociological
force, and could serve as a medium
I to bring the people of the world into
• a better understanding, as well as
! being a big factor in clTccting inter
! national pcace.
"If the United States and Canada
] are to take our place in the lead, we
! must look to the finer, Ihe bigger
; things in life. Let us, the people of
