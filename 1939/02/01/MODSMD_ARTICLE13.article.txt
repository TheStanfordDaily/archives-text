# Excom Plans Circle 's' Award Probe
## Committee Delays Recognition of Skiing As Minor Sport 
### 
Plunging into a pool of suspected
vagaries in the Stanford minor
sports situation, Ex Committee last
night provided for complete inves
tigation of the present set-up by a
special committee.
After John Dern had suggested
there may be a lot of useless minor
sports that should be weeded out,
President H. B. Lee appointed an
investigating body consisting of
Bob Mangan, chairman, Andy Stoj
kovich, and Ddrn.
Without, waiting for results of the
investigation, however, Ex Commit
tee took the following actions:
1. Recognized Rifle and Pistol
Club provisionally as a minor sport,
a system of Circle S awards to be
worked out later.
2. Delayed minor sport recogni
tion action on skiing until Coach I
Harry Maloney can appear before
the committee.
3. Granted a second Block S for
horse polo which was due under
the present set-up, recommending,
however, thai this sport be investi
gated by the committee of three.
RIFLE LOBBYIST
Action on the Rifle and Pistol
Club was taken after Bud Cameron
had pointed out that the activity
was recognized as a minor sport
from 1932 to 1935, and that recogni
tion now would bring the sport
back to its former popularity.
Lobbying for Ski Club minor
sport recognition were Bill Janss,
Bill Rosenfeld, and Lloyd Davis. In
his third annual campaign for the
award, Janss presented letters from
the Universities of Oregon, Wash
ington, and California telling of
skiing's success there as a minor
sport.
He pointed out that the club is a
strong organization, that skiing has
proved itself more than a passing
fad, that skiing is one of the few
sports that can be continued in later
life.
PARTRIDGE OBJECTS
Objections by John Partridge in
cluded contentions that (1) skiing
costs so much that everyone can't
afford to go out for the team, (2)
some skiers might cut Friday classes
consistently to go skiing, and (3)
Ex Committee should wait for a re
port from its subcommittee inves
tigating minor sports.
Dern mentioned golf, rifle and
pistol, horse polo, and cross-country
as sports in which a change of award
methods should be considered.
Other Ex Committee business in
cluded the following:
OUTSIDERS: In the midst of a
survey of non-students taking pari
in student activities, Harry Horton
complained of difficulty in reaching
"certain elusive groups."
He said a report will be made
when he has extended his survey to
the Band, Political Union, Chinese
| Club, Japanese Club, Flying Club,
I and American Student Union.
THIN FLOOR: Because dancers
j in the Pavilion track in gravel on
I rainy nights, the floor often must I
I be sanded down and refinished .pnd
i it is beginning to get thin, Student
Manager Tom Killefer told the
committee.
He was empowered to take action

Prom last year.
