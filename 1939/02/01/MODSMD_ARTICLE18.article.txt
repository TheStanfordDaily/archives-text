# Encinamen to Get Breakage Funds
## 
### 
The balance of the breakage fund
for the fall quarter, amounting to
approximately $7, will be refunded
to all Encina freshmen, according to
an announcement made yesterday
by the accounting department.
Those freshmen who entered the
hall in the winter quarter will be
refunded the entire $10, and upper
classmen living in the hall will re
ceive a proportionate refund for the
fall quarter and a full refund for the
winter quarter. The refunds will be
made in the Encina Hall office be
ginning at 11 o'clock today.
This move has been made upon
the recommendation of the Encina
Council with the understanding that
residents of the hall will assume in
dividual financial responsibility for
damage to equipment of individual
rooms, and that the group will be
financially responsible for damage
to the hall which can not. be spe
cifically allocated.
It is hoped that by this arrange
ment the Encina men will realize
that, it is possible to get some of
their breakage deposit back and will
therefore treat the hall more gently.
