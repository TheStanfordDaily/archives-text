# Stale Licenses May Go Cardinal
## 
### 
Stanford will celebrate its
fiftieth anniversary in 1941.
What, would be more fitting
than to have the state license
plates in cardinal and white to
commemorate this event and,
according to Mr. Howard E.
Deems, state registrar of ve
hicles, there is a good possi
bility of this coming true.
In a recent letter to Tom
Polhcmus, '42, Mr. Deems stat
ed that "Our committee for the
selection of colors, under a pol
icy adopted last year, has made
the selections entirely on the
basis of visibility, legibility and
durability of paint and enam
els, and I as a Stanford grad
will champion the cause of the
cardinal and white plates."
As this year's plates almost
duplicate Cal's colors. Mr.
Deems probably feels as do all
other Stanford grads and stu
dents-it's the Farm's turn in
1941.
