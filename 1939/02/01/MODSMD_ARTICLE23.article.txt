# Excom Action Will Curtail Nickelodian
## 'Damn Music-box' Will Be Silenced During Meal Periods 
### 
Complaints of too much noise at

night to order the record-player in
the Union Cellar silenced during
lunch and dinner.
Quiet periods will be from 11:30
to 1 o'clock and from 5:30 to 7 o'clock.
Citing numerous complaints that j
have filled the Cellar suggestion box !
since installation of the "Sympho- I
nola," Roy Thompson, student mem- j
her of the Union Board of Gover- I
nors, brought the matter to Ex Com- 1
mittee's attention.
Among the '"suggestions" were the
following:
"Why break the peace with that
damn gaudy noise-box?"
"Can't it be cut off or turned down
so low that only those next to it can
hear?"
"Suggestion for increasing profits \
of phonograph: Install an unre- |
corded disk for those who want to j
buy three minutes of peace."
A hasher reported that one song '
had been played 13 times in one j
hour. There was some disagreement
as to the record was No. 7, "You're a
Sweet Little Headache," or No. 10, j
"Hold Tight."
Another complaint, occording to |
President H. B. Lee, is (hat pprsons
come into the Cellar for lunch only,
to find all the stools taken by coke- i
drinkers listening to the nickelo- !
deon.
Motion that the music box be !
curtailed during mealtimes was made j
by Gretchen Ah.slwede, after "the;
committee had considered everything
irom taking it out completely to put
ting a damper on the volume.
The quiet hours decided upon will j
be in effect for a trial week. Coline
Upshaw was asked to prepare a j
warning notice to be posted when the !
machine is disconnected.
Besides limiting playing time of
the nickelodeon, Ex Committee voted j
that all proceeds go toward the new
Boathouse.
