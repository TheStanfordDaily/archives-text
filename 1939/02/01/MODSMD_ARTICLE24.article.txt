# Ski Reservation Quota Overflows
## 
### 
Students who have signed
up to attend the junior class
ski week-end at Yosemite next
Saturday and Sunday and who
will be unable to go are re
quested to cancel their reser
vations at the A.S.S.U. office,
according to Bill Janss, chair
man for the event.
The quota of 150 available
reservations has already been
filled, and 25 anxious skiers
have signed the waiting list.
Therefore students who are not
going to Yosemite are urged to
cancel their reservations in
order that those 25 hopefuls
may be accommodated, if pos
sible.
Feature of the week-end will
be the Yosemite Winter Club
invitational meet in which
Stanford Skiers Bill Janss,
Lloyd Davis, Bill Rosenfeld,
and A1 Zuckerman will par
ticipate. Juniors will travel to
Yosemite in private cars and
assemble for skiing and social
activities at Badger Pass and
in the valley.
