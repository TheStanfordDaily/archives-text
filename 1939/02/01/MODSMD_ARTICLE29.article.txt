# Roble Sets Date For Dinner Dance
## 
### 
Roble Hall's annual winter quar
ter dance will be a semi-formal
dinner dance to be held February
11, according to an announcement

made by Jane Pendergast, chairman'
of the dance committee. The affair
will have a nautical theme.
Music will be provided by Rodger
Burke, who recently completed an
engagement at the Sir Francis Drake
and played for the Encina Formal
last week.
Bids are $1.50 and will go on sale
Thursday afternoon. Because of the I

limited space in the dining rooms,
the number of tickets have been
limited to 165. Dinner will be serv
ed at 6:45 o'clock and there will be
dancing until 12 o'clock.

The Virgin Islands, owned partly
by the United States and partly by
Great Britain, are about 100 in num
ber, most of them uninhabited.
