### JOHN SHALLENERCER ARCH JENKINS 
CArch Jenkins, who yesterday
was appointed sports editor for
Volume 95 of The Daily, tries his
hand with page .5 today. Jenkius
has, come up through the ranks of
the sports staff and has had hjs
rec vnt grooming as assistant .-ports
editor and as varsity football cor
respondent. He goes in to warm
up with Sideline Slauis and
will take over permanently when
(lie new volume begins next Mon
day.-*—Sports Editor)

TEAKS still come to my eyes ev
ery t.ime 1 think of the way the
Stanford baseball team booted it
self into the lesser rungs of the con
ference ladder last spring. When
the season started, it looked like an
Indian year. Then Captain George
Farrell, a great third baseman for
two years, injured himself sliding
on hard ground; Dick Shortall, the
promising short-stop, was out of ac
tion temporarily; and the rest of
the squad got stage-fright trying to
keep i\p with the semi-pros from St.
Mary's, Southern California, and
California.
* * ijt
THERE just wasn't anything there
with the exception of about four
fine men. And it still takes nine
good ball players to win games in
a conference as tough as the south
ern division. Not. a man on the
squad could hit a curve ball. If they
had given every man a sweater who
hit for two bases, the B.A.C.'s knit
ting bill wouldn't even worry a
Scotchman. The kids would field
downright well for five or six inn- i
ings and then, phlooey —it was aj
comedy of errors from there on in. i
The maddest I ever got was in one j
ol the games at Berkeley when I
Sammy Chapman, one of the best of j
the Bear semi-pros, laughed at the!
whole thing.
lil'T this year Harry Wolter has'
been presented with a sophomore;
aggregation as strong as any he has '
had in years. Three of these ex- ;
frosh are current first-string in- '
fielders, another has produced in |
every game to date, and three more '
are promising pitchers. Wolters has !
a whole stew of really good out
fielders and two catchers to spell ]
Bill Jamieson, the only receiver I
with any natural ability a year ago. j
* *
THE only trouble again is the i
youth and comparative inexperience !
of the striplings whom Wolters has i
gathered together. Finding a man [
over 20 years of age on the outfit is j
as tough as getting a parking space
in back of the library. Those three
soph infielders haven't even chang
ed their voices yet.
HUT the days of the short-legged
outfielders and stranded base-run -
ners might be just about over. Per
haps the great metamorphosis took
place in the waning innings of a
game with Baddini's All-Stars
(some more semi-pros) late last
week. Something like a dozen In
dians must have been plucked off
between third and home. In short. I
it looked like that awful moniker, j
"the worst collegiate ball club in j
America," might stick after all.
THEN came the dawn. Two of |
Wolters' kids just about knocked i
down the centerfield fence, a worthy j
accomplishment to say the least.,
Stanford must have gotten more i
runs in two innings that day than'
they made all last year combined.
THE whole idea is that Indian
baseball is suffering a revival that
may last. Once the team shows it
can hit consistently, bunt, and run
bases without getting muscle
cramps, maybe we can all go over
to Berkeley and laugh at the ghost [
of Sammy Chapman, a good football
player.

lil'T this year Harry Wolter has'
been presented with a sophomore;
aggregation as strong as any he has '

with any natural ability a year ago. j

THE only trouble again is the i
youth and comparative inexperience !
of the striplings whom Wolters has i

HUT the days of the short-legged
outfielders and stranded base-run -

place in the waning innings of a
game with Baddini's All-Stars
(some more semi-pros) late last
week. Something like a dozen In
dians must have been plucked off
between third and home. In short. I
it looked like that awful moniker, j
"the worst collegiate ball club in j
America," might stick after all.
THEN came the dawn. Two of |
Wolters' kids just about knocked i
down the centerfield fence, a worthy j
accomplishment to say the least.,
Stanford must have gotten more i
runs in two innings that day than'
they made all last year combined.
THE whole idea is that Indian
baseball is suffering a revival that
may last. Once the team shows it
can hit consistently, bunt, and run
bases without getting muscle
cramps, maybe we can all go over
to Berkeley and laugh at the ghost [
of Sammy Chapman, a good football

two years, injured himself sliding
on hard ground; Dick Shortall, the
promising short-stop, was out of ac

THERE just wasn't anything there
with the exception of about four

had given every man a sweater who
hit for two bases, the B.A.C.'s knit
