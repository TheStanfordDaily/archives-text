## Cagers Win Over 'Bruin' In Practice Unpredictable Bruins May Surprise Cards In Week-end Series 
### JOHN SHALLENBERGER, Sports Editor 
There would be nothing to this
' week-end's pair of basketball games
with U.C.L.A. if Stanford's offense
j clicked and the defense stood up as
I well as they did yesterday after
j noon against Coach Ben Winkel
man's "Bruins."
Third and fourth stringers were
given Uclan plays to work on yes
terday and Monday afternoon, but
'on the short notice given them
i their plays just didn't click against
I the polished Indian defense.
However, Coach Everett Dean
knows that there is one team which
will make Coach Caddy Works'
plays perform up to regulation—
that club is the Bruins themselves,
who trek northward to the Farm
tomorrow afternoon for Friday and
Saturday night engagements with \
our Cardinals.
BRUINS MAY UPSET
What's worrying Coach Dean is
that the Bruins are so unpredictable
and are liable to upset his plans for
over-taking the Trojans and getting
within striking distance of the
Bears in the Southern Division
race.
In the U.S.C. game two weeks ago,
the Bruins were trailing —as they
usually have been—the Trojans by
a sizeable margin at half time. With
a sudden scoring splurge by Ace i
Calkins and Weldie at the start of
the second half, the Bruins were I
but three points behind.
That's what our Indians will have
to be prepared to meet.
NEW U.C.L.A. SPRINT
Then the Indians are going to j
have the new U.C.L.A. spirit to
contend with. Not a polished out
fit by a long shot, the Bruins have i
made things plenty interesting for
the Bears and Trojans in the three 1
conference games they have lost to j
date and actually have a better of
fensive record —by about 7 points— j
than the Cards. However, their j
defensive record was completely j
shot.
This appears to be U.C.L.A.'s year
to get out of the cellar—at least ■
that's what the southerners con- (
tend. In order to get out of fourth
place, which they've held so long j
that they have practically clinched j
the all-time cellar championship, j
the Bruins figure that the Indians !
are the logical ones to defeat.
As it is, the Cards are only a |
game out of fourth place and two j
games behind the second-place Tro- I
jans. So it appears to be a battle to
see who gets fourth place, and !
neither the Uclans nor our Indians ;
want it.

race.
In the U.S.C. game two weeks ago,
the Bruins were trailing —as they
usually have been—the Trojans by
a sizeable margin at half time. With
a sudden scoring splurge by Ace i
Calkins and Weldie at the start of
the second half, the Bruins were I
but three points behind.
That's what our Indians will have
to be prepared to meet.
NEW U.C.L.A. SPRINT
Then the Indians are going to j
have the new U.C.L.A. spirit to
contend with. Not a polished out
fit by a long shot, the Bruins have i
made things plenty interesting for
the Bears and Trojans in the three 1
conference games they have lost to j
date and actually have a better of
fensive record —by about 7 points— j
than the Cards. However, their j
defensive record was completely j
shot.
This appears to be U.C.L.A.'s year
to get out of the cellar—at least ■
that's what the southerners con- (
tend. In order to get out of fourth
place, which they've held so long j
that they have practically clinched j
the all-time cellar championship, j
the Bruins figure that the Indians !
are the logical ones to defeat.
As it is, the Cards are only a |
game out of fourth place and two j
games behind the second-place Tro- I
jans. So it appears to be a battle to
see who gets fourth place, and !
neither the Uclans nor our Indians ;
want it.
There would be nothing to this
' week-end's pair of basketball games
with U.C.L.A. if Stanford's offense
j clicked and the defense stood up as
I well as they did yesterday after
j noon against Coach Ben Winkel
man's "Bruins."
Third and fourth stringers were
given Uclan plays to work on yes
terday and Monday afternoon, but
'on the short notice given them
i their plays just didn't click against
I the polished Indian defense.
However, Coach Everett Dean
knows that there is one team which
will make Coach Caddy Works'
plays perform up to regulation—
that club is the Bruins themselves,
who trek northward to the Farm
tomorrow afternoon for Friday and
Saturday night engagements with \
our Cardinals.
BRUINS MAY UPSET
What's worrying Coach Dean is
that the Bruins are so unpredictable
and are liable to upset his plans for
over-taking the Trojans and getting
within striking distance of the
Bears in the Southern Division
race.
