## 
### 
Excavation has begun for an ex
tension to the present Union dining
room. The structure is being built
at a cost of about $12,000 and it will
probably be completed by April 1.
"There has been a definite need
for a small dining room on the cam
pus where private dinners could be
held," stated Alfred L. Trowbridge,
assistant comptroller. "and the
completion of this addition will fill
that need."
The new room will extend west
from the present wall 23 feet and
will be the same width as the
I present hall. The arched windows
will be replaced by sliding doors.
| This arrangement will allow the
1 room to be used for private affairs,
jas well as for an enlargement of
i ihe main room for banquets requir-
I ing more space than present facili—
| ties provide. It is also planned to
| build transverse doors in the new
room itself making possible its
i division into two private rooms.
A basement is being dug to pro
| vide more storage space than now
J available. This will be connected
| by a tunnel to present basement
storerooms.
