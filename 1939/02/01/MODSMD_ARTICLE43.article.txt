# Frosh Trackmen Suffer Slump
## 
### 
With the San Mateo J. C. varsity track meet only three weeks away.
Head Coach Dink Tcmpleton and Assistant Coach Bill Ellington have
plenty to worry ahout. They must make a championship track team out
of some 25 tracksters. However, the story is not quite as rosy as all
that, because only ahout 20 are active participants.

â–º The frosh team has only about 13
men who were outstanding stars in
high school. One of these prep;
stars, Bob Hitt, ran :52 in the <>40-
yurd sprint last week. This has been
(he best mark established by the!
frosh quarter milers this year. Bob
: not only turned in the :52 for the j
440, but he also ran a 2:04:05 half)
mile. This mark has not been ap
proached by five seconds to date, 1
which incidentally, is rather poor
considering the proximity of the
San Mateo meet.
JUDY PUSHES HITT
Vein Judy promises to be a close
competitor of Hitt's for the quarter- i
inile honors. This was the general 1
opinion of his team members after I
Vern sprinted the distance in :5(5. :
Three former frosh football stars, |
Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovic, and
Pete Kingsbury have not turned in ;
as remarkable marks in their re- I
spective events as was expected.
Kmetovic, due to a leg injury re- !
ceived last quarter in football, has !
not been able to practice regularly.
His record as a sprinter at San Jose '
high school, however, definitely!
establishes Kmetovic as a member
of the frosh squad. Assistant Coach j
Bill Ellington expressed the view!
that Pete would enter either the
220 or the quarter mile.
In the pole vault, two Southern ;
California boys, Ed Tomaso and
Bill Van Dorn, have cleared the 12-
l'oot mark. Al Wool, their nearest!
competitor, has cleared 11 feet 0
inches. Mel Ellet threw the jave- j
lin consistently between 150 and !
160 feet last week. In the discus j
Larry Partridge has thrown 120 ,
feet; Ray Durham, close on his heels, j
has just missed Larry's mark, with 1
a throw of about 115.
ONE CENTURY MAN
Bill Quackenbush, the frosh':; I
only good century man, has run the i
distance in 10:06. Aside from these !
few mainstays and about, five more, I
the frosh are in a sorry plight.
There are no two-milers, milers, j
half-milers (aside from Hitt), or!
broad jumpers of any note.
Of course the season is still quite j
young, but with only three weeks
of good pracitce, barring rain, be- '
fore the first meet, Stanford's frosh j
track team is in a rut.
