Last night it was the Kappa blue
against the Theta yellow in a thrill
ing overtime basketball game be
tween the hashers of the two soro
rities. Colorful rooting sections,
songs and yells urged on the two
teams. The winners after a nerve
tingling three-minute overtime pe
riod were the Kappa food slingers.
In a see-saw battle constantly
punctuated by piercing screams from
opposite rooting sections the players
refreshed themselves on cokes dur
ing time-out periods and took many
a rough tumble for their pretty fans.

Chickens sometimes suffer from a
form of tuberculosis for which there
is no known cure.
