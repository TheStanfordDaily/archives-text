WITH question of minor sport recognition
for Rifle Club and Ski Club, Ex Committee
last night discovered a messy if not noisome
brew in the form of the A.S.S.U.'s system of
minor letter awards.
The odorous pot has been uncovered before;
last year when Ski Club made its first bid, Ex
Committee hit an all-time high in reversing
its field by first granting, then withholding
recognition.
Last night, something of the same thing
seemed likely to occur when, after a bitter
battle, Rifle Club received recognition, and Ski
Club, fought as bitterly, trembled on the verge,
was held over until next meeting. But the
seeming vacillation on the part of Ex Com
mittee is more apparent than real.
They can do little else but jitter in the face
of the present minor award situation. While the
process of awarding letters for each individual
sport is seldom open to question, the whole
basis for awards is a muddy pond which needs
a thorough cleaning.
With the recognition of several sports not
originally put in the system, and with the
simultaneous lack of clear statements as to
why recognition was given, Ex Committee is
now in the position of not knowing just exactly
what minor awards stand for, why some or
ganizations rightfully claim them while others
are given the blackball.
Typically, all awards are recognition, not only
of service or endeavor, but of achievement;
on a broad systematic basis, one would sup
pose that sports with enough participation and
enthusiasm to stand high in competition with
other universities might have some claim to
recognition.
These opinions, however, are as subject to
question as those of disagreeing Ex Committee
members.
And that is about the only point concerning
minor sports awards on which Excom does
agree—that they disagree.
So, to make a long editorial longer, a com
mittee has been appointed, and high time, to
investigate the situation. No one, minor sports,
new sports, or Ex Committee has the slightest
idea where their policy road can be found. The
trail has been too confused by the footprints of
past conflicting decisions. The committee's re
port may break a new path.
Minor sports awards will undoubtedly be
constitutionally revised. To some, the revisions
will make no difference; to others, it will mean
they are counted out of the system.
But at least some clear, equitable policy will
be established. And when Ski Club comes up
again, the answer may turn up a little sooner
and a little more firmly put than it has in the
past.
