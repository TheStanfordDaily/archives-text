# Dear Al. . .
## 
### 
I REMEMBER a year or two back when grass
where I need a haircut now, I thought that a
man up the staff, turning in reviews, was doing
about the best writing in The Daily. Now, three
years later, I still think so, Al.
Before I wash out, a word about the slick,
trimmed literary style that culminated last week
in the best interview The Daily has printed;
the rich background of current national and
international affairs; the shrewd, direct think
ing which put point to A. S. D. in print.
This was a bad volume for associates; they
took tail-end subjects which I was too lazy to
write. So, much of that personality, that back
ground was hidden. But it was there.
This is curtains for us both, but . . .
Your name will pop up again. This ;ime cn
the cover of a book. Which makes Daily 8-point
slugs look silly.—Jim
