# The 						New Man
## 
### 
HE didn't make a lot of fuss when he first
walked into the Shack, began to work like
a past master still in his prime; he moved along
rapidly but quietly. And efficiently, working
on his own head of steam.
9 Now he's got Harry Press, trucking in the
managing editor's office, backed by experience
and a feeling for staff esprit de corps. He's got
Larry Livingston and Dick Dudman for asso
ciates, smooth writers, long-nosed on news,
short-sighted on errors of judgment. And Jean
Halliburton to bring in tryoutees.
He has a wolf-pack of night editors who com
bine experience and talent. He's got a lower
staff seasoned by now, weeded of lame ducks,
ready to work.
He has an editor's dream in the staff of Vol
ume 95.
But the man who will drive this powerhouse,

and drive it: the man with an Eisenbach news
sense, a Jorgensen twist of quiet humor. He'll
move into the office without fireworks. But in
his hand will be matches to light fires.
His eye will be on the front page, on news,
on Stanford. Back page, his head will coolly
officiate the casting of 18-em editorial lines,
and make them sing.
Spring volume often sags. This one will arch
its back and purr like a diving bomber.
Stanford knows him now as H. L. S. ( as a by
line quality story writer.
Over here in the Shack, they know him by
his walk: lightly, politely, and with deep foot
prints.
