# BULL SESSION
## DANGER, CHILDREN AT PLAY 
### JOHN COBBS 
W/OMEN'S CONFERENCE gritted its teeth yester
day, and announced in a love-me-love-my-dog
tone of voice that its nominating committee would be
used in the coming women's elections. Ordinarily I
would rate the news value of the proclamation some
where below that of a lecture on prospecting in Per
sia and Afghanistan, announced further down the
column. As long as the women play in their own
back yard and don't tamper with student government
in general, I have no quarrel with them. But in this
case Conference asks With the rashness of uncertainty
for criticism. And so without malice, I shall criticize
in the best big brother fashion.
For some time now, it has been obvious even to
amateur political scientists that Stanford women are
hopelessly over-organized. Women's activities are a
welter of committees, councils, clubs and conferences.
It seems that two Stanford girls can't decide to go
to a movie without forming a committee on arrange
ments. Under the circumstances, to set up a nomi
nating committee is simply to add another current to
the organizational rip-tide.
* * * *
A s . FAR as I can see, Conference has a sort of
mystic faith in its step child. It seems to believe
that interviews and investigations will solve the prob
lems that have plagued democracies ever since the
days when Greece was on the golden-age standard.
Theoretically the committee will confer with pros
pective candidates, weeding out the unqualified and
injecting into all a sense of responsibility and sacred
trust. But even here the committee does no more than
duplicate the functions of existing bodies. Election
board is supposed to check on the qualifications of
candidates, and there are a half a dozen assorted
organizations intended to build the qualities of lead
ership.
The nominating committee will be just one more
block piled on top of an already shaky pile. If it
replaces the caucus, it is undemocratic, and Women's
Conference would shudder at that thought. If it
does not replace other organizations, it is one more
useless group that takes up the women's time when
they ought to be out playing in the fresh air.
As things stand now, women's activities are a
sort of free-for-all. Committees clash over jurisdic
tion. Councils duplicate each other's work. Govern
ment is vaguely divided among Conference, Council,
clearing house, various committees. The question of
sovereignty would break a political scientist's heart.
The nominating committee can add nothing but
one more voice to the mob noises. But at that, it is
a pretty plaything, and it keeps Conference enter
tained.

sort of free-for-all. Committees clash over jurisdic
tion. Councils duplicate each other's work. Govern
ment is vaguely divided among Conference, Council,
clearing house, various committees. The question of
sovereignty would break a political scientist's heart.
The nominating committee can add nothing but
one more voice to the mob noises. But at that, it is
a pretty plaything, and it keeps Conference enter
tained.
W/OMEN'S CONFERENCE gritted its teeth yester
day, and announced in a love-me-love-my-dog
tone of voice that its nominating committee would be
used in the coming women's elections. Ordinarily I
would rate the news value of the proclamation some
where below that of a lecture on prospecting in Per
sia and Afghanistan, announced further down the
column. As long as the women play in their own
back yard and don't tamper with student government
in general, I have no quarrel with them. But in this
case Conference asks With the rashness of uncertainty
for criticism. And so without malice, I shall criticize
in the best big brother fashion.
For some time now, it has been obvious even to
amateur political scientists that Stanford women are
hopelessly over-organized. Women's activities are a
welter of committees, councils, clubs and conferences.
It seems that two Stanford girls can't decide to go
to a movie without forming a committee on arrange
ments. Under the circumstances, to set up a nomi
nating committee is simply to add another current to
the organizational rip-tide.

A s . FAR as I can see, Conference has a sort of
mystic faith in its step child. It seems to believe
that interviews and investigations will solve the prob
lems that have plagued democracies ever since the
days when Greece was on the golden-age standard.
Theoretically the committee will confer with pros
pective candidates, weeding out the unqualified and
injecting into all a sense of responsibility and sacred
trust. But even here the committee does no more than
duplicate the functions of existing bodies. Election
board is supposed to check on the qualifications of
candidates, and there are a half a dozen assorted
organizations intended to build the qualities of lead
ership.
The nominating committee will be just one more
block piled on top of an already shaky pile. If it
replaces the caucus, it is undemocratic, and Women's
Conference would shudder at that thought. If it
does not replace other organizations, it is one more
useless group that takes up the women's time when
they ought to be out playing in the fresh air.
As things stand now, women's activities are a
sort of free-for-all. Committees clash over jurisdic
tion. Councils duplicate each other's work. Govern
ment is vaguely divided among Conference, Council,
