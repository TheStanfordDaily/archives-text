### DOUC JAQUES 
Riding in the taxi was the start of their honeymoon.
They had been married that morning, and now they
were on their way to the boat which was going to
take them to the South Seas.
"You seem nervous," she said.
"No," he said, going into falsetto. "Not at all," he
said, coming out of it.
"Ah, he's afraid he'll be seasick," she cooed.
"Nonsense."
"Don't 'ou worry. I'll protect my itzy bitsy bub
bums."
"What?"
"I won't let the nassy old waves hurt ims."
He looked at her. "Did you say what I think you
said?"
"Yes. And you're going to have to get used to it.
If I didn't talk like that to you, mother wouldn't think
we were happy."
lie said a nasty thing about her mother.
"I know it," she said.
Their first quarrel ended that briefly. They
were very modern.
"But I'm just like her," she sighed.
"I know it," he said.
Somehow their second quarrel ended briefly,
too. They were very modern.
That night when the moon was high they were out
on the deck of the ship. They had started out their
first day of marriage with great concessions. At din
ner she promised not to talk baby-talk for a whole
day. He promised not to fidget.
"But I'm not nervous," he said. "It's just—well—
it's just—"
"Of course not. But you won't fidget, will you?"
"Oh, all right."
But out on the deck after dinner it was very
romantic. They looked at the moon. They winked at
each other. They even giggled a little. Suddenly and
romantically he took her hand, and in spite of every
thing he did it rather tenderly.
"You're very lovely," he said in rather a jumble.
She skillfully lowered her eyelashes.
He kissed her. A cold shiver went down his back.
Before their honcymon was over, he came to
know that cold shiver quite well. He came to know
that whenever you stand too close to the rail of a
small ship on heavy seas, you'll get drenched.
After he had changed his clothes and they were
sitting with warming drinks in their hands close
to a lire, he had a hard time keeping from fidget
ing. He was worried. It was enough to make any
man worry. He loved her very much. Why had he
asked her to marry him? Well. yes. But he loved
her very much.
But for him to get married! It was going to he
awfully embarrassing.
When they had retired to their stateroom, he set
an alarm for 5 o'clock.
"But why five," she said.
"Oh, you know. Exercise. Get up in the morning
and run around the deck a couple of times and then
take a cold shower. Exercise. Wonderful thing."
"But 5 o'clock!"
"Wonderful thing." ho said. "Wonderful."
He would try it for a while. He had to.
He hadn't missed a day in three years.
Every morning at G o'clock sharp he fell out of
bed.

"No," he said, going into falsetto. "Not at all," he
said, coming out of it.
"Ah, he's afraid he'll be seasick," she cooed.
"Nonsense."
"Don't 'ou worry. I'll protect my itzy bitsy bub
bums."
"What?"
"I won't let the nassy old waves hurt ims."
He looked at her. "Did you say what I think you
said?"
"Yes. And you're going to have to get used to it.
If I didn't talk like that to you, mother wouldn't think
we were happy."
lie said a nasty thing about her mother.
"I know it," she said.
Their first quarrel ended that briefly. They
were very modern.
"But I'm just like her," she sighed.
"I know it," he said.
Somehow their second quarrel ended briefly,
too. They were very modern.
That night when the moon was high they were out
on the deck of the ship. They had started out their
first day of marriage with great concessions. At din
ner she promised not to talk baby-talk for a whole
day. He promised not to fidget.
"But I'm not nervous," he said. "It's just—well—
it's just—"
"Of course not. But you won't fidget, will you?"
"Oh, all right."
But out on the deck after dinner it was very
romantic. They looked at the moon. They winked at
each other. They even giggled a little. Suddenly and
romantically he took her hand, and in spite of every
thing he did it rather tenderly.
"You're very lovely," he said in rather a jumble.
She skillfully lowered her eyelashes.
He kissed her. A cold shiver went down his back.
Before their honcymon was over, he came to
know that cold shiver quite well. He came to know
that whenever you stand too close to the rail of a
small ship on heavy seas, you'll get drenched.
After he had changed his clothes and they were
sitting with warming drinks in their hands close
to a lire, he had a hard time keeping from fidget
ing. He was worried. It was enough to make any
man worry. He loved her very much. Why had he
asked her to marry him? Well. yes. But he loved
her very much.
But for him to get married! It was going to he
awfully embarrassing.
When they had retired to their stateroom, he set
an alarm for 5 o'clock.
"But why five," she said.
"Oh, you know. Exercise. Get up in the morning
and run around the deck a couple of times and then
take a cold shower. Exercise. Wonderful thing."
"But 5 o'clock!"
"Wonderful thing." ho said. "Wonderful."
He would try it for a while. He had to.
He hadn't missed a day in three years.
Every morning at G o'clock sharp he fell out of
bed.
Riding in the taxi was the start of their honeymoon.
They had been married that morning, and now they
were on their way to the boat which was going to
take them to the South Seas.
"You seem nervous," she said.
"No," he said, going into falsetto. "Not at all," he
said, coming out of it.
"Ah, he's afraid he'll be seasick," she cooed.
"Nonsense."
"Don't 'ou worry. I'll protect my itzy bitsy bub
