### 

CORNELIS BOL, Stanford University research associate in physics,
demonstrates a new type mercury arc lamp, about the size of a
kitchen match, which is so powerful it will light an airport. Si/.e of
the lamp is indicated in insert, held by a man's fingers. The lamp is
encased in a quartz tube and cooled by water under high pressure.
It is so hot the temperature is measured by thousands of degrees.
