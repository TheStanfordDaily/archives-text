# CAMPUS OPINION
## LOWER DIVISION 'PROFS' 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Is it not time that Stanford should
act, in a single body, to oust, by
sentiment, some of the inadequate
graduate students the university
employs to teach its lower divi
sion?
Dr. Hutchins states, in "The
Higher Learning," that the modern,
four-year college follows one of two
policies in dealing with lower divi
sions. Either the college employs
old-time profs who are noted for
their keeping the class awake and
amused or the college employs
graduate students who, because of
their inferior ability, are paid less
and the university is able to save
money for the higher things of col
lege such as beautiful gardens,
gothic spires, or even fountains.
And it seems that Stanford is fol
lowing this line of action. I don't
even look for some of the instruc
tors I have in the faculty register
any more; I look in the student list
in the Bawlout.
If the prof docs not teach you
much, at least the prof should offer
some kind of inspiration to learn
something by yourself. Some of the
instructors have the attitude that
they and we are just working to
gether to pass a designated ex.
The University is too fine to be
marred by these low-ceilinged
sophists. Stanford is being emas
culated by its want to glorify the
graduate schools and put the fresh
men under the guidance of spirit
less pedantics.
I could learn as much from
brother.
And save $115
