# WHY A BAWLOUT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We would like to know what bene- !
fit there is in publishing the aca- â€¢
domic standing of Ihe students of!
this University in the so called
"bawlout." We feel that our lack ;
of gray matter is our own personal I
affair, and need not concern the i
public. In the past this part of the
publication has served mainly to
satisfy the curiosity of the "grade
snoopers."
We do not object to having the 1
names and addresses of the better j
eighth o f Stanford womanhood pub- j
lished, as it will probably prove j
beneficial to both them and us in
the long run, but we do believe that
it is unnecessary to have their grades
staring us in the face.
Why not just publish a roster o>"
the students enrolled? In this way j
(he University would still get their j
15 cents per copy and would save !
the ink used in printing the un- '
wanted grades.
Gor Gawd's sake,
Encina, plus and minus (?)
