# Traditions Prevent Indian Assimilation
## 
### JACK BURTT 
Because of strong tribal distinc
tions, definite tribal customs, and
the fact that the Pueblo Indians are
happy in their present circumstances,
it would be a mistake to attempt to
assimilate them, in the opinion of
Walt Stoessel, Stanford debater who
traveled through New Mexico with
the debate squad.
"Indian leaders and Indian serv
ice men in the federal government
feel that the Indians should retain
their racial and cultural identity,"
Stoessel said. "They are happy with
their life, and are making a definite
and unique contribution to our
American life."
The chief obstacle which has al
ways stood in the way of a policy of
assimilation is the fact that each of
the 19 pueblos in New Mexico is a
cultural unit in itself, according to
Stoessel. While the Pueblo Indians
are a separate anthropological group,
he said the strong lines between
tribes and pueblos actually divide
them into small groups
ATTEMPTED ASSIMILATION
To break down this individualistic
culture in each pueblo, the govern
ment, under older regimes, sent the
children of one pueblo to the school
of another with the idea of develop
ing a common culture and breaking
down ancient tribal allegiances.
The Indians protested against this
policy, obviously not agreeing with
it—and with the newer thought in
government which has seen the wis
dom of making the Indians an eco
nomically and socially independent
people has come a reversal.
The present policy is to encour
age the Indians to return to theii
own communities where they maj
carry on their traditional religious
and tribal customs.
MODERNIZATION PROCEEDS
Since the Pueblo Indians are t
home-loving people, far removec
from the nomadic tribes to the north
loving their pueblos and their peace
ful manner of life, this latter policj
is appealing to them.
And this policy of encouraging
their ethnic unity has led to a more
willing acceptance by the Indians o
other federal policies. They want t(
(learn new methods of agriculture
and are anxious for a degree o
modernization now that they knov
their tribal lines and pueblos an
I secure, Stoessel pointed out.
"Tlie Indians in each pueblo an
J intensely proud." Stoessel concluded
I "They show no desire to be assimi
! lated, and the Indian service ha
j recognized this fact. The govern
! mentis now doing its best to hoi]
them establish communities wher
they can make their own destinj
grow the food they enjoy, and live ii
accordancc with their ideals and re
1 ligion."

Since the Pueblo Indians are t
home-loving people, far removec
from the nomadic tribes to the north
loving their pueblos and their peace
ful manner of life, this latter policj
is appealing to them.
And this policy of encouraging
their ethnic unity has led to a more
willing acceptance by the Indians o
other federal policies. They want t(

and are anxious for a degree o
modernization now that they knov
their tribal lines and pueblos an
I secure, Stoessel pointed out.
"Tlie Indians in each pueblo an
J intensely proud." Stoessel concluded
I "They show no desire to be assimi
! lated, and the Indian service ha
j recognized this fact. The govern
! mentis now doing its best to hoi]
them establish communities wher
they can make their own destinj
grow the food they enjoy, and live ii
accordancc with their ideals and re
1 ligion."
Because of strong tribal distinc
tions, definite tribal customs, and
the fact that the Pueblo Indians are
happy in their present circumstances,
it would be a mistake to attempt to
assimilate them, in the opinion of
Walt Stoessel, Stanford debater who
traveled through New Mexico with
the debate squad.
"Indian leaders and Indian serv
ice men in the federal government
feel that the Indians should retain
their racial and cultural identity,"
Stoessel said. "They are happy with
their life, and are making a definite
and unique contribution to our
American life."
The chief obstacle which has al
ways stood in the way of a policy of
assimilation is the fact that each of
the 19 pueblos in New Mexico is a
cultural unit in itself, according to
Stoessel. While the Pueblo Indians
are a separate anthropological group,
he said the strong lines between
tribes and pueblos actually divide
them into small groups
ATTEMPTED ASSIMILATION
To break down this individualistic
culture in each pueblo, the govern
ment, under older regimes, sent the
children of one pueblo to the school
of another with the idea of develop
ing a common culture and breaking
down ancient tribal allegiances.
The Indians protested against this
policy, obviously not agreeing with
it—and with the newer thought in
government which has seen the wis
dom of making the Indians an eco
nomically and socially independent
people has come a reversal.
The present policy is to encour
age the Indians to return to theii
own communities where they maj
carry on their traditional religious
and tribal customs.
