### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
best known man at Stanford
is not listed in the Bawlout;
he's neither student nor faculty
member. He lives in a square Pueblo
house on the top of San Juan Hill,
overlooking the campus. Often and
again he descends the hill and
travels about the United States giv
ing his opinion of how the man
who defeated him for the presiden
cy in 1932 is handling the affairs of
the nation.
Today Herbert Hoover is certain
ly not the Republican party's fa
vorite son; rather he is its bearded
prophet, its Isaiah, sounding the
trump of doom for a misguided na
tion, cursed with the New Deal. In
this, his usual role, the only liv
ing ex-President yesterday issued
storm warnings that Roosevelt's in
ternational policy is going to lead
the United States into war.
* * #
r I I IIE exact nature of this pol
icy was revealed Tuesday
when the President assured a
Senate committee that this coun
try must give active support to
the Democracies of Europe in the
impending world conflict. The
substance of his recommendation
was thai the United States should
favor France and England in the
sale of munitions and should ex
ercise economic sanctions against
Fascist aggressors.
u As a matter of fact," said Mr.
Roosevelt in effect, "I've already
started the ball rolling." And he
told the committeemen of how we
are selling GOO of our best planes
to the French government. As is
usual in such presidential confer
ences, the Senators were pledged to
secrecy regarding the proceedings,
and an aura of mystery surrounded
all reports that drifted beyond the
pale of sworn silence.
* * r
jVEWS of the munitions intrigue,
of President Rosevelt's latest
policy sped to the ears of the lead
ers of Europe and the significant
speech-makers of America. Yester
day the world echoed with reper
cussions of the affair of the 600 air
planes.
Herbert Hoover warned the na
tion that the President's program,
based on positive expectation of
war, will lead the way to armed
conflict and the establishment of
a dictatorship in the United
States. Standing firmly against
support for one side or (he other
in the Fascism-Democracy strug
gle, the ex-President insisted that
the United States' part in inter
national affairs should be limited
exclusively to movements for the
preservation of peace.
$ * jJ;
[yiEANWHILE, in the Senate, of
ficial voices were added to the
clamor against Roosevelt's clandes
tine favoritism of France and the
revelation of military secrets,
whether in the interests of Democ
racy or otherwise. Senate leaders
were loud in their denunciation of
the President's move and indignant
at his daring to cloak with mystery
his action on so vital an issue.
"Good God," bellowed old-time
California Republican Hiram John
son, "don't you think the American
people have the right to know if
they aie going down the road to
war?" Other Senators joined in a
chorus in the same key with only
Democratic Leader Barkley de
fending the Administration against
the slings and arrows.

jVATURALLY the appearance
of an active anti-Fascist pol
icy in the United States produced
varied responses from the nations
of Europe, each according to its
place in the political picture.
Enraged Germany called Presi
dent Roosevelt a war monger and
accused him of trying to destroy the
peace-making effects of Hitler's
conciliatory Reichstag speech.
On the other side of the Maginot
line, France grinned broadly and
excitedly quoted an alleged bit of
tactlessness on Roosevelt's part to
the effect that "the first lino of the
United States' defense lies in
France."
