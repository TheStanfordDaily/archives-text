# Junior Class Skiers Hit Snow Trail Friday
## 
### 
Tomorrow and Saturday will see
150 skiers migrate from the Farm to
the snow-covered slopes of Badger
Pass for the junior class ski week
end and the Yosemite Winter Club
invitational meet.
All of the 150 available reserva
tions in the dormitories have been
taken, but students who so desire
may reserve cabins at the Yosemite
Lodge by phoning the San Fran
cisco office of the Yosemite Park
and Curry Company. The price is
$3 per person.
Anyone who has made a reserva
tion for this week-end at the A. S.
S. U. office and who will not be
able to make the trip is requested to
take his name off the list today in
order that, students now on the wait
ing list may be accommodated, if
possible. According to Bill Janss,
chairman for the junior week-end,
students who have not secured res
ervations should not drive to Yose
mite, as there will be no place for
them to stay.
Downhill and slalom races will be
the features of the annual invita
tional meet in which Captain Bill
Janss, A1 Zuckerman, Lloyd Davis,
and Bill Rosenfeld of the Stanford
ski team will take part.
The recent snowfall has pro
vided perfect skiing conditions at
Badger Pass with all the runs open
for the first time this year.
