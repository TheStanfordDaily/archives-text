# Diners to Hold Reopen Confab
## Knox Calls Meeting At Brainier Tonight 
### 
Hall men interested in the pro
jected reopening of the Branner
Dining Hall will meet there tonight
at 7:30 o'clock.
Maurice Knox, chief campaigner
for the plan, asks particularly that
freshmen who have not yet made
provision for meals next year attend
the meeting.
Dean of Men John Bunn has
agreed to be present and take part
in the discussion. The modern kitch
en will be open for inspection.
Opened nine years ago when
Branner Hall was built, the dining
hall was shut down before the first
year had passed because of lack of
patronage. If demand proves to be
renewed, the dining room can be
reopened, according to Assistant
Comptroller Ernest Erwin.
