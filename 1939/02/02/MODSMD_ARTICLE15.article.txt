### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 (UP).â€”The
Administration will soon ask Con
gress for legislation to make the
Public Works Administration a per
manent, $1,000,000,000 a year agency
to combat unemployment, and to
centralize federal relief projects, it
was disclosed tonight.
The United Press learned from a
usually reliable source that a bill
for the proposal has been drafted,
without the direct sanction of PWA
Administrator Harold S. Ickes, and
it will be submitted to the House and
Senate within two weeks.
The program will closely parallel
recommendations of the special
committee headed by Senator James
F. Byrnes, D., S.C., which inquired
into the feasibility of a permanent
unemployment program and later
urged a permanent long-range con
struction program.
It is understood the bill would
continue the present administrative
and financial setup under which the
federal government contributes 55
per cent of the cost of projects and
the state and local governments 45
per cent.
