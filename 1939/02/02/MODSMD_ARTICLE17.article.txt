Adventures of a youthful Magel
lan of the twentieth century were
related yesterday afternoon when
Captain Dwight Long, skipper of a
32-foot boat in which he sailed 35,000
miles around the world in a four
year cruise, spoke in Memorial Hall
auditorium. The lecture was illus
trated with motion pictures and
slides taken by the speaker during
his globe-trotting excursion.
Stories of the hardships and "close
calls" experienced on the cruise
were recounted by the 25-year-old
adventurer, who four years ago de
cided to forsake the security of col
lege to learn about the world at
first-hand. Since that time he has
visited the far corners of the earth,
including Tahiti, New Zealand, Aus
tralia, Bali, Jerusalem, Egypt, and
Ceylon.
HELD BY REBELS .
"By the law of averages, I prob
ably should be dead right now," as
serted Captain Long, who explained
how he was captured by a Rebel
cruiser off the coast of Spain and
imprisoned for several days by the
Insurgent government, which mis
took him for a person who it learned
was plotting the assassination of
Generalissimo Francisco Franco.
Pilot of the smallest boat ever to
make the voyage to England by way
of the Pacific and the Mediterranean,
the globe girdler told of being be
calmed for days in the middle of the
Pacific, while his companion lay
seriously ill from a sudden attack of
appendicitis, and of weathering se
vere storms which nearly capsized
his tiny craft.
TELLS DIFFICULTIES
"Natives throughout the world
adopt most of the white man's vices
and very few of his virtues," de
clared the speaker, who told of his
difficulty in securing a satisfactory
traveling companion, finally having
to choose a young native boy who
knew but a few words of English and
absolutely nothing of navigation.
Captain Long spent a year in Eng
land, where he gave numerous lec
tures in theaters, colleges, and uni
versities befox'e completing his cir
cumnavigation of the globe last year
when he sailed into New York har
bor after 46 days on the Atlantic.
