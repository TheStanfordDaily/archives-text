# Farm Film Fans Offered Realistic Russian Picture
## 
### 
Interested Farm movie fans will
be treated Sunday evening at 7:30
o'clock to a grade-A Russian flicker,
"Chapayev, the Red Commander,"
probably one of the juiciest, bloodiest
sagas ever brought; to the screen
without the aid of Hollywood.
The absence of Hollywood flash
has made "Chapayex" a picture that
is true to life and truly different, as
shown by New York journalistic
acclaim and by its extended seven
week New York run.
Muttered Russian dialogue in the
flicker will be underlined by cursory
English titles, thus doing away al
most entirely with the average au
dience's foreign film confusion.
Admission tickets to this spec
tacle, which is to be presented in
Memorial Hall, will be sold to stu
dents for 20 cents.
