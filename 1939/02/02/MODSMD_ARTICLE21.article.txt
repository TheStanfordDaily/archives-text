# 4000 Strike At San Quentin
## Convicts Demand More Varied Menu 
### 
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Feb. 1
(UP). —Four thousand San Quentin
prison convicts participated tonight
in a strike against prison rations,
protesting that corned beef hash
appeared too often on the menu
served the 5500 convicts.
Warden Court Smith said the
number of demonstrators increased
from 1200 at the noontime meal to
4000 at dinner.
I do not know whether all the
1000 were protesting against the
food or merely joined because they
were afraid of not joining.
MARCHED TO CELLS
Smith said the men, after refusing
to enter the dining hall for the
evening meal, marched quietly to
their cells.
The demonstration began at the
noon-day luncheon when the 5500
convicts housed here in the "world's
largest prison" were marched to the
dining halls.
More than 3500 of them entered.
The other 1500 suddenly halted their
march, squatted in the yard, and
started booing.
"We want more variety in our
meals," they cried. "We're sick and
tired of corned beef hash "
Warden Court Smith let them sit
in the yard and informed them the
dining room would remain open for
any who cared to use it.
CHANGE ORDEr.ED
"The mer can remain in the yard
until nightfall if they vish," the
6-foot 6-inch warden «>aid. Then
they will be marched ; o their cells.'"
Smith said he had tried a change
in the variety of prison meals be
fore the demonstration
"Apparently the leaders of the
sit-down strike were fakes," he said.
The sit-down was orderly and
there was no trouble, the men re
maining in the yard and other con
victs, after lunch, marching back to
their tasks in the prison shops.
