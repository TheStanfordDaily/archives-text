# Quad Opens Pix Contest To Campus
## 
### 
In order to help fill out the addi
tional pages to be included in the
candid picture section of the 1939
Quad, Howard Roberts, head pho
tographer, is announcing a photo
contest open to all students.
Candids arc to be laid out in two
page spreads, each of which will be
devoted to a particular phase of
campus life, such as "Stanford Skis,"
or "Stanford in the Rain." For each
complete series which is published in
the book this year, a free Quad will
be awarded.
Roberts emphasized that contest
ants should not hesitate to hand in
part of a group or series, since some
one else might contribute pictures
which would complete the section.
If not, Ihe Quad staff of eight pho
tographers will be able to complete
certain sections.
The Quad reserves the right to use
any photographs submitted, and will
return the negatives, which must
accompany all contributions, on May
,15. Candids will be judged on the
bases of originality, technical excel
lence, idea of the sequence, and, of
course, their adaptability for the
Quad.
