# Hoover Sounds Dictator Danger
## War Would Spread Totalitarianism To U.S., Ex-President Warns 
### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 1 (UP).—Another great war may make dictatorship
universal, extending even to the United States, Herbert Hoover said to
night in a discussion of "President Roosevelt's New Foreign Policies"
The former President told the Council on Foreign Relations that in
j another great war "democracy must temporarily surrender to dictator-

ship" which could not easily be
broken down once the war was over.
"It means," he said, "that our
country must be mobilized into prac
tically a fascist state. It would bo
so organized. It went some distance
in the last war, although we did not
use that term at the time. It would
have gohe much farther if the war
had extended longer.
LAUDS ROOSEVELT
"I speak of this not from hearsay
but as one who participated in the
economic organization of the Great
War. I saw the rise of opposition to
demobilization of the interests which
benefited. But we secured the imme
diate and courageous demobilization
of this economic power over the daily
lives of our people because of the
backing of a real lover of human
liberty—Woodrow Wilson."
Mr. Hoover questioned the neces
sity of President Roosevelt's pro
posed increase "in our already large
armament" and what the former
President termed "Mr. Roosevelt's
new expansion of foreign policies"
"The sum of his proposal," Mr.
Hoover said, "is that we make effec
tive protest at acts of aggression
against sister nations. He says we
must use methods stronger than
words and short of war. He asks for
armament to back his extensions..
Such a program, Mr. Hoover said,
calls for supplies to one side and
economic sanctions to the other, with
the problem of determining which is
the aggressor and "a complete de
parture from neutrality." It would
be futile unless undertaken with
co-operation of other nations and
would invite reprisals, he added.
HITS NATIONAL POLICY
"Any nation which sets up such
policies and builds an armament of
dimensions to back them is sure to
arouse fear," Mr. Hoover declared.
"This idea of America sitting alone
determining who and what in the
world shall stop and go would make
us suspect of the whole world. It is
certain that combinations of power
will arise against a nation which does
that, no matter how good neighborly
its words may be.
"Let me say at once that, any
form of direct or indirect coercion of
nations is force and is the straight
path to war itself. No husky nation
will stand such pressures without
bloody resistance.
"Those who think in terms of
economic sanctions should also think
in terms of war."
