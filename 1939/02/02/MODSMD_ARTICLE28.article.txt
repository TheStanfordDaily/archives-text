## 
### 
An appeal to "invest in Stanford"
by contributing money for support
of teaching, research, scholarships,
: libraries, or any other useful pur
pose, went out yesterday to 33.000
. Stanford alumni all over the world.
| Occasion was the opening of the
third annual appeal conducted by
the Stanford Fund to increase the
University's non-tuition income.
Alumni, including members of the
Class of '38. last year boosted the
Stanford budget by $38,353 by their
contributions to the 1937 appeal.
Dave Ryus, senior president, plans
a meeting of senior living group
representatives February 9 to
launch the appeal to seniors on
campus, he announced yesterday.
BULLETIN MAILED
The story of why Stanford needs
money is told in the Stanford Fund
Bulletin, published as an adjunct
of the appeal and mailed to alumni
along with letters soliciting con
tributions. It discloses a dozen Uni
versity projects, taken at random,
for which funds are needed in small
amounts. For example, the Bulle

tin tells why $850 is wanted to start
television research in electrical en
gineering, why $350 is needed to
keep Sociology 199 (introduction to
social work) in the Time Schedule,
why increased scholarship funds are
much desired.
"Every dollar you give equals a
$25 endowment," says the Stanford
Fund Bulletin. "At the current re
turn of 4 per cent on the Univer
sity's investments, $25 of endow
ment yields $1 of income annually.
"Every dollar contributed through
the Fund goes directly to Stanford
University. Contributions are used
for holding outstanding professors at
Stanford in the face of competitive
bidding from other universities and
from industry, for research, for
scholarships, for improving the lib
rary, for doing countless useful jobs
that, without the Fund, would not
be done at all."
SPECIFIC USES
A feature of the third annual ap
peal expected to attract the interest
of alumni and seniors is the oppor
tunity which is offei'ed for designat
ing shifts for specific uses. In this
way, contributors are encouraged to
find some University project that
interests them and apply their mon
ey to that.
Paul C. Edwards, '06, associate
editor of the San Francisco News, is
chairman of the alumni committee
conducting the appeal this year. It
runs from February 1 to June 1.

Class of '38. last year boosted the
Stanford budget by $38,353 by their
contributions to the 1937 appeal.
Dave Ryus, senior president, plans
a meeting of senior living group
representatives February 9 to
launch the appeal to seniors on
campus, he announced yesterday.
BULLETIN MAILED
The story of why Stanford needs
money is told in the Stanford Fund
Bulletin, published as an adjunct
of the appeal and mailed to alumni
along with letters soliciting con
tributions. It discloses a dozen Uni
versity projects, taken at random,
for which funds are needed in small
amounts. For example, the Bulle

tin tells why $850 is wanted to start
television research in electrical en
gineering, why $350 is needed to
keep Sociology 199 (introduction to
social work) in the Time Schedule,
why increased scholarship funds are
much desired.
"Every dollar you give equals a
$25 endowment," says the Stanford
Fund Bulletin. "At the current re
turn of 4 per cent on the Univer
sity's investments, $25 of endow
ment yields $1 of income annually.
"Every dollar contributed through
the Fund goes directly to Stanford
University. Contributions are used
for holding outstanding professors at
Stanford in the face of competitive
bidding from other universities and
from industry, for research, for
scholarships, for improving the lib
rary, for doing countless useful jobs
that, without the Fund, would not
be done at all."
SPECIFIC USES
A feature of the third annual ap
peal expected to attract the interest
of alumni and seniors is the oppor
tunity which is offei'ed for designat
ing shifts for specific uses. In this
way, contributors are encouraged to
find some University project that
interests them and apply their mon
ey to that.
Paul C. Edwards, '06, associate
editor of the San Francisco News, is
chairman of the alumni committee
conducting the appeal this year. It
runs from February 1 to June 1.
An appeal to "invest in Stanford"

of teaching, research, scholarships,
: libraries, or any other useful pur
pose, went out yesterday to 33.000
. Stanford alumni all over the world.
