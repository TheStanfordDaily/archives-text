# Women Nominators To See 60 Politicos
## 
### 
Functioning for the second time,
! the nominating committee for women
| running in A.S.S.U. elections will
| meet this afternoon from 1:30 to 4
o'clock in Room 15 of the Old Union
to interview the 60 candidates whose
names have been turned in for the
four positions open to women in the
j mid-year elections.
Posts for which nominees are vy
! ing are those of sophomore woman
j on Ex Committee and three places
, on Women's Council, to be filled by
juniors.
Instituted last spring, in response
I to the need for co-ordination of
| women's nominations, the committee
is being continued in the mid-year
elections as a result of the favorable
vote expressed in house meetings at
all women's living groups.
Answering general criticism di
| rected at the plan, Carolyn Hibbard,
I president of Women's Conference
| and chairman of the committee, last
night made the following statement:
"It was felt that the greater
smoothness and co-ordination of
women's elections last spring, as

compared with previous years, more
than justified its continuance in the
coming elections. If this procedure
again proves satisfactory it will also
be used for the spring elections, and,
in the meantime, this group would
welcome constructive criticism of a
project which is still in the embry
onic stage of development."
