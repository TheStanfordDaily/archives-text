A recognition are beginning to see
results. And now that the ball is
rolling, there is no point in putting
a sand trap in its path.
Ski Club is saying. "If the rifle
club gets Circle S awards, why
shouldn't we?" and despite strong
arguments con, the skiers have a
good case pro. Club leaders say
recognition would give skiing a sol
id footing toward continuance of
their activities in future years, and
this rebuttal is presented to over
balance the argument that winter
sports enthusiasts would continue to
join if only for reduced rates al
lowed members at nearby resorts.
Ski Club leaders do not state what
is in their minds, that they want
Circle S sweaters. Yet they are will
ing to bear all expense involved,
even the cost of the awards, as
projected in a signed statement giv
en by them to the 13.A.C.
But despite any contrast of pub
licized issues and suppressed mo
tives, Ski Club members are going
places for Stanford and deserve to
be recognized for their services.
'Hie newly appointed committee on
pTOinor sports does not need to inves
tigate deeply to see that skiers are
as worthy as anybody of Circle S
awards.

U. C. L. A.

bo distinctly the underdog in the

Stanford. Secondly, they feel a

|joxiN(; champs are seldom
attracted to Stanford, because I
the ambition of the men in Stan
hud rings is usually to learn what
there is to know about fighting
and stop at that. Hut Clayton
Frye, having taught Card fighters j
what they want to know for a
year now, has succeeded in devel- i
oping a set of good competitive
scrappers that will put Stanford
back on the boxing map.
We'll probably see results as the j

season opens
tonight in the
Pavilion against
the Cal Aggies.
When you con
sider that Frye
ha s developed
enough material
so that several

varsity boxers of last year were
defeated in the recent all-Univer
sity bouts, you can realize that
the Cards have depth as well as
strength.
At any rate, tonight's tourna
ment will be a series of hard
fought battles, and Stanford root
ers will find themselves repre
sented by a better group of light
ers than they have seen in some

Frye, having taught Card fighters j
what they want to know for a
year now, has succeeded in devel- i
oping a set of good competitive
scrappers that will put Stanford
back on the boxing map.
We'll probably see results as the j

season opens
tonight in the
Pavilion against
the Cal Aggies.
When you con
sider that Frye
ha s developed
enough material
so that several

varsity boxers of last year were
defeated in the recent all-Univer
sity bouts, you can realize that
the Cards have depth as well as
strength.
At any rate, tonight's tourna
ment will be a series of hard
fought battles, and Stanford root
ers will find themselves repre
sented by a better group of light
ers than they have seen in some
