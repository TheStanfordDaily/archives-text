# Davis Cup Trial Entries Filed
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 1 (UP). — A
total of 27 nations —from Cuba to
Yugoslavia—today filed entries for
this year's Davis Cup competition,
and the consensus was that all but
Australia might as well quit now
and save their money.
The list numbered three more
than last year, but they could add
another couple of dozen and the
odds still would favor Australia to
be the survivor which will meet the
United States in the challenge round.
Battle lines for the eliminations
will be drawn at 5 o'clock Friday
afternoon by the United States Lawn
Tennis Association.
