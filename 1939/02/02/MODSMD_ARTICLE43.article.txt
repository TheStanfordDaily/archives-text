j will be caught in the Farm's fleeting spotlight when it climbs into the
Pavilion ring and squares off with the tough leather-pushers from Cal
I Aggie.
Since the Aggies are known to Farm fight fans of past years as one
of the strongest bunches of boys the local boxers have to meet everv

year .tonight's fights will have just*
the shadow of revenge about them,
and promise to be full of fight. The
boys over in the southwest corner
of Eneina Gym are getting a little
tired of being dumped every year
by Cal Aggies.
Well into his second year of
coaching a Farm boxing team,
Coach Clayton Frye has brought up
a better trained, better conditioned
group of boys this year.

the ring tonight than he did a year
ago.

Coach Clayton Frye has brought up
a better trained, better conditioned
group of boys this year.
He's sending a tougher team into
the ring tonight than he did a year
ago.
Opening Stanford's intercollegiate
schedule, tonight's matches will be
open to the public. Free to activity
card holders, they will cost the pub
lic at large 55 cents.
One of the best bouts this eve
ning is due when Herb Gunn faces
Dees Youdall, Pacific Coast cham
pion for the Aggies last year in the
165-lb. class. Gunn is a senior, but
this will be his first appearance,
since he dropped out of competition
last season because of a hand in
jury-
In the heavyweight match, John
ny Ward will box with Walt Wat
son. Hal Saunders, who was ex
pected to fight in the light-heavy
class, has been forced out of this
tourney with a bad thumb, so Bill
Greer will meet Lindgren of the Ag
gies in his place. Greer was a win- !
ner in the recent all-U tournament, j
In a second l(!5-lb. bout, the Card !
team will send Stein against Put- i
nam.
Doug Grant is now fully recov- j
ered from an illness that kept him j
out of last month's tourney, and he |
will see action tonight against Hil- j
mar Ingelbretson. The balance of j
the program will see Wilber and j
Rice against Sevier and Nicholson,
Wilson vs. Perry, and Berg vs. !
Moore.
Tonight at 8 o'clock Stanford's strongest boxing team in many years
j will be caught in the Farm's fleeting spotlight when it climbs into the
Pavilion ring and squares off with the tough leather-pushers from Cal
I Aggie.
Since the Aggies are known to Farm fight fans of past years as one
of the strongest bunches of boys the local boxers have to meet everv

year .tonight's fights will have just*
the shadow of revenge about them,
and promise to be full of fight. The
boys over in the southwest corner
of Eneina Gym are getting a little
tired of being dumped every year
by Cal Aggies.
Well into his second year of
