Competing with basketball for the
spotlight in intramural sports is the
handball tournament, just getting
under way. According to the toui'-
narqent manager, Myron Sprague, all
teams entered should check the in
tramural bulletin board for their first
round opponents and play them off
by the end of this week. Games can
be played in Encina Gym and the

What was expected to be a close
contest between Phi Delt and A.T.O.
developed into a lopsided A.T.O. vic
tory. Due to the sizzling floor shots
of Kai Larson and Bob Koch, who
got 13 and 12 points, respectively, the
A.T.O. decisively turned back their
opponents, 39-14. Bill Jackson was
high for the losing cause with 7
digits.
In another lopsided tilt, Chi Psi I
opened up on Phi Psi 11, downing
them 41-20. Three sharpshooters led
the scoring parade for Chi Psi, Jack
Read with 14, Bill Henley and A1
Whittel with 10.
In the only close game of the eve
ning, El Tigie defeated Sigma Nu
