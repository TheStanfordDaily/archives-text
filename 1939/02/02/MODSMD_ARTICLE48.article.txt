# Farm Swimmers Face Athens Club Saturday
## 
### 
Like a two-ring circus, the pro
gram of aquatic events scheduled on
the Farm this week-end features
the Frosh versus San Francisco
State on Friday, and the varsity
against the Athens Club Saturday
in the conference opener for both
Cardinal teams.
Friday at 3 o'clock, the general
public is invited to watch the fa
vored frosh hopefuls vie with the
as yet untried visitors, in a meet in
which the Papooses will be gunning
for six national collegiate freshman
swimming records.
Feature of .the afternoon will be
the grudge match between Fresh
man Captain Paul Herron, and
highly-touted Henry Paris, favorite
of the San Francisco sports writers.
Last year the two met four times,
splitting honors evenly. Herron
took the junior national 500-yard
title, with Paris second, and re

peated in the Far Western 200- i
meter race.
Paris retaliated in the latter meet |
1 by passing Herron in the stretch to !
win first honors, and evened the j
count a week later in a special
400-meter duel.
Friday, the pair will probably be '
i matched in the 220-yard race. The
pace will be hot, and it is consid
ered sure that the winning time
will be several seconds faster than j
the national frosh record currently
! held by John Jacques of the U. S. i
Naval Academy.
! Other "sure bet" record breaking
j performances expected in the frosh
| meet are Jim Canning's 150 back
-1 stroke time; Scott Dudlej' in the
| breast stroke ,and the Papoose 300- |
i yard medley relay swim.
