## Weather Keeps Cards, Foes from Practice

It was just another day of wet
ground yesterday as far as the var
sity horsehide men were concerned.
The scheduled game with San Jose
State got a rather watery scratch,
resulting in the turnout of only
hurlers and backstop men who
talked through short workouts in
the pitching shed.
More sad news followed late yes
terday evening in the form of apol
ogetic word received from the Ath
ens Athletic Club to the effect that
their strong nine would not be able
to show for this week's proposed
swingo-bingo battle at Stanford.
"Wet and possibly frosted ground
will hamper practice for the next
two days," said Coach Harry Wol
ter. "We will have to work doubly
hard to offset this hindrance before
next Saturday's game with the Ken
nealey Seals of San Francisco. They
have a flashy team composed of
semi-professional leaguers which
will offer strong practice opposition.
In this Seals game I plan to use
only two batteries, Lazzaroni and
Jamieson, Thompson and Temple
ton, instead of the past game four
battery spread.
"This active staff reduction is a
step toward definite l ines which
will be needed on February 11, in
the first conference battle of the
season against Santa Clara. The
game will be played at Santa Clara."
