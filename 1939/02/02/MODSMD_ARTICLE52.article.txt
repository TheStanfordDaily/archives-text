# Ski in the Circle
## 
### 
A FEW years back they passed laws to
put lame ducks out to pasture. Somehow,
they never looked at The Daily, so this lame
duck edition hobbles through the traditional
nail-biting issue between elections and the last
sob-editorial.
Ex Committee Tuesday night did some hob
bling too; they were fettered and bound by a
gooey morass of precedent and confused tra
dition when Ski Club came on their annual
trek after minor sport recognition.
Ex Committee teetered on the edge of grant
ing Ski Club's request, but remembering last
year's diplomatic catastrophe, and wishing to
check with minor sports director Harry Malo
ney, it took the wiser course and held decision
over until next meeting.
But objections to the activity, pertinent last
year, now appear more reactionary than valid.
Skiing has proved itself, not as a passing fad,
but as an activity serious enough to have a
dry ski course, gym workouts for team mem
bers, powerful club membership, outstanding
competitive records. Unless California turns
tropical, skiing is here to stay.
It was once called an undemocratic sport,
on the assumption that expense involved made
it a closed corporation to most of the campus.
And yet it persists in attracting more partici
pants than almost any other so-called "demo
cratic" activity at Stanford, activities which
ask nothing but time and effort? It may buy its
way into democratic standing, but on the basis
of campus support it can laugh in the face of
its simon-pure fellow sports.
With an impressive array of honors in inter
collegiate ski meets, with an award for top
participation in the Nevada Winter Carnival,
Stanford's skimen will do no discredit to the
minor letter if they wear it. They are accom
plished performers in their sport. If that is the
basis for awarding letters — and brawn-men
say it is—they deserve recognition.
Only the question of supervision remains to
be dealt with. The problem is one which in
terests faculty directors; to fit in consistently
with the campus activity picture skiing must
give this last obstacle to recognition some con
structive thought.
But when the question is ironed out, Ski Club
and ski team members should Christie into
the Circle "S" picture with as much right as
any other University sport.

way into democratic standing, but on the basis
of campus support it can laugh in the face of
its simon-pure fellow sports.
With an impressive array of honors in inter
collegiate ski meets, with an award for top
participation in the Nevada Winter Carnival,
Stanford's skimen will do no discredit to the
minor letter if they wear it. They are accom
plished performers in their sport. If that is the
basis for awarding letters — and brawn-men
say it is—they deserve recognition.
Only the question of supervision remains to
be dealt with. The problem is one which in
terests faculty directors; to fit in consistently
with the campus activity picture skiing must
give this last obstacle to recognition some con
structive thought.
But when the question is ironed out, Ski Club
and ski team members should Christie into
the Circle "S" picture with as much right as
any other University sport.
A FEW years back they passed laws to
put lame ducks out to pasture. Somehow,
they never looked at The Daily, so this lame
duck edition hobbles through the traditional
nail-biting issue between elections and the last
sob-editorial.
Ex Committee Tuesday night did some hob
bling too; they were fettered and bound by a
gooey morass of precedent and confused tra
dition when Ski Club came on their annual
trek after minor sport recognition.
Ex Committee teetered on the edge of grant
ing Ski Club's request, but remembering last
year's diplomatic catastrophe, and wishing to
check with minor sports director Harry Malo
ney, it took the wiser course and held decision
over until next meeting.
But objections to the activity, pertinent last
year, now appear more reactionary than valid.
Skiing has proved itself, not as a passing fad,
but as an activity serious enough to have a
dry ski course, gym workouts for team mem
bers, powerful club membership, outstanding
competitive records. Unless California turns
tropical, skiing is here to stay.
It was once called an undemocratic sport,
on the assumption that expense involved made
it a closed corporation to most of the campus.
And yet it persists in attracting more partici
pants than almost any other so-called "demo
cratic" activity at Stanford, activities which
ask nothing but time and effort? It may buy its
way into democratic standing, but on the basis
of campus support it can laugh in the face of
its simon-pure fellow sports.
