# No Bedtime Story

IN the "Stanford Fund Bulletin" which today
is being sent to all alumni, later will be in
the hands of seniors, is a tidy little story which
runs something like this:
Two Stanford physicists working on a prob
lem in atomic structure, after building appa
ratus which proved inadequate, hit an impasse
in their research when $3,000 to provide radium
needed for experimental use was lacking.
There were no University funds available for
the important work.
And so the two men went to California where
equipment was generously turned over to them.
Now they make regular trips to Berkeley, hot
on a trail which may soon make important ad
ditions to physics.
And if they do, the University of California
will share the credit which, for $3,000, might
have belonged entirely to Stanford and to
Stanford's men.
The little story in the Fund Bulletin ends
with a mention of annual fund drive for Uni
versity money. But the appeal could just as
well have been omitted after the yarn was
spun.
The point is too obvious.
