RIGHT now, The Daily is under fire for not
leading a Stanford movement to wrestle
with social, economic, and political problems
outside its gate.
The arguments are pat, all right: the ugly
problems are there, we will be up against them
later; The Daily should take the lash to Stan
ford, wake it up. The theory is fine.
Only I remember early this volume when
the conference of Munich was hanging fire.
The Daily took it all in with the rest of the
world, bit its nails, dragged out 2-inch type,
clipped U.P. releases like a thing possessed.
We led a campus movement to look with
wide eyes at the world panorama. And like
the rest of the campus, the rest of the world,
we led with our chins.

We were sold down the river because (1)
press releases were apparently only part of
a diplomatic finesse which caught everyone
but Hitler napping; and (2) we had no way
of checking or estimating the validity of those
facts.
That's the way it goes. Neither The Daily,
nor anyone else below a 180-unit rating in the
Bawlout, it fitted to grapple with problems of
world or nation-wide import. Our facts are
shaky, our background inadequate.
We can stick our necks out, but that's all;
we wouldn't kick too much about the bat on
the button we get if only we learned some
thing, if Stanford knew any more about the
world than before.
But we don't. We just get tagged, cheered
by the knowledge that once again, The Daily
was wrong.
