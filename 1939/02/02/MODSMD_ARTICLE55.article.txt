# BULL SESSION
## SPECIAL TO MARTYRS

YY/HATEVER may be the drawbacks of socially-con
scious young intellectuals, they are certainly not
intellectuals. Stanford's reformer pack has been mak
ing more noise than a Senate committee, ever since
last Tuesday when I suggested that our undergradu
ates were well adjusted in their take-it-or-leave-it
alone attitude toward social problems.
One of the more prominent apostles of the worry
about-the-world movement snagged me on the Eng
lish Corner yesterday and gave me ten minutes of
patient instruction, with the air of a missionary ex
plaining the holy trinity to an unusually benighted
savage. Stanford, he said, is letting its mind idle in
neutral. We are blinding ourselves to reality. We are
dancing on a volcano.

It might be well to point out here that if we have
homesteaded a volcano, there is no reason why we
shouldn't dance on it. In fact, dancing is about the
only thing that is worth doing on a volcano. Cer
tainly worrying won't stop the pay-off, and reinforced
trouser seats will be inadequate.
But the volcano question is really beside the point.
The problem is whether or not Stanford students are
justified in their casual attitude toward social issues.
The reformers say that we are babes in the woods,
that shortly we will be eaten by the wolves. There
is some dispute as to the nature of the wolves, the
odds being the same for communists and fascists. But
all the young intellectuals agree that our undergrad
uates are destined to be blue-plate specials.

J>ERSONALLY, I think Stanford is preparing itself
very well for the wolf menace. We do not ignore
social problems. We are not training ourselves to
turn the guns on the masses. And we do not rate the
sight of poverty as good light entertainment.
We are trying to study the problems of society as
objectively as possible. We hope that somewhere in
the curriculum we can fmd information that will help
us to view social problems as a pattern of cause and
effect and not just as a damn shame. Until we get
that knowledge, or at least satisfy ourselves that it is
not to be found, we are reluctant to go riding forth
on a white horse to redress the wrongs of civilization.

In the old days, reform was fairly simple. If there
was a dragon annoying the villagers, the thing for a
self-respecting knight was to knock oft the dragon.
But today our trouble comes from involved economic
and sociological maladjustments, and the old dragon
hunting technique won't work.
The average Stanford student wants to study the
problems objectively before he starts fighting anybody
about them. He doesn't see any reason why he should
get his teeth kicked in, either figuratively or literally,
unless he can be sure he is doing some good. He gets
no satisfaction out of being a martyr.
And so he keeps out of the fight, and in the mean
time he avoids taking himself too seriously. He tries
to enjoy himself because he doesn't see why the
existence of misery means that he must be miserable.
The young intellectuals are marvelously martyr
material, but somehow I don't think they will do any
better with the wolves than we will.
