### DOUG JAQUES 
PENGUIN
She is back on the campus for the first time in
about six months, and being a friend of mine, I know
she won't mind my saying these things about her.
Even if I should exaggerate here and there.
Among other things, she has the essence of Penguin
about her.
At first she just laughed when people started tell
ing her this. "What is this, double talk?" she would
say.
Then when she saw people were being serious about
it, she began to wonder what was this essence of
Penguin stufT.
She went to the zoo—which reminded her of a
story she had heard once about an elephant and a
giraffe or a monkey or something—and took a look at
the Penguins. She found, with a little practice, that
she could walk like a Penguin. But that was just
when she tried. She is not vain, but my God, do I
look like that, she said.
She hadn't found out anything by going to the 7.00.
She tried reading "Penguin Island." It made her
laugh very hard sometimes, but it didn't help her
any. She still didn't know why people called her a
little Penguin.'
For the hundredth time she went to her friends.
"How are you I feel fine," she said. "Why do you call
me a Penguin?"
They couldn't tell her.
When I saw her for the first time in six months,
she said, "How are you I feel fine why do you call
me a Penguin?"
She can't understand that she simply has the es
sence of Penguin about her. That's all there is to it.
PLATO
A couple of frosh football players were talking.
One was very discouraged. "Gee, I'm getting rot
ten grades," he said.
"Oh, well," the other one said philosophically, "if
you can stick around for four years without rolling
out, you'll learn something."

For some time I have thought that I really should
do a fine thing for a piece of copy paper
After the way I besmirch pieces of copy paper
over here every day with this and that.
The finest tribute that I can give a piece of
copy paper. I believe.
Is that when I first put it in my typewriter, it is
Quite

The finest tribute that I can give a piece of
copy paper. I believe.
Is that when I first put it in my typewriter, it is
Quite
White.
PENGUIN
She is back on the campus for the first time in
about six months, and being a friend of mine, I know
she won't mind my saying these things about her.
Even if I should exaggerate here and there.
Among other things, she has the essence of Penguin
about her.
At first she just laughed when people started tell
ing her this. "What is this, double talk?" she would
say.
Then when she saw people were being serious about
it, she began to wonder what was this essence of
Penguin stufT.
She went to the zoo—which reminded her of a
story she had heard once about an elephant and a
giraffe or a monkey or something—and took a look at
the Penguins. She found, with a little practice, that
she could walk like a Penguin. But that was just
when she tried. She is not vain, but my God, do I
look like that, she said.
She hadn't found out anything by going to the 7.00.
She tried reading "Penguin Island." It made her
laugh very hard sometimes, but it didn't help her
any. She still didn't know why people called her a
little Penguin.'
For the hundredth time she went to her friends.
"How are you I feel fine," she said. "Why do you call
me a Penguin?"
They couldn't tell her.
When I saw her for the first time in six months,
she said, "How are you I feel fine why do you call
me a Penguin?"
She can't understand that she simply has the es
sence of Penguin about her. That's all there is to it.
PLATO
A couple of frosh football players were talking.
One was very discouraged. "Gee, I'm getting rot
ten grades," he said.
"Oh, well," the other one said philosophically, "if
you can stick around for four years without rolling
out, you'll learn something."

For some time I have thought that I really should
do a fine thing for a piece of copy paper
After the way I besmirch pieces of copy paper
over here every day with this and that.
