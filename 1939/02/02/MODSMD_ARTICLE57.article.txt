CORDS' TALENTS WASTED?

The Editor, Sir:
Last week I had a conversation
with John Cobbs very similar to
the one he described in his column
of Monday, January 31. He told me
today I am included in his general
iisation, so I have to defend myself,
being socially conscious — and very
grateful for being that way.
First of all: I like John Cobbs as
a person, but I don't like columnists
on principle. They usually fill white
space with the most insignificant
things. Why don't they write only
when they have really something to
say? Bui maybe that happens too
.seldom.
Cobbs' column is wrongly called
"Bull Session''; as far as I know you
need more than one foi a bull ses
sion, but John goes on keeping his
ostrich monologue, without ever be
ing interrupted. This time, however,
he is going to see some objections.
SCOPE LIMITED
I think "Bull Session" i.; extremely
j rovincial, its scopt; is too much
limited. After all, Stai ford is such
a small seeiuded part of humanity.
John Cobb> should realize that there
is something at the other end of
Palm Drive, too. In the ears of a
convinced internationalist the ideas
expressed in Monday's column
sound veiy narrow minded. John
seems to forget that we live on a
huge phenomenon called "earth,"
and that there are millions of hu
man beings .suffering on its surface.
The thing that gets me is that
John Cobhs could use his capaci
ties *'cr so much purposes;
we need men like him *c make this
campus a little more interested in
the misery of their fellow men. He
knows better, for he says, "Perhaps
t:iy friend is right."
How can he go on, then, writing
"light ptufl," as he calls it, knowing
that it won't Ho any good? What is
the u 4 ' of trying to amuse the cam
pus with smooth wr;tjng — giving
them what they want — when the
world is burning on all .sides, when
we have to choose between the last
hit left of civilization and complete
barbarism, when fascism is notice
able all over America theady?
DISILLUSIONING
Cobbs' ctlumn admitted frankly
the indifference of the Stanford
students. "We decide to enjoy things
while we can," he says. They are
dancing on a volcano! And I can't
see how they can do it with any
conscience left! Cobbs' attitude is
the same as that expressed in those
remarkable words of Commodore
Vanderbilt: "Hell, hain't I got the
power—the public be damned," on
ly substitute "checks from home, and
girl- or boy-friends" for "power"
and it fits perfectly for the majority
of Stanford students. This is ex
tremely disillusioning.
Cobbs states, "We are sensible
enough not to make ourselves mis
erable over something we can't
help." The fact is that very much
CAN be helped if people like John
Cobbs and the group he stands for
shake of! their apathy, start ob
serving what happens around them,
and act. And they'll know what
needs to be done after they have
drawn conclusions from the facts
they saw.
College students are as respon
sible for the problems of the world
as anybody else; that means they
should co-operate to find a solution
for them, just because they happen
to be living in that world also. We
don t "howl," but the "howling"
comes from the New York slums,
from the Dutch farm workers, from
the Valley, from Spain, from China,
and from numerous other places.
And we hear it, don't you? It
should haunt everybody day and
night!
I would like to say more, but this
is enough for now. I want to close
with a very strange statement of
Cobbs. Here it is in all its beauty:

"Only the unhappy and/or unsuc
cessful students can get sufficiently
wrought up about the problems of
the world to qualify as really so
cially conscious."
I challenge John Cobbs and, for
that matter, the people who consider
him their loudspeaker, to prove
that! I am very happy, except that
I feel unhappy about Cobbs' fighting
for an unworthy cause and things
like that. I leave it to him to decide
whether I am successful or not. And
I would like him to cite examples of
1 is statement. I wish him good luck
in his investigation.
By the way, has anybody ever
noticed that large inscription in the
library of the Education Building,
saying: "Be ashamed to die until
you have won some victory for hu
manity"? It seems to be so out of
place at a campus where columns as
John Cobbs' are written, don't you
think? *
