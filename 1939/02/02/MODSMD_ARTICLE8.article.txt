# Luncheon Club Hears Dr, Chan
## Chinese Proverbs Applied to Life 
### 
Dr. Shau Wing Chan, instructor i
of Chinese language and literature,
spoke to an unusually large meeting
of the Luncheon Club yesterday
noon on "Chinese Proverbs."
"Probably you have been told j
that China is the place where any ;
person above a certain age speaks |
in proverbs," said Dr. Chan. "This j
Is half truth and half exaggeration i
â€”he does know many proverbs and !
applies them to problems of life, j
but he certainly doesn't speak in j
them."
"China's proverbs, like those of j
other countries, have their origin in 1
the lives of the people. They are
mostly clothed in simple and naive j
language; some are rhymcless, oth- l
ers are rhymed. They are very
brief; for instance, one that is trans- I
lated 'what, a child does at three i
years of age will forecast has con
duct. at eight years of age,' is only
five words long in Chinese."
As to reasons for the existence of j
so many proverbs, Dr. Chan said, j
"The peculiar structure of the Chi- '
nese language makes it especially j
suitable to pithy expressions. The '
existence of long tradition and the !
veneration of the people for the past!
is important, therefore, what Con- I
fucius said during his life is still on
the lips of the Chinese of today."
Dr. Chan attempted to acquaint !
the audience with Chinese proverbs j
by giving examples, using his own i
translations, of sayings dealing with
the various aspects of life, namely:
the family, veneration for the aged,
advice for fathers not to be too
anxious for children, the relation
ship of brothers, the female sex, and !
miscellaneous proverbs containing j
rules for personal conduct in every- J
day life.
