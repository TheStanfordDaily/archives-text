New Spring models in striped
30
There's something about Covert Cloth that appeals to
the red corpuscles in a man's blood. The smart non
chalance of its drape . . . the touch of sleekness to its
smooth, hard-nnished weave . . . the way the darn stuff
tailors . . . these things give a suit what you might call
Um-m-mph! And Covert Cloth will go through the
wringer with you . . . take the wear and tear of life like
no other woolen you can name. These suits, with their
smart double-breasted cut, are the "convertible coupe"
models of the Castlerock "30" line ... a mighty swell
investment at $30.
