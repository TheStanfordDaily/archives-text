### LARRY LIVINCSTON 
VjT/iriLE Stanford's socially con
scious elect battles with that old
hedonist, John Cobbs, over whether
we should spend our time worrying
about the world's woes or forget
them for the four dizzy years we
call college, History—l 939 plods on.
The world has a way of going about
its business despite the menace of
Fascism, the Spanish Civil War, or
the end of a Daily volume.
Since early last fall when Ger
many figuratively caught the pow
ers of Europe with their pants down
and literally seized a large chunk
of Czechoslovakia, history has been
written in terms of a race between
the Fascist and the Democratic na
tions. Just what the goal of the
contest is, just where the race will
end has been the topic of countless
minor-league prophets during the
past five months.
* *
HPHE funny part of it all is that
nobody knows what he is talk
••it. Centuries have proved
.no folly of making predictions.
It seems to be a natural function,
somewhat akin to breathing, this
business of making out a dope
?.heet for history.
If, within the Stanford gold-fish
bowl, a small proportion of the stu
dents pause momentarily to glance
outside at the ugly world, the so
cially-conscious ones should feel
that they have not lived in vain.
After all, weeping over the fate of
the Jews in Germany or the migra
tory workers won't do anybody any
good; mere words won't stop the ad
vance of Fascism.
What this University can do is to
produce well rounded men, level
headed thinkers who will some day
do something constructive toward
actually solving the problems of the
world.
JN WASHINGTON yesterday
members of the House added
their voices to (he chorus of pro
test that has been raised against
President Roosevelt's secret sale
of warplanes to France and his de
clared policy in favor of the dem
ocratic powers of Europe.
Nine opponents of the Adminis
tration insisted that, the chief ex
ecutive has no right to take sides
in the international struggle with
out giving the people a voice in de
termining the policy which may
lead them into war. Always on the
alert to bait Roosevelt on any move
out-of-line he may make, the pro
testing Republicans threaten to
hold up the President's defense bill
if he does not submit his "unneutral
acts" for approval by the Congress.
m « *
HPHE Fascist nations are still fum
ing over Roosevelt's undiplo
matic remark that the first frontier
of the United States' defense lies in
France. Both the Italian and Ger
man presses are filled with open de
nunciations of the President of the
United States.
They claim that Roosevelt is fry
ing of start a war and cife Herbert
Hoover's speech Wednesday as ev
idence that the American people
are opposed to fhe new executive
policy. France and England her
ald fhe statement as significant of
a definite Paris-London-Washing
fon line-up against the Rome-Ber
lin axis.
However, the President has de
nied that he ever made such a
statement; so Europe is getting ex
cited about something that never
happened. Roosevelt, may not have
talked about an American frontier
on the Rhine, but he did declare
his support for the anti-Fascist
cause, and that's something for the
boys over there to start thinking
about.
JJACK to the President for his
signature came the relief bill he
presented to Congress at the be
ginning of this session. $150,000,000
has been lopped off his original pro
positi to spend $875,000,000 to solve
the nation's unemployment prob
lem, and a host of restrictions
against use of the money for po
litical purposes has been added.

Hoover's speech Wednesday as ev
idence that the American people
are opposed to fhe new executive
policy. France and England her
ald fhe statement as significant of
a definite Paris-London-Washing
fon line-up against the Rome-Ber
lin axis.
However, the President has de
nied that he ever made such a
statement; so Europe is getting ex
cited about something that never
happened. Roosevelt, may not have
talked about an American frontier
on the Rhine, but he did declare
his support for the anti-Fascist
cause, and that's something for the
boys over there to start thinking
about.
JJACK to the President for his
signature came the relief bill he
presented to Congress at the be
ginning of this session. $150,000,000
has been lopped off his original pro
positi to spend $875,000,000 to solve
the nation's unemployment prob
lem, and a host of restrictions
against use of the money for po
litical purposes has been added.
