# Curd Hoopmen, Uclans Clash
## Bruins Point toward Upset; Indians Seek Two Cage Wins Over Week-end 
### WILSON CANNON FRANK GUTHRIE 
Stanford, for three years the symbol of might in the Southern Divi
sion basketball conference, and U.C.L.A., for the nth year the outstand
ing sj mbol of weakness, clash in a pair of games at 8 o'clock tonight and
tomorrow in the Pavilion.
However, since the graduation of Hank LuisHii <».«.

• "Laughing Boys," the Indians have
fallen from their high pedestal. The
same is true with the Bruins, who
have held down the cellar cham
pionship so many years straight that
observers figure that "this is their
year," if they're ever to have one.
And with the high-flying Bears
and the contending Trojans waging
a duel for first place honors in the
conference plus the right to enter
the coast division play-offs, Coach
Caddy Works is concentrating his
fireworks against the Indians this
week-end in hopes that his Bruins
can sneak past Everelt Dean's squad
and into third place in the confer
ence rating.
BRUINS SEEK UPSET
The Bruins, now only one game
behind Stanford in the race for
Southern Division honors, have been
working enthusiastically in an at
tempt to polish their offensive and
defensive play until it reaches a
luster as bright as the polish on the
Stanford Pavilion floor.
As far as scoring power is con
cerned, the southern invaders are
not worrying. Ace Calkins, Cros
san Hays, and Wcldio, their big guns
on offense, showed their basket
making ability in the second canto
of the U.S.C. fracas, pulling the
Bruins from nowhere up to three
points behind the Trojans.
UCLANSRAGGED
But in past performances this
season, the floor play and under
basket work of the U.C.LA. squad
has been enough to put gray hairs
on Caddy Works' head. If the
'Bruins have smoothed up a bit, the
gray locks may be transferred to
Everett Dean's cranium.
For victory in the week-end
games jolly well means as much or
more to the Indians as it does to the
! Bruins. Two games behind the
j Trojans for second-place honors, the
I Indians can pull themselves into
j the upper bracket by spanking
U.C.L.A. in both appearances this
week-end.
TURNING POINT
If the might of Cardinal suprem
acy over coast basketball has a
chance to make itself apparent this
season, tonight and tomorrow night
must find the Indian squad in fine
fettle. A pair of decisive victories
might dot the "i"s and cross the
"t"s in "turning point."
Truly enough the Stanford ma
chine has been perking up af bite.
Festivities over last week-end
showed that Coach Dean has been
spending his odd moments filing the
rough edges from a crop of second
stringers, and the results made side
line spectators gasp.
