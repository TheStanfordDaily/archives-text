WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 (UP).— 1
The United States today emerged
; victorious in an international race j
to establish trans- Atlantic plane
service when Great Britain gave
Pan American Airways permission
! to inaugurate service in advance of
British Imperial Airways.
The concession was announced by
I
the State Department, which said
' Britain, by inference, had granted'
permission for American airliners to !
land in England, a right which here- i
tofore had been denied because the j
United States refuses to allow Brit- |
ish around-the-world planes to land i
in Hawaii.
Although State Department ofli- |
cials would not comment, it is be- !
lieved the recently announced
Franco-American agreement, under
which France gave American Air
j lines permission to land on French
territory, acted as a "squeeze" which
induced Britain's acquiescence.
The British concession was made
after inquiries by the American em
| bassy whether Imperial Airways is
prepared to begin scheduled service
to the United States this spring, and
whether there are objections to this
j country beginning such service.
