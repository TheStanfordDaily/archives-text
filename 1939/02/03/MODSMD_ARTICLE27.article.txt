### JOHN SHALLENBERGER 
SEVENTY issues of The Stanford Daily, the same fingers have j
dealt hand after hand of Sideline Slants—and today they deal a black- i
jack. As a new sports editor takes the deck, the retiring dealer looks
through the pages of Volume 94 and hopes that he and his staff have }
succeeded in bringing Daily readers accurate, unbiased, and readable !
accounts of Stanford sports.
Personal feelings of a lame duck .sports ed probably do not deserve •
space where heretofore opinion held precedence over motion. But I sin- i
cerely feel that if my efforts have made a contribution that is within
stone's throw of my gain from holding the position I am about to leave,
I can lull in the joy of achievement.
Stanford athletes, Stanford coaches, B.A.C. officials, and members of
the Daily edit board and staff are as fine associates as I hope ever to i

enjoy. And as for the sports staff
itself, I am sure no sports editor
has ever had the pleasure of work
ing with a better group of men.
You can't write sports unless you
have played them, and unusually
extensive experience of the 15
Gentlemen of Page 3 in athletics has
helped a great deal in fitting them
for brilliant comment on Stanford
sports. Close acquaintance with 15
"good eggs" has been well worth
what few gray hairs (or lack of
them) they have given me.
When Arch Jenkins takes the
helm next Monday, he'll have
practically the same staff to pound

out the columns. Jenkins lias done a great deal of writing himself and
knows ahont ail there is to know ahout college sports. As captain of
a sea-worthy crew, he'll leave a wake that will make observers sit up
and take notice.

CHILES of Volume 94 record fourteen weeks of athletics well worth writ
ing about. Football scores were not always as comforting as the sta
tistics, but it .was not hard to find facts to warrant our boasting a fine
Big Red Machine. The only thing that could have made us prouder of
the Card varsity water polo team would have been the winning of the
Coast conference crown in that last overtime period with California. And
moderate success of soccer and polo teams made good copy.
What more could we ask than an underdog basketball team that
comes from behind and goes far beyond anybody's expectations. A
pair of victories this week-end, if the Cards are able to cope with
the Bruins' try-anything offense, will tie them for second place in
the conference, the "team that hadn't a chance." Prognosticators had
not figured on our new coach.
Already good reports are pouring in from the Sunken Diamond, and
the chances are that Stanford's largest baseball squad will be its best.
Meanwhile, Card swimmers are paddling around in anticipation of a
shot at a championship and racket-wielders show promise of turning in
a finer record that Stanford has seen in some time. Indian ruggers are
already going strong; boxers are off to a good start, fencers meet their
first test tonight; and gymnasts are making an unusually promising
performance.
Volume 95 may record the most successful track season since Dyer
and Eastman made history for Stanford in 1931. Five straight !).(i hun
dreds and a 20.5-second 220 guarantee Clyde Jeffrey's worth to the
Indian team. Paul Moore may become one of the nation's outstand
ing middle-distance men, will probably run the half in 1:50. John
Emanuel has returned, after a scare of heart trouble, to run the two
mile; Craig Williamson shows promise of some time running a sensa
tional 440; and an abundance of fine hurdlers should add plenty to
a handsome score.
Jjt >Jt j«t *
J>OSTEFJTY may be interested in the new status of the sports editor, as
adopted by Volume 94. For many years Daily big-wigs had realized
the responsibility of the sports head: jurisdiction of a fourth of each paper
and leadership of a large staff of writers; so they moved the sports editor
to edit board and raised the requirements to meet those of associate or
managing editors.
Although the new policy allows him to compete for the Daily edi
torship or to step into the managing editor's shoes, it may appear to
future > ports editors, as it did to me, that the position is an end in
itself. Writers more interested in sports than in journalism will find
they can get all the benefits of proceeding through the hierarchy of
staff offices, retain connection with sports, and finish in a major
position on the paper. And if they are definitely narrow in their
journalistic interests, they may feel, as I did .that the editorship,
with all its glory and future, would be somewhat of an anticlimax.
Already, newcomers to The Daily are hitching their wagons to the
sports editorship. They may not find themselves famous or veterans of
the newspaper game; but I can assure them—those really sincere in their
• sports enthusiasm—that their decision to treat the sports editorship as the
top of their field will prove to be the right one.

Dear Arch:
These letters are trite as hell. Best of luck.

CO MANY retiring sports editors have printed their thanks to those
k who have contributed to their columns that such expressions of grati
tude appear almost mechanical. Not because it is customary, but because
I owe them more than a little black

and white can ever tell, I want only
to mention in passing a few of
those whose co-operation I shall
never forget.
Don Liebendorfer has been
through The Daily mill from bot
tom to top, and he never tires of
helping bewildered sports writers.
Sideliners must often have felt, as
I feel now, that they should have
seen a great deal more of the good
natured gent whose loyalty to Stan
ford athletes is probably greater
than that of any other fan. A1 Mas
ters has always offered willing co
operation and has never let Daily
sports pages affect a pleasant smile.

Miss Du Prau and her aids at the B.A.C. deserve thanks for their re
markable patience in meeting the many desires of a journalistic parasite.
Tiny Thornhill anil his assistants, Ben Winkelnian, Bobby Grayson,
Jim Lawson, and Husky Hunt, have co-operated willingly in helping
us bring Daily readers inside dope on football. Their season was more
than successful in light of the circumstances, and no one can hon
estly question their right to fame.
My successor will find Everett De.in, his assistants, and Beeb Lee
giving him, as they gave me. the information he wants about the basket
ball situation. Thanks also to Dink Templet on, who has helped consid
erably with reports of an off-season sport.
Thanks to Harry Maloney for his help and for his appreciation of
what wc were able to give him. And to all the other coaches, Nort
Thornton. Clayton Frye. Ernst Brandsten, Harry Wolter, Eddie Twiggs,
Bones Hamilton, Ellwyn Bugge, Sherm Lockwood. Major Allen, Harry
Shipkey, and Myron Sprague, we owe gratitude words cannot describe.
Dick Stepp, Thad McCarty, and the Daily business staff have co
operated with unprecedented vigor in allowing us space for Page 3
sports. Night editors and their assistants, along with the edit board itself,
deserve our many thanks for their patient co-operation.
Tommy Thompson's cartoons have helped considerably in adding color
to Volume 94 sports pages and to this column. Thank you. Tommy, and
thank you. Bat, for your trouble in juggling the linotype to fit them in.
Thanks also to Gordy Frost, Warren Breed, Phil Klauber, and Walt
Peterson, sports editors before me whose advice and suggestions were
priceless.
Thanks, finally, to the finest sports staff with whom a man could want
to work and associate.
And now, someone is tapping me on Ihe shoulder. It is Arch
Jenkins, and he says it is his dance. The Stanford Daily was the
greatest jolly-up I have ever attended. *«nd I am beginning to miss it
already.

"good eggs" has been well worth
what few gray hairs (or lack of
them) they have given me.
When Arch Jenkins takes the

practically the same staff to pound

out the columns. Jenkins lias done a great deal of writing himself and

CHILES of Volume 94 record fourteen weeks of athletics well worth writ
ing about. Football scores were not always as comforting as the sta
tistics, but it .was not hard to find facts to warrant our boasting a fine
Big Red Machine. The only thing that could have made us prouder of
the Card varsity water polo team would have been the winning of the
Coast conference crown in that last overtime period with California. And
moderate success of soccer and polo teams made good copy.
What more could we ask than an underdog basketball team that
comes from behind and goes far beyond anybody's expectations. A
pair of victories this week-end, if the Cards are able to cope with
the Bruins' try-anything offense, will tie them for second place in
the conference, the "team that hadn't a chance." Prognosticators had
not figured on our new coach.
Already good reports are pouring in from the Sunken Diamond, and
the chances are that Stanford's largest baseball squad will be its best.
Meanwhile, Card swimmers are paddling around in anticipation of a
shot at a championship and racket-wielders show promise of turning in
a finer record that Stanford has seen in some time. Indian ruggers are
already going strong; boxers are off to a good start, fencers meet their
first test tonight; and gymnasts are making an unusually promising
performance.
Volume 95 may record the most successful track season since Dyer
and Eastman made history for Stanford in 1931. Five straight !).(i hun
dreds and a 20.5-second 220 guarantee Clyde Jeffrey's worth to the
Indian team. Paul Moore may become one of the nation's outstand
ing middle-distance men, will probably run the half in 1:50. John
Emanuel has returned, after a scare of heart trouble, to run the two
mile; Craig Williamson shows promise of some time running a sensa
tional 440; and an abundance of fine hurdlers should add plenty to
a handsome score.

J>OSTEFJTY may be interested in the new status of the sports editor, as
adopted by Volume 94. For many years Daily big-wigs had realized
the responsibility of the sports head: jurisdiction of a fourth of each paper
and leadership of a large staff of writers; so they moved the sports editor
to edit board and raised the requirements to meet those of associate or
managing editors.
Although the new policy allows him to compete for the Daily edi
torship or to step into the managing editor's shoes, it may appear to
future > ports editors, as it did to me, that the position is an end in
itself. Writers more interested in sports than in journalism will find
they can get all the benefits of proceeding through the hierarchy of
staff offices, retain connection with sports, and finish in a major
position on the paper. And if they are definitely narrow in their
journalistic interests, they may feel, as I did .that the editorship,
with all its glory and future, would be somewhat of an anticlimax.
Already, newcomers to The Daily are hitching their wagons to the
sports editorship. They may not find themselves famous or veterans of
the newspaper game; but I can assure them—those really sincere in their
• sports enthusiasm—that their decision to treat the sports editorship as the
top of their field will prove to be the right one.

Dear Arch:

CO MANY retiring sports editors have printed their thanks to those
k who have contributed to their columns that such expressions of grati
tude appear almost mechanical. Not because it is customary, but because
I owe them more than a little black

and white can ever tell, I want only
to mention in passing a few of
those whose co-operation I shall
never forget.
Don Liebendorfer has been
through The Daily mill from bot
tom to top, and he never tires of
helping bewildered sports writers.
Sideliners must often have felt, as
I feel now, that they should have
seen a great deal more of the good
natured gent whose loyalty to Stan
ford athletes is probably greater
than that of any other fan. A1 Mas
ters has always offered willing co
operation and has never let Daily
sports pages affect a pleasant smile.

Miss Du Prau and her aids at the B.A.C. deserve thanks for their re
markable patience in meeting the many desires of a journalistic parasite.
Tiny Thornhill anil his assistants, Ben Winkelnian, Bobby Grayson,
Jim Lawson, and Husky Hunt, have co-operated willingly in helping
us bring Daily readers inside dope on football. Their season was more
than successful in light of the circumstances, and no one can hon
estly question their right to fame.
My successor will find Everett De.in, his assistants, and Beeb Lee
giving him, as they gave me. the information he wants about the basket
ball situation. Thanks also to Dink Templet on, who has helped consid
erably with reports of an off-season sport.
Thanks to Harry Maloney for his help and for his appreciation of
what wc were able to give him. And to all the other coaches, Nort
Thornton. Clayton Frye. Ernst Brandsten, Harry Wolter, Eddie Twiggs,
Bones Hamilton, Ellwyn Bugge, Sherm Lockwood. Major Allen, Harry
Shipkey, and Myron Sprague, we owe gratitude words cannot describe.
Dick Stepp, Thad McCarty, and the Daily business staff have co
operated with unprecedented vigor in allowing us space for Page 3
sports. Night editors and their assistants, along with the edit board itself,
deserve our many thanks for their patient co-operation.
Tommy Thompson's cartoons have helped considerably in adding color
to Volume 94 sports pages and to this column. Thank you. Tommy, and
thank you. Bat, for your trouble in juggling the linotype to fit them in.
Thanks also to Gordy Frost, Warren Breed, Phil Klauber, and Walt
Peterson, sports editors before me whose advice and suggestions were
priceless.
Thanks, finally, to the finest sports staff with whom a man could want
to work and associate.
And now, someone is tapping me on Ihe shoulder. It is Arch
Jenkins, and he says it is his dance. The Stanford Daily was the
greatest jolly-up I have ever attended. *«nd I am beginning to miss it
already.


SEVENTY issues of The Stanford Daily, the same fingers have j
dealt hand after hand of Sideline Slants—and today they deal a black- i
jack. As a new sports editor takes the deck, the retiring dealer looks
through the pages of Volume 94 and hopes that he and his staff have }
succeeded in bringing Daily readers accurate, unbiased, and readable !
accounts of Stanford sports.
Personal feelings of a lame duck .sports ed probably do not deserve •
space where heretofore opinion held precedence over motion. But I sin- i
cerely feel that if my efforts have made a contribution that is within
stone's throw of my gain from holding the position I am about to leave,
I can lull in the joy of achievement.
Stanford athletes, Stanford coaches, B.A.C. officials, and members of
the Daily edit board and staff are as fine associates as I hope ever to i

enjoy. And as for the sports staff
itself, I am sure no sports editor
has ever had the pleasure of work
ing with a better group of men.

have played them, and unusually
extensive experience of the 15

helped a great deal in fitting them
for brilliant comment on Stanford
sports. Close acquaintance with 15

already going strong; boxers are off to a good start, fencers meet their

adopted by Volume 94. For many years Daily big-wigs had realized
the responsibility of the sports head: jurisdiction of a fourth of each paper
and leadership of a large staff of writers; so they moved the sports editor
to edit board and raised the requirements to meet those of associate or
managing editors.
Although the new policy allows him to compete for the Daily edi

itself. Writers more interested in sports than in journalism will find
they can get all the benefits of proceeding through the hierarchy of
staff offices, retain connection with sports, and finish in a major
position on the paper. And if they are definitely narrow in their
journalistic interests, they may feel, as I did .that the editorship,
with all its glory and future, would be somewhat of an anticlimax.
Already, newcomers to The Daily are hitching their wagons to the
sports editorship. They may not find themselves famous or veterans of
the newspaper game; but I can assure them—those really sincere in their

CO MANY retiring sports editors have printed their thanks to those
k who have contributed to their columns that such expressions of grati
tude appear almost mechanical. Not because it is customary, but because
I owe them more than a little black

and white can ever tell, I want only
to mention in passing a few of
those whose co-operation I shall
never forget.
Don Liebendorfer has been
through The Daily mill from bot
tom to top, and he never tires of
helping bewildered sports writers.
Sideliners must often have felt, as
I feel now, that they should have
seen a great deal more of the good
natured gent whose loyalty to Stan
ford athletes is probably greater
than that of any other fan. A1 Mas
ters has always offered willing co
operation and has never let Daily
sports pages affect a pleasant smile.

Miss Du Prau and her aids at the B.A.C. deserve thanks for their re
markable patience in meeting the many desires of a journalistic parasite.
Tiny Thornhill anil his assistants, Ben Winkelnian, Bobby Grayson,
Jim Lawson, and Husky Hunt, have co-operated willingly in helping
us bring Daily readers inside dope on football. Their season was more
than successful in light of the circumstances, and no one can hon
estly question their right to fame.
My successor will find Everett De.in, his assistants, and Beeb Lee
giving him, as they gave me. the information he wants about the basket
ball situation. Thanks also to Dink Templet on, who has helped consid
erably with reports of an off-season sport.
Thanks to Harry Maloney for his help and for his appreciation of
what wc were able to give him. And to all the other coaches, Nort
Thornton. Clayton Frye. Ernst Brandsten, Harry Wolter, Eddie Twiggs,
Bones Hamilton, Ellwyn Bugge, Sherm Lockwood. Major Allen, Harry
Shipkey, and Myron Sprague, we owe gratitude words cannot describe.
Dick Stepp, Thad McCarty, and the Daily business staff have co
operated with unprecedented vigor in allowing us space for Page 3
sports. Night editors and their assistants, along with the edit board itself,
deserve our many thanks for their patient co-operation.
Tommy Thompson's cartoons have helped considerably in adding color
to Volume 94 sports pages and to this column. Thank you. Tommy, and
thank you. Bat, for your trouble in juggling the linotype to fit them in.
Thanks also to Gordy Frost, Warren Breed, Phil Klauber, and Walt
Peterson, sports editors before me whose advice and suggestions were
priceless.
Thanks, finally, to the finest sports staff with whom a man could want
to work and associate.
And now, someone is tapping me on Ihe shoulder. It is Arch
Jenkins, and he says it is his dance. The Stanford Daily was the
greatest jolly-up I have ever attended. *«nd I am beginning to miss it
already.


SEVENTY issues of The Stanford Daily, the same fingers have j
dealt hand after hand of Sideline Slants—and today they deal a black- i
jack. As a new sports editor takes the deck, the retiring dealer looks
through the pages of Volume 94 and hopes that he and his staff have }
succeeded in bringing Daily readers accurate, unbiased, and readable !
accounts of Stanford sports.
Personal feelings of a lame duck .sports ed probably do not deserve •
space where heretofore opinion held precedence over motion. But I sin- i
cerely feel that if my efforts have made a contribution that is within
stone's throw of my gain from holding the position I am about to leave,
I can lull in the joy of achievement.
Stanford athletes, Stanford coaches, B.A.C. officials, and members of
the Daily edit board and staff are as fine associates as I hope ever to i

enjoy. And as for the sports staff
itself, I am sure no sports editor
has ever had the pleasure of work
ing with a better group of men.
You can't write sports unless you
have played them, and unusually
extensive experience of the 15
Gentlemen of Page 3 in athletics has
helped a great deal in fitting them
for brilliant comment on Stanford
sports. Close acquaintance with 15
"good eggs" has been well worth
what few gray hairs (or lack of
them) they have given me.
When Arch Jenkins takes the
helm next Monday, he'll have
practically the same staff to pound

out the columns. Jenkins lias done a great deal of writing himself and
knows ahont ail there is to know ahout college sports. As captain of
a sea-worthy crew, he'll leave a wake that will make observers sit up
and take notice.

CHILES of Volume 94 record fourteen weeks of athletics well worth writ

Big Red Machine. The only thing that could have made us prouder of
the Card varsity water polo team would have been the winning of the
Coast conference crown in that last overtime period with California. And
moderate success of soccer and polo teams made good copy.
What more could we ask than an underdog basketball team that
comes from behind and goes far beyond anybody's expectations. A

J>OSTEFJTY may be interested in the new status of the sports editor, as
adopted by Volume 94. For many years Daily big-wigs had realized
the responsibility of the sports head: jurisdiction of a fourth of each paper
and leadership of a large staff of writers; so they moved the sports editor
to edit board and raised the requirements to meet those of associate or
managing editors.
Although the new policy allows him to compete for the Daily edi
torship or to step into the managing editor's shoes, it may appear to
future > ports editors, as it did to me, that the position is an end in
itself. Writers more interested in sports than in journalism will find
they can get all the benefits of proceeding through the hierarchy of
staff offices, retain connection with sports, and finish in a major
position on the paper. And if they are definitely narrow in their
journalistic interests, they may feel, as I did .that the editorship,
with all its glory and future, would be somewhat of an anticlimax.
Already, newcomers to The Daily are hitching their wagons to the
sports editorship. They may not find themselves famous or veterans of
the newspaper game; but I can assure them—those really sincere in their
• sports enthusiasm—that their decision to treat the sports editorship as the
top of their field will prove to be the right one.

CO MANY retiring sports editors have printed their thanks to those
k who have contributed to their columns that such expressions of grati
tude appear almost mechanical. Not because it is customary, but because
I owe them more than a little black

and white can ever tell, I want only
to mention in passing a few of
those whose co-operation I shall
never forget.
Don Liebendorfer has been
through The Daily mill from bot
tom to top, and he never tires of
helping bewildered sports writers.
Sideliners must often have felt, as
I feel now, that they should have
seen a great deal more of the good
natured gent whose loyalty to Stan
ford athletes is probably greater
than that of any other fan. A1 Mas
ters has always offered willing co
operation and has never let Daily
sports pages affect a pleasant smile.

Miss Du Prau and her aids at the B.A.C. deserve thanks for their re
markable patience in meeting the many desires of a journalistic parasite.
Tiny Thornhill anil his assistants, Ben Winkelnian, Bobby Grayson,
Jim Lawson, and Husky Hunt, have co-operated willingly in helping
us bring Daily readers inside dope on football. Their season was more
than successful in light of the circumstances, and no one can hon
estly question their right to fame.
My successor will find Everett De.in, his assistants, and Beeb Lee
giving him, as they gave me. the information he wants about the basket
ball situation. Thanks also to Dink Templet on, who has helped consid
erably with reports of an off-season sport.
Thanks to Harry Maloney for his help and for his appreciation of
what wc were able to give him. And to all the other coaches, Nort
Thornton. Clayton Frye. Ernst Brandsten, Harry Wolter, Eddie Twiggs,
Bones Hamilton, Ellwyn Bugge, Sherm Lockwood. Major Allen, Harry
Shipkey, and Myron Sprague, we owe gratitude words cannot describe.
Dick Stepp, Thad McCarty, and the Daily business staff have co
operated with unprecedented vigor in allowing us space for Page 3
sports. Night editors and their assistants, along with the edit board itself,
deserve our many thanks for their patient co-operation.
Tommy Thompson's cartoons have helped considerably in adding color
to Volume 94 sports pages and to this column. Thank you. Tommy, and
thank you. Bat, for your trouble in juggling the linotype to fit them in.
Thanks also to Gordy Frost, Warren Breed, Phil Klauber, and Walt
Peterson, sports editors before me whose advice and suggestions were
priceless.
Thanks, finally, to the finest sports staff with whom a man could want
to work and associate.
And now, someone is tapping me on Ihe shoulder. It is Arch
Jenkins, and he says it is his dance. The Stanford Daily was the
greatest jolly-up I have ever attended. *«nd I am beginning to miss it
already.


SEVENTY issues of The Stanford Daily, the same fingers have j
dealt hand after hand of Sideline Slants—and today they deal a black- i
jack. As a new sports editor takes the deck, the retiring dealer looks
through the pages of Volume 94 and hopes that he and his staff have }
succeeded in bringing Daily readers accurate, unbiased, and readable !
accounts of Stanford sports.
Personal feelings of a lame duck .sports ed probably do not deserve •
space where heretofore opinion held precedence over motion. But I sin- i
cerely feel that if my efforts have made a contribution that is within
stone's throw of my gain from holding the position I am about to leave,
I can lull in the joy of achievement.
Stanford athletes, Stanford coaches, B.A.C. officials, and members of
the Daily edit board and staff are as fine associates as I hope ever to i

enjoy. And as for the sports staff
itself, I am sure no sports editor
has ever had the pleasure of work
ing with a better group of men.
You can't write sports unless you
have played them, and unusually
extensive experience of the 15
Gentlemen of Page 3 in athletics has
helped a great deal in fitting them
for brilliant comment on Stanford
sports. Close acquaintance with 15
"good eggs" has been well worth
what few gray hairs (or lack of
them) they have given me.
When Arch Jenkins takes the
helm next Monday, he'll have
practically the same staff to pound

out the columns. Jenkins lias done a great deal of writing himself and
knows ahont ail there is to know ahout college sports. As captain of
a sea-worthy crew, he'll leave a wake that will make observers sit up
and take notice.

CHILES of Volume 94 record fourteen weeks of athletics well worth writ
ing about. Football scores were not always as comforting as the sta
tistics, but it .was not hard to find facts to warrant our boasting a fine
Big Red Machine. The only thing that could have made us prouder of
the Card varsity water polo team would have been the winning of the
Coast conference crown in that last overtime period with California. And
moderate success of soccer and polo teams made good copy.
What more could we ask than an underdog basketball team that
comes from behind and goes far beyond anybody's expectations. A
pair of victories this week-end, if the Cards are able to cope with
the Bruins' try-anything offense, will tie them for second place in
the conference, the "team that hadn't a chance." Prognosticators had
not figured on our new coach.
Already good reports are pouring in from the Sunken Diamond, and
the chances are that Stanford's largest baseball squad will be its best.
Meanwhile, Card swimmers are paddling around in anticipation of a
shot at a championship and racket-wielders show promise of turning in
a finer record that Stanford has seen in some time. Indian ruggers are
already going strong; boxers are off to a good start, fencers meet their
first test tonight; and gymnasts are making an unusually promising
performance.
Volume 95 may record the most successful track season since Dyer
and Eastman made history for Stanford in 1931. Five straight !).(i hun
dreds and a 20.5-second 220 guarantee Clyde Jeffrey's worth to the
Indian team. Paul Moore may become one of the nation's outstand
ing middle-distance men, will probably run the half in 1:50. John
Emanuel has returned, after a scare of heart trouble, to run the two
mile; Craig Williamson shows promise of some time running a sensa
tional 440; and an abundance of fine hurdlers should add plenty to
a handsome score.
