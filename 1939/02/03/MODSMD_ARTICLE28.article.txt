## Yearling Cagers Tackle Visalia Freshmen Meet Mission Tomorrow; Coach 'Beeb' Lee to Scout Cal Cubs 
### JOHN SHALLENBEKGER, Sports Editor 
With the first of a three-game grudge series with Cal's Bear Cubs just
one week away, the Indian frosh hoopmcn hear down in a pair of week
end tilts with Visalia Junior College and Mission High School at
o'clock tonight and tomorrow in the Pavilion.
While not considering the Mission outfit too lightly, Coach 11. R.

(Beeb) Lee will nevertheless leaved
his yearling charges under the di
rection of Jack Calderwood tomor- \
row so that he will be able to take j
time out to scout personally the !
Bear frosh.
Since the Papooses' traditional j
rivals from across the bay have a !
tough assignment with Santa Clara's j
first-year outfit—one of the best in |
the Northern California ranks, the!
Cubs will be forced to the limit, |
which should make Lee's task of j
scouting much easier.
While the Card frosh coach is in !
Berkeley, it wouldn't surprise any
one it' Cal had a scout of its own in
the Pavilion for either one of this
week-end's games to watch the
freshmen's six man, nucleus per- j
form. If Stanford is not pressed to j
win either tilt, the club will prob
ably play under wraps in order
that the offense and defense which j
Lee plans to spring on the Bears j
will not be too easily detected.
Visalia is expected to give the j
freshmen the biggest argument of
the week-end series, although!
Mission High of San Francisco may
prove to be troublesome even
though the club is not a winning
outfit in the bay circuit.
Competition for the five-starting
yearling positions has simmered
down to six players who have been !
dividing the assignments and play
ing time among themselves along I
with two substitutes.
