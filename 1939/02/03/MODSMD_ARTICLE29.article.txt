# U.S.F. Ruggers To Test Cards
## 
### 
With a perfect batting average of \
wins behind them, the Farm var- !
sity ruggers swing into action to- j
morrow afternoon, attempting to!
stretch their win column to three 1
straight against the University of I
San Francisco squad at 2:30 o'clock. |
In the second set-to of the double- j
header, the Stanford "B" squad will
meet the U.S.F. frosh. Admission |
to both games will be free.
Starting for Maloney in the open
ing game will be approximately the |
same team that starred in the first J
two contests of the season. Pete Fay,
Jim Grubbs, and Dave Carnahan's'
educated toes are expected to fig- i
ure prominently in the scoring!
write-ups.
The "B" squad, which bowed in j
its season's opener to a surprisingly j
strong Menlo J. C. team, only to j
come back strong to hamstring the
University Club seconds, will enter j
the fray slight favorites to topple !
the invaders.
The varsity game will be broad- \
cast over nine coast stations for the !
benefit of stay-at-homers. Dodgers, J
explaining rugby intricacies, will be
distributed before the game.
