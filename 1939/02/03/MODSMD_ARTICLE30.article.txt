The Stanford fencing team will j
face one of its most important j
matches tonight when it competes in ;
the 1939 San Francisco Bay Divi
sion Championships of the Amateur j
Fencers League of America.
Stanford will be represented by a j
three-man team consisting of Herb |
Woolley, John Cooper, and Francis j
Bray. Woolley is the senior man on j
the team and considered to be the |
best of the three because of his ex- !
perience. Cooper is the sophomore [
member of the team, who has shown i
a great deal of skill so far this year, '
especially in the Cal match of the i
Heron Trophy Series held last :
quarter, when he helped win the I
match for Stanford by a close mar
gin. Bray is a junior who has been i
a dependable member of the team
all year. He won the third place on !
the team after a series of elimina
tion bouts.
