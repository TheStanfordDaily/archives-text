# Farm Natators in Double Bill Over Week-end
## Athens A.C. Opens Varsity Tank Season Tomorrow; Frosh Vie 
### 
With a double-feature scheduled
on the Farm's swimming bill over
the week-end, the varsity tankmen
will present their half of the pro
gram against the Athens Club squad
tomorrow at 2:30 o'clock previewed
this afternoon by the Papooses vs.
San Francisco State at 3 o'clock.
Both matches will be the confer
ence openers for the Farm squads.
Admission at both will be free.
The Athens Club, considered a
prospect for cellar spot in the con
ference at the opening of the sea
son, turned the tables against the
California varsity last week-end in
their first meet of the season.
SLIGHT FAVORITES
However, the Thornton-coached
Farm varsity will enter the pool
slight favorites, boasting a well
rounded squad that can be counted
upon in every event.
Highlights of the meet will be the
diving contest, in which Stanford's
Roy Winkelmann will meet Gregg
and Muha of the Athens Club; the
backstroke, in which Sophomore Bill
Weeden will be pitted against his
kid brother, Al; and the sprints, in
which Farm Speedster Roy Vitou
sek will race Bob Irvin, one of the
fastest free-stylers on the coast.
FROSH MEET
This afternoon in the 20-yard pool,
those sensational frosh will swing
into action against the State swim
mers, attempting to lower six na
tional collegiate freshman records.
Captain Paul Harron will fight it
out in the sprints with Henry Paris,
in a duel that will produce record
times. Scott Dudley is set on the
breaststroke title, while Jimmy Can
ning will be after the backstroke
mark.
The frosh 400-yard relay team,
according to Thornton, will smash
the former record, while the 300-
yard medley trio of Canning, Dud
ley and Young are figured to have
no trouble in clipping seconds from
the current national mark.
