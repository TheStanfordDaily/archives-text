THAT doesn't make much sense. You have
to take it or leave it and even then it doesn't
make much sense. Gertrude didn't set her
poem in 18-em editorial type, but the analogy
to wind-up editorials is there.
And overwhelmingly apparent too. Because
The Daily is the nearest thing to perpetual
motion that I'll ever hit. It goes along on its
own power whether there is a man to guide it
or not.
But it depends upon the boy with the oilcan
and the Underwood Standard to run wellâ€”
or badly. That's where you come in, Harry.
The grease you can use will work in two
ways (or not at all): to make Daily gears inside
the Shack slide evenly; and to oil the diplomatic
tracks on which The Daily skids through Stan
ford.
Right now. The Daily's wheels are packed
and ready to go. Your staff knows its headlines
from a hot buttered bun; it has color, energy,
and responsibility. It will put out four pages
of news without making your telephone jangle
with complaints.
But don't let those wheels run too long with
out another grease-pack. The Daily is a tem
peramental old biddie.
And so is Stanford.
You can be right all you want about any
thing, but don't remind Stanford of the fact.
The kids don't like it. They prefer to pick up
a controversy, think through part of the facts,
pass a nice, clear crack-pot judgment. And if
you go any farther in your thinking process,
you may be right, but you'll be a heel to the
campus, dragging Stanford's name into the
mud. You'll get no thanks. But you'll be right.
You'll learn that Stanford doesn't read the
paper. You can print cold facts in all sincerity,
but if the campus has the jump on you with a
snap judgment, you might as well save your
breath explaining your motives. But don't give
them up.
Because, you have a better basis for leader
ship at Stanford than anyone else here. You
have an inside track on news, on background,
on details. Whether the campus accepts them
or not makes little difference. They won't.
But the fact remains that, granting the intelli
gence that you have, you can beat the campus
to the draw every time. You may miss occa
sionally, but not by far, while Stanford's shots
go wild.
Of course, you can play ball with the kids.
You can do it quite easily by never, never
using two-inch headlines to wake them up at
eight o'clock in the morning, by leaving them
almost completely alone in anything but tradi
tional editorial fields (A.S.S.U.-Ex Committee
affairs, for instance), and by moving in blissful
ignorance with the majority.
The trail the pack runs on is wide and stu
pidly easy to follow. You won't have to worry
about the pace; you can go to sleep. Except
that once running with it, you will wake up
to find the campus has become suspicious, dis
avowed you, reversed its field, and is in the
joyous process of trampling you under in the
quick retreat.
But don't misunderstand me. Basically Stan
ford is as open to constructive criticism as it
is eager to be right dammit right. Once con
vinced, it has the Energy to do anything it
wants. And sometimes it wants what it should
want, what you should want.
That's what makes The Daily worth while.
And Stanford.
