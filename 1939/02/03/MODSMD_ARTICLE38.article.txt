# How He Does Run On

THIS has gone on long enough, Harry. Your
editorial policy will be your own â€” and
Stanford's Stanford's because you can't build

an Ivory Tower, or if you do, stay there long.
This is Stanford's paper, you're Stanford's
editor. If you can get away from the Quad, it's
a neat trick. And an unprofitable one if you
pull it off.
If I went back into the files, I could quote a
batch of statements from outgoing editors
which, summarized, say, "I was wrong. Stan
ford is a fine place."
You can read them for yourself. I won't
bother to.
Because I already know it.
And I know that one of the finest things
about Stanford is that it can be better as time
goes on.
