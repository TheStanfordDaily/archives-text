# BULL SESSION
## RIDING BACKWARDS 
### JOHN COBBS 
Vt/ITH this issue, Volume 94 of The Daily recites its
curtain lines and retires quietly to a files room
shelf. It is a time for sentimentality and forgiving of
trespasses, a time for salving wounds and kissing the
place where it hurts.
Standing amid this sweet sot Tow of parting, I feci
strangely reluctant to spicak. I am not going anywhere,
and if I try any kiss-and-make-up work, either I
will get my face slapped, or I will have to back water
on it next volume. But even so, this is a day for
nostalgic looking over the shoulder, a time for casting
up accounts and balancing ledgers.

One pride I can find in Bull Session for the last
quarter and a half. It has followed like an obedient
son in the career laid out last fall. It has confined itself
to comment, peddling no sacred cause, preaching no
new word of God. It has not offered a correspondence
course in how to remodel civilization, and it has not
attempted to show Nature just where it could have
improved on evolution.
Stanford's young intellectuals haven't liked the
policy. Bull Session, they say, has been a journalistic
Ferdinand, sitting among the flowers, sticking its nose
only into things that pleased it. At least, that is what
Ihcy would say if they had read "Ferdinand."
But the trouble with young intellectuals is that
they have spent so much tune disliking things that
they dislike each other. Until they start howling on
the same key, I don't see how I can please more than
one of them at a time. Besides that I hesitate to take
the word of God by hearsay.
❖ * *
of the smooth pseudo-cynics haven't thought
much of Bull Session either. Their idea of a good
column is one that begins, "Have you heard the story
about the young couple without luggage and the par
rot?" Anything other than that they class on a liter
ary par with Moody's Industrials.
I agree that, their idea is an attractive one, but
after three years of life in a fraternity house most of
my printable jokes have atrophied. Under the circum
stances, I think it is only common sense to avoid any
story-telling tight rope walking.
* * >|s *
It would please me to think that if these two minor
ity groups were deducted, I could claim the rest of
Stanford as a loyal public. But somehow I feel that
there are others who will not stampede to hang gar
lands on Bull Session. If, for instance. Women's Con
ference were not above reproach, I would accuse it of
thinking unladylike thoughts.
All of this I regret, but I am bearing up nicely
under the load. Bull Session commented sincerely;
those who feel themselves wronged can find comfort
in a tag-line I have used before. Purity is its own
security.

of the smooth pseudo-cynics haven't thought
much of Bull Session either. Their idea of a good
column is one that begins, "Have you heard the story
about the young couple without luggage and the par
rot?" Anything other than that they class on a liter
ary par with Moody's Industrials.
I agree that, their idea is an attractive one, but
after three years of life in a fraternity house most of
my printable jokes have atrophied. Under the circum
stances, I think it is only common sense to avoid any
story-telling tight rope walking.

It would please me to think that if these two minor
ity groups were deducted, I could claim the rest of
Stanford as a loyal public. But somehow I feel that
there are others who will not stampede to hang gar
lands on Bull Session. If, for instance. Women's Con
ference were not above reproach, I would accuse it of
thinking unladylike thoughts.
All of this I regret, but I am bearing up nicely
under the load. Bull Session commented sincerely;
those who feel themselves wronged can find comfort
in a tag-line I have used before. Purity is its own
security.
Vt/ITH this issue, Volume 94 of The Daily recites its
curtain lines and retires quietly to a files room
shelf. It is a time for sentimentality and forgiving of
trespasses, a time for salving wounds and kissing the
place where it hurts.
Standing amid this sweet sot Tow of parting, I feci
strangely reluctant to spicak. I am not going anywhere,
and if I try any kiss-and-make-up work, either I
will get my face slapped, or I will have to back water
on it next volume. But even so, this is a day for
nostalgic looking over the shoulder, a time for casting
up accounts and balancing ledgers.

One pride I can find in Bull Session for the last
quarter and a half. It has followed like an obedient
son in the career laid out last fall. It has confined itself
to comment, peddling no sacred cause, preaching no
new word of God. It has not offered a correspondence
course in how to remodel civilization, and it has not
attempted to show Nature just where it could have
improved on evolution.
Stanford's young intellectuals haven't liked the
policy. Bull Session, they say, has been a journalistic
Ferdinand, sitting among the flowers, sticking its nose
only into things that pleased it. At least, that is what
Ihcy would say if they had read "Ferdinand."
But the trouble with young intellectuals is that
they have spent so much tune disliking things that
they dislike each other. Until they start howling on
the same key, I don't see how I can please more than
one of them at a time. Besides that I hesitate to take
the word of God by hearsay.
