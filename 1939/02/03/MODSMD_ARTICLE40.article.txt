# Lightly. . . And Politely

LIGHTLY
The Shack is a funny place today, like the last chap
ter in "Farewell to Arms."
At. 12 o'clock tonight Volume 94 is going to die in
child-birth, leaving its offspring, Volume 95, in its
place.
But today you don't know whether you are writing
for the future, or for the past. You arc not writing
for tod^y.
Most of the staff has been promoted, but this week
the people have to carry on in their old jobs. They
don't like it. They are impatient to move up. They
are writing their last stories for Volume 94 as quickly
as they can pound them out. The new edit, board, in
hushed voices, is planning its policy. The frosh are
craftily hiding their razz edition where no one will
find it until they bring it out tomorrow night. There's
a feeling of the spirit of the dead in this place, com
bined with something like the night before Christmas.
But out in the front oflirc, Jim is writing his
last edits. Yesterday lie was the editor; today lie
is the Daily's mid-wife. And out here Cobbs and
I are slowly filling the same holes on the back page
that we fill every day. We are something of wit
nesses to the metamorphosis.
And like "Farewell to Arms," when the staff
leaves the shark at midnight tonight. Volume 94
will he cold and lifeless. It will he dead. All right,
so it's dead.
There will he no emotional hang.
Because the number of people looking ahead
will greatly outnumber those looking behind.
But. to those people there will be nothing of the
"Farewell to Anns" about this place. They are eagerly
looking forward to a new beginning just, as they will
next spring and just as they did last fall. To them the
end of one volume means new fields to conquer in the
next.
And to those people—who don't feel another thing
in the end of this volume—anything peculiar they may
notice in the atmosphere around here today, they
will lay to the threatening rain and overhanging
clouds outside.
Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps it is the rain.

But I should be writing lightly and politely.
I should go back into character and say some
thing such as:
I'm quite sure that I would make a fine grad
uation speaker—if I graduated in a class of three
people and two of them were very dumb.
Dumb like the absurdly bashful girl in the
sorority last night who wouldn't kiss one of their
bashers in front of the rest of the sisters even
though the house-mother wasn't there and he
offered her 50 rents.
And turned out the lights.

POLITELY
I started this volume by muttering bnd things about
Encina and thereby having Dean Bunn say bad
things to the editor.
Reading today s column over my own .shoulder, it
looks as it I have ended (he volume by simply mum
bling.
