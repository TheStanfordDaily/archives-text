# 'The Young In Heart' Scores Comedy Hit
## 
### 
"TIIE YOUNG IN IIEART," cur- j
rcntly playing at the Fox-Stanford, j
and featuring Roland Young:
"The Young in Heart" is good
comedy—the whole cockeyed, maud
lin set-up is good.
There is something about the skul
duggery of a family of screwy
spongers and about how, through 1

the influence of a
wistful old lady,
they exchange
their risky hedon
ism for the bour
geois virtues.
There is some
drooling about
have f.'iith in those
you love and they
will turn out all
right and nobody

is really hard-boiled underneath
and so forth. There is some of this, I
all right, but not too much.
And above and beyond, something |
subtle makes t tick—makes it plink,
along in the upper register, brightly,
disjointedly, eccentrically, in some
thing of the tempo of "Topper" now
that you mention it. —Slater
