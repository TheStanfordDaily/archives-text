## COLUMNS CRITICIZED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
John Cobbs, I must confess, sings
a very tuneful lets-be-gay-at-col
lege refrain. It's just chuck full of
interesting little similes and merry
metaphors. It even makes one
think the writer is permeated with
tobacco smoke, keeps his sleeves up
with arm-garters, and has a pencil
behind his ear and a green vizor on
his furrowed but unbent brow. That
brave new statement, "We don't cus
tomarily cry ourselves to sleep,"
sounds just a real old newspaper
philosopher!
But old Cobbs' arguments don't
match his metaphors.
In the first place, he doesn't go
far enough. Accepting his wise old
premise—that collegians shouldn't
worry about serious matter—l think
we should go ahead and abolish
college newspaper columns. They're
much too serious — like starvation
and war. And The Daily, too, and
lectures and debates. In fact, we
ought to prohibit such dreadfully
sober things as metropolitan news
papers and magazines. At college we
ought only to busy ourselves with
theories and dancing around vol
canoes—and preferably not too many
theories at that.
Yes, it's a pretty sad affair when
Stanford students take themselves so
seriously as to start writing col
umns, when life-insurance statistics
show perfectly well that we'll all
live long enough to write them later
on.
And the damage that "serious
thinking" does to our "objective at
titude" is really immeasurable; don't
you think so, old Mr. Cobbs?
Yours for whiter and higher
Ivory Towers,
Sherman Mellinkoff
