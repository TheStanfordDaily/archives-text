The Editor, Sir:
Shoot me if you so desire for
bringing up a musty subject. The
Encina, Toyon, Union. Branner tele
phone system is acknowledged to be
inadequate during certain times of
the day and night. What to do,
what to do is the age-old question?
Probably the only solution pro
posed so far is to install another
switchboard.
Practically, such a solution is eco
nomically unsound; for outside of
the busy hours (you know 'em) the
"board" is just about as dead as
Latin. And. anyway, even if the
University did install another
"board," the econ department would
yell about the law of diminishing
returns. (Is that the right one?)
Back to the question of what to
do? (1) If you don't know the num
ber you wish (fraternities, sorori
ties and campus phones excepted)
ask for information (113). (2) For
those calling people inside the halls
—please give the poor operators a
break by looking up the party's
room number (that's one use for the
Bawlout).
Now if everyone has read this far
and in the future will follow this
simple two-point formula, be
ready for a surprise. Now as to the
surprise, you can find that out by
following the formula. Logical,
isn't it? Operator S
