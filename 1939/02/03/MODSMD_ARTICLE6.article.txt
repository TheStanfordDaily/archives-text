### 
Opening of the seventh annual Stanford Alumni Conference will take
place here Saturday in the new Cubbcrly Education Building, with Al
mon E. Roth, head of the San Francisco Employers' Association, as one
of the important speakers.
Robert "Bones" Hamilton, alumni secretary, expects from (>OO to 7(MI
alumni to attend. These conferences have been planned so that the

alumni can witness the strides that
Stanford has made in the field of
research and learning, according to
Hamilton.
Over 230 reservations for alumni
have already been made, and any
students interested are welcome to
attend, as the discussions will be
of interest both to present students
and graduates, Hamilton assured.
The highlight of Saturday's ses
sion will be a panel discussion on
"Should Employer and Employee Be
Regulated by the Government?"
The views of "Management" will be
presented by Mr. Roth, former
comptroller of the University.
Edwin A. Cottrell, professor of po
litical science, will give the views
of "Government," while William S.
Hopkins and Paul Eliel will take
different sides of the panel, with
Philip W. Buck, associate professor
of political science, presiding.
Chemical demonstrations by Dr.
Robert E. Swain, prominent chem-
I ist, will be made later in the after
noon as well as a talk by him on
"Significance of Chemistry in Mod
ern Life."
Saturday evening the alumni have
a choice of either seeing the U. C.
L. A.-Stanford basketball game or
attending the winter quarter play,
"The Mask and the Face," which is
being given by the Division of
Speech and Drama in the Memorial
Theater.
Three discussion groups on pres
! ent economic and political prob
; lems will attract graduates on Sun
day afternoon. "Germany and the
Great Powers" is the topic to be

Lutz, history professor and dean of
graduate study. Lewis M. Terman,
