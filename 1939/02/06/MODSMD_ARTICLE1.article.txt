is a funny place. It's dif
ficult for an Amcncan to un
derstand a continent where, on one
side of an imaginary line, you hear
one language and feel one set of
prejudices, where you take one step
. cross that line and straightway find
a new language and a different point
of view.
It's even more difficult for us to
imagine a single nation where for
centuries the people of two differ
ent provinces have despised each
other, have not even understood
each other's language. You see, it's
been a good many years since the
American Civil War.

today is not a war between
sections and economic interests as
ours was; it's purely a political
afTair. Sectionalism arises in
Spain completely 011 the Repub

lias always hated the rest of the
country, and it will take more than
the Insurgent - Loyalist war to
pi>tch things up.
Ergo, when their province was
completely over-run by Franco's
men, the Catalonians decided that
they had nothing to gain by con
tinuing the fight and that they
should surrender to a superior
force. With the flame of liberty
bravely flickering in their hearts, the

refused to give up the ship.

lini yesterday decided to tell the
world a thing or two about his in
tentions toward the Iberian penin
sula. Through his official press
organ II Ducc stated that, con
trary to his agreement with Eng
land. lie may keep his troops in
Spain after the close of the con
flict.
Until the . menace of Commun
ism is removed from Spain for
ever, roared Mussolini in print, Ital
ian troops will remain there. Re
duced to actualities, this means that
II Duee intends to maintain a mili
tary base on Spanish territory in the
strategically located Balearic Isl
ands where he can control the en
trance to the Mediterranean as well
as seeing that the Reds keep their
hands off of Spain.
Britain is bound to resent such
a move because the Mediter
ranean is a vital link in the chain
between the mother country, the
Suez Canal, and India.
France will object because she
remembers several very forceful
Italian threats concerning her
North African colonics not so long i
ago.
