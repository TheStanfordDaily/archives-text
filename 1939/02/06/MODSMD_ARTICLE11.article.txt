PORT VENDRES (France). Feb. 5
(UP). â€”French anti-aircraft batter
ies at Cap Cerbere, southeast of here,
opened fire today as eight Spanish
Insurgent bombers flew up the Medi
terranean coast of Spain and over
French territory. The batteries ap
peared to be putting up a warning,
defensive barrage, rather than firing
directly at the planes.
