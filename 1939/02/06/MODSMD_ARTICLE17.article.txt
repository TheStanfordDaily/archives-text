# Card Five Cops 2 Win From Ucla
## Stanford Ties U.S.C. For Second Place In Southern Division 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Before going into the awful de
tails of a massacre which took place
over the week-end, there's some
more important business of figur
ing out the state of affairs of the
Southern Division basketball race.
Cal, which has occupied the throne
room for three weeks—with only a
one-day joint occupancy with U.S.C
—will have first place all to itself
for yet another week and may or
may not relinquish its position
when Stanford crosses the Bay for
an engagement Friday night.
The Trojans arc no longer alone
in second place but are dead-locked
with our Indians as a result of two
embarrassing defeats, for U.C.L.A.'s

hapless Bruins in the Pavilion Fri
day and Saturday nights. While
Stanford now stacks up as a real
threat to Cal and U.S.C. for basket
ball honors, the Uclans apparently
are secure in holding down the po
sition of kingpins of the conference
cellar.
UCLANS BURIED
Although in an ugly mood in the
first game, U.C.L.A. is nevertheless
bounced back on its ear, SG-44. That
is the actual start of the slaughter
which continues over until Satur
day when fate again rears its ugly
head and the Indian digs the
Bruins' grave deeper with a 47-21
victory.
Games 1 and 2 were the Bruins'
18th and 19th straight defeats in
conference competition since way
back in February, 1937. Already the
Trojans and Cal have put the Bruin
on the canvas for the 10-count so it
appears that only a wonderful in
spiration can get the Westwooders
out of the rut they've been in so
long.
RECORD ESTABLISHED
In walloping the Bruins. Stanford
hangs up some sort of a new con
ference record when the Uclans are
held without a single field goal in
the first half and through two min
utes of the second half Saturday
night. Our Indians lead at the half,
24-5, with all five Bruin points com
ing via the free throw route.
The Indians are hot from the
start. Captain Phil Zonne puts in a
short one and Don Burness follows
with one from 10 feet out. Within
two and a half minutes Burness has
tanked seven more points from far
out and close in and a foul shot. It's
now Zonne's turn and he sinks two I
goals from close in, making it |
Zonne-Burness 15, U.C.L.A. 3.
For some reason or other Stan- j
ford is held scoreless for three min- j
utes after Dick Lyon sinks a shot;
then Bob Burnett comes in and finds
his shooting eye for two field goals.
Meanwhile Lyon and Burness are ;
adding a couple of points. Stanford |
leaves the floor ahead — Ucla still j
without a field goal although they've I
taken at least 35 shots from al! i
angles and distances at the basket, j
After only seven and a half min- j
utes of the second half, a guy nam- j
ed Weldie scores six points and col- j
lects the first goal from the floor—
breaking up a field goal draught,
j U.C.L.A. gets a little rough, a la
i football, and starts mixing it up
! now. Burness goes down. He's up.
' Davidson takes one on the nose.
' He's out (of the game). Bill Rapp
I goes up; he's down; he's out. Little
Don Williams is mistaken for a
| tackling dummy by footballer Jack
Montgomery. Williams down but
S not out; Montgomery is shooed out
|on four personals. Alex Rafalovich
j leaves on four personals and is giv
! en the razzberries by 2000 fans.
I CARDS HELD
In the meantime, this rough stuff
j doesn't go so well with our Indians'
| offensive attack and they make but
| seven field goals—three by Burnett.
The rest of the points are made on
i free throws.
The first half is much smoother
i than the second half. Burness' spot
: 10 feet out is going to work against
j Cal if he's hot. Zonne takes high
scoring honors with 13 points. Bur
ness, who makes nine points in his
first five minutes has Rafalovich on
him and gets but one more point
the rest of the game. This rough
ing-it-up business ruins good pass
j ing and setting up of good plays.
However, U.C.L.A. proves that
they are no longer mama's boys.

more important business of figur

Southern Division basketball race.
Cal, which has occupied the throne
room for three weeks—with only a
one-day joint occupancy with U.S.C
—will have first place all to itself
for yet another week and may or
may not relinquish its position
when Stanford crosses the Bay for
an engagement Friday night.
The Trojans arc no longer alone
in second place but are dead-locked
with our Indians as a result of two
embarrassing defeats, for U.C.L.A.'s

hapless Bruins in the Pavilion Fri
day and Saturday nights. While
Stanford now stacks up as a real
threat to Cal and U.S.C. for basket
ball honors, the Uclans apparently
are secure in holding down the po
sition of kingpins of the conference
cellar.
UCLANS BURIED
Although in an ugly mood in the
first game, U.C.L.A. is nevertheless
bounced back on its ear, SG-44. That
is the actual start of the slaughter
which continues over until Satur
day when fate again rears its ugly
head and the Indian digs the
Bruins' grave deeper with a 47-21
victory.
Games 1 and 2 were the Bruins'
18th and 19th straight defeats in
conference competition since way
back in February, 1937. Already the
Trojans and Cal have put the Bruin
on the canvas for the 10-count so it
appears that only a wonderful in
spiration can get the Westwooders
out of the rut they've been in so
long.

In the meantime, this rough stuff
j doesn't go so well with our Indians'

The rest of the points are made on
i free throws.
The first half is much smoother
i than the second half. Burness' spot
: 10 feet out is going to work against
j Cal if he's hot. Zonne takes high
scoring honors with 13 points. Bur
ness, who makes nine points in his
first five minutes has Rafalovich on
him and gets but one more point
the rest of the game. This rough
ing-it-up business ruins good pass
j ing and setting up of good plays.
However, U.C.L.A. proves that
they are no longer mama's boys.
Before going into the awful de
tails of a massacre which took place
over the week-end, there's some
more important business of figur
ing out the state of affairs of the
Southern Division basketball race.
Cal, which has occupied the throne
room for three weeks—with only a
one-day joint occupancy with U.S.C
—will have first place all to itself
for yet another week and may or
may not relinquish its position
when Stanford crosses the Bay for
an engagement Friday night.
The Trojans arc no longer alone
in second place but are dead-locked
with our Indians as a result of two
embarrassing defeats, for U.C.L.A.'s

hapless Bruins in the Pavilion Fri
day and Saturday nights. While
Stanford now stacks up as a real
threat to Cal and U.S.C. for basket
ball honors, the Uclans apparently
are secure in holding down the po
sition of kingpins of the conference
cellar.
UCLANS BURIED
Although in an ugly mood in the
first game, U.C.L.A. is nevertheless
bounced back on its ear, SG-44. That
is the actual start of the slaughter
which continues over until Satur
day when fate again rears its ugly
head and the Indian digs the
Bruins' grave deeper with a 47-21
victory.
Games 1 and 2 were the Bruins'
18th and 19th straight defeats in
conference competition since way
back in February, 1937. Already the
Trojans and Cal have put the Bruin
on the canvas for the 10-count so it
appears that only a wonderful in
spiration can get the Westwooders
out of the rut they've been in so
long.
RECORD ESTABLISHED
In walloping the Bruins. Stanford
hangs up some sort of a new con
ference record when the Uclans are
held without a single field goal in
the first half and through two min
utes of the second half Saturday
night. Our Indians lead at the half,
24-5, with all five Bruin points com
ing via the free throw route.
The Indians are hot from the
start. Captain Phil Zonne puts in a
short one and Don Burness follows
with one from 10 feet out. Within
two and a half minutes Burness has
tanked seven more points from far
out and close in and a foul shot. It's
now Zonne's turn and he sinks two I
goals from close in, making it |
Zonne-Burness 15, U.C.L.A. 3.
For some reason or other Stan- j
ford is held scoreless for three min- j
utes after Dick Lyon sinks a shot;
then Bob Burnett comes in and finds
his shooting eye for two field goals.
Meanwhile Lyon and Burness are ;
adding a couple of points. Stanford |
leaves the floor ahead — Ucla still j
without a field goal although they've I
taken at least 35 shots from al! i
angles and distances at the basket, j
