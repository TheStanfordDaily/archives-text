# Card Five Cops 2 Win From Ucla
## Stanford Ties U.S.C. For Second Place In Southern Division 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Before going into the awful de
tails of a massacre which took place
over the week-end, there's some
more important business of figur
ing out the state of affairs of the
Southern Division basketball race.
Cal, which has occupied the throne
room for three weeks—with only a
one-day joint occupancy with U.S.C
—will have first place all to itself
for yet another week and may or
may not relinquish its position
when Stanford crosses the Bay for
an engagement Friday night.
The Trojans arc no longer alone
in second place but are dead-locked
with our Indians as a result of two
embarrassing defeats, for U.C.L.A.'s

hapless Bruins in the Pavilion Fri
day and Saturday nights. While
Stanford now stacks up as a real
threat to Cal and U.S.C. for basket
ball honors, the Uclans apparently
are secure in holding down the po
sition of kingpins of the conference
cellar.
UCLANS BURIED
Although in an ugly mood in the
first game, U.C.L.A. is nevertheless
bounced back on its ear, SG-44. That
is the actual start of the slaughter
which continues over until Satur
day when fate again rears its ugly
head and the Indian digs the
Bruins' grave deeper with a 47-21
victory.
Games 1 and 2 were the Bruins'
18th and 19th straight defeats in
conference competition since way
back in February, 1937. Already the
Trojans and Cal have put the Bruin
on the canvas for the 10-count so it
appears that only a wonderful in
spiration can get the Westwooders
out of the rut they've been in so
long.
RECORD ESTABLISHED
In walloping the Bruins. Stanford
hangs up some sort of a new con
ference record when the Uclans are
held without a single field goal in
the first half and through two min
utes of the second half Saturday
night. Our Indians lead at the half,
24-5, with all five Bruin points com
ing via the free throw route.
The Indians are hot from the
start. Captain Phil Zonne puts in a
short one and Don Burness follows
with one from 10 feet out. Within
two and a half minutes Burness has
tanked seven more points from far
out and close in and a foul shot. It's
