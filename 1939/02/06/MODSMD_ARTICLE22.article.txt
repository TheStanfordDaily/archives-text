# Diners Recall Farm History Between Bites
## 
### BY HERMAN SILVERMAN 
He took a bito of his waffle and
said, "No, technically speaking I'm
not a Stanford man, but I was on
the Farm campus the very day Stan
ford opened. And for the first 16
years I had charge of the Bookstore.
My, I'll never forget when we built
a new Bookstore and only eight
days after its completion it was de
stroyed by the disastrous earth
quake of 19(H)."
Speaking was Mr. W. F. Hyde, to
whom I had just brought a cream
waffle and black tea. Mr. Hyde and
his fellow diner, Mr. Newman Mum
ford, were attending the Alumni
Reunion and had just dropped into
the Union Cellar for refreshments.
As their hasher, I contrived to serve
them food and get an interview at
the same time.
Mr. Hyde, a tall, thin man wear
ing shell-rimmed glasses over
piercing, yet kindly eyes and to
whose hair time had played havoc,
continued to justify his status as a
Stanford man. He proudly pointed
out that his two sisters, a brother,
a son. and a daughter-in-Jaw had
all graduated from Stanford.
AboUv this i : me Mr. Mumford,
the one that had asked for cream
with his tea, interrupted by remark
ing that he also is not a full-fledged
Stanford man. However, besides
watching a son graduate from here,
he comes down from Canada every
winter and stays in Menlo Park so
as to be near the campus. He was
acquainted with Stanford's first
president, David Starr Jordan, and
his wife.
After pouring the old timers an
other cup of tea, I asked them what
change was most noticeable in Stan
ford. Mr. Hyde could not select any
particular one, nor could Mr. Mum
ford. But Mr. Mumford, an engineer
and retii-ed from the British Ad
miralty, volunteered three things
that he believes make Stanford a
great school — the lasting influence
of Dr. Jordan, students living on
campus, and the influence of a
church on campus.
Mr. Hyde, former head of the
Bookstore, disagreed with the theory
that the church had any great in
fluence, for "not many of the stu
dents attend chapel." An argument
immediately ensued. But fearing
that I had caused the ending of a
fine friendship, I changed the sub
ject by mentioning Canada.
Mr. Mumford then told about
iVieeting Lord Tweedsmuir, Gover
nor General of Canada. Speaking of
great Englishmen, he said. "Have
you ever read Lord Bryce's Com
monwealth of America? No? But
every American youth should read
it!"
Mr. Hyde came to my aid by say
ing that the book had been outmod
ed; that students today are more in
terested in current affairs. And
again an argument ensued. "But
Ihis book will never grow old. It's
a classic. It's like the Bible."
"Nevertheless, students stopped
leading it 15 years ago."
The argument waged on, but I
had to leave for it was time to go
off duty. I excused myself, but as I
headed toward the time clock, Mr.
Mumford shouted after me, "Don't
forget to read Commonwealth of
America."
He took a bito of his waffle and
said, "No, technically speaking I'm

a classic. It's like the Bible."
"Nevertheless, students stopped
leading it 15 years ago."
The argument waged on, but I
had to leave for it was time to go
off duty. I excused myself, but as I
headed toward the time clock, Mr.
Mumford shouted after me, "Don't
forget to read Commonwealth of
America."
He took a bito of his waffle and
said, "No, technically speaking I'm
not a Stanford man, but I was on
the Farm campus the very day Stan
ford opened. And for the first 16
years I had charge of the Bookstore.
My, I'll never forget when we built
a new Bookstore and only eight
days after its completion it was de
stroyed by the disastrous earth
quake of 19(H)."
Speaking was Mr. W. F. Hyde, to
whom I had just brought a cream
waffle and black tea. Mr. Hyde and
his fellow diner, Mr. Newman Mum
ford, were attending the Alumni
Reunion and had just dropped into
the Union Cellar for refreshments.
As their hasher, I contrived to serve
them food and get an interview at
the same time.
Mr. Hyde, a tall, thin man wear
ing shell-rimmed glasses over
piercing, yet kindly eyes and to
whose hair time had played havoc,
continued to justify his status as a
Stanford man. He proudly pointed
out that his two sisters, a brother,
a son. and a daughter-in-Jaw had
all graduated from Stanford.
AboUv this i : me Mr. Mumford,
the one that had asked for cream
with his tea, interrupted by remark
ing that he also is not a full-fledged
Stanford man. However, besides
watching a son graduate from here,
he comes down from Canada every
winter and stays in Menlo Park so
as to be near the campus. He was
acquainted with Stanford's first
president, David Starr Jordan, and
his wife.
After pouring the old timers an
other cup of tea, I asked them what
change was most noticeable in Stan
ford. Mr. Hyde could not select any
particular one, nor could Mr. Mum
ford. But Mr. Mumford, an engineer
and retii-ed from the British Ad
miralty, volunteered three things
that he believes make Stanford a
great school — the lasting influence
of Dr. Jordan, students living on
campus, and the influence of a
church on campus.
Mr. Hyde, former head of the
Bookstore, disagreed with the theory
that the church had any great in
fluence, for "not many of the stu
dents attend chapel." An argument
immediately ensued. But fearing
that I had caused the ending of a
fine friendship, I changed the sub
ject by mentioning Canada.
Mr. Mumford then told about
iVieeting Lord Tweedsmuir, Gover
nor General of Canada. Speaking of
great Englishmen, he said. "Have
you ever read Lord Bryce's Com
monwealth of America? No? But
every American youth should read
it!"
Mr. Hyde came to my aid by say
ing that the book had been outmod
ed; that students today are more in
terested in current affairs. And
again an argument ensued. "But
Ihis book will never grow old. It's
a classic. It's like the Bible."
