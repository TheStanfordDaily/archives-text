# Full House Acclaims 'Mask, Face'
## Bryan, Toombs Hit Top Performances In Modern Satire 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
Combining dialogue that has the
sophistication of Norman Douglas'
"South Wind" or Thornton Wild
er's "Cabala"' and the consistent act
ing of a well chosefToaV, "The Mask
and the Face," C. B. Fernald's mod
ern satire, opened Friday night in
the Little Theater ot a capacity audi
ence.
Earning top honors are Melba
Rae Toombs and Doug Bryan. A re
markably even supporting company
of eleven characters keeps the action
swift, sharp, and direct through
most of the play.
Getting off to a slow start in the
first act, the cast hit cues quicker,
slipped less often in the second and
third portions. Fumbled lines that
will be corrected by tonight's show
marred several scenes.
CARRIES BURDEN
Doug Bryan as Count Mario Gra
zia, the man with the eleventh cen
tury mind, carried the burden of a
complex role with equanimity. His
voice would have been better in
Memorial Hall, but his portrayal of
the husband who brags of killing
an unfaithful wife and lives to eat
his words, is strong and decisive.
Melba Rae Toombs as his wife,
Savina, assumes one of her first
comedy roles. An accomplished act
ress, she is easily the standout char
acter in a cast notably experienced.
Pier scene with Bryan in the second
act is the high point of the produc
tion.
From the uniformly even support
ing group, Gordon Williams as old
Pier Zanotti, banker friend of Grazia
and husband of a too-young wife,
turns his lines with suavity, pushes
each wry speech to the limit.
COMPANY TOPS
Geraldine Schreiber, Carol Hover,
Garrett Starmer, Margaret Paulson,
Charles Bulotti, Dan Holtom, Dana
Winters, Ahser Wilson, Fred W kil
ter, Florence Haslett make up a
company seldom equalled in sup
porting ability.
Major strength of the production
lies in dialogue that crackles and
races. Razor-sharp, each brilliant
line of Author Fcmald finds its
mark. The cast underplays some of
the scenes, gives the impression of
not always pushing each sequence to
the hilt. But the superbly-etched
satiric quality of the play is cap
tured with dramatic skill.
Directed by Thomas Wood Stev
ens, assisted by J. P. Cahn, "The
Mask and the Face" will continue in
Little Theater tonight, Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday nights. Cur
tain rises at 8 o'clock.
