# Senate to Probe Roosevelt's Foreign Policy
## President Denies Rhine, U. S. Frontier 
### 
\yASHINGTON, Feb. 5 (UP).—
Congressional lines were drawn to
night for a thorough airing of Presi
dent Roosevelt's foreign policy in an
effort to determine how far the ad
ministration believes the American
frontiers of defense should extend.
Bitter debate is assured this week
in the Senate and House where, strict
isolationist blocs and Republican
leaders plan to plumb the secrecy
surrounding Mr. Roosevelt's meeting
with the Senate Military Affairs
Committee and discover exactly what
the group was told.
Mr. Roosevelt described as a "de
liberate lie ' reports he told the group
the American frontier now lies on
the Rhine. Several Republican
committee .members have taken issue
with him, saying that while he may
not have used that particular term,
the essence of his remarks justified
the phrase.
Senator H. Styles Bridges, R., N.H.,
a committee member, has been par
ticularly anxious to make public his
version of the meeting, while others
have complained of the secrecy to
which Mr. Roosevelt purportedly
pledged them. The President, how
ever, said that too much emphasis
has been placed on the secrecy angle.
There was a possibility the dis
pute may create sufficient furore to
delay enactment of the administra
tion's emergency national defense
program. Senator Hiram W. John
son, R. ( Calif., leader of the small
Congressional block of irreconcil
ables who opposed the Versailles
treaty and American entry into the
League of Nations, is slated to open

fire on the matter when the Senate
convenes tomorrow.
The Senatorial group sec king clar
ification of Mr. Roosevelt's foreign
policy has not received the open
support of the Republican leader
ship. Senate Minority Leader
Charles L. McNary, R., Ore., has
remained silent during the contro
versy as have other higher-ups.

leaders plan to plumb the secrecy
surrounding Mr. Roosevelt's meeting
with the Senate Military Affairs
Committee and discover exactly what
the group was told.
Mr. Roosevelt described as a "de
liberate lie ' reports he told the group
the American frontier now lies on
the Rhine. Several Republican
committee .members have taken issue
with him, saying that while he may
not have used that particular term,
the essence of his remarks justified
the phrase.
Senator H. Styles Bridges, R., N.H.,
a committee member, has been par
ticularly anxious to make public his
version of the meeting, while others
have complained of the secrecy to
which Mr. Roosevelt purportedly
pledged them. The President, how
ever, said that too much emphasis
has been placed on the secrecy angle.
There was a possibility the dis
pute may create sufficient furore to
delay enactment of the administra
tion's emergency national defense
program. Senator Hiram W. John
son, R. ( Calif., leader of the small
Congressional block of irreconcil
ables who opposed the Versailles
treaty and American entry into the
League of Nations, is slated to open

fire on the matter when the Senate
convenes tomorrow.
The Senatorial group sec king clar
ification of Mr. Roosevelt's foreign
policy has not received the open
support of the Republican leader
ship. Senate Minority Leader
Charles L. McNary, R., Ore., has
remained silent during the contro
versy as have other higher-ups.
