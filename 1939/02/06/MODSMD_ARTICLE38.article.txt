FOR the first time in many a
moon, Stanford athletic teams have
gone through an unblemished week
end. It all started Friday afternoon
when Paul Herron and his ace part
ners on the frosh swimming team
lore up the national yearling record
book as they defeated the San Fran
cisco State varsity. Herron beat San
Francisco's pride, Henry Paris, in
two clashes and had enough left
Saturday to beat pool and univer
sity marks in the 150-yard back
stroke in an exhibition.
WHAT makes Herron such a
.sensation is not the fact that he
wins but that he has the ability to
break every existing conference rec
ord from the 50-yard mark on up to
a 440. And he swims equally well
in all three strokes. Frank Weeden
in the back-stroke holds a flock of
records himself and Capt. Win Need
ham is not only an All-American
but the defending coast champion in
the furlong free-style; still Herron
can warp them both.

FRIDAY night and Saturday, Ev
erett Dean's smooth passing but
blinky eyed basketball men handed
U.C.L.A. consecutive defeats num
bers 18 and 19. The only thrills
were the frantic efforts of the more
blinky Bruins to score a field goal
in that first half Saturday. They
gained another record for their re
tiring Caddy Works when they
didn't.
"BEEB" LEE coaches his improv
ing frosh to a couplet of easy wins
over mediocre opposition. Lee's
chances of fielding a winner against
the Cal Cubs is something like 100
per cent better than it was a month
ago. Remember the terrific warping
San Jose high school handed them
at the start of the season?
PETE FAY of Stanford and A1
Braga of U.S.F. minced in a few
rights to the jaw along with a closely
fought game of rugby. Stanford
might have lost the fight, because
it happened right alongside the Don
bench, a faux-pas to say the least,
but the Indians stayed right at the
top of the Northern Cal conference
with a 6-3 win in the only scheduled
entanglement of the day. The fisti
cuffs weren't even billed as a second
feature.
* »!< #
lIERRON might be the life of the
frosh swimmers but a whole crew
of standout performances enabled
the Stanford varsity to lick the Ath
ens Club without much ado. Win
Needham was out of action already
this aggregation which had already
thumped Cal; so the Berkeley coach,
A1 Dowden, is probably completely
demoralized about the whole thing.
Too bad.
* * *
GETTING down to individual
performances we have to bow to
Bill Janss who won Yosemite's
downhill invitational race despite
the fact he had to come in on one
ski. Janss beat out some four doz
en of the best racers in the state.
Then Larry Dee and Lloyd Gates
annexed first-round tennis wins in
the San Francisco Indoor Cham
pionships. Ben Dey and Bob Un
derwood, graduate stars, also kept
the tournament in a red hue with
similar victories.
IF we missed any other winners
we're sorry. The thing about it is
that we might finally have gotten
rid of that defeatist stigma. Being a
good loser is all right, but being a
good winner is something twice as
good. In fact, it's colossal.

FRIDAY night and Saturday, Ev
erett Dean's smooth passing but
blinky eyed basketball men handed
U.C.L.A. consecutive defeats num
bers 18 and 19. The only thrills
were the frantic efforts of the more
blinky Bruins to score a field goal
in that first half Saturday. They
gained another record for their re
tiring Caddy Works when they
didn't.
"BEEB" LEE coaches his improv
ing frosh to a couplet of easy wins
over mediocre opposition. Lee's
chances of fielding a winner against
the Cal Cubs is something like 100
per cent better than it was a month
ago. Remember the terrific warping
San Jose high school handed them
at the start of the season?
PETE FAY of Stanford and A1
Braga of U.S.F. minced in a few
rights to the jaw along with a closely
fought game of rugby. Stanford
might have lost the fight, because
it happened right alongside the Don
bench, a faux-pas to say the least,
but the Indians stayed right at the
top of the Northern Cal conference
with a 6-3 win in the only scheduled
entanglement of the day. The fisti
cuffs weren't even billed as a second
feature.
* »!< #
lIERRON might be the life of the
frosh swimmers but a whole crew
of standout performances enabled
the Stanford varsity to lick the Ath
ens Club without much ado. Win
Needham was out of action already
this aggregation which had already
thumped Cal; so the Berkeley coach,
A1 Dowden, is probably completely
demoralized about the whole thing.
Too bad.
* * *
GETTING down to individual
performances we have to bow to
Bill Janss who won Yosemite's
downhill invitational race despite
the fact he had to come in on one
ski. Janss beat out some four doz
en of the best racers in the state.
Then Larry Dee and Lloyd Gates
annexed first-round tennis wins in
the San Francisco Indoor Cham
pionships. Ben Dey and Bob Un
derwood, graduate stars, also kept
the tournament in a red hue with
similar victories.
IF we missed any other winners
we're sorry. The thing about it is
that we might finally have gotten
rid of that defeatist stigma. Being a
good loser is all right, but being a
good winner is something twice as
good. In fact, it's colossal.
FOR the first time in many a
moon, Stanford athletic teams have
gone through an unblemished week
end. It all started Friday afternoon
when Paul Herron and his ace part
ners on the frosh swimming team
lore up the national yearling record
book as they defeated the San Fran
cisco State varsity. Herron beat San
Francisco's pride, Henry Paris, in
two clashes and had enough left
Saturday to beat pool and univer
sity marks in the 150-yard back
stroke in an exhibition.
WHAT makes Herron such a
.sensation is not the fact that he
wins but that he has the ability to
break every existing conference rec
ord from the 50-yard mark on up to
a 440. And he swims equally well
in all three strokes. Frank Weeden
in the back-stroke holds a flock of
