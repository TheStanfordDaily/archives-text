# Ucla Introduces New Water Sport
## 
### 
Something new in sports—a cross
between a gang fight and drowning—
made one of its public appearances
recently at U.C.L.A.
Invented this year and played dur
ing the summer in the Olympic pool,
the game is politely called paddle
board water polo.
Anything goes, including some
thing called "conflict" with an op
ponent. Jumping from one's board
and landing with hands, feet and
elbows is not only allowed, but en
couraged.

Members of the Santal sect of In
dia take oaths on a piece of tiger
skin. They believe a tiger will eat
them if they swear falsely.
