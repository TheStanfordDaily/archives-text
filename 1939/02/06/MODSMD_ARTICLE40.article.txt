aggregation, once more glommed in- j
dividual honors over the week-end i

ing three records.

one-tenth of a second from the old
Pacific Coast Conference record [

Things were booming on the Stan-'
ford waterfront over the week-end, j
and the Card varsity went to town !
against the Athens Club squad in a |
47-26 victory Saturday; while the '
day preceding, those unpredictable j
Papooses smashed five national col- |
legiate freshman records while ad- j
ministering a thwacking defeat to i
the San Francisco State swim j
team.
The 21-point victory the Card
varsity poured out against the Ath- I
ens Club brings hopes for a Big
Meet win to a high peak. The Sat- j
urday before, Athens Club ekod
out a three-point margin over the j
California varsity.
HERRON STARS
Paul Herron, captain of the frosh '
aggregation, once more glommed in- j
dividual honors over the week-end i
of events. Friday in the frosh meet, |
Herron swam in three events, crack- J
ing three records.
Most notable of these was his j
2:13.1 time in the 220, which shat- !
tered the collegiate freshman mark 1
by over 12 seconds, and clipped j
one-tenth of a second from the old
Pacific Coast Conference record [
held by Olympic Games swimmer!
Jack Medica.
Saturday, Herron, converted into 1
a baekstroker and swimming as an
unofficial entry event, cracked the
former Stanford pool record in the
150-yard backstroke by almost two
seconds.
DUDLEY IN LEAD
Freshman Scott Dudley turned in
a record-smashing performance in
the 200-yard breaststroke, navigating
the pool six seconds faster than the
old national frosh mark. The fifth
national record now held by the
Card Encinamen is in the 300-yard
medley relay, the mark set by Jim
Canning, Dudley and Brad Young
erasing the former best time by 15
seconds.
Outstanding varsity performers
on Saturday were Roy Vitousek, who
captured laurels in both the 50 and
100-yard free-style sprints, and Hal
Weatherbe. Roy Winkelmann's im
pressive diving victory over Postada
and Grerr of the visitors, showed
him to be in rare early season form.
