# Hot and Cold Frosh Cagers Win Twice Over Week-end
## 
### 
Indications from two games played |
over the week-end were that Stan- !
lord's frosh basketball outfit would j
and perhaps would not give Cal';; |
yearlings trouble this Friday night j
at Berkeley.
Not that Coach H. B. Lee's cagers
had any difficulty in winning a pair j
of games from Visalia Junior Col- I
lege and Mission High School of j
San Francisco, because they took j
both encounters with plenty to |
spare. _ I
What happened to give this im- j
pression was that since both op
ponents were supposed to be on
about even par for weakness, the
Card freshmen sizzled in the first
game Friday night and then turned !
out to be plenty cold the following !
night. That was on offense.
DEFENSE GOOD
However, on defense the year- j
lings were about 200 per cent bet- 1
ter Saturday hight than they were
Friday, although the score Stanford
held Visalia to in the first game was
about as respectable as most coaches
would expect their clubs to per
form.
To get down to the scores, the
freshmen trampled Visalia, 52-26,
and then held Mission to an of
fensive low for the season, 29-9.
During the second game, Coach
Beeb Lee was at Berkeley scouting
the Cal Cubs, who lost to a one
point decision to Santa Clara frosh,
39-38.
The only difference between the
two games was that against Visalia

the first-year cagers were hitting
from ail angles and just about ev
erybody on the starting five con
tributed a good personal scoring
figure.
SCORE MOUNTS
Bill Cowden, who played guard
and center, netted four field goals,
while Chuck Smith tanked three
shots from the floor. Dick Ray
poured in four field goals and one
foul shot for nine points and John
Deacon meshed three shots as a sub
forward. Cowden and Ray, with
five points each, were the only
players to attempt to keep pace
with Penn against Mission.
Defensively the frosh were right in
there, taking the ball away during
passing flurires and controlling the
ball equally well off the backboard.
Ray continued to be a little dyna
mite to the offenses of both op
ponents and Cowden and Penn
were strong down around the role.
Both were set up smoothly by
Smith and Ray on clever shooting.

night. That was on offense.
DEFENSE GOOD
However, on defense the year- j
lings were about 200 per cent bet- 1
ter Saturday hight than they were
Friday, although the score Stanford
held Visalia to in the first game was
about as respectable as most coaches
would expect their clubs to per
form.
To get down to the scores, the
freshmen trampled Visalia, 52-26,
and then held Mission to an of
fensive low for the season, 29-9.
During the second game, Coach
Beeb Lee was at Berkeley scouting
the Cal Cubs, who lost to a one
point decision to Santa Clara frosh,
39-38.
The only difference between the
two games was that against Visalia

the first-year cagers were hitting
from ail angles and just about ev
erybody on the starting five con
tributed a good personal scoring
figure.
SCORE MOUNTS
Bill Cowden, who played guard
and center, netted four field goals,
while Chuck Smith tanked three
shots from the floor. Dick Ray
poured in four field goals and one
foul shot for nine points and John
Deacon meshed three shots as a sub
forward. Cowden and Ray, with
five points each, were the only
players to attempt to keep pace
with Penn against Mission.
Defensively the frosh were right in
there, taking the ball away during
passing flurires and controlling the
ball equally well off the backboard.
Ray continued to be a little dyna
mite to the offenses of both op
ponents and Cowden and Penn
were strong down around the role.
Both were set up smoothly by
Smith and Ray on clever shooting.
Indications from two games played |
over the week-end were that Stan- !
lord's frosh basketball outfit would j
and perhaps would not give Cal';; |
yearlings trouble this Friday night j
at Berkeley.
Not that Coach H. B. Lee's cagers
had any difficulty in winning a pair j
of games from Visalia Junior Col- I
lege and Mission High School of j
San Francisco, because they took j
both encounters with plenty to |
spare. _ I
