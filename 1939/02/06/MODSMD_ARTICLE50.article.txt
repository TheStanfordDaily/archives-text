# Quelle Delicatesse

THE procedure of college newspaper pub
lishing is a peculiar one. Readers clamor
for metropolitan journalism; group organizers
clamor for publicity; the whole campus yells
for a bulletin board.
To strike any valid happy medium, The
Daily must tread a rather thin line. But The
Daily does not feel itself obligated to tread
that thin line so lightly as to stay off everyone's
toes.
When circumstances warrant it, Volume 95
will exercise its editorial prerogative, indulge
a youthfully conceived affection for large type.
Emphasis of headlines will be on the news;
those who turn for highly opinionated edito
rial columns will most probably find themselves
disappointed.
They may not find themselves disappointed
when they find the emphasis on stories differ
ingâ€”the space, the headlines given to various
subjects seemingly inconsistent. They may
look for ulterior motives; but let them remeip
ber that only one story a day can be put in
column one, page one, and that news value
to the editorial staff means something different
than it does to the business staff and means
something still different than it does to those
with a purpose.
At this point, The Daily carries a torch for
no one. It most probably will be acused of
so doing before the week is over.
This much, however, has been decided.
The Daily will meet every circumstance as it
arises, neither pro-Hall, pro-Row, pro-A.S.S.U.,
nor pro-Administration.
The one thing The Daily will try to do is
find the right answer at the right moment, the
critical tongues of certain well-defined pressure
groups notwithstanding.
This doesn't mean that The Daily will not
indulge in traditional criticism or traditional
back-patting; it merely means the subject mat
ter and the conclusions may change, again de
pending upon what The Daily determines as
fact.
And this much is close to fact right now:
Stanford's little cliques would best forget
petty criticism and remember that a little im
partial co-operation can go a long way toward
erasing flaws on both sides.
