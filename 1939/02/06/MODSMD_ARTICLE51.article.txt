# Dear Jim
## 
### 
AT this point, there are always a few things
to be said; they all seem to boil down
to a grateful "thank you," in this particular case.
But behind that "thank you," there is much
more than there usually is.
In the first place, you have left The Daily,
Volume 95, one of the sweetest set-ups any
volume has ever seen. You've organized the
personnel; you've even gone so far as to see
that cuts are filed up-to-date. To say nothing of
improved relationships with the business staff.
More than that, though, of all the editors that
have occupied what turns out to be a spring
less swivel chair, you've left a deeper im
pression in the dirty, green cushion than any
body else. That impression is so deep as to
feel a bit over-size.
It's going to take a lot of hard work to make
it fit.
As a remembrance of your volume, there
always will be two things in the minds of the
staff of Volume 95: your amazing fairness in
the midst of petty cross currents and the ability

you showed to stick by convictions you were
su.re were correct.
If The Daily can continue to be sure, can
continue to have the strength of its convictions
after proper consideration, then it has learned a
long-needed lesson from you.
The Daily is going to miss the social-con
sciousness of your edits; it will miss the simple
logic that expounded your reasoning.
For all these marks to shoot at:
Thanks again, Jim.
