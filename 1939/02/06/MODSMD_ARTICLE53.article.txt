# BULL SESSION
## PROPHETS WITHOUT HONOR 
### JOHN COBBS 
AS I pointed out last week, Stanford's young intel
lectuals are nothing if not articulate. That obser
vation has been confirmed by an assortment of letters
that came in over the week-end, each intended to
settle finally the question of social consciousness on
the Farm. It appears, though, that my cultivation of
minor prophets has passed the point of diminishing
returns. The new suggestions are cither repetitious
or irrelevant, and so I concluded that I have run
through the supply of true reformers and am now get
ting only a cut. blend.
I hate to do violence to the soaring logic of these
apprentice prophets, but before I leave the question it
might be well to grab the wandering argument and
drag it back to the original subject.

It has always been fashionable for the young in
tellectuals to speak of Stanford students as fluff
brained little butterflies, and of the University as an
expensive garden where the butterflies can be pro
tected from the world. According to this theory,
undergraduates deliberately look away from social
problems, afraid the sight of them might be upsetting.
The theoiy, I believe, is itself a bit of psychopathic
cushioning, springing from a mesalliance of frustra
tion and fanaticism. The young intellectuals want
Stanford to fight, for their Causes, and when Stanford
hesitates, they call it provincial.

AS a matter of fact., Stanford students have a very
well adjusted attitude toward social problems.
We know that they exist, but we don't know what
should be done about them. And so we try to study
them as objectively as possible. In the meantime we
refuse to swallow any social patent medicine. And we
refuse to make ourselves miserable over situations we
can't help.
The true reformers have their place in this system.
They keep us from forgetting about the problems, and
they do a very good job of it. Without them, we
might slip too much into the butterfly mode of life.
But the mere fact that the prophets have a function
doesn't mean that they are right.

The big trouble with the prophets is that they all
start in agitating before they know what they want.
They yell unintelligibly, and then object because Stan
ford says simply, "What a damn shame," and lets it
go at that. Even the best of our recent correspondents
have no real program to offer. All they can say is that
something ought to be done. They don't realize that
Stanford has already granted this and is going ahead
to find out what it is that should be done.
There is also a sub-species of prophet that, con
fuses the issue. This type takes up reforming, not
because it believes in it but because it is a nice form
of exhibitionism. This is the type that climbs up on
a soap box not because it has anything to say but
because the box puts it a foot higher than anybody
else in the crowd.
The argument has now been taken over by this
brand of prophet. And so I shall retire from it quietly.
In the meantime, if any of the true martyrs think
that Stanford is keeping them from fulfilling their des
tinies, I know of a zoo that has a cage of very
hungry-looking lions.
