You know, it's no fun being funny.
Some of you may remember thai someone else
originated that line, but you know, this column does
have its drawbacks. I do have my cross to bear and
all that.
The other day more or less by accident I was
walking along the Quad with a girl I have known
very very very slightly for several months. For quite
a while I had thought it would be a fine thing if I
should get to know her somewhat less casually.
I was finding my walk along the Quad rather
pleasant.
But at one point a guy I know popped out from
some place and grabbed me. "Hey, I've got a story
for you."
Well, I had to listen to his story. It might be a
good one, and God knows I can always use a good
story. Besides how could I get away. He has a habit
—nearly everyone with a story to tell has—of grab
bing me firmly by the arm and holding on.
The girl, being in a hurry, left me there in the
trap. There I was, with four months of saying hello
charmingly all shot.
So the guy told me his story. Story! He told me a
couple of his professor's favorite gag lines, lines which
were meant to be epigramatic but which were simply
sentences building up to a rather ordinary metaphors.
Bah.

THESE MODERNS
A heterogeneous bunch of people were riding home
from the city the other night.
One of the guys said something about Esquire.
"Oh, I haven't read Esquire yet this month," one of
the females said.
She shocked one of the guys who is rather of the
old school.
"Do you mean you read Esquire! That's a man's
magazine!"
"Of course I read it. Our house mother takes it."

WONDERFUL
One of the Row boys woke up out of a very
sound sleep the other morning, cruwlcd gently down
to the awakener.
"Hey, wake mo up at 8 o'clock, will you?"
"It's 8:15 now," the awakener said.
"Oh." And the guy went back to bed and slept
blissfully all morning.
