# CAMPUS OPINION
## COLUMN COMMENT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Allow mo to throw in my humble
"two cents worth" in reaction to
the letter sent in by thinking, but
militant Andreis Deinum, who be
lieves John Cobbs to be anything
but "the salt of the earth."
Mr. Deinum believes Cobbs to be
provincial, for he speaks about
Stanford conditions or doesn't "re
alize that there is something at the
other end of Palm Drive." Really,
John does realize it, but doesn't
have us march en masse down Palm
Drive to fight the world's battles.
Cobbs is right, in my insignificant
opinion, when he says tha this Uni
versity should be a place to learn
and become better prepared that
we may fight the world's battles
when we are able. Perhaps Mr.
Deinum would have us march and
mow down the fascist element in
this country. I believe that Cobbs
would have us be more subtle and
learn what it is all about before
shooting off our faces as Deinum
has done. It takes more than shout
ing to do things—it takes sober,
planned action.
MY DEAR MR. DEINUM
But most important of all is
something dear to my heart—and
that is Deinum's proposal to hush
Cobbs up and not let him write
columns because he doesn't scream
like a fool. My dear Mr. Deinum,
you might at least appreciate the
fact that Mr. Cobbs can write col
umns and appreciate more the fact
that you are entitled to so much
column space as you had in The
Daily to answer him. Cobbs' value
is great—he is being read and, thank
God, people can either agree with
him or not, as they please. But the
fact remains that they are intelli
gent enough to think about the
problem and make their own con
clusions.
Would you, Mr. Deinum, have
Mr. Cobbs write only as you and
your militant and screaming ele
ment wish?
I believe that our columnists
should be given free rein and that
Stanford students should take them
for their value—as columnists in a
student paper reaching a provincial
circulation of about 5000 people.
A University should be taken as a
means to learn how to live a better
life. Those who actively enter into
it are interested in Stanford as a
community; their experiences here
will stimulate their later life. They
protest certain things, as you do. In
later life, the objector and person
disagreed with have a background
to meet similar conditions. Thus it
is not Cobbs who is wrong, but
those who, like you, believe that
life ends at Stanford. No—it begins
here. You can do best by making
the best of your start.
