# COBBS' CRITIC
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Cobbs' column is still suffering

j from exaggeration; there is no
J Stanford reformer "pack" making
| noise—in fact, I have no connection
1 with any group—and I did not give
. Cobbs 10 minutes of patient in
struction with a "missionary" air. I
resent being called a martyr and an
apostle! It would be an insult, if I
didn't know that he does not mean
it.
I am just the same kind of boy as
my friend John Cobbs, as far as I
know, but maybe he can show you
the opposite: he can do lots of things
in his column. I only see facts he
does not want to see, because he
does not want to be bothered. He is
so well adjusted here that I am
afraid he will have a very hard time
readjusting himself when he gets
outside of this "worry-proof" cam
pus. His column always reminded
me of that saying, "When Rome
burns ..."
Cobbs implies that we "get satis
faction out of being a martyr." He
will have to prove this, together
with backing up all the statements
!he made in Monday's column. We
j are waiting for that, contemplating
| Stone's editorial, which says, in
| other words, that you cannot believe
I anything unless you have seen it.
I Does everybody agree?

Sun spots are dark, cloud-like re
goins from 500 to 5000 miles in diam
eter which last from a day to a
week.
