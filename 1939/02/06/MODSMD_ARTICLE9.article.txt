# Chaplain Talks On Fundamentals
## 
### 
The Rev. Thomas E. Oliver gave
three fundamental questions in the
sermon "Life's Three Demands,"
which he delivered yesterday in
chapel. The first question was "What
do you want in life?" the second,
"What will you pay for it?" the
third, "What do you want it for?"
"The first question," he said, "is
really unfair because when we start
out in life we have no experience or
knowledge of the world, and cannot
really know where we are going.
Education, however, can partly pre
pare us for the future by giving us
some idea of our f uture path. The
second question is just as hard as
the first," he said. "Many times we
.see people paying more in life than
they receive.
"The third question is the most
searching because it asks for all the
reasons of the goal we have set for
ourselves," he continued. "Too often
these reasons are selfish ones. The
world would be a much better place
to live in if we would follow not only
the rules of religion, but the spirit,"
he concluded.
