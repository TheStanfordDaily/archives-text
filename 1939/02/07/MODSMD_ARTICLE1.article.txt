PROFESSIONAL jealousy, it
seems, is as prevalent
dictators as it is among radio come
dians and fan dancers. A few years
ago Mr. Mussolini conquered a
bunch of helpless blacks in Ethiopia
and started a new Roman Empire.
Not to be outdone, and yet not dar
ing to lay a hand on the Africa that
France and England guard so jeal
ously, Mr. Hitler grabbed Austria to
unite the German-speaking peoples.
Next, with a snarling threat at the
peace of Europe, the Reich demand- j
ed Czechoslovakia, and France and |
England meekly acquiesced. Ob
viously, it is up to Mr. Mussolini to
make the next move, to show Mr.
Hitler that he too can scare the
democracies into an extension of
his territorial control.

French interests on the Mediter

like he might get them. But
Chamberlain and Daladier were
men, not mice, when the show
down came, and they told Mus
solini to whistle.
This set Ihe Italian dictator to
thinking; he remembered that thou
sands of his soldiers were fighting
for the cause of Fascism in Spain,
and he decided to turn the victory
of the Insurgents into a practical
advantage for Italy. Unconcernedly
breaking an Italo-British agreement,

until hell freezes over.

one of the Balearic islands as
a base of operations, Mussoilni
can exert a formidable influence
over all that goes on in the Medi
terranean area, an influence which
can only be broken by armed op
position from another nation.
Thus Italy has maneuvered the
democracies into exactly the same
position that Germany had them in
last September. Any move to put a
stop to the Italian campaign for
Mediterranean control will mean
war in Europe. Backed by Hitler's
guarantee to aid Italy in case of
any attack against her, Mussolini
has the anti-Fascist powers right
where he wants them.
All he has to do is to tighten the
thumb-screw, and he'll get what
he's after. Hitler has nothing on

racy is a very pretty thought,
but an extremely impractical one
under the conditions of modern
warfare. Evidently Premier Juan
Negrin of the Spanish Loyalists has
discovered this ugly truth because,
after holding out since the fall of
Barcelona against government lead
ers in favor of surrender, he has fi
nally decided to bow before the
superior force of Francisco Franco.
From morning until dusk yes
terday Republican ofiicails, in
cluding the Premier, negotiated
with Insurgent brass-hats in an
effort to come to terms of sur
render. Early in the session the
defeated Loyalists asked for guar
antees that there be no reprisals
against their leaders, that Italian
and German influence be banish
ed from Spain, that a plebiscite be
held for the Spanish people to de
termine the form of their future
government.
jV'ATURALLY, Franco refused to
accede to these proposals and
demanded unconditional surrender.
However, negotiations continued
yesterday, and it appears that with
the aid of French and British diplo
mats, the Loyalists and Insurgents
will be able to come to terms. And
once again in Spain there will be
peace.
