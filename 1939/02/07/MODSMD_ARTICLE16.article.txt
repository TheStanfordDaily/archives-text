## New Positions Open To Staff Aspirants 
### 
Tryout period for those desiring
a position on the editorial staff of
The Daily will begin next week with
a meeting Tuesday at 4:30 o'clock in
Room 8 in the Journalism building.
In addition to reporters, feature
winters, and those interested in gen
eral newspaper work, cartoonists and
photographers may try out at this
time.
Sophomores and juniors have as
good a chance for advancement on
the staff as do the freshmen, and
there is a real opportunity for sen
iox-s to gain practical experience in
newspaper work.
Previous experience is not neces
sary, as there will be a training pe
riod in which the neophytes will be
taught the rudiments of newswriting
and the style which The Daily uses.
