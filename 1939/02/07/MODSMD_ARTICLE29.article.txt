# Scholarship Regulations Are Changed
## New Rules Will Avoid Incomplete 'Abuses,' Double Grade Lists 
### 
In order to avoid keeping two sets
of academic records, one for grad
uation, the other for scholarship
purposes, and to check the abuse of
the "incomplete," the Committee on
Scholarship has made the following
changes in its regulations, which are
effective as of January 3, 1939.
First: nl evaluating a student's
record, the Committee on Scholar
ship will follow the procedure used
for the quarterly directory in stat
ing progress toward graduation, and
will not record any grade points for
the marks of Ai (incomplete, Bi, Ci,
Di plus i, or inc.
In case, as a result, the student
should be placed in danger of dis
qualification, his case will be sub
ject to review by the committee.
Suitable adjustment will be made
where the reasons for an incomplete
grade, such as illness or excusable
absence from the University, are
found satisfactory.
Second: A student reinstated after
a first disqualification is required to
obtain an average of C in the quar
ter for which he is reinstated.
Thereafter he must decrease his
grade-point deficiency by an aver
age of at least two grade points pei
quarter until it falls within the
limit for students on probation or in
good standing.
He then becomes subject to the
usual rules. The former practice of
granting a special grade point al
lowance for scholarship purposes to
students reinstated after a first dis
qualification is abandoned.
The result of the foregoing two
changes in the regulations will be
that the student's record for grad
uation purposes as given in the di
rectory will also constitute his
record for scholarship purposes.
