# Lack of Funds Forces Stanford Physicists To Use Cal Laboratory
## Third Annual Fund Drive Stresses Need for Specialized Equipment, Advances in Education Methods 
### 
Two Stanford physicists must make regular trips to Berkeley because
it costs $3,000 to rent a grain of radium- I —which is exactly $.'{,ooo more than
Stanford can afford to spend.
This means that the highly significant investigations of the atom being
carried on by Professors Felix Bloch and Norris E. Bradbury must be per-

formed for the most part at the Uni-<
versity of California instead of in the I
cluttered, dingy basement of the I
Quad.
Situations like this are among the j
most cogent arguments being pre- j
sented this year in the third annual j
Stanford Fund appeal.
In spite of inconvenience and lack i
of funds, Professors Bloch and Brad- I

coveries to report sometime this

STRANGE NEUTRON
For the past seven years, physi
cists have been finding new particles
of matter with bewildering rapidity.
In 1931 they thought the atom con
tained just two parts, protons and
electrons. Now they list nine of these
fundamental particles, and they're
still hunting. One of these new par
ticles is the neutron.
These two Stanford physicists be
came interested in the neutron when
they heard something peculiar and
unexplained about it. Although it
has no electrical charge, it neverthe
less has a magnetic moment. Could
the magnetic moment, they won
dered, be an ultimate property of
matter entirely independent of elec
trical charge?
So, on the spoor of what perhaps
is a new and hitherto unsuspected
property of atoms, Professors Bloch
and Bradbury last summer began an
attempt to measure the neutron's
magnetic moment.
"NEUTRON GUN" BUILT
Stretching their meager budget
almost to the breaking point, they
built a "neutron gun" by which
they hoped to supply the necessary
bombardment of neutrons. The gun
did not prove adequate for the pur
pose, so it was used for other ex
periments.
As an alternative a gram of ra
dium, producing an equivalent neu
tron bombardment 24 hours a day
without attention, was vitally needed.
But it costs $3,000 to rent a gram
of radium for a year. And the Uni
versity had no funds available even
for so important a project.
Blocked again, Professors Bloch
and Bradbury thought of the Uni
versity of California's radiation lab
oratory with its "atom smasher"
(technically a cyclotron). Here was
a possible source of the elusive neu
tron bombardment.

tron sometime this spring. No mat

STRANGE NEUTRON
For the past seven years, physi
cists have been finding new particles
of matter with bewildering rapidity.
In 1931 they thought the atom con
tained just two parts, protons and
electrons. Now they list nine of these
fundamental particles, and they're
still hunting. One of these new par
ticles is the neutron.
These two Stanford physicists be
came interested in the neutron when
they heard something peculiar and
unexplained about it. Although it
has no electrical charge, it neverthe
less has a magnetic moment. Could
the magnetic moment, they won
dered, be an ultimate property of
matter entirely independent of elec
trical charge?
So, on the spoor of what perhaps
is a new and hitherto unsuspected
property of atoms, Professors Bloch
and Bradbury last summer began an
attempt to measure the neutron's
magnetic moment.
"NEUTRON GUN" BUILT
Stretching their meager budget
almost to the breaking point, they
built a "neutron gun" by which
they hoped to supply the necessary
bombardment of neutrons. The gun
did not prove adequate for the pur
pose, so it was used for other ex
periments.
