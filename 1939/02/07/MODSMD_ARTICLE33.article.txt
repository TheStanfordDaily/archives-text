## 
### 
Baroness Adda von Bremmer
: Bozeman was guest of honor at a
: lea given at Lagunita last week by
Miss Mary Yost. As the members
j of Lagunita ex-committee edged
| along the rug, closer and closer to
j the Baroness's chair, the tiny, dark
haired woman smiled an apology for 1
having come from Latvia, because j
"People were always embarrassed |
when they didn't know where it I
j was!"
About her, people were whisper
ing of the Baroness's many intel- (
i lectual accomplishments — that she j
! was not only an English barrister, j
' but had succeeded in passing the bar I
examinations in this country. All j
this time the baroness herself was J
making charming conversation about !
I wigs, the kind she had had to wear I
in the law courts of England .
IMPRESSED WITH FARM
Although deeply impresed with
Stanford as a whole, Baroness von
Bremmer paid her last week's visit
| to the campus in order to take ad
| vantage of the documents in the
Hoover War Library. Her work at
present takes her deep into research
on German-American diplomatic
relations.
With an English barrister's rec- '
old behind her, she recently took
her American bar exam at Texas
Christian University, where her hus
band is on the faculty. The baron
ess's law education was received in
| London, where she attended law
! school for several years after a
short period of study in Germany, j

The Baroness chuckled when she
told of the ritual, law students in
England had to go through before j
they could become barristers. "The

most important qualification," she
explained, "is eating 72 cabbage and
roast dinners with your classmates."
She expressed regrets that none of
the girls she met were studying
law. "Really, I don't blame them,
though," she laughed. "Women
lawyers are so unpopular."
