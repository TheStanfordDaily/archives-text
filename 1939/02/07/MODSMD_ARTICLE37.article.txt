# Coach Preps Hoopmen On Plays to Crack Cal For Second Big Game
## Conference Scoring Results See U.S.C.'s Vaughn in Top Position With Zonne Fifth, Burness Sixth 
### M. T. HOVEY 
Concentrating on plays that will break down the strong Cal defense,
Coach Everett Dean ran his varsity haskethallers through a light practice
yesterday.
The Indians' defense proved nearly water-tight against the Bruins, hut
C.C.L.A. cannot compare to Cal. After the comparatively easy victories

of last week-end, the Cards
find the Bears even tougher than I
before.
One of the main defects in the of- !
fense is the passing, according to ■
Dean; so he is speeding up the puss- !
ing attack. The team seems to have
come out of its scoring slump, judg
ing from the conference scoring :
ratings.
HEAVY PRACTICE TODAY
Today Dean will run the team !
through the heaviest practice of the ;
week, with emphasis on particular j
Cal plays, and .smoothing of pass
ing and other weaknesses that may i
crop up.
Reaching the half-way mark in
conference games, each team having i
played five conference contests, Don :
Liebendorfer as official scorer for j
the P.C.C. has compiled the indi- j
vidual scoring records.
It is no surprise to find Vaughn i
of U.S.C. at the top, with no one J
within 20 points of him. His team- j
mate, Goodrich, though he started j
the season as one of the best shots, '
has slipped down to twelfth place, j
Phil Zonne has moved up from a I
tie for eighth place to fifth place I
after the Bruin games, and Don j
Burness has come from twelfth to ;
sixth place.
VAUGHN AVERAGES 1(».2
Vaughn is trying to break Hank !
Luisetti's scoring record for one sea
son of conference games, but he will
have to play even better ball than j
Hank to equal the Stanford ace's j
232 points. Hank averaged 19.3 j
points a game, while Vaughn is do
ing 16.2 a game. He would have
to average 21.7 points a game for
the rest of the season to set a new
record, which he might do if he
has another field day at the expense
of U.C.L.A.
