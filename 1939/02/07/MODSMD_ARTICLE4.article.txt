### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (UP). —
President Roosevelt was rebuffed by
the Senate today when bis nomina
tion of Floyd H. Roberts to be a
federal judge in Virginia was reject
ed overwhelmingly on the ground
that he is "personally obnoxious" to
the state's two anti-New Deal sena
tors.
The question of Roberts" qualifi
cations to serve on the bench never
was raised by Senator Carter Glass
or Harry E. Byrd, D„ Va. They in
voked the rule of senatorial cour
tesy on the ground the appointment
was part of a White House "con
spiracy" to strip them of patronage
and give to Governor James H.
Price of Virginia veto power over
their future recommendations for
political posts.
