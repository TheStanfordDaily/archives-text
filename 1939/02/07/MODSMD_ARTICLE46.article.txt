WRITING a column is something
like running for President. We
both have to set up a platform
early in the campaign. Then our
term begins and we ignore it plank
by plank.
BL'T before the .volume gets too
far along we might just as well set
up a few beliefs which might stick
with us all spring. If we could get
a few nasty letters from around the
Farm concerning athletics here or
elsewhere — or the policies which
we set up—the task of thinking out
these pieces would be reduced im
measurably. We await your brick
bats with subdued hope.

BELIEVING that the personal
qualifications of a coach are more
important than his ability to pro
duce consistent winners, we will j
stick lock, stock, and barrel to the !
present Stanford coaching staff, j
Of all the local coaches, only Dink '
Templeton has been able to field na- J
tionally prominent .squads with any |
degree of regularity. Aside from I
national recognition in golf and
spasmodic bursts of pre-eminence
in sports like basketball and foot
ball, the rest of the sports calendar
is as defeat-scarred as Tommy
Fair.
For example, take the case of
Tiny Thornhill, who is practically a
cinch to be reappointed by the
B.A.C. next Saturday. He gave us
three Rose Bowl teams in as many i
years. Since that time, the wolves
have howled and howled to no
avail. But if you don't think that
Thornhill has 100 per cent support
from his players, the faculty, and
the student body, ask any one of
t hem if they can name one single j
incident where Tiny made a wrong j
move, where some tactic of his has
lowered the amount of respect
which they hold for him. Maybe
there's something to the old "Stan
ford gentleman" adage after all.
BASICALLY, the methods of the
B.A.C. in controlling Stanford's
limited athletic funds is sound.
That's our second plank. The 1
ticket-taking moguls get under our j
skin quite regularly with some of j
their pet idiosyncracies, but the!
board consists of a choice selection
of brain fodder from both within
and without the school itself. Watch
the way they handle the football
question Saturday if you're still
mad because they took your room- i
mate's student body card away last'
fall.

II WE could have one wish re
garding the athletic set-up here on
the Farm, we would take our

chances on a new set of bleachers
for Angell Field. As soon as this
department can gather together
enough propaganda on the situa
tion, Slants will present the proof
needed to prod the proper authori
ties into action — even if they have
to take 10 or 15 thousand choice
seats out of the stadium.
Angell Field is stili in the process
of maturation. Give that deeply
carved oval two more years and it'll
come close to matching the great
Fresno track for speed. Can't you
just see Clyde Jeffrey trying to
break world records in that wind
tunnel on the stadium mud flat?
>K >!<
FINALLY, for obvious reasons,
we could use a favorite term of
Mischa Auer's in describing certain
types of non-gardenia smelling
"journalism" which has been ema
nating from certain Bay district
newspapers. If men like Bill
Lejser and Harry Borba ever come
I around applying for jobs, we'd hire
them in a minute because they al
ways give Stanford a fair break,
even under adverse conditions.
As for a few of the lesser lights
of the sporting gentry, whom you
must have read with a clothes pin
on your nose regarding men like
Templeton and Thornhill, we reply
simply "Nuts" and may all their
kids end up playing basketball at
U.C.L.A.

national recognition in golf and
spasmodic bursts of pre-eminence
in sports like basketball and foot
ball, the rest of the sports calendar
is as defeat-scarred as Tommy
Fair.
For example, take the case of
Tiny Thornhill, who is practically a
cinch to be reappointed by the
B.A.C. next Saturday. He gave us
three Rose Bowl teams in as many i
years. Since that time, the wolves
have howled and howled to no
avail. But if you don't think that
Thornhill has 100 per cent support
from his players, the faculty, and
the student body, ask any one of
t hem if they can name one single j
incident where Tiny made a wrong j
move, where some tactic of his has
lowered the amount of respect
which they hold for him. Maybe
there's something to the old "Stan

the way they handle the football
question Saturday if you're still
mad because they took your room- i

enough propaganda on the situa

needed to prod the proper authori
ties into action — even if they have
to take 10 or 15 thousand choice
seats out of the stadium.
Angell Field is stili in the process
of maturation. Give that deeply
carved oval two more years and it'll
come close to matching the great
Fresno track for speed. Can't you
just see Clyde Jeffrey trying to
break world records in that wind
tunnel on the stadium mud flat?

I around applying for jobs, we'd hire
them in a minute because they al
ways give Stanford a fair break,
even under adverse conditions.
As for a few of the lesser lights
of the sporting gentry, whom you
must have read with a clothes pin

Templeton and Thornhill, we reply
simply "Nuts" and may all their
