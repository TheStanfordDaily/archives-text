# Tankmen Set For Spartans
## Thornton Confident Of Easy Varsity Win 
### 
Card swimmers will journey
: southward this coming Friday af
ternoon to meet the San Jose State
! Spartans in what promises to be a
! nip and tuck frosh battle and a
| fairly easy win for the varsity, ac
; cording to Mentor Nort Thornton.
The Prune Valley boys during
j the past week-end tied Cal's var
i sity, 37-37, and sunk the Bear year
lings, 42-25.
Thornton's main varsity worry at
I the present moment is Win Need
; ham, ace 220 and 440 free-styler,
| who is out of the water with a cold,
I and is a doubtful entry in the San
Jose meet. If he does return in
i time, he probably will be entered
j only in one race because of not be
! ing in top condition.
The coach stated that Martin
Wempy, San Jose stand-out in the
! 220 and quarter who copped both
I these races against Cal, would have
| a good chance for a repeat win in
j these two divisions if Needham is
still out. Hal Weatherbe is not to be
forgotten, though. He came through
with a 5:25.8 440 win against Athens
! Club in Needham's absence.
