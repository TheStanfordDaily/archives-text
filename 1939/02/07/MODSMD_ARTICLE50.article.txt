# Frosh Cagers to Seek Cal Scalp in Tilt Friday Night
## 
### 
Out to add the basketball "little
Big Game" series to the football
trophy which was hung up last fall,
the Farm's freshman cagers tangle
with Cal's yearlings in Berkeley as
a preliminary game to their big
brothers' till' Friday night.
Looking at the situation from all
angles, the Papooses have a team
that should be on par with the Bear
Cubs, but Coach H. B. Lee will
probably have to rely upon eight
men to carry the brunt of the
game.,.
Bob Penn, who has rung up a
sensational high - scoring record
over the past three weeks in week
ly double bills, undoubtedly will be
Stanford's key man again in any
scoring attack, while Cal's defense
at the same time will probably be
centered on the lanky forward.
PENN HARD TO STOP
If their opponents should stop
Penn—which would be a hard task
to do unless u Cub giant were to be
placed on him, the frosh will have
Bill Cowden and Dick Ray to take
care of the point-getting assign
ment. Ray has about a nine-point
average pei game lor the season,
while Cowden has equaled that and
led the scorers in several encoun
ters.
However, Cowden's worth will be
tested more thoroughly in his abil
ity to control the ball both de
fensively and offensively off the
backboard. Besides that, Cowden
rates as the best of Lee's guards
around the hole and has taken care

fof several of Stanford's high-scor
! ing opponents by limiting them to
j but one or two field goals. Ray is a
! clever dribbler and passes well into
i the hole for his team-mates, as well
! as being able to find the basket
! himself.
In the important guard roles are
Chuck Smith and Ollie Hamlin —
I not tall but very important cogs in
' Lee's little. Red Machine of the
I courts. Smith is an excellent ball
handler, while Hamlin rates as one
of the best of the team's defensive
I men. Both are good shooters, ring
ing up from two ot four timely bas
j kets between them in most games.
Lew Reese, whose inability to hit
the basket of late has forced him
| to the second string, Bob Scharbaeh,
1 and Verne Hoffman will be the few
players whom Lee will use in sub
i roles, unless the freshmen should
! wax the Cal outfit in the early
j stages of the game to warrant re
! placements.
Lee scouted the Bear frosh in
I their game with Santa Clara fresh
; men last Saturday night and will
' work on ways and means of stop
| ping their offense and making his
j own team's attack work against
i their defense this week ir. practice.

In the important guard roles are
Chuck Smith and Ollie Hamlin —
I not tall but very important cogs in
' Lee's little. Red Machine of the
I courts. Smith is an excellent ball
handler, while Hamlin rates as one
of the best of the team's defensive
I men. Both are good shooters, ring
ing up from two ot four timely bas
j kets between them in most games.
Lew Reese, whose inability to hit
the basket of late has forced him
| to the second string, Bob Scharbaeh,
1 and Verne Hoffman will be the few
players whom Lee will use in sub
i roles, unless the freshmen should
! wax the Cal outfit in the early
j stages of the game to warrant re
! placements.
Lee scouted the Bear frosh in
I their game with Santa Clara fresh
; men last Saturday night and will
' work on ways and means of stop
| ping their offense and making his
j own team's attack work against
i their defense this week ir. practice.
Out to add the basketball "little
Big Game" series to the football
trophy which was hung up last fall,
the Farm's freshman cagers tangle
with Cal's yearlings in Berkeley as
a preliminary game to their big
brothers' till' Friday night.
Looking at the situation from all
angles, the Papooses have a team
that should be on par with the Bear
Cubs, but Coach H. B. Lee will
probably have to rely upon eight
men to carry the brunt of the
game.,.
Bob Penn, who has rung up a
sensational high - scoring record
over the past three weeks in week
ly double bills, undoubtedly will be
Stanford's key man again in any
scoring attack, while Cal's defense
at the same time will probably be
centered on the lanky forward.
PENN HARD TO STOP
If their opponents should stop
Penn—which would be a hard task
to do unless u Cub giant were to be
placed on him, the frosh will have
Bill Cowden and Dick Ray to take
care of the point-getting assign
ment. Ray has about a nine-point
average pei game lor the season,
while Cowden has equaled that and
led the scorers in several encoun
ters.
However, Cowden's worth will be
tested more thoroughly in his abil
ity to control the ball both de
fensively and offensively off the
backboard. Besides that, Cowden
rates as the best of Lee's guards
around the hole and has taken care

fof several of Stanford's high-scor
! ing opponents by limiting them to
j but one or two field goals. Ray is a
! clever dribbler and passes well into
i the hole for his team-mates, as well
! as being able to find the basket
! himself.
