# Or Build a Railing

### 
STANFORD has had the unfortunate expe
rience of passing through a series of inci
dents during the past year which have opened
the way to short-sighted controversies between
overheated factions.
The first of these was the widely quoted
dictum that "Stanford has no school spirit." The
word was passed to the city papers, alumni
started rumors. Editorials and Campus Opin
ion letters boiled with indignation.
The next highlight came this fall when it
was found that school spirit didn't extend to
short skirts. Both sides made statements they
have since regretted.
More recently, there has been the feud be
tween those indignant with Stanford's lethargy
toward social problems and those indignant at
being accused of denying the reality of exist
ing situations.
Once again, both sides have gone to the
extreme of making statements they can't main
tain.
Whether this is a mistake or not is difficult
to deleimine. Certainly, introspective exami
nation never hurt any institution. Yet when
carried to such an extent, the co-ordinated pat
tern necessary to successful accomplishment
becomes hampered by short-run mole hills.
It was with this in mind that The Daily yes
terday announced a change in emphasis from
editorials to legitimate or straight news.
With respect to those goals toward which
the whole University is pointed, The Daily will
try to exercise a critical eye, yet not so critical
as completely to break existing mechanism
for achievement.
At times, policy may fluctuate considerably
from this view; but only because editorial
board feels such to be the best way to meet
a given situation.
In the near future, there will be plenty of
situations over which Stanford can lose its
head, if it wants to. The appointment of a
football coach this month is the nearest of
them.
And before Stanford goes overboard again,
it should read an instruction book for operating
a collapsible lifeboat.
