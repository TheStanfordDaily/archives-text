PICKING up the threads of the story of the
third annual Stanford appeal, currently be
ing made for the benefit of certain needy
Stanford projects, The Daily on the front page
today gives a few more of the details of why
two Farm professors have to rush up to Berke
ley to finish research in physics.
That isn't the only story descriptive of the
conditions under v/hich research must labor—
there are many more of them and all of them
are equally good.
From time to time during the week, the rest
of those stories will be printed.
That Stanford needs money, in small quan
tities, given for such specific purposes will
appear obvious.
The Stanford Fund is equipped adequately
to disburse money to relieve professors of the
inconvenience of trotting to other institutions
for aid.
At the end of the week, Stanford's senior
class will organize to aid the fund appeal—no
other undergraduates will be asked specifically
to participate.
And when the seniors organize, the machin
ery will be completed.
When it starts moving, let Stanford and Stan
ford's alumni remember that it is the only ap
peal for funds for the University as a whole.
