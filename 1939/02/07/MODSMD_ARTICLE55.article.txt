STANFORD democracy begins to undergo
its first 1939 test today, when nominating
blanks filter into the proper receptacles on the
Law Steps.

The elections coming up are not, however,
the big ones of spring quarter, when Row and
Hall politicians pull out cigars, assume an un
natural secretiveness, huddle in smoke-filled
caucuses to line up respective deals.
In the present instance, line-ups have been
drawn quietly and smoothly. The Halls have
their men; the Row has its candidates; the
women have their nominating committee. Each
has known for some time who is going to run
and for what. So far, the procedure has been
according to schedule.
But the elections, even though they will not
approach major importance, will show whether
or not Stanford is as interested in democracy
as it traditionally claims.
Most important posts that the elections will
fill are those on Ex Committee, the head and
assistant yell leaders for next year. No one's
future is exactly mortgaged upon the outcome.
Yet, despite the unimportance of the elec
tion, despite the results, the student body will
show whether it is interested in running itself
or whether it is interested in being run by some
small agency.
A fairly good index to that interest will be
the number of votes cast, which will also show
whether or not marking a ballot is too simple
a task for the college mind.
