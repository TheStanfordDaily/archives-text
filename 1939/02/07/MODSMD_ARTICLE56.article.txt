# BULL SESSION
## CLEAN-UP CAMPAIGN 
### JOHN COBBS 
f~|NE of the beloved brethren stormed in to lunch
yesterday looking like something bx-ought up by a
dredge. As he splashed down across the table he
raised his stuccoed face to me. "When are you going
to squawk about that damn library parking lot?" he
snarled. "It's just a pocket edition of the Everglades."
"It's awful," I agreed. "But it's sort of petty. This
is the time of the week for a really great subject,
something that will leave the reader a finer and
cleaner man."

"Petty hell! It's the biggest pile of mud since the
Mesozoic age. And if you think your reader can stay
fine and clean if he goes within a block of it, then go
down and take a look for yourself."
I was already familiar with the parking lot be
cause I have to do an adagio dance through its puddles
every morning. But I dropped around yesterday after
noon to study it scientifically. I found that my brother
had not exaggerated.

the surface is a layer of bright tan mud, about
the consistency of Encina soup. Hidden beneath
is a treacherous bottom, which in some places rises
almost to the surface and in others falls off to un
sounded depths. Cars maneuver through the slush,
setting up tidal waves which engulf pedestrians.
Among the students, strange stories ai-e whispered
about the parking lot. It is said that a sea serpent
lives at the bottom of one of the holes. It is reported
that careless undergraduates have disappeared in the
neighborhood. One Encina boy swears that he saw
police dragging the lot for a body on a recent night.

But even without the sea serpent, the lot is
enough to cause a revolution. Students splash through
its ooze, fearful that if they slip into the quicksand
they will wind up in a geology museum a million
years from now. Pedestrians ram each other on a
narrow isthmus. Everyone wipes mud out of his hair
and curses.
And adding to our smouldering class hate is the
paved faculty lot across the way. Neatly macadam
ized, scientifically drained, it stands like the Bastile,
a reminder of our oppression.
I don't like dire prophecies, but the trend is ob
vious. If the University doesn't gravel the lot, there
will be a revolution. If this be mud-slinging, we are
used to it.
