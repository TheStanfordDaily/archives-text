A young lady, obviously a stranger to our little
Farm, went up to the cigar counter of the Union the
other day and asked if she could cash a check there.
I think it is unnecessary to say of a young lady
new to our campus that she seemed not only young
but beautiful. She did.
Finding that she could cash a check there, she wrote
one out and gave it to the fellow behind the counter.
He looked at it and noticed she hadn't endorsed
it.
Then he looked at her. In his eyes there must
have been the wrong kind of a look, because when
he said, "May I have your address?" she froze him
on the spot. He never saw anything get so cold so
quick.

The Daily got this card through the mail. The
editor read it..
"This doesn't make any sense. Why don't you use
it in your column," he said to me.
All right, maybe it doesn't make sense. But it's
quaint.
"Dear Sirs:
"Stanford women must have reached a new low
point. The Stanford Bookstore now sells scratch pads
which drawings on the covers which look like any
thing but 'Stanford Ladies'."

TERSE
That this happened at Yale is incidental.
But one of the boys back there has a mother who
knits. Or who once knat, at least.
Her first thing took her a long time. It was a
scarf for her son. At Yale. She would tell her
friends, "Look how well it's coming. Aren't you proud
of me I am."
Yes, her friends said, we arc very proud of you.
You arc undoubtedly an artist and my, how indus
trious.
That went on for quite a while.
Finally she finished it and shipped it oil to her
son, along with a chicken or something.
In a few days she got a letter from her son thank
ing her for the chicken.
She was furious. In a pleasant sort of way. She
sent a letter post haste (I understand they still send
letters post haste back there) to her son. What kind
of filial gratitude is this, she wrote. I work my
fingers to the bone knitting you a scarf, and all you
can write about is chickens.
By return mail came this brief post-card:
''Dear mother:
"It sheds."

But one of the boys back there has a mother who
knits. Or who once knat, at least.
Her first thing took her a long time. It was a
scarf for her son. At Yale. She would tell her
friends, "Look how well it's coming. Aren't you proud
of me I am."
Yes, her friends said, we arc very proud of you.
You arc undoubtedly an artist and my, how indus
trious.
That went on for quite a while.
Finally she finished it and shipped it oil to her
son, along with a chicken or something.
In a few days she got a letter from her son thank
ing her for the chicken.
She was furious. In a pleasant sort of way. She
sent a letter post haste (I understand they still send
letters post haste back there) to her son. What kind
of filial gratitude is this, she wrote. I work my
fingers to the bone knitting you a scarf, and all you
can write about is chickens.
By return mail came this brief post-card:
''Dear mother:
"It sheds."

A young lady, obviously a stranger to our little
Farm, went up to the cigar counter of the Union the
other day and asked if she could cash a check there.
I think it is unnecessary to say of a young lady
new to our campus that she seemed not only young
but beautiful. She did.
Finding that she could cash a check there, she wrote
one out and gave it to the fellow behind the counter.
He looked at it and noticed she hadn't endorsed
it.
Then he looked at her. In his eyes there must
have been the wrong kind of a look, because when
he said, "May I have your address?" she froze him
on the spot. He never saw anything get so cold so
quick.

The Daily got this card through the mail. The
editor read it..
"This doesn't make any sense. Why don't you use
it in your column," he said to me.
All right, maybe it doesn't make sense. But it's
quaint.
"Dear Sirs:
"Stanford women must have reached a new low
point. The Stanford Bookstore now sells scratch pads
which drawings on the covers which look like any
thing but 'Stanford Ladies'."

That this happened at Yale is incidental.
