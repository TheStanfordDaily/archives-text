# Punch Lines, Rich Chorales Highlight Play

Federal Theater's "RUN. LITTLE
CIHLLUN," currently playing at the
Alcazar in San Francisco.
When it was produced a few years
ago, Dußose Hay ward and George
Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" be
came the football of critics who
couldn't decide whether it was opera
or folk drama. It was uniformly
agreed, however, that "Porgy and
Bess" was excellent theater.
A production less doubtful In
category but no less successful is
Hall Johnson's "Run, Little Chil
lun." Though it lays no valid
claim to opera, it achieves the rec
ommendation of superbly moving
folk drama.
After closing a run in Los Angeles
that packed the house every night
for months, "Run, Little Chillun,"
with its all-Negro cast of Federal
Theater actors and musicians, moved
to San Francisco, where a repeti
tion of the earlier triumph has filled
the Alcazar with a varied audience.
CHOIR SCORES
Principal strength of the show
lies in the choral arrangements of
Hall Johnson and the voice num
bers by his choir. The orchestra is
a little corny, but the vocal back
ground is integrated wifh assurance
and all the deep, underlying rich
ness of faith that a negro group can
give spirituals.
A touch of native savagery in the
ballet sequences jars audiences into
the realization that, with these peo
ple, the veneer of civilization is not
too thick.
Startlingly good lines draw laughs
and occasionally the dialogue is
packed with the punch of epigram.
"Sin ain't what you done. It's how
you feel after you don done it."
LARGE CAST
A cast numbering over a hundred
has few distinct standouts. Justitia
Davis as Sulamae, whose revenge
ends as retribution, is well por
trayed. William Harris as Deacon
Redd and Martha Smith, Mag,
Sulamai s mother, overshadow other
principals.
Choreography of the two-act pro
duction is directed by Ivan MarkofT;
Hall Johnson, author, supervises
music; Gordon C. Lange, formerly
at Stanford, is listed as associate
director. —Hutchinson
