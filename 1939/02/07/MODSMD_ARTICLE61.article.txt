# CAMPUS OPINION
## NO FUN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
When the men (I should say
"morons") in front of a fraternity
Tuesday afternon hurled a snow
ball at my car, breaking a window,
the glass of which narrowly missed
injuring my small daughter, I was
too furious to much more than
sputter incoherently.
Perhaps I have no sense of humor.
Perhaps it is just heaps of fun to
see how close one can come to caus
ing a smash-up. No doubt little
Audrey would have laughed and
laughed had she been there. Espe
cially if the driver had been hit and
there had been a beautiful crash
with lots and lots of blood.
For heaven's sake, use some judg
ment.
