# History ... 1939
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
A GREAT number of us clearly
remember an evening late in
October 10 years ago when our
fathers came home from work look
ing worried, talking exictedly about
a panic on the stock mai'ket. That
was in 1929, the year of the crash
which started the greatest financial
depression this country has ever
known.
Unemployment was one ol the
greatest problems that grew out of
the abdication of prosperity. Presi
dent Hoover fumbled embarrassedly
with the question of how to put
10,000,000 Americans back to work.
The country wanted action, and in
1932 it got it when Franklin D.
Roosevelt inaugurated the New
Deal program of relief.
# * *
r INHERE was only one hitch in
the works — somehow, some
time, the relief appropriations had
to be paid for. Itfnorinff this as
pert of the situation, the President
continued to spend, and the ros
ter of Republicans and economical
anti-New Dealers continued to
tfrow. By 1939, 10 years after the
crash, a formidable opposition
faced Roosevelt in his attempt to
get his relief proposals through
Congress.
Shortly after the bill was pre
sented, the opposition showed its
teeth and nipped $150,000,000 from
the appropraition. Congress passed
it in that condition and sent it to
the President, who signed it silent
ly -
All at once, yesterday, he started
making noise.
* »!« $
IN the name of human decency,
ran the burden of Roosevelt's
song, Congress must grant the orig
inal sum asked for relief projects,
or millions of Americans will be
faced with hardship and privation.
Pulling taut the heartstrings of the ,
voters and the nerves of Congress
men soon up for re-election, the
President claimed that a million
men will have to be dropped from
relief roles if the legislators don't
come through.
Ix?ad by Representative YYood
rum, who initiated the cut from
the original bill, anti-New Deal
ers pooh-poohed the dire predic
tions of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Thus the battle over government
expenditures goes on. After
more than seven years of spending
we are still too close to the forest
to make out whether success or
failure lurks among the trees.

11 OPES for an end to the Civil
War in Spain flew into reverse
yesterday when the Loyalists decid
ed to fight on to the bitter end.
Their demand that there be no re
prisals against Republican leaders
in case of surrender was rejected by
Franco, and the army of Premier
Juan Negrin settled down to the
business of defending the one-fourth
of the peninsula it. still holds from
the hordes of Fascism.
Despite French and British efforts
to secure negotiations for peace, the
Loyalist leaders decided to carry on
the fight rather than submit, to the
unconditional surrender demanded
by Franco.
* * *
IT IS obvious to anyone over
the age of eight that France and
England arc trying to bring an
end to the Spanish Civil War, not
because of any love for the Span
iards, but because they fear the
permanent establishment of Ital
ian influence on the Iberian pen
insula. Peace in Spain would rob
Mussolini of his excuse for keep
ing a healthy supply of troops and
planes there, so near to French
colonics in Africa and the British
route to India.
Having failed to talk the Loyalists
into surrendering and the Rebels in
to making concessions, the European
democracies arc set to try another
line of attack. Britain and France
will probably declare their willing
ness to recognize the government of
Generalissimo Francisco Franco if
and when the Italian and German
forces retire from Spain.
Far from attempting to preserve
the ideals of democracy in the na
tions of Europe or maintaining the
liberty of the Spanish people, the
democratic powers are aiming to
protect themselves and their in
terests first, last, and always.
