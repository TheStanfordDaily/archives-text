## 
### 
VATICAN CITY, Feb. 7 (UP).—
Pope Pius XI canceled all audiences
today but the slight fever which put
him to bed last night has abated
and Vatican officials hoped he would
be able to resume his normal routine
tomorrow or Thursday.
Because he desires to participate
in the week-end celebration of the
17th anniversary of his accession to
the papal throne, the Pope was more
than usually amenable to doctors'
orders that he obtain complete rest.
Prelates disclosed the slight cold he
had contracted did not worry church
officials so much as the Pope's heart
ailment, of which he has suffered
recent relapses. There has been a
slight recurrence of his cardiac asth
ma on this occasion, a high Vatican
source told the United Press, but it
was emphasized the Pope's condition
is not serious.
