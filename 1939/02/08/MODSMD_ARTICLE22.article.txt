# Excom Gives Recognition To Skiers
## Liability in Accident Case lo Be Taken By team Members 
### 
Climaxing a three-year campaign
by the Stanford Ski Club, Ex Com
mittee last night voted unanimously
its recognition of skiing as a minor
sport.
Sole restriction was the provision
that no member of the ski team be
eligible for competition unless he
signs a preliminary release absolv
ing the University and the Associat
ed Students from any responsibility
in case of accident.
The controversy made its first, ap
pearance of the year at the meeting
last week, when it was decidcd to
postpone final action until the
committee had been advised by
Coach Harry Maloney, director of
minor sports.
Last night Mr. Maloney recom
mended recognition of skiing, al
though he said he thought skiing
and rifle should be required to buy
their block circle S.
"Making them pay would distin
guish skiing from the long-estab
lished minor sports such as boxing,"
he said.
Mr. Maloney pointed out he no
longer opposes recognition of the
sport as he did last year, when he
"considered it a mushroom growth."
He said that was the argument he
used last year against Millie Meyer,
Swiss president of the Ski Club,
whom he termed " a progressive
little cuss."

that all the other classes have both
a man and a woman on the com

Although the graduate women are

Climaxing a three-year campaign
by the Stanford Ski Club, Ex Com
mittee last night voted unanimously
its recognition of skiing as a minor
sport.
Sole restriction was the provision
that no member of the ski team be
eligible for competition unless he
signs a preliminary release absolv
ing the University and the Associat
ed Students from any responsibility
in case of accident.
The controversy made its first, ap
pearance of the year at the meeting
last week, when it was decidcd to
postpone final action until the
committee had been advised by
Coach Harry Maloney, director of
minor sports.
Last night Mr. Maloney recom
mended recognition of skiing, al
though he said he thought skiing
and rifle should be required to buy
their block circle S.
"Making them pay would distin
guish skiing from the long-estab
lished minor sports such as boxing,"
he said.
Mr. Maloney pointed out he no
longer opposes recognition of the
sport as he did last year, when he
"considered it a mushroom growth."
He said that was the argument he
used last year against Millie Meyer,
Swiss president of the Ski Club,
whom he termed " a progressive
little cuss."

ELECTION ASSISTANTS: The

SPEECH BUREAU FUNDS: With

the year, Chairman Bram Gorter of

tee the bureau needed $96.50 for
legitimate expenses, but could get

$65.
The bureau's meager income will
make up the difference, he said,
pointing out that he had received a
$3 check this week from the Horse
fly Breakfast Club, at which a
speaker appeared recently.
DEBATE FUNDS: Bob Putnam,
debate manager, appeared with a
request for $50 in addition to the
