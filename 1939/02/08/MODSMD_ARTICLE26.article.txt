## 
### 
Trying a case involving an impor
tant phase of radio broadcasing, the
Moot Court in i s February 6 session
handed down a decision that may
foretell future actions taken by ac
tual courts concerning unfair com
petition and property rights of radio.
The case dealt with the granting
of exclusive broadcasting rights by
the Pittsburg Pirates to General
Mills, Inc., for all games played in
Pittsburg. The controversy arose
when a radio company placed ob
servers on nearby hills and reported
the games. Whether or not the radio
company could be enjoined from
broadcasting outside the park was
tried by the Moot Court.
After the case was reviewed in a
two-hour session, Judge Robert Syer
of the San Jose Superior Court ruled
that broadcasting from outside the
park constituted unfair competition
and that broadcasting is the same as
property and enjoys the same rights.
"Therefore, the radio company can
be enjoined from broadcasting," con
cluded Judge Syer.
Arguing for the Pittsburg Pirates
were Adele Walsh Moran and Rob

ert Adams, Jr. Opposition lawyers
were David Folsom and Andy Spears, j
This trial was the last in the semi- :
final series of the annual Moot Court |
i competition. From the 12 semi-final- |
ists, four will be selected for the j
| final trial to be hold in the spring. ,
I Final winners are awarded $100.
