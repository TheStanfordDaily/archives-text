# Farm May Be Host to Coast Debate Group
## Issue to Be Decided By Forensie Squad In Mock Congress 
### 
| Members of the debate squad
i convened yesterday afternoon in the
l form of a Congress to decide wheth
er or not lo hold the fifth annual
Pacific Coast Debate Congress at
Stanford later this year, but re
! served final decision until later.
The mock Congress was proposed
last week by Leland Chapin, var
| .sity debate coach, in order that he
: might actually see a meeting con
ducted under the debate congress
I procedure. After yesterday's trial,
i Mr. Chapin expressed a favorable
impression and suggested that the
I group hold another similar meeting
; Thursday, February 16, to discuss
j a single topic, "Production for Use."
With Harry Horton in the chair,
j yesterday's session was confronted
with three bills. Jack Grover sub
â€¢ mitted one advocating complete
\ disarmament in the United States,
George Cannon framed a bill which
; would set up a government arma
ment control board and Lyn Pol
and's proposal recommended one
hour a week of compulsory mili
; tary training for all high school
boys. The first and last bills were
defeated after much discussion,
but Cannon's control board met
with the favor of Congress.
If members of the Debate Council
and Mr. Chapin express approval of
I the possibilities of such procedure,
| April will see over 200 representa-
I tives of Pacific Coast colleges and
j junior colleges flocking to the Farm
| for a two-day sojourn. Definite de
i cision on this proposal will prob
! ably be made following the next
| trial congress.
