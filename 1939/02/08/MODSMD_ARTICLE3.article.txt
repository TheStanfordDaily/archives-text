# $650 Needed To Aid Farm Laboratory
## Electric Engineering Department Lacks Funds For Television 
### 
It may take an electrical engineer
to comprehend television, but the
humblest layman has no trouble un
derstanding the situation when he
hears that a mere $650 is keeping
Stanford University from becoming a
leader in television research.
This sum is all that is needed to
initiate actual experimental work in
sending and receiving signals in the
Stanford electrical engineering lab
oratory, according to Professor Fred
E. Terman, executive head of the
department.
ONE EXAMPLE
This is just one example of Stan
ford's need for funds. It is one of
the arguments being presented in the
third annual Stanford Fund appeal
now under way.
Television investigations at Stan
ford started when the Radio Cor
poration of America, through the
influence of Ralph R. Beal, '12, su
pervisor of RCA i - esearch, gave the
University's electrical engineering
department $300 worth of television
equipment. Included in the gift were
a 12-inch cathode-ray image tube or
kinescope, for reproducing television
pictures, and a monoscope.
Actual materials needed for set
ting up this apparatus will cost about
$200, according to Professor Ter
man.
EQUIPMENT NEEDED
"We will have to build electrical
amplifiers and synchronizing equip
ment, scanning generators, power
sources for the tubes, and testing
equipment," he said.
"A lot of labor will have to be put
in, and we need about $450 for a
television fellowship for next year.
With this we could attract well
qualified students of television."
Now that the RCA equipment is
already on hand, $650 is all that is
needed to finance installation of a
television unit. If they get this sum,
Stanford electrical engineers prob
ably can lead all other university
communication laboratories of the
country in this new, rapidly devel
oping field.
