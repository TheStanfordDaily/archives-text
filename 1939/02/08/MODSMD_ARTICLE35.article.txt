WILL women ever make a place
for themselves as sports writers?
Despite the doubt which might be
stirred up deep in your craniums,
the prospects of such a dastardly
occurrence are upon us. In fact,
there's an embryo trying to hatch
l here in our own bailiwick. Her
name is Marge Hovey, feminine
sounding anyway#and she's the tom
boy who got a by-line as M. T.
Hovey in this very rag yesterday
morning for a good piece of work on
a basketball story .

WHAT worries me is the fact the
amazons have found something new
which isn't exactly tough for them
to take. Being around all the hand
some slugs of the vicinity is what
all the gals seem to dream about,
anyway. So what better way can
they find than easing in through
the one channel which was sup
posed to be sacred?
This female Hovey was warned to
avert any inferences about ruffles
and color schemes just before she
trekked over to surprise Don Lieb
endorfer ,another man's man.
"Now don't say a word about
Zonne's profile" we warned, "or
you're fired."
The little creature smiled.
"Oh, no," she cooed, "but is it all
right to say that he looked like the
kind of boy who would be nice to
his mother?"
We swooned.
MAYBE you read about the mid
western school where the football
team threw out bodily all the males
who tried to get into secret practice.
There was a bit of a feud between
certain elements which made the
male sports scribes something like
stale herring, and nobody loves a
stale herring. Consequently the burly
brutes put the squitch on the lads of
the press and finally wiped out the
last of the male staff.
Well, the editors weren't to be out
done without a fight; so they selected
a cute little doll and hurried her off
to the next practice. It wasn't long
before the ball players quieted down
to a purr. And the local school press
had its daily comments though it was
slightly tainted with the woman's
angle on curly hair, taffeta, lace, etc.,
etc.
Then there's the famous woman
sports writer from Southern Califor
nia somewhere, about whom I have
heard much but read little. Those in
the know tell me that she had more
genuine acquaintance with athletics
than any of the better men there
abouts. It may be.
After all, if they can box, wrestle,
and play football with the firemen,
they might just as well ease the rest
of us unfortunates out of a job. Still,
what if we had a family to support?

IT S A REAL pro blem, no less;
but way back in the maze that is my
mind, there lies an inkling of hope.
The remaining gentlemen of the
spoils press will form some sort of
an Anti-Amazon Committee which
shall rule specifically that all the fe
males under its jurisdiction must
cover all the angles of any particular
sport. There will be no easy writing
jobs under the A.A.C. And there's
where the sweet ones will, like the
Arabs, fold their tents and silently
steal away.
If they have to take the bitter with
the sweet, how in heck will they ever
get a dressing room story? Who
would get the official weights at all
the weighing-in ceremonies? It
would U.int their minds something
fearful if they had to listen to be
tween-the-halves "pep" talks.
Aw, why do women like Hovey
have to worry us anyway?
