# Card Hoopmen Not Far Behind Cal in League
## Friday Basketball Game May Put Farm In Conference Lead 
### 
When Stanford's cagers truck in
to the Berkeley gym Friday evening
the situation is going to be some
what the same as it was last year
when Cal invaded the Pavilion for
the second Big Game of the 19158
season.
At that time Cal was leading the
league race with five victories and
no defeats while Stanford trailed in
second place because the Bears had
plastered an upset defeat on them
in the first Big Game and U.S.C.
had nosed out a disputed one-point
victory.
It was the crucial point of the
season, but Hank Luisetti peppered
28 points through the netting and
the Cards started toward the league
lead by slaughtering the Bears.
ONE FROM TOP
Last year they were two games
out of first place when they smoth
ered Cal. Tonight they are but one
game from the top — but that one
game is infinitely greater than last
year's two games. Cal has the team
this year, and Stanford has the
hopes.
The Bear's quintet of Ogilvie,
Chalmers, Thomas, Bickerton, and
Biggerstaff is playing better ball
now than when they defeated Stan
ford two weeks ago. Last week-end
Coach Nibs Price's athletes depos
ited St. Mary's and Santa Clara in
the rubbish pile, and the two Cath
olic schools don't have teams of prep
school caliber either.
Coach Everett Dean has whipped
together a combination that last
week-end showed the best form the
Cards have displayed all season,
aside from the first U.S.C. game, but
they still don't figure with the
gargantuan Bears.
COPSEY IN LINE-UP
In his quest of a scoring punch
Dean betvhed Bill Rapp and Bob
Burnett against U.C.L.A. and sent
Harlan "Bomber" Copsey and Dick
Lyon into the breach. Copsey, fill
ing in at forward opposite Captain
Phil Zonne, scored 14 digits Friday
night and is always alert and ag
gressive.
Lyon, besides ringing up a hand
ful of field goals, did some good re
bounding against the Bruins and his
7-inch nudge in height over Bur
nett. makes him a threat to prevent
Cal from clean sweeping off the
backboard again this week as they
did in the first game.
Kenny Davidson and Don Bur
ness, the two sophomore mainstays,
played their usual steady games.
Burness moved into contention in
tlie individual scoring race by drop
ping in 23 points against the Uclans.
WILLIAMS WILL PLAY
Another sophomore, Don Wil
liams, has catapulted himself into
the front rank with his hard, clever
playing. Williams didn't even break
into a majority of the practice
games or the first Cal contest ,but
it looks as if he's destined to play
a leading part this week-end.
Bob Burnett sank five field goals
against the Bruins Saturday night
and Dean has high hopes that the
mighty midget has finally regained
his shooting eye. Despite his lack
of height for rebounding, Burnett
is easily the best shot among the
guards—when he isn't in a slump.
Saturday night the Cal Aggies in
vade the Pavilion for what will con
stitute a sort of anti-climax to the
week-end.
