### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (UP). —
President Roosevelt tonight struck
back at the Senate for its rejection
of his nomination of Floyd Roberts
to the Virginia federal bench, chal
lenging the constitutional right of
one or two senators to usurp White
House nominating powers by in
voking the rule of "senatorial cour
tesy."
Roberts' nomination was l'ejected
yesterday, 72 to 9. His qualifica
tions were not questioned by Sen
ators Carter Glass and Harry F.
Byrd of Virginia. They pronounced
him "personally objectionable" on
the ground he was associated with a
"conspiracy" by the White House to
deprive them of their patronage.
The 81-year-old Glass accused the
President of having given veto
power over the nominations by him
self and Byrd to Governor James
Prive of Virginia, a charge which
Mr. Roosevelt and the governor de
nied. Both senators invoked the rule
of senatorial courtesy, which rarely
is over-ridden.
