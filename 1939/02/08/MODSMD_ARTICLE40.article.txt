# H. B. Lee Scouts Cal Cubs For Friday Night Game
## 
### 
Scouting on your own hook is |
much better than getting reports I
from the grapevine, Coach H. B. j
"Beeh" Lee is probably figuring J
while getting his Stanford frosh |
cagers ready for their game with j
Cal's Bearcubs at Berkeley Friday j
night.
Forced to go the limit in an un- j
successful try to grab a close deci- J
sion out of the fire with Santa i
Clara freshmen, the Cal yearlings
put on such a fine performance for
Lee, who scouted the game, that he
believes he has detected several out
standing defensive weaknesses.
FIRST OF THREE
If he has, Lee can be counted up
on to use the first-hand information
to his best advantage when the two
traditional first-year rivals clash in
the first of a three-game series Fri- j
day night which will be continued ]
March 3 and 4.
Cal's frosh lost 39-38 to Santa
Clara's yearlngs although sporting a
22-13 advantage at half-time. Stan- j
ford figures well on defense and ;
should test the Cubs' offense.
Both outfits will be relatively on
even terms as far as height average i
goes. Bob Penn will be the tallest i
man on the floor at 6:5 but three
Papooses who are less than 6 feet
will partially nullify that advantage.
CAL'S LAFAILLE
Merv Lafaille. brother of Stan
ford's Leon, is the scoring threat of
the Cal offense. He mixes up one- j
handed push shots with medium'
long shots and plays on about the |
same order as does his brother. He
is 5:10.
The other forward is Bob Nor
man, who is the first of three 6:2
players. Norm is a hot and cold
player and specializes in a right
handed hook shot and plays a sound ]
floor game. Bob Biles, 6:2 centcr, is !
a consistent pivot player and ex
cells on controlling the ball off
both backboards on rebound shots.

Irwin Diamond, 6:10 spark of the I
club, rates as a lair long shot artist !
. I
and acts as a steadying influence on j
his team-mates. His guard team- j
mate is Bouhaben, who at 6:2 is!
good at controlling the ball on re- j
bound shots and is an effective I
guard.
SHORTER MEN
Dick Ray, OUie Hamlin and Chuck |
Smith are less than 6 feet, but Bill !
Cowden at 6:2' i; and Penn at 6:5!
will partially offset the disadvan- j
tage.
Lee figures on a tough drill this
afternoon and a tapering off work
out tomorrow. Guarding assign
ments will be made in one of the |
two practices.
Commerce High School of San j
Francisco comes to the Pavilion for j
an engagement Saturday night.

afternoon and a tapering off work
out tomorrow. Guarding assign
ments will be made in one of the |
two practices.
Commerce High School of San j
Francisco comes to the Pavilion for j
an engagement Saturday night.
Scouting on your own hook is |
much better than getting reports I
from the grapevine, Coach H. B. j
"Beeh" Lee is probably figuring J
while getting his Stanford frosh |
cagers ready for their game with j
Cal's Bearcubs at Berkeley Friday j
night.
Forced to go the limit in an un- j
successful try to grab a close deci- J
sion out of the fire with Santa i
Clara freshmen, the Cal yearlings
put on such a fine performance for
Lee, who scouted the game, that he
believes he has detected several out
standing defensive weaknesses.
FIRST OF THREE
If he has, Lee can be counted up
on to use the first-hand information
to his best advantage when the two
traditional first-year rivals clash in
the first of a three-game series Fri- j
day night which will be continued ]
March 3 and 4.
Cal's frosh lost 39-38 to Santa
Clara's yearlngs although sporting a
22-13 advantage at half-time. Stan- j
ford figures well on defense and ;
should test the Cubs' offense.
Both outfits will be relatively on
even terms as far as height average i
goes. Bob Penn will be the tallest i
man on the floor at 6:5 but three
Papooses who are less than 6 feet
will partially nullify that advantage.
CAL'S LAFAILLE
Merv Lafaille. brother of Stan
ford's Leon, is the scoring threat of
the Cal offense. He mixes up one- j
handed push shots with medium'
long shots and plays on about the |
same order as does his brother. He
is 5:10.
The other forward is Bob Nor
man, who is the first of three 6:2
players. Norm is a hot and cold
player and specializes in a right
handed hook shot and plays a sound ]
floor game. Bob Biles, 6:2 centcr, is !
a consistent pivot player and ex
cells on controlling the ball off
both backboards on rebound shots.

Irwin Diamond, 6:10 spark of the I
club, rates as a lair long shot artist !
. I
and acts as a steadying influence on j
his team-mates. His guard team- j
mate is Bouhaben, who at 6:2 is!
good at controlling the ball on re- j
bound shots and is an effective I
guard.
SHORTER MEN
Dick Ray, OUie Hamlin and Chuck |
Smith are less than 6 feet, but Bill !
Cowden at 6:2' i; and Penn at 6:5!
will partially offset the disadvan- j
tage.
Lee figures on a tough drill this
afternoon and a tapering off work
