# card Mermen Expect Win Over San Jose
## Farm Team Favored In Events; Diving Competition Featured 
### 
Mid-week predictions by Coach ,
| Nort Thornton indicate that Card!
| varsity swimmers should come out
; oi their San Jose State meet Friday
j afternon with wins in at least six ■
1 events to their credit.
Roy Vitousek, sophomore flash, is
favored to cop both sprints, the 50 j
and 100, as he did iast we£k against
: Athens Club. Frank Weeden, back
stroke specialist, is expected to pull
in ahead of any competition the j
j Spartans can offer, and Bill Hatch
| will probably do the same in the
I breast stroke event.
DIVING HONORS
Cardinal feature of the day's per- !
! formance will be the hot fight for
I diving honors, with Roy Winkel
i mann, conference champ, and My
! Ron (Monk) Martin of San Jose ;
| competing for the top position, j
j Thornton concedes the Spartan a :
! slight chance of knocking "Wink"
j off.
By the end of the afternoon Stan
| ford will probably also have tucked |
j into their trunks wins in both the
j relay events. In the 1300-yard med
j ley probable Card starters will be
Bill Weeden, backstroke; Lloyd
Wilson, breast; and Jack Brahtz,
i free style. Roy Vitousek, Chuck
| Wiper, Jack Brahtz, and Bill Hatch j
1 will toe the mark for the 400-yard
I relay.
j SAN JOSE POOL
j The only question mark that holds :
i back a prediction of first place in all
: eight swimming events is Win Need- j
ham. Whether or not he will be in j
j condition to race by Friday has not j
yet been determined. In all proba- |
i bility, if he does get back into the |
: water in time, Coach Thornton will!
I enter him in only one of his two
regular races, the 220 and 440. Hal
Weatherbe, who came second and
I first, respectively, in these two
I races against Athens Club in Need
ham's absence, is the Cards' other!
hope in these two divisions.
The meet will be held in San Jose j
j State's 25-yard pool Friday after
| noon at 4:30 o'clock.
