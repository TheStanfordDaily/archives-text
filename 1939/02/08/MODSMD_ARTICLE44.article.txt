# Weather Halts Baseball Workouts

"Baseball is at a stand still. I
haven't even seen iny team in a
week."
These were the rather unhappy
words yesterday released for pub
lication by Harry Wolter, head man
in the world of the Stanford dia
mond.
It was the same old story of wet
grounds that kept Cardinal horse
hide exponents from practice all last
week, resulting in a cancelled var
sity game against a semi-profession
al San Francisco nine.
Pitchers and catchers have kept
their respective arms in shape by
rather infrequent and very wet
workouts in the pitching shed. Santa
Clara, the first game of the confer
ence season, is the next nine-man
opposition on the damp Cardinal
schedule. Weather permitting, Har
ry Wolter's boys will spend this com
ing Saturday afternoon attempting
to tumble these boys from down
San Jose way.
The yearlings, due to rain, have
yet to break into the "first played
game" ranks. Yesterday's battle
with Marin Jaysee got the "no go"
sign. Friday calls for the frosh to
take the home field against another
Ran Francisco nine, this time the
Commerce High School.
The Berkeley High School boys
will take up where the Commerce
High School nine leaves of! in a

game at 2:30 o'clock on Saturday.
"Regardless of the weather," said
Coach Harry Shipkey, "I want all
frosh players to turn out today. If
it is too wet, they should at least
toss a ball around."
