STANFORD'S ski team took a high gelande
sprung last night and won minor sports
recognition.
This time, however, it doesn't look as though
the team will leave a deep sitzmark, as it did
last year.
Appearing before Ex Committee, Harry Ma
loney, director of minor sports, backed down
on previous opinion and said, "Last year, I
thought skiing was a mushroom growth; this
year, I'm convinced it's more than that."
At the same time, he warned Ex Committee
against taking any action it might regret, by
leaving the University, the 8.A.C., or the
A.S.S.U. liable for injuries incurred while
members are engaged in competition.
Other main objections to recognition of ski
ing as a minor sport have been that members
of the team must journey long distances, must
compete in week-end-long meets. This, natu
rally enough, presents the difficulty of ade
quate supervision by minor sports directors.
With eight members of the official Stanford
ski team and with approximately 200 other
Stanfordites, it hardly seems valid to let "dif
ficulty" stand as an objection to recognition,
however.
A far greater problem is the one of liability;
in this case. Ex Committee moved with studied
precision, declared that recognition be granted
the team only if members waive liability claims.
Problems now confronting the skiers are a
point system on which to base awards and su
pervision on the long week-ends. These are
slight in the face of the two-year-long fight,
however.
In reality, the action of Excom is recognition
of an already existing situationâ€”a smart legis
lative move in any political league. The ski
team uses Stanford's name anyway, it will
continue to support itself; it might just as well
have official approval and the right to official
award for its efforts.
But without liability to Stanford, without a
crack at the A.S.S.U. budget.
