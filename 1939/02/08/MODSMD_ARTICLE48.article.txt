NEXT Wednesday evening John Gunther
will stand on the stage of Memorial Hall,
look at Stanford comfortably settled in its red
plush chairs, and tell it what's happening in
side Europe.
This lecture will represent a great deal more
than a highly interesting presentation of the
real facts about the world's most pressing prob
lem, the danger of a European war. John Gun
ther at Stanford marks the first definite mile
stone on the road to an A.S.S.U. lecture series,
worthy to be ranked with the highly successful
concerts sponsored by the student body.
Delayed by an overflowing fall quarter, the
committee today presents its accomplishment
to the student body—an outstanding speaker
presenting a vital topic in a popular way.
This, however, is merely the beginning; the
lecture series committee stands far from the
completion of its project. What the A.S.S.U.
wants, needs, and, according to all indications,
will have is a regular program of top-notch lec
turers announced at the start of each fall quar
ter. A definite schedule of dates, reasonably
priced season tickets, and the lecture series
will be complete.
Wednesday evening will mark the begin
ning. With John Gunther for a start and strong
student opinion supporting the movement, the
lecture series may become reality before Stan
ford builds its third boathouse.—L. L.
