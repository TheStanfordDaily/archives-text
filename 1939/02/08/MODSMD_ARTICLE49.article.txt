# Invest in Stanford

AGAIN today The Daily publishes on page 1
a story of a Stanford department that is
kept from being a leader in its field because of
lack of funds.
Yesterday, it was neutron research; today, it
is television research that The Daily cites as an
instance of Stanford's vital need for contribu
tions to enable its research departments to
perform the unusual as well as the routine.
Two years ago, the annual Stanford Fund
Appeal was inaugurated to remedy this situa
tion, to help keep Stanford from getting clipped
between the two scissor-edges of rising oper
ating costs and diminishing income from en
dowment.
This year, in the third Annual Fund Appeal,
alumni are being told the story of a University
hampered by inadequate budgets. They are
being told that "small sums now" are what the
University needs. They are being reminded

that Stanford's endowment has dropped from
first to tenth in the past 35 years.
Contributions to the fund may not be as
spectacular as the tremendous gifts earmarked
specifically for everything from Libe foun
tains to 200-foot towers. But let students and
alumni alike remember that it is the "small
sums now" that will put Stanford out in the
lead academically.—R. D.
