# BULL SESSION
## STATISTICAL STAGGERS 
### JOHN COBBS 
sr-me time now the supporters of Stanford's
honor system have been holding out against a
minor siege by critics. When The Daily announced
yesterday that only two violation cases had come be
fore Men's Council since last fall, a sub-species of
argument broke out as to which side was entitled to
use the new information for ammunition.
The backers of the present system stick out their
tongues and say that two cases out of 4,000 students
proves that our arrangement is working like an effi
ciency expert's dream. Critics of the system retort
that the law of averages shows that there must be a
list of unreported violations as long as a registration
line. Ergo, the system is failing miserably, so there.

It is with some hesitation that I march out into
the no-man's land of the argument, making noises like
a peacemaker. The scriptures to the contrary, peace
makers are usually called a number of things besides
the children of God. But as far as I can see, the cases
tried this year cannot be used as artillery by either
side.
The honor system at Stanford is based on the idea
that practically all the students have enough ordinary
intelligence and ethical judgment to keep them from
cheating. It realizes that a small proportion of the
students will belong to the 10-cent store brand of
humanity that can't read a puzzle page without sneak
ing a look at the answers. But it considers the pro
portion negligible.

who wants to cheat at Stanford can do
it so that even the recording angel wouldn't be
suspicious. All the chiseler has to do is to step out
for a smoke, or take his paper to a vacant room. Any
one who gets caught cheating is much too stupid to
get anything out of it.
The honor system works on the theory that only a
few students try to beat the game. It writes them off
like a business writes off bad debts, assuming that
they will get away with it. Reporting violations and
the subsequent prosecutions are merely incidental.
The real question is how many students use the system
to cheat secretly.
As far as we know, only a few students think that
cheating Ls a practical way of getting an education.
Evidently high school requirements and the aptitude
test cut out most of the ones who want to pay $115
a quarter for something they could do at home in
their spare time.
If the critics want to continue the siege, they will
have to dig up new munitions. Present statistics
aren't loaded.
