### DOUG JAQUES 
To a chivalrous man, to a Southerner perhaps,
Ethel might seem young and beautiful, a little charm
ing even. To no one did she seem weak or willowy.
There was not a delicate fiber in her athletic body,
not a sliver of fat about her imposing girth.
Peter was —at least at one time—a chivalrous man.
He was a small man with a small moustache and a
soft-spoken manner, and he always wore a large,
white carnation boutonniere and carried a cane, which
was unfortunate because both greatly overshadowed
him. They seemed more significant than he.
Peter should have been a normal, happy, quiet
mouse; albeit a somewhat decorated mouse. But
nature had done a thing to him: nature had given
him a right eye which winked involuntarily every
15 minutes, except when he was very excited,
when it winked every three minutes.
Peter met Ethel first the night he went to Joe's
party. lie was the last guest to arrive by a telling
hour. It was summer time, and when he entered
the room where all the guests were carousing
around to show that they knew a party when they
saw one. he was carrying a straw hat as well as
his cane.
One of the guests, who was one of the rapidly in
creasing list of those becoming rapidly more and
more buoyant, rolled over to him.
"Why if it ain t Peter," he said, and in one swooping
motion got both the hat and cane away from Peter.
"Watch." He threw the hat high in the air, and when
it came down, he swatted it one with the cane. That
swat was a fine thing to see. Which is more than
could be said for the hat or for a lamp ov<jr in the
corner which the hat hit Both, it. was obvious, lacked
a certain sturdiness.
Peter was aghast at this rough treatment. He looked
forlornly around the room. It happened that he was
looking at Ethel when he winked. There was some
thing gay, something reckless in that wink. It had life
and abandon in it.
"A real spender," 1 Ethel said.
She immediately attached herself to Peter.
When she had pinned him down on a couch in
the corner, she said, "That hat must have cost
you a lot of money. I'll hct it did."
Not much, said Peter bravely—and winked.
"Oh, aren't you the one though," Ethel said and
snuggled up closer to him.
I h blub blub üb, Peter said. He was finding
it difTicult to breathe. Ethel, he had to admit, was
quite a hugger.
After a while of this, Ethel said. "It's getting
stuffy in here. Let's go out to the garden." She
got up, dragging Peter after her. "Would you like
to go out?"
"Yes." Peter winked.
"Say, don't get me wrong," Ethel said. "It's stuffy
in here, that's all."
Peter winked.
Oh, ain t you the one, though," she said, and they
went, outside. After they had been out for a little,
Ethel said, "Petsic, do you like me a little, huh?"
"Sure." He winked.
"Oh, Petsic. she giggled coyly. "More than a
little bit, huh?"
Peter cagily glanced away looking for a means
of escape. As lie did he said, gallantly, "Sure."
And at the same time he winked. The effect was
beautiful—the way he had shyly glanced away and
yet had winked at her. and had said, with mascu
line brusqueness, "Sure."
It was too much for Ethel. She speedily found
herself in his arms. "Do you think we'll be happy
together, Petsic?"
"Oh," Peter said and winked.
"Fresh!" sin- said and slugged him and dragged
him off to the preacher.

"Watch." He threw the hat high in the air, and when
it came down, he swatted it one with the cane. That
swat was a fine thing to see. Which is more than
could be said for the hat or for a lamp ov<jr in the
corner which the hat hit Both, it. was obvious, lacked
a certain sturdiness.
Peter was aghast at this rough treatment. He looked
forlornly around the room. It happened that he was
looking at Ethel when he winked. There was some
thing gay, something reckless in that wink. It had life
and abandon in it.
"A real spender," 1 Ethel said.
She immediately attached herself to Peter.
When she had pinned him down on a couch in
the corner, she said, "That hat must have cost
you a lot of money. I'll hct it did."
Not much, said Peter bravely—and winked.
"Oh, aren't you the one though," Ethel said and
snuggled up closer to him.
I h blub blub üb, Peter said. He was finding
it difTicult to breathe. Ethel, he had to admit, was
quite a hugger.
After a while of this, Ethel said. "It's getting
stuffy in here. Let's go out to the garden." She
got up, dragging Peter after her. "Would you like
to go out?"
"Yes." Peter winked.
"Say, don't get me wrong," Ethel said. "It's stuffy
in here, that's all."
Peter winked.
Oh, ain t you the one, though," she said, and they
went, outside. After they had been out for a little,
Ethel said, "Petsic, do you like me a little, huh?"
"Sure." He winked.
"Oh, Petsic. she giggled coyly. "More than a
little bit, huh?"
Peter cagily glanced away looking for a means
of escape. As lie did he said, gallantly, "Sure."
And at the same time he winked. The effect was
beautiful—the way he had shyly glanced away and
yet had winked at her. and had said, with mascu
line brusqueness, "Sure."
It was too much for Ethel. She speedily found
herself in his arms. "Do you think we'll be happy
together, Petsic?"
"Oh," Peter said and winked.
"Fresh!" sin- said and slugged him and dragged
him off to the preacher.
To a chivalrous man, to a Southerner perhaps,
Ethel might seem young and beautiful, a little charm
ing even. To no one did she seem weak or willowy.
There was not a delicate fiber in her athletic body,
not a sliver of fat about her imposing girth.
Peter was —at least at one time—a chivalrous man.
He was a small man with a small moustache and a
soft-spoken manner, and he always wore a large,
white carnation boutonniere and carried a cane, which
was unfortunate because both greatly overshadowed
him. They seemed more significant than he.
Peter should have been a normal, happy, quiet
mouse; albeit a somewhat decorated mouse. But
nature had done a thing to him: nature had given
him a right eye which winked involuntarily every
15 minutes, except when he was very excited,
when it winked every three minutes.
Peter met Ethel first the night he went to Joe's
party. lie was the last guest to arrive by a telling
hour. It was summer time, and when he entered
the room where all the guests were carousing
around to show that they knew a party when they
saw one. he was carrying a straw hat as well as
his cane.
One of the guests, who was one of the rapidly in
creasing list of those becoming rapidly more and
more buoyant, rolled over to him.
"Why if it ain t Peter," he said, and in one swooping
motion got both the hat and cane away from Peter.
"Watch." He threw the hat high in the air, and when
it came down, he swatted it one with the cane. That
swat was a fine thing to see. Which is more than
could be said for the hat or for a lamp ov<jr in the
