# Ballet Russe Opens Series Brilliantly'
## 
### 
With brilliance and glamour which
is beginning to become an annual
phenomenon, the Ballet Russe open
ed its five-day season at the San
Francisco Opera House last night.
Tossed gracefully at the audience
were one valid example of Russian
ballet, one excellent imitation of it,
and one of the serious musical in
terpretations that have formed the
post-war era's gift to the dance.
The program opened with Tschai
kowsky's "The Swan Lake," a sweet
ly nostalgic fairy-tale left us by the
Imperial Russian troupe. Alexan
dra Danilova as the enchanted
princess and Frederic Franklin as
the prince were appropriately grace
ful in the solos, pas de deux, and
ensembles that make up the old
fashioned gauze skirts and tights
ballet.
DANCE SYMPHONY'
To this reviewer it seemed almost
sacrilege to dance to Beethooven's
Seventh Symphony, but the work is
a logical choice on the pail of Leo
nide Massine, its choreographer, in
that its magnificent rhythms have
earned it the name of "the dance
symphony." With symbolic move
ments and massed choreographic
groupings, Massine has interpreted
the Seventh as an allegory of the
creation and fall of man.
At times the ballet is packed with
deep significance, it seems to repre
sent the art of dancing in its high
est form, and at others it is pitifully
inadequate in fulfilling the demands
of the great symphony that accom
panies it. Outstanding were Nini
Theilade, Alicia Markova, and Fred
eric Franklin in the epi
sodes representing the creation of
the elements, the serenity of para
dise, the fall of man, and the de
struction of, the earth.
Again as in the "Fantastic Sym
phony" of Berlioz, costumes and set
tings by Christian Bcrand are weird
ly conceived in terms of cloudy
backgrounds and long-sleeved white
tights, giving the general effect of
grandpa's underwear hung against
an unfinished Derain canvas.
EPITOMIZES PARIS
And then there's "Gaiete Parisi
enne." Massine has made it a ro
mantic, brilliant, slightly vulgar
story which epitomizes the carefree
Paris of the nineteenth century —
dashing boulevardiers, naughty lad
ies, cafe life, and the can-can. For
himself he has reserved the role
that steals the show, a screwy Peru
vian traveling salesman, whose an
tics keep the audience in hysterics.
In the last analysis, "Gaiete
Parisienne" is cheap and gaudy,
danced to the over-sentimental mu
sic of Offenbach, but it is a perfect
picture of the delightful, ai'tificial
world it aims to recreate.

With brilliance and glamour which
is beginning to become an annual
phenomenon, the Ballet Russe open
ed its five-day season at the San
Francisco Opera House last night.
Tossed gracefully at the audience
were one valid example of Russian
ballet, one excellent imitation of it,
and one of the serious musical in
terpretations that have formed the
post-war era's gift to the dance.
The program opened with Tschai
kowsky's "The Swan Lake," a sweet
ly nostalgic fairy-tale left us by the
Imperial Russian troupe. Alexan
dra Danilova as the enchanted
princess and Frederic Franklin as
the prince were appropriately grace
ful in the solos, pas de deux, and
ensembles that make up the old
fashioned gauze skirts and tights
ballet.
DANCE SYMPHONY'
To this reviewer it seemed almost
sacrilege to dance to Beethooven's
Seventh Symphony, but the work is
a logical choice on the pail of Leo
nide Massine, its choreographer, in
that its magnificent rhythms have
earned it the name of "the dance
symphony." With symbolic move
ments and massed choreographic
groupings, Massine has interpreted
the Seventh as an allegory of the
creation and fall of man.
At times the ballet is packed with
deep significance, it seems to repre
sent the art of dancing in its high
est form, and at others it is pitifully
inadequate in fulfilling the demands
of the great symphony that accom
panies it. Outstanding were Nini
Theilade, Alicia Markova, and Fred
eric Franklin in the epi
sodes representing the creation of
the elements, the serenity of para
dise, the fall of man, and the de
struction of, the earth.
Again as in the "Fantastic Sym
phony" of Berlioz, costumes and set
tings by Christian Bcrand are weird
ly conceived in terms of cloudy
backgrounds and long-sleeved white
tights, giving the general effect of
grandpa's underwear hung against
an unfinished Derain canvas.
EPITOMIZES PARIS
And then there's "Gaiete Parisi
enne." Massine has made it a ro
mantic, brilliant, slightly vulgar
story which epitomizes the carefree
Paris of the nineteenth century —
dashing boulevardiers, naughty lad
ies, cafe life, and the can-can. For
himself he has reserved the role
that steals the show, a screwy Peru
vian traveling salesman, whose an
tics keep the audience in hysterics.
In the last analysis, "Gaiete
Parisienne" is cheap and gaudy,
danced to the over-sentimental mu
sic of Offenbach, but it is a perfect
picture of the delightful, ai'tificial
world it aims to recreate.
