# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'SO WHAT'—STANFORD 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
"Greater Part of World Is Under
nourished," a huge headline says on
the front page of the largest con
servative Dutch newspaper, "De
Telegraaf" of Jan. 17, which I re
ceived from home this morning.
Under it was a detailed report of
the findings of the League of Na
tions' Economics Committee, which
studied the problem for more than
three years and published its con
clusions three weeks ago in Geneva.
I did not remember having seen
anything of the kind in a newspa
per here —certainly not on the front
page —and all of a sudden it struck
me that I have been wrong in ex
pecting from Stanford-Americans
what I could expect from my coun
trymen: a real deep interest in hu
manity for the sake of making your
own life fuller and more integrated,
and making the world a little more
fit to live in for everybody.
I forgot that the slogan for the
majority here is "What of it?" This
should be inscribed under the
Statue of Liberty, so people would
be prepared for this attitude when
they enter America and would not
make mistakes as I did!
Liberty, starvation, Constitution,
vigilantes, war, art, fascism, every
thing: what of it.? All right, if you
want it like that, you can have it.
I am sorry I did not understand
your "so what?" philosophy sooner.
I apologize for not knowing the
Stanford-American mentality better
after having been here seven
months.
I should have known that Stan
ford only gets "frustrated and fanat
ical"' about the other sex and not
about starvation and the trampling
of human rights! But I still don't
see, however, why those students
who are different don't organize into
progressive groups. Why should
Stanford be behind Columbia or
Chicago University in this respect? j
The enthusiasm could make up eas- !
ily for the lack in number, and !
there's enough to work for right j
here. Why not. make the A.S.U. j
stronger?
John Cobbs apparently does not i
want to back up his statements, so J
we'll leave it at that. Thanks, any- j
way, John, for giving us a place in j
this system. We're so glad.
Marco Thome obviously had not I
read my letter well. I was not talk- |
ing about vague things like "the 1
world's battles," I never suggested '
"to hush Cobbs up" and, again, I !

did not "scream," I tried to express
myself as simply as I could. I won
der where Thome got all that? Fur
thermore, I don't doubt that
"Cobbs' value is great," at least for
certain people. I do not believe that
"life ends at Stanford"; I think, in
general, it doesn't even begin here.
1 agree on one point wholehearted
ly. "It takes sober, planned action."
Thome hit it there!
1 quit here sans rancune. An
American finishes this letter for me.
It is Mr. Ernest Sutherland Bates
and he says:
"The college graduate is merely
l'i- young man of action whom we
all know, well mannered and well
groomed, alert, energetic, worshipful
of 'putting it over,' skeptical of
ideals, indifferent to ideas—and in
his handsome empty head he carries
the fate of the nation."
I am too much interested in the
future of this country—MY Amer
ica also—to let that type of "Amer
ican" ruin it.

"The college graduate is merely
l'i- young man of action whom we

of 'putting it over,' skeptical of

"Greater Part of World Is Under
nourished," a huge headline says on
the front page of the largest con
servative Dutch newspaper, "De
Telegraaf" of Jan. 17, which I re
ceived from home this morning.
Under it was a detailed report of
the findings of the League of Na
tions' Economics Committee, which
studied the problem for more than
three years and published its con
clusions three weeks ago in Geneva.
I did not remember having seen
anything of the kind in a newspa
per here —certainly not on the front
page —and all of a sudden it struck
me that I have been wrong in ex
pecting from Stanford-Americans
what I could expect from my coun
trymen: a real deep interest in hu
manity for the sake of making your
own life fuller and more integrated,
and making the world a little more
fit to live in for everybody.
I forgot that the slogan for the
majority here is "What of it?" This
should be inscribed under the
Statue of Liberty, so people would
be prepared for this attitude when
they enter America and would not
make mistakes as I did!
Liberty, starvation, Constitution,
vigilantes, war, art, fascism, every
thing: what of it.? All right, if you
want it like that, you can have it.
I am sorry I did not understand
your "so what?" philosophy sooner.
I apologize for not knowing the
Stanford-American mentality better
after having been here seven
months.
I should have known that Stan
ford only gets "frustrated and fanat
ical"' about the other sex and not
about starvation and the trampling
of human rights! But I still don't
see, however, why those students
who are different don't organize into
progressive groups. Why should
Stanford be behind Columbia or
Chicago University in this respect? j
The enthusiasm could make up eas- !
ily for the lack in number, and !
there's enough to work for right j
here. Why not. make the A.S.U. j
stronger?
John Cobbs apparently does not i
want to back up his statements, so J
we'll leave it at that. Thanks, any- j
way, John, for giving us a place in j
this system. We're so glad.
Marco Thome obviously had not I
read my letter well. I was not talk- |
ing about vague things like "the 1
world's battles," I never suggested '
"to hush Cobbs up" and, again, I !

did not "scream," I tried to express
myself as simply as I could. I won
der where Thome got all that? Fur
thermore, I don't doubt that
"Cobbs' value is great," at least for
certain people. I do not believe that
"life ends at Stanford"; I think, in
general, it doesn't even begin here.
1 agree on one point wholehearted
ly. "It takes sober, planned action."
