### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Feb. 7 (UP).—
A huge slide late today buried the
Columbia River Highway under 50
feet of rock and earth near the One
onta tunnel, 20 miles east of Port
land, the Oregon State Motor Asso
ciation reported. Railroad tracks
also were blocked.
The slide followed another day of
state-wide snow and rain storms,
and necessitated immediate re-rout

rail traffic to the north bank of the
Columbia. A similar slide occurred
yesterday near Mosier tunnel.

A recent survey indicates that
less than a third as many Alabama
residents have hookworm disease
| now as did 25 years ago.
