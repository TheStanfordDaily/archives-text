### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
JJUBBING a man a crass mate
rialist carries with it a great
deal more of stigma these days than
it did during the palmy 'twenties
when people innocently talked of a
chicken in every pot and a car in
every garage.
With the passing of material pros
perity, impoverished idealism came
into fashion; one might be ragged,
yet respected, if he was fighting for
a Cause. Despite this compensatory
mechanism, the fact remains that
almost everything in the world of
19159 can be boiled down to dollars
and cents. Materialism may not be
beautiful to contemplate, but it is
completely real.
* •» ♦
I ET all Depression-bred idcal-
J ists prepare to forget their
faith in democracy in the abstract
—for France and England are
preparing to make huge loans to
the fascist government of Fran
cisco Franco in order to buy him
away from Germany ai.d Italy.
With the Civil War practically at
an end, the democratic powers are
searching frantically for a means to
remove the influence of Mussolini
and Hitler from Spain. When all
else fails, they have found, money
usually can turn the trick.
* * *
VAISITS of a French senator to
Franco's headquarters at Bur
gos and Chamberlain's suggestion of
a Spanish loan to Parliament yes
terday indicate that the anti-Fascist
nations will be willing to swap a
little financial backing for an Ital
ian-German exit from Spain.
AM signs on the horizon point
to early recognition of the In
surgent government by Britain
and France. Yesterday an Eng
lish cruiser visited the island of
Minorca, the last scrap of land
off the peninsula held by the Loy
alists, in an effort to persuade the
inhabitants to surrender.
Reason for the recommendation is
that the British are well aware that
the strategically located island is far
cafeer in Franco's hands than it
would be if an Italian air force seiz
es it for the Rebels and uses it as a
base to menace the Mediterranean.
* *
a few days' vain boasting
that, the Republican forces were
going to fight to the bitter end,
Premier Juan Negrin finally capitu
lated yesterday and fled across the
frontier into French territory.
Although he is keeping face by
taking no part in negotiations for
surrender to Franco, he knows
that the game's up. General Jose
Miaja, the defender of the Loy
alist territory in central Spain, has
undertaken a peace settlement on
his own initiative. And so, after
almost three years of civil war,
the red and gold standard of
Fascism soon may fly over a re
united Spain.

London comes news that
Mr. Chamberlain is planning a
world conference to insure the
preservation of peace. However, in
1939 the words "pact," "agreement,"
"conference," trip lightly from the
tongue. We, who have seen the
Versailles Treaty transformed from
a document to guarantee the pres
ervation of peace and democracy to
a scrap of paper, have little faith in
words.
However futile armament limita
tions and peace conferences may be,
they have one saving grace. They
may not prevent wars, but they
postpone them.
