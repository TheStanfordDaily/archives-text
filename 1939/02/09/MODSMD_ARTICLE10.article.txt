# Modern Dance Analysis Given
## 
### 
Emphasizing the point that the
Modern Dance Ls a straightforward
expression of our time and deliber
ately is not "pretty," the Berkeley
Choreographic Group last night pre
sented an analysis and explanation
of the dance's principle of move
ment. The program, held in the
Women's Gym, was presented as a
part of the weekly Spectator Course.
The first section of the program
was a series of technical demonstra
tions of movement as expressed in
time, force and space, and variations
of a walk and skip. The first dance,
"Salutation," was first presented,
then the 1 hemes were analyzed, and
the dance was repeated to show how
the themes were worked into the
choreography.
The second dance was "Alas for
What?" a satire on feminine adoles
cence. Contrasted to the satire was
"Lament," a theme of despair, pre
sented with vocal accompaniment.
Last on the program was a more
brilliant composition, "Drive."
