LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8 (UP). -
i Snow and hail fell in os Angeles
i and Hollywood late today, climax
j ing a week-long cold wave that pil â€”
| ed up high snow drifts in Southern
California's mountains and poured
more than two inches aX rain into
I the valleys.
j Los Angeles office workers glanc
j ing out of the windows shortly be
i fore 4 p.m. saw snowfiakes falling
lin downtown streets for the first
! time in seven years.
Earlier in the day Pasadena re
i ported "two minutes" of snow,
I which soon turned into rain.
The weather bureau recalled it
was the first time snow had fallen
in Los Angeles since Jan. 15, 1932,
when enough flakes dropped from
the skies to cover the ground, and
provide snowball material for de
lighted youngsters.
The Far West also shivered in the
grip of the coldest temperature of
the year. Sub-freezing tempera
tures were general from Southern
California northward to the Cana
dian border and from the Pacific
into the Rocky Mountain area. The
coldest recordings were in Montana,
where it was 34 degrees below zero
at Fort Peck.
The U. S. Weather Bureau fore
j cast continued freezing tempera
j tures for the Far West, with heavy
I frost in the mornings and snow in
' the mountains; occasional showers
were forecast for Southern Cali
!fornia.
