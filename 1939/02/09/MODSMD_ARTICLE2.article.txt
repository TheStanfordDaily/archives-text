# What! No Indians? Zweig Is Amazed
## 
### 
Stefan Zweig thought Western
America was a vast, undeveloped
territory. He expected to find San
Francisco a sort of frontier outpost
with Indians roaming its streets.
Or so he told interviewers today
at the Clift Hotel. He expressed
amazement and gratification at the
culture he found in the United Slates
as a whole and in the West in par
ticular.
