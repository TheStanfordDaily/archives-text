NEWS ITEM: "The Stanford |
Board of Athletic Control will hold i
a meeting Saturday—"
* * *
ORDINARILY a little caption like
that wouldn't merit enough space to I
catch the eye. But this month the
routine once-a-month get-together
of the B.A.C. big-wigs is the occa
ion for reams of publicity. The j
Stanford hounds on the Bay area
newspapers are baying louder and |
sourer than ever before. The B.A.C.
should be proud 1o have so much :
recognition taken of a task which,
through custom, has fallen to their
lot to acocmplish. Tiny Thornhill's '
football contract is practically ready !
for the furnace and it now rests up- j
'on the judgment of the august I
board to determine the big mentor's ,
future status.
Alter tho board has met and ren- I
dered a verdict in the Thornhill '
case, only President Wilbur has the !
power to affirm or reverse their I
judgment. And President Wilbur J
must undoubtedly feel that the only 1
logical move is to retain Tiny.
After all, hasn't Thornhill been
the meekest, most agreeable fellow
ever to get into the coaching trade?
Has anyone ever heard a whimper j
from him bcause the material at j
Stanford has been woefully weak in j
comparison with other conference |
schools? Did he ever bemoan the !■
fact that Stanford athletes don't get '
all the gravy out of the campus !
stew-pot? We think not. He is typ- j
ical of everything which most j
coaches aren't, and that makes him
different enough to be just about 1
tops in his profession.
•H * *
BUT the Board and President
Wilbur have the final say. The al- J
ternatives which are before them are ;
numerous if not wise. Hence Slants !
gives you a few of the possible solu- j
tions of the yearly mess. Write your i
Congressman if you see one that !
appeals to your idea of justice:
1. The Board can ignore Thorn- '
hill altogether and hire an assistant j
coach in his stead.

2. The Board may hire Thornhill
for one year with the same -set of
helpers as at present.
3. The Board can hire an advisory
coach and retain Thornhill as the
forgotten "head coach." This scheme
would work about as smoothly as a
Germany with two Hitlers, or a car
with two steering wheels.
4. The Board can proffer Tiny an -
other three-year contract with the
choice of assistance left absolutely
to his own discretion. Thus he would
possess all the responsibility and
authority which he has lacked he
fore as well as being able to claim
every bit of the plaudits which the
squad might receive.
5. The Board might elect to tear
down the stadium and put bleach
ers on Angel 1 Field.
6. The Board can fire (he whole
staff and take up coaching them
selves.
J|: »|i J|t
FROM this side of the fence, the
only choice seems to be number
four, with Tiny chief of the whole
clan. Did you ever hear much about
Frank Wickhorst and Irv Uleritz.
the two great assistants to Stub
Allison?
They're as quiet mouthed as *1 can
of clams. Stub gets all the credit
and all the blame. He's the "top
Sarge" if there ever was one. Yet
Thornhill has other attributes which
stack him high above either Allison
or Howard Jones.
He can handle men. Simply be
cause he has a knack of getting all
he can out of slim pickings, he has
suffered only one bad loss since the
Vow Boys left him. He never plays
a sick or tired man. That's humani
tarianism personified.
The whole point, of course, is this.
We've been like brothers to the
B.A.C. all week now. We've said
nice things about them until we al
most believe some of it ourselves.
If any of them read our casual
suggestions, may they vote for
Proposition No. 4 because that's the
ultimate solution to the whole grid
squabble.
