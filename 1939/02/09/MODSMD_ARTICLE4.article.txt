# U. of Hawaii To Debate Card Team
## Anglo-American Pact Will Be Discussion Subject for Tonight 
### 
Stanford and Hawaiian debaters
will exchange slants on the Anglo-
American situation tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the lounge of the Wom
en's Clubhouse when Milton Marks
and Arvin Brown, Farm men meet
two of four representatives from
the islands.
Presiding at the debate will be
Paul Leebrick, prominent Stanford
senior and former student at the
University of Hawaii. Following the
debate proper, Leebrick will an
nounce a symposium by the Ha
waiian students on the part Hawaii
is playing in world defense.
OFFER NEW SLANT
According to Bob Putnam, debate
manager, the ideas presented this
evening will be unusual and worth
while. This aspect of the program
was substantiated by Marks, who
declared that having haggled i.ver
the benefits of an Anglo-American
alliance with few people oiher than
students residing in the United
States may prove limiting under the
circumstances. He further explains
his belief by saying that the Hawaii
ans, out there in the middle of the
Pacific, will have altogether new,
and not unlikely revolutionary, con
ceptions of the benefits of such an
alliance. In that case, the Stanford
men may be faced with the prob
lem of reorganizing their cases on
very short notice.
The Hawaiian representatives left
their home shores late in January
and have been fulfilling engage
ments m Southern California at
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. Travelling
north they stopped at San Jose to
challenge the native forensic men,
and appear this evening after
varied and concentrated experience.
WILL VISIT ISLANDS
Reciprocating this visit, two de
baters from Stanford will make a
trip to the Islands later this year.
While they will probably engage in
several forensic meets, the tour
will undoubtedly be conducted par
tially along the lines of the recently
completed Indian tour on which the
travelers went out to observe more
than debate.
Final selection, to be made by Mr.
Leland Chapin, varsity debate coach,
has not yet been announced, but
the eligibles have narrowed down to
eight. This makes decision immi
nent, with the names probably be
ing announced by Friday.
