# Intramural Parade . . .
## 
### 
Sigma Chi's intramural golf team
took one important step closer to
the intramural trophy when they
turned back Sequoia's divot diggers
6 points against a possible 4 in the
semi-finals. They have won Ihe
l ight to meet the winner of the Al
pha Delt-Kappa Sigma match to be
played today for the litle.
In intramural basketball, last eve
ning's schedule went unmarred by a
default and unmarked by any excit
ing or exceptionally close games.
In the only tight tilt last night
A.T.O. II again took the role of the
loser by a heart-breaking two
points. This time it was Kappa Sig
I that turned back the luckless
A.T.O. five 2(5-24. Leading 15-8 at
half-time, the winners were in
pretty good control of the game
throughout and were able to fight off
a desperate final minute bid by their
rivals. Art Olsen scored 11 points
for the Kappa Sigs from his for
ward position and helped greatly in
handing A.T.O. II its second defeat
of the week.
Independent II continued to add
proof to the theory that independ
ent teams are usually strong by
downing a scrappy quintet of fresh
men from Encina 3W, 31-25. Dave
Salmon and Fran Fenton were the
big guns of the winning attack, each
bagging 12 digits. While Artie Ras
mussen shouldered most of the scor
ing duties for the freshmen, get
ting 11.
Phi Delt seemed to have recov
ered its equilibrium after their bad
beating at the hands of A.T.0., for
they handily trounced Los Arcos,
35-24. Jake Thompson and Norm
Standlee contributed 10 and 8 points
respectively to the winning cause.
Los Arcos was practically a one
man team with Jim Beemer scoring
18 of his team's 24 points.
Led by Ken Thunem, a consist
ently high scoring center, Breakers
rolled to a decisive 24-10 victory
against Sequoia 11. Thunem ac
counted for 15 of his teams' digits.
The other two games were com
plete riots. Oriole A.C. waxed Beta
44-17 Joe Weiner and Louie Tsou
tsouvas, Oriole sharp-shooters, tank
ed 13 and 12 points, respectively.
The other top-heavy contest found
Delta Chi triumphant over Theta
Chi 11. 50-8. Clem Richardson pour
ed through seven field goals for the
winners.

handball tournament. Saturday is
