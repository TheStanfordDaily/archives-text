# Ruggers to Face U.S.C. in Opener
## 
### 
Stanford ruggers trek south this
week-end for a tussle with U.S.C.
and their first real intercollegiate
match of the season as far as the
Pacific Coast Conference is con
cerned. The match with U.S.F. last
week was actually a practice game,
since the Dons are not in the Con
ference. U.C.L.A., U.S.C., Cal, and
Stanford are members of the con
ference.
From the information at hand it
appears that U.S.C. has a pretty good
team. Many of the regular football
players of the Trojans have turned
to rugby and promise to give Stan
ford a busy afternoon.
U.S.C. has an advantage in having
heavier meri for the forward posi
tions, but Stanford boasts a much
faster backfield. Players like Fay,
Johnson, Brenner, Sparling, Mc-
Murrav, and Grubbs will give U.S.C.
ruggers a tough time of it when it
comes to lugging the ball.

The team leaves Friday night for
Los Angeles with the following
members on board: Captain Lyman
Calkins, George Jedenoff, Don John
son, Jack Brenner, Gerald Sparling,
Pete Fay, Kay McMurray, Jim
Grubbs, Aubrey Austin, Paul Ugrin,
Cam Pierce, Dave Carnahan, Mau
rice Musy, John Schaupp, John
West, Robert Galletti, Ned Pugh,
and Howard Hickingbotham.
The game will be played in the
Los Angeles Coliseum, Saturday
afternoon.
