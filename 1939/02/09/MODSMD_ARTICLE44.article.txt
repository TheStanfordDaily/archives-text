# Cards find New Punch For Cal Tilt
## Copsey, Lyon Raised To First String; Zonne Out of Slump 
### MARGE HOVEY 
A new scoring punch will be the
main offense point of the Stanford
cagers when they meet Cal this
Friday in the Berkeley pavilion for
the second Bear contest of the
year.
Sparked by the replacement of
Bill l!app atid Bob Burnett by Har
lan Copsey and Dick Lyon, the
Cards are expected to hit a higher
score than they have yet in the
Conference this season. Lyon's
seven-inch height advantage over
Bob Burnett will aid the Farm bas
ketballers, although Burnett ap
pears to have regained his shooting
eye and will be a valuable replace
ment.
Don Burness and Captain Phil
Zonne will be the mainstays of the
Indian team, especially since Phil
has come out of his scoring slump.
Sophomores Kenny Davidson and
Don Williams, the latest cage find,
also will see plenty of action to
morrow night.
AGGRESSIVE FLAY
Since both teams use an aggres
sive type of play, the game will be
packed with excitement for the
rooters and trouble for the referees.
Cal has the height advantage with
the tallest team in the conference.
Another Bear advantage is the fact
that the game will be played in the
"800-Berkeley" Pavilion, a handi
cap that has gotten better teams than
this down.
The Cards are fresh from a week
end of easy victories over U.C.L.A.
But instead of causing a slump,
these games may result in a mere
finished and confident type of play
than the boys have been showing.
Coach Everett Dean has worked on
smoothing the offense, speeding up
the passing, and increasing the
scoring average, all of which should
make for improvement tomorrow
night.
CAL PLAYS LEARNED
Dean has also worked the hoop
sters on special Cal plays, especial
ly their defensive ones. Stanford's
defense is expected to hold together
even against Cal, but the main
problem will be to break through
Cal's defense into pay-dirt.
But there is one factor that may
be more important, than even a spe
cial drill—and that is the team's
realization that this is the game that
counts. U.S.C. and Stanford are
tied for second place in the con
ference, with Cal in first place. A
win over Cal would tie the Cards
with the Bears.
Last year the "Laughing Boys"
led by Hank Luisetti gave the
Cardinals' a victory over Cal in the
second game and a first place in the
conference. This year's rejuvenated
casabamen may do the same trick.

scoring average, all of which should
make for improvement tomorrow
night.
CAL PLAYS LEARNED
Dean has also worked the hoop
sters on special Cal plays, especial
ly their defensive ones. Stanford's
defense is expected to hold together
even against Cal, but the main
problem will be to break through
Cal's defense into pay-dirt.
But there is one factor that may
be more important, than even a spe
cial drill—and that is the team's
realization that this is the game that
counts. U.S.C. and Stanford are
tied for second place in the con
ference, with Cal in first place. A
win over Cal would tie the Cards
with the Bears.
Last year the "Laughing Boys"
led by Hank Luisetti gave the
Cardinals' a victory over Cal in the
second game and a first place in the
conference. This year's rejuvenated
casabamen may do the same trick.
A new scoring punch will be the
main offense point of the Stanford
cagers when they meet Cal this
Friday in the Berkeley pavilion for
the second Bear contest of the
year.
Sparked by the replacement of
Bill l!app atid Bob Burnett by Har
lan Copsey and Dick Lyon, the
Cards are expected to hit a higher
score than they have yet in the
Conference this season. Lyon's
seven-inch height advantage over
Bob Burnett will aid the Farm bas
ketballers, although Burnett ap
pears to have regained his shooting
eye and will be a valuable replace
ment.
Don Burness and Captain Phil
Zonne will be the mainstays of the
Indian team, especially since Phil
has come out of his scoring slump.
Sophomores Kenny Davidson and
Don Williams, the latest cage find,
also will see plenty of action to
morrow night.
AGGRESSIVE FLAY
Since both teams use an aggres
sive type of play, the game will be
packed with excitement for the
rooters and trouble for the referees.
Cal has the height advantage with
the tallest team in the conference.
Another Bear advantage is the fact
that the game will be played in the
"800-Berkeley" Pavilion, a handi
cap that has gotten better teams than
this down.
The Cards are fresh from a week
end of easy victories over U.C.L.A.
But instead of causing a slump,
these games may result in a mere
finished and confident type of play
than the boys have been showing.
Coach Everett Dean has worked on
smoothing the offense, speeding up
the passing, and increasing the
scoring average, all of which should
make for improvement tomorrow
night.
