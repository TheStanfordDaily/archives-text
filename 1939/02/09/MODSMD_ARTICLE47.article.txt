### 
The record-smashing frosh swim
ming aggregation will travel south
with their varsity brothers tomor
row afternoon to meet a powerful
San Jose State frosh team.
Paul Herron, captain and out
standing star of the frosh tanksters,
will attempt to bring a few more
national records to the farm. Last
week swimming in a 20-yaid pool
he cracked the national collegiate
220-yard record with a 2:13.1 race,
and now he has his eyes on the na
tional mark in the same race for

I the 25 yard pool. This was set last
year at 2:18.2 by Edward Parks of
| Princeton. Coach Nort Thornton is
confident that Herron will come
i through and annex the mark for
I the Cards.
Herron will also swim the 440
! against the Spartans and the 400-
j yard relay with team-mates Scott
i Dudley, Gardner Miller, and Brad
j Young.
Coach Thornton stated that the
j one weak point of the frosh is their
' lack of a diver.
