# Let There Be Light

OUT of the tumbleweed of rumors that has
been rolling around the campus during
the past few days comes a definite proposal to
solve both the problem of Branner Dining Hall
and the junior transfer situation.
Whispers have been circulating through
men's halls to the effect that lower division
students are going to be barred from Toyon
and Branner, that eating clubs are going to lose
traditional right to a quota of reserved rooms.
Realizing that the University must face the
fact that it provides no means for the social and
academic adjustment of junior transfers, a ten
tative scheme has been proposed:
At present, there is room for more men in
the halls. Records for the past five years show
that although all rooms are usually filled at
the start of fall quarter, by the time spring quar
ter rolls around there are a large number of
vacancies. The population of Sequoia fell 40
per cent between fall and spring of one school
year.
However, under the present system of wait
ing lists for each hall, transfers from one to
another, and frequent failure to take over the
rooms reserved, transfer students cannot be
provided with accommodations when they ask
for them at the start of fall quarter.
In order to do this, the University needs a
residence hall to which new students can be
assigned as the freshmen are assigned to En
cina. Not only would such a dormitory solve
the problem of transfer housing, but it provides
a mechanism for the social adjustment of these
students—a place where they can live and eat
with other Stanford men.
Here, Branner Dining Hall enters the pic
ture. Under the proposed set - up, Branner
would be made into a residence dormitory, one
in which the occupants are obliged to eat.
Toyon would be changed into a club hall, in
which each eating club would have 20 room
rights instead of its present three. Independ
ents would live and eat at Branner and Sequoia.
Junior transfers entering the University
would be distributed to the three men's halls
systematically. Those who joined clubs would
occupy the club's rooms in Toyon; those who
did not would live either in Branner or Sequoia.
The Row, which usually pledges 35 transfers
a year, would take care of the rest.
That's the system.
There remain a great many details to be
worked out. But in the main, it must be ad
mitted that the proposal will realize a title
Stanford already claims—a residence univer
sity.—L. L.
