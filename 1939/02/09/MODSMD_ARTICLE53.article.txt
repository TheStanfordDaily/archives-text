BECAUSE Stanford University allots him only
$35 for books, a Stanford associate profes
sor had to spend 10 hours in the University of
California library, he writes to The Daily in a
Campus Opinion published today.
There is nothing essentially degrading about
the University of California library, but it is
indeed an odd situation when a university
anxious to maintain its prestige cannot muster
enough money for books and makes its fac
ulty "parasitic upon the facilities" of another
university.
Here is where the third annual appeal for the
Stanford Fund makes its entrance. As news
of professors without enough books, neutron
labs without necessary grants of radium, and
scholarships with insufficient endowments
leaks out, it is hoped that alumni will see
these specific needs and make contributions,
perhaps designating where their gifts are to go.
From time to time in the past, these ear
marked gifts have been looked upon with a
degree of disfavor, since the University ad
ministration is in a better position than casual
donors to see where funds are needed.
Airing of these specific shortages of funds,
however, may lead to a beneficial earmarking
of gifts, earmarking that will send money to
needy departments that might be overlooked
by the University if all gifts were left undesig
nated.â€”R. D.
