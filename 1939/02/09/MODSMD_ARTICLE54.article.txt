THEY of 'he professional argument appeared
before Ex Committee this week, took that
august body to the tune of SI 15.
It is only coincidence that the amount equals
one quarter's tuition; it is prooably only coin

cidence that both the Debate Squad and the
Speakers' Bureau needed money at the same
time.
Representatives from both groups more or
less put Ex Committee on a well-greased spot
by the strength of their contentions.
"If we don't get money, you'll lose your
investment," said the Speakers' Bureau.
"If we don't get money, we can't hold the
Pacific Coast Speech Congress here; Stanford
will be accused of not doing its part," wept the
debaters.
Somehow, the fact that most such conven
tions charge enough of a registration fee to
cover expenses didn't seem to make an im
pression in the face of the usual Congress
practice.
Admittedly, both debate and the bureau are
valuable A.S.S.U. activities. Their annual
budgets total $13000â€”5150 to the bureau, $1150
to debate.
In other years, they have been able to stay
within those amounts, still carry on successful
programs.
In the face of the Boathouse and other 1939
campus needs, it might have seemed plausible
if they had been able to stay within their budg
ets this year.
