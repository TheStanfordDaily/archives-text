# BULL SESSION
## UNITED WE STAND UNITED WE SQUALL 
### JOHN COBBS 
IT ALWAYS pains me to find myself playing the part
of a brutal old ogre persecuting Stanford's fair de
moiselles, and so it was with genuine regret that I
saw the graduate women attempting to tinker with
student government machinery last Tuesday. But after
all, the women started it, and under the circum
stances a gentle reproof is not particularly churlish.
It seeins that the graduate women want a consti
tutional amendment giving them a member on Ex
Committee. Under the present rule, there are two
graduate members, sex unspecified. In practice, two
men are elected, and so the women want a constitu
tional provision to require a woman graduate member.

It was pointed out to the lobbyists that there are
some 750 graduate men on the campus and only about
160 women. Ex Committee wanted to know why the
girls thought they should be permitted to use the con
stitution to prize off equal representation with a four
to one majority.
'Oh," said the lobbyist sweetly. "We're organized."
And that, as far as I could see, was their case. They
advanced no other reasons, made 110 other arguments.
Apparently they considei'ed organization sufficient
reason for anything.

a matter of fact, they didn't need to tell Ex Com
mittee that they were organized. On the Stanford
campus, wearing skirts is prima facie evidence of be
ing organized one way or another. Latest statistics
show a neck-and-neck race between the number of
women and the number of women's organizations.
What I can't understand is why the girls clothe the
term "organized" with such magic. Forming groups is
good fun, I realize. And co-operation is a word be
loved of sociologists. But mere organization is not
sacred. I can't see why the women are hypnotized by
it. According to my mathematics 160 girls are still
160 girls, regardless of whether they run in packs or
pairs.

According to the present constitution, the women
will be able to elect a representative as soon as they
become strong enough politically. Until then the prin
ciple of majority rule says that they don't rate one.
The rule we now have is flexible and just; of such
is the Kingdom of Heaven. Tampering with it will do
nothing but encourage women to form more organiza
tions when they should be learning how to make good
wives and mothers.
