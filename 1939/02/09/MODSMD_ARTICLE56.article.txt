BIG TIME
Two '37 women graduates were back in New York
recently.
I can remember when men used to leave the farm
to go to the Big City. Now it's the women who leave.
I3ut when they came back to the farm, they brought
ideas with them like people from a strange country.
Back there people have the right idea. -You don t
make a d;ite with a woman and then go to get her,
sit for half an hour on the front stoop, and then take
her someplace. Nothing like that. When you make the
date, you tell her where you'll meet her that night.
And if the date is for dinner, and she's late, well,
what's to stop you from starting . . .
My friends didn't tell me what happens after the
more formal side of the date had been finished. I
suppose you could take the young lady you were
with down to the subway and ship her home—alone
the way she came. You could.

QUICK
Our managing editor, who holds the All-Univer
sity record for l>eing able to grab a bawlout and look
up a name in the quickest time, nearly broke his own
yesterday.
Someone came into his office. 'How do you spell
Tschaikowsky?"
And the managing editor nearly broke his record,
diving for the Bawlout to look it up.
WELL
One of the boys has been having a little trouble
with his eyes since he broke his glasses, and he was
complaining to a friend about it.
His friend asked him why he didn't get new
glasses.
"Oh. 1 think I'll wait until I get home. My dad's
a doctor, and maybe I can get a rake-off."
"What's he do," the friend asked. "General prac
titioner?"
"No, obstetrician."
"Oh, then he can fix you up himself," the friend
said.

NO
We who follow the "Campus Opinion" columns find
this item rather amusing:
A letter addressed to John Cobbs was put by mis
take into Carolyn Hibbard's post office box yesterday.

PEDANT
A friend of mine tells me that the word "grub" has
lfi meanings, and it takes 30 minutes to copy them all
down.
All right.
