# New Colbert Film 'Zaza' Hard to Take
## 
### 
"ZAZA." currently playing at the
Stanford Theater.
Claudette Colbert is a very good
comedian. Zaza is a dramatic char
acter.
Paramount dug this story from the
bottom of a very deep bag. It is the
touching tale of a beautiful music

hall singer and
her love for a
guy "what wasn't
on the level." Of
course the climax
of the picture is
the visit of Zaza
to the home of
her lover, Herbert
Marshall. The au
dience was al
ways one jump
ahead of the
story.

Herbert Marshall gave his usual
smooth performance and was a per
fect stooge to Miss Colbert's emo
tional gushing. Bert Lahr, playing
his first straight role, did a good job
but was best in his comic scenes.
But the real star of the picture
was Helen Westley as Zaza's ever
d'*unk, selfish stepmother. No one
doubled for a moment that she was
incapable of loving anything but the
"bottle."
The advertisements say "it took
courage to make this picture." It
took even greater courage to show
it! â€”Sprager
