The Editor, Sir:
Is it reajly news to Stanford un-
dergraduates and alumni that in re
search our faculty is largely para
sitic upon the facilities of the Uni
versity of Calfornia? The two phys
icists who couldn't hire a gram of i
radium here are by no means ex- j
ceptional.
Over the past week-end I myself
spent some ten hours working in
the Berkeley library. And why? !
Simply because Stanford has no J
money with which to buy books. |
During the currcnt academic year 1 ,
am receiving from the endowment ;
of Stanford University the grand ,
total of thirty-five dollars ($35) for j
books!
To be sure, I pick the pockets of j
my students through a device called j
Syllabus Fees; but most of that loot i
is needed to keep up with current
materials in the English language
which our students can use. Stan
ford expects its faculty to do re
search, to explore the borderlands
of knowledge and thus add to the
University's prestige; and we want
to. But the means? At Berkeley! I
could use $3000 too!
