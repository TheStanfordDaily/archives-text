BUCHAREST, Rumania, Feb. 8
(UP).â€”Eugenia Tanasoiu, dark-eyed
beauty in the town of Urlatzi, had a
baby. Three suitors claimed to be
the father and were eager to marry
her. She decided to let them light it
out and marry the victor.
While the free-for-all was in full
swing police arrived and arrested the
suitors and Eugenia. In court she
announced her decision to marry her
most recent sweetheart of the three
and leave town immediately. The
two losers acted as best men at the
wedding.

A Newberry College psychologist,
after a survey of students in 22 col
leges, says student opinion is well
to the right of center.
