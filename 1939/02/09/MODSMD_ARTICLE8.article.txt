# Junior to Navigate Yacht In Trans-Pacific Race
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
"Well, it's close to 2100 miles as the crow flics," mused Stanford Junior
Bob Livingston, "hut somehow no one has ever gotten a crow to fly there."
From Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay to Honolulu, 2100 miles.
But Boh isn't intending to fly there, either. Boh is planning something far
more interesting; planning to make the long trip in June as a member of

>the crew of a 36-foot yawl entered
| in the bi-annual trans-Pacific Yacht
I Race.
"I've been hoping to get the chance
| as long as I've been knee high to a
j bug," he explained, glancing about,
the walls of his room at the maps,
and trinkets hanging there. "See all
this stuff? It was picked up on a
| few of the other sailing trips I've
| been on."
FIRST BIG VOYAGE
The youngest of a crew of five,
I Bob is making his first "really gosh
! darn big" sailing trip in the coming
| Honolulu race.
"What's your job—sort of a gen
j eral handy-man?"
I He grinned. "Sorry to disappoint
i you. Somehow I got picked as nav-
J igator."
Navigator! Given sole responsi
-1 bility of charting a course over 2,000
| miles plus of rough ocean. But he
j didn't seem concerned. He's navi
gated before—"Only along the coast,
| though"— and he's taken practical
j courses along that line here at
Stanford.
Leaving from Treasure Island on
June 18, they figure on a maximum
trip of 20 days. "That is, if I can
i find the Islands," Bob grimaced,
i "One thing that we expect to find of
i genuine help in navigating is the
i Clipper radio beam. We can pick it
I up on our own radio and ride it
| into Honolulu."
The voyagers expect to take along
, enough canned and preserved goods,
| along with as much fresh food as
j they can carry. Two and a half
I quarts of water will have to suffice
each man per day for drinking,
cooking, and washing.
Most of the cooking will be done
in salt water, so as to conserve the
I drinking supply. "You'd be sur
| prised how good it can taste that
j way, too,"' he said, grinning widely.
PRAISES BOAT. CREW
i No lives have been lost nor any
j boats seriously damaged during any
of the dozen-odd races which have
I been held to date. Bob isn't too
j keen about getting into headlines
! that way either. Telling of the pre
cautions taken, he termed the boat,
| the crew, and the equipment just
I about as good as they could possibly
j get.
And, as the interview drew to a
' close. "What are you naming the
i boat, Bob?"
"Lana Loa," he said. "It's Hawaii
jan for smooth sailing, they say. 1
| think I'll get one of those native
hula girls to tell me."
