# Junior to Navigate Yacht In Trans-Pacific Race
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
"Well, it's close to 2100 miles as the crow flics," mused Stanford Junior
Bob Livingston, "hut somehow no one has ever gotten a crow to fly there."
From Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay to Honolulu, 2100 miles.
But Boh isn't intending to fly there, either. Boh is planning something far
more interesting; planning to make the long trip in June as a member of

>the crew of a 36-foot yawl entered
| in the bi-annual trans-Pacific Yacht
I Race.
"I've been hoping to get the chance
| as long as I've been knee high to a
j bug," he explained, glancing about,
the walls of his room at the maps,
and trinkets hanging there. "See all
this stuff? It was picked up on a
| few of the other sailing trips I've
| been on."
FIRST BIG VOYAGE
The youngest of a crew of five,
I Bob is making his first "really gosh
! darn big" sailing trip in the coming
| Honolulu race.
"What's your job—sort of a gen
j eral handy-man?"
I He grinned. "Sorry to disappoint
i you. Somehow I got picked as nav-
J igator."
Navigator! Given sole responsi
-1 bility of charting a course over 2,000
| miles plus of rough ocean. But he
j didn't seem concerned. He's navi
gated before—"Only along the coast,
| though"— and he's taken practical
j courses along that line here at
Stanford.
Leaving from Treasure Island on
June 18, they figure on a maximum
trip of 20 days. "That is, if I can
i find the Islands," Bob grimaced,
i "One thing that we expect to find of
i genuine help in navigating is the
i Clipper radio beam. We can pick it
I up on our own radio and ride it
| into Honolulu."
The voyagers expect to take along
, enough canned and preserved goods,
| along with as much fresh food as
j they can carry. Two and a half
I quarts of water will have to suffice
each man per day for drinking,
cooking, and washing.
Most of the cooking will be done
