# Pope Pius XI Dies; Catholic World Mourns
## Heart Attack Ends Life Of Pontiff Death Cuts Short Plans for Celebration Of 17th Anniversary 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Pope Pius XI is dead.
History paused momentarily in its
inevitable course at 8:31 o'clock last
night and bowed its head for the
death of him who was the repre
sentative of God on earth to the
world's 400.000,000 Catholics.
The third of a series of attacks of
cardiacal asthma, the first of which
occurred a little more than two
years ago, brought to a close the 81
significant years of the life of
Achille Ratti. Great physical vigor
and supreme spiritual strength kept
the Pontiff alive during the past
months to guide a half-insane
world.
MILLIONS GRIEVE
Today millions of men who have
never been inside of a church will
mourn Pius XI, fox*, in a large
measure, he was responsible for the
maintenance of peace in Europe
from 1018 to 1939.
As Lorenzo, Cardinal Lauri, the
Pope's personal confessor, last night
performed the traditional ritual of
breaking the Fisherman's Ring from
the dead finger, he recalled the an
cient tradition of the Church, that
the 261 st successor of St. Peter
would be a man of unshaken faith
in a dangerous and difficult time.
INFLUENCES WORLD
Next Sunday was to have been
the seventeenth anniversary of the
coronation of the Holy Father, per
haps the most influential man on
earth during the period of post-War
adjustment in Europe, the coming of
the dictatorships, the threat of a
.second World War.
lii 1921 Pope Benedict XV made
a prediction about the then Arch
bishop Achille Ratti: "With exqui
site tact and unperturbable calmness,
he will establish concord between
Church and State in troubled
times." To the letter, Pius XI filled
this order; the Lateran Treaty of
1929 made peace between the Cath
olic Church and united Italy after
years of enmity.
FIGHTS INTOLERANCE
The Pope battled valiantly the in
tolerance and race persecution of
Hitler and Mussolini that has turned
history back to the Middle Ages in
the 1930'5. Despite his difficult po
sition as head of the Church that is
attacked by the Spanish Loyalists
and their Communist supporters,
the Pontiff repeatedly attempted to
bring about a truce in the Civil War
in Spain.
Last Christmas Pius XI told the
world his heart was grieved by the
madness and folly of man rushing
headlong toward war. And it was
with this picture before his eyes
that his life ended.
In the ninth century the old
Basilica of St. Peters was struck by
lightning; one month later the Pope
Leo 111 died, and the devout told of
the significance of the omen.
One month ago yesterday, a bolt
struck Michelangelo's mighty church
in Rome and today, February 10,
l!)l>9, Pius XI is dead.
