# Tiny Awaits Ruling On Coaching Career
## H.A.C. to Convene Tomorrow Night For Decision on Reappointment Of Thornhill as Card Grid Headman 
### ARCH JENKINS

Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhil!, Stanford's head football coach for six years,
will go on trial for his coaching life tomorrow night.
Sometime after dinner Saturday, the Board of Athletic Control will
convene in its monthly session, and sometime after eight o'clock they will
file out with the biggest athletic news on the Farm since the resignation

â–ºof "Pop" Warner. Anything else the
Board accomplishes at the meeting
will be back-page material.
It was on the night before the Bin
Game in 1935 that the Board renewed
the big mentor's three-year contract
for the first time. That was on the
love of Thorrj,hill's third succes
sive California victory. Now the en
tire picture is one of defeat and grid
iron sadness.
Stanford hasn't beaten California
or Santa Clara since that contract
was signed. The alumni wolves and
the newspaper vultures have for
gotten all the little blurbs they used

to write about "the most noted and
admired coach of his day." Alumni
and newspapers don't remember.
AT FARM 17 YEARS
Thornhill's career at Stanford be
gan as an assistant to Warner. He
kept that role for 11 years before
being elevated in 1932. Thus he has
completed 17 years of Stanford tute
lage without a break.
Before that he was an Ail-Ameri
can tackle at Pittsburgh and coached
a short term at Centre College.
Unlike the action they took on the
first renewal, the B.A.C. has evaded
the reappointment question almost
to its deadline. Inasmuch as the
Thornhill contract officially runs out
on April 1, the Board had only one
more meeting at its disposal before
the expiration date.
SPORTS WRITERS "EXPERTS"
While no member has allowed
himself to be quoted on his views on
the subject, virtually every author
ity and sports page in the state has
claimed a lien on the confidential
material of the entire board. The
theories have run from a complete
house-cleaning of the entire staiT to
a second renewal for Thornhill.
However, most of the sources seem
agreed that some manner of change
will take place in the assistant
coaches' positions. The Board has
always signed the subordinates to
one-year agreements; however, they
may possibly rehire Thornhill with
the understanding that he is to se
lect his own clientele and maintain
complete over-all control. If such a
system were voted through, it would
mark the first time since Warner
that Stanford has had a head coach
in fact as well as in name.
Other first-guessers have for
i warded the assurance that "Spud"
| Lewis, former U.S.F. coach, would
i get an assistant's berth provided he
could find the time to break away
from his insurance trade. Only Jim
Lawson of the present stafY has es
caped marked assault at the hands of
j the astute San Francisco columnists.
Generally speaking campus opin
; ion seems overwhelmingly to favor
"Tiny's" retention for more than one
| year. A mere handful of critics on
I the campus, however, arc hoping for
| a complete revamping, from the
sophomore managers on up.
