# Chaplain Relates Story Of Life in Wales, England
## 
### FRED STETTNER 
"I used to write my Greek les- !
sons on the walls of a slate quarry,'
chuckled Thomas E. Oliver, acting
chaplain of the University, musing
aloud in a thick twanging brogue.
He seemed rather proud of his ac
cent, "It's a mixture of several 1
languages," he volunteered. "I've
lived in Wales, England, Canada, and
the United States long enough to
pick up a somewhat polyglot combi
nation of accents."
Mr. Oliver smiled depracatingly at ]
llit' suggestion that his life had been I
an exceedingly interesting one. "Ev
erything just happened," his glance j
seemed to say.
Ho was born in North Wales, Eng- i
land. When he was still young, the j
family moved to Yorkshire, where I
his father met with a fatal accident, j
and young Thomas Oliver was tak- '<
en in by an English family.
Things went smoothly for some I
time, but when he was 14 years old j
hi left school and went to Wales to 1

work in the slate quarries. A labor
strike left him high and dry.
For five years he wandered from
job to job, looking, as he said, "A
very hopeless thing — thin and
scrawny." These years of his life
were fascinating ones, taking hirn
throughout the British Isles and
showing him glimpses of every walk
of life.
At twenty, the advice of a friend
gave him the inspiration to become
a scholar. This new interest in
learning finally led him to a "hybrid
theological and ministerial prepara
tory college in mid-Wales." where
he studied for three years.
LIFE IN HAW
One of his first assignments as a
young and hopeful minister, was
the task of being "sky pilot" for a
group of rough, tough lumber
camps. He termed this a pretty big
order, but admitted that "it was
there that he learned a great deal
about life in the raw."
