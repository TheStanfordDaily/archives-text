# Card Gridders Uphold, Blast Thornhill Regime As Head Stanford Coach
## Collins Presents View of Coaching Set-up Prior to Saturday B.A.c. Meeting; Andersen Supports 'Tiny' 
### FRANK THOMAS COLLINS STAN ANDERSEN 
(Received litis afternoon, the
following comment on the Stan
ford coaching set-up presents the
minority half of a two-sided pic
ture. Because it does so. The
Daily feels it should he printed
as a legitimate comment.—Edi
tor's note)

Because I think that you are not
afraid to print this, because it is
the opinion of a Stanford student
paying his own tuition and quali
fied to know something about the
situation because of two years of
sitting on Mr. Thornhill's bench for
substitute football players, I wish to
express an opinion that I think is
held by the other half of the stu
dents at Stanford University in re
gard to the athletic situation, and in
particular Tiny Thornhill. After
reading the article by Arch Jenkins,
1 wonder why he is running for the
B.A.C. post. It sounds as though he
is already in their employment.
Has anyone ever heard a whimper
from Tiny Thornhill because the
material at Stanford has been woe
fully weak in comparison with other
schools? I should say not, because
Stanford's material has not been
woefully weak as evidenced by the
splendid records of the frosh teams
in the past six years. The influx of
junior college transfers has been
great enough and of good enough
quality to provide excellent addi
tional material as evidenced by the
fact that many of the first-string
men are college transfers.
GRAVY FOR ATHLETES?
As for bemoaning the fact that
Stanford athletes don't get all the
gravy out of the campus stew pot,
since when did athletes acquire the
right to get all the gravy out of any
stew pot, whether it be in cold actual
life or on the Stanford campus?
A certain college might confer ex
tra privileges on its team,
but I have heard that its players
upon graduation are faced with the
handicap of being regarded as far
from prospective material for busi
ness executives.
As for Mr. Thornhill's being a
Stanford gentleman, that is Mr. Arch
Jenkins' opinion. I base my opinion
on what I have observed of Mr.
Thornhill's conduct off the field as
well as on the field, and my opin
ion differs from that of Arch Jen
kins.
The job of being a football coach
at Stanford University, to fit into
the paradoxical system that tries to
bridge the gap between practical
methods and the best theoretical
methods, is indeed a very difficult
one. The man who fills that job
must be one who is almost a magi
cian at satisfying the alumni, the
students, the 8.A.C., and the mem
bers of his own football squad.
Stanford's athletic system, and its
football set-up in particular, needs
a very capable man. He must not
only be a student of the game, a
top row strategist, but a born diplo
mat. If I know Thornhill, he does
not measure up to the job.
If this be treason to my former
coach, then it is treason. My loy
alty is not to any one counterpart
of Stanford University, but to Stan
ford University as a whole.

! (To present the views of an op
posite side of the picture of Stan
ford's coaching set-up. The Daily
last night asked that the follow
ing be written as a rebuttal to the
article appearing in the next col
umn.—Editor's note)

In the first place, I would like to
express my appreciation of The
Daily's attitude. A letter such as
was written by Mr. Collins is dis
tinctly a scoop. To forego such a
scoop because its effect would be
distinctly detrimental to school
prestige is my idea of a commend
able policy. Naturally, the letter, as
expressing a student's viewpoint,
could not be kept out of print. But
the Daily editorial staff, with ad
mirable diplomacy and thoughtful
ness, has justly asked the opinion of
the opposite side—the majority.
For the life of me, I cannot un
derstand why Collins, in biting off'
such a tremendous chunk, does not
have more to say. While I object
strenuously to his criticisms of
Tiny Thornhill, I at least attributed
him with more foresight than the
writing of such an obviously ineffec
tual manuscript.
JUSTIFIES COLLINS
In fact, rather than feeling that 1
should stand up for Tiny's actions, I
feel called upon to justify Collins'
behavior. I consider him a friend
of mine, and dislike to see him
throwing himself to the dogs.
Collins obviously has a gripe. In
his confusion and resentment at the
collegiate football system he has at
tributed all the blame to Tiny
Thornhill. Let me say now, and
firmly, that I know of no finer man
than Tiny, and I express the whole
hearted opinion of last year's team
when I say I feel no man under
like conditions could have done a
better job than he.
PREP VS. COLLEGE GRID
But to continue to justify Collins'
letter. In a large measure I sym
pathize with him. The thing that
he has failed to do is to adjust him
self to the tremendous difference of
collegiate football from high school
football. Nearly everyone admits
the whole intercollegiate football
system could be improved. But the
blame for the unhealthy situation of
collegiate football today does not lie
on the shoulders of such men as
Tiny Thornhill. He love r > the game.
It is his life. It is foolish to think
that he would not devote all his
energies to it, or do a solitary thing
to undermine it.
In regard to his past record, even
in games won and lost, it is good.
But Stanford men should not let
these statistics alone influence them,
for EVERY MAN on last year's
team will stoutly maintain that
Tiny, alone, made a success of the
season even though statistics show
ed it a failure.
During the whole season, not a
single man became discouraged, not
a single man ceased to have fun
playing the game, and. what is more
important, not a singly man but
who found himself lo°.t in admira
tion and respect for Tiny—a coach
who did not consider the first aim
of football winning games, but mold
ing men and character. We never
ceased to fight and smile.
This letter is not meant to put
Tom Collins in a bad light. I don't
believe anything could do that. He
is too well liked and admired. I
write only to show what general
opinion is, and I'm sure that Collins
will realize that his i c the excep
tional case. Stanford men and
women like and admire Tiny
Thornhill. They feel he has done a
good job. His home, his friends, and
his work are here at Stanford.
Here he will stay. Tommy Collins
may rant at collegiate football all
he wishes; and I will agree with him.
But he is wrong to aim his barbs at
Tiny. I sincerely hope that he will
see his error.
