FOR three days, Slants got by
without a mishap. Then the inevi
table happened. Somebody sneaked
up behind me and kicked me in
the stomach when my back was
turned. I am not a tool of the
B.A.C. but I am also a tool.
UNFORTUNATELY we couldn't
print a letter like the one my good
friend Tommy Collins sent in with
out giving the unsuspecting hun
dreds who admire and respect
"Tiny" Thornhill a chance at re
buttal. Picking Stan Andersen for
the job was nothing short of a co
incidence because we started at left
end and called until we found
someone at home.
Andersen is no mug. He is un
doubtedly a stand-out as tin ath
lete, but his performances as a cam
pus leader, as a speaker and student
require little addenda. His most ex
cellent rebuttal is not only in the
best Emily Post jargon but it needs
no superfluous comment from an
outside source.

RUT Collins has a constitutional
right to state his beliefs. Far away
as they may be from ours, they do
nevertheless deserve recognition for
what they may contain. If everyone
agreed on an athletic coach, thex-3
wouldn't be any petty squabbles.
We could hire our mentors for life.
Anyhow, the New Deal will be
shuffled tomorrow; and we'll bet
you find that Tiny will put an extra
quarter in the collection plate Sun
day morning.
IT'S unfortunate that the coaching
predicament will take up most of
the Board's time since the gentle
men will undoubteoly postpone a
piece of business that has been
tabled so much it is beginning to
grow legs. The deferred question,
naturally, is. the oft-evaded issue jf
a set of bleachers for Angell Field.
If we had only had foresight
enough to start a littlo drive a month
ago, we could have had 2000 signa
tures and letters from half of Stan
ford's alumni gx-oup on a "bleacher
petition" which the B.A.C. could
hardly ignore. As the battle has
been fought thus fax 1 , little groups
of two and thxee students make
muffled pleas to the boax'd and then
turn ai-ound to be i-udely kicked
into the fifth row of their prospec
tive bleachers.
Yet, if the Boai'd fails to start
work on the seats in ten or twelve
days, there won't be any U.S.C.
meet on the Angell lay-out. The
ground is clear and ready for use;
all workmen need now is a signal
from the powers that be and the
paltry two or thx-ee dollax-s per seat
that estimates have fixed as a maxi
mum expense.
♦ * *
When our proposed bleachers are
finished, we hope to seat 15,000; but
if it pleases the moguls, we'll settle
for 5000 this year and the balance
before the Big Meet in 1940. Five
thousand times two and one-half is
a mere $12,500. That's exactly
$17,500 less than the amount one of
the board members once I'equested
for a set of four-wall hand-ball
coui'ts.
And after all, don't the best track
teams and the most successful track
coach in this universe of ours at
least deserve a home field?

THIS B.A.C. meeting has made
us almost forget about the basket
ball game at Bei'keley tonight. If
Evex-ett Dean's men don't tie up in
the big pavilion ovejf there, bet your
nickels on them at 3 to 1 and look
for a decided upset.

IT'S unfortunate that the coaching
predicament will take up most of
the Board's time since the gentle
men will undoubteoly postpone a
piece of business that has been
tabled so much it is beginning to
grow legs. The deferred question,
naturally, is. the oft-evaded issue jf
a set of bleachers for Angell Field.
If we had only had foresight
enough to start a littlo drive a month
ago, we could have had 2000 signa
tures and letters from half of Stan
ford's alumni gx-oup on a "bleacher
petition" which the B.A.C. could
hardly ignore. As the battle has
been fought thus fax 1 , little groups
of two and thxee students make
muffled pleas to the boax'd and then
turn ai-ound to be i-udely kicked
into the fifth row of their prospec
tive bleachers.
Yet, if the Boai'd fails to start
work on the seats in ten or twelve
days, there won't be any U.S.C.
meet on the Angell lay-out. The
ground is clear and ready for use;
all workmen need now is a signal
from the powers that be and the
paltry two or thx-ee dollax-s per seat
that estimates have fixed as a maxi
mum expense.
♦ * *
When our proposed bleachers are
finished, we hope to seat 15,000; but
if it pleases the moguls, we'll settle
for 5000 this year and the balance
before the Big Meet in 1940. Five
thousand times two and one-half is
a mere $12,500. That's exactly
$17,500 less than the amount one of
the board members once I'equested
for a set of four-wall hand-ball
coui'ts.
And after all, don't the best track
teams and the most successful track
coach in this universe of ours at
least deserve a home field?

THIS B.A.C. meeting has made
us almost forget about the basket
ball game at Bei'keley tonight. If
Evex-ett Dean's men don't tie up in
the big pavilion ovejf there, bet your
nickels on them at 3 to 1 and look
for a decided upset.
FOR three days, Slants got by
without a mishap. Then the inevi
table happened. Somebody sneaked
up behind me and kicked me in
the stomach when my back was
turned. I am not a tool of the
B.A.C. but I am also a tool.
UNFORTUNATELY we couldn't
print a letter like the one my good
friend Tommy Collins sent in with
out giving the unsuspecting hun
dreds who admire and respect
"Tiny" Thornhill a chance at re
buttal. Picking Stan Andersen for
the job was nothing short of a co
incidence because we started at left
end and called until we found
someone at home.
Andersen is no mug. He is un
doubtedly a stand-out as tin ath
lete, but his performances as a cam
pus leader, as a speaker and student
require little addenda. His most ex
cellent rebuttal is not only in the
best Emily Post jargon but it needs
no superfluous comment from an
outside source.

RUT Collins has a constitutional
right to state his beliefs. Far away
as they may be from ours, they do
nevertheless deserve recognition for
what they may contain. If everyone
agreed on an athletic coach, thex-3
wouldn't be any petty squabbles.
We could hire our mentors for life.
Anyhow, the New Deal will be
shuffled tomorrow; and we'll bet
you find that Tiny will put an extra
quarter in the collection plate Sun
day morning.
