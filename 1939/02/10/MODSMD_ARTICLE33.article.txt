# Frosh Cagers Face Cubs
## Teams Open Came With Terms Even Both Scouted Squads Expected to Spring Last-minute Tricks 
### 
To date hardly anyone—outside of
the scribes who have been assigned
to cover the spox*t—has taken much
notice of the basketball teams of the
classes of '42 at Stanford and Cal.
But tonight the two rival frosh
outfits conduct their own individual
battle of the hardwood court at
6:30 o'clock in Berkeley's pavilion
as a preliminary to the varsity hoop
engagement.
ANNUAL SERIES
From all indications, however,
both quintets have been leading up
to their annual gigantic three-game
series with more than a fair amount

I of success and should go into to
i night's fray on about even terms.
As far as the relative strength of
j the first strings is concerned, nei- j
i ther five will boast advantage over j
the other unless it is Cal because j
four of its starting five men played j
jat University High School in San I
i Francisco together two yeaxs ago.
| PAPOOSES CLICK
After a bad start last December, i
the Papooses have been since mold- j
; ed together by Coach H. B. (Beeb)
. Lee into a smooth-functioning unit.!
I which has clicked when the stakes
were down and performed in hot
| and cold terms against mediocre ;
j clubs this season.
Both rivals have taken turns |
scouting the other so any surprises j
which may be pulled v.ill have been \
figured out is week in drills. Lee j
found Cal's frosh shooting every- !
thing they hod last Sn'urday when;
the Bearcubs lost a 39-38 thriller j
to Santa Clara's yearlings in a fu- !
tile attempt to nab a victory. Coach !
Bob Herwi.?, ex-Pear center and
footballer, was in the local Pavilion
; several weeks ago. scouting for both j
IN'ibs Pricj and his o.vn club.
STANFORD HEIGHT
Height is more evenly distributed
on Cal's team, --dt hough the averages
will find the Papooses on par in that
department. Stanford's stai'ting
line-up will have Chuck Smith and j
Gllie Hamlin at guards and Dick '
Ray at fox*ward, who are only 5:10. j
Bob Penn at 6:5 and Bill Cowden
at 6:2 1 /3.wi1l make up for this disad
vantage in the fi'ont lank. By sub
stituting either Lew Reese or Verne
Hoffman at forward for Ray, the j
club will be able to top the Bear j
cagers.
