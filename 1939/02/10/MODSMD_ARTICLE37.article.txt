# For What It May Mean

SPECULATION, at best a risky business, is
now at its highest. At the crest of the
question mark sits Coach Tiny Thornhill and
the Board of Athletic Control.
Tomorrow night, the Board must act on the
renewal of his contract.
So far, canny Board members have given
no indications of whether that renewal will or
will not be offered. ;
Tiny, not knowing exactly where he stands,
has remained discreetly non-committal. "I will
consider any offers that are made" is the sub
stance of his comment.
It is no easy matter for the Board to make a
decision. Either way undoubtedly possesses
certain advantages and disadvantages and only
the Board is in a position to make a final and
adequate choice between the two.
However, on the basis of known facts, Mr.
Thornhill's record is not so unimpressive as
certain disgruntled sports writers, alumni, and
students declare.
In reply to their comments, only this need be
said: "What do you expect, a complete victory
every year?"
An answer in the affirmative doesn't make
sense.
Tiny joined the Stanford coaching staff un
der a tremendous handicap—in direct compari
son to "Pop" Warner, still known as one of the
United States' best coaches. And Stanford has
never let Tiny forget it.
In 1933, 1934, and 1935, however, he beat
California, put Stanford in the Rose Bowl with
the "Vow Boys."
The next year's squad looked feeble —and
the next, and the next.
Perhaps, however, they were not as bad as
pictured. The 1938 team ended low in the Con
ference, but gave the Golden Bear one of the
closest shaves it's ever been given.
In 1937, the Farm ended in second place,
with only the Big Game standing between it
and a tie for first. In 1936, the standing was
fourth.
In the face of this record, in consideration of
the fine football teams he has coached, in re
spect to his wholly unselfish work and his con
tribution to Stanford as a trainer of athletes:
For what it may be worth, The Daily recom
mends retention of Stanford's Tiny Thornhill.
