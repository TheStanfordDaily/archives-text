IT is Stanford's right to express its opinion in
The Daily; today, The Daily received a highly
opinionated letter from a former member of
Tiny Thornhill's football squad.
The letter, an almost perfect expression of
one side to the argument of whether or not
Coach Thornhill should be retained, is more
than the expression of a single personality. At
the same time, it is so highly opinionated, that
some answer is necessary.
Stan Andersen, as a member of that same
football team, was finally persuaded to write it.
At first, he contended it was too much re
sponsibility for The Daily to assume to print
such a letter in the face of the criticism and
the publicity that may ensue.
Stanford's students, however, supporting a
newspaper with funds, at least have a right to
that newspaper's Campus Opinion columns in
regard to student activities such as football,
whether their opinion agrees or disagrees with
editorial views. To refuse such access would
be as high a degree of suppression as exercised
in less democratic circumstances.
In place of a jump to the quick conclusion
that these expressions of opinion are not worth
possible, and only possible, comment else
where, Stanford should remember its own
motto:
"Die Luft der Freiheit weht."
