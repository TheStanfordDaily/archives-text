# . . . of Freedom Blow
## 
### 
THIS is the enlightened world of the twen
tieth century. The present generation has
seen intellectual progress and scientific dis
covery unparalleled in the history of education.
Yet, last week the University of Berlin opened
its new Anti-Semitic Department with a speech
by Julius Streicher, in which he officially in
formed German students that any scientific
discovery made by a Jew is false and invalid.
Obviously, something is wrong with this
picture.
With the advent of the totalitarian govern
ments, intolerance has built an insurmountable
barrier in the path of intellectual freedom. Pro
lessors have lost the right to teach the truth
as they see it.

Not only the absolutist states have suffered.
Unofficial intolerance, in the form of prejudice,
menaces free thought under democratic govern
ments, including our own, and constitutes al
most as great a danger as canned ideas issued
by the dictators.
On the birthday of Abraham Lincoln scien
tists and teachers of the United States will
hold meetings at 26 universities in order to
bring to the attention of the public the menace
of bigotry as it affects intellectual freedom.
Following in the path of the apostle of toler
ance, these faculty meetings will adopt reso
lutions stressing the necessity of intellectual
freedom in a democracy.
Here the educators have a point well taken.
Their resolutions will have no effect on the
dictators of Europe, secure within their fort
resses of propaganda. But, they will make a
number of Americans realize that science and
intellectual development cannot flourish where
prejudice exists.
Jf % only a few men are made to realize the
danger that lurks in preconceived ideas as a
result of the Lincoln's birthday meeting, it will,
in a measure, have justified itself.â€”L. L.
