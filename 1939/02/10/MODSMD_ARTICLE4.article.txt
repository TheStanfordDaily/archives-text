# Wary Indian Five Meets Cal Tonight
## Bears Await Underdogs In Berkeley Revamped Quintet Tangles before 8000 In Crucial Game 
### JERRY MAYER 
A wild-eyed Indian, fearfully
holding his scalp, will creep cau
tiously into the Berkeley gym to
night at 8 o'clock.
On the other side of the arena
there will be a huge Bear hungrily
flicking the foam from his chops.
Watching this gladatorial contest
will be a capacity audience of 8000
spectators, who will signify by
either "thumbs-up" or "thumbs
down" whether they want the poor
er competitor slain or not.
IN OTHER WORDS
Of course, this is all a very fancy
way of saying Stanford's basketball
team journeys across the bay to
night to face the University of Cali
fornia's first-place aggregation be
fore a jammed gym of 8000.
Coach Nibs Price's Bears are the
favorites over the Indians, with their
45-29 victory in the first 1939 Big
Game merely emphasizing their ob
vious superiority. And that
"thumbs" treatment may be more
real than it reads.
THUMBS UP?
Cal's gym is notorious for being
the home of official baiting and
partisan rooters. If the Cards suc
cumb meekly to the onslaught of
the Bears the rooters' attitude will
undoubtedly be one of "thumbs
up"—or "What, (he h , let the
poor guy live."
However, if the Cards fight back
viciously—keep the score close and
perhaps rough it up a little—then
the verdict, expressed in lusty howls
and snarling faces will be "thumbs
down" and "Kill those *&!"%•%."
ZONNE WARMING UP
It's a different Stanford team that
faces Cal tonight from the one the
Bears met in the Pavilion three
weeks ago. Captain Phil Zonne was
at the height of his scoring slump
then. But Phil i.-; starting to pot
them again, and the improvement
the team has shown takes some of
Ihe pressure off his shoulders in
stead of forcing him to be the key
man in both the defense and of
fense.
In the other forward position,
Coach Everett Dean has found Har
lan Copsey, a transfer from Santa
Rosa J. C. who was on the squad
last year but didn't get in one
conference game and very few
practice tilts. Copsey is a rugged
boy who can take care of himself
in those melees around the baskets,
besides being a good one-hand
shooter.
RELIEVE OR NOT
Strangely enough Copsey and
Zonne, the two sharp-shooting for
wards," both wear glasses off the
court, and really need them. Both
of them have trouble reading the
scoreboard and time clock when
they're in the game.
Don Burness at center will bo in
far better shape than when he first
faced the Bears. Don's knee has
been rapidly healing and his confi
dence has been bolstered by expe
rience.
LYON Oi l RENCH
On the defense will be one face
the Bears will recognize, one thev
won't. They'll remember Kenny
Davidson, but Dick Lyon didn't
play much against them in the first
game. Davidson has been the stead
iest. player on an up-and-down
team. Lyon is back on the regulars
again after warming the bench for
several weeks after his early-season
tenure as a first-stringer.
Bob Burnett and Bill Rapp both
started the first Big Game, and
probably -will see action tonif'ht.
Rapp held Cal's Bill Ogilvie to two
field goals and lie may come in
handy tonight in throttling the Bear
giant. Burnett's lack of height has
counted heavily against him, but if
he can start sinking his long one
handers, he'll see plenty of playing
time.
Don Williamss will be an abso
stranger to the Bears but if the
soph gets in. he's the type that
makes friends easily even if ho
has to climb all over them on the
basketball court.

IN OTHER WORDS
Of course, this is all a very fancy
way of saying Stanford's basketball
team journeys across the bay to
night to face the University of Cali
fornia's first-place aggregation be
fore a jammed gym of 8000.
Coach Nibs Price's Bears are the
favorites over the Indians, with their
45-29 victory in the first 1939 Big
Game merely emphasizing their ob
vious superiority. And that
"thumbs" treatment may be more
real than it reads.
THUMBS UP?
Cal's gym is notorious for being
the home of official baiting and
partisan rooters. If the Cards suc
cumb meekly to the onslaught of
the Bears the rooters' attitude will
undoubtedly be one of "thumbs
up"—or "What, (he h , let the
poor guy live."
However, if the Cards fight back
viciously—keep the score close and
perhaps rough it up a little—then
the verdict, expressed in lusty howls
and snarling faces will be "thumbs
down" and "Kill those *&!"%•%."
ZONNE WARMING UP
It's a different Stanford team that
faces Cal tonight from the one the
Bears met in the Pavilion three
weeks ago. Captain Phil Zonne was
at the height of his scoring slump
then. But Phil i.-; starting to pot
them again, and the improvement
the team has shown takes some of
Ihe pressure off his shoulders in
stead of forcing him to be the key
man in both the defense and of
fense.
In the other forward position,
Coach Everett Dean has found Har
lan Copsey, a transfer from Santa
Rosa J. C. who was on the squad
last year but didn't get in one
conference game and very few
practice tilts. Copsey is a rugged
boy who can take care of himself
in those melees around the baskets,
besides being a good one-hand
shooter.
RELIEVE OR NOT
Strangely enough Copsey and
Zonne, the two sharp-shooting for
wards," both wear glasses off the
court, and really need them. Both
of them have trouble reading the
scoreboard and time clock when
they're in the game.
Don Burness at center will bo in
far better shape than when he first
faced the Bears. Don's knee has
been rapidly healing and his confi
dence has been bolstered by expe
rience.
LYON Oi l RENCH
On the defense will be one face
the Bears will recognize, one thev
won't. They'll remember Kenny
Davidson, but Dick Lyon didn't
play much against them in the first
game. Davidson has been the stead
iest. player on an up-and-down
team. Lyon is back on the regulars
again after warming the bench for
several weeks after his early-season
tenure as a first-stringer.
Bob Burnett and Bill Rapp both
started the first Big Game, and
probably -will see action tonif'ht.
Rapp held Cal's Bill Ogilvie to two
field goals and lie may come in
handy tonight in throttling the Bear
giant. Burnett's lack of height has
counted heavily against him, but if
he can start sinking his long one
handers, he'll see plenty of playing
time.
Don Williamss will be an abso
stranger to the Bears but if the
soph gets in. he's the type that
makes friends easily even if ho
has to climb all over them on the
basketball court.
