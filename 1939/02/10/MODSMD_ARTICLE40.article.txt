# BULL SESSION
## COLD COMFORT 
### JOHN COBBS 
AS a small child I was told that every cloud has a
silver lining, and until I came to Stanford I be
lieved that this was one of the first principles of
meteorology. But as far as I can see the moist gray
mists that slosh around our campus haven't even a
chromium plate.
I realize that any comment on Stanford weather is
essentially destructive criticism. I have no program of
reform to offer, and I do not say that I could do it
better. But it might be well to register an objection
to this last week's weather on the chance that an influ
ential angel will see it. Besides it won't hurt to get
something in the record to show that even The Daily
staff gets out of doors occasionally.

The trouble with our current cold wave is that it's
too mild to be romantic and too severe for comfort.
We have to sneeze our miserable way along the Quad,
knowing that a messy little 39 degrees is not a record
for anything. And as we paddle across the parking
lot we are deprived of the consoling thought that
with a little stretching of fact we can tell our children
how we had to bound across ice pans coming to
school.
The weather now is just annoyingly uncomfortable,
not romantically bitter. As we shiver, we think of
the blizzards our pioneer forefathers had to endure,
and we feel a little ashamed, which doesn't make us
any happiex\
JJESIDES that, the weather is never cold enough to
provide us with an excuse for indulging that dress
up complex that lurks in eveiy man's nature. We have
no reason for wearing coonskin coats and mangy felt
hats, so that we can look like real college men. And
when the thermometer is carrying on only a mild
flirtation with the freezing mark, we cannot climb into
mackinaws and ski hats like virile movie woodsmen.
All we can do is shiver in our raincoats and look like
the uncomfortable bourgeois we are.
Women have the same trouble. It's too cold for
sweaters, and too warm to provide an excuse for
showing off furs. They have to be satisfied with cloth
coats that muffle uninterestingly instead of adding
intriguing mystery.

Fraternity men are faced with a soul-searing
choice between hot water and heat; the furnaces can't
produce both. Houses are split over the question, and
some of the men are developing psychoses. Others
have sworn they will give up bathing rather than let
the frosty drafts whicker about wet legs.
There is no use looking for compensations. As far
as I can see, only the Kleenex company is satisfied.

provide us with an excuse for indulging that dress
up complex that lurks in eveiy man's nature. We have
no reason for wearing coonskin coats and mangy felt
hats, so that we can look like real college men. And
when the thermometer is carrying on only a mild
flirtation with the freezing mark, we cannot climb into
mackinaws and ski hats like virile movie woodsmen.
All we can do is shiver in our raincoats and look like
the uncomfortable bourgeois we are.
Women have the same trouble. It's too cold for
sweaters, and too warm to provide an excuse for
showing off furs. They have to be satisfied with cloth
coats that muffle uninterestingly instead of adding
intriguing mystery.

Fraternity men are faced with a soul-searing
choice between hot water and heat; the furnaces can't
produce both. Houses are split over the question, and
some of the men are developing psychoses. Others
have sworn they will give up bathing rather than let
the frosty drafts whicker about wet legs.
There is no use looking for compensations. As far
as I can see, only the Kleenex company is satisfied.
AS a small child I was told that every cloud has a
silver lining, and until I came to Stanford I be
lieved that this was one of the first principles of
meteorology. But as far as I can see the moist gray
mists that slosh around our campus haven't even a
chromium plate.
I realize that any comment on Stanford weather is
essentially destructive criticism. I have no program of
reform to offer, and I do not say that I could do it
better. But it might be well to register an objection
to this last week's weather on the chance that an influ
ential angel will see it. Besides it won't hurt to get
something in the record to show that even The Daily
staff gets out of doors occasionally.

The trouble with our current cold wave is that it's
too mild to be romantic and too severe for comfort.
We have to sneeze our miserable way along the Quad,
knowing that a messy little 39 degrees is not a record
for anything. And as we paddle across the parking
lot we are deprived of the consoling thought that
with a little stretching of fact we can tell our children
how we had to bound across ice pans coming to
school.
The weather now is just annoyingly uncomfortable,
not romantically bitter. As we shiver, we think of
the blizzards our pioneer forefathers had to endure,
and we feel a little ashamed, which doesn't make us
any happiex\
JJESIDES that, the weather is never cold enough to
provide us with an excuse for indulging that dress
up complex that lurks in eveiy man's nature. We have
