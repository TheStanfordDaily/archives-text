### DOUG JAQUES 
CHARGE IT
One of the boys clashed frantically into the room of
the guy who runs the Toyon coke machine the other
night.
"I golta have some nickcls," he screamed.
"Well, I have a couple here."
"I gotta have a lot of nickels."
Thinking it was some sort of a joke, the cokeman
said, "I can give you ten dollars worth. Will that do? '
"They'll help. Quick. Give them to me."
Still thinking it was a joke, the cokeman took the
frantic one downstairs. He opened up the coke ma
chine and slowly began counting out the nickels. Then
he started wondering who was pulling whose leg.
He stopped counting.
"Say," he said. "Why do you want all these
nickels?"
"I just called my girl in Colorado. I talked 30 min
utes overtime."
The guy gave him the nickels, and went to the
phone with him while he put them in.
He was there for quite a while.
It takes quite a while to put $15 in nickels in a
pay telephone.

CHUB
She's quite a character.
She hadn't been around the Shack for two weeks
when people knew she loved nothing so much as
athletes en masse, unless it were athletics en masse.
We saw her rabidly follow football last year, and
then when basketball and Luiset.ti entered the sports
spotlight, we never saw such a girl.
How she did rave.
And all last quarter we saw her heckle Shallcnbcrger
to get him to let her write sports.
"Why," I asked her one day, "don't you become
a female athlete, and be famous, too. Exercise would
be a fine thing for you."
"No. Makes muscles."
As the guy who saw the beautiful blonde in the
ballet said, muscles arc death to romance.
But this volume she is happy. The new sports edi
tor is letting her write n few stories about basketball.
Every afternoon she goes skipping gaily over to the
Pavilion to get her story. Around her neck, where
other girls might, wear a necklace, she wears two very
small boxing gloves . . .
"Aren't they surprised to see you come over to get
the story?" I asked her.
"Well, Dean wasn't," she said. "But Liebcndorfcr
was."
She's very happy.
