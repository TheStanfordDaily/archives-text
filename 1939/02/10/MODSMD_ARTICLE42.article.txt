The Editor. Sir:
Now that the excitement occa
sioned by the recent rushing season
has died down, it might be perti
nent to call attention to one or two
significant points which were over
looked in the discussion.
Sororities and fraternities are, in
their simplest analysis, merely liv
ing groups. They have existed for
many years, and will doubtless con
tinue to exist, because they satisfy
an almost universal urge of the hu
man animal —to live with a small
group of his choice under as com
fortable conditions as he can afford.
That is all.
Housing in the mass, and feeding
in the mass may have unquestioned
economic advantages, and perhaps
social advantages, but few persons
will accept such conditions of life
if they can afford the comfort and
convenience of a small group. If
the latter is undemocratic, as some
allege, then human nature is un
democratic.
MEMBER IN NEW ENGLAND
I entered a fraternity many years
ago in a small New England college.
The thrifty Yankees who conducted
that institution looked upon the fra
ternities with high favor, their mot
to seemed to be "more and better
fraternities." So, with the years,
more and more groups were added
as the student body increased in
numbers.
These New England administra
tors were very wise, from an eco
nomic if not from a social point of
view. Through the years the alumni
and friends of the fraternities have
contributed hundreds of thousands
of dollars for the housing of stu
dents, thus saving such an invest
ment by the college.
More than that, every year they
contribute tens of thousands of dol
lars for maintenance and even for
some of the running expenses. This
permits the fraterpities to offer su
perior living accommodations at a
price as low or even lower than the
mass-housing of the dormitories.
EXPENSE PROBLEM
If Stanford University tried to op
erate the sorority and fraternity
houses, offering the same accommo
dations they now give their mem
bers, one of two things would hap
pen; the charges would be so high
that only extremely well-to-do stu
dents could afford to live in them,
or, the University would have to
charge a considerable part of the
running expenses to the general in
come.
Whenever a university takes
money out of the general income to
subsidize the living expenses of any
part, of the students, it is engaging
in a very dubious practice. This must
not be confused with individual
grants on the basis of scholarship
or need.
The solution of the living group
problem at Stanford, as I have seen
it for many years, is along the
lines adopted by many other uni
versities, namely, "more and bet
ter" living groups. The sorority
problem at Stanford has been ac
centuated in recent years by the
ruling (when or by whom I have
never been able to ascertain) that
no more sorority living groups may
be established at Stanford. The very
fact that, each year a large number
of women prefer to live in small
groups rather than in the loveliest
dormitory in America — Lagunita
Hall—should indicate that the "writ
ing on the wall" is not yet very leg
ible. The "march of events" may
destroy the living groups here, but
it cannot destroy the human urge
which today keeps them flourishing
in almost every college and univer
sity in our land.

ternities with high favor, their mot
to seemed to be "more and better
fraternities." So, with the years,
more and more groups were added
as the student body increased in
numbers.
These New England administra
tors were very wise, from an eco
nomic if not from a social point of
view. Through the years the alumni
and friends of the fraternities have
contributed hundreds of thousands
of dollars for the housing of stu
dents, thus saving such an invest
ment by the college.
More than that, every year they
contribute tens of thousands of dol
lars for maintenance and even for
some of the running expenses. This
permits the fraterpities to offer su
perior living accommodations at a
price as low or even lower than the
mass-housing of the dormitories.
EXPENSE PROBLEM
If Stanford University tried to op
erate the sorority and fraternity
houses, offering the same accommo
dations they now give their mem
bers, one of two things would hap
pen; the charges would be so high
that only extremely well-to-do stu
dents could afford to live in them,
or, the University would have to
charge a considerable part of the
running expenses to the general in
come.
Whenever a university takes
money out of the general income to
subsidize the living expenses of any
part, of the students, it is engaging
in a very dubious practice. This must
not be confused with individual
grants on the basis of scholarship
or need.
The solution of the living group
problem at Stanford, as I have seen
it for many years, is along the
lines adopted by many other uni
versities, namely, "more and bet
ter" living groups. The sorority
problem at Stanford has been ac
centuated in recent years by the
ruling (when or by whom I have
never been able to ascertain) that
no more sorority living groups may
be established at Stanford. The very
fact that, each year a large number
of women prefer to live in small
groups rather than in the loveliest
dormitory in America — Lagunita
Hall—should indicate that the "writ
ing on the wall" is not yet very leg
ible. The "march of events" may
destroy the living groups here, but
it cannot destroy the human urge
which today keeps them flourishing
in almost every college and univer
sity in our land.

Now that the excitement occa
sioned by the recent rushing season
has died down, it might be perti
nent to call attention to one or two
significant points which were over
looked in the discussion.
Sororities and fraternities are, in
their simplest analysis, merely liv
ing groups. They have existed for
many years, and will doubtless con
tinue to exist, because they satisfy
an almost universal urge of the hu
man animal —to live with a small
group of his choice under as com
fortable conditions as he can afford.
That is all.
Housing in the mass, and feeding
in the mass may have unquestioned
economic advantages, and perhaps
social advantages, but few persons
will accept such conditions of life
if they can afford the comfort and
convenience of a small group. If
the latter is undemocratic, as some
allege, then human nature is un
democratic.
