Open to the whole campus, the
February 17 Military Ball will fea
ture the music of Gus Arnheim, his
orchestra, and Vyola Vonn, his vo
calist. The ball is to be held under
the auspices of the Scabbard and
Blade Society.
"This dance promises to be the
only big name formal dance of the
quarter now that the Junior Prom
has been postponed," said Jack
Nisson, general chairman of the
ball.
Arnheim's orchestra, scheduled to
open at San Francisco on the fol
lowing day, has just returned from
the east to open the Fair.
Before going East Arnheim spent
three years playing for the stars of
movie-land at the famous Cocoanut
Grove of the Los Angeles Ambassa
dor Hotel where he featured as
stellar vocalist Bing Crosby, who
had at that time just left Paul
Whiteman.
After leaving the Grove, Arnheim
came to San Francisco to the Mural
Room of the St. Francis Hotel where
he played several seasons to record
crowds.
The price of the bids is $3.50, the
price charged in the past for the
Junior Prom. The bids are now on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office. The num
ber of bids has be~n limited to 450
in order to allow plenty of room for
dancing.
