harsh, mechanical voice, in tune
with warning sirens, blasted
through murky London midnights
during the air-raids of the last war.
When the nations of Europe tot
tered on the edge of armed conflict
over Hitler's Czechoslovakia!! ex
pansion last fall, England suddenly
realized that she was unprepared,
helpless if those bombers should
break the beam of London's search
lights again. With typical British
determination the people swiftly
started organizing an adequate sys
tem of defense for the little island.
* * *
/ |N the other side of the Atlantic.
Americans reading their news
papers and listening to their ra
dios during the Munich crisis all
at once understood how great was
the necessity of being prepared in
case war should come. The
wheels of the Department of War
started to turn, grinding out
schemes for the protection of the
United States.
Early in the current session of
Congress, President Roosevelt pre
sented his $76,000,000 bill, calcu
lated to provide for national de
fense. The measure stands, as yet,
unpassed.
* sjt
the voice of the man
largely responsible for the de
termination of our foreign policy
boldly announced to the world that
the United States is set to resist any
challenge to her interests. Secre
tary of State Cordell Hull speeded
the passage of the defense bill when
he spoke in favor of adequate arma
ments as the surest and safest way
of preserving peace.
Hull's specch was positive proof
that the nation's leaders realize
that the United States cannot af
ford not to play safe. Peace is a
wonderful idea, but we've got to
be ready—just in case.

r JPHIS is Italy's week to be seduc
tive; she is busy throwing roses
from her balcony to the government
of Insurgent Spain. The reason for
the change in Mussolini's attitude
toward the land where he threat
ened to keep his troops until Com
munism is stamped out lies in Eng
land's and France's overtures to the
Rebels.
With bait, of much-needed loans
to Franco, the democratic powers
are trying to lure him away from
his alliance with the Rome-Berlin
axis. When II Duce smelled the
plot, he immediately gave Spain a
fatherly pat on the back and an
nounced that hi', intentions go no
further than assuring Spain a gov
ernment safe from foreign interven
tion. To this sweet song, Mussolini
beat out an obligato, telling of the
dangers of an alliance with France
and the raw deal she gave Italy
after the Great War.

\J/IIETIIER or no f Spain will
desert her Fascist friends re
mains a question, but the foreign
ministries of both England and
France are preparing to recognize
the Insurgent government this
week.
Returning to Madrid yesterday,
the bedraggled remains of the Loy
alist leadership was welcomed with
a salute of Rebel bombs which
killed 1G citizens of the capital. This
greeting is indicative of the rough
treatment the Republicans are bound
to receive if they insist on resisting
the army that has already won the
war.

r PHE largest open space in the
tiny Papal State, within the
walls of Rome, is the post-card
piazza before the great Hasilica
of St. Peters. There yesterday
500,000 devout Catholics waited
their turn to view the body of the
dead Pope Pius XI.
As the day wore on, the huge
crowd grew restless, surged forward
toward the guarded entrance to the
cathedral. The temporary wooden
barrier that had been erected crash
ed to the ground, hundreds fainted,
and the doors of St. Peters had to
be closed for the day in order to
prevent, a riot.
The late pontiff will be buried at
dusk tomorrow while the members
of the College of Cardinals assemble
in Rome for the election of the 262 nd

r PHE largest open space in the
tiny Papal State, within the
walls of Rome, is the post-card
piazza before the great Hasilica
of St. Peters. There yesterday
500,000 devout Catholics waited
their turn to view the body of the
dead Pope Pius XI.
As the day wore on, the huge
crowd grew restless, surged forward
toward the guarded entrance to the
cathedral. The temporary wooden
barrier that had been erected crash
ed to the ground, hundreds fainted,
and the doors of St. Peters had to
be closed for the day in order to
prevent, a riot.
The late pontiff will be buried at
dusk tomorrow while the members
of the College of Cardinals assemble
in Rome for the election of the 262 nd
Pope.
