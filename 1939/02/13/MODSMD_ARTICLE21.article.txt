# Board Reappoints 'Tiny' Thornhill
## Coaching Staff Remains Basically Same Following Saturday B.A.C. Meeting President Wilbur's Approval Needed To Seal Bargain; Grayson Retained As Assistant at Mentor's Request Daily Sports Editor 
### ARCH JENKINS 
It took everyone else nearly three months to predict who would coach
football at Stanford in 1939; it took the Board of Athletic Control half an
hour Saturday night to decide they didn't want any changes.
"Tiny" Thornhill, incumbent head coach .and Bobby Grayson, the
only assistant whose contract runs out this year, were again appointed to

the stall as the long verbal war be
tween widely spilt factions came to
a sudden end. Only the approval of
President Ray Lyman Wilbur and
the acceptance of the terms by the
two appointees remains to seal the
new bargain.
GRAYSON CONTRACT
The Board rudely quashed the
oft-repeated assertion that Gray
son's services would not be re
newed by offering the ex-all-Ameri
can back a contract which is be
lieved to be similar to the one he
now holds. Terms or salaries were
not publicly announced in either
instance.
As if the fairy tales of the fir.st
guessers were not already quite
well blown up, Thornhill made the
situation much more simple for all
concerned by personally requesting
that Grayson be retained.
Several San Francisco papers had
been especially vehement in declar
ing that disagreements between in
dividual coaches had broken down
the morale of the Indian football
machine last fall.
STAFF BASICALLY SAME
Unless Grayson declines the new
proffer, the grid set-up on the Farm
will be basically the same as it has
been for three years. Jim Lawson
and Ben Winkelman, along with
Chief Scout Husky Hunt, have in
timated no desires to move from
their Stanford posts.
Technically speaking, Thornhill's
contract expires on April 1, while
Grayson's last pay check Is billed
through August 31.
Undoubtedly the Board based
much of its decision on the excel
lent end-of-thc-season record of the
Stanford squad. After a terrific
lacing at the hands of Santa Clara
for the third consecutive year, in the
opening game, the Indians bogged
down for nearly a month before
coming to life against Oregon State.
California then completed their
Big Game triad by winning 6-0,
but Stanford was definitely a supe
rior team that day. A week later
Thornhill tripped a touted Dart
mouth team handily to end a dismal
season with a spark of glory.
