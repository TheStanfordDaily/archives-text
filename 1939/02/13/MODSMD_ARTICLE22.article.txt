# 'Tiny Coaches Here 17 Years
## Thornhill Replaces 'Pop' Warner in 1933 
### 
Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhill and
his three assistant coaches can wipe
their foreheads free of honest per
spiration today following thi mo
mentous Board of Athletic Control
meeting of last Saturday.
The official verdict is that Tiny is
to remain, and also his staff of Bob
by Grayson, Jim Lawson and Ben
Winkelman. Figuring that Tiny is
entitled to three mediocre seasons
after 17 years in the fold, the B.A.C.
voted to retain him as head football
coach.
Thornhill came to Stanford in
1922 as assistant coach to Glenn
Seobie "Pop" Warner, under whom
Tiny had played at. Pittsburgh. For
11 years he assisted the cunning
Warner, and then when the wolves
sent Pop cast to Temple, Tiny
stepped into the pilot's position and
rose to fame as the coach of the
famous Vowing Sophs.
GOOD PLAYERS RENEGE
But the same wolves who sent
Warner flying — meddling alumni
and crackpot newspaper writers —
then started the anvil chorus on
Thornhill when the good material
was scared away by the Vowing
Sophs. No good player wanted to
come to Stanford and sit on the
bench.
So Tiny has been given another
chance, but his material is once
more of a high order and Farm
prospects for 1939 look good.
Grayson, with a lot of enemies
among the San Francisco newspa
permen, has taken a beating during
recent weeks, but Tiny requested
he be signed again—and that is that.
Grayson graduated an all-American
fullback in 1935 with the Vow boys
and took up coaching to help get
through law school. But his coach
ing took too much time and he was
forced to drop law temporarily.
WINKELMAN FROM TEXAS
Ben Winkelman came to Stan
ford in 1936 from Central High
School in Fort Worth, Texas, where
he had been coaching several years.
Winkelman, a graduate of the Uni
versity of Arkansas, was recom
mended to Tiny by "Pop" Warner.
Jim Lawson, was an all-Ameri
can Stanford end in 1924 but didn't
start coaching here until 1933. He is
generally acclaimed as one of the
outstanding end coaches on the
Coast, with some of his greater pu
pils being Keith Topping, "Monk"
Moscrip, and Jack Clark.
