### 
MIAMI, Fla., Feb. 12 (UP). -
President William Green of the
American Federation of Labor to
night announced the A.F.L. execu
tive council had concluded it would
be futile to attempt now to negotiate
peace with the Congress of Indus
trial Organizations.
Green believed the issue of dual
unionism was the greatest obstacle
in the path of peace in labor's bit
terly divided ranks. He considered
the A.F.L. and C.1.0. even farther
apart now than a year ago. Green
made the announcement following
the executive council's study of pos
sible means of peace negotiations,
lie said there was a growing desire
for peace between the A.F.L. and
John L. Lewis' CIO.
