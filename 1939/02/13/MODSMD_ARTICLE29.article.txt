The Editor, Sir:
I note much agitation of late con
cerning labs without funds, pro
fessors without labs, and students
without scholarships.
I also note, in the "Report of the
j Students' Organizations Fund," the
! fact that the Stanford Bookstore as
I of August 31, 1938, had a surplus of
! $81,049.12.
Just as a matter of interest, what's
being done with it?
Curious
