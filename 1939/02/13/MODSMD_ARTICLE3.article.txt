Stefan Zweig, distinguished
author, wanted to see an Indian
when he visited western United
States, but the only ones he saw
were at Stanford.
Maybe that's why he said,
after visiting the campus, "I
have never seen so beautiful a
university as your Stanford.
"How lovely it must be to
study there! I should love to be
a teacher there —even a tutor."
Mr. Zweig spoke Friday at
the Scottish Hitc Auditorium in
San Francisco on "The of
Artistic Creation."
