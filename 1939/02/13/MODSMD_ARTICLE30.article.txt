# 'DOUBLE TAXATION'
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The tri-annual bleeding has just
j taken place, and to judge from the
apathetic attitude of the students, it
j was, as usual, painless. Our fore
i bears cried out against double taxa
: tion, but here we calmly take it in
I the form of syllabus fees, a con
j venient phrase used by the Uni
i versity meaning "soak 'em while we
; can." But why should we have to
1 pay $24 per year on top of $345 tui
! tion for the privilege of learning a
| language? I suppose the exorbitant
I geology lab lee is for the wear and
; tear on the rocks; and I suppose the
I "syllabus fees" for numerous
I courses for which we get not a sheet
of paper is for, shall we say, oiling

the administrative machinery of the
"department."
This apathetic attitude wouldn't
be so evident if Jim and Jane had
to make good those "Pay to the or
der of " slips of paper so non
chalantly filled. But they don't. The
trouble is the Powers That Be know
it.
Just Wondering
