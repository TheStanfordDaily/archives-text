# DECLINATION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Another man and I, representing j
the halls, were nominated for the j
position of junior man on Ex Com- j
mittee. In deference to the Inter- j
club Council, I declined my nomi- j
nation in favor of the other fellow.
Forty-eight hours after I had con
sidered my declination to be fully
and properly executed, the chair
j man of the election board phoned to
I say that although the choice might
S be mine not to run it was none the
' less constitutionally impossible, to
| avoid doing so, because of a tech
i nical error in the mechanics of de
; dining. This is a public announce
| ment to those who were so kind as
1 to support my nomination that a
; further kindness to me would be to I
carry out the wishes of the group !
I which 1 represent.
Bob Livingston
