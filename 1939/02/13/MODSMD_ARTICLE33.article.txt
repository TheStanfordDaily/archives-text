# Massine's New Ballet Climaxes Season in City
## Story of St. Francis Danced to Music By Paul Hindemith 
### 
Reaching the climax of the San
Francisco engagement of the Bal
let Russe de Monte Carlo, Leonide
Massine and his company presented
the American premier of their lat
est work, "St. Francis," last Satur
day night at the San Francisco
opera house.
With music by Paul Hindemith
and the choreography by Massine,
the audience was prepared for
something out of the ordinary, but
not for the exquisite presentation of
St. Francis' conversion to a life of
poverty.
ANGULAR, GRACEFUL
The angular yet graceful move
ments which Nijinsky introduced
were amazingly beautiful as danced
by Massine. The instant he came on
the stage you could feel a change in
the feeling of the other dancers. The
ballet tells the story of St. Francis
meeting with Poverty, Obedience,
and Chastity and his subsequent de
votion to Poverty, with whom he
intends to spend his life.
But modern ballet did not have a
complete triumph over the older
style Saturday night. "Spectre de la
Rose" was as breathtaking as ever,
although it followed the entirely
different "St. Francis." This short
ballet to the music of Weber's "In
vitation to the Dance" has an ap
peal that will last through many
more changes in dancing.
GAY COSTUMES
"Le Beau Danube" is full of peo
ple in yay costumes and bright
scenery, and the music of Strauss
provides a good opportunity for
Massine and Alexandra Danilova,
one of the leading ballerinas, to
dance together. When they dance,
the chorus and minor performers
are unnoticed, but unfortunately
they are not together often enough.
"L'Epreuve D'Amour" serves to
let the lovely Nathalie Krassovska
dance an important part as the
lovely daughter of a rich mandarin.
The choreography of Fokine and
music of Mozart tell the usual story
of thwarted love. Although the
solos are good, the ballet was not
up to the par of the others on the
program. â€”Hovey
