### 
Striking tlu* first decisive blow of (he annual three-game basketball
series, the Farm's yearling quintet blasted away at a stage-struck Cal
frosh outfit, !i(i-24. Friday night.
The Papooses' .'54-28 triumph over Commerce High School of San
Francisco Saturday was far from the impressive performance the> put

on against the Uearcuhs, 4
Keyed up for the Cal struggle, j
the frosh found their shooting eyes.
in fine fettle and were about as
tight as they have been all season i
on defense. They were decidedly in |
form, while their Berkeley rivals j
were far from hot, wilting under the |
pace set by Coach H. B. Lee's hire- I
lings.
FINAL GAMES DUE
The final two games of the e-Eiies |
will be played March 3 and 4 in the j
Berkeley and Stanford pavilions as,
preliminary games to the varsity en- !
counters.
Fifteen field goals were dumped j
into the basket by the Papoose;
club, which lound both Bob Penn i
and Bill Cowden sharing scoring j
honors, while their teammates'
were doing their part by smooth
feeding in of the ball for set shots.
Penn hit the hoop for 10 points
and Cowden sank 9. Lew Reese,
subbing for Dick Ray, tanked 5,
while Chuck Smith netted two field
goals from his guard post.
CARD GUARDS GOOD
The effectiveness of the guarding
of Cowden, Penn, Smith, Ray, and
Ollie Hamlin was easily demonstrat
ed by the holding of all but one of
the starting Cal hoopmen to less
than four points. The only one to
get away regularly was Bob Biles
who took the evening's scoring hon
ors with six field goals and two
foul shots for 14 points. The others,
Norman, Bouhaben, Lafaille, and
Diamond, were unable to cope with
Stanford's guarding.
The frosh ran up a 17-9 lead at
the half and stretched the margin
in the second period enough to al
low Coach Lee to substitute five of
bus best bench-warmers long enough
to score 10 points among them. These
I were Hoffman, Deacon, Reese, Claf
! lin and Breckner.
Three games are on tap for the
frosh this week. San Francisco
Junior College comes here Wed
nesday night, and Palo Alto High
1 School and San Mateo Jaysee test
! the freshmen Friday and Saturday.
