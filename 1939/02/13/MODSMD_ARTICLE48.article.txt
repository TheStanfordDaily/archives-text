# Bear Five Finds Cards Easy; Wins Second Big Game 43-25
## 
### 
Seventy-five hundred basketball fans entered the Berkeley gym last
Friday night firmly convinced that California had a better casaba team
than Stanford. Five hundred fans weren't sure that Cal's superiority was
so pronounced.
But after Cal had chalked up its second straight Big Game victory of
the season, 411-25, the entire 8000 were equally convinced—Stanford's , r )00

rooters and Cal's 7500. 4
Coach Everett Dean has the j
formula to beat the Bears. Realiz- j
ing that the gargantuan Berkeley- i
ites had too much reach for the |
Cards to break straight through j
them, Dean had the Indians play ;
three men out on oft'etue so Cal
would have only two of its giants!
near the hole.
BEARS TOO FAST
But the Bears were just too fast
for the Cards. They covered Stan- !
ford's slow break easily and kept
the Cards from shooting from close !
in. The majority of the Indian shots
were from along the outside lines.
On top of this Stanford had its |
usual trouble in the very complex i
art of placing the little round apple ]
in the netted hoop. A team is doing j
it the hard way when only two of I
its eight players can score field i
goals, and it was just a little too'
difficult for Stanford. Harlan Cop
.sey sunk five field goals and Phil
Zonne four—and Stanford's field 1
goal total was completed.
OGILVIE SCORES 15
Copsey and Zonne each scored 10
points, and the nearest Stanford man
to them got two free throws. Bill
Ogilvie carried off high honors with
15 digits. In the second half Ogilvie
was pouring through his rebounds!
almost at will.
Dean let the second string run i
loose Saturday night as the Cards j
rallied in the last few minutes to 1
defeat the Cal Aggies, 30-26. A pair i
of field goals by Don Williams in
the last minutes sewed up the game
for the Cards.
In Saturday night's game here, i
the Indians nosed out the California
Aggies in the last minutes of play
to win by a score of 30-26.

At affairs of state in Washington,
custom gives precedence to foreign
ambassadors over all American of
ficials except president and vice
president.
