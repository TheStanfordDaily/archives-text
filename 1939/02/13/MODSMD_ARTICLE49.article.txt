# Farm Tankmen Set 6 Records
## Indians Sink San Jose In Two Meets Herron Establishes New National Mark In 440 Free-style 
### 
Completely swamping the San
Jose State varsity and freshman
swimming teams last Friday after
noon, Card tanksters set one new
National Collegiate freshman rec
ord, three new San Jose pool rec
ords, a new Stanford record, and a
new Stanford frosh record. Scores
of the two meets were: varsity—
Stanford 54, San Jose 20; freshman
—Stanford 47, San Jose 27.
Paul Herron, sensational frosh
swim star, brought another national
record to the Farm when he swam
a terrific 440-yard free style race in
2:16, lopping two and Iwo-tenths
seconds from the mark set last year
by a Princeton frosh, Edward
Parke, at 2:18.2. Herron's mark also
became automatically a new Spar
tan pool record.
SETS 140 MARK
Next pace-making performance
came when Bill Weeden swam a
1:40.5 150-yard backstroke race for
the varsity, setting a new pool rec- !
ord and bettering the Pacific Coast j
Conference record by a second and I
a half. Weeden's mark, however, |
does not go down in conference
books, but Coach Nort Thornton
stated that he was sure Weeden
could repeat this mark.
Not satisfied with setting a new
national mark, speedy Paul Herron
set a new Stanford and a new San
Jose pool mark in the 440-yard free
at 4:55.3. The national frosh rec
ord in this event is held by Johnny
Macionis of Yale at 4:55, and was
set in a sensational spurt during his
frosh year at the eastern college.
He has since never bettered 4:55,
but his phenomenal mark still
stands as a very tough hurdle for
Herron to clear.

The frosh 400-yard relay team of
Herron. Brad Young, Gardiner
Miller, and Scott Dudley set a new
Farm frosh record for this event in

jectionable warm temperature of the
water. Hal Weatherbe won both
the 220 and 440, while - Roy Vitou
sek took the 50 and 100. Both relay
teams well outdistanced their op- i

water. Hal Weatherbe won both
the 220 and 440, while - Roy Vitou
sek took the 50 and 100. Both relay
teams well outdistanced their op- i
ponents.
Completely swamping the San
Jose State varsity and freshman
swimming teams last Friday after
noon, Card tanksters set one new
National Collegiate freshman rec
ord, three new San Jose pool rec
ords, a new Stanford record, and a
new Stanford frosh record. Scores
of the two meets were: varsity—
Stanford 54, San Jose 20; freshman
—Stanford 47, San Jose 27.
Paul Herron, sensational frosh
swim star, brought another national
record to the Farm when he swam
a terrific 440-yard free style race in
2:16, lopping two and Iwo-tenths
seconds from the mark set last year
by a Princeton frosh, Edward
Parke, at 2:18.2. Herron's mark also
became automatically a new Spar
tan pool record.
SETS 140 MARK
Next pace-making performance
came when Bill Weeden swam a
1:40.5 150-yard backstroke race for
the varsity, setting a new pool rec- !
ord and bettering the Pacific Coast j
Conference record by a second and I
a half. Weeden's mark, however, |
does not go down in conference
books, but Coach Nort Thornton
stated that he was sure Weeden
could repeat this mark.
Not satisfied with setting a new
national mark, speedy Paul Herron
set a new Stanford and a new San
Jose pool mark in the 440-yard free
at 4:55.3. The national frosh rec
ord in this event is held by Johnny
Macionis of Yale at 4:55, and was
set in a sensational spurt during his
frosh year at the eastern college.
He has since never bettered 4:55,
but his phenomenal mark still
stands as a very tough hurdle for
Herron to clear.
FROSII RECORD
The frosh 400-yard relay team of
Herron. Brad Young, Gardiner
Miller, and Scott Dudley set a new
Farm frosh record for this event in
a 25-yard pool at 3:48 flat.
Winning every first place except \
one, the varsity men turned in good
performances despite the rather ob
jectionable warm temperature of the
water. Hal Weatherbe won both
the 220 and 440, while - Roy Vitou
sek took the 50 and 100. Both relay
teams well outdistanced their op- i
