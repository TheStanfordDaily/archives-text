# Reappointment Okayed

HPINY THORNHILL will be reappointed.
J_ The boys in the city were wrong; Stanford
has decided to re-award him his position as
Head Football Coach.
A certain number of persons v/ill be dis
gruntled over this fact, yet the B.A.C. rightly
feels that he deserves more time before it se
cures someone else to take his place.
Of all the coaches at any university, it would
be impossible to find any coach, no matter
who he is, who has as strong support from the
students and faculty as has Tiny Thornhill.
And if any man deserves a loyal following,
he rightly does.
The position of football coach at a major
school is a delicate one. That much is admitted
by everyone concerned.
And to be a good coach, he needs the sup
port of the campus. It is obvious that this
much is true in Tiny's case.
To be a fully satisfactory coach, he needs
the support of the other part of the "university
iamily," the alumni. It is this faction that has
been causing difficulty in the present instance.
The Board of Athletic Control is in the pe
culiar spot of being dependent upon the
alumni for tangible financial support â€”a situ
ation that pertains at most other universities
with major intercollegiate competition. And
jt was from a part of this group that the criticism
of Tiny came.
The Board, however, in the light of Tiny's
record, in the light of the football teams he has
turned out in his last six years at Stanford,
voted his reappointment on approximately the
same basis that other members of the Stanford
iaculty hold their positions.
The question mark, literally, has been
straightened out into an exclamation point,
but not a period.
That it may turn back into a question mark
is something which will be determined in the
future by the quality of the teams representing
Stanford, by their success, and by the quality
of the men that make up those teams.
Perhaps there is just one qualification that
might be made on the lead statement to this
editorial and that is that Tiny Thornhill will be
reappointed if President Wilbur approves the
action of the Board, which he undoubtedly will
do; but only after due consideration to any
pressure groups which may protest the action
of the Board last Saturday.
There is certain to be some form of protest
made. That is evident from the prolonged dis
cussion and trial of the situation in off-campus
newspapers as well as on the Stanford campus
before the Board meeting.
This qualification of the above lead, how
ever, does not necessarily hint at inside or
confidential information.
It is merely one aspect of the situation that
is only too evident.
And in spite of it:
Tiny must be given an adequate opportunity
to produce Rose Bowl teams again in the
future.
