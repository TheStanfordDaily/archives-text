# One Plus One Equals One
## 
### 
MEMBERS of the senior class next week
will get their chance to play ball with the
Alumni Association and the Stanford Asso
ciates. Jack Laney's committee is setting up
the machinery and some 60 "drivers" soon
will be running down their charges to see that
they contribute.
But this year's senior is lucky. He's being
hit just once for money, although the two drives
have been carried on separately in past years.
First the Stanford Fund gang would come
around and bang on his door (or vice versa).
Then, after he had paid them off and sent them
on their way, along would come the Alumni
Association crowd, asking a two-dollar check
for Alumni dues (regularly four dollars) and
snarling that it didn't make any difference if
he did just get through paying those Fund
people.
One or the other of these groups always

had to have its drive second. One or the other
always came out the little end of the tuba.
So this year, as a convenience both to the
Alumni and Associates and to the seniors, the
two drives have been consolidated. The same
senior committee will go after both sets of cor. -
tributions. It will collect them both at the same
time. It may even forget occasionally which is
which, except that one is two dollars straight
and the other is as much as each person can
spare.
It may be a little tough on the Associates and
the Alumni, but at least it will give the two
an even start. And it will be a break for the
seniors, now in the middle of what they are
discovering to be their most expensive college
year, to be asked to put it on the line only
once instead of twice as before.â€”R. D.
