# Run Little Chillun

### 
TODAY is Monday.
Everyone is busy dragging skis off the
top of his car, yawning through eight o'clocks,
gulping bromos. But The Daily goes on, in
evitable as the tides.
At 1:15 o'clock the editorial staff will hold
its weekly conclave to rebore the cylinders.
Edit board, as usual, will provide the floor
show and will meet for rehearsal at one.
