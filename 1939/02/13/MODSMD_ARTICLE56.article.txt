FEUD FOR THOUGHT
IT IS always a comforting thing to find evidence that
the lion and the lamb are lying down together in
stead of lying to each other about suppressed minori
ties and communist plots. And such a spectacle is
particularly pleasing in these troubled times when
even the approaching footsteps in a mystery movie
march to the goose-step. I notice with considerable
pleasure, then, that Stanford's Division of Speech
and Drama has called of! its ancient feud with the
students.
No formal armistice has been signed; no official
negotiations mark the end of the undeclared war. But
if we can judge from this year's productions, the old
campaign to impose dramatic culture has been aban
doned.

No one remembers just when or how the feud
started; when this generation came to Stanford, it
was well established, like the Chapel front and the
syllabus fee system.
The Division protested bitterly that it was casting
pearls before swine who not only trampled them but
also griped because it hurt their feet. Dramatics lead
ers adopted the air of a patient nurse apologizing for
a problem child. Stanford students, they said, were
too barbarous to appreciate culture. Therefore the
manifest destiny of the Division was to raise their
depraved taste. Plays should be over the heads of the
students so that in striving for the mountain tops they
might at least climb the foothills.

students retorted that when they wanted cul
ture injected intravenously, they would sign for it
and get grade points. The division, they said, was
trying to make them play patron for its experiments.
This was the situation when the pcace angel got
its cue last fall. Bitter words had followed produc
tions like "Murder in the Cathedral" which even the
Division couldn't understand.

The two major plays this year show a skillful and
satisfying compromise. "Tobias and the Angel" and
"Mask and Face" were cultural enough to let the
Division think that it was carrying the banner of
progress in taste. But they also had enough interest
to keep the student from thinking that he was still
in a classroom.
The Division hasn't given up its cultural impe
rialism, and the students are still suspicious. But the
shooting has stopped. Memorial Hall is again an audi
torium instead of a no-man's land.
