# Lightly . . . And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
There is a somewhat worried young lady at Stan
ford today, and a young man who should be quite
worried.
Because the yountj lady has:
A brother at Stanford, who has three friends.
Who between themselves several years ago formed a
committee to censor all of the young lady's dates.
And, as I said, a boy friend.
It is the boy friend who should be worried. Be
cause the committee got its first look at him at the
Roble Formal Saturday night. They are meeting to
day to see if they approve. And if they don't . . .
They're all football players.

NICE AND QUIET

Art Lcvinson was in the Shack this afternoon,
shoveling out his usual pile of publicity for Chaparral.
When he came in, he said he was the Old Boy.
He said that was a statement he was prepared to
run into the ground.
Then he went on to show what he meant.

There's one of the Horatio Algers in Business
School who prides himself on never missing a point.
When he reads a book, he underlines everything.

I don't think it is that in the last two years I have
not kept my eyes open. I don't think I have been
blind. I think that all this bridge playing on the
campus is new, something that's just sprung up.
And more damn people arc playing bridge these
days, you know. It has surpassed pool and ping
pong and movies with most people as the Kcason-I-
Came-to-Collcge.
Now I don't play the game myself, but I have
watched, And for you who want to be social suc
cesses, I have formulated two cardinal rules for play
ing bridge:
1. It's not like poker. You can't get your cards
and bluff so that you think up until the last minute
that you're going to win, although everyone has known
all along that you won't. In bridge even you know
you haven't a chance. And if you don't know, ask
your partner. And then just sit quietly, obediently
play the suit which is led, and wait for another deal.
2. This is really a better rule. By luck or other
means, get a lot of good cards, go hog-wild on the
bid. and then trump like a fiend. I don't sec how you
cull lose.
