# Two-gun Film Tells Jesse's Wild Career
## Rip-roaring Western 'Over-dramatized, Filled with Hokum' 
### 
"JESSE JAMES," currently play
ing at the Fox Stanford.
Rip-roaring, two-gun western is
Twentieth-Century Fox's contribu
tion to the saga industry these days.

Picking the life
of the James lads,
who sought re
venge against the
Iron Hoss, they
told the tale with
hot. lead, Tyrone
Power, and Henry
Fonda. Over
dramatized, cram
med with hokum
md cinematic
cliche, "Jesse
James" should
nake lots of
money.

But even "Jesse" has its redeem
ing factors. A superbly filmed train
robbery sequence draws a stir of
excitement from even the most cyn
ical audience. Technicolor adds
much, because the boys pull some
of their best acts against beautiful
scenic backgrounds. And "Jesse
James" moves along with a bang
bang that never allows plot to drag.
The end of Jesse's career as he
holds a "Home Sweet Home" sign
in his hand might have been con
vincingly done had it not been anti
climaxed by a stock Hollywood
claptrap conclusion.
The heroes are handsome and
the "heavies" are villainous; char
acters are heavily stereotyped.
On the same bill are a Popeye
Cartoon, a Pete Smith Specialty on
ice-skating, featuring the Loyola
team ,and a Movietone News, de
voted not to news but to winter
sports. â€”Hutchinson
