# Cards to Meet B.C. Debaters
## Anglo-U.S. Alliance Will Be Discussed 
### 
Political viewpoints of an inter
national nature will be aired to
morrow night when student debat
ers from the University of British
Columbia meet two members of the
local forensic team in a decision
match in Memorial Hall Auditorium.
Debating the question, "Resolved:
that an Anglo-American alliance
offers a better hope for world peace
t.han does the principle of collective
security of the League of Nations,"
Brooke von Falkenstein and John
Bates, Stanford's representatives,
will uphold the affirmative side.
Morris Bel kin and Struan Robert
son of the Vancouver university
will support the negative side.
Substitution of a new topic for
the question originally scheduled
for debate has been made, an
nounces Bob Putnam, debate man
ager. Entirely different arguments
may be introduced during the de
bate, because of the British influ
ence to which the visiting students
have been exposed, according to
Putnam.
In the past, representatives of the
Card team have met student debat
ers who have been under the same
general American political influ
ence. As formerly stated, the ques
tion read, "Resolved: that, an Anglo-
American mutual assistance pact in
case of aggression will be in the
best interests of world peace."
The contests between the two
universities have been held an
nually since 1933, and local debat
ers have won every decision match.
Professor Edgar E. Robinson of the
Committee on Public Exercises will
preside as chairman of the match.
