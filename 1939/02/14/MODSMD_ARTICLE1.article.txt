r United States we live in is a
democracy. Its constitution for
bids the granting of titles of no
bility. However, despite our lack of
peerage, the Presidents possess the
power of elevating nine Americans
to positions on a plane higher than
that on which the ordinary citizen
exists.
The Supreme Court of the United
States enjoys prestige which is al
most inconsistent with the funda
mental concepts of a democratic
ration. The black-robed justices
who have final check on the valid
ity of legislation constitute a body
almost comparable to the great
nobles of a European autocracy.

| RESPITE the enviable position
of the justices of the Supreme
Court, during the past two years
three of them have resigned their
posts. Death creatcd a fourth va
cancy on the bench.
After President Roosevelt's much
disputed court bill went down to
defeat, Congress passed a measure
permitting the justices to retire on
full pay after they have reached
the age of 70 and have served at
ieast 10 years. Almost immediately
Justices Van Devanter and Suther
land took the cue and resigned. Last
summer Mr. Justice Cardozo died.
r JPODAY the President is faced
with the opportunity of select
ing his fourth Supreme Court
member. The resignation of Louis
D. Brandeis yesterday deprives the
high bench of one of its outstand

Chief Justice Holmes, was largely
responsible for the Supreme Court's
swing to liberalism.

r J ,| HE Supreme Court has lost one
of the great men of American
law. In choosing his successor,
Roosevelt is sure to keep fresh in
his mind the recent controversy over
the appointment of Associate Justice
Frankfurter and govern his actions
accordingly.
Because the President's first three
choices cyme from the East, Judge
Harold M. Stevens of the U. S. Cir
cuit. Court of Appeals, a native of
Utah, is considered ihe logical man
for the job. But in the black days
that have gone before, Mr. Roose
velt has adequately demonstrated
his ability to select, an illogical can
didate.
| AST night Herbert Hoover
A started tooting his toy trum
pet again. And again he sounded
the notes of a funeral march for
the New Deal. Dangling his two
favorite skeletons before Repub
licans assembled at their annual
Lincoln Day dinner, the ex-Pres
ident warned them that Roose
velt's spending policy will lead to
inflation and that his centraliza
tion of power will lead to dicta
torship.
There was nothing very new or
different about Mr. Hoover's ad
dress; it was the same one he has
been giving, with minor variations,
ever since 1933; it was the same one
that Republican bank presidents
have been echoing day after day.
