When Gus Arnheim raises his
| baton to start the music at Scab
bard and Blade's Military Ball for
the whole campus on Friday night,
Feb. 17, the only "big name" dance
of the quarter will get under way.

Following the custom of other
campus balls of the same type, dance
programs will be used. TTiese pro
grams, which will be of red and
white leather, may be exchanged for
the bids this Wednesday, at the
A.S.S.U. office. Bids arc now on sale
for $3.50.

Signs at the Idaho state line warn
migrants that no funds are available
in that state for relief of non-resi
dents.
