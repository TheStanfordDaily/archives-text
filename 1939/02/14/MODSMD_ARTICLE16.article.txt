# Artificial Bolts Of Lightning To Be Produced
## $3,250 Given by S.F. Firm for Generator To Be Installed Here 
### 
An electrical impulse generator
for producing powerful bolls of ar
tificial lightning will be built this
spring at Stanford, President ,'Kay
Lyman Wilbur announced touay,
which will be a co-operative ven
ture of Stanford research engineers
and the electrical industry.
Man-made lightning produced by
the generator will be potent enough
to drill a hole the full length of a
10-foot plank and split it, as light
ning splits a tree. The machine has
been designed to build up and send
oil 2.000.000 volts of laboratory
lightning in l'i' rnillionths of a sec
ond, a performance which dupli
cates nature's on a somewhat small
er voltage scale. Its intense white
spark will even be followed by a
cannon-like clap of artificial thun
der.
DUPLICATES REAL BOLT
The generator will be used to du
plicate the effects of lighting bolts
striking in the vicinity of high-volt
age power lines. Such equipment is
needed by manufacturers of elec
trical equipment to test the ability
of their oil switches and transform
ers to withstand natural lightning
effects.
To provide facilities for such
equipment tests, the Pacific Electric-
Manufacturing Company, through
its president, Joseph S. Thompson,
has offered $3,000 toward the gen
erator's cost, and the K.P.F. Elec
tric company, headed by A. J. Pahl,
a Stanford engineer, has pledged
$250, President Wilbur announced.
Both are San Francisco firms, and
with their aid the construction
should be completed by fall.
VOLTAGE IN MILLIONS
Although the maximum voltage of
lightning is many millions, most
lightning disturbances affecting
power transmission are hits on tow
ers or ground wires. Ordinarily, en
gineers find, only a secondary in
fluence reaches the transformers,
oil switches, and other equipment
associated with them. Apparatus
manufactured today is usually re
quired to withstand secondary
lightning effects of up to 2,000,000
volts.
Manufacturers using the Stanford
lightning generator will expect any
equipment, which withstands its
artificial bolts to be safe from any
ordinary lightning disturbances.

Both are San Francisco firms, and
with their aid the construction
should be completed by fall.
VOLTAGE IN MILLIONS
Although the maximum voltage of
lightning is many millions, most
lightning disturbances affecting
power transmission are hits on tow
ers or ground wires. Ordinarily, en
gineers find, only a secondary in
fluence reaches the transformers,
oil switches, and other equipment
associated with them. Apparatus
manufactured today is usually re
quired to withstand secondary
lightning effects of up to 2,000,000
volts.
Manufacturers using the Stanford
lightning generator will expect any
equipment, which withstands its
artificial bolts to be safe from any
ordinary lightning disturbances.
An electrical impulse generator
for producing powerful bolls of ar
tificial lightning will be built this
spring at Stanford, President ,'Kay
Lyman Wilbur announced touay,
which will be a co-operative ven
ture of Stanford research engineers
and the electrical industry.
Man-made lightning produced by
the generator will be potent enough
to drill a hole the full length of a
10-foot plank and split it, as light
ning splits a tree. The machine has
been designed to build up and send
oil 2.000.000 volts of laboratory
lightning in l'i' rnillionths of a sec
ond, a performance which dupli
cates nature's on a somewhat small
er voltage scale. Its intense white
spark will even be followed by a
cannon-like clap of artificial thun
der.
DUPLICATES REAL BOLT
The generator will be used to du
plicate the effects of lighting bolts
striking in the vicinity of high-volt
age power lines. Such equipment is
needed by manufacturers of elec
trical equipment to test the ability
of their oil switches and transform
ers to withstand natural lightning
effects.
To provide facilities for such
equipment tests, the Pacific Electric-
Manufacturing Company, through
its president, Joseph S. Thompson,
has offered $3,000 toward the gen
erator's cost, and the K.P.F. Elec
tric company, headed by A. J. Pahl,
a Stanford engineer, has pledged
$250, President Wilbur announced.
