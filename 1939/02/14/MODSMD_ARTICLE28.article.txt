"Good old Tiny!"
ONCE a gain the city sports scribes
are on the Thornhill band-wagon,
now that it appears quite certain
that the Board of Athletic Control
wants him to stick around for at
least another year.
It is probably human nature to
kick a guy in the teeth when he's
lying flat on his back, but the demon
Bay experts completely overdid
themselves on this latest episode,
about which they knew less even
than you or I.
They started on Tiny long before
the season was over and only tem
pered their comment when Board
issued its curt announcement Satur
day night that the two coaches in
question had both been rehired. If
you read many papers Sunday and
Monday, you must have run across
the sweet orchids which the repent
ing gentry were cutting for "good
old Tiny."
* * *
UNFORTUNATELY some of us
remember the brick-bats these
same vultures were plunking on
the Thornhill noggin a few days
back. Why, Thornhill was lazy and
incompetent. If the B.A.C. didn't
rid themselves of this frankenstein
in lootball garb, they might just as
well lock up the old practice field
and put an ice-skating rink down
on the stadium green.
Tiny felt so bad about the whole
thing that he was thinking about
going in with Dink Templeton on
the ten-pay purchase of a time
clock. Together they figured they
could put in enough hours to please
the men who keep fat from eating
13.A.C. box lunches between the
halves of football games.

A GOOD sports writer. I take it,
never admits a mistake. If he can't
hedge his way out of little blunders,
such as accusing Tiny and Temple
ton of laziness, he can always change
his story so that his editors and the
principals involved won't toss him
out on his well known ear.

ADD to your list of forgotten men,
the roster of the Stanford baseball
team.
Somehow or other, the best young
team to represent the Farm in four
years has been getting the royal
hot-foot in regards to publicity, and
the athlete or coach who doesn't lap
up timely recognition would walk
out on a date with Dorothy Lamour.
But the team has definitely stamped
it sell as the outfit to beat in the
conference diamond league. Those
fellows can play ball even if they
can't yet grow massive Tarzan chest
wigs to sport on the beaches.
Calling them kids should be no
insult to their dignity. Seriously
speaking, they do look like a gram
mar school C league alongside the
old timers playing lor the other con
ference schools. It is no secret that
baseball gets fewer scholarships at
Stanford than does any other major
sport. That means that the average

Farm player is going to be just an
other student who happened to
i learn the rules in high school. When
| you consider that schools all up and
; down the coast are utilized by big
, league scouts as an ideal training
j ground for their hirelings, you can
! realize why Stanford looks youth
| ful.

| BUT the "youth movement" clean
-1 ed up on Santa Clara last Saturday
| without an ounce of exertion. And
the youngest of them all, a tot nam
ed Herbert Bull, "Ferdinand" to his
! hecklers, smashed out three hits and
| made only one error out of six
chances in his first conference
I game at a new position.
Only one man failed to hit and he
played flawless ball afield in a spot
1 where he hadn't even had infield
practice since school opened last
fall. Evidently the young worms
have turned for once and all; and if
our innocent remarks about the Boy
Scout, age has made them mad
enough to win and keep on win
; ning themselves into a conference
! championship, may they blow up
; with rage every time they play.
