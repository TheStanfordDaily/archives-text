Stanford varsity swimmers will be

Pool. Thursday afternoon at 3

WON THREE YEARS AGO
The last trip they made into Cali- ;
j fomia three years ago netted them
| decisive wins over California, Stan- !
j ford, and San Jose State. So this
, year when the Indians go into the I
j water after those Duck feathers, j
| they will really be swimming with
j a vengeance in their strokes.
Advance information on the qual- I
ity of the Oregon team shows that
their main hopes are based on the
sensational performances of three ;
Southern California swimmers, Jack
Dallas, breast stroker, and Sherman
Wentmore, backstroker, who hail
from Long Beach and swam on the J
same team as Paul Herron, Stanford j
frosh swimmer.
J. C. TRANSFER
The third is Leo Gaffney, a sopho- j
more transfer from Fullerton Jay
see whom the Oregonians think can
knock Roy Winkelmann, Card j
diver, from his Pacific Coast Con
ference title. |
Following are the final tabulations
of the varsity and frosh meets of
last Friday with San Jose State.

The last trip they made into Cali- ;

Advance information on the qual- I

their main hopes are based on the
sensational performances of three ;
Southern California swimmers, Jack
Dallas, breast stroker, and Sherman
Wentmore, backstroker, who hail
from Long Beach and swam on the J
same team as Paul Herron, Stanford j
frosh swimmer.
J. C. TRANSFER
The third is Leo Gaffney, a sopho- j
more transfer from Fullerton Jay
see whom the Oregonians think can
knock Roy Winkelmann, Card j
diver, from his Pacific Coast Con
ference title. |
Following are the final tabulations
of the varsity and frosh meets of
last Friday with San Jose State.
