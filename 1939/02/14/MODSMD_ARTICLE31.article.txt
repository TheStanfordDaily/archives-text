# Baseballers Shut Out Gaddini's All-Stars, 3-0, As Thompson Whiffs 13
## Airtight Defense of Indian Infield, Outfield Saves Sophomore Hurler In Clutches; Kennealy Seals Next 
### 
Quentin "Cootie" Thompson, sophomore fireball artist, struck out l.'J
men and allowed only one hit as the Stanford baseball varsity shut out the
(jadtlini All-Star nine yesterday. ;j to 0.
Thompson, in his first complete game of the season, was in rare form
all afternoon and never once was in serious trouble. The Indian "youth
Congress" infield was again air-tight on defence. Ca»:lain Norm Juney in

d'lg'ht field and Bob Ditlevsen in lelt
came up with two sensational
catches to keep Thompson's shut-out
lor him.
With the exception of a misstep by
Glenn South on first and another
error by Thompson himself, the Farm
crew played spotless ball throughout.
The Herb Bull-Dick Shortull com
bination at short and third was par
ticularly effective on defense.
While Thompson was keeping the
Oakland club's one hit well scattered,
his mates managed to smash out six
including a triple against the semi
pros.
Coach Hairy Wolter announced
last night that the Farm squad would
meet the Kennealy Seals in another
practice session tomorrow afternoon
on the sunken diamond.
The box score:
Inning 1 2 15(>7 S i) K II
