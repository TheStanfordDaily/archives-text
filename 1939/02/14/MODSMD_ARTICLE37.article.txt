# The 						Unseeing Eye
## 
### 
WHEN a man is broke and out of work, he
spends his time pounding the pavement.
He is careful to avoid stepping in puddles and
to keep out of draughts because he knows that
losing his health would mean disaster.
Since 1930 Stanford has been pounding the
pavement with the rest of the down-and-outers.
Preoccupied with her search for funds and the
fear of an unbalanced budget, Alma Mater has
not been overly conscientious about protecting
the physical eguipment of her children. Spe
cifically, she has been neglecting their eyes.
More students read in the Library than in
any other building on the campus. Yet the light
ing in the Library is inadeguate. This statement
is based on the words of authorities in the
Comptroller's office, the building maintenance
department, the illumination laboratory, and the
Library itself.
In the opinions of experts, the reference room
should be supplied with a minimum of 25 foot
candles of light. The latest tests show no more
than 7 ! /a foot-candles. When the present illu
mination eguipment was installed in 1918, it
was among the most modern and efficient in
the country.
During the past 20 years deterioration and
revolutionary advances in electrical engineering
have turned the trick. Medical examinations
show that the students' eyes have suffered con
seguently. Of course, this can be credited to
inadeguate illumination in a great many campus
buildings besides the Library, but it is there that
the greatest number of eyes are put to the most
exacting use.
Logically, the thing to do is to immediately
improve the lighting in the Libe. But the situ
ation cannot be remedied as easily as that.
The wiring system is now carrying the maxi
mum amount of current it can bear. Changing
the illumination would mean completely tear
ing out the present system and installing a new
one. Estimates for the project loom fearfully
large.
With the budget for building maintenance cut
io an absolute minimum, University officials
realize the need for improved lighting, but are
faced with the usual problem of the empty
pocket book.
Still, students' eyes are suffering. The Uni
versity bears a moral responsibility for the
physical eguipment it provides. Talking about
the pricelessness of good eyesight will not help
matters any more than announcing that Stan
ford lacks the necessary funds to make the
change.
The Administration finds itself faced with an
unpleasant guestion. Is it more important for
Stanford to keep out of the red, or to provide
adeguate lighting in a building where a large
percentage of the student body studies?
The answers to some guestions lie outside of
the limitations of dollars and cents. This is one
of them.â€”L. L.
