STANFORD'S political life is not at stake; how
ever, the Farm's so-far lethargic attitude
toward today's elections may very well let
alarmists draw a contrary conclusion.
This latter is just as true as the simple paral
lel that can be drawn between the attitude of
Stanford toward its elections and the attitude
of the general public outside the Farm's unseen
wall toward its elections. What's going to hap
pen, it might be asked, if the potential elec
torate, represented at institutions such as Stan
ford, persists in ignoring a function that is
clearly the basis of a republican (or Democratic)
form of government?
The answer is too easy: minority groups, out
for all they can get, will continue to dominate
politics.
But in this case, there isn't even enough in
terest for the local minority groups to get their
hands out of their pockets a >d start patting the
heads of imaginary children.
Realization of the situation will not, however,
koep Stanford from pulling the same stunt it

pulled at the candidates' assembly the other
night—ll people there, 3 of them reporters.
Which evidences a negative attitude, hardly
in keeping with the best theories of Political
Scientists.
And if Stanford can't take a tip from what it
learns in the Poli Sci department, what's it going
to do when it's up against something that really
counts?
