newshawks. They may be sadly disappointed
when they see the Shack, but it's home to us
and home to them from now on out.
Tryoutee meeting, scheduled for 4:30 o'clock,

permit it. Staff-hopefuls will get their first taste
of being at the beck and call of a beautiful
Women's Editor.
They will continue to do so for the next three
weeks until appointment time; continue to do so
for the rest of their time at Stanford.
Yes, all Women's Editors are beautiful.
