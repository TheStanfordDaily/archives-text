« An international debate between
J student representatives of Canada
and the United States will be held
tonight when University of British
Columbia debaters clash with mem
bers of the Stanford forensic team in
a decision match in Memorial Hall
auditorium at 7:30 o'clock.
Debating on the question, "Re
solved: that an Anglo-American al
liance offers a better hope for world
peace than does the principle of col
lective security of the League of
Nations," Brooke von Falkenstein
and John Bates, Stanford's repre
sentatives, will uphold the affirma
tive view, while Morris Belkin and
Struan Robertson, visiting debaters,
will support the negative view.
The debate, one in a series of con
tests held annually between the
two universities, is a presentation of
the Tuesday Evening Series, and is
under the auspices of the Committee
on Public Exercises, in charge of
the series.
WIN DECISION MATCHES
Based on the results of previous
meetings, the local debaters arc fa
vored to annex the match, as Stan
fords' representatives have won
every decision debate since students
of the two schools first participated
