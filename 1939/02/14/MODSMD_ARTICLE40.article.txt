# BULL SESSION
## WE WON'T PLAY 
### JOHN COBBS 
A CCORDING to the calendar, the A.S.S.U. winter
quarter elections are scheduled for this morning.
There has never been any attempt to conceal this fact,
but even so, in mentioning it I feel almost as though
I had given away a secret. Stanford, I realize, will
know nothing of the election until it passes the polls
on its way to classes.
Like all winter elections, the one this year has
been swaddled in disinterest, so that only election
board, the 40-odd candidates, and possibly their room
mates know what it looks like. At the assembly last
week when the nominees were supposed to present
themselves to the electorate, the audience numbered
11, three of them Daily reporters. The assembly would
have been much more impressive if the electorate had
been permitted ot address the candidates.
* * * *
Possibly there is seme profound sociological sig
nificance in the way we cut winter elections dead.
Perhaps it indicates a decline of the old pioneer
spirit that strengthened our ancestors when they were
putting a muzzle on the howling wilderness. Off
hand, though, I'd say that it proves nothing except
that in winter quarter we are in no mood for paying
games.
Stanford's elective system is not foolproof, be
cause the ratio of human genius to human stupidity
is such that we have never been smart enough to
work out something we aren't dumb enough to break.
But our system is practically harmless.
* sj« * *
YV/E KNOW that regardless of what candidates wrig
gle through the preferential balloting screen, stu
dent government will rock along about as it always
has. There is no patronage to distribute, no policy to
change, no suppressed minority to elevate. Each of
fice holder is under a sort of boy scout pledge to do
his best, and as far as we can tell, they are all honest.
The only real problem Ls to pick the most qualified
men, and if we don't know any of them, prayer and
meditation won't help us choose. We have to trust the
aptitude test and the grade system to set an accept
able minimum intelligence. The perennial contro
versy over whether or not our trust is justified need
not be dragged in here.
* * * i|:
In the spring it pleases us to make a jolly little
game out of elections. We enjoy playing pocket edi
tion Farleys, and we get an unchristian satisfaction out
of running one past those filthy Alpha Alphas who
cut our throats in rushing. And so spring elections are
played out. dramatically, with an incidental music
background of conspiratorial whispers.
But winter quarter is a sad time at best. The game
isn't worth the energy it takes; only a few jobs are
open and they are unimpressive. Besides that most
of us find the strain of elections more than we care to
bother with twice a year. In my own case, there are a
couple of our ally fraternities to which I couldn't
possibly be nice more than once a season.
And after all, there's no reason why we should
bother too much about it. The game isn't for keeps.

game out of elections. We enjoy playing pocket edi
tion Farleys, and we get an unchristian satisfaction out
of running one past those filthy Alpha Alphas who
cut our throats in rushing. And so spring elections are
played out. dramatically, with an incidental music
background of conspiratorial whispers.
But winter quarter is a sad time at best. The game
isn't worth the energy it takes; only a few jobs are
open and they are unimpressive. Besides that most
of us find the strain of elections more than we care to
bother with twice a year. In my own case, there are a
couple of our ally fraternities to which I couldn't
possibly be nice more than once a season.
And after all, there's no reason why we should
bother too much about it. The game isn't for keeps.
A CCORDING to the calendar, the A.S.S.U. winter
quarter elections are scheduled for this morning.
There has never been any attempt to conceal this fact,
but even so, in mentioning it I feel almost as though
I had given away a secret. Stanford, I realize, will
know nothing of the election until it passes the polls
on its way to classes.
Like all winter elections, the one this year has
been swaddled in disinterest, so that only election
board, the 40-odd candidates, and possibly their room
mates know what it looks like. At the assembly last
week when the nominees were supposed to present
themselves to the electorate, the audience numbered
11, three of them Daily reporters. The assembly would
have been much more impressive if the electorate had
been permitted ot address the candidates.

Possibly there is seme profound sociological sig
nificance in the way we cut winter elections dead.
Perhaps it indicates a decline of the old pioneer
spirit that strengthened our ancestors when they were
putting a muzzle on the howling wilderness. Off
hand, though, I'd say that it proves nothing except
that in winter quarter we are in no mood for paying
games.
Stanford's elective system is not foolproof, be
cause the ratio of human genius to human stupidity
is such that we have never been smart enough to
work out something we aren't dumb enough to break.
But our system is practically harmless.

YV/E KNOW that regardless of what candidates wrig
gle through the preferential balloting screen, stu
dent government will rock along about as it always
has. There is no patronage to distribute, no policy to
change, no suppressed minority to elevate. Each of
fice holder is under a sort of boy scout pledge to do
his best, and as far as we can tell, they are all honest.
The only real problem Ls to pick the most qualified
men, and if we don't know any of them, prayer and
meditation won't help us choose. We have to trust the
aptitude test and the grade system to set an accept
able minimum intelligence. The perennial contro
versy over whether or not our trust is justified need
not be dragged in here.
