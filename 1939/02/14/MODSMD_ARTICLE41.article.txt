It is dear in another sense.
But maybe I'm just looking for something for

her candy. Hmm. It will make her fat."
Today he is sending flowers.

the other day:

t.hey itch.
Here at the Shark yesterday a k'H was writing
a revue of the llallet Russe.
"Clce." I heard her say, "I wish I knew more
words.
