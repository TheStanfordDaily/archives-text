# Wilbur Speaks On Control Of Syphilis
## Morality Stressed As Strong Means Of Disease Control 
### 
Asserting that morality is a far
stronger means of controlling the
spread of syphilis and gonorrhea
than is chemistry alone, President j
Ray Lyman Wilbur spoke to the |
Committee of Fifteen in Chicago j
yesterday on "Social Hygiene, the !
Task of All the People."
"Our greatest strength is in the
strength of being clean," Dr. Wilbur j
said, calling for a concerted, na- |
tionwide drive against venereal j
disease. "After all of our years of
experience we come back to the
one thing that has been known so
long â€” that personal chastity is the
most effective way to avoid con
tamination with these diseases."
SOURCE OF DISEASE
Fifty per cent of all venereal j
disease is acquired through either i
public prostitution or clandestine j
prostitution, he pointed out.
Outlining his suggestions for a |
solution to the problem, he said, j
"We know the public costs of syph- I
ilis and gonnorhea; we have ade- !
quate remedies for their treatment, j
The problem is simply one of how to j
start the proper campaign and j
carry it over the years.
SUPPORT ASKED
"We must support all official
health programs; we must have a j
program of study starting in tho*
home, going through the sch'lj I
system, and extending to all pha-'f I
of life. 111 i
"The parent must take the "C" ,f
sponsibility in each communit; to |f
develop sound recreational jro- fl<
grams, sound habits of industry as- ,
sist the educator and health ;
he concluded.
