# Brandeis Withdraws From Court
## Aged Justice Retires In Twenty-third Year Of Judicial Service 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 13 (UP).â€”
Associate Supreme Court Justice
Louis Dembitz Brandeis, distin
guished 82 - year - old dean of the
bench and noted Jewish liberal, re
tired from active duty today, ending
nearly 23 years of service.
He tendered his notice of retire
ment to President Roosevelt, effec
tive immediately, in a two-line letter
which read:
"Dear Mr. President:
"Pursuant to the Act of March 1,
1937, I retire this day from regular
active service on the bench.
"Cordially, Louis D. Brandeis."
REASONS NOT GIVEN
He gave no reasons for his action,
although it was recalled he has been
in ill health and returned to the
bench last week for the first time in
a month.
He also has been deeply interested
the the world Palestine resettlement
movement and was said to be desir
ous of devoting all his energies to
that problem, which has taken on
newer and more grave aspects due
to Jewish persecution abroad.
The first Jew to occupy a seat on
the high tribunal, Brandeis' resig
nation takes away from the court its
outstanding liberal member and en
ables Mr. Roosevelt to make his
fourth appointment to the bench in
less than two years.
POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS
Speculation over his possible suc
cessor centered immediately around
Judge Harold M. Stephens of the
U.S. Circuit CT>urt of Appeals for
the District of Columbia. Stephens
is a native of Utah, and there has
been considerable agitation for the
appointment of a Westerner because
of the preponderant Eastern repre
sentation on the bench. Also men
tioned was Senator Lewis D. Schwel
lenbach, D., Wash., an ardent New
Dealer.
