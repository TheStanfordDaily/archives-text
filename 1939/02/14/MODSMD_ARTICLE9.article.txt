### JACK BURTT DICK DUDMAN 
Bonnie Redmond watched him
with wide-eyed wonder as he held
i a cast-off sweater up to her and
said, "There, I guess that one will
| do."
Thin and frail, Bonnie looked as if
she could use a sweater. It was cold
j in San Jose that afternoon, and even
| though the two-room cottage was
| heated to the point of stuffiness,
frayed curtains tacked over the win
dows gave a glimpse of gray, rainy
j sky.
' So Bonnie was wondering and
I grateful as Charles Shrcve Federal
j Department of Agriculture's grant
supervisor for five counties sur
| rounding San Jose, helped her try
' on the sweater.
DISTRIBUTES CLOTHES
It was also a very special day for
Mr. Shrcve, incidentally a Stanford
j graduate. Ordinarily he spends his
! time dividing limited federal grants
! between rents and bare necessities
j of food for the migratory agricul
tural workers in his district. But
I today he was distributing a portion
I of the 745 articles of clothing do
; nated by Stanford to the A.S.U.
| migratory workers' drive early this
month.
As he stepped across the rutted,
| muddy alleys between the cottages
I and stopped at the doors it was easy
to sec what he was thinking.
Many of the 490 families in his
care have been spending the winter
nights sleeping under thin sheets of
canvas. Inadequately clothed, they
have spent, the days tramping rain
soaked streets looking for odd jobs
to carry them through the off-sea
son when there are no crops to be
harvested.
"The Stanford clothing gift was
j a Godsend to these people," said Mr.
I Shreve.
PREACHER HELPED
He told about Brother Neil, a
former circuit-riding Baptist p reach
. er in Oklahoma, who was driven by
midwestcm dust storms to find work
| in California. Penniless, living in
