Bonnie Redmond watched him
with wide-eyed wonder as he held
i a cast-off sweater up to her and
said, "There, I guess that one will
| do."
Thin and frail, Bonnie looked as if
she could use a sweater. It was cold
j in San Jose that afternoon, and even
| though the two-room cottage was
| heated to the point of stuffiness,
frayed curtains tacked over the win
dows gave a glimpse of gray, rainy
j sky.
' So Bonnie was wondering and
I grateful as Charles Shrcve Federal
j Department of Agriculture's grant
supervisor for five counties sur
| rounding San Jose, helped her try
' on the sweater.
DISTRIBUTES CLOTHES
It was also a very special day for
Mr. Shrcve, incidentally a Stanford
j graduate. Ordinarily he spends his
! time dividing limited federal grants
! between rents and bare necessities
j of food for the migratory agricul
tural workers in his district. But
I today he was distributing a portion
I of the 745 articles of clothing do
; nated by Stanford to the A.S.U.
| migratory workers' drive early this
month.
As he stepped across the rutted,
| muddy alleys between the cottages
I and stopped at the doors it was easy
to sec what he was thinking.
Many of the 490 families in his
care have been spending the winter
nights sleeping under thin sheets of
canvas. Inadequately clothed, they
have spent, the days tramping rain
soaked streets looking for odd jobs
to carry them through the off-sea
son when there are no crops to be
harvested.
"The Stanford clothing gift was
j a Godsend to these people," said Mr.
I Shreve.
PREACHER HELPED
He told about Brother Neil, a
former circuit-riding Baptist p reach
. er in Oklahoma, who was driven by
midwestcm dust storms to find work
| in California. Penniless, living in


MIGRATORY WORKERS, living in the poverty of their two-room cottages at a Tian ,-ose camp, were recipients of 717 articles of clothing col

j the San Jose camp, he had no
I clothes suitable for church. The
| brightest spot in a year or more of
j poverty was the moment Mr.
j Shreve presented him a suit for
j Sunday meetin's.
j And then there was the worker,
sick of seasonal jobs, who studied to
be a barber in his spare hours and
had only overalls to wear to the li
cense examinations in San Fran
cisco. A suit, shirt, shoes and tie
given to this man made it possible
[ for him to qualify for a steady job.
Recently, when Mrs. Redmond's
j husband was run over and killed by
j a truck, the family filed a damage
I suit against the tricking company.
| For a while it looked as if her
daughter, Mrs. Juanita Young,
| would not be able to appear in
I court, as she had nothing but over
' alls to wear.
Again Mr. Shreve stepped in. He
Outfitted her with a presentable
j suit, shoes, stockings, a coat, hat.
j and handbag.
CLOTHING IS PROBLEM
"The lack of clothes often has
kept the workers' children out of
! school," Mr. Shreve said. "These
| people seem anxious to have their
| children educated."
Insufficient clothing and a scarc-
I ity of blankets have contributed to
i a high incidence of influenza and
j pneumonia among the migratory
| workers. Colds frequently develop
into more serious diseases, often dis
abling and sometimes fatal, because
the sick cannot be kept warm.
Government aid to these people
consists of payment of their $10
monthly rent and periodic supplies
of food. Every 15 days, Mr. Shreve
distributes their rations of corn
meal, flour, canned milk, canned to
matoes, white beans, sugar, lard,
coffee, and baking powder.
"Yes, they should have meat and
fresh vegetables," he commented,
"but it is a balanced diet and in
cludes the bare essentials,"
NO EASY RELIEF
The state discdurages the federal
government from handing out easy
relief to the migratory workers for
fear they will remain in California
long enough to qualify for state re
lief, Mr. Shreve pointed out. A big
relief program might draw others
into the state, he said.
"The great influx of dust-bowl
refugees into the state has stopped,
as a matter of fact," he said. "Word
of conditions out here has gone back
to the midwest with the few fami
lies who have been able to return,
and has ended the mass migration
to the state."
Because the California fruit in
dustry depends upon a mobile la
bor supply, the migratory worker
problem cannot be solved easily, he

explained. The labor must be at
hand when crops ripen, and the im
portant phase of the problem is to
take care of the workers during the
off-season, since few of them are
able to save enough to care for
themselves.
'The farmers take care of their
draft horses during the winter, but
human beings must shift for them
selves. 'They live that we may eat'
is an accurate description of the
migratory worker," he concluded.
