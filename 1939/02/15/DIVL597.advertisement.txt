It is quite true that you were not re
sponsible for having been brought into
the world—
It also may follow that your parents there

But your parents are certainly not obli
gated to give you a college education,
and if they do so you should be grateful.
Why not once in a while, perhaps
quite casually, express your apprecia-.
tion? That would help a lot.
