### LARRY LIVINCSTON 
I ATE yesterday afternoon thou
sands of devout Catholics knelt
on the eobblestoned square outside
of St. Peters in Rome to do final
reverence to Pius XI. Within the
great basilica funeral services were
held, and the body of the Pope of
Peace was entombed.
Late yesterday afternoon thou
sands of German Nazis gathered at
the harbor of Hamburg to witness
the launching of the new battleship,
Bismark, and to hear their dictator
attack the Catholic Church.
As Hitler accused the late Pope
of being an enemy of the German
people, .there .appeared .011 .the.
streets copies of (he official organ
of his Elite Guard, warning the
leaders of the Church that the
Na/i attitude toward international
Catholicism will remain un
changed.
* * *
I JTTLER'S mouthpiece attacked the
late Pontiff as an enemy of the
Reich and listed five charges to sup
port its accusation. Because Pius
XI hesitated before he withdrew his
nuncio from Loyalist Spain, be
cause ho deplored the Nazi's attacks
on the Church, because he tried to
prevent Hitler's seizure of Catholic
Austria, because he sympathized
with pre-Munich Czechoslovakia,
because he stormed against Italy's
new anti-Semitic laws, he is brand
ed as an enemy of Germany.
In this instance, an enemy of Ger
many is a friend of peace.

\\ ITIIIN the Reich there still
remain 600,000 unwanted Jews
who are today preparing to pay
the second installment of the $400,-
000.000 collective fine levied on
(hem for the murder of a Nazi
diplomat in Paris three months
ago.
Yesterday the inter-governmental
committee, established by President,
Roosevelt, announced definite action
it will take to remove the Jews
from Germany. A private interna
tional corporation, sponsored large
ly by Jewish capital, will launch a
five-year program to ship Ger
many's non-Aryans to undeveloped
colonial regions in Africa and South
America.
J ENDING plausibility to the
project, is a plan to establish
about 200,000 members of the un
wanted race and then to have them
send for their families to join them.
So in Germany in the middle of the
twentieth century, we see repainted
the picture of Spain at the close of
the fifteenth.
The Jews were expelled by
Ferdinand and Isabella, and al
most immediately Spain's mighty
commercial empire collapsed.
Wishful thinking has no place in
history.
the President's na
tional defense bill finally made
its appearance in the House of Rep
resentatives. Objections to the meas
ure were few, and the legislature,
supremely conscious of the immi
nence of war, is sure to pass it with
in the fortnight. The note of dis
cord in Washington's otherwise
harmonious song came yesterday
from the Senate.
Hiram Johnson, for years senator
from California and leader of an
isolationist bloc that defeated the
entrance of the Uniled States into
the League of Nations and the
World Court, attacked Ihe clandes
tine manner in which President
Roosevelt is handling the nation's
foreign policy.

The gentleman from California

U. S. foreign policy when he wants
