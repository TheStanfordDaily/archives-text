# THE
						SITUATION IS THIS:
## (Editorial) 
### 
OUT of the circumstances attendant upon the
reappointment of Tiny Thornhill comes
an indication of conditions which need expres
sion in this newspaper to present them to the
proper administrative offices for correction.
The material in the following cannot be con
sidered confidential; it is not meant to be sensa
tional. Yet, the A.S.S.U. President, H. B. Lee; ;
the three student members of the Board of Ath- j
letic Control, Andy Stojkovich (for By West), j
Slan Hiserman, and Bill Paulman; and The Daily j
feel that it should be revealed at this time to
secure definite action.
From their reports of that meeting, it easily
can be determined that a small percentage of
Stanford's alumni has been placed in the posi
tion of directing the athletic policy of the
University.
The terms under which Tiny has been rec
ommended for reappointment are indefinite. His
term is not limited; he may be kept as long as ,
the Board desires, he may be fired as soon as !
the Board desires.
Practically, the reappointment resolves itself |
to a duration of one year, according to those j
present —until Tiny proves whether or not he
is going to have a championship team next year. 1
As everyone realizes, there has been little |

else but controversial publicity in the columns
of certain sports writers regarding the reappoint
ment of Tiny. That publicity has been detri
mental to the University; it has been based on
personalities and upon weak conjecture.
Prior to the meeting of the Board of Athletic
Control last Saturday night, it was fairly obvious
that both the students and the faculty at Stanford
were for Tiny Thornhill to the extent of offering
him a three-year contract—from all indications,
they still are.
Yet, at the same time, it also is just as obvious
that prior to the Board's meeting, certain parts
of the alumni were bitterly opposed io his re
appointment under any circumstances.
Without revealing information that cannot be
verified by the Board members themselves, the
action of the B.A.C. was clearly a compromise
between the two extremes. And that compro
mise was clearly dictated by the alumni.
The arguments for the compromise at first
seem peculiarly strong.
One of them is that publicity attendant upon
Thornhill's reappointment v/ill be stopped —
there will be no more conjecture, no more
imaginings, no more criticism. His supporters
will feel they have won a concession; his critics
