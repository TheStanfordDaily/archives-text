# THE 						SITUATION IS THIS:
## (Editorial) 
### 
OUT of the circumstances attendant upon the
reappointment of Tiny Thornhill comes
an indication of conditions which need expres
sion in this newspaper to present them to the
proper administrative offices for correction.
The material in the following cannot be con
sidered confidential; it is not meant to be sensa
tional. Yet, the A.S.S.U. President, H. B. Lee; ;
the three student members of the Board of Ath- j
letic Control, Andy Stojkovich (for By West), j
Slan Hiserman, and Bill Paulman; and The Daily j
feel that it should be revealed at this time to
secure definite action.
From their reports of that meeting, it easily
can be determined that a small percentage of
Stanford's alumni has been placed in the posi
tion of directing the athletic policy of the
University.
The terms under which Tiny has been rec
ommended for reappointment are indefinite. His
term is not limited; he may be kept as long as ,
the Board desires, he may be fired as soon as !
the Board desires.
Practically, the reappointment resolves itself |
to a duration of one year, according to those j
present —until Tiny proves whether or not he
is going to have a championship team next year. 1
As everyone realizes, there has been little |

else but controversial publicity in the columns
of certain sports writers regarding the reappoint
ment of Tiny. That publicity has been detri
mental to the University; it has been based on
personalities and upon weak conjecture.
Prior to the meeting of the Board of Athletic
Control last Saturday night, it was fairly obvious
that both the students and the faculty at Stanford
were for Tiny Thornhill to the extent of offering
him a three-year contract—from all indications,
they still are.
Yet, at the same time, it also is just as obvious
that prior to the Board's meeting, certain parts
of the alumni were bitterly opposed io his re
appointment under any circumstances.
Without revealing information that cannot be
verified by the Board members themselves, the
action of the B.A.C. was clearly a compromise
between the two extremes. And that compro
mise was clearly dictated by the alumni.
The arguments for the compromise at first
seem peculiarly strong.
One of them is that publicity attendant upon
Thornhill's reappointment v/ill be stopped —
there will be no more conjecture, no more
imaginings, no more criticism. His supporters
will feel they have won a concession; his critics
will be able to get to him next year when the
matter of athletics in 1940-1941 comes up for
discussion.
Yet, the very fact of compromise only post
pones a renewal of this year's conjecture, only
points to an obvious news angle to any quali
fied newspaperman in reporting next year's
games—"Tiny Thornhill won a point in court
today, when his Indians beat Podunk."
It puts this part of the alumni in the strategic
position of being able to jump on the Thornhill
boat if he turns out a fine team next year; it puts
them in the better position of being able to yip
"I told you so" if he doesn't go to the Rose
Bowl.
All of which makes for a lengthy continua
tion of the trial of Tiny Thornhill in the news
papers when final judgment should have been
rendered last Saturday.
Another of the arguments in support of the
compromise recommendation of the Board to
President Wilbur is that if Thornhill is reap
pointed for a definite term during which he can
not be touched, the "active" alumni—that group
referred to above—will cease to support Stan
ford and Stanford athletics.
By "active" alumni, according to student
members of the Board, is meant those who fur
nish money to give Stanford athletic scholar
ships.
It is not claimed that all of those "active"
alumni will withdraw their support—only part
of them. Just how great a part, is indetermin
able. But the fact remains, they have exerted
enough pressure to dictate the policy of the
Board.
Not all the alumni—only part of them.
And the objection of that part seems to be
for no other reason than the personalities in
volved. At least, there is no other obvious rea
son; the alumni have cited no others.
The whole situation resolves itself into a defi
nition of "active" alumni.
Aren't those alumni "active" who support the
Stanford Fund or who merely spread the repu
tation of Stanford as an educational institution?
Must the definition of "active" include only
those who are against Tiny Thornhill? It would
seem that those who are for him, as well as
those who have not made any expression of
opinion at all, have not been consulted in the
present instance.
It is hard to believe that even if they have
been consulted, they will withdraw so-called
"active" support of the University, merely be
cause they are over-ruled in a legislative body.
There are nine voting members on the 8.A.C.;
the vote last Saturday was four to three in favor
of the recommendation.
The three voting student members, by their
own statement, voted against the recommenda
tion in the hope of obtaining a three-year con
tract.
In other words, it was not even a simple
majority of the Board that approved the recom
mendation.
Ordinarily, the facts on which this editorial is
based would be kept confidential. Under the
circumstances, it has been deemed advisable
by the student representatives to present them
and their implications so that Stanford may
realize the situation with which it is confronted.
Any publicity incidental to this presentation
must, at least, be based upon the facts outlined;
at least, it will be better than the vague ideas
which have resulted from secrecy in the past
and which will continue to result if Tiny must
continue under the terms of his new reappoint
ment.
If this publicity is bad, it can hardly be as bad
as a repetition of the events prior to the Board
meeting—this time spread over a whole football
season.
By this exposure, by this presentation, it is
hoped that the President will act so as to pro
tect Tiny from further trial without jury until
he has had a time sufficient to prove his case.
It is hoped also that he will act to correct the

more vicious situation of a small group of
alumni, which is not content with the satisfaction
of helping students through school, but which
feels it holds the right to dictate the policy of
the University because of financial support.

can be determined that a small percentage of
Stanford's alumni has been placed in the posi
tion of directing the athletic policy of the
University.
The terms under which Tiny has been rec
ommended for reappointment are indefinite. His
term is not limited; he may be kept as long as ,
the Board desires, he may be fired as soon as !
the Board desires.
Practically, the reappointment resolves itself |
to a duration of one year, according to those j
present —until Tiny proves whether or not he
is going to have a championship team next year. 1
As everyone realizes, there has been little |

else but controversial publicity in the columns
of certain sports writers regarding the reappoint
ment of Tiny. That publicity has been detri
mental to the University; it has been based on
personalities and upon weak conjecture.
Prior to the meeting of the Board of Athletic
Control last Saturday night, it was fairly obvious
that both the students and the faculty at Stanford
were for Tiny Thornhill to the extent of offering
him a three-year contract—from all indications,
they still are.
Yet, at the same time, it also is just as obvious
that prior to the Board's meeting, certain parts
of the alumni were bitterly opposed io his re
appointment under any circumstances.
Without revealing information that cannot be
verified by the Board members themselves, the
action of the B.A.C. was clearly a compromise
between the two extremes. And that compro
mise was clearly dictated by the alumni.
The arguments for the compromise at first
seem peculiarly strong.
One of them is that publicity attendant upon
Thornhill's reappointment v/ill be stopped —
there will be no more conjecture, no more
imaginings, no more criticism. His supporters
will feel they have won a concession; his critics
will be able to get to him next year when the
matter of athletics in 1940-1941 comes up for
discussion.
Yet, the very fact of compromise only post
pones a renewal of this year's conjecture, only
points to an obvious news angle to any quali
fied newspaperman in reporting next year's
games—"Tiny Thornhill won a point in court
today, when his Indians beat Podunk."
It puts this part of the alumni in the strategic
position of being able to jump on the Thornhill
boat if he turns out a fine team next year; it puts
them in the better position of being able to yip
"I told you so" if he doesn't go to the Rose
Bowl.
All of which makes for a lengthy continua
tion of the trial of Tiny Thornhill in the news
papers when final judgment should have been
rendered last Saturday.
Another of the arguments in support of the
compromise recommendation of the Board to
President Wilbur is that if Thornhill is reap
pointed for a definite term during which he can
not be touched, the "active" alumni—that group
referred to above—will cease to support Stan
ford and Stanford athletics.
By "active" alumni, according to student
members of the Board, is meant those who fur
nish money to give Stanford athletic scholar
ships.
It is not claimed that all of those "active"
alumni will withdraw their support—only part
of them. Just how great a part, is indetermin
able. But the fact remains, they have exerted
enough pressure to dictate the policy of the
Board.
Not all the alumni—only part of them.
And the objection of that part seems to be
for no other reason than the personalities in
volved. At least, there is no other obvious rea
son; the alumni have cited no others.
The whole situation resolves itself into a defi
nition of "active" alumni.
Aren't those alumni "active" who support the
Stanford Fund or who merely spread the repu
tation of Stanford as an educational institution?
Must the definition of "active" include only
those who are against Tiny Thornhill? It would
seem that those who are for him, as well as
those who have not made any expression of
opinion at all, have not been consulted in the
present instance.
It is hard to believe that even if they have
been consulted, they will withdraw so-called
"active" support of the University, merely be
cause they are over-ruled in a legislative body.
There are nine voting members on the 8.A.C.;
the vote last Saturday was four to three in favor
of the recommendation.
The three voting student members, by their
own statement, voted against the recommenda
tion in the hope of obtaining a three-year con
tract.
In other words, it was not even a simple
majority of the Board that approved the recom
mendation.
Ordinarily, the facts on which this editorial is
based would be kept confidential. Under the
circumstances, it has been deemed advisable
by the student representatives to present them
and their implications so that Stanford may
realize the situation with which it is confronted.
Any publicity incidental to this presentation
must, at least, be based upon the facts outlined;
at least, it will be better than the vague ideas
which have resulted from secrecy in the past
and which will continue to result if Tiny must
continue under the terms of his new reappoint
ment.
If this publicity is bad, it can hardly be as bad
as a repetition of the events prior to the Board
meeting—this time spread over a whole football
season.
By this exposure, by this presentation, it is
hoped that the President will act so as to pro
tect Tiny from further trial without jury until
he has had a time sufficient to prove his case.
It is hoped also that he will act to correct the

more vicious situation of a small group of
alumni, which is not content with the satisfaction
of helping students through school, but which
feels it holds the right to dictate the policy of
the University because of financial support.
OUT of the circumstances attendant upon the
reappointment of Tiny Thornhill comes
an indication of conditions which need expres
sion in this newspaper to present them to the
proper administrative offices for correction.
The material in the following cannot be con
sidered confidential; it is not meant to be sensa
tional. Yet, the A.S.S.U. President, H. B. Lee; ;
the three student members of the Board of Ath- j
letic Control, Andy Stojkovich (for By West), j
Slan Hiserman, and Bill Paulman; and The Daily j

ment of Tiny. That publicity has been detri
mental to the University; it has been based on
personalities and upon weak conjecture.
Prior to the meeting of the Board of Athletic
Control last Saturday night, it was fairly obvious
that both the students and the faculty at Stanford
were for Tiny Thornhill to the extent of offering
him a three-year contract—from all indications,
they still are.
Yet, at the same time, it also is just as obvious
that prior to the Board's meeting, certain parts
of the alumni were bitterly opposed io his re
appointment under any circumstances.
Without revealing information that cannot be
verified by the Board members themselves, the
action of the B.A.C. was clearly a compromise
between the two extremes. And that compro
mise was clearly dictated by the alumni.
The arguments for the compromise at first
seem peculiarly strong.
One of them is that publicity attendant upon
Thornhill's reappointment v/ill be stopped —
there will be no more conjecture, no more
imaginings, no more criticism. His supporters
will feel they have won a concession; his critics
will be able to get to him next year when the
matter of athletics in 1940-1941 comes up for
discussion.
Yet, the very fact of compromise only post
pones a renewal of this year's conjecture, only
points to an obvious news angle to any quali
fied newspaperman in reporting next year's
games—"Tiny Thornhill won a point in court
today, when his Indians beat Podunk."
It puts this part of the alumni in the strategic
position of being able to jump on the Thornhill
boat if he turns out a fine team next year; it puts
them in the better position of being able to yip
"I told you so" if he doesn't go to the Rose
Bowl.
All of which makes for a lengthy continua
tion of the trial of Tiny Thornhill in the news
papers when final judgment should have been
rendered last Saturday.
Another of the arguments in support of the
compromise recommendation of the Board to
President Wilbur is that if Thornhill is reap
pointed for a definite term during which he can
not be touched, the "active" alumni—that group
referred to above—will cease to support Stan
ford and Stanford athletics.
By "active" alumni, according to student
members of the Board, is meant those who fur
nish money to give Stanford athletic scholar
ships.
It is not claimed that all of those "active"
alumni will withdraw their support—only part
of them. Just how great a part, is indetermin
able. But the fact remains, they have exerted
enough pressure to dictate the policy of the
Board.
Not all the alumni—only part of them.
And the objection of that part seems to be
for no other reason than the personalities in
volved. At least, there is no other obvious rea
son; the alumni have cited no others.
The whole situation resolves itself into a defi
nition of "active" alumni.
Aren't those alumni "active" who support the
Stanford Fund or who merely spread the repu
tation of Stanford as an educational institution?
Must the definition of "active" include only
those who are against Tiny Thornhill? It would
seem that those who are for him, as well as
those who have not made any expression of
opinion at all, have not been consulted in the
present instance.
It is hard to believe that even if they have
been consulted, they will withdraw so-called
"active" support of the University, merely be
cause they are over-ruled in a legislative body.
There are nine voting members on the 8.A.C.;
the vote last Saturday was four to three in favor
of the recommendation.
The three voting student members, by their
own statement, voted against the recommenda
tion in the hope of obtaining a three-year con
tract.
In other words, it was not even a simple
majority of the Board that approved the recom
mendation.
Ordinarily, the facts on which this editorial is
based would be kept confidential. Under the
circumstances, it has been deemed advisable
by the student representatives to present them
and their implications so that Stanford may
realize the situation with which it is confronted.
Any publicity incidental to this presentation
must, at least, be based upon the facts outlined;
at least, it will be better than the vague ideas
which have resulted from secrecy in the past
and which will continue to result if Tiny must
continue under the terms of his new reappoint
ment.
If this publicity is bad, it can hardly be as bad
as a repetition of the events prior to the Board
meeting—this time spread over a whole football
season.
By this exposure, by this presentation, it is
hoped that the President will act so as to pro
tect Tiny from further trial without jury until
he has had a time sufficient to prove his case.
It is hoped also that he will act to correct the

more vicious situation of a small group of
alumni, which is not content with the satisfaction
of helping students through school, but which
feels it holds the right to dictate the policy of
the University because of financial support.
OUT of the circumstances attendant upon the
reappointment of Tiny Thornhill comes
an indication of conditions which need expres
sion in this newspaper to present them to the
proper administrative offices for correction.
The material in the following cannot be con
sidered confidential; it is not meant to be sensa
tional. Yet, the A.S.S.U. President, H. B. Lee; ;
the three student members of the Board of Ath- j
letic Control, Andy Stojkovich (for By West), j
Slan Hiserman, and Bill Paulman; and The Daily j
feel that it should be revealed at this time to
secure definite action.
From their reports of that meeting, it easily
can be determined that a small percentage of
Stanford's alumni has been placed in the posi
tion of directing the athletic policy of the
University.
The terms under which Tiny has been rec
ommended for reappointment are indefinite. His
term is not limited; he may be kept as long as ,
the Board desires, he may be fired as soon as !
the Board desires.
Practically, the reappointment resolves itself |
to a duration of one year, according to those j
present —until Tiny proves whether or not he
is going to have a championship team next year. 1

else but controversial publicity in the columns

action of the B.A.C. was clearly a compromise
between the two extremes. And that compro
mise was clearly dictated by the alumni.
The arguments for the compromise at first
seem peculiarly strong.
One of them is that publicity attendant upon
Thornhill's reappointment v/ill be stopped —
there will be no more conjecture, no more
imaginings, no more criticism. His supporters
will feel they have won a concession; his critics
will be able to get to him next year when the
matter of athletics in 1940-1941 comes up for
discussion.
Yet, the very fact of compromise only post
pones a renewal of this year's conjecture, only
points to an obvious news angle to any quali
fied newspaperman in reporting next year's
games—"Tiny Thornhill won a point in court
today, when his Indians beat Podunk."
It puts this part of the alumni in the strategic
position of being able to jump on the Thornhill
boat if he turns out a fine team next year; it puts
them in the better position of being able to yip
"I told you so" if he doesn't go to the Rose
Bowl.
All of which makes for a lengthy continua
tion of the trial of Tiny Thornhill in the news
papers when final judgment should have been
rendered last Saturday.
Another of the arguments in support of the
compromise recommendation of the Board to
President Wilbur is that if Thornhill is reap
pointed for a definite term during which he can
not be touched, the "active" alumni—that group
referred to above—will cease to support Stan
ford and Stanford athletics.
By "active" alumni, according to student
members of the Board, is meant those who fur
nish money to give Stanford athletic scholar
ships.
It is not claimed that all of those "active"
alumni will withdraw their support—only part
of them. Just how great a part, is indetermin
able. But the fact remains, they have exerted
enough pressure to dictate the policy of the
Board.
Not all the alumni—only part of them.
And the objection of that part seems to be
for no other reason than the personalities in
volved. At least, there is no other obvious rea
son; the alumni have cited no others.
The whole situation resolves itself into a defi
nition of "active" alumni.
Aren't those alumni "active" who support the
Stanford Fund or who merely spread the repu
tation of Stanford as an educational institution?
Must the definition of "active" include only
those who are against Tiny Thornhill? It would
seem that those who are for him, as well as
those who have not made any expression of
opinion at all, have not been consulted in the
present instance.
It is hard to believe that even if they have
been consulted, they will withdraw so-called
"active" support of the University, merely be
cause they are over-ruled in a legislative body.
There are nine voting members on the 8.A.C.;
the vote last Saturday was four to three in favor
of the recommendation.
The three voting student members, by their
own statement, voted against the recommenda
tion in the hope of obtaining a three-year con
tract.
In other words, it was not even a simple
majority of the Board that approved the recom
mendation.
Ordinarily, the facts on which this editorial is
based would be kept confidential. Under the
circumstances, it has been deemed advisable
by the student representatives to present them
and their implications so that Stanford may
realize the situation with which it is confronted.
Any publicity incidental to this presentation
must, at least, be based upon the facts outlined;
at least, it will be better than the vague ideas
which have resulted from secrecy in the past
and which will continue to result if Tiny must
continue under the terms of his new reappoint
ment.
If this publicity is bad, it can hardly be as bad
as a repetition of the events prior to the Board
meeting—this time spread over a whole football
season.
By this exposure, by this presentation, it is
hoped that the President will act so as to pro
tect Tiny from further trial without jury until
he has had a time sufficient to prove his case.
It is hoped also that he will act to correct the

more vicious situation of a small group of
alumni, which is not content with the satisfaction
of helping students through school, but which
feels it holds the right to dictate the policy of
the University because of financial support.
