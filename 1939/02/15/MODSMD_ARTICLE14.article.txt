SCRATCHED FLOOR: It cost $150
to refinish the Pavilion floor after the
Junior Prom last year—all because
it rained that night and dancers
; tracked in gravel. Committeemen
agreed the junior class (now seniors)
must pay half the bill, A.S.S.U. to
j stand the rest.
Bill Turner suggested each jun
ior class pay half of the remaining
portion of the bill, "because it was
fate that made it rain that night."
"You might just as well be meta
' physical about its solution," he said,
when someone protested the bill
I never would be paid if his sugges
tion were adopted.
Killefer was authorized to investi
gate a "waxable, danceable" pro
tective covering for dance floors that
ihe had heard about.
"There's a dance Friday and it
' probably will rain," John Dern re
minded the committee.

dramatic manager, was authorized
to spend $149.01 in production of
