## 
### 
Changing their original plan, the Standing Committee of the Stanford
Political I'nion recently announeed that the topic for debate tomorrow
night would be "Resolved: that members of ibis house request President
Roosevelt to run for a third term."
This question was adopted in preference to the original bill, under
which the possibility of refusing to participate in any war would have

been considered by the I'nion. ,
Also scheduled for the meeting,
as announced by retiring President
Vincent Lcmmon will be the election
of officers, and the consideration of
.several proposed amendments to the
const itution.
OFFICER REPLACED
Other officers subject to replace
ment at the semi-annual election
arc : Gene Glasmann vice-president;
Shcwm Melinkoff, secretary; Bill
Todd, treasurer; John Eaton, ser
jeant-at-arms; and George Hislop,
chairman of the Committee on Pub
lications.
President Lcmmon also stated that
the Election Committee at its meet
ing yesterday admitted the follow
ing to membership in the Union:
Morris Giralarni, Conservative;
Mary Jane Forsythe, Conservative;
Ellen Douglas, Labor; Jane Blodget,
Labor; J. Rita Brown, Liberal; and
Mayo Cornell, Liberal.
At recent party caucuses slates
were drawn up for the five elective
offices, but no announcement will
be made until nominations are call
ed for at the business meeting.
PARTIES SPLIT
At that time party stands on the
question up for debate were also
de termined, resulting in the adher
ence to traditional party lines. Con
servatives will oppose the measure,
while Laborites unanimously sup
port it, and the Liberals threaten to
split with a majority in favor of the
proposition.
Two of the major changes pro
posed in the rules of the house in
clude a simplified plan for the make
up of the Standing Committee, and
a revision in the part to be played
by the three parties in house de
bates.
