# Lagunita Fills; Boathouse Set
## Crew to Take Over Quarters This Week 
### 
Finishing touches are being made
on the boat house this week as the
water in Lagunita rises at the rate
of nearly a foot a day with only two
feet more to go before the boat
house can be used.
John Leveran, contractor, stated
that he expected the ramp on the
right wing to be floating by tonight.
His prediction was based on the fact
that the water from the Searsville
Dam overflow will continue to raise
the lake a foot a day until it is
full.
"There are two more days of
painting to be done before we can
install the electrical fixtures. Other
than this the job is finished," Lev
eran said concerning the boathouse
construction.
H. B. Lee, student body president,
is arranging for the furniture and
canoes to be moved in this week. As
soon as this is done a regular crew
will take up residence at the boat
house.
B.A.C. IN CHARGE
"It is expected that the A.S.S.U.
1 will maintain the boathouse and the
J B.A.C. will operate it," Lee stated.
1 "Under this plan, the boathouse
' crew will be picked by the B.A.C.
i and will probably include members
;of the swimming staff to insure
competent management."
The boathouse has an office and
i men's and women's dressing rooms
| on the first floor between the two
j wings, and a glass enclosed social
I room and crew quarters on the
j second floor. The two wings have
i racking space for 48 canoes and an
; oar locker for each.
Each organization will be required
jto furnish its own lock for the
i locker. Board floating ramps, hing
|ed to the boathouse proper, will
j afford easy launching and loading.

known to the ancient Egyptians and
Hebrews.
