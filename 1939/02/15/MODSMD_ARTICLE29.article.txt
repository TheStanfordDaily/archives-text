# British Film to Show Scottish Traditions
## 
### 
Tense silence, broken only by the occasional shrill whistle of a shep
herd directing his dog will be featured in the sheep-herding contest se
quence, based on an old annual Scottish tradition, in next Sunday Night's
Movie, British-produced "To the Victor."
According t>Â» custom, Scotch shepherds gather each year to pit their
champion dogs against each other, determine which one can in the least

j time herd a given number of sheep*
i over a narrow - bridged creek,
j around some blurt's and other ob-
I stacles into a little pen. To the
j victor goes a highly prized cup.
; In the film, Adam MacAdam, the
I village meanie who is a very shaggy
j old man, owns the cup-winner for
j the past few seasons, a huge beast
named Black Wool. Many of the
\ country-folk believe that Black
j Wool is the culprit who has been
j killing neighborhood sheep on dark
< nights.
To thicken the plot, Black Wool's
! closest rival in the shepherding
| contest is a small dog belonging to
j a young man, new to the country
side, who falls in love with Mac-
Adam's beautiful daughter.
