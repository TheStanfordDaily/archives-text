# Ruggers Face Santa Rosans
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team will meet
Santa Rosa Jaysee on the practice
(ield this afternoon in a match that
promises to show some real action.
The Santa Rosarjs are coached by a
former Stanford man, Cookie Cy
pher, who used to hang out behind
the catcher's plate on the Card
baseball team some years back.
The varsity has been vigorously
knocking the distorted football
around the practice field so far this
week in preparation for the match
with U.C.L.A. Saturday. Jack
Partridge returned to the field for
the first time in three weeks yes
terday, having been laid up with a
foot injury. By West and Howard
Hickingbotham are proving them
selves to be good ruggers as well as
football players, according to Coach
Will Classen Both men are new to
the game but have shown good
progress lately, especially in the tilt
against U.S.C. last Saturday.
Jack Brenner will be out of ac
tion for the rest of the season be
cause of the broken arm he received
in the game last Saturday.
