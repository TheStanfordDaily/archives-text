A lIED-HEADEI) fireball roared
into my sanctum the other day and
demanded to know, in a somewhat
insistent manner, who the sports
editor was and where he was hid
ing at the moment.
With proper humility and bash
fulness, I blushed at his interro
gation.
"What did you want to know
about the sporting world?" I asked.
"All I want to do is to get my
hands on that !*&•':> guy and
pound a lew things into his head
iibout the importance of intramural
sports write-ups," he glowered.
"I'll tell him when he gets back,"
I countered.
And that's the congenial way in
which I finally made the acquaint
ance of Andy Stojkovich, Stanford's
student intramural boss.
♦ #
STOJKOVICII was completely
imbued with the belief that his in
tramural sports parade should re
ceive something like six times the
amount of publicity that it. had been
receiving in past issues. He told me
how a dozen groups had threatened
to picket The Daily one morning
because the basketball schedule for
that night was omitted in favor of
the results of some .second-rate
wrest ling bout down south of Sa
-1 i n as.
Then he lectured on about the
number of men who practically live
from one day to the next just to
read intramural results in The
Daily. The red-head was convincing
me that this program of his is the
most vital unit in the athletic life of
a Stanford gentleman. Then, as if
he hadn't convinced me already, he
left me desiring to know even more
about the intramural life of the In
dian males.
STOJKOVICII is an underling of
Harry Wolter, the baseball coach,
who in turn is selected by the
B.A.C. to act as faculty director of
intramurals. Stojkovich has a whole
crew of assistant managers and
must select more officials than does
Herb Dana, chief "blind man" se
lector for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. These officials and assistants
earn better than starvation hourly
wages and usually let a contest be
played in just about the manner
which the participants desire. Some
of them are young Leiths and Wat
sons; others are too much like Er
nie Bailly to receive attention here.
Last year, 1937-38 that is, when
"Stoke" was an assistant, the de
partment conducted competition in
12 sports, awarded 12 permanent
trophies and one extra-special all
year mug. The four major sports
also have perpetual cups which
must be won three times for pos
session.
Twenty-four fraternities and 32
other groups entered the year's
work in 2,580 different participa
tions. The department's statisticians
estimated that there were 6,570
hours of competition from all
sources. That's more minutes than
the world's walkathon record.
AS IE these figures weren't
enough to bring the proletariat
around to an intramural point of
view, the numbers experts go on to
show that 2,580 men took part in the
big show with 552 in football alone.
What a coach wouldn't do for a
turn-out like that!
Nope, there aren't any scholar
s'. lips awarded and the best men
often pay their own library assess
ments. Of course, some tongs and
clubs might. otTer free victuals for
the best performers, though the
number in this category is usually
small.
The whole program is based on
the love of sport and the do-or-die
traditions which the boys have as
similated since joining up with
'l appa Kegma. So Stojkovich .wins
his argument without any rebuttal
from this corner. From now on The
Daily will be the first to champion
the cause of the intramural artist.
Besides, a picket line of 2,580 men
would be powerfully tough to crack.

would be powerfully tough to crack.

into my sanctum the other day and

With proper humility and bash

"What did you want to know

pound a lew things into his head
iibout the importance of intramural
sports write-ups," he glowered.
"I'll tell him when he gets back,"
I countered.
And that's the congenial way in
which I finally made the acquaint
ance of Andy Stojkovich, Stanford's
student intramural boss.
♦ #
STOJKOVICII was completely
imbued with the belief that his in
tramural sports parade should re
ceive something like six times the
amount of publicity that it. had been
receiving in past issues. He told me
how a dozen groups had threatened
to picket The Daily one morning
because the basketball schedule for
that night was omitted in favor of
the results of some .second-rate
wrest ling bout down south of Sa
-1 i n as.
Then he lectured on about the
number of men who practically live
from one day to the next just to
read intramural results in The
Daily. The red-head was convincing
me that this program of his is the
most vital unit in the athletic life of
a Stanford gentleman. Then, as if
he hadn't convinced me already, he
left me desiring to know even more
about the intramural life of the In
dian males.
STOJKOVICII is an underling of
Harry Wolter, the baseball coach,
who in turn is selected by the
B.A.C. to act as faculty director of
intramurals. Stojkovich has a whole
crew of assistant managers and
must select more officials than does
Herb Dana, chief "blind man" se
lector for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. These officials and assistants
earn better than starvation hourly
wages and usually let a contest be
played in just about the manner
which the participants desire. Some
of them are young Leiths and Wat
sons; others are too much like Er
nie Bailly to receive attention here.
Last year, 1937-38 that is, when
"Stoke" was an assistant, the de
partment conducted competition in
12 sports, awarded 12 permanent
trophies and one extra-special all
year mug. The four major sports
also have perpetual cups which
must be won three times for pos
session.
Twenty-four fraternities and 32
other groups entered the year's
work in 2,580 different participa
tions. The department's statisticians
estimated that there were 6,570
hours of competition from all
sources. That's more minutes than
the world's walkathon record.
AS IE these figures weren't
enough to bring the proletariat
around to an intramural point of
view, the numbers experts go on to
show that 2,580 men took part in the
big show with 552 in football alone.
What a coach wouldn't do for a
turn-out like that!
Nope, there aren't any scholar
s'. lips awarded and the best men
often pay their own library assess
ments. Of course, some tongs and
clubs might. otTer free victuals for
the best performers, though the
number in this category is usually
small.
The whole program is based on
the love of sport and the do-or-die
traditions which the boys have as
similated since joining up with
'l appa Kegma. So Stojkovich .wins
his argument without any rebuttal
from this corner. From now on The
Daily will be the first to champion
the cause of the intramural artist.
