# Solid Win Streak Only Title Hope
## Vaughn Holds Hoop Score Lead with 99 Points; Zonne Sixth 
### 
Mathematically still in the pen
nant chase but virtually eliminated
following last week's tussle with
Cal, Coach Everett Dean's tSanford
hoopsters have swung back into
practice drills at the Pavilion.
Friday and Saturday the Indians
engage the U.S.C. squad in the
Southland in what will be the first
games farther away from the Pavil
ion than the Bay arefi for the Cards.
If the Deanmen could win the
rest of their games, while Cal and
S.C. split their remaining two games,
Stanford would reclaim their cham
pionship. But it's not in the cards
for the Indians and their only hope
now to salvage the season Is to win
one of the two remaining Cal games.

Mathematically still in the pen
nant chase but virtually eliminated
following last week's tussle with
Cal, Coach Everett Dean's tSanford
hoopsters have swung back into
practice drills at the Pavilion.
Friday and Saturday the Indians
engage the U.S.C. squad in the
Southland in what will be the first
games farther away from the Pavil
ion than the Bay arefi for the Cards.
If the Deanmen could win the
rest of their games, while Cal and
S.C. split their remaining two games,
Stanford would reclaim their cham
pionship. But it's not in the cards
for the Indians and their only hope
now to salvage the season Is to win
one of the two remaining Cal games.
