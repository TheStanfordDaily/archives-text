# Willy Meyer Put Skiing On the Farm Map in 1937
## Eight Days Ago Ex Com Recognized Club Begun by Fiery Young Swiss 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Skiing al Stanford may Ik- a mushroom growth—it grew fast enough,
anyhow. But now. with skiing in its third year of widespread popularity,
(he sport appears much too tenacious for any normal mushroom, as even
the gloomiest doubters will admit.
Three years ago hardly anyone from the Farm went skiing. Only
rarely did the English Coiner crowd on Monday mornings see automobiles

drive up with ski racks still ticd<
to their tops.
This year, however, 50 1o JOO
Stanfordites every week-end make
the 210-mile trip to Yosemite or
travel even longer distances to other
ski slopes.
WILLY MEYEII ARRIVES
No, they weren't skiing much at j
Stanford in the winter of 1936-37 — j
that is, not until a bright little Swiss j
named Ernst Willy Meyer reached !
the Farm. To him skiing was the
most important thing in the world.
II: a new magazine didn't have a
s'd article in it, he'd throw it out
of the window.
"Where is headquarters for your
Ski Club?" ho asked Jim Reynolds,
then A.S.S.U. president.
"Well, uh," answered Reynolds
a;id dashed out to see if there was
Kiiy sort of ski association on the
campus. All he could find was the
small, exclusive Alpine Club, most
of the members of which had been
graduated.
Fired by Willy's enthusiasm, a few
Stanfordites organized an informal
ski team and surprised the campus
by taking fourth place in the Coast
Intercollegiate Meet at Yosemite.
When they asked minor sport rec- j
0 fnition, however, they were turned
down.
DRY SKIING BEGINS
The following fall, a year and a
h df ago, Willy was back again, this
time with ambitious plans for a dry
s'ding course, which was duly sched
uled as a physical education course
lor men and women.
Coached by Willy, Ihe classes j
practiced three times a week on j
{.round which had been covered'
with straw. They practiced a spe- i
cialized series of exercises that
Meyer had worked out in order to j
build up various muscles used in ac- I
t ial skiing. The exercises since have
baen adopted by other universities.
With more and more students be
coming interested, the Stanford Ski
Club was organized, and member
ship climbed rapidly to the 300-
mark.
They were determined to have
s'.ciing recognized as a minor sport,
and a strenuous campaign reached
1 s climax when Ex Commtitee J
granted them recognition Jan. 19, j
1938, its anticlimax when Ex Com- j
mittee withdrew recognition a week
later.
GET RECOGNITION
This back-tracking was at the sug- |
g estion of Minor Sports Director'
Harry Maloney, who said skiing ap- i
pea red to be "just a mushroom that j
will disappear over night."
This year, with skiing as popular !
as ever, lobbyists again descended [
on Ex Committee. Ready for an ex- j
tended argument, Represntatives |
Bill Janss, Lloyd Davis, and Bill I
Rosenfeld were granted minor j
sports recognition without a single j
skirmish.
Mr. Maloney agreed Stanford's j
skiing was no longer a mushroom I
and advised the committee to grant !
recognition, provided the Univer- '
sity be absolved from liability in ;
case of accidents to skiers repre- i
senting the Farm.
