# Skiing Becomes Weekend Event
## Over Fifty Skiers Leave Every Friday 
### 
Every Friday afternoon and Sat
urday morning of winter quarter
sees between 50 and 150 members of
the Stanford Ski Club head for a
week-end's sport at Yosemite.
After a 212-mile ride, the skiers
establish their headquarters at the
men's dormitory at Camp Curry or
the women's dormitory at the
Lodge. Early each Saturday morn
ing the line of parked cars begins
to form outside of the ski hut at
Badger Pass, a half hour's drive
from the valley.
Approximately half of the students
bring their own skis with them on
top of their cars and half rent theirs
at Badger. First event on the morn
ing's program is waxing the skis in
the locker room or on the porch of
the ski hut if the sun is shining.
By 9 o'clock Stanford's skiers have
taken to the slopes and are busy
practicing stem turns, jump turns,
Christies, and Telemarks on the big
hill which rises steeply from the
floor of the Pass. Meanwhile be
ginners are learning the elements of
skiing, the schuss, herringbone, and
snow-plow on the nursery slope.
Those who. take the sport seriously
may spend the morning or after
noon taking lessons at the Ski
School.
To travel to the top of the ridge, a
ride on the up-ski is in order—a
service provided for members of
the Stanford Ski Club at half price.
