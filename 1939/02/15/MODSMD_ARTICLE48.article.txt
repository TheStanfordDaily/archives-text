# Skiing Becomes Weekend Event
## Over Fifty Skiers Leave Every Friday 
### 
Every Friday afternoon and Sat
urday morning of winter quarter
sees between 50 and 150 members of
the Stanford Ski Club head for a
week-end's sport at Yosemite.
After a 212-mile ride, the skiers
establish their headquarters at the
men's dormitory at Camp Curry or
the women's dormitory at the
Lodge. Early each Saturday morn
ing the line of parked cars begins
to form outside of the ski hut at
Badger Pass, a half hour's drive
from the valley.
Approximately half of the students
bring their own skis with them on
top of their cars and half rent theirs
at Badger. First event on the morn
ing's program is waxing the skis in
the locker room or on the porch of
the ski hut if the sun is shining.
By 9 o'clock Stanford's skiers have
taken to the slopes and are busy
practicing stem turns, jump turns,
Christies, and Telemarks on the big
hill which rises steeply from the
floor of the Pass. Meanwhile be
ginners are learning the elements of
skiing, the schuss, herringbone, and
snow-plow on the nursery slope.
Those who. take the sport seriously
may spend the morning or after
noon taking lessons at the Ski
School.
To travel to the top of the ridge, a
ride on the up-ski is in order—a
service provided for members of
the Stanford Ski Club at half price.
Four sleds, packed with winter
sport enthusiasts having a cigarette
and discussing snow conditions,
slide up the almost-vertical slopes
on cables.
From the top the skier has a
j choice of descending any one of live
! thrilling runs leading back to the
ski hut or taking a cross-country
I run and riding back to Badger Pass
! on a bus.
The cafeteria lunches served at
j the ski hut satisfy healthy appetites.
I Groups of students eat at tables on
j the porch on sunny days, watching
I experts dash down the big slope
and acquiring tanned "ski faces." In
I dull weather the favorite assembly
I point is the big fireplace inside of
| the hut.
i EVENINGS AT LODGE
Stanford skiers waste little time
| after lunch before they are back on
j the snow-packed slopes. Between
j 4 and 5 o'clock the snow starts to
j freeze, making for very fact skiing,
! and the time comes to head back to
I Yosemite Valley.
Evenings are usually spent sitting
I around the fire at the Lodge or in
{ bull sessions in the dormitories.
| However, a great many enthusiasts
often can be found skating at the
ice rink. Curfew comes early be
cause everyone wants to be the first
I man back on the ski slopes the next
j morning.
