# Zdarsky Made Skiing Easy- to-Learn Sport
## 
### AL ZELVER 
Tlic little old hermit-like man with the long pointed heard named
Zdarsky, whose wood relief mural Stanford Ski Club members see on
the waxing porch of Yosemite's Badger Pass Ski House, is the one
credited with having single-handed invented and introduced the revo
lutionary stem, basis of ail beginners' turns, instead of the high-speed

Telemark and Christiania swings
first used to control the down-hill
schuss.
Although hearty Norsemen, with
chores to do in the out-of-doors,
traversed ice and snow packs on
long animal bones or rough-hewn
strips of timber somewhat curved at
the fore-ends, it was not until the
latter part of the 19th century that
anyone thought of skiing for fun.
EXCELLED AT TELEMARK
It was then that the King of Nor
way proclaimed there should be a
contest to be conducted between the
townsfolk from the villages of Tele
mark and Christiania to test their
respective proficiencies on skis. The
citizens of Telemark excelled at the
Telemark turn, a high speed maneu
ver which best changes the skier's
direction in soft snow. He advances
from the crouch to the lunge posi
tion by advancing the ski opposite
to the direction in which he wishes
to turn until that foot is even with
the point of the other ski, weights
the advanced ski, unweights and
raises the heel of the unadvanced
foot, and simply steers around.
The citizens of Christiania, on
the other hand, were equally pro
ficient at the Christiania turn which
they found best on a firm snow
p. <k. This they acocmplished by a
simple, spectacular skid, with skis
together, into the new direction.
SKIING ENTERS ALPS
Sporting Englishmen who import -
cd skiing from Norway to the Swiss
Alps around the turn of the cen
tury first did only Telemarks to the
left and Christies to the right. This
was obviously a mistake because the
turns were not lor different direc
tions but different kinds of snows.
But the sport remained somewhat
the same for some years except for
the introduction of cane poles with
out traps or rings by a few radicals
who said "they help maintain the
balance."
Then came the individualist,
Zdarsky, whom all the natives call
ed "crazy."
He did away with grooves on the
b. ttoms of his skis, threw away one
pole, rode the other one like Moth
er Goose's broomstick, and, refus
ing to master the difficult Telemark
or Christie, stemmed off by him
self.
Since Zdarsky the ensy-to-learn
stem, accomplished by pointing the
skis at the curved ends by lorcing
out the heels, has been used to
brake and turn all beginning ski
ers who mighl otherwise go 100
fast, fall, and hurt themselves.
