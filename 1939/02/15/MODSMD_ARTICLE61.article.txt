# LEARNING TO FALL
## 
### 
A beginning skier should learn to
fall to the side. The soft snow will
not hurt him. If he lalls forward
he may break a binding or an ankle.
If he sits down or falls backward,
this has no braking eflect until the
skier hits some object such as a
tree and, morevore, according to
Alpine-expert Dr. Walter Amstutz,
"When the skis run away it nearly
always indicates lack of nerve or
resolution."

The biggest man on the football
fields at Illinois is usually 6-foot-2,
250-pound Wilfrid Smith.
