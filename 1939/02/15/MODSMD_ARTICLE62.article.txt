# Skiing 30 Years Old Students Tell How To Do It
## 
### BILL JANSS BUD McDUFFIE 
Skiing as a specialized, scientific
ally studied sport has existed in its
modern sense for less than 30 years.
The pioneer skiers of the Scandina
vian terrain, where skiing amounted (
to little more than sliding straight
down slopes with little thought of
turning, were confronted with un
precedented difficulties when they
first found themselves on the steep,
abrupt slopes of the Alps. It was at
ihis point, around the turn of the
last century, that modern skiing
technique was born.
that modern skiing technique was
born.
Its principles and details were de
veloped and perfected by Hannes
Schneider on the Arlberg in Austria,
and the famous Arlberg school of
skiing remains today as the most
1 successful and popular technique in
the world. It has been primarily fos
tered in California by Dr. Don Tres
sider, a Stanford graduate, president
of the Yosemite Park and Curry-Co.
At the present time the Yosemite Ski
School under the direction of Luggi
Foeger, head instructor from the
famous Schneider School, ranks as
i the most outstanding school on the
Pacific Coast.
TWO CHIEF PRINCIPLES
As developed by Schneider and as
practiced by such world renowned
skiers as Hannes Schroll and Sig
fried Engle, the Arlberg technique
| employs two basic and fundamental
i principles—vorlage and body-swing.
Vorlage, or forward-leaning, is an
indispensable requirement. It means
! keeping ahead of your skis; it does
! not mean crouching in the conven
| tional sense. In order to "keep ahead
I of your skis" it is necessary to press
the knees forward; hence the angle
between the shins and the skis is the
! most dependable measure of vorlage.
; Coupled with elasticity in the knees
| to absorb shock the skier is in posi
| tion to run downhill.
It is when the skier must turn
that he employs the second prin
! ciple—that of body-swing—and its
i many variations. Speaking very
generally, the swing turns (as con
trasted to the steered turn, i.e. tele
mark, and the jump turn, both of
J which are specialized turns for diffi
i cult snow) involve three main phases
, —counter-swing, unweighting of the
I skis, and forward swing.
| TURN SWING EXPLAINED
Counter-swing the initial phase of
J the turn, may be described as "wind
up," preparatory to the main for
| ward swing. It obviously implies
' swinging the opposite direction to the
j turn in order to have some force
wound up from which to initiate the
principal swing used actually to cxe
| cute the turn. The swing is accom
plished by turning the shoulders and
j hips while maintaining the body on
! a perpendicular axis.
j Having "wound up" by means of
the counter-swing, the skier now
| "unwinds" in the direction of the
j turn. However, it is obvious that the

skis must be unweighted to a cer
tain extent so thut the actual skid
ding of the turn can be initiated.
This is accomplished by lifting the
weight somewhat off the skis at the
jame time that the body unwinds
into its principal swing. As the skis
become unweighted and the third
phase or principal swing is begun in
the direction of the turn, there is
a slight emphasis on swinging for- !
ward in order to unweight the rear
of the skis and let them skid around.
As described by some, the sensa
tion of the forward swing should be
that of diving toward the points of
the skis. In this way the vorlage is
maintained and the skier is in posi
tion for the next turn.
Obviously such requisites as co-or
dination, timing, and smoothness are
essential to an effective swing. It
is only through actual demonstration
and practice that the theory of vor
lage and body-swing can be under
stood.
