### JOHN COBBS LIGHT WINDS 
/ 'IVILIZATION, as we learned in grammar school,
is a mighty caravan constantly moving along the
route of progress. By now most of us have recon
ciled ourselves to this cultural migration, but even so,
I am a little frightened at the current agitation for
new lights in the library. I wonder if Stanford realizes
the price it will have to pay for a new lighting
system.
Undoubtedly a revised illumination is necessary
for the Stanford of tomorrow. It is much easier on
the eyes to strike matches instead of depending on
the present library lights, and a number of students
report that the only time they can study is in the
full of the moon. Progress demands a change, but
the price will be more than ihe comptroller estimates.
Stanford does not realize how much of its life is
built around that shadowy twilight of the reading
room.
, >H * * #
Now lamps, for instance, will make one of the
principal mechanisms of our social system entirely
obsolete. As it is now, the library is noted for the way
it plays fairy godmother to romance. But it is a
rare romance that can survive scientific lighting..
The dim shadows of the reading room not only
conceal those defects which strangle love at birth;
they also add mystery. To a Stanford man, the girl
on the other side of the table appears shrouded in
an intriguing mist. To a girl the rough across the way
is a vague but interesting mass. And so the girl and
the rough go out for cokes, and in the fullness of time
there are chapel bells and stiff collars.
* * *
VL/ITH adequate lighting the girl and the rough could
study each other's defects, and would probably
go back to their books.
The University, of course, has no immediate stake
in student romance. But if there is no romance, there
will be no new generation. And without a new gen
eration Stanford will be caught short for tuition fees.
A university simply cannot afford to tinker with the
vital statistics.
Besides the social aspects, there are other features
of scientific lighting that would cause a mild revolu
tion in Stanford life. If the lights were good, we
would finish our work in about half the time it takes
us now. That means that we would have twice as
much time to amuse ourselves, and according to the
authorities, amusement on the Farm has already been
carried past the point of diminishing returns.
Moreover, consider the effect on our future. With
decent lighting, we could keep up in our work, which
means that we would probably get an education. With
an education we would be so hampered in business
that, we would probably wind up as professors or
offices boys or something equally well paid. Thus,
there would be no millionaire alumni with guilty
consciences, and the endowment fund would fold up
like an opera hat.

Progress demands new lights, but its price is ex

electric system and put in candles. They are much
more flattering and only half as efficient.
