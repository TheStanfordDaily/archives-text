It's hard to describe Joe. The least you can
say is that he was a funny guy.
People always thought he was drunk when
they first saw him. Some people thought so no
matter how many times they saw him. They
didn't know Joe. Joe wouldn't even drink coffee
unless it was half cream.
But four times he was put in the asylum to he
given the cure, and released each time as a harm
less incurable.
The night I met him he was put away, in fact. lie
had been playing the record machine—thinking il
was a slot machine—for fifteen minutes when the cops
got there.
When the cops asked him what he thought he was
doing, he did nothing but hiccough in their faces.
Joe was a nice guy, a sober, moral guy. But he
was a little uncouth.
"You are drunk," the cops said.
Joe leered at them, put a nickel in the machine,
and took off his hat, holding it out to catch ihe
jackpot.
The cops took him away for the cure.
The next time they got him in a bar. He was
putting nickels in a telephone. He thought it was
a roulette machine. Ise got China, fifteen cents
change, and another cure.
The first time he was drunk in his life was
during his third cure. According to the system at
the a.'.ylum, he had to taper off. lie was drunk for
two weeks. I lis friends claimed that if he had
had to taper off for another week he would have
got (lie D.T.'s.
Simply the fact that Joe was very dumb doesn't
explain nil of his problems. His life had been warped.
As a baby he had been in the cradle so long that, it
had to be enlarged three times. He was 22-years-old
before lie had passed one night without 12 hours'
sleep.
But when he was 22 his parents thought it was
time he left the nursery and got a job. The only job
he could get was as night watchman.
That was very tough on Joe. Aftcy the first month
he got so he could stay awake all night, but he never
reached the point where he could look or act as if he
were awake.
* # * «
After two years lie was fired. IJut by that time
he was convinced that his career was to be that
of a night-watchman, lie never gave up looking
for a job. And all the time lie was out of work
lie knew he didn't dare get into the habit of sleep
ing at night. He would never he able to hold a
job again.
That's why he hung around bars. They were
always open later than any other place.
It was simply unfortunate lhat he was always so
sleepy and mumbled and staggered and looked drunk
at night. And that he was so dumb.
We never thought Joe's last arrest for the cure
was quite fair. Joe had adopted the habit, of taking
his lunch with him to the bar at night. The cops
caught him at 2 a.m. loudly singing "The Old Mill
Stream, eating a ham sandwich, and drinking milk.
Out of a whiskey bottle.
According to the written report at the asylum,
Joe passed out as soon as they got him in bed.
I saw Joe iust a few minutes ago. He was
down on the floor on his hands and knees with one
shoe off cracking peanuts.

After two years lie was fired. IJut by that time
he was convinced that his career was to be that
of a night-watchman, lie never gave up looking
for a job. And all the time lie was out of work
lie knew he didn't dare get into the habit of sleep
ing at night. He would never he able to hold a
job again.
That's why he hung around bars. They were
always open later than any other place.
It was simply unfortunate lhat he was always so
sleepy and mumbled and staggered and looked drunk
at night. And that he was so dumb.
We never thought Joe's last arrest for the cure
was quite fair. Joe had adopted the habit, of taking
his lunch with him to the bar at night. The cops
caught him at 2 a.m. loudly singing "The Old Mill
Stream, eating a ham sandwich, and drinking milk.
Out of a whiskey bottle.
According to the written report at the asylum,
Joe passed out as soon as they got him in bed.
I saw Joe iust a few minutes ago. He was
down on the floor on his hands and knees with one
shoe off cracking peanuts.
It's hard to describe Joe. The least you can
say is that he was a funny guy.
People always thought he was drunk when
they first saw him. Some people thought so no
matter how many times they saw him. They
didn't know Joe. Joe wouldn't even drink coffee
unless it was half cream.
But four times he was put in the asylum to he
given the cure, and released each time as a harm
less incurable.
The night I met him he was put away, in fact. lie
had been playing the record machine—thinking il
was a slot machine—for fifteen minutes when the cops
got there.
When the cops asked him what he thought he was
doing, he did nothing but hiccough in their faces.
Joe was a nice guy, a sober, moral guy. But he
was a little uncouth.
"You are drunk," the cops said.
Joe leered at them, put a nickel in the machine,
and took off his hat, holding it out to catch ihe
jackpot.
The cops took him away for the cure.
The next time they got him in a bar. He was
putting nickels in a telephone. He thought it was
a roulette machine. Ise got China, fifteen cents
change, and another cure.
The first time he was drunk in his life was
during his third cure. According to the system at
the a.'.ylum, he had to taper off. lie was drunk for
two weeks. I lis friends claimed that if he had
had to taper off for another week he would have
got (lie D.T.'s.
Simply the fact that Joe was very dumb doesn't
explain nil of his problems. His life had been warped.
As a baby he had been in the cradle so long that, it
had to be enlarged three times. He was 22-years-old
before lie had passed one night without 12 hours'
sleep.
But when he was 22 his parents thought it was
time he left the nursery and got a job. The only job
he could get was as night watchman.
That was very tough on Joe. Aftcy the first month
he got so he could stay awake all night, but he never
reached the point where he could look or act as if he
were awake.
