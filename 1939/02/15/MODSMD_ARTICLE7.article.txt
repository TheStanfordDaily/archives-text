# New Chappie Out To Get 'Kampus Kads'
## 
### 
"Broken Heart Department" will
be a feature of the "Kollege Knowl
edge Knumber" of Chappie which
comes out today. Acting as "Father
Confessor of all heart - broken
women on the campus," Old Boy Art
Levinson prints a few of the letters
which have been pouring in to him
in the past few weeks:
A brilliant freshman cartoonist,
Dolores Thornton, is discovered in
today's issue, according to Levinson.
Miss Thornton is the sister of Alex
Yuill-Thornton, cartoonist for the
California Pelican, and whose car
toons appear in "New Republic"
and other magazines.
Carrying out the "Kollege" theme
is a thesis by Dave Leff, entitled
"How to Get Your Ph. 0.0." Other
features include Willurd Stephens'
"Once Is Enough," a story telling of
the hazards of studying; "Blue Prints
for the Anatomy of Tomorrow," by
Gordon Steedman, ex-Chappie edi
tor; and John Cobbs' "Mahmud, the
Genial Genie."
Cartoons are by Jack Hurt, Bar
ney McClure, Jack Dixon, Marbry
Ponsford, Elaine Stone, and others,
with poems by Dave Leff and Bert
Rosenfeld.
