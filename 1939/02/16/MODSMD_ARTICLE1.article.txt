IT'S a long way from the capitals
of Europe to Professor Graham
Stuart's office in the political .science
department. Despite the distance,
Dr. Stuart appears to be keeping
close connection with the interna
tional grapevine that whispers of
the fate of world powers.
Three weeks ago, foreseeing that
the Rome-Berlin axis would gain
little from the victory of the Span
ish Insurgents, he predicted early
recognition of Franco's government
by England and France. The past
few days have shown that Mussolini
and Hitler are bound for disap
pointment if they expect the suc
cessful rebels to kowtow to the to
talitarian twins.

YESTERDAY the rest of Pro
fessor Stuart's prediction came
true. With promise of immediate
imitation hy France, the British
Cabinet announced that it has
withdrawn its recognition from
the Republic, and will recognize
Francisco Franco as the head of
the government of Spain. At long
last we have concrete evidence to
show that Britain and France arc
working to increase their own
power in Europe and not in the
interests of democracy.
At the same time as it announced
recognition for the Insurgents, the
Cabinet excitedly asked Parlia
ment to double its investment in
armaments. Believing that England
will only be safe when she is armed
to the teeth, Prime Minister Cham
berlain requested that the present
$2,090,000,000 appropriation be in
creased to $4,000,000,000. There's a
good chance that they may have to
protect the white-chalk cliffs be
fore long.

JOEALIZING that facts are facts,
and war can come despite all
that New Dealers and anti-New
Dealers may do about it, the Sen
ate passed President Roosevelt's na
tional defense program yesterday by
a landslide vote. Obediently, the
senators defeated all amendments
proposed to the bill and sent it on
its way to the 'House.
Chief features of the new scheme
for continental defense include
raising the army's first-line fight
ing plane strength to 5500 within
the next two years and making
the Panama Canal impregnable to
attack.

J>IGHT in line with the United
States' and Britain's armament
increases are preparations for im
mediate war made in Germany yes
terday. The latest Nazi decree gives
the government authority to draft
ihe services of every man in the
Reich at any salary and during any
period of time it may set.
Formerly the Hitler directorate
could demand the sendees of any
civilian, but at the salary he was
receiving in private life and for a
limited period only. The new meas
ure puts the entire population of
Nazidom at the government's im- j
mediate disposal in case of war. It
should make fine camion-fodder.

r | I HK much-disputed testimony
concerning the United States'
sale of planes to France, given at
a secret meeting of the President
and the Senate Military Commit
tee, will he made public tomor
row. To satisfy the howling of
the isolationist wolves and those
who arc just plain curious, all the
proceedings of the conference ex
cept military secrets will he re
vealed.
One thing that this move should
accomplish is to quash the rumors
and accusations circulated about
Roosevelt's mysterious deal with the
French government.

r I' , HE Military Committee also an
nounced yesterday that it will
invite Ambassador to Berlin Hugh
Wilson to discuss European affairs.
Both Joseph P. Kennedy and Wil- I
liam C. Bullitt, ambassadors to I
London and Paris, conferred with
members of the committee during
their visits to the United States, but
Wilson has not expressed his opin
ion since Roosevelt recalled him
from Germany last fall,
â™¦ * #
ys (he day approaches for the
1 meeting of the college of card
inals in Rome to elect a successor
to Pius XI, the Catholic world is
overflowing with predictions as to
who the next Pope will he.
Yesterday authorities on Church
procedure issued from the Vatican
their official dope sheet. Most like
ly candidate for the papacy is Elias
Cardinal Delia Costa, Archbishop of
Florence, considered the logical man
because his religious career has been
free from rightist or leftist tenden
cies.
Other prelates on the offiical list
arc four of Italy's outstanding arch
bishops. There is little reason to be
lieve that a non-Italian will be
elected Pope. Such an action prob
ably would prove dangerous to in
ternational affairs and would break
a precedent which has stood since
1522.
The date for the meeting of the
college of cardinals has not defi
nitely been set but it must open be
fore March 1. if the expressed wish
of Pius XI is to be considered.
