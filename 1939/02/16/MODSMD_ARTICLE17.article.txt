j dent lawyers who will participate in the final trial of the 19.18-39 Moot
I Court competition. Those chosen are Edward Butterwortli, William Wood
ward, Leroy Wright and George Whitney.

"Selection of the four finalists
was extremely difficult aa ail 12
semi-finalists were very good. The
finalists were chosen on the basis of
presentation, which we felt came
nearest to that of actual lawyers in
court," Robert Blewett, chairman of
the Moot Court Board stated. "The
trials are not merely debates; there
fore, legal reasoning instead of for
ensic style was counted most in our
considerations."
Alternates named are Robert Ad
ams, Jr., Bruce Beckley, and Adele
Walsh Moran. Other semi-finalists
are Dave Lombardi, Joe Lawry,
William Knapp, Andrew Spears, and
Dave Folsom.
TO MEET IN SPRING
Butterwortli, Woodward, Wright,
and Whitney, the finalists, will be
paired into two teams, and will ar
gue a case before three California
Supreme Court justices during the
third week of spring quarter. The
question to be argued has not been
selected, but it will be on some
current constitutional question.
The winning team receives a $100
cash prize. The award is presented
by the Stanford Student Law Asso
ciation who also sponsor the Moot
Court competition.
This competition is strictly a stu
dent function and consists of a se
ries of trials in which second and
third-year lawyers argue legal cas
es. It is governed by a student com
mittee.
PROCEDURE CHANGED
Tlie 1938-39 Moot Court Board in
stituted numerous changes in pro
cedure. For the first time, a semi
final elimination was held as pre
viously there were only the prelim
inaries and the final.
According to Chairman Blewett,
the most significant innovation is
the change in the judging of cases.
Well known lawyei's from San
Francisco were obtained to rule
over the preliminary trials. The
anee of their attendance when votes
semi-final contests were judged by
Superior Court judges, while the
final trial will be decided by three
California Supreme Court judges.
This year two student judges se
lected from the Moot Court Board
have assisted the head judge on the
bench. Previously only faculty
members and some Superior Court
jurists presided over the trials.
In explaining the larger attend
ance and increased interest in the
Moot Court, Blewett attributed it to
the arguing of "stream-lined ques
tions which have been of greater
interest to the layman than the
purely technical law cases."
The Moot. Court Board is now con
sidering a competition for first-year
law students to be instituted next
year. Members of the board be
sides Blewett are John MacFar
land, William Snell, Charles Bur
kett, Jesse Feldman, and Harold
Fulkerson.
The importance and significance
of the competition is well explain
ed by Chief Justice of the Califor
nia Supreme Court William H.
Waste. "I deem a Moot Court, such
as that conducted at Stanford, a
most valuable adjunct to any law
school."

Moot Court, Blewett attributed it to
the arguing of "stream-lined ques
tions which have been of greater
interest to the layman than the
purely technical law cases."
The Moot. Court Board is now con
sidering a competition for first-year
law students to be instituted next
year. Members of the board be
sides Blewett are John MacFar
land, William Snell, Charles Bur
kett, Jesse Feldman, and Harold
Fulkerson.
The importance and significance
of the competition is well explain
ed by Chief Justice of the Califor
nia Supreme Court William H.
Waste. "I deem a Moot Court, such
as that conducted at Stanford, a
most valuable adjunct to any law
school."
After a careful and lengthy consideration which extended over three
meetings, the Moot Court Board yesterday finally selected the four wtu
j dent lawyers who will participate in the final trial of the 19.18-39 Moot
I Court competition. Those chosen are Edward Butterwortli, William Wood
ward, Leroy Wright and George Whitney.

"Selection of the four finalists
was extremely difficult aa ail 12
semi-finalists were very good. The
finalists were chosen on the basis of
presentation, which we felt came
nearest to that of actual lawyers in
court," Robert Blewett, chairman of
the Moot Court Board stated. "The
trials are not merely debates; there
fore, legal reasoning instead of for
ensic style was counted most in our
considerations."
Alternates named are Robert Ad
ams, Jr., Bruce Beckley, and Adele
Walsh Moran. Other semi-finalists
are Dave Lombardi, Joe Lawry,
William Knapp, Andrew Spears, and
Dave Folsom.

current constitutional question.

cash prize. The award is presented
by the Stanford Student Law Asso
ciation who also sponsor the Moot
Court competition.
This competition is strictly a stu
dent function and consists of a se
ries of trials in which second and
third-year lawyers argue legal cas
es. It is governed by a student com
mittee.
PROCEDURE CHANGED
Tlie 1938-39 Moot Court Board in
stituted numerous changes in pro
cedure. For the first time, a semi
final elimination was held as pre
viously there were only the prelim
inaries and the final.
According to Chairman Blewett,
the most significant innovation is
the change in the judging of cases.
Well known lawyei's from San
Francisco were obtained to rule
over the preliminary trials. The
anee of their attendance when votes
semi-final contests were judged by
Superior Court judges, while the
final trial will be decided by three
California Supreme Court judges.
This year two student judges se
lected from the Moot Court Board
have assisted the head judge on the
bench. Previously only faculty
members and some Superior Court
jurists presided over the trials.
In explaining the larger attend
ance and increased interest in the
Moot Court, Blewett attributed it to
the arguing of "stream-lined ques
tions which have been of greater
interest to the layman than the
