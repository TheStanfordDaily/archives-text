# Gunther Cites Menace Of European Domination By Totalitarian States
## Author Analyzes Hitler's Victory At 'Peace of Munich'; Presents Views On Sino-Japanese Conflict 
### 
In analyzing Hitler's victory at (lie "Peace of Munich," and pointing
to Mussolini's favored position in the present Spanish crisis, John Gunther,
speaking last night in the Memorial Hall, emphasized the fact that domi
nation of Europe hy totalitarian ideologies is more of a menace than is
generally suspected.
"With the British and French feverishly rearming," said the author
and former European staff correspondent of the Chicago Daily News, "it

is only too obvious that the sell-out<
of Czechoslovakia was not a guar
antee of continental peacc, but has
served to bolster the Nazi position
in Europe."
Supplementing his remarks on
European conditions, Gunther gave
his large audience, present at the
first of the series ot lectures spon
sored by the A.S.S.U., his personal
views on the possibilities which
might grow out of the Sino-Japa
nese conflict.
CHINESE STALEMATE
Pointing to the impossibility of
Japan's actually driving the China
man out of China, and in the same
way demonstrating "that it is ridi
culous to believe the Japanese can
be driven into the sea," he predicted
that the island state wor d even
tually make an "undeclared peace"
with the Chinese and "concentrate
on cementing their conquests along
the sea coast."
In commenting on the "Munich
surrender," Gunther explained that
with Chamberlain practically hold
ing the fate of Europe in his hands
"it was in the best interests of the
British Empire as well as a practical
necessity for the Prime Minister to
back down."
With armaments far below what
they should have been, and a real
fear of the German air force among
cabinet officers, it was pointed out
that a test of democratic strength
might have been disastrous at the
time.
LOOKING FORWARD
"Looking to the future," said Gun
ther, "we can depend on the well
known British policy of armed
watchful waiting, and with her
military might increasing rapidly
we can count on a more cautious
Hitler on the continent.
Turning to the Spanish situation
the lecturer explained that with over
50,000 Italian troops involved in the
current war, it was more than likely
that Mussolini would use them to
obtain concessions from the French
and British in the Mediterranean.
"With the democracies clamoring
for the immediate evacuation of the
Italians," he said, "Mussolini is in
an excellent position to ask as the
price for this, favored rights in the
Suez, the Pcd Sea, or the Mediter
ranean."
