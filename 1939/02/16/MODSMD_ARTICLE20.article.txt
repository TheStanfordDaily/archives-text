# Midquarters To Be Slated Like Finals
## Suggestd Schedule Will Eliminate Two Tests on Same Day 
### 
Two mid-quarter examinations on
the same day will be eliminated for
the most part, if instructors adhere
to the suggested schedule sent out
yesterday by the executive commit
tee of the School of Social Sciences.
The action came as a resutl of nu
merous student complaints of the
hardship worked by more than one
test on the same day.
Although the schedule applies
formally only to the School of So
cial Sciences, largest school in the
University, the committee is sending
out its schedule to other schools and
departments with the suggestion
they follow it where possible.
EXAM SCHEDULE
The schedule follows:
8 o'clock exams—Tuesdays
9 o'clock exams—Mondays or Fri
days
10 o'clock exams—Wednesdays
11 o'clock exams—Thursdays
An option is offered in the case of
9 o'clock examinations since some
courses do not meet on Mondays,
others do not meet on Fridays.
Commenting on the plan, Profes
sor Edwin A. Cottrell, chairman of
the School of Soical Sicences, point
ed out a few difficulties.
COTTRELL COMMENTS
''This schedule will -not prevent
doubled-up examinations entirely,"
he said, "since there are several af
ternoon classes not included in the
scheme."
Also, the Department of Psy
chology, which generally schedules
its classes for MTThF, cannot give
its 10 o'clock tests on Wednesday as
the schedule provides.
"Tills plan is purely a suggestion,"
said Professor Cottrell, "and it will
not be applied in all cases. One dif
ficulty is that instructors are likely
to follow schedule once and then
forget about it."
