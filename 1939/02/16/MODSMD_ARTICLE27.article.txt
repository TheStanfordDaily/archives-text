# Naval Officer Talks on Orient At Lunch Club
## Commander Bryant Discusses 'America's Stake in Far East' 
### 
"Does America's Stake in the Far
East Justify Armed Conflict?" was
the topic discussed by Commander
Stewart Bryant at yesterday's meet
ing of the Luncheon Club.
"There' is a difference between an
attempt to formulate our policies
upon immediate interests from the
American point of view, or long
term, deep-seated, tremendously
powerful shifts in world power," he
said. "We have in our hands edu
cational weapons that can build up
civilization beyond the dreams of
any civilized society, so we can
well ask ourselves why civilization
has to decay before we are faced
with the menace of world conflict."
Commander Bryant continued
with a discussion of the United
States' Open Door in China and
the question of the Philippines. He
also spoke of the question of future
Japanese power and the situation
created by the machine age, the
lack of land lor colonization, and
the rise of the working classes in
the world.
"Are we going to go into this to
protect American interests or to
block and check these great chang
es that will come whether we like it
or not?" he asked. "Japan's impulse
was to come eastward, but the Unit
ed tSates shut out both people and
goods. After turning them back
from our shores, will we keep them
from going into China? Are we to
stop her from seeking a new area
where she can disperse her indus
trial centers as a protection from the
threat of Russia?"
