### 
COEUR D'ALENE. Idaho, Feb. 15
(UP). â€” Using the compass of his
wrecked plane to guide him, Roy
Shreck, Spokane weather observa
tion pilot, walked out of the wilder
ness of the Idaho Panhandle to safe
ty today, ending a three-day search
by rescuers who had given him up
for dead.
Flying blind and out of gasoline,
Mr. Shreck made a crash landing
on a heavily wooded mountainside
blanketed with fog, early Sunday.
Trees demolished his single-motored
biplane but Shreck said he suffered
only a "slight" back injury.

Chicago University's football team
was the first to use numerals on their
players' backs.
