### ARCH JENKINS 
REALIZING as we do that this is
open season on Board of Athletic
Control members, we went down
yesterday and bought the biggest
and newest gun we could find.
This gat shoots campus opinion,
and in the few practice pings we
have taken already, it is becoming
more and more apparent that the
wrath of student ire is going to be
shot down the respective throats of
the members in question unless
these members begin to make a gen
uine effort to express the sentiment
of the University as a whole. The
weapons on their side arc those of
(1) the possession of the monetary
aid which athletes need and desire,
and (2) the sublime belief that they
are in a position which we, mere
students, have no right to chal
lenge.
The Thornhill mis-deal is resting
in the background at the moment
insofar as this small corner is con
cerned. What agitates us at the cur
rent sitting is the terrific jumble in
which these Plutarchs of the playing
fields have left the fate of Angell
Field, the No-Man's Land of the
track world.
«ti $ ijt
A COUPLE of meetings ago sev- I
eral sincere yet quiet track men
tried to get in on the proceedings
of a monthly B.A.C. star chamber
session. The bigwigs kindly gave'
the shy delegation a few precious
moments of their time, then roughly J
shooed them on their way before j
the meeting proper commenced. It I
was like a fair trial in Germany.
What is this boai'd down there, any- j
way? Is it the Hitler regime or a
common, ordinary open get-together !
here at Stanford?
The answer to that one makes us I
blush when someone talks of Stan- j
lord democracy. Athletic democracy
died on the Farm when the mighty
three ascended the tri-seated throne.
The track men, the natural group
to lead the agitation, feel that an
injustice is being done. They have
already written letters to certain
alumni who happen to have it with
in their power to melt the gold
studded crowns of the kingly trio
and transform the residue into
dollars to build a decent ring around
the Angell oval.
Perhaps you didn't know that the
board did pass a resolution or a
bill or maybe just an edict last
Saturday that the bleachers should j
be constructed. But they forgot one j
minor detail. They deferred the
grant of money until such a time
that they should deem the board's
finances capable of such a trick.
(Editor's Note: Some wag has pass- I
ed the ruse around that the B.A.C. i
was lucky to make $69,000 last year j
—a mere pittance.)
NOW ALL we have to do is to (
convince the rules committee that
their judgment on Angell is unwise, \
illogical, and financially question- i
able. These same men will prob- !
ably vote an assessment in the j
neighborhood of twenty-five to !
filty thousand dollars for minor re- I
pairs on the Stanford stadium some- !
time before June — and that ain't
hay.
Track at Stanford is capable of
drawing at least one crowd every
year of ten thousand people. In
years when the Indians have teams
with (he potentialities of the pres
ent crop, we could hit twenty thou
sand for the Big Meet and for the
U.S.C. encounter. As it is, the faith
ful would rather sta/ home and play
pedro. After all, nothing sensational
will ever happen on the stadium
mire, so why waste the four-bits
the tickets might cost? To use the '
vernacular, it's a helluva note.

THE GENTLEMEN will be ex
tremely difficult to budge from their
opinions. They invested twenty-five
thousand in the original Angell j
budget; now they're going to be
content to drop the investment as a
bad deal. Things like that don't
happen in real life.
The U.S.C. meet this year is on
May G. II the board meets around
the first of February, they can pass
the assessment and have con
struction under way in another
week. If they want, they can build
five thousand for a starter and use
temporary stands for the first year
for overflow crowds. Once they see
what an improvement they have
made, it's possible that Angell will
have seats for twenty thousand be
fore the fall of 1940.

A COUPLE of meetings ago sev- I
eral sincere yet quiet track men
tried to get in on the proceedings
of a monthly B.A.C. star chamber
session. The bigwigs kindly gave'
the shy delegation a few precious
moments of their time, then roughly J
shooed them on their way before j
the meeting proper commenced. It I
was like a fair trial in Germany.
What is this boai'd down there, any- j
way? Is it the Hitler regime or a
common, ordinary open get-together !
here at Stanford?
The answer to that one makes us I
blush when someone talks of Stan- j
lord democracy. Athletic democracy
died on the Farm when the mighty
three ascended the tri-seated throne.
The track men, the natural group
to lead the agitation, feel that an
injustice is being done. They have
already written letters to certain
alumni who happen to have it with
in their power to melt the gold
studded crowns of the kingly trio
and transform the residue into
dollars to build a decent ring around
the Angell oval.
Perhaps you didn't know that the
board did pass a resolution or a
bill or maybe just an edict last
Saturday that the bleachers should j
be constructed. But they forgot one j
minor detail. They deferred the
grant of money until such a time
that they should deem the board's
finances capable of such a trick.
(Editor's Note: Some wag has pass- I
ed the ruse around that the B.A.C. i
was lucky to make $69,000 last year j
—a mere pittance.)
NOW ALL we have to do is to (
convince the rules committee that
their judgment on Angell is unwise, \
illogical, and financially question- i
able. These same men will prob- !
ably vote an assessment in the j
neighborhood of twenty-five to !
filty thousand dollars for minor re- I
pairs on the Stanford stadium some- !
time before June — and that ain't
hay.
Track at Stanford is capable of
drawing at least one crowd every
year of ten thousand people. In
years when the Indians have teams
with (he potentialities of the pres
ent crop, we could hit twenty thou
sand for the Big Meet and for the
U.S.C. encounter. As it is, the faith
ful would rather sta/ home and play
pedro. After all, nothing sensational
will ever happen on the stadium
mire, so why waste the four-bits
the tickets might cost? To use the '
vernacular, it's a helluva note.

THE GENTLEMEN will be ex
tremely difficult to budge from their
opinions. They invested twenty-five
thousand in the original Angell j
budget; now they're going to be
content to drop the investment as a
bad deal. Things like that don't
happen in real life.
The U.S.C. meet this year is on
May G. II the board meets around
the first of February, they can pass
the assessment and have con
struction under way in another
week. If they want, they can build
five thousand for a starter and use
temporary stands for the first year
for overflow crowds. Once they see
what an improvement they have
made, it's possible that Angell will
have seats for twenty thousand be
fore the fall of 1940.
REALIZING as we do that this is
open season on Board of Athletic
Control members, we went down
yesterday and bought the biggest
and newest gun we could find.
This gat shoots campus opinion,
and in the few practice pings we
have taken already, it is becoming
more and more apparent that the
wrath of student ire is going to be
shot down the respective throats of
the members in question unless
these members begin to make a gen
uine effort to express the sentiment
of the University as a whole. The
weapons on their side arc those of

What is this boai'd down there, any- j
way? Is it the Hitler regime or a
common, ordinary open get-together !
here at Stanford?
The answer to that one makes us I
blush when someone talks of Stan- j
lord democracy. Athletic democracy
died on the Farm when the mighty
three ascended the tri-seated throne.
The track men, the natural group
to lead the agitation, feel that an
injustice is being done. They have
already written letters to certain
alumni who happen to have it with
in their power to melt the gold
studded crowns of the kingly trio
and transform the residue into
dollars to build a decent ring around
the Angell oval.
Perhaps you didn't know that the
board did pass a resolution or a
bill or maybe just an edict last
Saturday that the bleachers should j
be constructed. But they forgot one j
minor detail. They deferred the
grant of money until such a time
that they should deem the board's
finances capable of such a trick.
(Editor's Note: Some wag has pass- I
ed the ruse around that the B.A.C. i
was lucky to make $69,000 last year j
—a mere pittance.)
NOW ALL we have to do is to (
convince the rules committee that
their judgment on Angell is unwise, \
illogical, and financially question- i
able. These same men will prob- !
ably vote an assessment in the j
neighborhood of twenty-five to !
filty thousand dollars for minor re- I
pairs on the Stanford stadium some- !
time before June — and that ain't
hay.
Track at Stanford is capable of
drawing at least one crowd every
year of ten thousand people. In
years when the Indians have teams
with (he potentialities of the pres
ent crop, we could hit twenty thou
sand for the Big Meet and for the
U.S.C. encounter. As it is, the faith
ful would rather sta/ home and play
pedro. After all, nothing sensational
will ever happen on the stadium
mire, so why waste the four-bits
the tickets might cost? To use the '
vernacular, it's a helluva note.

THE GENTLEMEN will be ex
tremely difficult to budge from their
opinions. They invested twenty-five
thousand in the original Angell j
budget; now they're going to be
content to drop the investment as a
bad deal. Things like that don't
happen in real life.
The U.S.C. meet this year is on
May G. II the board meets around
the first of February, they can pass
the assessment and have con
struction under way in another
week. If they want, they can build
five thousand for a starter and use
temporary stands for the first year
for overflow crowds. Once they see
what an improvement they have
made, it's possible that Angell will
have seats for twenty thousand be
fore the fall of 1940.
REALIZING as we do that this is
open season on Board of Athletic
Control members, we went down
yesterday and bought the biggest
and newest gun we could find.
This gat shoots campus opinion,
and in the few practice pings we
have taken already, it is becoming
more and more apparent that the
wrath of student ire is going to be
shot down the respective throats of
the members in question unless
these members begin to make a gen
uine effort to express the sentiment
of the University as a whole. The
weapons on their side arc those of
(1) the possession of the monetary
aid which athletes need and desire,
and (2) the sublime belief that they
are in a position which we, mere
students, have no right to chal
lenge.
The Thornhill mis-deal is resting
in the background at the moment
insofar as this small corner is con
cerned. What agitates us at the cur
rent sitting is the terrific jumble in
which these Plutarchs of the playing
fields have left the fate of Angell
Field, the No-Man's Land of the
track world.

A COUPLE of meetings ago sev- I
eral sincere yet quiet track men
tried to get in on the proceedings
of a monthly B.A.C. star chamber
session. The bigwigs kindly gave'
the shy delegation a few precious
moments of their time, then roughly J
shooed them on their way before j
the meeting proper commenced. It I
was like a fair trial in Germany.
