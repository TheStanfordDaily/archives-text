# Mermen Set For Oregon Meet Today
## Thornton Sees Thin Victory for Cards Over Webfoot Team 
### CHARLEY BULL 
38-37. That is how the score
board might look this afternoon at
the finish of the Oregon-Stanford
swimming meet, which will start at
the Encina pools at 3 o'clock.
This thin victory can be eked out
by the Card swimmers if they all
turn in the times Coach Nort Thorn
ton expects of them. Stanford hopes
have been bolstered by the return
of Captain Win Needham to the
water. Though he will not swim both
his regular races, the 220 and 440, it
is possible that he will grab a first
in the 440.
The first event, the medley relay,
is about a toss-up between the two
teams, with a slight possible edge
going to Oregon, but it will be a
fast and good race. Hal Weatherbe
should be able to take the nod over
the Duck captain. Jack Levy, in the
220, with Johnny Brahtz even a pos
sible second. Roy Vitousek, Indian
soph flash, is practically a cinch for
a win in the 50 over Tom Starbuck
of Oregon. ,
DIVING CONTEST
Diving will pit the Cards' Roy
Winkelmann, Coast champ, against
Leo Gaffney, a soph transfer to
Oregon from Fullerton Jaysee, who
is expected to push Wink to his best
and possibly win. In the 100 Vitou
sek can take Starbuck again, but it
will be a close race.
Probably the best race of the af
ternoon will be the 150-yard back
stroke. Sherman Wetmore, who set
the Coast record for the 20-yard
pool last week against Washington,
will fight a nip and tuck race
against Card Bill Weeden, who has
bettered the Conference mark for
the 25-yard pool. A new record will
probably be set with the winner a
toss-up.
OREGON TO PLACE
The Ducks are capable of sweep
ing one and two in the 200-yard
breaststroke with Jack Dallas and
Ralph Lafferty in that order, but
Bill Hatch might upset the Duck
bucket with a second. If Needham's
lay-off doesn't slow him down too
much he will be able to cop first
place in the 440 free with Hal
Weatherbe fighting those Ducks for
second place.
Last event of the afternoon will be
the 400-yard free style relay. This
race will without a doubt be the
deciding factor of the whole meet
and the Cards axe counting on win
ning these last seven points.
With the weather man promising
to hold off the rain for the all
important event on the Stanford
swimmers' calendar, the meet should
be a roaring success with spectator
interest at a new high for this sport.
Admission will be free.
