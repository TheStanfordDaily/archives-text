## 
### 
Announcing the twelve men who will make up the traveling squad
to Los Angeles this week-end. Coach Everett Dean continued laying plans
for the bearding of the U.S.C. Trojan tomorrow and Saturday nights in
the southern village.
The first string of Captain Phil Zonne, Harlan C'opsey, Don Burness.
j Kenny Davidson and Dick Lyon will be abetted by Don Williams, Lee
Lafaille and Frank Wells, forwards; Will Anderson, center; Bill Rapp.
' Gil Rahn and Bob Burnett .guards.
Stanford's most notable conference was the first Trojan game in

j the Pavilion five weeks ago, and<
| the Indians are confident they can '
j assure themselves of at least an j
j even .500 average in the final league i
j standings by splitting with the Sam i
\ Barrymen.
However, the Trojans are a bet- j
| ter team now than the team that
i faced the Indians in the opening'
| series, although the personnel is the
j same. Dale Sears, blubbery center,
i has been going great guns since he
; had a small piece of steel removed J
! from one of his eyes. Sears scored j
| only eight points in the first two j
I Stanford-S.C. games.
On top of that Ralph Vaughn has
! been winging along at a 16.5 points!
j per game average and is looming as |
1 a possible threat to eclipse Luiset- j
I ti's individual scoring record. Jack!
i Morrison has moved into the Troy j
] forward wall in place of Clem Ruh I
j and has also been scoring well.
Tom McGarvin, just about the]
i best defensive guard in the confer- j
ence, and Captain Gail Goodrich J
| round out the U.S.C. team.
