# Santa Rosa Beats Farm 'B' Ruggers
## 
### 
The Santa Rosa ruggers proved
I too much for the Card B team yes- j
; terday afternoon and took the tus- |
| sic 6 to 0. The Santa Rosans had a j
j fast forward line that handled the'
j ball in good enough style to win the j
i game, although as usual the Stan- I
ford ruggers put up a healthy fight, j
The varsity has been practicing i
! hard and furiously the last several ,
| nights in preparation for the big |
I game with U.C.L.A. Saturday in the i
I stadium. The players insist upon ;
, staying at the field as long as the j
' ball can be seen, and don't even;
j want to stop when the coachcs [
j blow the whistle calling off practice, j
j Injuries and bruises inflicted have
j been extremely small, according to
| Harry Maloney.
