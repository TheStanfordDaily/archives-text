# Frosh Hoopmen Beat Paly Hi In Ragged Game
## Last Minute Rally Savs Lee-men From Disgraceful Defeat 
### 
Decidedly off form, the Farm's
l'rosh basket bailers were neverthe
less strong enough to mesh enough
points in the last five minutes to whip
Palo Alto High School, 28-22,
j night.
With no games scheduled for this
j week-end, Coach H. B. "Beeb" Lee
i will have this afternoon and Friday
|to work a little l aggedness off the
| yearlings before going up against
| San Mateo Jaysee next Monday and
j Santa Rosa Jaysee a week from to
morrow.
The Papooses' decision last night
! was something on the order of last
Saturday's tilt with Commerce High
! School when they took a close deci
sion and could only hit the basket
when the chips were down.
Paly's eagers tied the count, 20-20,
with five minutes to go, and from
there the yearlings found the range
| for enough points to ice the game.
i After leading 15-8 at half-time, the
I Papooses were held scoreless until
Paly came up within two points and
then managed to stay out in front
I by some sort of luck until the high
J school quintet knotted the score.
Bob Penn was high point man with
13 digits on five field goals and three
foul shots. Bill Cowden, Dick Ray,
and Ollie Hamlin couldn't hit their
hats as they sank three points each.
| However, numerous set shots from
! the guards out deep into the hole
were missed, which if they had
j clicked would have given the frosh
j a more impressive victory.
| Guarding and ball-hawking by the
; yearlings under the basket forced
; the prepsters to make most of their
' points from 10 or more feet out.
Passing had the freshmen in trouble
j most of the evening when the in
-1 vaders would break through to stop
offensive thrusts.
