The intramural scoring record
seems to bo changing hands as fast
a,s a plug nickel, for last night it
moved up three points and into the
hands of A.T.O. I. The unlucky vic
tims were El Capitan's hoopsters
who were crushed 107-8.
Bob Koch was the big gun in lust
evening's successful attack on the
record, scoring enough for five men
in an average game, 37. Close on his
heels was his running mate at for
ward, Kai Larson, who gathered 32.
The former record holders were
Zete 11, which was in possession for
only six days, and when these two
high-(lying teams tangle, watch out
for fireworks.
Encina 3E, strongest freshman
team, finally came through to vic
tory, downing an Independent 11
quintet 25-22. Vern Judy sparked
the winners with 8 digits in an even
fought tilt. However, high man was
Fran Fenton, Independent guard,
with 12 markers.
