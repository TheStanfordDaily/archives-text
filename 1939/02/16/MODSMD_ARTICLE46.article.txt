# Add Re Thornhill
## 
### 
IT appears that a further explanation oi yes
terday's editorial on the circumstances sur
rounding the reappointment of Tiny Thornhill
is needed.
As a starting point, it would be well to point
out the position of the President of the Uni
versity in relation to the Board of Athletic
Control.
The B.A.C. is in the position of an advisory
agency—its actions, no matter with what con
cerned, are subject to his approval and none
of its recommendations can go into effect with
out that approval. It is with this in mind that
the question in regard to the advisability of
the Board's action last Saturday was raised.
At the same time, it is necessary to point out
that the administrative staff of the Board is a
unit distinct from the policy-forming group
which voted the compromise.
As a second matter for further explanation
is who actually are members of the small
group of "active" alumni concerned.
To determine the actual roster of this group
is impossible. Pressure groups operate in an
indeterminable way. To expose the names of
alumni falsely as participants in a situation
such as this, is a responsibility The Daily can
not assume—nor can anyone assume.
It can be said, however, that alumni who are
supporting the athletics of this University are
most certainly overstepping the bounds of their
position when they assume the right to dictate
the policy of Stanford.
In the instance at hand, they have not only
assumed that right; they have exercised it.
And that situation must be corrected.
Specific allegations, unsupported except by
opinion, will do no good in the process of cor
rection. To make any such assertions would
be to give way to a sensationalism that will
hurt any progress toward that correction that
may be made.
If it becomcs necessary, however, to name
names, to specify dates, to describe places, it
is possible to do so.
An outline of the general picture, supported
as it is by innumerable instances and by the
evidences which were apparent in the Board
meeting, should be sufficient and of enough
strength to remedy the situation.
That it is a vicious one needs no particular
reiteration.
Possibly further explanation of why this
group was placed in the position of being able
to put its dictum across is needed.
It is well known that financial support is ex
tended athletes for their education. When it
was threatened that that support would be
withdrawn if Tiny was reappointed on any basis
other than his indefinite term, the result was
passage of the recommendation under discus
sion.
The students who voted against passage felt
that other alumni would be willing to fill the
gap left by such withdrawal and that action
without the type of support demanded by the
"actives" is preferable to action with that sup
port.
Which is correct, and it is obvious that the
rest of the student body, the rest of the Univer
sity feels the same way.
And probably the best way for the University
to obtain what it wants is either to demand
that these alumni release their "claims to pol
icy," or remain under no further obligation to
them, at the same time removing the cloud of
suspicious secrecy which traditionally has over
hung the activities of the Board of Athletic
Control.

To determine the actual roster of this group
is impossible. Pressure groups operate in an
indeterminable way. To expose the names of
alumni falsely as participants in a situation
such as this, is a responsibility The Daily can
not assume—nor can anyone assume.
It can be said, however, that alumni who are
supporting the athletics of this University are
most certainly overstepping the bounds of their
position when they assume the right to dictate
the policy of Stanford.
In the instance at hand, they have not only
assumed that right; they have exercised it.
And that situation must be corrected.
Specific allegations, unsupported except by
opinion, will do no good in the process of cor
rection. To make any such assertions would
be to give way to a sensationalism that will
hurt any progress toward that correction that
may be made.
If it becomcs necessary, however, to name
names, to specify dates, to describe places, it
is possible to do so.
An outline of the general picture, supported
as it is by innumerable instances and by the
evidences which were apparent in the Board
meeting, should be sufficient and of enough
strength to remedy the situation.
That it is a vicious one needs no particular
reiteration.
Possibly further explanation of why this
group was placed in the position of being able
to put its dictum across is needed.
It is well known that financial support is ex
tended athletes for their education. When it
was threatened that that support would be
withdrawn if Tiny was reappointed on any basis
other than his indefinite term, the result was
passage of the recommendation under discus
sion.
The students who voted against passage felt
that other alumni would be willing to fill the
gap left by such withdrawal and that action
without the type of support demanded by the
"actives" is preferable to action with that sup
port.
Which is correct, and it is obvious that the
rest of the student body, the rest of the Univer
sity feels the same way.
And probably the best way for the University
to obtain what it wants is either to demand
that these alumni release their "claims to pol
icy," or remain under no further obligation to
them, at the same time removing the cloud of
suspicious secrecy which traditionally has over
hung the activities of the Board of Athletic
Control.
IT appears that a further explanation oi yes
terday's editorial on the circumstances sur
rounding the reappointment of Tiny Thornhill
is needed.
As a starting point, it would be well to point
out the position of the President of the Uni
versity in relation to the Board of Athletic
Control.
The B.A.C. is in the position of an advisory
agency—its actions, no matter with what con
cerned, are subject to his approval and none
of its recommendations can go into effect with
out that approval. It is with this in mind that
the question in regard to the advisability of
the Board's action last Saturday was raised.
At the same time, it is necessary to point out
that the administrative staff of the Board is a
unit distinct from the policy-forming group
which voted the compromise.
As a second matter for further explanation
is who actually are members of the small
group of "active" alumni concerned.
