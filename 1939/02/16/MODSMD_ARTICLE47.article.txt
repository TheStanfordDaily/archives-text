# The 						Quality of Mercy

### 
PROGRESSIVE education at Stanford took a
quick little step forward yesterday when
the School of Social Sciences took action to
prevent scheduling of two mid-quarter exami
nations in one day.
The idea is such a good one, it is a surprise
someone didn't think of it years ago. Particu
larly is it a good plan for Stanford, where stu
dent contact with the professor is largely the
responsibility of the student.
But there's always the mid-quarter and the
final to consider. As each quarter progresses
and first one, then the other comes closer and
closer, the student begins to crack the books
and winds up in a super-strenuous boning ses
sion the night before the ex.
And on days when two exams gang up on
the poor unsuspecting student he suddenly be
comes a case for the Rest Home.

Application of an examination schedule was
aimed at preventing congestions like this. It is
a humanitarian act, and should be continued as
long as examinations are made the chief mo
tive for study.
Credit for the scheme should go mostly to
Professor Payson J. Treat, who listened to the
complaints of his students when they had more
than one ex per day. It was Professor Treat
who suggested the idea to the School of Social
Sciences' executive committee.
Ironic sidelight is that it also is Professor
Treat who has scheduled an examination today
(Thursday) in his 9 o'clock course, which should
have examinations only on Mondays and Fri
days, according to the schedule.—R. D.
