# BULL SESSION
## CLOSED HARMONY 
### JOHN COBBS 
COMMITTEE swallowed hard last Tuesday night
J when the manager of (he Glee Club rose up out
of the shadows in the back of the room and requested
a closed date for the spring quarter concert. If the
prodigal son had come home broke and instead of
begging forgiveness had demanded a Packard road
ster, his father would have felt very much as the
Committee did.
One or two of the younger members murmured,
"What. Glee Club?" And several of the old ones eyed
the manager as though they were seeing for the first
time a specimen of what they had always thought a
mythical creature.

The manager explained that the Glee Club wanted
to fortify itself behind a closed date because it feared
competition from other events. The club, he said,
plans a concert followed by a dance on the stage of
Memorial Hall. Its motto—"Bring your girl along for
a bit of culture and then dance afterward." There was
a brief flurry of argument, and then Ex Committee de
cided that even the double-barreled inducement of
culture and dancing wasn't enough to justify closing
a spring quarter Friday night to other events.
Excom's decision will cause a certain amount of
howling, of course; and all of it won't come from the
Glee Club's trained lungs. Anything "cultural" will
always find its militant supporters, and in this case
the A.S.S.U. has a stake in the club's success because
of its $400 subsidy. But a check-up on the arguments
should provide an effective muzzle for the howlers.

P VEN this far ahead we can see that spring quarter
is going to be a reasonably exact facsimile of a
giddy whirl. The scheduled assortment of dances,
drives, and celebrations would be enough to keep us
entertained the full year if spread out. To close a
week-end for the Glee Club in the face of this demand
for time is contrary to all the laws of economics.
Moreover, the club has never done anything to
make itself rate a closed date. Most of the students
who know that it exists think of it as the ne'er-do
well of the A.S.S.U. family. To give it a closed date
would be a brand of equalitarianism too virulent even
for our sympathetic natures. If the club can't draw
an audience through its own magnetism, elementary
economics says that there is no justification for forcing
it down the students' throats.

And what applies to the Glee Club is equally true
for other minor organizations. Every time a date is
closed, it. means that functions pile up on other week
ends. The philosophy behind the closed date system
is that there are certain occasions which will attract
the whole campus. These are the only ones that can
be given a monopoly on an evening without shoving
entertainment at us on an "or else" basis.
The minor organizations may not like it, but if
they can't draw a crowd by themselves they have no
justification for getting themselves legislated into
success.
