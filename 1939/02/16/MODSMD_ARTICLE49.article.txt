Over at Roblc the other night, I hear, some of the
girls were talking about going down South spring
vacation.
"What's it like down South?" one of the girls
asked the rest.
"Haven't you ever been South?" they asked her.
"Well, as far south as L'Omelette," she answered.

You may remember the story that got in this col
umn Monday about the Roble girl who has all of her
dates censored by her brother and three of his foot
ball-playing friends, and how they were holding a
meeting to decide their stand on her current boy
friend.
I notice from the paper that today he is in the
Rest Home.
He could have a cold, I suppose.

Coming out of the blue on a latc-at-night record
program the other evening, this dedication was rather
startling. The dedication was to:
"Little Begonia, the potted plant."
And I've noticed lately that the word "allergic" is
being rather badly man-handled.
On one radio program some guy was playing a
noisy accordion, and when he finished the announcer
said very, very sweetly, "I guess I'm allergic to ac
cordions*. I could listen to you play all night."
Although neither the announcer nor the accordion
ist realized it, the announcer could not. have found a
more subtle way of saying, "You know, no one could
possibly tell you were playing the accordion."
And then there is the by-now classic example that
appeared in the Chronicle last. Sunday in the story of
the Stanford-Cal basketball game where the importer
said, "Stanford never did become allergic to the
bucket."
Yes, Cal just couldn't stop Stanford from scoring
that night.
HOW NICE
To speak of the past for a minute, I did get one
Valentine Tuesday.
tl wasn't a very nice Valentine. It was a little
confusing. It may have had sentiment, but it cer
tainly wasn't a tender sentiment.
And it was awfully anonymous.

It's a little late to print this item. Someone left
the information in my box over a month ago, but I
just, found it.
My informant writes that one of the frosh basket
ball players broke an old record when he went
through all last fall quarter on 95 cents worth of
laundry and cleaning.
I would like to know how many room-mates he
has by now.

ball players broke an old record when he went
through all last fall quarter on 95 cents worth of
laundry and cleaning.
I would like to know how many room-mates he
has by now.

Over at Roblc the other night, I hear, some of the
girls were talking about going down South spring
vacation.
"What's it like down South?" one of the girls
asked the rest.
"Haven't you ever been South?" they asked her.
"Well, as far south as L'Omelette," she answered.

You may remember the story that got in this col
umn Monday about the Roble girl who has all of her
dates censored by her brother and three of his foot
ball-playing friends, and how they were holding a
meeting to decide their stand on her current boy
friend.
I notice from the paper that today he is in the
Rest Home.
He could have a cold, I suppose.

Coming out of the blue on a latc-at-night record
program the other evening, this dedication was rather
startling. The dedication was to:
"Little Begonia, the potted plant."
And I've noticed lately that the word "allergic" is
being rather badly man-handled.
On one radio program some guy was playing a
noisy accordion, and when he finished the announcer
said very, very sweetly, "I guess I'm allergic to ac
cordions*. I could listen to you play all night."
Although neither the announcer nor the accordion
ist realized it, the announcer could not. have found a
more subtle way of saying, "You know, no one could
possibly tell you were playing the accordion."
And then there is the by-now classic example that
appeared in the Chronicle last. Sunday in the story of
the Stanford-Cal basketball game where the importer
said, "Stanford never did become allergic to the
bucket."
Yes, Cal just couldn't stop Stanford from scoring
that night.
HOW NICE
To speak of the past for a minute, I did get one
Valentine Tuesday.
tl wasn't a very nice Valentine. It was a little
confusing. It may have had sentiment, but it cer
tainly wasn't a tender sentiment.
And it was awfully anonymous.
