# F.D.R. Third Term Will Be Argued Tonight
## Election of Officers, Discussion of Rules Will Follow Debate 
### 
Debating the question, "Resolved,
that members of this house request
President Roosevelt to run for a
third term," the Stanford Political
Union will be called to order this
evening for the last time by retiring
President Vincent Lcmmon in the
auditorium of the Education Build
ing at 7:30 o'clock.
In addition to the regular discus
sion, the five elective offices to serve
during the rest of the year will be
chosen, and the new constitution,
recently approved by the Standing
Committee, will be placed on the
floor for general consideration.
PARTIES SET FOR ELECTION
Anticipating the semi-annual elec
tion, party heads have requested all
members to be present in the Me
morial Hall at 7 o'clock to make
final adjustments in their lists of
candidates.
In discussing a topic of national
interest the Union goes back to its
traditional policy, which was lifted
at the last meeting in order to de
bate the pros and cons of the then
heated sorority question. Conserva
tive, Liberal, and Labor distinctions
which were also eliminated at the
time will be adhered to, and re
ports indicate that a Liberal-Con
servative coalition may succeed in
downing the house measure.
RULES TO BE DISCUSSED
With elections and discussion of
the new house rules, which have
been pending for several weeks, to
night's session will be the most im
portant held so far this year. Presi- ;
dent Lemmon, Vice-president Gene '
Glasmann, Secretary Sherm Mel
inkoff, Treasurer Bill Todd, and Ser
geant-at-arms John Eaton who
have guided the Union's activities
since September, will step out of
office at the close of the debate in
favor of those who will lead the or
ganization through its next year of
campus activity.
Although prevented at the start
from introducing outside speakers,
the Political Union has not been se
riously handicapped by the admin
istration's ruling, and no radical
changes have been made in the
methods of debate or general policy
since the first meeting last spring
quarter.
