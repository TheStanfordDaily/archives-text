# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the Campus Opinion column
of the February 13th issue of The
Stanford Daily there appeared a
letter noting the Stanford Book
store's surplus of $85,049.12 as of
August 31, 1938, and implying that
this surplus might possibly be used
for laboratory equipment and stu
dent scholarships.
For the benefit of "Curious" and
those unacquainted with accounting
terminology, it may be pointed out
that the surplus mentioned does not
represent 85 thousand dollars of
cash and securities in the bank, but
is merely the excess of total assets
of the store over its debts. These
assets are chiefly represented by
the building and its equipment, the
books and various other merchan
dise.
The Bookstore started in 1897 as
an incorporated co-operative asso
ciation organized by members of
the University faculty at the sug
gestion of Dr. Jordan. It started
with $500 of borrowed funds and
over a period of 42 years, by careful
management, has saved a portion of
its profits each year which have
been invested in the equipment,
books, and all forms of merchandise
found in the Bookstore today. More
than $25,000 of this so-called sur
plus is in building and fixtures.
Along with this gradual accumu
lation of funds there has been the i
policy of returning to the Univer
sity community each year a large
portion of the earnings. In 1936-37,
out of profits of $9,613.13, $6,000 was
given to the Commission for Student
Aid; and in 1937-38, out of $9,263.29
profits, an additional $6,000 was
turned over to this cause. The re
maining profits in each case have
been permitted to remain in the
business in order that the store may |
render an increasing service to the
campus community.
