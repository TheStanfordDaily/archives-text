# Program Reviews Symphony, Swing

Tossing together such varied num
bers as Haydn's Symphony No. 102,
in B flat, and the all-star band's The
'Blues, this week's regular Dcpart
-1 mcnt of Music record program
j brought Farm listeners chamber
j music, symphony, opera, and swing,
j Following the Haydn symphony,
which opened the program, Good
j man, Berrigan, Tommy Dorscy, B.
Haggart, Ray Baudue, Jack Tea
garden, and an all-star crew moved
through with The Blues (Victor
! 20144). Getting away to a lazy, slow
start, the record quickens pace when
j Berrigan, and later Goodman, solo.
i The wind-up is abrupt, but the gen
' eral impression is relaxed, easy.
I Blue Lou, on the other side, is a
j faster, more solid piece of grooving,
I but definitely more commercial,
j Goodman rides well, but Dorscy
■ sounds a little ragged. Baudue pro
vides a smooth drum background.
A change in theme late in the record
j is confusing.
Roy Harris' Chorale for String
| Sextette came next on the list of
selections. A high, varying melody
that gives way to rich string inter-
J prctation makes the record notable.
Completing the selections were the
overture to Wagner's Tannhauser,
I his Venusberg music, and prelude to
I Act lll.—Hutchinson.
