### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
years ago a young En
k glishman wrote a novel pf du
bious literary merit about an imag
inary land called Shangri-La. In a
protected valley high in the Hima
layas, an old priest built a secret
city in order to save the world's
great art from destruction in the
next war.
Tlie idea that a major conflict
might destroy a large proportion of
man's artistic achievements is far
from fantastic. German bombs ru
ined Rheims* magnificent cathcdral
and reduced the Gothic city of
Ypres to dust in the last war. Doz
ens of beautiful castles and churches
h;ive disappeared since the start of
the Spanish struggle.
♦ * *
'INHERE is more than life to be
lost in war.
Little wonder that the jewel
like stained glass windows of
Chartres were quickly removed
from their frames during the
Munich Crisis and stored in un
derground vaults. Today in Paris
bomb-proof cellars below the
Louvre arc being prepared to re
ceive the French government's
priceless collection of art, in ease
the Maginot Line proves ineffec
tive.
The masterpieces of El Greco, Ve
lasquez, and Goya, along with the
works of dozens of other painters,
were removed from the museums of
the Prado and the Escorial in Spain
after the start of the Civil War, and
have since been floating mysterious
ly around the capitals of Europe.
After months, during some of which
the Republican authorities them
selves did not know where they
were, the invaluable collection turn
ed up this week in Geneva. There
it will be stored in the Palace of
the League of Nations in relative
safety.
* # #
r JTIE effect that a few well-aimed
bombs could have on the wealth
of fine art concentrated in Flor
ence may seem unimportant in
comparison with the loss of life that
would result. That is, perhaps, to
day's truth. But when the Peace of
Munich is forgotten and the Treaty
of Versailles a vague myth in his
tory, men may still be thrilled by
the sculpture of Michelangelo and
the canvases of Boticelli and Titian.

IN a swift flight from aesthetics
to news facts, we find that in
Washington the story behind the
United States' sale of planes to
France is gradually coming to
light. Publication of the testimony
>»f Secretary of the Treasury Mor
genthau before the Senate Military
Affairs Committee concerning the
deal, reveals certain facts which
will please neither U.S. isolation
ists nor the dictators of Europe.
Although General Malin Craig,
Army chief of staff, opposed the
sale, President Roosevelt issued or
ders that the Treasury Department
ease the way for the French plane
purchase. Thus the testimony of
Mr. Morgenthau. Army heads op
posed the plan because they feared
it would interfere with our national
defense program by completely de
priving the United States of the use
of the type of plane sold.
* 4'
INTERPRETATIONS of this story
in the Nazi press are easily imag
ined. Its effect on Senator Hiram
Johnson's blood pressure is obvious.
But more important than these is
the chance that disagreement be
tween our military department and
the men who determine our foreign
policy may lead to friction at a
time when co-operation Is a neces
sity.
Of course. Franklin I). Roosc
felt is commander-in-chief of the
Army and Navy, but an unfriend
ly army stalT would be inconve
nient in case of one of the emer
gencies we hear so much about.

|>ELATIONS between Japan and
Russia have been in the smol
dering stage for some weeks now.
Yesterday saw the first flames ap
pear on the east coast of Siberia,
where the Nipponese government, is
demanding a renewal of fishing
rights formerly granted by the
Soviet.
The issue itself is trivial, but re
ports have it that the Japanese have
instructed their ambassador at Mos
cow to seek a show-down. The
island empire has been looking
around for an excuse to attack Rus
sia, and if it follows up its threat
to arm its fishing boats unless the
rights are renewed, there may i)c
trouble/
That Japan's menacing the pow
er of Soviet Russia does not cx
acll\ displease Hitler and Musso
lini is obvious. An attack on the
Communist power from the cast
would be iust what the doctor or
dered.
V 1 EGOTIATIONS between General
Franco and Prime Minister
Chamberlain continued at full swing
yesterday. Britain's representative
at. Burgos offered to exchange his
country's recognition and financial
support for an immediate truce be
tween the Insurgents and Loyalists.
As yet Franco has refused to
make peace with the practically de
feated Republican forces, which
have declared their intention to con
tinue resistance until the Rebels
guarantee them amnesty.

IN a swift flight from aesthetics
to news facts, we find that in
Washington the story behind the
United States' sale of planes to
France is gradually coming to
light. Publication of the testimony
>»f Secretary of the Treasury Mor
genthau before the Senate Military
Affairs Committee concerning the
deal, reveals certain facts which
will please neither U.S. isolation
ists nor the dictators of Europe.
Although General Malin Craig,
Army chief of staff, opposed the
sale, President Roosevelt issued or
ders that the Treasury Department
ease the way for the French plane
purchase. Thus the testimony of
Mr. Morgenthau. Army heads op
posed the plan because they feared
it would interfere with our national
defense program by completely de
priving the United States of the use
of the type of plane sold.

INTERPRETATIONS of this story
in the Nazi press are easily imag

the chance that disagreement be

policy may lead to friction at a
time when co-operation Is a neces
