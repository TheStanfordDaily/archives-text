# S.P.U. Holds Year's Most Active Meet
## Moskovics Defeats Liberal Disenroth In Presidency Race 
### 
Rejecting the proposition that
President Roosevelt be requested to
run for a third term, electing a mem
ber of the Conservative party to
succeed Vincent Lcmmon as presi
dent, and accepting unanimously the
new constitution, members of the
Stanford Political Union held their
most active meeting of the year last
night in the Education Building.
John Moskovies, one of the lead
ing members of the Conservative
party since its inauguration last year,
defeated Carl Diesenroth, leader of
the Liberal party, in the race for
president after a close vote in which
Laborites were divided between the
two candidates.
Moskovies will be the first Con
servative to act as head of the Union,
his predecessors being both mem
bers of the fence-straddling Liberal
party.
OTHER OFFICERS
Chosen to complete the list of offi
cers to serve frr the remainder of the
year were: Bob Wood (Labor), vice
president; Mary Maud Mitchell
(Liberal), secretary; Dan Hays (Lib
eral), treasurer; and Fran Du√üois
(Labor), sergeant-at -arms.
Before considering the advisabil
ity of running Roosevelt for another
term, the new constitution of the
Union was presented in the form of
an amendment to the old document,
and after considerable discussion on
the floor of the house, was unani
mously approved.
Vincent Lemmon, retiring presi
dent of the Union, then called for
the question before the house, and
after a heated debate, any possibility
of having Roosevelt on the presiden
tial aicket in 15)40 was rejected by a
vote of 32-22.
The Conservatives led by Tim Hays
and Moskovies stood firm in oppos
ing the measure, while a large ma
jority of the Labor party, and a
minority of the Liberals led by Bob
Curtis and Oyiver Wyman, upheld
the proposition in an effort to carry
the floor.
VIEWS PRESENTED
Supported by George Alsbcrg from
the Labor bench, the leftist faction,
however, was unable to stop the
swing away from the administration
maneuvered by John Eaton and
Gene Glasmann, leader of the re
volting Labor minority.
Basis of the affirmative argument
was that the ultimate success of the
president's economic and social re
forms depended on his being given
a third term in the White House, and
that in the present state of national
affairs he was the only man genu
inely suited for the post of Chief
Executive.
Countering these views, the Con
servatives stressed the fact that in a
democracy no one man should be al
lowed to hold the top post through
three terms. It was branded as be
ing a distinct danger to liberal prin
ciples, tending toward dangerous
centralizing of governing powers.
