# Chlorine Gas Floods Chemistry Lab
## Fumes from Defective Valve Gas Two Students; Oxygen Administered Senior Checks Dangerous Spread Through Use of Faulty Gas-mask; Odors Halt Nearby Laboratories J 
### 
Escaping gas flooded the first floor of the Chemistry Building late yes
terday afternoon and necessitated the administering of oxygen to two re
search students.
Bob Lind and Richard Newhall received oxygen treatments as n result
of the chlorine gas which escaped from a defective cylinder in Room 17
about :> o'clock. Neither inhaled sufficient quantities of the gas to he seri-

ously affected, but both will suffer
from inflamed lungs.
Lind, assistant in the Chem de
partment, was adjusting a cylinder
of chlorine gas for an experiment
when a defective valve caused the
gas to spurt out. The thick, pungent
fumes "spread rapidly throughout the
laboratory and into the halls of the
first floor.
Choked by the chlorine and un
able to close the valve, the four
workers ran from the room. New
hall, a senior, obtained a gas mask,
which did not protect him as it was
too large, and dashed into the room.
He finally managed to stop the flow
of gas.
Aided by Stanford firemen, ammo
nia was sprinkled on the floors to
neutralize the chlorine. The fumes
did not readily subside, and all work
in the block of research laboratories
on the first floor was halted.
Other workers in the laboratory
who did not require treatment were
Guy Harris, graduate; Glenn Welde,
junior; and Henry Rod da, senior.
Chlorine is one of the most danger
ous of gases that is shipped in cylin
ders. The danger of chlorine is
shown by the fact that it is used in
preparing war gas.
The accident was attributed to a
leaking, corroded valve on the cyl
inder, which is owned by the Chem
istry Department and is used for
transporting gasses from the factory.
Dr. Francis H. Berg, associate pro
fessor in the Chemistry Department,
stated that it. was fortunate that
chlorine escaped instead of a more
' dangerous, odorless gas which would
have caused more serious effects.
"The cylinder was evidently old, and
it was unfortunte that the Depart
ment's one gas mask would not
work."
When questioned about the gas
mask, Mr. Walter Bruce, curator of
the Chemistry Department, ex
plained, "Gas masks are made for
individual faces. They will fit some
people, while on others they will not.
It would be difficult to use gas masks
for general protection against gas
in the laboratories, unless everyone
were fitted for masks. Naturally,
this would be impossible to do."

Choked by the chlorine and un
able to close the valve, the four
workers ran from the room. New
hall, a senior, obtained a gas mask,
which did not protect him as it was
too large, and dashed into the room.
He finally managed to stop the flow
of gas.
Aided by Stanford firemen, ammo
nia was sprinkled on the floors to
neutralize the chlorine. The fumes
did not readily subside, and all work
in the block of research laboratories
on the first floor was halted.
Other workers in the laboratory
who did not require treatment were
Guy Harris, graduate; Glenn Welde,
junior; and Henry Rod da, senior.
Chlorine is one of the most danger
ous of gases that is shipped in cylin
ders. The danger of chlorine is
shown by the fact that it is used in
preparing war gas.
The accident was attributed to a
leaking, corroded valve on the cyl
inder, which is owned by the Chem
istry Department and is used for
transporting gasses from the factory.
Dr. Francis H. Berg, associate pro
fessor in the Chemistry Department,
stated that it. was fortunate that
chlorine escaped instead of a more
' dangerous, odorless gas which would
have caused more serious effects.
"The cylinder was evidently old, and
it was unfortunte that the Depart
ment's one gas mask would not
work."
When questioned about the gas
mask, Mr. Walter Bruce, curator of
the Chemistry Department, ex
plained, "Gas masks are made for
individual faces. They will fit some
people, while on others they will not.
It would be difficult to use gas masks
for general protection against gas
in the laboratories, unless everyone
were fitted for masks. Naturally,
this would be impossible to do."
Escaping gas flooded the first floor of the Chemistry Building late yes
terday afternoon and necessitated the administering of oxygen to two re
search students.
Bob Lind and Richard Newhall received oxygen treatments as n result
of the chlorine gas which escaped from a defective cylinder in Room 17
about :> o'clock. Neither inhaled sufficient quantities of the gas to he seri-

ously affected, but both will suffer
from inflamed lungs.
Lind, assistant in the Chem de
partment, was adjusting a cylinder
of chlorine gas for an experiment
when a defective valve caused the
gas to spurt out. The thick, pungent
fumes "spread rapidly throughout the
laboratory and into the halls of the
first floor.
