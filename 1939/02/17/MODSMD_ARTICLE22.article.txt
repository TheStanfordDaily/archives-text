# Stanford Chaplain Writes Of England
## 
### 
"Stanford is a magic word, open
j ing all kinds of doors," writes D. El
ton Trueblood, chaplain of Stanford
| University and currently on a leave
: of absence taking him through the
; British Isles.
Busy with writing and research,
Dr. Trueblood took a brief respite
; to relate some of his observations
! while in the City of Birmingham,
! England.
The Farm chaplain expressed his
pride in the high esteem in which
Stanford is held in many parts of
| England. Its influence covers a wide
sphere, he found.
MAYOR KIND
i Accompanied by one of Birming
| ham's leading alderman, Dr. True
: blod was fortunate in making the
' acquaintance of the Lord Mayor, a
I "graciously kind" individual, who
j "wore a magnificent gold symbol of
| office, suspended on a ribbon about
I his, neck." This man, writes Dr.
; Trueblood, is a striking combina-
I tion in that he is a "labor" Lord
Mayor, having risen through the
! ranks of the trade unions.
Visiting the city's Municipal Bank,
organized by Neville Chamberlain,
j England's present Prime Minister,
Trueblood found it to be rendering
a unique service. No checking ac-
I counts were made, all transactions
j being made on a deposit and with
; drawn] basis.
The reason for this, he explained,
j is the fact that each check in Eng
! land must bear a two-penny stamp,
1 making it impossible for the poorer

class to use checks. The bank also
operates in the double capacity of a
building and loan society.
The Chamberlain influence, in
cluding that of Joseph and his two
famous sons, permeates throughout
the city, Dr. Trueblood found. Much
to his surprise, however, a great
many of the people were violently
opposed to Neville Chamberlain's
foreign policy as Prime Minister.

"Something of the British genius
in management became apparent" to
Dr. Trueblood, after seeing the inner
workings of this great city of over
a million inhabitants. "The ways of
these people seem slow to us," his
letter ended, "but somehow they get
along . . . without graft and with a
splendid tradition for public serv
ice."

"Something of the British genius
in management became apparent" to
Dr. Trueblood, after seeing the inner
workings of this great city of over
a million inhabitants. "The ways of
these people seem slow to us," his
letter ended, "but somehow they get
along . . . without graft and with a
splendid tradition for public serv
ice."
"Stanford is a magic word, open
j ing all kinds of doors," writes D. El
ton Trueblood, chaplain of Stanford
| University and currently on a leave
: of absence taking him through the
; British Isles.
Busy with writing and research,
Dr. Trueblood took a brief respite
; to relate some of his observations
! while in the City of Birmingham,
! England.
The Farm chaplain expressed his
pride in the high esteem in which
Stanford is held in many parts of
| England. Its influence covers a wide
sphere, he found.
MAYOR KIND
i Accompanied by one of Birming
| ham's leading alderman, Dr. True
: blod was fortunate in making the
' acquaintance of the Lord Mayor, a
I "graciously kind" individual, who
j "wore a magnificent gold symbol of
| office, suspended on a ribbon about
I his, neck." This man, writes Dr.
; Trueblood, is a striking combina-
I tion in that he is a "labor" Lord
Mayor, having risen through the
! ranks of the trade unions.
Visiting the city's Municipal Bank,
organized by Neville Chamberlain,
j England's present Prime Minister,
Trueblood found it to be rendering
a unique service. No checking ac-
I counts were made, all transactions
j being made on a deposit and with
; drawn] basis.
The reason for this, he explained,
j is the fact that each check in Eng
! land must bear a two-penny stamp,
1 making it impossible for the poorer

class to use checks. The bank also
operates in the double capacity of a
building and loan society.
The Chamberlain influence, in
cluding that of Joseph and his two
famous sons, permeates throughout
the city, Dr. Trueblood found. Much
to his surprise, however, a great
many of the people were violently
opposed to Neville Chamberlain's
foreign policy as Prime Minister.
