THIS isn't exactly sports, but the i
news has finally wended its way to i
us that Sally Rand, who can do i
more tricks with a balloon than |
Hank Luisetti could do with a bas
ketball, is a devout Kappa of the
old school. The next thing they will
be discovering will be that Man
Mountain Dean and Bronko Nagur
ski are Phi Beta Kappas from Si
wash Tech.
The only real reason for starting j
out with that little quip was, as !
you must have suspected, to get our
minds off the Board of Athletic 1
Control until next week. Even An- 1
gell Field and the three-year con
tract have to wait when the boys
start talking about bubble dancers. ;

ANOTHER ONE of those large !
athletic week-ends in which the
spectators get a worse work-out than
the participants, is upon us. When
the athletes finish their little chore,
they can go home and rest but the
rest of us good suckers are going ;
from 10 o'clock in the morn until j
11 o'clock at night trying to go plus ;
in applied athletics 131.
The fire-works begin at 3:15
o'clock this afternoon and won't end
until Johnny Ward finishes wreak- j
ing havoc on the dome of U.C.L.A.'s j
Hanson Saturday near the stroke of
11. If our predictions run true, by
that time Stanford should have won j
all of their encounters with the pos- j
sible exception of one away-from
home basketball game and a ques
tionable tennis match with the I
strong California Tennis Club.

THE FASTEST entertainment? i
That depends upon the type of gore !
which is most pleasing to your nerve I
centers. Probably the wisest mix- j
ture for the ordinary frame would i
be a conglomeration of them all. I
Take a small potion of frosh base- !
ball this afternoon for a starter and
then go to bed early for the big
Saturday doings.
Of course, if you're not pacifists,
like we are, you might get in on
the track meet which is the Mili
tary Ball tonight. It all depends on
the type of muscular activity which
you like best. We like something
quiet, like a gang-fight.
The real endurance run starts j
Saturday at 10 o'clock with the |
frosh-Salinas J. C. tennis matches. |
After that and a bit of brunch on 1
the fly, you can boo the umpires at j
a baseball game, be ready for the j
riots at the rugby match, or get the !
galloping jitters watching some of j
the best tennis artists hereabouts in j
action. If you really want to lose |
weight, try commuting between all ;
three of these contests.
Getting in a serious mood (no!)
again, the boxing and all-univer- ;
sity wrestling matches tomorrow i
night should really be classics, i
Clayton Frye has the best Stanford j
mittmen to hit the Farm in four '
years, and they deserve an over
flow house for the type of show
which they have been putting on
all season.

PARTING SHOTS: Sherm Wet
more, of the Oregon Ducks, swim
ming team, set a new Coast record
in the 150-yard backstroke yester
day. A good example of dry humor
—Stanford will beat U.S.C. tonight
and just miss duplicating tomor
row in Los Angeles, we hope.
