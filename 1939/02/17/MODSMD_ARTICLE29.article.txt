# Ruggermen Meet Bruins On Saturday
## Improved card Team Ready for Powerful Uclan Aggregation 
### 
Stanford ruggers will meet U. C.
L. A. in the stadium Saturday after
noon defeating U.S.C. at the Los
Angeles Coliseum last week.
The line-up of the Stanford rug
by team for the scramble will be as
follows: fullback, Captain Lyman
Calkins first five, Dean Johnson;
second five. Vic Musy; center three,
Jerry Sparling; right wing, Pete
Fay; left wing, Jim Grubbs; scrum
half, George Jedenoft or Wood Bo
hoskey; first rank scrum, Harold
Bernard, John We.st, Jake Thomp
son or Paul Ugrin; second rank
scrum, By West, Harold Hicking
botham; lock, Ned Pugh; break
away, Aubrey Austin, Bob Galletti;
substitutes, Jack Partridge, Carl Ger
lach, and Art Geissler.
U.C.L.A. has a team very similar
to U.S.C., according to coach Jim
'Wylie. They have the same type of
forwards as U.S.C., big heavy men
from the regular football line-up,
and are expected to give the Stan
ford ruggers a good stiff fight from
all angles.
The Stanford forwards on the
other hand have been improving of
late. They have been packing into
tighter scrums, tackling and drib
bling better. Added to this the
backfield is claimed by the coaches
to be faster than any of the teams
it has met so far. Adding these
facts together makes Stanford's
chances for besting U.C.LA. pretty
fair.
Prospects of a game with Har
vard on Treasure Island have been
stewing lately, according to Director
of Minor Sports Harry Maloney. Ar
rangements are being made with the
eastern team to come out for Stan
lord Day on April 8. If suitable dates
can be arranged, the Harvard team
will fly out to the Pacific Coast for
the match. On this same day Stan
ford will meet its traditional rival
for another exhibition match as well
as the University of British Colum
bia, and Canadian All-star teams.
The tilt with U.C.L.A., which will
be broadcast, will be held in the
Stanford stadium at 2 o'clock Sat
urday afternoon. Alex McDonald
will referee and Jack Brenner will
be head timer.

Stanford ruggers will meet U. C.
L. A. in the stadium Saturday after
noon defeating U.S.C. at the Los
Angeles Coliseum last week.
The line-up of the Stanford rug
by team for the scramble will be as
follows: fullback, Captain Lyman
Calkins first five, Dean Johnson;
second five. Vic Musy; center three,
Jerry Sparling; right wing, Pete
Fay; left wing, Jim Grubbs; scrum
half, George Jedenoft or Wood Bo
hoskey; first rank scrum, Harold
Bernard, John We.st, Jake Thomp
son or Paul Ugrin; second rank
scrum, By West, Harold Hicking
botham; lock, Ned Pugh; break
away, Aubrey Austin, Bob Galletti;
substitutes, Jack Partridge, Carl Ger
lach, and Art Geissler.
U.C.L.A. has a team very similar
to U.S.C., according to coach Jim
'Wylie. They have the same type of
forwards as U.S.C., big heavy men
from the regular football line-up,
and are expected to give the Stan
ford ruggers a good stiff fight from
all angles.
The Stanford forwards on the
other hand have been improving of
late. They have been packing into
tighter scrums, tackling and drib
bling better. Added to this the
backfield is claimed by the coaches
to be faster than any of the teams
it has met so far. Adding these
facts together makes Stanford's
chances for besting U.C.LA. pretty
fair.
Prospects of a game with Har
vard on Treasure Island have been
stewing lately, according to Director
of Minor Sports Harry Maloney. Ar
rangements are being made with the
eastern team to come out for Stan
lord Day on April 8. If suitable dates
can be arranged, the Harvard team
will fly out to the Pacific Coast for
the match. On this same day Stan
ford will meet its traditional rival
for another exhibition match as well
as the University of British Colum
bia, and Canadian All-star teams.
The tilt with U.C.L.A., which will
be broadcast, will be held in the
Stanford stadium at 2 o'clock Sat
urday afternoon. Alex McDonald
will referee and Jack Brenner will
be head timer.
