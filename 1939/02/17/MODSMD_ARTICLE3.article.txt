# Beard Or No Beard, Farm To See Fair

### JEAN NOWELL 
Stanford is going to the Fair!
A cross-section of the Farm's society-conscious citizenry will grace
the Golden Gate International Exposition in various types of costume and
states of mind, Saturday, on the gala opening day.
Punctuated by shouts of, "Hey, some gal from The Daily wants to
know . . . ." phone calls to the 24 Farm fraternities revealed representa-

tive Exposition plans of the cam-<
pus.
The Phi Psi's were interested.
"'What Fair?" they wondered. When
enlightened, they admitted that nine
sophomores would attend, "dressed
appropriately as sophomores." A
Founders' Day banquet at the Fair
will open festivities, and the house
will carry on from there.
LINES BUSY
The S.A.E.'s wondered too. Ques
tion: "Is it formal?" Answer: "No!
Half the group will be in costume,
the rest don't." None are growing
beards, " 'tain't possible!"
"Oh, most of us will go with the
band" — quote the A.K.L.'s. They
promise severe competition for the
Salvation Army music unit.
The line was busy at the Kappa
Sig and Phi Sig houses, and the
Delta Chi's didn't seem to have a
phone either. Seven or so will at
tend from the Sigma Chi's, two as
potential cowboys. (They claim
never to have seen a horsie.)
The D.U.'s, insisting they were
a spontaneous house, cryptically
claimed that "anything could hap
pen." The Betas, figuring that the
Fair is meant as a celebration, plan
on doing "just that."
A.T.O.'S TO DATE
The A.T.O.'s, en masse, will at
tend, with dates. They plan on be
ginning in the city "lor lunch, then
"deploying." (All are shaving.)
Fifteen K.A.'s will be there, in cos
tume. They won't be shaving.
Most of the Phi Delts are going.
Four will bo in costume, driving a
1914 Pierce-Arrow—'"one exposition
late!"
The remainder of the Row prom
ises to be there too. Some in cos
tume, some without.
El Campo, claiming to be repre
sentative of the Hall groups, esti
mate almost all of their members will
be there. "We won't be in costume
though. We don't believe in foolish
things."

Punctuated by shouts of, "Hey, some gal from The Daily wants to
know . . . ." phone calls to the 24 Farm fraternities revealed representa-

tive Exposition plans of the cam-<

The Phi Psi's were interested.
"'What Fair?" they wondered. When
enlightened, they admitted that nine
sophomores would attend, "dressed
appropriately as sophomores." A
Founders' Day banquet at the Fair
will open festivities, and the house
will carry on from there.
LINES BUSY
The S.A.E.'s wondered too. Ques
tion: "Is it formal?" Answer: "No!
Half the group will be in costume,
the rest don't." None are growing
beards, " 'tain't possible!"
"Oh, most of us will go with the
band" — quote the A.K.L.'s. They
promise severe competition for the
Salvation Army music unit.
The line was busy at the Kappa
Sig and Phi Sig houses, and the
Delta Chi's didn't seem to have a
phone either. Seven or so will at
tend from the Sigma Chi's, two as
potential cowboys. (They claim
never to have seen a horsie.)
The D.U.'s, insisting they were
a spontaneous house, cryptically
claimed that "anything could hap
pen." The Betas, figuring that the
Fair is meant as a celebration, plan
on doing "just that."
A.T.O.'S TO DATE
The A.T.O.'s, en masse, will at
tend, with dates. They plan on be
ginning in the city "lor lunch, then
"deploying." (All are shaving.)
Fifteen K.A.'s will be there, in cos
tume. They won't be shaving.
Most of the Phi Delts are going.
Four will bo in costume, driving a
1914 Pierce-Arrow—'"one exposition
late!"
The remainder of the Row prom
ises to be there too. Some in cos
tume, some without.
El Campo, claiming to be repre
sentative of the Hall groups, esti
mate almost all of their members will
be there. "We won't be in costume
though. We don't believe in foolish
things."
Stanford is going to the Fair!
A cross-section of the Farm's society-conscious citizenry will grace
the Golden Gate International Exposition in various types of costume and
states of mind, Saturday, on the gala opening day.
