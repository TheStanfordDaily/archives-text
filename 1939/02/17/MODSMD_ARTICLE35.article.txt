# Independent III Quintet Keeps Record Intact
## Hugh Ogilvie Leads Cagers to Easy Win Over Delta I Squad 
### 
Though they started slowly and i
scored few points, Independent Ill's j
casabamen kept untarnished their!
record of wins with a 20-9 victory j
over Dolt I. Weakened by an at
tack of measles, the Delt team was
ragged and couldn't hit its hat.
Hugh Ogilvie, Independent forward,
and Joe Ashcraft, Delt center, were
the main cogs of their respective
teams and tied for point honors with j
six digits each.
Larry Dee, star frosh netter, turn
ed his hand to basketball last night
and greatly aided his intramural
team from Encina 3E in trimming
El Toro 11, 32-13. Dee scored 12
markers and was ably helped by the
Judy brothers, Vein and Jim, who
tanked nine and six, respectively.
