The Cards enter this week-end's
series decided underdogs to the Tro
jans, who are battling to stay within
| close enough range of the Bears to
I make the California-S.C. series next
j week the crux battles of the 1939
| Conference season.
I Cal has lost one game and won five,
the Trojans have lost two and won
four. Thus if S.C. can trounce Stan
ford twice and then take two from
| the Bears they will be in the groove.
However, Dean worked his skull
| duggery in the season's opening game
i against the Trojans when the In-
I dians dropped their southern foes,
j 42-39, and if enough of the locals can
' hit a fair percentage of their shots
| Stanford may do no worse than
j break even. It is certain that the
Injuns don't have a chance if only
Captain Phil Zonne and Harlan Cop
sey get field goals as happened last
week against Cal.
The starting lineup will be Zonne
j and Copsey, forwards; Don Burness,
| center; and Dick Lyon and Kenny
i Davidson, guards. Also making the
