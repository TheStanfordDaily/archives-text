# Like a Thief

GREENISH-yellow wisps of chlorine, widely
used during the World War and in indus
trial warfare for poison gas attacks, spread
through a Stanford chemistry lab yesterday
afternoon, sending five students running from
the room. Two students nearly were asphyxi
ated, although prompt treatment at the Men's
Health Service quickly brought them around.
Poison gas, near-asphyxiation, emergency
oxygen treatment borders on the grisly. But
there's a joker—chlorine is not a poisonous
gas. Chief danger is that it takes the place of
oxygen in the lungs. Carbon dioxide can do
that much, yet it is so non-poisonous that we
drink it dissolved in Cellar cokes. It was not
pure chlorine that was used during the war,
but a mixture of gases which together were
poisonous.
When pure chlorine enters the lungs and
obstructs oxygen intake, all the doctor has to
do is dose the patient with oxygen, providing,
of course, he hasn't been without his oxygen
quota for too long a time.
Yesterday's accident now begins to seem
less significant. In reality, there was little
chance of a fatal or even serious accident.
All gases handled over in the Chemistry
Building aren't non-poisonous, however.
The confusion resulting from the accident
points to a serious inadequacy of safety pre
cautions. Only one gas mask was available,
and that one was too big—such a poor fit that
a faculty member was heard to remark, "That
gas mask would have worked fine if there had
been no gas."
First-aid equipment appeared inadequate in
the face of emergency. And, perhaps, the ac
tual gas cylinder was defective, since the tap
began leaking gas when a student was regulat
ing it.
The situation provides the chemistry and
other research departments with an ideal oc
casion to weigh themselves in the balance and
see what is wanting in the way of adequate
equipment and safety precautions.
Next time it might be mustard gas or its
equivalent.—R. D.
