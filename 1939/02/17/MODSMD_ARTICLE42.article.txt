# 10 o'clock Blues
## 
### 
THERE are some students who don't come to
Stanford just for the ride. Instead, they
spend their evenings studying in the Library
because the conversation of roommates and
the blare of radios drive them from their houses
and halls.
When the Library closes at 10 o'clock, these
serious students take refuge in the draughty,
ill-lighted rooms on the Quad to finish their
evening's work. During midquarters and finals
the Quad's after-10 population increases in
direct proportion to the number of exams being
given the next morning.
Late studying has its own code of etiquette.
An occupied classroom is a man's castle, and
Quad ethics protect him from any interruption.
Every evening, lights blaze from many rooms,
each of v/hich is occupied by one man working
at the professor's table or two engaged in a
bull session.
Since early this quarter, many of Stanford's
real students have been disturbed at finding a
gradually increasing number of rooms locked
at night. The best-lighted rooms are among
those which are being closed to the public.
This scholastic sabotage is the work of jani
tors under definite instructions from the Comp
troller's office. The orders are designed to
gradually eliminate the practice of studying on
the Quad.
With finances at their present low ebb, the
University simply cannot afford to supply stu
dents with electricity after 10 o'clock. The ex
pense of lighting dozens of large classrooms,
for the use of but one or two men each, makes
a sizable addition to the already high electric
bill.
It is doubtful whether the boring-from-within
process is the most desirable way to cut the
University's expenses.
If one or more well-lighted classrooms on
the Quad were left open each evening, if the
rooms selected had adequate table space in
stead of the usual wide-arm desks, if the iden
tity of the rooms were announced, students
would have a place to study after 10 o'clock,
and Stanford could pay its electricity bill, too.—
