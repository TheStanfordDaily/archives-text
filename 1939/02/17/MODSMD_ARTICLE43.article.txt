FOR the second consecutive year, Stanford
proved itself enthusiastic about outside lec
turers. This time, it was fortunate that the
A.S.S.U. was able to obtain John Gunther,

journalist, author, observer of the world at
large.
In reality, the lecture was a set-up. Wars in
Europe and Asia. Gunther, a best-seller on the
European situation; soon to be a best-seller on
the Asiatic situation.
Memorial Theater was near-full by the time
he walked to the center of the stage to begin
his address.
And Stanford took what he had to say with
the dignity that university audiences should,
but often do not, evidence.
In so doing, that audience showed that Stan
lord is thoroughly ready for what has been
under discussion for some time — a Lecture
Series, comparable to the popular Concert
Series.
A lecture series that would present four, or
possibly five, top-flight speakers — authorities
who are directly concerned with subjects of
national and international scope; speakers
Who are fresh from their own important fields;
men and women who are tied closely from day
to day to the details of world history, eco
nomics, culture, society.
Lecturers like lohn Gunther and Carl Sand
burg.
Lecturers who can give a lie to the statement
that Stanford is content within itself.
