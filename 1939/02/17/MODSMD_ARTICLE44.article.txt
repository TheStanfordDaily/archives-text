# BULL SESSION
## BOOKSTORE BLUES 
### JOHN COBBS 
W/'E HAVE known for some years now that when
ever a Stanford student feels in a mood for kick
ing dogs and swearing at little children, he sits down
and writes a hot letter about the Bookstore. I was
not surprised, therefore, to notice a Campus Opinion
letter the other day calling down the wrath of God
on the Bookstore for having an $85,000 surplus.
But evidently our correspondent's grouch is a long
run project. He appears again today, demanding that
we investigate the disgraceful surplus and see that it
is put to work "if it is lying idle." Evidently he has
been waiting for soap box speeches or rioting on the
Quad and is disappointed because they have not come.

I might point out here that I have no overpowering
love for the Bookstore. The bargains it has driven
with me on second-hand turn-ins make Shylock look
like an easy mark. If the prices it allows are typical,
I don't wonder that the Nazis burn books; the fun
they get out of it is probably worth more than they
could get selling them.
But after wandering through the econ department
for four years, I can't stand by idly and see the Book
store assaulted on such flimsy grounds. And so I
shelve my grudge and report on our investigation.

/ ""ONTRARY to our correspondent's impression, the
* Bookstore hasn't got $85,000 in cash hidden under
a loose board behind the counter. Nor is it sitting on
the surplus hoping that it will hatch. That $85,000 is
an accountant's figure, not a puddle of gravy.
After proper depreciation and deduction for the
squeaky hinge on the west door, plant and equipment
show on the balance"sheet at about $13,000. Inven
tory of merchandise is carried at around $35,000. For
our correspondent's information I might add that
"carried" here means shown on the books, and is not
a shipping cost.
This leaves cash surplus of some $27,000, which
according to the best business principles is right
for a bookstore. Comparatively large cash reserves
are necessary because of the practice of ordering in
quantity and making short-term payments.
This, I trust, explains the mystery of the Book
store boodle. Our correspondent can coax his blood
pressure back to normal, soothed by the assurance
that the store is not playing miser while the rest of
Stanford scrambles for money.
As a matter of fact, the explanation is really un
necessary. Funds do not lie idle at Stanford. History
shows us that if there is any money on the campus
the University will find a way to get it.
