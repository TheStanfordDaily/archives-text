At. the lecture the other night John Gunthcr talked
for a while about ihe Orient and Japan's invasion of
China and that sort of thing.
After the lecture, a woman, who was no longer
young, was overheard saying to another:
"I feel just like the Chineseâ€”all this influx of
people, and I stay right here."

Up on the third floor of the clubhou.se, one of the
boys tells me, there's a sign to the effect that men
and women can't study there during the evening.
Well, that rather narrows it down to who can
study there.

Sonic of the high school boys were up at. the lake
a couple of clays ago looking around. They noticed
that, all the canoes had been put in the boathousc.
Why not, they said.
So they followed that question to its logical end
and got one of the canoes out on the lake, found a
couple of pieces of wood, and paddled.
There are, of course, about 40 canoes in the boat
house. They had picked one. It was just one of
Ihosc things that a few of the boys from the frater
nity which owned the canoe came up to the lake just
then to ro canoeing. Probably the only bunch to come
up that day.
But the fraternity men were gentlemen. They cour
teously made a deal with the high school kids.
They promised the boys two paddles and someone
else's canoe if they would bring their canoe back.

Ray Marshall, for years a United Press correspond
ent in Japan, came down to the Farm Wednesday
to give a brief talk before one of the journalism
classes, along with the head of the San Francisco
bureau. MilWrd Holland.
At one point, Mr. Holland, for the benefit of the
girls in the course, had talked about women work
ing for United Press, and particularly one woman.
And at one point in his talk, Mr. Marshall was
lauding this woman. The situation was briefly this:
This woman was Rood, a newshawk. She had just
come to Japan during a dramatic political period.
There was a tenseness in the air as she walked into
the United Press office in Tokio and went up to the
head of the staff . . .
"Hello, Big Boy," she said, "What's doing?"
I don't know. It was un awful let-down.
