# CAMPUS OPINION
## MORE FOR TINY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Since the beginning of time, man
has derived his greatest pleasure
and satisfaction by competing with
his fellow men. Such competition
has produced the achievements of
our modern civilization.
However, in instances where com
petition itself has become the utli
mate factor rather than the means
to a desirable end, the result has
been displeasing and undesirable in
many cases. Business and politics
are filled with these situations. Our
economic system with all of its dis
tasteful aspects has resulted from
this condition.
Tiny Thornhill has been forced
into a position where he no long
er can go onto the football field to
compete for the honor and prestige
of Stanford because he is necessarily
competing for his career as a foot
ball coach. I don't see how the stu
dent. body, the alumni or the board
of athletic control can expect a
good brand of football under these
conditions.
