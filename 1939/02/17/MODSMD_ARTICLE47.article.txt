The Editor, Sir:
Of course you realize that the j
point behind my question about the j
Bookstore's $85,000 surplus wasn't j
for you to tuck it away in Campus j
Opinion and forget about it, don't j
you?
I assumed that the relationship
between that $85,000 and inadequate !
lights in the Libe, inadequate labs |
in the physics department, and in- ,
adequate scholarships for Stanford
students would be as apparent to
you as it is to me; and that you j
would find out what is being done j
with it, and if it is lying idle, make |
specific proposals for its use.
Or is that too much to ask of a
"newspaper?"
