# 'Trade Winds' Is III Wind; Disney Scores
## 
### 
"TRADE WINDS" currently play
ing at the Fox Stanford.
About the only lad who had any
fun with "Trade Winds" was Direc
tor Tay Garnett. Taking a yacht and
two years of his time under studio
contract, he cruised around the
world to pick up atmosphere and

background shots
for the picture.
And neither the
atmosphere nor
the background
shots materially
aided the story.
First of all,
"Trade Winds" is
a misleading title,
in the manner of
many Hollywood
titles. Next of all,
"Trade Winds" is

not a very good picture.
An intricate plot that hinges on
incidents that are not properly clar
ified keeps the audience performing
mental gymnastics to follow devel
opment.
Frederic March, the smooth, play
boy detective, performs with a lack
of assurance that makes us think
that he may be filling the destiny of
his role in "A Star Is Born."
The famed transformation of Joan
Bennett into a second Hedy Lamarr
is worth seeing. Ann Sothem as the
detective's secretary and Ralph Bel
lamy as his chief stooge fill support
ing spots effectively.
On the same bill are the latest
March of Time, in which Time's edi
tors focus their cameras with usual
sharpness on the "State of the Na
tion—l 939," and a Walt Disney
cartoon. —Hutchinson
