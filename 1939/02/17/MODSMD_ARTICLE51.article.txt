# Biologist to Talk On Cell Energy
## 
### 
"Energy Transfer in Biological
Processes" will be discussed by J.
Percy Baumberger, professor of
physiology at Stanford, on the regu
lar Stanford University radio pro
gram broadcast over station KGO
Monday evening at 8:30 o'clock.
"The purpose of the talk will be
to describe the way in which the
living cell handles the energy de
rived from food so that some of the
energy may be used for the syn
thesis of compounds essential to
maintenance and growth," said
Baumberger today.
Investigations along this line are
in progress at Stanford and the bear
ing of these on a diversity of prob
lems ranging from cancer to aviation
will be described.
