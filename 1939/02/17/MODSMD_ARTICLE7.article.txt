# Venus Statues Aid Greek Play
## 'Hippolytus' to Open Run Tomorrow Night 
###

Gabii, both of which are in the
Louvre, were made by Bill Bassett

opens in the Little Theater of Me
morial Hall tomorrow night at 8
o'clock.
The statues of the two goddesses
will flank the main entrance of the
set, which was modeled after the
traditional Greek stage and is fin
ished entirely in gray to sustain the
tragic tone of the play.

Langer. Other members of the
chorus are Carol Hover, Mary Leles,

STEVENS TO DIRECT
Director Thomas Wood Stevens is
using the Gilbert Murray transla
tion of Euripides' play and states his
purpose to be the use of it as a piece
of great theater rather than in any
way an archaeological replica of this
classic production.
