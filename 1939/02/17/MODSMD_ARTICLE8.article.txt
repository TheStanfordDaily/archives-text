# Farm Goes Military At Ball Tonight
## Scabbard and Blade Presents Annual Dance In Military Theme 
### 
Tonight's the night! The Military
S Ball.
j Stanford will attend one of its
largest and most colorful functions
of the year, a formal program dance
I with a big name orchestra, Gus Arn
| hcim, and an extraordinary array
j of special events.
The cadets of the Scabbard and
' Blade, honorary military society,
will present a dress sabre drill and
; the new members will receive their
| bars in a ceremony which has nev
) er before been seen on the Stanford
: campus, although it is a time-hon
ored custom at many other schools. I
The best waltzers will have an op
j portunity to demonstrate their abil- |
: ity in a waltzing contest to be con
i ducted by Arnheim himself. The I
winner will receive a gold loving I
j cup with his name engraved on it, j
| which has been donated by the Var- j
j sity Theater.
I MULTICOLORED BALLOONS
To top off the evening's festivi
; ties during the intermission, a flood
|of multicolored balloons will be
1 dropped on the hour of midnight,
. after which dancing to the music
J of Gus Arnheim will continue until
1 1 o'clock.
The bar ceremony will perhaps be
j the most interesting of the special
events because it is patterned a
; great deal after a ring ceremony
held every year at Annapolis. The
new cadets will march up an aisle
| of sabres, made by the old members
j of the organization, to a big flow
ered arch.
PRESENTATION OF BARS
Waiting for them under the arch
will be Colonel Talbot, commander
i of the R.O.T.C. for the entire ninth j
j corps area, who will present the
I bars to the cadets.
One of the main features of the
orchestra is the beautiful and tal
j entcd Vyola Vonn. Past Arnheim
j vocalists have been Bing Crosby,
| Joy Hodges, and Russ Columbo.
i The name "maker of stars" was giv
'< en to Arnheim because of his abil
! ity to pick beginners with talent
J whom he turns into stars.
President Wilbur, who is an hon- |
' orary member of the Scabbard and j
J Blade Society, and Mrs. Wilbur will 1
j be among the patrons and patron- j
■ esses. The other patrons and patron- !
: esses will be made up of the faculty j
of the School of Military Science.
COLORFUL DECORATIONS
i Adding, perhaps, the most color to
| the ball will be the quality and type
! of the decorations. Dress and signal
I flags from some of the naval cruis-
I ers at San Francisco have been ob
tained from Fort Mason and will be
strung down from the ceiling achiev
ing the effect of having them strung
from the masts of the ships.
Made of soft white leather en
graved with the emlem of the R. O.
T. C., the programs for the various
dances which are named after army
j bugle calls such as Revielle, Colors,
j Retreat, and Taps, may be obtained
