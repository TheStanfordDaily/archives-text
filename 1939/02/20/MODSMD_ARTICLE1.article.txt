# History ... 1939

### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Stanford spent its week
end exploring the artificial
wonders of Treasure Island, the cre
ation of cold, cruel facts continued
in the less enlightened sectors of
the world. We, with our tired eyes
and swollen feet, had little thought
to spare for significant happenings
on the rest of the sphere, â€” the
Fascist menace, national defense, or
the Spanish war.
In spite of the efforts of Pacifica
and the Sally Rand nude ranch to
hog the spotlight, things kept hap
pening over the week-end, events
that spun out the inevitable fabric
of history.

A FTEII a brief flirtation with the
democratic powers, it appears
that Insurgent Spain will return
to the Fascist fold. Having care
fully considered which side his
bread is buttered on, Franco has
suggested to Mussolini that they
confer with Adolf Hitler for the
purpose of establishing a three
power totalitarian front.
News of the Fascist col Tee klatsch
leaked out yesterday through II
Duce's official Milan newsorgan,
thus adding substance to the report
that the three dictators will meet
in that city.

IT IS evident indeed that Fran
cisco has decided it's dangerous
to mix his politics. Last week he
was seriously considering an alli
ance with France and England in
return for immediate recognition for
his Insurgent government and gen
erous loans to support it.
His move to unite with the
Rome-Berlin axis obviously pre
cludes any financial assistance
from the democracies, but it will
be difficult for them to deny for
long recognition of a government
that will soon rule Spain in name
as well as in fact.
* * >it
naturally in the
footsteps of Franco's transfer of
affections, is news that negotiations
between France and the Insurgents
are not proceeding as smoothly as
was hoped. In order to cover up
the deal in case it fails, the French
and Spanish foreign offices have of
ficially stated that they are consid
ering matters other than recognition.
The point of friction in the nego
tiations lies in the fact that the left
ist French popular front is violently
opposed to any move in favor of the
Insurgents. Ministers in the Dala
dier government fear the political
vengeance of their constituents un
less they extort from Franco a prom
ise that he will build no fortifica
tions on the French frontier and
definite word as to when Musso
lini's troops are going to leave
Spain.
$ * At
MEANWHILE the Mcditerra
a nean situation begins to look
serious again. Yesterday Marshall
Hodoglin, chief of the Italian
Gneeral Staff, traveled to the
North African colony of Libya in
order to review the newly organ
ized reserve forces that Mussolini
has added to his colonial army.
Logic has it that the marshall's
trip is a natural reaction to France's
reoccupation Saturday of a stra
tegic strip of territory, formerly
ceded to Italy, between the Gulf of
Aden and the Red Sea. Troops are
rapidly mobilizing in both French
and Italian military centers in North
Africa, and if there's going to be
trouble, they'll be ready for it.

A FEW days ago it seemed, to all
practical intents and purposes,
(hat the United States' sale of
planes to France was a closed issue.
However, today the fact that Roose
velt, over-rode the recommendation
of army heads in ordering the sale,
again rose up mid leered at the na
tion's legislators.
The Senate Military Affairs
Committee is considering attach
ing a rider to the President's na
tional defense bill, already passed
in the upper house, which would
prevent a repetition of such an in
cident.
IJECLAIUNG their intention to
be solely in (he interests of ade
quate defense, senators, lead by Ben
net. Champ Clark of Missouri and
the Democratic party, urged an
amendment which would forbid the
President or any other executive of
ficer to authorize the sale to any
foreign country of any military se
cret valuable to the United States.
If an army plane had not crashed
in Santa Monica a month ago, if re
porters had not discovered that one
of its occupants was an official of
the French department of defense, if
the nation had not learned that it.
was selling military secrets to
France, the national defense bill
would have passed without correc
tion or addition.
15ut the citizens of the United
States are jealous of their rights,
and when someone interferes with
them, be lie the Chief Executive
or no. lie's bound to be kicked in
the teeth. While an act of the
Commander in Chief of the Army
and Navy officially cannot be call
ed interference, that is what Roo
sevelt's order for the plane sale
amounted to.
