## 
### 
! WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 (UP). â€” t
j Democratic leaders in the House,
j harassed by united front opposition
] Irom Republicans and apathy in
! their own ranks, tonight prepared to
put minority members on record on
every measure in the future which
j provides a test of their "liberalism."
The new policy probably will be
initiated when the time comes to
dispose of the agitation for increased
pensions for the aged. The House
Ways and Means Committee is ex- |
pccted to bring out an adverse re- i
port on the bill sponsored by the |
General Welfare Federation which j
would impose a 2 per cent cross in- I
come tax to finance pensions of $G0 j
monthly for all over 60.
