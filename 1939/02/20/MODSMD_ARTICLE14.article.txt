# 'Hippolytus', Lyric Drama, Continues Run
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSODN 
Adding another distinct triumph
to a year filled with dramatic suc
cesses, Thomas Wood Stevens' cast
of 21 players presented Euripides'
"Hippolytus" in the Little Theater
of Memorial Hall last Saturday
night.
The Greek tragedy, with Kae
Kalenborn, Tom O'Leary, and J. P.
Cahn in principal roles, will con
tinue its run tonight and tomorrow
afternoon.
Against a setting that was simple
in line, graceful in proportion, the
play moved with direction and dig
nity. Variations in lighting shroud
ed the stage in shadows and made
characters symbolic rather than per
sonalized, shifted, as action de
manded, to sharp detail.
Tempo was established in the first
speech of Margaret Paulson, as the
Goddess Aphrodite. Kae Kalen
born as Phaedra, wife of Theseus
who fell in love with her husband's
illegitimate son, gave meaning and
beauty to the lyric lines of the
famous Gilbert Murray translation.
Hippolytus, unfortunate object of
her love and his father's wrath, was
well taken by Tom O'Leary. J. P.
Cahn as Theseus brought marvel
ous stage presence, excellent vocal
expression, and a wealth of trained
experience to a role that required
strong portrayal. Virginia Sharpe,
Phaedra's nurse, was easily the best
actress in the supporting cast.
The classic simplicity of Euripides'
lines, expressed so admirably in the
slightly romantic Murray version,
was preserved intact. There were
few lapses of pace. Voice choruses
of men and women aided in retain
ing the restrained dignity and pur
ity of the drama.
