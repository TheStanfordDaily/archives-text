# Chaplain Declares Religion a Gamble
## 
### 
Reverend Thomas E. Oliver, act
ing chaplain of the University, elab
orated on the meaning of the word
"gambling" in his sermon in Me
morial Chapel yesterday morning.
"Religion is a gamble," he said.
"There is never a complete or satis
factory answer to it because there
is never sufficient proof to back up
any argument. Religion has been
too tame of late; we should make it
a gamble in which we are challeng
ed to decide whether we are right
by continuing our lives the way they
arc planned now.
"Our modern life makes it very
hard to believe in God, especially
when you arc out of a job, and I
myself know what that means. But
Jesus gambled when he was cruci
fied, and as the sun went down on
that, fateful day he knew that he
had won. Faith lives today as proof
of it," he concluded.
