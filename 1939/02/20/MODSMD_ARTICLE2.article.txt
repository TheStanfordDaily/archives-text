# Debaters To Tour Hawaii
## Chapin Selects Hays, Hampar for Forensic Trip to Islands 
### 
Selection of two Stanford debaters
to make a tour through Hawaii this
quarter was announced late Saturday
by Bob Putnam, debate manager.
The Card representatives will be Tim
Hays and Armen Ham par.
Tryouts for this forensic honor
have been conducted by Leland Cha
pin, varsity debate coach, for nearly
a month, and it was only last week
that he succeeded in narrowing the
field of over 50 hopefuls down to six:
John Moscovics, Francis McDowell,
John Bates, Dick Carew, and the two
winners.
Mr. Chapin's choices were ap
proved by Debate Council and an
nounced late Saturday afternoon.
TEN DAYS IN ISLANDS
Hays and Hampar will spend about
ten days on the Islands, leaving on
the Matsonia March 24, returning on
the Lurline April 7.
They will probably go prepared on
the Anglo-American question about
the advisability of a mutual assist
ance pact bet ween Great Britain and
America and as an alternate topic
may fall back on the Pi Kappa Delta
question of helping business with
public funds.
ACTIVE DEBATERS
Both of the chosen representatives
have been very active in campus fo
l'ensic work, Hays participating in
several regular squad debates and
intercollegiate meets, Hampar be
coming noted for his work on the
radio debates for the Radio League
Series.
It is expected that the tour will
be conducted not solely on the basis
of taking the trip to meet other teams
on the platform, but that it will work
out partially on the lines of the re
cent Indian Tour on which the de
baters went out to observe and
gather material for discussions and
symposiums when they returned to
school.
According to Mr. Chapin, the re
sults of the journey through the In
dian territory were very satisfactory.
