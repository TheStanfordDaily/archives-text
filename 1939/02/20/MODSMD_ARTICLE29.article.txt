# U.S. Cardinals In Rome For Papal Election
## Activity of Liberals Opposing Dictators May Split Voting 
### 
VATICAN CITY, Feb. 19 (UP).—
The unpiecedented presence of two
American Cardinals in Rome for the
papal election today revived expec
tations in church circles that the
conclave of Cardinals will split into
two main streams, one of democrat
ic and liberal tendencies and the
other inclined toward totalitarian
ism.
Il was contended that the Ameri
cans, and particularly George Cardi
nal Mundelein of Chicago, will oc
cupy extremely active roles in the
liberal group, while the second will
consist' chiefly of those Italian and
German Cardinals who believe that
the Vatican should adopt a more
amenable policy toward the totali
tarian states.
Cardinal Mundelein and Dennis
Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia
today attended with 47 other Cardi
nals the celebration of the second of
nine solemn masses of Novendiali,
which are to precede the conclave.
Alexius Cardinal Ascolesi was the
celebrant of the mass, which was
sung in St. Peter's Basilica.
Between the two extremes in the
conclave, Vatican observers pre
dicted, will be a third group of
Cardinals, who will strongly urge
the election of an essentially re
ligious-minded pontiff. This middle
group may hold a balance of power
in the election and may be particu
larly influential with the prelates of
totalitarian leanings, some of whom
see hope of peace in appeasement of
the dictators.
