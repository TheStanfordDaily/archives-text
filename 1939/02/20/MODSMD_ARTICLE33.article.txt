## Sunday Night Movie 'Best Yet This Year' 
### MICHAEL EDEN 
It was the best picture that the
A.S.S.U.'s Sunday movie committee
has provided for Stanford audiences.
Incorporating a fresh, straight
forward approach to a simple tale of
a man and his dogs, "To the Victor,"
British-produced Gainsborough film,
was superb entertainment.
Pitched against the grey back
ground of Scottish highland, the
story unwound evenly, avoiding the
obvious Hollywood techniques of
one gigantic climax, heavily accented
love interest, and hokum fadeouts.
Tremendously exciting were the
sequences where Bob and Black
Wull, dog heroes of the picture, vied
for supremacy as shepherds. Versa
tility marked the performances of
Will Fyffe and John Loder in the
leading roles.
Consistent casting of minor spots
and sincere interpretation made "To
the Victor" seem less a work of fic
tion tnan an actual documentary.
Thoroughly refreshing, the picture
was well balanced, filled with a
teeming earthliness.
If Coline Upshaw and her co
workers can continue to pull out of
the bag pictures that have the sub
tlety, charm, and amusing naivete of
"To the Victor," the Farm will be
a less arid place on Sunday nights
about seven-thirtv.
