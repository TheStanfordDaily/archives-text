i The Editor, Sir:
When the gong sounded on the I
final bout of the Stanf'ord-U.C.L.A.
| boxing tournament, one thing was
j foremost in the minds of Stanford i
j fans — that Clayton Frye is a real i
icoach.
I They say it takes three years to j
j teach a man to box. Well, Frye start -
jed from scratch at Stanford two
j years ago, and look what he's done
j It was not only that his boys made
j a clean sweep of their first inter
collegiate contest of the season, but
i every man who wore red trunks
j into the ring put up a clean scien
i tific battle that could result only
! from skilled and careful coaching.
All who meet the Stanford fight
• mentor are immediately impressed
j with his friendly unassuming man
! ner. And his fine personality surely
i has a beneficial mental effect upon
his boys, as can be seen by their
great faith in his counsel both in
practice and in competition.
This is not intended to be the type
jof writing that appears on grave
! stones, but only a much-deserved
tribute to the men who brought a
real gentleman and a fine coach to
Stanford.
