# Humanist Attacks N.Y. Fair Policy
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 19 (UP).â€”The
New York World's Fair, which has
been taking it on the chin right along
from artists and strip-teasers, was
served up another mess of criticism
tonight, this time on the side of
religion.
The Rev. Charles Francis Potter,
founder and leader of the First Hu
manist Society of New York,
preached a sermon of protest against
the fair's Temple of Religion, Inc.,
alleging it is too exclusive, in that
it makes provision only for Catho
lic, Protestant and Jewish repre
sentation and snubs Mohammedans,
Christian Scientists, Mormons and
his own Humanists.
