###

of dynamite in six pairs of gloves,
the Farm's leather pushers wal
loped an invading U.C.L.A. boxing
contingent in the second intercolle
giate boxing tournament Saturday
night in the Pavilion.
With local talent squaring off for
the all-University wrestling cham
pionships, seven titles were decided
on the canvas preceding the Bruin
Sfjuared-circle debacle.
Coach Clayton Frye's hirelings
clash inside the ring against Cal
here this Friday night, while the
varsity cagers are in Los Angeles
vying with U.C.L.A. The boxers
cross the bay for a return match
with the Bears, March 4, and a tew
Cards may compete in the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiates at Sacramento
March 30 and 31.
WARI) OUT
Substituting for Johnny Ward,
who was favoring a shoulder injur
ed in practice last week, Bill Greer
came through with an unpopular
decision over the Bruins' Hanson in
the lightweight battle. However,
Referee Jack Downey awarded the
decision after it had appeared that
Hanson had done little damage while
Greer had landed heavier blows.
Lacing out with his right and left
and finishing stronger, Herb Gunn
added victim No. 5 to the Card's de
feated list when he out-pointed
Periano in the IGS-pound division in
other narrow decision.
Bruce Berg started the evening's
matches with a knock-down of
Blown in the 127-pound class in the
closing seconds of the third round.
John Wilson, finished strong to
take the second and third rounds in
his fight with Hayes in the light
weight, encounter.
TECHNICAL KAYO
In two welterweight clashes, Jack
Rice was victor over Thickston in a
technical knockout decision in the
first canto, while Bill Wilber won
the most convincing match of the
evening when he kept jabbing his
leit into Grovis' face throughout the
three rounds. Wilber covered up
masterfully on defense and took
only a few brushes from Grovis.
Paired in the heavyweight wres
tling finals were Steve Keuseff and
Jim Groves, Card footballers, who
put on the evening's battle royal
with the former taking a time limit
decision. John Hoffner defeated
Charley Moss in the 175-pound
class, Bill Longhurst took a fall
match from Ted Bravos in the 165-
pound division, and Bill Gosline
threw Jack Lawrence in the 155-
pound match.
Dwight Zook was forced to the
limit to capture the nod in the 145-
pound fight over Emilio de Jaure
qui. Wayne Zook pinned Jim
Shields, and Harry Dickson took his
match by a fall from Jim McCarthy
in the two light weight matches.
