# Frosh Baseballers Bat Out 5-1 Win
## 
### 
After taking two slappings in j
their first two starts, Harry Ship- !
key's frosh baseballers last Friday j
batted and fielded their way to an
easy 5-1 win over a mediocre St.
Ignatius High School.
Russ Smith, who has pitched him- i
sell into a cinch Cardinal team j
berth, was as consistent as ever, al- !
lowing only a few scattered hits. He !
hurled the entire seven innings and j
piled up a tidy total of strike-outs.
In the infield, first baseman Will
Glunbcrg juggled through an off
day but managed to smooth out his
difficulties as the game progressed, i
Paul Blanton, who just last week '
was returned to the eligible lists, has I
fitted better than average into the |
tricky short-stop spot, and at pres- j
ent it appears that he will continue
to hold that position for the rest of
the year.
