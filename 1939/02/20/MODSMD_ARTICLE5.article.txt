# Blizzard Hits North Wisconsin
## 
### 
ASHLAND, Wis., Feb. 19 (UP).â€”
One of the severest blizzards in a
decade struck Northern Wisconsin
today, paralyzing transportation as
drifts piled up in a stiff northeast
gale.
All busses and trains scheduled
out of Ashland tonight were held
up, including Chicago-bound North
western and Soo Line passenger
trains. Highways were dotted with
cars abandoned when drivers found
the going too hazardous. The mer
cury stood at eight above.
