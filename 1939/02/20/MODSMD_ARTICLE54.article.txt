for Stanford's double defeat. Phil
made exactly one (1) point in the
!I wo games. But the defeats were
the least of Coach Everett Dean's
i worries, because in Saturday night's
j rout he lost Don Burness and Bill
: Rapp by injuries. Burness's bad
! knee forced him lo leave the game
while Rapp crashed into a baseboard
, with such force that he also was
, forced from the game. The extent
of their injuries is unknown at
; present.
However, there was one bright
spot. for. the. Cards. By holding
1 Vaughn to a 25-point total in the
two games they secured Hank Lui
! setti's individual scoring mark for
j this year.

I of 232 points, an average of better
than 19.3 points a game, which
Hank hung up last year. But to beat
the mark Vaughn would have to
