# Card Ruggers Triumph Again; Take Ucla 18-5
## 
### 
i Stanford ruggers continued their
! winning streak in the race for the
! league title by defeating U.C.L.A.
: Saturday by a score of 18-5.
The Cards dominated the whole
I game with superior playing. The
i U.C.L.A. team was active and willing
| enough, but their lack of experience
I was evident. During thp first half
i Stanford ruggers were very active
| and aggressive. Dean Johnson and
j Howard Hickingbotham made tries
| with Aubrey Austin making the con
i versions, and slating the score 10-0
at the half.
U.C.L.A. came through with its
only score in the second half. Bill
Troxell scored the try and John
jFrawley converted, making the score
! 10 to 5.
j Jim Grubbs scored a try soon after
| the beginning of the second half,
j with Austin again converting and
j raising the score to 14 to 5. Austin
i completed his kicking record, mak
| ing a difficult angle kick on a pen
: alty kick and bringing the score up
I to 18 to 0.
This win over the Bruins gives
! Stanford a good crack at the cham
j pionship of the rugby league. The
; ruggers have taken all comers in
| the league so far, including the Tro
| jans who were league champs last
| season. The Card ruggers show a
j superior knowledge of rugby over
jail their opponents so far, according
j to Harry Maloney, who has helped
nurse rugby back to a place in the
sun. Their success is greatly due to
the eflorts of the two volunteer
coaches, Jim Wylie and Will Classen,
who give their time freely for the
development of the game.
