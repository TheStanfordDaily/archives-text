FOR 25 long years a weather-beaten, termite
ridden boathouse marred the pastoral charm
of the spring scene at Lake Lagunita. Stanford
ignored it and directed the attention of its visi
tors to the President's home as they drove past.
Last spring quarter, when the boathouse was
jammed with students watching the Junior Wa
ter Carnival, the supports of the platform gave
way, and it crashed into the lake. Two injured,
many shaken up and drenched—Stanford de
cided it was time to take notice.
The Administration shook its head sadly,
regretted that it had no funds to build a new
boathouse. At this point student self-govern
ment gave a rare exhibition of justifying its
existence. In response to the hue and cry
raised by a canoe-conscious student body and
a Daily campaign, Ex Committee went into
action and decided that the A.S.S.U. would
finance a new boathouse. Stanford was pleased
with itself.
However, the next morning Stanford awoke
with a headache—how was it going to pay the
bill? Word spend around the campus grape
vine: there's going to be another drive; they're
going to ask us for money again; all we do is
pay. The boathouse drive had two strikes on
it before it started.
Today comes news that there is to be no drive
to pay for the Boathouse (now proudly spelled
with a capital letter). Instead, the entire cam
pus will celebrate the completion of its new
water-sports center with a skillfully planned
program which combines the appeal of a Labor
Day barbecue, a water carnival, and the final
Cal game of the season.
Aside from a nominal 50-cent charge for the
dance, everything will be free on Boathouse
Day. Rather than attempting to pay for the
Boathouse, the event is designed merely to
make an occasion of its opening. The maxi
mum profit that can be realized from the cele
bration will fall short of $500, a sum which will
not go far toward paying for a $10,000 struc
ture.
The University will grant the A.S.S.U. a loan
to finance the Boathouse, and this will be repaid
gradually through the student body's usual
sources of income.
Boathouse Day will be one of those old
fashioned affairs, reminiscent of the days when
the trolley was the only means of communi
cation with Palo Alto, when Stanford students
had their good times together on the campus.

program which combines the appeal of a Labor
Day barbecue, a water carnival, and the final
Cal game of the season.
Aside from a nominal 50-cent charge for the
dance, everything will be free on Boathouse
Day. Rather than attempting to pay for the
Boathouse, the event is designed merely to
make an occasion of its opening. The maxi
mum profit that can be realized from the cele
bration will fall short of $500, a sum which will
not go far toward paying for a $10,000 struc
ture.
The University will grant the A.S.S.U. a loan
to finance the Boathouse, and this will be repaid
gradually through the student body's usual
sources of income.
Boathouse Day will be one of those old
fashioned affairs, reminiscent of the days when
the trolley was the only means of communi
cation with Palo Alto, when Stanford students
had their good times together on the campus.
Not the boathouse drive, but the Boathouse
Day—there's no catch to it. —L. L.
FOR 25 long years a weather-beaten, termite
ridden boathouse marred the pastoral charm
of the spring scene at Lake Lagunita. Stanford
ignored it and directed the attention of its visi
tors to the President's home as they drove past.
Last spring quarter, when the boathouse was
jammed with students watching the Junior Wa
ter Carnival, the supports of the platform gave
way, and it crashed into the lake. Two injured,
many shaken up and drenched—Stanford de
cided it was time to take notice.
The Administration shook its head sadly,
regretted that it had no funds to build a new
boathouse. At this point student self-govern
ment gave a rare exhibition of justifying its
existence. In response to the hue and cry
raised by a canoe-conscious student body and
a Daily campaign, Ex Committee went into
action and decided that the A.S.S.U. would
finance a new boathouse. Stanford was pleased
with itself.
However, the next morning Stanford awoke
with a headache—how was it going to pay the
bill? Word spend around the campus grape
vine: there's going to be another drive; they're
going to ask us for money again; all we do is
pay. The boathouse drive had two strikes on
it before it started.
Today comes news that there is to be no drive
to pay for the Boathouse (now proudly spelled
with a capital letter). Instead, the entire cam
pus will celebrate the completion of its new
water-sports center with a skillfully planned
program which combines the appeal of a Labor
Day barbecue, a water carnival, and the final
Cal game of the season.
