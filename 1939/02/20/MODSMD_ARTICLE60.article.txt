EX COMMITTEE last week turned down the
Glee Club for a closed Friday night date
on which to hold its annual home concert.
Latest plan to circumvent the circumstances
which prevent such a date being granted is to
ask for a mid-week closed date, probably a
Wednesday night.
Toward its Glee Clubs, Stanford has long
turned up its collective nose, at the same time
lias adopted a fatherly attitude of tolerance
toward its sons and daughters who feel the
need of musical expression via their vocal
cords.
Last year, the club amazed the campus by
turning in an excellent performance in the
drama division's "Trial by Jury." Years before,
Farm singers put on an annual junior class
opera—one of the best events on the yearly
calendar.
With an incentive, Stanford's singers have
shown their ability.
It's been some time, however, since they have
had an incentive; at the present, they are in
search of one.
Offhand, it looks as though they won't find it
because they can't.
If an opportunity is granted them, however—
possibly a mid-week opportunity as they will
soon suggest—the A.S.S.U. might have less
difficulty turning them over to the University
than it had giving away $700 worth of sym
phony orchestra instruments.
