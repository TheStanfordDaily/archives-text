IN response to student demand, Memorial
Church was opened yesterday afternoon for
the purpose of conducting student Vesper
Services for the second time this year.
For a long time, it has been almost traditional
policy to ignore the Church on Sundays, ex
cept Easter. Recently, however, those who de
sired services held primarily for themselves
and any of the rest of the student body who
cared to attend acted to fill a need that has
existed almost as long as the Church itself.
Sponsored by students, conducted by stu
dents, the idea seemingly is gaining interest—
as evidenced by an increased attendance over

the first time.
Whatever the Farm's attitude toward Sun
day, toward religion—the students who organ
ized the Vesper Services proved two things
yesterday:
The student body is not as disinterested in
religion as an off-hand estimate would indi
cate.
The student body or some of its members
can still put sound ideas into effect.—G. G. A.
