BREAKING all precedent, breaking the hearts
of all that should be present, The Daily to
day announces for the benefit of the staff that
its weekly seminar will be held at 2:15 o'clock,
sunshine or no sunshine, like spring quarter
or not like spring quarter. Edit Board, always
ready to chew the fat, circle the under
brush, will convene in the best of regulated
manners at sometime close to 2 o'clock sharp.
