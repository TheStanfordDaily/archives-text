### JOHN COBBS 
MOVIE MELANCHOLIA
Vjf/ORD comes to me that theater managers up and
down the peninsula arc displeased with our local
newspapers. Reviewers, it seems, have been staging a
mild revolution against the totalitarianism of the busi
ness stafT and have been calling a flop a flop instead
of "pleasing film fare." The high priests of the gods
of Hollywood resent this; they complain that the
treachery of Brutus was mere thoughtlessness in
comparison with the depravity of newspapers that run
advertisements on one page and blistering reviews on
another.
Ordinarily I can sympathize with suffering busi
ness men; they lead a bleak life in these days when
there is no closed season on entrepreneurs. But in
this case, I can find no compassion. Theater man
agers can't be expected to please everyone but for the
prices they charge they ought to give you an even
chance of seeing something you can tolerate.
If « * *
A s IT IS now, the odds are all against the man who
goes to a movie hoping to get an evening of en
tertainment. Most of the pictures are full of scenes
where people speak unintelligibly hi raised voices.
Practically all of the characters are hopelessly mal
adjusted and would really be much happier if they
jumped off a bridge in the first reel. All the audience
gets out of its admission price is a headache and the
conviction that God wasn't watching when American
civilization evolved.
The movies that don't brood over somebody's psy
schological dismemberment usually plunge us into
other evils. Most of them resound with shots in the
dark and are cluttered up with half a dozen men in
slouch hats sneaking past French windows. By the
time you've got the hero spotted you're so out of
sympathy you hope he gets his neck broken.
* * * *
There are other species and sub-species of movies,
of course. But regardless of the brand, 90 per cent of
them add up to nothing more than an expensive eye
strain.
Tlus wouldn't be so bad if movies were free, like
park statuary- and post office murals. But for the
prices they charge the theater managers ought to give
us the best spectacle since Genesis. A 40-cent movie
like Caesar's wife should be above reproach.
We forgive the managers a great many sins as a
matter of course. We wait patiently in lobbies like the
Black Hole in Calcutta, after the usher told us there
was enough room to seat an army. We tolerate pre
views; we bear up under selected short subjects. And
we are remarkably patient about Class B features.
As far as I can see, theater managers have no com
plaint coming. They should forget, about reviewers
and concentrate on being grateful for the Christian
tradition of charity.

treachery of Brutus was mere thoughtlessness in
comparison with the depravity of newspapers that run
advertisements on one page and blistering reviews on
another.
Ordinarily I can sympathize with suffering busi
ness men; they lead a bleak life in these days when
there is no closed season on entrepreneurs. But in
this case, I can find no compassion. Theater man
agers can't be expected to please everyone but for the
prices they charge they ought to give you an even
chance of seeing something you can tolerate.

A s IT IS now, the odds are all against the man who
goes to a movie hoping to get an evening of en
tertainment. Most of the pictures are full of scenes
where people speak unintelligibly hi raised voices.
Practically all of the characters are hopelessly mal
adjusted and would really be much happier if they
jumped off a bridge in the first reel. All the audience
gets out of its admission price is a headache and the
conviction that God wasn't watching when American
civilization evolved.
The movies that don't brood over somebody's psy
schological dismemberment usually plunge us into
other evils. Most of them resound with shots in the
dark and are cluttered up with half a dozen men in
slouch hats sneaking past French windows. By the
time you've got the hero spotted you're so out of
sympathy you hope he gets his neck broken.

There are other species and sub-species of movies,
of course. But regardless of the brand, 90 per cent of
them add up to nothing more than an expensive eye
strain.
Tlus wouldn't be so bad if movies were free, like
park statuary- and post office murals. But for the
prices they charge the theater managers ought to give
us the best spectacle since Genesis. A 40-cent movie
like Caesar's wife should be above reproach.
We forgive the managers a great many sins as a
matter of course. We wait patiently in lobbies like the
Black Hole in Calcutta, after the usher told us there
was enough room to seat an army. We tolerate pre
views; we bear up under selected short subjects. And
we are remarkably patient about Class B features.
As far as I can see, theater managers have no com
plaint coming. They should forget, about reviewers
and concentrate on being grateful for the Christian
tradition of charity.
MOVIE MELANCHOLIA
Vjf/ORD comes to me that theater managers up and
down the peninsula arc displeased with our local
newspapers. Reviewers, it seems, have been staging a
mild revolution against the totalitarianism of the busi
ness stafT and have been calling a flop a flop instead
of "pleasing film fare." The high priests of the gods
of Hollywood resent this; they complain that the
treachery of Brutus was mere thoughtlessness in
comparison with the depravity of newspapers that run
advertisements on one page and blistering reviews on
another.
