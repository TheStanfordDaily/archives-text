A couple of Kow boys wanted to get over to the
chemistry lab in a hurry the other night.. The quick
est way, naturally, would be to take their car.
They collected their books and hurried out to the
car—to find that it had a Hat tire.
When I saw them they were frantically changing
the tire.
They had to get to the chem lab in a huriy.

WESTERN
A salesman from one of the San Francisco whole
sale houses, whose l)eat. takes in this end of the
Peninsula, picked up the spirit of this rip-roarin'-
Western Fair stuff the other day.
He got all dressed up the way San Francisco people
seem to think the old boys used to dress. He had
everything including two guns. And he put all of his
samples in a big canvas bag, which he carried over his
shoulder after the fashion of Santa Claus or a Cowboy.
During the morning he got down to the Farm,
went into the Union to Miss Kicker's office, and with
out saying a word stopped in the middle of the floor
and dumped all the samples from his bag out on
the rug.
Miss Kicker, I hear, simply sat there. She was
quite flabbergasted at this colorful, silent Westerner,
who followed up dumping the samples by carrying
on his business from the rug in the middle of the
room without a word of explanat ion.
I haven't heard whether the people in the St.
Francis Hotel were equally surprised when he did the
same thing there.

When I last knew him, he was on a diet. But things
have changed.
The other night he ate a stack of hot-cakes, a
cup of chocolate, and 13Vz hamburgers in 30 minutes
on a bet.
According to the terms of the bet he had to eat IVi
more hamburgers in the half hour. He couldn't do it,
so he not only lost the bet but he had to pay for the
junk he ate.
He said that the last five didn't taste very good.
He didn't have time to put mustard on them.

MODERN
One of the funniest sights I have seen in a long
time was a young lady going up the library steps the
other night two at a time wearing these very large
modern Dutch shoes.
A friend of mine tells me that you have to be pret
ty careful when you first wear them. They're likely
to pitch you over on your face when you stop sud
denly if you're not used to them.
One morning before my friend found that out,
she fell down the English steps.

Miss Kicker, I hear, simply sat there. She was
quite flabbergasted at this colorful, silent Westerner,
who followed up dumping the samples by carrying
on his business from the rug in the middle of the
room without a word of explanat ion.
I haven't heard whether the people in the St.
Francis Hotel were equally surprised when he did the
same thing there.

When I last knew him, he was on a diet. But things
have changed.
The other night he ate a stack of hot-cakes, a
cup of chocolate, and 13Vz hamburgers in 30 minutes
on a bet.
According to the terms of the bet he had to eat IVi
more hamburgers in the half hour. He couldn't do it,
so he not only lost the bet but he had to pay for the
junk he ate.
He said that the last five didn't taste very good.
He didn't have time to put mustard on them.

One of the funniest sights I have seen in a long
time was a young lady going up the library steps the
other night two at a time wearing these very large
modern Dutch shoes.
A friend of mine tells me that you have to be pret
ty careful when you first wear them. They're likely
to pitch you over on your face when you stop sud
denly if you're not used to them.
One morning before my friend found that out,
she fell down the English steps.

A couple of Kow boys wanted to get over to the
chemistry lab in a hurry the other night.. The quick
est way, naturally, would be to take their car.
They collected their books and hurried out to the
car—to find that it had a Hat tire.
When I saw them they were frantically changing
the tire.
They had to get to the chem lab in a huriy.

A salesman from one of the San Francisco whole
sale houses, whose l)eat. takes in this end of the
Peninsula, picked up the spirit of this rip-roarin'-
Western Fair stuff the other day.
He got all dressed up the way San Francisco people
seem to think the old boys used to dress. He had
everything including two guns. And he put all of his
samples in a big canvas bag, which he carried over his
shoulder after the fashion of Santa Claus or a Cowboy.
During the morning he got down to the Farm,
went into the Union to Miss Kicker's office, and with
out saying a word stopped in the middle of the floor
and dumped all the samples from his bag out on
the rug.
