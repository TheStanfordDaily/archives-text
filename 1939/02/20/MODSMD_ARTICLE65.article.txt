# Force Of 'Idiots' Delight' Lost In Cinema Version
## 
### 
"IDIOT'S DELIGHT," playing
at the Stanford Theater.
This is M.G.M.'s emasculated ver
sion of the Robert S. Sherwood
Pulitzer prize-winning play. Hol
lywood, which lives in timorous
fear of stepping on anyone's toes,
has cooled what was a bitter de-

nuncaition of war
down to a mild
protest.
However, there
was enough im
plied vitriol left
in the script to
have put over the
point, but Norma
Shearer and Clark
Gable are not
subtle people.
K rene's best speech
of the play, her

denunciation of the Munitions Mag
nate, remained practically the same.
The fact that it was a good speech
seems to have impressed Miss
Shearer and she got out to impress
the audience. Overemphasis lost her
point.
ARNOLD SCORES
Astute Actor Edward Arnold,
playing the munitions maker to the
hilt, spotted this slip, and in his an
swer to her succeeded in making
his character's philosophy believ
able and logical.
Gable was much better than his
co-star, but he completely lost the
underlying bitterness and disillu
sionment of the hoofer, Harry Van.
The use of Esperanto, as the
language of the country, probably
will not soothe sensitive Italian na
tionalists. The setting is obvious;
Hollywood might just as well have
gone the whole hog.
As for the plot, the whole point is

lost. The entire thing is a build-up
to the point that the "little people," 1
characterized by the hoofer and the |
phoney countess, are inevitably !
crushed by the forces they struggle
against, but cannot understand. Miss
Shearer cries as much when she
and Gable are awaiting death in the
air raid. To have them escape and
start gleefully for London and a
successful mind-reading act is one
of the better movie paradoxes.
The supporting cast is excellent.
Burgess Meredith, as the pacifist,
Quillery, brings a welcome restraint
to the wild-eyed proceedings, yet
puts over a sensitive portrayal.
Charles Coburn, Laura Hope Crews,
and Joseph Schildkraut bring a pro
fessional snap and technique to the
otherwise amateurish proceedings.
"Idiot's Delight" is another of the
pictures to put on the "Motion Pic
tures' Greatest Year" do not see
list. —Nowell |

nuncaition of war
down to a mild
protest.
However, there
was enough im
plied vitriol left
in the script to
have put over the
point, but Norma
Shearer and Clark
Gable are not
subtle people.
K rene's best speech
of the play, her

denunciation of the Munitions Mag
nate, remained practically the same.
The fact that it was a good speech
seems to have impressed Miss
Shearer and she got out to impress
the audience. Overemphasis lost her
point.
ARNOLD SCORES
Astute Actor Edward Arnold,
playing the munitions maker to the
hilt, spotted this slip, and in his an
swer to her succeeded in making
his character's philosophy believ
able and logical.
Gable was much better than his
co-star, but he completely lost the
underlying bitterness and disillu
sionment of the hoofer, Harry Van.
The use of Esperanto, as the
language of the country, probably
will not soothe sensitive Italian na
tionalists. The setting is obvious;
Hollywood might just as well have
gone the whole hog.
As for the plot, the whole point is

lost. The entire thing is a build-up
to the point that the "little people," 1
characterized by the hoofer and the |
phoney countess, are inevitably !
crushed by the forces they struggle
against, but cannot understand. Miss
Shearer cries as much when she
and Gable are awaiting death in the
air raid. To have them escape and
start gleefully for London and a
successful mind-reading act is one
of the better movie paradoxes.
The supporting cast is excellent.
Burgess Meredith, as the pacifist,
Quillery, brings a welcome restraint
to the wild-eyed proceedings, yet
puts over a sensitive portrayal.
Charles Coburn, Laura Hope Crews,
and Joseph Schildkraut bring a pro
fessional snap and technique to the
otherwise amateurish proceedings.
"Idiot's Delight" is another of the
pictures to put on the "Motion Pic
tures' Greatest Year" do not see
list. —Nowell |

"IDIOT'S DELIGHT," playing

This is M.G.M.'s emasculated ver
sion of the Robert S. Sherwood
Pulitzer prize-winning play. Hol
lywood, which lives in timorous
fear of stepping on anyone's toes,
has cooled what was a bitter de-

nuncaition of war
down to a mild
protest.
