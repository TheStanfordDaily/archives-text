### 
HONOLULU, T.H., Feb. 19 (UP).â€” ;
Territorial Senator Eugene Beebe to- j
day announced he would propose
creation of a territorial social secu
rity and labor relations department.
The proposal, which has been un- ;
der discussion, already has met with j
considerable opposition from officials '
and legislators who want a separate
labor department. Delegate to Con
gress Samuel W. King cabled objec
tions to the dual department plan.
Coffeepots are placed on the graves J
of Arabian chiefs in Palestine and ,
Syria, to indicate the hospitable j
character of the departed chief.
