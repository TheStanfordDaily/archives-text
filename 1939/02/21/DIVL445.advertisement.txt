A letter of recommendation from the man
ager of the Metropolitan Opera Company:
My dear Miss MacNevin:
Having been absent from the city, your letter addressed
to the Metropolitan has only reached me today.
I offer you my congratulations for the splendid appoint
ment which you state you have obtained at the Nashville
Conservatory of Music, but I must also congratulate the
Conservatory in having acquired on its staff an artist of
your standing and intelligence. With your excellent voice
and artistry you ought to be able to do great work among
the students of Tennessee, and I wish you the great success
that you deserve.
(Signed) Edward Johnson
