### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
npHERE are a great many people j
in this university who don't
think much of Franklin D. Roose
velt. In many cases this aversion is
due to a hereditary distaste for eco
nomic liberalism and soak-the-rich
tactics. In others, the thought that j
the new generation will have to foot |
the bill for the President's extrava- I
gant spending program is responsible |
for his lack of popularity.
If one were forced to generalize,
he would be justified in bracketing
the Stanford student body as anti-
New Deal. Although it hates to ad- 1
mit it, the background of a large
percentage of the students is one
of upper middle class Republican
ism. In addition, the high priest of
the G.O.P. lives on this very cam
pus, and Stanford men are preju- |
diced against Mrs. Roosevelt.
« * *
DE THIS as it may, the local
anti-New Dealers are forced to
capitulate on certain rare occa
sions antl admit that the Presi
dent has had a good idea. The
voice of many a well-informed
Republican swelled the piping
chorus of Political Union liberals !
and A.S.U. members, when two :
years ago Roosevelt proposed a
complete reorganization of the ad
ministrative branch of the federal
government.
The tangled maze of independent
and semi-independent administra
tive bureaus which the New Deal
has added to the dozens that existed
prior to 1933 are eloquent evidence
of a need for regimenting these
bodies and firmly anchoring them to
responsibility.

'"piIE sad part of the story Is that j
President Roosevelt presented j
his reorganization bill to Congress [
at a time when he was on both the !
legislators' and the voters' black i
lists. His proposed Supreme Court j
reform produced in the nation a |
mental set which would have dinged
practically any bill calling for a
change in government organization.
Enemies of the administration
took to the hill-tops to shout |
warnings that Roosevelt was seek- i
ing dictatorial powers. First he ;
had tried to hamstring the Su- j
prcmc Court, and now he was at- !
tempting to abolish many of the
administrative bureaus, deny the
independence of the rest, and con- !
solidate the power in his own i
office.
The result of all this is well .
known. The administrative reor
ganization bill got the black ball, i
*• * t>
r YEARS have passed, and the I
government's independent agen- !
cy set-up has not improved with ]
time. Congress .still realizes the
need for a change. Today political
science majors will be delighted to
learn that Senate and House lead
ers have been studying the problem,
and have reached a tentative agree
ment on a compromise measure
which is designed to satisfy both '
the New Deal and it.s Republican j
and conservative Democrat oppo- |
nents.
Approved yesterday by the
heads of the reorganization com- \
mittees in both the upper and j
lower house, the new proposal is
scheduled to be introduced to the j
Representatives on Thursday, |
duly explained, analyzed, and an- j
notatcd.
With the legislators in a more j
friendly mood than they were two j
years ago, with the adequate pro- j
tection against an over-centraliza- j
tion of power in the executive of- J
fice, the bill stands a fair chance of |
being passed. But in situations |
where congressmen arc balancing a j
government need against possible j
displeasure in their constituencies,!
they are often unpredictable.
Administrative reorganization I
stands a fair chance. That's all.
