# Card Scientist Talks on Radio
## Claims Oxygen Study Aids Cancer Work 
### 
"Energy Transfer in Biological
Processes" was discussed by J. Per
cy Baumbcrger, professor of phys
iology at Stanford, on the Stanford
University radio program over .sta
tion KGO last night.
Investigations as to the way in
which the living cell handles the en
ergy derived from food so that some
of the energy may be used for the
synthesis of compounds essential to
maintenance and growth are in
progress at Stanford University. Mr.
Baumbcrger described the bearing
of these investigations on a diver
sity of problems ranging from can
cer to aviation.
"Calorimetric measurements were
made recently at Stanford by Dr.
R. Winzler and myself," said Baum
bcrger, "of the efficiency of assimi
lation in the presence and absence
of oxygen. These measurements
showed the efficiency to be twicc as
great in anacrobiosis as in the pres
ence of oxygen."
"It is quite possible that cancer
cells utilize this method and are
thus enabled to prosper at the ex
pense of their more spend-thrift
neighbors," he continued. "It is
sometimes true that the oxygen con
sumption of cancer cells is less than
normal and usually the fermenta
tive activity is higher than in normal
cells. Both these circumstances are
such as to be conducive to synthe
sis and may have a great bearing on
the uncontrolled growth character
istic of cancer."
