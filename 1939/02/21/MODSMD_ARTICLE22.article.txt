# Schoop Cancels Ballet Ducat Rates
## 
### 
All student rates for the Trudi
Schoop dance concert have been
cancelled, because her San Fran
cisco run, which begins this Thurs
day, has been cut from nine to five
performances, as result of an injury
suffered during her Los Angeles
conceit series.
Refunds on orders may be had
from Margaret Jewell at the Wom
en's Gym, and no further orders will
be taken.
