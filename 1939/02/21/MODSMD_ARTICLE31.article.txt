# Farm Nine Given Edge Over St. Mary's Squad In Game Here Tomorrow
## Holiday Tilt Sees Teams Tied For Conference Title Battle, Outcome Expected to Hinge on Mound Men 
### 
Seeking' their second straight conference win, Stanford's "youth Con
gress" haseh.ill team meets the touted St. Mary's varsity tomorrow after
noon on the Sunken Diamond. Game time has been set for 2:30 o'clock.
St. Mary's and Stanford are currently tied for lirst place in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baselmll League, each having defeated Santa Clara

in their only starts. The other,
league terms have no! opened their
regular .season.
The Indians will enter the Wash
ington's Birthday tilt with better
than an even chance to upset the
Moraga outfit which cleaned up in
the Berkeley Winter League and
won the championship of the loop
last Sunday.
MOUND STAFFS STRONG
The strong suit of both clubs has
been in their mound staffs with
Stanford's Al Lazzarone and
"Cootie" Thompson coming through
a long series of practice games with
excellent base hit, earned run, and
strike-out averages. Frank Maderas
and Earl Johnson, two of the three
Gael aces, held the Orinda Reds to
live hits and no runs in their Sun
day championship encounter.
Chief weakness of the Indians to
date has been in the minor depart
ment of runs scored. Stanford has
been able to play good early season
defensive ball and has a crew of
hitters that already looks better
than that developed last season.
What they undoubtedly will need to
upset the Moragamen will be an
ability to drive out singles when
they mean runs. Twelve men died
on base last Saturday before Harry
Wolters' squad could score the four
runs needed to top San Jose State.
SOPHS TO START
At least three sophomores — and
maybe more—will be in the start
ing line-up. Monte Pl'yl has a tight
hold on second base and speedy Thor
Peterson in center field can't be
shaken. Herb Bull broke into a reg
ular short stop spot when Ike Boone
hurt his shoulder last week and will
probably get the opening call with
Soph Boone and Dick Shortall
lighting for third.
Two more lirst-year varsity men,
Bob Ditlevsen in left field and
Cookie South at first may also break
into the top line-up before game
time.
