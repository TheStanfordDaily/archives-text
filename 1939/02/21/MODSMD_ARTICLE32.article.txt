### 
Leading the Stanford delegation
in the qualifying round of the San
Francisco city golf championship,
Ray Watson shot a 74 this week-end
to cause city papers to name him a
prospective winner in the tourney.
Win Donham came through with a
70, followed closely by Frank Scheble
and Dick Wright with 77's. Jack
Showalter, Don Haslett, and Don
Kennedy squeezed through the
qualifying rounds with a 79 each.
Art Doering, ace Farm golfer, did
not enter the competition. Warren
Berl, who has been in the rest home,
will try his hand at the qualifica
tions tomorrow.
