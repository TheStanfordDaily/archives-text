# Frosh Ring Up Twelfth Win
## Hoopmen Trounce San Mateo 34-32 
### 
For some unexplainable reason,
the Farm's freshman cagers con
tinue to win basketball games, last
night's victory over San Mateo Jay
see being vetory No.- 12 by a score
of 34-22.
If it hadn't been for a first half
rout which ended 23-0, the year
lings might have ended up behind
the eight ball and lost their first
game in their last eight starts. As it
was, Bob Penn, Chuck Smith, and
company got a hold of their shoot
ing eyes in the first canto to get
away 1 to a big enough lead to assure
themselves of the game.
Apparently feeling too secure
with that comfortable lead, the
freshmen slipped in offensive
marksmanship and were ragged de
fensively. They saw the invaders
whittle their lead down to 28-22,
with less than five minutes to go.
Penn, who was high-point man
with 10 digits, sank the first frosh
field goal after the team had gone
scoreless for ten minutes. Then 01-
lie Hamlin took the ball away from
his opponent in the back court and
sank a sel-up. Pie ended up with a
short toss from 5 feet out.
Smith annexed runner-up hon
ors in scoring with nine points and
Hamlin had eight* the two guards
being particularly effective on long
range shots in the first half.
Everything went wrong with the
Papoose machine in the second pe
riod. Passing was far from accu
rate as the jaysee club stole the ball
continually away near the Stanford
basket and broke up numerous
scoring plays. At the same time the
frosh couldn't stop the sharp-shoot
ing of San Mateo's forwards and
center, who were sinking long and
short ones.
