SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 20 (UP).
â€”Oregon's grip on first place in the
Northern Division of the Pacific
Coast Conference basketball race
was shaking today under the threat
of the challenge of the University of
Washington Huskies.
Once considered a shoo-in for the
division title, Oregon lost ground
Saturday by dropping a 50-31 game
to Oregon State.
