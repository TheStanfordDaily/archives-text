# Ailing Hoopmen To Meet Ucla
## Rapp, Burness Still Uncertain Starters 
### 
Having set their goal at winning j
j three of Stanford's last four confer- i
ence games, the Indian basketball j
men resumed their drills in the Pa- 1
1 vilion yesterday as they prepped for
! this week-end's series with U.C.L.A. |
in Los Angeles.
Stanford winds up the 1939 season
! the following week-end with two j
! games against California. If the j
j Cards win both their games against I
! the Bruins, as they are favored to
| do, they can achieve their goal by
splitting the final Cal games.
It is unknown at present whether
! Bill Rapp and Don Burness will
j make the trip south against the
Uclans. Rapp was accidentally struck
j in the eye by Jack Morrison, Trojan
i forward, and had five stitches tak-
I en on the inside of his eyelid.
Despite the fact that Rapp was lv
| ing on the floor almost unconscious
: from the blow and pain the referee
failed to call time out because
Stanford didn't have possession of
the ball. Rapp finally had to crawl |
off the floor to keep from being j
hurt still further.
Burness, already suffering from!
one game knee, injured his good i
knee when he stopped suddenly, i
! Both these injuries occurred in the '
second half of Saturday's game.
Harlan Copsey and Kenny David
son played outstanding defensive
games against U.S.C., according to
Coach Everett Dean. Copsey re
bounded brilliantly in both games,
while Davidson held Ralph Vaughn,
dead-eye Troy forward, to four
lucky baskets in the second game.
In Friday's game Vaughn didn't get
a single bucket of! Davidson during
the first half, although he got hot
in the second period and dropped in
some sensational shots.
