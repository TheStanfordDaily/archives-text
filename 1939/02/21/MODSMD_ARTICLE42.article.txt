Phi Delta Phi opened the intra
mural basketball elimination tourna
ment among the champions of the 13
leagues by knocking off El Toro I,
19-15. Little Arch Zamloch led the
Phi Delta Phi attack, scoring 10 digits
and performing brilliantly on de
fense. El Toro was trailing 8-2 at
halftime and never really found its
eye until too late in the game.
Play was faster and cleaner be
cause two referees, Hamp Pool and
Bev Gubser, were handling this tilt.
Intramural Manager Andy Stojko
vich plans to use the two-referee
system in all championship games.
In the non-title contests of the
evening, S.A.E. ran roughshod over
Delta Tau Delta 11, 37-5, and Phi Psi
cinched its league title by turning
back Phi Sigma Kappa, 38-29.
In the S.A.E. triumph, Bob New
ell's total of 14 was high, while in the
latter match, A1 Vandenbos, per
forming for a losing quintet, still
was able to steal high point honors
with a good total of 19.
In intramural handball, El Capitan
forced its way into the quarter-finals
by virtue of a 21-7, 21-13 win over
Sequoia. Two other teams, Alpha
Delt and A.T.0., complete the list of
three teams that have already
reached a coveted position in this
round. Both these units arrived by
way of defaults while the remaining

place will be taken by the winner
of the Beta vs. Business School en-
counter.
So far 28 teams have signed up for
track, but Stojkovich expects the
total to reach 50 by the deadline
which is Friday, Feb. 24.

evening, S.A.E. ran roughshod over
Delta Tau Delta 11, 37-5, and Phi Psi
cinched its league title by turning
back Phi Sigma Kappa, 38-29.
In the S.A.E. triumph, Bob New
ell's total of 14 was high, while in the
latter match, A1 Vandenbos, per
forming for a losing quintet, still
was able to steal high point honors
with a good total of 19.
In intramural handball, El Capitan
forced its way into the quarter-finals
by virtue of a 21-7, 21-13 win over
Sequoia. Two other teams, Alpha
Delt and A.T.0., complete the list of
three teams that have already
reached a coveted position in this
round. Both these units arrived by
way of defaults while the remaining

place will be taken by the winner
of the Beta vs. Business School en-
counter.
So far 28 teams have signed up for
track, but Stojkovich expects the
total to reach 50 by the deadline
which is Friday, Feb. 24.

halftime and never really found its
