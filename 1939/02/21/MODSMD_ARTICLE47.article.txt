# Don't Take It Seriously
## 
### 
LITTLE WALDO was pretty perturbed. He
was walking over to afternoon class and it
sort of had him on a spot.
Of course, the fact that he had a class didn't
bother him. What did he go to class for, if not
to catch up on the work for other classes? Or,
lacking that, eye the gal in the next row whom
he hadn't yet asked for a date?
What he was pretty worried about, how
ever, was the amazing number of problems
that was confronting, not him, but the rest of
the student body and the University.
Now, Little Waldo was no reformer; in a
few words, he was pretty content with things
the way they were.
After all, didn't it feel like spring, even if it
was only February? He'd tried to tell people
how silly that part of it was; but they were too
busy talking about the one-way glass effect
at Sally Rand's.
So, he'd mentally shrugged his shoulders
and taken a hitch in his amazement and gotten
himself under control on that one.
But what really stopped him was the se
quence of events that prevented him from
taking an afternoon off last week when he had
thought something of going on a coke date to
the cellar.
It seemed that he'd had to go down and take
a look around one of the departments to see
if there was any truth to the rumor that it was
in a pretty bad way from the standpoint of
materials and safety protection and related
subjects.
And when an answer came to a strategically
timed knock on the department head's door,
Little Waldo felt a peculiar sensation in the
region more commonly known as his stomach.
He had leered cautiously around the door
jamb—his buck-teeth were chattering a Krupa
beat. Being a young man of some quick wit,
however, he responded with the trumpet pick
up to "Bolero at the Savoy," thus saving face
but not dignity.
"Anything to say about such-and-such?" he
asked, getting down to brass tacks, but not
actually sitting on them.
"Enough's been said about that already,"
the Presence roared back astutely, clearing his
conveniently trained throat.
Which ruined another good news story for
Little Waldo, even though it did have a point.
And even though Little Waldo did know
enough about the situation to go ahead and
print a hot one anyway.
He had reported back to the hot-shots who
thought they knew how to run a newspaper
and told them about the whole thing.
"Naw, we can't say anything about that,"
somebody said, his mind obviously on some
thing else—preferably the new blonde tryoutee
he thought could take shorthand and would
make a tremendous secretary.
Little Waldo left, shaking his curly locks.
Couldn't those guys get excited about any
thing? And it hurt him even worse when they
turned a deaf ear to his taking off on the $10,000
to be spent for the boathouse; to lighting into
Scabbard and Blade for losing money on their
dance—damn militarists, they deserve a poke,
anyway.
What about the way every other half-baked
organization was taking the A.S.S.U. for dough,
anyway?
And, who cares about all these little details,
when there's so damn much wrong with the
world outside Stanford?
The whole student body should take up a few
fights and give 'em all a hand. Boy, oh boy,
think v/hat Stanford could do if it ever got
started. There'd be no stopping it. Nobody'd
want to. Least of all the city papers, who knew
that Stanford, plus co-eds, pretty, refined ones
and pretty, not-so-refined ones, plus a situation
were fine stories to dish out to morning break
fast tables.
leez, that would be swell.
Little Waldo was all excited by this time —
he even started gesturing; thereby insulting a
passing professor who thought Little Waldo
was thumbing a stubby nose at him.
Little Waldo didn't notice that it was the
prof from whom he had intended to get an A.
Little Waldo was in a terrific fix—as a mat
ter of fact, he was in a hell of a way.
He'd thought of all these things separately
at vaiious times, but they'd never struck him
all at once before.
At this point, the little man stumbled into his

classroom, rather more vacantly than efficiently.
For the record, it might be said that he didn't
pay too much attention to the prof who soon
arose and began to read combination lecture
notes and text-book quotations.
By this time, Little Waldo was feeling un
happy indeed. He was in a fix, a real fix, to
repeat a little.
And there was only one solution he could
think of—that wasn't a real solution, but at least
it was a comfort.
It was a little poem he'd read—it wasn't
meant to be funny, it wasn't meant to belittle
events, but it seemed to fit the situation:
"Life is a glorious cycle of song,
A medley of extemporania,
Life is a thing that can never go wrong
—And I am Marie of Rumania."

materials and safety protection and related
subjects.
And when an answer came to a strategically
timed knock on the department head's door,
Little Waldo felt a peculiar sensation in the
region more commonly known as his stomach.
He had leered cautiously around the door
jamb—his buck-teeth were chattering a Krupa
beat. Being a young man of some quick wit,
however, he responded with the trumpet pick
up to "Bolero at the Savoy," thus saving face
but not dignity.
"Anything to say about such-and-such?" he
asked, getting down to brass tacks, but not
actually sitting on them.
"Enough's been said about that already,"
the Presence roared back astutely, clearing his
conveniently trained throat.
Which ruined another good news story for
Little Waldo, even though it did have a point.
And even though Little Waldo did know
enough about the situation to go ahead and
print a hot one anyway.
He had reported back to the hot-shots who
thought they knew how to run a newspaper
and told them about the whole thing.
"Naw, we can't say anything about that,"
somebody said, his mind obviously on some
thing else—preferably the new blonde tryoutee
he thought could take shorthand and would
make a tremendous secretary.
Little Waldo left, shaking his curly locks.
Couldn't those guys get excited about any
thing? And it hurt him even worse when they
turned a deaf ear to his taking off on the $10,000
to be spent for the boathouse; to lighting into
Scabbard and Blade for losing money on their
dance—damn militarists, they deserve a poke,
anyway.
What about the way every other half-baked
organization was taking the A.S.S.U. for dough,
anyway?
And, who cares about all these little details,
when there's so damn much wrong with the
world outside Stanford?
The whole student body should take up a few
fights and give 'em all a hand. Boy, oh boy,
think v/hat Stanford could do if it ever got
started. There'd be no stopping it. Nobody'd
want to. Least of all the city papers, who knew
that Stanford, plus co-eds, pretty, refined ones
and pretty, not-so-refined ones, plus a situation
were fine stories to dish out to morning break
fast tables.
leez, that would be swell.
Little Waldo was all excited by this time —
he even started gesturing; thereby insulting a
passing professor who thought Little Waldo
was thumbing a stubby nose at him.
Little Waldo didn't notice that it was the
prof from whom he had intended to get an A.
Little Waldo was in a terrific fix—as a mat
ter of fact, he was in a hell of a way.
He'd thought of all these things separately
at vaiious times, but they'd never struck him
all at once before.
At this point, the little man stumbled into his

classroom, rather more vacantly than efficiently.
For the record, it might be said that he didn't
pay too much attention to the prof who soon
arose and began to read combination lecture
notes and text-book quotations.
By this time, Little Waldo was feeling un
happy indeed. He was in a fix, a real fix, to
repeat a little.
And there was only one solution he could
think of—that wasn't a real solution, but at least
it was a comfort.
It was a little poem he'd read—it wasn't
meant to be funny, it wasn't meant to belittle
events, but it seemed to fit the situation:
"Life is a glorious cycle of song,
A medley of extemporania,
Life is a thing that can never go wrong
—And I am Marie of Rumania."
LITTLE WALDO was pretty perturbed. He
was walking over to afternoon class and it
sort of had him on a spot.
Of course, the fact that he had a class didn't
bother him. What did he go to class for, if not
to catch up on the work for other classes? Or,
lacking that, eye the gal in the next row whom
he hadn't yet asked for a date?
What he was pretty worried about, how
ever, was the amazing number of problems
that was confronting, not him, but the rest of
the student body and the University.
Now, Little Waldo was no reformer; in a
few words, he was pretty content with things
the way they were.
After all, didn't it feel like spring, even if it
was only February? He'd tried to tell people
how silly that part of it was; but they were too
busy talking about the one-way glass effect
at Sally Rand's.
So, he'd mentally shrugged his shoulders
and taken a hitch in his amazement and gotten
himself under control on that one.
But what really stopped him was the se
quence of events that prevented him from
taking an afternoon off last week when he had
thought something of going on a coke date to
the cellar.
It seemed that he'd had to go down and take
a look around one of the departments to see
if there was any truth to the rumor that it was
in a pretty bad way from the standpoint of
materials and safety protection and related
subjects.

turned a deaf ear to his taking off on the $10,000
to be spent for the boathouse; to lighting into
Scabbard and Blade for losing money on their
dance—damn militarists, they deserve a poke,
anyway.
What about the way every other half-baked
organization was taking the A.S.S.U. for dough,
anyway?
And, who cares about all these little details,
when there's so damn much wrong with the
world outside Stanford?
The whole student body should take up a few
fights and give 'em all a hand. Boy, oh boy,
think v/hat Stanford could do if it ever got
started. There'd be no stopping it. Nobody'd
want to. Least of all the city papers, who knew
that Stanford, plus co-eds, pretty, refined ones
and pretty, not-so-refined ones, plus a situation
were fine stories to dish out to morning break
fast tables.
leez, that would be swell.
Little Waldo was all excited by this time —
he even started gesturing; thereby insulting a
passing professor who thought Little Waldo
was thumbing a stubby nose at him.
Little Waldo didn't notice that it was the
prof from whom he had intended to get an A.
Little Waldo was in a terrific fix—as a mat
ter of fact, he was in a hell of a way.
He'd thought of all these things separately
at vaiious times, but they'd never struck him
all at once before.
At this point, the little man stumbled into his

classroom, rather more vacantly than efficiently.
For the record, it might be said that he didn't
pay too much attention to the prof who soon
arose and began to read combination lecture
notes and text-book quotations.
By this time, Little Waldo was feeling un
happy indeed. He was in a fix, a real fix, to
repeat a little.
And there was only one solution he could
think of—that wasn't a real solution, but at least
it was a comfort.
It was a little poem he'd read—it wasn't
meant to be funny, it wasn't meant to belittle
events, but it seemed to fit the situation:
"Life is a glorious cycle of song,
A medley of extemporania,
Life is a thing that can never go wrong
—And I am Marie of Rumania."
LITTLE WALDO was pretty perturbed. He
was walking over to afternoon class and it
sort of had him on a spot.
Of course, the fact that he had a class didn't
bother him. What did he go to class for, if not
to catch up on the work for other classes? Or,
lacking that, eye the gal in the next row whom
he hadn't yet asked for a date?
What he was pretty worried about, how
ever, was the amazing number of problems
that was confronting, not him, but the rest of
the student body and the University.
Now, Little Waldo was no reformer; in a
few words, he was pretty content with things
the way they were.
After all, didn't it feel like spring, even if it
was only February? He'd tried to tell people
how silly that part of it was; but they were too
busy talking about the one-way glass effect
at Sally Rand's.
So, he'd mentally shrugged his shoulders
and taken a hitch in his amazement and gotten
himself under control on that one.
But what really stopped him was the se
quence of events that prevented him from
taking an afternoon off last week when he had
thought something of going on a coke date to
the cellar.
It seemed that he'd had to go down and take
a look around one of the departments to see
if there was any truth to the rumor that it was
in a pretty bad way from the standpoint of
materials and safety protection and related
subjects.
And when an answer came to a strategically
timed knock on the department head's door,
Little Waldo felt a peculiar sensation in the
region more commonly known as his stomach.
He had leered cautiously around the door
jamb—his buck-teeth were chattering a Krupa
beat. Being a young man of some quick wit,
however, he responded with the trumpet pick
up to "Bolero at the Savoy," thus saving face
but not dignity.
"Anything to say about such-and-such?" he
asked, getting down to brass tacks, but not
actually sitting on them.
"Enough's been said about that already,"
the Presence roared back astutely, clearing his
conveniently trained throat.
Which ruined another good news story for
Little Waldo, even though it did have a point.
And even though Little Waldo did know
enough about the situation to go ahead and
print a hot one anyway.
He had reported back to the hot-shots who
thought they knew how to run a newspaper
and told them about the whole thing.
"Naw, we can't say anything about that,"
somebody said, his mind obviously on some
thing else—preferably the new blonde tryoutee
he thought could take shorthand and would
make a tremendous secretary.
Little Waldo left, shaking his curly locks.
