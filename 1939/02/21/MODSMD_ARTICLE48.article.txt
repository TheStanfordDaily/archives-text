# BULL SESSION
## REVOLT OF THE ANGELS 
### JOHN COBBS 
IN THE old days whenever one of the proletariat got
ambitious, it was customary for him to hunt up a
faiiy godmother or a patron saint and put things in
her hands. At Stanford today, whenever a minor or
ganization reads Horatio Alger and takes it seriously,
it goes around to Ex Committee. In most cases the
results of the two methods of attack have been sur
prisingly similar.
For a number of years now, Ex Committee has
been playing rich uncle to an assortment of campus
groups, most of them comparatively unknown. Usu
ally the philanthropy has worked out well, but re
cently the ambitions of the petitioners have picked up
so much momentum that the Committee can't keep up
with them. Excom is working around to the idea that
even fairy godmothers shouldn't have to work more
than union hours.
»jt $ ;|: J|t
I have no intention of trying to take any of the
shine off the glory of charity. There is an enthusiastic
editorial in the Bible that covers the subject very
well, and I am willing to accept that as authority. But
I am glad to see the committee slowing up on its
Santa Claus policy.
Last weekend, we had a nasty lesson in the eco
nomics of benevolence. Scabbard and Blade was grant
ed a big name orchestra dance because it wanted to
boom its stock on the campus. The ambition was
worthy; the dance was gloriously impressive. In fact,
everything was in perfect shape except the gate re
ceipts. The A.S.S.U. went down something like $500,
which is a high price to pay even for that spiritual
glow that comes with doing a good turn.
* «! # *
IJROBABLY as many factors contributed to the finan
cial failure of the Military Ball as contributed to
the fall of Rome. But the main reason was simply that
Scabbard and Blade is too small an organization to
back a big time dance.
If Ex Committee were asked to do the patron saint
act for only one organization a year, things wouldn't
be too bad. But there are at least a dozen organiza
tions each quarter which come around quoting the
parable of the good Samaritan.

A week or .so ago the Glee Club made an impas
sioned plea for a closed week-end night in spring quar
ter. I don't doubt that the Glee Club is a worthy or
ganization, that its harmonies are irreproachable, that
its members are Christian gentlemen who are kind to
their mothers. But in interest for the ordinary student
the club ranks somewhat below the record machine in
the Union cellar. To give it a closed week-end would
force the students to support it at the expense of
entertainment they really want.
Fortunately Ex Committee was tiring of the god
mother vole by the time the Glee Club put the bite on
it. And so I am saved from a forced contribution to
the local theaters. But there are other organizations
that consider the A.S.S.U. an easy jackpot.
After looking over my stub account and inventory
ing my reserves of patience, I have decided to offer a
fervent prayer that Ex Committee will continue its
heart-of-stone policy. There is a saturation point even
for charity.

Santa Claus policy.
Last weekend, we had a nasty lesson in the eco
nomics of benevolence. Scabbard and Blade was grant
ed a big name orchestra dance because it wanted to
boom its stock on the campus. The ambition was
worthy; the dance was gloriously impressive. In fact,
everything was in perfect shape except the gate re
ceipts. The A.S.S.U. went down something like $500,
which is a high price to pay even for that spiritual
glow that comes with doing a good turn.
* «! # *
IJROBABLY as many factors contributed to the finan
cial failure of the Military Ball as contributed to
the fall of Rome. But the main reason was simply that
Scabbard and Blade is too small an organization to
back a big time dance.
If Ex Committee were asked to do the patron saint
act for only one organization a year, things wouldn't
be too bad. But there are at least a dozen organiza
tions each quarter which come around quoting the
parable of the good Samaritan.

A week or .so ago the Glee Club made an impas
sioned plea for a closed week-end night in spring quar
ter. I don't doubt that the Glee Club is a worthy or
ganization, that its harmonies are irreproachable, that
its members are Christian gentlemen who are kind to
their mothers. But in interest for the ordinary student
the club ranks somewhat below the record machine in
the Union cellar. To give it a closed week-end would
force the students to support it at the expense of
entertainment they really want.
Fortunately Ex Committee was tiring of the god
mother vole by the time the Glee Club put the bite on
it. And so I am saved from a forced contribution to
the local theaters. But there are other organizations
that consider the A.S.S.U. an easy jackpot.
After looking over my stub account and inventory
ing my reserves of patience, I have decided to offer a
fervent prayer that Ex Committee will continue its
heart-of-stone policy. There is a saturation point even
for charity.
IN THE old days whenever one of the proletariat got
ambitious, it was customary for him to hunt up a
faiiy godmother or a patron saint and put things in
her hands. At Stanford today, whenever a minor or
ganization reads Horatio Alger and takes it seriously,
it goes around to Ex Committee. In most cases the
results of the two methods of attack have been sur
prisingly similar.
For a number of years now, Ex Committee has
been playing rich uncle to an assortment of campus
groups, most of them comparatively unknown. Usu
ally the philanthropy has worked out well, but re
cently the ambitions of the petitioners have picked up
so much momentum that the Committee can't keep up
with them. Excom is working around to the idea that
even fairy godmothers shouldn't have to work more
than union hours.
»jt $ ;|: J|t
I have no intention of trying to take any of the
shine off the glory of charity. There is an enthusiastic
editorial in the Bible that covers the subject very
well, and I am willing to accept that as authority. But
I am glad to see the committee slowing up on its
Santa Claus policy.
