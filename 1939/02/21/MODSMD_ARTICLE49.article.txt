I hear that up at the Fair Saturday the following
message came over the loud speaker in Sally Hand's
nude ranch just before midnight:
"Will all those who have been here since 10 o'clock
this morning please leave so that the people outside
can come in?"

DEAR ( A.MPI S OPINION

One of the Farm boys was working at the DuPont
exhibition at the Fair Saturday demonstrating a
paint gun.
He gathered his crowd around, got out the gun,
and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He pulled
it again. The card he was going to cover with paint
for the crowd remained a virginal white. He tried
again, frantically.
A quiet voice from the crowd said, "Why don't
you turn the gun around?"
He looked down. His coatsleeve was sovered with
paint.

A guy turned in a lab report in an engineering
course last week, and in the report he spelled the
word procedure, "proceedure."
The prof, in checking over the report, was on his
toes. He caught the error. And corrected itâ€”by
crossing out, the "c" and substituting an "s."

I have never been quite so inhibited. Here with the
deadline 20 minutes off and nothing to write, I have
throe beautiful stories, none of which I can print.
There's the one about a guy and a bathrobe and a
room and a girl's brother.
There's the one about the professor who us allergic
to a certain fraternity.
There's the one about a Plutonic romance.
Beautiful. And I can't print them.

Of course there is the story about the Farm girls
who went to Yosemite last week-end. They had no
clear idea at all where Yosemite is, but they got out
a map and figured up very scientifically which the
shortest way was. And ended up by taking a Stage
Coach trail.
But that's just dumb.

BLANK STINKS.
