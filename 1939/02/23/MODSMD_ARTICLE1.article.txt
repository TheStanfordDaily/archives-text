### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
jL* VEU since the big scare iast Sep
tember, the of Europe
have been eyeing each other ner
vously, watching to see who will
take the fatal step toward war. At
one time it seemed that Germany
would light the fuse by moving into
the Ukraine; at another, the world
looked for trouble in Mussolini s
demands on French territory in
North Africa.
It seems that those who put their
money on a scrap between Italy and
France on the south side of the
Mediterranean had read the right
racing form. Today rumors are
drifting from mysterious Northern
Africa, rumors that report a clash
between French and Italian troops
in southern Tunisia in which 84 were
killed.
<1 n* >t'<
'TRUE it is that the news of the
fracas is a bit indefinite and
has received no confirmation from
official sources, but meetings of
France's military chiefs in Alge
ria and Italy's in Lybia lend om
inous authority to the report.
Colonial troops of both nations
arc being mobilized, and Paris and
Rome are busy filling rush orders
for reinforcements.
The unauthorized version of the
battle tells of an Italian force cross
ing the Tunisian border from Lybia
and, as was only to be expected,
running smack into a detachment of
French legionnaires. However, Mus
solini's aggressors got their fingers
burned—ltalians dead, 80; French
dead, 4.

]Y|ORE important than whether
" these 84 colonial soldiers arc
dead or alive is the highly explosive
situation which must exist in North
Africa if it is capable of producing
such a report. Everyone knows that
France's rights and Italy's ambitions
in the Mediterranean area are can
cers on the breast of peace.
The world awaits the answers
to two questions. Is any of Eu
rope's diplomats skillful enough
to remove the malignant growths?
Is it too late to save the life of
peace?

/ |NCE again Japan and China
have burst into the news spot
light. It was apparent that all was
not well when a Japanese plane
dumped a bomb on British territory
at Hongkong Tuesday. Today there
is cause for alarm in an ultimatum
which Tokyo has laid before the
Municipal Council of the Shanghai
International Settlement.
Immediate suppression of Chinese
terrorism in this area and increased
representation on the Council form
the chief demands of Nipponese
military leaders, who can be ver>
aggressive when the situation de
mands it.

OROBING beneath the imper
turbability of their Oriental
exteriors, it seems that what the
Japanese want is complete control
of the Shanghai area, which means
exclusion of the Chinese and all
but nominal exclusion of the Eu
ropean and American powers rep
resented in the International Set
tlement.
Indications are that those in con
trol at present are not entirely will
ing to give away their national anc
open-door rights without fighting
for them. So in this troubled cor
ner of the troubled world, we fine
troops mobilizing, strange member.'
of the species homo sapiens prepar
ing to destroy themselves because
of a curious institution called na
tionality.

Twenty squadrons of Germany':
crack bombers are flying across the
Atlantic. They land in Brazil in ac
cordance • wilh an internationa
agreement, refuel, and pick up ad
ditional arms. Using a prcarrangec
island in the Carribean as a base, the
bombers head for Texas, Louisiana
Florida. The United States is at
tacked by Germany.
Imagine!
Although this story may smack
of Jules Verne and the Sunday
supplements, the danger docs ex
ist. Yesterday Chairman Morris
I). Shcpard of the Senate Military
Affairs Committee revealed that
defenses on the southern coast of
the United States arc inadequate,
and the nation is completely vul
nerable to attack from that quar
ter.
JpEAR e>f invasion of the Unitec
States by an anti-Dcmocratii
power has its root in the growing
influence of Germany and Italy ir
South America. Both Hitler anc
Mussolini have sold enormous num
bers of planes to our southern neigh
bors, and it is whispered that the]
are at the same time establishinj
fuel, munition, and replacement re
serves where they can be used t<
attack the United States.
IN PARIS yesterday Ambassado
William Bullitt tactfully told th
leaders of the French govemmen
that the United States cannot isolat
herself from European problems, an
in case of trouble she is sure t
come to the aid of France.
