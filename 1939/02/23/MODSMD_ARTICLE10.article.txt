# M.I.T. Physicists Will Study Practical Uses of klystron
## 
### 
A sixteen-inch model of the klystron, Stanford's most famed recent
scientific invention, has been taken to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where distinguished physicists are conducting experiments in
which the ultra short waves generated by the instrument are used. J. R.
Woodyard of Stanford accompanied the klystron east to assemble it.

â–º The inventors of the instrument,
Sigurd and Russell Varian, research
associates in physics, and William W.
Hansen, associate professor of phys
ics, also have a smaller working
model of the klystron in the campus
physics laboratory, in addition to the
original instrument, which Professor
Hansen uses to obtain powerful
voltages with which to smash
atoms.
Wide interest in the new inven
tion is indicated by the flood of in
quiries which followed announce
ment of the development of the in
strument, patents for which have
been given to the Spen-y Gyro-
I scope Corporation. Communications
[ asking for additional information
have even come from European
countries.
Sigurd Varian, former Pan-
American Airways pilot who came
to Stanford to work on the inven
tion, is still recuperating from the
months of physical and mental strain
! which preceded the announcement
!of the instrument's completion. As
his brother Russell, aided by Pro
fessor David Webster, developed
the parts of the klystron in theory.
Sigurd turned them out on the
lathe.
Experimentation with the klystron
at M.I.T. is shrouded with secrecy
a necessaxy precaution before any
developments are ready for publie
release, and it is believed that the
next significant announcement ir
j regard to the practical applicatior
i of the instrument will come frorr
j the eastern laboratories.
