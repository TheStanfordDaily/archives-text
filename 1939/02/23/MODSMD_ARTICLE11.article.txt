## Jungle Explorations Described by Author 
### 
Lion hunting on the South African
veldt and exploring in the heart of
the Brazilian jungle were described
by Kermit Roosevelt, famous ex
plorer, author, and world traveler,
and son of the former President, who
spoke Tuesday night before a large'
audience in Memorial Hall audi
torium.
Lecturing on "Hunting and Ex
ploring in Africa anel Brazil," the
speaker related his experiences dur
ing more than 30 years of roving the
earth in a program of 1 lie Tuesday
Evening Series.
"Trailing the African lion is the
greatest of all sports, for this animal
is the most dangerous of the big
game animals," declared Mr. Rcx>se
vclt, who explained that "the most
thrilling sight" he ever witnessed
was that of watching his father, the
famous "Teddy" Roosevelt, being
charged by a wounded lion.
"Africa is real hunting country,
and big game of all kinds is plenti
ful." assorted the explorer, who ex
plained that Brazil is relatively l>ar
ren, and that in that South American
republic "one cannot live off the
country, for game is quite scarce."
Danger of being attacked by Afri
can beasts of prey is augmented by
the constant threat of the dread
tsetse fly, the bite of which can
bring almost instantaneous death to
both men and horses, according to
the speaker. "Since these flies, which
bite only during the daytime, live in
rather narrow belts, one must march
through these "fly belts" at night,
and, if this is done, you are perfectly
safe," stated Mr. Roosevelt.
