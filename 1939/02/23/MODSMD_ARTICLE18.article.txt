# Benefactress Interviewed
## Esteem of Stanford Prompts Many Many Gifts 
### JACK BURTT 
Mrs. Louis Stem lives in Palo;
Alto, about a mile from the Stanford j
campus, yet she has done more for (
i this university than have any but a
! few individuals who live on cam- ;
1 pus.
1 Though she has no direct connec
tion with the University, she has
, long been interested in the work
i here and in those who cany on
! this work.
Somehow, she learned of the
great need for a research laboratory
building at the Medical School in
! San Francisco. And so today she is
i actively directing construction of this
building. She donated funds, picked
her architects, and told them to go
| ahead.
The high regard which she holds
for Stanford is carried out in the
j "Stanford Room" of her Palo Alto
I home. There, she has covered the
four walls with photographs of
: prominent faculty men, outstanding
'■ graduates, members of the football
I squads and prominent students. A
J large Stanford seal hangs over the
j door.
From this room, Mrs. Stern has di
rected a long list of benefactions.
Many students have been aided
through the Ruth Stern Loan Fund,
available to undergraduates. Fel-
I lowships have been granted to out
j standing graduate students, some of
| whom have been enabled to go
j abroad for study.
Interviewed in regard to her lat
i est donation to Stanford, Mrs. Stem
| said, "When I saw Lane Hospital I
was impressed with the crowded
j conditions there. Patients' beds were
! pushed into small spaces, and re
i search facilities were generally old
and inadequate.
"I sincerely hope that addition of
a modern laboratory will aid in pro
ducing even more medical research
than is produced at present. Stan
ford's medical school can do work
which will be of immeasurable
i value to humanity as a whole."
