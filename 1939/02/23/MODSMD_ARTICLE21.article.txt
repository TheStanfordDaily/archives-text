# Medical Building Given Stanford
## Mrs, Stern Donates New Research Laboratory |To Honor Daughter Ruth Five-month Construction Project Will Begin This Spring; Should Be Ready for Use by Autumn Quarter 
### 
A modem laboratory building, specifically designed for medical re
search. has been presented to the University by Mi's. Louis Stern of Palo
Alto, according to announcement made this week by President Kay Lyman
Wilbur.
The laboratory will be built in San Francisco as an addition to the
Stanford School of Medicine. Mrs. Stern has presented the building in the

►name ot her daughter, and the build
ing will be named the "Ruth Lucie
Stern Research Building."
Construction of the building will
begin about April 1, according to the
architects, David B. Clark and Birgc
M. Clark of Palo Alto. Construction
will require about five months, they
pointed out, which will allow com
pletion of the structure before fall
quarter of this year.
FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
Chief feature of the functional de
sign of the building will be grouping
of supporting columns, stairways,
and elevator shaft in the center of
the building, leaving areas around
the outside of the building adjacent
to huge windows unobstructed by
structural members. These areas
will be adapted for laboratory use,
affording clear space for sinks and
apparatus.
Another feature is that it will be
possible to erect temporary parti
tions in this area, creating labora
tories of any desired size. To in
crease efficiency, these partitions
may be shifted to expand small
laboratories or to make many small
j labs out of large ones afi needed.
To attain this functionalism, Ar
chitects Bilge M. and David B. Clark
i of Palo Alto have made use of the
j cantilever principle of construction.
; The exterior wall of the building will
j be unbroken except for two columns
! at the front and rear, allowing a con
tinuous glass panel around the build
ing.
The building will be used exclu
sively for research. Administrative
offices and lobby space have been
| omitted from the design and all floor
space will be occupied by six large
laboratories and 25 small labora
tories, with rooms for housing rats,
mice and guinea pigs.
The Ruth Lucie Stern Research


Stanford's new center (
of medical research,
presented by Mrs. Louis
Stern and named for
her daughter, Ruth, is
shown in an architect's
drawing. The modern
glass - paneled building,
which will stand oppo
site the Stanford Hospi
tal in San Francisco,
will present a striking
contrast to the old med
ical school buildings
where work is now car
ried on in cramped
quarters.
Building will constitute a unit of the
Medical School group. In this unit,
research "tudents will explore new
fields, while their discoveries are
utilized in the hospital and teaching
units of the school.
In these quarters, Stanford re
search will go forward in such fields
as cancer, neurology, infantile paral
ysis, childhood tuberculosis and oth
er phases of pediatrics, public health
problems, and other fields of inves
tigation. »
Medical research at Stanford, Dr.
Wilbur pointed out, is financed in
large part by gifts or special grants.
The Rockefeller Foundation last year
granted $50,000 to the Medical School
as a fluid five-year fund to support
the type of work which will be car
ried on in the Ruth Stern Building.
The Foundation further allocated
$5,000 a year, contingent upon equal
funds being contributed to the Uni
versity from other sources.
There also has been another recent
gift, Dr. Wilbur said, of $5,000 by
Else Schilling of San Francisco to
the Agnes Ltmme Schilling Fund
for medical research or fellowships.
