# New Addition Considered For Hospital
## Proposed Increase In Capacity Awaits O.K. of City Council 
### 
An addition to the Palo Alto Hos
pital, based oil the general plan re
cently submitted by the board of
works, may be built this year, pres
ent conditions indicate.
The proposal was discussed at a
joint meeting of the board and the
city council's committees on public
works and finance this week and at
that time the construction program
was favorably considered. Definite
recommendations for presentation to
the governing body will be formu
lated by these two committees.
SPEEDY JOB NECESSARY
In the event the council puts its
approval on the plans, the board of
works is prepared to accept bids.
Counting on the utmost speed, it is
estimated the job could be finished
in nine months.
Total cost of constructing the pro
posed enlargement is $279,787, but it
has been suggested by the board that
the expense could be reduced to
$174,232 by crossing off several items
for the present time. These would
include finishing the first and second
floors, air-conditioning four rooms,
alterations, children's ward and ar
chitect's fees. t
EARCE AREA INCREASE
As now planned, the addition to
the hospital will bring an increase of
about 20 per cent in area and 43 per
cent more private rooms than was
first contemplated, according to in
formation supplied the council.
Proposing to finish two floors at
the time of construction, it is esti
mated there will be thirty-three beds
added to the institution, making a
total of 113 available.
