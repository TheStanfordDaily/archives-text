# Prom Cancelled As Name Band Not Available
## Senior Excom Delay Eliminates Chance To Sign Gene Krupa 
### 
Cancellation of the Senior Prom
because of inability to obtain a "big
name" band was revealed last night
by Chuck Prince, chairman of the
committee in charge of the dance.
The Prom had been scheduled for
March 10.
At its Feb. 9 meeting, Senior Ex
ecutive Committee decided not to
hold the Prom unless a well-known
band could be signed.
Because this group's approval was
necessary to begin making arrange
ments for a band, Prince was unable
to stall work immediately following
Ex Committee's granting of the date
at its meeting of January 10.
"If I had been able to go ahead at
that time," Prince said, "there was a
good possibility that Gene Krupa
could have been signed."
The delay, however, Prince con
tinued, killed this possibility.
Most prominent bands brought up
for consideration at the meeting of
Senior Excom were those of Skin
nay Ennis and John Scott Trotter, he
revealed.
Because of his current contract,
Ennis was not available, and the
price asked for Trotter's band wat
prohibitive. Budget for Prom musie
is $1000.
According to Prince, there is still
a possibility that the Prom will be
helel sometime in spring quarter.
"I don't want it next quarter," lie
said, "because the jam-up on dates
presents a strong doubt as to whethei
or not we will make any money."
