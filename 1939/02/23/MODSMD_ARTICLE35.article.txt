"Baseball teams lhat make too
many errors and can't hit will not
win many ball games ..." Anony- j
mous.

SOMEBODY, in a moment ol
deep thought, gave birth to the
above axiom. Maybe he was think
ing of the Stanford baseball squad,
which still can annex the confer
ence baseball flag if it takes heed
of the sage who wrote the aiore- j
mentioned short, short story.
For a long time, during the St.
Mary's-Stanford set-to yesterday,
the young Injuns tried to prove that
they could muff the onion, fan the
breeze with their bludgeons, and
still annex an undeserved victory. :
A couple of conniving Gaels ruined
their little plot in telling fashion.
Their scheme is something like a
fellow jumping out of a second
story window and praying that he
will go up instead of down. Both !
are due for a stiff j<xlt.
But the young 'uns shouldn't be
discouraged. It took a top team ten ;
rounds to K.O. them yesterday. The !
unfortunate thing is the lact that
so much of the blame invariably |
falls on the pitchers, than whom j
there are none better than Stanford's j
Al Lazzarone and Cootie Thompson, j
"Lazz" didn't give the Gaels an j
earned run yesterday and scattered j
their seven hits like a wind-blown
bob.
if the defeat doesn't numb them
too much, you can look for the In- j
dians to whap Santa Clara by seven j
or eight runs when they meet again |
Saturday.
THE NA.VIE of Stanford's boxing
coach is Clayton Frye in case this
new wonder man hasn't yet at- >
traded your attention. Sometimes j
he looks like a boxei and sometimes 1
he looks like a gentleman. In real
life, he is just about six of one j
and half a dozen of the other. His
shut-out over U.C.L.A. last Satur
day should annihilate any doubt
about his tutoring ability.
Frye never lets a man take one •
punch in the ring when it looks as
if he might be approaching a state of ;
grogginess. Other less wise pugs are j
content to let their charges absorb j
an absolute maximum of punish- j
ment before they stop the slaughter.
The little Bruin fighter who was j
knocked cold for live minutes the I
other night by Bruce Berg might be
a case in point. Berg was doing only j
what any other competitor would
naturally attempt, but the Bruin |
mentor either forgot to notice when j
his boy first got hurt or he didn't '
have the foresight to throw in the i
towel.
Intercollegiate boxing is a swell!
sport and thrilling to watch; still
there's nothing much worse than I
seeing a nice kid fall over back- i
wards, light on his head, and then I
not move for two or three minutes, j
Kinda brings the cold chills, doesn't ;
it?

THE NA.VIE of Stanford's boxing
coach is Clayton Frye in case this
new wonder man hasn't yet at- >
traded your attention. Sometimes j
he looks like a boxei and sometimes 1
he looks like a gentleman. In real
life, he is just about six of one j
and half a dozen of the other. His
shut-out over U.C.L.A. last Satur
day should annihilate any doubt
about his tutoring ability.
Frye never lets a man take one •
punch in the ring when it looks as
if he might be approaching a state of ;
grogginess. Other less wise pugs are j
content to let their charges absorb j
an absolute maximum of punish- j
ment before they stop the slaughter.
The little Bruin fighter who was j
knocked cold for live minutes the I
other night by Bruce Berg might be
a case in point. Berg was doing only j
what any other competitor would
naturally attempt, but the Bruin |
mentor either forgot to notice when j
his boy first got hurt or he didn't '
have the foresight to throw in the i
towel.
Intercollegiate boxing is a swell!
sport and thrilling to watch; still
there's nothing much worse than I
seeing a nice kid fall over back- i
wards, light on his head, and then I
not move for two or three minutes, j
Kinda brings the cold chills, doesn't ;
it?
"Baseball teams lhat make too
many errors and can't hit will not
win many ball games ..." Anony- j

SOMEBODY, in a moment ol
deep thought, gave birth to the
above axiom. Maybe he was think
ing of the Stanford baseball squad,
which still can annex the confer
ence baseball flag if it takes heed
of the sage who wrote the aiore- j
mentioned short, short story.
For a long time, during the St.
Mary's-Stanford set-to yesterday,
the young Injuns tried to prove that
they could muff the onion, fan the
breeze with their bludgeons, and
still annex an undeserved victory. :
A couple of conniving Gaels ruined
their little plot in telling fashion.
Their scheme is something like a
fellow jumping out of a second
story window and praying that he
will go up instead of down. Both !
are due for a stiff j<xlt.
But the young 'uns shouldn't be
discouraged. It took a top team ten ;
rounds to K.O. them yesterday. The !
unfortunate thing is the lact that
so much of the blame invariably |
falls on the pitchers, than whom j
there are none better than Stanford's j
Al Lazzarone and Cootie Thompson, j
"Lazz" didn't give the Gaels an j
earned run yesterday and scattered j
their seven hits like a wind-blown
bob.
if the defeat doesn't numb them
too much, you can look for the In- j
dians to whap Santa Clara by seven j
or eight runs when they meet again |
Saturday.
