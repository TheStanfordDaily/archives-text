# Erratic Indian Diamond Squad Bows to Gaels
## Tenth Inning Drive Gives 3 to 2 Victory To Lucky St. Mary's 
### 
Little A1 Lazzarone pitched one of I
his better baseball games yesterday
afternoon, but a combination of er
rors and no power at the plate i
ruined his efforts as Stanford bowed
to St. Mary's 3 to 2 in a 10-inning
st-uggle.
The game dropped Stanford into j
second place in the current C.1.8.A.
league race while St. Mary's now
dominates the leadership with two
wins and no losses.
Lazzarone didn't have the strike- \
outs that Happy Merrill chalked up I
for the Gaels but he was tighter in j
the rough spots. Stanford led into !
the eighth inning, 2 to 1, before an- \
other error allowed the Gaels to j
catch up and eventually win the |
game.
Bob Ditlevsen's fourth inning I
single and Wally deWitt's pinch hit
double in the seventh brought in the I
only local scores. A single over sec- ;
ond by Monte Pfyl completed Stan- j
ford's heavy stick work for the day. i
Lazzarone managed to keep calm |
and collected when players all
around him were as tied up as a
crew of bar-bell men. Every time
his mates would start hobbling", he
would come through with a strike
out or an easy infield out to end i
the procession.
Ken Butler, ace second baseman,
led St. Mary's with two hits and
three runs, with A1 Lingua also ;
getting a pair of hits.
