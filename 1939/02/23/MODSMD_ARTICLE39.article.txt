# Hoopmen Head South Tonight
## Improving Quintet To Battle U.C.L.A. 
### 
After taking it easy most of this
week. Coach Everett Dean and his
varsity hoopmen will leave tonight
for Los Angeles to play their two
game series with U.C.L.A. tomorrow
and Saturday nights.
Because Don Burness and Bill
Rapp were injured in the S.C. se
ries last week-end, they have not
been out for practice, but Dean ex
pects them to be well enough to
make the trip south tonight.
In the one long scrimmage of the
week, the team has special com
petitive shooting, which, according
to Dean, has improved their shoot
ing and should put the cagers back
into their stride. The Cards will not
have the same passing trouble that
slowed them down against Cal since
the Bruins do not have the height
advantage.
Rumor has it that the Bruins are
determined t > win a game for a
change and feel that this is their
chance, but Dean has worked out
good substitutions for Burness and
Rapp. Copsey will move to center
when Burness is out, Dick Lyon
taking Copsey's job. Don Williams
will replace Rapp when the latter
rests.
