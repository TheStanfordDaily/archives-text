A gallery of photographs of the
migratory workers in their hovels
and dirty camps is on exhibition in
the Nitery. This begins the activi
ties by the Steinbeck Committee te>
promote student interest in the
migratory worker's problem.
These realistic pictures take in all
phases of the every day life of the
destitute worker's leaving nothing to
the imagination. Not. only do the-y
show the filthy living conditions of
the California camps, but they also
picture the eroded fields and Dust
Beiwl from which these people have
fled.
In contrast lo the poor conditions
in the migratory worker's camps,
the committee has posted photo
graphs of the well-ke'pt Federal
government camps, some e>f which
even have rose-arbors. Members of
the Stanford Steinbeck Committee
are Andrics Deinum, Otis Brubaker,
Mary Beaton, and Gene Glassman.
