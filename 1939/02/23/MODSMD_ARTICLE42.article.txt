# Mermen to Meet O. C. Frosh to Face Fullerton J.C.
## 
### 
Prepping for one of the toughest
meets of their season, the Card var
sity mermen are planning to enter
tain the powerful Olympic Club tank
team from San Francisco in the En
cina Pools, Saturday afternoon at
2:30 o'clock.
Sensation of the city team is Bill
Lucas, flashy Polytechnic High
School free-styler who is slated to
beat Stanford's captain and Ail-
American champ. Win Needham, in
the 220 and 440. Jim Werson, Sen
ior National A.A.U. breast stroke
champion, is another of the club's
great drawing cards. Lloyd Wilson
of the Cards is given a chance* to
come in second in front of Warren
Smith, O.C.'s second place man.
Don Peterson, iron-man sprinter
for the club, and Bob Walker,
baek-stroker, were former Stanford
star mermen. Arthur Hargraves,
who has swum backstroke for 14
years, will try to keep from tar
nishing his unblemished record
when he competes with Bill Weeden,
Card back-stroke specialist.
Coach Nort Thornton will display
his squad at full strength, and in
its best combinations in an attempt
to defeat the clubbers. As it was
last week against Oregon, the win
ning of the entire meet will depend
on the winning of the 400-yard
relay.

For the past three years Fuller
ton J.C. has brought a swimming
team to Northern California and has
bowed only to the Stanford var
sity among all the varsity teams it
has met. This year the varsity
schedule couldn't be arranged to in
clude a meet with the boys from
the southland, so Coach Nort
Thornton offered them a meet with
the Card frosh mermen, which
have accepted.
This meet, by far the hardest
hurdle the frosh tanksters will have
to meet this season. will be run off
ite the Encina Pools tomorrow af
ternoon at 4 o'clock.
Only definite information avail
able on the Fullerton outfit is that
they have a well balanced, full
team, as always, and that they beat
the powerful Pasadena Athletic
Club team, ,47-27.
Frosh Captain Paul Herron will
attempt to better the U. S. Collegiate
freshman record in the 220 of 2:16
which he set at San Jose State two

weeks ago. Next he will go after
another U. S. record, :55 in the 100
free style held by Edward Parke of
Princeton. Herron will also enter the
440 or the 400-yard relay, depend
ing on the strength of Fullerton in
these two events.

Club team, ,47-27.
Frosh Captain Paul Herron will
attempt to better the U. S. Collegiate

tain the powerful Olympic Club tank
team from San Francisco in the En
cina Pools, Saturday afternoon at
2:30 o'clock.

when he competes with Bill Weeden,
Card back-stroke specialist.
Coach Nort Thornton will display
his squad at full strength, and in
its best combinations in an attempt
to defeat the clubbers. As it was
last week against Oregon, the win
ning of the entire meet will depend
on the winning of the 400-yard
relay.

ton J.C. has brought a swimming
team to Northern California and has
bowed only to the Stanford var
sity among all the varsity teams it
has met. This year the varsity
schedule couldn't be arranged to in
clude a meet with the boys from
the southland, so Coach Nort
Thornton offered them a meet with
the Card frosh mermen, which
have accepted.
This meet, by far the hardest
hurdle the frosh tanksters will have
to meet this season. will be run off
ite the Encina Pools tomorrow af

Only definite information avail
able on the Fullerton outfit is that
they have a well balanced, full
team, as always, and that they beat
the powerful Pasadena Athletic
Club team, ,47-27.
