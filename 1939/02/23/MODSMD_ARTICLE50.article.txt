# In the Interest of Humanity
## 
### 
FIRST inkling that Stanford was to have a
valuable addition to its Medical School in
San Francisco came this week when it guietly
was announced that actual architect's plans and
drawings were practically in the hands of
contractors.
As in the case of most large gifts to large
institutions, the story behind Mrs. Louis Stern's
grant to Stanford for the "Ruth Lucie Stern Re
search Building" is an interesting one.
And the total effect of Mrs. Stern's many
such endowments is to amaze even the ordi
narily unselfish.
Included in the list of her public gifts is the
Palo Alto Community Center—in itself a project
large enough to satisfy the usual philanthropist.
In Stanford, she long has evidenced an in
terest equivalent to her interest in Palo Alto,
however. She is donor of the Ruth Stern Loan
Fund for assisting Stanford undergraduates.
She maintains other scholarships both here and
abroad for Stanford students.
Not long ago, asked to donate to a fund being
collected to purchase a fluoroscope to be used
for the detection of tuberculosis on the campus,
she contributed the full amount.
Privately, she has played the role of friend
and benefactor to many individuals, a good
part of them Stanfordites.
As the culmination to this interest, Mrs. Stem
now waves her wand and "because of crowded
conditions" has donated the physical plant for
Stanford medical research, assured that it will
be "of immeasurable value to humanity."
Architecturally ideal, the building will fur
nish the facilities necessary to provide the an
swers to vital problems now facing medical
research and will provide a physical plant more
than adequate to keep Stanford at the top in the
field of medicine.
To Mrs. Stern—for her latest gift to Stanford,
for favors received in the past —Stanford now
owes a return for her investment in the interest
of humanity, the audible appreciation she has
long avoided for her quiet unselfishness.
