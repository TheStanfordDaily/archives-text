# Muddy Waters
## 
### 
TWO weeks ago when rain was drenching
the campus, the most popular topic of con
versation, aside from sex, was the miserable
condition of the Library parking lot. As stu
dents splashed from their cars to the Quad
through an inch and a half of muddy water,
they audibly cursed the Department of Build
ings and Grounds in particular and the Uni
versity in general.
Now that the rains have ceased and the quag
mire has turned once again to a desert, the
parking lot is a forgotten issue. No reminder
of the deluge remains but a few unpaid clean
ing bills.
Now, when the Library area is dry, is the
time to resurface the lot. For proof that the
project is a practical one, one has only to look
at the smooth-surfaced space behind the Edu
cation Building which is reserved for faculty
cars. Naturally, it is far more important that the
faculty members keep their feet dry than the
students. But the library staff uses the regular
parking area, and they must be considered,
even if the students are not.
Cost of the project would not be exorbitant;
it has been estimated that the ground can be
surfaced with oil for five cents a square foot.
On the other hand rubber hip-boots for the
entire student body cannot be purchased for
less than $900 a gross.
Having to wade through a submerged park
ing lot on the way to and from class is not
exactly a pleasant experience, and it certainly
will not increase attendance at 8 o'clocks and
evenings of study in the library. In order to
protect itself the University should either oil
the parking area before the next rains, or put
in an order for 4000 pairs of water wings.—
