CHLORINE is not a poison gas, said The
Daily last Friday following the chlorine
accident in which two students were injured
temporarily. This bald statement apparently
needs some qualification.
In the first place, practically everything is
poisonous—under certain conditions. Inject
milk into the bloodstream, and it's likely to be
fatal. Wad up a Parker House roll and stuff it
into your ear, and see what a fight it takes you
to recover.

In the case of chlorine, there is a set of con
ditions that must be fulfilled before it is poison
ous. When a person is subjected for 15 min
utes to one part of chlorine in 3,000 parts of
moist air (a high concentration), acute oedema
is the result. That is, the chlorine irritates the
lining of the lungs, fluid passes out of the
bloodstream into the little air sacs, and the
victim is very likely to "drown in his own
juice."
That is a reaction which may be classified
as "poisonous."
The Daily's assertion last Friday was based
on the fact that these conditions were not pres
ent. The two injured students were not ex
posed to the fumes for anything like 15 min
utes. No one is going to hang around that long
in a room where there is a high concentration
of an unpleasant gas. Under conditions pres
ent at the time, chlorine is not a poison. Al
though it may irritate the lungs slightly, its chief
action is to replace temporarily the oxygen in
the lungs and to cause suffocation.
