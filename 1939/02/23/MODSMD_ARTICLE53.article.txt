MY OWN PROFS EXCEPTED
r away in an odd corner of The Daily
every Monday morning is a story that reads
something like this: " 'Reactions of Subnormal Proto
zoa to Measured Applications of Energy of Varying
Wave Length' will be the subject of a talk by Dr.
N. G. Heminhaw on the Stanford Radio Hour over
KGO tonight." Tucked away in an odd corner of the
ether waves every Monday evening is a lecture by a
Stanford professor working around to some sensible
but hardly thrilling conclusion such as that pasteur
ized milk plays hell with the bacteria in it.
All of this doesn't bother me particularly one way
or another. A radio is essentially a tool of individual
ism, and as long as we remember how to change sta
tions, we will suffer from no tyranny in air entertain
ment. But the economist in me is pained to see this
waste of opportunity.

Presumably the Stanford Radio Hour is intended
to boost Stanford prestige. In sponsoring it, the Uni
versity may also have hopes of bringing culture to
benighted minds and of advancing the cause of edu
cation by handing out free samples. But the primary
reason for bothering with the program is the expecta
tion that it will help Stanford to make a nice im
pression on the public.
As it is now the program impresses no one, ex
cept possibly professors at other colleges, and they
are not good sales prospects for Stanford. I shall make
no attempt to list the things that do interest the
public. But. I am convinced that. Walter Winchell
comments on the private lives of bacteria do not.
sh ijt m $
JT ISN'T as though the last frontier of civilization
were in the world of the microbe. My understand
ing is that there are a number of very important so
cial problems still unsolved. It is safe to assume that
a man's personal troubles will be of more interest to
him than the bothers of microbes or molecules.
If tlie University wants to make a splash with
prospective students, it could appeal to them by dis
cussing the problems of a modern young man. Most
of us would stick around a minute to listen to a talk
on how to get a job, or how to prepare for earning a
living.
If wo want to shine up to millionaires with weak
hearts and guilty consciences, we could discuss inter
national and political problems, with a practical slant.
* * * sj.
Our present program is beautifully academic and
marvelously educational. It would be the ideal for a
society where all difficulties had been solved and only
detached curiousity was left. But in these troubled
days it. is no competition for swing music, Buck Rog
ers, and Roosevelt.

Our present program is beautifully academic and

society where all difficulties had been solved and only
detached curiousity was left. But in these troubled

MY OWN PROFS EXCEPTED
r away in an odd corner of The Daily
every Monday morning is a story that reads
something like this: " 'Reactions of Subnormal Proto
zoa to Measured Applications of Energy of Varying
Wave Length' will be the subject of a talk by Dr.
N. G. Heminhaw on the Stanford Radio Hour over
KGO tonight." Tucked away in an odd corner of the
ether waves every Monday evening is a lecture by a
Stanford professor working around to some sensible
but hardly thrilling conclusion such as that pasteur
ized milk plays hell with the bacteria in it.
All of this doesn't bother me particularly one way
or another. A radio is essentially a tool of individual
ism, and as long as we remember how to change sta
tions, we will suffer from no tyranny in air entertain
ment. But the economist in me is pained to see this
waste of opportunity.

Presumably the Stanford Radio Hour is intended
to boost Stanford prestige. In sponsoring it, the Uni
versity may also have hopes of bringing culture to
benighted minds and of advancing the cause of edu
cation by handing out free samples. But the primary
reason for bothering with the program is the expecta
tion that it will help Stanford to make a nice im
pression on the public.
As it is now the program impresses no one, ex
cept possibly professors at other colleges, and they
are not good sales prospects for Stanford. I shall make
