# Lightly . . . And Politely

### DOUC JAQUES 
Let me tell you, as if you didn't know. It's one of
those days. And I spent the first hour after I got up
blubbering like an idiot because the Library was
closed. Imagine!
Then I went up to the lake. I was with one of The
Daily boys who was taking pictures for the next
photolith section.
I haven't seen so many untanned legs, or even just
legs, since Labor Day. Ah, it was wonderful. The
sun was shining, the sky was blue, lhe lake wax dirty
but full of water and canoes and, whenever a canoe
tipped over, people.
And everyone was loafing. Beautiful.
All the girls, in their dark glasses and shorts,
looked good. You couldn't miss.

The photographer took a picture of one of
them.
"You're just taking this for your own private
enjoyment, aren't .you?" she said.
"Sure."
"Then that's all right," she said.
Ilmmmin.
Winter quarter is traditionally the time to study
around here. But if this weather keeps up, I don't
know. Then conic Spring Quarter time, no one will
have the usual grade-point reserve to count on
This morning even gave the fraternity Peeping
Toms a spark of ambition. And something to be ambi
tious about.
It. was Spring Quarter-ish, too, having a dance in
the middle of the week. They tell me at the Lagunita
dance last night the last number played by the orches
tra was "Cornwallis Surrenders."
Ilinmmm.
Which reminds me: No one understands this too
well. Some guy went over to Kohle last week at
about 7:30. He stayed there until 10:31. and then
left.
The Kohle matrons arc gently irked. The guy
got some girl a one-minute lock-out—and they
j can't pin it on anyone.

; It was two spring quarters ago, when my dumbest
! friend still had hopes, that he took a girl out canoe
j ing before the Roble Formal.
They were appropriately dressed, of course.
Until he upset the canoe somewhere out in the
middle of the lake.
