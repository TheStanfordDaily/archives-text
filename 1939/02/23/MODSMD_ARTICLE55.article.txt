# Layman Views Art Exhibits
## 
### 
Art, as universal as it is, still has
comparatively few connoisseurs
among its admirers and most of the
Stanford students who stroll into the
Art Gallery enjoy the work from
their own interpretations of it —
knowing little about it but still ap
preciating it.
For this reason, this art review
and the ones to follow will speak
from a layman's point of view. No
emphasis will be made upon tech
nique. No claim will be made to
give a thorough discussion of art.
Just the impressions of the reviewer
will be expressed. And may the art
ists' wrath fall where it will.
Currently exhibited at the Gal
lery are the water colors of Marian
Wachtel, who is often credited with
being among America's finest water
colorists.
Miss Wachtel deals almost exclu
sively with landscapes. Her moun
tains, rivers, and trees express the
grandeur and serenity that is found
in nature. "Bull Lake," with its
snowy mountains, winding river,
wind-blown trees, is so realistic that
you expect a skier to come flying
down the snowy slopes or you
wouldn't be too surprised to see a
troop of Boy Scouts starting to pitch
camp on the shores of the river.
The artist uses shadows to great
advantage. The details of nature—
floating clouds, haze, sunset —are all
authentic.
The only weakness in the collec
tion is her handling of humans in
several Mexican scenes, for they
lack some essential quality that
would make them life-like. But the
indescribable beauty of the nature
scenes compensates for any such
weakness.
The entire collection is most sat
isfying and is worth a few min
utes' absence from an English Cor
ner bull session. —Silverman
