## SPANIARD SPEAKS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In The Daily of February 9, I read
in "History . . . 1939'' the follow
ing statement: "And so, after almost
three years of civil war, the red and
gold standard of Fascism soon may
fly over a reunited Spain."
Since I do not wish a false im
pression to be had regarding the
symbols of Spain, I submit the fol
lowing historical fact: Carlos 111,
King of Spain, in May 1785, estab
lished the red and gold flag, refer
red to by the author of the column,
for the Royal Spanish Navy.
MADE OFFICIAL FLAG
It was definitely established as the
official flag of Spain in 1843 and
continued until 1931, when it was
changed for a different one, under
the Republic, but it continued to
wave in the hearts of all real Span
iards until it was again declared the
official flag of Spain on August 15,
1936. History does not state whether
or not Carlos 111 was a Fascist.
I read also in "Campus Opinion,"
a few days ago, a letter of Dr. John
T. Reid in which' General Franco
was accused of being heartless in his

cruel bombardment of women and
children in Barcelona by his Italian
invaders. I believe that in all fair
ness it is necessary to realize that in
the city of Barcelona alone there
were 180 military objectives which
were located in all parts of the city,
including residential districts, as has
been corroborated by many.
TIMES CORRESPONDENT
Among them, the Barcelona cor
respondent of the New York Times,
Mr. Matthews (who cannot be ac
cused of being partial to General
Franco), who saw military objec
tives located under buildings in
residential parts of the city.
And with respect to the "Italian
invaders," the same can be said of
the other side by changing the word
"Italian" for "Russian," "French,"
"Czech," and "American," as has
been proved by prisoners taken from
planes brought down on General
Franco's territory.
Sincerely yours,
Antonio Sanz-Agero
