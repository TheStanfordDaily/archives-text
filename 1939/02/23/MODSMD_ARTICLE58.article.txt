* • Concerning R.D.'s chlorine edit in

Ed on one of the Chem department
bulletin boards with the following
underlined: Chlorine is not a poison
ous Has." Beside this clipping was
posted a mouse (thumb tack through
the tail).
Under said mouse was the fol
lowing inscription: Teen
siweensiensus — After exposure to
chlorine gas." The prompt posting
of a second mouse brought a change
in the spelling of his last name
( —siensi). Usual comment of pass
er-by, "I wonder if they were really
killed with chlorine?"
Yours for continued dissemination
of vital chemical information.
