# A.S.U. to List Anti-Fascists
## Signatures Sought For Democracy Roll 
### 
While both Professor Buck, of the
political science department, and
Giuseppi Facci, former editor and
publisher of Coltura Popolare, agreed
that, Fascism was not a menace to
I his country today, Stanford's chap
ter of the American Student Union
at a meeting Monday evening
launched its drive to secure signa
tures to its Human Rights Roll Call.
With numerous college presidents,
including Hutch ins of the University
of Chicago, Graham of the Univer
sity of North Carolina, Edmunds of
Pomona, and others throughout the
country, already endorsing the Roll
Call, Gene Glasmann, head of the
local chapter, urged Stanford stu
dents to support it.
"The freedom and progress of
American education stands or falls
with the fate of American democ
racy," the Roll Call proclaims. Ac
cording to the Roll Call, by signing
one shows that he is "ready to be
counted for democracy."
Professor Buck said that condi
tions for the advent of Fascism were
ripe in this country at the depths
of the depression, and .since democ
racy had survived and conditions
hael improved somewhat, there i.s no
reason to expect it now. Although
Facci agreed that conditions in this
country now were neit similar to
those in Italy and Germany when
Fascism came to those two nations,
he said that if was not at all impos
sible for Fascism, in a varied form,
to come to the United States if in
ternal dissatisfaction became wide
spread.
