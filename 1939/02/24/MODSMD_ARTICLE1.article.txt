who has ever wandered
around the Presidio of San
Francisco probably has been tempt
ed to stick his nose in the muzzles
of the big guns that defend the har
bor. If a man gives his imagination
a little play, it isn't very long be
fore he starts conjuring lip visions
of a Japanese fleet steaming toward
Treasure Island and trying to fig
ure just what the cannon that guard
the City could do to it.
To all of us who live on the Pa
cific Coast, the threat of an Oriental
invasion always has been nestling
somewhere within the range of
possibility. However, with our well
guarded military outpost in Hawaii
and our fleet playing war games in
the Pacific at regular intervals, we
have little cause to lose sleep. Still
the Japanese do provide a swell v»ay
to threaten San Francisco problem
children.

\V HUN I lie air-base provisions
of President Roosevelt's na
tional defense program reached
Congress early this year, it was ev
ident that a number of the admin
istration's military advisers had
been giving a little serious thought
to the Japanese menace. Their
proposed solution for the problem
was the fortification of the United
States' island possession of Guam,
1300 miles away from Nippon.
Congressmen read the bill and
reacted in a most extraordinary
manner. Hallowed divisions between
Republicans and Democrats, New
Dealers and anti-New Dealers, and
conservatives and liberals were for
gotten, and the legislators found
themselves in two strange camps.
In favor of the fortifiaction of
Guam was a group composed mostly
of non-isolationists and western rep
resentatives; on the other side of
the fence were isolationists and
easterners.
jjx iic »:«
I-TOR weeks the battle raged. Pro
ponents of defense argued that
the move would put a crimp in
Japan's to-hell-with-you attitude
toward the United States, would
discourage a Rome-Berlin-Tokyo
axis, and would protect the Phi
lippines from Japanese aggression.
Violent arguments flowed from the
other contingent, warning that
such a policy only would serve to
involve the United Suites in Asiat
ic conflicts and to invite trouble
with Japan.
After debating the issue on the
floor for three days, the House yes
terday voted down the proposal to
arm Guam, and approved all the
other air bases recommended in the
national defense bill. After all, we
can well afford to step cautiously
in the East.

it wants in Europe.
* * Hi
J7VER since General Franco's vic
tory in Spain, England and
France have been waltzing around
in circles trying to make up their
minds on the recognition of In
surgent Spain. Certain it is that
both democracies will recognize the
new Fascist power, but. they have
been using that "after you, my dear
Alphonse" gag for a good many days
now.
Today something is going "to
break. It will either be France's
recognition of Spain or the polit
ical defeat of the Daladier Cab
inet. For it is on the issue of his
government's recommendation that
Fascist-hating France recognize
the Insurgents that aggressive lit
tle Pcrmier is risking his contin
uance in oflicc.
I \ESPITE the strong opposition of
the leftist Popular Front, it ap
pears that the Chamber of Deputies
will cast its vote for recognition. It
is extremely difficult to shut your
eyes to reality in Europe today, and
when Franco rules Spain, he rules
Spain, whether 50.000.000 Frenchmen
think so or not.
Before each step she takes, France
glances nervously across the chan
nel to be sure that England stands
right behind her. If she recognizes
Spain today, it will be because she
is certain that. Britain will follow the
leader early next week.
Encouraging to the French yes

arm Guam, and approved all the
other air bases recommended in the
national defense bill. After all, we
can well afford to step cautiously
in the East.
If the United States is looking
for excitement, it. can find more than
it wants in Europe.
* * Hi
J7VER since General Franco's vic
tory in Spain, England and
France have been waltzing around
in circles trying to make up their
minds on the recognition of In
surgent Spain. Certain it is that
both democracies will recognize the
new Fascist power, but. they have
been using that "after you, my dear
Alphonse" gag for a good many days
now.
Today something is going "to
break. It will either be France's
recognition of Spain or the polit
ical defeat of the Daladier Cab
inet. For it is on the issue of his
government's recommendation that
Fascist-hating France recognize
the Insurgents that aggressive lit
tle Pcrmier is risking his contin
uance in oflicc.
I \ESPITE the strong opposition of
the leftist Popular Front, it ap
pears that the Chamber of Deputies
will cast its vote for recognition. It
is extremely difficult to shut your
eyes to reality in Europe today, and
when Franco rules Spain, he rules
Spain, whether 50.000.000 Frenchmen
think so or not.
Before each step she takes, France
glances nervously across the chan
nel to be sure that England stands
right behind her. If she recognizes
Spain today, it will be because she
is certain that. Britain will follow the
leader early next week.
Encouraging to the French yes
terday's declarations from the
Chamberlain government that it
will lend them 100 per cent sup
port in case of any trouble.
