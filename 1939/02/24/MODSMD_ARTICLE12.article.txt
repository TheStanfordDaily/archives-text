# Frosh Generally Upset—In Lake
## 
### 
There were two canoes on
the lake night, before last. In
one was a slightly bewildered
frosh. He'd figured that he
would practice his canoeing at
night, 'cause no one could see
him. After his canoe tipped
over he was glad there was
someone else there, too.
The other fellow, also a frosh,
rushed to the rescue. Bailing
out the water-logged victim, he
towed the submerged canoe to
the raft.
The rescucr had never been
on the lake before either. The
diving board on the raft look
ed good to him. He leaped for
it, only to find it was a loose
plank. There was no one left
to rescue him—he had to swim.
