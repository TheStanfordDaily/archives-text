# Work on Union Annex Resumed
## Public Dining Hall To Be Ready in April 
### 
Work on the Union public dining
hall annex, which was halted for
two weeks due to a steel strike, was
under way again last night. The
necessary steel reenforcements, de
livered yesterday, were being placed
last night, so that the concrete can
be poured as soon as possible.
By working at. night, Mr. John
Leveran hopes to have the extension
ready for use in time for the alumni
homecoming day in April.
The addition, costing about $12,000
will fill the need for a small dining
hall on the campus where private
dinners can be held. It will be pro
vided with sliding doors, where the
arched windows in the present rear
wall are, so that it. can be closed off
from the main dining room. There
will also be sliding doors within the
room, making it possible to divide it
into two smaller rooms. With this
arrangement one, two, or three
rooms will be available and groups
of various sizes can be accommo
dated.
Beneath the new addition will be
a basement, connected by a tunnel
to the present basement rooms. This
space will be utilized for storage.
