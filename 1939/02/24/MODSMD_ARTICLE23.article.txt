''Dictators arc a short-lived crcw,"
stated Kathleen Norris, novelist, at
the evening session of the Palo Alto
Peace Conference. The conference,
held at the Palo Alto Community
Center during the afternoon and eve
ning of Washington's Birthday, was
attended by 126 delegates represent
ing 36 organizations, and 40 visitors.
Stanford was represented by dele
gates from the Y.W.C.A., A.S.U.,
and young people's groups from Palo
Alto churches.
Dr. C. Duniway opened the confer
ence, expressing its democratic
ideals. After the invocation by Rev.
Jesse Lacklen, Oliver Haskell, chair
man of the China Aid Council for
the United States, addressed the
group. He emphasized the impor
tance of democracy as the only means
of peaceful internal change and ex
ternal relations. He closed his ad
dress with the statement that the
American public must let their
opinions be known, for silence is an
aid to aggressor nations.
The business of the evening ses
sion, following a dinner furnished by
Palo Alto merchants, began with a
voting and discussion on the reso
lutions presented by the committee
on building the peace front.
Kathleen Norris gave the closing
address of the conference. She
warned against fear without cause.
"We can't establish a kingdom of
love and brotherhood by hate and
retaliation. Our solution, as in the
home, lies in patience, forgiveness,
and understanding," she continued.
She closed her address with an ap
peal for a human and friendly atti
tude. "Remember, other nations
want friendship from us as much as
we want it from them."
