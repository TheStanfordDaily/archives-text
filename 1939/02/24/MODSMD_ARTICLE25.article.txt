# Senior Excom Schedules Prom For April 28
## Ryus Hopes for 'Big-Name' Band For Spring Quarter Dance; To Ask Ex Committee to Vote Closed Date 
### 
The Senior Prom, originally scheduled for March 10 hut canceled this
week when negotiations for an orchestra colalpsed, is definitely re-sched
nled for April 28, according to I)avc Ryus, president of the senior class.
Excom will he asked for a closed date at their regular Tuesday meeting
next week, Ryus said.
Postponement of the dance until spring quarter was made necessary by
a scarcity of available dates during the rest of winter quarter, Ryus ex-

•plained. "There is room for only ;t
small dance from now on this quar
ter, and Senior Excom docs not want
to plan a small dance."
PRINCE IN CHARCJE
That negotiations for a ''name"
band will continue for the new date
Ryus promised. "We do not feel that
the dance will draw an adequate
crowd without a well-known or
chestra as a drawing card," he ex
plained. "The name of the dance
alone is not a sufficient attraction."
To avoid the administrative tape,
which tangled this month and can
celed the possibility of signing Gene
Krupa and his orchestra for the
dance, Ryus said that Senior Excom
planned to put complete power to
engage a band into the hands of
Chuck Prince, chairman of the dance
committee.
NEW PLAN
Under the new plan, Prince will
obtain a list of orchestras available
for the new date, and a list of prices.
The lists will be submitted to Senior
Excom for approval, and Prince will
then be authorized to sign a contract
with the most acceptable band avail •
able.
"Elimination of delay between
healing of the availability of a band
and the actual signing should pre
vent the loss of such an opportunity
as we have just experienced with
Krupa," Ryus said.
Questioned in regard to the prob
ability of Excom's granting the sen
iors their desired closed date on
April 28. Betty Davis, A.S.S.U. vice
president, pointed out that many
factors may influence this.
CROWDED SCHEDULE
"We have granted only one or two
closed dates for spring quarter at
this time," she said. "Other con
flicting dates may influence our de
cision on the date for the Senior
Prom."
She pointed out that Excom
planned to grant all closed dates for
spring quarter before the close of
winter quarter, and explained that
nothing definite would be known on
the Senior Prom date until Excom
had considered all applications for
dates next quarter.
