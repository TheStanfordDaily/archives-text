# New Dealers Encourage Big Business
## Administration Plans No New Taxes, Says Treasury Secretary 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23' (UP).—
The administration's new concilia
tory policy toward business was ex
tended today when Secretary of the
Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr.,
announced himself as against in
creased tuxes and urged over-cau
tious industry to forget its "what's
the use attitude."
"The administration," he said,
"wants business men to go ahead
with normal risks—wants them to
make money." He added President
Roosevelt contemplates no new taxes
and suggested Congress scrutinize
the tax laws closely and remove any
deterrents to business expansion.
RE M ARK S SIGNIFIC ANT
Morgenthau's remarks were con
sidered significant inasmuch as they
emphasized the increasing tendency
of Mr. Roosevelt and other New
Dealers to substitute conciliation for
untempered criticism.
This policy is expected to be more
clearly defined tomorrow night at
Des Moines, lowa, when the Presi
dent's new Secretary of Commerce,
Harry Hopkins, makes his first pub
lic address. When he named Hopkins
to succeed Daniel C. Roper, Mr. Roo
sevelt Jet it be known his job would
he to bring government and business
into closer co-operation.
Many other Now Dealers, some of
them not heretofore concerned with
the tribulations of business, have
stepped out of their roles to wave the
torch of conciliation, chief among
them Secretary of War Henry Wood
ring, who told a group of Demo
cratic women that business has no
cause for fear.
President Roosevelt said as much
at a recent press conference, and to
emphasize there is a new order,
pointed out the administration had
to come to an agreement with its
most embittered enemy, the vast
power industry.
According to reports Morgenthau
has been in sharp disagreement with
the White House over its attitude
toward business. He is said to be de
lighted with the new order, and this
apparently was borne out today.
TREASURY STUDIES
He said in case Congress becomes
disposed to examine the tax laws the
Treasury would submit results of
exhaustive studies of the whole reve
nue structure. He said the adminis
tration, in foregoing new taxes,
would base its financing policy on
the theory any needed revenues
would come from existing taxes,
augmented by returns from improved
business.
Observers agreed the administra
tion has done an about-face. When
the President sent his 1940 budget
message to Congress last month he
indicated he would favor between
$400,000,000 and $500,000,000 in new
taxes to help finance farm benefit
payments and the national defense
program. Morgenthau's only com
ment was the Treasury's financing
plans do not envisage new taxes.
