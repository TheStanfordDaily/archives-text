# Farm's Ex-Yell Leader Now Athletic Director
## 
### 
Jimmy used to lead (lie massed Stanford rooting section in the axe J
yell. Now Jimmy teaches South Americans the liner points of athletics.
Jimmy Triolo, "><>, remembered as one of the peppiest yell loaders the
Farm ever had. And now, "James (J. Triolo," director of water sports I
and Olympic team coach of the Republics of Panama and Colombia.

In this month's issue of the Stan- j
ford Illustrated Review, Triolo tells j
of his experiences in the Latin- |
American countries â€” "good neigh-I
bor.s . . . but also good athletes."
HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS
A wide gulf exists between their j
ideas on sports and ours, he writes. |
"I first considered many of my ath- i
letes lazy and lacking in ambition, j
since I couldn't help judging them j
by our standards."
Illustrating his point, he related'
an incident which occurred during a j
100-meter time trial at Panama City, j
Six men started at the gun. Five
jumped out of the pool at the end
of the first lap. The five swimmers
explained that the remaining man j
had led them all by a few inches, so j
what was the use of continuing. And I
this at the end of the first lap!
In yet another meet, his team left j
the pool highly irked. Because their j
"gringo" coach had failed to make
the proper introductions, and as a J
consequence they had been forced
to compete against total strangers.
Thus the Latin point of view.
COMING OLYMPIAD FACTOR
In spite of handicaps of this na- j
ture, coaches and advisers from the.
United States have aided in turning!
out fine individual performers in j
many events. South America has!
been recognized as a coming factor j
in the Olympic games, and Jimmy
Triolo is one of the reasons.
When in his height as yell leader
on the Farm, Jimmy had two mas
cots. One was "Asta," a diminutive
turtle with a Block S painted on its
back. The other was "Emma," only
a radio owl.
Maybe they're still with him.
