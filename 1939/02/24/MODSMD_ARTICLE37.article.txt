# Missing Links Baffle Cops

Someone on the Campus got
playful either late last night or
very early this morning and
stole the chain that closes off
the Engineering Corner end of
Lasuen. According to Campus
Officer Gordy Davis, when he
made the rounds this morning
he found the posts still stand
ing. but the chains gone. The
same thing happened two or
three years ago, the chains
turning up a few days later on
the campus.
Davis thinks that some play
ful soul took the chains for a
lark. Either that, or they need
ed a tow chain or planned to
haunt a house with ghostly
rattles in the near future, he
said.
