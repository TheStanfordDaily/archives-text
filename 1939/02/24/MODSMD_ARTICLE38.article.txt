# Ruggers Set For Title Tilt With Olympics
## League Champions To Be Determined In Week-end Match 
### 
Stanford ruggers meet their last
hurdle in the rugby league Satur
day when they face the Olympic
Club. A victory over the Winged O
means the Northern California
league championship. They will
have to take Cal in the meet on
Treasure Island a few weeks hence
to win the intercollegiate title, how
ever.
The Olympic Club promises to
give the Cards a good tussle on Sat
urday. Ex-Stanfordites like Jim
Mullin, Johnny Mottram, Gordy
Malatrat, Marv Taylor, and Jim Mc-
Daniels, who played for Stanford in
bygone days, plus a good bunch of
old-time rugby stars, will give the
ruggers a good fast game.
The ruggers were in good shape
both in playing ability and phys
ically yesterday afternoon in prac
tice, according to Coach Harry Ma
loney. Captain Lyman Calkins
came back to the team to fill a
mighty gap in the team after being
out with a cold for a week. Calkins
is one of the most valuable men on
the team because of his great knowl
edge of rugby and his uncanny kick
ing ability. Pat Knowles and Hugh
Gallarneau, the two new recruits on
the squad, are learning the game
fast, and should prove to be good
ruggers.
The game with the Olympic Club
will be held in the stadium at 2:30
o'clock Saturday afternoon. The
Stanford B team will meet the
Olympic Club second team directly
after the main game. Charles An
gell, former Stanford rugger, will be
the referee.
