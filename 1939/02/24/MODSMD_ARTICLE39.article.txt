j planning to enter the big meet
! scheduled for March 9 and 10 must
| register by this time.
Block winners, numeral winners,
i and track stars who won like awards

, ever, an award winner in a held j
' event may compete on the track and >
) vice versa. The number of men i
j that can be entered by an organiza- !
I tion in one single event is limited to j
! three.
Next week intramural basket
