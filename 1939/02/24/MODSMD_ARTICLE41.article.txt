ARCADIA, Cal., Fob. 23 (UP). —
Seabiseuit tonight was declared out
of the $100,000 Santa Anita Handicap
when owner Charles S. Howard in
fiymed the racing secretary the 1!K!8
champion still was sound but might
break down again if forced to train
for the fifth running of the mile and
a quarter classic on March 4—just
nine days away.
Howard said he was scratching the
son of Hardtack because he felt such
action was only fair to the public.
The horse—just $36,000 shy of Sun
Beau's money mark—was an original
3-1 future book favorite to capture

the race that would have made him
the greatest money winner of all
time.
Howard said the horse will be
rested for several months and
prepped for the Hollywood Gold Cup
at Inglewood in the late summer.
