EAST FRIDAY, Slants predicted
th;it Stanford would lose only one
contest in the near-score of athletic
events billed for the week-end.
A slight error in our basketball
computations crossed us up to the
extent that we lost two tussles, both
in the Southern California basket
ball series. Somebody forgot to tell
the Trojans about our system of
mathematical probability.
This week, the Indians are in a
swell spot for a clean sweep with
only two sports, boxing and varsity
tennis, on the doubtful ledger. If
the Redmen do .survive without a
defeat t it'll be the first time that has
happened since Stanford
used to breed the fastest horses on
the Peninsula. Upsets and mediocre
performances are too much in vogue
to expect a shut-out, but the time is
certainly opportune.
* * *
A ttROliP of friends of Jack Rice,
145-pound Stanford boxer, wants the
news to get around that Rice has
never lost a fight to a man from
U.C.L.A. Somebody with a defeatist
complex initiated the yarn a few
days ago that Rice was licked last
year by a Bruin titled Droves. The
truth of the matter is that Jack not
only beat the Bruin handily but
had his less worthy opponent drool
ing with the heat, as the bout ended.
Incidentally, Rice is without a
doubt the most improved man on
Clayton Frye's entire squad. In six
days before the U.C.L.A. matches a
week ago, Rice worked out a left
hook that is pleasant to the ear. You
might as well be satisfied with lis
tening to it because the darn thing]
comes in faster than a drunken driv
er on the Buyshore. And it's just '
about as deadly. '

OF ALL the sporting events
which took place last Saturday, the
most picturesque was one which
wasn't even on the calendar.
Pete "Renfrew" Zagar was doing i
mountie duty at the rugby game j
and was supposed, among other
things, to keep the customers off the
field at half time. Zagar had the
fellas buffaloed without much exer
tion, but a female beauty who came
prancing through wasn't to be stop
ped with mere words.
Zagar was plenty burned, so the
yarn goes, and might have threat- j
ened mild mayhem on the pretty ;
one's person. But she ambled on,!
like the lady that she must have'
been.
The crisis was reached. Zagar j
hoisted the amazon into his armsj
and dragged her back to the safety !
zone. She didn't try to cross any j
more. Which just goes to show that i
you must never flaunt the law, and ■
crime still doesn't pay.

Incidentally, Rice is without a
doubt the most improved man on
Clayton Frye's entire squad. In six
days before the U.C.L.A. matches a
week ago, Rice worked out a left
hook that is pleasant to the ear. You
might as well be satisfied with lis
tening to it because the darn thing]
comes in faster than a drunken driv
er on the Buyshore. And it's just '
about as deadly. '

OF ALL the sporting events
which took place last Saturday, the
most picturesque was one which
wasn't even on the calendar.
Pete "Renfrew" Zagar was doing i
mountie duty at the rugby game j
and was supposed, among other
things, to keep the customers off the
field at half time. Zagar had the
fellas buffaloed without much exer
tion, but a female beauty who came
prancing through wasn't to be stop
ped with mere words.
Zagar was plenty burned, so the
yarn goes, and might have threat- j
ened mild mayhem on the pretty ;
one's person. But she ambled on,!
like the lady that she must have'
been.
The crisis was reached. Zagar j
hoisted the amazon into his armsj
and dragged her back to the safety !
zone. She didn't try to cross any j
more. Which just goes to show that i
you must never flaunt the law, and ■
crime still doesn't pay.
EAST FRIDAY, Slants predicted
th;it Stanford would lose only one
contest in the near-score of athletic
events billed for the week-end.
A slight error in our basketball
computations crossed us up to the
extent that we lost two tussles, both
in the Southern California basket
ball series. Somebody forgot to tell
the Trojans about our system of
mathematical probability.
This week, the Indians are in a
swell spot for a clean sweep with
only two sports, boxing and varsity
tennis, on the doubtful ledger. If
the Redmen do .survive without a
defeat t it'll be the first time that has
happened since Stanford
used to breed the fastest horses on
the Peninsula. Upsets and mediocre
performances are too much in vogue
to expect a shut-out, but the time is
certainly opportune.

A ttROliP of friends of Jack Rice,
145-pound Stanford boxer, wants the
news to get around that Rice has
never lost a fight to a man from
U.C.L.A. Somebody with a defeatist
complex initiated the yarn a few
days ago that Rice was licked last
year by a Bruin titled Droves. The
truth of the matter is that Jack not
only beat the Bruin handily but
had his less worthy opponent drool
ing with the heat, as the bout ended.
