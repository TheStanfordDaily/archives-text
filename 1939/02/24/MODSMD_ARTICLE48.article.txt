# Farm Tankmen To Face Tests
## Card Teams to Meet Winged O, Fullerton 
### 
Card swimmers of both the var- .
sity and frosh teams will face the
toughest competition of their sea
sons. The varsity will meet the
strong Olympic Club team from San
Francisco, while the frosh run into !
Fullerton Jaysee's powerful aggre- !
gation from the southland.
Both meets will be held in the En
cina pols, the frosh to start at 4
o'clock this afternoon, and the var
sity tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
o'clock. Admission will be free.
Olympic Club will be sporting a j
bunch of former college stars, old- i
time Pacific Coast champs, and one
sensational high school flash, who:
are slated to give the Cards a tough
fight. The winner of the whole j
meet probably will be decided by
the last event, the 400-yard relay. (
All events will be hotly contested
with record times and photo-finishes |
in the offing. The feature races will
probably be the 220 and 440, with
All-American Win Needham of the
Cards fighting to pull in ahead of I
Bill Lucas, O.C.'s high school star |
who has beaten national college rec- 1
ord.s in these events.
Captain Paul Hervon of the frosh
squad will be aiming to better his
national record time of 2:IG in the j
220 set at San Jose three weeks ago. I
Fullerton, who makes a habit of !
beating Cal and San Jose varsities, j
will be the hardest team the frosh 1
will face this year. Prospects are i
for an undefeated season if they I
win this meet.

City planning is now offered
Connecticut college students in a
special course called "civic art."
