# Varsity Nine Battles Broncs Here Saturday
## Thompson's Pitching Expected to Bring Second League Win 
### 
The Stanford baseball team gets
another crack at conference compe
tition tomorrow afternon with its
second game of the season against
Santa Clara on the Sunken Dia
mond. Game time has been set for
2:3o'o'clock.
Quentin "Cootie" Thompson, who
pitched the last inning Wednesday
against St. Mary's, will probably get
the starting call for the Indians. With
Ed Nelson playing basketball, the
Broncs have no pitchers capable of
pressing Thompson when he is
"on."
While Santa Clara touched AI
Lazzarone for 12 hits in the league
priemiere, they didn't seem to have
enough scoring punch to threaten
the Indians except during brief
scoring interludes. Unless the de
feat by St. Mary's has demoralized
Coach Ha fry Wolter's squad too
much, they should take their second
league win in three starts without
too much effort.
St. Mary's also plays California at
Berkeley on Saturday.
