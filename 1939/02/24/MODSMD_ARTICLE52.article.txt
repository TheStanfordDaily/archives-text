# Some Changes Made?
## 
### 
STANFORD'S system of granting dates for
student social functions long has been
criticized for its inefficiencies. Not long ago,
Ex Committee, supremely conscious of that fact,
adopted what was thought to be a long-range
policy of date-granting and members promised
to listen at meetings when planning took place.
That that long-range and open-ear policy is
far from adequate was proved yesterday with
the announcement that the Senior Prom was
canceled.
It is true that the situation now appears to
be not quite so disastrous as assumed. It has
been announced officially that the class will
and can ask for another date.
The whole confusion can be traced directly
to the circumstances surrounding the Scabbard
and Blade-Junior Prom mix-up.
At that time, the Junior Prom was postponed
until spring quarter because Scabbard and
Blade insisted on having a big name band
dance this quarter. Subsequently, it was de
cided that the Senior Prom, annually scheduled
for spring quarter, could be held this quarter.
It seems, however, that it is impossible to
sign a name band for the Prom for two rea
sons: there is none available, Senior Ex Com
mittee met too late to approve its committee's
choice when one was available.
And the problem to face Ex Committee next
Tuesday is not such a small one: it becomes
pertinent to inquire when or how the Junior
Prom, the Senior Prom, the Senior Ball, the
Convalescent Home Drive, Spring Show, and
Women's Conference Fair are all to be fitted
into spring quarter without a terrific jam-up.
Clearly, what's needed is a much more in
fallible system of date clearing than is now
in operation. Possibly, for Ex Committee to take
the initiative at the first of fall quarter and grant
closed dates to all affairs it knows it is going to
have to grant dates to anyway throughout the
whole year, would be a solution that would
prevent organizations stepping in, being
granted dates that conflict with the year's tra
ditionally big events.
Whatever the matter with the system, how
ever, Excom now has before it one of its big
gest headaches, will continue to have them
chronically until it decides to find some better
method to replace its present lazy man's way.
