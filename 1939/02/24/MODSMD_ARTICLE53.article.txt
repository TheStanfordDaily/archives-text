# To Note a Trend

RED-HOT left-wingers in the United States
have been screaming "Fascism!" so much
lately that the usual reaction is to smile toler
antly at their charges of impending dictator
ship. So many of these charges come from the
tops of soap-boxes, from behind long beards,
and from messy little mimeographed news
papers that the accusations tend to lose their
validity.
However, when such charges are made by
the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, Inc., on
whose advisory board are men like Charles A.
Beard, Stanford's Grayson N. Kefauver, and
Robert S. Lynd, it is near time for tolerant
smiles to change to concerned frowns.
As evidence in support of its contentions, the
institute lists as Jew-baiting, Red-baiting, fas
cist organizations the Crusader White Shirts,
Knights of the White Camellia, American Na
tional Socialist Party, Silvershirts, and others
with names just as picturesque.
Surprisingly candid are the publications of
these groups. Says the general order sheet of
the Crusader White Shirts:
"Take control of the local government in the
following manner: March in military forma
tion to and surround the governmental build
ings. Then, by sheer numbers and a patriotic
appeal, force the officials to accept and act

under the diiection of an economic adviser."
Chief technique of these propagandists is the
use of catch phrases like "World Jewry," "Fas
cism is America's Only Solution," and "Amer
ica for Americans."
It is only a step from the type of thinking
that believes a girl is honest if she has a big
mouth and all red-heads are quick-tempered to
the conviction that the Jews and Communists
have formed a mammoth international secret
organization and are about to take over as is
alleged by the above organizations.
As long as this sort of short-circuit thinking
exists, the democratic form of government in
the United States is in definite danger from a
growing group of calculating fascist rabble
rousers.
It is well within the province of Stanford and
other educational institutions to counteract this
fascist propaganda by taking note of these
movements and checking to see that propa
ganda does not substitute catch phrases for
objective thought.—R. D.

have been screaming "Fascism!" so much
lately that the usual reaction is to smile toler
antly at their charges of impending dictator
ship. So many of these charges come from the
tops of soap-boxes, from behind long beards,
and from messy little mimeographed news
papers that the accusations tend to lose their
validity.
However, when such charges are made by
the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, Inc., on
whose advisory board are men like Charles A.
Beard, Stanford's Grayson N. Kefauver, and
Robert S. Lynd, it is near time for tolerant
smiles to change to concerned frowns.
As evidence in support of its contentions, the
institute lists as Jew-baiting, Red-baiting, fas
cist organizations the Crusader White Shirts,
Knights of the White Camellia, American Na
tional Socialist Party, Silvershirts, and others
with names just as picturesque.
Surprisingly candid are the publications of
these groups. Says the general order sheet of
the Crusader White Shirts:
"Take control of the local government in the
following manner: March in military forma
tion to and surround the governmental build
ings. Then, by sheer numbers and a patriotic
appeal, force the officials to accept and act

under the diiection of an economic adviser."
Chief technique of these propagandists is the
use of catch phrases like "World Jewry," "Fas
cism is America's Only Solution," and "Amer
ica for Americans."
It is only a step from the type of thinking
that believes a girl is honest if she has a big
mouth and all red-heads are quick-tempered to
the conviction that the Jews and Communists
have formed a mammoth international secret
organization and are about to take over as is
alleged by the above organizations.
As long as this sort of short-circuit thinking
exists, the democratic form of government in
the United States is in definite danger from a
growing group of calculating fascist rabble
rousers.
It is well within the province of Stanford and
other educational institutions to counteract this
fascist propaganda by taking note of these
movements and checking to see that propa
ganda does not substitute catch phrases for
objective thought.—R. D.
