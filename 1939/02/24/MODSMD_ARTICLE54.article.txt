### JOHN COBBS 
F AIR WE ATI lER TREND
r r , HERE was a time a year or so back, when the fa
vorite editorial sport at Stanford was hunting
trends in student government. Parties of us used to
set out from the Shack, heavily armed with the latest
model statistics, determined to bring back a conclusion
dead or alive. And in those days, one of the trends
we stalked most often was the growing competition
between Cardinals and Axe Society.
Cardinals was then a placid activity organization,
drifting into dreamy middle age. Axe Society was
young and pushing, founded the year before and
stuffed with the ofFice-boy-for-president tradition.
Here certainly was a textbook example of a trend.
Surely the young and virile Axe Society would in time
displace senile Cardinals. All of us were sure that we
were seeing a preview of the next installment in the
student government serial.
* * * *
This, as I said, was some time ago. Yesterday morn
ing I noticed in The Daily that Cardinals is going
ahead with its usual spring program, which consists
of the Convalescent Home Drive. Of Axe Society I
hear nothing. Evidently the trends of yesteryear are
no more enduring than the snows.
Cardinals has continued to lead the placid life of a
well-to-do organization. Routine matters like lunch
eons and welcoming committees are processed accord
ing to standard pattern in its machinery. New busi
ness has consisted mainly of one or two discussions a
quarter over the problem of when to hold a jolly-up.
* & * *
And Axe Society, the vigorous young challenger,
has dropped off into a similar coma. It manages to do
practically nothing in an inoffensive sort of a way,
and so it is free to drowse without being disturbed.
Next fall, it will handle the Pre-reg program which
is important enough to keep the society respectable,
easy enough not to interfere with its rest. For the
balance of the year it will concentrate on securing bet
ter janitor service for the campus washrooms, which
is a laudable project but not one that menaces Cardi
nals' activity empire.
« ❖ *
It pains me a little to see our beautiful trend evapo
rate in this way. Where we expected a grudge fight
we have gotten only a double forfeit. But as a mat
ter of fact, we are all nicely adjusted to the situa
tion as it is. Cardinals and Axe Society can sleep
peacefully; the students can go their way unmolested
by synthetic enthusiasm.
Probably a .sociologist could make something out of
this little story, but it really wouldn't be worth his
effort. The moral is obvious. Two organizations doing
nothing arc just as efficient as one.
