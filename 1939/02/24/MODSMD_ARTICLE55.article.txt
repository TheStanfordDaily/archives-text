CLEVER,

One of the Row boys was taking a Row girl up to
her house from the Quad in his car. In the vein of
small talk, she said at one point, "You know the phone
at your house isn't working. One of the girls called
your house the other day, and the operator told her
the phone was out of oi - der."
"I'll check upon it," the guy said, dropped her off,
went home, and did check up on it.
He found out that it was all right by then, and
called the girl to tell her.
"I just thought I would tell you," he said, "so that
the girl can make her call now."
"Thank you," she said prettily. "As a matter of
fact, I made the call. Will you come to our house
formal?"

GADGETS

One of the Farm's many camera enthusiasts was
up in the city the other night, and he went up on
Telegraph Hill to get a shot of Treasure Island.
It was a wonderful night, and all that sort of thing.
He carefully fixed up his camera and focused it. Then
he started adjusting all of the hundreds of little things
that you have to adjust on these modern cameras.
It took him quite a while. But finally he had it
all fixed. He moved behind the camera, looked through
the finderâ€”and the lights on Treasure Island all went
out. It was 2 o'clock.

REFLEX ACTION

Saturday night early, when the Fair was crowded
with its thousands of holiday people, the lights on the
midway suddenly went off.
Immediately a host of cops rushed for the Sally
Rand Nude Ranch.
For the mutual protection of all concerned, I pre
sume.

SMILE

One of our activity presidents was jerked rudely
from sleep the other morning by a sophomore telling
him that United Press was on the phone and wanted
a statement about his activity.
The guy got out of bed and very importantly went
down to the phone. He gave quite an oratorical in
terview, I understand.
At its conclusion, the guy from United Press said
they would like a picture of the guy, and that they
would send a cameraman around that afternoon.
Big stud, said the guy, and dressed up ;if<cr lunch
to get his picture taken. He waited for the camera
man to come. No cameraman. He still waited. He
waited all afternoon. He broke a date with his girl
at Mills as the afternoon grew later. But no camera
man showed up.
Some grufT, but kindly brother had to tell him at
dinner that it was all a joke.
