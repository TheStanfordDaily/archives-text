# CAL CHESS MATCH
## 
### 
Tlie Editor, Sir:
It has been brought to my atten
tion by the members of the Univer
sity of California Chess Club that
there have been no interschool
matches with Stanford since 1927,
and also that the poor "Farm" boys
have not won a match since 1920.
Can it be that the Palo Altans
have been hibernating for the past
12 years, or have the Stanford mas
ters of the art of checkmating mere
ly become discouraged?
Surely there must be some stu
dents on the Stanford campus with
a knowledge of this grand old game.
Hoping that, there are, I extend on
behalf of the University of Califor
nia Chess Team, a challenge to any
group of Stanford chess players —

varsity, freshman, or what have
you. The time and place could be
arranged to the satisfaction of all, I
am sure.
We would appreciate your bring
ing this matter to the attention of
the Stanford student body, as the
Califomians arc just aching to
"scalp those Indians'' once again.
Respectfully yours,
Captain, California Chess Team
Charles Merrell, '40
