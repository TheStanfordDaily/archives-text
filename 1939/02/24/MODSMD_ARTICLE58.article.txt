### 
"REBECCA" by Daphne Du
Maurier; published by Doublcday,
Dora n.
A contribution to the long list of
modern psychological novels is this
latest book by the skilled young
English author, Daphne Du Maurier.

Rebecca died
one night when
her sailboat cap
sized in a driving
gale off the rocky
British coast. Her
husband, Maxim,
closed their coun
try estate and
wandered thru lgh
Europe. He met a
girl at Monte Car-

10. She was plain, unassuming, a
traveling companion of a rich and
faded widow. Maxim rescued her
from the garrulous and stupid
woman, married her, took her back
with him to England and Mander
ley, his ancestral home.
But this is not the story of Maxim
and his new bride. It's the subtly
woven tale of Rebecca, who lived
there with them. This is her book,
just as surely as Manderley was her
home, with its wooded drive, white
shingle of beach where the ocean
moved restlessly, patterned rose
garden, and flaming riot of rhodo
dendrons that surged outside the li
brary windows in the spring.
Rebecca sat with them at tea on
the lawn every afternoon at 4:30.
She stood in the minstrel's gallery
and looked down on the great hall
way. She walked with them among
the azaleas, and the echo of her si
lent laughter altered their lives. The
strange i*esidue of the dead shaped
their days together into strange,
twisted forms.
Daphne Du Maurier, who wrote
the best seller of a few years ago,
"Jamaica Inn," has created a char
acter that towers above the often
shallow small people of modern
fiction. With deft, sure stroke she
has painted image after image that
lingers, permanently beautiful. "Re
becca" is one of the best books of
the current season. â€”Hutchinson
