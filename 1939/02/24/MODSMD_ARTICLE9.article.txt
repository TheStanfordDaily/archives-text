# Drama Group To Give 'The Lower Depths'
## 
### 
"The Lower Depths," which is being given by the Division of Speech I
and Drama next Wednesday through Saturday, March 1 to 4, in the Little ;
Theater of Memorial Hall, was one of the first plays to usher in the era i
of social interpretation in the drama.
It tells the story of a group of Russians, who have fallen to the "low- j
est depths," as they come together in a flophouse. It was quite revolu-

tionary to the world of 1902,
one contemporary commentator said !
of Gorky: "The ugly cancers of the)
social system should never be ex- i
posed, especially by a candid hand! j
In art, to tell truths of this kind
does not alone shame the devil, but |
outrages the community."
Sets for the present production j
were designed by Bill Bassett and j
the costuming is under the direction j
of Ruth Cannon. Members of the
cast include Gordon Williams, Asher
Wilson, Mary Leles, J. Edwin Ar
nold, Douglas Bryan, Dana Winters,
Dorothy Leßaker, Shirley Jones,
Patty deßoulf, Garrett Starmer,
Charles Bulotti, J. P. Cahn, Dan Hol
tom, Merle Meacham, Fred Wur
ster and Adolfo Arias.
Director Thomas Wood Stevens is
directing the play t.o bring out the
maximum of comedy, although it
will be done against as bleak and
depressing a background as pos
sible.
Admission will be by scrip books
or 50 cents. Reservations may be
made by phoning 22141.
