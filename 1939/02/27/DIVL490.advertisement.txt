Much of the Patient's response to treat- S
ment depends on confidence in his Doctor.
Not only is there a physicial reaction to
this feeling of confidence in the method of ijjj
treatment, but the fact that you believe in I
your Doctor, causes you to follow instruc
tions more carefully.
This confidence of the Patient can come I
about through only one thing—satisfactory
d.j service and the knowledge that your Doctor I
is competent.
I This confidence of the Patient, is
the chief foundation of a Doctor's
practice. H
Naturally, it is up to the Doctor to render
the highest type of service, if for no other
than selfish reasons.
