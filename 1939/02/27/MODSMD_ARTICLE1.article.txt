start a movement, but to date
they have accomplished very little
that is remembered after the
morning papers are thrown away.
Originating in almost every case

campaigns habitually fall into a

This week-end it. was the students
of Warsaw who staged a rally, not
to buck up their athletic teams, but
to encourage war between Poland
and Germany. With typical colle
giate enthusiasm, they broke through
police lines last Saturday and broke
all the windows in the Nazi em
bassy.
This was followed up yesterday
with a demonstration, which led to
a resolution that all German stu
dents will be barred from Polish
universities for one day in reprisal
for actions of young Nazis in the
free city of Danzig. The entire pro
cedure is extremely undiplomatic,
considering that Italian Foreign
Minister Ciano is visiting Warsaw at
the present time for the purpose of
improving relations between Poland
and the totalitarian states.

HPIIE source of the trouble is not
a new one. It involves the
struggle for the control of the port
of Danzig which has been going
on under cover ever since it was
established as a free state by the
Treaty of Versailles.
Nazi students started a move for
German domniation of the city last
week, and college men in Warsaw
retaliated with the week-end's dem
onstrations. The situation is worthy
of world notice because it may
mean disaster in the not too distant
future.

fused to come across on such terms.
