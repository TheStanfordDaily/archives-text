### 
CHATTANOOGA. Tcnn., Feb. 2G
(UP). â€”After 25 years the conscience
of a Rome, Ga., housewife has con
vinced her that she should return
an umbrella carried from a street
car way back in 1914.
"I have never felt right to keep
it," she said in her letter to the street
car company which accompanied
the umbrella. "I shall appreciate it
very much if you can find the owner
and return the umbrella."
