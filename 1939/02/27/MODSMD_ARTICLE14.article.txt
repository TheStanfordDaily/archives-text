j Stanford graduated Hans Otto
i Storm as an engineer—not as an
I author—back in 1920.
Although John Steinbeck has be-
I come one of the best known of ex
j Stanfordites in the literary field with
"Of Mice and Men," Mr. Storm has
been accorded considerable recog
nition from leading book reviewers
of the country for "Pity the Tyrant."
"It was a critical success," Mr.
| Storm said proudly. "In spite of
that, I just came out about even
financially on the deal.."
Mr. Storm's profession, which has
occupied his time between novels
and which has caused the writing of
j his first two books, is that of co
! ordinating engineer for Globe Wire
less in San Francisco.
He recently returned from Peru,
where at Lima he installed a trans
mitter for the government, which
was installed in connection with the
Pan-American Conference, because
the officials wanted a press service
they couldn't get by cable. Both
| United Press and Associated Press
| used the transmitter, he said, along
I with Havas and the big Buenos
; Aires news agency.
It was in 1931, when Mr. Storm
j was working for All-American Ca
| bles in Peru, that he got hi.s mate
rial for "Pity the Tyrant." The ty
rant was Dictator Leguia who had
just, been imprisoned after 11 stormy
J years at the head of the Peruvian
government.
I "Leguia comes into the book "Pity
I the Tyrant" more as a symbol. It is
i a comedy on the manners of the
■ people and a satire on the life in
j Peru, while throughout it runs a
> theme of politics in general as played
| in different pails of the world," he
j remarked.
