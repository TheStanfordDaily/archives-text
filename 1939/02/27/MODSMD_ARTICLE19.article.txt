# Steinbeck Committee Begins Work
## First Meeting Will Attack Migratory Worker Question 
### 
Scheduling its first general meet
ing Wednesday afternoon, the Stan
ford Steinbeck Committee, organ
ized to attack the California migra
tory labor problem, begins to get its
many-sided pi'ogram into operation.
The committee is named for John
Steinbeck, famous as the author of
"Of Mice and Men," whose pamph
let, "Their Blood Is Strong," has
drawn widespread attention to con
ditions among the migratory work
ers of the state.
The Steinbeck Committee was or
ganized as a result of student inter
est shown in the clothing drive last
month. On the steering committee
are Otis Brubaker, Gene Glasmann,
Mary Beaton, and Andries Deinum.
CO-OPERATION OFFERED
The organization reports offers of
co-operation from various San
Francisco groups interested in the
same problem. At the Farm Secur
ity Administration offices, Fred
Saoul, public relations officer for the
Western Division, offered to furnish
speakers, literature, and the gov
ernment film, "The River," for a
campus showing. He said student
visits to migrant labor camps of the
region can be arranged.
The Simon Lubin Society offered
literature on the problem, and of
fered to send speakers to the cam
pus, among them being Ellen Hos
mer, executive secretary of the
society.
VISIT LABOR UNION
Headquarters of the Cannery
Workers' Union and the State Re
lief Administration also were visit
ed, as members of the steering com
mittee investigated the extent of the
migrant labor problem and what
Stanford students can do to amelio
rate the problem.
The situation is most acute in
California, it was pointed out to the
committeemen, because of Califor
nia's high proportion of the large
scale farms of the United States.
