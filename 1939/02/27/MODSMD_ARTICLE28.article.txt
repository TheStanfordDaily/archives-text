ORIGINATED IN ENGLAND
Peace Day originated in England
nearly 10 years ago, appeared on the
Atlantic coast two years later, and
since 1935 has been observed na
tionally. The movement took the
form of an anual 11 o'clock walk-out
strike by students in colleges and
high schools, as a protest against
war, every April 22.
At Stanford, however, full co
operation on the part of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises and oth
er administrative departments has
i made Peace Day a University ob
servance since 1936. In that year
Norman Thomas, candidate for Pres-
ident on the Socialist ticket in 1928
and 1932, spoke at the student as-
sembly. Chester Rowell, editor of
the San Francisco Chronicle, was
the speaker in 1937, and Owen Latti-
j more, well-known author and trav
eler, spoke in 1938.
