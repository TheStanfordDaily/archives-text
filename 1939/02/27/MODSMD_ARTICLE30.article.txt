# Saito, Envoy From Japan, Dies Suddenly
## Young Nipponese Serves as Diplomat For Nearly 5 Years 
### 
WASHINGTON. Feb. 2G (UP).â€”
Hiroshi Saito, 53, the youngest man
ever to hold the job of Japanese am
bassador to the United Slates, died
suddenly early today following a
relapse in his fight against tubercu
losis.
He came to Washington as ambas
sador in 1934 and served for nearly
live years, until replaced recently
by Kensuke Horinouchi.
His widow, Madame Miyoko Saito,
was at his bedside when death came
at 1:30 a.m. Funeral services will
be held at the Japanese embassy on
Tuesday, after which the body will
be cremated and the ashes taken
back to Japan by Madame Saito.
Saito's health began to fail many
months ago while he was under in
tense diplomatic pressure growing
from his country's invasion of China.
Incidents involving American lives
and interests in China drew sharp
protests from the State Department
and made Saito's post one of the
most difficult on Diplomatic Row.
One of the shrewdest and best
liked members of the diplomatic
corps, Saito entered diplomacy after
graduating from the ultra-exclusive
Peers' School in Tokyo. He served
for seven years as an attache at the
embassy here and subsequently as
consul at Seattle, Wash., consul gen
eral at New York, attache at the
London embassy, and minister to
Holland.
Approximately one-fourth of Uni
versity of Texas students who take
pure and applied mathematics end
tlx ir courses with failing grades.
