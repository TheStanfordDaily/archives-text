## 
### 
"Apocalyptic literature resulted
from the early belief that only a
miracle could lighten the burdens of
the world; when no miracle occurred,
apocalypticism developed to 'clear
the name of God'," declared Rev.
Thomas E. Oliver, acting chaplain
of the University, in his sermon yes
terday.
"The attitude of apocalypticism
and the literature resulting from it
are not constructive," said Rever
end Oliver, "but instead are products
of despair. The present conditions
of unemployment and the breakdown
of peace are causing a similar effect,
and the resultant literature is riot
unlike the apocalyptic writings."
The chaplain stated that in his
opinion the attitude of the unem
ployed of today is that "nothing can

[ be done unless God does it."
There are three lessons to be drawn
j from the Book of Revelations, said
Dr. Oliver. "First, when conditions
lon earth become unbearable, men
turn to God; second, the rainbow is
| a sign of God's mercy to man; third,
I life and death are controlled from
j Heaven."
i Using the rainbow as a symbol of
j God's leniency toward all men. Dr.
Oliver warned that "there arc dan
gers in apocalyptic literature and
one must not lose sight of the rain
bow."
The New Testament lesson was
taken from the Book of Revelations.
Choir selections were "Ave Verum
Corpus" by Mozart and "The Lord
j Bless You and Keep You" by Lut-
I kin. Professor Warren D. Allen
'played the organ selections.
