## Cards Take 6-5 Win From Tiring Rivals En Final 2 Minutes 
### 
Stanford ruggers came through to
win the game with the Olympic-
Club and take the Northern Rugby
Union title in the closing minutes of
the game after trailing on the wrong
end of the score for the better part
of the game. Jake Thompson bound
ed out of a mess of Stanford and
Olympic Club players strewn around
the Winged O goal line to make the
deciding try of the game which
boosted the Cards to a ti-5 victory.
In the early part of the game the
Olympians were down in Stanford
territory most of the time. A few
minutes after the kick-oft' Stanford's
Lymie Calkins prevented an Olym
pic try by falling on the ball. Cal
kins showed his usual accurate boot
ing ability in keeping the ball com
ing back at the Olympics whenever
it got too close to the Card goal.
INDIANS COME TO LIFE
During the later part of the first
half the Cards showed new life and
made some rushes on the Olympic
goal, but without success. The tide
of the game for the duration of the
half flowed fajrly evenly from one
team to the other, â€¢ with rapid ex
changes of the ball from Stanford to
Olympic hands and feet, the half
ending with a kicking duel between
Lymie Calkins and Jim Muliln, an
ex-Stanford man.
In the second half Doug Crowe
scored a try for the Olympic Club
only after dragging Lymie Calkins
over the goal with him. This try
was the result of another series of
Olympic Club rushes against the
Card goal line. Jim Mullin converted
to make the score 5-0 in favor of
the Olympic Club.
CONDITIONING SHOWS
In the last part of the second half
the Olympic Club began to show its
lack of condition compared to the
Stanford team, and they began to
show signs of weariness. The Cards
started to hammer at the Olympics
goal and Vic Musy cinched the deal
by making the first try for Stanford
and raising the score 5-3, Gerlach
missing the conversion.
Then with only minutes left to
play the Cards continued their
drive and scored another try, mak
ing the score 6-5 for the finish.
Olympic B team defeated the Stan
ford B team 7-0.
