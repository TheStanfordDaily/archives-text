# Card Hoopsters Do Cal Good Turn
## 
### 
Stanford and Cal ought to be
cousins, as far as most basketball
experts are able to figure it.
Jan. 15, the Indian hoopmen un
expectedly did their deadly rivals a
good turn when they lowered the
boom on the Trojans. Because of
that victory Cal's lumbering Bears
are heading for the Southern Divi
sion crown with a single game lead
over U.S.C.
The experts had it all figured out
over the week-end that the cage
race would be settled when Cal and
the Trojans mixed at Berkeley, but
the best the clubs could do was di
vide the important series. They
spilt down south two weeks ago, so
it all boils down ot Jan. 15, when
Stanford played cousin for a night
to Cal and whacked the daylights
out of the second-place men of Troy.
While Cal and S.C. were unable
to settle their differences the locals
unimpressively handed U.C.L.A. its
2(>th and 27th successive cage de
feats, 38-32 and 37-33. It was un
impressive mostly because three
regulars, Don Burness. Bob Bur
nett, and Bill Rapp, were left at
home with injuries of one sort or
another.
Don Williams came out of the
Bruin tussles with splendid per
formances at center, where Bur
ness usually leads the attack. Wil
liams sank 10 points in the first
game when Captain Phil Zonne
tanked 12, and then lead the scorers
Saturday night with 11 points.
