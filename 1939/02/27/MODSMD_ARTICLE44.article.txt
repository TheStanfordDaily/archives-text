# Card Nine Wins 2 to 1 Over Broncs
## 
### 
Quentin "Cootie" Thompson won
his first full conference baseball
game in convincing fashion Satur
day as he fireballed Stanford to a
2 to 1 win over Santa Clara.
Thompson struck out 11 and gave
only three hits to the Broncos, one
of which was a mighty triple by
Paul Claudon, Santa Clara first
baseman. His total season record
now is eight hits, one earned run,
36 strike-outs, and five walks in 24
innings.
While Thompson was holding the
visitors in check, the Indian offense
was having its share of trouble with
Les Bricca's side-arm floater. It
wasn't until the last of the seventh
inning that Stanford finally scored.
With two men out and Bill Jamie
son and Bob Ditlevsen on third and
second, Bricca elected to purposely
walk Herb Bull to set up an easy
third out. Bull, feigning complete
disgust, made a motion to walk out
of the batter's box which forced
Bricca into an involuntary balk.
Jamieson then automatically scored
from third. Monte Pfyl came through
with a pinch single in the eighth to
score Glenn South with the winning
tally.
Stanford's offense still continued to
be a negative quantity with the In
dians managing to collect only five
singles off Bricca. iWth a .667 aver
age in league play thus far in the
campaign, Stanford will journey to
Moraga Wednesday in an attempt to
upset, the strong St. Mary's aggrega
tion in their second game.
Finals of the Hahn Tournament
held last week were won by Fresh
man Jack Chappie.
