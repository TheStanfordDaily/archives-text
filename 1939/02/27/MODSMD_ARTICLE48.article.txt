# Boxers Slaughter Berkeley Squad
## Leathermen Punch Out Seven Wins Bear Heavyweight Forfeits Main Event To Johnny Ward 
### 
Winning all seven of the matches
that went to a decision and losing
only three by default and injuries,
Stanford's boxing varsity slaughter
ed the Cal leather pushers last Fri
day* night in the Pavilion. Stanford
won an eighth match when Forrest
Dußois of Cal forfeited to John
Ward in the heavyweight division.
Cal's three victories were gained
when Stanford's 135-pound John
Wilson received a cut over the right
eye from John Drachnik and the
match was called. Similarly, 165-
pound Herb Gunn was forced to quit
because of an eye cut in the first
round of his match with Jesse Swan.
Stanford forfeited the 120-pound
match.
FANS DISAPPOINTED
The big disapopintment of the
evening was the forfeit of the heavy
weight match, which the fans were
looking forward to. Johnny Ward's
supremacy in this weight went un
contested as Forrest Dußois of Cal
evidently deemed it advisable not to
fight.
In the first match of the evening
Stanford's Bruce Berg out-pointed
George Sakanari in a sloppy exhibi
tion. Both were wild and couldn't
seem to connect.
SKILLFUL FIGHTING
Compensating for this was Jack
Rice's skillful fighting. Using right
uppercuts and left jabs, Rice knock
ed Juel Roubay to the canvas twice
in an onslaught that lasted all three
rounds.
Charles Mclntyre, 145 - pound
Cardinal, dazed John Nielson in the
first round and carried the other
rounds to a decision.
Stanford's southpaw. Doug Grant,
closed in on Wilson Lord, using
rights and lefts to the face. Groggy,
Lord lasted the three rounds.
Bill Wilbur got the judges' nod
over George Shipley, landing left
jabs that Shipley could not handle.
Tom Mac Michael and Cal's Ty Barre
split the first two rounds, but in the
last Mac Michael tagged Barre with
enough lefts and rights to the face
to win.
Bill Greer consistently tied up Jim
McDowell of Cal and then slashed
him with rights and lefts to face
and stomach.
