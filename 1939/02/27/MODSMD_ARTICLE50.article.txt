## 
### CHARLES BULL 
The big flop of the Card frosh-
Fullerton J. C. swim meet came
when John Pollack laughingly fell
through ten dives from the 10-foot
board. Realizing that Fullerton had
only two divers and Stanford had
none, Pollack knew that anyone

won the meet 45-30, and also set

out on the short end of a 50-25
score. The only three Card firsts
were taken by Johnny Lamb in the
50; Roy Winkelmann in the diving;
and Bill Weden, backstroke.
The big flop of the Card frosh-
Fullerton J. C. swim meet came
when John Pollack laughingly fell
through ten dives from the 10-foot
board. Realizing that Fullerton had
only two divers and Stanford had
none, Pollack knew that anyone
with nerve enough to risk a belly
! (lop could get the cinch third-place
I point.
i
Alter the event, with red back and
crimson chest, Pollack, by the
'smack of his back," had slapped up
one point to the "S" side of the
scoreboard. The frosh eventually
won the meet 45-30, and also set
three new U. S. Collegiate freshman
records and four University records
at the same time.
MORE RECORDS TOPPLE
Paul Herron, bane of the reeord
j keepers' existence and captain of
i the Card frosh swimmers, lowered
1 two more times last Friday. He beat
i the national mark of 2:IG, which he
} set at San Jose three weeks ago, with
| a flashing 2:14.4 time in the 220-yd.
free style. Then he flopped over onto
his back into the 20-yard pool and
set a new U.S. frosh record in the
1 150-yd. backstroke. His time was
■ 1:37.9. Both of these'were new Uni-
I versify records.
The frosh medley relay team of

Jim Canning, Scott Dudley, and
Gardiner Miller scratched off the
national frosh record set by last
year's Card team of Vitousek,
Weeden, and Wiper, with a race of
o:08.5. The old time was 3:09.9.
VARSITY DUMPED
Stanford's varsity swimmers, who
met Olympic Club from San Fran
cisco Saturday afternoon, did not
fare so well as the frosh. They came
out on the short end of a 50-25
score. The only three Card firsts
were taken by Johnny Lamb in the
50; Roy Winkelmann in the diving;
and Bill Weden, backstroke.
