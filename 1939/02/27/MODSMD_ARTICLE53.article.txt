IN the midst of the greatest rearmament pro
gram the world has ever staged, a small
group of Stanford men and women is in the
process of planning Stanford's Peace Day, this
year to be held April 20.
Negative though it may sound, such plan
ning seems little more than futile in the face
of reports such as the following out of New
York, where the German-American Bund' and
the anti-Nazi Young Socialists and Commu
nists recently staged the preliminary steps to
a situation far from peaceful:
"They were grim, intense, and angry, and an
almost violent hatred was very much in evi
dence. Only a few arrests were made, but the
emergency hospitals were jammed . . . many
persons were clubbed to the point of bleeding
and the mounted police, endeavoring to clear
the fleets, trampled a great many more."
Such is the stuff of wars —civil and other
wise.
Peace, recognized as a desirable state, to be
realized, will take more than planning a "Peace
Day"—it will take even far more than plan
ning 100 more battleships or the administra
tion of a new and enlarged army.
It will take more courage, more foresight
to win peace than to fight wars.
The Peace Day committee is making a step
in the right direction. It, at least, is positive in
its actions. Under the circumstances, however,
the most it can do is call attention to peace,
hope that the campus will be interested for
the time being.
But peace, and the planning of that peace,
must soon be put on a full-time basis.
