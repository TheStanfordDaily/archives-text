# The
						Wise Committee

### 
STANFORD'S system of granting incompletes
had been bogging down seriously until
last week, when the administration took steps.
From now on, it was ruled, an incomplete in a
course will be considered a failure until it has
been made up. Effect of this is that a student
now goes on probation for too many incom
pletes as well as for too many flunks.
When the system was inaugurated, nobody
thought of taking an incomplete for anything
but illness or some other emergency. Little by
little, however, students began to look upon
the system as a good thing—a big convenience
to the student who found himself swamped as
quarterly examinations neared. If he wanted to
wait a quarter and try for a better grade,, or if
he was just tired, all he had to do was take an
incomplete in the course.
And although his grade for the course was
listed as a flunk in the Bawlout, it was con
sidered a "C" by the Committee on Scholar
ship. From now on it will be considered a
flunk in both records until made up.
The Committee on Scholarship was wise to
take this step to curtail manipulation of grade
credit.
It was wise also when it reserved discretion
in the matter, so it can allow incompletes as
before, wherever it feels certain they are le
gitimate.—R. D.
