# Turn Back the Clock
## 
### 
EVERY once in a long while Stanford forgets
to be smooth and sophisticated. It ex
changes its gabardines for jeans, its cashmeres
for sweatshirts, and has a swell time in spite
of itself. Such times are the Big Game bonfire,
class barbecues, and the Convalescent Home
Labor Day.
This week again students are going to dis
card temporarily their bored post-Depression
exteriors to discover that they can have fun
without bridge, cocktail bars, and big name
bands. Boathouse Day will provide the excuse
for Stanford's return to the rough, to those
palmy days when the campus got excited over
the king-queen contest and the quality of Union
coffee.
After a day of water sports, students will
turn their sun-burned faces toward the deck of
the Boathouse where Dr. Wilbur and Beebs
Lee will dedicate the new aquatic pleasure
palace quickly and concisely. Everyone will
gorge himself at the barbecue, which promises
not to depart from the traditional contest to see
who can get the most seconds. Next come the
last Cal game for excitement and the dance for
50 cents —and romance.
It will take an extremely callous young
Stanfordite to state honestly that he wouldn't
enjoy Boathouse Day.
Somehow, every once in a while someone

graduates from Stanford who has managed to
slip through the mill without having been sub
jected to any of the experiences he would have
missed at another university. If a man ignores
those days of complete informality, those spe
cial events when Stanford democracy means a
great deal more than a "hello" on the Quad,
he's passed up one of the best things the Farm
has to offer.
Without the trouble or expense of a trip to
Yosemite, Carmel, or a City hotel, students can
have a wonderful time next Saturday, Boat
house Day. Anyone who refuses to believe this
had better stay at home and observe the decay
of civilization —in a textbook.—L. L.
