### JOHN COBBS 
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
C'OR the past week or so newspapers all over the
country have given enthusiastic display to stories
which read in effect: "Dear Business —Come home. All
is forgiven.— (Signed) Roosevelt." Industry has not
had time to react to this new sweetness and light
policy, and the opinion of the well-known Average
American is still unsounded. But we know that at
Stanford the students have received it with quiet re
joicing and thanksgiving.
To a logician, Stanford's attitude would probably
be distressing; to a reformer it would be infuriating.
In our classes we have studied the business set-up in
America, and we have learned that in some aspects it
is unquestionably third rate. The New Deal, we know,
is attempting to correct the evils of the present order.
Therefore, to be consistent we should organize our
selves into a little Roosevelt cheering squad, and should
yell encouragement every time business gets its hands
slapped.

But instead, Stanford receives the new love-thy
neighbor policy of the New Deal with relieved sighs.
The logicians have cause to be distressed.
The philosophy behind Stanford's attitude seems to
be logical lacework, but the explanation is simple.
Four years is usually the top limit on the time we are
permitted to sit here under the shelter of dear alma
mater's skirts, passing judgment on the world. After
that we have to get jobs, and when we are filling out
application forms we are not nearly as much con
cerned with the future economic system as we are
with the present one.

IT IS pleasant to sit in class and talk about revisions
in mechanisms of distribution. It is comforting to
explain the px-esent turmoil by saying that business is
acting like a spoiled child, pounding its heels and
screaming because it can't do just as it wants.
But when we start writing letters to personnel
managers we can't tell them to stop behaving like
sulky little boys. If they say business is shot to hell,
we won't get ourselves a vice-presidency by sending
them an econ text.

When we are well insulated with checks from home,
we are safe in handling terms like "readjustment" and
"revision." But we know that without that protection,
the words would be too hot for us to hold. When we
get out of school we want to be job-holders, not mani
festations of short run disequilibrium.
And so we are relieved to see business coaxed out
of its sulk. It may take a little intellectual squirming
to justify our attitude, but we manage it.
Assorted conclusions might be drawn from our
reaction. A Marxist would say that even intellectual
dry-cleaning can't remove the spots of the bourgeois
leopard. Reformers would wail that we have lost the
spirit of sacrifice that sustained the early mailyrs when
Nero was using them in his lighting system. Person
ally, I draw no conclusions. All I know is that before
long I will have to get a job, and if I don't get one,
I'll find damn little comfort in calling myself an
aspect of readjustment.
