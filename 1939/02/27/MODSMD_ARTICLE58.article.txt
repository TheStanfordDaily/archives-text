# Lightly ... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
FROM THE RIDICULOUS
Some people make the Saturday Evening Post, a
few make the New Yorker or Harpers, but I have
made an English A exam.
One of my columns was lifted bodily by one of
the instructors, and handed to his students as a thing
which needed correcting.
To quote the instructor's directions at the top of
the column:
"The following bit of prose is not. good prose, but
it could be. There are egregious errors in punctua
tion. grammar, and diction; some of the sentences, as
they stand, are completely meaningless and, of course,
will need to be rewritten."

Well. For the third time in a week people have
told me that I have grounds to sue for libel. That
is nonsense, of course; still, it sounds good for a
â€¢ change after hearing the vice-versa all year.
"Some of the sentences, as they stand, are com
pletely meaningless." the instructor writes. At
one point in that, column I wrote, "But then there
are those very, very beautiful record programs to
keep you entertained. Yeah." I can see that in
structor making a full sentence, with subject and
predicate and probably a few adjectives out of
the word. "Yeah."
By itself his sentence would probably look very
beautiful. If that's any criteria.
But of course I was working toward one end; the
instructor was having his kids work toward another.
There is nothing to argue about. But. I'm quite sure
that if I had made that column grammatically cor
rect and full of absolutely nothing but perfect diction
and punctuation, it would have been even less in
teresting than it was. And "egregious" is a harsh
word.
That same instructor, I hear, has on several morn
ings come into his English A class and said to his
class, "After reading that column, I pat myself on the
back and say, '( ), old boy, you're not such a
bad writer after all'."
It's nice to know that this column does something
for someone.
Yet every time I walk by the English Corner, I say
to myself, "Thank God I'm not smart enough to bo an
English A instructor."
