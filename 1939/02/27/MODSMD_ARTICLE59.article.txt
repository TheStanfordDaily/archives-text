### 
"GUNGA DIN," playing through
Tuesday at the Fox-Stanford.
Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem
and it has helped win more high
school declamation contests than
any other comparable amount of
rhyme.'
RKO-Radio turned loose ace
story-men Ben Hecht and Charles

Mac Arthur, gave
the results a good
cast, and the
product is a solid
show that is long
on thrills and ac
■ tion.
Against the
gaunt rocks that
form the Khyber
Pass, India's back
door to the wastes

of Afghanistan, these kilted Scottish
Highlanders preserve the suprem
acy of Her Majesty's empire.
The particular Scotsmen we're
concerned with are Cary Grant, Vic
McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks,
Jr. With complete abandon, they
spend most of the picture slugging
natives, tossing lighted sticks of dy
namite, rescuing each other from
the clutches of wily and frenzied
chieftains who are bent on conquer
ing the civilized world, a la Napo
leon and Hannibal.
Regimental bhisti is played by Sam
JafTe, who does a neat job with a
role that everyone thought would be
stereotyped. His bugle - blowing
saves the day and his reward comes
a little late for him to properly ap
preciate it.
Even Rudyard Kipling himself has
been written in, with heavy dark
beard and thick-lensed glasses. He's
on hand for the last scene. "Gunga
Din" is good entertainment.
On the same bill are a March of
Time, dealing with Mexico and
Youth in America; a Popeye car
toon; and a newsreel.
