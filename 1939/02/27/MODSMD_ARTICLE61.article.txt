The Editor, Sir:
It may interest you to know that
the postmistress of the village of Ma- ,
drone, Calif., is highly annoyed, j
Among her extra duties is the re- ;
ceiving and redispatching of letters
addressed not only to householders
living on Madrone Steets all up and
down the state but also bushels of
letters (some on scented stationary)
addressed to females resident at one
Madrono House, Stanford Univer
sity. She is, as I say, provoked, and
wishes that the university would al
ter the name of the young ladies'
residence to something like, for in
stance, "Shangri-la" or "House A."
