# QUIET, PLEASE!

The Editor, Sir:
Before coming to Stanford I
thought that the radio was really a
gift from the gods. But in my short
stay here I have come to hate it
exquisitely.
And after tossing around in my
bed trying to fall asleep on the
nights I had a chance to go to bed
early, I have hit on what I think Ls
a solution of this problem. It is this:
that all radio owners be compelled
to substitute headphones for speak
ers on their radios.
There will of course be other nois
es extant after that of the radio will
disappear. The wrestlers on the floor
above, the coming Caruso, the em
bryo track stars practicing on the
stairway, the booming-voiced Span
ish-vocabulai-y student, the practic

ing yell leaders, and the future Dor- j
say will still continue to do their!
stuff.
But all these disturbances do notj
seem as bad as that of the galloping j
radio. And the solution for the ex
it of this noise is so very simple and '
inexpensive. A pair of headphones
can be bought at anywhere from
98 ccnts to $1.50.
Oh Lord, please let this pass!
