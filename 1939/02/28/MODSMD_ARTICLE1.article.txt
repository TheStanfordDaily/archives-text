### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
E, 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean
blue—and a few other things hap
pened too. For one, the united hous
es of CastiUe and Aragon conquered
Grenada, the last Moorish strong
hold on the peninsula, and estab
lished the kingdom of Spain, which
endured, more or less undisturbed,
until 1931.
After centuries of autocratic rule
by Hapsburgs and Bourbons, democ
racy finally arrived in Spain nearly
150 years after the French Revolu
tion. But the Republican govern
ment was not destined to last long.
By 1936 Fascists had started a re
volt which soon grew to the pro
portions of a civil war. Their victory
signified a return to absolutism in
Spain.
* * *
Yesterday the Republic officially
died. France and Italy struck the
final blow when they uncondi
tionally recognized the new Na
tionalist government of Francisco
Franco. Now that every major
power in Europe has granted the
former Insurgents recognition ex
cept Soviet Russia, there can be
no question that they are firmly
established; how permanently,
time will tell.
Franco received the French and
British stamps of approval without
having satisfied the desires of the
two democracies, that he grant am
nesty to the leaders of the Loyalists
and that he insure the withdrawal
of foreign troops from Spain. De
spite this slight, Messrs. Chamberlain
and Daladier have been forced to
realize the inevitable. With Fascism
victorious, it won't do the liberal
governments any good to shut their
eyes and pretend it hasn't happened.
* * *
[VfEAN WHILE England is doing
everything in her power to pro
tect the defeated Republicans from
the vengeance of their conquerors.
Former Premier Juan Negrin has
agreed to co-operate with the Brit
ish in evacuating his followers from
Madrid and Valencia and shipping
the leaders over the Spanish fron
tier.
It will take months of recon
struction before the Nationalist
government can begin to operate
on a peace-time basis. How far
into the seemingly bottomless lake
of absolutism Franco will plunge
is still a question. It is doubtful
that he will descend to the race
myths and medieval persecution
of the Hitler regime, and more
likely that he will follow a pattern
of national regimentation similar
to that of the early years of Mus
solini's ride.

IS fine indeed to be able to
boast of an empire on which the
sun never sets, but there are times
when far-flung colonial possessions
turn out to be very little more than
damn nuisances. In Palestine Eng
land finds itself faced with an ex
tremely troublesome problem, one of
those pains in the neck which
Disraeli failed to consider when he
purchased the Suez Canal and es
tablished the basis for British dom
ination of the Near East.
Yesterday the conference that is
meeting in London to try to work
out a solution for the Holy Land
was extremely excited over a proj
ect of Colonial Secretary Malcolm
McDonald to abandon the idea of
making Palestine a Jewish national
home and to turn it over to the
Arabs. In the face of the current
non-Aryan persecution in the Reich
and the search for a land to which
the German Jews can migrate, the
new proposal is not exactly a mas
ter diplomatic stroke.

Naturally the Jewish represen
tatives at the congress rebelled
against the plan which would
gradually expropriate all but a
"permanent minority" of their
countrymen. U. S. Ambassador
Joseph Kennedy called at the for
eign office to warn the British that
such a move undoubtedly will re
sult in an unfavorable reaction on
this side of the Atlantic, and re
tired Supreme Court Justice
Brandcis wired a protest on he
half of American Jews.
Jusl how the government is going
to extricate itself from the Pales
tine mess is problematical. The
Arabs believe that England has
promised them the territory, and the
Jews are convinced that it .should
go to them. Bitter experience has
shown that compromises fail to
solve problems like this. Ramsey
McDonald's son has picked himself
a tough nut to crack, and it looks
like the canny Scot will have to do
some fast talking to get himself out
of this one.
r I I HE Polish situation today pre
sents all the aspects of a para
dox. While Italian Foreign Minister
Ciano is busy in Warsaw making
every effort to win the Poles away
from their alliance with France,
German and Polish students were
battling in the streets over the cur
rent Nazi move for domination of
Danzig.
This puis all parties concerned
in uncomfoi'tahle positions be
cause the Poles are simultaneous
ly being wooed by one end of the
Home-Berlin axis and being kick

into the seemingly bottomless lake
of absolutism Franco will plunge

IS fine indeed to be able to
boast of an empire on which the
sun never sets, but there are times
when far-flung colonial possessions
turn out to be very little more than
damn nuisances. In Palestine Eng
land finds itself faced with an ex
tremely troublesome problem, one of
those pains in the neck which
Disraeli failed to consider when he
purchased the Suez Canal and es
tablished the basis for British dom
ination of the Near East.
Yesterday the conference that is
meeting in London to try to work
out a solution for the Holy Land
was extremely excited over a proj
ect of Colonial Secretary Malcolm
McDonald to abandon the idea of
making Palestine a Jewish national
home and to turn it over to the
Arabs. In the face of the current
non-Aryan persecution in the Reich
and the search for a land to which
the German Jews can migrate, the
new proposal is not exactly a mas
ter diplomatic stroke.

Naturally the Jewish represen
tatives at the congress rebelled
against the plan which would
gradually expropriate all but a
"permanent minority" of their
countrymen. U. S. Ambassador
Joseph Kennedy called at the for
eign office to warn the British that
such a move undoubtedly will re
sult in an unfavorable reaction on
this side of the Atlantic, and re
tired Supreme Court Justice
Brandcis wired a protest on he
half of American Jews.
Jusl how the government is going
to extricate itself from the Pales
tine mess is problematical. The
Arabs believe that England has
promised them the territory, and the
Jews are convinced that it .should
go to them. Bitter experience has
shown that compromises fail to
solve problems like this. Ramsey
McDonald's son has picked himself
a tough nut to crack, and it looks
like the canny Scot will have to do
some fast talking to get himself out
of this one.

Ciano is busy in Warsaw making

from their alliance with France,
German and Polish students were

rent Nazi move for domination of
Danzig.
This puis all parties concerned

hold on the peninsula, and estab

endured, more or less undisturbed,
until 1931.
After centuries of autocratic rule
by Hapsburgs and Bourbons, democ

150 years after the French Revolu
tion. But the Republican govern
ment was not destined to last long.

Yesterday the Republic officially
died. France and Italy struck the
final blow when they uncondi
tionally recognized the new Na
tionalist government of Francisco
Franco. Now that every major
power in Europe has granted the
former Insurgents recognition ex
cept Soviet Russia, there can be
no question that they are firmly
established; how permanently,
time will tell.
Franco received the French and
British stamps of approval without
having satisfied the desires of the
two democracies, that he grant am
nesty to the leaders of the Loyalists
and that he insure the withdrawal
of foreign troops from Spain. De
spite this slight, Messrs. Chamberlain
and Daladier have been forced to
realize the inevitable. With Fascism
victorious, it won't do the liberal
governments any good to shut their
eyes and pretend it hasn't happened.
