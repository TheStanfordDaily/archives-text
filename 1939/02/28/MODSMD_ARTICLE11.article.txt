"The Death Rate of Machinery"
was the subject of a radio talk giv
en by Eugene L. Grant, associate
professor of economics of engineer
ing, on the regular Stanford Univer
sity Radio Hour last night.
"This question of the death rate of
machinery is important from many
different viewpoints," said Professor
Grant. "It proved to be a serious
matter to one man who put all of
his small capital into a motor truck.
It is important to big business as
well as to small business. It has
been aptly said that all machinery is
on an irresistible march to the scrap
heap."
Professor Grant continued by
pointing out reasons why machinery
does not get to the scrap heap. He
compared the death rate of ma
chinery to human mortality tables
because of the many ways in which
machines are like human beings.
