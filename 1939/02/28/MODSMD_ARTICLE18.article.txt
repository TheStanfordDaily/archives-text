# Senator Hits Foreign Policy
## Vandenburg Attacks Government Secrecy 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 (UP).—
The Senate opened debate on Pres.
Roosevelt's military expansion bill
today with a charge by Senator Ar
thur H. Vandenberg (R., Mich.) the
administration is borrowing inter
national 1 rouble by carrying a chip
on its shoulder and keeping the
public in ignorance of foreign policy
moves.
Vandenberg got the first blow on
foreign policy shortly after Chair
man Morris Sheppard (D., Texas) of
the Senate Military Affairs Commit
tee, pleaded for enactment of the
$358,000,000 bill which authorizes an
increase in army air corps strength
to 6,000 planes.
Declaring there is no safety zone
"where a truculent Uncle Sam can
stand with a chip on his shoulder
and be sure no one can knock it off,"
Vandenberg bitterly criticized the
policy of adopting methods "short of
war" to aid other democratic na
tions.
Such a policy, he charged, leads
the public to believe "we can be
half in and half out." of any conflict,
whereas actually there is no middle
course. Because of the importance
of foreign policy and its relationship
to defense, he said, there should be
"no restraint" in openly discussing
both.
Opening of the debate coincided
with the disclosure by Sheppard's
committee that Maj. Gen. Henry H.
Arnold, chief of the Army Air
Corps, secretly testified the War De
partment is seeking to determine the
truth and possibilities of a report.
Germany has developed an aerial
bomb of a quarter of a mile."
