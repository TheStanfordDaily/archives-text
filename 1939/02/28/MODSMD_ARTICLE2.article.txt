# $20,000 Fund Granted By Carnegie Corporation For Terman Research
## Stanford Psychologist to Contact 'Tested Tots' Selected in 1922 To Check on Present Livelihood 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Back in 1922 I)r. Ixjwis IW. Terman, famous Stanford psychologist, sin
gled out 1,400 of California's most sifted children for long-term psycho
logical study. Today I)r. Ray Lyman Wilbur announced that the Carnegie
Corporation of New York has granted $20,000 to Stanford for an intensive
follow-up to determine what those children have achieved in school, in
college, and in life. +

Now in their late twenties and
early thirties, the "Terman-Tested
Tots" will be contacted by four field
Assistants, two in the Bay area and
two in Southern California, who
will check up on what livelihood he
or she is following, what sort of
education he received, what, educa
tion his spouse got, and what intelli
gence scores their childern make.
Approximately 200 of the original
group are living outside the state.
Psychologists of other universities
will be asked to get in touch with
them.
SELECTED BY TESTS
Selected by a series of intelligence
tests, when they were still in the
"formative" or "normal years," the
children were picked from over
250,000 of their schoolmates in the
grade and high schools of San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles areas, Santa
Barbara, Fresno, and San Diego. Dr.
Terman has kept in touch with most
of them by means of blanks and
letters, but this will be the first mass
personal survey.
Besides making Terman's name
world-famous in psychological cir
cles, the original tots have done all
right for themselves too. Records
reveal that 90 per cent of the boys
and 85 per cent of the girls went to
college, from which 19 out of 20 of
the boys and 9 out of 10 of the girls
graduated.
Half of the boys have entered the
staid professions, law, medicine,
teaching, engineering, architecture,
or religion. About one-fourth are in
semi-professional occupations or
business. Several rugged individual
ists in the remaining fourth are fol
lowing more colorful pursuits. These
include jazz band players, Walt Dis
ney artists, ghost writers, radio an
