# $20,000 Fund Granted By Carnegie Corporation For Terman Research
## Stanford Psychologist to Contact 'Tested Tots' Selected in 1922 To Check on Present Livelihood 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Back in 1922 I)r. Ixjwis IW. Terman, famous Stanford psychologist, sin
gled out 1,400 of California's most sifted children for long-term psycho
logical study. Today I)r. Ray Lyman Wilbur announced that the Carnegie
Corporation of New York has granted $20,000 to Stanford for an intensive
follow-up to determine what those children have achieved in school, in
college, and in life. +

Now in their late twenties and
early thirties, the "Terman-Tested
Tots" will be contacted by four field
Assistants, two in the Bay area and
two in Southern California, who
will check up on what livelihood he
or she is following, what sort of
education he received, what, educa
tion his spouse got, and what intelli
gence scores their childern make.
Approximately 200 of the original
group are living outside the state.
Psychologists of other universities
will be asked to get in touch with
them.
SELECTED BY TESTS
Selected by a series of intelligence
tests, when they were still in the
"formative" or "normal years," the
children were picked from over
250,000 of their schoolmates in the
grade and high schools of San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles areas, Santa
Barbara, Fresno, and San Diego. Dr.
Terman has kept in touch with most
of them by means of blanks and
letters, but this will be the first mass
personal survey.
Besides making Terman's name
world-famous in psychological cir
cles, the original tots have done all
right for themselves too. Records
reveal that 90 per cent of the boys
and 85 per cent of the girls went to
college, from which 19 out of 20 of
the boys and 9 out of 10 of the girls
graduated.
Half of the boys have entered the
staid professions, law, medicine,
teaching, engineering, architecture,
or religion. About one-fourth are in
semi-professional occupations or
business. Several rugged individual
ists in the remaining fourth are fol
lowing more colorful pursuits. These
include jazz band players, Walt Dis
ney artists, ghost writers, radio an
nouncers, a stamp dealer, a police
man, and a fox farmer.
And, though they were hard hit
by the depression, all have managed
to stay off the relief rolls.
Apparently those girls who did gc
to college were a little more deter
mined than the boys, because 9C
per cent of them, as compared to 4C
per cent of the boys, earned more
than half of their total expenses
while they were undergraduates
However, the boys earned more than
$500,000 during their undergraduate
years.
"The problem of self-supporl
would have been even more se
rious," says Dr. Terman, "but foi
the material assistance offered b>
scholarships, fellowships, and as
sistantships. A fourth of the boyi
received one or more such awards
their stipends from this source total
ing around $200,000. That it shoulc
have been necessary for these 50C
gifted boys to earn an additional
half million in their undergraduate
years alone is the most convincing
proof I have seen of the deplorable
inadecjuacy of scholarship funds."
MATRICULATION
The average age for the gifted
children on matriculation was 17
years, which is considerably younger
than their classmates. The earlier
they entered the better work they
did. Both in high school and col
lege the group, as a whole, excel
led in all activities except athletics,
"The pace for gifted children is
set largely by dull minds," states
Doctor Terman. He believes whole
heartedly in the necessity of soci
ety's organizing its schools and col
leges so as to take advantage of the
learning ability of gifted students,
since the>y are constantly subjected
to the "inhibiting effect of slow or
.stupiel learners."
Most of the bright children of 1922
are turning out successfully, Dr.
Terman finds. A few not do as well
in college as they ciould; the success
of a few is interfered with by per
sonality factors. But even these
may, in time, show their superiority
in achievement, Dr. Terman be
lieves.
Women have been barred for cen
turies from Mount Athos, a shrine on
one of the Greek islands in the
Aegean sea.

or she is following, what sort of
education he received, what, educa

gence scores their childern make.
Approximately 200 of the original
group are living outside the state.
Psychologists of other universities
will be asked to get in touch with
them.
SELECTED BY TESTS
Selected by a series of intelligence
tests, when they were still in the
"formative" or "normal years," the
children were picked from over
250,000 of their schoolmates in the
grade and high schools of San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles areas, Santa
Barbara, Fresno, and San Diego. Dr.
Terman has kept in touch with most
of them by means of blanks and
letters, but this will be the first mass
personal survey.
Besides making Terman's name
world-famous in psychological cir
cles, the original tots have done all
right for themselves too. Records
reveal that 90 per cent of the boys
and 85 per cent of the girls went to
college, from which 19 out of 20 of
the boys and 9 out of 10 of the girls
graduated.
Half of the boys have entered the
staid professions, law, medicine,
teaching, engineering, architecture,
or religion. About one-fourth are in
semi-professional occupations or
business. Several rugged individual
ists in the remaining fourth are fol
lowing more colorful pursuits. These
include jazz band players, Walt Dis
ney artists, ghost writers, radio an
nouncers, a stamp dealer, a police
man, and a fox farmer.
And, though they were hard hit
by the depression, all have managed
to stay off the relief rolls.
Apparently those girls who did gc
to college were a little more deter
mined than the boys, because 9C
per cent of them, as compared to 4C
per cent of the boys, earned more
than half of their total expenses
while they were undergraduates
However, the boys earned more than
$500,000 during their undergraduate
years.
"The problem of self-supporl
would have been even more se
rious," says Dr. Terman, "but foi
the material assistance offered b>
scholarships, fellowships, and as
sistantships. A fourth of the boyi
received one or more such awards
their stipends from this source total
ing around $200,000. That it shoulc
have been necessary for these 50C
gifted boys to earn an additional
half million in their undergraduate
years alone is the most convincing
proof I have seen of the deplorable
inadecjuacy of scholarship funds."
MATRICULATION
The average age for the gifted
children on matriculation was 17
years, which is considerably younger
than their classmates. The earlier
they entered the better work they
did. Both in high school and col
lege the group, as a whole, excel
led in all activities except athletics,
"The pace for gifted children is
set largely by dull minds," states
Doctor Terman. He believes whole
heartedly in the necessity of soci
ety's organizing its schools and col
leges so as to take advantage of the
learning ability of gifted students,
since the>y are constantly subjected
to the "inhibiting effect of slow or
.stupiel learners."
Most of the bright children of 1922
are turning out successfully, Dr.
Terman finds. A few not do as well
in college as they ciould; the success
of a few is interfered with by per
sonality factors. But even these
may, in time, show their superiority
in achievement, Dr. Terman be
lieves.

turies from Mount Athos, a shrine on

Besides making Terman's name
world-famous in psychological cir
cles, the original tots have done all
right for themselves too. Records
reveal that 90 per cent of the boys
and 85 per cent of the girls went to
college, from which 19 out of 20 of
the boys and 9 out of 10 of the girls
graduated.
Half of the boys have entered the
staid professions, law, medicine,
teaching, engineering, architecture,
or religion. About one-fourth are in
semi-professional occupations or
business. Several rugged individual
ists in the remaining fourth are fol
lowing more colorful pursuits. These
include jazz band players, Walt Dis
ney artists, ghost writers, radio an
nouncers, a stamp dealer, a police
man, and a fox farmer.
And, though they were hard hit
by the depression, all have managed
to stay off the relief rolls.
Apparently those girls who did gc
to college were a little more deter
mined than the boys, because 9C
per cent of them, as compared to 4C
per cent of the boys, earned more
than half of their total expenses
while they were undergraduates
However, the boys earned more than
$500,000 during their undergraduate
years.
"The problem of self-supporl
would have been even more se
rious," says Dr. Terman, "but foi
the material assistance offered b>
scholarships, fellowships, and as
sistantships. A fourth of the boyi
received one or more such awards
their stipends from this source total
ing around $200,000. That it shoulc
have been necessary for these 50C
gifted boys to earn an additional
half million in their undergraduate
years alone is the most convincing
proof I have seen of the deplorable
inadecjuacy of scholarship funds."
MATRICULATION
The average age for the gifted
children on matriculation was 17
years, which is considerably younger
than their classmates. The earlier
they entered the better work they
did. Both in high school and col
lege the group, as a whole, excel
led in all activities except athletics,
"The pace for gifted children is
set largely by dull minds," states
Doctor Terman. He believes whole
heartedly in the necessity of soci
ety's organizing its schools and col
leges so as to take advantage of the
learning ability of gifted students,
since the>y are constantly subjected
to the "inhibiting effect of slow or
.stupiel learners."
Most of the bright children of 1922
are turning out successfully, Dr.
Terman finds. A few not do as well
in college as they ciould; the success
of a few is interfered with by per
sonality factors. But even these
may, in time, show their superiority
in achievement, Dr. Terman be
lieves.

turies from Mount Athos, a shrine on

Back in 1922 I)r. Ixjwis IW. Terman, famous Stanford psychologist, sin
gled out 1,400 of California's most sifted children for long-term psycho
logical study. Today I)r. Ray Lyman Wilbur announced that the Carnegie
Corporation of New York has granted $20,000 to Stanford for an intensive
follow-up to determine what those children have achieved in school, in
college, and in life. +

Now in their late twenties and
early thirties, the "Terman-Tested
Tots" will be contacted by four field
Assistants, two in the Bay area and
two in Southern California, who
will check up on what livelihood he
or she is following, what sort of
education he received, what, educa
tion his spouse got, and what intelli
gence scores their childern make.
Approximately 200 of the original
group are living outside the state.
Psychologists of other universities
will be asked to get in touch with
them.
SELECTED BY TESTS
Selected by a series of intelligence
tests, when they were still in the
"formative" or "normal years," the
children were picked from over
250,000 of their schoolmates in the
grade and high schools of San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles areas, Santa
Barbara, Fresno, and San Diego. Dr.
Terman has kept in touch with most
of them by means of blanks and
letters, but this will be the first mass
personal survey.
