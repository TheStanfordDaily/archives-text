# New Housing Plan Offered Hall Men
## Clubs to Use Toyon; Branner For Transfers 
### 
Proposed to solve dormitory hous
ing of junior transfers and eating
club members and provision of per
manent eating facilities for inde
pendent hall men, a plan has been
submitted by the office of the Dean
of Men to President Ray Lyman Wil
bur, according to John Bunn, Dean
of Men.
Under the proposal, Toyon Hall
rooms would be occupied solely by
eating club members; Branner Hall
would be ocupied by junior trans
fers; and Branner and Sequoia
would be ocupied by other inde
pendent hall men.
THREE PROBLEMS
"There are these three problems
with regard to the housing situation
at Stanford," Mr. Burm said last
night. "This proposal tends to bal
ance them all and to alleviate some
of the problems attendant upon the
present situation."
Commenting upon the proposal,
Dr. Wilbur indicated that no deci
sion had been reached as to his ap
proval or disapproval.
"The plan has a good many im
plications and I haven't had time
enough to study them as yet," he
said.
LONG-TERM PLAN
In explanation Dean Bunn said:
"As to specific instances, the plan
will mean that there will not be as
many old residents in Branner and
Seqouia, but, on the other hand, the
plan will go into effect gradually, if
adopted.
"Therefore, it will not affect pres
ent residents of those halls, who
will be permitted to maintain their
room rights until they graduate."
Regarding present club members
living in Branner, he said: "There
would be no objection to those club
members staying in Branner until
their graduation if they so desire, but
those members' spaces in Toyon
would be kept open for them."
PROPOSAL'S ORIGIN
The plan, he indicated, was an
outgrowth of Branner Hall agitation
for opening of that hall's dining
room, which would be done if presi
dential approval is secured.
The matter of the dining hall was
brought to the attention of the dean's
office early this quarter when over
100 Branner Hall residents, under
the leadership of Maurice Knox,
Branner sophomore, signed a peti
tion asking the reopening. All sign
ers indicated they would support the
dining hall if opened.
Eating in the dining room would
be compulsory for Branner residents
under the proposal, since such facili
ties could not be operated if the
University were not assured of stu
dent support, he declared.

bur, according to John Bunn, Dean
of Men.
Under the proposal, Toyon Hall
rooms would be occupied solely by
eating club members; Branner Hall
would be ocupied by junior trans
fers; and Branner and Sequoia
would be ocupied by other inde
pendent hall men.
THREE PROBLEMS
"There are these three problems
with regard to the housing situation
at Stanford," Mr. Burm said last
night. "This proposal tends to bal
ance them all and to alleviate some
of the problems attendant upon the
present situation."
Commenting upon the proposal,
Dr. Wilbur indicated that no deci
sion had been reached as to his ap
proval or disapproval.
"The plan has a good many im
plications and I haven't had time
enough to study them as yet," he
said.
LONG-TERM PLAN
In explanation Dean Bunn said:
"As to specific instances, the plan
will mean that there will not be as
many old residents in Branner and
Seqouia, but, on the other hand, the
plan will go into effect gradually, if
adopted.
"Therefore, it will not affect pres
ent residents of those halls, who
will be permitted to maintain their
room rights until they graduate."
Regarding present club members
living in Branner, he said: "There
would be no objection to those club
members staying in Branner until
their graduation if they so desire, but
those members' spaces in Toyon
would be kept open for them."
PROPOSAL'S ORIGIN
The plan, he indicated, was an
outgrowth of Branner Hall agitation
for opening of that hall's dining
room, which would be done if presi
dential approval is secured.
The matter of the dining hall was
brought to the attention of the dean's
office early this quarter when over
100 Branner Hall residents, under
the leadership of Maurice Knox,
Branner sophomore, signed a peti
tion asking the reopening. All sign
ers indicated they would support the
dining hall if opened.
Eating in the dining room would
be compulsory for Branner residents
under the proposal, since such facili
ties could not be operated if the
University were not assured of stu
dent support, he declared.
Proposed to solve dormitory hous
ing of junior transfers and eating
club members and provision of per
manent eating facilities for inde
pendent hall men, a plan has been
submitted by the office of the Dean
of Men to President Ray Lyman Wil
bur, according to John Bunn, Dean
of Men.
Under the proposal, Toyon Hall
rooms would be occupied solely by
eating club members; Branner Hall
would be ocupied by junior trans
fers; and Branner and Sequoia
would be ocupied by other inde
pendent hall men.
