# Excom Discusses Date Row Tonight
## 
### 
Arguments over spring quarter
date assignments are scheduled to
take much of Ex Committee's time
tonight when it meets at 7:15 o'clock
in Old Union.
Chief sore spot is the conflict be
tween the junior and senior classes
over dates for their respective proms.
After the juniors had been granted
April 14 for the Junior Prom, the
seniors found themselves unable to
sign a suitable orchestra for their
date in March. So they have ap
plied for April 28 â€”just two weeks
after the Junior Prom.
Other business includes considera
tion of Cardinals' appointment of
Clint Olson as Convalescent Home
Drive chairman.
