# Frogs Used As Lab Basis For Studying Evolution

The frog kicked; the girls screamed and fled.
"Incidents like this happen every year," said Dr. W. 11. Johnson, as
sistant professor of biology, speaking on the subject which annually faces
all Farm freshmen.
"In anaesthetizing over a hundred frogs, a few are bound to get a
little less ether than the others. Thus a few Stanford students are fright-

ened due to the fact thai they prob-.
ably have not confronted anything
biological before."
Tall and dark. Dr. Johnson has a
friendly .smile. Shy and retiring to
a degree, he possesses a fine sense
of humor. His straight-forward
manner makes him a favorite among
students.
LAB VALUE
Speaking of the value of Stanford
laboratory work in connection with
biology. Dr. Johnson termed the
work as producing a three-dimen
sional concept, enabling the student
to study more and retain what he
learns longer.
"Practically all the laboratory
work is given with something more
in mincl than the understanding of
the specific study," he continued.
"Studying the frog presents us with
a knowledge of the placement of or
gans and the functions of the various
systems, which in many cases may
be compared with our own."
TERMINOLOGY NEEDED
"It is imperative," he states, "that
we learn a minimum of terminol
ogy if we are to know what the
other person is talking about. Ac
tually the number of words that
have to be learned are so much less
than those required in a beginning
language course that this does not
present a truly great problem."
Last quarter campus biologists
studied the frog. This is studied first

so that the relationship between
vertebrates and invertebrates can be
seen. This quarter plants and in
vertebrate animals are being stud
ied.
TIME AT RESEARCH
Teaching at Stanford during the
past four years, Dr. Johnson is now
spending most of his time on re
search. His work in the Farm lab
oratories now takes him deep into a
study of a ciliate, a tiny animal
which he discovered upon the cam
pus.
He has published one paper upon
his observations to date, and hopes
to complete a second one before the
end of this quarter. During spring
quarter he will resume the lecture
platform.
Dr. Johnson's love for laboratory
work seemingly does not carry over
into his leisure hours. As a hobby
he "monkeys around in his flower
garden."
