# German Movie Slated Sunday
## 
### 
Another foreign film, this time the
German classic, "Heimat," will flash
gutturally on the auditorium screcn
Sunday night at 7:30 o'clock. This
three and one-half bell feature, clas
sical though it is, offers much to
those who enjoy fine interspersing
in a musical background, and a lead
ing lady who can sing and look
pretty at the same t'me.
The plot, at t'mes tense and a little
familiar, concerns the return of an
exiled daughter, portrayed by Swe
dish singer Zarah Leander, to the
affection of her hard-hearted soldier
father. Zarah is recognized as the
exiled child and is forced to return
to the tradition and honor of her
old home. Happily enough, the di
rector at no time allowed his charges
to become overly-emot'onal, with the
resnlt that "He'mat" promises to be
a worth - while Sunday entertain
ment.* '
