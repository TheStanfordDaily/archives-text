# All-Mural Hoop Team Selected
## Koch Rates Top Honors Second Time LaFranchi, Zamloch, Calkins, Topham Also Make Mythical Club 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Making All-Intrarriural for the!
second year in succession; Bob Koch, j
high-scoring A.T.O. casabaman, has j
been given the pivot post on this j
year's mythical cage team an- j
nounced by Intramural Manager j
Andy StojkoVich after due consul
tation with the referees and score-'
book.
A good center on any man's team, |
Koch has sparked his team into the j
favored spot of the elimination \
tournament and is leading all seor
ers with 87 points in his four games. |
At the forward spots are Dick La- j

Franchi of Kappa Alpha and Arch j
Zamloch from Phi Delta Phi.
LaFranchi, the "one-man team"
on his own ability boosted his quin
lel into the tournament of cham
pions with remarkable shooting |
ability and sharp defensive work, j
Little Arch Zamloch was also the '
bright star of a team which is still
in there winging for that trophy. I
Zamloch, despite his size, stood out !
• i I
m aggressive play.
The main defensive strength of |
1 his all-mural five comes in the form j
of tall Lyman Calkins, Phi Psi j
guard. Calkins was poison to op- J
ponents at recovery work under his |
own basket and at holding strong j
offensive men scoreless.
Skill at dribbling and passwork j
earns Jack Topham of Sigma Chi ;
the other guard position. Jack does
little scoring on his own hook but |
is highly successful in setting his
team-mates up for points.

The final game of the evening j

over-time battle. Though they
were leading at the end of the game,
the Breakers were forced to play !
