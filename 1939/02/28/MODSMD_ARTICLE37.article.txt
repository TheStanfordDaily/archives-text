The little snowball which we
started rolling a couple of weeks
ago in defense of bleachers for An
gell Field has already reached the
proportions of something really big.
* * *
THE WAY alumni, students, and
disinterested outsiders have caught
the idea is truly gratifying. Every
one— except the Board of Athletic
Control—has Bleacher Fever, and if
we keep spreading the affliction
around, the B.A.C. boys might catch
the bug before their next gathering.
Probably the best example of sin
cerity was the dee dof a Mr. H. M.
Lee, who sent Bill Leiser, sports
editor of the Chronicle, a dollar bill
to open a bleacher drive. Leiser
sent the greenback on to A1 Mas
ters, our graduate manager, in the
hope that it might possibly offer a
suggestion of action.
Leiser is a Stanford graduate and
one of the two really pro-Stanford
writers on the city papers. Mr. Lee
might be an alumnus or the father
of a student. Whatever he is, he has
started a move which I have every
confidence won't be stopped until
the board sees the need for quick
construction.
* * *
IF THE BOARD'S argument
against construction was based on
any premise other than a shortness
of funds, their point might, be well
worth thinking over. But they have
already invested $25,000 for the track
itself. Why they shouldn't protect
their original investment is beyond
our comprehension.
A member of the board from sev
eral years back told me yesterday
that he favored installation of seats
during the original construction.
This good gentleman was something
of a trackman himself as a youth.
His word now has no more author
ity than mine, but maybe the mem
bers will listen to alumni and pro
fessors who are as well known and
powerful as he is.
Another letter came in from a
member of the Class of 1920 who, un
fortunately, wants to remain anony
mous. He is perhaps closer to the
situation than any other man except
the board members themselves.
Listen to a couple of excerpts:
"The name and fame of the Stan
ford track team practically since the
institution started has far surpassed
the record of the Stanford football

team in the past 20 years, beyond !
the shadow of a doubt.
"If baseball at Stanford in the past
20 years has won about two series
from California and still has mag
nificent grounds and bleachers, why
has not track and field, always na
tionally and internationally famous,
similar facilities? It is disgraceful.
It's like building a house and leav- I
ing oft the roof and doors."
i|t »!« *
AND BILL Leiser says, "With one !
of the best track and field plants in j
the world at Angell Field, it's time i
for Stanford to arrange to conduct '
her track and field competition there I
rather than in the wind and on the I
inferior strip at the stadium, where j
there are always 70.000 empty j
seats."
The letter which the track squad
sent to Stanford's most influential
San Francisco alumnus stated, in
part of its three pages:
"The actual issue involves the
very nature of the B.A.C. The Stan
ford student visualizes collegiate
athletics as the development of in
tercollegiate competition and wel- j
fare of the competing athlete. Should j
not this be part of the object of the I
8.A.C.? Most certainly! But the I
B.A.C. looks upon athletics as a J
means to a financial end. They don't
want to put a $30,000 hole in their
budget (they only made $69,000 last
year). Can not this project be
thought of as a benefit to Stanford's
athletic program? Besides, it will
be a working investment."
* * *
THE BOYS aren't mincing their j
words in any degree. The boards j
attitude has been based either on I
bad judgment or ill-advised opin- '
ions. All of the student members'
are naturally unanimously behind '
the move; some of the others arc !
fast being convinced of the imme- 1
diate necessity for construction.
After all, big time alumni and im
portant faculty members are just as
liable for lapses in judgment as the
rest of us. The easiest, way in the
world for them to right the whole

mishandled problem will be for
them to pass the assessment at their
March meeting so that at least a
portion of the seats will be ready
for the biggest meet of the year
with U.S.C. on May 6.

words in any degree. The boards j
attitude has been based either on I
bad judgment or ill-advised opin- '
ions. All of the student members'
are naturally unanimously behind '
the move; some of the others arc !
fast being convinced of the imme- 1
diate necessity for construction.
After all, big time alumni and im
portant faculty members are just as
liable for lapses in judgment as the
rest of us. The easiest, way in the
world for them to right the whole

mishandled problem will be for
them to pass the assessment at their
March meeting so that at least a
portion of the seats will be ready
for the biggest meet of the year
with U.S.C. on May 6.
The little snowball which we
started rolling a couple of weeks
ago in defense of bleachers for An
gell Field has already reached the
proportions of something really big.
* * *
THE WAY alumni, students, and
disinterested outsiders have caught
the idea is truly gratifying. Every
one— except the Board of Athletic
Control—has Bleacher Fever, and if
we keep spreading the affliction
around, the B.A.C. boys might catch
the bug before their next gathering.
Probably the best example of sin
cerity was the dee dof a Mr. H. M.
Lee, who sent Bill Leiser, sports
editor of the Chronicle, a dollar bill
to open a bleacher drive. Leiser
sent the greenback on to A1 Mas
ters, our graduate manager, in the
hope that it might possibly offer a
suggestion of action.
Leiser is a Stanford graduate and
one of the two really pro-Stanford
writers on the city papers. Mr. Lee
might be an alumnus or the father
of a student. Whatever he is, he has
started a move which I have every
confidence won't be stopped until
the board sees the need for quick
construction.
* * *
IF THE BOARD'S argument
against construction was based on
any premise other than a shortness
of funds, their point might, be well
worth thinking over. But they have
already invested $25,000 for the track
itself. Why they shouldn't protect
their original investment is beyond
our comprehension.
A member of the board from sev
eral years back told me yesterday
that he favored installation of seats
during the original construction.
This good gentleman was something
of a trackman himself as a youth.
His word now has no more author
ity than mine, but maybe the mem
bers will listen to alumni and pro
fessors who are as well known and
powerful as he is.
Another letter came in from a
member of the Class of 1920 who, un
fortunately, wants to remain anony
mous. He is perhaps closer to the
situation than any other man except
the board members themselves.
Listen to a couple of excerpts:
"The name and fame of the Stan
ford track team practically since the
institution started has far surpassed
the record of the Stanford football

team in the past 20 years, beyond !
the shadow of a doubt.
"If baseball at Stanford in the past
20 years has won about two series
from California and still has mag
nificent grounds and bleachers, why
has not track and field, always na
tionally and internationally famous,
similar facilities? It is disgraceful.
It's like building a house and leav- I
ing oft the roof and doors."
i|t »!« *
AND BILL Leiser says, "With one !
of the best track and field plants in j
the world at Angell Field, it's time i
for Stanford to arrange to conduct '
her track and field competition there I
rather than in the wind and on the I
inferior strip at the stadium, where j
there are always 70.000 empty j
seats."
The letter which the track squad
sent to Stanford's most influential
San Francisco alumnus stated, in
part of its three pages:
"The actual issue involves the
very nature of the B.A.C. The Stan
ford student visualizes collegiate
athletics as the development of in
tercollegiate competition and wel- j
fare of the competing athlete. Should j
not this be part of the object of the I
8.A.C.? Most certainly! But the I
B.A.C. looks upon athletics as a J
means to a financial end. They don't
want to put a $30,000 hole in their
budget (they only made $69,000 last
year). Can not this project be
thought of as a benefit to Stanford's
athletic program? Besides, it will
be a working investment."

very nature of the B.A.C. The Stan
ford student visualizes collegiate
athletics as the development of in
tercollegiate competition and wel- j
fare of the competing athlete. Should j
not this be part of the object of the I
8.A.C.? Most certainly! But the I
B.A.C. looks upon athletics as a J
means to a financial end. They don't
want to put a $30,000 hole in their
budget (they only made $69,000 last
year). Can not this project be
thought of as a benefit to Stanford's
athletic program? Besides, it will
be a working investment."

THE BOYS aren't mincing their j
words in any degree. The boards j
attitude has been based either on I
bad judgment or ill-advised opin- '
ions. All of the student members'
are naturally unanimously behind '
the move; some of the others arc !
fast being convinced of the imme- 1
diate necessity for construction.
After all, big time alumni and im
portant faculty members are just as
liable for lapses in judgment as the
rest of us. The easiest, way in the
world for them to right the whole

mishandled problem will be for
them to pass the assessment at their
March meeting so that at least a
portion of the seats will be ready
for the biggest meet of the year
with U.S.C. on May 6.
The little snowball which we
started rolling a couple of weeks
ago in defense of bleachers for An
gell Field has already reached the
proportions of something really big.

THE WAY alumni, students, and
disinterested outsiders have caught
the idea is truly gratifying. Every
one— except the Board of Athletic
Control—has Bleacher Fever, and if
we keep spreading the affliction
around, the B.A.C. boys might catch
the bug before their next gathering.
Probably the best example of sin
cerity was the dee dof a Mr. H. M.
Lee, who sent Bill Leiser, sports
editor of the Chronicle, a dollar bill
to open a bleacher drive. Leiser
sent the greenback on to A1 Mas
ters, our graduate manager, in the
hope that it might possibly offer a
suggestion of action.
Leiser is a Stanford graduate and
one of the two really pro-Stanford
writers on the city papers. Mr. Lee
might be an alumnus or the father
of a student. Whatever he is, he has
started a move which I have every
confidence won't be stopped until
the board sees the need for quick
construction.

IF THE BOARD'S argument
against construction was based on
any premise other than a shortness
of funds, their point might, be well
worth thinking over. But they have
already invested $25,000 for the track
itself. Why they shouldn't protect
their original investment is beyond
our comprehension.
A member of the board from sev
eral years back told me yesterday
that he favored installation of seats
during the original construction.
This good gentleman was something
of a trackman himself as a youth.
His word now has no more author
ity than mine, but maybe the mem
bers will listen to alumni and pro
fessors who are as well known and
powerful as he is.
Another letter came in from a
member of the Class of 1920 who, un
fortunately, wants to remain anony
mous. He is perhaps closer to the
situation than any other man except
the board members themselves.
Listen to a couple of excerpts:
"The name and fame of the Stan
ford track team practically since the
institution started has far surpassed
the record of the Stanford football

team in the past 20 years, beyond !
the shadow of a doubt.
"If baseball at Stanford in the past
20 years has won about two series
from California and still has mag
nificent grounds and bleachers, why
has not track and field, always na
tionally and internationally famous,
similar facilities? It is disgraceful.
It's like building a house and leav- I
ing oft the roof and doors."

AND BILL Leiser says, "With one !
of the best track and field plants in j
the world at Angell Field, it's time i
for Stanford to arrange to conduct '
her track and field competition there I
rather than in the wind and on the I
inferior strip at the stadium, where j
there are always 70.000 empty j
seats."
The letter which the track squad
sent to Stanford's most influential
San Francisco alumnus stated, in
