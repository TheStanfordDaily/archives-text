# Boxers Ready For Cal Match
## Injuries Keep Gunn, Wilson Out of Bouts 
### 
Injuries sustained in last Friday
night's bouts will keep Herb Gunn
and John Wilson out of the Cal re- j
match this coming Thursday night,'
but they will be replaced by Bob
Hovey and Ed Stem, according to
Boxing Coach Clayton Frye.
Both Gunn and Wilson received I
eye cuts in their matches against Cal ,
boxers, and the injuries are not suf- i
ficiently healed to allow them to 1
compete in the rematch at Berkeley.
VICTORY EXPECTED
Chances of the Card team to re
peat over the Berkeley sluggers will
not be dimmed' to any great extent
by the loss of the injured men. j
Hovey, fighting in the 165 weiyhts, i
will replace Gunn. Hovey was last
year's No. 1 heavyweight and has
been out with injuries. He is back
in shape now and aiming for a Cal I
victory.
Stein, taking Wilson's place, is
rated one of the best prospects on
the team. He defeated his Cal Aggie i
opponent here several weeks ago.
LINE-UP UNDETERMINED
The line-up for the matches have 1
not yet been determined, as the Cal I
list has not been received. Whether !
or not Cal will furnish an opponent j
for John Ward, the "Stanford Ter
ror," is the big question of the day.
Cal forfeited this heavyweight i
match last Friday.
Prospects for a Stanford win are
very good, as shown by the decisive |
defeat of the Bear boxers in the j
Pavilion last Friday night. Stanford |
won all seven fights that went to a j
decision and gained a forfeit, losing !
two bouts due to injuries and for
feited a third.
