# Steinbeck Group Offers Labor Booklets
## Newly Organized Club Holds First Meeting Tomorrow 
### 
Free literature on the migratory
labor problem is now available on
the campus, according to the newly
organized Steinbeck Committee,
which schedules its first general
meeting for tomorrow afternoon at
4 o'clock.
Reading tables have been set up in
the Nitery and in the Y.W.C.A. room
of the Women's Clubhouse, it was
announced. A collection of books and
pamphlets will be available at these
two points, some on a loan basis,
others for free distribution.
Most important of the reports
available is "Farm Tenancy," a re
port of President Roosevelt's com
mittee on the problem. Two of the
pamphlets prepared by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics deal with labor
migration to California.
PAMPHLETS LISTED
Other pamphlets include studies of
children in migratory camps, health
problems among migratory workers,
and power farming and labor dis
placement in the cotton belt.
Most of the literature was fur
nished by the Farm Security Ad
ministartion office in San Francisco,
where Fred Saoul, public relations
officer for the Western Division, ex
plained the Administration's pro
gram.
Attempting to stagger crops, the
FSA hopes to lessen the difference
between peak and low demands for
agricultural labor, Mr. Saoul said.
WORKERS ATTACK PROBLEM
The problem also is being attacked
by organization of the workers and
by extension of co-operative farm
ing, he told members of the com
mittee.
On the steering committee of the
Steinbeck Committee are Otis Bru
baker, Gene Glasmann, Mary Beaton,
and Andries Deinum.
