# Small Compensation

AS a gentle reminder of better things to
come, Excom tonight will have to wade
into the nice tangle of beautiful tape surround
ing the Senior Prom-Junior Prom deal.
At this particular moment, about the only
course open to Farm legislators is to apologize
sweetly to the senior executives, swear silently
to themselves that a similar mix-up won't occur
again next year, or even next quarter.
The status as regards the Senior Prom is a
peculiar one: the juniors already have been
promised their big name dance; the seniors
want their two weeks following. To grant the
latter date would be to run too close to Stan
ford's marginal utility for big name dances.
And thereby possibly repeat this quarter's
mis-deal and sink the A.S.S.U. for another $500.
The chips are too expensive.
As a consequence, it looks as though seniors
will have to be content with the Senior Ball,
an apology from Excom, and, if that body so
moves, a revision of Ex Committee's non
chalance in regard to date-granting.
