FOR many years the Stanford-California ri
valry gave rise to an intense hatred which
reached its peak during football season, but
continued to burn throughout 365 days per
annum. Cal's possession of the axe added fuel
to the fire and made it unsafe for a Berkeley
man to appear on the Farm undisguised in
broad daylight.
In 1931 a bunch of Sequoia men made fools
of the Bears when they stole the axe at a Cal
rally. It was then that Stanford proved that it
still produces gentlemen and sportsmen. In
stead of secreting the axe in a vault, it offered
it as a perpetual trophy to the winner of the
Big Game. Realizing that maybe the Indians
were white men after all, the Daily Californian
stopped running lines of "Hate Stanford" in big
black type between its news stories, and the
rivalry became less bitter.
Big Game week, the Big Meet, Cal basketball
games — these are occasions that justify a
healthy belligerent spirit, but in between times
Indians and Bears can be put in the same cage
without their tearing each other to pieces.
As evidence that Stanford has been doing its
part to maintain friendly relations, we present
two Junior Jamborees and last year's Freshman
Picnic, at all of which Californians were in
vited guests. This week the Farm is going to
keep up the good neighbor policy and enter
tain the Berkeleyites once again.
We have invited them to join with us in
celebrating the opening of the Boathouse,
which practically amounts to a reception into
the bosom of the Stanford family.
When the Cal students arrive on the cam
pus next Saturday, they will not be carrying
buckets of blue and gold paint or concealed
stench - bombs. Friendly enemies —it sounds
like a quote from a Y.M.C.A. leader, but it's
really a pretty good idea.—L. L.
