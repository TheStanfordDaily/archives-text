IF enthusiasm can be taken as a sign of suc
cess, the Stanford Steinbeck Committee
should do much toward making Stanford con
scious of California's crucial migratory labor
problem.
First evidence of the committee's existence
is the collection of pictures in the Nitery, show
ing conditions of life among the transient
workers. Furnished by the Farm Security Ad
ministration office in San Francisco, the pic

tures were hung last week across two walls
of the Nitery.
When the committee meets tomorrow after
noon it will begin drawing up itq program of
publicizing the program and marshaling aid
for migrants now spending an off season in this
part of the state.
It will take more than enthusiasm, however,
for the Steinbeckers to make a success of their
campaign at Stanford—the Stanford of com
placency toward any problem more remote
than a squabble over dance dates.
But optimists can point to the way Stanford
gave generously of its old clothes to the drive
held last month by the American Student Union
to aid the migrants.
With that kind of a basis to begin on, the
committee should be successful in its program.
