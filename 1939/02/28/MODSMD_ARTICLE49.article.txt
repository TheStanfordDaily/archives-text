### JOHN COBBS 
UNCOMFORTABLE AS lIELL
AS PLANS for this year's International Peace Day
condense into definite programs, various indict
ments of war work their way to the surface of news
paper comment throughout the country. Psychology
and philosophy are usually called as witnesses for the
prosecution; sentimentality and emotion are also sub
poenaed. But so far the commentators have ignored
what I think is one of the main objections to war —
pure inconvenionce.
The idea of shooting at a man I've never even
been introduced to doesn't appeal to me, of course. I
am not at all attracted by the prospect of having a
total stranger poke a bayonet into my stomach. And
being an orderly soul, I like even less the thought
of social and economic chaos. But all of these possi
bilities seem remote, and they are offset by patriotic
glory and romance. The drawback that seems most
real is the discomfort and annoyance of soldiering.
$ * * *
I can view with composure the idea of sudden death
for my country's honor. After all, I take the same
chance with slightly different odds every time I drive
the Bayshore. But somehow I can't see myself sleep
ing in a muddy ti'ench. For three years now I have
complained bitterly about the mattresses at the house;
I shudder at the thought of how I would get along
with a knapsack as a pillow.
As far as I can tell, soldiers are supposed to con
centrate on eliminating the enemy; they are not sup
posed to bother about minor matters on their own
side of no-man's-land. But I can't imagine a Stan
ford student fitting into soldier life.
* * >|! *
i \NE of the chronic complaints on the campus is the
amount of sleep we get. Anything less than
seven hours is considered killing. But soldiers, I un
derstand, get about three hours a night, and then have
to roll out in the middle of it to receive unexpected
callers from across the way.
Another thing I don't like is the idea of eating
army food. Encina Commons gave me a case of in
digestion that is only now subsiding. I have a notion
that a field kitchen would be more deadly than any
enemy bayonet. Besides that, for some years I have
resolutely refused to take any interest in life until
after my morning coffee. If an officer rolled me out
at 4 in the morning and told me to fight before break
fast, I would probably laugh in his face.
* # * *
These are only a few of the objections Stanford
students would have. Consider the case of the man who
has dodged eight o'clocks for four years, only to be
kicked out by a nasty sergeant before dawn each
morning. And think of what would happen if we
got a cold and told the captain we were going to cut
our battles and go to the rest home.
Romance and patriotic glory might reconcile me to
sudden death, but they wouldn't do me much good in
a drafty dugout. And then too, there is practically no
romance left in modern warfare. In the old days a
man had a decent uniform and was allowed time to
wash up between battles. Today they give you some
thing that looks like a burlap sack, and you don't get
a chance to take it off more than once in six months.
Romance cannot live without lots of soap and warm
water and a good tailor.
Without romance, war is nothing but a damn nuis
ance. We don't want any.

digestion that is only now subsiding. I have a notion
that a field kitchen would be more deadly than any
enemy bayonet. Besides that, for some years I have
resolutely refused to take any interest in life until
after my morning coffee. If an officer rolled me out
at 4 in the morning and told me to fight before break
fast, I would probably laugh in his face.

These are only a few of the objections Stanford
students would have. Consider the case of the man who
has dodged eight o'clocks for four years, only to be
kicked out by a nasty sergeant before dawn each
morning. And think of what would happen if we
got a cold and told the captain we were going to cut
our battles and go to the rest home.
Romance and patriotic glory might reconcile me to
sudden death, but they wouldn't do me much good in
a drafty dugout. And then too, there is practically no
romance left in modern warfare. In the old days a
man had a decent uniform and was allowed time to
wash up between battles. Today they give you some
thing that looks like a burlap sack, and you don't get
a chance to take it off more than once in six months.
Romance cannot live without lots of soap and warm
water and a good tailor.
Without romance, war is nothing but a damn nuis
ance. We don't want any.
UNCOMFORTABLE AS lIELL
AS PLANS for this year's International Peace Day
condense into definite programs, various indict
ments of war work their way to the surface of news
paper comment throughout the country. Psychology
and philosophy are usually called as witnesses for the
prosecution; sentimentality and emotion are also sub
poenaed. But so far the commentators have ignored
what I think is one of the main objections to war —
pure inconvenionce.
The idea of shooting at a man I've never even
been introduced to doesn't appeal to me, of course. I
am not at all attracted by the prospect of having a
total stranger poke a bayonet into my stomach. And
being an orderly soul, I like even less the thought
of social and economic chaos. But all of these possi
bilities seem remote, and they are offset by patriotic
glory and romance. The drawback that seems most
real is the discomfort and annoyance of soldiering.

I can view with composure the idea of sudden death
for my country's honor. After all, I take the same
chance with slightly different odds every time I drive
the Bayshore. But somehow I can't see myself sleep
ing in a muddy ti'ench. For three years now I have
complained bitterly about the mattresses at the house;
I shudder at the thought of how I would get along
with a knapsack as a pillow.
As far as I can tell, soldiers are supposed to con
centrate on eliminating the enemy; they are not sup
posed to bother about minor matters on their own
side of no-man's-land. But I can't imagine a Stan
ford student fitting into soldier life.

i \NE of the chronic complaints on the campus is the
amount of sleep we get. Anything less than
seven hours is considered killing. But soldiers, I un
derstand, get about three hours a night, and then have
to roll out in the middle of it to receive unexpected
callers from across the way.
Another thing I don't like is the idea of eating
army food. Encina Commons gave me a case of in
digestion that is only now subsiding. I have a notion
that a field kitchen would be more deadly than any
enemy bayonet. Besides that, for some years I have
resolutely refused to take any interest in life until
