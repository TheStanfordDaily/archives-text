This bit of farce happened in Toyon the other
morning. The scene is this:
One of the boys is studying in one of the double
rooms n Toyon. His room-mate is asleep in the next
room. A janitor, armed with mops, buckets, etc., comes
in.
One of the Boys (to janitor): Clean up in here, but
don't go in the other room. My room-mate's
asleep.
Janitor: Rrrrrr.
(One of the Boys goes on .studying and the janitor
starts cleaning up. After two or three minutes of
this, One of the Boys gets up and goes out of the
room. At about this time the room-mate comes
out of the bedroom).
Janitor: Rrrrrr.
(The room-mate nods, .shuffles out of the room wear
ing his bedroom slippers and bathrobe. The jani
tor goes on cleaning the first room, finishes, then
goes into the second room. He makes only one of
the beds. He remembers that someone is asleep
in there still.)

Last week a Farm boy asked a friend of his, "Did
I seem very tight last night?"
"No, not very," the friend said.
"I sure must have been," the guy said. "Riding
home in ihe rumble-seat, I took off both shoes and
socks and threw them away."

Last week-end a near-sighted Farmer went to the
Fair and saw many things. But according to his own
testimony he has never seen anything like Stella.
As I say, he is very near-sighted.
Stella, of course, is a picture of a nude woman.
It has been in every major fair since 1915. and in a
few cut-rate peep shows. It is quite a tricky picture:
there is a string attached to the back of it which,
when gently pulle'd. makes it seem as if Stella is
breathing.
Many people don't go to see Stella at all because,
"There's a string attached," they say.
But the near-sighted Farmer went, and came home
raving. "Actually a nude woman," he said. "Go sew
Stella.* I never saw such a woman. Absolutely no
clothes. What a Woman."

I seem very tight last night?"
"No, not very," the friend said.
"I sure must have been," the guy said. "Riding
home in ihe rumble-seat, I took off both shoes and
socks and threw them away."

Last week-end a near-sighted Farmer went to the
Fair and saw many things. But according to his own
testimony he has never seen anything like Stella.
As I say, he is very near-sighted.
Stella, of course, is a picture of a nude woman.
It has been in every major fair since 1915. and in a
few cut-rate peep shows. It is quite a tricky picture:
there is a string attached to the back of it which,
when gently pulle'd. makes it seem as if Stella is
breathing.
Many people don't go to see Stella at all because,
"There's a string attached," they say.
But the near-sighted Farmer went, and came home
raving. "Actually a nude woman," he said. "Go sew
Stella.* I never saw such a woman. Absolutely no
clothes. What a Woman."
This bit of farce happened in Toyon the other
morning. The scene is this:
One of the boys is studying in one of the double
rooms n Toyon. His room-mate is asleep in the next
room. A janitor, armed with mops, buckets, etc., comes
in.
One of the Boys (to janitor): Clean up in here, but
don't go in the other room. My room-mate's
asleep.
Janitor: Rrrrrr.
(One of the Boys goes on .studying and the janitor
starts cleaning up. After two or three minutes of
this, One of the Boys gets up and goes out of the
room. At about this time the room-mate comes
out of the bedroom).
Janitor: Rrrrrr.
(The room-mate nods, .shuffles out of the room wear
ing his bedroom slippers and bathrobe. The jani
tor goes on cleaning the first room, finishes, then
goes into the second room. He makes only one of
the beds. He remembers that someone is asleep
in there still.)

Last week a Farm boy asked a friend of his, "Did
I seem very tight last night?"
"No, not very," the friend said.
"I sure must have been," the guy said. "Riding
home in ihe rumble-seat, I took off both shoes and
socks and threw them away."
