## LOST AND FOUND 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What on earth do people do with
the lost articles they find? I know
the complaint about our lost and
found bureaus is an old one, but,
believe me, I am convinced it is a
just one. You see, last Monday I left
two books on a chair in my 10
o'clock, Labor Organization. Both
had my name in them. At noon they
were gone. I have covered every
one of the million places they might
have been turned inâ€”not there.
In my desperation, I have two
pleas to make. First of all, will
whoever found my "Plotinus" and
"Labor Problems" books please get
in touch with me. You see, I have
an ex Thursday and I need the un
derlying badly. You will find the
directions for returning them in the
classified section. Secondly, can we
please have one central lost and
found bureau to make it easier for
both those who find and those who
lose? Jean Rassenfoss
