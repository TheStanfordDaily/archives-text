THESE WHITE BOXES being taken aboard Japanese ship at Shanghai contain the ashes of Nipponese sol
diers killed in the China war. Every ship leaving China for Japan carries these boxes, as thousands of
Japanese have died in the conflict. The characters on the bridge of the ship in photo above means "Heroes'
Souls."
