# Cage Tickets On Sale Again
## Cal Tilt to Be Part Of Boathouse Day 
### 
Even though the Stanford cage
varsity stands an excellent chance of
upsetting the pace-setting California
Golden Bears, Farm students didn't
show much interest in yesterday's
first day sale of ducats to the two
game series this week-end.
Because of the poor sale, paste
boards will be offered the general
public today—a day ahead of time—
at. 75 cents per crack. At the same
time students will have this last op
portunity to secure choice tickets for
the Berkeley and local pavilion en
counters Friday and Saturday nights.
The sale closes at 5 o'clock.
The Saturday night game here is
scheduled to be an important cog in
the Boathouse Day celebration on
the Farm, and the tilt will climax
a season-long basketball rivalry.
In spite of two defeats at the hands
of the Bear cage giants, Coach Ev
erett Dean's outfit will have the un
der dog advantage and at the same
time the "feel" of its home floor Sat
urday night when the invaders may
be feeling a bit too mighty.
A Stanford upset victory over the
Berkeley rivals either night would
throw the Southern Division basket
ball race into a two-way deadlock
with the Southern California Tro
jans, who are expected to have little
trouble vanquishing the hapless
Bruins.
Student tickets will sell for 40
cents and no purchases will be per
mitted without student body cards
at this rate. No one may present
more than two cards. It will be re
quired that the holder of a rooter's
ticket present his own card at all
games. No student rates will be of
fered following today's sale, Don
Liebendorfcr, B.A.C. publicity direc
tor, announced.
