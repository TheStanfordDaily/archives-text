### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
WNE of the most interesting signs
in the American scene is the
persistent growth of pacifism since
the Great War. Not that love of
peace is an emotion indigenous to
this country, or that European na
tions have not produced their quota
of conscientious objectors, but the
peace movement seems to be the
coming thing here and more or less
just a memory over there.
For many years after the Treaty
of Versailles there was a small,
logic-tight compartment reserved in
the mind of every active pacifist,
housing plans for a national refer
endum before the United States can
go to war again. However, in the
crazy days of the rising market and
bathtub gin, lil tie thought was given
to keeping this country at peace,
and the early '30's kept the nation
busy wrestling with the problems of
the Depression.

I AST year those carrying the
J torch for peace found more
than adequate excuse to turn their
minds from national emergencies
to international ones, and exhibit
A of the new trend was the intro
duction of a war referendum
amendment to Congress.
Representative Louis Ludow
brought to the House a proposed
amendment to the federal Constitu
tion which would prevent the
United States from declaring war
with a foreign nation without the
expressed approval of the electorate.
Realizing how completely such a
law would tie the hands of the State
Department, the administration cam
paigned against the proposal, and
finally succeeded in having it de
feated.

4"kUITE apropos of current gossip
about an international incident
on March G (next Monday), which
may lead to war, is the reappear
ance of pacifist's referendum scheme
in the national legislature. This
time the measure is under the spon
sorship of Progressive Senator La-
Follette and 11 other members of the
upper house, representing four po
litical parties.
In these days, when statements
about peace are made with a ris
ing inflection, a proposal which
threatens the stability of the
United States' foreign policy en
ters the ring with a handicap.
Despite isolationist and conserva
tive attacks on Roosevelt's attitude
toward the international situation,
public opinion thus far seems (o
favor the New Deal's stand.

Democracy is an admirable insti
tution, but anyone who has read a
good history of U. S. diplomatic af
fairs will realize how unwieldy and
impractical would be an obligation
to submit a declaration of war to
national vote. The marvels of radio
and telegraph have proved unequal
to the task of exacting a prompt ex
pression of opinion from the Amer
ican people, and it is doubtful if
even television could turn the trick.
International relations are the
most touchy things yet devised by
the mind of man. They have pro
duced Macihavellis, Richelicus, and
Mettemichs; they deal in the most
delicate intrigues in which a single
mis-step can lead ot, war. The hands
of democracy are just a bit too
clumsy to juggle with diplomatic
problems without dropping an In
dian club.

1 "4IAMBERLAIN, it seems has
' the House of Commons well
trained. Yesterday the Labor mi
nority performed its protest act on
schedule, giving an extremely apt
performance, and the House
promptly defeated a vote of cen
sure on the government's recogni
tion of Nationalist Spain.
Although the British prime min
ister could exact no promise from
Franco that Italian troops will im
mediately quit Spanish territory, the
onservaitve leader reassured the
Commons with the ex-Insurgents'
declaration that they will maintain
their sovereignty against foreign
intervention. To this argument he
added the old tear-jerker about
recognition putting an end to
bloodshed, which is always good for
a few votes.
Despite this gallant attitude on
Britain's part, it is very doubtful
that she will gain a great deal by
bowing formally to Fascism in
Spain.
