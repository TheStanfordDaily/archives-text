# Steinbeck Group Faces Difficult Job
## It Tackled Major Economic Problem, Professor Explains 
### 
When four students organized the
Stanford Steinbeck Committee last
week, they tackled one of the coun
try's major economic problems, ac
cording to William S. Hopkins, as
sistant professor of economics spe
cializing in labor problems.
Activities like gathering clothing
for persons living in the workers'
camps are aimed only at the immc-

diate problem — that of caring for
present victims of a disjointed agri
cultural economy—he pointed out.
"Feeding and clothing these people
is indeed a problem," he said, "but
it must be understood that this sit
uation is more than just a depres
sion phenomenon.
"It is the growth of a new class in
the United States —a landless, prop
ertyless proletariat, moving about
seeking temporary employment."
Although California influx of
migrant agricultural workers has
been traced mostly to dust storms in
the Middle West, mechanization of
farming is another factor in the dis
possessing farmers of their lands
and jobs, Mr. Hopkins explained.
Most spectacular of the new farm
machines is the Rust Brothers' cot
ton picker, already being introduced
in the Southwest.
Coming of a degree of national
prosperity, far from alleviating the
situation, will tend to make it more
acute, Mr. Hopkins pointed out.
"Rising prices will have two ef
fects," he said. "(1) More farm own
! ers will be able to afford farm ma
j chines and will need fewer employ
; ees, and (2) mortgages will be fore
' closed on many small farms on
; which it is not worth while to fore
i close at present.
"The results of this agricultural
industrial revolution are rapidly be
coming the nation's major economic
problem, although the situation has-
J n't yet attained that much import
j ance in public consciousness."
I Public attitude toward migrant
! agricultural workers has been
changing during the past few years,
Mr. Hopkins said.
"At first they were Mexicans and
then Filipinos, and it didn't seem so
j important if they starved. But now
j the bulk of these workers is from
j southern and middlewestern United
! States. In a few more years many of
! them will be native Californians
j that have been dispossessed from
j farms here within the state."
