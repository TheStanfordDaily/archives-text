# Reinhardt to Talk On German Art
## 
### 
"German Art of Today" will be
discussed this afternoon by Dr. Kurt
F. Reinhardt, associate professor of
German, who will speak in the audi
torium of the Education Building at
4:15 o'clock. Slides will be used to
illustrate the lecture.
"Art is for the people, not for spe
cial groups, classes, or cliques," be
lieves the speaker, who explains tliat
"art should be left free to express
personal experiences, moocls, tastes,
and convictions."
Discussing the relationship be
tween art and society and art and
the state, Dr. Reinhardt will tell of
possible attitudes and mutual rela
tions, and National-Socialist art as
expressing National-Socialist ideol
ogy. The lecturer feels that the state
"is indirectly concerned with art in
so far as it is related to the common
good and public welfare."
