# $107 Granted To 'Doll Up' Boathouse
## Flag, Deck Chairs, Beach Umbrellas Will Be Purchased 
### 
Brightening up the Boathouse in
preparation for the grand opening
Saturday, Ex Committee last night
okayed Pat Skinner's list of necessary
furnishing â€” including big beach
umbrellas, deck chairs, and a flag
for the flagpole.
Total allocation was $107, and Miss
Skinner was authorized to make
necessary purchases immediately.
A brief flurry of opposition to the
expenditure was led by John Par
tridge.
"Why get all these chairs and um
brellas?" he asked. "Plenty of people
have been lying out in the sun the
way the Boathouse is now. I can't
see the point of having the sun deck
all cluttered with furniture."
Women members of the com
mittee reacted as follows:
Roberta Tuthill: "You can't have
a barren Boathouse."
Annabelle Clark: ''After going
this far . .
Tuthill: "One hundred dollars is
a mere pittance."
Presenting suggestions made by
Alfred R. Masters, general manager
of the Board of Athletic Control, Bill
Turner brought forth Ex Committee
action on the following points:
1. Wages for Boathouse student
employees were set at 50 cents an
hour, 60 cents for head life-guard.
2. Canoe storage will cost $5 a
month, it was decided. Use of a
locker, optional last year, is included
in this charge.
3. Landscaping, the committee rec
ommended, will be handled by the
University, in accordance with a
previous suggestion by the Univer
sity it would donate plants and labor.
4. New anchors are needed for the
floats, since the old ones are reported
carried oft". Scrap iron at one cent a
pound and old cow chain at five cents
a foot will be used.
