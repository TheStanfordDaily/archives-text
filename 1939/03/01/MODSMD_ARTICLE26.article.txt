# Excom Proposes Joint Junior-Senior Prom As Conflict Compromise
## Big Name Orchestra Suggested For Women's Gym, Minor Band Would Play in Darkened Studio 
### 
A combined Junior-Senior Prom lo he held April 14—this was the so
lution Ex Committee suggested last night to Ihc two classes' conflict over
dates for their proms.
This expression of opinion was offered for joint consideration by
executive committees of the two classes. In case the combined dance is

not approved, April 28 was held
open for another week, although
the sophomore class has applied fox
that date for the Sophomore Car
nival.
DATE SHIFTED
Complications set in after the jun
iors had shifted their date to April
14 to keep from conflicting with
Scabbard and Blade's Military Ball.
The seniors, unable to sign a big
name band for March 10, then ap
plied for April 28, only two weeks
after the proposed Junior Prom.
If the solution is accepted, two or
chestras probably will be signed—a
big name orchestra for the Women's
Gym and a smaller one for the
Dance Studio.
Someone objected, contending all
dancers would congregate in the
main gym.
FUN IN THE DARK
Replied Tom Kiliefer, "If you re
member, we had Harry Barris for
the Pledge Prom. Nobody liked him
at all—they all stayed in the other
room where it was darker. We
could even it up tliat way, with the
lights."
Representing the juniors, Ken
Cuthbertson pointed out that the
class relics upon the prom as a
major fund-raiser. Both classes'
finances are in good shape, however,
according to Killefer.
Other Ex Committee business in
cluded the following:
VINCENT SHEEHAN: After
President H. B. Lee had reported
Mr. Sheehan, author of the best
seller, "Personal History," is avail
able for a lccture April 13 or 19,
committee members authorized
sponsoring of the lecture on April
13.
Optimism was based on financial
success of John Gunther's lecture
Feb. 15. Profit was $75.06, although
a loss of up to $100 had been antici
pated.
Objections included proximity of
the proposed lecture to Peace Day,
and consequent drop in attendance
at the lecture.
Discounting this objection, Gret
chen Ahlswede said. "I don't think
you can get too much of this stuff."
Killefer objected on grounds that
one financial success is not a guar
antee of another, particularly in the
light of a conflicting function. "I'm
warning you, we'll lose money," he
said.
Mr. Sheehan's lecture subjects
are "America's Stand on Neutrality,"
"Personal Opinion," and "Europe
after Munich."
BOILED SHIRTS: Concert Series
ushers were to be granted 65 cents
per concert to cover cost of wearing
tuxedos, according to action the
committee took Jan. 17.
Objecting to this action, Delphine
Joy appeared before the committee,
persuading them to withdraw this
payment for laundry and cleaning
bills. This expense would come to
$7.50 per concert, she said, contend
ing this amount is out of proportion
with other items in the Concert
Series budget.
Most of the Series' allotment goes

j in payment to artists, she said, and
total office expense for the year so
j far has been only $10.50. The Or
ganization owes over $700 to the
| A.S.S.U. and hopes to economize
j and pay off the debt.

success of John Gunther's lecture
Feb. 15. Profit was $75.06, although
a loss of up to $100 had been antici
pated.
Objections included proximity of
the proposed lecture to Peace Day,
and consequent drop in attendance
at the lecture.
Discounting this objection, Gret
chen Ahlswede said. "I don't think
you can get too much of this stuff."
Killefer objected on grounds that
one financial success is not a guar
antee of another, particularly in the
light of a conflicting function. "I'm
warning you, we'll lose money," he
said.
Mr. Sheehan's lecture subjects
are "America's Stand on Neutrality,"
"Personal Opinion," and "Europe
after Munich."
BOILED SHIRTS: Concert Series
ushers were to be granted 65 cents
per concert to cover cost of wearing
tuxedos, according to action the
committee took Jan. 17.
Objecting to this action, Delphine
Joy appeared before the committee,
persuading them to withdraw this
payment for laundry and cleaning
bills. This expense would come to
$7.50 per concert, she said, contend
ing this amount is out of proportion
with other items in the Concert
Series budget.
Most of the Series' allotment goes

j in payment to artists, she said, and
total office expense for the year so
j far has been only $10.50. The Or
ganization owes over $700 to the
| A.S.S.U. and hopes to economize
j and pay off the debt.

A combined Junior-Senior Prom lo he held April 14—this was the so
lution Ex Committee suggested last night to Ihc two classes' conflict over
dates for their proms.
This expression of opinion was offered for joint consideration by
executive committees of the two classes. In case the combined dance is

not approved, April 28 was held
open for another week, although
the sophomore class has applied fox
that date for the Sophomore Car
nival.
DATE SHIFTED
Complications set in after the jun
iors had shifted their date to April
14 to keep from conflicting with
Scabbard and Blade's Military Ball.
The seniors, unable to sign a big
name band for March 10, then ap
plied for April 28, only two weeks
after the proposed Junior Prom.
If the solution is accepted, two or
chestras probably will be signed—a
big name orchestra for the Women's
Gym and a smaller one for the
Dance Studio.
Someone objected, contending all
dancers would congregate in the
main gym.
FUN IN THE DARK
Replied Tom Kiliefer, "If you re
member, we had Harry Barris for
the Pledge Prom. Nobody liked him
at all—they all stayed in the other
room where it was darker. We
could even it up tliat way, with the
lights."
Representing the juniors, Ken
Cuthbertson pointed out that the
class relics upon the prom as a
major fund-raiser. Both classes'
finances are in good shape, however,
according to Killefer.

A combined Junior-Senior Prom lo he held April 14—this was the so
lution Ex Committee suggested last night to Ihc two classes' conflict over
dates for their proms.
This expression of opinion was offered for joint consideration by
executive committees of the two classes. In case the combined dance is

not approved, April 28 was held
open for another week, although
the sophomore class has applied fox
that date for the Sophomore Car
nival.
DATE SHIFTED
Complications set in after the jun
iors had shifted their date to April
14 to keep from conflicting with
Scabbard and Blade's Military Ball.
The seniors, unable to sign a big
name band for March 10, then ap
plied for April 28, only two weeks
after the proposed Junior Prom.
If the solution is accepted, two or
chestras probably will be signed—a
big name orchestra for the Women's
Gym and a smaller one for the
Dance Studio.
Someone objected, contending all
dancers would congregate in the
main gym.
FUN IN THE DARK
Replied Tom Kiliefer, "If you re
member, we had Harry Barris for
the Pledge Prom. Nobody liked him
at all—they all stayed in the other
room where it was darker. We
could even it up tliat way, with the
lights."
Representing the juniors, Ken
Cuthbertson pointed out that the
class relics upon the prom as a
major fund-raiser. Both classes'
finances are in good shape, however,
according to Killefer.
Other Ex Committee business in
cluded the following:
VINCENT SHEEHAN: After
President H. B. Lee had reported
Mr. Sheehan, author of the best
seller, "Personal History," is avail
able for a lccture April 13 or 19,
committee members authorized
sponsoring of the lecture on April
13.
Optimism was based on financial
success of John Gunther's lecture
Feb. 15. Profit was $75.06, although
a loss of up to $100 had been antici
pated.
Objections included proximity of
the proposed lecture to Peace Day,
and consequent drop in attendance
at the lecture.
Discounting this objection, Gret
chen Ahlswede said. "I don't think
you can get too much of this stuff."
Killefer objected on grounds that
one financial success is not a guar
antee of another, particularly in the
light of a conflicting function. "I'm
warning you, we'll lose money," he
said.
Mr. Sheehan's lecture subjects
are "America's Stand on Neutrality,"
"Personal Opinion," and "Europe
after Munich."
BOILED SHIRTS: Concert Series
ushers were to be granted 65 cents
per concert to cover cost of wearing
tuxedos, according to action the
committee took Jan. 17.
Objecting to this action, Delphine
Joy appeared before the committee,
persuading them to withdraw this
payment for laundry and cleaning
bills. This expense would come to
$7.50 per concert, she said, contend
ing this amount is out of proportion
with other items in the Concert
Series budget.
Most of the Series' allotment goes

j in payment to artists, she said, and
total office expense for the year so
j far has been only $10.50. The Or
ganization owes over $700 to the
| A.S.S.U. and hopes to economize
j and pay off the debt.
| CARDINALS MINUTES: Ap
! pointment of Dick Lyons and Ken
! Koch to Cardinals was approved by
' the committee.
