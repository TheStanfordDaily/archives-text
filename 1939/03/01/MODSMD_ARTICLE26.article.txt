# Excom Proposes Joint Junior-Senior Prom As Conflict Compromise
## Big Name Orchestra Suggested For Women's Gym, Minor Band Would Play in Darkened Studio 
### 
A combined Junior-Senior Prom lo he held April 14—this was the so
lution Ex Committee suggested last night to Ihc two classes' conflict over
dates for their proms.
