# Klystron's First Test Is Success
## Recent Farm Radio Invention Brings Plane Down 'Blind' 
### 
An airplane was successfully
brought to a blind landing at the
East Boston, Mass., airport yester
day in initial tests of a new
reports, in initial tests of a new
"straight path" blind landing sys
tem, developed with the aid of the
new Stanford ultra short-wave ra
dio invention, the klystron.
Scientists and army officials pres
ent said the test may be the begin
ning of a new era in flying. The
older "bent beam" plan was tested
in a similar way, but was not as
practical, the report said.
The blind landing system now
used often makes it necessary for
pilots to land in steps because they
find themselves above or below the
line of glide. Scientists declared
that Ihe new method would enable
planes to land on a "straight glide."
Stanford physicists said the klys
tron was assembled here and taken to
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, where Irving R. Metcalf, head
of the technical development of the
Civil Aeronautics Authority, and
Professor Edward L. Bowles werr
working on a blind flying system.
The klystron, a high-power ultra
short wave radio tube, became an
essential part of the new "straight
path" blind flying.
