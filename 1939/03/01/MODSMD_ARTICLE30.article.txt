# Interclub Council Meeting Considers Hall Revision Plan
## 
### 
Following Dean of Men John Dunn's announcement of a proposed re
vision oi the Farm dormitory system. Inter-Club Council met with Dean
liiinn late Monday night in Breakers' dining hall to voice their views on
the Toyon-Braiuier situation.
Dean Bttnn explained that the plan is only in a tentative form now, and.
if it is approved by Dr. Wilbur, all objections will be considered before

adoption. <
The purposes of the plan are to
provide better orientation facilities
lor the upper division transfers; to
assure eating clubs of more defi
nite room rights in Toyon; and to
provide definite eating facilities lor
independent men through the Bran
ner Dining Halls.
EL TIG RE OBJECTS
Chief objections to the plan were
raised by El Tigre and its spokes
man, Perry Moerdyke, who present
ed several reasons why the mem
bership of Tigre had registered im
mediate opposition to the proposal.
He stated that if each club were
allotted only 22 room rights it
would forever limit the appeal of
the eating club to prospective mem
bers if the club already had 22 mem
bers. To this Dean Bunn replied
that it is possible to room three in
the Toyon suites without too much
inconvenience.
BUNN QUALIFIES PLAN
Regarding the protest against
making Toyon a hall only for club
members Mr. Bunn replied that that
provision was not necessarily an es
sential part of the proposal. "If the
clubs desire, the rooms may be scat
tered throughout Toyon and Bran
ner, but I was under the impression
that they wanted a corridor for each
club," he continued. This also op
posed the statement that the clubs
would become cliques, and that jun
ior transfers would be isolated in
stead of being mixed in with old
students.
Sequoia representatives objected
because they claimed that if the plan
were put into operation it would de
tract from the eating club member
ship in the hall's own club.
El Torn registered complete ap
proval of the plan, with the possible
reservation that in making Toyon a
club hall, the club members should
not be divided into corridors.
