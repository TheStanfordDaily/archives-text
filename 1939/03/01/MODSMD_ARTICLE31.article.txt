AVALON, Feb. 28 (UP).â€”Dizzy
Dean contented himself with shag
ging fly balls while Bill Lee, Larry
French, Clay Bryant and other Chi
cago Cub pitchers started working
out here. It was the fourth day ol
training for the Cubs, but hard work
is not anticipated for several days
more when the remainder of the
regulars drift in. The team was fa
vored by warm weather and a bright
sky.
Twenty-nine nations were on the
allied side in the World War.
