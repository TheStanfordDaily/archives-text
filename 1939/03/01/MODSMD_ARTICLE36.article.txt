# 'Communism' To Be A.S.U. Topic Tonight
## Speakers to Present Diversified Views In Panel Forum 
### 
"Communism" will be the topic of
discussion at the American Student
Union's second "Town Hall" meet
ings of the quarter tonight at 8
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse.
According to Gene Glasmann,
president of the A.S.U., plans for
the co-operative book store will be
disclosed at a business meeting be
ginning at 7 o'clock.
With Dr. Bailey Willis, emeritus
professor of geology, John Pittman,
city editor of the "People's World,"
and Stanton Grilling, a resident of
Palo Alto who is a world war vet
eran, voicing their respective opin
ions, the meeting will be conducted
as an open forum with A.S.U. mem
bers and their friends invited to
take part.
DIFFERENT VIEWS
"Each of these speakers will have
an interesting angle on the topic,"
Miss Glasmann said. They repre
sent attitudes of three different
fields.
Having observed a primitive com
munistic society in the South Seas
and a communal experiment in the
Palestine mandate of Great Britain,
Dr. Willis is in a position to com
ment with authority on various
phases of communism.
LABOR EDITOR
Mr. Pittman, with experience on
labor journals over a long period of
time, is acquainted with the com
munist movement in the United
States. As editor and publisher of
the "Spokesman," Mr. Pittman was
active in the San Francisco labor
dispute of 1934.
Because Mr GrifTing is interested
in having people "understand what
they will have to give up to insti
tute an 'ism' in this country," he
said that he is particularly anxious
to participate with students in this
discussion.
