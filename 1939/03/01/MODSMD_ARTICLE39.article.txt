COUNTLESS GUNS have been aimed at millions of clay pigeons over
Sloan's Lake, near Denver, Colo., where for 27 years trapshooters have
been improving their marksmanship. Harold Roberts, above, and
Daniel Winters believed they couid find a lead mine there. They
went to work on it and are reclaiming a ton of lead a day at $(!5
a ton.
