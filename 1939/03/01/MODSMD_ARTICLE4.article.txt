Eye witness to the great historical
events of the past 50 years and par
ticipant, in many of the significant
political movements in the United
States during the same period,
Chester H. Rowcll, noted newspa
perman and former editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle, spoke last
night in Memorial Hall auditorium
in a program of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series.
Tracing his career as a university
professor, member of the House of
Representatives, and editor and
publisher of the Fresno Republican,
the speaker related personal expe
riences during his term as national
committeeman of the Progressive
party in the hotly contested presi
dential campaign of 191(5.
Founder-president of the Lincoln-
Roosevelt League in California, Mr.
Rowell told of his part in the or
ganization's successful fight to elim
inate the influence of the "Southern
Pacific's political machine" and end
the railroad's "rule of California."
Vivid memories of "the then wild
west town of Fresno" were recalled
by the journalist, who discussed the
political corruption of the town
and of the entire state and the deter
mination of the Lincoln-Roosevelt
League to "clean up the state Re
publican party from within if it can
and from without if it must."
