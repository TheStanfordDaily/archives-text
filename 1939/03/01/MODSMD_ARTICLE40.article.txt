# Batsmen to Play St. Mary's Today
## 
### 
With two victories in three con
ference starts behind them, the
Stanford baseball team meets St.
Mary's again this afternoon at
Moraga.
St. Mary's is now tied with the
Indians for second spot in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baseball
League. The Gaels turned back
Stanford 2 to 1 in 10 innings in their
first meeting but subsequently lost
by one run to the California club.
A1 Lazzarone and Bill Jameson
are the probable starting battery for
Stanford while Moragamen might
use rny of several combinations.
Most likely pitching choices would
be Happy Merrill, who has six wins
over Stanford to his credit, or Em
mett O'Neill.
Hawaiian literature, reduced to
writing in the last generation, was
preserved for centuries only in the
memories of the priests.
