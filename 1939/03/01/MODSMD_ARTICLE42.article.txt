PAUL HERRON will he 1!) years old Friday. Which means exactly noth
ing Jo \ou laymen unless you are interested in knowing that on that day,
young He iron will probably have completed bis annexation of all the U.S.
intercollegiate freshman individual records with one exception.
And on that day the Stanford frosh squad will be the sole owners of
every yearling mark in the 20-yard pool without any exception. The lone

one-man mark which Herron doesn't 4
hold, or won't get Friday, is in the!
200-yard breast-stroke. That be
longs to his team-mate, Scott Dud- |
ley.
If Herron comes through in the 00 I
and 440-yard free-style events
against Stockton J. C. Friday, they I
might publish the 1939 record book j
at (he Stanford Press to make the '
monopoly complete. Undoubtedly !
the present frosh crew is the great- !
est gathering of its kind ever to hit j
the Farm. When their little diver, i
Howard Adams, Far Western A.A.U.
champ, becomes eligible again. J
there's really no telling where they |
might stop in the next three years. j
CLINT EVANS. California's base
ball coach, is in a position to give j
the college diamond sport a big j
boost, but he's handling the pro
cedure in such a fashion that the !
boost is going to end up being a ;
boot—in the anterior regions.
i if.sxil >rd coaches and offiicals, as j
well as baseoall writers and play- !
ers in San Francisco, have been try- |
ing to get a Stanford-California |
and a St. Mary's-Santa Clara twin
bill for Seals' Stadium in an effort j
to build the sport up to its propel j
proportions. They know that college
ball, for all its inefficiencies, is!
faster and undoubtedly more hardly
fought than is professional ball. It's;
the old college try at work again.
Yet Evans doesn't want to give j
the scheme a chance because it'
might take away a home game from
the Berkeley park in 1940. Stanford
has offered to give one of its home
games this year to the project if the*
Bears will reciprocate in '40. Santa
Clara and St. Mary's play in the city
at every opportunity anyhow and 1
would revel in another show.
The same difficulty was met when
Hank Luisctti and his mates used to .
play basketball for the Red. Cali
fornia was perfectly willing to take
away a game from the Farm, but i
move out of their home pavilion in j
return—no, never!
TIIE HOME team always has a
certain psychological assurance that [
leads to more victories than are usu- '
ill ly gotten on the road. But when '
both teams are away, aren't the loss
es in psychology just about even?
The prestige to be gained by such a
move, in any or all sports, is what
college athletics are going to need if
they expect to keep pace with club
and professional activities. There
will be no place for pet idiosyncra
sies and stubbornness when other
teams begin to play as good or bet
ter than the colleges do, in stadia
where the common fan, with a five- j
cent street car fare, can see and en- !
joy the competition.
