# Card Cagers Dig in For Final Games
## Luisetti's High-point Record Not Rivaled By Trojan's Vaughn 
### 
Two legs down in their goitl with
two more attempts to go is the sit
uation the Stanford basketball team
finds itself in with the final two Cal
games on tap this week-end.
Last week the Cards set thern
i selves up the goal of achieving three
victories in their final four starts.
U.C.L.A. fell twice before the Stan
fords last week-end, 38-32 and 37-
I 33, and now all the Cards have to
1 do is win one of the two Cal games
to complete the goal.
However, besides satisfying their
' own ego Stanford could throw the
Conference race into a gordian knot
by winning one of the Bear games.
U.S.C. is now riding in second place
j one full game behind the Bears and
I if Stanford wins a game the Trojans
will slide into a first place tie for
the championship — provided they
defeat the U.C.L.A Bruins twice,
which is a foregone conclusion.
