# Yearling Hoopmen Prep for Cal Tilt
## 
### 
Undefeated in their last ten starts,
the Card freshmen will attempt to
handcuff California's powerful year
ling basketballers — Papoose victims
in the first, game of the series—in an
all-important week-end bill at Ber
keley and Stanford.
Since the Bearcubs took it on the
beak in the initial tilt of their an
nual grudge series, the Cal outfit has
come along fast, and only last Fri
day gave the Lowell High School
cagers of San Francisco a tough bat
tle before dropping the decision, 32-
29. Coach H. B. "Beeb" Lee's cag
ers were defeated by the same outfit,
31-28, their last defeat before the
winning streak started
