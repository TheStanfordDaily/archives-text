A.T.O.'s powerful intramural
quintet was put to its first real test
under fire and emerged unscathed,
beating a fighting Breakers team
26-15.
Though they were trailing 10-7 at
half time, (he A.T.O. unit rallied its
forces, clamped down on its rivals
on defense, sharpened its shooting
eyes, and pulled through to win.
It was the team play and good
eyes of A.T.O.'s all-mural forwards,
Bob Koch and Kai Larson, that
pulled them out of the fire and into
the semi-finals.
Still it was Ken Thunem, another
member of the mythical intramural
quintet, who took high scoring hon
ors with 9 digits for the Breakers.
Neal Sinclair of A.T.O. and Koch
followed Thunem, each having 7
digits.
The basketball efforts of one of
Tiny Thornhill's former prize tack
les, By West, was not quite enough
to turn the trick for Phi Psi's intra
mural cagers, and they were dump
ed by Sequoia 21-22.
Big By was high man for the
game with 11 markers, but he and
his teammates could not cope wiih
the quick scoring thrusts dealt by
Sequoia. The winners' attack was
built around two cracker jack for
wards, "Andy" Anderson and Howie
Hamlin, who each tanked 8 points.
Last night's games narrowed the

field of surviving quintets down to j
four. The fives, Zeta Psi If, Sigma j
Chi. A.T.0., and Sequoia, will be |
given a chance to rest up before J

LAST NIGHT'S RESULTS

Sequoia ill. Phi Kappa Psi 22
A.T.O.'s powerful intramural
quintet was put to its first real test
under fire and emerged unscathed,
beating a fighting Breakers team
26-15.
Though they were trailing 10-7 at
half time, (he A.T.O. unit rallied its
forces, clamped down on its rivals
on defense, sharpened its shooting
eyes, and pulled through to win.
It was the team play and good
eyes of A.T.O.'s all-mural forwards,
Bob Koch and Kai Larson, that
pulled them out of the fire and into
the semi-finals.
Still it was Ken Thunem, another
member of the mythical intramural
quintet, who took high scoring hon
ors with 9 digits for the Breakers.
Neal Sinclair of A.T.O. and Koch
followed Thunem, each having 7
digits.
The basketball efforts of one of
Tiny Thornhill's former prize tack
