# Not Quite Shatter-Proof

THROUGH the welter of tape, Excom strode,
and it finally dragged out a joint Junior-
Senior Prom.
But it didn't do it without good reason: both
the junior class and senior class presidents
seemed agreed it was a good idea, although
they were willing to cite plenty of disadvan
tages.
Excom finally thought it was a good idea,
although it was willing to recognize those dis
advantages.
The latter seem to be that both are being
royally rooked —neither one will get the nice
profits that accrue from big name dances
which have no conflicting events surrounding
ihem.
Neither one will be able to swell the already
sizable treasuries that both possess.
The advantages of both classes putting on a
joint dance include the point that neither stands
to lose; such a dance will relieve conflict with
many other spring quarter events already in
the offing.
And it would really be a big dance.
But the situation resolved itself into a shut
tling back and forth of the problem between
the two class presidents and Ex Committee —
neither one wanting to stick its neck out by
approving the joint dance, knowing that the
members of neither class would particularly
approve.
Ex Committee finally did it—by voicing the
opinion that it "would be a good thing," but left
the final fight up to the two classes, whose
Executive Committees meet Thursday night for
consideration of the issue.
There is little reason why such a joint dance
could not be worked out peaceably; there is
little reason why it shouldn't be the best dance
of the year—if the juniors and seniors can for
get they are breaking so-far inviolable prece
dent, agree on a big-name band, smooth out
the date situation.
It's unfortunate that both can't have their
dances. This way, it's either one or both to
gether.
Since neither one needs the money that
would accrue from giving one big dance alone,
since Stanford wants dances and doesn't par
ticularly care who gives them, since the ball-up
has already occurred, the joint Prom plan seems
the best.
Even though it breaks precedent for once,
even though Stanford will have to forget pre
cious tradition.

has already occurred, the joint Prom plan seems
the best.
Even though it breaks precedent for once,
even though Stanford will have to forget pre
cious tradition.
THROUGH the welter of tape, Excom strode,
and it finally dragged out a joint Junior-
Senior Prom.
But it didn't do it without good reason: both
the junior class and senior class presidents
seemed agreed it was a good idea, although
they were willing to cite plenty of disadvan
tages.
Excom finally thought it was a good idea,
although it was willing to recognize those dis
advantages.
The latter seem to be that both are being
royally rooked —neither one will get the nice
profits that accrue from big name dances
which have no conflicting events surrounding
ihem.
Neither one will be able to swell the already
sizable treasuries that both possess.
The advantages of both classes putting on a
joint dance include the point that neither stands
to lose; such a dance will relieve conflict with
many other spring quarter events already in
the offing.
And it would really be a big dance.
But the situation resolved itself into a shut
tling back and forth of the problem between
the two class presidents and Ex Committee —
neither one wanting to stick its neck out by
approving the joint dance, knowing that the
members of neither class would particularly
approve.
Ex Committee finally did it—by voicing the
opinion that it "would be a good thing," but left
the final fight up to the two classes, whose
Executive Committees meet Thursday night for
consideration of the issue.
There is little reason why such a joint dance
could not be worked out peaceably; there is
little reason why it shouldn't be the best dance
of the year—if the juniors and seniors can for
get they are breaking so-far inviolable prece
dent, agree on a big-name band, smooth out
the date situation.
It's unfortunate that both can't have their
dances. This way, it's either one or both to
gether.
Since neither one needs the money that
would accrue from giving one big dance alone,
since Stanford wants dances and doesn't par
ticularly care who gives them, since the ball-up
has already occurred, the joint Prom plan seems
the best.
Even though it breaks precedent for once,
even though Stanford will have to forget pre
cious tradition.
