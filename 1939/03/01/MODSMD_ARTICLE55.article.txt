# Stop and Consider
## 
### 
NOW that the Dean of Men has presented his
proposal to alter the men's hall set-up, it
is time for those concerned to stop and care
fully consider the effects of the change. That
this will call for a great deal of talk and thought
is a foregone conclusion. Interclub Council
discussed the scheme Monday night, brought
out its advantages and disadvantages, and
concluded nothing.
The results of the meeting coincide with
those of numerous bull sessions held in the
halls last night. Prime items on the proposal's
balance sheet are these:
Credits:
1. It will solve the problem of junior trans
fers by providing them with living accommo
dations on campus, orienting them, and making
them an integral part of the University.
2. It will provide residence eating facilities
for all independents in Branner dining hall.
3. It will supply the eating clubs with more
room rights than they have under the present
system.
4. It will go into effect gradually and will
not cause any changes for men now living in
the halls.
Debits:
1. It will segregate the eating clubs, creating
a situation which club members themselves
describe as "snobbish" and "too much like the
Row."
2. It will cause a definite split within the
halls.
3. It may result in sophomores' being forced
to live off campus because junior transfers will
be given preference in the assignment of rooms
formerly provided for second-year men.
4. It will separate junior transfers almost as
completely from the rest of Stanford as they
have been in the past by herding them to
gether in one group.
In presenting his proposal, Dean Bunn ex
pressed his willingness to make any changes
hall men may desire to iron out the problems it

presents. The only condition that must be
considered is that enough men are available
to make possible the opening of the Branner
Dining Hall; whether they live in Toyon or
Branner is immaterial.
Modifying the plan to mix clubmen, inde
pendents, and transfers in the halls probably
will provide the key to the situation. The Dean
of Men has expressed his approval. President
Wilbur is withholding his decision until he has
had time to study the set-up. Both are defi
nitely interested in campus opinion.
If the hall men favor the change, or if they
don't, now is the time for them to say so.—L. L.

Row."
2. It will cause a definite split within the
halls.
3. It may result in sophomores' being forced
to live off campus because junior transfers will
be given preference in the assignment of rooms
formerly provided for second-year men.
4. It will separate junior transfers almost as
completely from the rest of Stanford as they
have been in the past by herding them to
gether in one group.
In presenting his proposal, Dean Bunn ex
pressed his willingness to make any changes
hall men may desire to iron out the problems it

presents. The only condition that must be
considered is that enough men are available
to make possible the opening of the Branner
Dining Hall; whether they live in Toyon or
Branner is immaterial.
Modifying the plan to mix clubmen, inde
pendents, and transfers in the halls probably
will provide the key to the situation. The Dean
of Men has expressed his approval. President
Wilbur is withholding his decision until he has
had time to study the set-up. Both are defi
nitely interested in campus opinion.
If the hall men favor the change, or if they
don't, now is the time for them to say so.—L. L.
NOW that the Dean of Men has presented his
proposal to alter the men's hall set-up, it
is time for those concerned to stop and care
fully consider the effects of the change. That
this will call for a great deal of talk and thought
is a foregone conclusion. Interclub Council
discussed the scheme Monday night, brought
out its advantages and disadvantages, and
concluded nothing.
The results of the meeting coincide with
those of numerous bull sessions held in the
halls last night. Prime items on the proposal's
balance sheet are these:
Credits:
1. It will solve the problem of junior trans
fers by providing them with living accommo
dations on campus, orienting them, and making
them an integral part of the University.
2. It will provide residence eating facilities
for all independents in Branner dining hall.
3. It will supply the eating clubs with more
room rights than they have under the present
system.
4. It will go into effect gradually and will
not cause any changes for men now living in
the halls.
Debits:
1. It will segregate the eating clubs, creating
a situation which club members themselves
describe as "snobbish" and "too much like the
Row."
2. It will cause a definite split within the
halls.
3. It may result in sophomores' being forced
to live off campus because junior transfers will
be given preference in the assignment of rooms
formerly provided for second-year men.
