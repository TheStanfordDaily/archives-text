### JOHN COBBS 
THE WORK IS YET TO COME
"t'VEN though the Stanford cage varsity stands an
excellent chance of upsetting the pace-setting
California Golden Bears, Farm students didn't show
much interest in yesterday's first day sale of ducats
in the two-game series." Such was the plaintive
comment of a Daily sports writer yesterday. Despite
its doleful note, I find it vaguely cheering; evidently I
am not the only one who let the weather beguile him
into contradicting the University calendar.
Perhaps I had best make it clear that this comment
concerns the basketball team only incidentally. The
real subject matter is winter quarter, and sunshine,
and grade points. Basketball players will oblige me
by reading all the way through before they roll up
their sleeves and drop around for an explanation.
The only reason for mentioning the basketball team
is that ticket sales are always a good barometer of
the spirits of Stanford students. Research has shown
that interest in athletics varies inversely with the
square of the student's distance from a C average.
According to this theory, our statistics indicate that
Farm students are completely surrounded by eight
balls.
The causes of our present scholastic chaos are rooted
in Stanford's attitude toward winter quarter. Ac
cording to the traditional philosophy, winter is a
time for hard work and economy. Usually there is
nothing to do during the quarter but. concentrate on
going to school. The weather is cold as a kiss from a
maiden aunt; all the decent, orchestras go south with
the rest of the songbirds. Nothing is left to do but join
in the scavenger hunt for knowledge.

r JPHIS year, a combination of circumstances has tor
pedoed our plans. The weather has been like
something made up specially for the chamber of com
merce. The fiesta spirit so carefully distilled for the
San Francisco Fair has filtered down to the Farm, and
activities have picked up momentum instead of idling
in neutral.
And so at the end of the quarter all of us find
nothing done on the work we contracted to clean up.
We kicked ourselves into taking tough courses, ex
pecting to hole up on rainy week-ends and make a
noise like students. And instead of working we sat
out in the sun, soaking up ultra-violet rays, which
might, please the life insurance companies but makes
no impression on the University.
* * * &
Just at the moment, we are all busy paying up the
wages of our sin, with time and a half for overtime.
After all, we can't scrawl across our bluebooks, "I
don't know the questions, but I've developed a mar
velous defensive game of tit-tat-to."

r JPHIS year, a combination of circumstances has tor
pedoed our plans. The weather has been like
something made up specially for the chamber of com
merce. The fiesta spirit so carefully distilled for the
San Francisco Fair has filtered down to the Farm, and
activities have picked up momentum instead of idling
in neutral.
And so at the end of the quarter all of us find
nothing done on the work we contracted to clean up.
We kicked ourselves into taking tough courses, ex
pecting to hole up on rainy week-ends and make a
noise like students. And instead of working we sat
out in the sun, soaking up ultra-violet rays, which
might, please the life insurance companies but makes
no impression on the University.
* * * &
Just at the moment, we are all busy paying up the
wages of our sin, with time and a half for overtime.
After all, we can't scrawl across our bluebooks, "I
don't know the questions, but I've developed a mar
velous defensive game of tit-tat-to."
THE WORK IS YET TO COME
"t'VEN though the Stanford cage varsity stands an
excellent chance of upsetting the pace-setting
California Golden Bears, Farm students didn't show
much interest in yesterday's first day sale of ducats
in the two-game series." Such was the plaintive
comment of a Daily sports writer yesterday. Despite
its doleful note, I find it vaguely cheering; evidently I
am not the only one who let the weather beguile him
into contradicting the University calendar.
Perhaps I had best make it clear that this comment
concerns the basketball team only incidentally. The
real subject matter is winter quarter, and sunshine,
and grade points. Basketball players will oblige me
by reading all the way through before they roll up
their sleeves and drop around for an explanation.
The only reason for mentioning the basketball team
is that ticket sales are always a good barometer of
the spirits of Stanford students. Research has shown
that interest in athletics varies inversely with the
square of the student's distance from a C average.
According to this theory, our statistics indicate that
Farm students are completely surrounded by eight
balls.
The causes of our present scholastic chaos are rooted
in Stanford's attitude toward winter quarter. Ac
cording to the traditional philosophy, winter is a
time for hard work and economy. Usually there is
nothing to do during the quarter but. concentrate on
going to school. The weather is cold as a kiss from a
maiden aunt; all the decent, orchestras go south with
the rest of the songbirds. Nothing is left to do but join
in the scavenger hunt for knowledge.
