### DOUG JAQUES 
The young man in the green gabardine pants came
into the room where the Bunch was loafing, and the
girl wearing the short stockings and the tight, sweater
made a subtle motion with her body implying that
she had moved over to make room for him to sit down
beside her on the couch. The young man in the green
gabardines noticed her gesture and came over to sit
beside her.
"What's doing," he said.
"Hello, dear," she said.
Thoy watched A1 show how his German professor
walked, and laughed when the Bunch laughed.
"Swell day ,isn't it?" he said.
"Marvelous," she said.

"That's what I told Elaine."
"Elaine?" She looked at him sharply.
"Yeah. I went up to see her for a couple of
minutes."
"You went up to see her?" she asked icily.
"Yeah."
"Was that fair?"
"Huh?" lie said. Do I always have to say the
wrong thing, lie said to himself.
"You didn't ask me first."
"I had to sec her."
"You had to see her?"
"It was business."

"It was business," she mocked him, sweetly. "What
did you talk about?"
"Oh, we talked about you She asked me how you
were, and I said you were fine."
"But were you quite fair? Shouldn't you have
asked mo first? I don't go over to see other men. I
try to be fair."
"She had some notes I had to see for an exam to
morrow. It was business"
"I'm sure it was," she said very sweetly. She flut
tered her eye-lashes. "Elaine's a swell girl. Why don't
you take her out some time?"

"Yeah," lie said. "Maybe I will."
The girl with the short socks and tight sweater
glared at him. hut her words came out sweetly.
"You should. I know you would have a wonderful
time."
"Yeah."
Al was doing his imitation again, hut they
didn't notice.
"But you will he honorable, won't you?"
The young man in the green slacks didn't
move, hut one eyebrow did.
"You'll ask me first, won't yon?" She was be
ing very sweet.
"Oh, sure."

"That s nice of you, dear." She was beginning to
find il difficult to be sweet. "But I think you had bet
ter go. I m afraid this has given me a headache."
"Gee, I'm sorry."
"It's all right, dear."
He got up and went to the door. He turned toward
her. "It was business, honest."
"Of course."
After the young man in the green gabardines
had left, she wondered what she would wear that
night. She wondered what the young man with the
blond hair and Hoick would like her to wear.
