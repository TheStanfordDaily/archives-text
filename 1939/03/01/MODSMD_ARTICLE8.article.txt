# Death Is Theme Of Prize Play
## 'Angry Mountain' Set for Production 
### 
" "Angry Mountain' is a study of
contrasting characters thrown to
gether by chance during a stormy
night in the Tyrolean Alps," stated
June Lee Dimmit, author of one of
the winning plays in Ramshead's
one-act play contest, in reference to
her prize-winner.
"Angry Mountain" will be given
on Friday and Saturday, March 10
and 11, on the same program with
"Beginning Without End" by Jim
Stone and "Thirty Years" by Art
Levinson. Melba Rac Toombs is di
recting all three.
"Angry Mountain" was written
originally as a short story, but the
author found it entirely unsatisfac
tory in that form and decided that
it would profit by the dialogue in
play form, although it was an ex
periment on her part, because she
had never before written a play.
In the writer's own words, "The
idea was conceived around the ques
tion: Can the person who talks
glibly of death face it when it comes,
and if he shrinks from it in actual
ity, what causes the shrinking—is it
the realization that no one, nothing,
is worth dying for?"
From this idea rose the charac
ters, a Tyrolean innkeeper, his un
faithful wife, a blase American girl,
a young consumptive Englishman
and his wife, and the innkeeper's old
mother. The setting was chosen
only because it provides appropriate
background for the events of the
night.
The set, the interior of an inn in
the Austrian mountains, was de
signed by Johnny Paulson and is
being built by a stage crew under
his direction. Any volunteers for the
technical staff will be welcomed by
the stage manager.
