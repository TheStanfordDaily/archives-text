# History ... 1939

### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
"W/AR by spring.
Since the world has recovered
from the shock of the Munich Crisis,
foreign correspondents and syndi
cated authorities on the internation
al situation have been predicting a
European conflict lx;fore Easter.
These men are jingoists; they
make their bread and butter by
scaring nice old ladies and ribbon
clerks, but there are grains of truth
in the sensational statements they
:-;o glibly spout. A swift, accurate
glance through the field glasses
shows u.s definitely that trouble? is
brewing across the Atlantic. Today,
March 2, 1939, the situation looks
like this:
* * *
The defeated Republicans are
holding fast to their hunk of ter
ritory in central Spain in the liope|
that the democratic states and the
dictatorships will come to blows
this month. Figuring that if war
arrives France and England will
support him against the victo
rious Nationalists, Loyalist Pre
mier Juan Negrin will not sur
render until his one last chance
goes up in smoke. While the world
prays for peace, this man hopes
for war.
In an effort to win Generalissimo
Franco away from the Rome-Berlin
axis, Chamberlain and Daladier
were prompt and courteous in their
recognition of the new Spanish
government. A report yesterday
from French Foreign Minister Bon
net indicates that the democracies
may reap a little dividend for their
trouble.

ALTHOUGH he may be a little
over - enthusiastic, M. Bonnet
claimed that the Nationalists have
asked Mussolini to call his troops
home from Spain. When the Italian
.soldiers are safely back in their own
backyard, it's time to believe the
story. Until then, one can't help be
ing just a bit skeptical.
The Civil War may be at an end,
but Spain offers few encouraging
signs for European peace. With
both the fascists and the democ
racies struggling to lure the Span
iards over to their side of the
fence, Spain is just another bone
of contention in an overflowing
plate.

Both France and Italy have spent
the past weeks in mobilizing troops
in their respective colonies in North
Africa. Territorial rights in that
part of the world have provided a
threat to peace since Mussolini start
ed gazing at Tunisia and Djibouti
with a lean and hungry look.
In the homeland, too, II Duce is
preparing his armies for action and
has every industry working at top
speed. Italian citizens living in
France have been ordered to report
for duty, and they are pouring
across the frontier by the thousands.
In southern Europe the stage is set
for war.
Jjt sjt %
/ 1 ERMANY is the best defended
* nation in the world, according
to her own boasts, and the Nazis
don't seem to be afraid of any
thing. Yesterday General Gocring
told the Rcich that it possesses
an air force so powerful that last
fall it could have smashed any
enemy without half trying if the
Munich conference had not end
cd the way it did.
There is a great deal of truth in
this claim because Britain, by her
own admission, was completely de
fenseless at the time of the Septem
ber crisis. But. during the past five
months the English have been de
veloping air raid precautions and a
more-than-adequate defense sys
tem. Shown once that the old tra
dition of muddling Ihrough won't
protect London from Hitler's super
cflicient bombers, Britain is armed
to the teeth and all ready to go.

Wherever one turns the field
glasses, the horizon is dark. Every
nation in Europe is tense with ex
pectation. The danger in this sit
uation lies in the fact that even an
exploding fire-cracker wouldn't
have much trouble starting a war.
