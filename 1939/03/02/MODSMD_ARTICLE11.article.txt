# 'A Night's Lodging' Stuns Audience
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
Unevenly, disjointedly, but with a force that gathered momentum as
action progressed, Maxim Gorky's "A Night's lodging," opening a four
night run in the Little Theater last night, brought intense social drama to
Stanford theatergoers.
Directed by Thomas Wood Stevens and featuring a cast of 17, the four
scene depiction of life in a Russian flop-house will continue through Sat-

urday evening. <
Starting slowly, the cast picked
up speed as the emotional tone be
came more definitely established.
Settings, designed and executed by
Bill Bassett, formed a perfect back
ground for the tense, sordid portray
al of lower-class existence.
DOWN -AND- OUTERS
Disillusioned, without hope or
faith, a thief, a street-walker, a
shoemaker, a former baronâ€”all are
jolted from the drabness of their
days by a strangely philosophical
tramp who sets them all to seeking
Truth.
But. "A Night's Lodging" is not so
simply motivated. Dominated by a
strongly depressing atmosphere and
preserving a validity of dialogue
that gives direction to normal stage
business, the play is a powerful so
cial commentary.
CAST GAINS ASSURANCE
Though the monotony of action
in the earlier moments slows the
development, tempo speeds faster as
the cast gains assurance. Gordon
Williams as Luke, the philosopher
pilgrim, handles a character role
with ease. Shirley Jones, playing a
difficult role to perfection, was a
standout, in the supporting cast.
Doug Bryan, Dana Winters, Ashcr
Wilson, Art Levinson, Charles Bu
lotti, costumed effectively, hit
speeches and action with satisfac
tory results. J. P Calm, as Satine,
gives his usual technically superb
performance. His voice and stage
manner show unequaled artistry.
Though the Moscow Art Theater
is reputed to have spent an entire
year in studying and preparing for
its performance of "A Night's Lodg
ing," Thomas Wood Stevens, assist
ed by Art Levinson, June Falcone,
and Catherine Forbes, did a very
good job with his Stanford cast in
considerably less time.
