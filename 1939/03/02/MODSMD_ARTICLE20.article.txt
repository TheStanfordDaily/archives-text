# Cardinals Set Convalescent Drive Dates
## Annual Campaign Slated for May 1-6 
### 
Convalescent Home Drive, Stan- !
ford's big spring quarter activity, has
been definitely scheduled for the
week of May 1-6, with Clint Olson
as chairman, according to Roy
Thompson, head of Cardinals.
Since the date was not granted
until the Cardinals meeting last
night, committees to work with Ol
son have not. been appointed, but
will be dccided upon at next week's
meeting. Other details of the drive
were discussed, including the
amount of assessment of each stu
dent. This year students will be
asked for as much as they want to
give, instead of a set amount.
Progress on the date calendar was
reported by the committee of Roy
Thompson, Didi Vibert, and Mary
Kay Horton. If the program is
adopted, it will eliminate all con
flict lx;tween important campus ac
tivities. Dances with big name
bands will be scheduled at. long
enough intervals to draw crowds.
EXCOM SETS DATES
Under the present system, Ex
Committee must schedule each date
separately as a request comes up.
As a result, the end of a quarter and
spring quarter are jammed full of
important activities.
In response to requests by stu
dents, Dick Lyon was appointed to
investigate the possibility of estab
lishing a central last and found bu
reau. Now each department has its
own office for lost articles, which
often makes it necessary for students
to go to each office to find straying
possessions.
Because there has been much dis
cussion lately on what students
want in the way of entertainment,
Dick Frank and Ken Cuthbertson
have been working on a question
naire to determine this. Andy
Stojkovich and Mary Morris Boggs
were added to the committee on the
questionnaire. It is expected that
after Cardinals knows what the
campus wants, they will be able to
plan more popular functions.
CONN REPORTS
Rovena Conn reported on the pro
gram that Cardinals is giving today
at Paly High as representatives of
Stanford.
Ken Koch was appointed chair
man of the Registration Boathouse
Dance, which will be held on Reg
night next fall. Johnny Seamans
will work with Koch on the dance.
