# Munitions Blast Rocks Japan
## Army Takes Over As Scores Die in Fires 
### 
OSAKA, Japan, Thursday, March j
2 (UP).—More than 50,000 men wore j
massed in the suburb of Hirakata j
today in an effort to restore order
following a munitions dump explo- j
sion in which scores of persons were j
reported killed or injured.
The explosions began late yester- i
day in the Ukinno munitions dump!
—one of the most important in the i
empire—and continued for hours. J
Many buildings were set on fire,!
railway and tram services were dis- j
rupted and telephone and high ten- j
sion lines were knocked down.
Military authorities immediately j
summoned an army to cope with i
the situation. Army engineers be- j
gan tearing down buildings in the
path of the flames and 117 fire com- j
panics, fighting fires spread over j
several square miles, were assisted j
by the 16th infantry division, sum- j
monecl from barracks in Kyoto 20 j
miles away, an infantry battalion and J
2000 policemen.
Four hundred relief workers were j
sent to care for families made home- j
less by the disaster.
All roads leading into the suburb 1
were blocked off by the military. 1
Osaka police headquarters said j
the situation was "under control" j
before midnight and that railway j
service in the district had been re- j
stored. Newspapermen were not al- i
lowed near the scene, however, and !
no details were given out.
Guards around munitions plants j
in the whole Saka area—the chief j
munitions center of the empire — |
were doubled on the theory that '
spies might have caused the explo- !
sion.
