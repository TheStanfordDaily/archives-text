# Card Debaters In Tilt with Cal
## 
### 
Walt Stoessel and Frank Mallory,
Stanford debaters, will meet repre
sentatives from California this eve
ning at 7:30 in the Women's Club
house. The subject of this forensic
tilt, which is the second in a series,
is "Resolved, that Roosevelt should
be elected for a third term."
Stanford will present the negative
side of this question and will also
present the first evaluation.
According to Bob Putnam, de
bate manager, the meet will be of
the problem-solving type. This new
method of debating, which features
a cross examination of 15 minutes'
duration instead of a straight re
buttal, was tried out successfully
last week in the first of the debate
series with Cal.
It is anticipated that at this eve
ning's debate, the chairman will take
more active part in the discussion,
regulating the length of cross-ex
amination and discriminating be
tween questions asked. This change,
according to Putham, was brought
about as the result of audience
criticism of last week's meet.
