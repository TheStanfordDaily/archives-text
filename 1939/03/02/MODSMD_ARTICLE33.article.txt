# Capacity House Expected For Igor Gorin Concert
## 
### 
In order t<> accommodate the large audience expected at tlic Igor Gorin
concert next Wednesday night, special seats will be constructed on the
stage and over the orchestra pit.
Priced at S2, these scats are on sale at the Concert Series Office, at
David Keehle's in Palo Alto, and at Sherman Clay & Co. in San Jose.

► Gorin, came to this country a little
over three years ago. At that time
his English vocabulary consisted of
two words — "yes" and "okay,"
since he had been told by his col
leagues in the Czechoslovakia State
Opera that they were the only words
he would need to get along in
America.
OPERA PREFERRED
At first the singer's radio sponsors
felt he planned his programs to in
clude too much highbrow music, but
his fan mail shows that Gorin's lis
teners prefer opera, light opera se
lections and American ballads to
jazz and swing five to one.
Although the program for Gorin's
Stanford concex*t has not been an
nounced, ticket - holders may be
sure of hearing the famous "Largo
Al Factotum" from Rossini's "Bar
ber of Seville," as popular demand
has obliged him to include it in all
of his programs.
Last year, the Russian baritone
made his American concert debut
at the Hollywood bowl and he sub
sequently made a most successful
coast-to-coast recital tour climaxed
by an appearance at New York's
capital. An Albany paper said of
him:
CRITICS COMMENT
Equally at home in the operatic
stand-bys or the lighter types of
balladry, Mr. Gorin has perfected a
magnificent natural voice to the
point where it obeys his slightest
wish. Of pure baritone quality, his
upper tones ring out with the virility
of a robust tenor. . . . He invests
his songs with a quality of humor
that is infectious and the audience
loved it."
