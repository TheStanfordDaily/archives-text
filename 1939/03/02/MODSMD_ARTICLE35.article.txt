Building a second story presented 1
the most difficult construction prob- ,
I lem. Since the building was orig- !
j inally a library, many of the ceilings
; are 21 feet in height, so contractors I
j ran a five-foot stairway from the j
! ground floor, and made two stories j
by building a new floor 12 feet j
I above the first one.
The old dean of men's office will i
be taken over by the Stanford alum- !
; ni office, thus giving Robert Ham
