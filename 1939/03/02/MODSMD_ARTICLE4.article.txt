# Decision On Senior Prom Still Pending
## Class Committees Will Meet to Decide On Joint April Dance 
### 
Meeting for a follow-up decision
on Ex Committee's recommendation
that Junior and Senior classes hold
a joint Prom Spring Quarter, Senior
Ex Committee will meet tonight at
7:15 o'clock in Ex Committee room,
according to Dave Ryus, class
president.
An attempt will be made to,
formulate definite plans to take the
place of those arranged before it was
learned that no "name band" could
be obtained for the Senior Prom,
originally scheduled for March 10.
The alternate plan, brought into
being after the collapse of initial
schedule, to hold the Prom April
28, met with obstacles on the
grounds that it would follow too
closely the already planned Junior
Prom. Final decision will rest on
the results of a similar Excom
meeting of the junior leaders to
night.
Also on tap for final planning by
the Senior Ex Committee will be
the Promenade, suggested by Ryus
several weeks ago as an additional
class function. According to his
suggestion, senior men and women
would meet after dinner in Union
Court, some evening in spring
quarter to spend an hour of con
versation while an orchestra plays
in the background. The class would
then walk in couples to the Inner
Quad, around Memorial Court, and
unite again to sing the Stanford
Hymn as closing event of the eve
ning.
