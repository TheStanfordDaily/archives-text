Just to show the reading public
lhat our complaint yesterday about
Clint Evans, California baseball
coach, wasn't based on pi'ejudice
alone, we are giving a portion of
space today to a great idea which
the Bear mentor initiated eight
years ago.
He calls it "Co-eds' Day" and the
general motive is to create a degree
of feminine interest in the diamond
sport. The gals holding lucky num
bers at a particular game even do
nated merchandise prizes and ev
erybody connected has a helluva
good time during the afternoon se
lected.
* * *
WHETHER YOU like California
or no, you've got to admit that some
of their innovations over there are
pretty good. Stanford wouldn't lose
a thing by copying the present
scheme. The last time a woman saw
a contest on our Sunken Diamond
was during the year one of the mar
ried outfielders used to make his
wife come out so he wouldn't have
to walk home after the game.
We never did get Harry Wolter's
views on the weak but fair sex, but
it seems to us that a customer is a
customer, no matter what the gen
der. The players on the Sunken
Diamond are far enough away so
that an occasional slip of ihe tongue
wouldn't shock the comely ones be
yond forgiveness.
So if Wolter and his squad would
care to give over a St. Mary's or
Santa Clara game to the cause, it's
a cinch that the Daily and the varied
women's organizations about the
Farm would co-operate fully and
completely. And if they want some
one to give out the prizes, we think
we know a couple of fellows who
would be more than glad to help the
ladies out. If Harry wants to for
get the whole thing, we'll let it drop
here; if he likes the plan, you can
start getting dates for a baseball
game, of all things.

HARRY MALONEY has offered
the University or Olympic Club of
San Francisco the privileges of
Stanford Stadium for their rugby
game this Saturday as part of a !
double-feature bill. Stanford plays j
the Medical School in the regularly j
scheduled match.
Of course, the proposal has to !
pass through the hands of the |
8.A.C., and the visiting clubs nat- I
urally have to pay their own ex
penses, still the prospect of two i
Class A games in the same afternoon
inviting to the rugby palate. The
Olympics are especially strong, what
with seven former Indians in their
ranks while the University aggrega
tion is much better than average.
Regardless of the outcome of the
two-game proposal, Stanford will
play the Medics in what should be
only a practice tilt preparatory to
the California game a week later.
Coaches Maloney, Wylie, and Clas
sen are leading their charges into an
apparent double championship, in
the Northern California Rugby :
League and the Pacific Coast Con
ference. In six games to date, Stan
ford has scored 66 points to the op

position's 28, with victories over
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. included in the
summary.

STANFORD'S BEST boxing team
in years closes its regular season to
night at Berkeley. Heavyweight
I John Ward will probably get his
j workout carrying water or taping
hands. The big champion has had
i only one fight in intercollegiate
competition.
After winning the all-University
| title without opposition, he boxed
; only a round and a half in three
tussles. The Cal Aggies bruiser who
; faced him in that long four-minute
struggle just couldn't see the sense
in leaving his head parked on the
guillotine any longer.
Ward had a wrenched shoulder
i against U.C.L.A., but Bill Greer, a
| nominal light-heavy, handled his
j man for him. The California champ
got one look at him last Friday,
then started back to Berkeley to
! finish his math lessons.
WE ARE not razzing anyone for
walking out on the Indian white
j hope. There is no question about
the fact that Ward's only competi
| tion in the collegiate circles will be
i from those men who enter the Pa
cific Coast championships at Davis
l in a few weeks.
It wouldn't hurt Stanford's ath
letic reputation a bit to send up four
or five men, or possibly a full team
' to the intercollegiates. Competition
! up there comes from experts who
; were bom with rubber teeth in
! their mouths, but the Indians might
j just as well take advantage of the
I swell stock they have. Teams with
J the combined ability of the present
j crew don't come around every
year.

I John Ward will probably get his
j workout carrying water or taping
hands. The big champion has had
i only one fight in intercollegiate
competition.
After winning the all-University
| title without opposition, he boxed
; only a round and a half in three
tussles. The Cal Aggies bruiser who
; faced him in that long four-minute
struggle just couldn't see the sense
in leaving his head parked on the
guillotine any longer.
Ward had a wrenched shoulder
i against U.C.L.A., but Bill Greer, a
| nominal light-heavy, handled his
j man for him. The California champ
got one look at him last Friday,
then started back to Berkeley to
! finish his math lessons.
WE ARE not razzing anyone for
walking out on the Indian white
j hope. There is no question about
the fact that Ward's only competi
| tion in the collegiate circles will be
i from those men who enter the Pa
cific Coast championships at Davis
l in a few weeks.
It wouldn't hurt Stanford's ath
letic reputation a bit to send up four
or five men, or possibly a full team
' to the intercollegiates. Competition
! up there comes from experts who
; were bom with rubber teeth in
! their mouths, but the Indians might
j just as well take advantage of the
I swell stock they have. Teams with
J the combined ability of the present
j crew don't come around every
year.
Just to show the reading public
lhat our complaint yesterday about
Clint Evans, California baseball
coach, wasn't based on pi'ejudice
alone, we are giving a portion of
space today to a great idea which
the Bear mentor initiated eight
years ago.
He calls it "Co-eds' Day" and the
general motive is to create a degree
of feminine interest in the diamond
sport. The gals holding lucky num
bers at a particular game even do
nated merchandise prizes and ev
erybody connected has a helluva
good time during the afternoon se
lected.
* * *
WHETHER YOU like California
or no, you've got to admit that some
of their innovations over there are
pretty good. Stanford wouldn't lose
a thing by copying the present
scheme. The last time a woman saw
a contest on our Sunken Diamond
was during the year one of the mar
ried outfielders used to make his
wife come out so he wouldn't have
to walk home after the game.
We never did get Harry Wolter's
views on the weak but fair sex, but
it seems to us that a customer is a
customer, no matter what the gen
der. The players on the Sunken
Diamond are far enough away so
that an occasional slip of ihe tongue
wouldn't shock the comely ones be
yond forgiveness.
So if Wolter and his squad would
care to give over a St. Mary's or
Santa Clara game to the cause, it's
a cinch that the Daily and the varied
women's organizations about the
Farm would co-operate fully and
completely. And if they want some
one to give out the prizes, we think
we know a couple of fellows who
would be more than glad to help the
ladies out. If Harry wants to for
get the whole thing, we'll let it drop
here; if he likes the plan, you can
start getting dates for a baseball
game, of all things.

HARRY MALONEY has offered

game this Saturday as part of a !

Class A games in the same afternoon
inviting to the rugby palate. The
Olympics are especially strong, what
with seven former Indians in their
ranks while the University aggrega
tion is much better than average.
Regardless of the outcome of the
two-game proposal, Stanford will
play the Medics in what should be
only a practice tilt preparatory to
the California game a week later.
Coaches Maloney, Wylie, and Clas

apparent double championship, in
the Northern California Rugby :

here; if he likes the plan, you can
start getting dates for a baseball
game, of all things.

HARRY MALONEY has offered
the University or Olympic Club of
San Francisco the privileges of
Stanford Stadium for their rugby
game this Saturday as part of a !
double-feature bill. Stanford plays j
the Medical School in the regularly j
scheduled match.
Of course, the proposal has to !
pass through the hands of the |
8.A.C., and the visiting clubs nat- I
urally have to pay their own ex
penses, still the prospect of two i
Class A games in the same afternoon
inviting to the rugby palate. The
Olympics are especially strong, what
with seven former Indians in their
ranks while the University aggrega
tion is much better than average.
Regardless of the outcome of the
two-game proposal, Stanford will
play the Medics in what should be
only a practice tilt preparatory to
the California game a week later.
Coaches Maloney, Wylie, and Clas
sen are leading their charges into an
apparent double championship, in
the Northern California Rugby :
League and the Pacific Coast Con
ference. In six games to date, Stan
ford has scored 66 points to the op

position's 28, with victories over
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. included in the
summary.

STANFORD'S BEST boxing team
in years closes its regular season to
night at Berkeley. Heavyweight
I John Ward will probably get his
j workout carrying water or taping
hands. The big champion has had
i only one fight in intercollegiate
competition.
After winning the all-University
| title without opposition, he boxed
; only a round and a half in three
tussles. The Cal Aggies bruiser who
; faced him in that long four-minute
struggle just couldn't see the sense
in leaving his head parked on the
guillotine any longer.
Ward had a wrenched shoulder
i against U.C.L.A., but Bill Greer, a
| nominal light-heavy, handled his
j man for him. The California champ
got one look at him last Friday,
then started back to Berkeley to
! finish his math lessons.
WE ARE not razzing anyone for
walking out on the Indian white
j hope. There is no question about
the fact that Ward's only competi
| tion in the collegiate circles will be
i from those men who enter the Pa
cific Coast championships at Davis
l in a few weeks.
It wouldn't hurt Stanford's ath
letic reputation a bit to send up four
or five men, or possibly a full team
' to the intercollegiates. Competition
! up there comes from experts who
; were bom with rubber teeth in
! their mouths, but the Indians might
j just as well take advantage of the
I swell stock they have. Teams with
J the combined ability of the present
j crew don't come around every
year.
Just to show the reading public
lhat our complaint yesterday about
Clint Evans, California baseball
coach, wasn't based on pi'ejudice
alone, we are giving a portion of
space today to a great idea which
the Bear mentor initiated eight
years ago.
He calls it "Co-eds' Day" and the
general motive is to create a degree
of feminine interest in the diamond
sport. The gals holding lucky num
bers at a particular game even do
nated merchandise prizes and ev
erybody connected has a helluva
good time during the afternoon se
lected.
* * *
WHETHER YOU like California
or no, you've got to admit that some
of their innovations over there are
pretty good. Stanford wouldn't lose
a thing by copying the present
scheme. The last time a woman saw
a contest on our Sunken Diamond
was during the year one of the mar
ried outfielders used to make his
wife come out so he wouldn't have
to walk home after the game.
We never did get Harry Wolter's
views on the weak but fair sex, but
it seems to us that a customer is a
customer, no matter what the gen
der. The players on the Sunken
Diamond are far enough away so
that an occasional slip of ihe tongue
wouldn't shock the comely ones be
yond forgiveness.
So if Wolter and his squad would
care to give over a St. Mary's or
Santa Clara game to the cause, it's
a cinch that the Daily and the varied
women's organizations about the
Farm would co-operate fully and
completely. And if they want some
one to give out the prizes, we think
we know a couple of fellows who
would be more than glad to help the
ladies out. If Harry wants to for
get the whole thing, we'll let it drop
here; if he likes the plan, you can
start getting dates for a baseball
game, of all things.
