# Indian Fencers To Meet Bears
## 
### 
Stanford fencers will meet Cal to
renew the ancient rivalry Saturday
morning at Cal. It promises to be a
close match for the varsity since
the Cards only beat Cal by the nar
row margin of 13-12 in the Heron
Trophy Matches last quarter. The
match represents the biggest event
of the year for the Stanford foilmen,
and they have been working toward
this match all quarter.
Both the frosh and varsity teams
will compete, the frosh matches
coming off in the morning at 10
o'clock, and the varsity tussle at
1:45 o'clock in the afternoon.
