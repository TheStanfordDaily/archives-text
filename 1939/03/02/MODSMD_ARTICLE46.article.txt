# Hoopmen Primed For Cal Series
## 
### 
Weakened by the injuries of Don
Burness, flashy soph center, and
Bill Rapp, Coach Everett Dean has
been running his varsity cagers
through strenuous scrimmages in
preparation for the two-game series
with Cal this week-end.
Burness may not play at all this
week-end, and Rapp will be out
some of the time. To make up for
this the Indians must connect with
the basket in every shot. And they
will have their hands full trying to
cover the giants of the Bear team.
Although the odds are about 10-1
against the Cards taking either of
the games, they will put up a hard
and desperate fight against the su
perior Cal men. The disadvantage
of playing in the 800-erkeley Pa
vilion must be faced Friday night,
but Saturday will be a home game.
