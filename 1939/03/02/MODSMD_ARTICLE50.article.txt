# Frosh Tank Stars to Tangle With Stockton Friday
## 
### 
While the varsity swimmers draw a bye this week-end, their younger, |
record-smashing frosh brothers go into a heavy double hill. Friday after
noon they tangle with Stockton J. C. at 4 o'clock, and Saturday at 2:30
o'clock they meet Polytechnic High from San Francisco, who will bring
their sensational Bill Lucas who has his heart set on licking Paul Herron, !

Card frosh (lash. 4
It is no longer a matter of pre- I
diction, but of fact that by 5:30 j
o'clock Friday afternoon, the Stan- i
ford frosh will have annexed every .
U. S. Collegiate Freshman record '
for the 20-vard pool. Herron will !
lower the 60-yard and 440-yard free J
style marks, the only two which ,
have not already been broken by j
this team. Herron holds the 220, the j
100, the backstroke; Scott Dudley j
holds the 200-yard breast-stroke; i
and the team holds the medley relay ,
and the 400-yard free-style relay.
Possible threat of the Stockton
outfit is Fred Van Dyke, who is rated
as the best backstroker in the west,
and the big feature of the Poly High
meet is the presence of little Bill
Lucas, who is considered by San
Francisco supporters to be better
than Herron, or at least his equal.
The rest of the city team does not j
measure up to the standard of the !

! Card babes, and the meet will un
! doubtedly go to Stanford.
Both meets will be held in the En
j cina Pools and will be open to the
| public without admission charge.
