### 
Comes the biggest battle of the in- -
tramural hoop tournament to date
when Sigma Chi meets Zetes II in
the semi-finals at 7 o'clock in the
Pavilion tonight. The other sched
uled semi-final match should find
A.T.O. turning back Sequoia and
will not be so tight a tilt as the
first one.
The Zetes are the high-flying five
that held the team scoring record for
eight days at 104 points before the
A.T.O. quintet in turn broke it. In
Sharp Whitmore and Jim Groves,
the Zetes have two of the best point
getters in the tournament.
