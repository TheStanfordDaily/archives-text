# An Off-Campus Move
## 
### 
A LEVEL-HEADED group of students met in
the Nitery yesterday afternoon. It was
the new Steinbeck Committee, organized to
attack the migratory labor problem.
They didn't condemn the social and economic
system, although some of them may feel it is
fundamentally shot and that the migrant prob
lem is really only a symptom of capitalism's
impending doom.
They didn't set out to organize an employ
ment office for agricultural workers, although
maldistribution of workers to jobs is one angle
of the problem.
They didn't sail into the Associated Farmers,
although many of them undoubtedly believe
that organization is responsible for the acute
ness of the migrant problem in California, by
virtue of its come-to-California-and-get-a-job
propaganda sent to dust bowl victims.
Instead of going wild-eyed on any of these
subjects, they based their program largely on
practical, immediate aspects of the problem.
They planned to extend the recent successful
old clothes drive to other campuses up and
down the coast. They planned to extend the
Y.W.C.A.'s recreation project for children of
migrant families living at present in the San
Jose camp.
They did not, however, bury their noses in
these immediate considerations to the point
of overlooking long-range aspects of the prob
lem.
Realizing that Stanford students—character
istically a fortunate, complacent lot—don't even
know that there is such a thing as a migratory
labor problem, the Steinbeckers have incor
porated a comprehensive campaign of public
education in their program.
Trips to labor camps of the San Joaquin Val
ley are being scheduled—one of them tenta
tively for a week from Sunday. Forums will
be held on the campus. Speakers will be
asked to address student audiences on the
subject, one of these being Paul T. Taylor, pro
fessor of labor economics at the University of
California, who is recognized as one of the
country's foremost authorities on the migrant
situation.
With a level-headed, down-to-earth program
like this on tap, the Steinbeck Committee
should make at least a noticeable dent in the
California angle of one of the nation's funda
mental economic problems.—R. D.

like this on tap, the Steinbeck Committee
should make at least a noticeable dent in the
California angle of one of the nation's funda
mental economic problems.—R. D.
A LEVEL-HEADED group of students met in
the Nitery yesterday afternoon. It was
the new Steinbeck Committee, organized to
attack the migratory labor problem.
They didn't condemn the social and economic
system, although some of them may feel it is
fundamentally shot and that the migrant prob
lem is really only a symptom of capitalism's
impending doom.
They didn't set out to organize an employ
ment office for agricultural workers, although
maldistribution of workers to jobs is one angle
of the problem.
They didn't sail into the Associated Farmers,
although many of them undoubtedly believe
that organization is responsible for the acute
ness of the migrant problem in California, by
virtue of its come-to-California-and-get-a-job
propaganda sent to dust bowl victims.
Instead of going wild-eyed on any of these
subjects, they based their program largely on
practical, immediate aspects of the problem.
They planned to extend the recent successful
old clothes drive to other campuses up and
down the coast. They planned to extend the
Y.W.C.A.'s recreation project for children of
migrant families living at present in the San
Jose camp.
They did not, however, bury their noses in
these immediate considerations to the point
of overlooking long-range aspects of the prob
lem.
Realizing that Stanford students—character
istically a fortunate, complacent lot—don't even
know that there is such a thing as a migratory
labor problem, the Steinbeckers have incor
porated a comprehensive campaign of public
education in their program.
Trips to labor camps of the San Joaquin Val
ley are being scheduled—one of them tenta
tively for a week from Sunday. Forums will
be held on the campus. Speakers will be
asked to address student audiences on the
subject, one of these being Paul T. Taylor, pro
fessor of labor economics at the University of
California, who is recognized as one of the
country's foremost authorities on the migrant
situation.
With a level-headed, down-to-earth program
like this on tap, the Steinbeck Committee
should make at least a noticeable dent in the
California angle of one of the nation's funda
mental economic problems.—R. D.
