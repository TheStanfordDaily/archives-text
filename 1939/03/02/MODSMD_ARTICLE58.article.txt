# Lectures Coming Up
## 
### 
FROM here on out, it looks as though Stan
ford is going to have its own Lecture Series.
When Ex Committee looked over the results
of the Gunther address, found that it had made
approximately $75, instead of losing anything
near the $100 expected loss, it was pleased by
Stanford's response.
Acting promptly, the Committee decided to
sponsor a lecture by Vincent Sheean, traveler,
author of the best-seller, "Personal History,"
novelist, journalist.
Scheduled the week before Peace Day, Mr.
Sheean's talk, more than probably on the Euro
pean situation, should give Stanford enough
background to whet interest in that subject.
And what's more important, if Sheean is re
ceived as was Gunther, it will be only a short
step to the Lecture Series Stanford has always
wanted but never had.
