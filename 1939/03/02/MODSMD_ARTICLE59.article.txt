# Now It's 1939
## 
### 
A YEAR ago, the Pavilion was packed al
most every Friday and Saturday night
to see the Laughing Boys win basketball games
for Stanford. Hank Luisetti was rolling up the
all-time scoring record, and alumni and City
papers were griping about the inadequacy of
a Pavilion that can seat only 3000.
The scene changes; it's 1939. This year, in
experienced men under <a new coach have not
produced a championship team. They play a
large percentage of their games before rows
of empty bleachers, without the student body
support that backed the miraculous '38 varsity.
Even though we did get two Zonnes, the
Luisettis, Calderwoods, Lees, and Stoefens don't
come in packages, and Stanford can't expect
a miracle team every year.
Sports writers agree that we stand a good

chance to beat Cal in one of the games this
week-end. A Stanford victory will mean that
the Bears will lose their leadership in the
Southern Division.
All that is needed to complete this rosy pic
ture is a little support from the student body.
If the Berkeley game doesn't offer attraction
enough, a visit to Sally Rand's afterward
should make the trip worth while.
Everyone on the campus is going to celebrate
Boathouse Day, and although a discouragingly
low number of tickets has been sold, that
celebration should include attending the final
Cal tilt Saturday night.
But Stanford students are a little old to be
scolded and told what they should do. If they
don't want to go to the game, that's their busi
ness.
It's at 8 o'clock in the Pavilion next Saturday
night.
If Stanford loses, it may be due to Stanford's
lack of support. —L. L.
