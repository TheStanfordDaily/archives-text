# BULL SESSION
## THE 						BRATS GREW UP 
### JOHN COBBS 
¥>ACK in the days when I was a sophomore one of
the University's ranking problem children was
our local edition of the American Student Union. No
one ever knew exactly what the A.S.U. was; even its
members were a little vague on the subject. "We knew,
though, that it was a sort of catch-all activity, made up
of maladjusted exhibitionists who wanted an audience
for their shouting.
But even problem children grow up; and this year
I notice with some pleasure that the A.S.U has come
of age. For the past two quarters it has minded its
own business quietly, resisting the temptation to stand
up and shout, "Look at me!" Last night it proved its
maturity by sponsoring a critical discussion of com
munism.

Of course, in these sombre days a discussion of
communism is by itself evidence of nothing more than
a speaking knowledge of some language. But when
the A.S.U. sponsors critical comment on what used to
be its religion, we are safe in assuming that the or
ganization has discarded its philosophic rompers.
I remember that back in the old days no loyal mem
ber would mention Karl Marx without a genuflection.
Anyone who didn't agree was written off as a miser
able fool and forgotten. This sometimes made it dif
ficult for an AS.U. member to find anyone worth
talking to, but the inconvenience was offset by the
inflationary effect on the ego.
* * * *
AS FAR as my personal feelings are concerned, the
philosophy and politics of the A.S.U. arc like
somebody else's sweetheart. I don't care what they
look like.
But I have always objected to loud noises, either
real or figurative. And so like the rest of the campus
I thought in the old days that it would be better for
all of us if the A.S.U. membership were tied to a
heavy anchor and kicked overboard in deep water.
It is pleasing therefore to notice the new policy.
Instead of building its program around lung power, the
A.S.U. has introduced an element of headwork, and
the new arrangement is easier on all of us. The or
ganization has stopped agitating frantically and is
taking time out to decide what it wants to agitate
about.

The critical discussion of communism doesn't affect,
(he campus one way or another. For all we care, the
A.S.U. can be fascist, communistic, fcudalistic or any
thing it likes. What pleases us is that when an organi
zation stops for discussion, it is forced to quit shouting.

AS FAR as my personal feelings are concerned, the
philosophy and politics of the A.S.U. arc like
somebody else's sweetheart. I don't care what they
look like.
But I have always objected to loud noises, either
real or figurative. And so like the rest of the campus
I thought in the old days that it would be better for
all of us if the A.S.U. membership were tied to a
heavy anchor and kicked overboard in deep water.
It is pleasing therefore to notice the new policy.
Instead of building its program around lung power, the
A.S.U. has introduced an element of headwork, and
the new arrangement is easier on all of us. The or
ganization has stopped agitating frantically and is
taking time out to decide what it wants to agitate
about.

The critical discussion of communism doesn't affect,
(he campus one way or another. For all we care, the
A.S.U. can be fascist, communistic, fcudalistic or any
thing it likes. What pleases us is that when an organi
zation stops for discussion, it is forced to quit shouting.
¥>ACK in the days when I was a sophomore one of
the University's ranking problem children was
our local edition of the American Student Union. No
one ever knew exactly what the A.S.U. was; even its
members were a little vague on the subject. "We knew,
though, that it was a sort of catch-all activity, made up
of maladjusted exhibitionists who wanted an audience
for their shouting.
But even problem children grow up; and this year
I notice with some pleasure that the A.S.U has come
of age. For the past two quarters it has minded its
own business quietly, resisting the temptation to stand
up and shout, "Look at me!" Last night it proved its
maturity by sponsoring a critical discussion of com
munism.

Of course, in these sombre days a discussion of
communism is by itself evidence of nothing more than
a speaking knowledge of some language. But when
the A.S.U. sponsors critical comment on what used to
be its religion, we are safe in assuming that the or
ganization has discarded its philosophic rompers.
I remember that back in the old days no loyal mem
ber would mention Karl Marx without a genuflection.
Anyone who didn't agree was written off as a miser
able fool and forgotten. This sometimes made it dif
ficult for an AS.U. member to find anyone worth
talking to, but the inconvenience was offset by the
inflationary effect on the ego.
