SMART GUY
They say he's pretty smooth; the women do, at
least. They say they don't know how he can go to
Law School and still stay so smooth
Lately he has been gallantly devoting himself in
his idle moments to a Lagunita girl. The other day he
callcd her up or she called him up or something. It
was quite complicated, and the only thing I under
stand fully about it. was that there were at least three
girls in the phone booth at the time.
The girls were in a waggish mood. They thought it
would be very funny if one of them who was not
being dated by the guy should talk on the phono
I first; so one of thetn did. She talked for a while, and
then the other one talked.
From here on it gets complicated, let me tell you.
Then the girl who was supposed to get the call took
the phone. Only she said she was someone else. She
said she was young and beautiful and blond. She
gave quite an enthusiastic and phoney description of
herself.
The Law Student became interested.
"Ilmmmm," he said to himself.
Then, in what without a doubt was his smoothest
manner, he asked her for a date for that night.
Of course he already had a date with her for that
night, but how was ho to know?
"But. you already have a date tonight, haven't you?"
the girl asked.
"Oh. that's all right. I'll break it."
So the girl agreed 1o go on the date. She said she
would meet him in the Lagunita patio by the fountain.
She would have a small flower in her hair.
"Good."' the guy said, hung up, and called the
same girl back. Only he thought he was calling the
girl he had the first date with, the one he had been
going with.
I told you this gets complicated.
When he called her, he mumbled something about
an exam that, had just come up and you know how
Law Schol is and can we break that date. (The first
date, you understand).
"Of course," the girl said sweetly.
The guy was feeling very smooth.
He had that conquest look in his eye.
110 dressed carefully that night, and went over lo
the patio of Lagunita to wait for a girl to come out to
the fountain, wearing a small flower in her hair.
He waited there for nearly an hour. To the girls
in Lagunita he must have seemed very romantic and
sentimental, standing there at night alone by the
I fountain for an hour, and then quietly leaving . . .
I Cussing like hell.

SABOTAGE
The Lagunita matrons were in a mild uproar the
other night. Some guy on the phone asked for a girl
by her room number.
"That was a man's voice asking for a girl by her
, room number! he heard the woman at the telephone
say, aghast.
