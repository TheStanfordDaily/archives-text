# CAMPUS OPINION
## TRY HOLDING HANDS

The Editor, Sir:
Why, oh why, do the Stanford
'"roughs" when they go down to
Paly to the show have to do regular
setting-up exercises in 'their seats?
Why? I wonder. Don't they know
any better, or is it that virile power
which they cannot resist? Don't
they ever stop to think that some
one behind them might want to .see
the show—and can't because of their
swinging their arms around like a
wild man? (English a bit bad there
—see what you can do to doctor it
up!) Next time we people go down
to Paly, I hope to goodness that we
don't get stuck behind some wig
glipg (sp?) Rough!
Don't Pass This Up!
Gone Nuts, '39
