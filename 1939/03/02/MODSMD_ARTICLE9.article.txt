the subject upon which Theodore J.
Kreps, associate professor of busi
ness economics at Stanford, spoke
to yesterday's meeting of the Lunch
con Club.
"Population," he said, "can be
grouped arbitrarily into classifica
tions of those continually fighting
starvation; those continually fighting
poverty; the comfortable, and the
luxury middle classes; and the sav
ers. Eight million families in the
first classification have a total in
come from all sources of $750 a year
or under; only 800,000 families con
stitute the group of savers in income
brackets of over $5,000 a year.
"The 0,000,000 households receiv
ing public aid in some form come
under the starvation class. It is a
fallacy to say we have always had
such poverty; it has come on grad
ually since about 1875,"' said the
speaker. "Poverty such as that just
described is absolutely unnecessary
—as unnecessary as malaria or yel
low fever.
