### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
colossal nude forms of
Michelangelo's frescoed c"'ling
gazed down upon 62 canopied chairs
lined up against the walls of the
Sistine Chapel. Slowly a purple
robed cardinal made a circuit of the
room, receiving a ballot at. each
place. He brought them to a central
alter, where they were counted and
thrown into a blackened stove.
Against the purple of the twilight
.sky above the palace of the Vatican,
the immense crowd that jammed St.
Peters Square was waiting with its
eyes focused intently on a tiny
chimney, scarcely visible among the
confusion of domes and towers.
Then, at 5:30 o'clock, the ballots
were placed in the fire, a faint puff
of white smoke appeared, and the
crowd knew that a new Pope had
been elected.
# * *
The doors of the Chapei were
unlocked, and the prefect of papal
ceremonies was allowed to enter.
One by one he struck down the
canopies over the thrones of the
college of cardinals until only one
was left. Eugcnio Cardinal Pa
celli was elected the representa
tive of God on earth and the lead
er of the Catholic Church.
Simultaneously the results of the
third Papal balolt were made known
to the faithful waiting in the piazza
and to the world listening at its ra
dios. And varied were the reactions
to the word that the former Secre
tary of State to the Vatican will as
sume the throne of St. Peter as
Pius XII.

the new Pope is not exclu
sively a man of the Church, de
spite the declarations following the
death of Pius XI that a "pastor an
gel icus" would be selected. He is
the man who has long been known
as the guiding genius behind the
Catholic international policy, espe
cially its stand against the totali
tarian states, and his selection was
not unexpected.
Into an uneasy Europe, Pius
XII has been elected, a Europe
which is divided on the issue of
fascism versus democracy. It is
extremely probable that he will
assume a leading role in this po
litical struggle, for it is his duty
to guide his flock to peace, as well
as to salvation.

When the name of the new pon
tiff was announced yesterday, the
darkest spot on the map of Europe
was Nazi Germany. Here, where he
served for many years as papal
nuncio, the news brought wrinkled
brows, ominous thoughts that an
enemy of the Reich's policy will rule
the Church.
Cardinal Pacelli is an aggressive
man; when Hitler attacked the
Catholics in Germany, he was swiftr
and determined in retaliating. And
since that time relations between
Berlin and the Vatican have been
trembling.
As the devout Catholics of Italy
joined the democratic nations in
hailing the election of the new
Pope, the Na/.is saw in it only a
threat to their power and an
other reason for arming more men.

'pHERE is no fear that Pius XII
will tactlessly upset the peace
of Europe. Far from that, he is a
master diplomat who will succeed in
staving oil war, if anyone possibly
can. His knowledge of languages,
his keen understanding of interna
tional problems, his experience in
diplomatic affairs make him the best
qualified man in the Church to take
the lead in this time of peril.

Above all things, the new Pope
is supremely aware of the world
that is speeding on about him. of
the insane carnival of events that
is in progress outside the walls of
Vatican City. He has visited the
United States, as well as all the
nations of Europe and the Near
East; he has lunched with Presi
dent Roosevelt and blessed the
San Francisco Bay Bridge.
