# Perfume Scents Suit All Types, Moods
## 
### 
Types of spring perfumes will
vavy as much as the new spring
clothes and there are scents for ev -
ery occasion being featured by all
the stores.
Elizabeth Arden's "Blue Grass"
brings to mind a southern belle and
would be perfect with the new girl
ish chiffon formals or full skirted
afternoon dresses.
For the glamorous note, Shanghai
by Lentheric is a headliner, with
Bellogia by Caron a close second.
Shocking by Schiaparelli and Lu

cien Le Long's Impromptu are ideal
to create a romantic mood.
Gemey of Richard Hudnut and
L'Aimant by Coty are on the
"sweet" side and complete the fem
inine tendency found in clothes.
Ciro's Chevalier De La Nuit is for
the vivacious girl to cope with its
definite spicy flavor. Tweed by
Lentheric is still the most popular
perfume for sport clothes.
The main idea is to be subtle with
a scent that is suited to your type
and to the occasion.
