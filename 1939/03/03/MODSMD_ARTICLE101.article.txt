# Spring Inspires New Gewgaws
## Boas and Key Chains Win First Choice 
### 
"Gewgaw" is a convenient term
that covers anything from boas on
women's hats to the key chains which
are so popular with the these
days.
These new boas seemed to have
been inspired by the froufrous on
the Tyrolean hats of the skiiers, and
are little feathery balls which put
a final touch to that new sport hat.
They are inexpensive, and may be
changed to tie together the color
scheme of an outfit.
A new pigskin coin purse is also
new on the market, and it is the
kind that opens and keeps your
small change from falling all over
the floor. This new and clever idea
is a time- not to mention money
saver.
Another idea which is not new,
but very practical and rapidly gain
ing popularity, is the short with
your initials on them. These not
only keep your feet warm, but they
also make them look smaller.
Those new formal pocket watches
in smooth pigskin cases are also
mighty handy for men. They elimi
nate fighting with stiff cuffs to see
if you will make a 2:30, and they are
wound automatically by opening
and closing the case.
A final "gewgaw" which may be
used to accent the perfection of
those curls on milady's head are
tiny colored bows to match her
sport clothes or sequin and velvet
flowers for evening. With spring
there are also fresh flowers available,
and they do give that final feminine
touch on most any occasion.
