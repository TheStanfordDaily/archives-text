# Little Suits' to be New Spring Mode
## 
### 
Typical of 1939 Spring street
clothes will be those "little suits"
that American college girls love, and
typical of these "little suits" will be
a dress of tobacco wool with a
checked jacket. Always checks and
stripes will be contrasted with plain
wools and butterfly weaves.
For instance, a violet striped
tweed topcoat will be worn over a
plain wool jacket suit, and a gray
and yellow checked suit will be worn
under a plain coat.
The ever popular reefer coat us
ually with seven buttons will give
all new styles strong competition.
Red calf shoes and bag are the gray
reefer's accessories.
NEW COLORS
Popular in all the magazine uds is
a bland little gray flannel suit with a
tight buttoned jacket, gored skirt,
and flattering white pique collar.
The onslaught of cyclamen and
lilac shades will pervade street
clothes, though perhaps not as much
as it will more formal wear. Suits
will come in all pastels, but nothing
will push springtime's perennial navy
and white into the background. The
combination will stripe the wool
suits, while in sheers, the dress of
navy will be brightened up with new
touches of crisp white.
Street hats will be traditional;
reefers and bretons and turbans. But
they are not the only toppers which
will be seen on the streets; already
the silly little bonnets that are strik
ing with black, and popular too, with
prints and many colored ensembles
have appeared amid the headgear
formerly considered appropriate for

strcetwear.
Just so it's a suit, ail sorts of vari
ations may be expected for street
wear. In general, jackets will be
longer, but not to the exclusion o*
the shorter military styles and bo
leros.
REEFERS GOOI)
The reefer suit, always stylish, will
lead all the other three-quarter
length coat suits. These longer coats
will figure chiefly, however, in three
piece suits.
"Sculnture" is a new
and will be found in a formal beige
suit with a molaed
skirt pleated only in its last 12 inches,
as well as a black tweed coat which
the sponsors call "swing-sculpture."

Street hats will be traditional;
reefers and bretons and turbans. But
they are not the only toppers which
will be seen on the streets; already
the silly little bonnets that are strik
ing with black, and popular too, with
prints and many colored ensembles
have appeared amid the headgear
formerly considered appropriate for

strcetwear.
Just so it's a suit, ail sorts of vari
ations may be expected for street
wear. In general, jackets will be
longer, but not to the exclusion o*
the shorter military styles and bo
leros.
REEFERS GOOI)
The reefer suit, always stylish, will
lead all the other three-quarter
length coat suits. These longer coats
will figure chiefly, however, in three
piece suits.
"Sculnture" is a new
and will be found in a formal beige
suit with a molaed
skirt pleated only in its last 12 inches,
as well as a black tweed coat which
the sponsors call "swing-sculpture."
Typical of 1939 Spring street
clothes will be those "little suits"
that American college girls love, and
typical of these "little suits" will be
a dress of tobacco wool with a
checked jacket. Always checks and
stripes will be contrasted with plain
wools and butterfly weaves.
For instance, a violet striped
tweed topcoat will be worn over a
plain wool jacket suit, and a gray
and yellow checked suit will be worn
under a plain coat.
The ever popular reefer coat us
ually with seven buttons will give
all new styles strong competition.
Red calf shoes and bag are the gray
reefer's accessories.
NEW COLORS
Popular in all the magazine uds is
a bland little gray flannel suit with a
tight buttoned jacket, gored skirt,
and flattering white pique collar.
The onslaught of cyclamen and
lilac shades will pervade street
clothes, though perhaps not as much
as it will more formal wear. Suits
will come in all pastels, but nothing
will push springtime's perennial navy
and white into the background. The
combination will stripe the wool
suits, while in sheers, the dress of
navy will be brightened up with new
touches of crisp white.
