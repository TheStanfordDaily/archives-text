# Paris Dictates Glamor, Not Simplicity
## Make-up Styles Tend Toward Bright Eyes, Off-color Lipsticks 
### 
If you follow the style dictates
from Paris discard the old idea that
men prefer the simple type of girl!
If you let your lips curve in their
natural lines, and leave your nails
untouched by polish you'll lose your
man. Next time a glamor girl with
tinted hair, bright make-up, and
colored nails walks by, watch him
turn around to follow her with ad
miring eyes.
Men do like colors. They do want
feminine charm th;it is emphasized
by proper make-up. Even if it is
blight nail polish that is needed to
give you that certain "umph," wear
it. Try out all the latest lipsticks,
hair styles, and new off-colors.
Eyes are often the most noticed
feature on a woman's face. Frame
your eyes so that all their beauty
is brought forth. The best treatment
is brushing both brows and lashes
daily. A thin layer of eyelash paste
or oil will often do much to glamor
ize your eyes. Artificial lashes are
even being successfully used today.
HAIR SHORT
Cut your hair in short lengths. The
best results with the newest hair
dos can be achieved only with short
hair. Instead of superfluous orna
ments, wear fresh flowers for your
crowning glory. It is easy to fix a
combination that will match your
spring print.
Try for a shiny finish on lipstick.
One beauty secret for this effect is
the application of vaseline, lipstick,
and vaseline again. Louis Phillippe,
that old-reliable, has put out an in
triguing new shade called "Formal
Red." It matches every color, and
is good for either day or night-time
wear. It also hits close to that shiny
surface effect.
There is a rouge on the market,
too, that is applied by brush and
leaves the skin glossy. A new ad
junct to lipstick is the invention of
a pinkish toothpaste that tints the
gums so that they blend in with
your lipstick when you smile. Pink
and white is the keynote for this
season's make-up. It works in a new
freshness with the vibrant colors now
featured. -
SLEEP MAKE-UP BASE
Sleep is the best answer to a make
up base. If a little help is still needed
in the morning, there are refreshing
astringents that serve as excellent
powder bases too. Evening in Paris
has produced a new creamy liquid
cleanser called "Evening in Paris
Trio-Lotion." It. not only cleans, but
softens and furnishes a good base.
The use of facial mascjues is en
couraged. If properly used, they
can be of great benefit. There arc
four divisions of masques. First of
all, the salon masques that are ap
plied in beauty parlors. Then there
are three types that can be success
fully used at home. The pore mas
que is effective in closing enlarged
pores, or dislodging blackheads and
other blemishes.
The circulation masque Is used
best on dull, shallow skin for stim
ulating color and life. The mbst
practical masque is the pick-up type
which gives temporary charm to a
tired face and is good for use after
a hard day when you wish to look
your best for an important evening
date.
Investigate a few of the current
beauty tips, and look your loveliest
this spring.
