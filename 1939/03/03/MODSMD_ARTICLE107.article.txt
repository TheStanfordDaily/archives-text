# Ski Fashions Vary Little for Spring
## 
### 
You may ihink Spring is here; it
is, but not. in the mountains. And
while some are basking in the sun
shine, others arc sailing smoothly
over the snow, or falling in it. Gab
ardine trousers are worn all season |
in the snow, but the colors get
lighter as the days get longer.
Light blues and greys have the
field, but. shirts and jackets are all 1
colors. Bright plaid shirts are worn j
;ill along. Sweaters of any color 1
from peacock blue to red and white
stripes lok quite professional. Long
sleeves help if you burn easily.
Headgear is varied. Knitted stock
ing caps, bandanas, or earmuffs or
turbans. Light tan spats over a
heavy ski-boot look neat and are
useful for keeping the snow out,
but tliev are not essential.
