# Junior Excom Votes Against Joint Dance
## 
### 
Deciding that they were not in
favor of sharing a prom date with
the senior class, junior excom voted
unanimously last night to submit to
Excom the decision as to whether
i the seniors should be permitted to
plan a joint dance with the juniors
April 14. the date already granted
, by Excom for the Junior Prom.
!
The reasons given were that the
members believed that a joint dance
would draw no larger crowds and
I consequently would make no more
money than the prom already
. planned, and that consequently it
would be disadvantageous to split
| the profits, according to Ken Cuth
i bertson, junior president,
i "However, if Excom says we must
join the seniors," Cuthbertson added,
I ''we will ask for favorable financial
' terms."
Possible orchestras for the Junior
Prom also were discussed. Cuthbert-
I son said that the only "name" band
( that would be available for the 14th
j would be Buddy Rogers. There was
"slight" possibility that Artie Shaw
would be available, but it was
thought too slim to warrant discus
sion.
