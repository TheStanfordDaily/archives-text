# Corsage Innovations Replace Old Classics
## 
### HARRY PRESS 
The traditional rose or the garde
j nia of mother's time will no longer
i suit the modern Little Nell. Today
j corsages have a new bent toward
such flowers as daffodils, which
strangely enough make just a pret
ty and a much lighter corsage than
the familiar gardenia.
Carnations also make very effec
tive corsages. Try them in an extra
long string that will hang down the
back of her dress as well as in front.
Old fashion bouquets have stead
ily been returning to popularity
this season, and have become espe
cially successful for formal wear.
They can be made in wristlets, neck
pieces, or in rather fan shaped piec
es to be worn at. the center of the
waist.
