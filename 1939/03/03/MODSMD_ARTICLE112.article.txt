# Headgear Must be Giddy; But Must Become Milady
## 
### 
"Anything Goes" is still the motto
of Parisian millniers this spring, but
even the men will have to admit
that hats are fast losing the utter
idiocy that characterized them a sea
so or so ago. This year milady may
make her headgear just as giddy or
bizarre as .she chooses, but the ex
tremely feminine or frankly practi
cal chapeau is equally chic and will
be seen just as often.
Fashion's number one "don't" is
"Stay away from anything that looks
out-of-place in its surroundings or
on you, and by no means wear the
extreme models unless you know
you can get away with them." Hats
may be of any size, shape, and ma
terial, and the prime consideration
is, as it always should be, to suit
them to the occasion, the costume,
and the personality.
Sailors and casual felts are as pop
ular as ever and can be had in any
design from conservative to ultra
radical. Brims are wide or narrow,
and one may have any degree of
slant that is becoming. The new
higher crowns are increasingly
popular on sport and street hats.
TURBANS AND TOQUES
For more dressy occasions tur
bans, toques, and pill-boxes pre
dominate, but large, flattering brims
are by no means passe. For those
who can wear it, the off-the-face
hat. is very becoming and ultra
fashionable.
As far as materials are concerned,
straws and soft felts predominate,
but velvet, pique, and almost any
other spring material is often used.
There are even occasional hats made
entirely of feathers, fur, or flowers.
Veils are practically a "must" on
all but the most informal models.
They may simply encircle the crown
or drop only to the nose or chin, but
the tendency is toward yards and
yards around the neck and over the
shoulders. They range all the way
from tiny mesh to the fish-net va
riety, and many are starched so that
they stand out stiffly behind or give
a perky lift to the crown. Some of
the most charming are delicately
embroidered or dotted with tiny
puffs of chenille.
TRIMMING VARIED
Trimmings are varied, but spring
designs lean toward feathers and
flowers. Ostrich plumes, especially
in pink and black, pop up every
where on dressy hats. The entire
flower garden is in vogue this year
and both the true-to-nature and
modernistic varieties find equal
favor.
Designers are very concerned with
getting rid of the old elastic for
holding milady's chapeau in place,
and some of the ideas are not only
ingenious but charmingly decora

live as well. Several varieties of
plain or jewelled combs work like a
charm and are just as lovely as they
are practical. Snoods are still quite
the thing, and this same idea some
times carries over into tiny skull
caps that fit the back of the head
and keep the hat under control.
The most ingenious method is a
double brim that opens up in back
and clings to the head like a beret.
