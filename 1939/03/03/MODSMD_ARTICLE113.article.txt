# 'Up-trend' Replaced By Baby Hair-cut
## 
### 
"Up" hair style is on the wane;
the "baby hair wave" is coming into
the spotlight. Mora and more Stan
ford women are asking for the "baby
hair cut," according to Palo Alto
beauty salons.
For this new style the hair is cut
to about three inches all over the
head. The hair is then waved or
put in small curls. Some have this
new hair cut with the hair done in
a modified up-sweep in the back.
Since the end of the opera season
and the holidays, the "up" hair style
has steadily been losing in popu
larity. The trend now is to shorter
hair, brushed up in the back in a
modified manner and waved off the
face.
