It is an established principle of I
our society that no man should com
ment on women's clothes without
first reading Emily Post and con- .
suiting a successful diplomat. Com- ,
pared to the perils and pitfalls that |
lie in a simple remark about the i
way a dress looks, an African jungle
complete with black mambas and
unfed tigers is as safe as a nursery.
If a man says he doesn't know
enough to comment, he is called
callous, self-centered, blind, and he
is left with the impression that to
remain in character he must club
the next baby he runs across. If his
remarks show a knowledge of the
subject, there are suspicious looks;
eyebrows arch like an irritated cat;
and somebody asks in a good imi
tation of a monk of the Inquisition
, how he got to know so much about
I women's clothes. Just to call a slip
I a slip instead of a "watdyueallit" is
enough to ruin a man's reputation.
"LOOKS GORGEOUS"
And so the wise male will stick to
that ancient remark, "It looks gor
i geous, my dear." This may sound
I a bit thin at times, but it is tested i
i and proved thoroughly safe. There
are no elusive connotations waiting
to spring when your back is turned,
no subtle shades of meaning that
may turn and snap at you. In short,
I this is a convenient trap-door that

provides escape from that dangerous t
question, "What do you think of it?"
Nevertheless, men do have ideas j
about women's clothes —vague ones
most of which come from reading j
the lingerie ads that talk about the
comforts of cross ventilation and)
vertical pull as opposed to air con
ditioning and lateral adjustment.
CHANGE QUICKLY
The one universal impression:
among men is that women's fash-1
ions change faster and more often'
than a politician's platform. One
year, skirts will be sweeping the
ground, and you are expected to give
a nasty look to the dancer who steps •
on them. The next they are half
way up to no-man's land, and you
are expected to give a nasty look i
to the man who looks too long at
them. During the last decade the
men waited with badly controlled I
nervousness to see what was going
to happen in women's clothes.
Skirts were going up; tops were i
going down. Logic indicated that if I
the trends continued sooner or later i
dresses would be reduced to belts,
and would then vanish completely.
But the tide turned and tops went
up and skirts went down. It was all
good entertainment, but it didn't
make for consistency,
FLUCTUATING STYLES
Outside of the observable fact
that styles fluctuate, men know little.
Most of them are in the position of
an outsider trying mightily to be
virtuous and not look in. What we

know wo know by hearsay, and any
man who can speak authoritatively
on women's clothes does not do so
in mixed company.
We know that women wear slips,
because that is what shows at the
bottom of their dresses. Lingerie ads
tell us that slips are garments some
thing like nightshirts which cover
most of what is under the dress.
Beneath the slips, we understand,
there may be any number of things
and again our advertisement educa
tion helps us out.
But beyond this we are ignorant.
And if we were not, we wouldn't
mention it. Regardless of what we
know, the only safe thing is to say,
"It looks gorgeous, my dear."
