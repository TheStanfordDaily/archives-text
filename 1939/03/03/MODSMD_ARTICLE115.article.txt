# Blend Quality Makes 'Jueltone, 3' Popular
## 
### 
"Jueltone, number " please." These
is the shade of nail-polish requested
most often for evening wear by
Stanford women, according to Palo
Alto Beauty Shops.
The reason for the popularity of
this color is that it will go with the
new fuschia shade. For campus wear
the lighter Jueltones, number 1 and
2, are most in demand. These have
a lot of lavender in them which
makes ihom adaptable to the spring
colors.
Because the liquid polish dries
their nails out, many girls simply
have their nails buffed with the
powder iorm of nail polish.
