# Paris Openings Offer History As Keynote
## Short Skirts Reflect 'Little Girl' Fashion 
### 
The prevailing (home at the
Paris openings this season is his
torical. There aie two main factions,
however, one side being influenced
by styles adapted from the French
colonies, such as Tunis, and the
other flitting from one period to an
other, producing a gay combination
of such types as Louis XVI, Direc
toire, and Victorian.
Whatever the period from which
the styles are drawn, milady this
season will look, more than ever like
a "jeune fille" by day and like a
j omantic heroine out of fiction by
) light.
Bodices will be tight, and skirts
will be short, the very shortest be
ing 17 inches from the floor.
Echiaparelli and Molyneux are two
t'esigners who refuse to conform to
this trend, as well as being the only
t no to ignore the popular navy blue
Jor spring.
LITTLE-GIRL LOOK
The little-girl look is an import
i nt note in the new fashions, with
basque dresses, piquant petticoats,
;nd embroidered lingerie blouses
contributing to that look of widc
t yed innocence that will be high
t yle in the coming season.
Modified versions of the "up" hair
s yle are being worn by manne
t uins, and the tiny doll hat still is a
1 ishion leader. In keeping with the
1 reneh Colonial theme, turbans are
also being shown, wtih yards and
j ards of veiling.
f.LIM, FULL SKIRTS
With nearly all the designers fea
t iring l ull-skit ted gowns, Moyneux
i ltroduces Directoire fashions as a
dramatic note.
In other words, this season is one
of varied styles, with the historical
theme predominant. However, you
can be sure that if you plan your
costume with the aid of a history
book, it will be perfect from the
joint of view of the fashion world.
