# Gardenias Lead In Corsage Sale
## 
### 
A corsage of toadstools is the most
rnusual one to have been requested
1 y a Stanford student, according to
l'alo Alto florists who get many
strange orders.
Gardenias rank first in popularity
of all corsages. Usually three large
Belmont gardenias are used for a
formal dance, but a single one is
more in demand for dancing in the
City. Orchids rank next with the
pale lavender ones being the most
popular of the different species. Two
1 easons were given for the prefer
ence of the gardenia over the orchid.
The first was that gardenias are les:>
expensive and the second, that gar
denias go with almost any color
dress the girl might be wearing.
In third place come roses and
sweet peas. Spring flowers, such as
daffodils and anemones, are next in
favor, but they are requested for
more informal occasions.
Pink and red camellias, because
of their soft, lovely texture, are
often used in making a corsage with
gardenias for a very special occasion.
French corsages are among the best
to order now. These are composed
of flowers of pastel colors with which
many lovely combinations can be
worked out.
For lock-out flowers, roses out
shine all others in popularity. An un
usual lock-out box is one composed
of a single calla lily with a large
red heart padlocked onto it.
