### 
The hosiery "four" cast for spring
includes the copper family, already
widely accepted; the neutral beiges
which blend with any and every one
of the spring colors, the golds bor
dering on the clear, cooler yellow
tints and the mauve cast, represent
ed as a special group of hosiery
shades which range in hue from
mauve to brick pink. are
perfect complements for the fuschia,
berry and pink shades.
There are no set ensemble rules
in the use of these groups, save in
that the shades should blend with
the costume and not be too over
powering or too conspicuous.
Hats from Paris this year lack the
comic motif entirely and instead are
veiled, flowered, and feathered—
some even being of papery cello
phane.
