# Spring Formals Accent Femininity To Advantage
## 
### 
Rally 'round (lit' call of spring! When the first crocuses appear, your
thoughts may turn to hiking, tennis, bicycles, and the perennial young
man fancy. But to dicker in that young man's fancy, Miss America can't
afford to neglect her wardrobe. And wardrobes, formals particularly, are
going to be especially important Ibis spring, because Ihis is Fair year.

The mood is gay, but not glittering.*
! The material is chiffon or lace. The
color is blonde, white, or mustard.
1 You see it's still a feminine world—
| as far as clothes are concerned at
least —and the best "tip" of the year
i is to accent femininity, even to the
j extent ol coyness.
As for other colors, you may mix
them in any manner that suits your
fancy—pink and green, orchid and
I yellow, or multi-colored. Even
brown and beige are in the lime
light.
If you are the feminine type, you
i might try a starched chiffon fichu
I at the throat, 01 a blonde tulle skirt
| jhirred onto a gold lame bodice,
i The Southern Belle of '61 had noth
, ng on us with our billowing skirts,
i n fact we are out-crinoline-ing her,
i iguratively speaking.
II you are a sophisticate, a narrow,
jractically hobble-skirt will till the
oill, or perhaps a new, oval decol
etage topped by a many-stranded
necklace. Bulky gold necklaces witl
nulti-colored stones are also fa
j /ored.
As for evening sweaters, one of
white chenille with gold paillettes
s ultra-smart. The bolero jacket
is still with us plus vertical pockets.
More hints: Long sleeves, skirts
lathered in the front, draw-string
necks, all take several curtain calls,
and we still see many strapless, hoop
ikirt formals.
Lace and chiffon take bows for
spring. Fish net comes out of the
j water to bedeck milady, and if mi
! lady is smart she will not neglect
i the tensile tops in stripes and bright
i prints, or turn up her nose at se
! quins. Even halter-tops, ribbons in
j abundance, and showing petticoats
I are not frowned upon.
There is an aura of glamour about
this season's formals, and it is our
| business to capture it. So, lassies,
be pretty or smart, be sentimental or
I sophisticated, go slim-skirted or full
skirted, low-necked or high-necked
I according to your type, and you'll
; find favor in that other fancy we've
I been talking about.

Rally 'round (lit' call of spring! When the first crocuses appear, your
thoughts may turn to hiking, tennis, bicycles, and the perennial young
man fancy. But to dicker in that young man's fancy, Miss America can't
afford to neglect her wardrobe. And wardrobes, formals particularly, are
going to be especially important Ibis spring, because Ihis is Fair year.

The mood is gay, but not glittering.*

1 You see it's still a feminine world—
| as far as clothes are concerned at
least —and the best "tip" of the year
i is to accent femininity, even to the
j extent ol coyness.
As for other colors, you may mix
them in any manner that suits your
fancy—pink and green, orchid and
I yellow, or multi-colored. Even
brown and beige are in the lime
light.
If you are the feminine type, you
i might try a starched chiffon fichu
I at the throat, 01 a blonde tulle skirt
| jhirred onto a gold lame bodice,
i The Southern Belle of '61 had noth
, ng on us with our billowing skirts,
i n fact we are out-crinoline-ing her,
i iguratively speaking.
II you are a sophisticate, a narrow,
jractically hobble-skirt will till the
oill, or perhaps a new, oval decol
etage topped by a many-stranded
necklace. Bulky gold necklaces witl
nulti-colored stones are also fa
j /ored.
As for evening sweaters, one of
white chenille with gold paillettes
s ultra-smart. The bolero jacket
is still with us plus vertical pockets.
More hints: Long sleeves, skirts
lathered in the front, draw-string
necks, all take several curtain calls,
and we still see many strapless, hoop
ikirt formals.
Lace and chiffon take bows for
spring. Fish net comes out of the
j water to bedeck milady, and if mi
! lady is smart she will not neglect
i the tensile tops in stripes and bright
i prints, or turn up her nose at se
! quins. Even halter-tops, ribbons in
j abundance, and showing petticoats
I are not frowned upon.
There is an aura of glamour about
this season's formals, and it is our
| business to capture it. So, lassies,
be pretty or smart, be sentimental or
I sophisticated, go slim-skirted or full
skirted, low-necked or high-necked
I according to your type, and you'll
; find favor in that other fancy we've
I been talking about.
