# Can Farm Take Freak Styles?
## 
### MARGE HOVEY 
Exposed waists! That's the latest
news from Paris on women's spring |
fashions. Can't you see Stanford
women sauntering along the Quad in
brassiere and skirt dresses —shock-
ing the complacent roughs out ol |
their jeans?
Bui according to the foreign style
experts the exposed midriffs will be
seen in about all clothes oxcept
street dresses. Formals in this style ,
have been worn for several months |
now and bathing suits lor several i
years, so it seems natural thai sport 1
clothes would be the next step.
We can hardly believe, though, i
that the modest young things of St. !
Anford would ever adopt such an
extreme "i.yle. You can usually count
on Stanford to turn down such ex
treme fads.
"UP-iiAiir 11 ors
"Up-hair," that was such a rage in
other places, nuide no headway at
all on the Farm. The complicated
curls were just too much to bother j
with when one was trying to make j
an eight o'clock. Picture the Quad if j
the style had been adopted—women j
in sporty sweaters and skirts with j
their hair looking as if they were J
ready for a bath. But the girls are
putting their hair up for Jonnals.
So far, hoop skirts haven't come
into complete favor with the 1100, i
but the Junior Prom or its equivalent j
may tell a different story. Although !
this is a very picturesque style, it !
isn't very practical. Try dancing j
cheek to cheek with a girl in a huge i
hoop skirt. Men will prefer hobble
skirts.

And these new hats. A big hunk
of fur tied on with leathers is very
chic, says Paris, but do they really i
sell them? It will be a tine state of
affairs when you try and watch a
football game over a stuffed owl on
some girl's hat. It's hard enough to j
dodge those footlong feathers. And j
as if that weren't enough, someone I
who must secretly sell feathers is j
advising them for evening head- !
dresses.
So don't be surprised, when call- :
ing for your girl to go to the Junior
Prom, you find her wearing a strap- |
less brassier top and a hoop skirt j
eight feet in diameter. You may j
find her hair pinned up to the top j
of her head, or curled about an inch j
long all over her noggin, topped off'
with a stuffed canary bird. But we'll ;
hope it can't happen here.

"Up-hair," that was such a rage in
other places, nuide no headway at
all on the Farm. The complicated
curls were just too much to bother j
with when one was trying to make j
an eight o'clock. Picture the Quad if j
the style had been adopted—women j
in sporty sweaters and skirts with j
their hair looking as if they were J

putting their hair up for Jonnals.
So far, hoop skirts haven't come

may tell a different story. Although !
this is a very picturesque style, it !
isn't very practical. Try dancing j
cheek to cheek with a girl in a huge i
hoop skirt. Men will prefer hobble

And these new hats. A big hunk
of fur tied on with leathers is very
chic, says Paris, but do they really i
sell them? It will be a tine state of
affairs when you try and watch a
football game over a stuffed owl on
some girl's hat. It's hard enough to j
dodge those footlong feathers. And j
as if that weren't enough, someone I
who must secretly sell feathers is j
advising them for evening head- !
dresses.
So don't be surprised, when call- :
ing for your girl to go to the Junior
Prom, you find her wearing a strap- |
less brassier top and a hoop skirt j
eight feet in diameter. You may j
find her hair pinned up to the top j
of her head, or curled about an inch j
long all over her noggin, topped off'
with a stuffed canary bird. But we'll ;
hope it can't happen here.
Exposed waists! That's the latest

brassiere and skirt dresses —shock-
