# Play Suits Accent Dirndl Skirts
## 
### 
Play suits also accent dirndl skirts
in cotton and the three-color idea in
sharkskin lumberjack blouse in
lime; shorts in brick and skirt in
royal.
Emphasis is placed on the four
piece flannel classic composed of
shirt, jacket, gored skirt and slacks.
Slacks are highly thought of, much
variety given the tops, including
cummer-bund and striped shirt,
print butcher-boy jacket and em
broidered basque jacket.
