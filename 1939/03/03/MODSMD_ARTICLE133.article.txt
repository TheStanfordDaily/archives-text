# Renovated Closets Cut Cleaning Bills, Give Clothes New Lease On Life

### JEAN HALLIBURTON 
As far as the public is concerned,
! clothes are only important when they
: are being worn. But to a maidless,
I valetless campus the care of these
clothes when they are not being worn j
j is a prime consideration. And, since
the most, important receptacle for
their mure static condition is the '
i closet, it should occupy a great deal
1 of the limelight in the private lile
of a college wardrobe.
Too often, alas, it is only on inci
dent, and we hear talcs of desks,
chairs, and tables becoming the main
repository for all sorts of apparel
(of course, this is not so predomir.. n.
in the living habits of the female).;

liul a little time and effort can pro
duce a closet that is truly a beauti
;ul thing.
Of course, when the basic premise

i thangers, which in their turn usu
ly support the articles ol apparel,
ilv.: place in which the rod is hung
.cupies the first attention. This
j'jvio • ij depends upon the shape

here is any. shape.

rod, there's no reason to waste it—
ten ci nts will buy a heavy wire
bracket t lint can l:c attached to the
back wall and will hold hangers
with coats, jackets, formats, or any
thing that dues noi have everyday
wear.

Tie racks have an obvious service
for the men, but they also make

college women have to keep their

there be any available closet space,
there are very nice brackets for hats,
