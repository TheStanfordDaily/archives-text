# Cords Stood Up Alone When Roughs were Men'
## 
### WILLIE CANNON 
Today the masculinc members of the campus elite drive Cords. Yes
ter-year tlicy wore them.
The Stanford woman <if \'i!) may peer villi dismay at the sartorial
disarray of her modern escort. Long ago. when the Rough was in his
prime, a member of the down-trodden five-hundred was lucky to fir.d

a passable date among the cords and«
sweatshirts that clutlercd up the i
Quad.
The masculine fashion plate in the
early days of the Farm whs shaggy,!
but comfortable, in straggling shirts
and cords that like their owners,
had reached their prime.
Slacks that had not been through
hell-week at least, twice, and that
could not. survive the "stand in the
corner alone" test, branded their
wearer as a member of the queerish
clan that sought book-larnin' as a
goal. The proudest, and the rough
est, of the Roughs, were those who
could not bend in the middle with
out cracking the corduroy.
TROUSERS TURNED CP
Ye Palyc Men's Shoppes early
learned the futility of attempting to j
persuade ye studente to buy trousers
whose legs ended permanently in the
general locality of the ground. Cam
pus trends dictated" firmly, and the j
male trouser terminated in a turn- j
up cuff ending midway between the
knee and the ankle.
Belts were worn only by machine j
pulleys, acocrding to the Stanford
Rough's Dictionary, whereby each
male cut himself a slice of curtain
cord, tied it around the cords of his
own accord, and sot some sort of
men's fashion record.
More conscientious dressers solved
the hold-up problem by fastening
two or more ties through belt-loops,
and hitching them firmly over one
shoulder.
EX-WUITE SOCKS
Nor did the ensemble's unique
harmony end above the ankles.
Shank? were hidden from view by
ex-white cotton gym socks, while
shoes as sole-less as a golfball cov
ered the pedal extremities. Often
as not, Ihe shoes were as mate-less
as the Statue of Liberty.
The popular variety of pigskin
protectors was a tan-and-white stock
model, but grass stains and tobacco
juice soon made over the color
scheme into a panorama of pulchri
tude. When the need of a shine was
felt, another chaw was inserted.
The greatest pride and joy of the
Rough's tender lile was the scrubble
of beard that be-mossed his chin.
Razor blades were used only to cut
classes, while the electric razor was
just, a twinkle in the eyes of Schick,
Packard, el al
ROUGH VS. SMITH BROS.
The beard that could stand alone
was the campus high spot. Sales
in hair tonics and creams hit a new
peak with each current crop of
frosh.
hTe test of first order Rough-hood
was a growth that could make the
cough-drop Smith Bros, scurry for
the mattress-stuffing shop.
The crowning glory of the day was
the senior stetson. Eleven gallons of
hat, shellacked and battered until
it reached a point where its surface
tension was equal to a brick-bat.
The man who could wear this big
brother to the "dink" for more than
fifteen minutes on end, was auto
matically elected to the Beltramo's
Athletic Club.
A far social cry from this older
brother, the masculine Farm denizen
of today, is still not above reproach
in the eyes of the non-paying sex.
Perhaps the (r) evolution of the
Rough is not yet complete.

pulleys, acocrding to the Stanford
Rough's Dictionary, whereby each
male cut himself a slice of curtain
cord, tied it around the cords of his
own accord, and sot some sort of
men's fashion record.

the hold-up problem by fastening
two or more ties through belt-loops,

protectors was a tan-and-white stock
model, but grass stains and tobacco

The greatest pride and joy of the
