# Roughs Favor Slacks For Fair
## 
### 
That approved garb for the Fair j
this spring consists of sports coats i
with contrasting slacks and com- (
fortable shoes should be good news
to every Stanford rough. Conserva- i
tive hats also find favor for wear- j
ing to the city or to the Fair.
But pork-pie hats are absolutely
out.
From all indications, herringbone
seems to be on the way out also, j
and the latest innovation is a worsted j
sport coat with a small pattern in
the material. Plain backs are the
only thing this season, the expertc
say, and raglan overcoats are coming j
in strong.
A self-respecting Stanford man j
can now be seen in green trousers!
or a green coat without provoking j
even a passing stare. Previously re- ;
garded as something essentially j
"loud'' or "Los Angeles," more color- |
ful masculine attire is to be con- j
sidered quite appropriate this spring,
according to reports.
Smooth for Spring Quarter are I
camel's hair sport coats, but they're I
awfully, awfully expensive. Beige ;
gabardine sport coats, however, also J
promise to prove a great favorite |
among the men students.
From the looks of Lagunita and j
the new boathouse, however, the |
most common male attire of the sea- |
son bids fair to consist of little else j
besides a pair of swimming trunks ,
and a healthy sun-tan.
