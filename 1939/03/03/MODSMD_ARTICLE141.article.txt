The tradition of no bobby socks
on Quad is becoming seasonal. Al
though summer quarter students
have ignored it for several years,
regular students are more timid
about appearing in socks during
spring quarter.
But each year more women de
cide to save half their stocking al
lowance by donning bobby socks,
and thereby avoiding the runs caus
ed by splintering furniture on
Quad.
Besides shades beginning with
cyclamen and paling on down, all
the good old blue, green, and yellow
socks will trip along inside of cam
pus saddle shoes.
