# Casrot Preparation Cuts Facial Tension
## 
### 
Essence of carrot, of all things, is
being used extensively this spring
in the facial preparations Dalma is
getting out.
The idea is that the modern
woman has so much "facial tension"
that cosmetics cannot get into the
skin and do their work of soothing
and tuning-up. Carotone, as the
unique yet workaday ingredient is
called, is aimed at reducing facial
tension and helping cosmetics make
the skin soft and smooth.
