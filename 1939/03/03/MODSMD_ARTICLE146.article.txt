# Waterless Shampoo Stops Spring Colds
## 
### 
Soap and water shampoos are not
on their way oul by any means, but
Ihey aren't too convenient when a
girl is traveling or is trying to get
over one of these spring colds.
Filling this exigency is the new
Jordeau waterless shampoo. Rub
bed vigorously into the scalp, it
lathers up in a hurry.
