. . and don't lorget to keep an j
extra hankie in your pocket all the i
time, dear. ;<;id be sure to have your
.shoes shined and pants pressed
and ..."
"Yes, Mother. B'bye. I'll write
ol'ten." 'lias we see the familiar
background for the Rough as he
left home suitcase in hand and
ovei flowing with obedience.
The transformation begins as he
places his first wayward foot on
board the train or what have you
and starts to squirm and twitch
under a starched shirt, and scratchy
suit pants. By the end of the first
50 miles the tie is usually out of
sight and the vest hidden under a
well-thumbed Whix Bang which has
been discarded for a little livelier
number with lots of pictures. Tie
and vest are now little articles of
ceremony that come out only for
Sunday chapel dates and Quad
pictures.
ENCINA TRANSFORMATION
Encina only serves to bring him
out in blue jeans, hickory shirts,
and moccasins and ... a real
"farm" haircut. The Rough is firmly
convinced that outside ol the Stan
ford Hill this bliss is the nearest
ne'll be to heaven. But wait. Who
said that? A formal dance. Never."
Yes, he knew her, some queen.
Well, perhaps but only to help out
a room-mate.
"Whadda yuh starin' at? Yes, it's
a tux Wha's it look like, a ciga
rette ad? Just 'cause you're not
smooth . . Snap! "There goes
that collar button again." Rrr-i-p!"
â€”and Mose said this material would
, wear like iron! Aww, what th' hell!
j I'm going like this! I don't care
I what they say." Slam!!!
FACING THE FAMILY
Christmas was coming and the
j goose was getting lat, so our frosh
' bought himself a hat . . . and
boarded the train with a swagger
practiced especially for the belles
|of the home town. But who of the
| local talent was to recognize this
| Lucius Beebe from the Farm with
his tell-tale gabardines, striped
I shirt, and cordovan shoes?
A new note from Paris is a fui
scarf with one blue fox pelt and one
j beige fox pelt joined in back.
