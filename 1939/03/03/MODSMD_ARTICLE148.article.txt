# Hankies Must Do Double Duty
## 
### 
"Hankies" these days are to Ih v found in all sizes, colors and kinds.
Both men and women have a wide field to choose from, hut there arc cer
tain favorites which arc seen oflcncst. The main one is while linen, which
is suitable for all occasions.
Those huge linen squares which have now taken the place of tiny but
terfly hankies are most popular with the women. They are not only color
iul, but best of all they are service-# -

able.
Women have hankies for all oc
casions. Everyday use comes first;:
and then there are those dainty little j
bits of lavender and lace which ;
are carried in evening bags just for
assurance.
There are also some lovely though
bothersome evening handkerchiefs in
georgette, lace, and crepe-de-chine
which give a swish effect while
dancing. They are very handy to
fiddle with between dances too if it
adds to your confidence.
Linen is the most popular material
for handkerchiefs, and those striking
hand-blocked ones are just the thing
for sport wear. They come in all
hues from just plain black and while
to red, white and blue. There are
aLso plain colors, embroidered, hem
stitched and stenciled patterns to
choose from.
Men do not fare as well in variety
for their handkerchiefs. They must
be content with cotton or linen with

colored borders or just plain white
ones. They do have the advantage,
however, of a good serviceable ar
ticle.
Hankies now must be serviceable
as well as attractive these days, for
with the advent of Kleenex they have
some strong competition.
