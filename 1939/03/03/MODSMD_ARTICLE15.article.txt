# New Structure To Continue Old Traditions
## Boat Club of 1903 Began Lake's Career As Farm Institution 
### 
When ancient beams in Stanford's
old boathouse collapsed under the
shifting weight of spectators and
performers at last spring's water car
nival, 25 years of coioriul history
were dumped into Lake Lagunita,
and it looked as though finis had
been written to a swell tradition.
But tomorrow, when Stanford cel
ebrates completion of a new boat
house, Stanford also may well be
celebrating the first of another 25
years on the lake.
Lake Lagunita first assumed
prominence as a center of campus
activity when, in 1903, a boat club
with a membership of about 50
students organized for the purpose
of putting Stanford crews into Pa
cific Coast competition.
LACK OF SUPPORT
Indifferent success of the crews
turned out, and consequent lack of
student support, brought about the
natural death of this idea. But the
tradition had beer* started.
In 1910, the women of the campus
got together and raised $350 to guar
antee the construction of the first
boathouse. The money was raised
chiefly by membership fees paid to
the boating club.
Row boats and sculls were in
stalled in the new building for the
use of club members.
INCREASED INTEREST
Increasing interest in the lake
brought eventual B.A.C. considera
tion. In 1913, the Board voted .$l,BOO
for construction of the wooden
building which served the Farm as a
boc.thouse for 25 years.
Facilities included barge and shell
racks, dressing and locker rooms for
crew men, and dressing rooms for
men swimmers. From that year,
Stanford's spring quarter was high
lighted by the lake, and informal
ooating and swimming steadily at
tained the status of a traditional
spring sport.
BOATHOUSE COLLAPSES
And then, on the celebration of its
25th birthday, the old boathouse fell
into the lake.
It was seen immediately that stu
dent interest would demand that an
other be built. Last fall, action was
taken by Ex Committee, The Daily
conducted a poll of the student body,
a contest decided the architecture of
the proposed building, and construc
tion was started in November.
Now, a new boathouse, low, white
and modern, rests on the site- of the
old structure.
