# Scarves Claimed To Be Versatile
## 
### 
Of all the accessories this season,
none is so versatile as the scarf.
Besides being a necessity to fill in
the neckline gap in suits and coats,
the scarf serves as a makeshift for
a hat. Yes, and even a wide girdle
a bo'.t. Long scarfs were shown
first this season, so long that they
could be draped or twisted turban
fashion about the head as cummer
bunds.
Color will keep things jumping
in this line. Here they arc: japonica,
chartreuse, cyclamen pink, cran
berry, purple, gold, and fuschia.
The long rule of the square scarf
has given way to the tailored suit.
Taffeta has come in this year with a
new delustered effect. Sheers come
in wool as well as chiffon.
