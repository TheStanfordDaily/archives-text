For 25 years, Stanford canoed from the floats of the "old" Boat
house (center right), but last Spring, tired and shabby, the old
structure prematurely gave way at the Junior Water Carnival (far
right). Not shown here is the intangible promotion that was nec
essary to promote construction of the new Stanford building.
Progressively, however, the new Boathouse this year began to
dominate Lagunita's shoreline as shown at center, until it ap
pears, shiny and new, as on the front cover. Inset at left, the fa
miliar water marker shows early in the year enough water in the
lake for the unofficial, but traditional, Spring Water Sports Pro
gram. Tomorrow, Stanford, delighted with its newest addition,
proudly dedicates the Boathouse, invites its traditional rival, the
University of California, to be its guest.
