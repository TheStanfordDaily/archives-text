# New Boathouse; Start to Finish
## Structure Results From Student Vote 
### 
Beginning a new chapter in the
history of Stanford's unofficial spring
water sports, in the early part of
October, 1938, Stanford voiccd its de
sire for a new Boathouse,
Tom ttillefer, student manager,
reported that the desire was finan
cially possible and the matter was
turned over to Ex Committee.
Excom put the question to a vote,
and, on October 14, received the
unanimous appeal of the campus for
a new Boathouse. That appeal was
the deciding factor, and Excom be
gan work the same day by offering
a prize for the best plans for the
boathouse submitted by student ar
chitects.
PLANS APPROVED
Moving swiftly, on Oct. 19 the Ex
com and the University came to an
agreement, and the final approval
for the proposed Boathouse was
given. Meanwhile, Dick Spencer,
an S.A.E.. submitted Â«the ultra-mod
ern prize-winning plans, and Excom
made final contracts with Charles
Wagner & Co., who promised to
complete construction within seven
weeks. An appropriation was made
for preliminary costs.
But how to get rid of the old boat
house. The building of the Big Game
Bonfire took care of that difficulty,
and the way was clear for the con
struction crew.
With construction under way, Ex
com began to consider a Boathouse
week-end. Their final decision pro
duced the chaos that will rule the
campus tomorrow.
CONSTRUCTION FINISHED
Work progressed on Schedule. On
January 31, with little more than a
few paint dabs needed to complete
construction, the Farm began to
worry. Lake Lagunita had not filled
as expected.
Then came the rains; nearly a
week of drizzle that rapidly filled
Lake Lagunita.
Feb. 15, Excom agreed with the
B.A.C. on maintenance of the Boat
bouse. A week later the building
received its final coat of paint, and
was immediately packed with sun
and swim lovers.
Tomorrow, the new Stanford Boat
house will be officially opened.
