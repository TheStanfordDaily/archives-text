# Hoop Spirit High for Cal Tilt Tonight
## Cards Want Revenge For Past Cal Wins; Don Burness Out 
### 
Minus Don Burness, sophomore
center, but plus a lot of the good
old college try, Stanford's basket
ball team winds up the 1939 season
tonight and tomorrow in the third
and fourth installments of the an
nual four-game series with Califor
nia.
Tonight the Cards travel to Ber
keley while tomorrow night Califor
nia concludes the season in the Pa
vilion.
The Cards have a perfect aver
age in their first two games with
Coach Nibs Price's Bears—two de
feats in two games, 45-29 and 43-25.
Neither of these games can be con
sidered in the close class, but never
theless the Indians are confident
that they can trounce the Bears at
least once this week-end.
Coach Everett Dean is certain the
Indians can win one of ihe games
if the Stanfords play as well as they
did against U.C.L.A. last week. In
the whole series the Indians sank
only two long shots, working the
ball in for close shots the rest of
the time.
The negative feature of the two
Pig Games played thus far has been
the Indians' inability to penetrate the
Bear defense, but Dean is a strategist
second to none and has been wear
ing pencils down to their stubs fig
uring out plays to halt the Bears.
This series has one aspect about it
that perhaps is unparalleled in re
cent sistory. For tonight and to
morrow Stanford will have the bless
ings of the U.S.C. Trojans riding on
their heads.
The Trojans are in second place
one game behind the Bears, and are
heavy favorites to whip U.C.L.A.
twice. Thus if the Indians can take
at least one game from the Bears,
the southern division championship
will have to be decided by a play
off.
With Burness almost definitely out
of tonight's tilt because he lacks even
one good knee to pivot on, Stanford
is far from in the best of physical
shape. Don Williams, who has risen
from B squad membership to a var
sity first string job, will take Bur
ness's center position.
Captain Phil Zonne and Harlan
Copsey will start at forward, and
Kenny Davidson and either Dick
Lyon or Bill Rapp at guard. Rapp is
back in shape after his ten-day lay
off due to a badly cut eye, and Dean
figures his power may be needed to
stem the Bears.
Rapp held Bill Ogilvie, Cal center,
to two field goals in the first Big
Game.
Price will start the same five men
who have formed his first string all
season—lvor Thomas, Captain Bob
Chalmers, Ogilvie, Bill Biggcrstaff
and Walt Bickerton.
