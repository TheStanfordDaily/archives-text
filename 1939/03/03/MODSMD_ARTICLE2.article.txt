# Hoop Spirit High for Cal Tilt Tonight
## Cards Want Revenge For Past Cal Wins; Don Burness Out 
### 
Minus Don Burness, sophomore
center, but plus a lot of the good
old college try, Stanford's basket
ball team winds up the 1939 season
tonight and tomorrow in the third
and fourth installments of the an
nual four-game series with Califor
nia.
Tonight the Cards travel to Ber
keley while tomorrow night Califor
nia concludes the season in the Pa
vilion.
The Cards have a perfect aver
age in their first two games with
Coach Nibs Price's Bears—two de
feats in two games, 45-29 and 43-25.
Neither of these games can be con
sidered in the close class, but never
theless the Indians are confident
that they can trounce the Bears at
least once this week-end.
Coach Everett Dean is certain the
Indians can win one of ihe games
if the Stanfords play as well as they
did against U.C.L.A. last week. In
the whole series the Indians sank
only two long shots, working the
ball in for close shots the rest of
the time.
The negative feature of the two
Pig Games played thus far has been
the Indians' inability to penetrate the
Bear defense, but Dean is a strategist
second to none and has been wear
ing pencils down to their stubs fig
uring out plays to halt the Bears.
This series has one aspect about it
