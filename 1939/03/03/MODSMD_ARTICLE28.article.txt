# Barrymore Stars in New Political Film
## 
### 
"Tin: GREAT MAN VOTES," cur
rently playing at the Fox-Stanford,
and featuring John Barryiiiore.
A philologist, John Barrymore
with Ph.D.'s and LL.D.'s from Har
\ard, goes wild on the screen with

his clever manipu
lation of the Eng
lish language in
"The Great Man
Votes," and the
audience likes it.
It's a big test for
philology and the
great Barrymore
comes through in
a masterful per
formance in which

he talks his way into the hearts of
the screen audience with his brilliant
and philosophical bits of wit. While
Barrymore lias many times shared
roles, he has probably never shared
them with a couple of "kids," Vir
ginia Weidler and Peter Holden.
Not only did the "great man" put
on a powerful performance involv
ing the English language and litera
ture, but his young co-stars put on
an equal exhibition of tongue-twist
ing. Their understanding of the
problems of the '"great man" was
particularly effective.
Political Science 1 has just finished
taking a parting slap at the whole
cockeyed business of politicians, the
Machine, and how the two work.
Well, this is one machine that has all
the earmarks of working until Hero
Barrymore crosses up Precinct 13.
He's supposed to "vote straignt" for
the incumbent mayor, and for that
he gets a commissioner of education
job, all's happy with the machine,
and no one actually knows—except
the audience—that in the end he
doesn't "vote straight."
"The Three Musketeers," featur
ing Don Ameehe and the Ritz
brothers, provides equal entertain
ment on the modern version of the
famous novel of Alexandre Dumas,
who must certainly have turned over
in his grave at the actually screwy
performance of the Ritz brothers.
As a sporting gesture, it's thumbs
up for both of them.

the audience—that in the end he
doesn't "vote straight."
"The Three Musketeers," featur

who must certainly have turned over
in his grave at the actually screwy
performance of the Ritz brothers.
As a sporting gesture, it's thumbs
up for both of them.
