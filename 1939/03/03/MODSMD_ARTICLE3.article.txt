# Collegiate Rodeo Opened to Farm
## 
### 
Plans for an intercollegiate rodeo,
something entirely new in scholas
tic circles, are at present being cir
culated, it was yesterday revealed,
throughout the majority of western
junior cologes, colleges, and univer
sities. Stanford students yesterday
were invited to join students from
other colleges either as spectators or
as participants.
The rodeo, entirely organized by
student groups, is to be held April 8,
at the C Bar G cattle ranch in Vic
torville, California. Men are to par
ticipate in bareback horse riding,
steer riding, calf roping, team rop
ing, and wild cow milking. The
women's events feature a polato race,
bareback and saddle race, needle
threading, and pipe races, and a
rescue race. No entry fees are to
be charged and cash prizes will be
awarded.
Interested students are requested
to get in touch with Miss Mary
Beach at Lagunita before the end of
today.
