### 
Where Stanford's basketball var
sity has been unsuccessful to date—
in defeating Cal's Golden Bears—the
Farm's frosh hoopsters will attempt
to atone this week-end when the
Papooses vie with the BearcUbs Fri
day at Berkeley, Saturday here.
Overwhelming victors, 36-24, in
the first game of the yearly grudge
series, the Card yearlings will be
after at least one triumph to sew up
their second major sport triumph
over their Bay rivals. Twin victories
would stretch Stanford's winning
streak to 12 games, a streak which
was started after a trimming handed

last month.
Bob Penn, high scoring forward
v. ho leads the Papooses with 163
points to date, and Bill Cowden,
riinner-up with 103 points at guard
and center posts, will be the key
men in Coach H. B. Lee's outfit.
