### 
FOR the first time in lour years
Stanford is approaching the last two
basketball games against California
without a championship in sight.
All the Indians can do by breaking
even with the league-leading Bears
will be to give U.S.C. one more
chance at the conference flag. Those
tall, often clumsy Bears have sur
prised the Coast with their steady
improvement. Either Nibs Price is
one of the best coaches in the game
or the old story about good big men,
etc., still rings true.
Somehow or other we are inclined
to credit most of California's victories
to Price himself. The way he pol
ished up the rough extremities on a
worse than raw squad of recruits to
lead them into first place in one of
America's really tough leagues, is
proof enough of his maple-court
genius. Bob Chalmers is the only
seasoned veteran of the whole lot and
he has played a weaker brand of
ball than any of the other players
from out of the Valley of the Giants.
A single victory by Stanford will
give the Trojans a new life, and if
there happens to be a play-off, Troy
should win. Like all other South
ern California teams, Sam Barry's
lads never play consistently well;
yet they are usually the best of the
lot in a'single game or a short series.
>l« $ &
OREGON and Washington are
playing their "crucial" tonight and
tomorrow in Seattle. Washington is
a full game behind the Ducks and
needs both for the northern palm.
Oregon did have a cinch two-game
lead until Slats Gill and his Oregon
State zone defense experts licked the
Webfeet last week to put the Hus
kies on base once more.
The way it looks now, it will be
Oregon and California in the play
offs at Eugene. Right now. the Bears
don't have the all-around ability of
the northerners. Laddie Gale and
Slim Wintermute, Oregon's two aces,
have been banging at the champion
ship door for three years. They are
fair and away the two outstanding
men in West Coast hoop ranks this
year.
Oregon hasn't lost a series to a
northern division opponent in three
years. The other two aces on the
squad are Wally Johansen and Bobby
Anet. The whole senior quartet has
been picked on all-star aggregations
for two years.
You just don't want to bet your
shekels against a crew like that.

Somehow or other we are inclined
to credit most of California's victories
to Price himself. The way he pol
ished up the rough extremities on a
worse than raw squad of recruits to
lead them into first place in one of
America's really tough leagues, is
proof enough of his maple-court
genius. Bob Chalmers is the only
seasoned veteran of the whole lot and
he has played a weaker brand of
ball than any of the other players
from out of the Valley of the Giants.
A single victory by Stanford will
give the Trojans a new life, and if
there happens to be a play-off, Troy
should win. Like all other South
ern California teams, Sam Barry's
lads never play consistently well;
yet they are usually the best of the
lot in a'single game or a short series.

OREGON and Washington are
playing their "crucial" tonight and
tomorrow in Seattle. Washington is
a full game behind the Ducks and
needs both for the northern palm.
Oregon did have a cinch two-game
lead until Slats Gill and his Oregon
State zone defense experts licked the
Webfeet last week to put the Hus
kies on base once more.
The way it looks now, it will be
Oregon and California in the play
offs at Eugene. Right now. the Bears
don't have the all-around ability of
the northerners. Laddie Gale and
Slim Wintermute, Oregon's two aces,
have been banging at the champion
ship door for three years. They are
fair and away the two outstanding
men in West Coast hoop ranks this
year.
Oregon hasn't lost a series to a
northern division opponent in three
years. The other two aces on the
squad are Wally Johansen and Bobby
Anet. The whole senior quartet has
been picked on all-star aggregations
for two years.
You just don't want to bet your
shekels against a crew like that.
t
FOR the first time in lour years
Stanford is approaching the last two
basketball games against California
without a championship in sight.
All the Indians can do by breaking
even with the league-leading Bears
will be to give U.S.C. one more
chance at the conference flag. Those
tall, often clumsy Bears have sur
prised the Coast with their steady
improvement. Either Nibs Price is
one of the best coaches in the game
or the old story about good big men,
etc., still rings true.
