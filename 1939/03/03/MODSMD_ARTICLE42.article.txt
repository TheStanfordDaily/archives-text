I ford heavyweight, knocked out Ron
| aid Mathews in the third round of
j the main event on the card, and Jack
Rice and Bill Greer punched out
J wins over opponents in the welter
j and light-heavyweight divisions.
Frank Mynderse, Stanford assistant
j boxing coach, termed the bout be
! tween Rice and Juel Droubay, which

! of the evening." The fight marked
the fifth time the two men have
fought, Rice having won three. Drou
bay one, and one having been an
exhibition bout.
Stanford won four out of seven
| bouts fought, Cal men outpointing
Cards in three bouts and taking the
: bantamweight class on a forfeit.
Bruce Berg lost the decision to

sion, Bob Hovey lost to John Drach
-1 nik in the lightweight, and Ed Stein
j lost on a technical kayo in round

"Cal was surprised that Ward's
| opponent did as well as he did
against the terrific Stanford heavy,"
Mynderse remarked. "Matthews put.
up a good fight against competition
that was just too strong for him."
The evening's program was in
marked contrast to the last meeting
of Bear and Farm boxers, when
Stanford* - won every bout fought,
taking seven out of a scheduled ten
fights and losing three on forfeits.
