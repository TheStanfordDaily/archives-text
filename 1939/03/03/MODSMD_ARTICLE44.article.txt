# Two Contests Head Weekend Rugby Slate
## 
### 
The Olympic and University Clubs
of Sail Francisco will meet in the
second rugby game of a twin bill in
the Stanford Stadium Saturday af
ternoon, according to word issued
yesterday by Coach Harry Maloney.
Stanford meets the Stanford Medical
School at 2:30 p.m. in the first game.
While the Medic game should be
no great hurdle for the Indian squad,
it should be a good practice game in
preparation for the big match with
California a week from tomorrow,
when Stanford will be playing for
the Coast Conference championship.
The Med School is coached by Dr.
Karl Schaupp, an old Stanford rugby
star, while several Stanford gradu
ates are in the line-up.
Coach Maloney and Volunteer
Coaches Wylie and Classen have
been experimenting with men in
new positions all week with reported
good results.
The game between the clubmen,
another Northern California Rugby
Association tilt, is slated to get un
der way immediately after the Stan
ford-Medic game, probably close to
3:30 p.m.
