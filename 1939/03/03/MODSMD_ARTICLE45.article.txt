# Sigma Chi, A.T.O. Win Close Semi-finals Matches
## 
### 
Fireworks blazed along the intramural hoop front last night in two tight,
i Hard-fought battles that would double the thrills and spills of most varsity
| cbntests. After the Httioke of battle hail cleared, two teams emerged as
Miponcnts fWr that filial deciding contest—A.T.O. and Sigma Chi.
In a hair-raising finish, A.T.O. finally came from behind to nip Sequoia
j 2IJ-22. The heroes of ibis scene were A.T.O. s Kai Larson and Jack Siefei i.

Trailing by a point with but three
minutes to go, Siefert dumped in a
follow-up shot; but Sequoia's Ham
lin retaliated with a forty-footer.
Larson then took his cue with a
mere 25 seconds remaining and
dropped in a bqautiful one-hander
from the outside rim of the foul
circle which sewed up the contest.
But tnis wasn't the whole game.
A.T.O.'s Bob Koch got his quota, 8
points, not to mention a badly banged
nose. Sequoia's "Andy" Anderson
and George Wood played .sharp ball,
collecting 9 and 7 digits respectnvely.
The other game was just as close
as far as the score goes, but Sigma
Chi seemed to have control through
out the tilt, finally winning 21-19
after fighting off a late Zete rally.
Jack Topham and Stan Owen of Sig
ma Chi and Stan Anderson of Zete
each tanked G points.

In a hair-raising finish, A.T.O. finally came from behind to nip Sequoia
j 2IJ-22. The heroes of ibis scene were A.T.O. s Kai Larson and Jack Siefei i.

Trailing by a point with but three
minutes to go, Siefert dumped in a
follow-up shot; but Sequoia's Ham
lin retaliated with a forty-footer.
Larson then took his cue with a
mere 25 seconds remaining and
dropped in a bqautiful one-hander
from the outside rim of the foul
circle which sewed up the contest.
But tnis wasn't the whole game.
A.T.O.'s Bob Koch got his quota, 8
points, not to mention a badly banged
nose. Sequoia's "Andy" Anderson
and George Wood played .sharp ball,
collecting 9 and 7 digits respectnvely.
The other game was just as close
as far as the score goes, but Sigma
Chi seemed to have control through
out the tilt, finally winning 21-19
after fighting off a late Zete rally.
Jack Topham and Stan Owen of Sig
ma Chi and Stan Anderson of Zete
each tanked G points.
