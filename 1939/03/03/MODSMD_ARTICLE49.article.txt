LIKE the family it would like to be, Stanford
will celebrate a new addition tomorrow. .
It's not news that the Boathouse is finished;
it's not news that Stanford is going to dedicate
it tomorrow.
But it is something when the University gets
a good old-fashioned chance to let down its
hair and really be enthusiastic about something
—the Boathouse.
For a long, long time Stanford has been a
pretty happy family. Ever since the day Gov
ernor and Mrs. Stanford watched the first sod
broken in the Quad, as a matter of fact.
But since that day in the 'nineties, much
has happened to the Stanford family—almost
enough to make it a bunch of relatives, not a
family.
First break-up came in 1517—1918, when part
of the Farm sailed away to war, never to return.
Along came rising price curves, dough came
rolling in and the split between those who had
and those who had not became wider. The
tired young man with a cocktail shaker was
born.
The crash brought things down to earth
again, the ice was melted, and collectively
many Stanfordites saw little men wobbling
big, long noses and shaking enormous index
fingers over the foot of the bed. And the bed
felt like it was on the down grade of a super
roller-coaster.
Feeling a cautious way along the years, Stan
ford gradually recovered, has been recovering
for the last two or three.
And at times, it seems like a pretty sober
place. '
It's lost almost entirely the old family spirit.
Small groups dominate social life; the Rough
has passed out of the picture.
And the result has been two extremes— j
smooth socialites and staid academicians. Each
one, it is true, with its own amusements.
The picture: on one side, almost frivolous; on
the other, overly-sober; in between, a huge
mass that isn't either and yet is both.
It's for the lattfcu that Boathouse Day has been j
planned.
It'll be a family day at the Lake and any- j
body looking for sophisticated entertainment |
had better stay away.
There will be baked beans, barbecued lamb, j
ice cream and Stanford will wallow in it. Bob i
Moulton will beam as his well-laid plans for the !
celebration tick off on as near to a schedule
as any picnic ever allowed.
When it's over, President Wilbur, head of
the family, will dedicate the boathouse—will
dedicate it for what it is—a place to have fun,
not a yacht club.
The feuding relatives from across the Bay
will be there, and they will be all set to con
tinue the feud after they've eaten.
After the barbecue is over, there's the bas- I
ketball game. As at all picnics, a dance will j
be held soon after.
In all, to Stanford's smoothies it .will be a !
disgusting affair. But if they let themselves I
go for a change, it's a cinch they'll have a good j
time along with the rest of the campus.
To the academicians, it will be a mass exhi- 1
bition of crass enthusiasm—something to be
typed the next time they happen into the psy
chology department. It's time, however, they
awakened from their unnatural vapor and got
in the swing of Stanford.
Why get enthusiastic about it?
It's Stanford's Picnic.
It's Stanford's Day.
It's Stanford's Boathouse.
