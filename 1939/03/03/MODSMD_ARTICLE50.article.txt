# The 						Best Laid Plans

### 
MOVING with the enthusiasm that should
: Boathouse Day, the seniors' Ex Com
mittee last night took a flyer, will throw their
Senior Prom on the day originally scheduled,

March 10 â€”if they can sign Freddy Martin,
now on strike in Southern California.
And they moved with well-planned preci
sion.
Publicity is planned already; decorating com
mittees have swung into action.
The campus will know whether or not the
dance is to be held at 1 o'clock today, when a
series of six sky bombs will be set off if the
answer is "yes."
Sounds like a 1939 version of Paul Revere;
in reality it will be the signal to set off campus
telephones, jam 3121 and 22151.
Men who think they can't get dates are
wrong; women on Senior Excom said a week
is plenty of time to get them.
With Freddy Martin the biggest name of
the year so far for Stanford, it's hard to see
how the seniors can lose.
Although in the midst of classes tomorrow,
dropping pencils may set off false alarms,
v/ith a little co-operation Stanford will have a
big pre-finals celebration.
