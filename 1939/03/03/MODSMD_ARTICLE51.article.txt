SILENT KNIGHT, HOLY KNIGHT
newest knight-errant, (he Steinbeck
k Committee, had the last fitting for its shining ar
mor the other day. and is now preparing to ride forth
redressing the wrongs of migratory workers. At the
moment, the committee looks like one of the best
pledges lhat our local chapter of knights ever got. It
is sincere and moderately sensible; and it is dedi
cated to a cause that is above reproach. It starts out
with the sympathetic if slightly vague support of the
students.
But knight-errantry has always been hard work;
and it is no easier now than it was in the days when
ogres and dragons were the ranking public enemies.
The committee will be badly disappointed if it ex
pects the magic words, "moved, seconded, carried," to
settle ils problem.

It is not my intention to tie crepe bows on the
committee's chromium plate armor. But in the last
four years I have seen any number of service groups
climb on their horses determined to make a purring
pet of some roaring social dragon. From most of them
we have heard nothing more; from a few we have
heard entirely too much. And so I can see that the
Steinbeck Committee is setting out on a quest lhat is
definitely dangerous.
Most crusading committees are engulfed in disap
pointment two weeks after they get under way. The
campus gives them a nice send-off and then forgets
them. The campaigners struggle on for a month or so,
and then most of them vanish quietly. A few kick
and scream and make themselves thoroughly objec
tionable before they go under.
»>
r f' , HE Steinbeck Committee can s i expect any special
dispensation. As soon as Stanford has shown the
necessary minimum of polite interest, it will forget all
about migratory workers, and the committee will have
to fend for itself' from there on in.
As student interest slumps, the committee will find
the waters of discouragement lapping up to its nose.
There will be a tremendous temptation either to chuck
the whole thing and go canoeing, or to stand up on
the first soap box and tell Stanford that it is a mis
erable assortment of egotistical morons. If the com
mittee can't resist that temptation it. will become just
an objectionable noise.
# * *
If the Steinbeck group can hold together in spite
of disappointment it has a fair chance of doing a little
real good. It will never make any stupendous contri
bution, because its scale is too small. But if it is
patient and tactful it may shift the attitude of Stanford
students slightly In the direction it wants. And it may
be able to do a little actual welfare work.
That is all the committee can hope for. It can't
expect to lead an army of crusaders, complete with
waving banners. It will have to be satisfied with a
small contribution to Stanford's outlook. If it can't
content itself with that, it will either vanish unob
trusively or become a noisy nuisance.

mor the other day. and is now preparing to ride forth
redressing the wrongs of migratory workers. At the
moment, the committee looks like one of the best
pledges lhat our local chapter of knights ever got. It
is sincere and moderately sensible; and it is dedi

with the sympathetic if slightly vague support of the
students.
But knight-errantry has always been hard work;

It is not my intention to tie crepe bows on the
committee's chromium plate armor. But in the last
four years I have seen any number of service groups
climb on their horses determined to make a purring
pet of some roaring social dragon. From most of them
we have heard nothing more; from a few we have
heard entirely too much. And so I can see that the
Steinbeck Committee is setting out on a quest lhat is
definitely dangerous.
Most crusading committees are engulfed in disap
pointment two weeks after they get under way. The
campus gives them a nice send-off and then forgets
them. The campaigners struggle on for a month or so,
and then most of them vanish quietly. A few kick
and scream and make themselves thoroughly objec
tionable before they go under.
»>
r f' , HE Steinbeck Committee can s i expect any special
dispensation. As soon as Stanford has shown the
necessary minimum of polite interest, it will forget all
about migratory workers, and the committee will have
to fend for itself' from there on in.
As student interest slumps, the committee will find
the waters of discouragement lapping up to its nose.
There will be a tremendous temptation either to chuck
the whole thing and go canoeing, or to stand up on
the first soap box and tell Stanford that it is a mis
erable assortment of egotistical morons. If the com
mittee can't resist that temptation it. will become just
an objectionable noise.
# * *
If the Steinbeck group can hold together in spite
of disappointment it has a fair chance of doing a little
real good. It will never make any stupendous contri
bution, because its scale is too small. But if it is
patient and tactful it may shift the attitude of Stanford
students slightly In the direction it wants. And it may
be able to do a little actual welfare work.
That is all the committee can hope for. It can't
expect to lead an army of crusaders, complete with
waving banners. It will have to be satisfied with a
small contribution to Stanford's outlook. If it can't
content itself with that, it will either vanish unob
trusively or become a noisy nuisance.
