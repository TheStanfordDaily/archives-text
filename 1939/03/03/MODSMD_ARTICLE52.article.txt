FUN
He was looking bad. He was running around show
ing everyone how hard he was working. After he got.
a hair-cut you could see how pale he was. He would
describe to you the mental scars he was getting from
over-work. That, he would say, is what the Business
School does to you.
But last week-end he was going to fix all of that.
He was going down south to see his girl at U.S.C, He
was going to have a good time. To hell with work.
So when Friday came, he went down. He got to
bed early Friday night to be in shape for Saturday.
It was going to be a big day.
He got? up at some ridiculously early hour the next
morning, and went over to see his girl. She had a sur
prise for him: a picnic.
What could he do. He got his girl and an inhuman
number of pigs' feet and other gastronomic rubbish
into a car he had rented, and drove out to some windy
hill for a picnic.
After lunch, he and his girl found a nice, shady tree,
and sat down under it. Just like in the movies. Un
like said movie, the girl decided it would be a fine
thing to take a small hike.
"Not me," said the over-worked Business Man.
The girl was determined. She went on her hike
alone.
The Business Man, who is already developing a few
staid patterns, went to sleep.
This was the day he was going to have fun. His
girl goes on a hike, and he goes to sleep under a tree.
He woke up at G o'clock.
Four hundred miles to sleep under a tree.

NO
Quite a nice female copyreader, who does not make
a habit of leaving notes for me on the bulletin board
here, left one for me today. She writes:
"Just think what will happen if a fellow has made
two separate dates for the Senior and Junior Proms
and then awakens to find they have been combined!"
Siamese twins are born, my dear, not made. It's
not even worth thinking about.

PROBLEM
The fate of the Boat-house is at the cross-roids:
Will it be better to have sunny weather and a
nice, jolly Boathouse Day?
Or will it be better to have a pouring rain today
and a nice, tolly Spring Quarter?
Let Fx Committee decide.
