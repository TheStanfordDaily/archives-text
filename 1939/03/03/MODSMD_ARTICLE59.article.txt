# Rayons, Linens Seen in Limelight as Spring Looms on Horizon
## Stripes, Prints Lead Quad Clothes Parade 
### 
With spring coming on, the
thoughts of ihe Stanford vyoman are
turning more and more to the prob
lem of a spring wardrobe. Since a
large part of her days are spent on
and around the campus, the problem
of campus cloths looms large.
The classic shirtmaker frocks are
as good this year as they are in any
year. Spun rayons and linens are
favored materials. Featured this year
is a new acetate cloth, crusaline,
which has the texture of rough
linen, but is non-crushable. Pleated
or flared skirts will be worn.
Dirndls, as such, are not being
shown, but the peasant-type dress,
this season featuring fullness pulled
to the front and entirely straight in
back is still with us.
SEERSUCKERS POPULAR
Boon to the girl who does her own
laundry, will be the seersucker
prints. These dresses, made with
.shirtmaker bodices, full skirts, and
white pique Peter Pan collars, are
being shown full-strength this year.
For cool nights or windy days,
light tweed or wool jackets in solid
pastel colors may be worn over print
sports frocks. New this season are
cotton quilted sports jackets with
zippers up the front which may be
worn with evening or afternoon
clothes as well as wash dresses.
New in the print dress class will
be a revival of the princess lines.
Short/ chenille buttoned-up cardi
gans with gros grain trim fashioned
into epaullettes, are being pushed as
more feminine successors to last
year's Beer jacket.
COOL WEATHER CLOTHES
It is still cool enough to necessi
tate; comment on the wool clothes.
Sweaters and skirts are still de ri
gour, but the color schemes are defi
nitely new. Purple skirts may be
worn with dusty pink, chartreuse,

or vivid turquoise sweaters, and
dusty pink skirts are being shown
with wine and turquoise sweaters.
Casual coats for the campus in
clude the usual flannel and tweed
jackets, but the new ones are hip
length. A new three quarter length
camel's hair polo coat faatures
French vents, large button-up poc
kets, and it is collarless.
Tailored shirts are continuing in
feminine favor. Bright Roman stripes
with the new rope pattern are con
sidered smart. This rope pattern is
also being shown in both silk and
cotton print dresses.
Sweaters are essentially simple.
Plain shet lands, cashmeres, and
zephyr are used in both pull-over
pnd cardigan types, but the "knit
one, pearl one" style is far ahead
of the more decorative types.
FAIR SKIRTS STRONG
The straight skirt appears to be on
the wane, and flairs, godettes, and
pleats are rising in demand. A new
material, sergine, similar to serge,
but lighter in weight is being used
in the spring skirt styles.
A nearly indispensable adjunct to
any Stanford woman's wardrobe is
the light-weight wool dress. These
really usable little frocks may be
worn either on the Quad or for
street wear under a coat. They
continue to be designed in the pre
vailing shirt-maker mode, with
flaired or pleated skirts. An amus
ing idea being featured by a local
shop is to have the name or initials
of the wearer embroidered on the hip
pocket.
As for general trends, sleeves are
larger than ever, skirts will continue
full and short, 17 inches, while waists
must be definitely "waspish." De
spite the "trend" however, Stanford
women's campus clothes will con
tinue to be eminently practical and
comfortable.

vailing shirt-maker mode, with
flaired or pleated skirts. An amus
ing idea being featured by a local
shop is to have the name or initials
of the wearer embroidered on the hip
pocket.
As for general trends, sleeves are
larger than ever, skirts will continue
full and short, 17 inches, while waists
must be definitely "waspish." De
spite the "trend" however, Stanford
women's campus clothes will con
tinue to be eminently practical and
comfortable.
With spring coming on, the
thoughts of ihe Stanford vyoman are
turning more and more to the prob
lem of a spring wardrobe. Since a
large part of her days are spent on
and around the campus, the problem
of campus cloths looms large.
The classic shirtmaker frocks are
as good this year as they are in any
year. Spun rayons and linens are
favored materials. Featured this year
is a new acetate cloth, crusaline,
which has the texture of rough
linen, but is non-crushable. Pleated
or flared skirts will be worn.
Dirndls, as such, are not being
shown, but the peasant-type dress,
this season featuring fullness pulled
to the front and entirely straight in
back is still with us.
SEERSUCKERS POPULAR
Boon to the girl who does her own
laundry, will be the seersucker
prints. These dresses, made with
.shirtmaker bodices, full skirts, and
white pique Peter Pan collars, are
being shown full-strength this year.
For cool nights or windy days,
light tweed or wool jackets in solid
pastel colors may be worn over print
sports frocks. New this season are
cotton quilted sports jackets with
zippers up the front which may be
worn with evening or afternoon
clothes as well as wash dresses.
New in the print dress class will
be a revival of the princess lines.
Short/ chenille buttoned-up cardi
gans with gros grain trim fashioned
into epaullettes, are being pushed as
more feminine successors to last
year's Beer jacket.
COOL WEATHER CLOTHES
It is still cool enough to necessi
tate; comment on the wool clothes.
Sweaters and skirts are still de ri
gour, but the color schemes are defi
nitely new. Purple skirts may be
worn with dusty pink, chartreuse,

or vivid turquoise sweaters, and
dusty pink skirts are being shown
with wine and turquoise sweaters.
Casual coats for the campus in
clude the usual flannel and tweed
jackets, but the new ones are hip
length. A new three quarter length
camel's hair polo coat faatures
French vents, large button-up poc
kets, and it is collarless.
Tailored shirts are continuing in
feminine favor. Bright Roman stripes
with the new rope pattern are con
sidered smart. This rope pattern is
also being shown in both silk and
cotton print dresses.
Sweaters are essentially simple.
Plain shet lands, cashmeres, and
zephyr are used in both pull-over
pnd cardigan types, but the "knit
one, pearl one" style is far ahead
of the more decorative types.
FAIR SKIRTS STRONG
The straight skirt appears to be on
the wane, and flairs, godettes, and
pleats are rising in demand. A new
material, sergine, similar to serge,
but lighter in weight is being used
in the spring skirt styles.
A nearly indispensable adjunct to
any Stanford woman's wardrobe is
the light-weight wool dress. These
really usable little frocks may be
worn either on the Quad or for
street wear under a coat. They
continue to be designed in the pre
vailing shirt-maker mode, with
flaired or pleated skirts. An amus
