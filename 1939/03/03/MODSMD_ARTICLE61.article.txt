# Light-weight Clothes Will Be in Fashion For Summer Months
## 
### 
California has taken ice-skating
to her heart and will not relin
quish it under the summer sun. But
the warm winter woolies that were
so necessary when skating in the
cold winds of winter will have to
be shed for clothes suitable to the
summer heat.
Now that the question is how to
keep cool rather than how to warm,
not only wiH woolen underskirts be
discarded, but a complete change
of attitude will take place.
Instead of Sheltland and shed
wether skirt materials, a fine silk
gabardine or even sharkskin, is the
thing. Both of these materials have
just enough body to make fine
stitched modes and will ripple grace
fully across the rink when you show
oft' a fine figure-eight.
The most sensible topper for the
new skirt is a long-sleeved tailored
shirt in striped tie-silk. Clever
manufacturers are cutting these
shirts with large armholes especially
for vigorous skaters.
For those who cling to sweaters
throughout the year, there are many
new ideas. Short baby sweaters in
white or pastels with round col
lars should be a pleasant sight on
the link. Tyrolean sweaters are
now being made in light comfortable
yarns that will keep the heat out in
the warmest weather.
The problem of what to do about
the new finger wave is just as se
rious for summer skaters as for
winter.
