## 
### 
Two new powder bases, reported j
to keep powder from entering and
unemployed relative, are being pro- j
duced quite regularly now by the 1
English House of Cyclax, known for:
its common sense attitude toward
i the skin.
1 They are Day Lotion for dry skins
and Blended Lotion for skins that
border on the oily. They are said j
to keep powder fro mentering and j
j clogging the pores. Peach Blonde i
i is the shade suggested, and it should i
j be used with the new English Petu- i
| nia lipstick and rouge.
