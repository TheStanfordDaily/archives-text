# Exercises Form Basis for Chic
## New Time-savers Solve Figure Plan

You think that exercises are more
than you can handle along with
studying and dating and some sleep
too? Well here is your answer. There
are many little stunts that you can
do while carrying out your daily
routine.
For instance drop a handkerchief
or a book and don't wait for a hand
some man to pick it up for you, but
rather pick it up yourself with your
knees straight and back stiff. If you
keep on dropping things the assist
ance will disappear and you can
carry on your exercises undisturbed
with a better posture for your
trouble.
After a hard day of exes and gen
eral nerve fraying, here is a way to
pull yourself together. Push the el
bows down toward your chair until
you can Jeel the tension in your
neck, and hold this position for
few seconds. This not only helps
nerves but also gives the posture
a little boost.
POISE IMPORTANT
When you are sitting in the public
eye always pretend that an invisible
cameraman is waiting to snap you.
This thought will instinctively make
you sit up and take a deep breath
which fills out hollow and "character
lines." This adds to your poise.
Always stand up straight, and
look far back over the shoulder to
strengthen the neck muscles and
keep the chin up. When doing this
exercise beware of those who may
not realize that it is all just an exer
cise.
The final addition to a complete
exercise series comes under the
heading of footwork. In your spare
moments or while studying, wriggle
your toes one foot at a time. This
makes them strong for skiing and
skating and dancing, not to mention
those walks around the Quad which
you make every day.
None of these tricks take any ex
tra time and they all add to your
general appearance, and most of all
to your poise.
