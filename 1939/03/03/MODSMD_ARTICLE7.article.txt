# Sunday Movie Has Classic German Plot
## 
### 
Return of the long-popular classic
of author Hermann Sudermann, this
time in the form of a German-made
flicker, "Heimat," has been slated as
this Sunday night's 7:30 o'clock
movie.
In plot, "Heimat" is obviously a
melodrama, but the skillful direction
of Carl Froelich has ably curbed all
expected emotional outbursts on the
part of his charges. Supported by
the continual interspersing of finely
recorded background music, the
bevy of top-notch foreign actors and
actresses, led by the Swedish singer,
Zarah Leander, has produced a pic
ture which has been given a three
and one-half bell rating by New
York newspapers.
Zarah Leander as the run-away
daughter who leaves her strict home
to become an opera singer, sings and
flutters her way through her leading
lady role surprisingly well consider
ing the stereotyped nature of Su
dermann's classical plot, the delight
of Hollywood rehashing writers.
The acting is good, and Miss Lean
der proves herself something of a
rarity in being a beauty who stays
beautiful while she sings. The con
clusion of the plot is obvious from
the opening scene, but an unex
pected last-scene twist neatly clips
the story's tag ends.
