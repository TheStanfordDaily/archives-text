# Jewels Reflect 'Fair' Influence
## Pottery, Live Plants Add to Ensembles 
### 
Spring jewelry is continuing in
the trends .set by fall and* winter
fashions with the addition of the
"Fair" influence. Heavy costume
jewelry, bunchy chains and brace
lets, the Victorian influence and nov
elty knick-knacks are still the vogue.
The 'fleet of the Fair can also be
seen in lapel pins and bracelet
charms. Tiny bridges und miniature
treasure chests will adorn the spring
costume of the western girl.
The novelty clips and pins have
| shown signs of spring fever with the
newest ones featuring little couples,
boy and girl, playing some sport,
j Other lapel touches continue their
| crazy tendencies with "Ferdinands,"
j umbrellas, lampshades, matchboxes
| and the like.
BUNCIIY FRUIT
Colorful bunchy jewelry is more
! popular and bunchier than ever.
| Instead of one strand of little bub
i bles, fruit or leaves, several strands
are now draped around the neck.
; Chains made of large links of gold
or silver or brightly hued plastics
| are vci'y good worn over sweaters or
I simple frocks.
For dainty evening wear the new
j pottery neckwear is definitely the
j thintj for that finishing touch. Tiny
I porcelain posies strung into flower
j chains or put onto little clips for the
hair are tinted in soft pastel shades
| to add an angelic note to your latest
| formal.
Some of the new ideas in jewelry
j are practical as well as decorative.
I Ear clips are now being made in
I minute enamel flowers with gold
mesh centers. Under the mesh there
lies a hollow into which you can
place a cotton wad moistened with
! your favorite perfume.
In addition to pottery ornaments,
| we now have living plants decorating
hats and blouses in the form of
mosses and tiny trees. Bugs are still
j used to liven up a plain dress or hat,
but now they are being made of the
same material as real fisherman's
flies and look genuine.
The Victorian influence is still seen
; in "chatelaines," those collections of
; dingle-dangles a lady will wear on
| her lapel or at the throat of her
| blouse. Several lockets can be hid
-1 den among the collections. Men's
| stick-pins are now collected into
| bunches of different lengths and
J placed in clips.

The Victorian influence is still seen
; in "chatelaines," those collections of
; dingle-dangles a lady will wear on
| her lapel or at the throat of her
| blouse. Several lockets can be hid
-1 den among the collections. Men's
| stick-pins are now collected into
| bunches of different lengths and
J placed in clips.
Spring jewelry is continuing in
the trends .set by fall and* winter
fashions with the addition of the
"Fair" influence. Heavy costume
jewelry, bunchy chains and brace
lets, the Victorian influence and nov
elty knick-knacks are still the vogue.
The 'fleet of the Fair can also be
seen in lapel pins and bracelet
charms. Tiny bridges und miniature
treasure chests will adorn the spring
costume of the western girl.
The novelty clips and pins have
| shown signs of spring fever with the
newest ones featuring little couples,
boy and girl, playing some sport,
j Other lapel touches continue their
| crazy tendencies with "Ferdinands,"
j umbrellas, lampshades, matchboxes
| and the like.
BUNCIIY FRUIT
Colorful bunchy jewelry is more
! popular and bunchier than ever.
| Instead of one strand of little bub
i bles, fruit or leaves, several strands
are now draped around the neck.
; Chains made of large links of gold
or silver or brightly hued plastics
| are vci'y good worn over sweaters or
I simple frocks.
For dainty evening wear the new
j pottery neckwear is definitely the
j thintj for that finishing touch. Tiny
I porcelain posies strung into flower
j chains or put onto little clips for the
hair are tinted in soft pastel shades
| to add an angelic note to your latest
| formal.
Some of the new ideas in jewelry
j are practical as well as decorative.
I Ear clips are now being made in
I minute enamel flowers with gold
mesh centers. Under the mesh there
lies a hollow into which you can
place a cotton wad moistened with
! your favorite perfume.
In addition to pottery ornaments,
| we now have living plants decorating
hats and blouses in the form of
mosses and tiny trees. Bugs are still
j used to liven up a plain dress or hat,
but now they are being made of the
same material as real fisherman's
flies and look genuine.
