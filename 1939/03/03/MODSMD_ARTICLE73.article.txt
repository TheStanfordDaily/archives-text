# Hobnail Dutch Boy Shoes Lead Spring Footwear
## 
### 
Trends for spring footwear are definitely Dutch. On the sporty side,
the newest thing is the Dutch Boy Windmill Sabot which has just been

women's colleges by storm. They have the wooden soles of the original
sabots of Holland, and leather uppers trimmed with hobnails. Colors

most popular are white, steerhide,<
and brighter shades of red, grfeen, i
and blu^.
Also for sport wear, the traditional

Sandals—the Mexican huaraches—
are still good. Even better than last

cent of the women will be wearing
huaraches over last year's thirty per
cent.

Fair and San Francisco Exposition
exert their influence. Mural tones,
taken from the murals of the Fair
buildings themselves, will predomi
nate.
The second color category was
chosen by the Apparel Aiis Com
mission in New York—complexion
shades. These are shades of wine
with lipstick as the main tone.
Stockings will follow this trend with j
lighter colors and a rosy overcast |
to match shoe shades.
MURAL COLORS
Mural and complexion tones will
dominate along with the ever-popu
lar patent leather and brown and
white. While is always good, but !

per cent of the dress shoes this
spring.
New lasts, new shapes for all shoes.

with lipstick as the main tone.
Stockings will follow this trend with j
lighter colors and a rosy overcast |
to match shoe shades.
MURAL COLORS
Mural and complexion tones will
dominate along with the ever-popu
lar patent leather and brown and
white. While is always good, but !
color is the thing.
Toes and heels are still out. Open
toes and heels will characterize 80
per cent of the dress shoes this
spring.
New lasts, new shapes for all shoes.
Exposition and Dutch influences and
a myriad of colors with bags and
gloves to match are the present
trends for Spring.
