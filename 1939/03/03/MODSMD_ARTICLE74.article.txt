# Footwear to Blend With New Colors
## 
### 
Launching an entirely new trend
in accessories and footwear modes,
spring 1939 will see beautifully
blended or matching colors in shoes
and hosiery. The effect is of a
"symphony in color" from head to
toe and has been at once accepted
by smart fashion leaders.
Delightful new color schemes al
ready seen in smartly ensembled
costumes are the warm reddish
"cranberry" tones in shoes and bags
with blending hosiery which has the
same deliciously warm hue in a
lighter tint.
