The importance of color harmony
in clothes has always been realized,
but the modern girl takes an even
greater interest in it than did her
1920 cousin.
The latest spring fashions allow
the imaginative miss great leeway
for her originality. Matching colors
are no longer standardized; the
way to the use of many toned shades
strictly two-color ensemble hay given
with one or two contrasting colors.
The striped jacket, headed for pop
ularity this spring, lends itself ex
cellently to this idea. A dark purple
jacket with thin gold stripes and a
gold swinging skirt will look attrac
tive with a scarf of a lighter-toned
violet.
Since violets are coming into their
own, apple green flowers are worn
with purple suits. White is too con
ventional. A soft powder blue
sweater with violet will do wonders
for fair-skinned girls. It may be
startling, but they'll be wearing fus
chia and chartreuse together.
The old standby, black and white,
will always look smart. If the dress
is entirely black with no relief, a
chain of pale pink or pale blue sea
shelsl at the throat gives contrast.
