# Contrasting Furs Smart This Season
## 
### 
Color is big news with furs be
cause window displays in many
shops show how they will blend
with the colorful gowns chosen for
the spring. They either blend or
give a rich contrast to the light
weight wools and little jacket suits
designed for this season.
Chubby coats are shown in cross
fox, silver fox, and blue fox shades
with dresses in bluejay and lime
tree colors. These colors are also
repeated in the millinery, relating
the costume in color with the con
trast in the soft shades of the fur
coats worn.
The shorter scarf of several skins
is designed to complement the suits.
Persian lamb is a great favorite and
is shown in the longer length wrap,
generally emphasizing the straight
line coats.
