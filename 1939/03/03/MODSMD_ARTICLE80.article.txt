# New Hose Is Light Blue
## 
### 
Not so long ago all ladies wore
heavy lisle stockings, and the im
modest silk were worn only by
women who were not very well
bred. But the old-fashioned stick
lers for convention were gradually
won over to the more attractive
style and since then stockings have
come a long way.
Chiffon was the next step in limb
wear you still didn't say "leg"), but
colors were grey, brown, or black.
During the 'twenties stockings were
rolled below the knee and dresses
ended above. Women found knee
length hose more comfortable and
practical than any others, so the
"knee-hi" was born.
At about the same time, some de
signers hit upon the idea of reddish
stockings to accent the legs. But
while "knee-hi's" went out with
long dresses, the red shade stayed on,
and nearly eveiyone, no matter what
the size of their lower extremities,
adopted the style.
RUN-PROOF MESH
In the meantime mesh hose came
and went, leaving sheer chiffon the
most popular material. In spite of a
slight hangover of mesh last year,
they don't seem headed for the same
popularity again. But a variation of

the idea is. These are the run-proof
sheer mesh that are the most practi
cal material used yet. They abso
lutely won't run, although they catch
and tear holes.
Several unique styles have been
added to leg-apparel this spring, and
one of the most amazing is light
blue, sheer chiffon to be worn
with soft Paris-blue shoes of suede.
Although this sounds as if legs would
look death-like, the blue is a very
light color and unusual enough to
be interesting.
SPARKLES FOR FORMALS
Another innovation is evening
stockings with rhinestones fastened
firmly on the back of the heel to be
worn with open-heel shoes. The
cordial-toned hose recently intro
duced are good for dress or evening
and are very close to flesh-colored.
The toes and heels are not reinforced,
but are sheer for wear with open
toed and open-heeled shoes. How
ever, they aren't guaranteed for long
wear.
But these extreme styles will prob
ably not find complete favor; there
are still many women who don't
like to call too much attention to
their legs. As a reactionary trend,
red stockings are being replaced by
more conservative, tanner shades.

while "knee-hi's" went out with
long dresses, the red shade stayed on,
and nearly eveiyone, no matter what
the size of their lower extremities,
adopted the style.
RUN-PROOF MESH
In the meantime mesh hose came
and went, leaving sheer chiffon the
most popular material. In spite of a
slight hangover of mesh last year,
they don't seem headed for the same
popularity again. But a variation of

the idea is. These are the run-proof
sheer mesh that are the most practi
cal material used yet. They abso
lutely won't run, although they catch
and tear holes.
Several unique styles have been
added to leg-apparel this spring, and
one of the most amazing is light
blue, sheer chiffon to be worn
with soft Paris-blue shoes of suede.
Although this sounds as if legs would
look death-like, the blue is a very
light color and unusual enough to
be interesting.
SPARKLES FOR FORMALS
Another innovation is evening
stockings with rhinestones fastened
firmly on the back of the heel to be
worn with open-heel shoes. The
cordial-toned hose recently intro
duced are good for dress or evening
and are very close to flesh-colored.
The toes and heels are not reinforced,
but are sheer for wear with open
toed and open-heeled shoes. How
ever, they aren't guaranteed for long
wear.
But these extreme styles will prob
ably not find complete favor; there
are still many women who don't
like to call too much attention to
their legs. As a reactionary trend,
red stockings are being replaced by
more conservative, tanner shades.
Not so long ago all ladies wore
heavy lisle stockings, and the im
modest silk were worn only by
women who were not very well
bred. But the old-fashioned stick
lers for convention were gradually
won over to the more attractive
style and since then stockings have
come a long way.
Chiffon was the next step in limb
wear you still didn't say "leg"), but
colors were grey, brown, or black.
During the 'twenties stockings were
rolled below the knee and dresses
ended above. Women found knee
length hose more comfortable and
practical than any others, so the
"knee-hi" was born.
At about the same time, some de
signers hit upon the idea of reddish
stockings to accent the legs. But
