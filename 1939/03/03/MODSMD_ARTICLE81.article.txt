# Fabrics Show Clever Designs
## Practicality, Unusual Patterns Emphasized 
### 
Fabric and color are just as im
portant as the style in feminine ap
parel. In fact, shoddy material or
garish color combinations can ruin
even the most clever design.
This season wools are being com
bined in both subtle and startling
ways, but either is definitely pleas
ing. One of the more popular blends
is diluted blue and fuchsia. This is
fashioned into a very plain dress in
the solid blue, with a basket weave
jacket using blue and fuschia in a
plaid design.
Citron and gun-metal grey is a
fresh alliance for spring. This is used
to advantage in a simple monastic
dress with a Victorian jacket add
ing dash.
UNUSUAL CREPE
In crepe many amusing designs
have appeared. "Who do you love?"
is the query written in a stripe pat
tern of gold and purple all over one
impertinent sample. A dirndl-type
dress with a tie-on skirt uses this
quaint fabric to advantage.
New and intensely practical is
Sag-No-Mor jersey which is not the
least impressionable, but will hop
back into shape after each wearing.
This material is ideal for spectator
sports frocks in the classic shirt
maker style.
Cinnamon scrolls, life size, on jet
silk are especially smart when made
in the current old-fashioned mode,
and worn with a tiny black straw
poke bonnet.
FLOWER PRINTS
Flower prints are still with us, but
gone are the great sprawly ones of
previous seasons. In their steads
have come prim orderly designs
which march in geometric precision
over silk or print paths. Typical of
the new trend is a cyclamen print
silk with tidy dwarf flowers in blue
and green.
Gabardine, good as always, has
come out in slant-wise herring-bone
weaves which are being used in the
always smart tailleurs. New and
tricky will be the white pique bolero
over the classic tailored frocks.
