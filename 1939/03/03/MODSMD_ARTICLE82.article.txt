# New Dutch Shoes Recall Dirndl Rage
## 
### 
Playtime and high school frocks
will feature prints in bright color
swatches. This, as a cany-over of
the dirndl rage of last year, fits right
in the picture of "old-country" in
fluence.
And this picture includes the new
Dutch-boy influence in shoes. These
shoes are really woodâ€”light-weight
and youthfully in good humor.
