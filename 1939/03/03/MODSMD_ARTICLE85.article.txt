# RIBBONS AS RUDDERS
## 
### 
Rudders of ribbon tell which way
a Glengarry bonnet is heading. One
is white grosgrain, the other black,
and they swish together at the back
of white straw hat on Scotch cap
lines. Schiaparelli designed it.

Suits are absolutely necessary for
spring. An exti'a-special one for
dress-up and a more informal one
for good times are fun to have.
