# Fashions See Great Change in World of '39
## 
### FELKER MORRIS 
Wove watched fashions for nearly two decades now, consciously or sub
consciously—ami what a kaleidoscopic picture reels through our minds.
For example—formats. Take the dapper era of "26 with evening dresses
brushing the knees, heavily headed, round necked. with waists falling
around the hips. But in '26 that was "a la mode."

Then came the epoch of gowns*
.short in front and long in back, but
otherwise characterized by the same
anachronistic style features. Dawned
1929 and we were talking about the
"new long skirts," which flopped just
below the knee.
Since then we have weathered
periods of indecision which have
now ended with street clothes going
back up but formals following the
stock market down. And down skirts
have stayed except for one short
skirted dancing fad.
In the dead year of 1938 youth and
age alike blossomed forth in hoop
skirts and a shoulder-exposing act.
The Southern Belle of '61 had noth
ing on us. We even out-crinolined
her, figuratively speaking. Boney
necks and scrawny shoulders all
came mercilessly into view. What
price beauty! But we loved it.
The next trend to captivate style
conscious women was the "lower
hip line (A very far-removed step
child of the '26 waist-line however)
that revealed figures in their full
width and breadth. Supplementing
these fashions, we rolled our hair
what the historians will record as
on the top of our heads and sported
the "up hair" style.
Like sheep we follow the pace
setters of fashion. The incumbent
favorite of '39 made its appearance
in' the last sighs of '38 and is called
the "tensile top"—these elastic
bodiced creations are taking three
to one bets as the spring favorite.
Thus we summarize the highlights of
the past years and Wonder, "1940,
what next?"
