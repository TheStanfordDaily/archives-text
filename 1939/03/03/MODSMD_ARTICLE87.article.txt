# New Scarf Designs Feature Fair Motif
## 
### 
Scarves will be in demand this
spring as much as in past seasons.
But this year's scarves will be in the
new bright shades and unusual de
signs.
The billowy chiffon scarves are in
soft pastel and violet colors and will
be worn mostly with white or light
colored sweaters and dresses.
Embroidered figures in all poses
and positions will decorate some
squares and triangles to be worn
around the neck or over the head.
Figured and striped silk scarves
will also be popular along with
maps of the universe, ancient docu
ments and zodiac signs stamped on
some of the newer ones.
