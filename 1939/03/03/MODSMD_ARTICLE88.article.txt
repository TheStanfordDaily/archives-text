# Men Find New Gowns Alluring
## Boots, Moccassins Banned by Women 
### SARAH GANSETT 
Some boys say some girls look
very good in anything and others,
like Stella at the Fair, in virtually
nothing.
Some boys like the new evening
dresses which are split or go into a
stall half way down. They say it
brings out the Near-Eastern in them.
This type of dress, on the whole, is
considered very alluring.
One boy complained that he can't
study at the library because of brace
lets which jingle. He is especially
allergic to bells. He can't keep his
mind on his work when he hears
bells.
Another boy said he was partial
to clothes which were reminiscent,
of another century. That's just the
way he put it, "reminiscent."
One boy said he can't see why
every girl has to be regimented. He
is tired of pastel sweaters; he said,
and pearls
The girls were quite definite, tOo.
One of them said, "I don't like cow
boy boots and men that go around
in sandals like a sissy or a character
out of the Bible, or white socks with
black pants that mostly professors
wear." Under pressure, she also ad
mitted that she was not partial to
polo shirts which had been worn
during heavy action at the gym.
"Draw y6ur own conclusions," she
said.
Most of the girls like plaid jackets,
loud socks, and T-shirts. Slacks and
sweaters are fine, they said, and
shirt-tails out look comfortable, too.
