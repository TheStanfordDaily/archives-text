# POSTURE ADDS STYLE
## 
### 
Elizabeth Arden's salon has three
sculptured figurines dressed in the
same suit, but with very different
postures. One slumps, one sticks out
her tummy and the other stands
straight and tall. It's surprising what
a difference posture makes in the
appearance of an outfit.
