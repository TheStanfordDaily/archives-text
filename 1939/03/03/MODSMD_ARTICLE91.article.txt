## 
### DOUG JAQUES 
For the alst six months, most
women—all women who spend any
time at all reading about fashions—
have been wearing a new kind of
purple lip-stick.
You know, that stuff that makes a
woman's lips look awfully cold and
wet like grape jelly.
Men have done their best to get
the women to go back to the old,
traditional lipstick. It has done no
good. Day by day the purple stuff
becomes more popular.
A few of the men say, "Well, you
get used to it." That's the most
they can say. Because there is noth
ing more perverse than a woman
who reads a fashion magazine.
Fashion becomes a sort of religion
to her.
What other reason could she pos
sibly have for wearing purple lip
stick, the kind of lip-stick that a
man has to get used to?
