# Honolulu Sports Skirts Popular Spring Quarter
## 
### 
For several years those wild, Hon
olulu shirts gradually wormed their
way into part of the Farm Rough's
spring quarter wearing apparel,
then last spring they hit the cam
pusâ€”with a smash.
Destined to be even more popular
I his spring, they can be bought at all
Palo Alto stores for from $l-$5. More
expensive, more colorful ones are
brought to the Farm every year by
Stanford students living in Hono
lulu.
