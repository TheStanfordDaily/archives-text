# What Does He Notice First?
## 
### 
Realizing that the modern woman
is always interested in knowing how
she looks to the opposite sex, the
editors of a favorite woman's maga
zine recently conducted a poll among
prominent men who enjoy the repu
tation of being among the best
dressed in the country.
The question that was asked was:
"What is it that you first notice
when you meet a beautiful woman?"
The answers were many and varied,
but the following were the outstand
ing ones:
Munro Leaf, creator of "Ferdi
nand," is of the opinion that a
woman's eyes are a dead give
away. However, he adds, "This
doesn't count if she happens to be
walking* in the opposite direction."
DOUG LIKES WHOLE
In Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s esti
mation, the tout ensemble is what
attracts him, more than any one
feature. He adds, "If her voice is
good, I like that, too. But, definitely,
the complete picture!"
Peter Arno, well known socialite
cartoonist., responded to the ques
tion with the following statement:
"A woman's ankles are a key to her
type."
The answer of John Kieran, the
star of "Information, Please," holds
a warning to all devotees of con
spicuous nail polish. "I notice her
fingernails first—with distaste if
they're red. Then I take stock of
her eyes. I guess it's because some
poet once said they're the windows
of the soul!"
JUDGES HAND-SHAKE
McClelland Barclay, famous il
lustrator, does not rely on beauty
in judging a woman, but bases his
opinion of her on her hand-shake.
He says, "I am very conscious of the
hand-shake — whether it's firm, or
cold, or if it's the tell-tale come-and
get-it- grip."
Lawrence Tibbett shares the con
viction of many men that eyes are
a good indication of beauty and
charm. The famous opera singer
adds, "Secondly, I notice her fig
ure, but really to me the eyes re
flect the workings of a harmonious
mentality and pei-sonality."

get-it- grip."
Lawrence Tibbett shares the con
viction of many men that eyes are
a good indication of beauty and
charm. The famous opera singer
adds, "Secondly, I notice her fig
ure, but really to me the eyes re
flect the workings of a harmonious
mentality and pei-sonality."
Realizing that the modern woman
is always interested in knowing how
she looks to the opposite sex, the
editors of a favorite woman's maga
zine recently conducted a poll among
prominent men who enjoy the repu
tation of being among the best
dressed in the country.
The question that was asked was:
"What is it that you first notice
when you meet a beautiful woman?"
The answers were many and varied,
but the following were the outstand
ing ones:
Munro Leaf, creator of "Ferdi
nand," is of the opinion that a
woman's eyes are a dead give
away. However, he adds, "This
doesn't count if she happens to be
walking* in the opposite direction."
DOUG LIKES WHOLE
In Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s esti
mation, the tout ensemble is what
attracts him, more than any one
feature. He adds, "If her voice is
good, I like that, too. But, definitely,
the complete picture!"
Peter Arno, well known socialite
cartoonist., responded to the ques
tion with the following statement:
"A woman's ankles are a key to her
type."
The answer of John Kieran, the
star of "Information, Please," holds
a warning to all devotees of con
spicuous nail polish. "I notice her
fingernails first—with distaste if
they're red. Then I take stock of
her eyes. I guess it's because some
poet once said they're the windows
of the soul!"
JUDGES HAND-SHAKE
McClelland Barclay, famous il
lustrator, does not rely on beauty
in judging a woman, but bases his
opinion of her on her hand-shake.
He says, "I am very conscious of the
hand-shake — whether it's firm, or
cold, or if it's the tell-tale come-and
get-it- grip."
