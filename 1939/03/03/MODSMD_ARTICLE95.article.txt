# Afternoon Frock Has Flared Skirt
## 
### 
To go with the dressy "soft" coats
are a hundred and one new fem
inine afternoon frocks which have
nothing to do with plainer street
dresses. There are soft prints with
gayest colors and plaited skirts and
peeking petticoats. Or there are
monotone frocks with delicately fus
sy, frilly collars and cuffs which we
like to call lingerie touches.
There are lovely dresses with
flared or plaited short skirts made
entirely of suitable lace, and chif
fons and sheers worked up in the
dressy new way. There are dresses
with shirrings and tuckings all over
their elaborate bodices. And with
the dress come capricious accesso
ries which would make the plainest
of them look highly exciting.
