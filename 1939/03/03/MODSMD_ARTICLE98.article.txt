Color treatment in gloves this year
adds new interest, to this depart
ment. Great care in selection must
be given these innovations, so as to
complement the costume and not de
tract from it.

dyed pink on the reverse side, is
embroidered with a pink bow deco
ration on the black.
White doeskins are shown with
pastel walling and fourchcttcs.
A two-tone wine doeskin is shown
with lacing on narrow strips of pink
appliqued leather.
