### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
()NE of the most highly recom
mended items in the catalogue
of international events is the coup
d'etat. Nothing can rival this slick,
convenient mechanism for accom
plishing change with a minimum of
effort.
Without the confusion or mess of
wars and revolutions, coups d'etat
abolish governments and establish
new ones overnight and bother no
one but the men who have lost their
offices. When one contemplates the
horror and devastation of armed
conflict, the value of these bloodless
reforms is most apparent. Why
should life and property be destroy
ed when a little dirty work behind
the scenes will turn the trick?

Within the territory still held
by the Loyalists in Central Spain
two parites exist: one is ready to
surrender to the conquering army
of Generalissimo Franco, believ
ing that continuing the war mere
ly will result in a useless sacrifice
of life; (he other is resolved to
fight the forces of Fascism until
the bitter end.
Now, when the Republican gov
ernment of Premier Juan Negrin did
little besides standing on ground
and nervously shifting its weight
from foot to foot, the do-or-die con
tingent was a bit irked. These ex
tremists could easily have staged a
first class mutiny, butchered a few
of their brothers, and taken over
the leadership of Loyalist Spain.

B U J someone had a good idea.
Realizing the futility of a rev
olution which would only weaken
their cause by destroying resources
and man-power, the leaders of the
Republican army had the brilliant
idea of staging a coup d'etat. For
days they lay low and kept quiet,
awaiting their chance.
And last night it came. Negrin
selected that time to proclaim
himself dictator of the Madrid-
Valencia area. With tact, skill, and
aplomb, remarkable for Spanish
officers, they quietly overthrew
fhe two-hour dictator and set up
a military government of their
own.
Leader of the new Loyalist move
ment is General Segismundo Casado,
who is supported by a seven-man
National Defense Council of a de
cidedly leftist complexion. At mid
night last night he seized the lead
ership of the army, recently vacated
by General Jose Miaja, and told
Premier Negrin to start walking.
Addressing the central Spanish area
over the radio, he assured his listen
ers that the new red Republicans
have no intention of capitulating to
Franco without putting up a good
fight.

AV/'IIILE this story is extremely ex
citing and not uninteresting,
something about it smacks of the
small boy whistling in the dark. For
when the Loyalists make declara
tions of resistance, they are merely
sticking their chins out. For, out
numbering them two-to-one, Gen
eral Franco's better-trained, better
armed forces stand ready to attack
them on the edge of the patch of
territory that still is held the Re
public of Spain.
The Nationalist leader is pre
paring a final ultimatum for the
last-stand boys, and if they fail
to accept they will l»e in for some
pretty rough treatment. The firm
resolution of the Loyalists is en
tirely commendable, but somehow
it seems a little pointless when
one realizes it probably will
amount to suicide.

Starting at midnight last night
General Casado Is the leader of the
Spanish Republic; he will do well
to stay up nights, enjoying his posi
tion because it is almost certain that
he will not hold it long. Fascists
have a habit of winning battles these
days, despite the noble, democratic
motives of the leftists.
Despite the change in leadership
effected by the Loyalist alumni, it
looks like Coach Casado still isn't
going to produce winning teams.
