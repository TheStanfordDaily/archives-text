# Senior Prom Postponed Indefinitely
## Union Refuses to Let Martin Appear Here; Joint Dance Opposed 
### 
With senior class moguls walking
about Saturday with six aerial
bombs in hand, something was
bound to happen. Of course, they
might have been shot off to signal
the signing of Freddy Martin to play
for the Prom.
Instead, they blew up—in the sen
iors' now-red faces. Shortly after
noon, Prom Chairman Chuck Prince
received a telegram from the Music
Corporation of America saying that
union regulations would not permit
Martin to appear on the Farm at the
end of this week.
Apparently, labor trouble at Los
Angeles' Cocoanut Grove, which
might have left Martin free for per
formance here, is still unsettled.
DECISION PENDING
So, the senior class is once more
playing 80-peep to a lost Prom
sheep. Balked twice running in at
tempts to put on a "name-band"
dance, the seniors will be at the
mercy of Ex Committee Tuesday
night when the project of a junior
senior joint prom comes up for final
decision.
Neither junior or senior leaders,
meeting independently Thursday
night, were in favor of such com
bination, feeling that neither class
would profit, that if any other ar
rangement could possibly be worked
out, both groups would be better
satisfied.
FEW POSSIBILITIES
Other possibilities for a Senior
Prom date are few. A second alter
native, once considered, would put
the Prom on the night of April 28.
Later plans have scheduled the
Sophomore Carnival at that time,
shutting out the Prom.
Other suggestions by Cardinals'
Roy Thompson, that, the seniors put
on the Masque Ball of Convalescent
Home Drive seemed definitely dis
carded Thursday night at Senior
Excom meeting.
Juniors, seeking to prevent the
combination with the senior class,
have petitioned Ex Committee to
make the final decision which will
leave the lower class free to carry
on independent plans.
Mixed up as is the whole Senior
Prom business, the one fact stands
clear—there will be no Senior Prom
this Saturday.
