# Brown to Talk Tonight on KGO
## 
### 
The modern philosopher will be
described as a "questioner of all
values" in a radio talk on "The Role
of Philosophy in the Modern World,"
by Professor Harold Chapman
Brown of the Stanford University
Philosophy Department, at 8:30
o'clock tonight over station KGO.
Speaking on the University's
weekly radio program. Dr. Brown
will discuss the place of philosophy
in this period of "doubt and uncer
tainty."
"Since an American philosopher
can hardly accept the system of
values embodied in fascism, he is
thrown back to a re-examination oi
democracy," Dr. Brown said today.
The "re-examination" is made all
the more necessary, he indicated,
because of "new concepts" derived
from Darwin's evolutionary theory,
Einsteinian relativity, and the phi
losophy of Karl Marx.
