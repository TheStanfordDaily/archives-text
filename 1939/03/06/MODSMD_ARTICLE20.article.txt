# Citizens Denied Civil Rights
## 
### 
NEW YORK, March 5 (UP). -
The American Civil Liberties Union
reported tonight after a survey that
Americans enjoy, at best, only about
half the civil rights presumably
guaranteed them.
The survey was conducted under
the guidance of a committee headed
by Richard S. Childs, president of
the City Club of New York, and
covered 332 cities of more than 10,000
population, the Union reported.
Cities were ranked as "very good,"
"good," "fair," "poor," "very poor,"
"bad" and "very bad."
Only Cleveland, New York and St.
Louis achieved the "very good" rat
ing under the standard of compari
son set up by the Union, and even
those cities were able to score no
higher than 50 per cent.
