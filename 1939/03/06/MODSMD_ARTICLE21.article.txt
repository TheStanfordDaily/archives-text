"Nature is not dependent on faith,
reveals power by itself," said Rever
end Thomas E. Oliver, acting chap
lain of the University, in his ser
mon, "The Sacramental Aspect of
Nature," given in the Memorial
Chapel yesterday morning. "Great
mountains and other works of na
ture are symbols of this great
power," he continued. "When we
are distracted by the noise and con
fusion of our man-made world we
go to Nature and the out-of-doors
to make ourselves normal again."
"Nature is not dependt on faith,
hut. gives ofT this stately power
without our belief. It is sacramcntal
because it brings the deeper things
of life to us and releases us from
the bonds of common living," he
eoncludcd.
