# Roosevelt Asks Passage of Air Defense Bill
## Senatorial Critics OF Foreign Policy Impede Measure 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 5 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt meets with his
congressional lieutenants tomorrow
1o determine the status of national
defense legislation and to press for
Senate passage of the army air corps
expansion program which thus far
has been held up by senatorial crit
ics of administration foreign policy.
Mr. Roosevelt, who returned Sat
urday from a Caribbean cruise where
he viewed the largest naval war
Ijiimes in history, is represented as
displeased with the Senate's lack of
action as compared to that of the
House, which already has approved
three major items in the defense pro
gram with scant controversy.
A source close to the White House
said that although Mr. Roosevelt in
tends to adhere to the policy that the
United States must play the role of
international Good Samaritan, he
may be willing to meet his isolation
ist foes half way with assurances
that the administration contemplates
no immediate world-shaking foreign
pronouncement.
Meantime, Senators Arthur Cap
per, K., Kans., and Elbert D. Thomas,
D., Utah, debated the proposed war
referendum amendment over a na
tionwide mutual network tonight.
Capper urged that the people be
given the sole right to declare war
and Thomas argued that such a
course is a radical departure from
this nation's traditional form of rep
resentative government. Represent
ative Hamilton Fish, R., N.Y., also
spoke, attacking the President's for
eign policy in a Columbia network
speech.
The Senate Naval Affairs Commit
tee prepared to begin hearings to
morrow on the $48,800,000 naval air
bases bill approved by the House,
and indications were that the group
will not restore a House-defeated
item for the fortification of Guam,
American-owned island 1,300 miles
from Japan. Inclusion of the item, it
is felt, would draw additional fire
from the isolationists and further
delay the defense program.
