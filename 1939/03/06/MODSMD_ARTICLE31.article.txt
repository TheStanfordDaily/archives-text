### 
"HONOLULU" playing at the Stan
ford Theater
For no social significance what
soever, but for an evening's light
entertainment, "Hopoluiu' 1 is a won
derful movie. "Light" is just the

word for this op
ulent piece of fluff
about a movie ac
tor, his pineapple
planter double,
and a beautiful
dancer.
The old mista
<en identity theme
is always good and
Robert Young in
the dual role plays

both of himsclves beautifully. Best
scene of the picture comes when
Young first meets Young, and the
colored valet, played by Jack Ben
ny's "Rochester," tries to figure the
whole thing out. Old stuff, but pol
ished up with new gags and good
business.
George Burns and Gracie Allen
are their bright and dithery selves,
which is a very good thing for "Ho
nolulu's" sake, but the scenarists de
serve a smart rap on the knuckles
for keeping the pair apart during
most of the picture. Miss Allen's
particular brand of comedy is best
with Burns' stooging.
Eleanor Powell certainly can dance,
but she just as certainly cannot act-
However, by giving' her plenty of
dancing and very little to say, this
point is pretty well glossed over.
Rita Johnson turns in as subtle a
comedy performance as we have seen
lately in the small role of the pine
apple planter's fiancee.
Slight as it is, "Honolulu" man
ages to do what it set out to do—
amuse most of. the general public,
and let Miss Powell dance in beauti
ful Hawaiian settings. That Hawaii
certainly is getting lots of favorable
publicity.—Nowell
