, tions sign a peace pact and unify
under one banner for the common
I good of the people and the country.
The six men chosen by Green and
' Lewis to conduct the negotiations

For the C.1.0.: Lewis, and Vice-
Pi esidents Sidney Hillman and Phil

Serious obstacles—including those
!of dual unionism and an A.F.L.-
! C.1.0. fight over whether any changes
! should be made in the Wagner Labor
1 Relations Act—loomed on the eve
i of the conference.
