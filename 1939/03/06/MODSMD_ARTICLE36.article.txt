: president and president of the Mo- !
I tion Picture Research Council, will !
(address members of the latter or-!
I ganization at a luncheon meeting this I
j afternoon at the Palace Hotel in San i
I Francisco.
Seeking a reform of the type of
i picture now shown over the week- |
j end when children are attending the |
j shows, Dr. Wilbur said in defining !
' the purpose of today's meeting, "We j
| are seeking the development of pic- ;
| tures suitable for children's and fam- !
i ily attendance. At the meeting, we
I shall hear a report based on a study
of the kind of program now being
shown."
Attendance at the meeting will be
made up of delegated representatives ;
from various civic organizations i 1 I
I San Francisco which are interested
j in the problem of suitable film fare I
| for junior movie fans.
Also on the agenda of the movie I
i meeting today is a consideration of |
the "blind selling" bill which is now 1
before Congress. The bill deals with '
the method of booking films under
which the theater manager has little
to say about the quality of a good !
portion of his program. Dr. Wilbur t
expressed the hope that today's
meeting would stimulate inteiest in
the bill.
The Motion Picture Research
Council has been active a number of ,
| years, according to Dr. Wilbur, but
formerly worked from its headquar
ters in Boston and New York. How- j
ever, when Dr. Wilbur took over the '
presidency of the group about four |
years ago, its focal point was shifted â€¢
j to the West.
