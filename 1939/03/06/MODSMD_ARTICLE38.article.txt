## WHOSE AXE YELL? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It sepms to me high time that
Stanford did something to safeguard
its Axe Yell, which it is rapidly
losing. Is this our official yell, or
not? If it is, what right has the
California Student Body to give it
—ever? We never give the Osky
yell.
The Berkeleyites don't mean to
steal something that belongs to us,
but really believe that the yell goes
wherever the Axe goes. Still that
the whole Stanford Student Body
resents their using it can be seen in
its reaction whenever Cal gives it.
Yet we do nothing constructive
about it. Why don't Cardinals or
our yell leaders come to some kind
of a permanent understanding with
the California yell leaders? If the
yell is not ours alone, then we have
no right to boo when U.C. uses it.
If it is our official yell they should
never give' it, and should be so in
formed. If nothing else works we
can copyright it.
But that something should be done
is proved by the fact that when Cal
gave it at the basketball game last
Friday, the radio announcer de
scribed it as "California's yell."
