# Card Cagers Split Series With Bears
## First Games Victory Forces Cal into Tie For Conference Lead 
### 
Stanford's cocky basketball team
knocked California's "wonder team"
into a tie with U.S.C. for the con
ference championship last week-end
by splitting the concluding two
game series with their arch-rivals
from across the bay.
It made no difference that the
Bears won Saturday night's fray in
the Pavilion, 43-.')2, because the
Cards had completed a successful
season the night before at Berkeley
when they walloped the Califor
nians, 39-35, in a game not as close
as the score would seem.
Friday the Indians couldn't make
a wrong play. Everything worked
perfectly. Coach Everett Dean's
three out and two in offensive sep
arated the tall Bears, and Stanford's
low bounce passes into the hole re-

peatedly broke men into the clear
for open shots. But regardless of
play perfection, it was the sensa
tional playing of Captain Phil
Zonne that turned the tide in fa
vor of the Indians.
ZONNE GETS 28
Zotine was high-point man of the
series with 28 points, 13 of which
came Friday night â€” but he also
turned in his greatest game of the
season Friday. He went around Bill
Biggerstaff so many times that
Coach Nibs Price had to jerk the
lanky Bear before the game became
a rout.
Stanford led all the way after the
first few minutes. Ivor Thomas and
Walt Bickerton tacked up field goals
around Harlan Copsey's to give Cal
a 4-2 lead. But Copsey dumped in
another one and sank a free throw
awarded because he was fouled
while shooting, to snap the Cards
into the lead for the rest of the
evening.
BEARS HELPLESS
The Bears could do nothing
against the Deanmen. Each of their
live field goals in the first half, which
ended 17-12, was from outside the
foul circle and Bill Ogilvie, second
high scorer in the conference, had a
grand total of one (1) point to his
credit.
Stanford ran its lead to 22-12 at
the start of the second hall when
the one circumstance occurred that
prevented its victory margin being
wider. Rapp had been making Ogil
vie look absolutely ineffectual but
when he tired the monumental Bear
scored nine points in the space of
five minutes to bring the score to
respectable proportions.
COPSEY MAKES TWO
Once the Bears got as close as 28-
25, but Copsey rang up two field
goals and Dick Lyon another to run
the lead to 34-25. The Bears got
back to within four points, 34-30,
but Zonne and Rapp swished and
Kenny Davidson dropped in a foul
throw to cinch the game.
Another contributing factor to the
Bears' defeat was the way Kenny
Davidson handled Ivor Thomas.
Thomas scored only 7 points Friday
and had a tough time doing that
well. Saturday night Nibs Price
took Thomas out of the game late in
the first half and the Bear forward
sat on the bench the rest of the way.
