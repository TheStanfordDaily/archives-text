# Stanford Shellacks Medics In Practice Rugby Tilt, 29-3
## 
### 
Stanford ruggers proved that the
1 tilt with the Med School on Saturday
i was a practice game for them by
! taking the Medics 29-3 in a fast,
; clean display of rugby.
Dean Johnson started ihe slaugh
! ter by intercepting a lateral in the
first few minutes of the game and
I running half the length of Ihe field
! to make the first try for Stanford.
| Aubrey Austin made the conver
' sion in his usual uncanny accurate
style, bringing the score to 5-0 in
! the early part of the game.
With the game still in its infancy.
Jerry Sparling took the ball over
ihe Medics' goal as a result of a well
executed passing attack by the
Stanford forward line which passed
the ball across the field to Sparling
i in a series of rapid laterals which
! gave him practically an uninter
i rupted run for the goal. Austin
j again came through to make the
| conversion, this time kicking from a
1 difficult side angle.
FREE KICK
A few minutes later Stanford rc
i ceived a free kick as the result of a
i penalty on the Medics and Austin
! made the kick good to add four
j points to the score for a total of 14
points for Stanford. All this sud
den accumulation of points came in
the opening moments of the game,
j proving without a doubt that the
| Stanford ruggers really had the up
| per hand in the game.
Captain Lymie Calkins proved his
t powers as a booter by making a
drop kick through the Medic goal
posts from the middle of the field.
This is a feat he has been trying in
practice for some time, but never
has used during a game, since it is
a hard kick to make with a field of
players pressing close behind.
For the next try Pete Fay and
Howard Hickingbotham teamed up
to carry the ball across the goal to
raise the Stanford score to 21 points,
i Fay pushed the ball within inches of
the goal before he was smeared by
a tide of Med Schol players. Hick
ingbotham look the ball on a lat
eral and smashed through for the
try. Austin continued his accurate
kicking by making the conversion,
: and a short time afterward making
another free kick good for four
more points.

contented themselves with making
one more try to raise the score, 29-0.
Harold Bernard broke through to
make a try early in the quarter with
Austin hreoking his otherwise per
fect record by missing a difficult
angle shot.
For the remainder of the game the
ruggers took a well earned slower
pace, and the Medics managed to
make a touch by kicking the ball
over the goal and falling on it, Mer
ritt making the try, and raising the
score to 29-3 for the final score, the

Howard Hickingbotham teamed up
to carry the ball across the goal to
raise the Stanford score to 21 points,
