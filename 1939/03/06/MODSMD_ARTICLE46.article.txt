# Frosh Hoopmen Win Cal Series
## Farm Yearlings Drop One Game to Cubs 
### 
For the second straight sport ol
the '38-'39 athletic season, Stan
lord's yearlings made up for the
varsity's humbling by California
outfits.
Although they split the week-end
basketball series with the Beareubs,
the Farm freshmen took the cage
championships, two games to one,
having defeated their rivals, 36-24,
last month in the first game.
Coach H. B. Lee had an inspired
band at Berkeley Friday night
when, during the second half, the
frosh came from 'behind to wallop
the Bear frosh, 34-30. Then, with
the series all sewed up, Stanford
dropped Saturday night's game, 34-
28, but Lee used reserves almost ex
clusively and his first string spar
ingly.
Facing a stronger Berkeley team
in Friday's game than the one which
folded in the first tilt, the Papooses
started slowly and were behind 16-
13 at half time. During the second
period the score was tied live times
at 16-16, 18-18, 23-23, 26-26, and
28-28, before Dick Ray put the
freshmen out in front for good with
a shot from the hole. A Cal free
throw narrowed the margin but
Ray sank a foul shot. Again a Cal
player scored a free throw, but
Captain Bill Cowden threw in one
point, and Bob Breckner took a last,
break and sank a set-up as the gun
sounded.
Cowden was the best man on the
floor with his defensive work,
which found him taking care of the
ball oil Cal's own backboard as well
as Stanford's. With the Beareubs
out to even the count in the late
minutes, Cowden swarmed all over
the court, picking up missed Cal
shots. Bob Penn, Dick Ray, Ollie
Hamlin, Lew Reese, and Chuck
Smith played steady ball in the
clutches.
