# Papoose Tankmen Take Two Meets
## 
### 
With eight swimming records, five
of them national collegiate frosh
marks, smashed to smithereens,
those bustin' Stanford Papooses went
to town over the week-end in two
meets, swamping Stockton J. C. Fri
day 47-24, and overwhelming Poly
technic High School Saturday, 46-
27.
On Friday Captain Paul Herron
navigated the 60-yard free in :29.8,
the 440 free in 4:45.7, and anchored
the 400-yard relay team of Young,
Miller, and Dudley, to chalk up three
new national marks and two other
records for the 440. Scott Dudley
established a neat 200-yard breast
stroke course in 2:331.
Saturday, in the 25-yard pool,
Herron, Dudley, and Gardiner Mil
ler swam the 300-yard medley relay
in 3:12.9, setting new national and
Pacific Coast marks. Herron broke
the 100-yard freestyle national rec
ord and Scott Dudley set a new
Stanford pool figure in the 200-yard
breaststroke.
