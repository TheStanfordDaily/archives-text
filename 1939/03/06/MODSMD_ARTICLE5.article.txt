# Prize Play Tells Story Of Musician
## 
### 
Jim Stone's play, "Beginning With
out End," one of the winnei's in
Ramshead's one-act play contest,
was given before a group of Bay
area Stanford alumni at the Athens
Club in Oakland on Feb. 15, nearly a
month prior to its campus produc
tion. It. will be one of the three
plays on a program of prize-winning
one-acts, which will bo given in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall
next Friday and Saturday evenings,
March 10 and 11.
Stone's drama was conceived
around the idea of placing together
a group of strikingly contrasting
characters and watching the natural
results of such a chance meeting.
This is done through a plot which
concerns a young, idealistic musician
in his meeting with a gangster who
has the ability to write really fine
music, but who has no appreciation
of it.

Jim Stone's play, "Beginning With

area Stanford alumni at the Athens
Club in Oakland on Feb. 15, nearly a
month prior to its campus produc
tion. It. will be one of the three
plays on a program of prize-winning
one-acts, which will bo given in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall
next Friday and Saturday evenings,
March 10 and 11.
Stone's drama was conceived
around the idea of placing together
a group of strikingly contrasting
characters and watching the natural
results of such a chance meeting.
This is done through a plot which
concerns a young, idealistic musician
in his meeting with a gangster who
has the ability to write really fine
music, but who has no appreciation
of it.

gram are June Lee Dimmitt's "An
gry Mountain" and Art Levinson's
"Thirty Years." Melba Rae Toombs,
Ramshead's director of one-acts, is
directing all three, with Kae Kalen
born as her assistant.

rector for the plays. The sets were
designed and their building super
vised by him. Stage manager will

his crew include Lois Feldheym,
Bob Leps, Helen Richards, and Mar
garet Grcenwcll, who is in charge
