OVERHEARD from a Cal visitor at the Boat
house Day barbecue: "Why, everyone
seems to know everyone else!"
The Berkeley man was impressed by the
intimacy and informality of the Farm. He had
good cause to think that he was entering a
family picture, for when Stanford wants to be
friendly, it is the friendliest place in the world.
But it isn't easy to talk the student body into
one of its family moods. It takes an efficient
organization to load the campus grapevine
with propaganda which will insure the success
of the event; it takes a well-organized program
that has appeal for 4000 varieties of student.
That all this and more was accomplished last
Saturday is proved by figures, campus opinion,
and the general spirit of the occasion. Boat
house Day was a success.
Ignoring the cold wind and the colder water,
participants in the water sports combined a
good time for themselves with entertainment
for their enthusiastic audience. More than the
2,250 that had been provided for attended the
barbecue and sang the praises of the speedy
service of the hashing crew, the absence of
long waits in line due to Lloyd Wilson's effi
cient, roped-off serving stations. The dance
floor in the Women's Gym was overflowing,
and canoe ticket sales exceeded the most opti
mistic expectations.
At midnight Saturday the Boathouse cele
bration ended, and Stanford unanimously de
clared its approval. To Chairman Bob Moulton,
the campus tendered congratulations for a job
well done, but few knew the thanks they owed
him for his prayers that kept it from raining on
Boathouse Day.—L. L.
