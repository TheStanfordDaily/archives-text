# At Least Be Definite
## 
### 
WITH the juniors and seniors unable to see
eye to eye on the situation, the best thing
to do is drop the idea of a joint dance.
That it could be the best dance of the year is
not admitted, but would be if both classes were
able to let go of the profit idea that seems to
motivate both junior and senior ex committees.
Both have budgets better than other classes
in the same positions. To add profits will be
to accumulate a fund that won't bring much
satisfaction to anybody.
Why not rur; the risk of spending a little
money for a change and get some fun out of it?
However:
The seniors are afraid they will lose prestige.
The juniors allege that the seniors would let
them do all the work and still demand an egual
cut in the profits.
Both are afraid there won't be any profits.
With neither one enthusiastic, therefore, a
joint dance would be sure to be a flopâ€”no mat
ter what orchestra played.
The next move had better be a definite deci
sion from somebody on the deal so that at least
one or both of the classes can begin planning,
so that Excom won't owe both of them apolo
gies, so that whatever happens won't suck the
Associated Students for another $500.
