# To Set a Precedent
## 
### 
WHENEVER Stanfordites hear Cal students
give the Axe Yell most of them go off
on a righteous wrath jag. Today's anonymous
Campus Opinionator is an exception.
Instead of screaming that "it's Stanford's yell
and to hell with Cal," the correspondent recog
nizes the existence of legitimate controversy
over ownership of the yell.
Stanford's general irritation when Cal
shouted "Give 'em the Axe" at the game Fri
day night, however, showed that some settle
ment of the question should be made. And
Stanford's Rally Committee or Axe Society are
the boys to do it.
It is time for them to talk it over with the
proper student leaders at Cal and decide
whether (1) Stanford shall use the Axe Yell
exclusively or 2) the Axe Yell shall follow
the Axe.
If Stanford can convince Cal the first alter

native is the only decent settlement, okay. A
lot of Farm students can't see any other
settlement.
The second alternative wouldn't be so bad,
however. After all, "Give 'em the Axe" does
sound a little irrational when the relic is 40
miles away in somebody else's glass case.
No matter what Rally Committee or Axe
Society members think personally about the
whole thing, they'll do best to negotiate imme
diately for some sort of settlement to replace
the present state of minor anarchy.
And they'll do best to recognize both alter
natives. Telling the other side it's completely
in the wrong is no way to begin any kind of
negotiations.â€”R. D.
