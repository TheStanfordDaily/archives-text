### JOHN COBBS 
YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER
/ |NE of my friends showed me an article the other
day that dispersed my worries about the future of
the University like a policeman breaking up a street
corner crap game. The story was from the current
issue of "Vogue" and consisted of bits of advice on
what Fair visitors can do when they get tired of looking
at combination salad architecture. The sentence that
brought me such comfort read: "Or you'll find deli
cate and fragrant Crepes Suzette at L'Omelette, be
low Palo Alto, which is about thirty miles down the
peninsula—the seat of Stanford University."
Pessimists will say that years of concentrating on
waist lines and skirt lengths have made "Vogue" care
less of geography, that it really meant to say that
Palo Alto was the seat of Stanford. But I can accept
that interpretation only by reading the expression,
"seat of Stanford University," in its most derogatory
sense. I prefer to believe that "Vogue" means what it
said, that it thinks of L'Omelette as the center of
Stanford life.
* * * *
It pleases me tremendously to find that the world
holds this opinion of Farm students. I have been badly
worried about recent unfortunate publicity; and I was
afraid outsiders would get the impression that Stan
ford is a sort of cross between a monastery and a re
form school. It relieves me to find that the world
has not let itself be deceived.
Throughout history, a fundamental part of every
great, university has been a place where the students
could get together for a Crepe Suzette. Ever since the
days of Omar Khayam, progressive educators have
realized that, by hypothesis they can't turn out well
rounded characters unless they permit them to get
around.
* * * *
JN THIS RESPECT Stanford's philosophy has al
ways been essentially sound. The University does
with texts and theses. It knows that education must
not pretend that collegiate life should a full time battle
be leavened with relaxation to make it digestible.
But for the past, year or so, some of our publicity
has been distressing. Word has gotten about that
Stanford is simply a 45 million dollar wet blanket.
# * * m
It is not that we care particularly what the world
thinks of Stanford. We know that we are perfectly
normal and well-adjusted. But with public opinion
against us, the future would be bleak. If people got
the idea lhat the Farm was consecrated only to dreary
investigations of educational back alleys, our next gen
eration would be ruined. The only students we could
get would be sad little psychiatric cases whose main
ambition is to barricade themselves from the world
behind library stacks.
It relieves me, then, to find that people credit us
with better sense than publicity indicates. Stanford's
future is safe as long as the world realizes that we
know where to get good Crepes Suzette.

It is not that we care particularly what the world
thinks of Stanford. We know that we are perfectly
normal and well-adjusted. But with public opinion
against us, the future would be bleak. If people got
the idea lhat the Farm was consecrated only to dreary
investigations of educational back alleys, our next gen
eration would be ruined. The only students we could
get would be sad little psychiatric cases whose main
ambition is to barricade themselves from the world
behind library stacks.
It relieves me, then, to find that people credit us
with better sense than publicity indicates. Stanford's
future is safe as long as the world realizes that we
know where to get good Crepes Suzette.
YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER
/ |NE of my friends showed me an article the other
day that dispersed my worries about the future of
the University like a policeman breaking up a street
corner crap game. The story was from the current
issue of "Vogue" and consisted of bits of advice on
what Fair visitors can do when they get tired of looking
at combination salad architecture. The sentence that
brought me such comfort read: "Or you'll find deli
cate and fragrant Crepes Suzette at L'Omelette, be
low Palo Alto, which is about thirty miles down the
peninsula—the seat of Stanford University."
Pessimists will say that years of concentrating on
waist lines and skirt lengths have made "Vogue" care
less of geography, that it really meant to say that
Palo Alto was the seat of Stanford. But I can accept
that interpretation only by reading the expression,
"seat of Stanford University," in its most derogatory
sense. I prefer to believe that "Vogue" means what it
said, that it thinks of L'Omelette as the center of
Stanford life.

It pleases me tremendously to find that the world
holds this opinion of Farm students. I have been badly
worried about recent unfortunate publicity; and I was
afraid outsiders would get the impression that Stan
ford is a sort of cross between a monastery and a re
form school. It relieves me to find that the world
has not let itself be deceived.
Throughout history, a fundamental part of every
great, university has been a place where the students
could get together for a Crepe Suzette. Ever since the
days of Omar Khayam, progressive educators have
realized that, by hypothesis they can't turn out well
rounded characters unless they permit them to get
around.

be leavened with relaxation to make it digestible.
