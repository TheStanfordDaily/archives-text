### DOUG JAQUES 
SALLY

My friend who goes to the Fair and sees Sally
Rand's Nude Ranch IclLs me that the audience is more
fun to watch than the dames, who wear a few items
of clothes, the most outstanding of which is boots.
I don't know whether lie came to that conclusion
the first time he was there, or not. He didn't say.
But the last time he says there was a very funny
old lady there. She was about 69, very prim, quite
refined looking.
She watched the show for a while, and then said in
quite loud but lady-like voice:
"How disgusting. If I couldn't do better than
that ..."

CONFUSING

A couple of Hall boys wanted a car for a few
hours Saturday night, so they went over to the bas
ketball game to see if they could find a friend who
would let them have a car during the game.
They found one. He gave them the keys, told them
where to find the car.
They did same, drove for two hours, came back,
left, the key in the car, and went about their business.
A few minutes later they met the guy whose car
they had had. He had been looking for them.
"Hey, where are my keys?" he said.
I "In your car."
I "Oh, yeah?"
j Sure, they said, and took him to his car. Only his
car was gone.
And it wasn't his car.
They had been driving the wrong car around. And
had left the keys in the wrong car.
When I heard the story the guy was going around
| frantically trying to borrow a car. He had a date for
I 10:30.
| He still hasn't got his keys back.

LIFE

You may have gathered from what people said
i that the play, "A Night's Lodging," which just fin
| ished a four-day run in the Little Theater, was
j slightly depressing. It reminded a lot of people of
| what a mess Europe and the migrant workers are in.
and all that.
It was after the third act, the act that tends to
[ make you a little ill to the stomach it is so violent,
' that some guy in the back bellowed out:
"I don't care what Mr. Bunn says. After this is
over, I'm going to have a glass of beer."

SALLY

My friend who goes to the Fair and sees Sally
Rand's Nude Ranch IclLs me that the audience is more
fun to watch than the dames, who wear a few items
of clothes, the most outstanding of which is boots.
I don't know whether lie came to that conclusion
the first time he was there, or not. He didn't say.
But the last time he says there was a very funny
old lady there. She was about 69, very prim, quite
refined looking.
She watched the show for a while, and then said in
quite loud but lady-like voice:
"How disgusting. If I couldn't do better than
that ..."

CONFUSING

A couple of Hall boys wanted a car for a few
hours Saturday night, so they went over to the bas
ketball game to see if they could find a friend who
would let them have a car during the game.
They found one. He gave them the keys, told them
where to find the car.
They did same, drove for two hours, came back,
left, the key in the car, and went about their business.
A few minutes later they met the guy whose car
they had had. He had been looking for them.
"Hey, where are my keys?" he said.
I "In your car."
I "Oh, yeah?"
j Sure, they said, and took him to his car. Only his
car was gone.
And it wasn't his car.
They had been driving the wrong car around. And
had left the keys in the wrong car.
When I heard the story the guy was going around
| frantically trying to borrow a car. He had a date for
I 10:30.
| He still hasn't got his keys back.
