# 'LAST SHARP TOUR' PLANNED
## 25 Students to Visit Europe 
### 
Four years ago Dr. Stanley L.
Sharp, of Stanford's German depart
ment, and Mrs. Sharp took a group
of students to Europe "for the first
and last time." Students had a won
derful time, told their friends, and
so by popular request the Sharps
took another group, the second year,
and still another the third.
"Tliis," says Dr. Sharp, of the
party they will take this summer,
"is positively the last time." Aid he
looked a little embarrassed about
what he suspects might be consid
ered weakness of character.
Leaving New York on June 22,
the party will return on Aug. 31,
having visited England, France, Ger
many, including old Austria, Swit
zerland, Italy, Hungary, and Yugo
slavia. Although each of the tours
has included the main points of in
terest, they are sufficiently varied so
that each year Dr. Sharp has several
applications for "repeats," students
who have been t.o Europe once with
the group and want to do it again.
According to Dr. Sharp success of
the trips is attributable to the facts
that they are as inexpensive as it
is possible to make an inclusive
tour, that he takes a congenial group

and makes an effort to even the ]
number of men arid women, and j
that all the students see and do ev- j
erything expected of a European |
traveller without being given a \
cathedral complex.
One more reason might be that;
the Sharps are young, healthy, and j
hard to wear down, and that they i
enjoy the trips almost as much as j
the students they take under their j
wing.
The party will sail on the S.S. j
Statendam and return on the Nieuw |
Amsterdam or the Vollendam. Mem- j
bers of the group can go either third ]
class, at a total cost of $636, or!
tourist for $725. Men, Dr. Sharp has j
discovered, feel they are sissies if I
they don't go third, so he has ar- !
ranged for members of his party to j
take their choice.
Prices for the tours include every- j
thing but the students' fares to New
York, and personal expenses, such i
as laundry and presents on the rest I
of the trip.
Last year's party heard Prime j
Minister Chamberlain speak in the
House of Parliament, did the Lam
beth walk in Itayl, before it hit the

United Stales, drove from Coblcnz
to Wiesbaden through the Tannus
forest, one of the most beautiful
parts of Germany, seldom visited by
tourists.
Students won three out of six
prizes at the ship's fancy dress ball,
watched Dr. Sharp turn magician,
and saw macaroni hung out to dry.
Special attraction of this year's
trip, substituted for last summer's
visit to Scandinavia, is a visit to
Budapest and the seldom-taken trip
from there to Venice through Yugo
slavia, where the group will stop for
two days in Ljublijana.
The Sharps plan to take approx
imately 25 students, and as Dr.
Sharp has a choice of staterooms
on the ocean steamer for only a lim
ited time, applicants are asked to
see him as soon as possible. Pre
ferred space can be guaranteed only
until April 15, and a deposit of $30
is required on reservations.
All interested students should see
Dr. Sharp in office 117 in the Ger
man department, or at his home, 145
Tasso, Palo Alto. His phone num
ber is 7184. Remember, this is the
"last" trip.
