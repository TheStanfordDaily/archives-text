\YTTH their minds busy trying to
solve the mystery of whether or
not there was going to be a Senior
Prom, most Stanford students for
got that yesterday was March 6, the
date picked by the ace foreign cor
respondents and inside dopesters for
a major European crisis.
It is doubtful that the puppeteers
across the Atlantic were trying to
figure out whether or not to get
dates for Friday night, but they
made no move which can be calcu
lated to bring the continent any
closer to armed conflict.
* <|! *
In fact, ralher than starting a
war, Europe finally seems to be
about to witness the end of the
only battle that is still raging. For
the new Loyalist government that
seized the control of central Spain
by a coup d'etat Sunday night has
taken matters firmly in hand and
is conducting negotiations for
peace by radio with General
Franco.
Although it overthrew Negrin's
two-hour dictatorship with avow
als of fighting the Nationalists to the
death, the new Defense Council of
the Republic is now demanding only
peace with honor, i.e., no reprisals
against their leaders and a promise
that, Italian troops will be sent
home. As negotiations for surren
der crackle over the wires between
Madrid and the border of the Loyal
ist zone, Franco's forces stand ready
to start a crushing drive against
their enemies in case a settlement
cannot be reached.
* * *
jyjEANWHILE changes have come
to pass within the midnight gov
ernment. General Casado, who was
the first head of the Defense Coun
cil, has given way to General Jose
Miaja, who was the leader of
Madrid-Valencia armies until he
was deposed by would-be Dictator
Negrin. At this strategic moment,
when the Loyalists are looking for
favors from Franco, Miaja has tak
en a firm anti-Communist stand.
Ousting all leftists from the Re
publican leadership, he has sent
Negrin and his supporters flying
to France, quelled a Communist
revolt in his naval forces at Car
tagena, and is ready to surrender
to the Nationalists if they will ac
cept his terms. Certain it is that
a settlement will come far more
easily with this moderate leader
ship than it could through a
strained Communist-Fascist par
ley.
* * *
Just to show the Republic that he
still means business, General Franco
bombarded Madrid twice yesterday
morning. But he made no further
attack, and he will keep his men
waiting in the trenches until nego
tiations with the Loyalists reach
either an insurmountable impasse—
or success.
Despite the constantly recurring
obstacles that have thus far blocked
the way to surrender, today signs on
the horizons actually point to the
end of civil war in Spain. But in
these times when there is a Cassan
dra on every street corner, it's hard
to put much stock in anything until
it actually happens.

/ 1 ERMANY has been in an ex
tremely dour mood during the
past week. The papal election dis
pleased her, she squabbled with
Poland over the control of Danzig,
and today she sees nothing more

economic decree to insure top

in contact with them.

When der Feuhrer rescinded one
of his anti-Semitic edicts, that is
adequate proof that he considers the
situation as serious. He has also
abolished all nonessential jobs such
as cigarette girls and movie ushers
to insure the productive use of all
Nazi man-power.
Further causes for Hitler's alarm
lie in the visit of the Polish Foreign
Minister to England to confer with
Mr. Chamberlain on what side Po
land is to take in the Fascist-demo
cratic split; a $25,000,000 British loan
to China which is calculated to pre
vent the Japanese from undermin
ing the Chinese currency for the
financial benefit of totalitarian in
vestments; and the threat of rising
prices within Nazi Germany will
mean inflation in the near future.

In fact, ralher than starting a
war, Europe finally seems to be
about to witness the end of the
only battle that is still raging. For
the new Loyalist government that
seized the control of central Spain
by a coup d'etat Sunday night has
taken matters firmly in hand and
is conducting negotiations for
peace by radio with General
Franco.
Although it overthrew Negrin's
two-hour dictatorship with avow
als of fighting the Nationalists to the
death, the new Defense Council of
the Republic is now demanding only
peace with honor, i.e., no reprisals
against their leaders and a promise
that, Italian troops will be sent
home. As negotiations for surren
der crackle over the wires between
Madrid and the border of the Loyal
ist zone, Franco's forces stand ready
to start a crushing drive against
their enemies in case a settlement
cannot be reached.
* * *
jyjEANWHILE changes have come
to pass within the midnight gov
ernment. General Casado, who was
the first head of the Defense Coun
cil, has given way to General Jose
Miaja, who was the leader of
Madrid-Valencia armies until he
was deposed by would-be Dictator
Negrin. At this strategic moment,
when the Loyalists are looking for
favors from Franco, Miaja has tak
en a firm anti-Communist stand.
Ousting all leftists from the Re
publican leadership, he has sent
Negrin and his supporters flying
to France, quelled a Communist
revolt in his naval forces at Car
tagena, and is ready to surrender
to the Nationalists if they will ac
cept his terms. Certain it is that
a settlement will come far more
easily with this moderate leader
ship than it could through a
strained Communist-Fascist par
ley.
* * *
Just to show the Republic that he
still means business, General Franco
bombarded Madrid twice yesterday
morning. But he made no further
attack, and he will keep his men
waiting in the trenches until nego
tiations with the Loyalists reach
either an insurmountable impasse—
or success.
Despite the constantly recurring
obstacles that have thus far blocked
the way to surrender, today signs on
the horizons actually point to the
end of civil war in Spain. But in
these times when there is a Cassan
dra on every street corner, it's hard

only battle that is still raging. For
the new Loyalist government that
seized the control of central Spain
by a coup d'etat Sunday night has
taken matters firmly in hand and
is conducting negotiations for
peace by radio with General
Franco.
Although it overthrew Negrin's
two-hour dictatorship with avow
als of fighting the Nationalists to the
death, the new Defense Council of
the Republic is now demanding only
peace with honor, i.e., no reprisals
against their leaders and a promise
that, Italian troops will be sent
home. As negotiations for surren
der crackle over the wires between
Madrid and the border of the Loyal
ist zone, Franco's forces stand ready
to start a crushing drive against
their enemies in case a settlement
cannot be reached.

jyjEANWHILE changes have come
to pass within the midnight gov
ernment. General Casado, who was
the first head of the Defense Coun
cil, has given way to General Jose
Miaja, who was the leader of
Madrid-Valencia armies until he
was deposed by would-be Dictator
Negrin. At this strategic moment,
when the Loyalists are looking for
favors from Franco, Miaja has tak
en a firm anti-Communist stand.
Ousting all leftists from the Re
publican leadership, he has sent
Negrin and his supporters flying
to France, quelled a Communist
revolt in his naval forces at Car
tagena, and is ready to surrender
to the Nationalists if they will ac
cept his terms. Certain it is that
a settlement will come far more
easily with this moderate leader
ship than it could through a
strained Communist-Fascist par
ley.

Just to show the Republic that he
still means business, General Franco
bombarded Madrid twice yesterday
morning. But he made no further
attack, and he will keep his men
waiting in the trenches until nego
tiations with the Loyalists reach
either an insurmountable impasse—
or success.
Despite the constantly recurring
obstacles that have thus far blocked
the way to surrender, today signs on
the horizons actually point to the
end of civil war in Spain. But in
these times when there is a Cassan
dra on every street corner, it's hard
to put much stock in anything until
it actually happens.

made no move which can be calcu
