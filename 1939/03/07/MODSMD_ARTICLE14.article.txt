CAMPUS FAVORS DANCE
Campus opinion, as reported by
members of Ex Committee, was en
tirely favorable to ihe dance.
"There is really more enthusiasm
this winter quarter than any other I
have seen and if we can possibly con
tribute anything to it I think that it
would be a point in our favor," said
Student Body President H. B. Lee.
Bill Turner pointed out that "the
campus is certainly Freddy Martin
minded, and I think that is about
the biggest factor in making the
dance a success. To prove thatâ€”yes
terday when I heard about the
dance, I went to a phone right away
and called a girl. She said she had
a date, but added that if it was
Freddy Martin, she would break it."
