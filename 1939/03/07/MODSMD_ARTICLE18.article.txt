# NYA Workers Get Extra Hours
## 
### 
In a notice released yesterday from
the Student Employment office, Mrs.
Irene Coverley reminded all under
graduate students on NYA that they
should report to the office today if
they desire to sign up for extra
hours.
In addition, Mrs. Coverley is now
accepting applications of both men
and women undergraduates who
wish to work on NYA until school
is out in June. Applications should
be made promptly.
