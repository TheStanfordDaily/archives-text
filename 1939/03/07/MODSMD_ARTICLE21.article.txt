# SENIORS SIGN MARTIN!
## Friday Grunted To Senior Class For Annual Prom Sale of Bids al $3 Starts Immediately As Music Union Releases Band From Cocoanut Grove Contract 
### 
Definite, conclusive, ultimate, certain, fixed—in short, final—Freddy
Martin will play for the Senior Prom, firmly and indubitably set for this
Friday niijht, March 10.
Campus rumors spreading yesterday that the Prom was on again were
confirmed last night in a special meeting of Executive Committee, when

>the March ]0 date was granted to the
Seniors for their annual Prom.
So, emerging from a hurricane of
bad luck, coincidence and furious
planning, Stanford is set definitely
for a Friday night Prom which prom
ises to be the Farm's biggest winter
quarter function.
New developments followed hard
on the heels of yesterday's announce
ment that Martin would not be avail
able, when Music Corporation of
America telephoned dance chair
man Chuck Price yesterday morn
ing with the message that the New
York office had given Martin final
release from Los Angeles' Cocoanut
Grove, leaving him free to play here
Friday night.
Tentative arrangements to put on
the dance were made immediately
by class president Dave Ryus, to be
followed by an informal meeting of
class and A.S.S.U. leaders yesterday

j afternoon to discuss the project. Af
j ter a two-hour conference which
j found leaders in favor of putting the
Prom through, word was again re
ceived from MCA that the deal was
off. ,
The end of the tangled trail had
j not yet been reached, however, for
i within half an hour, contact was
made by three-way telephone wire
j with Martin in Los Angeles, MCA,
, and Ryus, which culminated in the
| final agreement to bring Martin
j north.
i EX COM MEETS
Bowling plans along with unprecc
j dented enthusiasm, a special Ex
I Committee meeting was called last
I night to confirm arrangements by
| granting the seniors the March 10
date, once okayed, then Canceled
when original arrangements were
dropped several week.s ago.
But harried from pillar to post
by MCA indecision, the Prom is now
a fact, with final confirmation being
made at 8:30 last night with MCA
I to sign the dance band contract,
j COMMITTEES START WORK
Committees, waiting since Friday
to go into action, have already be
gun feverish work which will find
the Pavilion decorated, bids and pro-
I grams printed, posters painted, and
j patrons and patronesses invited by
