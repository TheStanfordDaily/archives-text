## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur addressed members of the Motion Picture Re
search Council yesterday in San Francisco and remarked that some re
form step should lie taken concerning the type of motion picture to which
the .youth of the nation was exposed.
Dr. Wilbur was the only masculine speaker at the meeting which was
held at the Western Women's Club and not at the Palace Hotel as was er-

roneously reported in
Daily.
In hi.s speech, he compared the j
older generation in America with 1
the present one with respect to mu- [
tual assistance in personal and so- j
cial problems and remarked that !
the need for community co-opera- j
lion at present was just as great as)
it was in the past. This is especially ;
true, continued Dr. Wilbur, in the j
matter of bettering the quality of j
productions issued by the motion j
picture industry.
"Today many of our nicely dressed j
children are raised in mental gut- i
tons." Dr. Wilbur continued his re- i
marks and inferred that some of the
movies were a major part of this'
gutter. Speaking of the industry, j
he went on, "We have just let it i
grow without much attention."
The meeting was conductcd by
Mrs. Effingham Sutton, who also \
told of the vigorous program being \
conducted to bring the Neely Bill I
out onto the floor of the Senate in !
order that the bill, which would
remedy the evils of the block- 1
booking, may be passed.
i! w s also suggested that an en- !
deavor be made to stop production j
of a film of the life of John Dil
linger.
