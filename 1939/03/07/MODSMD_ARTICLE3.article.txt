# Heffner Chosen New Drama Head
## Northwestern Man Will Assume Duties In Autumn Quarter 
### 
Appointment of Professor Hubert
Crouse HefTner, of Northwestern
University, to be executive head of
Stanford's Division of Speech and
Drama, beginning next autumn
quarter, was anounced by Dr. Wil
bur today.
Not entirely unknown to Farm
students, Professor HefTner was on
the Stanford faculty during the
summer of 1937, when he directed
"Twelfth Night," the first produc
tion in the Memorial Theater. At
Northwestern he was professor of
dramatic literature and chairman
of the governing body of the Uni
versity Theater. Northwestern has
developed one of the most important
schools of speech and drama in the
United Slates.
"Professor HefTner is interested in
student play writing, and will un
doubtedly put on a good many of
them here," stated Professor Lee
Emerson Bassett, emeritus head of
the Department of Speech and
Drama. '"He is interested in the
whole speech field, and is not a 'one
track' man at all," Professor Bassett
added.
The new professor has two de
grees from the University of North
Carolina and was on the faculty of
that school before going to North
western. He was also associate di
rector and manager of the "Carolina
Players" which annually makes
tours of southern cities.
Before joining the North Carolina
faculty, Professor HefTner taught at
the Universities of Wyoming and
Arizona.
Commented Dr. Bassett on the ap
pointment, "He is well trained, a
good administrator, just, and per
sonable. I am very pleased wtih the
choice."
