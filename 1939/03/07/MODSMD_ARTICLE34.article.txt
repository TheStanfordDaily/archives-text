# Igor Gorin Will Present Varied Program Tomorrow
## 
### 
Including two of his own compositions in the varied program which
he will present in Memorial Hall tomorrow night Igor Gorin will sing
songs of Russia. France, Italy and Germany.
Although the Russian baritone was horn in the Ukraine and received
his musical education at the iVenna Conservatory of Music, he feels that

today it is America which
the best opportunity for serious
music and musicians.
"The ;countries of Europe may
have older musical heritages, but
while they are preoccupied with po
litical hatred and strife, America is
building up a musical heritage for
the future that will be richer than
any," says the young baritone.
Beginning screen and radio ca
reers in America, Gorin at first
could not persuade his sponsors to
let him get away from the popular
music of the day. But "Hollywood
Hotel" fan mail son proved that his
audience preferred opera and light

â™¦
! opera selections to jazz and swing.
Gorin is famed for his unique in
j terpretations of Russian music,
which have already earned him the
title of "the young Chaliapin." Many
of these selections will be included
i in tomorrow night's program.
Tickets for the performance are
still on sale at the Concert Series
oflice at $2.
