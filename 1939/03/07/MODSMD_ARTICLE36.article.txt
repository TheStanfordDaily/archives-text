# H.C. Brown Talks On Philosophy

### 
Professor Harold Chapman Brown
of the Stanford University philoso
phy department spoke on "The
Role of Philosophy in the Modern
World" on the regular Stanford ra
dio hour over station KGO last
night.
"It follows that every philosophy
arises out of a social station and is
conditioned by the mastery of na
ture that its era permits," he stated.
"For philosophers, interest in the
direction of tendencies and in dy
namics of conflict are coming to take
precedence over interest in the
static.
"Pierce and James brought phi
losophy out of the class room and
study to the world of affairs; Dewey
unleashed it as a social force," said
Professor Brown. "Their successors
are reshaping it as an instrument for
the preservation of democratic way
of life in a world in which scientific
knowledge is the instrument through
which men attain their ends and
their method, collective action. Such
is the role marked out for philoso
phy in the modern world of
America."
