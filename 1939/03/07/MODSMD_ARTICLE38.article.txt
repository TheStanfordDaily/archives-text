THERE ARE a couple of stories
which tie in with Stanford's upset
victory over California last Friday
at Berkeley that are interesting if
for no other reason than the em
barrassment they caused over across
the bay.
It seems early last week when
there was some doubt whether Bill
Rapp, Stanford guard, would be in
shape to play against the Califor
nians because of his eye injury.
Coach Nibs Price gave an informal
little speech before a small body of
Cal students.
Said Price, "I hope Rapp plays,
1 ecnuse if he doesn't Stanford might
find a good man to take his place."
Thereupon, Rapp preceded to open
Nibs' eyes by making a monkey out
of Bill Ogilvie, Cal's statuesque
(statues don't move much either)
center. In Friday's game Bill held
Ogilvie to one free throw until early
in the second half when his lack
of condition caught up with him.
When Rapp tired, Ogilvie popped
thiej in the space of a few minutes,
so Everett Dean jerked him to give
him a rest. Back he came after a
brief tenure on the bench to once
a&ain hold Ogilvie down.
Saturday night "the man who
Stanford might find a good man to
replace" held Ogilvie to two points
during the entire game.
All we can say is, if Rapp is as
bad as Price thinks he is, then Nibs
certainly has his nerve nominating
Ogilvie for the all-conference team.
•Jt i|( •!'
WHICH BRINGS us around to the
other story. It seems that Ogilvie,
Ivor Thomas, and Bill Biggerstaff
are all susceptible to a little riding
-especially Thomas. So Stanford
really gave the Bears a ride for their
money.
"What tram you boys going to
take to Oregon," the Indians kept
muttering to the Bears. And as the
game progressed and that train ride
to Oregon started getting further
and further away, Cal started crack
ing wide open.
Thomas, called the "Mad Russian"
I ecause of his first name, was really
.netting mad because of the effective
way Kenny Davidson was guarding
him. Finally Thomas blew sky high
late in the game and bore down
from behind on Davidson and
started to slug him with his fore
arm.
That was Thomas' fourth personal
foul, sending him to the sidelines.
But Saturday night, right off the
bat, Davidson whispered to the Cal
forward, "Hey, Ivor, are you going
to tie up again tonight?" That did
the trick. Thomas played so poorly
that Price jerked him late in the
first half and kept him on the bench
the rest of the game.
* * *
ANY WAY you look at it the
play-off tilt between the Bears and
Trojans should be a pip. U.S.C. got
three men on the all-conference
team to Cal's one—Ogilvie, but you
can't count the Bears out if for no
other reason than § heir height.
However, Cal off its performance
against Stanford doesn't figure to
beat t hi> rapidly improving Trojan
team. In fact, if Stanford can stop
the Bears with a little ribbing, U.S.C.
might easily trounce the Bears —
provided they know about the
weakness.

find a good man to take his place."
Thereupon, Rapp preceded to open
Nibs' eyes by making a monkey out
of Bill Ogilvie, Cal's statuesque
(statues don't move much either)
center. In Friday's game Bill held
Ogilvie to one free throw until early
in the second half when his lack
of condition caught up with him.
When Rapp tired, Ogilvie popped
thiej in the space of a few minutes,
so Everett Dean jerked him to give
him a rest. Back he came after a
brief tenure on the bench to once
a&ain hold Ogilvie down.
Saturday night "the man who
Stanford might find a good man to
replace" held Ogilvie to two points
during the entire game.
All we can say is, if Rapp is as
bad as Price thinks he is, then Nibs
certainly has his nerve nominating
Ogilvie for the all-conference team.
•Jt i|( •!'
WHICH BRINGS us around to the
other story. It seems that Ogilvie,
Ivor Thomas, and Bill Biggerstaff
are all susceptible to a little riding
-especially Thomas. So Stanford
really gave the Bears a ride for their
money.
"What tram you boys going to
take to Oregon," the Indians kept
muttering to the Bears. And as the
game progressed and that train ride
to Oregon started getting further
and further away, Cal started crack
ing wide open.
Thomas, called the "Mad Russian"
I ecause of his first name, was really
.netting mad because of the effective
way Kenny Davidson was guarding
him. Finally Thomas blew sky high
late in the game and bore down
from behind on Davidson and
started to slug him with his fore
arm.
That was Thomas' fourth personal
foul, sending him to the sidelines.
But Saturday night, right off the
bat, Davidson whispered to the Cal
forward, "Hey, Ivor, are you going
to tie up again tonight?" That did
the trick. Thomas played so poorly
that Price jerked him late in the
first half and kept him on the bench
the rest of the game.

ANY WAY you look at it the
play-off tilt between the Bears and
Trojans should be a pip. U.S.C. got
three men on the all-conference
team to Cal's one—Ogilvie, but you
can't count the Bears out if for no
other reason than § heir height.
However, Cal off its performance
against Stanford doesn't figure to
beat t hi> rapidly improving Trojan
team. In fact, if Stanford can stop
the Bears with a little ribbing, U.S.C.
might easily trounce the Bears —
provided they know about the
weakness.

THERE ARE a couple of stories
which tie in with Stanford's upset
victory over California last Friday
at Berkeley that are interesting if
for no other reason than the em
barrassment they caused over across
the bay.
It seems early last week when
there was some doubt whether Bill
Rapp, Stanford guard, would be in
shape to play against the Califor
nians because of his eye injury.
Coach Nibs Price gave an informal
little speech before a small body of
Cal students.
Said Price, "I hope Rapp plays,
1 ecnuse if he doesn't Stanford might
find a good man to take his place."
Thereupon, Rapp preceded to open
Nibs' eyes by making a monkey out
