SAN FRANCISCO, March 6 (UP).
—Business must lx: given more than
promises of "breathing spells" from
the government before it can accel
erate the return of prosperity, Ed- j
ward J. Harding, national director of I
the Associated General Contractors j
of America told the 20th annual con- j
vent ion of the organization today.
"Business can't be expected to go ;
forward with the task of restoring j
buying power through expanded ac- j
tivit.ies if it. fears the breathing
spells are mere rests between rounds
of federal intervention, Harding said.
After several years of condemna
tion, industry cannot be reconciled
to indefinite, cautious commitments
and tentative overtures, he asserted.
A definite commitment from Wash
ington on business policy and an
irrevocable pledge of co-operation is
all that business needs ot assume
leadership in the drive for recovery,
Harding said.
