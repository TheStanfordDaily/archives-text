# Footballers Head for New Track Marks
## 
### 
Dink Templeton's pet pupils, his
weightmen, are beginning, as is their
habit about this time of the year, to
make track fans sit up and take
notice.
Big Pete Zagar led the parade in
the discus with a bombing toss of
160 feet in practice yesterday. Fol
lowing him is another ex-football
player, fast-improving Hamp Pool,
who has now approached 140 feet.
In the shot, it is another of Tiny
Thornhill's beef trusters, Stan An
derson, who captured the limelight
of the recent indoor meet on Treas
ure Isle with a put of 52 feet 6
inches. Anderson now has plenty of
strength but little form, and when
he develops the latter it is no telling
how far he will toss the iron ball.
Consistent and polished. Bill
Wohle has a mark of 51 feet 3
inches to his credit for the current
season. Behind him are Allen Grey
at 49 feet and fast-improving Bill
Trout, close to 48.
