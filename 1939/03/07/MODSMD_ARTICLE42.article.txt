# League Rugby Standings Hinge on Cal Game Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford ruggers will put in some
intensive practice this week to pre
pare themselves for the important
match with Cal next Saturday. If
they take this game they will win
the intercollegiate championship for
the Pacific Coast.
So far this season the Cards have
beaten all comers, including U.S.C.,
who smeared Cal two weeks ago by
a substantial score. This doesn't
mean too much, according to Coach
Will Classen, because Cal really
outplayed the Trojans for the bal
ance of the game. U.S.C. won the
game on a fluke if anything.
On the other hand the Stanford
ruggers have been improving with
practice as the game Saturday
against Stanford Medical School
showed. While the Medics weren't

; a very strong team, they did give
the Cards a chance to try out some
! of the things they have been prac
; ticing on all season.
The drop kick which Captain
I Lymie Calkins used so successfully
j from center field and the rapid fire
pasing attack which netted the Cards
| a good many points ase good exam
| pies of this.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur will start
the game against Cal Saturday by
making the kick-off, according to
j Hai'ry Maloney. Dr. Wilbur is an
; honorary president of the Northern
I Rugby Union, and has taken a great
i deal of interest in the game. Dr.
! Robert Gordon Sproul, president of
i the University of California, is an
I honorary vice-president of the Un
i ion and another rugby fan.
