# Card Tankmen To Meet Trojans
## 
### 
One of the biggest swimming
meets to be held in the Stanford
Pools will start this Friday after
noon at 4 o'clock when the Card
varsity renews a heated rivalry
with the powerful Trojan mermen
from U.S.C.
With what is reputed to be the
greatest team in the history of their
institution, the Trojans are heavy
favorites to cop the Southern Divi
sion conference championship and
sink the Card men this Friday. In
past dual meets S. C. has defeated
Stanford three times, and two of
those three by only one point.
Led by Captain Paul Wolfe, mem
ber of the 1936 Olympic team and
world's champion in the 50-yard
free style, the Trojans have a very
strong and well balanced team.
Wolfe has also been a member of
the United States team that traveled
to Japan in 1935 and 1938, which
was composed of the cream of the
country's swimmers. The meet will
start at the Encina Pools at 4 o'clock
Friday afternoon. Admission will be
25 cents with a student body card.
