Intramural Manager Andy Stojkovich is planning big things for the
night of the finals of the intramural hoop tournament. Of course the fea
ture attraction of the evening will be the big match between A.T.O.\ high
scoring cagcrs and Sigma Chi's giant killers.
In the preliminary game, starting at 7:!Â»0 o'clock, the Japanese A. C. will
meet the Chinese A. C. in a game bound to be full of thrills and spills.

Color will be added by the promM
nent set of referees that have been
obtained. H. B. Lee, freshmen bas
ketball coach and A.S.S.U. presi
dent, will couple with his former
team-mate. Jack Calderwood. all
coast guard, to handle the prelim

In the featured battle, Dean of
Men and former varsity coach. John
Bunn, and last year's frosh mentor,
Wytze Gorter will do the whistle
toting.
There is an important meeting of
all intramural managers tonight in
the Nitery at 9:30 to discuss the

hoop games. Only four points apart,
they tanked 87 and 83 digits, re
spectively.
