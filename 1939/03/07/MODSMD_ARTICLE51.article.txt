## 
### 
Stanford fencers took the wrong
end of the score this week-end, los
ing to Cal foilmen 14-11 in the var
sity matches, and 6-3 in thi> frosh
tilts. Herb Woolley, John Cooper,
and Dick Meyerhoff won three
bouts apiece to tie honors for top
score for the Cards, and Francis
Bray and Edwin Gust snared a point
apiece.
The matches were closer than the
[ final score thows. Three of the
matches were decided after the
j Cards had fought their opponents to
! a 4-4 tie and then lost the last bout
I by a whisker, according to Coach
! Elwyn Bugge.
The frosh weren't expected to
j come through with any great hon
i ors because of their lack of experi
| ence. They did the best they could
i under the circumstances, however,
according to Coach Bugge.
