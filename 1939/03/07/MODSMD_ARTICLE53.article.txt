# On Again, DEFINITELY
## 
### 
THEY'VE pulled it out of the bag.
Freddy Martin definitely will play for the
Senior Prom on Friday night.
It's going to be a big dance—and really let
it go.
Answering the objections of Ex Committee
on every point, the seniors finally received
approval for what promises to be the big dance
of the year.
Looking to the future, it doesn't appear that
any other dance will be able to sign a band as
good as Martin's.
Certainly, the Farm hasn't had a band as good
as his during the last year. And wilh Martin
hot from Cocoanut Grove, the smoothest band
on the Coast actually aching to play for Stan
ford, it's hard to see how the seniors are going
to lose.
The dance comes at the last possible moment
before finals, but that's no detraction. Evi
dently, Stanford would like to forget them if
possible, for public opinion seems to be all
for the dance.
And if minority opinion doesn't favor the
dance, it should soon, for the enthusiasm of
dance. Spur -of - the - moment enthusiasm may
it's catching. It's catching fast and even if
campus telephone operators do sweat overtime
for the next two days the effort will be worth it.
Particularly appealing about the dance is
the lack of trick gags, themes, and assorted
side-trappings. It will remain smooth, it will
not have elaborate decorations, it will have
plenty of soft lights, it will have a smooth or
chestra and smooth music.
It won't be cluttered up by the usual amount
of forced paraphernalia that causes many
dances to bog down by talking people into
things they doin't want to do.
Accused of inefficiency by the juniors when
a joint dance was proposed, the senior class
yesterday removed that stigma by setting the
machinery in motion.
Feasability of the dance already has been
decided, both by Excom and the seniors. In
regard to this, shortness of time was listed as
the most important factor for not holding the
dance; but, when questioned, even the Prom's
strongest critics indicated they would attend
if the dance were actually scheduled and that's
the final basis for decision.
Granting that the time is short, it's not defi
nite that such is not a point in favor of the
dancie. Spur-of-the-moment enthusiasm will
make a better function out of it than if it had
been planned for weeks or days in advance.
The Prom fits into the back-to-Stanford spirit
started by Boathouse Day.
It's for the University as a whole and the
University can, if it will, let itself go for a last
good time before the seriousness demanded by
March 21-24.
It's a big mouthful—it can be chew

regard to this, shortness of time was listed as
the most important factor for not holding the
dance; but, when questioned, even the Prom's
strongest critics indicated they would attend
if the dance were actually scheduled and that's
the final basis for decision.
Granting that the time is short, it's not defi
nite that such is not a point in favor of the
dancie. Spur-of-the-moment enthusiasm will
make a better function out of it than if it had
been planned for weeks or days in advance.
The Prom fits into the back-to-Stanford spirit
started by Boathouse Day.
It's for the University as a whole and the
University can, if it will, let itself go for a last
good time before the seriousness demanded by
March 21-24.
It's a big mouthful—it can be chew
THEY'VE pulled it out of the bag.
Freddy Martin definitely will play for the
Senior Prom on Friday night.
It's going to be a big dance—and really let
it go.
Answering the objections of Ex Committee
on every point, the seniors finally received
approval for what promises to be the big dance
of the year.
Looking to the future, it doesn't appear that
any other dance will be able to sign a band as
good as Martin's.
Certainly, the Farm hasn't had a band as good
as his during the last year. And wilh Martin
hot from Cocoanut Grove, the smoothest band
on the Coast actually aching to play for Stan
ford, it's hard to see how the seniors are going
to lose.
The dance comes at the last possible moment
before finals, but that's no detraction. Evi
dently, Stanford would like to forget them if
possible, for public opinion seems to be all
for the dance.
And if minority opinion doesn't favor the
dance, it should soon, for the enthusiasm of
dance. Spur -of - the - moment enthusiasm may
it's catching. It's catching fast and even if
campus telephone operators do sweat overtime
for the next two days the effort will be worth it.
Particularly appealing about the dance is
the lack of trick gags, themes, and assorted
side-trappings. It will remain smooth, it will
not have elaborate decorations, it will have
plenty of soft lights, it will have a smooth or
chestra and smooth music.
It won't be cluttered up by the usual amount
of forced paraphernalia that causes many
dances to bog down by talking people into
things they doin't want to do.
Accused of inefficiency by the juniors when
a joint dance was proposed, the senior class
yesterday removed that stigma by setting the
machinery in motion.
Feasability of the dance already has been
decided, both by Excom and the seniors. In

the most important factor for not holding the
