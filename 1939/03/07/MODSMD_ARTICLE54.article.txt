# The 						Octopus

AS Stanford wallowed knee-deep in democ
iacy last Saturday, only one capitalistic
note of discord crept into the harmony of the
merriment and madness. Up on the glassed-in
sun deck of the Boathouse, coiled like a venom
ous serpent above the coin slot of the coke ma
chine was a tiny sign—lo cents.
It is pitiable that the jollity of the occasion
should have been interrupted by this single
sign of the inevitability of the fall of the
system. One by one thirsty students advanced
to the shiny red monster, ready to exchange
a nickel for the pause that refreshes. One
after another they turned away disillusioned,
muttering threats of sabotage, and walked to
the Union.
Despite the inviting partitioned crates below
the machine and the existence of the honor
code, a student who sacrifices a dime for a
coke is legally entitled to keep the bottle as a
souvenir, use it for home brew, or return it to
a down-town grocery for two or three cents.
When an identical vending machine delivers
cokes of uniform guality for five cents in the
men's halls and profit-minded house managers

soli them lor six cents, it seems a bit out of
keeping to charge 10 cents for the same serv
ice at the Boathouse.
Now anyone will tell you that a glass of
milk costs 25 cents at Del Monte and a scotch
and soda costs 75 at the Stork Club, but in both
cases the sucker is paying for swank and serv
ice.
The short history and long tradition of the
Boathouse reek of democratic principles. Built
by the students as a gift to the University, its
equipment should serve no end other than
student convenience. It was designed not for
an exclusive cocktail lounge, but as a water
sports center.
Let Ex Committee legislate for the return of
the five-cent coke before the student body
starts rolling out the tumbrils and setting up the
guillotines.
Stanford, whose formative years have over
flowed with social legislation, will never bow
to prices set according to a standard of all the
traffic can bear.—L. L.
