### JOHN COBBS 
GET YOUR OWN YELL
IT APPEARS from yesterday's Campus Opinion col
umn that Stanford and Cal are working around to
another border skirmish over the ownership of the
Axe Yell. The situation is hardly tense enough to
permit any speculation about looming war clouds; and
if it ever gets beyond the letters-to-the-editor stage,
it can be solved by diplomatic negotiations. But it
annoys me to hear that Cal is persisting in policy of
highjacking our yell.
There are, of course, arguments on both sides,
which explains why my views are temperate enough
to be put into print. And in these days of dictators
and ingrown national honor, a piece of minor imper
ialism like this is hardly worth mentioning.
* * * *
Even so, I resent the smug way California has ap
propriated our yell. It reminds me of a nasty little
boy making himself obnoxious by imitating his betters.
California, I should think, would have more pride
than to display a purloined yell as its own. Surely
a student body as large as Cal's can think up a few
decent cheers for itself. And even in these days when
bashful rooting sections hesitate to raise their voices
above a murmur, it is hard to believe that the Axe
Yell is the only one that will get a response out of
Berkeley.
$ * >Ji >fi
AS FAR as I can soe, Cal uses the cheer only be
cause it wants to .remind us that it has the Axe.
But this is hardly the sporting spirit on which em
pires are built. When I was growing up, it was con
sidered bad manners to crow about winning a game.
A yell, by its nature, is as much private property
as a toothbrush. Supposedly it is loaded with emotion
and sentiment, qualities which are not freely trans
ferable. A cheer cannot belong to two opposing
schools without losing its effectiveness for both. And
the Axe Yell is too good to be depreciated into a mere
mechanism for being impolite.
# * # *
This comment, I realize, follows in the well beaten
path all college writers are supposed to use. But the
patriotism in this case arises not from any over-active
school spirit, but from ordinary annoyance.
I realized also that Stanford will rock along very
nicely, regardless of what noise patterns Cal uses to
strain its voice. On a scale as small as this, even
piracy is no occasion for calling out the militia.
But after all, the Axe Yell does belong to Stanford.
And even if highjacking isn't considered illegal, it is
certainly bad taste.

GET YOUR OWN YELL
IT APPEARS from yesterday's Campus Opinion col
umn that Stanford and Cal are working around to
another border skirmish over the ownership of the
Axe Yell. The situation is hardly tense enough to
permit any speculation about looming war clouds; and
if it ever gets beyond the letters-to-the-editor stage,
it can be solved by diplomatic negotiations. But it
annoys me to hear that Cal is persisting in policy of
highjacking our yell.
There are, of course, arguments on both sides,
which explains why my views are temperate enough
to be put into print. And in these days of dictators
and ingrown national honor, a piece of minor imper
ialism like this is hardly worth mentioning.

Even so, I resent the smug way California has ap
propriated our yell. It reminds me of a nasty little
boy making himself obnoxious by imitating his betters.
California, I should think, would have more pride
than to display a purloined yell as its own. Surely
a student body as large as Cal's can think up a few
decent cheers for itself. And even in these days when
bashful rooting sections hesitate to raise their voices
above a murmur, it is hard to believe that the Axe
Yell is the only one that will get a response out of
Berkeley.

AS FAR as I can soe, Cal uses the cheer only be
cause it wants to .remind us that it has the Axe.
But this is hardly the sporting spirit on which em
pires are built. When I was growing up, it was con
sidered bad manners to crow about winning a game.
A yell, by its nature, is as much private property
as a toothbrush. Supposedly it is loaded with emotion
and sentiment, qualities which are not freely trans
ferable. A cheer cannot belong to two opposing
schools without losing its effectiveness for both. And
the Axe Yell is too good to be depreciated into a mere
mechanism for being impolite.
# * # *
This comment, I realize, follows in the well beaten
path all college writers are supposed to use. But the
patriotism in this case arises not from any over-active
school spirit, but from ordinary annoyance.
I realized also that Stanford will rock along very
nicely, regardless of what noise patterns Cal uses to
strain its voice. On a scale as small as this, even
piracy is no occasion for calling out the militia.
But after all, the Axe Yell does belong to Stanford.
And even if highjacking isn't considered illegal, it is
certainly bad taste.
