FRUSTRATION
He was over at the Library, and from all outward
appearances he was not too sane and was becoming
less sane every minute.
Witnesses say they have seldom seen anyone go
.through the shelves and handle so many books in one
day in their lives. All afternoon he was there, back in
the stacks, out in the reference room, all over.
All of a sudden all of the spirit went out of him.
He stopped his frantic running around. Slowly he
went down the steps.
A friend saw him. "What's the matter?" he asked.
The frantic one explained. He had been tearing
the Library inside out (figure of speech) all after
noon—to find, at long last, in the Libe records that the
book was charged to him, and that it was overdue.

A couple of Row boys recently introduced a new
angle into the spur-of-the-moment-blind-date rou
tine.
They called up the French House one night (after
calling up quite a few sororities first and tried to make
a deal. We want a couple of girls, they said. We have
a car, plenty of gas, but no money. We want a couple
of girls with enough money to take all four of us
to the show.
It's a fair angle, I would say.
But the whole thing ended disappointingly to ev
eryone. Some guy who was hanging around the
French house grabbed the phone and said he was John
Bunn and what did the boys want.
Everyone hung up.

One Farm boy will not be in class Friday.
Centervilie's policeman arrested him the other day
for a small offense, and fined him.
"But that's too much," the Farm boy said.
One Farm boy will be in jail all day Friday.

PARTY.
I heard of a strange Roble custom the other day.
At odd limes groups of girls—there were eight girls
the last time—go into one room and sleep on the floor.
They gather up a lot. of mattresses and spread them
on the floor. They bring in some ice cream and pickles
and stuff, and have a feast.
Then they lie down on the floor and go to sleep.
Eight of them in a small room, and they go to sleep.
It's their idea of a party.

In Ex Committee the other night, they were talking
about whether they should have a dance March 10.
Someone brought up the date question. Several people
thought it would be easy to get a date on a week's
notice.
"Yes," one girl was heard to say, "there are a lot
of women in Lagunita."
Hardly anyone else, I would say.
