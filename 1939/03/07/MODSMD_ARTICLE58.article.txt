## FIRE HAZARD 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Not that we are alarmists, or have
a case of Roble hysteria, BUT the
lack of suitable fire escapes in En
cina is extremely dangerous. Should
a fire sweep up the stairway, we in
the Bull-Pen would be roasted alive.
There would be no chance of escape,
for the strong bars on our windows
make exit by net or ladder impos
sible. Worse than this, the door la
beled "fire ladder to the attic,"
leads only to a windowless death
trap.
The chances are that all Encina
men will go to hell anyway, but let
us choose our own method of getting
there.
Assuming that Stanford is a pro
gressive school, we feel that some
thing will be done to correct this
dangerous situation at once.
Yours truly
