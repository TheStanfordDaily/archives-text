The Editor, Sir:
I would very much like to use
The Daily as a medium to express
my appreciation to those who gave
their assistance on Boathouse Day.
Since there were between 125 and
150 people who contributed to what
ever success the day enjoyed it is
impossible for me to thank them all
personally.
I would also like particularly to
thank The Daily for its co-opera
tion. I believe BoMhouse Day re
ceived finer publicity than any simi
lar campus event has for a long
time.
Sincerely,
Bob Moulton
