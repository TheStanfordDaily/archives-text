### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
W/'HAT will happen when the dic
tators die? One can't help won
dering just how much of the power
of the totalitarian states lies in the
personal power of their leaders and
how much depends on the funda
mental stability of the fascist form
of government.
If someone shot Hitler or Mus
solini today, would the German and
Italian absolutisms be able to stand
the blow? The answer of late has
been the subject of considerable
conjecture. The speculation started
when an unusually convincing char
latan circulated the rumor that Hit
ler is really dead and a well-trained
double has been taking his place for
several years.

This story, whether the product
of wishful thinking or an over
active imagination, is definitely
not true. But still the prospect of
either a Fcuhrer-less Germany or
a Ducc-lcss Italy provides a most
amusing mental game. Dozens of
speculators will answer the ques
tion with a list of great despots in
history whose power crumbled
almost as soon as they were dead.
But the great majority of these
men, Alexander, Charlemagne, Na
poleon, and assorted lesser lights,
built empires by conquering nations
whose cultural and intellectual de
velopment equaled and sometimes
surpassed theirs. It was the sheer
force of the personalities and ge
niuses of these world-shaking fig
ures that held their dominions to
gether. With their deaths, the fall
of their empires was inevitable.
m * $
r CODAY the situation is different.
The dictators are not conquerors
on the grand scale. Each of them is
trying to dominate the map of Eu
rope by the sheer force of his own
country and his own people with
only incidental aid from a few well
chosen allies. Both Hitler and Mus
solini. have created great powers
form nations pushed into back seats
by the Treaty of Versailles.
We must turn to Soviet Russia
for the only available example of
a modern European government
that survived the death of the
man who was its dynamo. Today
the body of Lenin lies embalmed
under glass in his tomb in Red
Square, but the totalitarian state
that he created remains unshaken
with Josef Stalin at the controls.

Yesterday Captain Fritz Weid
mann, the new German consul to
San Francisco and a personal friend
of Hitler's, revealed that a succes
sor has already been selected to
carry on the Nazi rule in the Reich.
Naturally his name was not re
vealed.
But, could a Goering or a Goeb
bels, or some other German whose
name has not yet come to light, car
ry on the iron-clad rule of Adolf
Hitler? Critics brand der Feuhrer a
fiend, a sadist, a mad man, but
none deny that he is capable of
miracles. With one all-powerful
weapon, propaganda, he has made
his policies and his name into a na
tional religion.

VV'IIEN Hitler and Mussolini die
they will probably be given
the most magnificent funerals in
history. A few days later Nazi
and Fascist leaders will form cen
tral councils with the intention of
carrying on undisturbed the rule
of their dead dictators.
It is then that the suppressed
minorities will start to rattle their
chains; it is then that communists
and liberals will once again gather
in garrets and spell out the end of
the absolute power which was born
and had died in the mind of a single
man.
In the world of actualities, yes
terday Spanish communist counter
revolutionaries continued 1o make
trouble for the new moderate Loy
alist, government. The Republicans
divided their attention between try
ing to come to terms for surrender
to Franco and quelling the insur
rectionists with a few well placed
bombs.

In Washington President Roose
velt added the authority of his
voice to the chorus that has de
clared its opposition of the Avar
referendum measure, proposed in
Congress last week.
