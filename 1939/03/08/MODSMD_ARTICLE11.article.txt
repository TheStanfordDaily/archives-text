WHEN EX COMMITTEE, at a special meeting, okayed the date for the Senior Prom, the committee wasted
no time publicizing the fact that Freddy Martin is to play for the dance. Late IMondav night they painted
this Mgn, carried it through the Library and other popular campus spots. Jack Lancy holds one end of
the sign, aided by bashful Chuck Prince, who hid behind the banner. (Photo by Dudman)
