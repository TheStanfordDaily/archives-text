# Excom Approves Activities Committee, Sports Awards
## 
### 
Ex Committee last night approved Lyle Cook's preliminary plan for
an "activity co-ordinating committee," which will, after the plan has been
completed, give student organizations advice on whom to name on their
various committees.
At the same meeting, coaches' nominations for varsity boxing and for
varsity and freshman basketball were approved.
According to Cook's proposal, a council of three students would offer
its advice in appointments made by all Associated Students committees

(including Cardinals), all class com-i
mittecs except executive positions,
other committees so designated by
Ex Committee, and any others re
questing such advice.
The activity co-ordinator, super
visor of the activities card file, would
be an cx-officio member of Ex Com
mittee, Cook .suggested.
"PURELY ADVISORY"
He stressed the point that the
committee's action would be purely
advisory.
"But all appointments made by
groups under control of the com
mittee must be submitted for sug
gestion or addition," be said. "This
can be enforced by Ex Committee's
power of refusing to approve com
mittee appointments."
Tom Killefer raised the objection
the proposed machinery "may be
come a good chance for some of
these politicians to get in and raise
Cain."
CAJLLEI) UNDEMOCRATIC
"The plan is okay on paper," he
said, "but it might not remain only
an advisory committee." He named
Cardinals and the women's nominat
ing committee as two undemocratic
organizations already in existence.
"This will be still another. We're
getting farther and farther away
from democracy," he declared.
Cook pointed out various checks
which would impinge on the com
mittee—Ex Committee approval and
choice of co-ordinator, final control
by Men's and Women's Councils.
"With so many controls, I don't
think anyone would misuse the of
fice," he said.
