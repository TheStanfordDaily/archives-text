# 'Dated Up?' 'Nonsense!' Say Women
## Phone Poll Shows Hall, Row Still Wait For Prom Escorts 
### JOHN FLAHERTY 
From straw-in-the-wind indica
tions blown by a Daily telephone
poll last night of Hall and Row
women's living groups, Stanford
men have cold feet at the thought
of the three-day date-getting period
left, before the Senior Prom Friday
night.
From Encina, the Row, the Halls
has come the long, low wail: "What's
the use of trying. They'll all have
dates by now." But a houae-by
house count tells a different story.
FEW HAVE DATES
From a total sampling of 12 wom
en's living groups' members, only a
small number had Friday night
dates, up night 9 o'clock last night.
Most of this group are going to the
Prom. Majority of house members,
however, are apparently contem
plating an evening at home, unless
phones begin to ring.
Characteristic replies to the ques
tion: "How many in your house
have dates for the Prom?" were:
Dec Gee: "We have 16 sophomores
in the house, and none of them
have dates Friday night, for the
Prom or otherwise."
Pi Phi: Only 8 out of the 23 in
the house are dated up."
Mariposa: "Quite a few are still
waiting."
Chi O: "It's a half and half propo
sition."
Madrono: "Seventeen here don't
have dates for the Prom."
Rohle: "The girls are all excited
about the Prom over here, but a
great many of them aren't going
i yet."
One Row lady indignantly added,
"The trouble with the men here is
that they figure we're dated up
when we aren't; consequently, a
great many girls don't go simply
because they haven't been asked."
So count by count, the theory that
rush dates are impossible seems dis
credited by the girl's own testi
monies.
With Martin as headline feature,
details for the dance are whirling
rapidly through initial planning pe
riods to completion in time for the
Prom.
