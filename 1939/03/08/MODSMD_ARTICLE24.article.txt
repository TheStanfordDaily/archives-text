# AFL Rejects CIO Flan For Merger to End Strife
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 7 (UP).—
The GIO today proposed to establish
labor peace by merging of all labor
organizations into a new "American
Congress of Labor,' but (he AFL re
jected the plan.
The AFL negotiators, after receiv
ing the proposal at President Roose
velt's conference seeking to end
labor's civil war, said the plan "does
not offer any possible solution to the
problems lacing us."
"We are convinced it was not even
designed for serious consideration,"
they said.
'EMBAItICASS I If
"It should be obvious that the
only way to obtain peace is lor both
sides to get down to consideration of
the facts in a realistic way and then
negotiate a settlement," the AFL
representatives said. "In the hope
of finding a peaceful solution of the
problems involved we intend to con
fine ourselves to the procedure out
lined by the President."
The AFL committee members ac
cused the CIO peace committee of
placing the President of the United
States in an embarrassing position
by using the White House as a
sounding board for its proposal."
The organization proposed by the
CIO would supersede both the AFL
and CIO and would embrace the
four independent railroad brother
hoods.
Neither John L Lewis, chairman
of the CIO, nor William Green,
president of the AFL, could be pres
ident of the new organization under
the CIO plan.
The CIO suggested a railroad man,
either D. B. Robertson of the Broth
erhood of Locomotive Firemen &
Engineers, or President A. F. Whit
ney of the Brotherhood of Railroad
Trainmen, should be labor's No. 1
man.
The CIO proposed that the AFL
and the CIO hold special conven
tions between April 15 and 30, to
act on the plan, and that it be put
into effect before June 1.
At the conclusion of today's meet
ing at the White House, Air. Lewis

announced that formal negotiations '
between the AFL and CIO would j
resume at 10 a.m. tomorrow at the
Department of Labor.
In opening the conferences, Pres- 1
ident Roosevelt told the two com- -
mittees that he accepted "the prern- !
ise that both sides want peace."
"That means, of course, that both i
sides go into conference with the'
idea of giving as well as getting," i
Mr. Roosevelt said.
OUGHT TO lii EASY'
"You are all experienced negotia- |
tors. You have been doing that all !
your lives. From that standpoint, I
this job ought to be easy lor you. :
You can think up proposals and |
counter-proposals to meet this situa
tion, and nobody can do it as well as |
you can because nobody knows the j
issues as you do.
"This is your negotiation. ... 1
am counting on you to succeed and
shall look forward to the linal re- :
port on your negotiations."
President Roosevelt risked his \
prestige on a long-shot gamble
when he personally initiated the j
peace conference.
Behind their optimistic front,
labor leaders and political spokes- j
men had admitted that the chances j
of actually reuniting the warring i
union organizations were not good— I
perhaps no better than 1 to 10.
Prospects of* some sort ol stand
still truce are rated less than !jO-50. ■
