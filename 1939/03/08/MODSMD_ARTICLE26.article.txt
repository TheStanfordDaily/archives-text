meeting, Vice-president Bob Wood
announced that the board will in
terview undergraduates desiring ad- |
mission to the Union in the base- I
menl of the Women's Clubhouse to
day at 1 o'clock.
Although, under the new Consti
tution, adopted at. the last meeting,
strict party lines need not be ad
hered to during debates, new mem
bers will indicate their preference
which will be recorded for purposes
of conducting general business on
the floor.
According to John Moskovics,
president-elect, Thursday evening's
debate on the question, "Resolved
that this house approves the appro
priation of $5,000,000 for the fortifi
cation of Guam," will probably be
conducted under the old system.

vacation.

Vincent Lemmon as head of the Un
ion, Moskovics will be the first Con
servative to hold the office since the
organization was founded last year.

he also played a prominent part in
the affairs of the Conservative
party.

party and also a member of the de
bating squad. Party members have
indicated that they would retain
Diesenroth in that capacity for the
remainder of the year.
Tim Hays, who has been head of
the right wing group since last fall,
will carry on until June, while Bob
Wood, having been elected vice
president, will have to resign from <
