AS FAR as Stanford is concerned,
the basketball season is over. All
we can say is, "Wait until next year,
etc."
For Oregon, California, and South
ern California, the fireworks is
just beginning, and in more ways
than one. California and S.C. gra
ciously postponed the play-off with
the Webfeet to the week-end of
.Vlarch 18. Everyone is satisfied ex
cept Oregon and the officials of the
Treasure Island N.C.A.A. meet.
The Bears and Trojans insist that
a game in mid-week to settle the
southern division deadlock will take
too much time from school to war
rant such a scheme. Oregon's ath
letic board threatens to claim a for
feit, because the postponement will
ruin plans which they made months
ago. The annual Oregon high school
tournament is set for Eugene on the
dates which the southerners so
willingly picked. Then, too, Oregon
would prefer to polish off the win
ner of the Cal-U.S.C. game on the
original dates pet so that the squad
members could complete finals and
get a rest ere they were invited to
the Treasure Island affair the week
of March 20.

OUR SYMPATHIES are all with
the north element. How would you
like to play three games on Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday, take four
three-hour finals on Monday morn
ing, pack your suitcase during
lunch time, and be in San Francisco
Tuesday morning for five or six more
games in the space of three days? It
would take all the tricks of an old
traveling salesman to meet such a
schedule.
The official Pacific Coast Confer
ence, southern branch, basketball
team is probably as good as any all
star aggregation is expected to be.
But we've gone to the liberty of se
lecting a Stanford All-Opponent
team which could undoubtedly wal
lop 99 out of 100 American college
five.
For guards, we've picked Joe
Batchelder of Dartmouth and Steve
Belko of Idaho. At forward there's
Ralph Vaughn of U.S.C. and Laddie
Gale of Oregon. And at center,
Gale's teammate and co-star, Ur
sehel "Slim" Wintermute,
* * *
IF YOU remember these lads in
action, maybe you can share our
feeling for them as a unit. In Gale
and Vaughn, we have two of the
best shots in coast history. Gale is
to the northwest what Hank Luisetti
was to our conference and to the
east coast. Belko would have been
a superman on any but the mediocre
Idaho squad which he captained and
kept on a respectable scoring basis
for three years.
Batchelder didn't get a dissenting
vote in our one-man poll while
Wintermute is so far ahead of men
like Ogilvie and Biggerstaff that it's
hardly fair to compare them. Given
another year, Ogilvie and Bigger
staff might season into top per
formers. As they were this year,
however, their play consisted of just
about nine-tenths sheer bean-pole
height and one-tenth basketball
ability.
Wintermute is not only the best
tip-in artist in the game but he is
also a surprisingly smooth floor-man
for all of his six and a half feet.
Of course, all-star teams are com
posed to be heard and not seen.
Someday, some smooth promoter is
going to get every All-Everything
team into action on a great sports
battlefield. The team that comes out
alive will be the official selection.
Who knows, it might be the war to
end all wars?
