# A.T.O.'s to Defend Title
## Sigma Chi Threatens Champions Japanese Club Will Meet Chinese Club hi Preliminary Tilt 
### 
Can A.T.O. successfully defend
their intramural basketball title by
turning back the powerful Sigma
| Chi threat? Or more to the point,
will A.T.O.'s high scoring forwards,
1 Bob Koch and Kai Larson, be able
| to shake themselves from the tire
! less Sigma Chi guards, Jack Topham
! and Art McDearmid, for long enough
j to toss in enough points to win their
! ball game?
The answers to these questions will
come tonight when these two strong
I quintets meet in the pavilion at 8:15
for the intramural cage trophy. In
'the preliminary game at 7:15, the
Japanese Club will meet the Chinese
Club. Admission to these two thrill
ing games is free and fans will see
some mighty fine exhibitions of bas
ketball in the featured contest.
BIG NIGIIT
Tonight is the climax of two
months of intramural cage play.
Sigma Chi and A.T.O. are holding
! an exchange dinner as well, as are
the opponents in the preliminary
game. The referees, H. B. Lee and
Jack Calderwood for the first game,
and John Bunn and Wytze Gorter,
whistle toters in the featured battle,
will be the guests of the various
teams at these dinners. Also in
vited are Intramural Manager Andy
Stojkovich and Faculty Adviser
Harry Wolters.
If the A.T.O. five is successful
tonight, they will be the first team to
win the trophy two years in a row
since El Toro turned the trick back
in 1924. Last year they dumped
Breakers 17-14 in a tight - fought
final game and three men who
starred in that victory are back again
in this year's starting lineup.
VETERAN LINEUP
They are Bob Koch at forward,
I Jack Siefert at one guard, and Jack
j Haraway at the other guard. Round-
I ing out tonight's lineup will be Kai
Larson, deadeye forward, and Steady
Neal Sinclair at the center position.
First call for substitutions will go to
Bernard Gill, Curtis Gibson and
| Nicol Cook.
| But Sigma Chi will match the de
i fending champs at every position
I with height, speed and accuracy.
Exceptionally strong at the guard
positions, the challengers have Art
McDearmid and Jack Topham to
match A.T.O. scoring strength.
GOOD GUARDS
Little McDearmid held Zete ll's
big gun, Jim Groves, to a meager 2
points when Sigma Chi turned back
the Zetes in the semi-finals. The
chief point-getter for the challengers
is Bill Leckie, who is skilled at one
handed pivot shots around the foul
circle.
Valuable for his rebounding abili
ties off each back board, 6-ft. 4 1 / -j-in.
Dick Neely will hold down the pivot
post and John Marsh will team with
Leckie at forward. Stan Owen, the
little boy who tossed through three
quick field goals to pull the Zete
game out of the fire, will be ready
for the call at either forward posi
tion.

The answers to these questions will
come tonight when these two strong
I quintets meet in the pavilion at 8:15
for the intramural cage trophy. In
'the preliminary game at 7:15, the
Japanese Club will meet the Chinese
Club. Admission to these two thrill
ing games is free and fans will see
some mighty fine exhibitions of bas
ketball in the featured contest.
BIG NIGIIT
Tonight is the climax of two
months of intramural cage play.
Sigma Chi and A.T.O. are holding
! an exchange dinner as well, as are
the opponents in the preliminary
game. The referees, H. B. Lee and
Jack Calderwood for the first game,
and John Bunn and Wytze Gorter,
whistle toters in the featured battle,
will be the guests of the various
teams at these dinners. Also in
vited are Intramural Manager Andy
Stojkovich and Faculty Adviser
Harry Wolters.
If the A.T.O. five is successful
tonight, they will be the first team to
win the trophy two years in a row
since El Toro turned the trick back
in 1924. Last year they dumped
Breakers 17-14 in a tight - fought
final game and three men who
starred in that victory are back again
in this year's starting lineup.
VETERAN LINEUP
They are Bob Koch at forward,
I Jack Siefert at one guard, and Jack
j Haraway at the other guard. Round-
I ing out tonight's lineup will be Kai
Larson, deadeye forward, and Steady
Neal Sinclair at the center position.
First call for substitutions will go to
Bernard Gill, Curtis Gibson and
| Nicol Cook.
| But Sigma Chi will match the de
i fending champs at every position
I with height, speed and accuracy.
Exceptionally strong at the guard
positions, the challengers have Art
McDearmid and Jack Topham to
match A.T.O. scoring strength.
GOOD GUARDS
Little McDearmid held Zete ll's
big gun, Jim Groves, to a meager 2
points when Sigma Chi turned back
the Zetes in the semi-finals. The
chief point-getter for the challengers
is Bill Leckie, who is skilled at one
handed pivot shots around the foul
circle.
Valuable for his rebounding abili
ties off each back board, 6-ft. 4 1 / -j-in.
Dick Neely will hold down the pivot
post and John Marsh will team with
Leckie at forward. Stan Owen, the
little boy who tossed through three
quick field goals to pull the Zete
game out of the fire, will be ready
for the call at either forward posi
tion.
Can A.T.O. successfully defend
their intramural basketball title by
turning back the powerful Sigma
| Chi threat? Or more to the point,
will A.T.O.'s high scoring forwards,
1 Bob Koch and Kai Larson, be able
| to shake themselves from the tire
! less Sigma Chi guards, Jack Topham
! and Art McDearmid, for long enough
j to toss in enough points to win their
! ball game?
