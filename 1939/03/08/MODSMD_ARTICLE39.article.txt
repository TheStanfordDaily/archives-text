# 'Not A Chance' Moans Thornton over Swim Meet
## 
### 
Sporting potential winners in every event except the diving, U.S.C.'s !
strong swimming aggregation will invade the Encina Pools this Friday j
afternoon at 4 o'clock.
Possibilities of a Stanford win in this meet are practically nil, and the j
best that Coach Nort Thornton can hope for is 31] points, not quite enough

to stop the Trojan splashers, Â«
"On the other hand," said Thorn
ton, "if the breaks don't turn our
way, they might slash the points on
the Stanford side of the scoreboard
down to 17."
Stand-out men for the Trojans are
Captain Paul Wolfe, world cham
pion sprinter in the 50 and 100; and
Bob Sellers, a Fullerton J. C. trans
fer, also in the sprints, both of
whom have beaten the times of Roy
Vitousek of the Cards.
Other shining lights from the
southern school include Bert Smith
in the backstroke and Dick Whitney

.
i in the breaststroke, both transfers j
j from Los Angeles J. C. The races j
J between these boys and Weeden j
! and Vitousek will be the best of the j
j day.
Captain Win Needham of the
| Cards will face Eugene Glasband in
I both the 220 and quarter-mile.
| Needham won both races last year [
j but whether he will be able to re
| peat this season is a matter of con
jecture.
Admission is 25 cents with a stu
dent body card.

Liverpool's name is believed to be
i derived from the Norse words mean
ing the "pool of the slopes."
