# Thompson to Start on Mound Against St. Mary's Today
## 
### 
"Cootie" Thompson will get an
other crack at the high-flying St.
Mary's Gaels on the sunken diamond
this afternoon.
The star sophomore pitcher of the
Stanford diamond squad has run
into tough luck in two appearances
against the St. Mary's Phoenix. Re
lieving A1 Lazzarone in the extra
inning thriller two weeks ago,
Thompson pitched one inning, al
lowed one hit, struck out three men,
but lost the game on a passed ball.
Last Wednesday he again replaced
Lazzarone, this time in the seventh
inning. "Cootie" went to work with
the score 8-2 against him and shut
the Gaels out with one hit and no
runs for the remainder of the game.
GAELS SECOND
St. Mary's comes to Stanford to
day in second place in the Califor
nia intercollegiate Baseball Associa
tion because of their 5-3 triumph
over the California Bears Saturday.
Southern California is in first place
with two wins and no defeats.
Bill Jameson is slated to start the
game as Thompson's battery mate.
Jameson and Templeton have been
waging a close battle for the regular
catching assignment. Cookie South
will probably start at first base in
stead of Johnny Livermore, who
has been having trouble getting base
hits in the last few games.

eted into the headlines Saturday by

holding the heavy hitting Bears to
three runs and nine hits. Greenlaw
and Johnson are both lel't-handers.
The rest of the Jine-up will prob
ably be the same as the one that
