# Overflowing with Democracy

### 
TO satisfy the demand of a dance-crazed
campus, Monday night Ex Committee let
down the bars for the Senior Prom. Reassured
by one of the most enthusiastic and active
dance committees ever to be seen here, where
such organisms flourish, the august legislators
couldn't keep their toes from tapping in expec
tation of Freddy Martin's down-beat.
Like a great many other pieces of emergency
legislation, the Senior Prom Act steps on cer
tain people's toes. Those to feel the pain most
acutely were Ramshead and Dramatics Coun
cil, who had been granted a closed date next
Friday night for their prize-winning one-act
plays.
It is fortunate that Stanford has no supreme
court to declare this legislation unconstitutional,
for it is certain that the actors have the law
on their side. In approving the Prom, Ex Com
mittee violated two of its own by-laws without
batting an eye: budgets for campus functions
must be submitted and approved at least ten
days before they are given, and dates cannot be
granted for two all-campus events on the same
night.
Strictly speaking, such action is not in line
with the principles of student self-government;
it smacks of oligarchy. But as a matter of fact
when Ex Committee gave Dave Ryus and Co.
the "go" signal, it was being even more demo
cratic than democratic government allows. It
knew that the campus wanted the Prom. So
with an eye to the greatest good for the great
est number, the student legislature violated its
own rules and the technical rights of Dramatics
Council.
However, the damage isn't irreparable; pam
pered Stanford again can have its cake and eat
it too.
The prize-winning plays start at 8 o'clock, and
the final curtain falls at 9:30. The Pavilion is
just a step from the Little Theater. Campus
dance floors are always empty during the first
half-hour and often for longer than that.
For a perfect Friday night, students can at
tend both the plays and the prom without the
slightest inconvenience. And as they revel in
the results of this act of student government
which transcends even the perfection of de
mocracy, they should remember that nothing
ever devised can compete with Ex Committee
in showing Stanford a good time.â€”L. L.
