NEXT Sunday the Steinbeck Committee takes
its first definite step in its program of
combatting California's migratory labor prob
lem. It plans a 200-mile trip to the agricultural
camps near Visalia.
It doesn't expect a large number of students
not on the committee to make the trip. It's a
long drive and finals are drawing near. Be
sides, the Steinbeckers want to do some thor
ough investigating themselves before they be
gin their work of educating the campus about
the migrant labor situation.
They could have planned a shorter trip, but
the Visalia district is where they can see both
squatter camps and a big government agri
cultural camp. s
When they have made this initial visit, mem
bers of the committee will be prepared to engi
neer similar trips for larger numbers of stu
dents. And during spring quarter, when the
peas, artichokes, and other local crops are
being harvested, students will be able to see
first-hand the manifestations of this acute tie-up
of America's agricultural economics.— R. D.
