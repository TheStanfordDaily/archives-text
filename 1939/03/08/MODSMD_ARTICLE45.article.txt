REVIEWED last night by Ex Committee were
were tentative plans for the long-desired
Committee on Committees.
By the outline presented, the man and woman
in charge of men's and women's A.S.S.U. ac
tivity card files and an ex officio member of
Excom would pass approval on student body
and class committee appointments.
It is pointed out that such a body would
insure observance of the fine line that divides
efficiency and democracy in student govern
ment.
On the other hand, it is alleged that such a

committee, headed as it would be by a person
chosen by Ex Committee, might in time work
itself into the position of practical control of
A.S.S.U. activities by dishing out the gravy jobs
to political friends. In other words, defeat the
very democratic theory that would underlie its
establishment.
Appointments at present are subject to Excom
approval; they would remain so with this com
mittee. And there would be no more danger of
Excom letting itself be run or soft-soaped by a
political Czar than right now.
The plan is criticized also on the ground that
neither Excom nor the "Committee on Com
mittees" has any check or assurance that or
ganizations will follow the latter's recommen
dations.
In answer to this, let objectors take a lesson
from Washington and the Democrats and re
member that budget appropriation or non-ap
propriation is a good democratic principle.
