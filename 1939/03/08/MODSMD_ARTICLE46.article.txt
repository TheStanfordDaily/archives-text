JOHN, XX, 4
A CCORDING to latest quotations, the Senior Prom
has emerged from the whirlpool of confusion that
sucked it under last week, and is definitely sched
uled for Friday night. In this I find conclusive evi
dence of the existence of an all-powerful and all
loving God.
In my opinion the salvalion of the Prom should go
down in religious history along with the miracles of
the apostles. The direct intervention of Heaven is
the only possible explanation of the way things worked
out. Evidently God does not confine His attention to
the fall of sparrows, as some of the cynical would have
us believe; He spends a fidl eight-hour day looking
out for the senior class.
* * # *
It is understatement to say that the career of the
Prom has been chequered. A better adjective would
be "blotched." In their brief evolution the plans for
the dance have been exposed to more stupidity and
muddle-headedness, both local and imported, than we
have seen since Nero's administration in Rome. And
yet Friday night we will have a Prom, according to
all indications a Grade A one.
At this point it is useless to attempt any, appor
tionment of blame for the confusion. Cross currents
of contributory negligence blended into a rip-tide that
cannot be charted. Even Solomon would refuse to
take jurisdiction over the case.
* * * $
/ , ERTAINLY the Music Corporation of America has
a couple of kicks in the trousers owed it. In
furiated seniors say that the Corporation's executives
were bom of mothers frightened by pendulums, that
their opinions swing back and forth but never stop
long enough to get a contract signed. Obviously the
Corporation's alternating policy caused a lot of the
uproar.
But the sleep-walking attitude of the seniors didn't
help the situation. Unless they had a hot tip that
God was going to help out. they will have a hard time
justifying their happy-go-lucky treatment of arrange
ments. Normal business risks are not ordinarily fig
ured to include God. and without Him, the seniors
would have had no Prom.

There were other upsetting factors as well. The
howling turmoil that is our date system contributed to
the trouble. The vested interests of the one-act plays
scheduled for the same night introduced the question
of discrimination.
But out of the whirlpool comes a Prom, complete
with '"the best orchestra on the coast." Unless God
exists in the last act, it should be the best, dance of the
year. Compared v/ith this, Moses' miracles were mere
parlor tricks.
It's too bad we can't claim credit for arranging it.
If we could we would probably be canonized.

the dance have been exposed to more stupidity and
muddle-headedness, both local and imported, than we
have seen since Nero's administration in Rome. And
yet Friday night we will have a Prom, according to
all indications a Grade A one.
At this point it is useless to attempt any, appor
tionment of blame for the confusion. Cross currents
of contributory negligence blended into a rip-tide that
cannot be charted. Even Solomon would refuse to
take jurisdiction over the case.

/ , ERTAINLY the Music Corporation of America has
a couple of kicks in the trousers owed it. In
furiated seniors say that the Corporation's executives
were bom of mothers frightened by pendulums, that
their opinions swing back and forth but never stop
long enough to get a contract signed. Obviously the
Corporation's alternating policy caused a lot of the
uproar.
But the sleep-walking attitude of the seniors didn't
help the situation. Unless they had a hot tip that
God was going to help out. they will have a hard time
justifying their happy-go-lucky treatment of arrange
ments. Normal business risks are not ordinarily fig
ured to include God. and without Him, the seniors
would have had no Prom.

There were other upsetting factors as well. The
howling turmoil that is our date system contributed to
the trouble. The vested interests of the one-act plays
scheduled for the same night introduced the question
of discrimination.
But out of the whirlpool comes a Prom, complete
with '"the best orchestra on the coast." Unless God
exists in the last act, it should be the best, dance of the
year. Compared v/ith this, Moses' miracles were mere
parlor tricks.
It's too bad we can't claim credit for arranging it.
If we could we would probably be canonized.

A CCORDING to latest quotations, the Senior Prom
has emerged from the whirlpool of confusion that
sucked it under last week, and is definitely sched
uled for Friday night. In this I find conclusive evi
dence of the existence of an all-powerful and all
loving God.
In my opinion the salvalion of the Prom should go
down in religious history along with the miracles of
the apostles. The direct intervention of Heaven is
the only possible explanation of the way things worked
out. Evidently God does not confine His attention to
the fall of sparrows, as some of the cynical would have
us believe; He spends a fidl eight-hour day looking
out for the senior class.

It is understatement to say that the career of the
Prom has been chequered. A better adjective would
be "blotched." In their brief evolution the plans for
