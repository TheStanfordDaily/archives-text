YEAH

I was quite surprised the other night when my
room-mate, who is an engineering major, said of an
other engineering major: "You know, I think I have
figured out his philosophy."
I was surprised because I have never thought of
engineering majors as having philosophies. I didn't
think they had time for it.
"Yeah?" I said, with nice inflection.
"I'm sure I have figured it out," he said. "He thinks
one problem is just like every other problem!"

NO

In a textbook on foreign exchange a cardinal rule
was being explained. The author wrote:
"Any tariffs on the gold movement will be a viola
tion of the principle of the gold standard. A very
small tariff would be a very small violation."
Yes, go on. What would a middle-sized tariff be?
And a very large tariff?

TRUE

In a current number of a magazine for journal
ists, there is an article titled, "Ten Ways to Write
Badly."
One of the Daily boys saw it. "Gee," he said with
regret and disappointment in his voice, "I could have
written that."

TYPICAL

For a month or so this year one of the frosh was
eating breakfast every morning in an eating club. lie
didn't, belong, but he would go in and eat.
None of the boys knew him. Oh, well, they would
say, maybe he belongs. After all, you can't know
everyone.
They paid no attention to him. He would come in,
quietly cat his breakfast, and then leave.
Finally one of the boys was a little curious. He
asked the frosh who he was and was he a member.
"No," the frosh said, "I'm not a member. I though:
anyone could eat breakfast here." He had good reason
to think so.
Which leads to the conclusion that the chief dif
ference between an eating club and a fraternity is
that a fraternity man would have pledged him on the
spot.

POEM

People knew she looked rather like a dog, but they
were a little surprised when they asked him how
she was, after he had taken her out for the first
time for a paddle around the lake and had
tipped over the canoe, to hear him say, Oh she
was a sort of
Wet
Pet
