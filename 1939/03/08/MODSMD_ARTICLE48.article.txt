The Editor, Sir:
Is Lagunita a men's dormitory or
a women's dormitory?
Monday evening, March G, resi
dents of Casa Naranja and Casa
Adelfa were informed that their
rooms would be occupied by a men's
conference during spring vacation.
This necessitates the girls' remov
ing all personal furnishings and
placing them in a closet measuring
42 x-38 inches, which already accom
modates a wardrobe. This arrange
ment has been arbitrarily inflicted
upon the residents of these two casas
by the administration.
Furthermore, girls who wish to
stay in the hall during the vaca
tion must move out of their own
rooms into another casa, thus in
conveniencing other girls.
We see no reason why men can
not be housed in men's dormitories,
where they would undoubtedly feel
more at home.
