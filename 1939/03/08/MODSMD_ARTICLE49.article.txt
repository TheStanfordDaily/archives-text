# TOYON-BRANNER

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Seldom has a topic aroused so I
much discussion in the staid, some- i
what dull confines of Toyon and j
Branner halls as the proposed [
changes in the assigning of rooms. |
The plan to house junior transfers j
in Branner would mean that many |
sophomores and all other lower divi- j
sion independents who are compelled {
to live in Encina during their fresh- i
man year, would lie forced to live j
ofl-campus the next year.
According to one estimate, there j
are 200 junior transfers entering j
Stanford each year, more than j
enough to fill Branner, and permit- J
ting an overflow into Sequoia. If the !
transfers are allowed to retain their
Branner room rights until gradua- j
tion, what is to be done with the j
next crop that comes in? If the,
transfers are forced to move out at j
the end of one year, they will have |
to move to Palo Alto.
It seems that in order to solve the :
hall financial problem, someone will ;
have to be "forced" to do something. I
Why not "force" the present occu
pants of the halls to remain there
for a year? In the final analysis it
is obvious that the only solution of
the problems of the men's halls, so
cial and financial, is to build another
dormitory.
In any case, why solve one prob- j
lem by creating another?
