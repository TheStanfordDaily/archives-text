# UNCONSTITUTIONAL

The Editor, Sir:
In order that the student body ,
should better understand the condi- ;
tion.s under which the Senior Prom 1
materialized, I should like to point i
out several actions, illegal and un- |
justifiable, which were necessary I
for the proposed dance to become a
reality. Ex Committee has a consti
tution and by-laws which are usu
ally interpreted to insure a demo- I
cratic form of student government, j
In the case of the Senior Prom, j
however, these laws were disre- j
garded by the very body that made
them.
High-pressured by a group of
over-zealous seniors into granting a j
date already granted to Dramatic j
Council, Ex Committee violated
some of the laws it had previously
passed. Ty enumerate: (1) All bud
gets must be submitted and ap
proved at least ten days prior to the
function. (2) No two all-campus
functions shall be allowed on the
same night.
A certain halo seems to surround j
the word "closed." First, the Senior
Prom Committee had a closed date
for the Prom on March 10. The i
plans for the dance were abandoned
because of difficulties in obtaining
an orchestra, and the date was can
celled. Dramatic Council applied |

| for and was granted the date. March
i 10, on the same night it was can
celled.
When a new possibility of con
tracting for an orchestra arose on
j Monday, Ex Committee disregarded
j the date granted to Dramatic Coun
| cil, despite the fact that Dramatic
' Council had its budget submitted
and approved, its advertising cain
j paign under way, its date cleared
through this noble body as well as
through Public Exercises Commit
tee, and the cast had been rehearsing
the one-acts for well over a month.
Conveniently forgetting to notify
any member of the Council so that
jno legitimate argument could be
| raised, no appeal could be made to
! the logical reasoning, if any, of this
j body, and Ex Committee granted
! the. date. A governing body which
disregards and violates the laws it
establishes is in a peculiar position
to enforce them.
