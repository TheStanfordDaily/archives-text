# History ... 1939

### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
IN THOSE dark, dramatic days of
the Depression when Roosevelt
was considered the nation's savior
and the New Deal, the panacea for
every ill, it was seldom indeed that
Congress refused to pass an Admin
istration bill.
But as the country started to pull
itself out of the Depression, only to
stumble into the Recession, the Re
publican-anti New Deal bloc start
ed to grow. By 1937 it had reached
proportions that enabled it to de
cisively defeat the President's favo
rite measures, the Supreme Court
and Administrative Reorganization
bills.
The proposal to reform the high
court was not entirely unsuc
cessful, in that merely suggesting
it, was sufficient to frighten the
nine old men from their conserva
tive stand on wage regulation over
to the liberal side of the ledger.
But the Administrative Reorgani
zation Bill was a total failure. Al
though it provided for much-needed
reforms in the organization and
control of independent commissions,
it was washed away by the force of
the anti-New Deal wave.

ITOWEVER, among the proposed
legislation that has drifted up on
Congress' beach during the past few
weeks is the old measure, slightly
modified, so that it gives the Presi
dent power to redraft the set-up of
the government departments.
After the violent condemnation
that crushed the bill two years
ago, the House seemed strangely
complacent when it approved re
organization of the fourth branch
of the government yesterday and
sent it rolling on its way lo ap
proval by the Senate.
The New Dealers had to muster
all their forces at the last minute to
defeat an amendment which would
have given either house of Congress
power to veto Roosevelt's new design
for administration.

What the President wants to do is
to tie down the government agen
cies with quasi-legislative and
quasi-judicial functions to a definite
responsibility. At present they en
joy final discretion, in many cases
not reviewable by the courts. Such
privileges allow an extremely desir
able elasticity in the law, a flexi
bility which makes it adaptable to
the complex conditions of modern
economic legislation.
But at the same time such
weapons are dangerous. They
should be subject to some degree
of control, or they are likely to
fire at the wrong person at the
wrong time. Not that the admin
istrative commissions arc not ex
port in their fields and the best
mechanisms ever devised to per
form their functions, but there is
comfort in knowing that they are
tied down to something as solid as
our federal judicial system.

A NOTIIER of the President's new
projects is the repeal of the
Neutrality Act, which, he claims,
operates only to handcuff the United
States' foreign policy and contrib
utes nothing to keeping u.s out. of
wars. The chief objection to the Act
lies in its provision that forbids
shipping any exports to warring na
tions, but allows a power engaged
in conflict to come to this country
to purchase supplies.
The obvious effect of this law is
that it permits the stronger of the
powers at war, whether it be the ag
gressor or defender, to trade with
the United States. Thus, in a great
many cases, it is the nation that
started the war, the invading totali
tarian state, that is favored by the
Neutrality Act.
$ *
That there is something radic
ally wrong with the measure is
unquestionable when an isola
tionist such as Senator liiram
Johnson favors its repeal. Yes
terday both he and Senator J.
Hamilton Lewis added their voices
to the support of the bill now be
fore the upper house which would
kill the Neutrality Act.

Today all's quiet on the European
front. Even rumors of an impending
war arc absent. But Britain contin
ues to work feverishly strengthen
ing her defenses, and yesterday for
the third time in the past 100 years
.she laid plans for an armed force
designed to fight on the Continent.
When a major power, such as
England, is occupied with establish
ing bases for military operations in
central and western Europe, on its
own soil and at strategic points in
the Near East, she isn't spending
the money and the man-power
carelessly.
If the fear of war wasn't hiding
just around the corner, English
cabinet ministers would probably
be spending their time at lawn fetes
and week-end parties in Sussex in
stead of poring over maps and
military specifications through the
long London nights.
