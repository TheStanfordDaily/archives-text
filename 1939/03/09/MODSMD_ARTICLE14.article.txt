STUDENTS LEAVE TEXTS
Facilities will permit students to
leave their books with the exchange
for sale, and payment will be made
to the owner as soon as the book is
sold.
Students may place their own
prices on the books they wish to
sell, and clerks of the Exchange will

be in a position to advise on that
price. In addition, the exchange
will be prepared to assist students in
obtaining books that are not avail
able at the exchange.
TWO BOARDS
Management of the exchange will
be in the hands of a board of seven
student directors, and a board of
faculty advisers will be called on to
aid in determining policy.
"It will be particularly advan
tageous for students to bring to the
exchange books that they no longer
need, and especially those texts that
will be in demand for spring quar
ter," Moscovics explained. A list of
books to be used during spring
quarter will be available at the
exchange.
