# University Pays Homage To Founders
## 
### 
March 9 has come to mean more
to Farm men and women than just
an observance of Senator Stanford's
birthday. Under the name of
Founders' Day it has become an oc
casion of reverence, of thanksgiv
ing to the Stanford family, which
gave this university to the world.
The first Founders' Day, held at
the express wishes of Senator Stan
ford himself, took place in 1891. The
day was May 14, Leland Stanford
Junior's birthday.
After the death of Senator Stan
ford, in 189.3, the commemorative
services were changed to March 9,
to honor the birthday of the Sen
ator. At this time, Founders' Day 1
services were held in memory of
Senator Stanford and his son.
MISSED ONE YEAR
In only one year since the first
service has Founders' Day not been
observed. That year, 1901, Cali
fornia grieved over the passing of
Mrs. Stanford, and in the services
the year following, her name joined
those of her husband and her son,
in the triad still sacred to the mem
ory of Stanford.
Reminiscing upon observances of
by-gone Founders' Days, Dr. David
Starr Jordan, Stanford's first presi
dent, told of the services held in I
1891—the first of many days set j
aside in memory of the Stanford
family.
He told of the entire campus' leav
ing classes for the day, of profes- |
sors and students alike picnicking j
at Monterey. Filled with deep rev
erence, his account portrays in full
the homage Stanford University
pays its founders.
LOCALE SHIFTED
Observances of Founders' Days
throughout the years since the cor- I
net - stone was first laid, have been |
shifted in locale, but never in j
spirit.
Could Senator Stanford be pros- i
ent today—on this, his 115 th birth- |
day—his heart would swell proudly j
at the strides his university has tak- j
en. But it cannot bo, and all that j
Stanford University has of the grand !
old senator and his beloved family j
is a memory, both of them and of 1
his own maxim.

day was May 14, Leland Stanford
Junior's birthday.
After the death of Senator Stan
ford, in 189.3, the commemorative
services were changed to March 9,
to honor the birthday of the Sen
ator. At this time, Founders' Day 1
services were held in memory of
Senator Stanford and his son.
MISSED ONE YEAR
In only one year since the first
service has Founders' Day not been
observed. That year, 1901, Cali
fornia grieved over the passing of
Mrs. Stanford, and in the services
the year following, her name joined
those of her husband and her son,
in the triad still sacred to the mem
ory of Stanford.
Reminiscing upon observances of
by-gone Founders' Days, Dr. David
Starr Jordan, Stanford's first presi
dent, told of the services held in I
1891—the first of many days set j
aside in memory of the Stanford
family.
He told of the entire campus' leav
ing classes for the day, of profes- |
sors and students alike picnicking j
at Monterey. Filled with deep rev
erence, his account portrays in full
the homage Stanford University
pays its founders.
LOCALE SHIFTED
Observances of Founders' Days
throughout the years since the cor- I
net - stone was first laid, have been |
shifted in locale, but never in j
spirit.
Could Senator Stanford be pros- i
ent today—on this, his 115 th birth- |
day—his heart would swell proudly j
at the strides his university has tak- j
en. But it cannot bo, and all that j
Stanford University has of the grand !
old senator and his beloved family j
is a memory, both of them and of 1
his own maxim.
"The winds of freedom blow."
March 9 has come to mean more
to Farm men and women than just
an observance of Senator Stanford's
birthday. Under the name of
Founders' Day it has become an oc
casion of reverence, of thanksgiv
ing to the Stanford family, which
gave this university to the world.
The first Founders' Day, held at
the express wishes of Senator Stan
