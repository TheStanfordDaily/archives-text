# Luncheon Club Hears Hopkins
## Labor Problems Topic of Discussion 
### 
William Stephen Hopkins, assist
ant professor of economics, spoke
on "Agricultural Labor Problems"
before yesterday's meeting of the
Luncheon Club.
''American agriculture is under
going a revolution comparable to
the Industrial Revolution," said Mr.
Hopkins. There are no leaders and
no conscious agitators, but still a
revolution is going on."
Well known on campus because of
his many statements on the migra
tory worker's problem, the speaker
went on to explain how the situa
tion cannot be remedied by a re
turn to prosperity.
Having spent the winter in North
Dakota, he gave the wheat belt as
his first example. "The majority of
the farms in the wheat belt are
technically subject to mortgage fore
closures," he said, "but nothing is
being done because they are not
producing enough to make a fore
closure profitable. As soon as pros
perity returns, the farms will be
producing enough to make foreclos
ure pay, so that even more farmers
will be without homes."
Also adding to the migratory
workers' problem, although with a
different cause, is the cotton belt.
"The cotton industry has been gear
ed to hand labor. Machines have
been invented, but the cotton is not
paying enough to afford installment
of them. When the cotton again be
gins to pay, the machines will be
installed, and more workers will go
on relief
"Thus," said Mr. Hopkins, "the
agricultural labor problem is due to
a fundamental change in the agri
cultural system, and prosperity wiH
not remedy the problems it
causes."
