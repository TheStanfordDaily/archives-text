# Political Union Will Debate Guam Fortification Tonight
## 
### 
Despite the fact thut the section of
the rearmament bill before Congress,
proposing the fortification of the
island of Guam, has been turned
down, the Political Union will de
bate the pros and cons of the ques
tion in the Education Building this
evening at 7:30 o'clock.
Considering the advisability of us
ing the topic, the standing commit
tee, headed by John Moskovics,
agreed that the close connection be
tween the proposal and the future
foreign policy of the United States
warranted a discussion of the meas
ure.
Tonight's meeting, the third and
last of the quarter, will see Mosko
vics installed as third president of
the campus organization. Succeed
ing Vincent Lemmon, as the first
Conservative in the house to hold
the top post, he will serve in that
capacity until June of this year.
Others taking office, after the
semi-annual elections held last
month, will be Bob Wood, vice-pres
ident; Mary Maud Mitchell, secre
tary; Dan Hays, treasurer; Fran Du-
Bois, sergeant-at-arrns, and Oliver
Wyman, chairman of the committee
on publicity.
It is also expected that the three
parties may make some changes in
their organization despite the fact
that the heads of the Liberal and
Conservative groups will remain the
same. Carl Diesenroth and Tim
Hays, respectively, have been re

tained by these two factions, but
the Laborites, with Wood as newly
elected vice-president, will name a
successor to guide the left wing
policy for the remainder of the year.
The Standing Committee stated
that party caucuses will be held at
7 o'clock tonight before the regular
meeting is called to order. Under
the new constitution, accepted at the
last meeting, future debate from the
floor will be slightly altered with
regard to the party stands, but
pending the completion of details
the old system will be adhered to.
Opposition to the Guam resolu
tion will be led, tonight, by the
Conservatives, while the Laborites
are expected to take the opposite
stand. No solid block, however, Is
likely to be presented by the left
wingers, leaving the fence-sitting
Liberals to sway the vote either
way.
Following yesterday's meeting,
the election committee announced
that the following had been admit
ted to the Union: Pat Livesley, '42
(Liberal); Jed Leetham, '40 (Lib
eral); Frank Linville, '39 (Conserva
tive); and George Jackson, '42 (Con
servative).

tion will be led, tonight, by the
Conservatives, while the Laborites
are expected to take the opposite
stand. No solid block, however, Is
likely to be presented by the left
wingers, leaving the fence-sitting
Liberals to sway the vote either
way.
Following yesterday's meeting,
the election committee announced
that the following had been admit
ted to the Union: Pat Livesley, '42
(Liberal); Jed Leetham, '40 (Lib
eral); Frank Linville, '39 (Conserva
tive); and George Jackson, '42 (Con
servative).
Radio station KTAT, one of the
key stations in Elliott Roosevelt's
Texas state network, recently cut a
radio preacher off the air in the
middle of an attack on Vice-Presi
dent John Garner.
Despite the fact thut the section of
the rearmament bill before Congress,
proposing the fortification of the
island of Guam, has been turned
down, the Political Union will de
bate the pros and cons of the ques
tion in the Education Building this
evening at 7:30 o'clock.
Considering the advisability of us
ing the topic, the standing commit
tee, headed by John Moskovics,
agreed that the close connection be
tween the proposal and the future
foreign policy of the United States
warranted a discussion of the meas
ure.
Tonight's meeting, the third and
last of the quarter, will see Mosko
vics installed as third president of
the campus organization. Succeed
ing Vincent Lemmon, as the first
Conservative in the house to hold
the top post, he will serve in that
capacity until June of this year.
Others taking office, after the
semi-annual elections held last
month, will be Bob Wood, vice-pres
ident; Mary Maud Mitchell, secre
tary; Dan Hays, treasurer; Fran Du-
Bois, sergeant-at-arrns, and Oliver
Wyman, chairman of the committee
on publicity.
It is also expected that the three
parties may make some changes in
their organization despite the fact
that the heads of the Liberal and
Conservative groups will remain the
same. Carl Diesenroth and Tim
Hays, respectively, have been re

tained by these two factions, but
the Laborites, with Wood as newly
elected vice-president, will name a
successor to guide the left wing
policy for the remainder of the year.
The Standing Committee stated
that party caucuses will be held at
7 o'clock tonight before the regular
meeting is called to order. Under
the new constitution, accepted at the
last meeting, future debate from the
floor will be slightly altered with
regard to the party stands, but
pending the completion of details
the old system will be adhered to.
Opposition to the Guam resolu
tion will be led, tonight, by the
Conservatives, while the Laborites
are expected to take the opposite
