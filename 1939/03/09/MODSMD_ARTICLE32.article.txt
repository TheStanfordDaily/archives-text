Laugh of the Month Club: "The
University of Southern California is
against a mirl-week basketball play
off with the California Bears because
the' Trojans don't want to miss any
time from classes."
* * *
FROM OUR unbiased observation
point, it would be a good thing for
either the Bears or the Trojans if
Oregon refused to play of! the
north-south championship. Only the
Stanford teams of the Laughing Boy
years can approach Ihe Ducks for
sheer ability and precision.
The Bears and Trojans would do
well to cancel their train reserva
tions to Eugene while basketball in
the state of California still has a
far-sighted reputation.
Oregon is going to be the team to
beat—play-ofl' or no play-off—in the
Treasure Island N.C.A.A. cham
pionships. The Ducks haven't lost a
northern division series in three
years. Four members of the current
first, string have been there for three
years. A little thing like a southern
division tie isn't going to wreck
their chances of being intercollegiate
champions. And why should it?
Incidentally, the Oregon team
played to 116,700 spectators in 27
games. In their three winning years,
the Ducks have drawn more than
1550,000 through the turnstiles.
Shades of Luisetti!

YET, YOU will find few dissent
ers to the fact that Hec Edmundson,
Washington's basketball and track
coach, is the best hoop mentor in
the northern division and one of the
best in the business.
Hec has been coaching at Seattle
for 19 years, has won eight cham
pionships, and has never finished
lower than second place in his con
ference. The old Oregon State zone
defense has been his toughest com
petition. So fierce have the Beavers
been that they've won 23 out of 69
games from Edmundson - coached
varsities. That's exactly 10 more
than any other school has gathered
from the Huskies.
Maybe you get the idea now why
we pick Edmundson as the best in
the north.

HAVING BEEN born in a warmer
clime than is conducive for skiing, a
Christiana has been nothing more
nor less than a Norwegian blind
date to us. All those other fancy
names which the ski champs use
aren't even in our North Carolina
dictionary.
But you can't live around Stan
ford very long without getting a
little snow in your blood. By read
ing the papers and listening to the
pine slat enthusiasts, we have be
come more and more interested in
the feats of the Stanford ski team.
Alter all, the team always placed
exceptionally high in nearly every
week-end, tournament and they
seemed to be getting better every
tournament. Then we found out
they placed eleventh in the Pacific
Coast Collegiates last week-end
just when we had decided that they
were the best of the lot.
We started searching for an ex
cuse for the let-down and found
them by the score. In the first
place. Bill Janss, team captain and
one of the really good collegiate
riders on the Coast, was injured
and couldn't make the trip to
Yosemite.
In the two events where Stanford
has done all their practicing—down
hill and slalom racing — the Indians
got third and fourth, a highly re
spectable rating when schools like j
Washington and Nevada are run
ning against you.
Stanford had no one in the jumps
and lost one man by disqualification I
in the cross-country. The top
