# Exams Next On Boxers' Schedule
## 
### 
Final exams and sporting events
just don't go together, as testified
by members of the Stanford boxing
team.
With the best glove tossers that
♦ he team has seen for many a year,
Coach Clayton Frye had high hopes
ol sending some of the boxers to
Sacramento for the state tourney.
Johnny Ward, Jack Rice, and some
of the other beak-busters have a
very good chance of bringing some
state championships back to the
Farm.
Titles and championships are nice
and all that sort of thing, but a fa
vorable bawl-out average is a little
more important. As the Sacramento j
Tourney is scheduled for the same
time as winter quarter finals, Stan
ford's mitt-men will just have to be
satisfied with punching out victories
over exams and not ex-champions. |

teams had full, experienced teams in
every classification. The Oregon
and Washington men are on an ex
tended vacation down here. They
don't have to rush back Sunday
afternoons to write term papers and
theses.
Nevada is a mere 20-minute drive
from the finest snow fields; Stanford,
stuck in the Peninsula sunshine, has
to go at least 250 miles for a decent
practice run. Most of the other
schools have regular coaches and
intensive instruction periods.
So the Indian snow men didn't do
so bad after all, and chances are
they would have placed fourth or
fifth if Janss had been in shape for
the slalom and down-hill drives.
