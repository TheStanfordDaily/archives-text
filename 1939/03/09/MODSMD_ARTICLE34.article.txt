# U.S.C. Mermen Favored to Win
## Cards to Face Best Troy Team in History 
### 
:
I Though Stanford's chances of win
ning their dual swim meet with the
Trojans tomorrow afternoon are al
most nil, it will be one of the best
to be splashed in the Encina Pools
■this year.
If the opinions of the Southern
California scribes ar£ to be taken at
face value, U.S.C. has the greatest
team in the history of the sunny(?)
Southland. Captain Paul Wolf of
the Trojans is the shining light of
the squad with a world's record in
the 50 and numerous other records
in almost every event to his credit.
Word from U.S.C. yesterday put
an air of doubt into the diving event,
Stanford's only cinch first place with
out Dick Smith, ace springboard art
ist of the Trojans. Smith's eligibility
has now been assured and the diving
contest between Roy Winkelmann
and the former will be a hot one.
Two of the best races of the after
noon will be the breast-stroke and
the back-stroke. Dick Whitney and
Bert Smith, two Los Angeles Jay
see transfers, will give Roy Vitousek
and Bill Weeden of the Cards good
| races in these respective events, with
chances of upsets in either direction.
| Captain Win Needham will swim
j both the 220 and the quarter for
| the Cards with a possibility of a
double win over the Trojans' Eugene
' Glasband, repeating his double win
i of last year.
| Saturday the varsity and frosh
i teams will journey to the Athens
' Club plunge in Oakland for the
Northern California Team Cham
pionships, open to all club and uni
versity teams. Competition will in
clude Olympic Club, Athens Club,
; San Jose State, San Francisco Y.M.
; C.A., Crystal Plunge, and others.
: Olympic Club will probably be the
outstanding winner by a 15-point
i lead, with the Stanford varsity sec
ond and Stanford frosh third.
