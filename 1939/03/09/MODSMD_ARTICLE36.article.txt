# A.T.O. Cagers Take Sigma Chis, 14-8
## Last Year's Titleholders Repeat Win Mural Basketball Winds UP With Defensive Struggle 
### 
A.T.O.'s newly crowned intra
mural quintet proved to the 150
cage fans that gathered in the Pa
vilion last night to witness their
crucial battle with Sigma Chi, that
they really deserved their title.
The second-year champs turned
back the Sigma Chi threat in a low
scoring duel, 14-8. In the prelimi
nary contest between the Japanese
Club and the Chinese Club the for
mer won, 33-21.
It was a hustling, scraping, ever
pressing A.T.O. five that brought j
home those two beautiful intramural
trophies: one, a gold statue for the
1939 winner, and the other, a full
sized silver basketball for the cur
rent champion.
BREAKS ICE
The two teams were tied up dur
ing the early part of the game and
it was three minutes before A.T.O.'s
plucky little guard, Jack Haraway, j
broke the ice with a free throw.
Jack Topham, Sigma Chi guard, re
taliated with another charity toss, j
but it took seven minutes of action
before Bob Koch found the hoop
for the first and his only field goal
of the game.
No, Koch and his fellow forward,
Kai Larson, were not the high point
men in this game. But in this sur
prising fact lay the secret of the I
A.T.O. triumph. Bob and Kai di
rected the winning offense and drew
the Sigma Chi defense onto them- i
selves, thus setting up their team |
mates Neal Sinclair and Barney Gill \
for timely field goals.
After the initial big Dick Neely. j
who was by the way high man of j
the tilt witlJj 6 digits, came back with !
a tying tip in. Then sub Gill went i
to work, dumping in two quick field !
goals which raised the count to 7-3 |
in favor of A.T.0., which was the
half-time score.
It looked as though the challeng- |
ing Sigma Chi outfit was loaded for I
the kill when they got their second J
field goal immediately after the sec- '
ond period opened on a tip 'in* by i
Neely.
Then it was Sinclair's turn to go j
to work and he handled his job well.
A two - handed jump shot from
thirty feet out was the first to hit i
and it was immediately followed by
a soaring one-hander from the cor- |
ner.
Then, as the score mounted to i
11-5 against them, the challengers
became panicky and started to I
crowd their opponents. But A.T.0,, i
fresh from plenty of substitutions, j
did a swell job of freezing the ball, j
while the ball-recovering play of
Siefert was close to sensational,
