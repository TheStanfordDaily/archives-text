# Rugby Team Set for Cal Tilt Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford ruggers are polishing off
the rough edges on their technique
j this week preparatory to the big tilt
I with Cal to be held here Saturday.
This game is all-important for the
ruggers, because if they take the
! long end of the score it will mean
the Pacific Coast intercollegiate
rugby championship for them. So
in spite of the rain and mud yester
, day afternoon, the ruggers put in
long hours of practice to get them
! selves in shape for Cal, and they
| will continue to do this for the rest
j of the week.
Cal is supposed to have a good
| forward line, according to reports
i received from Coach Will Classen.
! Plus this they have about five good
j men from the regular football line
j up. This means that the game will
be very interesting for the Card rug
i gers, unlike the pushover game with
| the Stanford Medical School last
i week.
The ruggers took U.S.C. early in
the season, and U.S.C. defeated Cal
several weeks ago. According to
j this, the Stanford ruggers should
stand a good chance of taking Cal
l Saturday,
