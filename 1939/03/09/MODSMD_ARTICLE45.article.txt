PAUSING for one brief half-hour in the midst
of morning classes, Stanford today looks
back, remembers the two persons to whom it
owes existence.
In the main, Stanford's low brown sandstone
buildings, its red tile roofs have accomplished
well the purpose for which they were built.
More than an educational institution, the
University manages to impress each one of
the many persons who compose its various
branches with an ethical and moral quality not
unlike a personality factor.
That quality is an intangible; it is a concept
that is an indefinite entity, yet it is recognizable
and it even lends itself to partial definition.
Above all, it stands for intellectual freedom.
How well Stanford's students are ingrained with
a respect for this factor is, of course, dependent
entirely upon the individual. Yet, most of them,
in time, at least lose the petty prejudices which
too often encumber the political, economic, and
social intelligence.
Second broad aspect of the Stanford ideal
is democracy. Shoved at most students for
years as an accepted value from viewpoints as
narrow as the viewpoints of persons accused
of totalitarianism, those same students find at
Stanford an opportunity to experiment with
democracy, find its real values.
What is perhaps just as important as these
two broad objectives, the Stanford way of im
pressing them is entirely consistent. Under
graduate life is as entirely free as it can be;
in the main, it has proved itself so.
Stanford's mode of life, the conduct of its
business, the regulation of its affairs is thor
oughly democratic.
And where these generalizations may be
disputed, the fault lies more often with the
individual than the institution or the system.
It is true that these concepts do not lend
themselves to enthusiastic contemplation; they
hardly take precedence over the problems of
day-to-day existence.
But with these at least partially in mind, Stan
ford, as it pauses today between classes to
remember its founders, can also appreciate the
fact that Stanford is as vital, as democratic, as
free as it was 48 years ago.
