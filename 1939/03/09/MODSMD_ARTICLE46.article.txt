STANFORD is an expensive place to go to
school. Although Senator and Mrs. Stan
ford founded the University with the idea of
providing free education for the children of
California, today this is the highest-priced co
educational institution in the West.
Despite the SI 15 rise in the cost of going to
Stanford, we have managed to maintain a
fundamental democratic standard, a code which
sets the man working his way through school
on a level slightly above the crowd, rather than
below it as is the case in too many other col
leges. Any scheme which will lessen the strain
on Father s billfold is regarded with favor on
the Farm.
The cost of textbooks is an imposing item in
the student budget, one that everyone would
like to see reduced first. In the past the Book
store has handled a few second-hand books

and down-town stores have sold them for sub
stantial profits. Now comes a project which
will enable students not only to purchase sec
ond-hand texts at reasonable prices, but to
dispose of their old books at prices they set
themselves.
Turning from its consideration of visionary
schemes and attempts to cure the world's ills
the leftist way, the A.S.U. has undertaken the
launching and management of a co-operative
book exchange. That the project undoubtedly
is the proper solution of the problem of expen
sive required texts is proved by the success of
similar set-ups at colleges throughout the coun
try.
A.S.U. members ask no return for the time
and effort they will contribute to the book
exchange other than the training in co-opera
tive economics, accounting, and management
it will afford. If the project is an overwhelming
success and expands enough to overflow the
confines of the room in the Union that has been
assigned to it, the student union will willingly
turn it over to the A.S.S.U. or any other organi
zation that wants it.
This is the solution to the textbook problem,
a long-time bee in Stanford's bonnet. Economic
royalists may argue that it sets a dangerous ex
ample by eliminating the profit motive, but it
is high time that expensive texts stop eating
into students' stipends, be they large or small.
When Mrs. Stanford pawned her jewels to
buy books for the University, she didn't mean
to establish a precedent.â€”L. L.
