COMMITTEE reacted with hazy but hopeful ap
proval last Tuesday when, it was presented with
our newest formula for perfect student government,
plans for the activity-coordinating committee. Ex
com's uncertainty arose not so much from lack of
comprehension as from lack of anything to compre
hend. The sponsors of the plan have not yet decided
just how the committee should work, or where it shall
fit into the machinery. But. in spite of the unknown
quantities, Ex Committee seemed to think that it had
found the magic formula.
I hate to see Ex Committee disappointed, and I
don't want to throw cold water on the millenium.
But as far as 1 can see the proposal does not provide
a one-way ticket to Utopia. At best it provides for
solving only a few minor problems; at worst it be
comes a problem in itself.

to latest specifications a committee
would be set up to keep records of all activity
men. It would check over A.S.S.U. and class appoint
ments and would recommend their approval or rejec
tion to Ex Committee. Its power would be purely
advisory but pressure could be applied through the
lever of Excom backing.
All of this is very fine and systematic; speculation
on its advantages is good entertainment for an idle
half hour. But with a little factoring, the magic formula
can be reduced to two principles, already familiar to
student government. One is that Ex Committee should
use due care in reviewing appointments. The other
is that executives should make appointments as care
fully and intelligently as possible. The new proposal
is simply a restatement of these accepted principles.

It. seems rather unnecessary to add to our innu
merable committees by appointing another one to
apply the already familiar rules. All the new group
can do is check appointments against the activity files,
and the custodian of the files is quite capable of doing
that without a committee.
It is also hard to see how the committee can walk
the tightrope between impotence and tyranny. Volun
teer groups must be appointed with an eye to con
geniality as well as to qualifications.

These possibilities are not particularly dangerous.,
The chances are that the committee will be harmless,
and it will be good fun for its members.
But the new proposal is not the solution of our
problems. It is simply a couple of the old remedies,
wrapped together and tied with pink ribbon.
