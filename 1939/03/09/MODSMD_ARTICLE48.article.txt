There arc more damn people who have Iwo dates
for Friday night. They got dates for the prom, then
the prom was called ofT, so they got other dates for
that night. Now the prom is on again.
It's rather curious. Is there one kind of girl who
is good for a Senior Prom and not for anything else?
And, conversely, are there girls who are good for
everything but a Senior Prom?
Why, in short, didn't those guys plan to take the
prom girl out Friday night anyway? Damn fools.

Two Roblc pirls were sitting in the Cellar. A couple
I of guys they didn't know came in and sat down near
I them.
The guys glanced down at the girls, muttered to
: themselves, and glanced down again. The Roble girls
probably giggled a little.
It was like that for quite a while; quick glances
and hushed mutterings. Finally one of the guys ap
proached the girls.
"We each have $1.50,'' he said. "Do you each have
$1.50, and if so would you like to go to the Prom?"
They each had five dollars. But they couldn't
change it. They call it their sacred five.

The most, if not the only, distinctive thing about
him is that he wears an overcoat. He wears it every
place. To bed. even, for all people know.
He is taking some sort of a seminar course this
quarter in which all the little students give one lec
ture during the quarters.
When the time came for his lecture, the prof and
the class conspired. The motive was subtle revenge.
They all wore overcoats to class and kept them on
all during his lecture.
I didn't hear whether the guy noticed the overcoats
or not. Because, you see, I got the story from a guy
on the outside who had seen the whole thing through
a window.
He said it looked very funny.
