# Ramshead One-Act Plays Produced By Students
## 
### 
A student organization! Ramshead was started as such and continues
its tradition by presenting next Friday and Saturday evenings in the
Little Theater three student-written one-act plays.
The plays were chosen from among 32 one-acts submitted to the
society in their contest of last January. They were "Angry Mountain"

►by June eLe Dimmitt, English
graduate; "Thirty Years" by Art
Levinson; and "Beginning Without
End," by Jim Stone. The authors
automatically became members of
Ramshead when their plays were
selected.
Direction, set designing and build
ing, props, costumes, make-up—ev
erything is done by the students.
Melba Rae Toombs, chairman of
one-act plays for Ramshead con
ducted the contest to choose the
plays and now is directing them, as
sisted by Kae Kalenborn. Johny
Paulson, the organization's technical
director, designed the sets and or
ganized the crew which is working
with him. Eleanor Williams has
charge of costuming for the three
productions and Margaret Green
well is taking care of the props. A
student crew under Bob Norton will
do the make-up.
Students working on Paulson's
crew are Lloyd Henley, Bob Leps,
Lois Feldheym, Helen Richards,
Mary Lou Hieber, Pauline Deuel,
Bca Bliss, Harry Fair, Wilma Fitts,
Roger White, John Sontheimer,
Merle Meacham, Judy Spalding,
Betty Wood, Mary Etta Farrell, and
Jack Dawson. They are working on
sets which represent such a variety
! of backgrounds as an army bar-
I racks, a Tyrolean inn, and a board
ing house.
