## 
### 
"Opera since the War has gotten
away from the illusory quality
which has been de rigueur in the
art since Richard Wagner, and has
instead turned to the more realistic,
and vigorous impressionism of thp
modern play fornW said Ernst
Krenek, famed modern composer,
yesterday in his lecture on "Mod
em Opera."
Illustrating his lecture with piano
excerpts from his own "Jonny
Spielt Auf" and selections from an
opera of the Czech composer,
Janacak, Krenek showed that the
short motif, suitable to the cadence
of the spoken word, is now used.
The composer feels that touring
or "chamber" opera companies us
ing small, but excellently trained
artists, and simple settings, here in
the United States, may do much to
revive modern opera as opposed to
the old type of repertory opera fea
turing stars and ostentatious mount
ings now being used.
Krenek feels that, the immigration
of many of the modern European
artists, such as himself, may do much
to advance the new opera in the
counti'y.
