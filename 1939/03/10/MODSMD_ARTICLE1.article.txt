### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
JIERE it is Monday, and already
the map of Europe has suffered
another change. On Friday last a
bright green Albania nestled close
to the Adriatic on the atlas page, but
today its complexion has changed to
an Italian purple. Overnight the lit
tle mountain kingdom has become a
Fascist province.
With typical twentieth century
rapidity the nations of Europe re
verse their political status and na
tional allegiance in this age of
Caesars. The campaigns of Roman
generals look like child's play when
compared with the feats of the auto
crats of Germany and Italy, blithely
disposing of Czechoslovakia and Al
bania.
* * *
If was a sad and Hitter King Zog
who fled to Greece this week-end
when Mussolini's 6-foot Italian
troopers invaded his capital. Yes
terday, out of shooting hut still
within shouting range, he de
nounced Hitler and II I)ucc as
madmen and called Chamberlain
and Daladier "two damn fools
who are asleep."
Quite understandably his attitude
is like that of a Stanford man whose
roommate sleeps while a bunch of
his friends tie him to a chair and
proceed to stack his room. Evidently
his subjects in Tirana have already
forgotten poor King Zog, for yester
day they offered their Italian con
querors a rousing welcome and made
ready for the arirval of II Duce
himself who plans to fly to Albania
today.
* * *
lIOWEVER, at the same time that
stocky Albanian maidens wel
comed Fascist soldiers in the capital,
bands of fierce mountaineers were
sniping Italian troops advancing
toward the Jugoslavian frontier.
These continental hillbillies are re
solved to defend their land to the
death, and although the government
of Albania is in Mussolini's hands,
he is sure to experience difficulty in
subjugating the back country.
Across the border, the Jugo
slavians have declared their in
tention of remaining completely
neutral, and they seem to he ig
noring the alluring glances of both
.the Chamberlain alliance and the
Rome-Berlin axis.
Now that II Duce has gained a
stronghold in southeastern Europe,
England is more alarm
ed at the dangers.that the situation
presents. To the Chamberlain min
istry, Greece appears as just as like
ly a tinder-box on that part of the
continent as Poland does in the
northeast.
Herr Hitler makes no bones about
the fact that he has designs on Dan
zig and the Polish Corridor, and as
the Fuehrer goes, so goes II Duce.
If it, isn't Poland, it may be Greece;
so Britain is preparing to negotiate
for a defense alliance with the Ae
gean peninsula, which it fears is too
near Albania for comfort.
* * *
HTHE news is full of changes and
alliances in the European
scene, and still it seems that some
thing more is happening, some
thing that no one can he sure
about. Indications arc that both
France and England fear a sur
prise attack from the totalitarian
states, a sudden and ferocious
blast which might cripple them
before they had a chance to strike
back.
Such an attack, however, will find
Chamberlain and Daladier pre
pared. Yesterday, Easter Sunday,
found both governments holding
councils of war as Pope Pius XII
prayed for peace in Rome. That
such a military conference should
take place on Easter in Catholic
France is indicative of the gravity
of the situation.

lIOWEVER, at the same time that
stocky Albanian maidens wel
comed Fascist soldiers in the capital,
bands of fierce mountaineers were
sniping Italian troops advancing
toward the Jugoslavian frontier.
These continental hillbillies are re
solved to defend their land to the
death, and although the government
of Albania is in Mussolini's hands,
he is sure to experience difficulty in
subjugating the back country.
Across the border, the Jugo
slavians have declared their in
tention of remaining completely
neutral, and they seem to he ig
noring the alluring glances of both
.the Chamberlain alliance and the
Rome-Berlin axis.
Now that II Duce has gained a
stronghold in southeastern Europe,
England is more alarm
ed at the dangers.that the situation
presents. To the Chamberlain min
istry, Greece appears as just as like

continent as Poland does in the
northeast.
Herr Hitler makes no bones about
the fact that he has designs on Dan
zig and the Polish Corridor, and as
the Fuehrer goes, so goes II Duce.
If it, isn't Poland, it may be Greece;
so Britain is preparing to negotiate
for a defense alliance with the Ae

HTHE news is full of changes and

scene, and still it seems that some
thing more is happening, some
thing that no one can he sure
about. Indications arc that both
France and England fear a sur

states, a sudden and ferocious
blast which might cripple them
before they had a chance to strike
back.
Such an attack, however, will find
Chamberlain and Daladier pre
pared. Yesterday, Easter Sunday,
found both governments holding
councils of war as Pope Pius XII
prayed for peace in Rome. That
such a military conference should
take place on Easter in Catholic

Prime Minister Neville Chamber

in Scotland to spend the day con

Viscount Halifax and diplomatic
representatives of Italy, Greece, Al

Although Mussolini's charge d'af
faires assured the British that his
country has no further ambitions in
southeastern Europe, now that it
has disposed of Albania, Viscount.
Halifax seemed doubtful about the
whole situation.
JIERE it is Monday, and already
the map of Europe has suffered
another change. On Friday last a
bright green Albania nestled close
to the Adriatic on the atlas page, but
today its complexion has changed to
an Italian purple. Overnight the lit
tle mountain kingdom has become a
Fascist province.
With typical twentieth century
rapidity the nations of Europe re
verse their political status and na

generals look like child's play when
