# Majority Of Costs Paid By Stanford
## Average Annual Fees Of $377 Matched By University's $444 
### JOHN COBBS 
From each student Stanford Uni
i versity receives an average of $377
per year in tuition and fees; it
matches this with $444, according to
| figures recently released in the
! Comptroller's report, included in the
j annual Report of the President.
Other significant facts indicated by
the figures are an increase in main
tenance cost on the physical plant
of the University, and a moderate
increase in income available for
I budgeting.
Income from tuition and fees
| amounted to $1,533,565.92 for the
academic year 1937-38. This was
I approximately 45.9 per cent of the
total income to the University.
Average tuition that funnels in
j under the make-checks-payable
! sign is slightly more than $345 per
year for each student. The average
sum of sylalbus fee bills which
rock shaky bank accounts three
times yearly is $32 per student.
TOTAL AMOUNT $821
This means that the total amount
expended by the University for each
of her step-children is $821. With
tuition and fees subtracted, this
leaves $444 to be provided by the
University from its other income.
Bulk of the tSanford income is de
i rived from the endowment, which is
! invested largely in stocks and bonds.
During the past year this furnished
about 39 per cent of the total in
come. The rest is made* up of gifts
and income from subsidiary or
! ganizations such as the B.A.C.
| Total operating income amounted
j to aobut three-and-a-third million
dollars. Of this, 12.3 per cent was
allotted to the comptroller's office,
j the remainder going to academic ex
j penditures. One half of the previous
| faculty salary cut was restored this
i year, bringing salaries back to 95
j cent of normal.
INCOME INCREASES
Income this year showed an in
crease of almost an even $100,000
over the previous fiscal term. This
' was in spite of the fact that there
was a decline of about 15-hun
i dredths of 1 per cent, in the average
| return on investments. The average
I return this year was 4.04 per cent.
Although below last year, this is
still considerably above the preced
ing two years.
Significant among the figures were
those indicating a general rise in
maintenance costs on the Univer
sity plant. Janitor costs rose to
$36,379, which represents an increase
of $4,000 over the same expense of
the previous year. Electricity costs
j reached $41,650, which is a $3,000
rise.
' BUILDING COSTS
| According to the comments of J.
! Hugh Jackson, acting comptroller,
| the addition of new buildings is
largely responsible for the increased
j cost. Maintenance expense increas
|es directly with additions to the
| plant; it also rises as the physical
J equipment grows and requires more
| repair. Stanford is located directly
| between the two eight-balls.
Maintenance, the comptroller stat
ed. has been kept at a minimum dur
ing the year. The budget for the
comptroller's division has not been
increased, remaining at about $400,-
000.
But many improvements and re
pairs not immediately necessary
have been postponed. Eventually
this deferred maintenance will have
I to appear iji the budget-
Heading a list of needed improve-
I ments is a revision of the heating
system, a fact to which students will
j testily. Steam mains installed some
] 25 years ago are overloaded,
j "Immediate consideration must be
' given to the enlargement of existing
mains and to additional extensions,"
the report reveals. Preliminary es
timates indicate that this will cost
some $24,000.
