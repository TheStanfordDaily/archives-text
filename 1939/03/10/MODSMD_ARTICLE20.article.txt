# Four Hats Fill Ring In Presidential Race
## Halls to Caucus Tonight, Choose Official Slate 
### HARRY PRESS 
For the first time in the memory
j of the oldest Farm Farleys, a cam
| paign conducted on ethics and ideals
was launched yesterday as the first
j surprise move in the annual spring
1 election finagling, 1939 edition.
Gene Coldiron, Phi Delt junior,
announced his candidacy for the
A.S.S.U. presidency, on a ticket
vaguely labeled "independent"
The correctness of this designa
tion, however, seems to be in doubt,
as friends of Coldiron are claiming

unofficial Lower Row support, based
on the theory of general approval,
with no promises or contracts in
volved.
Coldiron's "platform" is based, ac
cording to his statement released
yesterday, on the high ideal of
elimination of petty politics and
bickering which are engendered by
the present system of split caucuses
on the Row.
"Politics on the Row at Stanford,"
the statement read, "used to operate
through one caucus, intended to
choose representative political can
didates.
"Unfortunately, in the last few
years, there have developed sub
caucuses in which there is so much
wrangling and mud-slinging, and
ill-feeling, that I feel it necessary
to maintain a policy of 'hands off'
toward such organizations."
HALL CiETS JUMP
First politiconfab in the campaign
gained the Hall machines a four-day
jump when Interclub Council met
last Thursday night to draw up a
slate which will be presented to
night at the oflicial Hall caucus at
10 o'clock in the Toyon lobby.
Andy Stojkovich heads the slate,
the remainder of which has not been
revealed.
A rebel group has threatened the
stability of tonight's Hall caucus,
aiming to pack the meeting to swing
the vote toward their candidate,
who is rumored to be Johnny Port
er, Sequoia.
LAUGir AT THREAT
Conservative Hall big-wigs, how
ever, laughed at the threat, claiming
complete control of their machine,
which they say includes Sequioa, as
well as Lagunita, Toyon, Branner,
and the main cogs in the Independ
ent organization.
Persistent rumor creeping from
cracks in the Hall political wall in
timated that other names listed on
the Interclub Council slate included
Bob Livingston for senior class
president; Bob Low, junior class
president; Fran Dubois, senior man
on Ex Committee; and A1 Horn,
graduate member on Ex Committee.
Upper Row moguls claim that their
1939 machine, which proved so pot
ent. last year, has lost none of its
eßiicency. This outfit's smart money
is being placed on Delt Ken Cuth
bertson, junior class president.
A wee bit of sentimentality is
added to the picture with the rumor
that Bob Richardson, Phi Psi, is to
be run as Cuthbertson's team-mate,
for the position of senior class
president.
Those who tell the story say thai
Cuthbertson and Richardson, while
in their embryonic political develop
ment a year or so ago, signed a
blood pact to run together for Stan
ford's two top positions.
Very indefinite rumors emanating
