# 'Doubling-up' Of Hour Ex's To Be Banned
## 
### 
Coming as the result of students'
complaints objecting to two exams
on the same day, the departments of
economics, history, philosophy, po
litical science, and psychology, adn
the divisions of journalism and so
ciology in the School of Social Sci
ences have agreed to schedule one
hour examinations on different days.
The schedule agreed upon is as
follows:
8 o'clock exams —Tuesday
9 o'clock exams -Monday or Fri
day
10 o'clock exams—Wednesday
11 o'clock exams—Thursday
An option is offered in the case of
9 o'clock courses because some do
not meet Mondays and others do not
meet Fridays.
The matter was first discussed
February when the complaint was
formally filed with the heads of de
partments. The schedule was made
up by the Department of Social Sci
ences, the largest in the school,
which forwarded it to other depart
ments with a suggestion that they
compose similar schedules.
