# Short Pit Robs Star of Record
## Frosh Trackmen Wallop Sacred Heart 
### 
Simply because he heaved the 12-
pound shot-put farther than the pit
allowed, Delaney, sensational shot
putter from Sacred Heart, did not
break the world's interscholastic rec
ord Saturday.
Delaney's win in the shot-put, and
Leary's win in the mile run were
the only two firsts taken by the
visiting Sacred Heart team in their
encounter with the Stanford frosh.
Delaney was responsible for eight
of his team's 26 points, while Pete
Kmetovic, (he outstanding Stanford
frosh, garnered ten of his team's 82
points.
Delaney put ihe shot 58 feet, the
full length of the shot pit, but the
shot hit the foot-high backstop in
mid-air and bounded back into the
pit. Stanford Coach Dink Temple
ton said that if the backstop had not
been where it was, Delaney's heave
would have exceeded by at least 2
inches Ihe world's interscholastic
record of 58 ft. 10 in. Delaney, in a
previous meet, had thrown the shot
58 ft. 8 in., only two inches from
the coveted world's record.
