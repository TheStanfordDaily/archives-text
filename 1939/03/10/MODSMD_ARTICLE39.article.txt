## Noseouts In Hurdles, 880 Fatal Card Squad Shows Improvement; Fast Times Recorded 
### 
Fifteen years had passed since
Stanford's track team competed in a
major track meet ending in a tie.
That was until last Saturday when
the Cards and Olympic Club evenly
j split the 131 points given in a regu
lar dual meet. The Clubmen showed
their expected brilliance but also
i had plenty of conditioning and depth
I with which to haul themselves into
[ a tie with the powerful, fasl-improv-
I ing Indians.
I At about two-thirds of the way
through the meet, Dink Templeton's
squad appeared headed for victory,
leading 45-36. But Bill McCurdy,
former Cardinal track captain.
; surged from behind in the final
I stretch of the 880 to take "Muchy"
I Girard by three yards, while Greg
j Stout sneaked in for a valuable
j third-place point.
Then followed a distressing two
j mile in which Ed Preston won eas
| ily for the Club over A1 Soldrite.
! The .real heartbreaker was that flight
lof low hurdles in which Captain
J Stan Hiserman led until the final
I barrier, only to be nipped by inches
j in the final two yards by Tom
Moore.
TAKE VAULT
The pole vault further enhanced
| the growing Olympic Club total
I when Warmberdam topped the bar
I at 14 feet and Peters grabbed a tie
lor third. Phil Fox, formerly Levy,
I and Gordy Dunn delivered the final
| blow which raised the Club's score
; to 65','â– >.
Only a matter of form was the
1 relay which was run only after both
Coaches Templeton and Charlie
Hunter had coaxed Jack Weiershau
j ser out of the stands and into the
j race for convention's sake. The In
j dians won by 80 yards in their best
time this year, 3:19.
Clyde Jeffrey was superb in win
| ning his 9.6 century and in coming
I back to take a 21-fiat furlong. Mc-
Curdy did more than his share,
j fighting his way through a blanket
| of Cardinals to take the quarter as
! well .as the above-mentioned peiv
' formance in the 880.
DOUBLE WINNER
The third double winner was
hurdler Moore, ex-California star.
Battling at even terms with Stan
j ford's Bill Hawkins in the high
i barriers until the eighth hurdle,
which "Hawk" nicked, Moore forged
ahead to win in a blistering 14.5
llight.. His final burst of speed in
the low hurdles as well as the early
season time of 23.8 was remarkable.
Other bright spots in the meet
were furnished by Bill Wohle and
Stan Andersen, both of whom ex
ceeded 52 feet in the shot to finish
one-two in that order. Then there
was a leap by Les Steers, competing
unattached, of 6 ft. 5 in. in the high
jump, plus Girard's winning time of
4:20.4 in the mile.
Most satisfactory to Dink Tem
j pleton were the improved perform
ances turned in by 10 men. Bill
Braheny improved six feet in the
javelin, moving up to the 200-foot
, mark. Though Karl Thursby took
only a fourth in this event he im
proved seven feet to 188 feet.
Wohle's toss of 52 ft. 6 in. in the
shot was almost a foot better than
his previous efforts in competition
this year.
