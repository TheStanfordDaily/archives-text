IN little more than a week, Stanford must have
elected its A.S.S.U. officers for next year.
In the midst of the latest dope from the politi
cal front—that is, what there is of it—the neces
sity for speeding up the Farm's pre-election
machinery to fit the 1939 situation is only too
apparent.
The Halls are meeting tonight ostensibly to
pick their joint slate; the Row hasn't yet set as
definite a date, but House walls already have
begun to hear the whisper of Farm cigai
smokers in chapter rooms, under parking-strip
trees, over dinner tables.
There's going to have to be huge quantities
of political shop talk this year, however; there
must be much pre-election back-slapping. The
situation this year is such that it will be neces
sary to bring anybody to any agreement on
anything.
Some of the preliminary dog-fights, pressure
group agreements and disagreements are de
scribed on page one. There are doubtless many
more that have not yet come to the surface. The
Daily will try to keep as best track as it can of
political movements in the next few days.
In the meantime, politicos promise "a cam
paign conducted on ethics and ideals." They
seem to have absorbed something from political
science classes after all.
For reasons other than trying to line the boys
up by slipping a few over, however, they'd bet
ter watch Ttanforan's dark horses and absorb a
little speed.
Election Day, April 18—"a campaign con
ducted on ethics and ideals." Whew!
