WHEN a man offers you SlOO,OOO, the natural
thing to do is to accept it. Chances are
that anyone who would refuse such a gift is
either too rich for comfort or a bit on the
balmy side.
When a benefactor offers the University a
new building, it appears that the only sensible
move the Administration can make is to accept
it with thanks. But surface impressions of such
matters are likely to prove misleading.
During the past three years Stanford has
graciously accepted a theater, an education
building, and an outdoor amphitheater. It is
awaiting the construction of the new Hoover
library. At the same time the Comptroller's
budget, which must cover the expense of main
tenance for these buildings, has not been in
creased.
Figures in the latest President's Report indi
cate that $14,000 of last year's regular appropria
tion was used for the upkeep of the Cubberley
Building and Memorial Hall.
Question: How can the University spend this
extra money and get along with an unincreased
appropriation?
Answer: A large proportion of the regular
maintenance jobs has been deferred until an
unknown date in the future.
Sooner or later, the day will come when this
work must be done. As Stanford's plant grows
older, its upkeep becomes more expensive. The
longer these repairs are put off, the higher will
be the bills.
So it seems that in spite of an apparent flaw
in logic, the University really cannot afford to
accept any more buildings.
Additions to our academic halls have struck
the point of diminishing returns —unless our
benefactors will include appropriations for
maintenance in their gifts.—L. L.
