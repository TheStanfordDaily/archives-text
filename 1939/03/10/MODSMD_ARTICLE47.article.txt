# Good Move, No. 2

### 
SECOND move in the adoption of a Stanford
wide schedule for mid-quarter examinations
was the all-inclusive agreement issued last
week by the School of Social Sciences and its
various departments and divisions.
Examinations, the announcement said, will
be given on certain days of the week accord
ing to the meeting time of the class.
For some long time, the scheduling of exam
inations has been a sort of indefinite fight be
tween professors and students or students with
one kind of program and students with other
kinds of programs as to dates on which they
should be given.
With the social sciences falling into line with
the schedule policy, it perhaps won't be too
long before the rest of the schools and depart
ments adopt a similar agreement.
The advantages of the plan are almost too
obvious. In the first place, the schedule almost
invariably works out with any combination of

[ classes so that students won't be saddled with
two or three exams on one day.
In the second place, it gives professors a
definite, yet not too rigid method of fixing ex
amination dates with no gripes, comments, or
come-backs.
i There seems to be little reason why the plan
j should not be extended.
Examinations, at best, are a dubious proposi
tion; without conflicts and pile-ups they should
be a little less tedious.
