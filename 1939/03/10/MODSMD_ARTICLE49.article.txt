# BULL SESSION
## YOU'VE HAD A DIZZY DAY 
### JOHN COBBS 
IT DISTRESSES me to waste a beautiful day in the
Easter season giving a lesson in elementary logic
to a correspondent whose enthusiasm henpecks his
judgment into submission. But last Friday a man
signing himself "The Little Man Who Was at the
Meeting" stamped through the Campus Opinion col
umn, very much excited about my recent comments
on the honor code.
He said that Bull Session had given an inaccurate
report of a student-faculty discussion of the code,
held just before vacation. He pointed out that the
meeting was initiated by students and that most of
the professors present seemed quite happy and content
with the present system. The faculty, he said, was
not trying to remodel the honor code. I also gather
that he thinks I beat my mother and that I probably
club little newsboys for their pennies.
* »!t »}••
The main objection to the little man's criticism
is that I have never attempted to report that meet
ing. In fact there is no mention at all of the meeting
in either of the columns that upset the little man's
hormone balance.
I said that during the last finals week several pro
fessors sabotaged the honor code by placing unneces
sary and rather insulting restrictions on their students.
They informed the students that the examination must
be written in a particular room, or that texts were to
be checked in at the professor's office.
* * *
T ALSO said that there were a few people on the
campus who seemed determined to revise the honor
code according to their own plans. These include both
faculty and students. I am not concerned with which
side of the academic fence they clutter; but I am very
much interested in their desire to take a screwdriver
to the present system.
The meeting itself was thoroughly harmless, like
all such meetings; and I enjoyed the evening although
I did not leave particularly impressed with the rea
soning powers of mankind. The only danger is that
some of the ideas advanced may be used as an excuse
for tinkering, but that is not an issue here.
* * »Jc *
When the professors revised the unwritten rules of
the honor code and conditioned the appeal to the stu
dents' honor, they committed a very real assault, on
the code. And they did it on their own initiative;
Ihey cannot plead that the students put them up to it.
When students or professors demand revision of the
present machinery, they are risking the success of the
system. They cannot complain if we call it a poor busi
ness risk.
The honor code as it now stands works as effi
ciently as the law of averages permits. We are con
vinced that, it works better than any proctor system.
And we don't see how we can expect to improve it by
restricting its operation. We have faith in the propo
sition th;>.t the number of students who cannot be
trusted is negligible. And we are not willing to
wreck our present system trying to put the incor
rigibles beyond temptation.
My correspondent mentioned none of this. He
spoke only of a meeting. I am concerned with that
meeting one way or another.

When students or professors demand revision of the
present machinery, they are risking the success of the
system. They cannot complain if we call it a poor busi
ness risk.
The honor code as it now stands works as effi
ciently as the law of averages permits. We are con
vinced that, it works better than any proctor system.
And we don't see how we can expect to improve it by
restricting its operation. We have faith in the propo
sition th;>.t the number of students who cannot be
trusted is negligible. And we are not willing to
wreck our present system trying to put the incor
rigibles beyond temptation.
My correspondent mentioned none of this. He
spoke only of a meeting. I am concerned with that
meeting one way or another.
Little man, so what?
IT DISTRESSES me to waste a beautiful day in the
Easter season giving a lesson in elementary logic
to a correspondent whose enthusiasm henpecks his
judgment into submission. But last Friday a man
signing himself "The Little Man Who Was at the
Meeting" stamped through the Campus Opinion col
umn, very much excited about my recent comments
on the honor code.
He said that Bull Session had given an inaccurate
report of a student-faculty discussion of the code,
held just before vacation. He pointed out that the
meeting was initiated by students and that most of
the professors present seemed quite happy and content
with the present system. The faculty, he said, was
not trying to remodel the honor code. I also gather
that he thinks I beat my mother and that I probably
club little newsboys for their pennies.

The main objection to the little man's criticism
is that I have never attempted to report that meet
ing. In fact there is no mention at all of the meeting
in either of the columns that upset the little man's
hormone balance.
I said that during the last finals week several pro
fessors sabotaged the honor code by placing unneces
sary and rather insulting restrictions on their students.
They informed the students that the examination must
be written in a particular room, or that texts were to
be checked in at the professor's office.

T ALSO said that there were a few people on the
campus who seemed determined to revise the honor
code according to their own plans. These include both
faculty and students. I am not concerned with which
side of the academic fence they clutter; but I am very
much interested in their desire to take a screwdriver
to the present system.
The meeting itself was thoroughly harmless, like
all such meetings; and I enjoyed the evening although
I did not leave particularly impressed with the rea
soning powers of mankind. The only danger is that
some of the ideas advanced may be used as an excuse
for tinkering, but that is not an issue here.

When the professors revised the unwritten rules of
the honor code and conditioned the appeal to the stu
dents' honor, they committed a very real assault, on
the code. And they did it on their own initiative;
