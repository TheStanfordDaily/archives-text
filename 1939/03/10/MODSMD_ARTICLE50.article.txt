WILD WEST
It is enough to say that ho is a very romantic guy, a
life -is - beautiful - and-sentiment-is-sweet-but-not
siekly sort of an egg.
With malice aforethought, we asked him if he liked
the movie "Dodge City" which we knew he had seen.
"Sure," he said, "it was exeiting."
"But do you think there was enough romance in
it?" we asked him very seriously.
"Well, yes. He kissed her three times."
"But such quick kisses."
"Oh well, that was probably the way they did back
then," he said. "They grabbed them, kissed them, and
then sent them back in to knit."

PLAYING THE PONIES
A few of the boys went up to Tanforan the other
afternoon and were having considerable luck with
their bets. Knowing nothing about the horses, they
had developed their own system: they would place two
bets at each race. One on the favorite and one on the
horse with the biggest odds.
They were a little ahead of the game when their
big race came up. It was their big race because they
could get odds on one horse at 17 to 1. He was num
ber one.
One of (he boys went down to put $2 on him and
$2 on (he favorite. The race started; the least you can
say is that they were overjoyed to see their horse,
number one, win.
In the midst of their rejoicing Ihev got out the
tickets to collect their winnings—and found that their
friend had accidentally placed the bet. on number two,
the horse that had won for them the last time.
He swears it was an accident.
EVANGELINE

ning himself on his sun porch Saturday afternoon.
Someone yelled that he was wanted on the phone; a
girl's voice.
He thought it. was another of the committee heads,
a girl who had been calling him a good bit about
some business connected with the prom. At (hat point
lying in the sun was more important than the Junior
Prom.
"Ah, tell her to go to hell." he said. "Tell her I'm
not here."
Later he found out that the girl on the phone was
