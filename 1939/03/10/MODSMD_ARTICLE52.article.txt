# Deval Comedy Scores; Repeat Showing Planned
## 
### 
Robert Emmet Sherwood's adap- ]
tation of Jacques Deval's amusing !
international comedy, "Tovarich," j
scored such a distinct audience suc
cess in Memorial Hall auditorium
last Saturday night that Stanford's
alumni association, sponsors of the
play, decided to present a repeat
performance next Friday evening,
Waldemar Johansen, technical di
rector, announced.
Repetition of the show depends
upon the approval of the Committee
on Public Exercises.
With Melba Rae Toombs adding
another triumph to an impressive
record, "Tovarich," far from a
smooth production, fell back time
and again on a few standout, char- j
acterizations and the uniformly ex- J
cellent Deval-Sherwood dialogue. !
Technical direction by Waldemar
Johansen and William Bassett was
superior. Sets were marvelously
authentic in design and execution,
beautifully proportioned. Dramatic
direction by Hugh Gillis was ap- j
parently inadequate, lacked profes- '
sional treatment-
Playing the role of Grand Duchess !
Tatiana, Miss Toombs captured at
once the gaiety, depth, and straight- j
forward simplicity of the exiled I
noblewoman. Several times she'
pulled shaky scenes out of the fire :
with deft, sure charm.
James Clancy as Prince Mikail j
OuratiefT, her husband, proved a sat

isfactory leading man, tossing in the
requisite touch of swagger to make
the ex-army general convincing.
One of the most convincing roles
was that of Banker Charles Dupont,
employer of the emigres. A. Grove
Day plugged the part to the limit,
lapsed into burlesque now and then.
His wife, Fernande, was sympa
thetically handled by Ann Gardner
Wayland.
The Dupont children, taken by
William Goetze and Jeanette Rosen
feld, were natural.

Commissar Gorotchenko, Basil
Rathbone to perfection, was filled
with suave villainy by William
Pabst. His entrance in the first
scene of Act II was a high point. In
the final scene he played the Soviet
"heavy" to the hilt.—Hutchinson
