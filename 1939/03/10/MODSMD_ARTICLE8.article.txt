# ‘Europe Will Have No War,’ Predicts Professor Morgan
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
"There will be no war in Eu
rope!"
Surprising as this may sound, it
is the expressed opinion of Profes
sor Bayard Q. Morgan of the Ger
man department, who recently re
turned from a three-months trip to
Germany, England, Switzerland, and
the Scandinavian countries.
Explaining the "no war" state
ment, Professor Morgan stated, "In
the first place, neither side can
stand the destruction which will ac
company a conflict. Secondly, it is
not possible to find an issue that is
both sufficiently concrete and com
pelling to induce the people to fight.
And finally, the game would not be
worth the candle."
Also surprising is the professor's
revelation that from his contact with
the German people he received the
impression that very few of them
believe that Germany could wage a
successful war against France and
Britain, even without the military
aid of the United States.
GERMANS ACCEPT NAZIISM
Professor Morgan, speaking of the
temperament of the German people,
declared that "the majority of them
feel that what their government has
done since the World War was in
evitable. They feel that they were
virtually in a state of war. There
fore they obeyed orders, some of
which they didn't understand, some
of which they didn't approve but
felt it best to obey.
"The people on the whole are
pretty well informed. When one
source of information is blocked,
other sources soon take its place."
This docs not hold true of coming
cvenls, and evidently did not hold

true with regard to Germany's re- j
cent occupation of large parts of j
Czechoslovakia. Although Professor!
Morgan left Germany March 2, cor- j
respondence with his wife, now re
siding in Dresden, reveals that up
to the time of the invasion the
people knew nothing of the move
ment. There were troops passing
through Dresden, but the inhabit- |
ants did not know where they were j
going.
NEW POLICY MISTAKE'
The professor would not venture a j
prediction as to Hitler's recent
threats toward Poland. "Ever since
I was there, Germany is seemingly
embarking on a new policy, which
renders any prediction too difficult.
I regard this new policy as a mis
take not likely to command popular
support. Germany will eventually
obtain Danzig, but no colonies will
be given back to her, under the j
present regime."
Professor Morgan said that, he |
saw no war preparations going on [
in London. "I saw lots of stupid j
trench work in parks, but even the I
English people thought that this j
was just an attempt to get them !
thinking in military terms."
In answer to a final question, Pro- !
fessor Morgan concluded, "I do think
Germans respond to an authoritar
ian system. They do not mind
obeying, and they like to give or
ders. If the republic formed at
Weimar after the World War had
been given a square deal by France
and England, I think we would not
have National Socialism in Germany
today."
