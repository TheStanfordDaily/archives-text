# 'Peg' Ends Sad Sunday Series
## 
### 
Marking the inauspicious ending
of the Sunday Movie Series for this
year, Tri-National's "Peg of Old
Drury Lane" drew a small crowd in
Memorial Hall last night.
Though Ccdric Hardwicke does
some excellent selections from
Shakespeare and Anna Neagle is
vivacious, to say the least, the Brit
ish-produced drama ignores even
elementary cinematic technique.
Pitched against the rich background
of 18th century London, the story
unravels slowly. Hardwicke as the
great DaVid Garrick and Miss
Neagle as his protege are aided by
an experienced English cast directed
by Herbert Wilcox.â€”Eden
