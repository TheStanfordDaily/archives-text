took finals. Stanford
went home to Weed Patch or
vacationed at Carmel, in Southern
California, at the Fair. But there
were days and days when anxious
eyes devoured the morning papers
and anxious ears listened intently to
radio news bulletins.
Here, on the other side of the
world, we felt Europe tremble as
Czechoslovakia ceased to exist, and
peace hung perilously in doubt. The
tramping feet of the troops of Adolf
Hitler advancing into Slovakia, the
landing of the battleship of Adolf
Hitler at Memel, the voice of Adolf
Htiler speaking at Wilhelmshaven
were heard distinctly, fearfully, 7000
miles away in California.

As Germany seized (he lands
whose integrity she had guaran
teed in the Munich Pact, as she
foreswore her avowal to rule only
those people who had once been
part of the German Empire, the
eyes of the world turned to Brit
ain and rested on the man who
had kept Europe from war the
past September. Neville Chamber
lain — like a tired middle-class
merchant he grasped the handle
of his umbrella a little more tight
ly, and decided that the time had
come to take action.
After months of vacillating pol
icy, born in a terrified desire for
peace-at-any-price and fumbling
nursed along in the form of "ap
peasement," the infant Chamberlain
burst from his swaddling clothes
and told the world that England in
tends to halt Hitler.
* * *
his announcement that
Britain will come to the aid of
Poland if the Nazis decide to swal
low up other nations as they did
Czechoslovakia, the Prime Minister
proved that no longer will he trust
the paper pledges of Adolf Hitler.
Mr. Chamberlain has at last come
to realize that the only way to pro
tect central Europe from the ex
panding Reich is to keep armed force
ready and willing to repulse its
moves.
Yesierday in an historic speech
to Parliament, England's leader
called upon the European nations
to form a defensive alliance to
prevent any further German ag
gression. His declared purpose is
not to squeeze the Reich in an
anti-Hitler vise, but merely to be
sure that der Fuehrer is not going
to fool England and France again.

I RESPITE his declarations to the
contrary, Prime Minister Cham
berlain is attempting to build a de
fensive wall of bayonets around
Germany. The Franco-British al
liance is strong, Poland's Foreign
Minister Beck is conferring in Lon
don today, and overtures have been
made to a Rumania economically
dominated by the Nazis.
Thus the England whose stand
was so uncertain immediately before
the start of the first World War, the
England that did not move to save
Czechoslovakia from Adolf Hitler in
1938 and '39, has at last taken an
active resolve. One more move by
Germany and Britain and her allies
will fight—so they say.

Chamberlain's address to the
Commons quickly brought a sharp
reaction from Nazidom yesterday.
Herr Hitler's official press defi
antly replied that the Reich will
repulse with force any attempt to
interfere with her territorial proj
ects.
The Nazis declare that they will
not wait until Britain has complet
ed an iron ring around them, but
will strike before the forging of the
bond is completed.
One weak spot exists in Mr.
Chamberlain's idea — Soviet Russia
doesn't seem to want to co-operate.
The mighty, mysterious power of
eastern Europe denies that it has
pledged support to Poland, is leery
of alliances with England, and may
put an end to the whole idea.

Chamberlain's address to the
Commons quickly brought a sharp
reaction from Nazidom yesterday.
Herr Hitler's official press defi
antly replied that the Reich will
repulse with force any attempt to
interfere with her territorial proj

The Nazis declare that they will
not wait until Britain has complet
ed an iron ring around them, but
will strike before the forging of the
bond is completed.
One weak spot exists in Mr.
Chamberlain's idea — Soviet Russia
doesn't seem to want to co-operate.
The mighty, mysterious power of
eastern Europe denies that it has
pledged support to Poland, is leery
of alliances with England, and may
put an end to the whole idea.

Here, on the other side of the

Czechoslovakia ceased to exist, and
peace hung perilously in doubt. The

Yesierday in an historic speech
to Parliament, England's leader
called upon the European nations
