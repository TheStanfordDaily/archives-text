# Annex to Union Nears Completion
## 
### 
Work on the new addition to the
Union public dining hall has been
progressing steadily during the last
few weeks. The annex should be
finished around the first of May if
no more delays occur, according to
Mr. Leavers, superintendent of the
construction.
The only work remaining on the
job is plastering the walls and til
ing the floor. It is hoped that this
will be completed so that the annex
can be used during the University
Day alumni gathering on May 6.
The dining hall in use at present
has a maximum capacity of about
230. An additional 70 people can be
accommodated with the new annex.
It will be possible to close the annex
off from the main room, affording a
dining hall on campus where groups
of various sizes can hold private
dinners.
