## Industrialists Hear 18 Experts, Favor Collective Bargaining 
### 
"Business executives accept more
or less as an accomplished fact the
necessity and even desirability of
collective bargaining."
This was the summarizing state
ment voiced by Professor Paul Eliel,
director of the industrial relations
division of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, and sponsor of
a week-long conference of Pacific
Coast business executives held at

ica.

Among the speakers, who repre
sented diverse points of view, were
John A. Stephens, industrial rela
tions director of the U.S. Steel Cor
poration; Harry Bridges, west coast
director of the C.1.0.; Whiting Wil
liams. author and consultant on in
dustrial relations; and Paul Cad
man, director of the American Re
search Foundation.
' The labor view, as expressed by
Mr. Bridges, was that unions are
the bulwarks of democracy, and
consequently employers have a com
mon interest with employees as to
the preservation of civil liberties
and of democracy, even if they have
no other common interests," Eliel
declared. "Bridges emphasized that
there should be a cessation of guer
illa warfare and an acceptance of
unions as a device standing in the
way of fascism," he continued.
The conferees were more open
minded to recognition of collective
bargaining than they were at the
conference a year ago, Eliel indi
cated.
"Their attitude, as shown here
this week, is, 'We have it. How can
we make it an instrument of suc
cessful operation for business and
labor alike?'" Eliel said.
WAGNER ACT DISCUSSED
On the subject of amendments to
the Wagner Act, the Stanford pro
fessor said the business executives
attending seemed to agree that the
following are desirable:
1. Authorizing employers to peti
tion the National Labor Relations
Board to call an election of employ
ees to settle upon their collective
bargaining agency.
2. Enacting a requirement that
the N.L.R.B.'s findings shall be con
clusive only if sustained by "sub
stantial evidence."
3. Removing the Board's power to
issue subpoenas in its discretion and
instead giving the right of subpoena
equally to all parties.

' The labor view, as expressed by
Mr. Bridges, was that unions are
the bulwarks of democracy, and
consequently employers have a com
mon interest with employees as to
the preservation of civil liberties
and of democracy, even if they have
no other common interests," Eliel
declared. "Bridges emphasized that
there should be a cessation of guer
illa warfare and an acceptance of
unions as a device standing in the
way of fascism," he continued.
The conferees were more open
minded to recognition of collective
bargaining than they were at the
conference a year ago, Eliel indi
cated.
"Their attitude, as shown here
this week, is, 'We have it. How can
we make it an instrument of suc
cessful operation for business and
labor alike?'" Eliel said.
WAGNER ACT DISCUSSED
On the subject of amendments to
the Wagner Act, the Stanford pro
fessor said the business executives
attending seemed to agree that the
following are desirable:
1. Authorizing employers to peti
tion the National Labor Relations
Board to call an election of employ
ees to settle upon their collective
bargaining agency.
2. Enacting a requirement that
the N.L.R.B.'s findings shall be con
clusive only if sustained by "sub
stantial evidence."
3. Removing the Board's power to
issue subpoenas in its discretion and
instead giving the right of subpoena
equally to all parties.
"Business executives accept more
or less as an accomplished fact the
necessity and even desirability of
collective bargaining."
This was the summarizing state
ment voiced by Professor Paul Eliel,
director of the industrial relations
division of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, and sponsor of
a week-long conference of Pacific
Coast business executives held at
Stanford from March 27 to 31.
