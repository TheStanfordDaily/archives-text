# Johansen To Discuss Dramatics
## Theater Director To Tell of European Stage Since Munich 
### 
Waldemar A. Johansen, acting di
rector of dramatics, will relate first
hand observations on "The Euro
pean Theater since Munich" tonight
at 7:30 o'clock in Memorial Hall au
ditorium when he speaks on the
first program of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series for spring quarter.
Returning only last month from a
six months' tour of the major Eu
ropean countries, the speaker will
illustrate his lecture with slides
showing the interiors as well as
some of the productions of the thea
ters in England, Germany, and
Sweden.
ROCKEFELLER GRANT
Mr. Johansen, who received a
Rockefeller grant for the study of
the European theater, left Stanford
last August and visited England,
France, Germany, Italy, Sweden,
Denmark, Belgium, Holland, and
Switzerland, according to the Com
mittee on Public Exercises, in charge
of the lecture.
All over Germany, the theaters are
being built and rebuilt at great ex
pense, according to Mr. Johansen,
who explained that experence has
shown that propaganda plays have
little appeal to the people of the
country. The classics, particularly
Shakespeare, are therefore being
emphasized in the German theater,
which is supported by a state lot
tery.
Although Jews in Germany have
been practically removed from the
artistic life of the country, the
speaker discovered that the influ
ence of Max Reinhardt is still evi
dent in the country.
MOST MODERN THEATER
The most modern theater in Eu
rope is to be found in Gotesborg,
Sweden, according to Mr. Johansen,
who there witnessed a first-night
presentation of the American play,
"You Can't Take It with You."
An indication that the threat of
war in Europe is real and imminent
was given by the fact ,that the new
Trocadero people's theater in Paris
is designed to provide not only a
place of entertainment but also a
place of refuge in case of air raids.
The theater, built in the side of a hill
below the Place de la Trocadero,
seats 3,000 persons and is noted for
the perfection of its acoustics, ac
cording to the lecturer.
