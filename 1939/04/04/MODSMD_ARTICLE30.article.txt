# Home Drive Selections Hit Snag
## Excom Delays Final Action Until Next Week 
### 
Witli the Convalescent Home
Drive slated for May 1-6, Cardinals
has a hazardous snag to clear a
week from tonight, when Ex Com
mittee considers for a second time
the activity organization's choices
of drive committee heads.
The selections were up for Ex
Committee approval March 14, but
discussion was postponed until next
week's meeting when Betty Davis
told of numerous objections to the
appointments,
Out of the 22 students selected to
head drive committees, 17 arc from
the Row, 5 are from the Halls.
Objections have been raised in
past years on grounds that either
too many or too few were from the
Row or that either too many or
too few were members of Cardinals.
Last year the appointments were
okayed only after a two weeks' con
troversy in which Ex Committee
backed Cardinals to the wall and
had Ihe organization defending its
right to exist.
Other business handled at the
March 14 meeting follows:
MILITARY BALL: Presenting a
financial report of Scabbard and
Blade's Military Ball last quarter,
Student Manager Tom Killefer told
members that 174 bids were sold
and that "some guy in the army
gave $10." Total loss to Scabbard
and Blade was $565.28, he said.
"Any time they get any money
we'll just clamp on it," he told Ex
Committee, which underwrote the
venture.
BOATIIOUSE BUSINESS: At the
suggestion of Alfred Masters, gen
eral manager of the Board of Ath
letic Control, the committee decided
that the four students living at the
boathouse shall pay for their rooms
at the rate of $15 a quarter through
out the year.
In past years, they have lived
there all year, paying f"i their rooms
only when the lake is in use and
they are earning money as life
guards.
Mr. Masters was quoted as say
ing, "That's the only way to run a
business anyway. If these boys ob
ject, lots of others would jump at
the chance of living there at our
terms."
John Partridge objected to the
cost of the Boathouse, telling the
committee that many students had
complained that the job was not
done economically.
"Mr. Wagner says he's losing
money," President H. B. Lee replied.
And Killefer explained that it was
not possible to allow other com
panies to bid on the job.
PEACE DAY: Bob Livingston re
ported ofr the Peace Council that
Oswald Garrison Villard will ad
dress a 10 o'clock assembly on April
20. A luncheon and 10 afternoon
round-tables arc being planned for
