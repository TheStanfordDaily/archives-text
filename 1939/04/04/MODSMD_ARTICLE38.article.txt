# SIDELINE SLANTS

### 
A LOT of things went on during
the late-lamented spring vacation,
but none of them impressed us as
much as Stanford's 109-21 track vic
tory over U.C.L.A.
We have to admit, of course, that
the Bruins are definitely intramural
in their exploits on the cinders and
Woody Strode wasn't being used in
the weights, but it was the first out
door meet for the Indians and they
were playing away from home, with
the wind in their faces and the chill
of the musty Coliseum in their
bones.
Somehow the urge has come upon
us to pick Dink Templetons crew to
win not only the N.C A.A. crown but
also the A.A.U. championship ere
the summer is over. Stanford will
whip California in the best dual
meet of the year and will scare tar
nation out of U.S.C. before bowing
out.
A general idea of how the lads are
coming along might be well illus
trated by Clyde JefT'cy'.s two races
down south. Jeff may be and the
rumor is spreadingâ€”the best sprint
er in the world today, but Temple
ton and even Jeff himself know that
his "mediocre" trials, with 9.8 hun
dreds and 48.1 quarter-miies among
them, are slow motion shots of what
the big champion can do when he
attains the finesse he is slowly ae
quiring.
So Dink, to ease Jeffrey's tension
at the start, had him start on one
hand against the Bruins, with the
other mitt bent like a contortionist's
over his chest and arm. It was a
screwy, yet practical, plan to de
velop poise and freedom. They say
Jeff almost fell over convng off the
Mocks and must have been yards
behind at the half-way mark. But
he won in 9,9 anyway with some
thing like 21.6 in the 22t).
Then Sid Hayes ran a flight of high
hurdles in practice, all alone and
with no particular exertion, in 14. G.
Even this didn't make the Dink very
happy because as he said, "Sid was
only doing about 30 per cent of what
he is capable."
The general idea is that the whole
squad has developed a purpose or
something that is making them feel
like going after and winning cham
pionships. Pete Zagar won the dis
cus at U.C.L.A. with 162 feet and
some inches, then warmed up after
practice with a 171-foot toss. Four
squad members, who couldn't make
the traveling squad to Los Angeles I
hitch-hiked down. All four of j
them placed.
Anyway, you get the idea that j
this current track and field aggre
gation of ours is headed a long,
long way.

Oregon, as we so boldly predicted
just before their series with Califor
nia, is the first "official" National
Collegiate Athletic Association bas
ketball champion, having defeated
the Bears twice, won the Treasure
Island sectional championship, and
thumped Ohio State all in the space
of ten days.
None of the teams they faced had
a chance against the Ducks, who
finally came through after four years
of camping on the door-mat of great
ness. Every one of the team was |
named on at least one all-coast or
all-American team. Laddie Gale
and Slim Wintermute were prac
tically unanimous on most all-
American selections.
The Ducks were undoubtedly the
best in the nation this year, but
Stanford beat them on New Year's
Eve. That should make us better
than the best, which isn't bad.

VACATION VARIETIES: Bob F.
Pelouze, Stanford's basketball cap
tain in 1920 and a three-year ace in
basketball, football, and baseball, is
the Board of Athletic Control's new
est employee, having been hired to
maintain contacts between the board
and alumni. Everett Dean is a third
vice-president of the National Col
leigate Basketball Coaches Associa
tion. Stanford will take another
eastern basketball trip next Christ
mas vacation. Bobby Grayson re
signed his assistant coaching job to
go to work for an oil company. No
replacement has been named, nor is
there any immediate probability
that there will be.
But the athletes who spent the
most expensive vacations were the
sporty drivers who filled the cof
fers of little burgs like Morgan Hill
and Gilroy with sprinting fines. 'Tis
said their cars were doing much
more than 30 per cent of what they
were capable.
