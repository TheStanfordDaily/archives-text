# Mermen Prepare For U.C.L.A. Meet
## 
### 
Anticipating a hasty return to
peak condition after the general
finals slump, Stanford's varsity and
record-breaking frosh swimming
teams are preparing for their last
home meets this week-end.
In a double header to start Satur
day afternon at 3:30 o'clock, the
varsity will meet a U.C.L.A. team
which seems to be in the same
doldrums of athletic depression as
other Bruin teams; and the frosh
will come up against some of the
toughest competition of their season
when they meet Stockton Olympic
Club with its several far-western
champs.
