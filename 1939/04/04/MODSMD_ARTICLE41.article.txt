## 
### 
Intramural Manager Andy Stojko
vich will have his hands full this
coming spring quarter for six sports
will be run off for the benefit of
intramural athletes between now
and June. The spj ing schedule in
cludes track, tennfs, hardball, soft
ball, swimming, and track relays.
The trials for the big intramural
track meet which boasts an entry
list of 33 teams will be held next
Tuesday, April 11. Trials will be
run off in the 100, 220, and 440-yard
dashes; 120-yard high and 220-yurd
low hurdles; and the 880-yard relay.
The finals will follow on Thursday,
April 13.
The sign-up sheets for tennis,
hardball, and softball are now on
the intramural bulletin board and
the deadline for these three entry
lists is next Monday. Competition in
these activities will begin the fol
lowing Wednesday, April 12.
Stojkovich wishes to warn the or
ganizations planning to enter the
baseball tournaments that they may
use two teams in competition but
must designate before play begins
which one is trying for the points.
This holds for soft and hard ball sep
arately, for players may perform in
both leagues.
Intramural mermen will be given
a chance to show their stuff in a
large meet slated for some time in

May. While the last on the program,
the track relays, will come around
the first of June. These two will be
forced to wait until late in the quar
ter because the two baseball leagues
will run for about six weeks.
The points that were given for the
teams' achievements in basketball
and handball have been tallied on
the big scoring sheet on the intra
mural bulletin board. Due to these
latest point additions, Sigma Chi,
runner up in the casaba tournament,
has taken the intramural lead away
from Alpha Delt and are now lead
ing by a slight mai^gin.
