Stanford's tennis team couldn't
time its wins well enough to score a
single conference victory in its two
meets with U.C.L.A. and its one with
S.C. over the spring vacation.
The Bruins took only two singles
matches in the meet at Los Angeles
but came back with three doubles
wins for a 5-4 triumph. On the home
court here last Saturday, the Cards
won only two singles, but came back
for two of the doubles; and the
Bruins again were on the long end
of a 5-4 score.
Dave Brock, in the number three
position, was the only Indian to play
consistent tennis as he went unde
feated in singles competition.
In the number one spot, Bob Low
lost to Lubin of S.C. and split
matches with Kendis of the Bruins.
Other players in the order they
played were Captain Jim Seaver,
Myron Folsom, Neil Bui lard, and
Jack Laney. Sherwood Armstrong
and Stan Owen played the third
doubles.
