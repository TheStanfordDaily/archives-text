# Swing to Spring
## 
### 
REALIZED for some time has been the fact
that Stanford's spring quarter — 1933 is
crowded with important events.
Just what this means to Stanford, however,
has been hinted only, barely recognized.
On the calendar for April, the Annual Appeal
of the Stanford Fund, "Tovarich," Peace Day,
the Junior Prom, the Glee Club Concert head
a long list of Farm events. At the beginning of
May comes the Convalescent Home Drive, with
the Sophomore Carnival, the Strawberry
Brunch, the Junior Water Carnival, the Masque
Ball all included.
University Day, Student - Faculty Day, the
Spring Show lead up to Senior Week at gradu
ation time.
Just why spring quarter should be so crowd
ed with such a list of solid events remains some
thing of a mystery.
But the effect the quarter will have on Stan
ford is no mystery. Through the grace of a
date mix-up, the good Guiding Angel, and pure
blind luck, the Farm is a two-time winner.
The student body holds a ticket on a crowded,
yet inexpensive social calendar.
Stanford, as a whole, will be able to continue
the familiarity and friendliness of Boathouse
Day.
Academics, athletics, politics may all suffer.
It's time they did, for a change. Too little at
tention has been paid the Farm's informal social
life in recent years. Directors of these activities
may be griped, but they'll have a good time
getting that way.
What makes the picture even better is that
the last rain clouds disappeared Sunday over
the ridge of the Skyline. Which proves it's:
Spring at Stanford.
