AMONG the activities in the overstuffed
spring quarter pie, the Convalescent Home
is undoubtedly the prize plum. Year after year
the Farm has shown more interest in this, its
own unique extra-curricular creation, than in
any other event.
With an eye to the old battle-cry of taxation
without representation, Cardinals has made an
effort in the past to be sure that its appointments
to Drive committees are as representative as
possible.
This year it seems that Cardinals, itself a body
with a split Hall-Row membership, has forgotten
the value of personal contacts and word-of
mouth advertising in putting over the Drive.
Committee chairmanships submitted to Ex Com
mittee at its final meeting of winter quarter were
restricted to a few houses on the Row; of 22
appointments only five went to the Halls.
Unquestioned in the dignified hall of the
legislature was the fact that representa
tion of houses on Cardinals was often dupli
cated in the appointments of chairmen selected
from the campus at large. Perhaps the situa
tion is coincidental. In any case, the business
smacks of nepotism.
A week from tonight the chairman of Cardi
nals and the general chairman of the Convales
cent Home Drive will explain their selections to
Ex Committee.
Members of Cardinals are supposed to be
experts in the field of student activities. Per
haps they are. But it is fortunate that Ex Com
mittee's review will provide flood control for
the gravy.—L. L.
