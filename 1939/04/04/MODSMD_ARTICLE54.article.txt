# Woman's Place

WHEN they get into politics women can be
enthusiastic, persevering campaigners, but
they often wind up by making a mess of things.
That's practically axiomatic.
Look at the strange case of the Graduate
Women.
Last fall they became incensed about their
rights—the A.S.S.U. constitution provides for
two graduate members of Ex Committee but
does not specify whether they shall be men or
women. As a result, two men almost invari
ably have been elected to the seats.
So the Graduate Women showed up at an
Ex Committee meeting, asking please could
there be an amendment on the fall ballot to
the effect that one of the two seats should be
held by a woman.

"Let's not rush into this thing," admonished
the committee. "We'll see if they are strong
enough to elect a woman to one of these gradu
ate positions without benefit of an amendment."
It was a vigorous campaign those women waged
to get Roberta Tuthill elected.
Some say the Tuthill victory proVes the
women don't need an amendment. They can
get a graduate woman on Ex Committee any
how.
The Graduate Women say the Tuthill victory
proves there might as well be an amendment
if they can win an election without one.
The funny part of it is that no one knows for
sure just what it was decided a Tuthill victory
would prove. But everyone is positive it proves
something or other.
It's a political mess, all right. Women will
do it every time.—R. D.
