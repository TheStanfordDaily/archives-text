### JOHN COBBS 
NO TRESPASSING
/ ORDINARILY it is not iny custom to nurse grudges;
there are so many of them lying around loose
that only the sentimental value can compensate for the
bother of keeping an old one alive. But during this
ast finals week the University and I got into a nasty
little scrap, and the feuding spirit still flourishes, even
lfter the soothing influence of vacation. I was deter
mined to hole up somewhere on the Quad and study
like a medieval monk cramming for the glory of God.
The University was determined that the Quad was
not to be cluttered up with students after dark. The
clash of wills was almost epic.
The skirmishing began on Monday night when I
started out to find a place to study. Each room was
bolted as carefully as a bank vault. Crown jewels
could not have been locked away more solicitously.
Worse than that, the little department libraries had
instructions to close promptly at 10 o'clock; usually the
librarians let students stay as late as they like if they
have honest faces and look intelligent enough to turn
out the lights when they leave.
* * * *
A ND so I find myself forced to choose between study
ing under a street light and going home. On this
point I want no misunderstanding. I like my room. It
is comfortable and cheery, and my roommate has put
up some French pictures that are excellent entertain
ment. But when 40 healthy men with strong lungs and
friendly dispositions are living in one house, a deaf
mute could not do any studying there. It is not sur
prising, then, that I felt a little annoyed with the Uni
versity.
I have talked with assorted officials about the study
ing problem, and they have assured me that it does
not exist. The University, they say, is under no obliga
tion to provide the students with places to study. We
have homes; we can work there. There is also a lot of
loose talk about light bills and fire hazards, and the
discussion winds up with the conclusion that all the
students have to do is learn to be a little more quiet.
* * * *
All this is very logical and probably perfectly true.
But it doesn't solve the problem of study conditions.
The University is here to help us learn something, and I
provide us with palces to work, but presumably the
University is here to help us learn something, and 1
don't see that furnishing rooms for studying would be
in violation of the founding grant. More than that,
$115 a quarter will pay for a fair amount of electricity.
Perhaps we would all be better and finer men if
we started a campaign to maintain quiet in the living
groups. But I am not the martyr type. I want to study
now, not six months from now when I have convinced
my neighbors of the validity of the golden rule.
As far as I know, history records only one place
where 40 odd men could live together quietly. That
was in ancient Turkey where they used to cut the
tongues out of slaves. The idea is pleasant, but I
don't think even the officials would sponsor it openly.

Perhaps we would all be better and finer men if
we started a campaign to maintain quiet in the living
groups. But I am not the martyr type. I want to study
now, not six months from now when I have convinced
my neighbors of the validity of the golden rule.
As far as I know, history records only one place
where 40 odd men could live together quietly. That
was in ancient Turkey where they used to cut the
tongues out of slaves. The idea is pleasant, but I
don't think even the officials would sponsor it openly.
NO TRESPASSING
/ ORDINARILY it is not iny custom to nurse grudges;
there are so many of them lying around loose
that only the sentimental value can compensate for the
bother of keeping an old one alive. But during this
ast finals week the University and I got into a nasty
little scrap, and the feuding spirit still flourishes, even
lfter the soothing influence of vacation. I was deter
mined to hole up somewhere on the Quad and study
like a medieval monk cramming for the glory of God.
The University was determined that the Quad was
not to be cluttered up with students after dark. The
clash of wills was almost epic.
The skirmishing began on Monday night when I
started out to find a place to study. Each room was
bolted as carefully as a bank vault. Crown jewels
could not have been locked away more solicitously.
Worse than that, the little department libraries had
instructions to close promptly at 10 o'clock; usually the
librarians let students stay as late as they like if they
have honest faces and look intelligent enough to turn
out the lights when they leave.

A ND so I find myself forced to choose between study
ing under a street light and going home. On this
point I want no misunderstanding. I like my room. It
is comfortable and cheery, and my roommate has put
up some French pictures that are excellent entertain
ment. But when 40 healthy men with strong lungs and
friendly dispositions are living in one house, a deaf
mute could not do any studying there. It is not sur
prising, then, that I felt a little annoyed with the Uni
versity.
I have talked with assorted officials about the study
ing problem, and they have assured me that it does
not exist. The University, they say, is under no obliga
tion to provide the students with places to study. We
have homes; we can work there. There is also a lot of
loose talk about light bills and fire hazards, and the
discussion winds up with the conclusion that all the
students have to do is learn to be a little more quiet.
* * * *
All this is very logical and probably perfectly true.
But it doesn't solve the problem of study conditions.
The University is here to help us learn something, and I
provide us with palces to work, but presumably the
University is here to help us learn something, and 1
don't see that furnishing rooms for studying would be
in violation of the founding grant. More than that,
$115 a quarter will pay for a fair amount of electricity.
