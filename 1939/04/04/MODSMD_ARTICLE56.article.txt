Vacation. You find out how the other half lives.
The half down in Southern California lives, I find,
under dark clouds and a continuous threat of rain.
But I don't think that has anything to do wilh the
people down there. I think they would be the same
without the clouds and all that. I think the various
Chambers of Commerce have talked them one and all
into varying degrees of sun stroke.
Take the people at one of the junior colleges.
A young lady and a young gentleman there were
normally fond of each other. They would walk around
the campus together; hand in hand occasionally. Some
times they would find a green spot of grass and sit for
a couple of minutes.
They strolled and sat for a month or so. Contin
ually, not continuously. Then the girl got a notice
from the dean of women.
She went into the dean, stepped cautiously onto the
carpet, and waited.
The dean said, "I want all this nonsense to stop,
rhis walking hand in hand. This sitting on the grass,
[t is unbecoming. It must stop."
The young lady and the young gentleman ignored
he threat. They strolled and sat as usual. They even
ound that it was rather pleasant, of an afternoon, to
sit in the lee of the administration building. Occa
sionally they would take to the horizontal, stretch out
on the grass, talk of this and that, and perhaps chew a
small weed.
One day the young gentleman was on the grass, the
young lady was feeling frisky. On a sudden impulse
she gently stepped onto the young gentleman's stomach
and stood there for a few seconds.
The dean heard of this. She called the young lady.
She was absolutely purple in the face. "Young
lady," she exploded, "have you been standing perpen
dicularly on a man's stomach?"

One evening a woman was out with her dog and
.he dog ran away. The dog was running up the street
clippity-clippity-clippity, and the woman was not far
behind, clumpity-clumpity-clumpity. First the dog and
then the woman.
As they raced by an apartment house, a strange
lady stuck her head out the window and said, "My
God, I don't know which looks funnier, you or the
dog," and retreated.

She was absolutely purple in the face. "Young
lady," she exploded, "have you been standing perpen
dicularly on a man's stomach?"

One evening a woman was out with her dog and
.he dog ran away. The dog was running up the street
clippity-clippity-clippity, and the woman was not far
behind, clumpity-clumpity-clumpity. First the dog and
then the woman.
As they raced by an apartment house, a strange
lady stuck her head out the window and said, "My
God, I don't know which looks funnier, you or the
dog," and retreated.

Scripps College recently had to ask two girls not to
come back any more, and had to get rid of the local
Good Humor man.
He was peddling scotch and beer in his little white
wagon.

Vacation. You find out how the other half lives.
The half down in Southern California lives, I find,
under dark clouds and a continuous threat of rain.
But I don't think that has anything to do wilh the
people down there. I think they would be the same
without the clouds and all that. I think the various
Chambers of Commerce have talked them one and all
into varying degrees of sun stroke.
Take the people at one of the junior colleges.
A young lady and a young gentleman there were
normally fond of each other. They would walk around
the campus together; hand in hand occasionally. Some
times they would find a green spot of grass and sit for
a couple of minutes.
They strolled and sat for a month or so. Contin
ually, not continuously. Then the girl got a notice
from the dean of women.
She went into the dean, stepped cautiously onto the
carpet, and waited.
The dean said, "I want all this nonsense to stop,
rhis walking hand in hand. This sitting on the grass,
[t is unbecoming. It must stop."
The young lady and the young gentleman ignored
he threat. They strolled and sat as usual. They even
ound that it was rather pleasant, of an afternoon, to
sit in the lee of the administration building. Occa
sionally they would take to the horizontal, stretch out
on the grass, talk of this and that, and perhaps chew a
small weed.
One day the young gentleman was on the grass, the
young lady was feeling frisky. On a sudden impulse
she gently stepped onto the young gentleman's stomach
and stood there for a few seconds.
The dean heard of this. She called the young lady.
She was absolutely purple in the face. "Young
