# W.C. Fields Turns Molehill Into Mountain
## 
### 
"YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HON
EST MAN," playing today at the
Fox-Stanford.
If you don't enjoy W. C. Fields,
you'd better stay away from this
picture because he's the whole
show. If, like nic, you've admired
Fields for years this should be an
evening of rare entertainment.

Though I'd have
a hard time prov
ing it, I think
most of "An Hon
est Man" was ad
libbed. The hu
» mor is spontane
ous, not formal or
studied. It flows
along with the glib
assurance that
Fields knows so

well. The Hollywod gag-men didn't
have a chance to stereotype lines.
If you're looking for an intricate
plot you'll be disappointed, too, be
cause "An Honest Man" has no plot.
Phineas T. Whipsnade runs a circus
that is going broke. To save papa
from the collectors, daughter, a col
lege girl, decides to marry Roger
Bel-Goodie, a rich stufTed shirt
from way back. What results is
pure comedy with Fields running
wild and Bergen, McCarthy, and
Mortimer Snerd stooging satisfac
torily. If you're a Bergen fan, you'll
go for this, too. With this flimsy
framework, "An Honest Man" is a
swell show.
Though much of the action is ob
vious slapstick, some of the lines are
so subtle that most audiences miss
them completely. Timing, at which
Fields cxcels, is perfect.
Playing with "You Can't Cheat"
are "Ride a Crooked Mile" and
the latest March of Time.
