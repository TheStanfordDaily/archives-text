United States extend a warm wel

your permanent identification as a
member of the Stanford family.
"In our offices on the second floor
of the Administration Building, we
keep complete records of all of
Stanford's graduates and former
students, which are invaluable to
the newly graduated student who
may be changing his employment
frequently.
"Membership in the association of
course automatically brings you the
Illustrated Review, which for a
number of years has won honors as
one of the leading alumni magazines
in America.
"If you are in California next year,
I sincerely urge you to attend one
of the series of Alumni Conferences
which will be held in Seattle, Port
land, Stanford, and Los Angeles.
The series which just closed at
tracted a total registration of more
than 3,000 graduates, an ;'.ll-time
record.

advantages of membership in the
association. I have been authorized
by the Alumni Council to announce
to members of the senior class that
special first-year membership dues
of $2 will be offered them. In addi
tion, we are planning a special Com
mencement pictorial section in the
Illustrated Review for June. This
will contain photographs of all Sen
ior Week activities."
