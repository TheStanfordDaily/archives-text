NEW YORK. April 3 (UP).â€”The
New York World's Fair, scheduled
to open April 30, was denounced to
day by Councilman James A. Burke,
Democrat, as "the greatest con game
in history."
"The 7,500.000 naive city resi
dents," he said, "arc being taxed into
bankruptcy to support a glorified
county fair. Never give a sucker an

'The World of Tomorrow'."
Burke was speaking in support of
his proposal to apply a five-cent tax
to each World's Fair ticket.
