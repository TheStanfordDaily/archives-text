### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
r INHERE are two very dangerous
gentlemen living in Europe.
They are joined in fast friendship
by an arrangement called the Rome-
Berlin axis, which seems to work as
a mutual admiration society as well
as a protective association.
During the past few years the
German end of the combination has
been busy with the game of land
grabbing, and thus far has played it
with considerable success. Now the
partner down south in Italy has de
cided that he wants to get in on the
fun, and today he has his troops
ready to strike at tiny Albania, a na
tion which he knows has no chance
of defending itself.

When the Reich started making
ugly threats at the British stop-
Iliticr campaign, Mussolini
decided it was high time to put a
chip on his shoulder too. He was
certain that Italy and Germany
were pals, and made up his mind
that if Prime Minister Chamber
lain is trying to surround Ger
many with a fence of bayonets, he
certainly must have similar inten
tions toward the Fascist state.
In this situation II Duce saw his
opportunity to ape Adolf Hitler and
to realize a few pet projects of his
own. Should he seize the French
colonies in North Africa he has had
his eye on all this year? No, that
would be too dangerous a step, with
England and France aroused to a
lighting mood.

CO Premier Mussolini has decided
* to attack King Zog's little land
across the Adriatic just to show the
stop-Hitler set that he means busi
ness. Last night 20,000 Italian troops
were massed at Bari and Brindisi,
on the heel of the boot, ready to
make the 45-mile trip across the
Straits of Otranto.
* al*. *
In the approved Nazi manner, II
Duce labels his project a move
for protective occupation. Al
bania is Italy's hack-door to the
bothersome Balkan states.
True it is that Mussolini has
dominated the tiny mountain king
dom for many years, but today all
official Albanian sources deny that
they have requested Italian protec
tion from the proposed iron ring
around the Reich.

VL/ORD of the latest move by the
totalitarian axis reached Lon
don as the government of Neville
Chamberlain was arranging a mu
tual assistance pact with Poland in
case either nation is attacked and
the British Admiralty was nervously
ordering all its anti-aircraft guns
manned.
The Foreign Office announced
that any move II Duce may make
against Albania will be regarded as
a breach of the Anglo-Italian pact
made last year. What England
really fears far more than Mus
solini's little follow-thc-leader act
is that it may lead to more dan
gerous reprisals in Lybia, where
Italy is busy landing rc-enforcc
inents, and in the French colonics
«»n the southern shore of the
Mediterranean.
* * *
Albania is a small, weak king
dom, ruled by a hillbilly monarch
called Zog. Its sole importance lies
in its position between Italy and
Jugoslavia, the land that Mussolini
fears England will try to talk into
joining the anti-Hitler league.
Unimportant as the territory may
be, especially in comparison with
considerations like Czechoslovakia,
all indications arc that Mr. Cham
berlain will stand firm in his new
resolve to oppose both Nazi and
Fascist territorial aggression. Be
fore II Duce goes too far in his imi
tation of Herr Hitler, he will do
well to realize that the British at
titude toward such performances
has become a great deal more posi
tive in the last few days.
* * *
Today Poland is joining hands
with England as Germany's expan
sion program threatens her terri
tory, but last September, during the
Munich crisis, the Poles were on
the other side of the fence. There
has been no l6ve lost between Rus
sia and Poland for these many years,
and Soviet suspicion provides the
biggest threat to Britain's proposed
alliance against the Reich.
