# 'Tovarich' Ticket Prices To Range from 50 Cents
## 
### 
Top ticket price of $1.50 has been
announced for the alumni play "To
varich," which will be presented
Saturday night at 8:15 o'clock in
Memorial Hall. Other tickets are
being sold at 50 cents, 75 cents,
and $1.00.
The proceeds of the play will be
used for tuition-paid drama schol
arships. Last year's alumni play,
"Star Wagon," netted enough to pay
one year's full tuition for one speech
and drama student.
Starring in "Tovarich" are Melba
Rae Toombs, who plays the Grand
Tatiana, and James Clancy, who
plays Prince Ouratieff. Clancy ac
quired professional experience at
the Cohasset Play House on Cape
Cod before coming to Stanford to
take his master's degree. Miss
Toombs is well known for her roles
in other campus productions.
Wherever it has been produced—
Paris, London, New York, Holly
wood—"Tovarich" has been an over

whelming success. Jaques Deval,
who also wrote "Amphytrion 38" in
which Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fon
tanne starred, in Tovarich took an
unusual plot, which might easily
have bogged down into melodrama,
and fashioned it into a witty and
sensitive comedy.
Especially clever is his delineation
of the character of the two Rus
sian aristocrats, whose bewildering
combination of sentimentality, child
ishness, and imperious royalty is
subtly revealed.
Four different sets are used in the
play. First is a cheap room in one
of the poorer sections of Paris. Next
is the dressing room of Madame
Dupont, then the sitting room and
dining room of the same apartment.
Finally there is the kitchen, which
appears in the final scene. These
have been designed by William Bas
sett, technical director of the Divi
sion of Speech and Drama, and con
structed under his supervision and
that of Waldemar Johansen.
