announced yesterday that he
would conduct interviews with

of two men and two women will be
accompanied by its debate coach,
Laveme Bane, a Stanford graduate.
Prime forensic development which
arose during the spring respite was
the cancellation of the Hawaiian
tour. This drastic decision came
about gradually, was instigated by
the San Francisco waterfront strike
which held up the vessel on which
Armcn Hampar and Tim Hays,
Stanford debate tourists, were to sail
March 24. Officials of the steam
ship line could not be definite con
cerning the sailing date, with the
result that Hays and Hampar final
ly decided not to while away their
spring vacation awaiting what
might turn out to be a mythical
sailing.
The ship, however, did sail the
following Tuesday but the Card de
baters were not aboard. According
to Bob Putnam, debate manager,
their only opportunity to make the
trip now will come up sometime
during May, at which time both
Hays and Hffmpar feel they wall be
too deeply enmeshed in studies to
take time off for three weeks in
the middle of a nine-week quarter.
Putnam concluded that these devel
opments seemed to point to the defi
nite cancellation of the trip.
Professor Leland Chapin, debate
coach, attended the Pacific Forensic
League meeting held last week at
Pomona and reported having spent
a profitable sojourn at the gathering.
