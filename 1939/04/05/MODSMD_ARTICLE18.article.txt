## Johansen Discusses Foreign Stage 
### 
First-hand accounts of theaters
and theatrical performances on the
European continent were given last
night by Waldemar A. Johansen,
acting director of dramatics, who
spoke on "The European Theater
since Munich" at the first program
of the Tuesday Evening Series for
spring quarter in Memorial Hall au
ditorium.
"All over Germany today, new
theaters are being built and exist
ing theaters are being renovated and
re-equipped," declared the speaker,
who explained that the classics,
particularly Shakespeare, have taken
the place of propaganda plays, which
have been shown to have little ap
peal for the people of the country.
Illustrating his lecture with slides
which he took during his six months'
tour of the major countries of Eu
rope, Mr. Joliansen showed the ex
teriors of continental showhouses,
as well as views of some of the per
formances presented.
Establishment of a "People's The
ater" in England, supported by
popular subscription instead of
through sale of tickets, was dis
cussed by the lecturer, who visited
London last September during the
conference at Munich, when the city
"resembled a surrealist painting,
with millions of jumbled ideas try
ing to get together, but spoiling
nothing but fear."
