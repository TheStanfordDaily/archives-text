## 
### 
EUREKA, April 4 (UP).â€”Trinity
County declared economic war on
its neighbor, Humboldt County, to
day as a result of the long contro
versy between fishermen and min
ers over the uses of the Klamath,
Trinity, and Salmon rivers in
Northern California.
The battle lines of the intercounty
civil war were drawn at meetings of
Trinity County businessmen, min
ers and officials at the county seat at
Weaverville, in a mountainous area
of Humboldt County.
With 120 Trinity residents partici
pating, a plan was formed to boy
cott Humboldt County products and
all goods moving into the county
through the port of Eureka, on Hum
boldt Bay.
The county was to be divided into
districts for the purpose of checking
out all Humboldt merchandise, in
cluding lumber, beer, liquors, on
the shelves or in the warehouses of
Trinity merchants.
