### KAY JOHNSEN 
Stanford plays tutor to one of the ten outstanding young Americans, ac
cording to the magazine, "Youth Today." lie is Edgar Fricdcnberg, 17- |
year-old graduate student doing research work under Professor Francis !
Bergstrom.
Friedfenberg came to Stanford two quarters ago from Centenary College
in Shreveport, La., to receive the lowest grade in his academic career: a

► B plus. Until then he had had a
straight A record.
His field is organic chemistry, and
in two years he hopes to take his
doctor's degree here on the Farm.
Friedenberg will be 19 then—young
er than most seniors in search of a
! diploma.
! EARLY START
Although his parents made no
! conscious effort to stimulate his in
i terests, they were responsible for
I giving him the chemistry set that
made it possible to have explosions
I in his own home and awakened his
I interest in chemistry. This happen
ed when he was seven. Six years
later he entered Centenary College
as a freshman, at 13 years of age.
He had never intended to skip the
entire public school system. But
certain psychologists became inter
ested when they found how much
more he knew in certain fields. They
set about equalizing his knowledge
so he could enter one of the lower
grades. But before the equalizing
process had much effect he was
ready for college.
At Centenary he was politically
active, the president of a number of
organizations, and an associate edi
tor of the college paper. Perhaps it
was the experience gained here that
made people his first interest, and
I gave him the incentive to go into
| teaching rather than laboratory re
search,
VARIED HOBBIES
His interests are many and var
ied. At the moment his big whim is
the railroad hobby. He acquires
time-tables from points scattered
throughout the United States, study
ing them so he knows when each
train passes through each key city.
As for the movies, he is always will
ing to take a chance on Luise Rain
er putting on a good performance.
He likes sports a great deal too—
but mainly those that involve loco
motion, that get one somewhere and
that someone can get somewhere
with. He dislikes those that involve
abundant equipment; they seem to
get him into abundant difficulties.
Take tennis for a simple example.
To Friedenberg it has always seem
ed scientifically advisable to remove
the net.
