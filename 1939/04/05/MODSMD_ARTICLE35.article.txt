## 'No Radical Change,' Says Moskovics 
### 
Scheduled to meet late this week,
the Standing Committee of the Po
litical Union will outline the program
for the Union's activities during
spring quarter. John Moscovics, re
cently elected to head the organiza
tion through its first years of cam
pus activity, indicated that the next
general meeting of the house would
probably be held within the next
two or three weeks.
As to the policy that would be
adopted by the officers, installed at
the end of last quarter, he stated
(hat there would be no radical
change from the stand adhered to by
the previous governing board.
Bob Wood, vice-president and
chairman of the Election Committee,
has made no definite plans for the
consideration of new plans for the
Union, but said that undergraduates
desiring admission would probably
be interviewed before the first meet
ing of the quarter.
Although the new Constitution,
drawn up in February, was accepted
without change by members of the
house, statements have been made
that there will be a demand to re
vise the provisions regarding the new
set-up of the three parties.

Georgia grows about twice as
many acres of velvet beans as any
other state.
