# Frosh Mermen Rate with Best
## Farm Team to Meet Stockton Winged-O's 
### 
Classed with the Yale frosh as
one of the two most outstanding
frosh swimming teams in the coun
try, Stanford's frosh natators have
built up an enviable record during
their season, which up to the pres
ent time may conservatively be
called spectacular.
Some of their phenomenal feats
have included bettering eleven U. S.
collegiate fi'eshman records, ten
Stanford University records, all six
teen Stanford freshman records, six
Pacific Coast Conference varsity
records, and several Pacific Associa
tion A.A.U. records.
Led by the sensational perform
ances of Captain Paul Herron, the
â– 12 mermen have swum an inspired
season and deserve the undisputed
title of the best swim team ever to
hit. the Farm.
The last chance for Farm students
to see this great aggregation in ac
tion in the home pools will be in
their meet with Stockton Olympic
Club ibis Saturday afternoon at 3:30
o'clock when they will share the
spotlight with ihe Card varsity, who
will meet U.C.L.A. at the same time.
The Stockton Winged-0 men are
the one bunch capable of ending the
frosh's undefeated streak. By pres
ent calculations, if the frosh win the
meet it will be by a verdict of only
a few points, vvilh the final event,
the free style relay, probably de
ciding the winner.
The valley team is bolstered by
such stars as John Hood in the div
ing and sprints, Ralph Wright,
breast stroker, and Freddy Van
Dyke, backstroker. Opposing them
for the frosh will be Howie Adams,
diver, Gardner Miller, sprints, and
Scott Dudley, breast stroke.
The meet is open to all students
on presentation of a student body
card, but admission will be charged
thp general public.

age in Texas in the last 50 years
was more than $2,200,000.
