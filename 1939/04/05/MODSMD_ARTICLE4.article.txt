# Board Hears Presidential Message
## Social Education Stressed in Annual Report for 1937-38 
### 
Presentation of all sides of social
and political questions in university
class rooms and discussion groups
is a necessary ingredient for the fu
ture outlook of education, Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur reported to the Stan
ford Board of Trustees in his annual
report for 1937-38, released last
week.
"One of the best ways to keep
gas pressure from accumulating in
a barrel," he said, "is to pull out
the bung."
Schools and universities, he de
clared, are inclined to look back
ward, to fear social changes, and to
give an education that is behind the
times in so far as what the student
has to face is concerned.
OBSTACLE SHOWN
''A very considerable obstacle
comes about from the fact that if a
teacher presents anything in the
way that seems to demand a change
in existing conditions there is likely
to be a charge that indoctrination is
being attempted," he said.
"Certainly, with our average
child exposed through the radio,
press, and his companions to all
sorts of information about all sorts
of movements, governmental and
otherwise, there is good reason to
keep our minds open and to en
deavor to present to our students,
particularly in the university, a
balanced, sane, and comprehensive
study of social and governmental
principles and change."
There is sufficient conservatism in
the minds of most young Americans
so that they are not. gi'eatly disturbed
by the study of what is going on
in other governments in other parts
of the world, he estimated.
'NOISY MINORITY'
President Wilbur suggested that
not much attention should be paid
the "noisy minority" that goes
through "emotional, if not fanatical,
experiences" in connection with ab
sorbing ideas that come in the field
of religion, social change, or govern
ment.
He also pointed to the tendency of
the modern university to grow at
the top by devoting more of its re
sources and energies to advanced
studies.
"Twenty or even ten years ago,"
he said, "the degree of bachelor of
arts was considered all sufficient by
most of those who came to the Uni
versity. Now the industries and
other private organizations are de
manding more training than that
leading up to the bachelor of arts
degree.
"One of the great industrial or
ganizations reported last year that
69 per cent of the college men taken
into the organization held advanced
degrees.
"It is becoming increasingly evi
dent that the emphasis at Stanford
must be upon advanced work if we
are to serve our real purpose in the
training of students who may take
places of leadership in every phase
of the life about us."
In connection with this trend, he
pointed out that education of the
individual is necessarily being pro
longed, but that extra time spent on
education is not wasted, since indi
viduals face a longer life of useful
ness with improved conditions of
private and public health.

ness with improved conditions of
private and public health.
Presentation of all sides of social
and political questions in university
class rooms and discussion groups
is a necessary ingredient for the fu
ture outlook of education, Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur reported to the Stan
ford Board of Trustees in his annual
report for 1937-38, released last
week.
"One of the best ways to keep
gas pressure from accumulating in
a barrel," he said, "is to pull out
the bung."
Schools and universities, he de
clared, are inclined to look back
ward, to fear social changes, and to
give an education that is behind the
times in so far as what the student
has to face is concerned.
OBSTACLE SHOWN
''A very considerable obstacle
comes about from the fact that if a
teacher presents anything in the
way that seems to demand a change
in existing conditions there is likely
to be a charge that indoctrination is
being attempted," he said.
"Certainly, with our average
child exposed through the radio,
press, and his companions to all
sorts of information about all sorts
of movements, governmental and
otherwise, there is good reason to
keep our minds open and to en
deavor to present to our students,
particularly in the university, a
balanced, sane, and comprehensive
study of social and governmental
principles and change."
There is sufficient conservatism in
the minds of most young Americans
so that they are not. gi'eatly disturbed
by the study of what is going on
in other governments in other parts
of the world, he estimated.
'NOISY MINORITY'
President Wilbur suggested that
not much attention should be paid
the "noisy minority" that goes
through "emotional, if not fanatical,
experiences" in connection with ab
sorbing ideas that come in the field
of religion, social change, or govern
ment.
He also pointed to the tendency of
the modern university to grow at
the top by devoting more of its re
sources and energies to advanced
studies.
"Twenty or even ten years ago,"
he said, "the degree of bachelor of
arts was considered all sufficient by
most of those who came to the Uni
versity. Now the industries and
other private organizations are de
manding more training than that
leading up to the bachelor of arts
degree.
"One of the great industrial or
ganizations reported last year that
69 per cent of the college men taken
into the organization held advanced
degrees.
"It is becoming increasingly evi
dent that the emphasis at Stanford
must be upon advanced work if we
are to serve our real purpose in the
training of students who may take
places of leadership in every phase
of the life about us."
In connection with this trend, he
pointed out that education of the
individual is necessarily being pro
longed, but that extra time spent on
education is not wasted, since indi
viduals face a longer life of useful
ness with improved conditions of
private and public health.
