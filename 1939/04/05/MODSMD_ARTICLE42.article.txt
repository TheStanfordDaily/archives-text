# Card Nine Grabs 18-3 Win
## Broncs Bow Third Time To Indians Farm Sluggers Blast Santa Clara Pitchers In Lopsided Conflict 
### 
The Stanford varsity baseballers
set their season's high scoring mark
when they annihilated Santa Clara
yesterday afternoon on the Bronco
diamond, 18-3. Powerful slugging
combined with an almost unheard
of number of errors by their op
ponents gave the Cards their third
league win over the Broncs, who
are in last place in the C.1.8.F.
standings.
The Cards pounced on the offer
ings of Leibeck, starting Santa Clara
pitcher, in the first inning for five
runs and four hits. Bill "Smoke"
Clark clouted a home run, scoring
Pfyl, Boone, and Ditlevsen ahead of
him, to start the Indians off with
four runs. Clark, Monty Pfyl, and
Wally deWitt, who played his first
full game in field, led the
Stanford hitters. Pfyl made three
hits in seven trips to the plate, de-
Witt got three for four, and Clark
batted a double in addition to his
first-inning circuit blow.
FIELDING SLOPPY
The Santa Clara team set some
sort of a record for sloppy fielding,
the line-up being charged with a
grand total of 11 errors. Case, third
baseman, was the principal offender
with four misplays. The rest of the
Bronco team was almost as erratic.
Second base was another spot where
the Cards got more than their share
of breaks. Puncocher, who started
at that position for the losers, made
two errors and his replacement
made one.
A1 Lazzarone, Purkitt, and Gil
Rahn shared the pitching duties for
the winners. Santa Clara scored all
three runs while Rahn, who turned
out for baseball at the end of bas
ketball season, was on the mound.
Four walks and a hit in the last inn
ing scored the runs.
INFIELD STRONG
The Stanford infield, with Norm
Juney playing first base, played
good defensive ball. The only one of
the three Card errors that was
made in the infield was charged
against Herb Bull.
The short box score:
R. 11. E.
Stanford .....* 18 12 3
Santa Clara 3 6 11
Batteries: Stanford — Lazzarone,
Purkitt, Rahn, and Jameson, Tem

first-inning circuit blow.
FIELDING SLOPPY
The Santa Clara team set some
sort of a record for sloppy fielding,
the line-up being charged with a
grand total of 11 errors. Case, third
baseman, was the principal offender
with four misplays. The rest of the
Bronco team was almost as erratic.
Second base was another spot where
the Cards got more than their share
of breaks. Puncocher, who started
at that position for the losers, made
two errors and his replacement
made one.
A1 Lazzarone, Purkitt, and Gil
Rahn shared the pitching duties for
the winners. Santa Clara scored all
three runs while Rahn, who turned
out for baseball at the end of bas
ketball season, was on the mound.
Four walks and a hit in the last inn
ing scored the runs.
INFIELD STRONG
The Stanford infield, with Norm
Juney playing first base, played
good defensive ball. The only one of
the three Card errors that was
made in the infield was charged
against Herb Bull.
The short box score:
R. 11. E.
Stanford .....* 18 12 3
Santa Clara 3 6 11
Batteries: Stanford — Lazzarone,
Purkitt, Rahn, and Jameson, Tem
pleton. Santa Clara — Leibeck, Mc-
Fadden. dcPoeli. Esnick. and Hanna.
The Stanford varsity baseballers
set their season's high scoring mark
when they annihilated Santa Clara
yesterday afternoon on the Bronco
diamond, 18-3. Powerful slugging
combined with an almost unheard
of number of errors by their op
ponents gave the Cards their third
league win over the Broncs, who
are in last place in the C.1.8.F.
standings.
The Cards pounced on the offer
ings of Leibeck, starting Santa Clara
pitcher, in the first inning for five
runs and four hits. Bill "Smoke"
Clark clouted a home run, scoring
Pfyl, Boone, and Ditlevsen ahead of
him, to start the Indians off with
four runs. Clark, Monty Pfyl, and
Wally deWitt, who played his first
full game in field, led the
Stanford hitters. Pfyl made three
hits in seven trips to the plate, de-
Witt got three for four, and Clark
batted a double in addition to his
first-inning circuit blow.
