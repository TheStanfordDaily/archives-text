FOR YKARS now, college base
ball coaches have been bemoaning
the fact that professional clubs have
consistently enticed their players j
away from books and all the other
advantages of higher education, in
cluding playing baseball, with lures
of the big time circuits.
Seldom do these college young
j sters make a go of it. A few, like
; old Lou Gehrig, for instance, turn
; into stars and bring down sizeable
; bank-rolls. The great majority,
i however, wind up in Class C and D
leagues, where a wage over $110 a
i month makes a guy a virtual pluto
! crat.
It isn't that baseball isn't just
j about the finest game of them all
| or that it is in any way degrading
I to the players in it; it's just the fact
: that baseball gets deep down in your
blood, and when that happens, you
j eat, sleep, and play nothing but
| baseball. No other sport keeps its
j hold on the participants like that.
* # >.*
FOR EXAMPLE, how many eol
-1 lege football players would you say
played for sheer love of the game?
Maybe 20 per cent.
But baseball is different. If you
don't live it, you don't play it. That's
why so many of the all-time greats
of the diamond were sand-lot roust
abouts and nothing more before they
got their big opportunity.
A normal college man might be
i pretty well interested in baseball,
j yet he usually has no attachment
j such as is exhibited by the neighbor- j
! hood gang. The college man would
j get as much kick out of a date with
j the blonde across the aisle as he
I would playing a baseball game,
i There are the exceptional college
| men who are quite good players, but
j these will never supersede the
[ sand-lot kid as the ball player of
I tomorrow.
>ii * ♦
THE SMARTEST thing for any
j college man to do would be to fin
j ish whatever course he wants to
take and then to turn to baseball if
baseball still wants him. If baseball
has changed its mind since his ear
lier years, it's just as well he's got a 1
I degree before he signed any binding
agreements. A baseball contract is
the worst one-way deal imaginable.
Then again, maybe the young col
j lege player will get better by the
I end of his senior year and command
j a better price than he would before.
! A great player with a college educa
| tion, who is capable of getting a po-
I sition outside of baseball, can easily
I demand and receive a sign-up bonus
I ranging anywhere from $5000 to
$10,000. and that still ain't hay.
Naturally the pros should leave
the college players alone except in
those few cases where scholastic
failure makes it impossible for* aj
man to continue his schooling. Most
j of the college graduates are around
21 years of age. They have four
years of competitive action behind
them, a degree in their pockets, and
the brains not to enter into any en
tangling alliances that too often ex
act much mofe from a contractor
than they give in return.
