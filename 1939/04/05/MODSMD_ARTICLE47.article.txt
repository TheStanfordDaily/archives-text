IN his latest report to the Board of Trustees,
President Wilbur stresses the necessity of a
freedom of discussion both in classes and in
informal groups for the future of educational
processes.
He declares in effect that it is the place of
the university to present both sides of the
political, social, and economic pictures of the
world. To trace the contrast of differing ideolo
gies under chaotic, although stimulating con
ditions.
Stanford has long had an enviable record in
the field of academic freedom. There are, quite
naturally and quite correctly, certain precepts
or assumptions upon which its curriculum is
based. Yet, there is only one case on record in
which a professor has been asked to leave this
university because of his leanings.
In direct contrast, it is no secret that some of
the greatest universities of the world are con
trolled by state offices of propaganda—an at
tempt on the part of the totalitarian governments
for self-perpetuation.
It is also no secret that there is a gathering
pressure for adoption of governmental systems
of like character in this country, although still
remote. But the remoteness does not alter the
situation.
It is not unusual that Dr. Wilbur should take
indirect cognizance and make suggestions as
to methods for counteraction.
It is significant, however, that he should re
iterate the necessity of free discussion in edu
cational institutions, as has been in operation
at Stanford for 47 years in an annually increas
ing degree.
It is more significant, perhaps, that the head
of a conservative institution such as Stanford
admittedly is—the very type of group from
which restriction most often springs—should
still feel that such academic freedom is and
will continue to be a fundamental necessity.
