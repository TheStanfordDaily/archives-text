# Tovarich at Stanford
## 
### 
THE alumni are right on the job these days.
If it isn't one thing it's another.
Besides starting their 10-day drive for alumni
dues this week, they are putting on Jagues
Deval's comedy, "Tovarich," in the Memorial
Hall auditorium Saturday night.
This production, coming so near the first of
the guarter, will give the campus something to
read, something to sit on during rather a slack
week-end before the hysterical treadmill of
spring guarter activities starts grinding.
Those who saw "Tovarich" when it was pro
duced in San Francisco probably will be glad
of a chance to see it again. Those who saw the
play plus its nauseatingly streamlined film
version should enjoy reassuring themselves the
play itself was intelligible. •
To those who want to help out the Alumni
Association, the play presents a chance to slip
them anywhere from 50 cents to $1.50. To those
who don't care particularly about the alumni
but think they should help out, the play gives
a painless way to ease conscience pangs.
Those who don't give a damn about the
alumni also will find themselves enjoying the
play if they can slip their dislike into a handy
little logic-tight compartment and pretend they
are at the Curran or the Geary.—R. D.
