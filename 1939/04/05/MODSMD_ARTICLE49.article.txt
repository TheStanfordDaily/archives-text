# Ghost to Walk
## 
### 
THE ghost of Stanford will stalk Treasure
Island next Saturday. When the officials of
the San Francisco Exposition named April 8 as
Stanford Day, they expected that the University
would be pleased and proud to show the out
side world some of the progress it is making
in science, some of the scholars, athletes, and
entertainers it is developing.
The Yerba Buena brass-hats had sound bases
for their suppositions. Our rivals across the Bay
had supplied the fair with some of its most
outstanding permanent scientific exhibits; they
were playing basketball games and staging
track and field events there. Other Pacific Coast
colleges had snapped up eagerly all efforts to
show their wares on Treasure Island.

But Stanford is different. With the announce
ment of the official day at the exposition a buck
passing procedure not unfamiliar in these parts
ran its course. The A.S.S.U. woefully turned its
pockets inside out and declared it couldn't af
ford to sponsor anything. The administration
also declared itself penniless and went back to
studying the plans of the Hoover Library of War,
Peace, and Revolution. When the project was
turned over to the Alumni Association, the old
grads too decided that it wasn't worth the
trouble.
So Stanford Day has been postponed indefi
nitely. It seems unfortunate that none of the
scientific marvels the Farm is producing can
be exhibited at the fair, that the glee club cannot
sing, that the modern dance group cannot repeat
its presentation of "The Juggler of Notre Dame,"
that the band cannot play, that one of T. W.
Stevens' streamlined Shakespearean produc
tions could not be revived. Perhaps the Olym
pic Club track meet could have been held on
the Island, or the rugby game with British
Columbia could have been scheduled for next
Saturday.
A dozen things might have been done without
incurring a tremendous expense. But Stanford
is different.—L. L.
