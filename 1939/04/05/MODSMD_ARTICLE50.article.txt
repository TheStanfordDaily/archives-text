### JOHN COBBS 
LITTLE MAN WITH THE HAMMER
TINKERING with the honor code has always been
one of Stanford's most popular games, since it re
quires less work than reading good books but is more
respectable than tit-tat-toe. Usually the menacing ad
vances on the present system wind up as mere intel
lectual weight lifting, which is harmless enough. But
during the last finals week some of the professors put
their trained minds to work on the problem; the re
sults would have been very much the same if the
professors had used a sledge hammer in trying to re
pair a watch.
One or two of the professors announced to their
classes that the examination could not be taken out of
the classroom. Presumably the students could leave,
but they could not write the examination except in
the designated torture chamber.
Another instructor demanded that students check
their books in his office before going out of the room.
Others informed their classes that leaving the room
was prima facie evidence of dirty work. In their opin
ions of human nature the professors seemed in com
plete agreement with penitentiary wardens.
* * # *
a suspicious professor is nothing to
spoil a pleasant spring day, although most of us
will agree that he is a misfortune for mankind in gen
eral. But in this case it annoys me to see instructors
pulling to pieces a perfectly good system simply be
cause they never got rid of the childhood ambition to
be a big policeman.
The honor code won't work any better if students
are compelled to write their examinations in one room.
As long as they can leave for any reason, they have
the same opportunities for dishonesty they have now.
And unless the ingenious professors can change human
physiology, students will have to leave every so often.
* * * *
Requiring the student to work in one particular
room is useless in preventing cheating. And most of us
don't consider it a compliment. Theoretically we are
on our honor; if so, we ought to be able to stay honest
without mass policing.
Any man with a teaspoonful of brains can do all
the cheating he neds in five minutes. It doesn't mat
ter to him whether or not he can take his bluebook
out of the room.
And so it appears that the professors' tinkering has
not improved our machinery. Instead it has weakened
the appeal to personal integrity, which is the basis of
the system. They call it their professorial prerogative.
I call it sabotage.

on our honor; if so, we ought to be able to stay honest
without mass policing.
Any man with a teaspoonful of brains can do all
the cheating he neds in five minutes. It doesn't mat
ter to him whether or not he can take his bluebook
out of the room.
And so it appears that the professors' tinkering has
not improved our machinery. Instead it has weakened
the appeal to personal integrity, which is the basis of
the system. They call it their professorial prerogative.
I call it sabotage.
LITTLE MAN WITH THE HAMMER
TINKERING with the honor code has always been
one of Stanford's most popular games, since it re
quires less work than reading good books but is more
respectable than tit-tat-toe. Usually the menacing ad
vances on the present system wind up as mere intel
lectual weight lifting, which is harmless enough. But
during the last finals week some of the professors put
their trained minds to work on the problem; the re
sults would have been very much the same if the
professors had used a sledge hammer in trying to re
pair a watch.
One or two of the professors announced to their
classes that the examination could not be taken out of
the classroom. Presumably the students could leave,
but they could not write the examination except in
the designated torture chamber.
Another instructor demanded that students check
their books in his office before going out of the room.
Others informed their classes that leaving the room
was prima facie evidence of dirty work. In their opin
ions of human nature the professors seemed in com
plete agreement with penitentiary wardens.

a suspicious professor is nothing to
spoil a pleasant spring day, although most of us
will agree that he is a misfortune for mankind in gen
eral. But in this case it annoys me to see instructors
pulling to pieces a perfectly good system simply be
cause they never got rid of the childhood ambition to
be a big policeman.
The honor code won't work any better if students
are compelled to write their examinations in one room.
As long as they can leave for any reason, they have
the same opportunities for dishonesty they have now.
And unless the ingenious professors can change human
physiology, students will have to leave every so often.

Requiring the student to work in one particular
room is useless in preventing cheating. And most of us
don't consider it a compliment. Theoretically we are
on our honor; if so, we ought to be able to stay honest
without mass policing.
