A Harvard man has become famous over night, and
a Stanford woman has failed to because of a bit of
bad timing.
The Harvard man became famous because he swal
lowed a live goldfish.
The Stanford woman did not become famous be
cause she swallowed a live goldfish the week before
finals when The Daily was not coming out and she
could not get any publicity.
But nevertheless one of Stanford's own freshman
girls did swallow a goldfish in her little room in Roble.
The Harvard man got a fiat $10 for his performance.
As I understand it, the Farm girl did her fish swallow
ing performance for $5. But she charged her friends a
small fee to watch her do it, and cleared another $5.
One of her customers fainted dead away as the
fish wiggled down the frosh's esophagus.

FIRE

That same week the Farm firemen went out in their
shiny red fire trucks for their weekly Sunday drill.
It doesn't make me feel any .safer to realize that the
last truck was so slow that by the time it had reached
the post office, it had to stop for one of the firemen to
ask someone which way Ihe other trucks had gone.

COMEBACK

Neatest squelch of the season happened a few days
ago down at one of Palo Alto's restaurants.
A few of the Farm boys were eating there, and they
had a good waitress. When I say that I don't neces
sarily mean that she was quick and efficient at waiting
on their table and all that. I mean she was good.
And, as often happens, a good waitress can bring a
certain disgusting coyness, cuteness, out of almost
any guy.
One, at least, of these boys became cute. At one
point the cute one saw cle luxe coffee on the menu and
said, "May I have deloox milk rather than deloox
coffee?"
"Delux milk," the girl coldly corrected him.

FOOL

You would think by now they would have flunked
all of the impossibly dumb ones out of this school. It's
spring quarter, after all, and you would think that in
two quarters they would have sort of weeded them all
out.
A girl, of course. She made her check payable for
$100.15.
Standing in line to register she had probably told
the people around her how ridiculous, how petty it
was of the university to charge 15 cents sales tax to
register

had a good waitress. When I say that I don't neces
sarily mean that she was quick and efficient at waiting
on their table and all that. I mean she was good.
And, as often happens, a good waitress can bring a
certain disgusting coyness, cuteness, out of almost
any guy.
One, at least, of these boys became cute. At one
point the cute one saw cle luxe coffee on the menu and
said, "May I have deloox milk rather than deloox
coffee?"
"Delux milk," the girl coldly corrected him.

FOOL

You would think by now they would have flunked
all of the impossibly dumb ones out of this school. It's
spring quarter, after all, and you would think that in
two quarters they would have sort of weeded them all
out.
A girl, of course. She made her check payable for
$100.15.
Standing in line to register she had probably told
the people around her how ridiculous, how petty it
was of the university to charge 15 cents sales tax to
register
FISII

A Harvard man has become famous over night, and
a Stanford woman has failed to because of a bit of
bad timing.
The Harvard man became famous because he swal
lowed a live goldfish.
The Stanford woman did not become famous be
cause she swallowed a live goldfish the week before
finals when The Daily was not coming out and she
could not get any publicity.
But nevertheless one of Stanford's own freshman
girls did swallow a goldfish in her little room in Roble.
The Harvard man got a fiat $10 for his performance.
As I understand it, the Farm girl did her fish swallow
ing performance for $5. But she charged her friends a
small fee to watch her do it, and cleared another $5.
One of her customers fainted dead away as the
fish wiggled down the frosh's esophagus.

FIRE

That same week the Farm firemen went out in their
shiny red fire trucks for their weekly Sunday drill.
It doesn't make me feel any .safer to realize that the
last truck was so slow that by the time it had reached
the post office, it had to stop for one of the firemen to
ask someone which way Ihe other trucks had gone.

COMEBACK

Neatest squelch of the season happened a few days
ago down at one of Palo Alto's restaurants.
A few of the Farm boys were eating there, and they
had a good waitress. When I say that I don't neces
sarily mean that she was quick and efficient at waiting
on their table and all that. I mean she was good.
