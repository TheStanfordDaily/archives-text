# Dunne, Boyer, Not Plot Make 'Love Affair'
## 
### 
"LOVE AFFAIR," starring Irene
Dunne and Charles Boyer, playinir
today and tomorrow at I lie Stanford
Theater.
Although advertised as the great
est love story since "Romeo and Ju
liet," "Love Affair" is only such
because of the outstanding perform
ances by Irene Dunne and Charles

Boyer, not be
' cause of the plot.
The plot is a
variation of the
rich girl - poor
boy type. Charles
? Boyer makes his
living out of love,
being a sort of
high-class gigolo.
He is on his way
across the Atlan-

tic to marry a very rich girl. Irene
Dunne is on the same boat, about
to marry her rich boss, who has
made her his Paris buyer.
They fall in love, and plan to
work separately on their own. Six
months from then they are to meet,
but as she is on her way to the ren
dezvous, she meets with an accident.
He waits nearly all night. Then de
cides she has gone back to her rich
boss.
Although this plot may seem trite,
you have a feeling that maybe the
boy won't get the girl. However,
the stars really make the picture.
Charles Boyer is more than believ
able as a great lover. Why they in
sist on casting Robert Taylor in ro
mantic parts when there are men
such as he who really can fill the
role is one of those secrets of Holly
wood—like Eleanor Powell's fre
quent appearance in movies.
Another pleasant feature is Irene
Dune's return ot more serious
parts. There is comedy, but it is
toned down, more in keeping with
what seems to be her real personal
ity. And of course her singing is
more than good.
Love Affair may not be the great
est thing since "Romeo and Juliet"
but it is the best thing in a long
time, not sticky with sentiment, but
with plenty of the good old thing
that makes the world go round.

but it is the best thing in a long
time, not sticky with sentiment, but
with plenty of the good old thing
that makes the world go round.
