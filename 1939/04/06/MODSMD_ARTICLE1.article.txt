### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
/ iNE afternoon during finals, when
the world was wondering who
was going to fire the first shot in
the European war, a squadron of
airplanes flew over the Library. So
conscious of the international peril
were the students of the university,
that a large number of them left
their books and went outside just to
assure themselves that Stanford had
not been invaded.
This action may seem thoughtless,
illogical at first glance, but it must
lx> remembered that every psycho
logical factor was in its favor. That
day the entire reading, listening,
watching world had the jitters. With
everyone concentrating on the pos
sibility of war, it took no Orson
Welles to terrorize the Library.
* * *
Today there is less war talk on
English Corner, the Law Steps, or
in the Cellar. The first shock has
passed; Adolf Hitler has taken
Czechoslovakia without any active
opposition. Here on the Farm
fewer men are making sure they
have flat feet and had eyes, hut
across the Atlantic peace is still
trembling on the brink of the pit.
One fact alone is reassuring—Eu
rope's major menace has retired to
his mountain home at Berchtes
gaden for a 13-day vacation, which
may mean that no boundaries will
be changed for the next fortnight.
However, of late Hcrr Hitler has
taken to surprising the world, and
the territorial ambitions set forth
in "Meiti Kampf" have not yet been
completely fulfilled.
# * #
r | I HOSE who are looking for some
thing to worry about on the Eu
ropean scene have only to look in
the direction of Albania, the little
kingdom on the Adriatic Sea, toward
which Signor Mussolini has been
turning a lustful eye. With the Ital
ian government declaring its inten
tion to establish a protectorate there
and the Albanians preparing to re
sist. the Fascist troops that are
scheduled to land today, it seems
likely that the miniature monarchy
will play Lucrece to II Duce's Sex
tus.
In accordance with orders from
home, all Italians were leaving
Albania last night, which is strong
indication that there is going to
he -trouble. King Zog has his
troops lined up, ready to attack
II Duce's forces, and he has called
his cabinet into an emergency
session.
* *
If Italy attacks this economically
valueless mountain land, its purpose
will be to prevent Albania's neigh
bors, Jugoslavia and Greece, from
joining Mr. Chamberlain's stop-
Hitler movement. The British Prime
Minister is trying to sell the Balkan
states on his new anti-Nazi protec
tive association, and Mussolini
doesn't intend to let him muscle in
on his territory.
Full well II Duee understands the
importance of the Rome-Berlin axis.
He has seized upon Albania as the
logical means of showing the world
that the southern end of the com
bine means business. It is practical
ly impossible for any dictator to keep
from being overshadowed by Adolf
Hitler, but Premier Mussolini wants
to prove that he still is no slouch
at land-grabbing, even if he can't
do it on a Czechoslovakian scale.
* * «
England comes evidence
that Chamberlain has realized
at last that the only hope for Eu
rope lies in an armed peace. Con
sequently the British army and
navy are fully armed and man
ned and today stand set to meet
any eventuality, including a sur
prise attack by the wily German
Fuehrer.
Yesterday the man with the um
brella told the House of Commons
that England must be ready for any
thing in these times of tension. Then
he returned to his private offices and
concluded his mutual defensive
agreement with the representatives
of Poland. Thus forging a major
link in the chain with which Britain
hopes to surround the Reich.

To insure the practical solidarity
of the Rome-Berlin axis and to
tuiard against any unforeseen move
by the Franco-British alliance, chiefs
yesterday began consultations at
of the German and Italian armies
Innsbruck in the Nazi province of
Austria. Both Mussolini and Hitler
cannot afford any uncertainty about
their ability to repulse the anti-
German drive which is gathering
momentum as the days pass.
Even more clubby than the
military confab is Hermann (locr
injf's visit to the Italian colony of
Lybia which is expected to take
place today.
For the benefit of the illiterati, one
of the American picture magazines
predicted that the next war will be
set off by the assassination of the
Number 2 Nazi upon such an occa
sion. Est-ce possible?
