# Axe Society To Sponsor Faculty Day
## Students to Tangle With Professors On Next Thursday's Bill 
### 
Axe Society, in a meeting last
night, voted unanimously to again
sponsor a Student-Faculty Day, first
attempted and proved successful
last year. April 13, next Thursday,
has been slated as the date for this
informal get-together of both stu
dents and faculty on the same level.
Festivities will get under way on
the intramural field promptly at 3
o'clock, led off by a fight-to-the
death baseball tussle between an
Encina freshman nine and a flashy
aggregation of Western Civilization
instructors. To further the chaotic
enjoyment of the afternoon Coach
Tiny Thornhill has canceled regular
football practice, and, from last
minute reports, it is believed that
these gridiron boys are to meet a
BA.C. nine in a five-inning baseball
game.
Those students and instructors
who do not wish the rough and
tumble contact of the rougher games
will be able to spend the afternoon
playing such games as ping pong
and horseshoes. Feature event of the
afternoon will be the three-legged
race, which will pair into teams one
rough with one faculty member.
Although President Wilbur, last
year's horseshoe champion, is in the
East at present, it is hoped that he
will be able to return in time to
defend his title against the
self-reputed Stanford horseshoe ex
ponents.
According to information released
through the Axe Society, all frater
nities and eating clubs have can
celed their evening meal on this
field day in order that all students
may be served on the intramural
field. To officially conclude the day,
a committee of Robleites will begin
to serve the informal supper about
4:30 o'clock. As last year, pick-up
teams will be permitted to play
baseball games alter dinner.
The committee heads selected by
the Axe Society to lead the festivi
ties are as follows: Woody Miller,
signs; Lloyd Gates, invitations; Art
Gore, events; Bob Livingston, food;
and Dick Brun, finances.
