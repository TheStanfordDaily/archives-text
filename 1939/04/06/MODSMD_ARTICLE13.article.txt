# Former Dean Culver Presents Annual Report to President
## 
### 
Significant changes that have
taken place in student social and I
academic life during the 18-year ad- i
ministration of George B. Culver,!
dean of men who retired last year, |
include the Honor Code, the Encina i
sponsor system, abolition of fresh- !
man hazing, and student self-gov- i
eminent, according to his report to
the President for the academic year j
1937-33.
These changes, he indicated, were |
responsible in large part for Stan
ford's development into a co-ordi
nated, unified university.
The report of the former dean of i
men contained revealing glimpses j
into the recent history of the Uni- !
versity, and showed the attempts of j
an administrator to accomplish an i
effective administartion while yet
leaving students free to make their I
own decisions.
HONOR CODE SUCCESS
Concerning the Honor Code, Dean I
Culver said in his report, "My own !
feeling is that the Honor Code, or
honor system, adopted by the stu
dents in 1919-20, upon the approval
of the president of the University,
has been a most important and help
ful factor in creating and fostering i
a wholesome feeling of self-respon
sibility on the part of the students
toward the University.
"... the Honor Code has grown i
into a form of more or less unde
fined but well-established principles
or concepts which pertain to many
phases of student life and activities." |
Dean Culver termed abolition of'

basis that it was nothing more than
a form of mass violence and abuse
of individual liberty at the hands
of a superior number of "raiders,"
the situation was eventually wiped
out on the Stanford campus, Dean
Culver asserted.
Abolition of hazing led also to
abolition of traditional but too-vio
lent water fights and other fracases
between classes during the years of
Dean Culver's administration.
Concluding this section of his re
port Dean Culver said, "My own
feeling and belief is that a large
number of the various constructive
developments previously mentioned
in this report were made possible
and came about through the active
interest of the Encina sponsors.
These men held positions of honor
and were charged with one of the
most important phases of freshman
education, that of wholesome ad
justment to environment.
PRAISES STUDENTS
"They responded, as most worth
while men are wont to do, when
granted authority within the scope
of their capacities. They made them
selves felt throughout the student
life of the campus, and their work
was always constructive."
The Dean's report also commented
upon the growing acceptance of
group responsibility on the part of
fraternities and clubs as an increas
ingly important part of the Stanford
picture, saying that he believed they
had done much in binding the Uni
versity together into a unit.

velopment. in student life and ac
tivities." He explained that this
was accomplished by an organization
of returned ex-service men, many of
whom had been appointed as spon
