# Lake Going Dry; Canoeing May Close in Two Weeks
## New Boathouse May Be Wasted On Empty Sink 
### 
Because the rain nods passed by
the Reservation this year, Stanford
is wondering this wqek just how
long it will be able to use its shiny
$8800 boathou.se.
Head Lifeguard Hal Weatherbc
yesterday predicted that the reced
ing waterline in Lake Lagunita will
necessitate closing of the lake to
canoes within two weeks. Accord
ing to Weatherbc, this winter's light
rainfall and early spring season
have prevented the lake from
reaching normal level.
"Last year's top mark was 37 feet,
while this year's high was only 32Vi
feetâ€”and that was l>efore vacation,"
Weatherbc said. "The lake's falling
at (he rate of about two inches or
more a day. It's down to 30 foot
now," he continued.
NO MORE WATER
Lake Lagunita is dependent upon
the overflow from Searsville Lake
that flows through a narrow ditch,
James McDonnell, superintendent of
buildings and grounds, disclosed.
When Searsville, source of Univer
sity water supply, is low, as it is
this year, the overflow to Lagunita
is slight, McDonnell said.
It will be absolutely impossible to
fill the lake by artificial methods,
McDonnell intimated.
STUDENTS WIN BOATIIOUSE
Following on the heels of a Daily
campaign, the A.S.S.U. last Novem
ber authorized the destruction of
the 25-year-old boathouse and erec
tion of a new structure. Augmenting
prize-winning plans submitted by
Dick Spencer, Architects Bakewell
end Weihc drew blueprints for the
modernistic two-floor building.
Construction began in December
and the Farm's "Christmas present"
was dedicated, presented to the Uni
versity by A.S.S.U. President Becbs
Lee on March 4 while the campus
celebrated with water sports and
barhccuc dinner.
After only one month's use, the
new blue and white monument to
Hollywood-at-Stanford seems des
tined to lie idle on the shores of
Lagunita until next winter's rains
bring suntan sports back to the
Farm.
