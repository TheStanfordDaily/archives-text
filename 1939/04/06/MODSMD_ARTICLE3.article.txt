# Class of '39 Begins Fund Drive Today
## Laney's Campaign Committee Convenes To Hear Pep Talks 
### 
The combined campaigns of the
Annual Appeal of the Stanford
Fund and the alumni Membership
Drive swing into action today with
60 senior workers canvassing all
members of the Class of '39. Final
instructions were given the drivers
at a meeting last night.
The purpose and significance of
the campaigns were explained bji
Dave Ryus, president of the senior
class. Ryus discussed the impor
tance of the Stanford Fund in help
ing to assure Stanford's future as a
top-ranking school of the nation.
He related also the benefits of mem
bership in the Alumni Association.
Dr. Harry Reynolds, Class of 1896,
delivered the main address of the
meeting. He spoke of his under
graduate days and told of the sacri
fices of Mrs. Leland Stanford to
keep the University going during
trying times. In conclusion, Dr.
Reynolds asked, "Is it asking too
much of you to help those who arc
coming to Stanford in the future by
contributing to the Fund? It is truly
a privilege to enter the Stanford
family by joining the Association."
Jack Laney, chairman, explained
the mechanical workings of the cam
paigns. Information sheets were dis
tributed to the drivers telling about
the workings of the Alumni Asso
ication and the Fund and explaining
how the contributions should be col
lected.
Another point stressed was that
regular alumni dues are $4, but
membership is being offered to
members of the Class of '39 for $2.
Emphasized by all speakers was
the main aim of the Fund which is
to obtain a larger number of con
tributors than in the two years
previous. No matter what size the
gift—from 25 cents to $50 —every
senior is asked to contribute.
