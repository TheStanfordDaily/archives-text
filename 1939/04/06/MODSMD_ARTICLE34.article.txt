### ARCH JENKINS 
IF YOU'RE one of those Lake
Lagunita Loungers, then you prob
ably can't understand how Tiny
Thornhill can have the colossal
gumption to schedule four football
workouts a week for the hopefuls.
The idea of a normal, healthy col
lege lad being subjected to a dozen
pounds of equipment and unimagin
able physical torture while the rest
of us nudes are finding trouble
reaching the water with those over
weight paddles, is hard to conceive.
Arc they men or mice? Or are we
just lazy rats? We won't answer
that one.
* * *
JUST THE SAME, Tiny has
started the six-weeks grind that
will do much to pave the path for
Stanford's fortune or misfortune in
I lie grid wars next fall. It's tough
on the fellows who like to sun
bathe, but it's one of the require
ments of big-time football which we
can't deny.
Without it. Thornhill would have
to do three months' drilling in two
short weeks in the fall. The first
game usually falls on the last of
September. Conference rules pro
hibit fall practices before September
10. The squad would barely have
time to learn signals in a short ses
sion like that.
Stanford could de-emphasize the
sport by banning spring drills, but
the beatings they'd take during the
season wouldn't be worth the risk.
And a physical beating is the fore
runer of a financial lambasting. De
emphasize football and you might
just as well lock up the gym. There
wouldn't be enough revenue left to
conduct an intramural ping-pong
tournament.
So now that we've saved spring
practice for posterity, let's see what
Tiny has got to bring out of his
magic bag to boot Stanford into the
Rose Bowl, or a win in the Big
Game, or against Santa Clara, if
that isn't going too far.
Tony Calvelli, Pete Zagar, Jack
Clark. Bill McElroy, By West, five
of the best linemen on the Coast,
are gone. The only trouble with
Stanford last fall was the fact that
they played Santa Clara and took
such a pasting in the first game that
they didn't really recover until the
Big Game. Had that great quintet
only realized their capabilities a
little earlier, Stanford could have
gone through with that single loss
to the Broncos.
Bill Paulman, still the most under
rated back in the country last fall,
is through in the backfield, as are
Freddie Ledeboer, A1 Alustiza, Bill
Kirsch, and Glenn Hamilton. Hamp
Pool, an all-Coast guard in many
books at the end of the season, may
or may not have one more year. Un
til the conference rules on his case
in June, Pool will alternate between
track and football just in case.
# * *
RIGHT NOW, it's pretty well es
tablished that center and guard will
be the toughest spots to fill of the
whole lot. Colin McClintock, from
the frosh, might fill the pivot spot
and somebody down in Los Angeles,
called Yank Levin and Dave Pat
terson a couple of ail-Americans
after the way they played a game
at guard against U.C.L.A. Of course,
frosh prospects don't always come
through, but don't be a bit sur
prised if the center trio of the Indian
varsity next, fall isn't completely
sophomore.
The rest of the frosh will have a
tougher time of it, especially at end
and in the backfield. Little Frankie
Albert and Frank Kmetovic were
the yearlings' ace runners last sea
son. Albert turned out yesterday
but Kmetovic is a frosh sprinter for
Bill Ellington and might keep out
of the drills.
There are all kinds of ifs, ands,
and mebbes about the whole set of
possibilities, but the backs, Paulman
excluded, are as good as last year.
The line is going to be strong but
largely inexperienced. It all depends
on the new blood, and the way
they grasp the situation at hand,
whether us Injuns have a ball club
or not.

be the toughest spots to fill of the
whole lot. Colin McClintock, from
the frosh, might fill the pivot spot
and somebody down in Los Angeles,
called Yank Levin and Dave Pat
terson a couple of ail-Americans
after the way they played a game
at guard against U.C.L.A. Of course,
frosh prospects don't always come
through, but don't be a bit sur
prised if the center trio of the Indian
varsity next, fall isn't completely
sophomore.
The rest of the frosh will have a
tougher time of it, especially at end
and in the backfield. Little Frankie
Albert and Frank Kmetovic were
the yearlings' ace runners last sea
son. Albert turned out yesterday
but Kmetovic is a frosh sprinter for
Bill Ellington and might keep out
of the drills.
There are all kinds of ifs, ands,

JUST THE SAME, Tiny has
started the six-weeks grind that
will do much to pave the path for
Stanford's fortune or misfortune in
I lie grid wars next fall. It's tough
on the fellows who like to sun
bathe, but it's one of the require
ments of big-time football which we
can't deny.
Without it. Thornhill would have
to do three months' drilling in two
short weeks in the fall. The first
game usually falls on the last of
September. Conference rules pro
hibit fall practices before September
10. The squad would barely have
time to learn signals in a short ses
sion like that.
Stanford could de-emphasize the
sport by banning spring drills, but
the beatings they'd take during the
season wouldn't be worth the risk.
And a physical beating is the fore
runer of a financial lambasting. De
emphasize football and you might
just as well lock up the gym. There
wouldn't be enough revenue left to
conduct an intramural ping-pong
tournament.
So now that we've saved spring
practice for posterity, let's see what
Tiny has got to bring out of his
magic bag to boot Stanford into the
Rose Bowl, or a win in the Big
Game, or against Santa Clara, if
that isn't going too far.
Tony Calvelli, Pete Zagar, Jack
Clark. Bill McElroy, By West, five
of the best linemen on the Coast,
are gone. The only trouble with
Stanford last fall was the fact that
they played Santa Clara and took
such a pasting in the first game that
they didn't really recover until the
Big Game. Had that great quintet
only realized their capabilities a
little earlier, Stanford could have
gone through with that single loss
to the Broncos.
Bill Paulman, still the most under
rated back in the country last fall,
is through in the backfield, as are
Freddie Ledeboer, A1 Alustiza, Bill
Kirsch, and Glenn Hamilton. Hamp
Pool, an all-Coast guard in many
books at the end of the season, may

til the conference rules on his case
in June, Pool will alternate between
track and football just in case.

practice for posterity, let's see what
Tiny has got to bring out of his
magic bag to boot Stanford into the
Rose Bowl, or a win in the Big
Game, or against Santa Clara, if
that isn't going too far.
Tony Calvelli, Pete Zagar, Jack
Clark. Bill McElroy, By West, five
of the best linemen on the Coast,
are gone. The only trouble with
Stanford last fall was the fact that
they played Santa Clara and took
such a pasting in the first game that
they didn't really recover until the
Big Game. Had that great quintet
only realized their capabilities a
little earlier, Stanford could have
gone through with that single loss
to the Broncos.
Bill Paulman, still the most under
rated back in the country last fall,
is through in the backfield, as are
Freddie Ledeboer, A1 Alustiza, Bill
Kirsch, and Glenn Hamilton. Hamp
Pool, an all-Coast guard in many
books at the end of the season, may
or may not have one more year. Un
til the conference rules on his case
in June, Pool will alternate between
track and football just in case.

RIGHT NOW, it's pretty well es
tablished that center and guard will
be the toughest spots to fill of the
whole lot. Colin McClintock, from
the frosh, might fill the pivot spot
and somebody down in Los Angeles,
called Yank Levin and Dave Pat
terson a couple of ail-Americans
after the way they played a game
at guard against U.C.L.A. Of course,
frosh prospects don't always come
through, but don't be a bit sur
prised if the center trio of the Indian
varsity next, fall isn't completely
sophomore.
The rest of the frosh will have a
tougher time of it, especially at end
and in the backfield. Little Frankie
Albert and Frank Kmetovic were
the yearlings' ace runners last sea
son. Albert turned out yesterday
but Kmetovic is a frosh sprinter for
Bill Ellington and might keep out
of the drills.
There are all kinds of ifs, ands,
and mebbes about the whole set of
possibilities, but the backs, Paulman
excluded, are as good as last year.
The line is going to be strong but
largely inexperienced. It all depends
on the new blood, and the way
they grasp the situation at hand,
whether us Injuns have a ball club
or not.
