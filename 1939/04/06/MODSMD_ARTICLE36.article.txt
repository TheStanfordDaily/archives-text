TEAMS PRACTICE HERE
Divotmen from the tour competing
colleges worked out yesterday on
the Stanford course. The Card team
ran through some practice shots,
but were resting up lor the opener
today. U.S.C. held an extensive
practice Tuesday and continued with
a light one yesterday.
The Bruins from U.C.L.A. arrived
yesterday morning and played full
rounds, their scores running close to
75. The Bruins are rated with a
much better team this year than last,
but they have not been seen in com
petition here yet this year. The
U.C.L.A. team is made up of Walt
Davisson, Gaston Porter, Frank
Newell, Bob Barnard, Bob Qrtwin,
and Don Hall.
TWIGGS BUILDS TEAM
Although the Trojans are favored
to win the tournament, Coach Eddie
Twiggs has promised that his dark
horse team will make a good show
ing in spite of their lack of experi
ence. All four members of the Stan
ford team that won the National In
tercollegiate title last year have
graduated from the varsity team.
Coach Twiggs has been forced to
build a completely new team which
has a perfect record of no defeats,
but their only opponents were the
weak University of Colorado men.
Warren Berl, Dick Wright, and
Buck Finger will lead the attack this
morning for the Indians. Berl de
feated Finger in the finals of the
Stanford Invitational Meet last year
and then lost to Wright in the Santa
Clara county championships. The
other three divoters are Jack Sho
walter, Don Haslett, and Don Ken
nedy.
S.C. STRONG
The strong U.S.C. \eam consists of
Johnny Gray, Rennie Kelley, Bill
Rensom, Bob Herman, Maury Cain,
and Chuck Nagle. The Trojans de
feated Cal in a recent meet, and have
won all their contests this year.
Willard McKay will lead the con
tingent from Berkeley since he won
the intercollegiate title at Del
Monte last summer. Other Bears who
practiced on the local couise yes
terday were Len Thrasher, Don
Bruce, and Charles Adams. They
haven't decided the rest of their
team yet but Jack Lovegern will
probably be included.
