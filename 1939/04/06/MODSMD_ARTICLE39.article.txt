## Win Needham, 'Wink' Out of Bruin Meet 
### 
Two dire casualties to the Card
varsity swimming team fell from
somewhere-or-other yesterday to
impress the mermen with the idea
that they are really going to have to
fight to win their conference meet
with U.C.L.A. this coming Saturday.
Captain and All-American Win
Needham went back to the rest
home with a recurrence of his flu
which kept him out of the water for
about three weeks at the beginning
of the season. This will definitely
keep him from reaching his peak
condition of last year. If he is back
in shape by April 15 for the Cal
meet, Coach Nort Thornton feels
sure that he will not be able to carry
off his usual share of points—a
double win in both the 220 and 440
free style.
Second bombshell that fell will
knock five points from the Stanford
score on Saturday against the Bruins
will be the absence of Roy Winkel
mann, ace diver and Conference
champ. Considered a sure winner,
Winkelmann will be absent from the
Farm because of unavoidable per
sonal affairs.
Without these two men and the
probable fifteen points that they
would drag in, the rest of the In
dian mermen are practicing furi
ously so that they will be able to
follow their track brethren in
trouncing the Uclans.
