# Nine to Meet Trojans, Bears
## Bronc Defeat Puts Cards Back in Race 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity
baseball men, fresh from a smashing
18-3 triumph over the Santa Clara
i Broncos, have a chance to get back
into the thick of the C.1.8.F. race
this week-end when they meet
Southern California's Trojans and
the California Bears.
The Trojans, in second place in
the league standings, have been
winning games on their power at
bat. Sam Barry's lads consider the
day a total loss when they don't
score at least 10 runs. Jack Hanson,
sh<-t stop, is one of the most dan
gerous hitters that Card chuckers
A1 Lazzarone and Cootie Thompson
will face this year. S.C. has lost
only one league contest so far to the
I California Bears earlier this week.
