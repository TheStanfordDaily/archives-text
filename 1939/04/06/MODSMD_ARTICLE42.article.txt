# Jeffrey Stars In Informal Cinder Meet
## Clyde Runs 9.6 Dash; Wohle Outdistances Anderson in Shot Put 
### 
The crowd at Dink Templeton's
second of the newly inaugurated
"twilight meets got what they
wanted: a good look at Stanford's
c'indermen against good competi
tion and especially an idea of the
speed of Clyde Jeffrey.
Jeffrey Hashed through a 9.8 cen
tury dash, leading former Indian
track captain Ray Dean by a full
>ard. In a second 100 he nipped
Dean by a scant loot in disputed
time. Two A.A.U. timers and an
outsider caught Clyde at 9.(J but the
three officiating judges got another
9.8.
To round out the day's work,
"Jeff" rambled the anchor lap of
the relay in 47.8 on a team which
gave warning to U.S.C. by turning
the mile in 3:18.
CJRAKI) IMPROVES
Mushy Girard led Johnny Em
manuel through a 4:23.2 mile, win
ning by about 3 yards; but Little
Johnny came back to win a thrill
ing two-mile grind from Joe Mc-
Nabb, San Jose star, in the fine time
of D:43.5.
One of two come through per
formances of the afternoon was
turned in by Barney Ferguson, who
won a 1:57.2 half-mile, running the
best race of his lile. The other sur
prise winner was Bill Wohle, who
finally turned the trick on his team
mate Stan Anderson in the shot.
Wohle won at 51 ft. 10 in. against
Anderson's 51-foot even toss. After
competition was over Bill relaxed
and heaved the cannon ball 2 inches
over 52 feet.
ZAGAR DOES 162
Pete Zagar continued his string
of victories in the discus, hitting
IG2 feet again, and Hamp Pool
turned in his "best ever" heave by
doing 148. Pool can now be defi
nitely counted on for points in the
Trojan and California meets, and if
he continues to improve at his pres
ent pace will soon be pressing "Big
Pete."
In the hurdles the Cards looked
strong despite the fact that their
best high hurdler, Sid Hayes, was
sitting in the stands with a pulled
muscle. Bill Hawkins won the highs
in 14.8, barely beating teammate
Dick Simpson; and Captain Stan
Hiserman Hashed a bit of his old
form by beating Bev Gubser, Olym
pic Club star, in a 24.2 flight of low
barriers.
