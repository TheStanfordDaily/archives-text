SIXTY members of the Senior Committee in
charge of the joint Third Annual Appeal of
the Stanford Fund and Alumni Association
membership drive, both leveled at the Class of
1939, start soliciting their respective living
groups this morning.
And it's going to be a tough job.
Last night, that group of solicitors received
final instructions from Dave Ryus, their class
president, and Jack Laney, drive chairman,
and they heard Dr. Harry Reynolds, '96, de
scribe Stanford history and the meaning of
Stanford to an alumnus.
They heard Dr. Reynolds outline the early
struggle of the Stanfords to endow the Univer
sity to nearly the whole extent of their personal
savings; they heard of Mrs. Stanford's even
worse struggle to keep the University open in
the early years of its life.
It seems now, however, that that struggle is
not yet over. The University still needs sup
port —both moral and financial—to maintain it
self, for it no longer has the power to draw
on the personalities of its founders to help it
out of difficulty. -
There is no secrecy surrounding the fact that
Stanford needs money; sorely needs it to carry
on important research, to perform the normal
activity of higher educational institutions.
Both the Stanford Fund and the Alumni As
sociation are equipped to lend the necessary
aid to the University.
In the last two years, the former brought in
more than $70,000 for strengthening teaching
and research budgets. The accomplishments
of the Alumni Association need little review,
other than that it is the only way for Stanford
men and women to stay actively a part of
Stanford when graduated.
When solicitors for the two organizations ask
contributions of seniors this morning, they will
more than likely be greeted with something
similar to "Well, I suppose I will if I have to."
If that much.
But before such reaction, the seniors should
well remember that:
Stanford means more than from one to four
years as an undergraduate.
Stanford more than puts up the equivalent of
tuition and syllabus fees in meeting the cost of
educating each of its students.
Stanford needs the continued support of its
graduates.
Stanford's name means only so much as the
quality of the education it is able to give its
students.
And before that same reaction, they should
be glad of the opportunity to continue to lend
the lie to the familiar statement:
"Well, Mrs. Stanford, you need never worry
about 'your boys' helping you —they won't."

struggle of the Stanfords to endow the Univer
sity to nearly the whole extent of their personal
savings; they heard of Mrs. Stanford's even
worse struggle to keep the University open in
the early years of its life.
It seems now, however, that that struggle is
not yet over. The University still needs sup
port —both moral and financial—to maintain it
self, for it no longer has the power to draw
on the personalities of its founders to help it
out of difficulty. -
There is no secrecy surrounding the fact that
Stanford needs money; sorely needs it to carry
on important research, to perform the normal
activity of higher educational institutions.
Both the Stanford Fund and the Alumni As
sociation are equipped to lend the necessary
aid to the University.
In the last two years, the former brought in
more than $70,000 for strengthening teaching
and research budgets. The accomplishments
of the Alumni Association need little review,
other than that it is the only way for Stanford
men and women to stay actively a part of
Stanford when graduated.
When solicitors for the two organizations ask
contributions of seniors this morning, they will
more than likely be greeted with something
similar to "Well, I suppose I will if I have to."
If that much.
But before such reaction, the seniors should
well remember that:
Stanford means more than from one to four
years as an undergraduate.
Stanford more than puts up the equivalent of
tuition and syllabus fees in meeting the cost of
educating each of its students.
Stanford needs the continued support of its
graduates.
Stanford's name means only so much as the
quality of the education it is able to give its
students.
And before that same reaction, they should
be glad of the opportunity to continue to lend
the lie to the familiar statement:
"Well, Mrs. Stanford, you need never worry
about 'your boys' helping you —they won't."
SIXTY members of the Senior Committee in
charge of the joint Third Annual Appeal of
the Stanford Fund and Alumni Association
membership drive, both leveled at the Class of
1939, start soliciting their respective living
groups this morning.
And it's going to be a tough job.
Last night, that group of solicitors received
final instructions from Dave Ryus, their class
president, and Jack Laney, drive chairman,
and they heard Dr. Harry Reynolds, '96, de
scribe Stanford history and the meaning of
Stanford to an alumnus.
They heard Dr. Reynolds outline the early
struggle of the Stanfords to endow the Univer
sity to nearly the whole extent of their personal
savings; they heard of Mrs. Stanford's even
worse struggle to keep the University open in
the early years of its life.
