# Off the Shelf

AFTER lying limp on the shelf for almost a
year, student-faculty relations are in the
air again. Announcement today of Axe Soci
ety's second annual Field Day calls to mind the
time when informal affairs, encouraging con
tact between professors and students, were
scheduled for at least one afternoon each week.
A series of bull sessions in the Nitery and
visits to the homes of faculty members were
among the most popular events sponsored by
last year's committee, ably led by Putzie Hin
richs. If it were not for the Field Day, today
student-faculty relations probably would have
been relegated to the limbo of forgotten things.
A project as popular and profitable as this
should not be given up so quickly. Anyone
who attended last year's Field Day will testify
that the event was worth while, if only to prove
that Dr. Wilbur is the horseshoes champion of
the faculty, that the team of John Bunn and
Beebs Lee is invincible in a three-legged race,
that the frosh are better ball players than their
Western Civ profs.
There is no reason why the student-faculty
meet should not be the starting point for a series
of similar affairs this spring. Interest in such a
project may be languishing, but it certainly is
not dead.
One of the prime advantages of attending a
university with as small a student body as Stan
ford's is the opportunity for personal meetings
between professors and their students. If fac
ulty members were here for the sole purpose
of delivering lectures from their rostrums, the
administration could profitably replace them
with phonoqraph records.

But Stanford does not specialize in mass-pro
duction education. The personal touch still
means something here; it is completely in keep
ing with the spirit of the Farm.
However, if the students want to meet the
faculty informally, it is up to them to provide
the opportunities. Last year's experience shows
that the professors are ready and willing to co
operate. All they ask is that we release them
from their glass cases.â€”L. L.
