### JOHN COBBS 
HOLD YOUR TAMPER
AS I mentioned yesterday, casual tampering with the
honor code turned into a messy piece of sabotage
last finals week when some of the professors tried to
remodel the machinery according to their own specifi
cations. If the amateur mechanics were willing to
stop with this bit of axe-swinging, we could forget it.
But the odds are that they won't. For some time now
there has been a movement on the campus to revise
the honor code; at least there would be a movement
if the leaders knew what they wanted to do besides
make themselves conspicuous.
The usual argument for taking a wrench to the pres
ent machinery is that a small percentage of students
cheat now and get away with it. The reformers insist
that the system must be revised so that none of us
can avoid being as pure as the jokes at a faculty tea.

They tell us that the students must be forced to
report suspected violations. And they pollute other
wise excellent spring air with an involved explanation
of how we improve our souls by learning the higher
morality of acting as our brothei*'s keeper.
When it comes to practical methods, the reformers
usually change the subject and go back to higher mor
alities. But it seems that they want all students to
sign a pledge that they have seen no aid given. They
also suggest that students be forced to take the exam
in a particular room instead of being free to go where
they like.

Personally, I have no desire to be my brother's
keeper, although I grant that some of my brothers
probably need a keeper. And when I am writing an
examination I am much too busy to worry about the
morality of any other man.
The whole theory behind the honor system is that
the percentage of students cheating will be so small
that it can be ignored. We realize that the code will
be broken in a few cases. But we believe the number
negligible.
So far we have gotten along very nicely with our
system. We have appealed to the personal honesty of
the student, and as far as we can tell, our confidence
is justified.
* * sf* *
The reformers forget that no machine ever invented
works perfectly. Mechanics doesn't permit that fine
an adjustment. And if we try to hook up the honor
code according to the new plans, we will ruin it. A
man is willing to answer for his personal honesty, but
he will refuse to be responsible for his neighbor. I
don't consider that the honor code puts me under
any obligation to play Dick Tracy, particularly when
I'm trying to pass a final.
Forcing students to stay in one room weakens the
appeal to their honor. And it insults them, which
doesn't encourage a co-operative mood.
As it stands now, the system works as nearly per
fectly as anything we can put together. If the reform
ers want to bring salvation to the sinners, I suggest
that they try holding a revival service.
