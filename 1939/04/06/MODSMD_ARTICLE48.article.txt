LIFE ANI) LOVES
Ho was ingenious, all right, and probably a little
insane as well. That was clear after his Love Affair.
There was never a more Platonic love affair, nor a
more futile one.
He saw her in a class. It was one of these mornings
when his reflexes were working perfectly; like that
he was in love. He didn't have to look a second time;
he knew he was in love. But he did look a second
time. He looked for quite awhile.
He told the people around him how beautiful she
was. Tbey weren't particularly interested, but he
told them several times.
Now up to this point our friend has not acted
particularly insanely. To rave so over any Stanford
woman is a little ingenious, yes; but not really insane.
But wait.
After the class was over, lie could do nothing
but sit there. He did not follow her out of the
class room and lake advantage of any of the tricks
our boys use to meet our girls (or vice versa). He
just sat there.
But he did (ind out her name. And he found
that some of bis friends in the class knew her.
Please will you introduce me, he said.
They were willing on the second day the class
met to do this for him. They were surprised at his
wanting an introduction, and why couldn't he just
do it for himself, but they would introduce him.
Oh, I can't do it today, he said. I've got to be
smooth when I meet her.
This introduction business was not. going to be so
easy, he thought.. Several weeks went by before he
was ready. A thing like this takes courage, he would
say to himself.
Finally he went to his friends. Please will you in
troduce me at the next class, he said.
When he came to class the next day, he was all
dressed up. suit and all.
My God, you look smooth, his friends said. Today
will be the day.
Yeah, the guy said and simpered. But during the
process of simpering, he glanced down at his feet.
Oh! he exclaimed, I can't do it today. My socks
don't match. Of course I can't do it. when my socks
don't match. Thinking of meeting a beautiful girl like
that when my socks don't match!
The next day he met his friends and said. At
last. l oday is the day. Ill* was all dressed up again.
You have never in your life seen socks which
matched better.
The class was over. The girl got up and left. His
friends yanked him from his soat and started out in
pursuit. They were almost up to her. Suddenly
he gasped, turned, and ran away.
lie didn't have the courage.

that when my socks don't match!
The next day he met his friends and said. At

You have never in your life seen socks which
matched better.
The class was over. The girl got up and left. His
friends yanked him from his soat and started out in
pursuit. They were almost up to her. Suddenly
he gasped, turned, and ran away.

Ho was ingenious, all right, and probably a little
insane as well. That was clear after his Love Affair.
There was never a more Platonic love affair, nor a
more futile one.
He saw her in a class. It was one of these mornings
when his reflexes were working perfectly; like that
he was in love. He didn't have to look a second time;
he knew he was in love. But he did look a second
time. He looked for quite awhile.
He told the people around him how beautiful she
was. Tbey weren't particularly interested, but he
told them several times.
Now up to this point our friend has not acted
particularly insanely. To rave so over any Stanford
woman is a little ingenious, yes; but not really insane.
But wait.
After the class was over, lie could do nothing
but sit there. He did not follow her out of the
class room and lake advantage of any of the tricks
our boys use to meet our girls (or vice versa). He
just sat there.
But he did (ind out her name. And he found
that some of bis friends in the class knew her.
Please will you introduce me, he said.
They were willing on the second day the class
met to do this for him. They were surprised at his
wanting an introduction, and why couldn't he just
do it for himself, but they would introduce him.
Oh, I can't do it today, he said. I've got to be
smooth when I meet her.
This introduction business was not. going to be so
easy, he thought.. Several weeks went by before he
was ready. A thing like this takes courage, he would
say to himself.
Finally he went to his friends. Please will you in
troduce me at the next class, he said.
When he came to class the next day, he was all
dressed up. suit and all.
My God, you look smooth, his friends said. Today
will be the day.
Yeah, the guy said and simpered. But during the
process of simpering, he glanced down at his feet.
Oh! he exclaimed, I can't do it today. My socks
don't match. Of course I can't do it. when my socks
don't match. Thinking of meeting a beautiful girl like
that when my socks don't match!
