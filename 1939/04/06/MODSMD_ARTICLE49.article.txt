# Stimson Urges 'Stronger Than Words' Policy
## Former Secretary Seeks Partial Repeal Of Neutrality Act 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 5 (UP).—
Former Republican Secretary of
State Henry L. Stimson today ad
vocated partial repeal of the Neu
trality Act to free President Roose
velt's hands in curbing the aggres
sion of Germany, Italy and Japan.
He said members of the Rome-
Berlin-Tokyo axis had broken prom
ises and torn up all the treaties
standing in the way of their own
aggrandizement.
The expert on international af
fairs was the first witness at Senate
Foreign Relations Committee hear
ings on proposals for repeal or re
vision of the law. Tomorrow's chief
witness will be Bernard M. Baruch,
financier, presidential adviser, and
chairman of the World War Indus
tries Board.
Stimson quickly drew the fire of
Senate isolationists when he voiced
an almost blanket endorsement of
Mr. Roosevelt's foreign policy and
supported the President's theory,
now being put into practice, that
"there are measures short of war,
but stronger and more effective than
words," to halt the dictators.
The attack was led by Sen. Hiram
W. Johnson, Calif., who denied
Stimson's assertion that the neutral
ity act is rigidly restrictive and said
he would not give the President
"discretion to put us in a position
where he can take us into war."
"Do you believe in neutrality?"
Johnson asked.
"I am in favor of our country not
taking part—or meddling—in a war
unless it has some real interest that
may be injured by the war," he re
plied.
Upon further questioning by
Johnson Stimson said that an ag
gressor should be designated in any
war affecting the United States.
"Where do you go from there?"
Johnson demanded.
He said the next thing to deter
mine was whether the aggressor was
to be aided. He argued each par
ticular war should be treated as an
isolated case.
"Suppose Russia, Great Britain
and France take the field," Johnson
suggested, "would you have us enter
into an alliance?"
"Not unless the situation becomes
dangerous enough to indicate that
we would become the next victim,"
Stimson said. "I would get as many
friends on my side as I could. Pro
vided they could shoot straight."

Senate isolationists when he voiced
an almost blanket endorsement of
Mr. Roosevelt's foreign policy and
supported the President's theory,

Stimson's assertion that the neutral

he would not give the President
"discretion to put us in a position
where he can take us into war."

Johnson asked.

taking part—or meddling—in a war

may be injured by the war," he re

war affecting the United States.
"Where do you go from there?"
Johnson demanded.

isolated case.

suggested, "would you have us enter
