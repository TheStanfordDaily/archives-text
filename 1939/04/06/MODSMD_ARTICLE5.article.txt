# Snakes Alive! Killefer Nips Serpent Head
## 
### 
Harvard has its goldfish swal
! lowers.
But Stanford yesterday went
them one better when Tom Iville
| for, student manager, bit the head
off a water-snake for the sum of
! one dollar, cash in hand.
While sunning in the afternoon
at the o√üathouse. Killefer spied a
12-inch black-and-white water
: snake which had been caught, im
mediately offered to bite its head
! off for a sufficiently attractive
! sum.
One girl left.
An interested spectator produced
! a dollar bill.
After two minutes of expectant
j waiting, the crowd around Kille
fer lost interest, turned away mo
mentarily.
With a quick flourish, a crunch,
and a yank, Killefer won his bet,
threw the decapitated snake to the
ground, snatched his dollar bill,
dove into the water.
The rest of the girls left.
