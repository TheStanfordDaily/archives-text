## WOMEN AGAIN? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I, through you, ask a ques
tion of R.D., who spread himself on
the editorial page of the April 4
Daily under the caption, "Woman's
Place"? R.D.'s last paragraph is:
"It's a political mess all right. Wom
en will do it every time." My ques
tion is simple and brief. Are polit
ical messes the special concoction of
women? That they are seems to be
implicit in R.D.'s statements.
I doubt if I shall ever see in the
columns of The Daily or anywhere
else such a statement as: "It's a
political mess all right. Men will do
it every time," And yet, it seems to
me, that I get faint echoes of political
messes here, there and everywhere,
at home and abroad, in which men
seem to have some part. I presume
R.D. would say: Cherchez la feftime."
Sincerely yours,
Christobel Pankhurst
