# History ... 1939
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
I I'G" in the Bavarian Alps in his
"Eagle's Nest" sits Adolf Hitler,
looking down upon the nations of
Europe. As he contemplates the
chaotic scene, he is making plans
for his next coup, the move that
may spell peace or war in 1939.
In the madness that lies at the
Fuehrer's feet, the Italo-Albanian
situation, the Anglo-Polish pact, and
the German-Italian military con
clave appear to be the most signifi
cant factors today. The race between
the totalitarian states and the stop-
Hitler bloc is but the current version
of a long-term conflict which, it
seems, will inevitably lead to war.

As II Duce continued to threat
en Albania with demands for a
protectorate yesterday, King Zog
sent him word that his people
stand ready to resist any invasion.
The blood-thirsty Albanian moun
taineers waste little love on Italy,
and they have placed their mon
arch in an extremely embarrass
ing position:
They threaten to revolt if he does
not agree to oppose Mussolini's proj
ect, and although they are short in
numbers, they can easily put up a
fight fierce enough to involve the
rest of Europe in the conflict. In
desperation, Zog has attempted to
maintain the independence of his
kingdom by threatening to abdicate.
And all the while three Italian bat
tleships lie at anchor in the harbor
of his summer capitol.

jyjUSSOLINI knows that actual
warfare in Albania is not
worth while, even to impress the
Chamberlain chain with the strength
of the Rome-Berlin axis. There
fore, be probably will come to some
sort of agreement with the nation
he plans to use to bottle-up Jugo
slavian traffic in the Adriatic.
This can be accomplished in a
manner satisfactory to both Ital
ians and Albanians by King Zog's
granting of II Ducc's demands, and
at the same time maintaining the
framework of his government and
nominally continuing to rule the
land. If Italy wants to start trouble,
she will wait until the Reich is
ready to lend a hand, and it ap
pears that, as yet, Hcrr Hitler has
not given the nod to go ahead.
* * *
Meanwhile, at Innsbruck the con
ferences between leaders of the
Nazi and Fascist military forces
continue. Signs on the horizon indi
cate that these meetings may be pre
paratory to transforming the Rome-
Berlin axis into a military alliance.
Certain it is that the dictators are
planning something to indicate to
France and England that they are
not going to submit to a ring of
bayonets being formed around the
Reich. An invasion of Albania
hardly seems to be the most prac
tical means of showing their inten
tions. So perhaps the big boys will
resort, to a military pact to put the
squitch on Chamberlain's plan.

IN the House of Commons yes
terday, the British Prime Min
ister made the official announce
ment of the new Anglo-Polish mu
tual defense treaty. Immediately
the German press burst into a
torrent of abuse directed toward
Poland.
The Nazis told the Poles that if
they wanted to get mixed up with
those dirty crooks over in western
Europe, it. was all right with them—
but they had better watch out for
the consequences. This prc-adoles
ccnt view of a major international
situation is typical of the Hitler
controlled press, and the Poles
blithely ignored it.

What the people of the land
wedged between Soviet Russia and
Nazi Germany did not ignore yes
terday was the Fuehrer's renewed
demand for control of Danzig and
an armed motor highway across the
Polish Corridor to East Prussia.
When Adolf Hitler nourishes ambi
tions of this type, he usually suc
ceeds in realizing them. Therein lies
trouble for Poland, which today
means that England and France will
get in on it, too.
The Corridor, which is the Poles'
only outlet to the sea, separates
East Prussia from the rest of the
Kcich. The very mention of Ger
man designs on the important
trade center of Danzig causes Pol
ish generals to order out their
troops, and it is in this direction
that Mr. Chamberlain had better
look if he is trying to calculate
the results of his latest treaty.

The unpopularity of the Nazis was
further emphasized yesterday when
Sir Samuel Hoare, British Home
Secretary, revealed that his depart
ment is busy expelling Hitler's
agents from England. No nation as
self-conscious as Germany is going
to appreciate this kind of treatment,
but in these times minor insults have
ceased to be considered important.
