# Stanford Fund Drive To Contact Seniors
## 
### 
Entering the second day of the 10-day campaign for the Stanford Fund
and the Alumni Membership Drive, 60 drivers are continuing their work
of contacting more than 990 seniors in the 48 campus eating and living
groups and those residing off-campus. This is the first year that the two
campaigns have been combined.
The Stanford Fund Appeal originated three years ago. with 375 mem
bers of the Class of '37 contributing $87(5. The Class of '38 donated $877,

with 38S members participating. <
The main goal of the Fund is to
increase the number of contributors.
The amount that is to be given is
entirely up to the individual, but in
the past gifts have ranged from 25
cents to $50. Names of contributors
are published but not the amount of
individual gifts.
ONLY ANNUAL APPEAL
Every dollar that is contributed is
equal to $25 of the regular Stanford
endowment. In other words, each
dollar given accomplishes as much
as the returns from $25 of endow
ment. The Stanford Fund is the
University's only annual appeal for
funds. All Stanford alumni and
members of the graduating class are
included in the campaign.
The funds obtained are used to
provide scholarships and fellow
ships, to continue research, to pur
chase much needed books for the
Library, and for a variety of other
uses.
As stated by Dave Ryus, senior
class president, "By doing all these
specific jobs, your gift helps to keep
Stanford in the top rank of Ameri
can universities and thus preserves
for you the full value of your in
vestment.
ALUMNI SEEK MEMBERS
"I say this because the Stanford
brand which you have acquired and
will carry with you always v/ill al
ways be measured in the light of
the Stanford of the present," Ryus
concluded.

The second job for the senior
' drivers is to enroll their fellow class
| members in the Alumni Association.
! Membership is being offered for $2,
! while the regular dues are $4.
Many benefits are derived from
! participation in the Association.
Members receive a subscription to
the Stanford Illustrated Review.
Letters of introduction are available
to alumni and alumni clubs through
| out the world. But foremost is the
| opportunity afforded Stanford alumni
i to keep in contact with the school
| through the organization.
