Contributing much valuable and
original information to the study of
r< writ history, a group of eight men
and women have worked for the
past ten years on the Stanford cam
pus collecting, translating, and edit
in}, for use a library of material on
Ihi> causes and results of the Rus
sian Revolution.
The Russian Revolution Institute,
fin- such is the name of this group,
has access to what has been termed
the linest collection of documents on
the subject in the world today. This
collection is a part of the Hoover
War Library.
The staff, under Director H. H.
Fisher, includes Xenia Joukofi' Eu
diu, Klara Fetter, Olga Hess Gan
kin, M. T. B. Spalding, and Elena
V.i i neck, research associates; and
Jirina Markova and Ilelene von
Danim, research secretaries, and has
completed documentary studies of
the Bolshevik party policy during
the World War, the establishment of
the Third International, and other
events in Russia.
( UtE IN PUBLICATION
1 he controversial nature of the
subject studied has necessitated
: rent care in releasing information
for publication, according to Dr.
Fisher. The Institute's careful objec
tivity in presenting all sides of these
questions has been recognized by
the co-operation given the institute
by groups holding diverse political
views.
The collection includes original
documents of various governments,
printed books and newspapers, and
manuscripts. The material has been
c Mceted directly from the countries
under study, and much of it is origi
nal observation on the part of people
closely connected with events in
Russia at the time of the Revolution,
according to the director. The insti
tute maintains correspondence with
these people who are in an excellent
position to furnish accurate and
complete data.
<;i LAN RELATIONS
Questioned upon Russia's posi
tion in world politics, particularly
with regard to Russia's relation to
the German drive to the east, Dr.

Fisher emphasized the difficulty of
making predictions because of con
flicting accounts of the actual situa
tion in Russia.
"Russia's industrial strength has
increased tremendously in recent
years," he commented, "and her
strength in man-power and essential
raw materials is well known."
Because of her Bolshevik govern
ment, Dr. Fisher pointed out that
Russia occupies an unusual position
in regard to alliances with the small
countries of the Danube basin.
"These nations hesitate to make
actual alliances with Russia," he
said. "It is my opinion that they
fear such alliances might furnish
Germany a convenient excuse to
continue Nazi imperialism.
"They would rather ally with
Great Britain, for this reason, com
pleting only 'understandings' with
Russia."
COMMUNIST VIEW
Asked what was the essential dif
ference between the Communist and
Fascist dictatorships, Dr. Fisher as
serted: "The chief difference be
tween Communism and Fascism, in
theory at least, is that the former is
based upon democracy. The Com
munist view is that true democracy
is impossible under a capitalist sys
tem because of the power concen
trated in the hands of the wealthy,
and that true democracy can be
realized only after social classes have
been abolished and socialism ideal
ized.
"This ideal has not been realized,
however," he concluded. "At pres
ent, a state of socialism exists in
Russia, under a party dictatorship.
According to the revolutionaries,
this is a logical step from the capi
talist to the Communist system, and
eventually they hope lo develop
their true democracy."

The Russian Revolution Institute,
fin- such is the name of this group,
has access to what has been termed
the linest collection of documents on
the subject in the world today. This
collection is a part of the Hoover
War Library.
The staff, under Director H. H.
Fisher, includes Xenia Joukofi' Eu
diu, Klara Fetter, Olga Hess Gan
kin, M. T. B. Spalding, and Elena
V.i i neck, research associates; and
Jirina Markova and Ilelene von
Danim, research secretaries, and has
completed documentary studies of
the Bolshevik party policy during
the World War, the establishment of
the Third International, and other
events in Russia.
( UtE IN PUBLICATION
1 he controversial nature of the
subject studied has necessitated
: rent care in releasing information
for publication, according to Dr.
Fisher. The Institute's careful objec
tivity in presenting all sides of these
questions has been recognized by
the co-operation given the institute
by groups holding diverse political
views.
The collection includes original
documents of various governments,
printed books and newspapers, and
manuscripts. The material has been
c Mceted directly from the countries
under study, and much of it is origi
nal observation on the part of people
closely connected with events in
Russia at the time of the Revolution,
according to the director. The insti
tute maintains correspondence with
these people who are in an excellent
position to furnish accurate and
complete data.

Questioned upon Russia's posi
tion in world politics, particularly
with regard to Russia's relation to
the German drive to the east, Dr.

Fisher emphasized the difficulty of
making predictions because of con
flicting accounts of the actual situa
tion in Russia.
"Russia's industrial strength has
increased tremendously in recent
years," he commented, "and her
strength in man-power and essential
raw materials is well known."
Because of her Bolshevik govern
ment, Dr. Fisher pointed out that
Russia occupies an unusual position
in regard to alliances with the small
countries of the Danube basin.
"These nations hesitate to make
actual alliances with Russia," he
said. "It is my opinion that they
fear such alliances might furnish
Germany a convenient excuse to
continue Nazi imperialism.
"They would rather ally with
Great Britain, for this reason, com
pleting only 'understandings' with
Russia."
COMMUNIST VIEW
Asked what was the essential dif
ference between the Communist and
Fascist dictatorships, Dr. Fisher as
serted: "The chief difference be
tween Communism and Fascism, in
theory at least, is that the former is
based upon democracy. The Com
munist view is that true democracy
is impossible under a capitalist sys
tem because of the power concen
trated in the hands of the wealthy,
and that true democracy can be
realized only after social classes have
been abolished and socialism ideal
ized.
"This ideal has not been realized,
however," he concluded. "At pres
ent, a state of socialism exists in
Russia, under a party dictatorship.

this is a logical step from the capi
talist to the Communist system, and
