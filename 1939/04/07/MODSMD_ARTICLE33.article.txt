# Bunn, Lee Will Defend 3-Leg Title
## 
### 
Dean John Bumi and Beeb Lee,
those terrors in the art of tri-legged
tripping, namely the three-legged
race, last night announced that they
will defend their campus title
against all comers in a three-legged
race to be held as a part of next
Thursday's Student-Faculty day.
Last year's three-legged race,
which teamed up about 20 roughs
with the same number of the Farm's
nimblest faculty members, was won
by a jump and hop by Bunn and
Lee. This same victorious pair feel
they can again repeat last year's
sensational win, and as a result they
are willing to risk their coveted
title.
The three-legged race, however,
will be only one of the many events
that will bring together, on the
same level, Stanford students, par
ticularly the freshmen, and the
Stanford faculty members during
next Thursday's Student-Faculty
day at the intramural field. Festivi
ties have been scheduled to begin
promptly at 3 o'clock.
According to reports last night, a
change has been made in one of the
previously planned baseball games.
The football players, who will be
excused from Thursday's practice,
will be divided into two squads
and led, it is hoped, by Coaches
Thornhill and Winkelmann in a 5-
inning diamond battle.
Gene Coldiron, chairman for the
Student-Faculty Day committee,
last night requested that all sug
gestions and possible changes be
referred to him for immediate ac
tion as soon as arising.
