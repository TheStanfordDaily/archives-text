# Navy Making Radio Reserve Base Out of Old Roble Gym
## 
### 
Over in the old Roble Gym the
woodpeckers are moving out to
make room for the short-wave re
ceiving and transmitting sets of the
Stanford volunteer unit of the U.S.
Navy Communication Reserve.
The brightly painted rooms don't
look the least bit ominous. The first
thing that impresses one is the com
plicated machinery for sending and
receiving messages. Two transmit
ters are regularly employed on fre
quencies between 2500 and 4UOO kilo
cycles, one with a power of 60 watts
for the immediate vicinity of Palo
Alto and one of 300-watt power for
more important and longer distance
work.
RADIO TRANSMITTERS
A third transmitter is built for use
as a portable emergency rig with a
portable power supply consisting of
a small dynamotor and a six-volt
automobile battery. There is a re
ceiver for each transmitter, making
a complete radio circuit of each com
bination. The portable set can be
taken out and set up anywhere in
case of emergency.
Besides being a volunteer com
munication station, N6NU also trains
men for the Naval Reserve. Classes
are conducted every Tuesday and
Friday nights by Ensign John Beck
ett, graduate student in engineering.

Classes are open to the public, and
anyone may enter the class without
previous training.
When students prove that they
have learned enough about radio
communications, they may enlist in
the Naval Reserve. In case of war
these men would go immediately
into naval service, both on ships and
on land. During the summer they
have an opportunity to work in the
navy as radio chief petty officers.
STUDENT OFFICER JOBS
The Navy Reserve Air Base at
Oakland is often given to the stu
dent officers as a post for two weeks.
Longer cruises to the Orient and
Hawaii are also included in the radio
jobs. During the time operators are
working in the navy, they are paid
and provided with naval uniforms.
The course is continuous and any
one may enter at any time. The
students learn how to send and re
ceive messages with special prac
tice in reading RCA press notices
sent in Morse code. On Friday
nights the Stanford station practices
over a nation-wide hook-up of other
short-wave stations.
The Farm will have one consola
tion when threats of war in Europe
turn into reality. Lake Lagunita is
drying too quickly for use as a war
ship base, but nevertheless a unit of
the navy will be here on the campus.
