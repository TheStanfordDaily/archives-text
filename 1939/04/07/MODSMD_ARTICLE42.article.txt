# SIDELINE SLANTS

### ARCH JENKINS 
FOII SEVERAL weeks now, we
have approached the sports week
end with subdued hopes that Stan
lord would come through with a
clean sweep on our play across the j
hoard.
On every occasion, some sort of j
mild upset would ruin the grand j
slam we had cooked up. But the
average for winners in all events
has been pleasingly high, to put it
mildly.
But now the competition is get
ting rougher, and a peel: into the
musty crystal ball shows that, on
form alone, the Indians deserve one I
victory â€” and no more. The Farm
waterdogs should lick U.C.L.A. to
morrow despite the loss of Roy
Winkelmann and Captain Win i
Needham. If you are a form expert
from there on in, you'd better save
your shekels for a day at the races
when Stanford's odds are closer to j
even.
Beginning at the top and working j
down through the calendar, we can j
si e that this is a wise week-end to
keep away from the college bookies, j
Like old Malicious, the hoss who re- !
tired four times, Stanford won't get I
any wise money except from those !
who are attached to the old Quad
through sentimental connections.
Malicious took something like j
$150,000 from his sentimental but |
d imb supporters in his fading-out!
process without returning a bean. I
Stanford, on the other hand, is still i
young and full of the old college |
try. Malicious probably never got
past the second grade in grammar
school. So a bet on a long shot with j
youth and a college education might |
pay dividends at that.

IF YOU'RE anxious to buck the
f< rm book, here's what you have to
contend with. Stanford's track
team, which is going to be good
enough to win a couple of national
championships, is definitely against
the wall in their encounter with the
Olympic Club tomorrow. When old
men like Bill McCurdy, Stanford's
captain two years ago, can run half
miles in 1:53.4 after being a cog in
the business world for two years,
and Ray Dean can amble faster in
the century now than ever before,
then it's time for the youngsters to
give up and pray for better luck in
their second childhood.
And what about Humbert Smith,
a place-winner in the A.A.U. finals
If,St June, who keeps training drill
ing French adverbs to freshmen
and sophomores here on the Farm.
And Jack Weierhauser. And Bobby
Todd. And Cornelius Warmerdam.
Of course, Clyde JefTrey should
win the two flat races, Pete Zagar
should cop the discus, and Bill
Wohle and Stan Andersen ought to
go one-two in the shot. But the
Olympians can sweep the javelin
and the pole vault, make things
nughty rough in the distance races,
nnd possibly clean up in the hurdles
if Sid Hayes doesn't run.
The Olympic Club was runner-up
in the A.A.U. championship last

year, and Coach Charley Hunter j
says his old men are much better i
now than they were at their peak !
last year. Holy Cow!

MAYBE YOU would like to back
the home town boys in baseball. All
Stanford has to do on successive
days is to lick the league leaders to- I
day and the defending champions,
California, tomorrow. Sometimes
the young Indians play so well that
there doesn't seem to be a team in i
the league that can touch them.
Then they catch the jitters, like
they have three times against St.
Mary's, and fold up like a bunch of j
drowning swimmers with stomach i
cramps. With the two best pitchers'
in the league in Captain A1 Lazza
rone and Cootie Thompson, and im- I
proving chucking by both Claude
Purkitt and Bill Masters, Stanford j
can win both tilts.
The steadiness of the support be- !
hind these aces, however, will decide
the ultimate fate of what looked to I
be Stanford's most promising dia- ;
mond crew in five or six moons.

U.S.C. HAS a powerful tennis
team and is definitely favored, which
merely paves the way for an upset.
You know, everything to gain and
nothing to lose. Just like a little
man fighting a big man.
Taking a final look at one more
event, if you want to see horse
polo at its very best, drop in on the
British-Stanford matches tomorrow
afternoon and watch some real ex
perts show you how it's done. 'Tis
said they're much better than Ma
licious, if that's an incentive.
