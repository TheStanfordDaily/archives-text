## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team will be looking for its first Pacific Coast Con
ference victory of (lie season this afternoon when the Indian nctmen take
on the Troians on the varsity, courts beginning at 1:110 o'clock. Admission ;
is free.
Although in previous matches the Card team has bowed to both
U.C.L.A. and iCoach Slienn Lockvvood will be able to use his j

strongest combination today for the
first time.
Bob Low, who has been way be
low form most of the season, has
shown during the past week that he
is capable of upsetting Troy's high
ly-touted Ron Lubin, while Captain
Jim Seaver likewise at Del Monte
produced his best tennis for the first
time.
50-50 CHANCE
With these two back in shape and
Lloyd Gates and Bud Biorkman eli
gible to compete after being ineli
gible last quarter, Lockwood has at
least a 50-50 chance of scoring a
win today.
Back of Low and Seaver will be
Dave Brock, who is under-rated in
Conference play this year. Gates,
Myron Folsom, and Jack Laney
The tentative doubles line-ups are
Low - Seaver, Gates-Stan Owen
and either Brock-Folsom or Brock-
Biorkman.
Tomorrow, Stanford's varsity will
be pitted against an aggregation of
alumni, who may prove to be the
toughest team the Cards will have
to face during the entire season.
Among those expected to play for
the alumni are Bob Underwood, cap
tain of last year's team, Bob Pom
mer, Jo Coughlin, former national
intercollegiate doubles champion,
Howard Blethen, and Ben Dey, an
other former national doubles
champ.
POINTED FOR WIN
But the Indians are pointing for
today's encounter and the match with
the alumni tomorrow may come as
somewhat of an ant-climax, should
they triumph this afternoon.
Besides Lubin, the Trojans have
several veterans, including Ken
Bartlett, who played in the East last
summer, and Laurence Nelson, who
once won the national junior doubles
championship with Gene Mako, and
who has played a season of Euro
pean tournaments.
