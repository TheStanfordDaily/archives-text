# Indian Swim Teams Close Home Season Tomorrow
## 
### 
The culmination of the Stanford
swimming teams' performances on
the campus will take place tomorrow
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock when the
frosh and varsity stage a double
header, with the opposition for the
former being furnished by Stockton
Olympic Club and for the latter by
the U.C.L.A. varsity.
The varsity will be somewhat
crippled by the temporary absence
of two of it.s stars, Captain Win
Needham and Roy Winkelmann.
Needham has been sent to the rest
home with a recurrence of his flu
sickness that has kept him from
reaching his peak form all season.
CARDS EXPECT WIN
Even without these two varsity
aces it is figured that the Cards will
be able to come out on top of the
Bruins, who are reputed more or
less on the second-rate list with but
one or two men who have ever bet
tered marks made by Stanford win
ners. The Uclans' Kuehne is figured
to give Roy Vitousek a little com
petition in the sprints, but Vitousek
will probably win the breast, Wee
den the backstroke, and the two
relay teams their events.
The story is slightly different
when turning toward the frosh
events which will be run off alter
nately with the varsity in the same
pool. The Stockton Winged "O" men
are capable of furnishing the Card
frosh with some of the stiffest com
petition they have had to face dur
ing their entire season.
DIVING FEUD
One of the features of the frosh
meet will be the diving contest,
which will pit Howie Adams, the
Card frosh's Far Western A.A.U.
champ, against Johnny Hood of
Stockton. These two ace spring
board artists have met eight times
in the past with each winning four
of the contests, making this one a
toss-up.
The 200-yard breast stroke event
will furnish its share of thrilling
moments also. Scott Dudley, new
Pacific Association champ in the
100-yard race, will face Ralph

Wright, Far Western champ in the
200. Making adjustments for his
times, which have been made in
exceptionally last pools, Dudley is
given an even-up chance to come
in a hand ahead.
MILLER vs. HOOD
Gardner Miller will meet the same
Johnny Hood who does the diving
in the 50-yard free style race. Miller
will also swim the anchor lap in
the free style relay, the last event
of the day, which will in all prob
ability decide the winner of the en
tire meet.
Both meets will be held in the
Encina pools and will start at 3:30
o'clock tomorrow afternoon imme
diately after the Olympic Club track
meet. No admission will be charged
on presentation of a student body
card.
The frosh will engage San Mateo
Junior College in a dual meet this
afternoon at 4 o'clock in the Encina
Pools but it will not be open to the
general public because of conflicts
with regular gym classes going on
at the same time. Any men students
who wish may attend the meet, how
ever.
