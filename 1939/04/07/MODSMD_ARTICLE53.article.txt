# Card Varsity Nine To Meet Cal, U.S.C.
## 
### 
The Card diamond squad reaches the crucial point in its season Friday
and Saturday afternoons when they meet U.S.C. and California on the
sunken diamond.
Coach Ilarry Wolters men are in fourth place in the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Association standings with three games won and three
games lost. All three losses were to the St. Mary's Gaels.
With Wally deWitt the only senior in the starting lineup, the Reds pre
sent what is probably the youngest team on the coast. DeWitt broke into

the batting order when Norm Juney
was moved to the first-base spot
during spring vacation's practice
games. The shift has added both
strength at bat and .steadiness in the
infield.
STARTERS NAMED
Coach Wolter said yesterday that
he expected to start Adams and
Clark with deWitt in the outfield
instead of Ditlevsen and Peterson.
The infield will be made up of Ju
ney at first, Phyl at second, Bull at
third and Boone at short. This quar
tet has worked well together ior the
last several games. Lazzarone will
be the starting pitcher for the Tro
jan game with Bill Jameson doing
the catching. Cootie Thompson will
pitch the California game. Masters
and Purkitt have been working well
lately, and will be on hand for any
relief work necessary.
Sam Barry's Southern California
Trojans were leading the league
until last week, when the California
Bears handed them a sound 14-2
walloping that dropped them to sec
ond place behind the St. Mary's
team. The heavy hitting that had
carried the Trojans to the top was
effectively stopped by Audie Daugh
erty, who may pitch against the
Cards Saturday. In spite of their
lone defeat, Southern California is
still considered the strongest team
on the coast.
CHANCE TO WIN
With strong pitching and good de
fensive play, the Indians, according
to Coach Wolter, have a good chance
1o win either or both games. A fac
tor in favor of the Cards is that S.C.
will be playing the last of four games
in five days. They met Cal, St.
Mary's, and Santa Clara during the
week. They moved back into the
league lead when they won from
the Gaels Monday.
"Hooks" Devaurs and Cliff Perry,
two of California's leading hitters,
will probably not be able to play in
the first game of the big series be
cause of leg injuries. 1 hey will be
replaced by Griffith and Fenton
Rapp.
Ihe California starting pitcher
will be either sophomore Mike Koll
or Daugherty. Both games are
scheduled to start at 3:,'30 o'clock.
The value of Montana livestock
increased approximately $12,000,000
in 19:18, to a total of 878,180,000.
