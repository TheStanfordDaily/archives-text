# Track Squad Will Meet O.C.
## Invaders Underdogs In Meet Tomorrow 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock
; Stanford's cindermen will entertain
Olympic Club's "doubtful quan
! tity" track team in the first of this
year's official meets on Angell
Field. True, the Winged-O line-up
contains enough stars to give the In
dians a real battle; but these old
timers are usually not very consci
| entious about keeping their engage
; menis; and so Dink Templeton's
| charges ought to dispatch their rivals
i with little trouble.
I Though the meet officially opens at
' 2 o'clock with (he running of the
j mile, competition in the field events
! will start 15 minute? earlier.
| Kay Dean, Jack Weiershauser, and
| Bill McCurdy, all lormer Dink Tem
j pleton students, will represent the
Club in races from (ho 100-yard
| dash to the 880-yard run. In the
distances Ed Preston and Chuck
! Voorhees will match strides with
j Cardinals Girard, Emmanuel, and
I Soldate.
i The Indian hurdlers will have
their hands full for Tom Moore, ex
: Cal star, and Bev Gubser, crack
timber-topper from Fresno State,
; are expected to be on hand.
Pete Zagar will have to contend
| with Phil Levy and the squitch he
1 uses to unnerve his opponents in
the discus. Also in there pitching
j will be another former Stanford
I weightman, Gordy Dunn. In the
i shot, the Winged-O is employing
! another of the long line ol the top
i notch putters turned out by Tem
; pleton, Tom Montgomery.
By far their strongest event is the
, jt.velin, in which Ed Waterbury,
Johnny Mottram, and Lowell Todd
will probably sweep the event.
The Club jumpers will be Bob
Clark in the broad jump, John Law
and Humbert Smith in (he high
; jump, and Corny Warmerdam in
1 the pole vault.
South Africa is carrying out a
program of tree-planting to prevent
j malaria, as it is known malaria mos
j quitos breed only in nools open to
; sunlight.
