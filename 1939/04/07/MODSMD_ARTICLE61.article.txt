# Bears Lead In Four-way Golf Tourney
## 
### 
Scoring an upset in the first day
of the Four-way Tournament to de
cide the Southern Conference cham
pions, California golfers led the
team championship on the Stanford
course yesterday after two rounds
of medal play.
The Trojans from U.S.C., who
were supposed to lead the meet,
were in second place, followed by
Stanford, third, and U.C.L.A., fourth.
However, because of the large num
ber of tied scores, play-offs must be
held on the five lower-ranking men.
Leonard Thrasher of Cal shot the
lowest score for the 36-hole grind,
making 144. U.S.C. came next with
Trojans Rennie Kelley doing 14!) and
Bill Ransom, 150.
Stanford's Warren Berl and Don
Haslett tied for fourth place, both
shooting 151. Jack Lonegrin of Cal
was next with 151 and the Bears'
highly-touted ace, Willard McCay,
10l lowed with 154. Bud Finger of
Stanford also shot 154. Remaining
medalists were Walt Myers, Cal, 154;
John Gray, S.C., 156; Chuck Nagle,
S.C., 156. U.C.L.A. was completely
eliminated.
Today the divotmen will play the
quarter-finals and semi-finals of one
round each. Tomorrow the two top
men will shoot 36 holes to decide
the individual championship.
Coconut Grove, Fla., was settled
long before Miami, of which it is
now a suburb.
