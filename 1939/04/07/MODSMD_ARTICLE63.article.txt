APPLICATIONS for positions on the Conva
lescent Home Drive will be received to
day.
Out of the last few muddled days, the follow
ing is now significant in the light of the political
backwash which surrounded original Cardinal
appointments;
Originally, applications for drive positions
were received over an initial period of three
days. When sign-ups were completed, ratio of
Row and Hall applications was 5 to 1.
When appointments were announced, that
ratio was reduced to 4 to 1. So it seems that the
situation was not quite as bad as imagined.
When Cardinal heads appear before Ex Com
mittee next Tuesday night, the still held-up ap
pointment list will no doubt be approved. And
before that approval, there is still time for names
to be added to the list.
In other words, if the Hall men and women
are as interested in working on the Convales
cent Home Drive as the recent fuss would in
dicate, now is their chance to put up or shut up.
Naturally, any appointments following to
morrow's extended sign-up period won't be to
the top jobs—Cardinals still feels it has made
the best choices. But the organization has made
another effort to enlist workers.
Despite the long-existing fight over whether
or not Cardinals is a self-perpetuating body and
should remain such, it's nearly time that the
bickering over who does what stopped. These
are two different questions, and if everybody
wants to fight over the former, it should be done
-—but after the drive, not before. Because if the
present difficulty isn't ironed out, the Drive will
be a complete flop.
If the bickering does stop, there's a good
chance that Stanford's one remaining pet charity
will be a success.
Which, after all, is the immediate point at
stake.
