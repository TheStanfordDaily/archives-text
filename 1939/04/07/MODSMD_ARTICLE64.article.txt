# The 						Sun Also Rises

### 
AS the first oblique rays of the sun hit Stan
ford on Sunday morning, trumpets will
greet the dawn of Easter in the Frost Memorial
Amphitheater. There students and friends of
the University will be gathered to observe the
day in an appropriately beautiful setting.
At this first Easter sunrise service, the presi
dent of the Associated Students will speak
and the president of the Y.W.C.A. will read a
prayer. It will be a ceremony designed pri
marily for students.
At the same time, the grassy slopes of the
Amphitheater will easily accommodate hun
dreds of outsiders, and it is certain that a serv
ice of this kind, with such a beautiful back
ground, will attract a great deal of interest from
one end of the Peninsula to the other. It will
serve as an instrument of good will between
Stanford and the citizenry of its environs.
Moreover, the sunrise service probably will
become a tradition on the Farm, something that
will make Stanford mean a little bit more in the
lives of its students. It will provide an annual
use for the Amphitheater, which now stands
often vacant between commencements.
Events of this kind are a good means of
strengthening the ties of the Stanford family,
of making appropriate use of its facilities.—L. L.
