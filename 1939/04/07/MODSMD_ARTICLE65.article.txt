STANFORD sees this week-end what will
probably be the last of the Sunday night
movie series.
A year ago, when the series was proposed to
meet demand for pictures in Memorial Hall on
Sundays, there was much enthusiasmâ€”here
was a chance to really promote a worth-while
project: entertainment at low cost.
Unfortunately, Stanford soon found out that
Hollywood felt differently; that the movie capi
tal's best was not to be shown for 20 cents, even
though the audience was well on its way to
being educated.
As a second-best substitute, this year, ar
rangements were made for foreign films. And
now, when the series is beginning to line up
brand-new importations from England, the
show's practically over.

Ever since the first one was put on this year,
audiences have averaged only 200 to 300 per
sons; the A.S.S.U. has been dropping approxi
mately $30 on each showing.
Professors and their wives, particularly those
of the language departments, have received the
most benefit from the films; the A.S.S.U. can
not, and should not, continue to spend money
if it is not for a larger group than that.
Principal reason that this is not a success
story is that Stanford is "not interested; the
students just wouldn't make the effort to sup
port them."
The only person who has been willing to
support them continuously has been Coline Up
shaw, who has done a super job of meeting
difficulties with tremendous effort. And the re
sults of her activity have been excellent in the
face of those difficulties.
And so it seems that Sunday, when the best
picture of the bunch is over, the whole thing
is probably through.
With the best wishes of Hollywood and the
Peninsula theaters. Evidently, Stanford too.
