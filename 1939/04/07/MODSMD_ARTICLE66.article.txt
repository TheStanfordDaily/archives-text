MAN TIIE LIFEBOATS
A LL of us got <> nasty shock yesterday when experts
announced that ihey would give the Lake just
two weeks to live. The evil tidings spread over the
campus like rumors of a great catastrophe, and voices
that had wisecracked at the Munich crisis cursed with
a feeling rarely demonstrated outside the dramatics
department.
Ordinarily I would not indulge in morbid brooding
over the tragedy. Under the circumstances .there is
not much we can do to keep Lagunita from drying up.
And while I believe in freedom of the press and all
that., I have no intention of starting a quarrel with
God over the way he manages his weather. Ordinary
Campus Opinion letters are bad enough without get
ting any of them handwritten on the wall.

Dut I don't believe that some of the students realize
what it means to have Lagunita run out on us in the
middle of spring quarter like a capricious girl. One
of my friends suggested yesterday morning that with
history being made all around me I ought to be asham
ed to waste my time bothering about an overgrown
mud puddle. One or two others said nastily that it was
the first time they had ever heard of a newspaperman
worrying about water; but that is beside the point.
Those who take the tragedy lightly don't realize
that spring quarter life at, Stanford is built around
the Lake. They don't foresee the blight that will de
scend upon our future if Lagunita dries up before
June.
* s!« i!« *
fN the first place the Junior Water Carnival will
evaporate with the lake. Even an educated imagina
tion can't stand up to a water frolic against a back
ground that would, harmonize only with the pyramids.
And if we lose the water carnival, we lose one of our
few painless ways of arousing enthusiasm on the
campus.
The noise of tin cups rattling has already reached
a crescendo, and the campus is not likely to go jitter
bug over an addition to the racket. Without the water
carnival, the Convalescent Home Drive gets a starting
position behind the eight ball.
The loss of the carnival is just the beginning of the
trouble. Spring quarter is traditionally the time for
Romance, and the lake is traditionally the machinery
which welds the young hearts. Statistics show that
Romance on the campus varies directly with the water
level gauge on the lake. (We have no statistics, but
the phrase is impressive, and besides if there are no
statistics, they can't be contradicted.)
* >i« * #
Probably the University feels that, it can get along
very nicely without Romance; but that is a short
sighted view. If the Chapel bells don't ring, there will
be no next generation, at least not one with the back
ground Stanford requires. And if there is no next
generation, there can be no University.
Munich was a mere penny ante poker game. This
is stark realism.

the first time they had ever heard of a newspaperman
worrying about water; but that is beside the point.
Those who take the tragedy lightly don't realize
that spring quarter life at, Stanford is built around
the Lake. They don't foresee the blight that will de
scend upon our future if Lagunita dries up before

fN the first place the Junior Water Carnival will
evaporate with the lake. Even an educated imagina
tion can't stand up to a water frolic against a back
ground that would, harmonize only with the pyramids.
And if we lose the water carnival, we lose one of our
few painless ways of arousing enthusiasm on the
campus.
The noise of tin cups rattling has already reached
a crescendo, and the campus is not likely to go jitter
bug over an addition to the racket. Without the water
carnival, the Convalescent Home Drive gets a starting
position behind the eight ball.
The loss of the carnival is just the beginning of the
trouble. Spring quarter is traditionally the time for
Romance, and the lake is traditionally the machinery
which welds the young hearts. Statistics show that
Romance on the campus varies directly with the water
level gauge on the lake. (We have no statistics, but
the phrase is impressive, and besides if there are no
statistics, they can't be contradicted.)

Probably the University feels that, it can get along
very nicely without Romance; but that is a short
sighted view. If the Chapel bells don't ring, there will
be no next generation, at least not one with the back
ground Stanford requires. And if there is no next
generation, there can be no University.
Munich was a mere penny ante poker game. This
is stark realism.

A LL of us got <> nasty shock yesterday when experts
announced that ihey would give the Lake just
two weeks to live. The evil tidings spread over the
campus like rumors of a great catastrophe, and voices
that had wisecracked at the Munich crisis cursed with
a feeling rarely demonstrated outside the dramatics
department.
Ordinarily I would not indulge in morbid brooding
over the tragedy. Under the circumstances .there is
not much we can do to keep Lagunita from drying up.
And while I believe in freedom of the press and all
that., I have no intention of starting a quarrel with
God over the way he manages his weather. Ordinary
Campus Opinion letters are bad enough without get
ting any of them handwritten on the wall.
