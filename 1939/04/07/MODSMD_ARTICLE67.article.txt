This is the time of the year, let me tell you. The
man ;it. (lie typewriter to my right has his shoes off
and is whistling like mad.
Eight o'clock classes are crowded, and it's good to
spend an hour after they are over watching the Stan
ford women go by. The metamorphosis that they go
through every spring vacation is a remarkable thing to
see. The difference in them the last week of winter
quarter and the first week of spring quarter!
The spirit of spring and the metamorphosis is re
markably infectious. Soon it will have the whole sehooj
doing things equally ridiculous and more sublime than
taking its shoes off and whistling like mad.
I know what the guy meant yesterday. I heard
him on the Quad say to whomever he was with, "My
God. it's even good to talk to her."

You know how il is when you go into a barber
shop. You ask for a hair-cut, and you get it. You
want enough taken off so you won't have to be in
again too soon to pay another 65 cents.
Yet sometimes you have a date thai night, and you
don't want to look absolutely sheared. Like the guy
in the suit, you want to look smooth.
One of our Farm boys found the solution to that
problem of just how much you should get cut. He
made a deal with Ihc barber: the barber would cut
half of what he wanted oIT on that day, the guy would
come back the next day to get the rest of his hair
cut.
That guy will be a success some day.

For a small fee, one of our Row boys cuts lawns
for a little money on the side, or perhaps for a lot of
money, tl makes no difference. Not to us at least.
But while he is at work any number of people
drive up and ask him where is the flow or where is
Hoover's house, and so forth.
He gets just a little tired of telling them where to
go. And I don't mean what you think at all.
So he very carefully made a bunch of maps one
day showing where everything is.
Now wheti someone drives up to him while he is
working, he vhips ou( one of his maps before anyone
has ;Â» ehunce to say anything.
Hi' says it saVC's a lot of time.
