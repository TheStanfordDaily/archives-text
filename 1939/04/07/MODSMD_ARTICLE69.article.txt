HONOII COM!!
The Editor, Sir:
in view of the subject of Cobbsy
\Vobbsy's hist couple of Dull Ses
sions—the honor code —it is inter
esting—if not actually significant—to i
note the amazing inaccuracy with
which he reports his' quarters meet
ing between studr-Ms and faculty to '<
| discuss the code.
J know. Cobbsy, old man, it is a ,
i little unpleasant to recall things ac
euiait!;,' when they don't quite tit
| ii to your plersant little philoso
| phies, but for the sake of appear
» nee, may 1 subtest a few ruthei
! i.rprrtunt facts which will bear on
! your mental meanderings.
Fii?t, if you will recall, it. was not i
the professors who called the meet- i
!•>;» or did the tampering as you;
imply, but the combined Men's and I
Women s Council.-. It seemed, for
the most part, thai the professors
Wv re .somewhat innocent if interested j
bystanders, ringed in for the occa
sion. It was nd the professors who,
I were attempting to "remodel the ;
| machinery according to their own j
s peeri Mentions."
In fact, they seemed quite content ■
With the system as it. is. The open
ing professorial •..-.>inment, by a gen- J
! tleman from the mathematics de- j
partment, was that the system was j
! working exce'lontly, a sentimenl im- j
; mediately seconded by the> other j
! faculty members. Or don't you re- ;
member? You d.d seem a little out
of ihings in your corner.
About mid-way through the dis- !

c.ission, another professor remarked
thai, to his way of thinking, such a
discussion group was rather unnec
essary, that it \vn c overworking a
good thing. Agi in this sentiment
wa. e. hoed. Out it was the student
members who felt that something
should be done.
Nor did the professors tell "us"
that students must be forced to re
port suspected violations. They
were interested in the methods of
reporting and Council work, but no
more. Indeed, the most emphatic
faculty member of the' group main
tained stoutly that students should
not be forced in any way to report
violations. He called such a system
a "Tattle-tale code." True, he
backed his ground a shade a little
later. But you see my point.
Particularly, the gentlemen of the
faculty were unanimously against
the proposal the students threw in
for discussion of asking that exam
ination-takers also pledge that no
one was seen giving or receiving un
permitted aid. In other words, the
professors seem to be quite solidly
interested in maintaining, not xx*-
moving or changing the code.
Come, come Cobbsy. The discus
sion was about the honor code. In
reporting it, let's play ball with the
code. Of course, I'm not your keep
er. The execution of the code is left
to the individual, you say. And
those who, individually, can't be
honorable are, you once said, "the
stinking one per cent."
Your honor, Cobbsy?

With the system as it. is. The open
ing professorial •..-.>inment, by a gen- J

; mediately seconded by the> other j
! faculty members. Or don't you re- ;
member? You d.d seem a little out
of ihings in your corner.
About mid-way through the dis- !

c.ission, another professor remarked
thai, to his way of thinking, such a
discussion group was rather unnec
essary, that it \vn c overworking a
good thing. Agi in this sentiment
wa. e. hoed. Out it was the student
members who felt that something
should be done.
Nor did the professors tell "us"
that students must be forced to re
port suspected violations. They
were interested in the methods of
reporting and Council work, but no
more. Indeed, the most emphatic
faculty member of the' group main
tained stoutly that students should
not be forced in any way to report
violations. He called such a system
a "Tattle-tale code." True, he
backed his ground a shade a little
later. But you see my point.
Particularly, the gentlemen of the
faculty were unanimously against
the proposal the students threw in
for discussion of asking that exam
ination-takers also pledge that no
one was seen giving or receiving un
permitted aid. In other words, the
professors seem to be quite solidly
interested in maintaining, not xx*-
moving or changing the code.
Come, come Cobbsy. The discus
sion was about the honor code. In
reporting it, let's play ball with the
code. Of course, I'm not your keep
er. The execution of the code is left
to the individual, you say. And
those who, individually, can't be
honorable are, you once said, "the
stinking one per cent."
Your honor, Cobbsy?
