And why has Chamberlain's
policy changed? Certainly it is
not because he has felt himself
impelled to protect the democra
cies of Europe from the menace
of totalitarianism. Such idealistic
talk is sheer nonsense in 19.'}!).
England decided that it was time
to stop Hitler when she found that
her own interests were in danger,
when the fear of an all-powerful
Reich became acute.
In these past few days, with Mus
solini's Albanian coup treading on
the heels of the destruction of
Czechoslovakia, the conservative
British shop-keepers have decided
that it is time to get ready for war.
War—lest her empire is attacked, her
commercial supremacy destroyed.
Y r ESTER DAY, fearing that II Duce
will advance from Albania to
the .strategic Greek island of Corfu,
Mr. Chamberlain's government has
sent between eight and twelve
cruisers to that part of the Mediter
ranean. Corfu is the logical spot for
Mussolini to strike; it guards the
entrance to the Adriatic Sea and is
only two miles off the coast of Al
bania.
At the same time anti-aircraft
guns were manned and gas-masks
were distributed at the British
colony of Malta. A special ses
sion of Parliament has been railed
for Thursday to consider a pledge
to protect Greece in case of Ital
ian invasion.
But why all these military prepa
rations? We cynics know that Eng
land doesn't give a damn about
Greek independence — that is, she
doesn't except where her own inter
ests are concerned. But in this case
they are.
The road to the British colonies in
India and the Near East lies through
the Mediterranean and the Suez Ca
nal; a strong Italian hold on the
Aegean Islands easily could cut this
lifeline. The empire must be protect
ed at any cost.
WTILL. it is apparent that Mr.
' Chamberlain will make no direct
move against Italy until he is cer
tain that his country's interests will
suffer. He lost the valuable services
of Anthony Eden as Foreign Secre
tary because he wanted to avoid in
stilling Mussolini, and it will take
more than an Italian invasion of Al
bania to make him foreswear last
year's alliance with the Fascist state.
Became he fears that II Duce
ma\ attempt to seize Salonika, the
British Prime Minister has in
formed Italy's diplomatic repre
sentatives to keep their hands off
Greece. But at the same time he
is soft-pedalling all rough talk in
the hope that England's rights will
lie respected and that he will he
able to avoid war.
In Rome yesterday orders for the
mobilizing of additional troops
brought Italy's armed force up to
nearly 1.000.000 men, a formidable
number to say the least. Anyone
who fought the Italians in the last.
World War will tell you that they
make poor soldiers. They were shot
in the back too often to. make a
good impression.
But the danger that lies in Italy
today involves the location of Mus
solini's troops, rather than their
numbers or lighting ability. From
the Spanish peninsula all the way
across the Mediterranean to Italian
posse:sisons in the eastern Aegean,
Fascist soldiers stand ready to fight.
Ever\ strategic point on the
great inland sea could be a start
ing point for a Fascist attack —
Spain. Italy. Albania, Lybia, the
Dodecanese Islands, and controlled
ports in Asia Minor. II Duce is set
to strike whenever lie sees fit.

own interests.
The intrinsic truth of this char
acterization is beginning to show it
self as the cavalcade of European
events passes by us, down the road
to war. Munich, and the months
that followed, found Britain cam
paigning for peace at any price. The
/lame of appeasement flickered and
finally was snuffed out by the
German .seizure of Czechoslovakia.

And why has Chamberlain's
policy changed? Certainly it is
not because he has felt himself
impelled to protect the democra
cies of Europe from the menace
of totalitarianism. Such idealistic
talk is sheer nonsense in 19.'}!).
England decided that it was time
to stop Hitler when she found that
her own interests were in danger,
when the fear of an all-powerful
Reich became acute.
In these past few days, with Mus
solini's Albanian coup treading on
the heels of the destruction of
Czechoslovakia, the conservative
British shop-keepers have decided
that it is time to get ready for war.
War—lest her empire is attacked, her
commercial supremacy destroyed.
Y r ESTER DAY, fearing that II Duce
will advance from Albania to
the .strategic Greek island of Corfu,
Mr. Chamberlain's government has
sent between eight and twelve
cruisers to that part of the Mediter
ranean. Corfu is the logical spot for
Mussolini to strike; it guards the
entrance to the Adriatic Sea and is
only two miles off the coast of Al
bania.
At the same time anti-aircraft
guns were manned and gas-masks
were distributed at the British
colony of Malta. A special ses
sion of Parliament has been railed
for Thursday to consider a pledge
to protect Greece in case of Ital
ian invasion.
But why all these military prepa
rations? We cynics know that Eng
land doesn't give a damn about
Greek independence — that is, she
doesn't except where her own inter
ests are concerned. But in this case
they are.
The road to the British colonies in
India and the Near East lies through
the Mediterranean and the Suez Ca
nal; a strong Italian hold on the
Aegean Islands easily could cut this
lifeline. The empire must be protect
ed at any cost.
WTILL. it is apparent that Mr.
' Chamberlain will make no direct
move against Italy until he is cer
tain that his country's interests will
suffer. He lost the valuable services
of Anthony Eden as Foreign Secre
tary because he wanted to avoid in
stilling Mussolini, and it will take
more than an Italian invasion of Al
bania to make him foreswear last
year's alliance with the Fascist state.
Became he fears that II Duce
ma\ attempt to seize Salonika, the
British Prime Minister has in
formed Italy's diplomatic repre
sentatives to keep their hands off
Greece. But at the same time he
is soft-pedalling all rough talk in
the hope that England's rights will
lie respected and that he will he
able to avoid war.
In Rome yesterday orders for the
mobilizing of additional troops
brought Italy's armed force up to
nearly 1.000.000 men, a formidable
number to say the least. Anyone
who fought the Italians in the last.
World War will tell you that they
make poor soldiers. They were shot
in the back too often to. make a
good impression.
But the danger that lies in Italy
today involves the location of Mus
solini's troops, rather than their
numbers or lighting ability. From
the Spanish peninsula all the way
across the Mediterranean to Italian
posse:sisons in the eastern Aegean,
Fascist soldiers stand ready to fight.
Ever\ strategic point on the
great inland sea could be a start
ing point for a Fascist attack —
Spain. Italy. Albania, Lybia, the
Dodecanese Islands, and controlled
ports in Asia Minor. II Duce is set
to strike whenever lie sees fit.
