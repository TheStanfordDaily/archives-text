### HARRY PRESS 
BULLETIN

Official How caucus, which lip to 11:30 o'clock last night
was scheduled definitely for the Fiji house at 7:30 tonight,

12:30 th's morning when a caucus was called at the identical
time for the Theta Chi house, to be chairmanned by Harry
Fair.

Psychologists to tin- core, Interelub Council last night used to full ad
! vantage the power of suggestion to steamroller their slate, headed by
i Andy Stojkovich. through to approval in the official Hall caucus.
First official Row caucus, it was announced late last night, will In
; held tonight at 7:.'!() o'clock in the Fiji house, chairmanned by Deane

Johnson.
The Hall ticket, including three
El Torus out of the 12 offices, brought
back to old A.S.S.U. politico* fond
memories of the former potent Torn
machine, long non-existent..
Approximately 150 men from the
various halls heard Chairman Jolm
Porter present Iho slate. He re
ceived no reply to his pleadings for
additional nominations, the only In
terruptions heing half-hearted ap
plause as the Council's recom
mendations were introduced.
One exception to the smooth
chug-chug of the railroad occurred
through the fault of the Council U>
come to agreement on a suggestion
for junior class president.
For this position, Sherm Mellin
kofT, El Tigre, easily outdistanced
Charles Pyatt, El Toro. Ed Hovard,
Sequoia, declined his nomination.
"Hie official slate:
A.S.S.U. president: Andy Stojko
vich (El Toro).
Graduate man, Ex Committee:
Bill Rapp (El Toro).

Presentation of candidates for
A.S.S.U. positions will be made
at an all-University assembly
Thursday morning from 8:45 to
0:30 o'clock. Failure of candidates
to appear will constitute auto
matic declination, according to an
nouncement alst night by 11. R.

In (he meantime, (he How .split,
cracked open Sunday by Gene
Cold iron, appeared to be widening
into a chasm.
The Upper How, backing Ken
Cuthbertson, spent several mad
house hours yesterday in a futile
effort to promote an all-How cau
cus, in an effort to drop Madame
Guillotine on Coldiron.
Such a caucus would be fatal to
Coldiron, who has no machine to
support him, and does not want. one.
He is running on an "independent,"
eliminate - all - caucuses platform,
and, as a result, has no concerted
organization behind him.
However, he does have a great
many houses, all desirous of killing
the Upper-Lower Row split, ready
to back him. Those close to the dope
bucket maintain that Coldiron, if he
does not get, the Row nomination,
will run any\Vay, picking up back
ing wherever he can get it.
Unconfirmed rumor last night in
si.sted that Sequoia and one un
earned eating club were ready to
back him. Those houses, mostly
Lower Row, who are supporting
Coldiron, have agreed to support
no caucuses.
Both Bob Moulton, who, support
erts say, doesn't want the nomina
tion, but will run if his house (Zete)
wants him to, and Cuthbertson have
planned to present themselves at
the Row caucus tonight.
COUNCIL PRESIDENT
Corroboration of the above Moul
ton information has turned up with
the rumor that he is pointing for the
Interfurternity Council president
spot.
In addition to their frantic at
tempts to persuade Coldiron to drop
out of the running, or aim at an
other job, the Upper Row politicos
are tearing their hair over a griev
ous tongue-slip uttered by one of
their boys.
ROW INTRIGUE
Sunday night, a heretofore com
peltely reliable informer tipped o.ver
the dope bucket to let slip out the
information of a pact between Cuth
bertson and Bob Richardson, in
which both agreed to support each
Other.
Yesterday, both of these gentle
men vehemently denied any such
pact, as did all of Cuthbertson's
brothers. This interdepartmental in
efficiency almost ruined the Upper
Row's chances of getting control over
the independent houses which are
supporting Coldiron.

into a chasm.
The Upper How, backing Ken
Cuthbertson, spent several mad
house hours yesterday in a futile
effort to promote an all-How cau
cus, in an effort to drop Madame
Guillotine on Coldiron.
Such a caucus would be fatal to
Coldiron, who has no machine to
support him, and does not want. one.
He is running on an "independent,"
eliminate - all - caucuses platform,
and, as a result, has no concerted
organization behind him.
However, he does have a great
many houses, all desirous of killing
the Upper-Lower Row split, ready
to back him. Those close to the dope
bucket maintain that Coldiron, if he
does not get, the Row nomination,
will run any\Vay, picking up back
ing wherever he can get it.
Unconfirmed rumor last night in
si.sted that Sequoia and one un
earned eating club were ready to
back him. Those houses, mostly
Lower Row, who are supporting
Coldiron, have agreed to support
no caucuses.
Both Bob Moulton, who, support
erts say, doesn't want the nomina

wants him to, and Cuthbertson have
planned to present themselves at
the Row caucus tonight.

Corroboration of the above Moul
ton information has turned up with
the rumor that he is pointing for the
Interfurternity Council president
spot.
In addition to their frantic at

out of the running, or aim at an

ROW INTRIGUE
Sunday night, a heretofore com

the dope bucket to let slip out the
information of a pact between Cuth
bertson and Bob Richardson, in
which both agreed to support each
Other.
Yesterday, both of these gentle
men vehemently denied any such
pact, as did all of Cuthbertson's
brothers. This interdepartmental in
efficiency almost ruined the Upper

the independent houses which are
supporting Coldiron.

In (he meantime, (he How .split,
cracked open Sunday by Gene
Cold iron, appeared to be widening
into a chasm.
The Upper How, backing Ken
Cuthbertson, spent several mad
house hours yesterday in a futile
effort to promote an all-How cau
cus, in an effort to drop Madame
Guillotine on Coldiron.
Such a caucus would be fatal to
Coldiron, who has no machine to
support him, and does not want. one.
He is running on an "independent,"
eliminate - all - caucuses platform,
and, as a result, has no concerted
organization behind him.
However, he does have a great
many houses, all desirous of killing
the Upper-Lower Row split, ready
to back him. Those close to the dope
bucket maintain that Coldiron, if he
does not get, the Row nomination,
will run any\Vay, picking up back
ing wherever he can get it.
Unconfirmed rumor last night in
si.sted that Sequoia and one un
earned eating club were ready to
back him. Those houses, mostly
Lower Row, who are supporting
Coldiron, have agreed to support
no caucuses.
Both Bob Moulton, who, support
erts say, doesn't want the nomina
tion, but will run if his house (Zete)
wants him to, and Cuthbertson have
planned to present themselves at
the Row caucus tonight.
COUNCIL PRESIDENT
Corroboration of the above Moul
ton information has turned up with
the rumor that he is pointing for the
Interfurternity Council president
spot.
In addition to their frantic at
tempts to persuade Coldiron to drop
out of the running, or aim at an
other job, the Upper Row politicos
are tearing their hair over a griev
ous tongue-slip uttered by one of
their boys.
ROW INTRIGUE
Sunday night, a heretofore com
peltely reliable informer tipped o.ver
the dope bucket to let slip out the
information of a pact between Cuth
bertson and Bob Richardson, in
which both agreed to support each
Other.
Yesterday, both of these gentle
men vehemently denied any such
pact, as did all of Cuthbertson's
brothers. This interdepartmental in
efficiency almost ruined the Upper
Row's chances of getting control over
the independent houses which are
supporting Coldiron.
