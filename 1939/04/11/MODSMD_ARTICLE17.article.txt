Since the publication of his auto
biography in 1935, the former corre
spondent for tn* Chicago Daily News
has been widely acclaimed ior his
accurate and enlightened coverage
of world events. From his start in
the early 20's when he startled the
newspaper world with the "inside"
of the revolt of the Riffs against
Spain, he followed the develop
ments of the League of Nations, Ger
many's retaking of the Rhineland,
and the crisis in Ethiopia.
More recently Mr. Sheean, whose
home is in England, witnessed Hit
ler's triumphal march into the
Czech-Slovak state. Prior to the Nazi
invasion of the European republic,
he denounced the German claims in
the area in a broadcast to the Con
tinent and the United States, which
was widely acclaimed by critics in
this country and abroad.
In his address Thursday evening,
the well known commentator will
review the developments in the
struggle between Democracy and
Fascism, and summarize the com
plex series of events that have taken
place in the last few years.
Tickets are now on sale in the
