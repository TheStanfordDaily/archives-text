# Prize Offered For 'War' Essay
## 
### 
With a $5 merchandise order at j
the Bookstore as inducement, Farm j
essayists may this week try their I
skill at the subject of "War at Stan
ford," according to Kathleen Norris j
and Dwight Hutchinson, co-chair- j
men of Peace Council's second an- j
nual essay contest.
Two faculty members and one j
student will judge the 300-word pa-,
pers, which may be submitted before j
Monday noon, April 17, at the A. S. !
S. U. office.
Originality and cleverness in j
painting the effects of United j
States' declaration of war on Stan- j
ford is sought, Peace Council indi- j
cated. Informality and imagination j
should keynote the writing and little j
attention will be given to gram- j
matical perfection.
