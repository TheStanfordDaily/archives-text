Stanford need offer no excuse for
being tied by a track team as power
tul as that of the Olympic Club. The
Winged-O's should go to national
championships in A.A.U. competi
tion unless Stanford enters full
teams in the late spring and sum
mer competitions.
WIIAT IS most gratifying about
the first Indian home track appear
ance is the way in which Dink Tem
pleton's charges put forth their best
efforts in every event. That is per
haps the most important item in
Dink's coaching character. While;
other mentors spend their time de
veloping morale and tiying to in
veigle performances out of their j
men, Templeton goes on year after i
year with never a dissent in the!
ranks. He's the boss and there isn't ■
a man on his squad who wouldn't go i
through all sorts of hell and high \
water for him. That's coaching at |
its finest.
Look at Dink's potentially great j
distance man, Paul Moore. Maybe |
you watched Moore try to get going j
last Saturday, but you probably |
didn't know the story back of his ;
efforts. He picked up a leg infec- !
lion a couple of months ago and had j
to take a lay-off which voided all i
the intensive training he had under- :
gone. He and Marston Girard were 1
playing tag in 4:20 miles last fall be- j
fore the infection set in,
Now Moore's back in suit, doing 1
his utmost to reach that peak again !
before the Califorina and U.S.C. ■
meets. If he does, he is capable of j
beating not only Girard but also i
Cecil Cole of the Bears. And he can j
press Zamperini, though there isn't!
a collegiate runner in the United
States to match the flashy Trojanl
ace when he makes up his mind to
run.
Girard and Zamperini, incidental- j
ly, came within a shade of a second;
of running identical third laps in ;
different meets. Girard's last turn j
was a 66-second effort, while Zam- |
perini turned on the heat with a 61- j
second finale to easily overtake Cole< !
the supposed Bear invincible.
Girard had no one to chase him !
in that fourth lap, yet he came up j
with a 4:20.4 race. If he, and per
haps Moore too, doesn't beat Cole,!
we miss our guess again.
Clyde Jeffrey needs no further j
praise from this sector. He may be !
the man to run that 9:00 hundred if |
he keeps improving. And you have \
to credit little Ray Dean, the Olym- i
pic and ex-Stanford star, for mak- '
ing Jeff step on it to beat him in i
their races night after night.

Then there was Templeton's ever- |
present flock of super weight men.;
Poor old Hampton Pool threw the j
discus farther than he had ever i
thrown it before—l 49 feet—yet he
could do no better than fourth!
against three of Stanford's stand
outs. Phil Levy Fox, Slinger Dunn,
Pete Zagar, and Pool, probably the
best four ever to compete under one
coach.
And in the shot, Bill Wohle and j
Stan Andersen continued their duel j
with both going over 52 feet. Bill I
Braheny, who came to Dink as a I
150-foot man in the javelin, reached '
200 feet, and the hurdlers, Bill i
Hawkins and Stan Hiserman, came
precariously close to their best j
marks.
Stanford could have won with '
Russ Wulff high-jumping and Sid (
Hayes hurdling, but that's another ;
story because the Olympians could ]
have won, too, if a couple of ex-In- j
dians, Ray Malott and Tiger Alex- :
andc-r had been able to make an |
appearance.

FOR THE third or fourth or fifth
time, the intramural track meet has;
been postponed again. Maybe they !
will hold it in conjunction with sen- j
ior week next June.
The postponement is perfectly all :
l ight, but our hearts are out to the j
poor blokes who started training'
way last January and swore off such '
delicacies as cigarettes and loaded
coca-colas. It doesn't seem like 1
cricket to keep a fellow on thej
straight and narrow so long when
he must certainly long to be down 1
in the rut which most of us never I
left in the first place.
