# Card Trackmen Improving; Set For Huskies
## Cindersquad Remains As Only Match For Mighty Trojans 
### 
With the rapid recuperation of
injured stars and the steady im
provement of all members, Stan
lord's track team is definitely com
ing and can now be classed as the
only team that has a chance of
beating the mighty Trojan. But
U.S.C. is a long way off and Dink
Templeton's crew is now preparing
for Washington, which will invade
Angell field Saturday.
Sid Hayes, sophomore hurdler
who pulled a muscle .slightly prac
ticing starts a week ago, showed up
for practice last evening. Sid took
several flights of highs under half
steam without being bothered in the
least by the injured leg.
The other ailing cinderman, Russ
Wullf, victim of a sprained ankle, is
still taking it easy but will prob
ably jump Saturday. If his jump
in team-mate, Jim Lincoln, contin
ues at his present rate, Templeton
need not worry about points in. this
event.
TEN IMPROVE MARKS
A grand total of ten men improved
their marks in competition for this
year in the meet with Olympic Club
last Saturday. The most outstand
ing progress was made in the javelin l '
where Bill Braheny upped his
former record to .200 feet. His team
mate, Karl Thursby, kept pace with
Bill, improving seven feet over his
previous record. His new distance
is 188.
Bill Wohle's toss of 52 feet G inches
in the shot was nearly a foot bet
ter than his best in competition so
far this year. To uphold improve
ment in the weight events, Pete
Zagar and Hamp Pool each improved
their former bests for the year by
one foot in the discus. Big Pete
reached 163 and Pool missed the
150-foot mark by a scant three
inches.
440 MAN BETTER
In the middle distances, Ernie
Clark shaded 49 seconds while tak
ing a second place in the quarter
behind Bill McCurdy, and "Mushy"
Girard was caught in 1:54 flat, run
ning in the same position in the
half. Both these marks are definite
improvements.
Little A1 Soldate, the plugger on
the team, ran his best two-mile
against the Clubmen. A1 ground
out a 9:54 and Dink expects him to
better this mark. Though their per
formances can only be approximat
ed, Bill Hawkins and Stan Hiser
man ran their best races of the year
last Saturday despite the fact that
each chased Tom Moore into the
tape.
Wednesday, Coach Templeton will
hold another twilight meet at 5:30
o'clock, giving the fans another
taste of this informal yet brilliant
cinder competition.
