## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Frosh Mermen to Tune Up In Menlo Meet Today 
### 
As a tulier-upper for the turning Big Meet. Stanford's spectacular frosh
swim team will meet Menlo J.C. at 4 o'clock this afternoon at the Enema
Pools. The meet will be open to men only, in order to create no conflict
with (lie men's gym classes.
Coach Nort Thornton will probably swim his stars, Ilerron, Miller,
and Dudley in only one race apiece so as to give other less prominent men

a chance to swim in an official meet.
Those who have not been given
much of a chance to swim in pre
vious meels are Duncan Patty and
Fred Seeback, middle distance men;
Bob Reynolds, sprints, Had Bacon,
backstroke; and Fred Man waring,
breaststroke.
Captain Paul Herron, chief rec
ord-breaker, will make an attempt
to bring back the 220 free-style Na
tional Collegiate freshman record to
the Farm. This is the only 20-yard
pool mark which the frosh need to
regain from Yale to hold every rec
ord in this division.
Another of Coach Nort Thorn
ton's experiments today will use for
its raw material, Scott Dudley, ace
breaststroker. Dudley will attempt
to swim the full 200-yard race, or as
much of it as he can, at full speed
butterfly stroke. Nort expects a
probable record time from this al
most unheard-of feat.
The varsity will spend its entire
week without a meet but in stiff
training for their meet with ' the
Bears on Saturday.
