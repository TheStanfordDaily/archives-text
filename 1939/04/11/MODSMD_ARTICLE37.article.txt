# Diamondmen To Play Ucla
## Cards Get Chance To Redeem Selves 
### 
The faltering Card baseball squad
| has a chance to regain some of the
[ground they lost over the week-end
when they meet the U.C.L.A. Bruins
on the sunken diamond at 3:15
j o'clock this afternoon.
; The Uclans, with a hard-hitting
i ball club, are in fifth place in the
; league standings, only one game be
hind Stanford. They are led by
1 Captain Johnny Carter, first base
! man, and John Zaby, slugging out-
I fielder. The Bruin mound corps
: has, however, been woefully weak
: all season. Their defensive work in
' the field has also been spotty and
! uncertain.
The U.C.L.A. outfit's major ae
i complishment this year was an up
! set 14-9 v/in over the California
Bears a few weeks ago. The Cards
! dropped a heart-breaking 5-4 game
1 to the Bears Saturday, but had little
I trouble in making four runs and
! six hits against Audie Daugherty,
' who holds an 8-0 shut-out win over
U.C.L.A.
; It's A1 Lazzarone's turn to start
! on the mound for the Farm team,
1 but, as he has had only three days
i rest since a nine-inning job against
the U.S.C. Trojans, Coach Harry
Wolter may decide to start Bill Mas
ters or Purkitt. Bill Jameson turned
J in a good job behind the plate in
! the last two games, and will prob
i ably catch.
