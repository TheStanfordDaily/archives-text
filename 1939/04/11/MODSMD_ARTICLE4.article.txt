# April 17 Named Script Deadline
## 
### 
Final date for submitting scripts
for the Spring Show to the Dra
matic Manager's office will be Mon
day, April 17, according to Charles
Bullotti of the dramatic office.
Due to the fact that the show will
be given late in the quarter, the
final due date on scripts has been
pushed ahead a week. The scripts
should be complete with music in
lead-sheet form, Bullotti added.
