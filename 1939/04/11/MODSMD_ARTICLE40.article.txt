### 
Rugby practice started in earnest ]
this week-end in preparation for the |
tilt with the Canadian All-Star team j
to be held on Treasure Island next
Saturday.
On Friday and Saturday of last
week-end a full practice for the 1
whole squad was held to whip the |
team in shape for probably the best j
game of the season in terms of good
rugby playing, according to Harry |
Maloney. Practice for tlie whole
team will be held Tuesday and Fri
day of this week to put some final â€¢
touches on rugby technique.
The tussle with the All-Stars is |
under the auspices of the Golden
Gate Exposition, which made it pos- ;
sible for the leading rugby teams of
the San Francisco Bay Region to
play rugby with a really expert ;
team. Tickets for the Stanford-All-
Star match can be secured from !
Harry Maloney at a cost of 25 cents. I
