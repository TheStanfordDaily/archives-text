POLITICS is a dirty business at best. Cau
cuses have long been denounced as cancers
on the democratic system. At Stanford lor the
past few years the hue and cry against secret
meetings and deals to decide on party candi
dates has been growing louder and more mean
ingful.
Last year the controversy came to a head
when a would-be A.S.S.U. president revolted
against the Row caucus and set himself up as
an independent candidate. Although the Greeks
were victorious in the election, this schism re
vealed a fundamental weakness in the Lasuen
political set-up.
Already this spring Row politicos are talking
about independent parties, simon-pure and
caucus-free. Their objective is admirable, but
they may find it difficult to overturn a machine
that has been producing winning candidates
since 1935. A victory for the rebels one year
would probably result in an even more formi
dably organized Row the next.
Paradoxical as it may seem, the solution to
the fraternities' problem lies in the Halls. In
order to avoid active dissatisfaction and revolt,
Interclub Council has made the Hall caucus an
official institution. The success of this plan
points the way for reform on the Row.
The most effective way to put an end to the
civil war among the Greeks is to make the Row
caucus an official organ of Interfraternity Coun
cil. Organization for the selection of candidates
is a vital feature of the party system. Caucuses
of one sort or another are inevitable.
If the Row wants to clean up its politics with
out losing its strength, an Interfraternity Con
vention will do the trick. As Stanford politics
matures parties must realize that a dozen smoke
filled hotel rooms cannot match the strength of
a packed convention hall.—L. L.
