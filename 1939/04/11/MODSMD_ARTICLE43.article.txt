# Comes the Revolution
## 
### 
IF you can put yourself in the place of a joy
ous little canary that gets conked over the
head just as it is in the midst of its song; if you
can imagine Shirley Temple gagged by rough
hands just as she starts singing some simple
little thing, then you must know how Encina
hashers must have felt yesterday morning when
they found the following note on their bulletin
board:
"Hashers may not whistle or sing while in
the kitchen or dining room on duty."
Such a minor instance of repression may
sound unimportant at first, but it's the sort of
thing that drives movements underground or
else drives the repressed to violence.
It was this sort of repression that caused
Russian college freshmen to sneak around mak
ing bombs instead of fussing around with less
lethal water bags.
Skeptics may laugh. But repression like this
is stirring latent fires of revolution.
Leaders will arise to lead the downtrodden
to revolt.
And the cry will be "Hashers of the Farm,
unite—you have nothing to lose but your muz
zles!"—R. D.
