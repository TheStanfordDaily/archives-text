DEFINITE announcement that "Tovarich" will
be presented for the second time on Friday
night gives evidence of the increasing partici
pation of alumni as members of the Stanford
triangle.
For some years, membership in the Alumni
Association has meant "a contact with the Uni
versity" and a chance to pay dues. More and
more, it's beginning to denote participation in
the active life of Stanford in lines other than
football and athletics.
What's more, out of this particular instance,
the Farm stands to gain three ways:
In the first place, the audience gets a repeat
performance on a fine comedy, staged by a
solid cast.
Reputation of campus dramatics, gradually
achieving a high place, gets an extra boost.
The alumni expect to be able to give two
scholarships next year on the basis of the sec
ond performance and not one, as thought for
merly.
Thus both groups can grin happily at each
other, well content with the return on effort
expended; both should not, probably will not,
forget the work of thp cast to makp "Tovarirh"
a success.
