# BULL SESSION
## SWING HIGH, SWING ROW 
### JOHN COBBS 
IN THE last couple of years politics at Stanford has
become very much like swing music. It is a con
fused concentration of noise-making, unplanned and
unco-ordinated, with everybody trying to play solo
at once; it is good fun for a while, but no one con
siders it very important.
In the past week a number of interesting noises
have sorted themselves out of the general confusion.
And one of the most intriguing is the drum-beating of
a group of Row sophomores who want to put up their
own slate for next year's class officers. They are afraid
that they will be sold down the river if they let their
houses do the dickering; and so they want their own
caucus to pick the Row candidates for junior class
officers.

The sophomores may or may not. be able to get
away with their pocket edition revolution. But in any
case their performance is interesting, t is also a good
indication of how far Stanford has departed from the
idea of political organization by classes.
Theoretically our machinery of student govern
ment. is built up according to class lines. Representa
tion on Ex Committee is by classes, and officers are
elected for each class. But in practice, politics work
without any attention to class.

r JPHE traditional Hall-RoVfr split that is dragged out of
back files of The Daily and dusted of! for each
election provides us with a nice, ready-made party
system. Each spring the various pressure groups with
in the two major parties get together for the game of
picking candidates.
The game itself is in interesting combination of
Blind Man's Buff and Goin to Jerusalem. The caucus
delegates simply go around in circles until enough of
them get left out. But in none of the frame-ups are
class lines considered. The class offices are regarded
simply as so many jobs. Each house or club trades
whatever it. can regardless of what classes it delivers
into bondage.

The classes provide convenient political divisions,
like the counties of a state. But the candidates are
picked according to house or club affiliation; inde
pedent machines for each class crack-up under the
strain of trading between houses. Our amateur Far
leys deal with groups and parties, not with classes.
All of this is obvious to anyone who can endure
the stale smoke and staler conversation of political
meetings. But even .so, every spring brings a barrage
of protests from enraged class citizens who charge that
their elections are being fixed.
Class elections are fixed, as far as nominations are
concerned; but that is the way our machinery works.
Proof of this is the fact that the sophomores will have
to bolt the Row caucus if they want to pick their own
candidates.
As I said, Stanford politics is like swing music. And
swing music never comes out the way the composer
wrote it.
