# Lightly ... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
INSIDE DOPE
While doing a little undercover research on this
year's crop of Row caucuses and cross caucuses, I un
earthed a rather interesting piece of Farm history
which has remained carefully and successfully buried
for over ten years now.
In regard for truth in journalism, I feel that it is
my duty to bring this story to light in spite of the con
sequences it may have to me. It was no accident, I
can toll you, that this story was kept secret.
It explains clearly how the Zetes came to be known
politically as hell raisers.
It happened back in the time when people didn't
say they were Republicans in that defensive tone of
voice, and there was no talk on the campus of men
running for office without being backed by some
group of fraternities.
The Farm was rife with candidates that year. Ev
eryone had a man, we've got to get our man in office;
yet. they were all willing to listen, at least, to fair com
promise. The main thing was to get on the gravy
boat.
Never was the telephone exchange so busy. "Hello,
Joe? This is Bill. Now keep this under your hat.
We're going to have a little meeting tonight to pick our
men for the election. We wondered if you and a
couple of your boys could come over . . . Good. We'll
see you at 7:30 then."
All day long that would go on. A telephone opera
tor (I have promised to keep her name a secret) who
has since been retired and lives modestly in a small
house down in Redwood City showed me page after
page of transcripts of these phone calls which she
herself took down.
There was one quite interesting one. A Deke was
talking on the phone to a Phi Delt (that in itself is an
indication of what a wild, unorthodox election that
was).
"What about the Pi Phi's?" the Deke asked.
"The Kappas, Pi Phis, and Deegces are absolutely
unpredictable," the Phi Delt answered. (That is a
theory which has passed down to us today. Until now
its origin has been extremely cloudy.)
The night before the election was a wild one. The
electioneering hit its peak. That night there were 22
Row caucuses alone.
The Zete house was verv small at the time. It had
but 22 members. Twenty-one of these members were
invited to the various caucuses; the 22nd called for a
caucus at the Zete house and invited sundry politicians
in.
Surprisingly enough this caucus was the wildest,
the loudest of them all. It was still going when all
the others had ended. One by one the Zetes came
home; and one by one they were thrown out.
"What the hell's the idea horning in on our
caucus like this? Beat it," they were told.
By 3 o'clock in the morning the caucus was still
going on. The Zetes were all standing out on the front
lawn. Repeatedly they had tried to storm the house
and i»et in. They couldn't. They held a meeting.
There was only one thing to do: in punishment to the
people holding the caucus, they would hold a siege.
If they couldn't get in, the others couldn't get out.
They held this siege for one month. Various friends
helped them with it so they could get a little sleep.
Each Zete would take his meals and sleep in the house
he had gone to for the caucus.
The men in the Zete house lived quite comfort
ably. They all went on independent study. They
took political science courses by mail and argued like
mad. They were very happy.
One among them had been a house manager in his
former house. When the first of the month came, he
couldn't resist sending out house bills. All of the
boys paid. Why not, they said. They needed officers.
They elected the lone Zete to the presidency.
When the siege ended, none of them wanted to
leave. Nor did the 21 Zetes want to come back. They
had been nicely assimilated by the other houses.
When the newly elected Zete president graduated,
the last Zete had left the Zete house.

They held this siege for one month. Various friends
helped them with it so they could get a little sleep.
Each Zete would take his meals and sleep in the house
he had gone to for the caucus.
The men in the Zete house lived quite comfort
ably. They all went on independent study. They
took political science courses by mail and argued like
mad. They were very happy.
One among them had been a house manager in his
former house. When the first of the month came, he
couldn't resist sending out house bills. All of the
boys paid. Why not, they said. They needed officers.
They elected the lone Zete to the presidency.
When the siege ended, none of them wanted to
leave. Nor did the 21 Zetes want to come back. They
had been nicely assimilated by the other houses.
When the newly elected Zete president graduated,
the last Zete had left the Zete house.

INSIDE DOPE
While doing a little undercover research on this
year's crop of Row caucuses and cross caucuses, I un
earthed a rather interesting piece of Farm history
which has remained carefully and successfully buried
for over ten years now.
In regard for truth in journalism, I feel that it is
my duty to bring this story to light in spite of the con
sequences it may have to me. It was no accident, I
can toll you, that this story was kept secret.
It explains clearly how the Zetes came to be known
politically as hell raisers.
It happened back in the time when people didn't
say they were Republicans in that defensive tone of
voice, and there was no talk on the campus of men
running for office without being backed by some
group of fraternities.
The Farm was rife with candidates that year. Ev
eryone had a man, we've got to get our man in office;
yet. they were all willing to listen, at least, to fair com
promise. The main thing was to get on the gravy
boat.
Never was the telephone exchange so busy. "Hello,
Joe? This is Bill. Now keep this under your hat.
We're going to have a little meeting tonight to pick our
men for the election. We wondered if you and a
couple of your boys could come over . . . Good. We'll
see you at 7:30 then."
All day long that would go on. A telephone opera
tor (I have promised to keep her name a secret) who
has since been retired and lives modestly in a small
house down in Redwood City showed me page after
page of transcripts of these phone calls which she
herself took down.
There was one quite interesting one. A Deke was
talking on the phone to a Phi Delt (that in itself is an
indication of what a wild, unorthodox election that
was).
"What about the Pi Phi's?" the Deke asked.
"The Kappas, Pi Phis, and Deegces are absolutely
unpredictable," the Phi Delt answered. (That is a
theory which has passed down to us today. Until now
its origin has been extremely cloudy.)
The night before the election was a wild one. The
electioneering hit its peak. That night there were 22
Row caucuses alone.
The Zete house was verv small at the time. It had
but 22 members. Twenty-one of these members were
invited to the various caucuses; the 22nd called for a
caucus at the Zete house and invited sundry politicians
in.
Surprisingly enough this caucus was the wildest,
the loudest of them all. It was still going when all
the others had ended. One by one the Zetes came
home; and one by one they were thrown out.
"What the hell's the idea horning in on our
caucus like this? Beat it," they were told.
By 3 o'clock in the morning the caucus was still
going on. The Zetes were all standing out on the front
lawn. Repeatedly they had tried to storm the house
and i»et in. They couldn't. They held a meeting.
There was only one thing to do: in punishment to the
people holding the caucus, they would hold a siege.
If they couldn't get in, the others couldn't get out.
They held this siege for one month. Various friends

Row caucuses alone.
The Zete house was verv small at the time. It had
but 22 members. Twenty-one of these members were
invited to the various caucuses; the 22nd called for a
caucus at the Zete house and invited sundry politicians
in.
Surprisingly enough this caucus was the wildest,
the loudest of them all. It was still going when all
the others had ended. One by one the Zetes came
home; and one by one they were thrown out.
"What the hell's the idea horning in on our
caucus like this? Beat it," they were told.
By 3 o'clock in the morning the caucus was still
going on. The Zetes were all standing out on the front
lawn. Repeatedly they had tried to storm the house
and i»et in. They couldn't. They held a meeting.
There was only one thing to do: in punishment to the
people holding the caucus, they would hold a siege.
If they couldn't get in, the others couldn't get out.
They held this siege for one month. Various friends
helped them with it so they could get a little sleep.
Each Zete would take his meals and sleep in the house
he had gone to for the caucus.
The men in the Zete house lived quite comfort
ably. They all went on independent study. They
took political science courses by mail and argued like
mad. They were very happy.
One among them had been a house manager in his
former house. When the first of the month came, he
couldn't resist sending out house bills. All of the
boys paid. Why not, they said. They needed officers.
They elected the lone Zete to the presidency.
When the siege ended, none of them wanted to
leave. Nor did the 21 Zetes want to come back. They
had been nicely assimilated by the other houses.
When the newly elected Zete president graduated,
the last Zete had left the Zete house.
