### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
VjARE NOSTRUM —that's what
the Romans used to call the
Mediterranean. Translated literally
this means "our sea," and the Cae
sars weren't flattering themselves
when they made the claim.
Today in Italy a gentleman with a
prominent chin is trying hard to re
create the Roman empire. On the
streets of his capital concrete maps
showing the growth of his posses
sions compare favorably with the
sperad of classical Latium. II Duce
has revived every symbol that pos
sibly can remind the Fascisti of the
glory that was Rome.
* * >1*
Mussolini lias established a
formidable authoritarian state on
the Italian peninsula, he lias laid
the bases for colonial expansion,
and now lie is directing his at
tention toward the Mediterranean,
Mare Nostrum, as the next step in
his imperial campaign.
Today he finds himself in a sin
gularly favorable position. The most
dangerous man in the world is his
ally, providing impressive support
for his every move. The Prime Min
ister of the greatest naval power in
Europe is afraid to offend him. His
army of 1.000,000 men is spread
across the length and breadth of the
Mediterranean Sea.
* * *
ffS THIS mighty design for an em
pire the result of the influence
of one man? To a limited degree,
it is.
The strength of twentieth cen
tury dictatorships is built largely
on the power of propaganda and
the personal magnetism of a single
leader. Regimentation, govern
ment control over every phase of
living are responsible for Musso
lini's success.
Above all, he has convinced the
Italian people of their fateful role
in history and of the inevitability of
the revival of the Roman empire.
From such threads as these, he has
woven the web of propaganda
which supports the totalitarian state.
* # *
It is because of this aspect of the
dictatorships, their dependence on
the influence of one man, that Lord
Beaverbrook, the famed British pub
lisher, yesterday expressed the
opinion that Europe will have no
war.
Adolf Hitler is no Napoleon, he
tells us; he is ignorant and inex
perienced in military atlairs. li
the Reich were to start a world
conflict, the Fuehrer would inevi
tably have to give up his supreme
position, and this he will never do.
Thus comes the first optimistic
word of the week from Britain.
* * *
Jj N CONTRAST to the positiveness
of the lord of the English press
comes news that again Prime Min
ister Chamberlain's spine is turning
to jelly. Not that he is going to
abandon his anti-Hitler stand —no
one could be that stupid. But he is
treading very softly in his diplomatic
relations with Italy, preparing to dig
up the old appeasement act to try
to win over Mussolini.
Considering the strength of the
Rome-Berlin axis, it is ridiculous to
expect that II Duce will side with
France and England when the split
comes. But Neville Chamberlain
believes that he will be able to
smash the dreams of a twentieth
century Roman empire by forming
a Mediterranean alliance in which
the Fascists will be included.
<« # *
In spite of all this international
subtlety and the declared paci
listic intentions of several of Eu
rope's head men, (lie scene today
is actually set for war.
Early this morning the French
Mediterranean fleet set sail for the
Aegean region, which has been the
center of tension for the past few
days. Premier Daladier was busy
holding councils of war and keeping
an eye on the current fortification of
Spanish Morocco, which appears as
a potential danger to French colo
nies in North Africa.
Despite Mussolini's week-end
warnings, Greece has opened her
ports to the British fleet, and Ihe
Greek government is preparing to
mobilize its troops in case trouble
develops.
♦ * * S
The position of the new Spanish
Nationalist regime in this situation
is just a bit uncertain, and is caus
ing France and England no little
worry. The Fascist troops that
helped to win the Civil War still
have not been withdrawn from the
peninsula, and during the past few
days II Duce has been sending addi
tional legions to Spain.
That this may constitute the
western end of an Italian drive on
the Mediterranean is what is troub
ling Messrs. Chamberlain and Dala
dier. Every day the Fascist govern
ment is enlarging its armed force,
and it looks as if things are right
for an attempt to revive Mare Nos
trum.
In Washington President Roose
velt yesterday expressed his ap
proval of a rabble-rousing news
paper editorial which advocated
definite action against the totali
tarian ? tates of Europe. F.D.R. ex
pressed the belief that the United
States can prevent war, if we act
now. Optimistic fellow, what?

to jelly. Not that he is going to
abandon his anti-Hitler stand —no
one could be that stupid. But he is
treading very softly in his diplomatic
relations with Italy, preparing to dig
up the old appeasement act to try
to win over Mussolini.
Considering the strength of the
Rome-Berlin axis, it is ridiculous to
expect that II Duce will side with
France and England when the split
comes. But Neville Chamberlain
believes that he will be able to
smash the dreams of a twentieth
century Roman empire by forming
a Mediterranean alliance in which
the Fascists will be included.

In spite of all this international
subtlety and the declared paci
listic intentions of several of Eu
rope's head men, (lie scene today
is actually set for war.
Early this morning the French
Mediterranean fleet set sail for the
Aegean region, which has been the
center of tension for the past few
days. Premier Daladier was busy
holding councils of war and keeping
an eye on the current fortification of
Spanish Morocco, which appears as
a potential danger to French colo
nies in North Africa.
Despite Mussolini's week-end
warnings, Greece has opened her
ports to the British fleet, and Ihe
Greek government is preparing to
mobilize its troops in case trouble
develops.

The position of the new Spanish
Nationalist regime in this situation
is just a bit uncertain, and is caus
ing France and England no little
worry. The Fascist troops that
helped to win the Civil War still
have not been withdrawn from the
peninsula, and during the past few
days II Duce has been sending addi
tional legions to Spain.
That this may constitute the
western end of an Italian drive on
the Mediterranean is what is troub
ling Messrs. Chamberlain and Dala
dier. Every day the Fascist govern
ment is enlarging its armed force,
and it looks as if things are right
for an attempt to revive Mare Nos
trum.
In Washington President Roose
velt yesterday expressed his ap
proval of a rabble-rousing news
paper editorial which advocated
definite action against the totali
tarian ? tates of Europe. F.D.R. ex
pressed the belief that the United
States can prevent war, if we act
now. Optimistic fellow, what?
VjARE NOSTRUM —that's what
the Romans used to call the
Mediterranean. Translated literally
this means "our sea," and the Cae
sars weren't flattering themselves
when they made the claim.
Today in Italy a gentleman with a
prominent chin is trying hard to re
create the Roman empire. On the
streets of his capital concrete maps
showing the growth of his posses
sions compare favorably with the
sperad of classical Latium. II Duce
has revived every symbol that pos
sibly can remind the Fascisti of the
glory that was Rome.

Mussolini lias established a
formidable authoritarian state on
the Italian peninsula, he lias laid
the bases for colonial expansion,
and now lie is directing his at
tention toward the Mediterranean,
Mare Nostrum, as the next step in
his imperial campaign.
Today he finds himself in a sin
gularly favorable position. The most
dangerous man in the world is his
ally, providing impressive support
for his every move. The Prime Min
ister of the greatest naval power in
Europe is afraid to offend him. His
army of 1.000,000 men is spread
across the length and breadth of the
Mediterranean Sea.

ffS THIS mighty design for an em
pire the result of the influence
of one man? To a limited degree,
it is.
The strength of twentieth cen
tury dictatorships is built largely
on the power of propaganda and
the personal magnetism of a single
leader. Regimentation, govern
ment control over every phase of
living are responsible for Musso
lini's success.
Above all, he has convinced the
Italian people of their fateful role
in history and of the inevitability of
the revival of the Roman empire.
From such threads as these, he has
woven the web of propaganda
which supports the totalitarian state.

It is because of this aspect of the
dictatorships, their dependence on
the influence of one man, that Lord
Beaverbrook, the famed British pub
lisher, yesterday expressed the
opinion that Europe will have no
war.
Adolf Hitler is no Napoleon, he
tells us; he is ignorant and inex
perienced in military atlairs. li
the Reich were to start a world
conflict, the Fuehrer would inevi

position, and this he will never do.

showing the growth of his posses

has revived every symbol that pos

Mussolini lias established a
formidable authoritarian state on
the Italian peninsula, he lias laid
the bases for colonial expansion,
and now lie is directing his at
tention toward the Mediterranean,
Mare Nostrum, as the next step in
his imperial campaign.
Today he finds himself in a sin
gularly favorable position. The most
dangerous man in the world is his
ally, providing impressive support
for his every move. The Prime Min
ister of the greatest naval power in
Europe is afraid to offend him. His
army of 1.000,000 men is spread
across the length and breadth of the
Mediterranean Sea.

ffS THIS mighty design for an em
pire the result of the influence
of one man? To a limited degree,
it is.
The strength of twentieth cen
tury dictatorships is built largely
on the power of propaganda and
the personal magnetism of a single
leader. Regimentation, govern
ment control over every phase of
living are responsible for Musso
lini's success.
Above all, he has convinced the
Italian people of their fateful role
in history and of the inevitability of
the revival of the Roman empire.
From such threads as these, he has
woven the web of propaganda
which supports the totalitarian state.

It is because of this aspect of the
dictatorships, their dependence on
the influence of one man, that Lord
Beaverbrook, the famed British pub
lisher, yesterday expressed the
opinion that Europe will have no
war.
Adolf Hitler is no Napoleon, he
tells us; he is ignorant and inex
perienced in military atlairs. li
the Reich were to start a world
conflict, the Fuehrer would inevi
tably have to give up his supreme
position, and this he will never do.
Thus comes the first optimistic
word of the week from Britain.
* * *
Jj N CONTRAST to the positiveness
of the lord of the English press
comes news that again Prime Min
ister Chamberlain's spine is turning
to jelly. Not that he is going to
abandon his anti-Hitler stand —no
one could be that stupid. But he is
treading very softly in his diplomatic
relations with Italy, preparing to dig
up the old appeasement act to try
to win over Mussolini.
Considering the strength of the
Rome-Berlin axis, it is ridiculous to
expect that II Duce will side with
France and England when the split
comes. But Neville Chamberlain
believes that he will be able to
smash the dreams of a twentieth
century Roman empire by forming
a Mediterranean alliance in which
the Fascists will be included.

In spite of all this international
subtlety and the declared paci
listic intentions of several of Eu
rope's head men, (lie scene today
is actually set for war.
Early this morning the French
Mediterranean fleet set sail for the
Aegean region, which has been the
center of tension for the past few
days. Premier Daladier was busy
holding councils of war and keeping
an eye on the current fortification of
Spanish Morocco, which appears as
a potential danger to French colo
nies in North Africa.
Despite Mussolini's week-end
warnings, Greece has opened her
ports to the British fleet, and Ihe
Greek government is preparing to
mobilize its troops in case trouble
develops.

The position of the new Spanish
Nationalist regime in this situation
is just a bit uncertain, and is caus
ing France and England no little
worry. The Fascist troops that
helped to win the Civil War still
have not been withdrawn from the
peninsula, and during the past few
days II Duce has been sending addi
tional legions to Spain.
That this may constitute the
western end of an Italian drive on
the Mediterranean is what is troub
ling Messrs. Chamberlain and Dala
dier. Every day the Fascist govern
ment is enlarging its armed force,
and it looks as if things are right
for an attempt to revive Mare Nos
trum.
In Washington President Roose
velt yesterday expressed his ap
proval of a rabble-rousing news
paper editorial which advocated
definite action against the totali
tarian ? tates of Europe. F.D.R. ex
pressed the belief that the United
States can prevent war, if we act
now. Optimistic fellow, what?
VjARE NOSTRUM —that's what
the Romans used to call the
Mediterranean. Translated literally
this means "our sea," and the Cae
sars weren't flattering themselves
when they made the claim.
Today in Italy a gentleman with a
prominent chin is trying hard to re
create the Roman empire. On the
streets of his capital concrete maps
showing the growth of his posses
sions compare favorably with the
sperad of classical Latium. II Duce
has revived every symbol that pos
