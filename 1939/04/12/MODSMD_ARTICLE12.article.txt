GRADUATE WOMEN: After a I
smashing barrage from a lobby of j
three graduate women, the com
mittee put on Tuesday's ballot an i
amendment providing that the two,
graduate seats on Ex Committee be'
held one by a man and the other j
by a woman. At present, both seats |
usually are held by men, since there j
is no provision effective here.
Roberta Tuthill was elected to one 1
of the graduate seats in the winter i
quarter elections.
Asked if the women will try to !
capture the other graduate seat in !
Tuesday's election, she said, "If this j
amendment goes on the ballot, no
graduate woman will run in Tues- |
day's election—as I understand it." j
If the amendment passes, Article 1
11, Section 2a of the A.S.S.U. Con- J
stitution will read as follows:
a. Membership. In addition to the
President and Vice-President, the
Executive Committee shall be com
posed of nine members as follows:
One man and one woman, both j
graduates . . . The following mem- |
bers shall be elected at the regular j
spring election by the members of
the Association at large: Graduate '
man . . . The following members
shall be elected at the regular Feb- j
ruary election by the members of j
the association at large: Graduate
woman , . ."
As it stands now the provision fol
lows:
"Membership. In addition to the i
President and Vice-President, the
Executive Committee shall be com- i
posed of nine members, as follows: .
Two graduates . . . The following j
shall be elected at the regular i
Spring Quarter election by the j

large: . . . one graduate member
. . . The following members shall
