### HARRY PRESS 
The Row hoys and girls ganged up for a caucus last night, stuitUred,
to each other for three hours, and picked Ken Cuthhertson to head their
slate.
Although the nominations came rather hard, there was enough unan
imity of opinion throughout the caucus to indicate that the pre-cauniK

â–ºheld yesterday afternoon at the Delt.
house and attended by 17 houses,
was successful in oiling the ma
chine's cogs.
At the same time, Gene Coldiron
announced his intention of running
independently, following a one
house caucus of the Phi Delts.
Showing a decided fear of lack of
solidarity, several of the delegates
demanded, and were successful in
having passed, a motion pledging all
those at the meeting to an "honor
bound" pact to support the caucus'
choices. The vote was unanimous.

Prophesying a sudden death for
Women's Conference's brainchild,
the nominating committee, action
taken at the caucus showed that
there is no general support for this
committee's actions.
ENDS IN COMPROMISE
An attempt of representatives of
the committee to get official caucus
okay on the committee's two nomi
nees for A.S.S.U. vice-president,
Jean Bolton and Coline Upshaw,
ended in a compromise move.
The caucus passed a motion which
provided that both women would
run if no Hall woman were nomi
nated; however, if that should oc
cur, the one receiving the low vote
of the caucus would drop from the
race.
Since the vote went to the Dee
gees' Upshaw, Jean Bolton will be
"honor-bound" to withdraw should
a Hall woman be nominated.
Latest information from the Halls
indicated that Eloise Lambert, La
gunita, would be nominated for the
A.S.S.U. vice-presidency.
ENCINA CHOOSES BURNS
As per annual custom, Encina's
Row politicos held their clambake
last night, with a resultant choice
of Jack Burns for sophomore class
president, and Frank Boutin for
sophomore man on Ex Committee.
The Row caucus, after okaying
the choice of Burns, decided to sub
stitute the name of Jack Harris for
that of Boutin, arguing their deci
sion on the grounds that the entire
Row, not just the freshmen, vote
for that position.
Winning in a runaway vote for
junior class president, Ned Pugh
nevertheless will find himself on
election day with the same two op
ponents, in addition to the Hall can
didate, who ran against him last
night.
Hank Houser, Sigma Chi, and
Harold Bernard, Zete, defeated at
the Row caucus, separately an
nounced their decisions to run inde
pendently.
