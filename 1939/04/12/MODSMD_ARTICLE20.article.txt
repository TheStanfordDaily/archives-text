# Juniors Plan Water Show For May 5
## Excom, Low Water May Move Carnival To Swimming Pools 
### 
An Ex Committee ruling, which
refused a suggested earlier date for
the Junior Water Carnival, and the
rapidly - disappearing Lake La
g unit a, have made latest plans for
the annual event ineffective, and
may move the carnival to the swim
ming pools on May 5, according to
Carl Phillips, chairman of the com
mittee.
Alter a meeting last night which
planned events for an early date,
Phillips was notified of the Excom
ruling, and issued the following
statement:
MAY 5 HATE
"It begins to look as though the
Junior Water Carnival will not be
held in Lake Lagunita at all. At
present, we are going to see about
holding it in the swimming pools, at
the original date of May 5."
The Carnival, traditionally an in
tegral part of the annual Convales
cent Home Drive, thus will coincide
with the date of the drive, which
this year will be held during the
week of May 1 through 5.
Definite plans for the carnival
will be laid at a committee meeting
tonight at 7:150 o'clock in the Wom
en's Clubhouse, according to Phil
lips. He requested that all com
mittee members be present.
