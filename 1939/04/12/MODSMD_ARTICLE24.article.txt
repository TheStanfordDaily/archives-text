# Debate Team Absorbs Frosh
## Forensic Activities Assume Broad Scope 
### 
Freshman forensic activities this
quarter will assume a much broader
scope not only because of the re
cent absorption into the varsity de
bate squad of the embryonic debat
ers but also because of their own
stiff schedule for the next few
weeks.
At yesterday's varsity squad meet
ing freshman debaters were wel
comed into the group by Dr. Le
land T. Chapin and this welcome
was acknowledged by the freshman
debate coach. Marshall Dill. Mr. Dill
said that he was sure his charges
could be counted on for any activi
ties they might be called upon to
fulfill.
Included on the freshman sched
ule for the quarter are debates with
the Cal Aggies, California, U.S.F.,
Modesto Jaysee, Santa Clara, and
Sacramento Jaysee. Among the ques
tions to be debated are the Munich
Peace Pact, British Alliance and
Anglo American. All members of
the debate squad will have the op
portunity to participate in the 10
tilts between now and May 5.
