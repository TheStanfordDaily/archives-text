### JERRY MAYER 
IN TIIIS DAY and age of the
pampered athlete, the training the
ories of Robert Lyman Templeton
are especially interesting.
The Dink has one particularly in
triguing hypothesis, that athletes —
trackmen in his case—can't possibly
become stale. Under the Templeton
system there is no substitute for
hard work. Dink sees no reason why
an athlete can't do as much work as
an ordinary day laborer and he does
n't think that running around the
track a few (hundred) times a day,
or tossing the weights for hour upon
end, or jumping heights and dis
tances can ever compare with the
work a laborer puts in.
Templeton believes that an ath
lete can constantly improve — with
enough hard work—and that, laying
off to prevent so-called "staleness"
does him more harm than good. An
athlete who has laid off a couple of
days may find himself all out of
kilter when he tries to resume train
ing. figures Dink.
Thus, when most observers think
that a Card cinderman who isn't at
his peak is stale from too much
work, Dink thinks that he hasn't
been working hard enough.
In other words, the word "stale"
is foreign to the vocabulary of Rob
ert L. Templeton.

IT'S A WEE hit early to be dis
cussing basketball, but Coach Ev
erett Dean's spring practice is due
to begin shortly. Dean loses Cap
tain Phil Zonne, Harlan Copsey,
Dick Lyon, and possibly Bill Rapp
off last season's letterman list, but
some fine prospects are headed
toward the Farm from outlying jay
sees.
From Modesto J. C. Forest An
derson is definitely interested in the
Farm. Up at San Mateo Les Major,
G-foot-8 center, is almost a certain
ty. From the southland there are
the White twins, Bob and Bill, from
Fullerton Jaysee, and Vic Townsend
of Compton.
Townsend is perhaps the finest of
the bunch, a really brilliant pros
pect, but there seems to be some
doubt whether his grades are all
they should be. Anderson is a clever
0-footer who averaged 12 points a
game last year. Incidentally, he pot
tod 27 digits in one contest.
There is only one way the White
twins can be told apart—one is 6
feet 6 inches tall, the other is an in
significant shrimp of 6-5.
While on the subject of skyscrap
ers, Dean doesn't expect Tom Sie
bert back, which is quite a surprise
as it was pretty generally under
stood that Big Tom was anxious and
ready to return to Stanford.
