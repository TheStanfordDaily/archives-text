# Intramural Softball Sked Opens Today
## 
### 
Spring, as everyone is finding out,
brings many things; but the most
important to the sport fan is base
! ball. The great American game, in
I this case under the guise of soft
j ball, has arrived for intramural ath-
I letes and will officially begin today
| with three tilts scheduled on the in
! tramural field.
The games are scheduled for 4
! o'clock and any team more than 10

minutes late for their game will be
! forced to forfeit.
The referees in today's games will
be Harlan Copsey, Hoot Gibson, and
| Louie Tsoutsouvas. The intramural
: field is located, for those not on the
| in, between the stadium and polo
| field. Intramural teams are to con
| sist of between 8 and 10 men, the
i extra player being called the buck
j short. He plays a roving short-stop
I between first and second base.
Intramural Manager Andy Stojko-
I vich announces a total sign-up of
| 37 teams, which have been divided
| into six leagues of six and seven
J teams. A regular game is seven inn
| ings in length but, upon the consent
! of both teams, it may be cut to five
j frames.
: Varsity and freshman baseball
j squad members are ineligible, as
j well as former numeral or block
j winners in any university or junioi
| college. Softball is essentially base
ball but has several radical changes
in rules, and so Stojkovich urges all
! competitors to become familiar with
! the rules stated on the intramural
| board.
