# Stanford Mermen Hold Edge Over Cal in Big Tank Meet
## 
### 
The history of the Cal-Stanford swimming Hi,if Meet is one decidedly
1 splashed with a cardinal hue. The Bears had a team and heat out the
Cards from 1915 to 1917. Since that time during the 21 years up to the
present time Stanford has swept to victory in every meet except one,
in 1937.
Last year the Bears were touted to win and then came out on the
i short end «»1 a 55-20 score. And for the Big Meet of 19159 all dope figures

►from compaartive scores indicates
I that the swing will still be toward
the Cards.
COMPARATIVE SCORES
' Early in the season both teams
| met San Jose State-Stanford slaugh
! tered the Spartans while Cal only

tied them; Stanford beat Oregon
while Cal lost to the same Duck
team; against U.C.L.A. the Cards
won 55-19 while Cal only beat the
Bruins 46-29; both teams lost to
the powerful U.S.C. team but Stan
ford took five out of nine firsts
while the Bears garnered only two.
It cannot be said, however, that
Stanford is a dead cinch to take the
meet. Cal has the advantage of
having the meet in their own pool
and may rise to great heights.
ONE- P()l NT VICTORY?
It is true, though, that Cal would
have to get all the breaks to win.
Right now a conservative estimate
would give Stanford a win by one
point, btu many toss-up events may
swing the score either way.
Death of hogs from cholera in the
principal farming states showed a
30 per cent increase in 1938 over
1937.
