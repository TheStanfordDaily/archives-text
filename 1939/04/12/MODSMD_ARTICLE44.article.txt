WHEN the juniors asked to have Ex Com
mittee move the date of the Junior Water
Carnival up to April 19 last night, they were
met with an ultimate denial.
They found, first that Axe Society's Student-
Faculty Day was scheduled on that day, that
Helen Jepson will sing that Wednesday night.
Reasons for Excom's actions are simple
enough; to the juniors, they probably will not
seem adequate.
In the first place, spring quarter is already
so jammed that there is no point in carrying
that jam-up to the extreme where three events
of major importance —any one of them large
enough for a complete day's schedule in itself—
are put on the calendar for the same day.
This does not alter the fact, however, that the
Lake will be too dry on May 5, Friday of the
Convalescent Home Drive, to hold the Carnival
on its annual date. Engineers say it must be
held on the Lake on or before the nineteenth,
next Wednesday.
To schedule the Carnival for next Tuesday
would only be to interfere with elections, pos
sibly withdraw the attraction of Student-Faculty
Day, if not vice versa. There is the question,
too, as to adequacy of time for preparations by
that date.
Alternative suggestion to advancing the date
as the juniors wish is to hold the Carnival in
Encina Pools on May 5. In that case, however,
it would assume more nearly the proportions
of a swimming meet, not a carnival.
Either suggestion has its bad points—both
hurt the drawing power of the Carnival.
In the light of the difficulty, then, there seems
to be only one other possibility.
Cancel the Carnival for this year, hold it in
the memory of Stanford for a year as a tradi
tionally fine event, and redouble efforts next
year. There's surely enough still left in the
calendar to keep Stanford satisfied this quarter.
Either that, or pray for rain, damn quick.
