# Out of Chaos

WITH a lecture by Vincent Sheean, foreign
correspondent and critic, slated for tomor
row night, Stanford appears to have a healthy
three-months' embryo of a lecture series on its
hands.
And if Mr. Sheean packs Memorial Hall the
way John Gunther did some time back, Stan
ford can have a lecture series next year that
is on a par with its Concert Series.
When a lecture series first was suggested
last spring it was feared such a venture would
not be self-supporting. When Mr. Gunther's
lecture was scheduled, many feared the Asso
ciated Students would go into the red on the
project.
But heavy attendance at such a program when
provided shows that the campus will turn out
to hear someone at least fairly familiar, that it
considers presentation of well-known outside
speakers a function of a university.
Consideration of Mr. Sheean's career as au
thor and critic shows that he merits the trek over
to Memorial Hall tomorrow night. Entering the
field of journalism in the early '20's with his
inside story of the revolt of the Riffs against
Spain, he has covered League of Nations de
velopments, Germany's march into the Rhine
land, and the Ethiopian crisis.
His most recent "assignment" was Hitler's
triumphal march into Czechoslovakia.
Drawing from all his personal experiences in
the European scene, Mr. Sheean tomorrow
night plans to offer Stanford a digested review
of European developments during the past few
years, of the struggle between totalitarianism
and democracy.
In Mr. Sheean there is just the chance that
Stanford, confused along with all the rest, may
find "something solid to cling to in a disinte
grating world."â€”R. D.
