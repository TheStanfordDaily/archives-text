# Twilight Saving Time
## 
### 
WHITE shoes and tanned shoulders indicate
that it is spring at Stanford, and the weather
is fair. The sun doesn't set until after the hash
ers have finished the dinner dishes. Young
men have been seen guiltily sliding out of their
cars and bolting up the front steps of their dates'
houses while it is still light.
With daylight-saving time, Eastern communi
ties have long been taking advantage of this
opportunity of making more hay while the sun |

shines. No loyal Stanfordite would ever admit
that such a plan is necessary in California.
Yet these fine days find more and more stu
dents exercising out-of-doors just before din
ner. Chem majors and graduates are tearing
themselves away from their labs and libraries,
and are making use of Stanford's top-notch ath
letic plant. Out in front of the fraternities and
clubs Softball games are organized before din
ner, and teams are practicing for coming intra
mural competition. Luring both participants and
spectators is Dink Templeton's series of twi
light trackmeets on Angell Field.
All of this means that every day more men
are late for dinner.
Yesterday members of Axe Society proposed
that Stanford's dinner hour should be postponed
until 6:30 or even 6:45 o'clock during spring
quarter. In order to succeed, the plan would
have to be universally adopted on the campus.
Those who believe that we already devote too
much time to recreation and too little to study
undoubtedly will disapprove of the idea. But,
since it seems that Stanford is bound to pro
duce a race of hedonists each spring quarter,
perhaps the academics had best bow to the
inevitable.â€”L. L.
