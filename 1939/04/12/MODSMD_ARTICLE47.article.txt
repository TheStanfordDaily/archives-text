# BULL SESSION

JJT IS fortunate for the self-respect of Stanford's ap
prentice politicians that in our game of elections
we do not play for keeps. If we did, most of our ten
cent-store Farleys would have lost their brother's shirt
long before this. In fact, as I watch the current scram
ble around the grab-bag, I am inclined to believe that
we make politics a game simply because we don't
dare take it seriously.
Down through the ages conspiracy has always been
the best sort of fun. Since the time of Brutus con
spirators have entertained themselves straining their
eyes in dark alleys and chancing pneumonia in damp
cellars. But if Stanford politicians had to risk their
self-respect on their frame-ups, most of them would
be on a monastery waiting list.

This spring the confused turning of heels and
wheels has raised a dust cloud that compares well in
density with those of previous years; our current edi
tions of politicians also demonstrate a density equal to
anything exhibited in the past. To date the only con
clusion possible is that anyone who takes himself se
riously is going to be good material for a psychiatrist.
The Hall candidates rode through the caucus in a
gilded chariot. But. insurgents are complaining bit
terly that the chariot looked very much like a steam
roller. Hall leaders are consulting the dictionary for
definitions of "subtlety" and "tact."

\ LONG the Row the fog of suspicion and confusion
has closed in until even room-mates are hiding their
shirts from each other. One house has declared itself
for a campaign conducted according to "ethics and
ideals," again driving politicians to the dictionary.
But the other houses complain bitterly that even ethics
can't justify cold-blooded throat cutting.
The upper Row and the lower Row have scurried
about, frantically, each trying to find the other's back,
each protesting that it does not carry knives. Inde
pendents drive deals without bothering to keep track
of them; regulars say savagely that the independents
are selling loyalty short.

Even the Row caucus has been bundled in a cloud
of confusion. Originally called for the Fiji house, it
was threatened by a persistent rumor that it would
be held at the Theta Chi house. The apparent political
sleight-of-hand was explained by saying that another
house not knowing of the first caucus had called the
second. But opposing leaders say that the particular
house has a reputation for being so crooked that it
casts a figure eight shadow. They point out how con
venient it would be for the ethics party if no official
Row caucus could be held.
It's excellent fun. It's always fun to ride the rail
road. But in this case most of our politicians are rid
ing the rods. I don't wonder they make a game of it.
