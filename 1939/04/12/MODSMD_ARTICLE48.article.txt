ANALYSIS

This jolly snatch of conversation was overheard on
the Library steps the other morning.
A spring quarter Stanford woman (not to be con
fused with an autumn or winter quarter Stanford
woman) was standing on the steps as a guy came
out of the Library. "How ya doin' Babe," she yelled
to him very jovially. "Didja flunk out?"
"Yeah," he answered equally jovially. "Did you?"
"No, minus 15."
"And you're still in?"
"Yeah."
They went off down the steps together as if they
didn't have a care in the world; and they probably
haven't.

Adolf Bode, the German exchange student at Stan
ford, was down in Mexico during spring vacation, a
correspondent tells me. Coming back through the
customs, he found that he had forgotten his passport.
After being held (here for about two hours, he de
cided to try his student body card. It got him through.

When people speak of politicians, invariably they
bring in the word "windbag" at some point or other.
I know exactly what they mean.
I went to a caucus yesterday.

Which reminds me: as someone said in one of my
classes earlier in the day, if you psychoanalyze long
enough, you're sure to get down to the basic dirt.

A sorority girl—l believe it was a sorority girl—got
a telegram the other day. One of her sisters called up
to her. when it came, telling her that she had a tele
gram.
"That is impossible," the girl answered her. "I
never get telegrams. Excepting from people who have
just died."

At one of the caucuses yesterday, a Row man con
temptuously characterized the class caucuses (not to
be confused with the ofTicial Row caucuses) as badly
organized, ineffectual, shot full of schisms, rife with
undercurrents and cross undercurrents, and just no
damn use.
But why limit it to class caucuses'.'
