# Glee Club to Give Modern Concert
## 
### 
With rehearsal times diminishing
before their home concert on April
22, Stanford's Glee Clubs have se
lected the complete program which
they will present.
Tending toward less classical se- j
lections than in the past, and bright
ened by several modern selections,
the program will present six song
groups by the combined men's and
women's clubs and an intermission
soloist.
Still held under cover are novel
j plans for setting the concert. Work
is being carried on with local stage
' designers and the, psychology de- J
partment of the University to ar
range a concert pictorially as well as
audibly impressive, according to
Club Manager Herbert Wolley.
