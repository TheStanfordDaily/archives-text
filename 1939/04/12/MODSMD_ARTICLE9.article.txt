The first report of the campaign finds $298 contributed to the Alumni
Drive and $143 to the Stanford Fund, according to Chairman Jack Laney.
Half-way contributions are about equal to half the total of last year's
donation.

amount. Last year 388 contributed. Let's make it at least 500 for our class
