### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
lIAUNTED by fear of war that
may come, a Los Angeles high
school boy killed himself yesterday.
While this column is calculated to
produce no such result at Stanford,
those who have glanced at it on the
days when the European scene lias
appeared particularly black must
have felt a bit worried about the
permanence of peace.
Today we thankfully report a lull
in the storm. Mussolini has finished
wiping up Albania and has made
King Victor Emanuel monarch of
the tiny state. Italy's formal guar
anty of the integrity of Greece has
been accepted, and-the sun is shin
ing through the clouds.
But not for long.
* * #
This afternoon Prime Minister
Nevilel Chamberlain will address
the House of Commons, Premier
Edouard Daladier will issue a
formal statement to the world at
large. What they will both say
amounts to this—
"Mr. Mussolini, you had better
lay off Greece and Turkey. If you
don't we'll kick your teeth in."
Of course that's not the way they
will word it. The British govern
ment is being careful to make no
renunciation of the Anglo-Italian
pact, but at the same tune it feels
compelled to express disapproval of
the Albanian conquest and to sound
a warning against further extension
of the Fascist power.
* * *
4 CROSS the Channel the French
will be less tactful in expressing
their views on the situation. Real
ists to the core, they readily accept
the fact that Italian ambitions con
stitute a far greater threat to them
than to the English. If Hitler is
Chamberlain's nemesis, Mussolini is
surely Daladier's.
Britain may be subtle, France
may be blunt, but their policies co
incide. The expansion of Italy
must stop, or the democratic- al
lies will go to war.
* *
Just to be certain that II Duce
realizes the seriousness of what they
are going to say, both the British
and French have stationed their
fleets in the eastern Mediterranean.
At. first glance it would seem that
they mean business, and that the
Rome - Berlin axis had best be
careful where it treads.
But those who know Neville
Chamberlain will find it hard to be
lieve that he is taking a firm stand
against Italy; he just isn't that type
of a fellow. His speech to Parlia
ment today will probably be strong
enough to warn Mussolini to take
it easy, but he will be careful not
to create an irreparable breach.
Nt * *
r J I IIE Prime Minister still nour
ishes hopes of forcing his ap
peasement medicine down II
Duce's throat. His optimism is
based on three rather flimsy sup
ports:
He believes that when war actu
ally comes, he will be able to win
Mussolini away from the Rome-Ber
lin axis. He realizes the instability
of an armed peace, and is convinced
that the only alternative to appease
ment is war. He is encouraged by
assurances given him yesterday that
Italy is preparing to withdraw her
forces from the Spanish peninsula.
<1 * #
However, no one can be certain
of exactly what is happening in
Spain. While the Fascists declare
that they will call home their troops
immediately following the victory
parade in Madrid on May 2. Ilalian
officers in civilian dress have been
arriving during the past few days.
France is jittery over reports
that Spanish troops are mobiliz
ing just south of the Pyrenees and
p.tqsnj tim.iq o.n; suoi)K.>i|i)joj jnqj
to completion in Spanish Morocco.
Just where Italy fits into the pic
ture is uncertain as yet, but it
presents undeniable possibilities.

CO EUROPE is taking a breather
k today. The excited nations
across the Atlantic are sitting
around for a few hours, puffing and
waiting for the next event.
At the same time the Congress of
the United States is carefully con
sidering making revisions in its
neutrality policy. President Roose
velt's strong approval Tuesday of a
Washington editorial advocating that
the United States take action on the
European situation probably was
meant as a nudge in Ihe ribs for the
legislators, urging them to start
making reforms.
Yesterday it was suggested to
Congress that the Panama Canal be
closed to the navies of all nations
that have violated treaties, but the
neutrality bloc opposed this pro
posal and condemned the President's
advocating U. S. interference in the
international struggle.

amounts to this—

CO EUROPE is taking a breather
k today. The excited nations
across the Atlantic are sitting
around for a few hours, puffing and
waiting for the next event.
At the same time the Congress of
the United States is carefully con
sidering making revisions in its
neutrality policy. President Roose
velt's strong approval Tuesday of a
Washington editorial advocating that
the United States take action on the
European situation probably was
meant as a nudge in Ihe ribs for the
legislators, urging them to start
making reforms.
Yesterday it was suggested to
Congress that the Panama Canal be
closed to the navies of all nations
that have violated treaties, but the
neutrality bloc opposed this pro
posal and condemned the President's
advocating U. S. interference in the
international struggle.
lIAUNTED by fear of war that
may come, a Los Angeles high
school boy killed himself yesterday.
While this column is calculated to
produce no such result at Stanford,
those who have glanced at it on the
days when the European scene lias
appeared particularly black must
have felt a bit worried about the
permanence of peace.
Today we thankfully report a lull
in the storm. Mussolini has finished
wiping up Albania and has made
King Victor Emanuel monarch of
the tiny state. Italy's formal guar
anty of the integrity of Greece has
been accepted, and-the sun is shin

Chamberlain's nemesis, Mussolini is
surely Daladier's.
Britain may be subtle, France

Just to be certain that II Duce

At. first glance it would seem that

careful where it treads.
But those who know Neville
Chamberlain will find it hard to be

against Italy; he just isn't that type
of a fellow. His speech to Parlia

enough to warn Mussolini to take
it easy, but he will be careful not

Mussolini away from the Rome-Ber

of an armed peace, and is convinced
that the only alternative to appease

assurances given him yesterday that

CO EUROPE is taking a breather
k today. The excited nations
across the Atlantic are sitting
around for a few hours, puffing and
waiting for the next event.
At the same time the Congress of
the United States is carefully con
sidering making revisions in its
neutrality policy. President Roose
velt's strong approval Tuesday of a
Washington editorial advocating that
the United States take action on the
European situation probably was
meant as a nudge in Ihe ribs for the
legislators, urging them to start
making reforms.
Yesterday it was suggested to
Congress that the Panama Canal be
closed to the navies of all nations
that have violated treaties, but the
neutrality bloc opposed this pro
posal and condemned the President's
advocating U. S. interference in the
international struggle.
lIAUNTED by fear of war that
may come, a Los Angeles high
school boy killed himself yesterday.
While this column is calculated to
produce no such result at Stanford,
those who have glanced at it on the
days when the European scene lias
appeared particularly black must
have felt a bit worried about the
permanence of peace.
Today we thankfully report a lull
in the storm. Mussolini has finished
wiping up Albania and has made
King Victor Emanuel monarch of
the tiny state. Italy's formal guar
anty of the integrity of Greece has
been accepted, and-the sun is shin
ing through the clouds.
But not for long.

This afternoon Prime Minister
Nevilel Chamberlain will address
the House of Commons, Premier
Edouard Daladier will issue a
formal statement to the world at
large. What they will both say
amounts to this—
"Mr. Mussolini, you had better
lay off Greece and Turkey. If you
don't we'll kick your teeth in."
Of course that's not the way they
will word it. The British govern
ment is being careful to make no
renunciation of the Anglo-Italian
pact, but at the same tune it feels
compelled to express disapproval of
the Albanian conquest and to sound
a warning against further extension
of the Fascist power.

4 CROSS the Channel the French
will be less tactful in expressing
their views on the situation. Real
ists to the core, they readily accept
the fact that Italian ambitions con
stitute a far greater threat to them
than to the English. If Hitler is
Chamberlain's nemesis, Mussolini is
surely Daladier's.
Britain may be subtle, France
may be blunt, but their policies co
incide. The expansion of Italy
must stop, or the democratic- al
lies will go to war.
