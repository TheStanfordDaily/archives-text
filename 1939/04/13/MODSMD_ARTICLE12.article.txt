# Early Tally of Farm Fund Falls Short of 1938 Record
## 
### 
"There seems to be a misunderstanding," said Chairman Jack Laney
last night when viewing the early Stanford Fund returns from the Class
of '39.
"Each senior is not expected to endow the University; just to contribute
something. Since each dollar given at this time is the equivalent of a $25
endowment for a year, it should be possible lor each senior to give some-

thing that will count, without
to go on relief," Laney concluded. |
Incomplete tabulations of the j
Stanford Fund campaign with about
half the time completed show that :
the number of contributors is about
two hundred less than last year. The i
Class of '38 holds the record with
385 seniors donating.
Early incomplete tabulation is as i
follows:
