# Nominees to Appear At Assembly Today
## Coldiron Fights Caucus System; Pat Adams Named In First All-Roble Caucus 
### HARRY PRESS 
Stanford's embryo politicians, worn out from two
rip-roaring days of caucuses, sub-caucuses, pacts,
"honor-hound" agreements, speeches, whispers, de
nials, and general madhouse, yesterday plodded brave
ly into the hard work of building Maginot lines to

protect their various fair-haired"
boys until Tuesday's election.
Out of the caucusy muck which
has plagued Stanford's pre-election
politics ever since student govern
ment came to the Farm like a trav
eling salesman, there appeared for
the first time a faint glimmer of
hope, lighted by Gene Coldiron.

Aji all-Row final in the choice
of A.S.U. vice-president appeared
to be inevitable with the declina
tion late last night of Kay Powell,
Ilall candidate. Still in the race
are Coline Upshaw and Jean Bol
ton.

Running on a purely independent j
ticket, free from any machine or j
caucus backing, Coldiron presented j
to the campus, in his campaign for !
the A.S.S.U. presidency, an inno- 1
vation in Stanford politics, plus a |
show of fortitude in bucking the I
various machine groups.
COLDIRON BUCKS CAUCUS
"The Row caucus," he said, "func- |
tioned as the independents expected, |
and groups advocating the inde- !
pendent 'above - boards' plan saw
that for themselves when they
looked in on the caucus and saw the j
choices of the pre-caucus, held in
the afternoon by a small group of
politicians, railroaded into office.
"The independent group has seen
in action the system it opposes, and
is now ready to throw it over in the I
hope that next year will see the
appearance of an honest, straight- :
forward primary plan that will nom- j
inate men truly representative of i
the groups that back them."
Coldiron enters the presidencj
race officially backed by no caucus, '
and opposed by Andy Stojkovich, Â«
Hall choice; Ken Cuthbertson, Row j
nominee; and Andries Deinum. I
DEINUM DARK HORSE
Deinum, a junior transfer from ;
the Netherlands, has done more by i
himself than any single group to
make Stanford socially conscious.'
This he has accomplished mainly'
through Campus Opinion letters |
concerning social questions, and his j
work on the Steinbeck Committee.
i
Backers of Deinum are unknown, |
but gossip, which no one will affirm !
or deny, whispers that he has a j
st.fong corps of Union hashers sup- j
porting him.
This is the first time that hashers j
have attempted to organize, politi- i
cally or otherwise, and if their can
didate is even only partially suc
cessful, the trend will have proved
itself strong enough to be extended
to other fields.
ZETES BACK CUTHBERTSON
Defeated in the run-off vote at i
the Row caucus by Cuthbertson, Bob i
Moulton yesterday issued the fol- j
lowing statement:
"On behalf of the 'political hell- i
raisers' at the Zete house, I wish to j
say that the Zete house, myself in
cluded, of course, stands solidly be
hind Delt Ken Cuthbertson. Sin
cere congratulations are in order for i
Ken, and he has mine."
Imitating Coldiron's campaign
methods, Roble women late Tuesday
night squashed an attempt of Row
men in Encina to call a freshman
Row caucus to pick iheir candidates,
both male and female, and instead
held an all-Roble confab to choose
their candidate for .secretary-treas
urer of the sophomore class.
ROBLE NAMES PAT ADAMS
Nominated over 11 other candi
dates was Pat Adams, Tridelt pledge.
All Roble women have given ver
bal approval to an "honor-bound"
pact, which provides that if any
other freshman woman is nominated
for the position of secretary-treas
urcr, she will decline in favor of
Miss Adams.
Showing that women in general
have not acquired the efficiency of
the women's nominating committee,
two nominations from each side of
the fence were filed for the positions
of senior and junior women on Ex
Committee.
