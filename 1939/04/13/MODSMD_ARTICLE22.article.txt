# Ramshead Scores In Play Reading
## 
### 
Play readings are a good thing, i
Stanford should definitely have more j
of them. The Ram.shead presentation
of the Kaufman-Ferber comedy was
excellent, and if the audience reac
tion was anything to judge by, there
will be more of them.
"Royal Family" is the story of the
Cavendishes, a family of actors, and
it is a fictionization of the life of the j
Drew-Barrymore clan. Fanny Cav- I
endish —Ellen Terry Drew actually— I
is the matriarch of the tribe, and I
Eloise Lambert in the part pre- j
sides over her temperamental wild- I
eyed family with an iron hand.
In a cast which was uniformly
excellent, it is difficult to pick stars, \
but Ash Wilson as Herbert Dean
and Barbara Thrasher as Julia Cav- !
endish were outstanding. Readings J
are informal and intimate, altogether !
a delightful way to see a play.— j
