# Excom Action Spells Doom For Junior Water Carnival
## 
### 
Complete cancellation of this
year's Junior Water Carnival seem
ed likely yesterday after Ex Com
mittee had refused to shift the date
ahead from May 5 to next Wednes
day.
Lake Lagunita continued to fall at
the rate of approximately three
inches per day—2,ooo.ooo gallons a
day is the amount lost, according to
the Department of Buildings and
Grounds.
Carl Phillips appeared before Ex
Committee Tuesday night, asking
that the water carnival be set ahead.
He quoted the grounds department
as saying next Wednesday is the
last day a carnival could be held
satisfactorily.
It was suggested that the program
might be run off at the Encina Pools,
as was done one year, although that
would mean elimination of floats, a
major item in former carnivals.
Other business of the Tuesday
night meeting follows:
FIELD DAY: When Andy Stojko
vich, president of Axe Society,
asked appropriation for $50 to help
the organization pay for the student
faoulty field day, next Wednesday,
Student Manager Tom Killefer

of rapid bargaining, he reached the
following agreement with Stojko
vich:
Axe Society was given permission
to solicit the houses and clubs for
contributions, the Associated Stu
dents to underwrite the project. Any
