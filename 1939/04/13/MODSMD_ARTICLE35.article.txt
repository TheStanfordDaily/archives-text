# Indian Underdogs to Face Champion Cal Netmen Today
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team takes on what is undoubtedly one of the top
aggregations of the country today with the last place Indians meeting the
league leading Hears in the first match of the annual two-match series on
the Berkeley courts today. Matches start at 2 o'clock.
While Coach Sherm Luckwood's players have been denied Conference

wins, once oy an 8-1 count ana orv<
three other occasions by 5-4 deci
sions, the California squad has run
through all coast competition with
out dropping more than two indi
vidual encounters in any one inter
team battle.
Topping the Bear team is Captain
Bob Harman, a senior who has three
times held national singles rankings.
But even a player who stands this
high in American tennis has been
pressed to head the Bear list this
year, lor both Bob Peacock and
Doug ImhofT have at times during
lhe season displaced Harman in the
number one spot.
LOW TO MEET HARMAN
Lockwood has decided to play
Bob Low against Harman in the
feature singles engagement with
Captain Jim Seaver and Dave
Brock in second and third places, re
spectively. Lloyd Gates, who has
added some strength to the Indian
line-up since last quarter, will be in
fourth place, followed by Myron
Folsom and Jack Laney.
Man for man, the Stanford team
cannot be conceded more than an
outside chance of upsetting the Bears
today, but last week-end the Farm
men showed they could play good
tennis and there should be more
than one close match In today's en
counter.
BEARS FAVORED
Stanford's doubles teams will be
Seaver and Low, Brock and Bud
Biorkman, and Gates and Stan Ow
en. California's pairs will probably
be ImholT and Peacock, Harman and
Dan Roberts, and Tate Coulthard
and Bill Hoogs. A cardinal victory
in any one of these doubles matches
must be considered an upset with
all three of the Bear teams having
the edge in tournament experience.
While the varsity tackles Cal, the
frosh, led by Captain Larry Dee,
will be out for a triumph over the
Cal Cubs with the matches begin
ning at 1:30 o'clock. The feature
match will pit Dee against Bill
Swan, newest Bay region junior
sensation.
