# Track Records Fall in Twilight
## Zagar, Hawkins Top Year's Coast Marks 
### 
The wintry blasts that, swept An
gell Field during last evening's twi- j
light meet have numbed the 150 j
I spectators but it certainly stung j
; Dink Templeton's cindermen into as- '
i tounding activity. Led by Clyde;
Jeffrey, Pete Zagar, and Bill Hawk- •
j ins, the Curds broke several per- |
j sonal records and recorded three of
I the best performances for the year
lon the Coast in their respective
| events.
I Jeffrey opened the assault ongtime |
I and distance by rambling through j
| the quarter mile in 47.8. Jeff had '
j runners in front of him at the start j
'• with handicaps up to 25 yards and,
1 though he didn't win the race, he
turned in a mighty sweet perform- 1
! ance for a comparative beginner at
this distance.
i Templeton's weight men were at;
i work again yesterday. Most out- ]
| standing toss was that of Zagar's in I
the discus, which soared 1(55 ft. 3 in., j
• the best effort turned in by college 1
I men on the Coast this season. Bill ,
Wohle did his share by flinging the
i shot thrice over 52 feet, the farthest
effort being 52 ft. 5 in.
But the real accomplishment of j
I the afternoon was Bill Hawkins blis- j
! tering flight of high hurdles. Against,
the wind fcnd pressed all the way by
team-mate Sid Hayes, "Hawk" sail- |
I ed through in 14.4, the best confer- i
1 ence time in this event accomplished
on the Coast this year. Hayes was |
right at the winner's elbow and must :
have hit between 14.5 and 14.6 —a i
mighty good performance consider- !
ing the fact that it is Sid's first com
petitive barrier race in 10 days.
Overshadowed by the other out- I
standing deeds of a windy after- j
noon was "Mushy" Girard's ex- I
pected breaking of 4:20 in the mile j
run. "Mush" ground the four laps |
in 4:18.1, thus giving California's Mr. |
Cole full warning of a good battle i
to comc.

the wind fcnd pressed all the way by
team-mate Sid Hayes, "Hawk" sail- |
I ed through in 14.4, the best confer- i
1 ence time in this event accomplished
on the Coast this year. Hayes was |
right at the winner's elbow and must :
have hit between 14.5 and 14.6 —a i
mighty good performance consider- !
ing the fact that it is Sid's first com
petitive barrier race in 10 days.
Overshadowed by the other out- I
standing deeds of a windy after- j
noon was "Mushy" Girard's ex- I
pected breaking of 4:20 in the mile j
run. "Mush" ground the four laps |
in 4:18.1, thus giving California's Mr. |
Cole full warning of a good battle i
to comc.
The wintry blasts that, swept An
gell Field during last evening's twi- j
light meet have numbed the 150 j
I spectators but it certainly stung j
; Dink Templeton's cindermen into as- '
i tounding activity. Led by Clyde;
Jeffrey, Pete Zagar, and Bill Hawk- •
j ins, the Curds broke several per- |
j sonal records and recorded three of
I the best performances for the year
lon the Coast in their respective
| events.
I Jeffrey opened the assault ongtime |
I and distance by rambling through j
| the quarter mile in 47.8. Jeff had '
j runners in front of him at the start j
'• with handicaps up to 25 yards and,
1 though he didn't win the race, he
turned in a mighty sweet perform- 1

this distance.

the discus, which soared 1(55 ft. 3 in., j
