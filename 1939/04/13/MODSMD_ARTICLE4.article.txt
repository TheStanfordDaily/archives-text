# Dr. Luck Talks On 'Co-operatives'
## 
### 
Naming the consumer a "poor
sucker," Dr. Murray Luck, associate
professor of biochemistry, spoke on
"Co-operatives" at yesterday's meet
ing of the Luncheon Club.
Dr. Luck, who has made a study
of the co-operatives in England and
also is interested in the one in Palo
Alto, stated that the producer and
distributor sell their goods for maxi
mum profit rather than for quality
of the product. This results in a
great deal of high pressure sales
manship and advertising.
"There are some co-operatives in
the United States," he said, "but
they arc mostly in the Middle West,
where immigrants have brought in
ideas from business in their native
lands. At present," he continued,
"the work for improvement is being
done through the producers and
distributors rather lhan the con
sumer, where it should be accom
plished."
Favoring co-operatives, Dr. Luck
sees a need for a balance between
them and private enterprise such as
has been accomplished in England,
where often the co-operatives have
their own manufacturers, one-sixth
of the business being handled in this
way.
