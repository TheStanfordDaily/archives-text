# Card Division Champs Swing Against Cal Golfers Tomorrow
## 
### 
With the first individual confer-I
ence golf match of the year set for j
tomorrow afternoon at Berkeley with ;
the California Bears, Coach Eddie
Twiggs has been running his, south
ern division champions through j
eight practice rounds.
In Wednesday's tune-ups Don j
Kennedy returned to his old form j
by shooting a 71 and defeating j
George Bradley. Jack Showalter!
also showed improvement by taking
a round over Ren Sutton.
Twiggs is resting Warren Berl, No. i
1 Indian, who won the conference 1
championship last week-end so that i
he will be in top form tomorrow.
Berl should do well against Willard
McCay of Cal, who won the inter
collegiate title last year at Del
Monte.
Don Haslett, who came second in j
last week-end's Four-way tourna- i
ment, and Dick Wright are both in j
top condition. Bud Finger, other |
first-stringer and medalist in the ]
Four-way meet, was vaccinated
Monday so has been out of practice j
except for a light workout yester- i
day.
Four extra men will go along to
Cal, according to Twiggs, as re
serves. They are Ren Sutton, Bill
Brigham. Paul Rudolph, and George 1
Bradley.
Tomorrow's play will consist of ;
i two rounds, the singles set for the
morning, and the l'our-ball match j
i play scheduled in the afternoon, i
Stanford is strong in the singles, as
was evidenced last week, but Cal J
took honors in the team play at the '
I Four-way tourney.

Until the Four-way tournament
the Indians were the underdogs in
the minds oi other schools because
all four of the team that won the
national collegiate title last sum
mer had graduated from the varsity.
Twiggs, who turned out Lawson
Little, worked together an entirely
new team that he had plenty of
confidence in, but with the draw
back of inexperience. Now that the
Cards have the most important vic
tory of the year under their belts,
they can no longer be called inex
perienced and are set to go place.

perienced and are set to go place.
With the first individual confer-I
ence golf match of the year set for j
tomorrow afternoon at Berkeley with ;
the California Bears, Coach Eddie
Twiggs has been running his, south
ern division champions through j
eight practice rounds.
In Wednesday's tune-ups Don j
Kennedy returned to his old form j
by shooting a 71 and defeating j
George Bradley. Jack Showalter!
also showed improvement by taking
a round over Ren Sutton.
Twiggs is resting Warren Berl, No. i
1 Indian, who won the conference 1
championship last week-end so that i
he will be in top form tomorrow.
Berl should do well against Willard
McCay of Cal, who won the inter
collegiate title last year at Del
Monte.
Don Haslett, who came second in j
last week-end's Four-way tourna- i
ment, and Dick Wright are both in j
top condition. Bud Finger, other |
first-stringer and medalist in the ]
Four-way meet, was vaccinated
Monday so has been out of practice j
except for a light workout yester- i
day.
Four extra men will go along to
Cal, according to Twiggs, as re
serves. They are Ren Sutton, Bill
Brigham. Paul Rudolph, and George 1
Bradley.
Tomorrow's play will consist of ;
i two rounds, the singles set for the
morning, and the l'our-ball match j
i play scheduled in the afternoon, i
Stanford is strong in the singles, as
was evidenced last week, but Cal J
took honors in the team play at the '
I Four-way tourney.

Until the Four-way tournament
the Indians were the underdogs in
the minds oi other schools because
all four of the team that won the
national collegiate title last sum
mer had graduated from the varsity.
Twiggs, who turned out Lawson
Little, worked together an entirely
new team that he had plenty of
confidence in, but with the draw
back of inexperience. Now that the
Cards have the most important vic
tory of the year under their belts,
they can no longer be called inex
perienced and are set to go place.
