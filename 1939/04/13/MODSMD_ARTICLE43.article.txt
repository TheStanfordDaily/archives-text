# Yearling Tank Stars Practice To Sink Bears
## Meet Swim Records Scheduled to Fall; Tilt at Berkeley 
### 
Leaving a foaming wake of Na
tional Collegiate, Pacific Coast, i
A.A.U., and nil-time Stanford Uni
versity records behind them, the j
spectacular Encina tidal wave will !
descend upon the Berkeley pools
Saturday, highly favored in their'
meet with the Bear Babes to pour
it on "poor Cal."
Classed by swimming authorities'
as the best frosh swimming aggre
gation in the country (some East- j
emers still say that this title should 1
go to their Yale frosh) the Card
yearling mermen are favored to let :
Cal get only two or possibly three

Possibility that Roy Winkel
mann, champion varsity diver,
will not be able to compete
against Cal in the Big Meet this
Saturday was reported to The
Daily last night.

of the nine first places of the meet..
This, however, will merely be
carrying out a long-standing tradi-
I tionâ€”Cal has won only three of the j
frosh Big Meets in the space of 22
years.
It is also highly probable that all
Stanford-Cal meet records except
one will be relegated to the oblivion 1
of dusty back pages in the record
book. The one which will not be
broken is the 150 back-stroke mark
set by Bill Weeden of last year's !
Card frosh.
Cal will possibly set new records ,
in the two events which they fire |
doped to win, the 50 and the 100-
yard free-style. Bearcub Captain
Marshall Lloyd is favored in these
j two events unless Captain Paul
| Herron of the Card frosh decides |
that he would like to have his name
i on the books as holding three indi
, vidual records instead of two and
i the relay. In this case he will swim
the hundred and possibly will set
the new record.
Herron is a cinch to take the 220
and 440 free-style. The meet rec
ords in these two events are held by
present captain of the Stanford var
sity, Win Needham. If Herron swims
the hundred also it will probably
I mean defeat for the free-style relay,
