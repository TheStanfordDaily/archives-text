# To Stanford's Loyal Son
## 
### 
IN the light of the events that fill each spring
quarter, one date always seems to pass
quietly unnoticed—April 13.
That is the birthday of the man who lives on
the Knoll; the man who has guided Stanford's
destiny for 23 years.
In the complacency of its everyday existence,
Stanford has forgotten the date each year most
probably because of the simple modesty of
the man whose birthday it is, the President of
the University.
The fact that today is Dr. Wilbur's birthday,
he probably regards as a more or less unim
portant fact. To the University, however, it is
an opportune time to make known its appre
ciation to him.
For 23 years, Stanford has known him for
his long strides, his dry wit; it is with regret
that Stanford must recognize his sixty-fourth
birthday, for that means retirement next year.
Stanford will miss his brisk walk each morning
from the house on the Knoll, through the Quad,
to his office in the Administration Building and
his leisurely stroll each evening, retracing those
same steps, in the twilight shadows of Stan
ford's leafy trees.
That retirement, however, will mean only an
assignment of administrative duties—for it is
certain that Dr. Wilbur will continue to work
for Stanford then, as now.
For 23 years, Dr. Wilbur has loved this Uni
versity, loved it as much as any man can. Out
of that love, has come success for Stanford and
success for him.
In 1896, Dr. Wilbur himself graduated from
the University; for 43 years, he has remained a
ioyal son of Stanford.
On his sixty-fourth birthday, and in the midst
of its politics, its dances, its cross-currents,
Stanford may well pause a moment today, wish
Dr. Wilbur a heartfelt Happy Birthday.
