# Line on the Right
## 
### 
FOR a long, long time—"What's the matter
with the machine? Caucuses are dirty poli
tics; Stanford's democracy isn't working right."
Today, the Farm gets a chance to look over
its potential student body officers. In the as
sembly this morning, from 8:45 to 9:15 o'clock,
H. B. Lee will introduce 37 candidates for elec
tion to office next Tuesday.
And right there, if Stanford will only realize
it, is the answer to one of its pressing political
questions: the opportunity for the voter to know
whom and for what he's voting.
So, despite the confusion of the caucus sys
tem—which, its critics to the contrary, seems
to have lined up a list of potentially fine officers
—the voter can this morning untangle the mess,
if he gives himself the chance.
Politics have finished the high-pressure stage;
the rest is up to Stanford's electorate; that is,
to make the final choice. It's certain that that
choice would be better based on concrete in
formation than on by guess and by gosh.
And all the electorate has to do is make use
of the machinery provided.
