BACK toward the middle of the last century,
the wife of Mr. Justice Clifford of the United
States Supreme Court wrote to her husband to
ask his approval of her joining a temperance
society organized by the women of her little
New England town. Without intending any
levity, the least-sophisticated high court judge
in history replied that he disapproved on the
basis that the women of the town had high
moral standards and would not be likely to
take to drink.
In forbidding his wife to organize, Mr. Clif
ford did a very commendable thing. There is
nothing more troublesome than an organized
woman—as any man can testify.
This year Women's Conference, Stanford's
fortress of virtue, decided to nominate its own
candidates for all women's offices in order to
keep their petticoats from trailing in the guag
mire of the caucuses.
The method of selection, as exercised to date,
is undoubtedly democratic. Conference inter
views and considers every woman who wants

to run; the presidents of every women's living
group make the selections. The nominees are
entered in the election race without caucus
approval.
In a sense this innovation constitutes a revolt,
a protest against the organized political ma
chines. Clubwomen are behind it. Nothing
could be more formidable.
The fact that a woman does not receive Con
ference backing does not mean that she cannot
run for election, but it certainly will put her at a
woeful disadvantage. But at the same time the
new system is far better qualified to select the
best candidates than are a group of male politi
cos, shifting their cigars to the corners of their
mouths to claim a prospect is a "good man" or
a "good gal."
It may well be that Conference nominations
are indicative of a trend away from the caucus
system, once considered indispensable to Stan
ford democracy. Women are showing men the
way to run politics.
And they call it the weaker sex.—L. L.
