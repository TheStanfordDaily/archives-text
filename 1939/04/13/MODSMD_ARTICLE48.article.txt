NOT TONIGHT, JOSEPHINE
VIDENTLY training in military science at Stanford
is not monopolized by the R.O.T.C. boys. At Ex
Committee meeting Tuesday night, the embattled grad
uate women displayed a knowledge of strategy that a
general staff couldn't top. They demanded and were
granted a constitutional amendment on next Tues
day's ballot, which if passed would require one of the
two graduate members of Ex Committee to be a
woman.
Last winter the graduate women brought up their
heavy political artillery, campaigned on a love-of
home-and-Mother platform, and managed to elect one
of (he Excom members. But last winter was not typ
ical, and the high command knows it. The women vot
ers were fascinated with the idea of grabbing a job
that had never been grabbed before. The votes of the
male section of the electorate were split, and the men
were inclined to pat the girls on the head and tell
them to get back to their committee meetings.
* * * *
Besides that, the women found a candidate who
turned out to be probably the best in the field. She
was capable, and she had experience in student gov
ernment.
But next year, the scenario may be different. The
women will have gone back under the welter of com
mittees and councils. The men will be warily antag
onistic. The only available candidate may be a
Y.W.C.A. sub-chairman.
* <1 '•!< *
A ND SO the women are falling back on military sci
± ence. They are trying to fortify themselves be
hind the constitution where no amount of electoral
shell-fire can dislodge them. They want an amendment
to barricade their new position.
All of this is excellent strategy; but the fact is that
even under the illegitimate theory of political science
that prevails in Stanford government, the women don't
deserve a constitutional stranglehold on the job.
In numbers the women can marshal only 165 grad
uates against 756 men. This is after the 167 men in
mod school in the city have been subtracted from the
total. This gives the men a four-to-one proportion
among the graduates; in the regular classes where
women's rights are bolted to the constitution the ratio
is only about two to one.
* * * *
More than this, the law of averages won't permit
the graduate women to scare up a good candidate
every year. Many of the women are apprentice school
teachers; few have any experience with student gov
ernment.
As long as the graduate women can use the present
machinery to get a member on Excom ,they can justify
themselves by all the laws of God and man. But if
they crawl behind the constitution, they become a
minority group, clinging to an office when neither
numbers nor abilitv gives them title.
It's really not a bit ladylike.

A ND SO the women are falling back on military sci
± ence. They are trying to fortify themselves be
hind the constitution where no amount of electoral
shell-fire can dislodge them. They want an amendment
to barricade their new position.
All of this is excellent strategy; but the fact is that
even under the illegitimate theory of political science
that prevails in Stanford government, the women don't
deserve a constitutional stranglehold on the job.
In numbers the women can marshal only 165 grad
uates against 756 men. This is after the 167 men in
mod school in the city have been subtracted from the
total. This gives the men a four-to-one proportion
among the graduates; in the regular classes where
women's rights are bolted to the constitution the ratio
is only about two to one.
* * * *
More than this, the law of averages won't permit
the graduate women to scare up a good candidate
every year. Many of the women are apprentice school
teachers; few have any experience with student gov
ernment.
As long as the graduate women can use the present
machinery to get a member on Excom ,they can justify
themselves by all the laws of God and man. But if
they crawl behind the constitution, they become a
minority group, clinging to an office when neither
numbers nor abilitv gives them title.
It's really not a bit ladylike.
NOT TONIGHT, JOSEPHINE
VIDENTLY training in military science at Stanford
is not monopolized by the R.O.T.C. boys. At Ex
Committee meeting Tuesday night, the embattled grad
uate women displayed a knowledge of strategy that a
general staff couldn't top. They demanded and were
granted a constitutional amendment on next Tues
day's ballot, which if passed would require one of the
two graduate members of Ex Committee to be a
woman.
Last winter the graduate women brought up their
heavy political artillery, campaigned on a love-of
home-and-Mother platform, and managed to elect one
of (he Excom members. But last winter was not typ
ical, and the high command knows it. The women vot
ers were fascinated with the idea of grabbing a job
that had never been grabbed before. The votes of the
male section of the electorate were split, and the men
were inclined to pat the girls on the head and tell
them to get back to their committee meetings.
* * * *
Besides that, the women found a candidate who
turned out to be probably the best in the field. She
was capable, and she had experience in student gov
ernment.
But next year, the scenario may be different. The
women will have gone back under the welter of com
mittees and councils. The men will be warily antag
onistic. The only available candidate may be a
Y.W.C.A. sub-chairman.
