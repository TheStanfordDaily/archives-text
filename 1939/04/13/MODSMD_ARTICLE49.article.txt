One of the Hall boys (I'm sure it would gall him to
be called a Hall boy or a Hall anything or an any
thing, boy) is an economic royalist, a member of the
American nobility by his own confession.
And how he loves to make that confession. He is
happy when he has a loyal group of subjects gath
ered around him in the hall, and he can tell ihem about
nobility, his nobility, the nobility in his home town.
"Why, we have one hotel there," he told them one
day, "that you can't stay there, no matter how much
money you have, if you are not a true aristocrat."
He probably told them it was the noblest place in
America.
His subjects were loyal to a point, but beyond that
point they were skeptical.
They sent a telegram down south to that hotel ask
ing for reservations over the coming week-end. An
immediate reply came back welcoming them with
open arms.
They showed the telegram to their royalist friend.
Ho hasn't spoken to them since.

OUTRAGE

Most of us have lapsed into a sort of passive accept
ance of the Library fountain. What can we do, we
said. But things have gone too far.
The fountain, they found, was using so much water
that it came to Ihe point where either it must go, or
the drinking fountain inside had to go.
They took the one inside out. There is nothing
which automatically makes everyone as thirsty as
walking into Ihe Library. And they took the fountain
out.
It's enough to drive a man to drink.
I was reading a story in the Library yesterday
morning about three white men and a native who were
becalmed in a southern sea on a raft. Their supplies
were limited. The three white men got something
like a thimble-full of water a day. The native got
nothing.
You could see their parched skin, the hot sliminess
of the ocean water. You read of their terrible thirst,
and soon their thirst was your thirst.
And there you were; in the Library and the Library
has no drinking fountain.
I stayed with my book as long as I could. It was
too much. I had to have a drink of cold, sparkling
water. I closed my book and rushed out of the
Library.
I found the outside fountain remarkably ill suited
and uncomfortable for drinking purposes. I came
avv.tj from it wet, all right, but still thirsty.

The fountain, they found, was using so much water
that it came to Ihe point where either it must go, or
the drinking fountain inside had to go.
They took the one inside out. There is nothing
which automatically makes everyone as thirsty as
walking into Ihe Library. And they took the fountain
out.
It's enough to drive a man to drink.
I was reading a story in the Library yesterday
morning about three white men and a native who were
becalmed in a southern sea on a raft. Their supplies
were limited. The three white men got something
like a thimble-full of water a day. The native got
nothing.
You could see their parched skin, the hot sliminess
of the ocean water. You read of their terrible thirst,
and soon their thirst was your thirst.
And there you were; in the Library and the Library
has no drinking fountain.
I stayed with my book as long as I could. It was
too much. I had to have a drink of cold, sparkling
water. I closed my book and rushed out of the
Library.
I found the outside fountain remarkably ill suited
and uncomfortable for drinking purposes. I came
avv.tj from it wet, all right, but still thirsty.
BLUE BLOOD

One of the Hall boys (I'm sure it would gall him to
be called a Hall boy or a Hall anything or an any
thing, boy) is an economic royalist, a member of the
American nobility by his own confession.
And how he loves to make that confession. He is
happy when he has a loyal group of subjects gath
ered around him in the hall, and he can tell ihem about
nobility, his nobility, the nobility in his home town.
"Why, we have one hotel there," he told them one
day, "that you can't stay there, no matter how much
money you have, if you are not a true aristocrat."
He probably told them it was the noblest place in
America.
His subjects were loyal to a point, but beyond that
point they were skeptical.
They sent a telegram down south to that hotel ask
ing for reservations over the coming week-end. An
immediate reply came back welcoming them with
open arms.
They showed the telegram to their royalist friend.
Ho hasn't spoken to them since.

OUTRAGE

Most of us have lapsed into a sort of passive accept
ance of the Library fountain. What can we do, we
said. But things have gone too far.
