### 
"THE MARCH OF MEDICINE,"
by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur. Pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press, and on sale at the Book
store.
Bridging the last 25 years from
his first address before the American
Academy of Medicine to a dedica
tory address at Syracuse University
in 19.17, this collection of speeches by
Dr. Wilbur constitutes a history of
medical progress.
Symbolizing medical development
in the last quarter century, its
gi'owth from the horse-and-buggy
stage to the sleek modernism of the
present day, these 29 addresses
treat subjects that range for "The
Eclipse of Magic in Medicine" to
"The Place of the Hospital in the
Practice of Medicine."
"It happens that the period of my
life as medical student, practitioner,
teacher, and administrator began
just as the commercial medical
school and the plug hat went out,
and the university medical school
and the modern specialist came in.
While I was still a student of phys
iology, Koch's discovery of the tu
bercle bacillus was fermenting the
scientific thought of the world,
typhoid fever was largely accepted
as inevitable, and the cause of
syphilis was unknown," Dr. Wilbur
says.
In a style that is as clear and defi
nite as the physician's mind, Dr.
Wilbur paints a fascinating word
picture of one of the greatest eras
of medical development, a time he
memorized intimately by having
lived through it. With words that
are clear and strong he points the
way for the medical student, physi

eian of the future. From time to
time flashes of rare humor temper
the hard conciseness of his words.
But "The March of Medicine" is
no more a book of the past than it
is of the future. Its view is for
ward; its direction is toward a hori
zon-line of knowledge that doctors
of a modern world may penetrate
in their search for an anodyne
against human suffering.â€”Hutchin
