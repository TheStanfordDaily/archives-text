clamored for attention, Stanford j
was willing to let them have their j

trained between week-ends by run
ning up and down the seats of the
stadium. But is it not going a little j
too far when certain members of j
the team, ironically those who had I
been most interested in recognition,!
wear track shoes on the stadium j
seats?

' Stanford track fans continue to
j watch meets without bleachers —
; because the B. AC. had to spend
! its money repairing stadium seats.
A skier's track shoes have chawed
I some of those seats to fiber—and the
Stanford track team continues to run
on an open field,
