# Student Rates Offered Farm For 'Tovarich'
## Alumni Association Will Repeat Popular Comedy Saturday 
### 
Students can see the Alumni As
sociation's production of "Tovarich"
Saturday night at half price if they
present their student body cards in
buying tickets, according to Lee
Emerson Bassctt, chairman of the
play committee.
Saturday's production is a return
performance, the play having been
produced first last Saturday. It is
being shown a second time for stu
dents unable to attend last week
because of the Easter week-end.
STRANDED ROYALTY
The international comedy "Tova
rich" was written by Jacques Deval
and has been adapted by Robert E.
Sherwood.
The play tells the story of two
very, very Bohemian white Russians
stranded in Paris after the revolu
tion with absolutely nothing but four
billion gold francs and a bed. And
they have pledged themselves not
to touch a cent of the money.
Suddenly they find themselves
raised from their artichoke-stealing
status to the position of servants in
the household of a French banker.
From then on, as the French banker
and his whole family find they have
very unusual servants, develop
ments come fast and thick.
CAST EXCELLENT
Considered particularly excellent
are Melba Rae Toombs as the Grand
Duchess, James Clancy as Prince
Mikhail, and William Pabst as Com
missar Gorotchenko.
Proceeds will go to the Alumni
Association's two dramatics schol
arships.
