# Five Days Remain For Skit Scrips
## 
### 
With one script already turned in,
Spring Show writers have five more
days to submit manuscripts to Rams
Head President J. P. Cahn.
Time allowed hopeful writers has
been extended until next Monday,
since performance of the annual
spring musical has been postponed.
Cahn has asked for completed, or
nearly completed, manuscripts rather
than only unfinished sketches.
At the same time show music in
lead-sheet, form is to accompany
manuscripts submitted. Independent
song writers also may turn in music
whether it is written to fit any par
ticular show or is by itself.
