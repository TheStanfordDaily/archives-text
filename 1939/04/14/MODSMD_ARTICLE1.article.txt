as in centuries past, the
unknown quantity in the Euro
pean equation is Russia. Somehow
this mysterious land seems to exist
in a sphere apart from the score of
bickering national states on Ihe
Continent.
Perhaps it is the late arrival of
the industrial revolution in the
Soviet Republics, their comparative
geographic isolation, the fact they
really are as Asiatic as they are Eu
ropean. In any case, Russia is
holding herself aloof from the cur
rent bickering, half-heartedly op
posing the Rome-Berlin axis on
ideological grounds and giving little
encouragement to the stop-Hitler
alliance.
I|l « *
Undoubtedly Stalin and his
commissars clearly remember the
role of Tsarist Russia in the last
World War. One of the lirst acts
of the revolutionary government
was to withdraw from the conflict,
and the Communists still regard
with suspicion the quarrels of the
western states.
Despite the persistent efforts of
England and France to lure Stalin
into their anti-totalitarian league,
the Russian dictator continues to
give them the cold shoulder. Per
haps it isn't such a bad idea.

England and France
sounded their expected warnings
against invasions of Greece and its
possessions. What surprised Eu
rope's brass-hats was that they also
announced that they will protect
Rumanian territory against aggres
sion. Not. only are the strategic Greek
ports in the Mediterranean closed to
Hitler and Mussolini, but also the
wheat lands and oil fields of Ru
mania.

Premier Daladier had made up
his mind to include this important
Balkan state in his declaration of
policy, and he contacted the hesi
tant Mr. Chamberlain to persuade
him to support the move. The
British Prime Minister hated to do
anything so rash, but rather than
weaken the Anglo-French alliance,
lie acquiesced.

Two more links are added to the
chain which England is trying to
forge around Nazi Germany. With
France, Poland, Greece, and Ru
mania ready to resist any aggres
sive move by Herr Hitler, there re
main but two major gaps in the iron
noose.
And both of these lead to
Russia.
To the Reich, the U.S.S.R. is the
source of all evil, the realm of the
Bolsheviks, the nemesis of Nazi
dom. Furthermore, the miles of yel
low wheat fields on the steppes and
in the Ukraine are exactly what
Germany needs to solve her food
shortage problem.

Mr. Chamberlain's polite efforts to
bring Jugoslavia into his alliance,
he has met with no success in that
direction. As a matter of fact, the
object of his interest, optimistically
enough, is looking to Rome and
Berlin to guarantee her territorial
integrity.
Russia may lock herself in a logic
tight compartment in order to stay
out of war, but indications are that
in the long run she will come out
in the thick of the battle. Poland
lives next, door to the U.S.S.R., and
Germany seems ready to violate
Polish rights in Danzig and the
Corridor.
Whether war starts there, or as a
result of a Nazi drive through Jugo
slavia into the wheat country, the
Soviet will be involved. Today Rus
sia is a force to reckon with. In
1014-17 .she was economically re
tarded and politically disintegrated.
Today she has man-power, super
efficient military organization, eco
nomic wealth, and a strong central
