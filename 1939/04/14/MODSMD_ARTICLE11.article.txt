# Alumni Prepare Brochure To Record Senior Week
## 
### 
To give seniors a permanent rec
ord of Senior Week activities, the
Alumni Association is preparing an
illustrated brochure covering grad
uation exercises and such events as
laying of the class plate.
Announcing preparation of the
booklet, Robert A. (Bones) Hamil
ton, alumni director, took the oppor
tunity of enumerating advantages
of membership in the Alumni Asso
ciation.
Since Senior Week comes too late
for coverage in the Quad or The
Daily, this will be the only record
of these activities, Mr. Hamilton
pointed out.
BROCHURE FOR SENIORS
The brochure is to be presented to
seniors who join the Alumni Asso
ciation during the current member
ship drive, which is scheduled to
close Saturday, according to John
Cobbs, whose committee is planning
the publication. The drive is being
carried on in conjunction with the
annual Stanford Fund Drive.
Besides an account of Senior
Week, the brochure will contain re
productions of 16 color plates of
scenes around the University. The
plates first appeared in the Alumni
book, "50 Years on the Quad." Since
many requests for the pictures have
been made, they will be suitable for
framing.
PRIMARY PURPOSE
Primary purpose of the Alumni
Association Is to provide former
students with an articulate repre
sentative here on the campus, Mr.
Hamilton said.
Important as a unifying influence
is the association's file, kept in its
offices in the Administration Build
ing, of all 35,000 students who have

attended Stanford. Address, place |
of work, class affiliation, parents' j
names, and degrees and honors of |
each are catalogued here. *
Two secretaries are kept at work
on the file all the time, and tracers
arc sent out every day. One of the
chief uses of the catalogue is in fa
cilitating business contacts.
KEEP IN TOUCH
Another is keeping the Alumni
Association's 90 Stanford clubs
throughout the country in close
touch and integrating their influence
on University affairs. "The clubs i
are the spokes and the Stanford of- j
fice is the hub of the alumni wheel," j
is the way Mr. Hamilton puts it.
According to the new constitution, j
put. into effect last year, alumni j
opinion will be brought to bear by
an annual assembly of delegates j
representing proportionally all ,
clubs and societies, and all classes |
from '92 to the present. First meet- |
ing of the assembly will be held j
May 6, University Day, in the little I
theater of Memorial Hall.
OPINION POLL
Alumni opinion also is made ef- ,
fective through the Poll of Stanford j
Opinion, ballots for which went out j
to 28,000 alumni. Typical questions i
have been, "Do you favor abolish- I
ing the American system of compe- j
titive intercollegiate sports?" and j
"Do you want to see the New Deal
survive as against a more conserva- j
tive form of government?"
Results of the poll have been pub- !
fished in successive editions of the j
Illustrated Review.
To give alumni up and down the I
coast some idea of academic work j
being done at Stanford, the associa-
tion this year held for the seventh |
time its annual series of alumni j
conferences. At Portland, Seattle, j
Los Angeles, and Stanford, the con- |
ferences were held during Febru
ary and March this year. Plans are I
being made for a New York con- j
ference next year.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, in
a recent statement commending the j
Alumni Conference, termed it "a
unique feature which has brought
real distinction to the University and !
to its graduates."
"To see and hear the Stanford
faculty of today in action," he said,
"is one of the best ways to bring ;
back those Stanford days which
have so much to all of us."
Stressing the Alumni Association's '
function as a service organization, j
Mr. Hamilton explained that mem- j
bers of the senior class are being j
given a year's membership at half \
price—s2—because of the employ- j
ment problems that will be facing I
new graduates.
