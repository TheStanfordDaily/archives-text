# Monday Deadline For Study Change
## 
### 
In a notice from the Registrar's
office, attention of students was yes
terday drawn to the fact that Mon
day, April 17, is the last day for
filing change-of-study cards to cover
any changes in program for the pres
ent quarter without fine. These
changes must be filed in the office
of the Registrar.
Similarly, changes in physical
education courses must be covered
not only through the offices of the
Departments of Physical Education,
but also through the Registrar's
Office. Changes taken care of in the
offices of the Women's Gymnasium
or the Board of Athletic Control do
not exempt from fine those students
who fail to turn in a revised study
list at the Registrar's Office.
