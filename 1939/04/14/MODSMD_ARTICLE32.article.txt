# Indian Rugbymen Set for All-stars
## 
### 
Of all the rugby teams who are j
scheduled to meet the Canadian All-
Stars Stanford has the best chance j
of beating them when they meet
them tomorrow, according to l
Harry Maloney. In the practice held '
on Tuesday the whole team showed !
up for one of the best workouts j
they have had, giving ample proof i
of their ability as a really fast bunch
of ruggers with a good series of l
passing attacks which carried the
ball over the goal almost every!
time.
Maloney believes that the Stan- j
ford ruggers will have the only J
honest chance to show their rugby |
skill against the Canadians, who
play an orthodox style of rugby
that will allow the ruggers to play ;
rugby as it should be played. Too !
much of the ordinary run of col
lege rugby has a strong football
flavor to it, preventing a great deal
of the plays and skill attached to a
true style of rugby.
The game tomorrow will be the
second in a series of four games to
be played by the Canadians. The
third game is slated for Wednesday,
April 19, for U.S.F. but. it is prob
able that Stanford will take this
date if the Dons fail to get up a
team. The final game is set for the
Northern California Rugby Club,
composed of players from the Uni
versity Club and the Olympic Club.
Tickets for the game tomorrow can
be secured from Harry Maloney at
a cost of 25 cents.
