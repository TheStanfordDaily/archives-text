THERE IS more than one way for
a good little man to knock a good
big man ofT his perch. The case of
Harry Wolter, a comparative mite of
a man, vs. Pete Zagar, a gent of con
siderable proportions, is a living ex
ample of the old, old adage.
It all happened last Tuesday as
Wolter, coach of the Stanford base
ball team, in case you didn't know,
was knocking fly balls to his out
fielders with a long, willowy fungo
bat. Zagar, seeking relaxation before
his daily discus duel, had climbed
high on top of the right field foul
line fence, about 25 yards from
where Wolter was firing.
Then Pete, in his always quiet and
soothing voice, started heckling him
and finally challenged Wolter to
knock him off his pinnacle. Wolter
hesitated, but Zagar kept on prod
ding him.
The razz was too much. Wolter
turned around toward the fence,
gave his last warning, and fungoed
one that hit the champ high on the
chest. It was a blow for the books
that had Zagar wavering 011 the
brim. The coach insists he can do
just as well every time, and while
the truth of his assertion is odubtful,
the truth of his assertion is doubtful,
noon.
Maybe he was praying for the
time when Wolter came over to visit
him in the discus ring.
STANFORD'S RUGBY, goes in
ternational tomorrow afternoon on
Treasure Island. The on-again, off
again series with the British Co
lumbia All-Stars is under way again
with the Canucks already holding a
19-16 victory over California.
Just about all the credit for the
current series has to be heaped upon
the head of Harry Maloney, Stan
lord's minor sports director and ad
visory rugby coach. Maloney went
ahead with plans for the tourney
even after Exposition officials had
thumbed the idea as financially un
wise. As president of the Northern
California Rugby Union, Maloney
sicced committee after committee on
the Fair officials, finally convinced
them that the Canadian-Californian
affair would be a boon to island
publicity in the Northwest and in
Canada. *
You have to thank, too, the team
members who have gone on practic
ing for nearly a month for one short
game. No letters, no scholarships, j
no hashing jobs, no nothing. They're
playing for love of the game and of j
competition and nothing else. A
little more of the same attitude in
other sports wouldn't be devastating
in the least.
In only one other sport that comes |
to mind, will you find the same gen- j

uine thrill for physical exertion.
That", surprising as it may seem, is
collegiate crew-racing. â€¢
In very few instances will you
find a freshman in college with crew
experience. Most of the candidates
are too slimly built for other sports,
and the only chance most of them
ever got for experience was prob
ably on a moonlight canoe ride or
rowing a fishing tub at 4:30 in the
morning. And those pursuits aren't
usually followed by an alumni schol
arship grant.
ANI) WHILE we're on the sub
ject, only one man of the 31-man
Washington Husky traveling squad
is from out of the home state. He's
a substitute starboard paddler from
Long Beach. The average height of
a good varsity crew man, according
to A1 Ulb.'ickson, the Husky coach,
is G ft. 2 in. to (j ft. 3 in., with a
poundage of 177-180. But who was
talking about crew in the first place?
IF YOU happen to see the Stan
ford-Washington track meet tomor
row, try to forget about Jeffrey,
Girard, Wohle, Anderson, Zagar,
and all the other champions and take
a gander at little Dick Carew, Paul
Moore, Johnny Emanuel, Craig
Williamson, etc., with special em
phasis on Carew.
