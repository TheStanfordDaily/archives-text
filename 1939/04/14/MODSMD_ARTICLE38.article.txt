## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Card Nine Out For Revenge In Game With Cal Tomorrow 
### 
The Card nine will be gunning for
revenge when it plays host to the
California Bears on the sunken dia
| mond Saturday afternoon in the last
league game to be played at home
this year. Leading 4-0 going into
the ninth inning of the first game
between the two teams last week,
| the Indian varsity blew a 5-4 deci
sion to the Cal team.
The Indians are still in fourth
place in the C.1.8.A. standings,
trailing U.S.C., St. Mary's, and Cali
. fornia in that order. The Woltermen
, will have to play better than aver
age ball on their coming road sea
son to beat out the Bears and finish
in the first division. They will play
California at Berkeley on Saturday,
April 22, and then hop a southbound
train for Los Angeles, where they
have four games scheduled against
Ihe Southern California Trojans and
U.C.L.A.
Qucntin Thompson, who, after
pitching two-hit, ball for eight inn
ings, was the victim of the five-run
outburst last week, will again start
J on the mound for Stanford. He will
; be opposed by another sophomore*
left-handed Mike Koll. unless Bear
; Coach Clint Evans decides to shuf
fle his pitchers and start Heber or
Daugherty. Koll pitched the final
I inning of last week's game and,
1 though effective, displayed a wind
|up that looked like an animated
j pretzel.
Norm Juney, who was injured
j just before the Bruin game Tues
: day, is in shape again, and will
â–  probably start at first base Satur
| day. Bill Jameson has won the regu
| lar catching job because of his e:<-
! perience and good hitting. AI-
J though not a distance hitter, Bill has
I made five base knocks in the last
three games.
Thompson and Jameson will be
' the starting battery for Stanford.
| The infield will be composed of Jun
ey at first, Monty Pfyl at second,
Herb Bull at third and Boone at
short. Bill Adams, "Smoke" Clark,
and Wally deWitt will probably be
: in the outfield, although Peterson
or Ditlevson may bfeak into the
! line-up.
| The game will start at about 3:30,
< when the track meet ends.
