# Sheean Says 'War by Fall'
## Author Lambasts Chamberlain Policies 
### 
Summarizing the events surround
ing the surrender at Munich and the
hands-off policy of France and
Britain in the Spanish war, Vincent
Sheean, speaking last night, in the
Memorial Hall, predicted the out
break of a general European war
within the next six months, which if
carried on to any extent would
eventually involve the United States.
"Prior to the Na7i invasion of
Czechoslovakia," said the well
known journalist and author, "it
would have been possible for the
European democracies to halt the
Fascist march by peaceful negotia
tion, but present circumstances
point to the fact that armed conflict
aolne can stop the dictators' thirst
for expansion."
In referring to the struggle in
Spain he explained that the Cham
berlain government "obviously did
not recognize that the civil war
would determine the future of Fas
cist plans in Europe." Pie pointed
out that the stubborn defense of
the Loyalists from March 1937 to the
fall of Barcelona prevented Musso
lini from turning to his other "points
of interest in the Mediterranean."
Condemning the policy of Cham
berlain's government during the
Sudeten crisis as "a blow to liber
alism, conditioned by social and
economic factors in England," the
noted correspondent stated that the
recent treaties of gaurantee by the
British "still left many loopholes for
Fascist expansionist plans."
"The repercussions of Munich,"
he said, "which overturned the Eu
ropean scene as established at Ver
sailles will have ominous reper
cussions in the next few years, and
the dictators' will to conquer can
only be halted by democracies' ar
mies in the field."
