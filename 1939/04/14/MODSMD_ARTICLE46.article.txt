# For the Years to Come

THIS is the quarter that the seniors pay
through the nose. There will be all the ex
penses of graduation to pay, and on top of that
a Senior Ball bid to buy.
With all these expenses already on their
budgets, seniors this week are coming up
against something else —the Alumni Associa
tion's membership drive. To show seniors ex
actly what advantages await them in member
ship in the association, The Daily publishes
today an account of the major functions of the
Alumni Association.
All these functions — alumni conferences,
polls of opinion, a permanent file of graduates
—are aimed primarily at giving the Stanford
graduate an articulate voice in matters of Uni
versity policy.
Besides a brochure depicting events of Sen
ior Week and a subscription to the Illustrated
Review, this chance to influence University
policy is the incentive held out to prospective
members of the Association.
While this incentive is an effective drawing
card to many students, there are those who
have resented alumni influence in the past, who
expect to sever all active connection with the
University upon graduation. Alumni, say these,
are inclined to want Stanford to remain ex
actly as it was when they went to school, to
attain athletic prowess at the expense of aca
demic and research considerations.
Although this objection to an articulate
alumni organization cannot be laughed off, it
can be met to some extent by pointing out that
(1) the typical Stanford graduate will go into
business of some sort, (2) business success de
pends to some extent on personal prestige, (3)
personal prestige is bolstered by a growing
prestige of one's alma mater.
Along with the type of graduate that likes
to see his University prominent just out of
loyalty, collegiate skeptics will find that their
very social status as Stanford graduates will
identify the University's prestige with their own
prestige. —R. D.
