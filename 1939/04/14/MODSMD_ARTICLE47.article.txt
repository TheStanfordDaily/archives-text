### 
THE world knows very little about what is
going on at Stanford. The seclusion of the
Farm really is not unlike that of a medieval
monastery, despite the obvious differences be
tween roughs and monks.
Athletics are the only important point of
contact between the students and the general
public. It is from metropolitan sports pages
and Saturday games and meets that the typical
twisted impression of Stanford is derived.
However, there are one or two activities
which can prove to the outside world that the
University is something more than a country
club. Debating has wandered far from the Farm
in recent years. Tours to Central America, Ho
nolulu, and across the United States, a trans-
Atlantic radio debate, and appearances up and
down the Coast have been potent advertise
ments for Stanford.
Today in San Francisco two of our forensic
aces will compete with U.C.L.A. before the Com
monwealth Club. Chances are that they will
impress the gentlemen of substance who will
be their audience, reveal a side of student life
which publicity releases manage to keep hid
den.
Stanford does not send out its debaters to
impress the world with their intellectual powers
or their eloquence, but to show that Stanford is
still producing well-rounded men and women.
