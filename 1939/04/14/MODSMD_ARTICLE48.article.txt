JUST what the Roosevelt administration means
to Stanford was made apparent not long ago
with publication of data in regard to the expen
diture of funds on this campus from the National
Youth Administration.
From those data, it appears that almost 325
students receive salaries of from $15 to $20 a
month—2so of them undergraduates, 75 of them
graduates. In other words, near provision of
living expenses other than board and room.
Net result to Stanford from the financial help
it has gotten from the NYA is an incalculable
figure. In the first place, it has meant the in
tangible profit of having a certain number of
students attend this University who otherwise
would have been unable to.
Also, it has made feasible the accomplish
ment of tremendous amounts of work that other
wise might have remained undone.
NYA helpers have been assigned professors,
who have assigifed tasks of varying importance
usually up to the abilities of the individual
students concerned. In fact, some of the latter
have been doing important work, particularly
in fields of research.

It appears by the report, however, that with
recovery, first limitations on NY A funds are
beginning to appear and a 25-years age limit
has been placed on student employees. The
result has been a consequent denial of employ
ment to some of the more able, though older,
graduate men and women—those who usually
need the money most, those who are most ca
pable of turning out top-quality results.
It is unfortunate, of course, that the Depres
sion could not continue so as to guarantee ev
erybody a living and that it is necessary to
curtail expenditures. But with that curtailment,
it seems unnecessary that Washington should
see fit to place an age limit that can only affect
the quality of the results of NYA work.
Other interesting fact, although incidental,
presented by the report shows that Stanford
had a 29-cent unexpended balance for the year
1937-1938.
Which only goes to prove that Republican
Stanford isn't helping out the Democratic deficit
any more than it has to.

need the money most, those who are most ca
pable of turning out top-quality results.
It is unfortunate, of course, that the Depres
sion could not continue so as to guarantee ev
erybody a living and that it is necessary to
curtail expenditures. But with that curtailment,
it seems unnecessary that Washington should
see fit to place an age limit that can only affect
the quality of the results of NYA work.
Other interesting fact, although incidental,
presented by the report shows that Stanford
had a 29-cent unexpended balance for the year
1937-1938.
Which only goes to prove that Republican
Stanford isn't helping out the Democratic deficit
any more than it has to.
