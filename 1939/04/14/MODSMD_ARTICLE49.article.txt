### JOHN COBBS 
MOKE FUND FOR THE KITTY
/ WER in the econ department the professors en
twine curves on the blackboard and explain that
our society is run by a profit motive; in the philoso
phy department they chase the idea around the Cosmos
a couple of times, pointing out that we prefer tangible
returns to intangible. For Ihe past week the shock
tx*oops in the senior fund campaign have seen a lot of
these theories in application.
As most seniors can testify, the annual drive to
build up a senior fund is now under way. The plan is
for the graduating class to take up contributions and
turn them over to the Stanford Fund, which is used by
the University for current expenses and improvements.

The only trouble with this scenario is that it seems
to take either blackmail or blasting powder to get a
contribution out of a senior. Campaigners are avoided
as though they had something contagious, and if they
finally corner a prospect they have to batter their
way past every excuse from Roosevelt to highway rob
bery (although if we believe some comments that is
not a particularly long distance).
The seniors object that, contributions to the fund
bring no tangible return. They point out that if they
spend their money in a store, they get merchandise;
if they spend it down the highway they at least get
a headache; if they spend it on a date they get com
panionship. But when it comes to the fund, they say
that a hole in the pocket gives the same result more
simply because it saves the trouble of writing checks.

A LL THIS makes a good argument; at least it con
vinces the men who advance it. But as a matter
of fact the Stanford Fund does bring returns. In the
first place, it is a nice mother's day gift, for dear alma
mater who has been blowing money on us for the last
four years. And we needn't worry for fear alma mater
won't be pleased with it. The one thing on which all
Stanford agrees is that we need money.
More than that, the Stanford Fund serves as an
insurance premium against devaluation of the degrees
we get from Stanford. About the only value a degree
has, is to impress somebody; and most of us arc
counting on our future A.B.'s to case us into a job. If
Stanford lets its academic plant run down because it
is short of money, the prestige of our degrees will go
under with it. A contribution to the fund is simply one
way of protecting our investment, at the same time get
ting credit for being generous gentlemen.
And so it appears that the Stanford fund can justify
itself, even under a profit motive.
This is not a paid advertisement.
