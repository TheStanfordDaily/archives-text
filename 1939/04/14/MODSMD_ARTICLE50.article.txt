SOLID BACKING
Over at the Fair the little girls put on ycterday, a
guy went up to the booth where they were guessing
weights. He paid his money and stood quite still
while the girl mentally weighed him.
"One hundred eighty pounds," she said.
A man in back yelled at the guy, "Turn around."
The guy turned around.
"Two hundred pounds!" the girl said.

WITH A MORAL
This letter was written by one of the basketball
players to himself. If he finds his letter missing, he
can save this paper should he want to read the letter
over. It reads:
Dear X:
You are now a graduate student, so put your
shoulder to the wheel and make the best of your
unfortunate position. It is a hard grind but it is a
long run process and will pay dividends in the end
although it may prevent you from receiving "divi
dends" at present.
There comes a time in every young man's life
when he must take stock of himself so sit down
and do just this.
This is not a lecture but a lot of good advice.
Sincerely,
X
P.S. Read this again when you have more time.
It will help you to resign yourself to your fate
this spring quarter on the Farm.

POOR FISII
They are at it again. It's salamanders this time, not
gold fish.
A Phi Kap swallowed a small one, and then a frat
ternity brother of his. who is on the track team, swal
lowed a larger one for a fee of $25.
That sort of thing has become quite common now
and not worth mentioning. Excepting that it was the
guy who swallowed the first fish who paid the other
guy the $25 to swallow the second one.
There is nothing like being a good, all-around
sucker.

FOOL OF THE WKEK
A Phi Sig who had an agreement with a girl this
week: he would net his hair cut down to practically
nothing if she would put her hair up in that ridicu
lous. modern way.
Being a Stanford gentleman, he had his hair cut.
She laughed at him and did nothing about putting
her hair up.
I saw him, and know why she laughed.
