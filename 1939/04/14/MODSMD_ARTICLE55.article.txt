## "THANKS FOR EVERYTHING" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I should like, through the medium
of The Daily, to thank all those who
contributed toward the success of
the Women's* Conference County
Fair, Auction, and Fashion Show on
Wednesday, April 12.
At this time, also, I would like to
thank Mary Sladen, who assumed
the chairmanship in my absence;
also Bob Moyle, who contributed his
services as a very efficient and very
entertaining auctioneer.
It should also be mentioned that
the co-operation of The Daily in
putting the event in the news was
veiy much appreciated.
Sincerely,
Annabelle Clark
