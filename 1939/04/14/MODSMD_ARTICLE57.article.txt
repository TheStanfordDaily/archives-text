# Big Meet Looms For Swim Team
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers are calmly
awaiting the biggest event in their
swimming year—the I3ig Meet with
Cal in the Berkeley pools tomorrow.
The prospect for a double win with
both the frosh and varsity taking
the Berkeley rivals appears quite
likely.
The frosh will probably drown the
Bear Cubs wtih a shower of first
places and meet records, while the
varsity will have a little harder
time, but will probably come out on
top in the end, if only by a small
margin.
The varsity was given some bad
and some good news yesterday
when they learned that Captain Win
Needham will bo able to swim both
his races, but that Roy Winkelmann
will probably not be able to dive
because of a torn back muscle.
