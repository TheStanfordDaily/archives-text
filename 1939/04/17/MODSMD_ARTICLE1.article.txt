### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
HP HIS week-end tl le shadow of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt fell
on (he map of Europe — and was
laughed oft by the dictators as a
passing cloud.
With the conviction that interfer
ence to keep the western world from
war is more important that our tra
ditional policy of isolation and neu
trality, the President personally re
quested Hitler and Mussolini to
guarantee that they will attempt no
further territorial aggression. Offi
cial replies have not been made as
yet, but the controlled totalitarian
newsorgans have indicated that the
answer will be in the negative.
$ * *
Neither Italy nor Germany was
infuriated about the message from
the United (Sates, which unavoid
ably insinuated that they are the
nations who will be responsible
for the next war. Rather they are
sneering, rudely turning up their
noses at Roosevelt's attempt to be
come a peace-maker.
After rushing back to Berlin from
Munich, Hen* Hitler dismissed the
matter as a mere bagatelle, and his
underlings suggested that he will
take eyre of his routine correspond
ence in good time. Several times
during the afternoon his telephone
rang, and he discussed the situation
with Field Marshall Goering in
Rome.
* * #
r | I HE number two Nazi was con
ferring with Mussolini on the
answer of the axis to the President
of the United States. Neither Berlin
nor Rome found much difficulty in
the way of reaching a negative con
elusion.
It has long been apparent that
the totalitarian states have little
regard for Roosevelt. Yesterday
their newspapers echoed the habit
ual cry of "war-monger" and ac
cused the chief executive of at
tempting to strengthen the anti-
Hitler bloc by a clumsy and ob
vious ruse.
* * *
The note from Washington has
little claim on Nazi attention today,
for the entire population of Nazidom
is concentrating on plans for the
Fuehrer's birthday celebration next
Thursday. The exact nature of the
festivites has not been revealed, but
certain it is that it will be no small
time clambake.
Prime probability is that the Reich
will present him with the city of
Danzig on a silver platter. Every
thing seems set for the occasion,
except, that Nazi moves generally
arc not as obvious as this one.
>{t >is >Jc
| FITLER'S forces can advance on
the strategic Baltic port from
East Prussia without entering
foreign territory. Ninety-five per
cent of the citizens of Danzig are
German by blood; so the Nazis
can justify aggression as natural
expansion, just as they did in Aus
tria, Mcmel, and the Sudetenland.
The press has smoothed the road
for such a step by reporting imagi
native tales of Polish outrages
against Germans. Repeatedly Pol
and has insisted that Danzig be left
inviolate as a necessary protection
for her commercial rights.
* *
It is questionable whether Poland
would declare Hitler's swallowing
the city an act of aggression. If she
did it would be up to England to
take up her arms for the protection
of Polish integrity.
Anyone familiar with Mr. Cham
berlain and liis habits will find it
difficult to believe that he is go
ing to start a war over Danxig.
What will probably happen is that
the Reich will go right ahead with
its aggression, and nothing will be
heard from Poland but a pathetic
cry of pain.
* * *
A LSO on the list of possible con
quests for the absolutist pow
ers is Jugoslavia, which, by its re
fusal to consider joining the anti-
Hitler alliance, seems to be favor
ably inclined toward the Rome-Ber
lin axis. Evidently, the Jugoslav
ians haven't read the poem about
the spider and the fly, for once in
side the snug totalitarian parlor,
they are sure to find their country
dismembered as thoroughly and
mercilessly as was Czechoslovakia.
♦ ♦ *
Meanwhile both London and
Paris are carrying on negotiations
with Soviet Russia, and already M.
Daladier's government is crowing
about its success. According to
these claims, an air pact with Mos
cow will be announced this week.
In case of war the Soviet Union
will supply the democratic powers
with airplanes, munitions, and
other supplies. Rut the cagey
Russians have made further com
mitments; when it comes to talk
of fighting the dictatorships, they
are silent. It is difficult indeed to
imagine a Russian army protect
ing the rights of Poland, a nation
that it has long regarded as a po
tential enemy.

With the conviction that interfer

Neither Italy nor Germany was
infuriated about the message from

ably insinuated that they are the

After rushing back to Berlin from
Munich, Hen* Hitler dismissed the

The note from Washington has
little claim on Nazi attention today,
for the entire population of Nazidom
is concentrating on plans for the
Fuehrer's birthday celebration next
Thursday. The exact nature of the
festivites has not been revealed, but
certain it is that it will be no small
time clambake.
Prime probability is that the Reich
will present him with the city of
Danzig on a silver platter. Every
thing seems set for the occasion,
except, that Nazi moves generally
arc not as obvious as this one.

| FITLER'S forces can advance on
the strategic Baltic port from
East Prussia without entering
foreign territory. Ninety-five per
cent of the citizens of Danzig are
German by blood; so the Nazis
can justify aggression as natural
expansion, just as they did in Aus
tria, Mcmel, and the Sudetenland.
The press has smoothed the road
for such a step by reporting imagi
native tales of Polish outrages
against Germans. Repeatedly Pol
and has insisted that Danzig be left
inviolate as a necessary protection
for her commercial rights.

It is questionable whether Poland
would declare Hitler's swallowing
the city an act of aggression. If she
did it would be up to England to
take up her arms for the protection
of Polish integrity.
Anyone familiar with Mr. Cham
berlain and liis habits will find it
difficult to believe that he is go
ing to start a war over Danxig.
What will probably happen is that
the Reich will go right ahead with
its aggression, and nothing will be
heard from Poland but a pathetic
cry of pain.

quests for the absolutist pow

fusal to consider joining the anti-
Hitler alliance, seems to be favor

will supply the democratic powers
with airplanes, munitions, and
