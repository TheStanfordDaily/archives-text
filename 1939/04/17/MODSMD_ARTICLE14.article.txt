# Closing Date Of Boathouse Up for Vote
## 
### 
Today the closing date i>f the first
aquatic season of Stanford's new
boathouse will be decided in a con
ference of B.A.C. officials, with Hal
Weatherbe, boathouse crew head,
Tom Killefer, and H. B. Lee, accord
ing to Weatherbe.
An early closing was predicted by
Weatherbe, who stated, "I doubt if
it will be possible to continue the
canoeing longer than the end of this
week." The water now stands below
30 feet, and the float on the north
wing is 5 feet above the water. The
other float was usable only during
the peak of the water level.
Danger due to the shallowness of
the water under the floats, and dam
age to the canoes due to launching
and beaching under" these condi
tions, were reasons cited by Weath
erbe in favor of closing down the
canoeing this week.
Swimming, however, will be al
lowed for two weeks after canoeing
is halted or until the demand no
longer warrants lifeguard mainte
nance. As long as swimming is al
lowed, arrangements will be made
to have lifeguards on duty from 1
to 5 o'clock every afternoon.
For at least a week after the
boathouse is closed for canoeing,
groups will have the opportunity of
removing their canoes for winter
storage. The regular charge of $1 a
month will be made for winter stor
age at the boathouse.
