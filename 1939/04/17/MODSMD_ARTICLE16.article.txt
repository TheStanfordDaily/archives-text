# Seniors Still Below Last Year's Total
## Stanford Fund Drive Deadline Scheduled For Next Tuesday 
### 
With 72 per cent of all living and
eating groups reporting, the latest
tabulation of the Stanford Fund
campaign shows that the Class of '39
is 149 contributors short of the rec
ord set last year.
Thirty-seven out of the total 51
groups reported 239 contributors.
The totals of the larger groups, Se
quoia, Branner, and ofT-eampus, are
as yet unknown.
"If the men would contribute in
the same proportion as the women,
the total would reach well above
the goal of 500 that we have set, and
would easily break the record of
the Class of '38," stated Jack Laney,
chairman of the drive.
Sororities, with 72 per cent of all
seniors donating to the Fund, are
leading the women's halls by a nar
row margin. With a total of 50 per
cent, the fraternities are ahead of the
men's eating clubs and halls, with 45
per cent contributing.
Deadline for the drive has been
scheduled for this coming Friday,
April 21. Purpose of the drive is not
only financial, but an attempt is
made to obtain a donation, regard
less of size, from every senior.
