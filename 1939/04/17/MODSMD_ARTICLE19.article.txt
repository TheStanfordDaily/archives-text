# Students Picnic With Faculty Wednesday
## Field Day Program To Include Baseball Game, Picnic Supper 
### 
Student-Faculty Day, the two
hour orgy for students and faculty
members, the field day of titanic ath
letic events, gets the green "Go"
flag at 3 o'clock Wednesday.
"Preparations have just about
been completed," said Chairman
Gene Coldiron last night. "There
still are, however, several recent de
velopments in the plans for the day
that are of uppermost interest to
students and faculty members alike."
Mrs. Bell, dietitian for Encina,
wishes to remind all Encina board
ers that no supper is to be served
in Encina Hall Wednesday night.
Such boarders should use their
regular meal tickets to procure a
picnic supper on the intramural
field, the scene of Wednesday's fes
tivities.
According to Bob Livingston, food
chairman, some 16 of Roble's fairest
are to act as- informal hostesses at
the picnic supper. They are as fol
lows: Jean Austin, Jeanne Kesler,
Annie Greenwell, Martha Van Fleet,
Lois Emry, Betty Lou Hart, Uancy
Burkett, Pat Adams, Lee Henkel,
Ann Dyer, Jane Pendergast, Harriet
Fisher, Jean Chambers, Mary Helen
McCune, Jane Forstcr, and Marlyn
Whedon. The simple supper will
consist of a main course, a vege
table, ice tea, ice cream, and pro
verbial cookies.
Two captains for contesting nines
were yesterday elected. Jack Ditz
will lead the Encina boys, while In
structor George Knolcs, the bambino
of the brain boys, has consented to
lead the Western Civilization nine.
In addition, Art Gore, events chair
man, has scheduled a third diamond
tussle between two teams selected
from Encina.
