# Stanford Favors Isolation for U.S. In World Affairs
## Peace Council's Straw Vote Reveals Campus for Defense Of Americas, Predicts War 
### 
Even if Hitler is allowed to have his own way in Europe, he will never
constitute a menace to the territorial integrity of the United States.
Whether true or not, such is the opinion of the Stanford student-body
as disclosed by a survey of sudent opinion conducted last week. The

► results were released yesterday by
John Hewitt, chairman of the in
quiry.
As a feature of its annual program
leading to Peace Day, the poll was
conducted among 80 students picked
at random under the auspices of the
Stanford Peace Council.
U.S. POLICY DINGED
With similar decisiveness, the re
sults of the survey show that Stan
ford thinks that the U.S. government
is taking sides in the European
quarrel, at the same time maintain
ing, in evident disapproval of the
policy, that it should remain aloof
from the controversy.
On the question of whether the
U.S. should build an army and navy
large enough to defend the Western
Hemisphere against invasion from
any part of the world, made vital by
revelations of German and Italian
economic penetration into South
America, the poll clearly reveals
that the Farm favors by greater than
a two-to-one margin the building of
' a fighting machine primed to this
task.
WOULD FARM FIGHT?
Opinion is evenly divided on
whether or not Stanford men would
cross U.S. borders to fight for their
country. In the same vein, opinion
showed that the U.S. government
should not be responsible for the
interests of its citizens abroad if, by
so concerning itself, it might run the
risk of becoming involved in a war.
Those students who framed the
questions are John Heitt, Sue Ad
ams, and Francis MacDowell. Mem
bers of Peace Council who assisted
in the survey are Dwight Hutchin
son. Ann McGuigan, Winninette Ar
nold, and Marco Thome. John
Moore, Bob Einstein, Harold Smith,
and Herman Hextrum aided in dis
tribution of the questionnaires,
Hewitt said.

As a feature of its annual program
leading to Peace Day, the poll was
conducted among 80 students picked
at random under the auspices of the
Stanford Peace Council.
U.S. POLICY DINGED
With similar decisiveness, the re
sults of the survey show that Stan
ford thinks that the U.S. government
is taking sides in the European
quarrel, at the same time maintain
ing, in evident disapproval of the
policy, that it should remain aloof
from the controversy.
On the question of whether the
U.S. should build an army and navy
large enough to defend the Western
Hemisphere against invasion from
any part of the world, made vital by
revelations of German and Italian
economic penetration into South
America, the poll clearly reveals
that the Farm favors by greater than
a two-to-one margin the building of
' a fighting machine primed to this
task.
WOULD FARM FIGHT?
Opinion is evenly divided on
whether or not Stanford men would
cross U.S. borders to fight for their
country. In the same vein, opinion
showed that the U.S. government
should not be responsible for the
interests of its citizens abroad if, by
so concerning itself, it might run the
risk of becoming involved in a war.
Those students who framed the
questions are John Heitt, Sue Ad
ams, and Francis MacDowell. Mem
bers of Peace Council who assisted
in the survey are Dwight Hutchin
son. Ann McGuigan, Winninette Ar
nold, and Marco Thome. John
Moore, Bob Einstein, Harold Smith,
and Herman Hextrum aided in dis
tribution of the questionnaires,
