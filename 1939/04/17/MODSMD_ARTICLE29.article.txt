# Broadway Stars to Appear With Olsen at Junior Prom
## 
### 
"Time" called it smart, enthus
iastic, sparkling. Robert Benchley
reviewed it as "a brilliantly success
ful youth movement" in "The New
Yorker."
The show they were talking about
was "New Faces," a sensational
Broadway revue of two seasons ago,
starring Imogene Coca, Jimmie
Brierly, Gloria Hart, the Tanner
Sisters, Kirk Allen, Massey and
Miller, Jerry Munson, Bob Burton,
and Carolyn Montgomery ,â€” all of
whom will appear with George Ol
sen and his orchestra at the Junior
Prom.
MUSIC OF TOMORROW
Next Friday night from 9 to 1
o'clock Stanlord will dance to "the
music of tomorrow" in the Pavilibn,
which will be transformed into a
smart supper club for the occasion.
Spring will be the motif of the deco
rations which will feature fruit
blossoms and other flowers of the
season.
As a result of campus demand,
semi-formal dress will be in order
for the occasion. Women will wear
long dresses, men will wear dark
suits. Bids for the Prom are on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office at $3.50, and
junior class representatives are sell
ing them in all men's living groups.
Only a limited number will be sold
in order that adequate room on the
dance floor may be assured.
UNIQUE ORCHESTRA
George Olson will present his en
tertainment during the intermis
sions, and he promises a full quota
of what critics call the most dance
able music in America. Known for
his highly original arrangements,
the popular maestro uses the elec
tric organ, steel guitar, and har
monic reed instruments in his or
chestra.
Thirty entertainers will accom
pany Olsen on his visit to the Farm
next Friday. The Junior Prom will

be the only dance to feature a "big !
name band" during the quarter, ac- J
cording to Bob Richardson and Jane ;
LeCutler, co-chairmen.
