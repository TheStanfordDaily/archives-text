# Britons Bow To Stanford Ruggers, 18-16
## 
### 
The Stanford rugby team came
through in the last half of the match
against the British Columbia All-
Stars at Treasure Island yesterday
to win the game 18-16 by driving
through to victory in typical Stan
ford last-minute success style. Hugh
Gallerneau and Aubrey Austin were
responsible for the deciding points
of the game, which were made in
just a lew minutes preceding the
gun that ended the game.
During the first half the Cana
dians took a decisive lead in the
game by scoring a total of 13 points,
Stanford scoring only 5 points dur
ing that time. In the second half
Stanford seemed to get going and
consistently outplayed the Cana
dians to bring the score up to a tie
16-16 with Austin cinching the
game with the final two points for
a conversion.
Pete Fay, Hugh Gallerneau, and
Dean Johnson scored tries for Stan
ford with Aubrey Austin making
three conversions after the tries.
Humphrey Payne, George Biddle,
and Campbell Forbes made tries for
the Canadian team with Jack Gro
gan making two conversions.
Both of Fay's tries were made
after his usual show of beautiful
broken field running. The first one
was made during the first half,
when he steamed over the goal after
a 50-yard dash down the field. His
second try was even more spec
tacular when he made a 70-yard run
down the field after evading prac
tically all the Canadian team.
Gallerneau came in lor his share
of the score when he took the ball
over the goal after Jerry Sparling
brought it down to within 10 yards
of the goal line with a dash of half
the field. Johnson made his try
early in the second half when he
took the ball out of a scrum near
the goal and made a dive over one
corner of the goal line.
Both Austin and Lymie Calkins
had a tough time making their
kicks go straight during the game
because of a strong northwest wind
which often put a curve on the ball.
Calkins played his usual fine game
at fullback by kicking the ball to
touch time after time when the
Canadians threatened to swarm over
the goal with their very effective
dribbling rushes.
As a whole the team showed some
really good rugby playing during
the game Saturday, especially dur
ing the last half when they rallied
to put Stanford on the right end of
the score.
