# Shipkey Team Tripped by Bears
## 
### 
Behind a bevy of run-tolling the
Cal frosh nine last Saturday defeat
ed Coach Harry Shipkey's diamond
aggregation by the lop-sided score
of 18 to 8.
Russ Smith, who started the game
for the Farm nine on the mound,
took a rest after the first three inn
ings of pounding and handed over
the hurling job to lanky Fred
Meyer. In the eighth and ninth inn
ings Smith returned to carry the
Cardinals to the final put-out.
Top Indian hitter of the afternoon
was Centerfielder Johnny Sturgeon,
who bingoed three hits in three trips
to the plate. Left-fielder Milt Vu
cinich, the pride of San Francisco,
tailed Sturgeon closely with a total
of four hits out of five attempts with
the bat.
