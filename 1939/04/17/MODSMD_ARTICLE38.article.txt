Although Clyde Jeffrey did not break the world's in the quarter
mile in the Washington meet last Saturday, track fans for their money's
i worth of good times and distances by Card performers. Coach Dink'Tem
plcton's pupils proved that they have definitely arrived by copping every,
yes, all 15, first places, smothering Washington 110 l-(i to 20 5-6.

Jeffrey whirled the 440 in the
! highly respectable time of 47.9. a
j full second and a half slower than
j the world's record and also a tenth
i of a second slower than he ran with
j pacers last Wednesday. Templeton's
j theory concerning quarter milers
utilizes a blazing first 300 yards and
a coasting finish. In the past, Dink
has been dealing with long legged
striders such as Ben Eastman and
Ray Malott who could pour it on
for the first part of the race and
then kept drifting. But Jeffrey's
legs are the muscular legs of a
sprinter and, as was proved last
Saturday, he ties up after the stren
uous first burst of speed too badly
to finish in a smooth manner.
TESTING FIELD
Last Saturday's meet proved to be
a testing field for Templeton. First
guinea pig on the day's list of events
was Mushy Girard, who won the
opening event, the mile run, and
came back later to cop the two-mile.
Dink wished to find out whether or
not his distance star had any fin
ishing kick. "Mush" proved deci
sively that he did by doing as he
was instructed, trailing the leader in
both the distance races until the final
75 yards and then uncorking a sprint
that won for him by yards.
Next Dink wished to see if Dick
Carew could handle the sprint as
signment without the help of Jef
frey. Dick won his spurs by taking
the century in 9.9 and a blistering
220 in an excellent 21.4. Paul Moore
was another victim of experiment.
Switched to tht> half-mile, Paul
showed evidence of returning to his
old form by running a very strong
second place to team-mate Barney
Ferguson in a 1:58 half.
By far the best race of the day
was Sid Hayes and Dick Hawkins
thrilling dead heat in the high bar
riers. "Haw" led by a hair for most
of the race, but a final lunge at the
tape by Hayes brought him a tie in
the high barriers.
Some of the other performances
that showed improvement or re
turning strength in the Cardinal
ranks were Captain Stan Hiserman's
low hurdle flight in 23.5 and Ray
Brown's leap of 23 ft. 6 in. in the
broad jump. Stan ran his best race
of the year against the Huskies and
is now in a position to upset Troy's
great. Earl Vickery.
Ray Brown's case in the broad
jump is one of ups and downs. As
la frosh, Ray was sensational, hitting
the 24 ft. 6 in. mark, but under Tem
pleton he changed his form and has
since that time never quite attained
the confidence he once had. But Ray
certainly showed Saturday that he
has the ability to jump, and Tem
pleton feels that he will be able to
break up the Cal trio of broad
jumpers, Mannuel, Kido, and the
newly found Louie Smith.

guinea pig on the day's list of events
was Mushy Girard, who won the
opening event, the mile run, and
came back later to cop the two-mile.
Dink wished to find out whether or
not his distance star had any fin
ishing kick. "Mush" proved deci
sively that he did by doing as he
was instructed, trailing the leader in
both the distance races until the final
75 yards and then uncorking a sprint
that won for him by yards.
Next Dink wished to see if Dick
Carew could handle the sprint as
signment without the help of Jef
frey. Dick won his spurs by taking
the century in 9.9 and a blistering
220 in an excellent 21.4. Paul Moore
was another victim of experiment.
Switched to tht> half-mile, Paul
showed evidence of returning to his
old form by running a very strong
second place to team-mate Barney
Ferguson in a 1:58 half.
By far the best race of the day
was Sid Hayes and Dick Hawkins
thrilling dead heat in the high bar
riers. "Haw" led by a hair for most
of the race, but a final lunge at the
tape by Hayes brought him a tie in
the high barriers.
Some of the other performances
that showed improvement or re
turning strength in the Cardinal
ranks were Captain Stan Hiserman's
low hurdle flight in 23.5 and Ray
Brown's leap of 23 ft. 6 in. in the
broad jump. Stan ran his best race
of the year against the Huskies and
is now in a position to upset Troy's
great. Earl Vickery.
Ray Brown's case in the broad
jump is one of ups and downs. As
la frosh, Ray was sensational, hitting
the 24 ft. 6 in. mark, but under Tem
pleton he changed his form and has
since that time never quite attained
the confidence he once had. But Ray
certainly showed Saturday that he
has the ability to jump, and Tem
pleton feels that he will be able to
break up the Cal trio of broad
jumpers, Mannuel, Kido, and the
newly found Louie Smith.
Although Clyde Jeffrey did not break the world's in the quarter
mile in the Washington meet last Saturday, track fans for their money's
i worth of good times and distances by Card performers. Coach Dink'Tem
plcton's pupils proved that they have definitely arrived by copping every,
yes, all 15, first places, smothering Washington 110 l-(i to 20 5-6.

Jeffrey whirled the 440 in the
! highly respectable time of 47.9. a
j full second and a half slower than
j the world's record and also a tenth
i of a second slower than he ran with
j pacers last Wednesday. Templeton's
j theory concerning quarter milers
utilizes a blazing first 300 yards and
a coasting finish. In the past, Dink
has been dealing with long legged
striders such as Ben Eastman and
Ray Malott who could pour it on
for the first part of the race and
then kept drifting. But Jeffrey's
legs are the muscular legs of a
sprinter and, as was proved last
Saturday, he ties up after the stren
uous first burst of speed too badly
to finish in a smooth manner.
