# Varsity, Frosh Tankmen Sink Cal Saturday
## Thorntonmen Take 6 Out of 9 Firsts; New Records Made 
### 
Continuing their almost unbroken j
record of wins in the Big Meets, the
Stanford varsity and frosh swim i
teams sank the Cal squads by scores ;
of 44-31 and 40-32 respectively. In- '
cidental to the winning of both j
meets was the breaking of six Stan- i
ford-Cal meet records.
Both varsity and frosh allowed j
their opponents only three first ;
places out of the total of nine.
Captain Paul Herron of the frosh
set new meet records in the 220 and
440 and swam the anchor lap on the
record-setting relay team composed
of Brad Young, Scott Dudley, Gard
ner Miller, and Herron. The other
now mark wa.s set by Scott Dudley
in the 200-yard breast stroke.
Partial cause of the narrow gap j
between the scores of the winning j
losing frosh teams was Stan- .
ford's disqualification in the initial
event, the medley relay. Scott Dud
ley, who later vindicated himelf in
the breast stroke race, jumped the |
gun on his lap of the relay.
For the Bears, Marshall Lloyd,'
captain of the frosh, was the only !
record-breaker; he took the 50 and !
100, setting a new meet record in the |
latter.
