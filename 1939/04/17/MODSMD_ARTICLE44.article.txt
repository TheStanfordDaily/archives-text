# Stanford on Peace
## 
### 
STANFORD, last week, took a quick look at
the international situation, offered its con
servative opinion on peace and war, decided
that traditional isolation and hemisphere de
fense are still best for the United States.
Probably most interesting of the answers was
that to the question "Would you refuse to go
to war on foreign soil?"
Stanford's present undergraduates are the
ones who will actually pick up guns for the
United States in the next war. At the present,
war — personal, bloody, loud, deadly war —
seems remote. And in the light of that remote
ness, Stanford doesn't know whether it would
fight on foreign soil or not.
There is no philosophical answer to such a
question. When it is asked, the individual,
weighing the possibility that the United States
may have determined such war necessary, ac
tually doesn't know categorically the answer;
whether or not he would have the guts to say
"no," whether or not he would want to say "no."
Stanford's answer to that last question in the
Peace Poll points the way to the key to the
confusion surrounding the peace and neutrality
programs at present being considered by the
Congress of the United States.
Because, legislators though its members may
be, Congress doesn't enact the future no matter
how hard some of its members may try.
Circumstances alter every question; at the
present, an extension of isolation and neutrality
for the United States is being sought.
If proponents of such extension are success
lul, they will be forecasting circumstance. To
forecast circumstance is to meddle in affairs far
more confusing, far more unpredictable than
even "entangling alliances."
Stanford, however, thinks differently accord
ing to its expression of opinion on neutrality
and isolation contained in the question, "Do you
believe that the U.S. government should take
sides in the current European controversy?"
The only way to secure either neutrality or
isolation is through legislation — how else?
Yet, from the time of the earliest such legisla
tion prior to the War of 1812 to the World War,
its rigidity has accomplished nothing; the Uni
ted States' own definitions of its rights as a
neutral has done nothing but consistently pull
it into conflict. Stanford forgets its American
history.
Much better, perhaps; to let discretion and
expert observation rule in the light of events
obtaining at the particular times in question.
Nevertheless, if the results of the poll can
be regarded as a valid expression of under
graduate opinion, it would appear that tradi
tionalists can be content with the future of the
United States in world affairs. For it is men and
women like those who responded to this poll
who will determine that future.
And it is men and women like those who
will pass on to future generations ideas as re
gards such policy.
Thus, isolation and neutrality—smug, safe,
sane—seem deep-rooted unless something un
foreseen happens.
Circumstances continue to alter situations.

Stanford's answer to that last question in the
Peace Poll points the way to the key to the
confusion surrounding the peace and neutrality
programs at present being considered by the
Congress of the United States.
Because, legislators though its members may
be, Congress doesn't enact the future no matter
how hard some of its members may try.
Circumstances alter every question; at the
present, an extension of isolation and neutrality
for the United States is being sought.
If proponents of such extension are success
lul, they will be forecasting circumstance. To
forecast circumstance is to meddle in affairs far
more confusing, far more unpredictable than
even "entangling alliances."
Stanford, however, thinks differently accord
ing to its expression of opinion on neutrality
and isolation contained in the question, "Do you
believe that the U.S. government should take
sides in the current European controversy?"
The only way to secure either neutrality or
isolation is through legislation — how else?
Yet, from the time of the earliest such legisla
tion prior to the War of 1812 to the World War,
its rigidity has accomplished nothing; the Uni
ted States' own definitions of its rights as a
neutral has done nothing but consistently pull
it into conflict. Stanford forgets its American
history.
Much better, perhaps; to let discretion and
expert observation rule in the light of events
obtaining at the particular times in question.
Nevertheless, if the results of the poll can
be regarded as a valid expression of under
graduate opinion, it would appear that tradi
tionalists can be content with the future of the
United States in world affairs. For it is men and
women like those who responded to this poll
who will determine that future.
And it is men and women like those who
will pass on to future generations ideas as re
gards such policy.
Thus, isolation and neutrality—smug, safe,
sane—seem deep-rooted unless something un
foreseen happens.
Circumstances continue to alter situations.
STANFORD, last week, took a quick look at
the international situation, offered its con
servative opinion on peace and war, decided
that traditional isolation and hemisphere de
fense are still best for the United States.
Probably most interesting of the answers was
that to the question "Would you refuse to go
to war on foreign soil?"
Stanford's present undergraduates are the
ones who will actually pick up guns for the
United States in the next war. At the present,
war — personal, bloody, loud, deadly war —
seems remote. And in the light of that remote
ness, Stanford doesn't know whether it would
fight on foreign soil or not.
There is no philosophical answer to such a
question. When it is asked, the individual,
weighing the possibility that the United States
may have determined such war necessary, ac
tually doesn't know categorically the answer;
whether or not he would have the guts to say
"no," whether or not he would want to say "no."
