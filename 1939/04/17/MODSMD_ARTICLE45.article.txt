# Royal Family — Flop
## 
### 
JUDGING from box-office receipts from Ram's
Head reading of the Kaufman-Ferber comedy
"Royal Family" last week, a casual observer
would be likely to say, "What a flop! We bet
ter not have any more of them things."
True enough, the Memorial Hall Little Thea
ter wasn't anywhere near sold out. Only 60 of
its 200 seats were filled.
One reason for the poor turn-out probably is
that Wednesday was a bad night—too many
other attractions.
Another reason is that the reading was in
sufficiently publicized. Remedy for this is seen
in the Division of Speech and Drama's reguest
that Ram's Head announce its readings at least
two weeks in advance from now on.
Still another reason for poor attendance at
Royal Family" is the long four months since
the last reading. The point is that Stanford has

grown out of the habit of going to readings, has
forgotten how entertaining they can be.
Chief appeal of readings is their utter sim
plicity. Instead of worrying themselves over
stage directions and "business," members of
the cast just sit at a long table and read their
parts. By looking up at the audience and regis
tering animation, a player shows he is supposed
to be entering the scene.
But all this simplicity doesn't hurt the effec
tiveness of the reading as a means of presenting
a play.
Since they are so much easier to product than
orthodox productions, readings should be regu
lar fare for Stanford—two or three a guarter at
least. That's what Ram's Head plans to give.
Let's hope they come through with results.—
R.D.
