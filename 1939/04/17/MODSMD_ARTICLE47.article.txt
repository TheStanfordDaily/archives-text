LET EM EAT CAKE
/ "|UR house manager hammered his glass with a
knife handle and sent his voice pounding through
the dinner-table noises like a charging back going over
the scrubs' line. "There will be no dinner here Wed
nesday night," he informed us. "You're supposed to
go down to this Student-Faculty Day fandango and
stuff yourselves there."
The announcement did not surprise me. I had
been prowling around Ex Committee the week before,
making noises like an impartial observer, and I had ob
served Axe Society's campaign for permission to so
licit support from the houses. When Excom granted a
hunting license, I made a note to get some bicarbonate
before Wednesday.
* * +
In this particular case I have no objection to offer
ing up my dinner on the altar of good will and under
standing. The Student-Faculty Day is one of the best
projects that has hit Stanford since students replaced
horses on the Farm. And with medicine in its present
advanced state, no damage will be done that attention
and clean living won't cure.
But I am a little frightened by the reasoning which
Axe Society developed in pleading its case before Ex
Committee. The Society asked permission to request
houses to cancel dinner on Wednesday night and turn
over 25 cents per member to be used for a barbecue.
This is good business policy, and under the circum
stances, justified. But in its argument, the Society
made it appear that collecting money from the houses
was a favor to everybody concerned. After four years
in the econ department, I am suspicious of this hypoth
esis.
* sjc * *
r J"VHE idea is that dinner costs the houses about 40
cents a man. Therefore when a fraternity can
cels dinner and turns over 25 cents to Axe Society, it
makes a clear profit of 15 cents. The house manager
has economy; the cook has her day off; Axe Society
has its barbecue. And the Angels sing.
The flaw in this argument lies in the qualitative
difference between a barbecue and a dinner. The stu
dents are taken for the difference between the dinner
they paid for and the sandwich they get. Official bar
becues like a woman's character don't bear discus
sion; but it is safe to say that we do not have uni
versal agreement on the question of how they rate as
meals.
* * * i't
More than that, cancelling dinner at the houses
forces the members to go to the barbecue or eat at
the Union. This backhanded coercion is hardly in
keeping with the spirit of brotherly love and under
standing that is supposed to prevail.
House managers are pleased; but their reactions
are not entirely normal. For every smirking house
mouse there are .°io brothers scratching sunburn, gulp
ing soda, and wondering why civilized men should re
vert to dietary practices that passed wtih the cave
man.
In this case the appeal is justified. But I would hate
to see Stanford adopt the theory that we do the stu
dents a favor when we appropriate their dinner. Man
shall not live by bicarbonate alone.

are not entirely normal. For every smirking house
mouse there are .°io brothers scratching sunburn, gulp

LET EM EAT CAKE
/ "|UR house manager hammered his glass with a
knife handle and sent his voice pounding through
the dinner-table noises like a charging back going over
the scrubs' line. "There will be no dinner here Wed
nesday night," he informed us. "You're supposed to
go down to this Student-Faculty Day fandango and
stuff yourselves there."
The announcement did not surprise me. I had
been prowling around Ex Committee the week before,
making noises like an impartial observer, and I had ob
served Axe Society's campaign for permission to so
licit support from the houses. When Excom granted a
hunting license, I made a note to get some bicarbonate
before Wednesday.

In this particular case I have no objection to offer
ing up my dinner on the altar of good will and under
standing. The Student-Faculty Day is one of the best
projects that has hit Stanford since students replaced
horses on the Farm. And with medicine in its present
advanced state, no damage will be done that attention
and clean living won't cure.
But I am a little frightened by the reasoning which
Axe Society developed in pleading its case before Ex
Committee. The Society asked permission to request
houses to cancel dinner on Wednesday night and turn
over 25 cents per member to be used for a barbecue.
This is good business policy, and under the circum
stances, justified. But in its argument, the Society
made it appear that collecting money from the houses
was a favor to everybody concerned. After four years
in the econ department, I am suspicious of this hypoth
esis.
* sjc * *
r J"VHE idea is that dinner costs the houses about 40
cents a man. Therefore when a fraternity can
cels dinner and turns over 25 cents to Axe Society, it
makes a clear profit of 15 cents. The house manager
has economy; the cook has her day off; Axe Society
has its barbecue. And the Angels sing.
The flaw in this argument lies in the qualitative
difference between a barbecue and a dinner. The stu
dents are taken for the difference between the dinner
they paid for and the sandwich they get. Official bar
becues like a woman's character don't bear discus
sion; but it is safe to say that we do not have uni
versal agreement on the question of how they rate as
meals.
* * * i't
More than that, cancelling dinner at the houses
forces the members to go to the barbecue or eat at
the Union. This backhanded coercion is hardly in
keeping with the spirit of brotherly love and under
standing that is supposed to prevail.
