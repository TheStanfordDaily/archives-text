I ART

At the fair they have a somewhat sex show in their
Greenwich Village; it is advertised as an art school.
A nude model poses, and you can go in and draw
her.
Three sailors went in the other night. They sat
down in front of their easels and began to draw. They
should study her carefully, draw a line or two, and
then stare again.
It took them quite a while to finish their drawings.
Sometimes it would be several minutes before they
would add another line. When they had finished the
attendant came around and held up their pictures of
the model for the assembled artists to admire.
One of them had drawn a submarine, another a
sail boat. The third had just scribbled.

The junior class is sticking its nock out. It is on

last traditions.
Lagunita (the lake, not. the hen house) took a good
look at the weather and saw it was no damn use. It
bla-bla-bla-bla-bla and silently slipped away. By
Wednesday, they say, it will be gone.
But the juniors, with their solid, Republican buck
grounds, refuse to recognize the recession. They are
acting as if the lake never existed and it is perfectly
natural to hold a Water Carnival in a swimming pool.
Tradition for the sake of tradition.
They say they can still have the floats; put them on
wheels and run them down the Row. And someone will
probably go over to Berkeley and paint the C.
Nuts to Cal.
But what about the jousting? And what possible
I substitute can they get for 10 Kappas in one canoe?
The success or failure of any Stanford Water Carnival
hinges on how many Kapp;is can get in one canoe
I without the canoe sinking. •
Twenty Kappas in a swimming pool is nothing. Ten

its way toward losing itself chasing one of Stanford's
last traditions.
Lagunita (the lake, not. the hen house) took a good
look at the weather and saw it was no damn use. It
bla-bla-bla-bla-bla and silently slipped away. By
Wednesday, they say, it will be gone.
But the juniors, with their solid, Republican buck
grounds, refuse to recognize the recession. They are
acting as if the lake never existed and it is perfectly
natural to hold a Water Carnival in a swimming pool.
Tradition for the sake of tradition.
They say they can still have the floats; put them on
wheels and run them down the Row. And someone will
probably go over to Berkeley and paint the C.
Nuts to Cal.
But what about the jousting? And what possible
I substitute can they get for 10 Kappas in one canoe?
The success or failure of any Stanford Water Carnival
hinges on how many Kapp;is can get in one canoe
I without the canoe sinking. •
Twenty Kappas in a swimming pool is nothing. Ten
j in one canoe is a thing to see.
Ihe only substitute I can see is a floating contest.
I he criteria would be how high out of the water the
, contestant could float. My money would be on the
I buoyant canoe-filling winners.
I Without that, the whole lliinu will flou.
