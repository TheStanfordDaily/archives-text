# Cagney Goes West in 'Oklahoma kid'
## 
### 
"THE OKLAHOMA KID," cur
I rently playing at the Fox-Stanford.
This is Warner Brothers' addition
to the deluge of current "empire-
I building" pictures. Taking Jimmy |
Cagney out of the city, where he!
has played G-man and crook, they J
have turned him loose in the wide '
open spaces, given him a gun and a |
horse, and a very logical, though J
unconventional, philosophy of life, j
Through the picture he does a good j
job of justifying that philosophy.

A glorified "horse opera" that
falls roughly into the same mold as
"Jesse James," "The Oklahoma
I Kid" is packed with action, Rose
| mary Lane, and meller-drama.
But this is good entertainment,
j Chronicling Tulsa's turbulent youth,
1 when it grew from the rolling, sun- ;
' cracked sod of Oklahoma into a '
brawling, vice-ridden frontier out- j
post, "The Oklahoma Kid" excells j
at telling a story well. Pegging ac- ;
tion to Cleveland's proclamation!
i that opened the former Indian ter- j

ritory to settlers, the plot moves into
a fairly stereotyped groove that var
ies little until the final fadeout.
Photography is brilliantly bundled
by the expert Chinese-American
cameraman, James Wong Howe.
Cagney turns in a convincing per
formance, highlighted with humor.
A supporting cast of veteran char
acter actors, including Humphrey
Bogart, stock villain, fill in the
rough spots.
Playing with "The Oklahoma
Kid" is Columbia's latest picturiza
tion in the "Blondie" series, star
ring Penny Singleton and Arthur
Lake, with Skinnay Ennis, the whis
pering song-stylist, and his band.
