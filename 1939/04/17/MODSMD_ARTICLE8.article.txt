# Miss Two Million at G.G.I.E. Is Stanford's Jean Sheriff
## 
### 
Jean Sheriff, Chi O senior, was the lucky 2,000,000 th visitor at the 1939
Golden Gale Exposition last Saturday.
Not having the slightest idea of what was in store for her, she hurried
through the turnstiles to Treasure Island to keep an appointment, only to
be greeted with exploding bombs, a brass band, a flurrv of autograph-

seekers, and a hundred gifts. With-<
out pausing to explain the commo- |
tion, the officials proclaimed her
mayor for the day, presented her
with a gold medallion of office, and
started out on a tour of inspection
on the elephant train.
"Please tell me what this is all
about," she asked as soon as she had
a chance and it was explained
vaguely.
RECEIVES VARIED GIFTS
At the National Cash Register,
Miss Sheriff met Ruth Appleby, a
sorority sister, who accompanied her
while she thanked the donors of the
various gifts, which ranged from a
refrigerator, Coca Cola, and Del
Monte canned food to a watch, cham
pagne, a diamond ring, and perfume.
At 6 o'clock the honored guest
spoke over the radio and Buck
Jones, of "Hi Ho, Silver" fame,
pinned a corsage on her.
"It was amusing at first, but then
I had to start thinking of something
different to say to thank each one,"
was her comment.
ACCOMPANIED BY GUIDE
Throughout the day Miss Two
Million was accompanied by a guide
who ran errands for her, a pair of
identical twins signifying two mil
lion, and a number of officials. Later
in the evening Miss Sheriff's medal
lion of office got her and her com
panion admission to everything they
desired.
After a busy and exciting time
Miss Sheriff was offered a two-car
escort back to Stanford, which she
declined, but accepted the invitation
to be guest of honor at a banquet
yesterday and to be hostess at the
City of Paris today.
