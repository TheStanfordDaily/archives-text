### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
W/HEN Hollywood wants to let
the world know that it is
about to favor it with a gigantic,
terrific film, it indiscriminately sets
about hiring the best known actors,
writers, directors, and designers it
can get its hands on.
When a government wants to con
vince its citizens that it is launching
a policy of major importance, it can
do worse than to use a leading fig
ure in the field to publicize and
personalize national action.
Yesterday, when Washington
called Charles A. Lindbergh back
to army duty to survey U.S. avia
tion research facilities, it drove
home the fact tbat the nation is
arming itself with frantic speed
and intensity.

The United States need fear no
immediate attack, but it is playing
smart ball when it stands prepared
for any eventuality. Typical of the
far-sighted moves of' our military
and naval departments was last
week-end's transfer of the fleet to
the Pacific.
At the time, speculation was rife
as to why the navy .should desert
the Atlantic just when the European
pot was ready to boil over. The only
answer available was that President
Roosevelt wanted a far-fetched
peaceful gesture to accompany his
plea to the dictators. Today it ap
pears that there was more in the sit
uation than met the eye.
H: i|> 4s
D UMOR has it (hat when the
President addressed liis peace
proposal to Hitler and Mussolini,
Japan was almost ready to an
nounce an alliance with the Koine-
Berlin axis. The Impact of the
message on international affairs
was sufficient to make the Japa
nese defer announcement of such
a pact.
In Russia lies the reason for Nip
pon's anxiety. With the Soviets
preparing to unite with England and
France in their stand against the to
talitarian states, the Island Empire
fears that it will never realize its
ambitions in eastern Asia. Inevi
tably the fastest-growing nation on
earth will try to expand into Siberia,
just as it has into China.
* * *
Today the Anglo-Soviet air al
liance stands on the brink of com
pletion. The Russian ambassador
has returned to Moscow to secure
official approval of the project
from Foreign Commissar Maxim
Litvinov, and he is expected in
London before the week-end to
sign on the dotted line.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Cham
berlain is attempting to talk Bul
garia and Turkey into joining his
chain to imprison Germany and
Italy. In these two important allies
of the Central Powers in the last
war, Britain sees a strategic threat
to absolutist aggression.
A defensive alliance with Russia
plus control of the Dardanelles and
the ports of the eastern Mediterra
nean would give the anti-Hitler al
lies a strangle-hold on eastern Eu
rope. In addition, the ambitious Mr.
Chamberlain has named the tradi
tionally neutral states of Switzer
land, Denmark, and the Netherlands
as prospective members of his fra
ternity. Before he knows it, he'll
have a pledge class.

before summer, a cheering note:
The King and Queen of England

the United States this June despite
the threatening aspect of the Euro
pean scene.
Another bright spot on the hori
zon is the announcement that
General Franco is disbanding his
troops in Spain, and Mussolini's
forces arc about to be sent home.
It seems that the Spanish Moroc
can troops that alarmed the Brit

merely passing the rock on their
way back to their native land.
