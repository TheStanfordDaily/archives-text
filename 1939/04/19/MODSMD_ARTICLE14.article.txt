### 
Beginning at 3 o'clock this after
noon Farm students and faculty
members will celebrate Student-
Faculty Day in a field day of ath
letic events and informal gatherings
on the intramural field. Sponsored
by Axe Society, today's festivities
have been arranged to promote clos
er feeling among students and the
campus faculty members, according
to Gene Coldiron, chairman.
The football men have come to
terms and have divided themselves
into two nines for a five-inning
struggle. Team one is composed of
Andy Stojkovich, Stan Graff, Colin
McClintock, Dave Patterson, Norm
Standlee, Jake Thompson, Floyd
Flueger, Aubrey Austin, and Swede
Johanneson. Team two is comprised
of Rod Parker, Chick Orme, John
Kerman, Hugh Gallarneau, Ken Ro
besky, John Gibson, Steve Keus
seff, Doug Stahl, and Bob Crane.
GROUNDS POLICE
"Axe Society members are re
quested to act as general ground
policemen," said head Chairman
Gene Coldiron last night. "They
should also please remain after sup
per in order to assist in cleaning the
grounds."
According to last night's reports
from food Chairman Bob Living
ston, the number of women who are
to act as servers has been increased
from 16 to 20. Katherine Cady, Vir
ginia Seerie, Jule Lauppe and Ber
nadine Culver yesterday were added
to the list to serve the throng that
will line up at the four dinner tables
at 4:30 o'clock.
"There is plenty of food for ev
ei'yone," said Livingston. "In fact
all that so desire may have seconds.
We will serve Spanish noodles, two
types of fruit salad, ice tea, ice
cream, and chocolate cake until we
run out."
SHORT ON PROFESSORS
Only hitch in the plans for the
day was reported by activities
Chairman Art Gore. In a telephone
talk with Instructor George Knoles,
Gore learned that the Western Civi
lization professors find their ranks
lean in active members. As a result,
vacant positions on the professors'
nine will have to be filled by vol
unteering faculty members this af
ternoon shortly before game time.
"Students and faculty members
should be on the field by 3 o'clock
sharp," was Gore's message. "Fes
tivities will get under way with the
three-legged race. The Committee
hopes to have new student body
President Ken Cuthbertson and a
faculty partner battling it out with
old President Beeb Lee and his
partner Dean Bunn for the three
legged prize."
