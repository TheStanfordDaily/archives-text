the Well."
Miss Jepson is expected to in
clude as an encore another of the
arias for which she is noted, the
"Depuis le jour" from Charpentier's
"Louise."
Helen Jepson, who will sing in
Memorial Hall at 8:15 o'clock to
night, two weeks ahead of the origi
nal time scheduled by the Stanford
Concert Series for its final concert,
will include in her program several
arias from her greatest operatic
roles.
Opening the program with a group
of older numbers, Miss Jepson,
Mertopolitan opera soprano, will
sing the Radamisto Invocation by
Handle, an old song "Polly Willis"
by Arne, and "Alleluia" by Mozart.
DEBUT AS NEDDA
Miss Jepson made her operatic de
but as Nedda in "Pagliacci," and
she has chosen from this opera the
famous "Bird Song," known as the
Ballatella, for tonight's program. In
this aria, Nedda forgets the tragedy
of her position in the opera and sings
joyfully to the forest birds.
Schubert lieder compose the entire
third group. "Fruhlingstraum" or
"Spring Dream," "Dis Post," "Wie
genlied," and "Ungeduld" will be in
cluded. Robert Wallenborn, accom
panist, will continue the program
with a group of three numbers.
Closing the first half of her con
cert, Miss Jepson will sing from
Verdi's "La Traviata" the aria "Ah,
fors e lui" (("Was it he of whom I
dreamed?"). Most of the more mu
sical Stanfordites expect this number
to be one of the highlights of the
evening.
FRENCH SONGS
Following the intermission, Miss
Jepson will sing four French songs
and an aria from French opera. This
group includes "Fantoches," "Je
tremble en voyant," and "Mando
line," all by Debussy, "L'lntruse"
by Fevrier, and the Mirror Song
from Massenet's mystical opera
"Thais."
Concluding selections of the eve
ning are songs by Olmstead, Car
penter, Seymour, and Richard Hage
man, and include "Thy Sweet Sing
ing," "To a Young Gentleman,"
"The Poet's Prayer," and finally "At
the Well."
