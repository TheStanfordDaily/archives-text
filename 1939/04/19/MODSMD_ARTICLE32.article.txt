# 'Shoemaker' Will Feature Baroque Style
## 
### 
An Elizabethan play done in the
costumes of the baroque era is to
be an unusual feature of the De
partment of Speech and Drama pro
duction of Dekker's "Shoemaker's
Holiday," which will be given April
27 and 29 in Memorial Hall, ac
cording to Waldqmar Johansen, di
rector.
In a recent world tour, during
which he made a survey of the
modern European theater, Mr. Jo
hansen saw a performance of "As
You Like It" in Stockholm done in
the same fashion. Feeling that the
anachronistic costumes serve to
heighten the humor, he decided to
use the same idea.
Also new, and in the European
manner, will be the abstract settings.
There will be no attempt made to
make them realistic, and the back
ground of the sets will be projected
on the cyclorama.
This method will speed up the
production, and it will be possible
to play the show straight through
with no breaks for scene switches,
since these will be accomplished by
a simple change of light.
