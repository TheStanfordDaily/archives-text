# First String Wins in Spring Grid Tangle
## Gallarneau, Standlee, Groves Spark A's To 14-7 Triumph 
### 
Witn three members of last sea
son's undefeated frosh team lined up
in the first string forward wall,
Stanford's 1939 football team —minus
those men competing in track and
baseball — played tag for keeps in
yesterday's scrimmage.
The three husky ex-frosh grid
ders were Colin McClintoek, Dave
Patterson, and Winkie Jones. Mc-
Clintock, who is counted upon to fill
Tony Calvelli's hallowed shoes,
looked especially good, as did Pet
erson, a guard.
With Pete Fay, Norm Standlee,
Hugh Gallameau and Jim Groves
all showing a lot of ball-carrying
drive, the first string piled up a two
touchdown to one advantage over
the second string. Rod Parker's line
bucking and speed on quick-opening
plays was the bright spot in the sec
ond team back field.
Swede Johannessen and Bill
Greer also showed up well, Johan
nessen at tackle on the second team
and Greer on the second-string
flank.
The first team lined up as fol
lows: ends, Andy Stojkovich and
Stan Graff; tackles, Jones and Dean
Burford; guards, Patterson and John
Kerman; center, McClintock; quar
ter. Gene Coldiron; halves, Fay and
Gallarneau, with Groves later mov
ing up from the second string to al
ternate with the latter; full, Stand
lee.
Lined up on the seconds' outfit
were: ends, John Gojkovich and
Greer; tackles, John Gibson and Jo
hannessen; guards, Steve Keusseff
and Chick Orme; center, Jake
Thompson; quarter, Ken Robeskey
and Bob Crane; halves, Jerry Spar
ling, Moon Mullins, Groves, and
Bob Olden; full, Parker.
