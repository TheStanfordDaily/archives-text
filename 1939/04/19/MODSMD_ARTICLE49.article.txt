## Frosh Whitewash Santa Clara High 
### 
Coach Harry Shipkey's frosh nine
! yesterday brushed away last Sat
urday's stinging defeat at the hands
i of Gal, and returned in a cyclone of
| 14 hits that boomed them to a 9 to 2
i victory over a lucky Santa Clara
| High School team.
The Farm boys had blood in their
| eyes when they took the Held, and
j starting pitcher Buss Smith, who
took more than a roller coaster ride
last Saturday, hurled airtight base
ball, allowing only two hits in the
first five innings. Though never in
trouble, Smith turned the hurling
task over to Freddy Meyer in the
I last two innings. Meyer coasted to
| the seventh and last inning allowing
I only three hits.
Centerficlder Johnny Sturgeon
continued his bingo streak, by driv
ing out a homer and a three-bagger
' to lead the Cardinal bat parade.
