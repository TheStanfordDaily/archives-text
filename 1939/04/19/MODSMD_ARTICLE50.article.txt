### ARCH JENKINS 
BASEBALL in the Pacific Coast
| Conference is often very screwy;
then again it can reach that thrillâ€”
1 ing stage where every inning i.s as
! line and as cleanly played as pro
j iessional ball.
Stanford baseball this year has
j had a lot of both, though we blush
' in saying that the screw-ball variety
often overshadows the good brand,
Sometimes we don't even stop to
j deny the accusations of a lot ol the
1 sports scribes that the Stanford
baseball team is the "Brooklyn ol
collegiate ball."
It hurts at times but it is often
j 1 rue. If you want visible evidence,
i look at the 14 errors which the shaky
Indians made behind A1 Lazzarone
; in the first 15, innings he pitched this
] year. Quite an average.
BUT WHAT makes us mad i.s that
: Stanford, errors and all, should be
: leading the southern division right
i now. The only game* the Farm
I youngsters really lost was the second
tilt to St. Mary's. The rest were
Christmas presents in the spring
j time.
Coach Harry Wolter has in Lazza
! rone and Cootie Thompson the two
1 best pitchers in the league, bar
| none. If they had an infield with
I the polish and finesse of the St.
; Mary's gang in back of them, they
j probably would have a combined
| earned run average of less than two
| runs.
Lazzarone has the experience and
the coolness, while the younger
! Thompson, still nervous in the tight
] spots, will be definite big league
I material with two more years of
! seasoning and the extra ability he
| can pick up in that time.
THE THING to hope for now is
! that ihe kid infield holds up at Ber
, keley next Saturday in a game that
i could be a walkaway for the local
j squad. The outfield has steadied
I down tremendously and Smoky
i Clark apd Bill Adams have come to
be just about as dangerous a hitting
I duo as any pair in the circuit.
After the Bear tilt, which inci
dentally decides the three-game se
i l ies for the season, Stanford gets a
measly one day rest before hopping
j a train for four league games down
i south in five days. Somebody is go
| ing to have to be awfully steady in
! the clutches if they expect to win
three or four on the tour.
