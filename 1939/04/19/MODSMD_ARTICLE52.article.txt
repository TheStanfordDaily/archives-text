travel south to U.C.L.A. for the Pa- !
cific Coast Conference Southern I
Division meet this coming Saturday.
Coach Nort Thornton *5410rts that
he is taking a full team south for
this important competition, but that j
the way things stand at the present !
time the Cards haven't got a chance j
for first place but that they will run 1
a close second behind the powerful |
U.S.C. team.
Blasting ol the Stanford hopes for
the conference victory came with j
Win Needham's second illness dur- !
ing the season which has kept him
from attaining his best form and
condition; and with Roy Wirikel- I
mann's back injury, which will!
probably cut his diving score way j
down.
The meet will be held in the'

Bruin pools with heats at 10 o'clock
and finals at 2 o'clock Saturday. The
team will leave for the trip south
Friday evening at ti:4s o'clock.
