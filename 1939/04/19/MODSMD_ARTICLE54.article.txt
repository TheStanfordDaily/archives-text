FROM the banner on page one again today,
Stanford may well gather that elections are
over.
To the successful candidates, congratulations
are in order.
Ken Cuthbertson and Coline Upshaw, new
president and vice-president of the Associated
Students, can now look forward to next year
knowing they will have able, enthusiastic, ex
perienced administrators and legislators under
them.
The responsibility that each assumes—re
garded from a practical viewpoint —to the in
dividual is not so great. As a group, however,
the officers-elect have certain definite responsi
bilities that they cannot and must not dodge.
To say so, sounds like a quotation from a high
school teacher instructing students in the prin
ciples of democracy. But to recognize it, is only
intelligent.
Nevertheless, just what that responsibility
is, they will find out when they assume office.
They will find out holding office isn't quite
the picnic they may have imagined.
They will find out student government re
quires long and hard work.
They will find out thai spending A.S.S.U.
funds is probably the most difficult problem
they will come up against.
How well they will do, is up to them —so far,
they've done all right.
As to the elections themselves, the returns
indicate the 50-50 compromise, Stanford has
decided upon—both machines, Row and Hall,
can chalk up moral victories.
It seems, then, that next year is in new hands
—to them:
Congratulations.
