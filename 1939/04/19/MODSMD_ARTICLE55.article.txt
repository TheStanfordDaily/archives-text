TODAY the professors will make fools of
themselves.
They will descend from their rostra, doff
their academic robes —and 10, they will be
human beings like the rest of us. There is a
great deal more to a faculty member than a
platform personality and a high I.Q. If the
students don't find that out today, probably

Prime purpose of Axe Society's annual field
day is to provide optimum conditions for the
sprouting of friendships between professors and
students. From such a beginning, a faculty
contact stands an excellent chance of growing,
maturing, and becoming permanent.
With a student body of less than 4000, Stan

that professors should be regarded as distant
beings whose company is reserved for a lim
ited elect.
Today's program of sports and picnic dinner
are designed to ease the way for student-faculty
contacts. Professors are interesting, valuable
men to know. And they are a hell of a lot of
fun.—L. L.
