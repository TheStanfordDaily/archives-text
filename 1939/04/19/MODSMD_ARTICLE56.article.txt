# A 						Natural Death

### 
LAST fall an attractive little 17-year-old pack
age of dynamite set Stanford on its ear
when she turned cartwheels across the football
field every Saturday afternoon.
And it was only last night that Ex Committee
finished fussing with the controversy that Stan
ford's little majorette stirred up with her ultra
modern yell-leading technique.
Harry Horton's Committee on Non-students
in Student Activities, feeling self-consciously
like a pocket-edition Dies Committee, made its
report. There are no non-students in the band
at present, Horton told Ex Committee, but some
times it must call in outside flutists or horn
players to make sure there is a musician behind
each of its instruments.
It is evident that, although the A.S.S.U. con
stitution provides that "only members of the
association shall represent Stanford at any in
tercollegiate activity," Ex Committee can't very
well tell the band to get along as well as it can
on what Stanford students have to offer in the
way of musical ability and inclination.
The way to handle the problem is to treat
each individual case as it comes up. This is
no place to go into the question of whether the
majorette was racy or whether objectors were
just prudes. The point is that objectionable
outsiders, if they do appear, cannot be disci
plined by the University.
But Stanford can hold thjs constitutional
provision in readiness, enforcing it only when

outsiders overstep the bounds of conduct placed
on Stanford students.â€”R. D.
