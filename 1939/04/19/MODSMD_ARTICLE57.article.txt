# Might Be Possible?

AS the applause dies away in Memorial Hall
tonight, another season of the Stanford
Concert Series will have ended. This year, as
in the past, the A.S.S.U. has presented top-rank
musical artists on the Farm, and has satisfied an
important cultural need of student life.
To Delphine Joy and her able office staff, the
student body owes a vote of thanks. The Con
cert Series has become a local tradition and a
popular one. Sold-out houses and chairs on
the stage have come to be the accepted thing
four times a year.
But one criticism can be offered: Why not
five concerts? With the Associated Students
making money on every artist presented, an
extra concert is certain to fill the coffers at the
same time as it is pleasing the public.
Let the Concert Series end with an "encore"
as well as a "bravo."
