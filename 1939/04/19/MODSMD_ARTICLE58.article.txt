EQUALITY BUT NO FREEDOM

the past two weeks while a troupe of perform
ing politicians has been occupying the center ring
of our Stanford circus, a very entertaining side show
has been going on over at the Junior Prom concession.
Without really meaning to, the boys have staged a mild
class struggle over the question of formal dress for
the dance, and in running its course this quiet bit of
social upheaval turned out some clown acts that al
most outshown the feature stunt.
When the Prom was originally announced as
formal, amateur soap boxers stocked up on throat
spray and thundered that it was "undemocratic." After
listening to the voice of the people for a couple of
weeks, the committee gave in and changed the Prom
to "semi-formal."
The debate is one of those fluffy, trivial discussions
that make young intellectuals froth at the mouth. And
even the Prom committee managed to ride through the
crisis without getting wild-eyed or harried. But I find
the arguments interesting.
My experience has always been that there is noth
ing more democratic than a tuxedo. I regard it, in fact,
as equalitarianism in its highest development. The
dinner coat is designed for the express purpose of
making all men look alike. It is intended to cancel
out differences, to reduce all who wear it to the same
dead level of black and white.
r tuxedo makes the football player and the chcm
major look the same. Its padding makes the
shoulders of the debater as impressive at the massive
superstructure of the charging back. Its armor plate
shirt front builds a deep, masculine chest that ten
years in a gym couldn't duplicate.
The democratic influence of the dinner coat tran
scends the fact that it is traditionally associated with
wealth; for the tuxedo is the instrument for equaliz
ing those fundamental inequalities by which nature
shortchanges her step-children. There is no other force
known to civilization which can cancel out differences
so effectively.

Another interesting aspect of formal dress is the
fine spirit of communism that prevails on the question
of ownership of dress accessories. A black tie is pi'ac
tically the definition of community property. Studs,
collars, and shirts circulate with a disregard of prop
erty rights which even Soviet Russia cannot demon
strate.
There are many counts on which the tuxedo can
be indicted. We can apply the same objections that
the medieval knights did to their soup-can suits. But
democracy is not an issue. Anybody can give the com
mon man equality of opportunity. It has taken twenty
centuries of civilization to give him equality of
shoulders.
