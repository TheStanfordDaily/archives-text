### DOUG JAQUES 
FROSII ONCE REMOVED
An ex-roommate tells me that they have solved
the problem of where to house junior transfers next
year: everyone in Branner is going to be kicked out.
(For the benefit of those two people who believe
everything I write, my ex-roommate was exaggerat
ing).
But the Administration will do something after the
mass battle the children in Branner held Monday night.
I suggest they give the janitors water wings.
If I know my ex-roommate, he was scouring the
hall for a sailboat; the water was that deep. A gun
boat would have been more the thing.
The boys in Sequoia were amazed. They say it
was the worst water fight they had ever heard of.
I hear that the water was two inches deep on the
second floor. How deep would that make the water
on the first floor?
I wish someone would give our rushing chairman a
list of names of the guys in Branner who can't swim.

SO WHAT
A pedant tells me that all the junior women who
ran for offices in the election yesterday were minus
one in the Bawlout; no more and no less. lie says he
looked them all up.
I am too much of a gentleman 1o think that he
made a deal with each of them for his vote.

mc, SHOTS
After the things they do to our sports pages with
their ads, I sometimes wonder why we do not snipe
at the business staff boys whenever they walk through
our office.
They think of nothing but money.
I went in their office yesterday to buy a stamp.
They would not sell me a stamp because they said I
would have to make out a requisition to get one!
That's keeping your eyes on things, boys.

PARTY
People will never learn about these Joe Louis
fights.
Three Union girls were going to listen to the Roper
fight. They would make a party of it. A fight, they
said, is an exciting thing. They went down to the Cel
lar to get three cases of coke. They were going to
enjoy that fight.
They were just passing the cashier's window, each
carrying her case of coke, when the fight ended.

They say that at the second Louis-Schmeling fight
one man who had paid upwards of $20 for his seat
leaned over to light a cigarette as the fight started
and missed the whole tiling.
