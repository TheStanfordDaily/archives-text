Located throughout Europe and America and away from the busy
cities arc youth hostels, which afford the young people of the world
an opportunity to "get away from it all."
Purpose of American Youth Hostels is to help all, especially young
people, to a greater knowledge, understanding, and pleasure in the

world by providing for them hostels,♦
bicycle trails, and foot paths in
America, and by assisting them in
their travels both here and abroad.
The movement began in Germany
after the war at a time when eco
nomic stress presented a dismal fu
ture to the young people, It was
part of an idea to get young people
into the country, where simpler
pleasures could be found. Hostels,
which are lodging places, were
built as headquarters lor-the youth
from the cities.
REACHES AMERICA
Hosteling was brought to America
in 1933 and since then ihe move
ment has spread rapidly throughout
the country. It was introduced in I
California only six months ago and
the only chain of hostels yet estab- j
lished is on the Peninsula.
This chain of six is now in op- |
eration from Montara on Half Moon 1
Bay over the Skyline to the Hidden I
Villa Hostel in Los Altos, and end- \
ing at Saratoga Summit.
They are located near back roads |
or trails, equipped with separate |
bunkrooms, blankets, mattresses, and j
washing, cooking, and recreation j
facilities. It costs 25 cents to spend j
the night at a hostel, and food may
be purchased there.
HIKERS ONLY
A requisite for hosteling is that ;
participants hike or cycle on the J
trip. A pass must be secured, which ;
entitles one to the use of hostels in l
America, and, by obtaining an addi- j
tional stamp, the pass holders may
use the European Hostels.
