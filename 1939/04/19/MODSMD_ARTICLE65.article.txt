### 
Yesterday we ran an advertise
ment emphasizing the fun of college
life on Lake Lagunita which pos
| sible parent-subscribers might want
; to follow in Tlie Daily.
With the lake in its present con-
I dition, there won't be any Junior
j Water Carnival or candid shots of
; swimmers, but there are numerous
I other events scheduled for this
j quarter that are sure to capture the
I attention of parents.

contain more minerals, especially
iron, than fresh fruits.
