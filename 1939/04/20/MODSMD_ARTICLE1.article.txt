### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
JpiPTY years ago today Adolf Hit
ler was bom into an unsuspect
ing world. There was no indication
then, or in the years that followed,
that this was to be the twentieth
century's man of destiny.
The germ of an idea was fixed in
his brain, an idea which matured
and acquired more definite form un
til finally it was recorded in "Mein
Kampf." Reduced to its essentials,
it was a project for the rebuilding
of the defeated Germany that came
out of the Great War.
Key steps in the movement were
the restoration of the Reich's eco
nomic self-sufficicncy, its territo
rial empire, its world trade. But
far more important than any of
these, was the revival of the self
respect of the German people.
Only when the Reich was able to
rise again, powerful and feared,
could it escape the stigma of the
defeated criminal.
In the Treaty of Versailles, the
allied nations passed a life-sentence
on Germany, a moral and physical
penalty which this generation could
not outlive. Only in the creation of
a new nationalism, based on a fresh
philosophy, was there hope for the
Fatherland. This was the mental set
of Adolf Hitler, the idea that became
the gospel of Naziism.
* * *
IT MATTERED little to this re
markable Austrian what means he
used to accomplish his purpose. He
needed a scapegoat, and seized the
most obvious one available, the
Jews. With propaganda as his only
weapon, Hitler has fought and near
ly won "Mein Kampf."
Today Germany can look the
world in the eye; she can stare
down the nations of Europe be
cause she knows that once again
they fear and distrust her. In the
wake of the Nazi drive have ap
peared a regimented people, a
prostituted culture, a nation where
liberty and individualism are un
known.
Instead of being an international
criminal, Germany is a gxeat power.
The question is, was it worth the
price?

I put. this question one night last
summer to a young Nazi law stu
dent, a leader of the Hitler youth
movement. He answexed me with a
mechanical summary of the restora
tion of self-respect accomplished by
the absolutist government.
But as the hour grew late and
the conversation, confidential, he
admitted that the cost had been
horrible, perhaps too great for the
results that had been accomplish
ed. Germany today is the creation
of Adolf Hitler, the fulfillment of
the dreams of a single man. With
him it stands; wtihout him. the
people will ocmc to realize, as my
friend did. that it was not worth
the price.
* * *
the Reich will celebrate
its Fuehrer's birthday with a
tremendous demonstration of armed
strength. Forty thousand men will
goose-step by the reviewing stand
as a sample of German military
readiness. Propaganda-stuffed Nazis
will hail their chief as the greatest
man in the world. And they will
be right.
With hate, intolerance, and cruel
ty Adolf Hitler has achieved a ter
rifying success. Today, as in 1914,
Germany dominates the western
world. Twenty-five years ago the
allies put an end to German aggres
sion with a devastating war.

The end of an aggressive Reich
does not necessarily mean a re
turn to economic and political tur
moil of the 1920'5. Under ideal
conditions, it could result in Ger
many taking her proper place in
the international scene and a re
turn to equilibrium.
Unfortunately world events sel
dom run in such rational channels.
Because we are human beings, am
bitious, blind, and vain, someone
usually has to end in the dust. Cur
rent trends indicate that it will be
Germany.

tion of self-respect accomplished by
the absolutist government.
But as the hour grew late and
the conversation, confidential, he
admitted that the cost had been
horrible, perhaps too great for the
results that had been accomplish
ed. Germany today is the creation
of Adolf Hitler, the fulfillment of
the dreams of a single man. With
him it stands; wtihout him. the

the Reich will celebrate

readiness. Propaganda-stuffed Nazis

man in the world. And they will
be right.
With hate, intolerance, and cruel

The germ of an idea was fixed in
his brain, an idea which matured
and acquired more definite form un
til finally it was recorded in "Mein
Kampf." Reduced to its essentials,
it was a project for the rebuilding
of the defeated Germany that came
out of the Great War.
Key steps in the movement were
the restoration of the Reich's eco
nomic self-sufficicncy, its territo
rial empire, its world trade. But
far more important than any of
these, was the revival of the self
respect of the German people.
Only when the Reich was able to
rise again, powerful and feared,
could it escape the stigma of the
defeated criminal.
In the Treaty of Versailles, the
allied nations passed a life-sentence
on Germany, a moral and physical
penalty which this generation could
not outlive. Only in the creation of
a new nationalism, based on a fresh

Fatherland. This was the mental set
