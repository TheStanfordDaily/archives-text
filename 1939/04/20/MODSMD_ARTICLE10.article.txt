# Cuthbertson-Chapin Win Tri-leg Race; Freshman Hurt in Field Day Meet
## 
### BUD AMES 
Spurred by the shouts and good
natured cat calls of over a thousand
closely packed students and faculty
members, newly elected student
Body President Ken Cuthbertson
and his duo-mate, Associate Profes
sor Leland Chapin, yesterday after
noon hobbled to a disputed victory
in the three-legged race, the feature
event of a more than successful
Student-Faculty Day.
Though only the third team to
stumble across the finish line,
Cuthbertson and Chapin were
awarded the victors' laurels after
the first place duo of Jack Calder
wood and Sophomore Jack Alltueker
were eliminated since neither was a
faculty member, and after last
year's winners, Dean Bunn and
Beeb Lee, were disqualified for a
false start.
Activities for the afternoon got
under way with a diamond battle
between a skimpy faculty team led
by Dean Bunn and a strong Encina
nine which, under the captaincy of
Bill Cowdin, pounded their way to a
13 to 8 victory.
At the same time the football
players were contesting in two
chosen squads on another diamond.
Most noticeable player was hefty
Lucille Casey, who pitched a strong
but. losing battle for the Andy Stoj
kovich nine. Gene Coldiron's team
won by a 6 to 2 score.
