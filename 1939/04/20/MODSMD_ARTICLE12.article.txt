# Branner Flooded In Water Fight
## 
### 
Laying down a barrage of water
which covered floors in Branner
Hall to a depth of two inches, and
later soaked through the plaster
ceiling in the lobby, a group of
screaming Branner men broke out
fire hoses last Monday night in this
year's biggest water fight.
Commenting on disposal of the
case, Dean of Men John Bunn said
yesterday, "This is strictly a student
problem. We have student govern
ment, and therefore we have stu
dent responsibility. The matter will
be dealt with by Men's Council."
At the start of the riot, Ray Sulli
van, Branner custodian, halted the
affair by turning out the lights.
Called out of the hall later in the
evening to aid Officer George Burns
in investigating a robbery in Bran
ner, Sullivan returned to find the
hall flooded.
The mob moved on to Toyon, after
fioding their own hall, but. were
there disbanded by Bob Krupp,
Toyon custodian. To minimize the
damage, campus janitors were called
out of bed at 11:30 o'clock to mop
up corridors.
