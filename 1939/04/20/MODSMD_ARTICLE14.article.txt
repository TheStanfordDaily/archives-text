# Cardinals Discuss Masque Ball Plans
## 
### 
"Arabian Nights" was chosen as
the theme of the 1939 Masque Ball,
which will climax the Convalescent
Home Drive on May 5, at last night's
meeting of Cardinals. In keeping
with the oriental idea, dancers will
be asked to wear masks this year,
1 according to Dick Lyon, co-chair
man.
[ Carvel Craig, who played in San
j Francisco last year, was said to have
| returned to the Coast, after a series
j of engagements in the East, and it
j was hoped that his orchestra could
I be secured for the dance.
