# Science Plus Music Equals Concert
## 
### 
"A Concert in Color," the Glee i
Club concert Saturday night, is no j
mere publicity-getting title, accord- j
ing to Assistant Professor of Psy
chology Robert Ross.
The color is the culmination of I
four years of research by Professor
Ross at Yale University and at
Stanford, while the concert adds the
final touch to a year of numerous j
appearances by both men's and
women's glee clubs, combined for the J
coming program.
Each composition to be sung in the 1
six groups will be set appropriately ;
by one and two-color backgrounds, j
some of which will change through- j
out the course of the number. Sci- i
entifically chosen from Mr. Ross'
experimental work to coincide with ;
audience l'eaction to the colors and
the music independently, the two
artistic features will complement
each other in determining mood of '
listeners,
Religious compositions, including '
"Adoremus Te" and "Tenebrae '

Factae Suit" by Palestrina will have
royal purple backgrounds. To ob
tain the correct setting for these, and
other works to be sung Saturday
night, a significant number of over
600 men and women tested by Mr.
Ross used the same adjective to de
scribe the mood suggested by both
compositions and colors to be used.
Lighter works will use yellow, or
ange, and red backgrounds, while
the suggestive "Sleigh Song" and
"Winter Song" will be set in com
binations with white predominat
ing.
Modern works will end the varied
program to be sung, with the popu
lar Romberg "Lover Come Back to
Me," and "Frankie and Johnnie,"
arranged for Glee Clubs by Clokey.
Tickets are on sale for the concert,
which begins Saturday nitÂ»ht. at 8:15
o'clock, at the A.S.S.U. office in the
Old Union, and at Keeble's in Palo
Alto. Prices are 40 cents for stu
dents, 50 cents for general admis
sion.
