# A.S.S.U. Amendment Void After Failing to Poll Two-thirds Majority
## Theta Xi Discovers Printer's Error; Excom Reverses Tuesday Action After Proposal in Existence 24 Hours 
### 
Because the printer made a mistake . . .
Becausc one voter in Tuesday's elections was disgruntled . . .
Because the Tlieta Xi's only copy of the A.S.S.U. Constitution and
By-laws was the 1936-37 edition . . .
Thai's why the graduate women's constitutional amendment is dead
today, after a short 24 hours' existence, dead because it did not receive

the necessary two-thirds majority of
votes. â€¢
It happened this way:
Article 8, section 4 of the Consti
tution provides that "Two-third of
the votes cast on a proposed amend
ment shall be required for its
adoption."
SECTION MISPLACED
In the 1937-38 edition of the Con
stitution and By-laws, this section,
and the one preceding it, were mis
placed by the printer when the book
\Vas being put together. Instead of
being in their proper place, at the
end of Article 8. entitled 'Amend
ments," the two fictions were put
at the end of Article 5, "Finances."
Thus the Election Board, when
checking up on regulations previous
to the election, knew nothing of the
two-thirds majority requirement for
constitutional amendments. As a re
sult, the amendment, which received
a 1015-598 vote, was okayed by Ex
Committee Tuesday night.
IRKED HIM
However, Bill Mitchell, Theta Xi
junior, was irked when he read that
the amendment had passed. Out of
curiosity, and clinging to a last
hope, he checked the Constitution
to see whether or not a two-thirds
majority was necessary.
When Mitchell decided to look into
the matter, he uncovered (he mis- j
take, since his copy of the Constitu
tion was the 193(5-37 edition, which
had the section quoted above printed
in its correct place.
CHECKED DISCOVERY
He brought the question to the at- j
tention of The Daily, and a Daily j
representative checked the various;
editions of the Constitution with;
officials of the A.S.S.U., finding that I
Mitchell was correct in his discov- :
cry.
Yesterday afternoon, by telephone 1
poll, Ex Committee reversed its ac
tion of Tuesday night in regard to
the amendment, and issued a state
ment which declared the amend
ment dead, since it had not attained
the required two-thirds majority.
SPECIAL ELECTION?
According to H. B. Lee, student
body president, the amendment can
be put before the students at the
next election in February, 1940, or
can be forced into a special election
if its proponents obtain a petition
containing 150 names.
Elaine Newbrand, president of
the Graduate Women's Association,
relused to comment on the matter.
