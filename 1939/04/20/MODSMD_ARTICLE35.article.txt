### ARCH JENKINS 
SOMETIMES YOU never really :
realize how valuable prized posses
sions are until you lose them.
I
And the closest thing to complete]
realization of how terrific a loss can j
be is the pulled muscle which j
caught Sid Hayes as he started his j
second flight of high hurdles in a |
twilight meet last night. The bril- !
liant sophomore topper had al- |
ready run a 14:5 flight. He and Bill |
Hawkins were a cinch to run one- j
two in the Big Meet, and Hayes j
was counted upon for a second in |
the lows.
His loss is going to drag the ulti
mate outcome of the meet down to j
the relay. Stanford could win that |
except for four minor facts which I
might be worth mentioning in pass- |
ing. Clyde Jeffrey, the likely an- |
chor man, will have run a 220 a j
scant 10 minutes before, George j
Rockwell has a heavily bandaged j
right leg, Craig Williamson is nurs- i
ing sore feet although he is on the |
road back, and Ernie Clark, a po- i
tential winner in the quarter mile,!
is wasting away in the Rest Home j
with odds of about 5 to 1 that he j
won't even see the meet.
Something might develop before J
tomorrow or Saturday that will put l
Stanford back in the running. Un
til then, you'd all better cancel those |
bets we advised you to make a few |
days ago. How were we to know j
that the gods were against us? |
Somebody isn't living right.

A BRIGHT spot, however, in the j
contemporary picture was the per- j
formance of Stanford tennis aces in i
the N.C.A.A. sectional qualifying!
round yesterday. The Indians, beat- !
en down in six consecutive confer- ■
once starts, qualified three men for
the national championships and
might qualify two more today in
singles as well as the Bob Low-Jim
Seaver doubles team, which looks
like a cinch to win over Cal's num
ber 3 duo this afternoon.
It's regrettable that the Indians
have to be in a league as tough as
the California sector of the Coast '
Conference. In any other locale, !
Stanford's netsters would be poten- :
tial champions. As it is, they usual- j
ly have to take a back seat to the j
super, super teams sent forth by
Calitornia and U.S.C.
If nothing else, the present tour- '

nament is showing that the Indians
are not set-ups. Not when little
guys like Jack Laney can bounce
the heavy favorites like Ron Lubin,
the Troy ace of aces, out of the
running in the first round.

A BRIGHT spot, however, in the j
contemporary picture was the per- j
formance of Stanford tennis aces in i
the N.C.A.A. sectional qualifying!
round yesterday. The Indians, beat- !
en down in six consecutive confer- ■
once starts, qualified three men for
the national championships and
might qualify two more today in
singles as well as the Bob Low-Jim
Seaver doubles team, which looks
like a cinch to win over Cal's num
ber 3 duo this afternoon.
It's regrettable that the Indians
have to be in a league as tough as
the California sector of the Coast '
Conference. In any other locale, !
Stanford's netsters would be poten- :
tial champions. As it is, they usual- j
ly have to take a back seat to the j
super, super teams sent forth by
Calitornia and U.S.C.
If nothing else, the present tour- '

nament is showing that the Indians
are not set-ups. Not when little
guys like Jack Laney can bounce
the heavy favorites like Ron Lubin,
the Troy ace of aces, out of the
running in the first round.
SOMETIMES YOU never really :
realize how valuable prized posses
sions are until you lose them.
I
And the closest thing to complete]
realization of how terrific a loss can j
be is the pulled muscle which j
caught Sid Hayes as he started his j
second flight of high hurdles in a |
twilight meet last night. The bril- !
liant sophomore topper had al- |
ready run a 14:5 flight. He and Bill |
Hawkins were a cinch to run one- j
two in the Big Meet, and Hayes j
was counted upon for a second in |
the lows.
His loss is going to drag the ulti
mate outcome of the meet down to j
the relay. Stanford could win that |
except for four minor facts which I
might be worth mentioning in pass- |
ing. Clyde Jeffrey, the likely an- |
chor man, will have run a 220 a j
scant 10 minutes before, George j
Rockwell has a heavily bandaged j
right leg, Craig Williamson is nurs- i
ing sore feet although he is on the |
road back, and Ernie Clark, a po- i
tential winner in the quarter mile,!
is wasting away in the Rest Home j
with odds of about 5 to 1 that he j
won't even see the meet.
Something might develop before J
tomorrow or Saturday that will put l
Stanford back in the running. Un
til then, you'd all better cancel those |
bets we advised you to make a few |
days ago. How were we to know j
that the gods were against us? |
