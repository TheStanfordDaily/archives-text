# Farm Nine Preps for Cal
## Thompson to Pitch Third Tilt of Series 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter and his Card
varsity baseballers are spending the
week in comparative inactivity on
the sunken diamond preparing for
the five-game drive that will wind
up the 1939 California Intercollegiate
Baseball Association season. Start
ing with the third Cal game this Sat
urday, the diamondmen will play
five times in six days.
"Cootie" Thompson will have the
pitching assignment against the
Bears in the deciding tilt of the
three-game series Saturday. He has
allowed the Berkeleymen only ten
hits in the two games he has
pitched against them already this
season.
California's coach, Clint Evans,
will be hard pi'essed to make his
pitching selection. Mike Koll, his
star portsider, walked off the mound
with an injured shoulder after less
than two innings of very mediocre
relief work in last Saturday's game.
Audie Daugherty started for the
Bears in the first two games of the
series, and was no mystery to the
Stanford batsmen.
"Dan" Boone, third baseman, and
"Smoke" Clark, left fielder, have led
the Cards' attack on the team from
across the bay. Boone has made five
hits, one a double, and Clark has
connected for the four safe blows.
After the Cal game the team will
entrain for Los Angeles, where they
close the season with games against
U.S.C. Monday and Wednesday, and
against U.C.L.A. Tuesday and
Thursday.
