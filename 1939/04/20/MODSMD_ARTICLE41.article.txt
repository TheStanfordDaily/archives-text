noon. John Dern, old-timer from El
Toro, is tabbed to win both distance
runs, the half and the mile. Way
back in 1937, John won the mile,
copped seconds in the half and the
two-mile. By winning his half-mile
heat in 2:06. Dean shows signs of re
turning form and will bear watch
ing today.
The Medical School's middle dis
tance ace, George Downing, by vir
tue of his performance last Tuesday,
seems to be a cinch in the quarter
and may press Dern in the 880.
The other defending champs are
three of the four members of D.U.'s
1938 winning and record holding
880-yard relay team. If any intra
mural records are broken today, the
odds are strong in favor of these
D.U. baton passers.
