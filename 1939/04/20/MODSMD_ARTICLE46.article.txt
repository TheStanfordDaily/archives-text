## 
### 
Gloom settled over Angell Field
at last evening's meet when Stan
ford's chances against California in
Saturday's Big Meet went from a
sure thing to very uncertain toss-up
with the injury of hurdler Sid Hayes.
Sid had just proved himself the
Indians' best bet in the high barrier
race by nosing out by inches team
mate Bill Hawkins in a 14.5 flight.
At the second hurdle of a second
flight, marred by many false starts,
Sid pulled up with a lame leg.
The injury was a newly pulled
muscle, not a recurrence of the
ailment Sid recently got over. This
will' definitely keep Sid from the
Cal meet and even his chances of
running against U.S.C. are doubt
ful.
This runs the list of ailing cinder
men to five. Walt McKenzie is a
new addition with an injured shoul
der incurred by a fall down a flight
of stairs. Then there is Russ Wolfe
and Bob Kenyon, who still are nurs
ing sprained ankles. Finally comes
Ernie Clark whose sinus trouble
will cut his day's activities against
Cal to a mere lap in the relay.
