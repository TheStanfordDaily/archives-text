AS a newsworthy and authoritative comment
on Stanford and Peace, The Daily prints
the following, written by Edwin K. Dole of the
Department of Political Science:
The Stanford Peace Council, as a result of
the poll which it conducted, found that Stan
ford favors a policy of neutrality and isolation
as the best means for the United States to re
main at peace.
This conclusion has been given considerable
publicity in the newspapers of San Francisco
and Los Angeles as being representative of
Stanford undergraduate opinion. Due to this
fact, I am writing this to present evidence tend
ing to show that the result obtained by this poll
is not a valid expression of what Stanford thinks
on the subject.
During fall quarter, in the course given in
Introduction to International Law, 115 students
were asked to express their opinions on the
question of whether they favored neutrality
and isolation or international co-operation on
the part of the United States as the better means
of keeping out of war.
Ninety-five students believed that interna
tional co-operation was the better method,
whereas only 15 favored a policy of isolation
and neutrality. Five were uncertain.
At the end of winter quarter, the class in
International Organization for Peace was asked
to evaluate between a policy of international
co-operation and a policy of neutrality, isolation,
and the Ludlow Amendment as the best means
of keeping the United States at peace. Out of a
total of 160 students, 157 favored U.S. co-opera
tion with all nations to maintain peace.
And practically all felt that the United States
should line up solidly with the democracies in
the present situation. Three students thought
that we should remain aloof and let them "stew
in their own juice."
Perhaps the 80 students "picked at random"
by the peace council was too small a group to
get a fair sampling of true Stanford opinion.
Perhaps the 275 students in these two classes of
whose reactions I speak are not representative
of the sum total of Stanford thought on the
matter.
However, it does show that among those stu
dents who weigh international affairs and con
sider the problems of peace scientifically there
is a vast majority who oppose a policy of iso
lation and neutrality for the United States. And
more and more students are beginning to think
about international affairs seriously and to con
sider the problem of peace as their problem.
But regardless of what the "Farm" thinks is
the better policy to keep the United States out
of war, if war comes, whether it is fought on
United States soil or on foreign soil, the stu
dents who voted in the "Peace Poll" will be in
that war.
Not 47 per cent of them, but 100 per cent.
There will be no opportunity to refuse to fight.

AS a newsworthy and authoritative comment
on Stanford and Peace, The Daily prints
the following, written by Edwin K. Dole of the
Department of Political Science:
The Stanford Peace Council, as a result of
the poll which it conducted, found that Stan
ford favors a policy of neutrality and isolation
as the best means for the United States to re
main at peace.
This conclusion has been given considerable
publicity in the newspapers of San Francisco
and Los Angeles as being representative of
Stanford undergraduate opinion. Due to this
fact, I am writing this to present evidence tend
ing to show that the result obtained by this poll
is not a valid expression of what Stanford thinks
on the subject.
During fall quarter, in the course given in
Introduction to International Law, 115 students
were asked to express their opinions on the
question of whether they favored neutrality
and isolation or international co-operation on
the part of the United States as the better means
of keeping out of war.
Ninety-five students believed that interna
tional co-operation was the better method,
whereas only 15 favored a policy of isolation
and neutrality. Five were uncertain.
At the end of winter quarter, the class in
International Organization for Peace was asked
to evaluate between a policy of international
co-operation and a policy of neutrality, isolation,
and the Ludlow Amendment as the best means
of keeping the United States at peace. Out of a
total of 160 students, 157 favored U.S. co-opera
tion with all nations to maintain peace.
And practically all felt that the United States
should line up solidly with the democracies in
the present situation. Three students thought
that we should remain aloof and let them "stew
in their own juice."
Perhaps the 80 students "picked at random"
by the peace council was too small a group to
get a fair sampling of true Stanford opinion.
Perhaps the 275 students in these two classes of
whose reactions I speak are not representative
of the sum total of Stanford thought on the
matter.
However, it does show that among those stu
dents who weigh international affairs and con
sider the problems of peace scientifically there
is a vast majority who oppose a policy of iso
lation and neutrality for the United States. And
more and more students are beginning to think
about international affairs seriously and to con
sider the problem of peace as their problem.
But regardless of what the "Farm" thinks is
the better policy to keep the United States out
of war, if war comes, whether it is fought on
United States soil or on foreign soil, the stu
dents who voted in the "Peace Poll" will be in
that war.
Not 47 per cent of them, but 100 per cent.
There will be no opportunity to refuse to fight.
