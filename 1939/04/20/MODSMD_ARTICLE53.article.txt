# BULL SESSION
## 
### JOHN COBBS 
ALLELUIA
JOB had his boils; Washington had his Valley Forge;
Stanford had its constitutional amendment requir
ing a graduate woman on Ex Committee. For all of us
there was a happy issue out of our afflictions. It
seems that God is accustomed to test our faith by
visiting us with plagues; if we come through with a
C average, He rewards us.
This is the only explanation I can find for the polit
ical gymnastics staged by the amendment which ap
peared on last Tuesday's ballot. On the evening of
election day it appeared that the change had passed
in spite of the fact that it was contrary to all the prin
ciples of political science. Evidently the electorate had
been in a hurry to get a coke and had voted "Yes"
without bothering to wade through the page of type.
My faith in democracy wavered.
But yesterday afternoon a patriotic gentleman,
one Bill Mitchell, up the Row discovered that God was
only fooling. According to the Constitution amend
ments must receive two-thirds of the votes cast to
pass. There were 1015 votes for the amendment, 598
against. This means that it failed by a margin of 61
votes.
Ex Committee and election board accepted the re
turns without question because for the last two years
the Constitution has contained a couple of changes
introduced by the printer without the formality of a
student body vote. The two sections setting up re
quirements for vote on amendments have been tucked
away under the wrong heading, and apparently noth
ing is said about two-thirds majority.
* * * *
regardless of typographical legislation, the Con
stitution stands as it was originally written. And
the amendment fails by 61 votes. Ex Committee
blushes and mumbles its apologies.
In this moment of rejoicing, it would not be appro -
priate to draw morals or make points. But it would be
a good idea to see to it that our faith isn't tested again
soon.
The Constitution is suggested as light reading for
student officials, particularly for election board. An
other brilliant move would be to have an intelligent
proof reader go through the copies we use. It is no
testimonial to our alertness when an essential section
gets lost for two years in 18 pocket-size pages.
♦ ♦ * #
Some 1015 voters might make a contribution by
checking over their memories to see whether or not
they read the amendment they approved. And Ex
Committee might make a memo to the effect that once
an amendment gets on the ballot at Stanford, our
amiable electorate is inclined to okay it without both
ering to check its credentials.
But as I said, this is no time to learn lessons. It. is
an occasion for thanksgiving and dancing in the
streets. God has paid off.

C average, He rewards us.
This is the only explanation I can find for the polit
ical gymnastics staged by the amendment which ap
peared on last Tuesday's ballot. On the evening of
election day it appeared that the change had passed
in spite of the fact that it was contrary to all the prin
ciples of political science. Evidently the electorate had
been in a hurry to get a coke and had voted "Yes"
without bothering to wade through the page of type.
My faith in democracy wavered.
But yesterday afternoon a patriotic gentleman,
one Bill Mitchell, up the Row discovered that God was
only fooling. According to the Constitution amend
ments must receive two-thirds of the votes cast to
pass. There were 1015 votes for the amendment, 598
against. This means that it failed by a margin of 61
votes.
Ex Committee and election board accepted the re
turns without question because for the last two years
the Constitution has contained a couple of changes
introduced by the printer without the formality of a
student body vote. The two sections setting up re
quirements for vote on amendments have been tucked
away under the wrong heading, and apparently noth
ing is said about two-thirds majority.
* * * *
regardless of typographical legislation, the Con
stitution stands as it was originally written. And
the amendment fails by 61 votes. Ex Committee
blushes and mumbles its apologies.
In this moment of rejoicing, it would not be appro -
priate to draw morals or make points. But it would be
a good idea to see to it that our faith isn't tested again
soon.
The Constitution is suggested as light reading for
student officials, particularly for election board. An
other brilliant move would be to have an intelligent
proof reader go through the copies we use. It is no
testimonial to our alertness when an essential section
gets lost for two years in 18 pocket-size pages.

Some 1015 voters might make a contribution by
checking over their memories to see whether or not
they read the amendment they approved. And Ex
Committee might make a memo to the effect that once
an amendment gets on the ballot at Stanford, our
amiable electorate is inclined to okay it without both
ering to check its credentials.
But as I said, this is no time to learn lessons. It. is
an occasion for thanksgiving and dancing in the
streets. God has paid off.

JOB had his boils; Washington had his Valley Forge;
Stanford had its constitutional amendment requir
ing a graduate woman on Ex Committee. For all of us
there was a happy issue out of our afflictions. It
seems that God is accustomed to test our faith by
visiting us with plagues; if we come through with a
C average, He rewards us.
