# Lightly ... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
TABLEAU
At the Paul Engle lecture Tuesday night, a .some
what elderly couple who had had garlic for dinner
4 came into the lecture a little late.
It wasn't five minutes before ihey were both sound
asleep, the woman with her head on the man's shoulder
and the man with his head way back flopping around,
and his mouth wide open.

SABOTAGE
In Encina the other night, one of the frosh was
having trouble wilh the light hanging in the middle
of his room. It kept blinking on and off like on a
signboard. He stood it as long as he could, and then
went for the night watchman.
When he came back to the room with the night
watchman, the light worked perfectly. Not a blink.
The night watchman got very sore at being dragged
in to look at a light that did not blink.
All of which makes us very proud of the guy who
works as bankboy in The Daily backshop, and lives
in the room above this kid. He knows a thing or two
about electricity. He knows a thing about prying down
through the floor to the light in the room beneath him
and making the light blink on and off. He knows how
to stop the light from blinking as soon as someone
goes for the night watchman.
He can probably do it night after night.

Over in the geology building they have a great

The poet Paul Engle was explaining a part of a
poem he had written. "I was in England," he said,
"and I felt the desire for corn."
So he wrote a poem.
Play it loud and play it hot.

YOU'RE A CUTE LITTLE FELLOW
Overheard on the Quad:
A female English major wearing glasses say to a
male English major wearing a necktie, "Dr. X is ill,
and we won't have any classes until Monday."
"Oh, that's marvelous," he said.

I can sec them in a few years married to each other
or to people just like each other.
"We shall have ice cream tonight for dinner," she
will say.
"Oh. that's marvelous," he will answer.
"Chocolate ice cream."
"Delightful."
How sweet they will be to each other.

YOU'RE A CUTE LITTLE FELLOW
Overheard on the Quad:
A female English major wearing glasses say to a
male English major wearing a necktie, "Dr. X is ill,
and we won't have any classes until Monday."
"Oh, that's marvelous," he said.

I can sec them in a few years married to each other
or to people just like each other.
"We shall have ice cream tonight for dinner," she
will say.
"Oh. that's marvelous," he will answer.
"Chocolate ice cream."
"Delightful."
How sweet they will be to each other.
TABLEAU
At the Paul Engle lecture Tuesday night, a .some
what elderly couple who had had garlic for dinner
4 came into the lecture a little late.
It wasn't five minutes before ihey were both sound
asleep, the woman with her head on the man's shoulder
and the man with his head way back flopping around,
and his mouth wide open.

SABOTAGE
In Encina the other night, one of the frosh was
having trouble wilh the light hanging in the middle
of his room. It kept blinking on and off like on a
signboard. He stood it as long as he could, and then
went for the night watchman.
When he came back to the room with the night
watchman, the light worked perfectly. Not a blink.
The night watchman got very sore at being dragged
in to look at a light that did not blink.
All of which makes us very proud of the guy who
works as bankboy in The Daily backshop, and lives
in the room above this kid. He knows a thing or two
about electricity. He knows a thing about prying down
through the floor to the light in the room beneath him
and making the light blink on and off. He knows how
to stop the light from blinking as soon as someone
goes for the night watchman.
He can probably do it night after night.

TRADITIONAL DANCE
Over in the geology building they have a great
chart graphically showing all of the geological periods
since the earth began. At one place there is the desig
nation: cenozoic. Next to this is the sign, "Junior
Prom."
But the music will be of tomorrow.

JAZZ AGE
The poet Paul Engle was explaining a part of a
poem he had written. "I was in England," he said,
"and I felt the desire for corn."
So he wrote a poem.
