# Jepson Charms Hall Audience In Closing Series Concert
## 
### JOHN FLAHERTY 
Stanford's already - successful
1938-39 Concert Scries drew to a
delightful end last night when so
prano Helen Jepson brought an eve
ning of song as charming and grace
ful as herself.
With a voice always fx'esh and
clear, skillfully controlled, Miss
Jepson sang an interestingly varied
program, admirably suited to dis
play the artistic accomplishments
which have already made her well
known on radio and concert stage.
Her program opened with a well
received group of the "Invocation,
from 'Radamisto'," by Handel; "Polly
Willis," Arne; and the beautiful "Al
leluia" of Mozart. The three selec
tions immediately established Miss
Jepson's seemingly effortless con
trol of a wide singing range, from
warm lower tones to clean, soaring
upper register.
The aria "Ballatella" from "Pa
gliacci," by Leoncavello, made a
charming bridge—calling for an en
core of "Tarentelle" by Rossini—
into Miss Jepson's most popular
group of the evening—four Schu
bert lieder, "Fruhlingstraum," "Die
Post," "Wiegenlied," especially beau
tifully sung, and "Ungeduld."
Her grace and charm made a
happy union with the sunny Schu
bert compositions, while dulcet
pianissimo tones and skillful voice
control gave warmth which made
her performance particularly no
table.
Robert Wallenborn, accompanist,
brought spice to the fourth portion
of the evening with three modern
works of Debussy, Hindemith, and
Poulenc, with an encore of "Minuet"
by Ravel.
The piece de resistance in Miss
Jepson's repertoire—"Ah, fors e
lui," from "La Traviata" by Verdi,
completely satisfied the highest an
ticipations. Her performance of the
demanding work, calling for dra
matic power combined with richly
lyric qualities, left no doubt that
Miss Jepson deserves her high rank
in the musical world. Two encores
were required by the enthusiastic
audience before the intermission.
Second half of the program
brought a group of French works,

and another combination of songs
in English, to bring the concert to
a superb ending. To her audience's
delight, a final encore brought her
popular performance of Gershwin's
| "Summer-time."
While homeward-bound audiences
i were praising Miss Jepson's per-
I formance, additional congratulations
must have been included for Del
; phine Joy, Concert Series manager,
j and her assistants, John Collins and
j Virginia Scott, for bringing concert
I artists of the highest quality for
| their Stanford audiences, making
one of the most successful seasons
the Farm has known in recent years.

delight, a final encore brought her
popular performance of Gershwin's
| "Summer-time."
While homeward-bound audiences
i were praising Miss Jepson's per-
I formance, additional congratulations
must have been included for Del
; phine Joy, Concert Series manager,
j and her assistants, John Collins and
j Virginia Scott, for bringing concert
I artists of the highest quality for
| their Stanford audiences, making
one of the most successful seasons
the Farm has known in recent years.
Stanford's already - successful
1938-39 Concert Scries drew to a
delightful end last night when so
prano Helen Jepson brought an eve
ning of song as charming and grace
ful as herself.
With a voice always fx'esh and
clear, skillfully controlled, Miss
Jepson sang an interestingly varied
program, admirably suited to dis
play the artistic accomplishments
which have already made her well
known on radio and concert stage.
Her program opened with a well
received group of the "Invocation,
from 'Radamisto'," by Handel; "Polly
Willis," Arne; and the beautiful "Al
leluia" of Mozart. The three selec
tions immediately established Miss
Jepson's seemingly effortless con
trol of a wide singing range, from
warm lower tones to clean, soaring
upper register.
The aria "Ballatella" from "Pa
gliacci," by Leoncavello, made a
charming bridge—calling for an en
core of "Tarentelle" by Rossini—
into Miss Jepson's most popular
group of the evening—four Schu
bert lieder, "Fruhlingstraum," "Die
Post," "Wiegenlied," especially beau
tifully sung, and "Ungeduld."
Her grace and charm made a
happy union with the sunny Schu
bert compositions, while dulcet
pianissimo tones and skillful voice
control gave warmth which made
her performance particularly no
table.
Robert Wallenborn, accompanist,
brought spice to the fourth portion
of the evening with three modern
works of Debussy, Hindemith, and
Poulenc, with an encore of "Minuet"
by Ravel.
The piece de resistance in Miss
Jepson's repertoire—"Ah, fors e
lui," from "La Traviata" by Verdi,
completely satisfied the highest an
ticipations. Her performance of the
demanding work, calling for dra
matic power combined with richly
lyric qualities, left no doubt that
Miss Jepson deserves her high rank
in the musical world. Two encores
were required by the enthusiastic
audience before the intermission.
Second half of the program
brought a group of French works,

and another combination of songs
in English, to bring the concert to
a superb ending. To her audience's
delight, a final encore brought her
popular performance of Gershwin's
| "Summer-time."
