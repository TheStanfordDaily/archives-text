# CAMPUS OPINION
## INCONSISTENT?

The Editor, Sir:
I admit that I am slightly on the
dull side when it comes to econom
ics, mathematics, and all related
subjects, so I should like to ask the
person who wrote the editorial about
the Stanford Fund a question.
Why, if Stanford puts up $55 for
every $45 put up by a student, does
the Administration keep enlarging
the student body and reinstating a
lot of people who have flunked out?
It looks to me as though Stanford
gets more from each student than is
spent on each one.
Please answer this question, as I
should like to have a comeback for
my California friends, whose quips
about Stanford's being a school for
morons are troublesome.
