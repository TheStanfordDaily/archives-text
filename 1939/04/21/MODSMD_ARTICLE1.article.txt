### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
YESTERDAY'S Peace Day set
Stanford to thinking. Inevi
tably the question arose, who are
the men who really want war? Are
they the dictators, the profiteers, or
the capitalists who want protection
for their foreign investments? Where
are the eyes that, want to see us in
uniform, shipped to foreign soil to
fight?
Recent developments in Europe
have caused a bulk of the blame to
be laid at the feet of the dictators.
Repeated prophecies have credited
the next war to the aggressive
moves of Hitler and Mussolini. Yet
a little consideration may convince
you that these are men who would
gain very little from an armed con
flict, and would stand to lose a
great deal.

Neither the Fuehrer nor II Duce
is a great military strategist;
neither is capable of leading his
nation in a great war. It is not
improbable that an international
conflict would mean an end for
their one-man governments—a di
vision of authority, a lessening of
influence which could start their
downfall.
Yesterday Mussolini presented
concrete evidence that he is shying
away from wax", at least for the next
three years. Oddly enough he used
his repudiation of President Roose
velt's non-aggression proposal as a
starting point for the proof of his
desire for peace.

I RUBBING F.D.R.'s suggested world
conference "absurd," II Duce in
dicated that both his and Herr Hit
ler's official replies would reject the
proposal. At the same time he jus
tified himself by assuring the world
that Italy was not looking for war.
The fact that Roosevelt had selected
him for one of the two addressees of
his non-aggression note annoyed
him not a little.
Signor Mussolini spoke yester
day on the site of Rome's gigantic
and expensive 1943 world's fair.
Would we be working on this
magnificent project, he asked, if
we were getting ready for war?
Italy offers the world its exposi
tion as a pledge of peace.

IN BERLIN, at the other end of the
axis, Adolf Hitler's birthday party
was no small affair. The Fuehrer
made it the occasion for a colossal
display of military strength, intro
ducing anti-aircraft guns so huge
that they sent shivers up the spine
of every diplomat in attenda ice.
No new-territory arrived with the
Nazi chief's birthday presents, but
the people of Danzig made him an
honorary citizen, which is as good as
saying they would soon return to
the Fatherland.
Adding a typical National So
cialist note of cheer. Hitler issued
orders for the conscription of
500,000 more men to swell his
super-efficient military force.
Someday he may regret it. for the
minute they start fighting is the
minute that the Fuehrer ceases to
be the most important man in the
Reich. lie was only a corporal in
the last war, you know.
