In keeping with the modern the
ory of play presentation, Waldemar
Johansen, director of "The Shoe
maker's Holiday," has decided to
present the play in modern dress
and without props.
The entire pictorial action will be
loft to the audience and the mood
will be set by music and projected
scenery. However, though the play
ers will be in modern dress, their
action will be In tune with the ba

shall go one step farther and leave
