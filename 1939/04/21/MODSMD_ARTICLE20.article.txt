## 
### 
COALINGA, April 20 (UP). —A
fight, of Sun Joaquin valley farmers
to save their vineyards and fields
of cotton and grain from hoards of
grasshoppers settled down tonight
to h race with time.
Appeals for men and materials
were dispatched to W. B. Parker,
state Director of Agriculture at Sac
ramento, for the farmers know that
if the countless millions of the pests
arc not destroyed within a few
weeks time, they will rise in clouds
and spread over the rich valley,
eating every green thing in their
path.
Already more than 1000 acres of
cotton, flax and barley southeast of
here were black with the crawling
insects which leave nothing but
bare ground in their wake. Parker
sent five state entomologists to make
an immediate survey of the grass
hopper infestation. The experts will
report tomorrow on the most effec
tive steps to be taken, and then will
aid the farmers.
