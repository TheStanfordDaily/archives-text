# Militarism Lambasted By Villard
## 1300 Students Hear Editor Advocate Peace, Democracy 
### 
While the nations of Europe
plucked feathers from the dove of
peace, Stanford yesterday enthroned
it in all-day celebration.
Opening Peace Day activities at a
10 o'clock University assembly in
Memorial Hall, Oswald Garrison
Villard, famed editor and lecturer,
presented his answer to the question
"How Shall We Defend America?"
Asserting that the possibility of the
United States' being attacked is
"preposterous," he termed America
the "easiest country in the world to
defend."
"There is no necessity of being
stampeded or terrified by events in
the world today," he told 1300 stu
dents and faculty who gathered to
hear the man who, for 41 years, has
backed nearly every progressive
governmental reform. He was in
troduced by Bob Livingston, Peace
Day chairman.
Warning against creation of a
military class and growth of arma
ment industries that would make it
impossible for the nation to disarm,
Villard argued that war is the
"greatest single threat to democ
racy."
NATIONAL REFORMS
Indicating that defense of America
at home is a more important issue
than foreign defense, he mentioned
the threat of fascists, communists,
and capitalists "who place business
above patriotism." "The people of
dictator-ruled countries have bar
tered their freedom for security. In
five years there will be no difference
at all between the Communism of
Stalin and the Naziism of Hitler,"
he prophesied.
Commending President Roosevelt
for "aiding the cause of labor more
than all other presidents put. to
gether," the well known editor spoke
in frank criticism of some adminis
tration mistakes made since 1932. He
urged several distinct changes in
government machinery, including
extension of civil service, abolish
ment of electoral college, institution
of referendum and initiative, use of
legislative councils and experts to
help frame legislation.
Principal policy he advocated was
a national referendum on war. He
further urged governmental acquisi
tion of coal mines, oil wells, and
formation of a Railway Corporation
similar to the present Maritime
Commission. Extension of social
security legislation to embrace
health insurance and a huge na
tional building program were re
forms that the speaker suggested.
DAY'S PROGRAM
Characterizing democracy as the
"finest philosophy of government,"
the man who described himself as
its "strongest supporter and severest
critic" laid failures in popular rule
to "the men and not the system."
With a theme of Pan-Pacific and
Pan-American relations, an inter
national luncheon was held in Union
courtyard at noon. Chairmanned by
Temple Wanamaker, the luncheon
presented entertainment by Gaie
ties stars and was in charge of Bucky
Henshaw, master of ceremonies.
Round-table discussions, lead by
prominent professors and Farm
student leaders, completed the after
noon's program. Assisting Livingston
as general chairman were Temple
Wanamaker, luncheon; Lovc'l Gun
ter, round tables; John Hewitt, peace
poll; Dwight Hutchinson, publicity.

extension of civil service, abolish
ment of electoral college, institution
of referendum and initiative, use of
legislative councils and experts to
help frame legislation.
Principal policy he advocated was
a national referendum on war. He
further urged governmental acquisi
tion of coal mines, oil wells, and
formation of a Railway Corporation
similar to the present Maritime
Commission. Extension of social
security legislation to embrace
health insurance and a huge na
tional building program were re
forms that the speaker suggested.
DAY'S PROGRAM
Characterizing democracy as the
"finest philosophy of government,"
the man who described himself as
its "strongest supporter and severest
critic" laid failures in popular rule
to "the men and not the system."
With a theme of Pan-Pacific and
Pan-American relations, an inter
national luncheon was held in Union
courtyard at noon. Chairmanned by
Temple Wanamaker, the luncheon
presented entertainment by Gaie
ties stars and was in charge of Bucky
Henshaw, master of ceremonies.
Round-table discussions, lead by
prominent professors and Farm
student leaders, completed the after
noon's program. Assisting Livingston
as general chairman were Temple
Wanamaker, luncheon; Lovc'l Gun
ter, round tables; John Hewitt, peace
poll; Dwight Hutchinson, publicity.
While the nations of Europe
plucked feathers from the dove of
peace, Stanford yesterday enthroned
it in all-day celebration.
Opening Peace Day activities at a
10 o'clock University assembly in
Memorial Hall, Oswald Garrison
Villard, famed editor and lecturer,
presented his answer to the question
"How Shall We Defend America?"
Asserting that the possibility of the
United States' being attacked is
"preposterous," he termed America
the "easiest country in the world to
defend."
"There is no necessity of being
stampeded or terrified by events in
the world today," he told 1300 stu
dents and faculty who gathered to
hear the man who, for 41 years, has
backed nearly every progressive
governmental reform. He was in
troduced by Bob Livingston, Peace
Day chairman.
Warning against creation of a
military class and growth of arma
ment industries that would make it
impossible for the nation to disarm,
Villard argued that war is the
"greatest single threat to democ
racy."
NATIONAL REFORMS
Indicating that defense of America
at home is a more important issue
than foreign defense, he mentioned
the threat of fascists, communists,
and capitalists "who place business
above patriotism." "The people of
dictator-ruled countries have bar
tered their freedom for security. In
five years there will be no difference
at all between the Communism of
Stalin and the Naziism of Hitler,"
he prophesied.
Commending President Roosevelt
for "aiding the cause of labor more
than all other presidents put. to
gether," the well known editor spoke
in frank criticism of some adminis
tration mistakes made since 1932. He
urged several distinct changes in
government machinery, including
extension of civil service, abolish
ment of electoral college, institution
of referendum and initiative, use of
legislative councils and experts to
help frame legislation.
