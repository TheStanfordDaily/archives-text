# Lake to Close Saturday Night
## Groups Given Week To Remove Ganoes 
### 
Saturday night at G o'clock the
first aquatic season of Stanford's new
boathouse will come to a close, ac
cording to Hal Weatherbe, boathouse (
1 crew head.
This decision was reached by a
i committee consisting of H B. Lee, j
Tom Killefer, and A1 Masters, fol- i
i lowing a report by Weatherbe on
, Monday.
Swimming will not be continued
I alter Saturday because of the in- j
j creasingly unsanitary condition of j
the lake. However, the boathouse j
will be open every afternoon from j
1 to 3 o'clock next week, so that j
groups may remove their canoes for i
winter storage. A charge of $1 a !
month is made for storage at the ;
boathouse.
The lake now stands at 29.3 feet i
on the gauge and has receded from j
the boathouse floats. Under these j
I conditions, Weatherbe cited, contin- I
ued use of the canoes would not I
' only be hard on the canoes but dan- j
! gerous to those using them.
