PORTLAND, Ore., April 20 (UP).
â€”The state of Oregon, virtually
rainless since March 15, sweltered
under 80-degree temperatures today
as the worst spring drought since
1885 passed the five-week mark.
Brush and undergrowth fires con
tinued to smolder in many parts of
the state, although authorities re

! ported all blazes under control.
Crop experts said a "very, very se
rious condition" exists in Eastern
Oregon, where the spring wheat,
alfalfa, and hay crops are beginning
to wither.
December is the month of most
i traffic accidents in California.
