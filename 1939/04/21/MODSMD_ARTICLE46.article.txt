# Bear Cubs Doped to Swamp Papooses in Little Big Meet
## 
### 
Even Robert Ripley would be astonished if Stanford's frosh track team
comes through with a victory over the Cal freshmen in the Little Big
Meet to be held tomorrow at ."5:15 o'clock at Angell Field. Such a victory
would not only be a phenomenon of ID.'JO, but would be an event that has
not occurred in five years. Stanford's last win over Cal in a Little Big

Meet was in 1933. *
There were prospects for a highly
successful season this year, but look
at this:
At. the beginning of spring quar
ter, seven of Coach Bill Ellington's
better men failed to return to school
â€”for obvious reasons. This was not
the last of the tough breaks. Pete
Kmetovic, star dash man, is out for
the season. Kmetovic's ankle was
run over by a car.
MORE INJURIES
Then Melvin Ellett picked up a
limp while practicing high jumping,
but he still will participate in the!
javelin throw.
With Cal entering 40 men against
the Farm's mere 23, Ripley need not
worry about being caught, oft guard I
and being astonished. The most
points the local cinder men can
chalk up is 10 to Cal':-; 84, not count
ing the two-mile run.
This means that Frankie Albert
must take firsts in the 120 high and
220 low hurdles. Comparative Cal-
Stanford records in these events list-
Albert with the best time. Robert
Hit! in tho 880 and Ray Durham in
the discus have a better than even
chance to cop firsts.
The remainder of Stanford points
will have to be made by seconds
and thirds.
CAL HAS ADVANTAGE
The Cal team has a great advan- I
tage in th(> sprints with Gilbert Lar- |
son and Bill Kearney; in the 440 j
with Captain Bob Hogan; in the mile I
with Bob Bower; in the pole vault I
with Trd MacConaghy; in the shot |
and javelin with Bob Biles; in the I
high jump with Tom Coull; and in
the broad jump with Hanlon Tharp.
Featured event will be MacCon
aghy's latest, try at breaking the
pole vault record set. by himself a
few weeks ago. His vault was 13
3 1 s for a new state frosh record.
Other Little Big Meet records will
probably remain unshattered. Cal
holds 10 of the 16 records.
