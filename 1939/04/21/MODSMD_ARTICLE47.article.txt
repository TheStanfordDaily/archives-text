SPORTS WRITERS have a very
| funny habit of deciding what is go
! ing to happen before it happens.
I Then, after they are proven to be
' wrong in 999 cases out of a thou
! sand, they never remember to ac
j knowledge their mistakes in the
j public print.
So in order to keep the yapping
dogs of! our collective heels, the
Daily sports department is here
with presenting a whole flock of
1 Jenkins Long-Shot Specials, whose
| success can knock all the pre-Big
j Meet form charts for a royal loop.
If we are right in picking California
I by a one-point margin, we are sor-
J ry; if we were wrong in our calcu
lations, it will be due to some of
the J.L.S. specials coming through
under pressure.

FIRST AND foremost of the 100
to 1 men is Bill Braheny, the Indian
javelin thrower who talked of 210
foot tosses when he was a toddling
freshman unable to reach the 160
mark. That javelin is the first event
at Berkeley. If the announcer were
to yell "Braheny," Stanford, first,
205 feet, 4Va inches" the whole meet
could be a Stanford after that. Don't
j let anyone tell you that a good head
start in the first event doesn't make
a whale of a difference in the ulti
mate outcome. If the underdog In
dians think they can win, and get a
little visible evidence of it right off

the bat, neither hell nor high water
nor the Berkeley Bears will stop the
red rush.
Then Bill Hawkins, acting like a
twin who has lost his brother, must
win the high hurdles without the
aid of Sid Hayes—and Dick Simp
son, if you're still following our long
shots, will have to get seconds in
both barriers. To an old underdog
booster, those six points are not out
of the realm of reasonableness.
Now, hang tight on these. Ray
Brown can cop third in the broad
jump with the proper wind currents
and Russ WulfT, still weak in the
knees, and Jim Lincoln can go one
two in the high jump—all at 3 to i
odds. It's a good bet at those fig
ures.
In the distances, Al Soldate or
Johnny Emanuel will place in tin
two-mile —at 10 to 1, which is a nice
day's wages. Then, we offer you
Hamp Pool, at a scrawny 2 to 1, for
a second in the discus.
But the fella we're pulling for,
more than anyone else, is Paul
Moore. If he places in the 880 or
the mile after the physical struggle
he's had, the meet —win, lose, or draw
—will be worth the long ride over.
And we offer no more than even
money that he won't orne through.
And he could even bring home a
Big Meet victory, if those dead legs
of his should happen to move again
with their old spring.
