# Daily Gives Cal One Point Edge
## Injury Clouds Track Victory Berkeley Meet Outcome to Depend On Second, Third Place Winners 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Did Stanford's chances for a track victory over California in tomorrow's
annual liig Meel disappear in a cloud of cinders at that fateful second'
of hurdles last Wednesday when Sid Ilayes sprawled over the harrier
u th a pulled muscle?
Or will the second- and third-place winners such as Craig Williamson,
I'; ul Moore, Al Soldate. Jim Lincoln, Walt McKenzie, and llamp Fool rise

to new heights to make up for
vital 10.5.s of hurdler Ilayes and pull j
Dink Templet oil's crew through lo |
victory?
The Daily has attempted its bit
of prediction and the results of this |
authoritative and highly probable j
do je sheet give the Bears a one- j
point margin. This only goes to j
.show how finely'balanced the meet |
is, for one shift in a third place I
w< uld reverse the decision.
'Che opening events can be indica- I
live of the trend of the meet, for if I
"Mushy" Girard presses Cecil Cole j
to the limit and still gets his second j
place ahead of Sadaj, and if Clyde ;
Je.'frey and Dick Carew go one- j
two in the century, the Indians will |
be well 011 their way.
Then come the races that can be j
tabbed as unknown quantities. The j
quarter-mile in which Craig Wil
liamson, who is best when the going
is tough, will have his hands full in
trying to grab even a third place
against a blanket of crack Bear
runners.
' Following is that high hurdle
flight in which the fans will be
watching to see whether or not Dick
Simpson will ease into second place 1
behind Bill Hawkins and offset the!
loss of Hayes.
If (there's that word again) I
"Mush" Girard has tired Cole suffi- '
ciently in the mile, he will have a !
fin 3 chance of nipping the slim Cali- j
fornian with his blistering finish in
1 lit; 880. And that third place is a |
tois-up between ever - improving
Paul Moore and Cal's Dick Peter.
The two-mile looks like a wave ol
Blue and Gold with Stanford's Al
Soldate buried, yards back. But j
this loss can be balanced by an en- j
core by Carew and Jeffrey in the !
other sprint event, the furlong. Then j
tha low barriers with Captain Stan 1
Hi.3erman in the driver's seat and ;
Indian rooters praying for another I
come-through by Simpson.
On paper the relay looks all Cali
fornia but will you bet against
Dink's boy, Clyde, if the Bear an
chor man has only a seven-yard i
lead? I wouldn't.
On the field, Card points will i
come rolling in from the weight j
events, but Cal is equally strong in
the jumps and the vaults. Most j
places on the field are foregone con- !
elu: ions, but watch Ray Brown in
the broad jump, Bill Braheny who's
just gotta take the javelin, Jim Lin- \
coin in the high jump, and the er
ratic Hamp Pool in the discus.

come-through by Simpson.
On paper the relay looks all Cali
fornia but will you bet against
Dink's boy, Clyde, if the Bear an
chor man has only a seven-yard i
lead? I wouldn't.
On the field, Card points will i
come rolling in from the weight j
events, but Cal is equally strong in
the jumps and the vaults. Most j
places on the field are foregone con- !
elu: ions, but watch Ray Brown in
the broad jump, Bill Braheny who's
just gotta take the javelin, Jim Lin- \
coin in the high jump, and the er
ratic Hamp Pool in the discus.

Did Stanford's chances for a track victory over California in tomorrow's
annual liig Meel disappear in a cloud of cinders at that fateful second'
of hurdles last Wednesday when Sid Ilayes sprawled over the harrier
u th a pulled muscle?
Or will the second- and third-place winners such as Craig Williamson,
I'; ul Moore, Al Soldate. Jim Lincoln, Walt McKenzie, and llamp Fool rise

to new heights to make up for
vital 10.5.s of hurdler Ilayes and pull j
Dink Templet oil's crew through lo |
victory?
The Daily has attempted its bit
of prediction and the results of this |
authoritative and highly probable j
do je sheet give the Bears a one- j
point margin. This only goes to j
.show how finely'balanced the meet |
is, for one shift in a third place I
w< uld reverse the decision.
'Che opening events can be indica- I
live of the trend of the meet, for if I
"Mushy" Girard presses Cecil Cole j
to the limit and still gets his second j
place ahead of Sadaj, and if Clyde ;
Je.'frey and Dick Carew go one- j
two in the century, the Indians will |
be well 011 their way.
Then come the races that can be j
tabbed as unknown quantities. The j
quarter-mile in which Craig Wil
liamson, who is best when the going
is tough, will have his hands full in
trying to grab even a third place
against a blanket of crack Bear
runners.
' Following is that high hurdle
flight in which the fans will be
watching to see whether or not Dick
Simpson will ease into second place 1
behind Bill Hawkins and offset the!
loss of Hayes.
If (there's that word again) I
"Mush" Girard has tired Cole suffi- '
ciently in the mile, he will have a !
fin 3 chance of nipping the slim Cali- j
fornian with his blistering finish in
1 lit; 880. And that third place is a |
tois-up between ever - improving
Paul Moore and Cal's Dick Peter.
The two-mile looks like a wave ol
Blue and Gold with Stanford's Al
Soldate buried, yards back. But j
this loss can be balanced by an en- j
core by Carew and Jeffrey in the !
other sprint event, the furlong. Then j
