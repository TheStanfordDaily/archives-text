# Diamondmen Rated Even With Cal
## Baseball Teams To Settle Tie Indians Go to Berkeley For Third Game with Bears 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Tied with one game each at this point, the Stanford and Cal baseball
nines will meet tomorrow afternoon in the Berkeley stadium right after
the track meet to deeide the scries—and to fight for third place in the
Coast League.
California won the first game two weeks ago. 5-4, scoring all its runs
in the ninth inning to overcome a four-run deficit. Stanford came hack

to pound three pitchers for 13 hits,
played here.
The Boars'are holding down third
place in tlu C.1.8.A., with the Cards
just behind (hem in fourth place. A
win Saturday will put the Farm team
ahead of the Berkeleymen by a few
percentage points.
THOMPSON TO PITCH
"Cootie" Thompson will again he
the starting pitcher for Stanford,
and will be trying for his second
straight win over the Bears. Thomp
son limited the Cal nine to 10 hits
in the first two games, and would
have won them both if he hadn't
weakened in the linal inning of the
(ir.st encounter.
Audie Daugherty will probably
start again for California. He also
started the first two games, but his
change of pace, on which he seems
to rely, was no mystery to Card
batsmen. Mike Koll may be ready
to pitch, after suffering a shoulder
injury last Saturday. If so, Clint
Evans may decide to start him on
the mound.
Coach Harry Wolter plans to open
the game with the same line-up that
opened the last two games. Bill
Jameson will be behind the plate,
Norm Juney on first, Monty Pfyl
playing second, Dan Boone on third,
and Herb Bull at shortstop.
STEADY DEFENSE
The outfield will be made up of
Bill Adams in center "Smoke" Clark
in left, and Wally deWitt in right.
During the course of the game, Pet
erson may replace deWitt in right
field to improve the defensive play
of the team.
The Bears' starting line-up will
have Lombardi catching, Firpo, first
base, Duezabou, second base, Papp,
third base, and Bob Griffith, short.
The outfield will be patrolled by On
gerth, McNamara, and Winterbot
tom. Hooks Devauers, Bear cap
tain, saw action for the first time in
several weeks Saturday when he
came in to bat for Ongerth in the
seventh inning. He has been on
the bench with a bad leg since early
in the season, but may be able to
play Saturday.

base, Duezabou, second base, Papp,
third base, and Bob Griffith, short.
The outfield will be patrolled by On
gerth, McNamara, and Winterbot
tom. Hooks Devauers, Bear cap
tain, saw action for the first time in
several weeks Saturday when he
came in to bat for Ongerth in the
seventh inning. He has been on
the bench with a bad leg since early
in the season, but may be able to
play Saturday.
Tied with one game each at this point, the Stanford and Cal baseball
nines will meet tomorrow afternoon in the Berkeley stadium right after
the track meet to deeide the scries—and to fight for third place in the
Coast League.
California won the first game two weeks ago. 5-4, scoring all its runs
in the ninth inning to overcome a four-run deficit. Stanford came hack

to pound three pitchers for 13 hits,
played here.
The Boars'are holding down third
place in tlu C.1.8.A., with the Cards
just behind (hem in fourth place. A
win Saturday will put the Farm team
ahead of the Berkeleymen by a few
percentage points.
THOMPSON TO PITCH
"Cootie" Thompson will again he
the starting pitcher for Stanford,
and will be trying for his second
straight win over the Bears. Thomp
son limited the Cal nine to 10 hits
in the first two games, and would
have won them both if he hadn't
weakened in the linal inning of the
(ir.st encounter.
Audie Daugherty will probably
start again for California. He also
started the first two games, but his
change of pace, on which he seems
to rely, was no mystery to Card
batsmen. Mike Koll may be ready
to pitch, after suffering a shoulder
injury last Saturday. If so, Clint
Evans may decide to start him on
the mound.
Coach Harry Wolter plans to open
the game with the same line-up that
opened the last two games. Bill
Jameson will be behind the plate,
Norm Juney on first, Monty Pfyl
playing second, Dan Boone on third,
and Herb Bull at shortstop.
STEADY DEFENSE
The outfield will be made up of
Bill Adams in center "Smoke" Clark
in left, and Wally deWitt in right.
During the course of the game, Pet
erson may replace deWitt in right
field to improve the defensive play
of the team.
The Bears' starting line-up will
have Lombardi catching, Firpo, first
base, Duezabou, second base, Papp,
third base, and Bob Griffith, short.
