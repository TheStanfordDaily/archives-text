# Yearling Nine To Take on Cal
## Card Win Depends On Pitching Control 
### 
At 7:30 o'clock tomorrow morning
22 picked frosh diamondmen will
tumble into a bus and motor to
Berkeley for the last baseball tussle
in a three-game series with the Cal
Cubs.
"And I think we can win this
one," said Coach Harry Shipkey. "I
am certain that we can match them
for hitting power, but we have got
to bunch our hits more if we expect
to get the runs."
Probably of more import will be
the question as to whether or not
the Cardinal pitchers can maintain
what resembles hurling control and
whether they can cut down on their
usual average of walks given.
When the Indians take to the field
tomorrow, George Torassa and Dick
Kendrick will be filling (he short
stop and second base spots, respec
tively, thus completing"what Coach
Shipkey called "a defensive in
field." When the going gets tough,
it will be Barton Sheela and Bob
Herringer, a couple of hefty boys at
the bat who will step into these two
positions.
According to last night's reports,
the following frosh will be in the
starting line-up: DeWitt, catcher;
Meyer, pitcher; Glunberg, first;
Kendrick, second; Torassa, short;
Captain "Good-Game" Mulchay,
third; Vucinich, Sturgeon, and
Boyle, outfield.
