### 
Card horsemen entrained last 1
night on the Lark for Los Angeles
where they will meet the U.S.C. ;
polo squad in the first of a series of
two matches this afternoon. The
second match of the series will be
i contested here on the highway field
next Friday.
The Trojans will give the Cards
plenty of competition this afternoon
down south. In fact the only basis
I of comparison give.s the Los Angeles
bunch the complete edge; the Tro
jans having defeated the powerful
Arizona squad in both their matches,
j while the best the Indians could do
last week was split the series with
the Wildcats.

chance to see a hotly contested inter
squad battle when the A squad
"Blues" and "Whites" clash at 2:30
j o'clock this afternoon on the high
way field.
