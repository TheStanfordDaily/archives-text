# Stars Show Up In Varsity Grid Practice Tilts
## Colin McClintock Holds Down First String Center Spot 
### 
Yesterday's scrimmage between j
two pickup squads of varsity foot
ball players showed more conclu- |
sively than ever that last autumn's j
j'ro.sh gridiron eleven sported plenty i
of tirsl-string stock.
Colin McClintock, a big boy with I
big hands, h;is jumped from frosh j
into the first-string center position j
and at present it appears that he is j
".oing to stick at that pivot spot, i
Coach Tsoutsouvas has been doing i
a little drilling on the side with ]
McClintock with the result that he ;
has improved 100 per cent in i
ball handling.
Another frosh, Bob Crane, worked j
out with the first string last night, i
Crane, a short, heavy boy, appears j
to have the blocking power Thorn- !
hill needs in the quarterback spot. '
Crane, who is a ringer at passing j
and kicking, did little more yester- J
day than push around a few of the j
bigger boys.
Out of the frosh ranks, honors go i
to scrappy Jake Thompson who i
lights a mean battle for the center !
berth on the first string. Jake was :
in on three-fourths of the tackles |
for the red squad until forced from I
scrimmage with a cut lip. i
The remainder of last year's var- I
sity players pounded through their j
paces in familiar style with Pete I
Fay, who i.s shiftier than ever, doing
most of the heavy work. Standlee is :
a little slow to start but maintains j
his old drive. Stojkovich jumped !
the plays more than once but is still ,
as last as last fall. Pat Nowell was i
in there with his face guard break- ;
ing up the running attacks.
