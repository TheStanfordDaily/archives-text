INGLEWOOD, April 20 (UP). —
The thoroughbred colony at Holly
wood Park here continued to grow
today with a check of the stable
population disclosing more than 200
gallopers already on the grounds
awaiting the opening of the 43-day
turf meeting June 1.
Nail-head trimmings in cowboy
style are being used on some of the
smarter handbags.
