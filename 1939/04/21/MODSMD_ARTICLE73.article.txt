# And the Lake's Dry, Too

IT seems that some of the Branner residents
were a bit surprised by the "uncomplimen
tary" article that yesterday's Daily ran on a
water-fight occurring this week within the halls
of that southern outpost.
It seems the "boys" were only having a good
time.
Just incidentally, they managc-d to flood the
halls with two inches of water, soaking the
ceiling of the first floor, necessitating an emer
gency call to the janitorial staff.
The latter, naturally, were exceedingly
pleased to be called out of bed at 11:30 o clock
—to mop up water. They loved it.
But, the water-bag and water-fight have been
old and honorable institutions on the Farm.
Participants have one hell of a swell time. Non
combatants have a hell of a time, however.
Invitation as it is to a deluge, The Daily, on
this day following Peace Day, recommends
that both of these institutions go the way of
other Stanford traditions which are long since
dead and buried in the honorable past —or keep
them out-of-doors.
If Branner Hall must have spontaneous enter
tainment, let it organize itself into some manner
of social and political unit, conduct activities
which might be termed more constructive and
not quite so damn annoying to everybody
concerned.
Nobody objects to self-entertainment, but
when a small group manages to go to the
extent of damaging property and disturbing
the rest of the hall and Toyon, too, it's carrying
things to the well-known too far.
One aspect of Monday night's pre-election
celebration is valuable—that is, that student
processes are to be responsible for ultimate
determination of the whole affair.
As one observer remarked, "The mob looked
physically more like a group of Hitler-mad
German youths than anything else."
Which is a nice compliment to Stanford and
Stanford's methods of extra-curricular amuse
ment.
