# Peace Day at Stanford
## 
### 
CHALK up another stimulating, successful
Peace Day for Stanford. Students turned
out for the assembly, it didn't rain on the peace
luncheon in the Union Court, and a set of top
notch discussion leaders really started people
talking at the four round tables.
Even the R.O.T.C. co-operated — profiting
from the experience of a lugubrious coinci
dence last year, the local war department sched
uled its annual review for a date other than
Peace Day.
It was good for Stanford to take a day off to
talk things over, to do some concerted won
dering about problems of neutrality, armaments,
haves and have-nots, and the general situation
in this world that seems to have its head so
far into the noose just now.
Most of all it was good for Stanford to hear
a man of the caliber of Oswald Garrison Villard
give assurance that territorial United States is
in no danger of attack from any foreign power.
A sane view of the situation like that should do
much to offset the hysterical, undocumented
predictions of war by September uttered from
the same platform a week ago.
To hear Stanford applaud Mr. Villard, it
sounded as if Peace Day was functioning as a
healthy intellectual stimulus. It sounded as if
the cause of peace was getting a lift without a
let-down.—R. D.
