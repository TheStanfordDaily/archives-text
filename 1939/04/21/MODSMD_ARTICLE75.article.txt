# Preference, Please

A.S.S.U. PRESIDENT. Vote for four.
Under Stanford's preferential system
the voter picks his fir.>t choice (in ink) and then
proceeds to fill in the ballot with haphazard
guesses or the names he figures offer the
smallest threat to his number-one man.
Political scientists tell us that the preferential
ballot is the fairest index of the public will yet
devised. However, they base their praise on
the assumption that the entire body politic
votes and is qualified to pass judgment on all
the candidates running. In reality, the student

electorate is no more Utopian in this aspect than
are the voters of the nation.
Most second and third place votes are cast
at random, and many spaces are left blank.
In this week's A.S.S.U. election eight offices,
including student body president, were won
on second and third choice counts. Obviously
the political scientists' dream is not being com
pletely realized. Democracy was ever thus.
The question is whether the preferential bal
lot is the most practical and representative
possible for Stanford.
Granted, that it has been fairly successful
thus far, and could be more so with complete
student co-operation in voting.
The possibility of using the primary system
inevitably arises. Many believe that it would
cut down substantially the power of the cau
cuses and improve the quality of the candi
dates. Anyone could run in the primaries
without party backing, and the two top men
would appear on the run-off ballot, irrespective
of v/hether they were Hall-Row, Hall-Hall, or
Row-Row. Political machines would be forced
into a back seat in the selection of candidates.
Primaries have their disadvantages. No one
can claim that they will eliminate caucuses and
back-room deals. They would make A.S.S.U.
elections more expensive.
But the fact that the primary system might
help to kill the Boss Tweed aspect of Stanford
politics makes it almost worth a trial.
