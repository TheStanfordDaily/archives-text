### JOHN COBBS 
FLOOD CONTROL
\Y/HEN a mob of Branner boys went berserk last
Monday night and flooded the Hall with fire
hoses, most of Stanford waited anxiously for the Ad
ministration to tall out the guard. Drumhead court
martials, we thought, were inevitable; the best the of
fenders could hope was that their families would be
allowed to have their bodies. But the following day,
Dean of Men John Bunn announced, "This is strictly
a student problem. We have student government, and
therefore we have student responsibility. The matter
will be dealt with by Men's Council."
If Dean Bunn was looking for an incantation that
would settle the trouble and at the same time bring
him the respect and trust of the students he could
have not gotten a better formula from a fairy god
mother. The same three sentences that started the
prosecution of the troublemakers assured the students
that the Administration was going to stand by its side
of the student government bargain.
❖ $ * *
r r , IiEKE is always a tremendous temptation for Uni
versity authorities to interfere when students get
out of bounds. And when University property is in
volved, the temptation approaches compulsion. If we
remember the way sponsors used to agonize over a
broken window in Encina, we can get some insight
into what a whole ceiling full of plaster in Branner
meant to Dean Bunn. His decision must have been
preceded by a "black night of the soul" that compares
with the mental struggles of the saints.
But in announcing that the problem would be han
dled by student authorities, John Bunn made the Ad
ministration's biggest contribution of the year to stu
dent government and to friendly relations between un
dergraduates and University officers.
♦ * * >l<
It docs not please the students to sec campus gov
ernment shouldered aside when ofliicals want some
one's head on a pike. It makes us feel that our govern
ment. is merely a pretty toy which serves to keep us
quiet, but is not intended for important matters.
And it annoys us to observe the reverence with
which the University regards its property. We get the
impression that we are rather insignificant in com
parison with chipped paint.
It makes no difference that the officials reach the
same judgments that student government would have
reached. It is the methods .that offend us, not the
results.
••U H': $
And so we are grateful to Dean Bunn for leaving
this problem to Men's Council. It shows that he con
siders student government as something more than a
muzzle for objectors. It indicates that lie does not want
to play Stanford fuehrer.
It is always pleasant to be trusted.

It docs not please the students to sec campus gov

one's head on a pike. It makes us feel that our govern

quiet, but is not intended for important matters.
And it annoys us to observe the reverence with
which the University regards its property. We get the
impression that we are rather insignificant in com
parison with chipped paint.
It makes no difference that the officials reach the

And so we are grateful to Dean Bunn for leaving
this problem to Men's Council. It shows that he con
siders student government as something more than a
muzzle for objectors. It indicates that lie does not want
to play Stanford fuehrer.
It is always pleasant to be trusted.
FLOOD CONTROL
\Y/HEN a mob of Branner boys went berserk last
Monday night and flooded the Hall with fire
hoses, most of Stanford waited anxiously for the Ad
ministration to tall out the guard. Drumhead court
martials, we thought, were inevitable; the best the of
fenders could hope was that their families would be
allowed to have their bodies. But the following day,
Dean of Men John Bunn announced, "This is strictly
a student problem. We have student government, and
therefore we have student responsibility. The matter
will be dealt with by Men's Council."
If Dean Bunn was looking for an incantation that
would settle the trouble and at the same time bring
him the respect and trust of the students he could
have not gotten a better formula from a fairy god
mother. The same three sentences that started the
prosecution of the troublemakers assured the students
that the Administration was going to stand by its side
of the student government bargain.

out of bounds. And when University property is in
volved, the temptation approaches compulsion. If we
remember the way sponsors used to agonize over a
broken window in Encina, we can get some insight
into what a whole ceiling full of plaster in Branner
meant to Dean Bunn. His decision must have been
preceded by a "black night of the soul" that compares
with the mental struggles of the saints.
