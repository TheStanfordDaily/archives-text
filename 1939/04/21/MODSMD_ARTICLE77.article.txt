These things I know.
When a strange blonde comes to the campus, there
is something to write about.
When a concert, artist comes to the campus, there
is something to write about.
When I lie concert art ist is ;i blonde, and the blonde
is a concert artist . . .
Helen Jepson walked onto the stage of Memorial
Hall Wednesday night wearing a flowing, blue
formal .
"Shr> looks like a ship under full sail," someone
commented.
"Yeah." a friend agreed.
The boys in back went, "Whoo-oo."
The applause died down, the concert started. The
blonde charmed her audience with her voice, her per
sonality: and with her blue formal.
The first brief pause in the concert. The graceful
blonde leaves the stage in long, easy strides. She is
almost off when her foot hits a slick spot. She slips,
catches her balance, and keeps walking.
"Didja soe that'.'" the guy next to me said. "Didja
see that'.' She slipped. That's what I like. The little
things."
The blonde came back. The guy next to me squirm
ed. "Culture. Ye-'h." At the end of the next number
he said, ' There are 2.'Jl lights in the ceiling."
But the blonde continued to sing.
And the boys in back went, "Whoo-oo."

AT RANDOM

I hear on good authority that Lagunita is infested
with frogs. Hie lake dried up ,so the frogs moved into
the hall, to be followed shortly by the Junior Water
Carnival.

He smiled at me in a drunken, forgiving way. "You

know I write."
