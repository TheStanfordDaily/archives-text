# Fund Drive 50 Behind Record Mark
## Ryus Makes Last Plea to Class of '39 For Contributions 
### 
The Stanford Fund and Alumni
Drive campaigns end today with only
.'5B more fund contributors needed to
break the record set by the Class
of '38.
Tabulations last night revealed
that 1350 seniors had contributed to
the fund, with off-campus seniors
unreported. "If we get only 50 more
contributors, we'll hit the goal of
400 and break the standing lecords."
Jack Laney, campaign chairman,
stated.
Explaining the purpose and .signifi
cance of the campaign, Dave Ryus,
senior class president, released the
following statement last night:
RYUS' STATEMENT
"This year we have attempted to
explain as fuily as possible to the
members of the senior class that the
Stanford Fund-Alumni Drive is not
just another contrivance to eke out
one more dollar or two for some
vague ephemeral cause which means
nothing to us now and will never
give us our money's worth.
"On the contrary, such contribu
tions, no matter what their size may
be, signify two things. First, that
we are grateful for the training,
education, and broadening which
Stanford has given us, and we feel
that we want to do our part to help
the University maintain its present
high standing and reputation.
INTEREST IN STANFORD
"Second, to give evidence to the
University that there exists in the
Class of '39 a universal interest in
the welfare of our school and desire
to continue that interest by giving
something tangible that the Univer
sity can use for research or schol
arships.
"The value received from becom
ing a member of the Alumni Asso
ciation can be clearly seen. We will
receive the Illustrated Review at
one-half the regular price, the first
issue of which will contain a per
petual remembrance of our Senior
Week activities and a set of 1G
beautiful color prints of our campus.
"We will become a member of the
Stanford Club in whatever locality
we might choose to live. Finally, wo
become one of the 33,000 Stanford
Alumni Association members with
a permanent record filed in the
alumni office with fuil opportunity
to participate in the yearly confer
ences and thus to keep up an active
interest in Stanford.
