### LARRY LIVINCSTON 
i)° YOU remember when you
were a kid and used to play
sandlot baseball? The gang that
lived on the block would crowd
around while the two biggest fel
lows chose sides. The best players
consistently were chosen first, and
when both teams were complete, the
game started.
Something very similar to this is
taking place in Europe at the pres
ent time. Choosing sides are Eng
land and Germany, preparing for a
game a little more serious than
baseball. One by one the other na
tions are being selected in order of
their strength and accessibility. It
won't be long before all the posi
tions arc filled — and then the fun
begins.
a»c sk
r latest Italian coup comes as
a major blow to Britain because
it leaves a vital gap in the projected
stop-Hitler ring. At the same time
it holds promise of causing the col
lapse of the Balkan entente (Ru
mania, Greece, Jugoslavia, and Tur
key) which England has been
counting on for support when the
game gets under way.
Hitler and Mussolini also have
their eyes on Bulgaria as a pros
pective team-mate, and this week
will probably see them with an
other Balkan power under con
tract. When the great powers of
western Europe start lining up
the lesser nations of the south
east, only one conclusion is po«-
sible. There's hound to be a war.
* * *
Although the European powers are
busy attracting allies and arming
themselves almost beyond recogni
tion, still their leaders are trying to
stave off an immediate conflict.
Whether they are not quite ready
to begin or they refuse to recognize
the inevitable, is beside the point.
Prime ministers and dictators are
postponing the war.
With a pacifist flourish Cham
berlain sent his German ambassa
dor, Sir Neville Henderson, back to
Berlin yesterday. Since Hitler's
savage persecution of the Jews last
fall Britain's chief diplomatic rep
resentative has been in London
"conferring with his government on
the European situation."

IT IS not difficult to see why
England selected this week to
send Sir Neville hack to his post.
Friday, when the Reichstag con
venes, Herr Hitler will address
his answer to President Roose
velt's peace proposal. Mr. Cham
berlain feels, with good reason,
that a friendly gesture on the part
of the democratic bloc may in
duce the Fuehrer to temper his
reply.
In an effort to ease possible fric
t ion between Germany and the
United States, the British ambas
sador has been returned to Berlin.
Another move to preserve temporary
peace.

In order to convince Roosevelt,
that he was all wrong when he ad
dressed the Reich as a potential ag
gressor against 31 nations, Hitler
has sent questional res to most of
the nations on the list asking them
if they consider Germany a menace.
In routine diplomatic responses 12
countries have disavowed any such
fear. Rumania sensibly asked how
anyone can feel secure at the pres
ent time. And England, France, and
Poland were not asked.

r latest Italian coup comes as
a major blow to Britain because
it leaves a vital gap in the projected
stop-Hitler ring. At the same time

counting on for support when the

Hitler and Mussolini also have
their eyes on Bulgaria as a pros
pective team-mate, and this week
will probably see them with an

Although the European powers are
busy attracting allies and arming

stave off an immediate conflict.

Prime ministers and dictators are

berlain sent his German ambassa

Berlin yesterday. Since Hitler's

IT IS not difficult to see why
England selected this week to
send Sir Neville hack to his post.
Friday, when the Reichstag con
venes, Herr Hitler will address
his answer to President Roose
velt's peace proposal. Mr. Cham
berlain feels, with good reason,
that a friendly gesture on the part
of the democratic bloc may in
duce the Fuehrer to temper his
reply.
In an effort to ease possible fric

United States, the British ambas
sador has been returned to Berlin.
Another move to preserve temporary

In order to convince Roosevelt,
that he was all wrong when he ad
dressed the Reich as a potential ag
gressor against 31 nations, Hitler
has sent questional res to most of
the nations on the list asking them
if they consider Germany a menace.
In routine diplomatic responses 12
countries have disavowed any such
fear. Rumania sensibly asked how
anyone can feel secure at the pres
ent time. And England, France, and
Poland were not asked.
i)° YOU remember when you
were a kid and used to play
sandlot baseball? The gang that
lived on the block would crowd
around while the two biggest fel
lows chose sides. The best players
consistently were chosen first, and
when both teams were complete, the
game started.
Something very similar to this is
taking place in Europe at the pres
ent time. Choosing sides are Eng
land and Germany, preparing for a
game a little more serious than
baseball. One by one the other na
tions are being selected in order of
their strength and accessibility. It
won't be long before all the posi
tions arc filled — and then the fun
begins.
