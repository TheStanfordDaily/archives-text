STARTED IN '95
Miss von Falkenstein hails from
the same general locality and she
was frequently pitted against Mel
linkoff in forensic tilts. Thomas
O'Leary was somewhat of a dark
horse in the competition, but he was
a unanimous choice of the three
judges, James Gordon Emerson,
Miss Louise Linton, and Marshall
Dill. He was chosen because of his
familiarity with the general topic,
"France and World Peace," through
his background of travel in France
and Europe.
Established in 1895 by Baron
Pierre de Courbet as a memorial to
Camot, martyred president of
France, the award was later changed
to commemorate Marshal Joffre, the
great French war-time general.

sponsorship of the Alliance Francais

of the Alliance Francaise will give a
short preliminary history of the de
bate. Dr. Albert Guerard will act as
chairman of the evening.
