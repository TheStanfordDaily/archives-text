# Spring Show Readings close Try outs Today
## Forty-two Parts Open to Students; New Talent Wanted 
### 
With over 40 men and women
seeking singing parts last week in
Ram's Head's Spring Show, "Wake
Up and Leave," tryouts for the 42
speaking parts in the show will be
gin today, lasting through Wednes
day.
A large cast includes five good
roles for women, about twice as
many for men, with others needed
in supporting roles, according to di
rector J. P. Cahn. Tryouts will last
from 1 to 4 o'clock today, tomor
row, and Wednesday.
NEED NEW TALENT
Cahn, also in charge of tryouts,
emphasized the fact that Ram's
Head was searching for new talent
to take part in the Spring Show. He
pointed out that "Ram's Head is not
a closed corporation,'" that parts in
the Spring Show were one of the
chief means of entrance into the
dramatic society.
"Wake Up and Leave" was written,
he said, on the basic belief that the
Spring Show should be a farce.
And, lie prophesied, "this will be a
farce to out-farce them all."
MUSICAL SCORES
The story concerns the difficulties
of a son trying to break into his
father's business by organizing a
competing firm.
The musical side of the farce will
be supplied by the 11 songs included,
written by Carl Diesenroth, Sherm
Mellinkoff, and Hank Rhodes. In
charge of musical arrangements is
Myron Birnbaum.
