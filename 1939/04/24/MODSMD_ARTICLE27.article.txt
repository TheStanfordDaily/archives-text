# Campus Shums Spectacular Color Concert
## Small Audience Approves Annual Glee Club Program 
### 
Stanford obviously sat pat on its
, sophisticated dime last Saturday
| night when the Glee Clubs pre
i sented their "Concert in Color." This
' time membership in the social chain
- gang cost them a ringside seat to a
' unique development in aesthetic
| appreciation.
I Before an audience barely clear
j ing the hundred mark, 33 capable
singers presented a concert lifted
j far above any hint of mediocrity by
I a series of lighting effects reflecting
; the mood created by each selection.
AUDIENCE APPROVES
As with any novel experiment, !
I public reaction was not immediately
favorable, for it took about three |
selections before the audience es- j
| tablishod correlation between the in- j
I dividually brilliant lighting effects j
j and the words of each song. Once j
I established, however, this associa-
I tion added two-fold to the apprecia- '
tion of each vocal interpietation.
Among a combined popular, semi
j classical, and religious program, the j
j selection "When Day Is Lone" was !
! perhaps the outstanding and most j
j easily interpreted. The vocalists I
j were silhouetted against a screen j
j the upper half of which reflected a
| Crater Lake blue, the lower half a
! brilliantly creamy hue.
SONG MOOI)
As the song progressed, express- j
| ing the sentiment that loneliness ad
vanced with the dusk, the back- '
J ground was gradually diffused in!
| gray tones until the end of the song, j
i when the stage went completely |
black. The increased understanding j
of the song's message experienced by
the favored few in Saturday night's
audience cannot be adequately con
veyed to outsiders.
Based on a psychological study of
mood created by vocal narration and
the colors thus suggested, Satur
day night's performance revealed so
I many possibilities that one unfortu
nately cannot say that it exemplified
: perfection, must say only that J. P.

Stanford obviously sat pat on its
, sophisticated dime last Saturday
| night when the Glee Clubs pre
i sented their "Concert in Color." This
' time membership in the social chain
- gang cost them a ringside seat to a
' unique development in aesthetic
| appreciation.
I Before an audience barely clear
j ing the hundred mark, 33 capable
singers presented a concert lifted
j far above any hint of mediocrity by
I a series of lighting effects reflecting
; the mood created by each selection.
AUDIENCE APPROVES
As with any novel experiment, !
I public reaction was not immediately
favorable, for it took about three |
selections before the audience es- j
| tablishod correlation between the in- j
I dividually brilliant lighting effects j
j and the words of each song. Once j
I established, however, this associa-
I tion added two-fold to the apprecia- '
tion of each vocal interpietation.
Among a combined popular, semi
j classical, and religious program, the j
j selection "When Day Is Lone" was !
! perhaps the outstanding and most j
j easily interpreted. The vocalists I
j were silhouetted against a screen j
j the upper half of which reflected a
| Crater Lake blue, the lower half a
! brilliantly creamy hue.
SONG MOOI)
As the song progressed, express- j
| ing the sentiment that loneliness ad
vanced with the dusk, the back- '
J ground was gradually diffused in!
| gray tones until the end of the song, j
i when the stage went completely |
black. The increased understanding j
of the song's message experienced by
the favored few in Saturday night's
audience cannot be adequately con
veyed to outsiders.
Based on a psychological study of
mood created by vocal narration and
the colors thus suggested, Satur
day night's performance revealed so
I many possibilities that one unfortu
nately cannot say that it exemplified
: perfection, must say only that J. P.
' Cahn's lighting effects and the glee
clubs, directed by George H. Knoles,
! have taken a successful step into a
j new field of artistic experiment.—
