# Professor Townley Tells Of Pacific Coast Quakes
## 
### BUD AMES 
"Earthquakes? Well, there have been anywhere from ten to twelve
thousand of them on the west coast since 17(>!). That's what my new book,
'Descriptive Catalog of Earthquakes of the Pacific Coast of the United
States, to 1928.' is about."
It was Professor S. D. Townley speaking. He ran his hand through his
rather long, white hair, and smiled a smile that expressed both welcome

and pity at the same time; then he*
continued.
"But please understand that there
is no mention of instrument-re
corded earthquakes unless actually
they have been bodily felt by per
sons in the states of California,
Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Arizona !
or Utah.
ALLEN COLLABORATOR
"But don't forget Maxwell Allen. j
He was my collaborator on theÂ»cata- j
log. We gathered information from ;
newspapers, from other catalogs, |
and by oral reports given by differ- ]
ent people. The whole job took 10 (
years; the majority of the work was j
done after my retirement from the I
Stanford astronomy staff seven years j
ago. No, I don't contemplate any j
more publications of this type. Let's ;
hope there will not be a need for
another such catalog. Earthquakes
are not pleasant things, you know."
Professor Townley stopped for a
breath and shifted even lower into
his chair. He glanced through sev- i
eral yellow sheets of paper on which !
was written the introduction for the
speech he will give before the Stan
ford Research Club May 10, then !
.spoke.
AN EARTHQUAKE IS
"Now let's see, you want to know ,
what an earthquake is? Well," as
he rubbed the palms of his hands i
together to indicate movement, "an
earthquake is merely a process of !
adjustment on the surface and in the !
interior of the earth. You find these !
adjustments more frequently in re
gions where mountains are directly ;
adjacent to a sea, especially a deep 1
sea. That earthquake they had in j
Chile a few month.'# ago is a good I
example of the principle.
"Volcanoes? No, earthquakes are i
not usually a cause of mountain
eruptions. The nnly mountain in
California that you might consider
active is Lassen Peak. That peak
erupted back in 1915, and there were
several resulting small earthquakes.
AID TO BUILDERS
"Now, as for the purpose of the
catalog, that is a little difficult to
say. It will prove an aid no doubt
to builders on the west coast in
helping them to erect houses, and
especially that can
withstand earthquake strains.
"I guess that is about all there is,"
he said. "Here, take these sheets of
paper. They contain a lot of infor
mation about the catalog in general.
Thanks for dropping in."
He led the way back to the door
again, still smiling. There was just
as much welcome in that smile but
his look of pity, overwhelming pity
seemed to have increased.
