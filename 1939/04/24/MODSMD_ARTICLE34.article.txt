## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Bears Edge Out Indian Baseballers, 2-1: Track Team Outscored, 74-56 9th Inning Uprising Heals Farm Nine; Cal Wins Series, 2-1 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
The old idea that "someone on the
Farm isn't living right," a carryover
from last fall's football season, pop
pod up again in Berkeley Saturday
when a ninth inning uprising gave
the California Bears a 2-1 victory
over the Card base bailers.
"Cootie" Thompson, who took
over the pitching duties in the sev
enth inning after A1 Lazzarone
had been lifted for a pinch hitter,
was the victim of a California rally
that was virtually a repetition of the !
first Cal game two weeks ago. With
two men out and the score tied at
one-all in the last inning, Daugherty
made an infield single and went to
second on Ongerth's base hit to left j
field. Bob McNamara, Bear right 1
fielder who drove in the winning run j
against Thompson in the first i
game, smashed a line drive single;
to right-center field that scored
Daugherty wi ththe tally that won
the ball game.
CAL IN THIRD
Audie Daugherty, playing his last !
game for the Blue and Gold, pitched j
a victory that gave the Bears the '
deciding win in the season's series j
between the two teams and planted ;
them firmly in third place in the
C.1.8A. standings.
The California chukker limited the
Indians to eight safeties, all singles,
in a startling reversal of form over
his two previous appearances,
against the same team.
BEARS START IT
The Bears opened the scoring
with a run in the fourth inning. (
McNamara led off with a base hit
to center. "Hooks" Devaurs sent
him to second with a single past I
shortstop Herb Bull. After Dueza
bou had fouled out to catcher Jame
son, Firpo blasted a hit past Pfyl
that scored McNamara and sent
Duezabou to third base. Lombardi
walked, loading the bases. Boone,
Card third sacker, made one of the J
best fielding plays of the day on
Griffith's grounder. After fielding it,'
he touched third to force Firpo and 1
then threw to Norm Juney at first 1
for a double play that ended the
inning.
Stanford's lone marker was scor
ed in the first half of the seventh
inning. Herb Bull opened the frame
with a line drive that caromed off \
Daughertys' mitt for an infield hit.,
He went to second on Jameson's
bunt. Juney's infield hit sent him j
1o third, and he crossed the plate (
when Sid Lewis, pinch hitting for
Lazzarone drove a long high fly to '
center field.
SIX DOUBLE PLAYS
Both teams played fine defensive
baseball, Bull's fifth-inning boot .
being the only error charged against j
either team. Six double killings,'
three by each club, got the pitchers |
out ol trouble several times.
By far the outstanding play of I
the season was a double killing in
the Cal half of the sixth. With |
Duezabou on first base and none
out, Firpo drove a line drive to left
field for a single. Boone took the
throw in to first base, but Duezabou
was safe. Boone threw to Juney,
and Firpo was caught in a hot box
between first and second and tagged
out by Pfyl, who then threw to Bill
Jameson to nip Duezabou at the
plate.
