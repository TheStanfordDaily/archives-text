# Jeffrey Ties, Breaks 100, 220-yard Dash Marks in 9.6, 20.8
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Stanford lost its 46th annual track
meet with California, 74 ,/ 2-56 I ,a, not
necessarily because ot the flood of
injuries and sickness that assailed
the Cardinal squad in the past few
weeks but mainly because the Bears
were a darn good bunch of track
men.
Cole proved that he was every
thing advance notices said him to
be, running a sharp 4:15.9 mile,
with "Mushy" Girard pressing at
his shoulder all the way. These
two, however, killed each other off,
for the California finished a poor
last in the half-mile later on, and
Girard dropped out of the two mile.
HAWKINS WINS
Long of California was giving
Bill Hawkins a tough battle in the
high hurdles until he hit the ninth
barrier to bring not only himself but
Stanford's Dick Simpson crashing to
the cinders. This double spill hurt
the Cards more than the Bears, for
Pooley and Venning swept on to
take those place and show points.
But the margin of victory was not
as great as the score denotes, and
there were times when the meet had
a definite reddish hue. For instance,
when Bill Braheny really caught
hold of one in the javelin, hurling
10 feet farther than his previous best
effort. Braheny took his event at
211 feet 8 inches and his team-mate,
Karl Thursby, sneaked in for a
third.
BROWN (JETS SECOND
Ray Brown was highly successful
in breaking up the Blue and Gold
monopoly in the broad jump. Ray
bettered his record this year by
three inches to grab third place be
hind Cal's Captain Manuuel, who
was only IV2 inches ahead. How
ever, the real come-through race of
the day was Paul Huston's blister
ing flight of low hui'dles. Placing
for the first time this year, Paul ran
a beautiful race to take a mighty
strong third.
Clyde Jeffrey showed IHe Berke
ley fans the breath-taking speed
Stanford track followers knew he
possessed. Finishing like the wind in
both dashes, Clyde tied Bob Kiesell's
meet record of 9.6 in the 100 and
then broke the former's record of
21.1 in the furlong by three-tenths
of a second.
SHOT PUT TWINS
Bill Wohle and Stan Andersen
also did what was expected of them,
taking first and second in the shot
with ease. Wohle exceeded the 52-
foot mark by h: > inch and "Big
Andy" followed at 51 feet, 4 inches.
Pete Zagar also entered into the
record breaking spirit of the day,
sending to the boards Phil (Levy)
Fox's record of 163 feet in the dis
cus with a mighty toss of 164 feet
5 1 2 inches.
INDIAN HERO
In the high jump, Russ Wuiff and
Jim Lincoln couldn't accustom them
selves to the Cal take-off and had
to be satisfied with their share of a
four-way tie for first at a measly
6 feet l a 4 inches. Captain Stan
Hiserman ran his usual skimming
flight of low barriers to coast to
victory in 23.7.
Credit should go to Craig Wil
liamson and Paul Moore, both ail
ing Cardinals, who fought off the
Bear horde to grab third places in
the 440 and 880, respectively, and to
Les Johnson and "Rocky" Rockwell,

who ran mighty fast laps in the re
lay to help bring the Indians to
within a yard of the highly touted
Bear relay team.

Jim Lincoln couldn't accustom them
selves to the Cal take-off and had
to be satisfied with their share of a
four-way tie for first at a measly
6 feet l a 4 inches. Captain Stan
Hiserman ran his usual skimming
flight of low barriers to coast to
victory in 23.7.
Credit should go to Craig Wil
liamson and Paul Moore, both ail
ing Cardinals, who fought off the
Bear horde to grab third places in
the 440 and 880, respectively, and to
Les Johnson and "Rocky" Rockwell,

who ran mighty fast laps in the re
lay to help bring the Indians to
within a yard of the highly touted
Bear relay team.
Stanford lost its 46th annual track
meet with California, 74 ,/ 2-56 I ,a, not
necessarily because ot the flood of
injuries and sickness that assailed
the Cardinal squad in the past few
weeks but mainly because the Bears
were a darn good bunch of track
men.
Cole proved that he was every
thing advance notices said him to
be, running a sharp 4:15.9 mile,
with "Mushy" Girard pressing at
his shoulder all the way. These
two, however, killed each other off,
for the California finished a poor
last in the half-mile later on, and
Girard dropped out of the two mile.
HAWKINS WINS
Long of California was giving
Bill Hawkins a tough battle in the
high hurdles until he hit the ninth
barrier to bring not only himself but
Stanford's Dick Simpson crashing to
the cinders. This double spill hurt
the Cards more than the Bears, for
Pooley and Venning swept on to
take those place and show points.
But the margin of victory was not
as great as the score denotes, and
there were times when the meet had
a definite reddish hue. For instance,
when Bill Braheny really caught
hold of one in the javelin, hurling
10 feet farther than his previous best
effort. Braheny took his event at
211 feet 8 inches and his team-mate,
Karl Thursby, sneaked in for a
third.
BROWN (JETS SECOND
Ray Brown was highly successful
in breaking up the Blue and Gold
monopoly in the broad jump. Ray
bettered his record this year by
three inches to grab third place be
hind Cal's Captain Manuuel, who
was only IV2 inches ahead. How
ever, the real come-through race of
the day was Paul Huston's blister
ing flight of low hui'dles. Placing
for the first time this year, Paul ran
a beautiful race to take a mighty
strong third.
Clyde Jeffrey showed IHe Berke
ley fans the breath-taking speed
Stanford track followers knew he
possessed. Finishing like the wind in
both dashes, Clyde tied Bob Kiesell's
meet record of 9.6 in the 100 and
then broke the former's record of
21.1 in the furlong by three-tenths
of a second.
SHOT PUT TWINS
Bill Wohle and Stan Andersen
also did what was expected of them,
taking first and second in the shot
with ease. Wohle exceeded the 52-
foot mark by h: > inch and "Big
Andy" followed at 51 feet, 4 inches.
Pete Zagar also entered into the
record breaking spirit of the day,
sending to the boards Phil (Levy)
Fox's record of 163 feet in the dis
cus with a mighty toss of 164 feet
5 1 2 inches.
