# Hammer-Coffin On Exhibition
## Society Celebrates 33rd Anniversary 
### 
Two silver girdled handles and a
33-year-old hammer are among the
outstanding features in this week's
library exhibit which is being put
on by Hammer and Coffin Society
and which shows interesting items
in the history of the Chaparral.
Each year the members of Ham
mer and Coffin that have worked on
Chaparral for that year have their
names engraved upon a silver ring.
A series of these rings soldered to
gether forms the handle to the 12-
pound sledge hammer. This year
the third handle is being .started.
A red satin ceremonial cap which
the editor of Chappie wears is also
on display. Various outstanding is
sues of the magazine are shown. "Le
Chaparrall" is the World War issue,
put out completely by members of
Hammer & CofTiin who were serv
ing overseas. All of the material
contained in this issue was sent over
by the men in the trench.es.
The first "Now That.--" editorial
of Chappie is shown. This editorial
explains why the name "Chaparral"
was chosen for the magazine.
"If you don't want the staff to be
caught in the Chaparral, take the
Chappie," it said. Another case
shows the different stages in put
ting out the magazine.
