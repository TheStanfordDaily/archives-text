j first places, except the highs, which
Frank Alberts won in 15.9. A yard
back was Hopkins, also of Stanford.
High spot of the meet was Bill
, Garde's fight for third place in the
j 220. Corning from behind he lost by
| inches; the winning time was :21.8,
1 a new meet record. Besides Alberts
and Hopkins, Judy, Hitt, Swickard,
Rasmussen, Durham, Stark, and
1 Stapleton were the only Stanford
! tracksters to garner points.
