## 
### 
In spite of their vows to come
home with a win, Harry Shipkey's
frosh diumondmen wont to Cal last
Saturday, and took their third
straight licking in a three-game se
ries, 13-10, to end the season,
Freddy Meyer, the starting pitch
er, hurled what would have been
good baseball if it had not been for
the errors of his team-mates in the
first inning. During the first trip to
the bat, the Cal squad pounded out
seven runs, a lead which the Cardi
nals fought to overcome through the

, remaining eight innings.
Strangely enough, the Cal boys
bingoed thirteen hits and tallied
thirteen runs, while the Cards tal-
I lied ten runs for ten hits.
"Those freshmen who wish to
continue with baseball this quarter
I should report to the sunken diamond
every Monday, Wednesday, and
1 Thursday," Shipkey said yesterday,
j "Those baseball men who desire to
change sports for the remainder of
| the quarter should make their in-
I tentions known through the 8.A.C."
