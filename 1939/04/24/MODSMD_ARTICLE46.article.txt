THAT stapled tan pamphlet known as the
Bawlout is on sale again, offering among
other things a tabulation of every undergradu
ate's scholastic progress to date.
The practice of publishing grade points
sounds barbarous to outsiders, at least to those
to whom the advantages of the system have
not been explained. They exhibit their naivete
in failing to observe that (1) this is primarily
and inevitably a competitive world, (2) grade
points are absolutely accurate as an indication
of worth and ability, (3) public humiliation is
the best way to help the student attain success.
And then there are some insiders who persist
in criticizing publication of grades.
They say correctors grade examinations on
the basis of a quick squint at what other cor
rectors have determined, as shown in the handy
Bawlout. Well, maybe—pretty hard to prove,
though. Although correctors are paid only 50
cents an hour, they surely must retain at least
that much of their personal integrity.
What these critics can't seem to get through
their heads is the administration's contention
that publication of students' shortcomings is
beneficial in that it spurs them on to correction
and improvement.
In order to make the Bawlout more effective
in this very laudable function, the administra
tion might consider the following additions to
its little tan quarterly:
1. Type of clothing worn—in the case of a
man, at least an indication of whether he wears
jeans and a sweatshirt or coat and tie.
2. Does he drive a car? If so, just how ex
pensive a car?
3. How much money does his father make?
And is it at a reputable trade or profession?
4. Has he ever been caught cheating at mar
bles?—R. D.
