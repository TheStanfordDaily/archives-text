EVER since a certain unpleasant day in the
fall of 1929 this country has been in pretty
poor financial shape. Depression reduced U.S.
assets to melodramatic depths; in the blackness
of a national emergency the Blue Eagle ap
peared and President Roosevelt was the armed
champion of prosperity.
In those rough days Stanford was distinctly
a luxury. The student body dwindled, and en
dowment dropped to an all-time low. However,
there came eventually a rallying point. The
sacred bond of 500 was broken, and the Uni
versity followed the nation in struggling to re
gain its feet.
Optimism in this case was somewhat illu
sory. Recovery ran straight into the pit of re
cession, and Stanford was back on her heels
again. This time things were not bad enough
to cause a national crusade. An anti-New Deal
er was no longer a traitor to the cause. The
nation seemed to wallow in hopeless medi
ocrity, shabby gentility—and Stanford followed
in the path.
These are the factors that have determined
the psychological set of the present student
body and of the past few graduating classes. It
cannot be definitely tagged as one of complete
hopelessness, but there is something reminis
cent of melancholia in it.
Reflecting on Stanford's future, students do
not find financial prospects encouraging. En
dowment increases are painfully slow, slow
enough to stifle progress. "If someone would
only die and leave us a couple of millions," is
a repeated moan.
The University has gone to its alumni for
support through the Stanford Fund. It has used
every conceivable means to secure funds and
still keep its self-respect. To date, its success
has not been sensational.
We are Stanford. Consequently we are faced
with this problem: How is the financial pros
perity of the University to be regained?
Perhaps it will only return with the palmy
days of another post-war period, an encore of
the crazy '20's. But if the nation never fully
recovers from the adverse economic conditions
of the past ten years—then what?
We close with a question mark.—L. L.

the psychological set of the present student
body and of the past few graduating classes. It
cannot be definitely tagged as one of complete
hopelessness, but there is something reminis
cent of melancholia in it.
Reflecting on Stanford's future, students do
not find financial prospects encouraging. En
dowment increases are painfully slow, slow
enough to stifle progress. "If someone would
only die and leave us a couple of millions," is
a repeated moan.
The University has gone to its alumni for
support through the Stanford Fund. It has used
every conceivable means to secure funds and
still keep its self-respect. To date, its success
has not been sensational.
We are Stanford. Consequently we are faced
with this problem: How is the financial pros
perity of the University to be regained?
Perhaps it will only return with the palmy
days of another post-war period, an encore of
the crazy '20's. But if the nation never fully
recovers from the adverse economic conditions
of the past ten years—then what?
We close with a question mark.—L. L.
