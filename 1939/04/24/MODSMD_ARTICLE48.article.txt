# Reality on the Farm
## 
### 
THE agricultural labor situation, particularly
critical in California and well on its way to
being the nation's top problem, is getting a fair
sized modicum of attention by Stanford this
week.
The Steinbeck Committee visited a migrant
camp Sunday, and they are planning another
trip for next Sunday.
The government film, "The River," is being
shown Wednesday night in the Women's Club
house. At the same meeting, Milan Dempster,
director of the camp, will explain the whole

set-up of government administration of migrant
agricultural labor.
Tonight, on the Stanford radio hour, Frederick
Arpke, economics instructor, will discuss "Mi
gratory Workers and Industrial Farming."
For those who think this is too much attention
to a specific problem, let them get wise and
read John Steinbeck's "Their Blood Is Strong,"
and see just what the people of California and
the people of the United States are facing as
the agricultural revolution becomes a reality.â€”
