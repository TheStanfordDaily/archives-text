# Arpke to Discuss Migratory Relief
## 
### 
California's problem of what to
do about the ever-increasing migra
tion of agricultural laborers, into
the state's farming areas has sud
denly jumped into the limelight as
a social problem of national signifi
cance during the past few years.
The problem will be analyzed to
night for radio listeners when
Frederick Arpke, acting instructor in
economics at Stanford University,
discusses "Migratory Labor and In
dustrialized Farming" on the Stan
ford radio program over station KGO
at 8:30 o'clock.
"These interstate migrations of
refugees, as well as the recnt sit
down strike of Missouri share-crop
pers against a landlord who had
evicted them, and many other inci
dents," acocrding to Mr. Arpke "are
simply outward manifestations of
much more fundamental and in fact
rather frightening social and eco
nomic changes now taking place."
