NO NUDES IS GOOD NUDES
la.st fall the fragments of an intriguing
k story began to turn up around the campus; pieced
together jig-saw puzzle fashion they made a very in
teresting narrative. I can't swear to the accuracy of
this report, because the principals shudder and change
the subject when I mention it, but I believe that this
is a fair approximation of the truth.
It seems that one of our neighboring high schools
requested the University to provide a program fox
its girls' assembly, and after the buck had been passed
through appropriate channels; a squad of Stanford stu
dents was sent out to deliver an hour's entertainment
according to specifications. The first part of the act
was made up of pantomimes, received with the polite
applause and impolite giggles typical of high school
girls. After that came movies of Stanford life hastily
borrowed from an alumnus organization.

r pHE usual shots of the Quad and the Library stag
gered across the screen; the girls stirred restlessly.
Then suddenly the assembly stiffened, choked, and
finally howled like a band of Apaches swooping down
on a settlei - 's cabin. Included in the movie reel was a
sequence taken at the Encina pools; and cavorting be
fore the girls' assembly was Stanford's manhood, clad
in the usual pool costume which consists of a towel
thrown around the shoulders.
The story is muddled from here on in. The stu
dents involved are still with us, and so we conclude
that there was no lynching. Tar and feathers are ru
mored, but. sound improbable. The most likely version
is that the students murmured something about Stan
ford being proud of its swimming pools, and bÂ®lted.
I don't doubt them when they say they were embar
rassed.
The reverberations finally died down. The donors
of the film explained that the particular reel was
meant to be released to men's clubs only. But evi
dently the story has not been forgotten. In last Fri
day's Daily I notice that an Artists' Bureau has been
formed by Ram's Head, intended to see "whenever
Ram's Head members are called upon to give enter
tainment on or off the campus that the proper facili
ties for the act are provided and that the act fits the
audience."
There are other reasons for forming the Bureau, of
course. But I have a notion that the incident of the
girls' assembly is the effective cause. Similarly, there
is no better way of throwing the new organization a
bouquet than by reciting the story of that tragedy.
Stanford is intended to furnish education, but it is not
out to capture "La Vie Parisienne" trade.
The law of averages says the same accident won't
happen again, but the supply of accidents in this world
is almost unlimited. Tine trouble of running the Art
ists' Bureau is a cheap price for protection.
