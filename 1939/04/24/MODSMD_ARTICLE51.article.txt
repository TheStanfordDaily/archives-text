# Lightly . . . And Politely
## NAUGHTY 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Last. Thursday night far several minutes a great,
many of the cars driving down Palm Drive slowed
down, when they reached a certain spot, and their
passengers ogled.
They were ogling a young blond being necked in
plain sight by one man—by one man at a time, that
is.
My, God, they said.
They might be disappointed to learn that the blond
was being necked for art's sake, and not because it is
spring quarter and she felt like it.
She was being necked while Quad photographers
took her picture for a page, destined to be a popular
page, in that publication.
Sorry, boys.
