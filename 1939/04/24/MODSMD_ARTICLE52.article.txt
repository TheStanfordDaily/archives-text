### 
The man who was, and possibly still is, around
the campus drawing portraits and caricatures was
telling us of a time when he was plying his trade at
Northwestern.
He had made a portrait of a young man, and as he
was putting on the finishing touches, filling in the
background, he forgot to toll his model that he need
not pose any longer. He turned the portrait upside
down for this background work.
And, while he was working and the young man
was posing, the young man's mother came in with
several other women.
One of them went over to look at the portrait.
"Marvelous," she said. "Come and look at this.
It's marvelous, simply amazing. He is drawing this
picture upside down."
