# 'Story of Bell' Only Mediocre Tearjerker
## 
### 
"The Story of Alexander Graham
Bell," currently playing at the
Fox-Stanford
Sad and sentimental but factually
pni-rpft iii its main plnments is this

latest addition to
the "lives - of -
great-men" series.
Starring in the
title role Don
Ameche, and Lo
retta Young and
Henry Fonda in
runner-up spots,
"Alexander Gra
ham Bell" draws
its main strength
from the faculty
in which Ameri
can movie-makers
excell, story-tell
ine.

Don Ameche, often either moon
faced or affectedly glib, manages to
handle his characterization with rea
sonable competence. Loretta Young
is lovely, faithful, plays Bell's wife
with sympathy and poignant charm.
Henry Fonda, though not provided
with the strongest kind of a role,
spills a little humor into a picture
that is too preoccupied with its se
rious burden.
Minor posts are taken by run-of
the-mill character actors, and the
spirit of the late 19th century is
sustained with consistency. Aver
age in too many ways, "Alexander
Graham Bell" is basically a tear
jerker that rises above this cate
gory now and then to become sound
entertainment.â€”Hutchinson
