The Editor, Sir:
Today, one of us read your paper
by mistake and saw the marvelous
build-up that you gave our little
party. Wo hope you are getting fun
out of it!
Personally, we don't give a damn
about your opinions, for that is all
you are actually publishing. If you
must write about the party, why in
hell don't you get the story straight?
Come on over, and we will douse
your enthusiasm.
