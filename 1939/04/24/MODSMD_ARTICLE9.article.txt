# Boyer Bows Out Sunday Scries
## 
### 
Bowing out with grace and charm,
the AS.S.U.'s Sunday movie series,
chairmanned by Coilne Upshaw, last |
night brought the Farm outstanding
entertainment in "Orage," French !
film starring Charles Boyer and
Michele Morgan.
Filmed in 1938 after completion of
the international sensation, "Mayer- 1
ling," "Orage" fails to hit the high
mark set by its predecessor. How
ever, the Boyer-Morgan combina
tion furnishes a haunting, poignant j
picturization of the familiar tri- j
angle. !
Hampered by a flimsy plot and
unintelligent cutting, the picture's
force rests upon excellent character
portrayal, direction, and superb
photography. American audiences,,
used to the proverbial happy end- ;
ing, may find "Orage's" conclusion ;
vaguely unsatisfying, ending, as it j
docs, on a note of futility. â€” Troi- i
samis.
