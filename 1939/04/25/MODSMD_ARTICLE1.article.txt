### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
'yiR. NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN
of Birmingham is a loyal Con
servative, a typical representative
of the manufacturing upper middle
class. As representative of the
world's most powerful constitution
al monarchy, his attitude follows
closely that of the cautious British
he represents. Two chains anchor
his feet to the ground, tradition and
the protection of dominant inter
ests.
In the light of these facts, it is to
bo expected that the Prime Minis
ter's moves in the international
game will be calculated to further
the cause he represents. When Mr.
Chamberlain feels that England's
political and economic dominance is
in danger, he will take a firm stand
against the threatening nations. If
there are no interests at stake, un
doubtedly he will return to the
avowed policy of his party—appease
ment.

Of recent months Britannia lias
found herself face to face with a
series of crises and the menacing
aggressions of an expanding Ger
many. The first explosion last
September found her unprepared
to protest against swallowing Hit
ler's bitter dose.
After muddling through Munich,
Prime Minister Chamberlain ini
tiated his appeasement crusade, but
its success was not remarkable. Re
peatedly the British turned the
other cheek, only to be met with a
growing Nazi menace. When Ger
many swallowed Bohemia and Mor
avia and England started her stop-
Hitler drive, observers believed that
at last the camel's back was broken.

J>UT yesterday Sir Neville Hen
derson was sent back to his post
as ambassador to Berlin, ostensibly
with a combination warning and
peace message suggesting to the
Fuehrer that he answer President
Roosevelt's non-aggression proposal
civilly and in a manner conducive
to world peace. True it is that this
is not as wishy-washy as was Brit
ain's diplomatic policy before the
disappearance of Czechoslovakia, but
it tends to point back in the old
direction.
England will not complete her
projected pact with Russia until
she learns exactly what Herr Hit
ler is going to say to the U. S.
President in his indirect answer
through the Reichstag Friday. A
British-Soviet pact could be ex
pected to provoke nothing but an
undiplomatically terse totalitar
ian rejection.

It is probable that if the Reich
tempers its reply in the interests of
peace, Britain will abstain from
tying herself to the U.S.S.R., and
visions of an anti-Fascist bloc in
Europe will return to their former
hazy state. The alliance of a Con
servative government with a Com
munist state is not only highly il
logical, but highly improbable un
less Hitler overturns the apple cart.
* t r
d OBSERVERS of the news behind
the news claim that the Con
servative policy is dictated by a
long term project designed to
preserve the rights of property
against socialism. It is said that
what England fears more than
anything else is the success of the
communistic system in Russia.
Therefore, she is working to
strengthen Germany as a means of
holding back the U.S.S.R.
France is being held in the bal
ance as a strategic ally. The Con
servative hope is that; eventually
the Reich and the Soviet will come
to war, but. only when Germany is
strong enough to defeat the com
bined forces of France and Russia.
When the Nazis arc victorious, they
will be so weakened that they will
be an easy prey for the English, who
will ihen rule Europe.

its success was not remarkable. Re
