# Comedy, Novelty to Reign In Dekker's 'Shoemaker'
## 
### 
High comedy will hit the campus Thursday night when the Department
of Speech and Drama takes the boards of the Memorial Hall stage with
its production of "Shoemaker's Holiday" hy Thomas Dekker.
Using modern costumes and no props, the play will be the most unusual
to be soen by Farm audiences this season from the production standpoint.
Waldemar Johansen, director, feels^— —

that this novel presentation method |
will add to the hilarious effect.
Asher Wilson, who plays the pom- |
pous shoemaker, Simon Eyre, has
a part similar to that of Shake
speare's Falstaff.
The costuming department has
been presented with the difficult
problem of supplying Wilson with a
suit which will give him the neces
sary rotundity and yet permit him to
get around with the nimblcness
typical of the character.
Playing Firk, Eyre's journeyman,
will be Merle Meacham. Firk is a
miniature carbon copy of the Shoe
maker, and he apes his idol in ev
ery possible way. However he must
make up for his lack of Eyre's
strength with blustering talk.
In the role of Marjorie, the Shoe
maker's wife, is Patty de Roulf. She .
is a perfect counterpart of her hus
band. Of her, Director Johansen >
says, "She will demonstrate the
perfect method of how not to wear j
a Paris hat.. But as Marjorie her- i
self would comment, 'Let that i
pass.' "
The romantic love story of Ro
land Lacy, portrayed by Jack Daw
son, and Rose, Marian Guyselman, is
marred by the interference of his j
father, the suave Earl of Lincoln,:
and her father, the blustering Lord ;
Mayor of London, who arc played by
Garrett Starmer and Mel Mack, re- j
spectively.
Complicated by many sub-plots i
which will add to the roistering hu- j
mor of the piece, the Elizabethan j
comedy will feature the following
in the more outstanding roles: Ted '
Marcuse, Barbara Thrasher, Helen j
Young, Norm Sloane, Phil Harris, j
and Quentin Warren.

typical of the character.
Playing Firk, Eyre's journeyman,
will be Merle Meacham. Firk is a
miniature carbon copy of the Shoe
maker, and he apes his idol in ev
ery possible way. However he must
make up for his lack of Eyre's
strength with blustering talk.
In the role of Marjorie, the Shoe
maker's wife, is Patty de Roulf. She .
is a perfect counterpart of her hus
band. Of her, Director Johansen >
says, "She will demonstrate the
perfect method of how not to wear j
a Paris hat.. But as Marjorie her- i
self would comment, 'Let that i
pass.' "
The romantic love story of Ro
land Lacy, portrayed by Jack Daw
son, and Rose, Marian Guyselman, is
marred by the interference of his j
father, the suave Earl of Lincoln,:
and her father, the blustering Lord ;
Mayor of London, who arc played by
Garrett Starmer and Mel Mack, re- j
spectively.
Complicated by many sub-plots i
which will add to the roistering hu- j
mor of the piece, the Elizabethan j
comedy will feature the following
in the more outstanding roles: Ted '
Marcuse, Barbara Thrasher, Helen j
Young, Norm Sloane, Phil Harris, j
and Quentin Warren.
