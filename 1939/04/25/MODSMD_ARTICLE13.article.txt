"Probably the most important
single reason for the current inter
est in the problem of the migratory
agricultural worker is the fact that
these people have been migrating
in such large numbers that they
have created a serious relief prob
lem in some states," said Frederick
Arpke acting instructor of eco
nomics.
He spoke on the regular Stanford
University Radio Hour last night on
"Migratory Labor and Industrialized
Fanning."
"As far as California is concerned
migratory labor is nothng new —
neither is the industrialized farm,"
said Dr. Arpke. "Seasonal unem
ployment has existed for years, but
during the past few years California
has been on the receiving end of
one of the largest mass migrations
in our history."
