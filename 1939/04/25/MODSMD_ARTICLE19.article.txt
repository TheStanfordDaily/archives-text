# S.P.U. Plans Party Debate
## Factions to Debate U. S. Foreign Policy 
### 
Again bringing up the question of
international politics, the Political
Union will have as the subject of
Thursday evening's debate, "Resolv
ed, that the United States should un
compromisingly support Great Brit
ain and France in any policy they
may adopt toward the dictator na
tions."
This week's meeting will be the
first of the quarter, and the stand
ing committee has scheduled an
other to be held some time in May.
It was learned that the Union may
at that time bring in a prominent
Bay Region critic to take part in
the debate.
Anticipating Thursday's debate
party leaders have scheduled cau
cuses to map out party stands.
The Liberals, headed by Carl
Dcisenroth, will meet Wednesday
evening in the Women's Clubhouse
at 7:15 o'clock.
Tim Hays, leader of the Conserva
tives, announced that his party
would make final arrangements in
their program before the house is
called to order Thursday.
No time has been announced for
the abor party caucus, but Bob
Wood stated that "the left-wingers
could be counted on to do more
than peacefully back any Liberal
proposition when the debate reaches
the floor."
