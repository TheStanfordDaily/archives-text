### 
WASHINGTON, April 24 (UP).â€”
AFL President William Green to
night suggested a poll of the na
tion's 450,000 soft coal miners to de
termine whether they want closed
shop representation by John L.
Lewis' United Mine Workers' un
ion.
Green addressed an open letter to
Special Government Mediator John
R. Steelman, who delayed until to
morrow morning his meeting with
Appalachian bituminous producers
and U.M.W. officials whose deadlock
on contract terms has caused 330,000
miners to be idle since April 1.
Lewis has instructed another 130,000
workers to close down the rest of
the soft coal mines by May 4, unless
he and the operators come to terms.
Experiments at the University of
Missouri indicated cows give richer
milk during cold weather than in
the summer time.
