### 
Stanford will "lake down its
hair" on Friday night when the
sophomores sound the opening gun
in this year's Convalescent Home
drive hy staging their traditional
Carnival in the Pavilion.
Chainnanned by Bob Newell,
committees of workers have been
mapping plans for the night that
Stanford lives up to its name of
"the Farm." According to Newell,
56 big-time concessions will crowd
the Pavilion, trickle out into the
handball courts outside.
BECKHAM ROW HEAD
All fraternity concessions have
been listed with the committee in
charge of Row organization, ac
cording to Chieftain Bob Beckham.
Because they couldn't sign SalJy
Rand, the Dekes have decided to
arrange a take-off on the familiar
fan-dancer. Details of the act have
not been released, though, according
to Beckham.
Last year's favorite, the Phi Psi
flivver, will again be given away.
"It's the same kind of a black, shiny
Tee that aroused such a covetous
gleam in many an eye last year,"
the Phi Psi's declared.
Fiji pledges will again have pies
tossed at them by the fun-hunting
throng. While Sigma Chi pledges
act Shakespeare, hawkers will pass
through the crowd selling assorted
vegetables â€” not-so-fresh tomatoes
and cabbages.
KIMBALL WARNS STUDENTS
"If we can't take your money away
from you honestly, we'll do it dis
honestly," Soph President Park Kim
ball warned. Means of "fleecing" un
suspecting Carnival-goers is a series
of concessions specializing in card
games. They're being arranged by
Zete Jack Grover, who is also out
lining plans for a magic stand and a
clairvoyant booth.
Later in the evening if celebrating
Stanfordites decide to go "smooth"
they may dance at the Phi Delt's
dime-a-dance concession. An or
chestra made up of A.K.L.'s will
play ,it is expected. Popular last
year, this booth should attract even
more people this year, President
Kimball hopes. "Admission to the
Carnival itself is, of course, free,"
he added.
