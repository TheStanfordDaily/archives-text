### 
LA PAZ, Bolivia, April 24 (UP). —
President German Busch today
abolished constitutional guarantees,
dissolved the Congress and set up a ■
totalitarian dictatorship in a drastic J
move to cope with internal eco- !
nomic and political conditions that j
threatened Bolivia with bankruptcy |
and revolution,
Busch, who became provisional
president in July, 1937, after the
overthrow of Col. David Toro and
was elected constitutional head of
the country last May, said his dicta- !
torship was neither extreme Leftist
nor Rightist, but "entirely Bolivian"
in character.
He explained his action, which was
supported by the nation's armed
forces, was necessary to save the i
country from a "formidable eco- ;
nomic crisis" and a "fratricidal ,
struggle" being plotted by political i
parties in their "morbid desire" to
seize power.
