# 'Dink' Discards Starting Blocks In Experiment
## Shovels May Replace Hammers and Nails At Saturday's Meet 
### 
Coach Dink Templeton is experi
menting with his traeksters again.
This time it's with starting methods
with which to aid his sprinters and
hurdlers.
Starting blocks attracted quite
some attention back in the days of
Frank Wyckoff when Frank, with
their aid, was breaking all sorts of
dash records. But only in the past
live years have starting blocks been
declared legal and times made with
them been accepted by the A.A.U.
However, Dink claims that even
when Wyckoff was doing his record
smashing and when trackmen the
country over accepted them, he saw
no particular benefit in them.
Apparently out to show that start
ing in the old-fashioned method,
from holes, is just as efficient as the
newer method, Dink yesterday put
his speed-burners, namely, Dick
Simpson, Paul Huston, Stan Hiser
man, Dick Carew, and Clyde Jef
frey, through practice in using holes.
The results were surprisingly
good; for Jeffrey, Carew and Hiser
man, trying the old method, were
rolling out of their holes on even
terms with that dean of starters,
Ray Dean. In Wednesday's twi
light meet, these boys will try their
new weapon for the first time. And
if they are successful, they will take
their little shovels with them to the
P.A. invitational meet at Edwards
field Saturday.
California, Olympic Club, and
Stanford are entering full teams.
The list of Cardinal eindermen go
ing north for this meet has reached
forty-two.
