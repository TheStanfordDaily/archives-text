# El Campo Wins Tight Ball Game
## 
### 
Playing in the tightest softball
game of the current season, El
Campo and Sigma Nu battled for two
extra innings, a total ol nine frames,
before El Campo's hurlers finally
eked out a 6-5 decision.
Meanwhile the Phi Delt nine
blasted five of the Japanese Club
pitchers from the mound winning a
decisive victory, 24-7. El Toro
turned back Phi Sig in the third of
yesterday's softball tilts without a
tally, 9-0.
The 19139 intramural hardball sea
son was opened with a bang by a
Phi Psi team that clouted its way
to an overwhelming 20-1 win over
a hapless S.A.E. team. The other
scheduled hardball match between
Alpha Delt and Phi Kap was called
off.
