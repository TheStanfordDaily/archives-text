TWO hundred and ten feet straight up.
That, according to Stanford's undergradu
ate opinion, is too much.
But the architects feel differently—and with
some good reason. At any rate, with surveyors
now on the grounds, measuring for founda
tions, ready to conduct necessary preliminary
tests, their verdict will be accepted.
' Behind the acceptance of the plans for the
tower, lays the contention that Stanford —aes-
thetically—needs height to counterbalance the
sprawl of the older sandstone Quad, the Li
brary, Theater, Education Budding, and the
halls.
Perhaps that is correct.
Some of Stanford's critics, who go even
farther than to take the opposite view on this
artistic question, feel that the money about to
be expended on the Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace is a gross extravagance.
Aesthetically, there is some argument; as
to the expenditure, there is none.
In the first place, the money donated for this
purpose probably would not be donated for
anything else. Any contention that the Uni
versity is using University funds for construc
tion is entirely erroneous.
Secondly, the library long ago outgrew its
present quarters in the main Library, and as one
of the world's most outstanding institutions it
is certainly entitled to more than a side-door
and cubbyhole.
That the money is to be expended for quar
ters which reach to the sky (210 feet, straight
up), to many also seems rank heresy to a tra
ditional love of low tile roofs.
Stanford will be horribly self-conscious of the
tower when it is finished.
It's too late now, however, for student com
mittees to lodge protest.
It's a case of getting used to the idea—like
the Libe fountain.
