# What's on Your Head?

### 
STANFORD women never have been known
for their beauty. In fact, for a great many
years the Farm was reputed to be the refuge
of 500 of the ugliest specimens in captivity. In
the absence of feminine pulchritude, the torch
has fallen to the men students to establish a
local reputation for good looks.
Evidently they have met with some measure
of success because informal polls of Pacific
Coast colleges indicate that Stanford men are
considered to hold an embarrassingly big edge
on sex appeal. However, distressing signs in
high places may mean that this reputation is
founded on a misconception—the expanding
dream of a U.S.C. woman who saw two Stanford
specimens working at the beach one summer.
It is water and water alone that is responsible
for the downfall of the rough. There is only
one thing more disastrous to masculine glamour
than a paunch, and that is a bald head.
The University treats its water with chlorine
and other chemicals so that it may pass the
highest standards for purity. But the same
substances that kill the little animals in the
shower pipes deal a nasty blow to each indi
vidual hair. Bravely the follicles struggle to
maintain their grip, but inevitably they must
relax. A four-year course at Stanford has the
same effect on a head of hair as 50 years of
playing the stock market.
From time to time complaints have been reg
istered both by men students growing bald and
their disappointed girl-friends. But there is
nothing to be done about it. Losing our hair is
just another of the sacrifices we must make for
the privilege of going to Stanford.—L. L.
