THEY may not make as much noise as Car
dinals or Rally Committee, but the sixteen
members of the International Committee have
potentially a more significant function than the
respective dance-planners and hilarity-advo
cates of the other two groups.

But the problems facing the International
Committee are not the spectacular sort. They
include foreign students' confusion on Reg Day
when they find themselves enmeshed in seat
card queues, housing difficulties, and the prob
lem of entering into extracurricular activities.
Actual progress of the committee to date,
moreover, is no more spectacular than the
problems faced. Although the group's spokes
men announced ambitious plans last winter,
accomplishments made thus far are mostly
along the line of plans for next year's program.
These preparations—getting up an information
bulletin for entering students, setting up a filing
system —are, no doubt, necessities.
But there are a couple of other big items that
the committee hasn't touched yet—proposed
scholarships for Chinese students at Lingnan
University and the establishing of an interna
tional house on the campus.
Of course there are difficulties obstructing
these two projects, but the committee will do
well to keep working at its long-run objectives.
Setting up the machinery for handling the rou
tine difficulties of the foreign students should
not be allowed to overshadow major
like scholarships and an international house,
difficult as the attainment of the latter may be.
