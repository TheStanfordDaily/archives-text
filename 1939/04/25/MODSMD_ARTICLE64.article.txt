### JOHN COBBS 
I WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL TOO
IT SURPRISED me considerably to discover from a
letter in (his morning's Campus Opinion column
that Branner's recent fire-hose fiasco was not a bit
of spontaneous rioting but the prelude to a holy war.
Frankly, I had not expected to find anything holy
surviving in a Brannerian environment.
In spite of the letter's assertions, I am inclined to
be skeptical of any surging new nationalism in Bran
ner. Perhaps I will find that I am mistaken when a
coup d'etat puts the Branner Bund in the saddle and
I am hauled out of bed some chilly morning to face a
fire-hosing squad. But in the meantime, I shall pass
over the question of holy wars; I shall not even chal
lenge the statement that Branner men are introverts.
♦ * * *
I am interested, though, in the justification which
our correspondent gives for his experiment in hy
draulics. And I am intrigued by a scriptural passage
to which he refers me. Why, he says, should Branner
be martyred for its prank when the Row throws par
ties that compare well with Nero's best binges. And
why should we object to water in the Halls when we
have learned to duck every time we pass the Dekc
house.
In his bibliography, our writer lists Matthew 7:1-5,
which is the stretch about "Judge not that ye be not
judged."
* * i'fi *
of this makes an interesting argument, and to
refuse it on a philosophical grounds, we would
have to plough through an evaluation of different
grades of sin, working out an exchange ratio in terms
of Row parties and Branner floods. But in his scrip
tural citation, the Brannerian opens the way to easier
rebuttal. If our correspondent had read on, he would
have found the following item in Matthew 7:26-27:
"And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine,
and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish
man, which built his house upon the sand.
"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and
the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell;
and great was the fall of it."
* * * ijt
I don't want this to discourage the Branner boys
in their Bible reading, but I consider the implica
tions of the quotation obvious. The Hall is not built
of granite; its ceilings and floors are not waterproofed.
When the fire-hose floods come, no amount of argu
ing about Row parties will keep the plaster together.
No scriptural citations will hold the ceiling up.
And even as God watches the fall of every spar
row, and sorrows, so does the Administration watch
the fall of every chip of plaster, and sorrows equally.
Branner might have expected that the wrath of the
University would be visited upon it.
The Branner boys show a surprising acquaintance
with the Bible; but I think that they have missed
some of its finer points. And somehow I doubt if they
have enough faith to walk on the water.

some of its finer points. And somehow I doubt if they
have enough faith to walk on the water.
I WENT TO SUNDAY SCHOOL TOO
IT SURPRISED me considerably to discover from a
letter in (his morning's Campus Opinion column
that Branner's recent fire-hose fiasco was not a bit
of spontaneous rioting but the prelude to a holy war.
Frankly, I had not expected to find anything holy
surviving in a Brannerian environment.
In spite of the letter's assertions, I am inclined to
be skeptical of any surging new nationalism in Bran
ner. Perhaps I will find that I am mistaken when a
coup d'etat puts the Branner Bund in the saddle and
I am hauled out of bed some chilly morning to face a
fire-hosing squad. But in the meantime, I shall pass
over the question of holy wars; I shall not even chal
lenge the statement that Branner men are introverts.

I am interested, though, in the justification which
our correspondent gives for his experiment in hy
draulics. And I am intrigued by a scriptural passage
to which he refers me. Why, he says, should Branner
be martyred for its prank when the Row throws par
ties that compare well with Nero's best binges. And
why should we object to water in the Halls when we
have learned to duck every time we pass the Dekc
house.
In his bibliography, our writer lists Matthew 7:1-5,
which is the stretch about "Judge not that ye be not
judged."
* * i'fi *
of this makes an interesting argument, and to
refuse it on a philosophical grounds, we would
have to plough through an evaluation of different
grades of sin, working out an exchange ratio in terms
of Row parties and Branner floods. But in his scrip
tural citation, the Brannerian opens the way to easier
rebuttal. If our correspondent had read on, he would
have found the following item in Matthew 7:26-27:
"And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine,
and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish
man, which built his house upon the sand.
"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and
the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell;
and great was the fall of it."
* * * ijt
I don't want this to discourage the Branner boys
in their Bible reading, but I consider the implica
tions of the quotation obvious. The Hall is not built
of granite; its ceilings and floors are not waterproofed.
When the fire-hose floods come, no amount of argu
ing about Row parties will keep the plaster together.
No scriptural citations will hold the ceiling up.
And even as God watches the fall of every spar
row, and sorrows, so does the Administration watch
the fall of every chip of plaster, and sorrows equally.
Branner might have expected that the wrath of the
University would be visited upon it.
The Branner boys show a surprising acquaintance
with the Bible; but I think that they have missed
some of its finer points. And somehow I doubt if they
have enough faith to walk on the water.
