They say that the frosh track coach does not know
about this. They say he is not. likely to find out.
After the meet at Cal, a Gamma Phi who was in
a hurry to get back to the Farm in time to go on a
date passed the bus taking the frosh team home.
It is not clear whether the girl knew the bus driver,
or one of the frosh, or the whole team, or the whole
team and the bus driver. But. someone, or all of them
yelled to her, "Do you want a ride home? A good fast
ride home?"
Exactly what she wanted. So they smuggled her
home with them.
Proof that the track team is a little slow was clearly
shown. Not one of them was fast enough to date her
for the evening. That she already had a date would
have made no difference to a really fast team.

"That was Blank."
"Blank!" he exploded "Blank! I swore I would
never talk to that guy,"

There may be nothing in this at all. I'm not sure.

about the now Dean of Men that the lake dried up.
The lake could have been scared.
