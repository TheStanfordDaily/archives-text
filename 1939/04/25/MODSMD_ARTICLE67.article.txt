# Former Student Tells Of Flying Opportunities

### 
"With the present expansion of the
government air corps and domestic
and foreign air lines, there is unlim
ited opportunity for pilots and aero
nautical engineers in this field. In
fact, I would say that opportunities
in the aviation industry are better
now than ever before."
Speaking was Ned Avary, who
graduated from Stanford with the
Class of '32 and at present is flying
the Central and South American
run for Pan American Airways.
Avary, a tall, blond, good looking
fellow dressed in white trousers and
shirtâ€”apropos of a pilot, was visit
ing the campus for the first time
since his graduation. He was a Delt
during his undergraduate days.
"I didn't do a thing while at
school except, ultimately get my econ
degree and sit out at the Paly air
port and watch them fly. Oh, yes, 1
did get my frosh track letter by the
grace of God and the near-sighted
ness of the judges," the pilot said.
After graduation Avary learned to
fly and served four years with the
army air corps. For the last two
years he has been with the Western
division of Pan American. His pres
ent run is from Brownsville, Texas,
through Mexico, to every country in
Central America, and finishing at
Venezuela.
"For a while I flew the Florida-
Rio de Janeiro run," Avary reveal
ed. "My present trip is very inter

esting; over the volcano territory in
Mexico and the jungle lands further
south."
Popping the illusion that flying is
necessarily a dangerous, adventur
ous occupation, Avary remarked
that "we very rarely, if at all, get in
j trouble on our flights. The only ex
| citement I've ever had was one
parachute jump when I was in the
j army.
"No, we don't use radio beams to
; keep on the course, but we have di
-1 rection finders. There is a loop at
I the ground station which determines
j the plane's bearings and radios their
I bearings back to the ships. We em
! ploy the same procedure from di-
I rection finding loops located on the
i ships' wings."
