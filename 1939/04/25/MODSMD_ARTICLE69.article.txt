# CAMPUS OPINION
## MAN THE TOWER! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The god in the dean's office has
spoken; now the angels sing. But
we at Brainier Hall are unimpressed
by you weather vanes of decorum,
you sudden reformers and frown
ers, for if Branner Hall is a menace
to Stanford's reputation, what about
the wild, ghastly drunks of some of
the rushing parties, what about thooj
sharp shooters who pick of! civil
ians and ruin more dresses than
they know—those fools on the sec
ond floor of the D.K.E. house?
Here we are on the outskirts of
the university. We study, and our
record scholastically for men is the
highest on the campus. But we have
not a pressure group, we are no
flashing extroverts, but goons and
introverts. But there is a nidden
spirit of organization here, and The
Daily cannot slap it down from it*
long distance views on the other side
of the campus. For we're preparing
we're practicing; we're waiting.
As for the present we shall take
our ethics from the dictates of our
consciences, and that, shall be Bran
nerian. We might ask Cobbs, before
he gets too good, to read Matthew
7:1-5 (New Testament). But in the
future, if you damn rascals keep
baiting us, we'll fight—and it will
be as it was on that historic Mon
day night—good, clean, chlorinated
water.
Then we will have taken our stand
for self determination, and you had
better send out freshman stooges to
watch out from that ivory tower,
for we'll march!
