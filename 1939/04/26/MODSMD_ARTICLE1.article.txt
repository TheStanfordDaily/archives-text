### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
* In continental Europe compul
sory military service has come to be
the accepted thing, as inevitable as
death and taxes. But in the liberal
democracies of England and the
United States, young men have not
yet. learned to look forward to
spending several years in military
training. There is something in it
that seems to conflict with the funda
mental standard of the English
speaking countries.
Yet, when war came 25 years ago,
both nations found it necessary to
resort to conscription to put an ade
quate fighting force in the field. The
idea of compulsory service is ab
horrent to a Britain. It was only
after two years of muddling through
the Great War that Lloyd George
finally accepted the fact that he
couldn't win with a volunteer army.
Today there is no war, but Britain
will return to conscription.
# » *
The Cabinet met yesterday to
draft a bill which will put 750.000
Englishmen under military train
ing, the number being set by the
limitations of arms production.
Today Prime Minister Chamber
lain will present the measure to
Parliament which, in accord with
strong public opinion, is almost
certain to pass it.
At the same time the Commons
will be called upon to approve a
record peace-time "war" budget.
There are reasons why England will
adopt conscription today, why the
British will brush aside tradition and
prejudice and submit to compulsory
military service.
r jpWO comparatively insignificant
incidents have piqued the Eng
lish government to the extent that it
realizes that definite action is the
only thing that impresses Adolf Hit
ler. One of the immediate causes of
the conscription bill arises from a
bit of gossip reported in London yes
terday by Rumanian Foreign Min
ister Grigore Gafencu.
Arriving in the City of Westmin
ster after consulting with the
Fuehrer last week on the Nazi-
Rumanian economic pact, the
Balkan diplomat revealed that Hit
ler considers Britain's army a joke.
Conversations about Chamber
lain's guarantee to protect Ru
mania from totalitarian aggression
brought out the fact that the
Reich has no fear of attack from
what it terms England's ridicu
lously inadequate army.
* * H«
Second reason why the compul
sory service bill was drafted yester
day was a direct diplomatic slap in
the face from Germany. The Prime
Minister sent Ambassador Sir Ne
ville Henderson back to his post at
Berlin Monday with definite in
structions to warn the Fuehrer to
temper his reply to President Roose
velt's non-aggression proposal in
the interests of peace.
When Sir Neville went to call on
Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop
yesterday, he was curtly told that
the master wasn't home, the master
wouldn't be back, the master was
busy anyway. This amounts to Herr
Hitler's refusal fo consult, with the
British before he delivers his answer
to the Reichstag Friday.
to * *
r |MIE snub may mean one of two
things. Either the Nazi chief
has dccidcd to have no truck
whatsoever with the anti-totali
tarian powers, or lie expects to de
liver an amicable reply and he
does not want it thought that
Chamberlain dictated it.
In any case, this faux pas, along
with the story of Hitler's sneers,
has set off the fuse. Ever since Mu
nich, the English people have felt
uneasy, realizing the inadequacy of
their defenses and knowing that
eventually they would have to re
sort to conscription.

Yet, when war came 25 years ago,
both nations found it necessary to
resort to conscription to put an ade

The Cabinet met yesterday to
draft a bill which will put 750.000
Englishmen under military train
ing, the number being set by the
limitations of arms production.
Today Prime Minister Chamber
lain will present the measure to
Parliament which, in accord with
strong public opinion, is almost
certain to pass it.
At the same time the Commons
will be called upon to approve a
record peace-time "war" budget.
There are reasons why England will
adopt conscription today, why the
British will brush aside tradition and
prejudice and submit to compulsory
military service.
r jpWO comparatively insignificant
incidents have piqued the Eng
lish government to the extent that it
realizes that definite action is the
only thing that impresses Adolf Hit
ler. One of the immediate causes of
the conscription bill arises from a
bit of gossip reported in London yes
terday by Rumanian Foreign Min
ister Grigore Gafencu.
Arriving in the City of Westmin
ster after consulting with the
Fuehrer last week on the Nazi-
Rumanian economic pact, the
Balkan diplomat revealed that Hit
ler considers Britain's army a joke.
Conversations about Chamber
lain's guarantee to protect Ru
mania from totalitarian aggression
brought out the fact that the
Reich has no fear of attack from
what it terms England's ridicu
lously inadequate army.

Second reason why the compul
sory service bill was drafted yester
day was a direct diplomatic slap in
the face from Germany. The Prime
Minister sent Ambassador Sir Ne
ville Henderson back to his post at
Berlin Monday with definite in
structions to warn the Fuehrer to
temper his reply to President Roose
velt's non-aggression proposal in
the interests of peace.
When Sir Neville went to call on
Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop
yesterday, he was curtly told that
the master wasn't home, the master
wouldn't be back, the master was
busy anyway. This amounts to Herr
Hitler's refusal fo consult, with the
British before he delivers his answer
to the Reichstag Friday.

Chamberlain dictated it.
In any case, this faux pas, along
with the story of Hitler's sneers,
has set off the fuse. Ever since Mu

uneasy, realizing the inadequacy of
their defenses and knowing that
eventually they would have to re
