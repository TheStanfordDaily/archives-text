## Steinbeck Committee Offers Movie Tonight 
### 
The story of the Mississippi will
be depicted tonight in the govern
ment film, "The River," to be shown
at 8 o'clock in the Women's Club
house by the Steinbeck Committee.
Also on the evening's program is a
talk by Milen Dempster, manager of
the Westley Federal migratory labor
camp, which will be visited Sunday
by members of the committee.
Mr. Dempster will discuss organi
zation of the federal camps, now
supplanting partly the squatter
camps. At the Westley camp the
peak of the season has passed, but
there are still about 200 agricultural
workers staying theie.
Mr. Dempster has worked at fed
eral camps for four years and is at
pi-esent co-operating with the
Steinbeck Committee in assisting in
planning trips to various camps.
"The River," which has enjoyed
popular runs since its production
last year, is a sequel to "The Plow
that Broke the Plains," which was
shown at Stanford last (juax-ter.
Both pictures were made by the
Farm Security Administration, un
der the department of Agriculture.
Written and directed by Pare
Lorenz, the film is accompanied by
the New York Philharmonic.
The picture is called "The story of
a river: a record of the Missisippi
â€”where it comes from: where it
goes: what it has meant to us, and
what it has cost us."
