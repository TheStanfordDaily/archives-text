## 
### 
Stanford will enjoy itself—and at the same time aid the Convalescent
Home Drive—when the sophomores stage their annual Carnival in the
Pavilion from 7 to 12 o'clock Friday night.
Issuing a call to all committeemen and one representative from each
living group entering a concession to meet with him in the Nitery at 7

►o'clock tomorrow night, Bob Newell,
general chairman, last night indi
cated that nearly all plans are defi
nitely outlined.
Relying upon the same informal
ity that has keynoted previous Car
nivals, sophomores this year will
present an array of fun-making de
vices that includes Shakespeare
with-vegetables to an imitation of
Sally's nude ranch; dancing to a 12-
picce orchestra to pie-throwing.
LATEST CONCESSION
Latest addition to the long list of
booths and concessions came from
the eating clubs yesterday. Accord
ing to Stan Glikbarg, chairman of
Hall organization, El Toro will fea
ture a "roulette" wheel and "chuck
a-luck" games.
El Campo will return to the con
cession that brought that organiza
tion success last year, weight-guess
ing with plenty of canes when the
avoirdupois artist calls it wrong.
Breakers, according to Glikbarg,
will give up water-fighting long
enough on Friday to present campus
fun-seekers a chance to earn big re
wards by their skill at horse-racing.
NUDE RANCH
Los Arcos is developing a re
markable imitation of the nude
ranch, according to early reports.
The exhibit will be ready for spec
tators by 7 o'clock Friday night.
The Indian in the Stanford man or
woman will have an opportunity to
crop out. when El Tigre members
hand Carnival-goers a bow and ar
row and offer prizes for straight
shooting.
In the same vein, if you're good at
tossing a hoop you may come away
with a goose-dinner, because El
Capitan will give you a chance to
drop the ring around one of its
many fat, fleecy geese provided for
the occasion.
Bob Newell yesterday added four
more names to an impressive list of
committee workers when he ap
pointed Gordy Nichols, Frank Mal
lory, Pete Whittlesey, and John All
tucker to aid in construction of the
booths.
