### 
The foreign policy of the United
States will be debated tomorrow
night by the three factions of the
Stanford Political Union when it
meets for the first time this quarter.
Party caucuses have been planned
by the throe groups to map out their
stands and lines of attack on the
subject: "Resolved, that the United
States should uncompromisingly
support Great, Britain and France in
any policy they may adopt toward
the dictator nations."
Carl Deisenroth has announced
that the Liberals will meet tonight at
7:15 o'clock in the Women's Club
house, to make final arrangements.
Bob Wood has planned a caucus
for the Labor party at the same time
tonight, while Tim Hays has called
the Conservatives for a conference
just; before the debate tomorrow
night.
