# 'Shoemaker' Opens Run Tomorrow
## Fifteenth Century Comedy Portrayed In Modern Setting 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Forty-seven years before Colum
bus got around to discovering what
the Western Hemisphere had to of
fer, an enterprising draper and up
holsterer of London town named
Simon Eyre became Lord Mayor.
Tomorrow night, at 8:15 o'clock in
Memorial Hall, nearly 500 years lat
er, Simon Eyre's Saga, now the
"Shoemaker's Holiday," will be
shown to Farm audiences. The
comedy will be presented again
Friday, Saturday, and Monday
nights.
Between 1445 and 1600 when
Dekker wrote the play the draper
and upholsterer became a shoe
maker, but his story remains es
sentially the same. Legend has it
that this 15th century people's
choice rose through "hard work and
shrewd business dealings." As
played by Asher Wilson in "Holi
day," the wily shoemaker docs just
that.
DRAMATIC LICENSE
JDekker became familiar with
Simon Eyre when he read a collec
tion of short stories by Thomas
Deloney called "The Gentle Craft."
The first three of these were a fic
tionization of various incidents in
the life of this colorful character.
Using a dramatist's privilege, he
changed the draper to a shoemaker.
Before the production of this
bawdy comedy, the Elizabethan
drama had tended to emphasize the
romantic fervidness typical of the
great Shakespeare. "Shoemaker's
Holiday" marks a transition between
Elizabethan romanticism and Ja
cobean realism, emphasizing as it
does the realistic depiction of the
middle class.

Forty-seven years before Colum
bus got around to discovering what
the Western Hemisphere had to of
fer, an enterprising draper and up
holsterer of London town named
Simon Eyre became Lord Mayor.
Tomorrow night, at 8:15 o'clock in
Memorial Hall, nearly 500 years lat
er, Simon Eyre's Saga, now the
"Shoemaker's Holiday," will be
shown to Farm audiences. The
comedy will be presented again
Friday, Saturday, and Monday
nights.
Between 1445 and 1600 when
Dekker wrote the play the draper
and upholsterer became a shoe
maker, but his story remains es
sentially the same. Legend has it
that this 15th century people's
choice rose through "hard work and
shrewd business dealings." As
played by Asher Wilson in "Holi
day," the wily shoemaker docs just
that.
DRAMATIC LICENSE
JDekker became familiar with
Simon Eyre when he read a collec
tion of short stories by Thomas
Deloney called "The Gentle Craft."
The first three of these were a fic
tionization of various incidents in
the life of this colorful character.
Using a dramatist's privilege, he
changed the draper to a shoemaker.
Before the production of this
bawdy comedy, the Elizabethan
drama had tended to emphasize the
romantic fervidness typical of the
great Shakespeare. "Shoemaker's
Holiday" marks a transition between
Elizabethan romanticism and Ja
cobean realism, emphasizing as it
does the realistic depiction of the
middle class.
TIME GOES SCREWBALL
Time will be doing nip-ups to
morrow night in Memorial Hall, for
the audience will be seeing a 14th
century character in a late 15th cen
tury play, behaving in the 17th cen
tury baroque manner, dressed in the
costumes of the 20th century. As
Waldemar Johansen, director, says,
"It will be funnier that way."
