# Army Plans Huge Air Base Here
## Moffett Expansion To Make Local Field Largest on Coast 
### 
What is to be one of the largest
Pacific Coast army air fields will be
established next year at Mountain
View's Moffett Field, accoi*ding to
announced plans for the General
Headquartei's Air Force under the
President's expansion bill.
The plans call for reorganization,
transfer, and expansion of existing
units which make up the three wings
composing the GHQ air force.
Giving the army 585 additional
airplanes, and increasing its ord
nance equipment, the $508,789,000
War Department appropriation bill
which yesterday was passed by the
Ilouse and Senate, and will now go
to the President, in addition carries
the actual cash for the defense pro
gram which will bring the strength
of the army air corps to 6000 planes.
MOFFETT EXPANSION
Moffett Field, which is the site of
the giant hangar which housed the
dirigibles Akron and Macon, will
be expanded to three times its pres
ent size, due to distribution of new
units and their assignment here.
At Mountain View will be located
three pursuit fighter squadrons and
headquarters squadrons. The fol
lowing detachments will be brought
here:
Thirty-fifth Pursuit Group, which
will be organized out of the Twen
tieth Pursuit Group now located at
Barksdale Field, Shreveport, La.
This will be composed of headquar
ters and headquarters squadron;
the 18th, 20th, and 21st pursuit
squadrons.
SQUADRONS REMAIN
The 82d Observation Squadron
and the Ninth Air Base Squadron
will remain at MofTett Field, and will
be expanded, as will the weather
detachment and communications de
tachment already at the field.
The Thirty-fifth Pursuit unit alone
will require at least 60 army pilots,
as well as hundreds of mechanics,
and a vast increase in the personnel
of the communications and weather
detachments to handle the aug
mented flow of army air traffic.
Expansion of the Ninth Air Base
and 82d Observation squadrons will
probably bring to MofTett Field ad
ditional officers and enlisted men,
as well as new observation planes
to bring the two units to full
strength. 0
