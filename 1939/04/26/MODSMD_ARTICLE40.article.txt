### MARGE HOVEY WILSON CANNON 
Threats of war in Europe are j
keeping Betty Lou Gewald on the ]
Farm for four years.
Because no one cares to risk being ]
caught on the Continent when war I
breaks out, poeple are traveling on j
the other side of the globe this sum- |
mer. That is, everyone except Miss j
Gewald. who can't go home to
Manila because tourists have book- |
ed all ships to the Orient until the j
middle of July.
II Betty Lou takes a boat there, j
she'll have to turn around and come j
right back. Even "tramp" steamers j
are closed to the Robleite because
single girls under 21 are not ac
cepted as passengers.
But Betty Lou's troubles don't end [
there. Next summer her parents,<
Mr. and Mrs. Harold Gewald, must
spend six months in Europe and
don't like the idea of their only
daughter traveling in what may then i
be a war-torn land.
By the next summer she will be j
nearly through Stanford and ready |
to enjoy a promised graduation
present — a year's trip around the i
world.
This homeless young lady from |
Manila came here a year ago last
March—when she finally steams into
her home poll, she will have been
gone about lour years.
