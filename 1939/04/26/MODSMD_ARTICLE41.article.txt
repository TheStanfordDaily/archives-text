# Bureau Opens New Division For Women
## Feminine Speakers To Address Women's Clubs, Organizations 
### 
A women's division of the Stan
ford Speakers' Bureau has been
opened this quarter, under the lead
ership of Lois Whitmore, women's
manager, which will provide women
speakers from Stanford to speak for
special meetings and organizations.
Since there has been a great de
mand from women's clubs for fem
inine speakers, according to Bob
Wood, bureau manager, this new
service will give women a better
chance to speak.
Membership in the bureau has
previously been limited mainly to
men, with a lew women joining, but
now the feminine roster will be en
larged. The new speakers will not
appear exclusively before women's
clubs, however, Wood stated.
Any women interested in joining
the bureau can apply at the office
in the Old Union to Miss Whitmore,
Monday and Wednesday from 11 to
12 o'clock and Wednesday and Fri
day from 1 to 2 o'clock. If tryoutees
cannot come any of these times, they
should come any other day from 1
to 2, according to Wood.
This special service will feature
talks of interest to women especial
ly, such as Norma Dales' speech on
"Dollars and Scents," which has been
given before many Peninsula
groups.
