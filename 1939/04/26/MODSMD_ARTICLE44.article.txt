### ARCH JENKINS 
WITH A scant two weeks to go
before the Southern California track
meet, the time seems just about
light for us to make a request to
the powers that be regarding the
site of the meet.
Unless someone makes a decision
to the contrary, it is now quite cer
tain that the affair will be held in
the iootball stadium, where the
grass on the middle of tne track is
high enough for longhorn grazing
and where the gentle zephyrs blow
•°o hard that it's doubu'a. i( me hur- |
dies could be held up Lrig enough j
lor a .'ace to be run.
We i, n.; ybe a !
11 ilie but not enougu to show the j
difference in the quality of Angell j
Field and the old mudflat. Angell j
Field, as we have oft repeated, some- !
1 nnes boring even ourselves with our j
fruitless bleacher talk, is second only ,
t» the Fresno oval in speed and all
around condition. The B.A.C. has
spoken, and they have refused to
buna. But, if they want to be dema- ;
gogues, that is their own affair. All
we are asking now is that Stanford\s j
champions be given a chance at the
Trojans on the best field which the !
Farm has to offer.
11 you want to be mercenary about !
the whole thing, you might argue l
that the stadium will hold more
folks, and therefore enable track to j
be self-sustaining. Still, what en- !
joyment is a track meet if you can't ]
see the contestants, and if they spend j
their time turning their ankles in •
the six-inch ruts!

IF THE JS.A.C. were to authorize
the meet for Angell immediately, ,
they could bum enough portable j
bleachers within a week to accom- j
modate a crowd that probably will j
not exceed 8000. All the high schools j
on the Peninsula have stands easily j
removable. The B.A.C. has a few
gross of their own which can be '
brought out of hiding for the occa
sion:
Instead of the tiny patch of seats ;
which is usually propped up on the ]
back straightaway', the B.A.C. could
easily set up an additional 2500. I
Match that with the .seats already t
up and an additional couple of grand !
in the first hundred yards of the 220 |
and you have enough room for the j
kind oi crowd which will show up !
on May 6.
Remember the Big Meet last Sat
urday? The weather was excellent I
with little wind, though the sun was |
a little shy, the meet was a virtual I
toss-up and easily accessible to San !
Francisco fans. Yet the crowd barely !
touched 10,000. That means that the \
Indians will be lucky to get within j
2000 of that figure, which makes our !
8000 circus-style seats plenty j
ample.
* * *
BOTH THE U.S.C. and Stanford I
track aces are 100 per cent behind ]
the proposed scheme, as they well j
should be. The Indians figure they
can keep the score highly respect
able and have promised to garner 60 !
points if they are allowed to com- !
pete on their "home" track. After |
all, the stadium is as foreign to them :
as it will be to the Trojans.
Just about half of the Trojan aces j
flocked around the Stanford con- j
tingent at the recent Long Beach re- j
lays and humbly requested that the !
Injuns do all in their power to get j
the meet for Angell Field.
We have nothing personal in the
affair other than to make an attempt
to insure physical safety and the
best possible running and jumping
conditions for the psisonrd of both
outfits. There's no use kidding our
selves about the class of these U.S.C.
men, yet it certainly would be worth
the little effort it would take to get
the meet out where possible rec
ords and stand-out performances are ;
a dime a dozen.
And don't forget this very import
ant point: Stanlord will get at least j
55 and possibly GO points on Angell
Field. All they will get in the sta
dium will be busted ankles and pull
ed muscles, and, who can tell, may- j
be some more yellow jaundice.
