## Frosh Diamondmen Hang Up Gloves on Mediocre Season 
### ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor 
Treasuring few fan letters and |
still fewer press clippings, Coach i
Harry Shipkey's frosh diamondmen !
mumbled to the showers after last j
Saturday's thumping at the hands of ,
the Cal lads and hung up their i
gloves and tear-stained hankies on j
a definitely 50-50 '39 season.
Tabulations show that the .little |
Cards won nine out of the seventeen \
games for a grand percentage of j

about . 500, or in shorter words,
"not so hot." Three losses went to t
the Cal nine.
Despite indications of the games i
won and mostly lost, the frosh nine i
was comprised of three or four play
ers who stand more than a ghost of j
a chance in next year's race for var- ;
sity positions. Topping the list is j
pitcher Russ Smith, who, according i
to Coach Shipkey, "should develop ,
if properly trained." Freddy Meyer j
is another pitching prospect.
Lee Dewitt, the lad in the catch- i
ing spot all year, needs polish. His |
hitting is fair, but he still needs 1
much ball-handling experience. Top J
honors for infield men go to Cap
tain "Goodgame" Mulchay, who j
talks and incidentally plays a crack
erjack game at third.
In the outfield, it looks as if only j
Vucinich and Sturgeon have the
"class" to make the varsity. Both j
are strong hitters but Sturgeon has '
a habit of tripping himself with his
own speed. Red ribbons go to Bart
Sheela and Tom Boyle.
Harry Dyek, a swell warmup
pitcher, and John Pollock, Dick Ken
erick, John Shores, George Torassa, !
and Bob Butler also showed well.
