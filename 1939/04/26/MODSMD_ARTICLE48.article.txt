## 
### 
After upsetting the U.S.C. horse
men 10-5 last week-end in Los An
geles, Card polo men will be out to
cinch the series this Saturday when
they play a return match here on
the highway field at 2:30 o'clock.
While the Indians were the under
dogs in last week-end's game, having
only spjit the series with the Uni
versity of Arizona, which was de
cisively beaten by the Trojans, the
Farm four is conceded better than
an even chance to take the U.S.C.
horsemen in the coming match.
Besides last week's victory the
Cards will have the added advan
tage of playing their own mounts on
familiar ground in Saturday's game.
The Indian starting line-up will
probably consist of Walt Sullivan at
No. 1, Steve Downey No. 2, Jim
Fullerton (C) No. 3, and Bert Mc-
Clintock No. 4.
