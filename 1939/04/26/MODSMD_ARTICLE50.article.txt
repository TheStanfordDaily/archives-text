# Farm Golfers Travel South
## USC, UCLA on Card Schedule; Stanford Favored Team 
### 
With one win and one defeat on
the record, Stanford golfers will
leave tonight for Los Angeles to
meet U.S.C. on Friday and U.C.L.A.
on Saturday.
Although the Trojans were the
favored team at the beginning of the
season, they suffered defeaL in the
Pacific coast championships, south
ern division, at the hands of the In
dians and Cal. Since the Cards have
had the experience of an unfamiliar
course this year, they will not be
bothered by foreign links.
Coach Eddie Twiggs expects his
divotmen to take both contests. The
Bruins should go down because they
haven't much of a team, and the
Cards should take S.C. because they
defeated them once before this year
in tournament play. However, the
Trojans are rated with the best in
dividual players on the coast.
Players making the trip south will
be Warren Berl, Don Haslett, Jack
Showalter, Don Kennedy, Bud Fin
ger, and Dick Wright.
