# Frosh Recruits Swell Grid Roster; 3 Men Injured
## 
### 
Stocked up with additional rccruits for spring grid practice, Coach
Tiny Thornhill's Indian henchmen were scheduled to return (o low gear
this week after two weeks of work in high.
However, it'll only he for a week, for it is expected to take ahout that
long for the new moleskin candidates from freshman track and baschall

►to get into the swing of things. Un
til then Thornhill will drill the Reds
J in fundamentals with a light scrim
mage scheduled for tomorrow after
noon on the practice field.
INJURIES AdAIN
"Tiny" thought he had enough of
them last fall; but three very per
manent injuries—as far as this
' spring practice is concerned—crop
ped up last week.
Chief injury was that to Pat Now
| ell who, finally succeeding after
| several years attempting to get a
! special eye lens so that he could
play, was put out of commission with
I a broken right leg.
KNEE INJURIES
Rod Parker, who is scheduled to
! see loads of action behind Norm
Standlee next fall at fullback, was
! put on crutches for perhaps the rest
i of the spring season with a twisted
knee. Gerry Sparling, a sparkling
| and likely-looking left halfback
j candidate, is also on the shelf with a
, knee injury.
The switching of Bob Crane from
j guard to quarterback still appeared
!to be an outstanding move on
i Thornhill's part in strengthening
| that department. Two other fresh-
I men. Dave Patterson at guard and
i Colin McClintock at center, have
, held part of the spotlight in scrim
-1 mages with their aggressive play and
j mastering of fundamentals.
