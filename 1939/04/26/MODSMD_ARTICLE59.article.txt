TANFORD'S Union, particularly in so far
concerned, enjoys a monopoly.
Stanford pays for that monopoly, even though
the Farm doesn't realize it.
Eggs, in Palo Alto, retail at 28 cents a
dozen. At the Cellar, unwary customers buy
two eggs (any style, with toast) for 25 cents.
That the difference between hen fruit au natu
rel and cooked eggs with toast is at least dis
cernible, nobody will deny. But —a little fire
and singed sandwich bread notwithstanding—
is that difference equal to 11.33 cents' worth
per egg?
This is only one example of what Stanford
runs into when it decides to eat out, yet hasn t
the time or the car to go off-campus.
The sins of the Union in its two public eating
places are not individually great — together,
however, they add up to a sizeable total.
For 10 cents a small glass, Stanford can't
even buy fresh orange juice on campus—only
bottled.
Last year, according to figures in the Report
of the Students' Organizations Fund, the Cel
lar did approximately $94,500 worth of busi
ness; the dining room business exceeded
$98,000.
Total income of the entire Union from all its
sources, including Old Dormitory rents, office
and shop space rentals, sales, and interest on
savings, equaled $329,101. General and oper
ating expenses totaled $298,906.
A net profit of $30,906.73.
It is apparent, then, that Stanford is making
a sizeable contribution to Union operation.
What does it receive in return?
High - priced eggs, no fresh orange juice,
higher-priced meals than any popular place in
Palo Alto, except for the one isolated instance
of the Dividend Dinner, where quantity, not
excellence of cuisine, prevails.
For meals which can compare to the latter,
downtown eaters may usually have choices of
entrees, desserts; certainly they receive more
delicious food.
For months, and on an average of close to
four times a week, identically the same gravy—
that is, brewed from the same formula—has
appeared on every kind of meat the Cellar has
served for dinner, be it beef, pork, veal, or even
little pig sausages. What's more, food, as often
as not, is held over in warming ovens.
For Stanford's 50 cents, it can do much better
downtown.
Stanford knows it; those who can, eat else
where. Those who are forced by circumstances
to use the local concessions for the most part
accept their fate with a hopeless shrug.
It appears almost that the Union has enjoyed
its monopoly to the extreme. Its expenses for
quality food may be higher than downtown
restaurants, but savings on student and other
cheap labor should more than make up that
difference, and operating on a $182,000 scale
certainly entitles them to a substantial whole
sale price reduction.
It is possible to conceive of the Cellar turning
out delicious meals—remote as the possibility
may seem now.
It is time, moreover, that that conception be
comes a reality.
That the Union pay a little less attention to
paying off the Memorial Hall debt, sink a little
more of its $30,000 into keeping its patrons
happy.
