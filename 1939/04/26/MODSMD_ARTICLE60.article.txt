# Pained—and Not Pleased
## 
### 
THERE is only one thing less pleasant than
taking a mid-quarter this morning—and that
is taking two mid-quarters. It was to avoid this
evil and its consequent lowering of grade aver
ages that the School of Social Sciences an
nounced a set schedule of examinations at the
close of winter quarter.

Not only did the departments of economics,
history, philosophy, political science, psychol
ogy, and the divisions of sociology and jour
nalism denounce the doubling-up of hour exes,
but they advocated that all other schools of
the University adopt this plan:
8 o'clock examinations —Tuesday
9 o'clock examinations —Monday or Friday
10 o'clock examinations —Wednesday
11 o'clock examinations —Thursday
The optional hour was provided for 9 o'clocks
because some of them hold no class on Mon
days, others, on Fridays. Apparently the sys
tem is fool-proof.
In the light of these facts it is disappointing
to learn that two of the best-liked professors
in the School of Social Sciences have an
nounced mid-quarters for next Wednesday,
smack in the midst of the Convalescent Home
Drive. The 10 o'clock econ man is well within
his rights, but the 9 o'clock psych professor is
not playing cricket. Rumor has it that these
are not the only examinations that have been
irregularly scheduled.
From high in their ivory towers the Social
Science heads are proclaiming the glory of
systematized mid-quarters. If they look below
them, they may find that termites are boring
from within.—L. L.
