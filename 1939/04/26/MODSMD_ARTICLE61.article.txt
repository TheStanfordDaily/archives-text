### JOHN COBBS 
ALI KIMBALL AND THE 41 THIEVES
"IF WE can't take your money away honestly, we'll
do it dishonestly." This was the warning Sopho
more President Park Kimball issued to the campus
when he announced plans for the Soph Carnival; in it
1 find hope for a new era in the great Stanford shake
down racket.
Ordinarily a statement like that would frighten me.
The various legal methods of extortion are already so
efficient that it is alarming to think what criminal tac
tics would do. But. in this case there is nothing to worry
about; the only way the Sophomores can get any more
revenue out of us is by selling us into slavery, and the
Administration would stop that because of unfavor
able publicity. The significant thing about Kimball's
announcement is that it represents a new spirit among
drive sponsors.

In the past Stanford drive leaders have been accus
tomed to act as though they were doing the students a
personal favor when they asked them to contribute.
The idea seems to be that we should fight for the
privilege of writing checks, that we should be humbly
grateful for the opportunity to buy salvation for our
souls.
No one doubts that most of our drives have noble
aims and holy principles. But the conviction has been
growing on us that a campaign for funds is not a God
sent opportunity to give our better natures a workout.
We resent the way drive leaders rob us of the feeling
of righteousness that should follow a contribution.

we find it hard to follow the logic of Axe
Society when it explains that it does us a favor
by cancelling our regular dinners so that we will be
forced to attend a barbecue. And we are pained by
the realistic but tactless explanation of one of the boat
house campaigners: "You might as well cough up now,
or they'll pry you loose from twice as much later on."
Philanthropy goes stale when it is put on an "or else"
basis.
We cannot help feeling that smiles from Roble
freshmen, charming though they are, should not be
appraised at ten cents apiece, which is the tag day
valuation. And somehow the salvation of our immortal
souls seems rather expensive after a Labor Day after
noon among the stinkweeds and poison ivy.

We don't mind contributing, but we want to get
proper credit for it. We want it clearly understood that
we are being plenty damn gracious about it all.
And so it is pleasing to hear the Sophomores an
nounce that thov are out to collect money, not to save
our souls. Thieves are always more interesting than
missionaries.
