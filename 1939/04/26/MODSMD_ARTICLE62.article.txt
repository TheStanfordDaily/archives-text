WHAT YOU DO
They say that this quarter is the busiest spring quar
ter the Farm has ever known. I will not dispute with
them. They have the facts.
But for the last two days it has been damn full.
That is probably a logical result from so many activi
ties. Everyone is of! someplace busy with a committee.
No one can get away from the guiding hands of the
committee chairman for whom he is working, and bat
around by himself and do stupid things and create
column material.
At a time like this, there are only two things to do.
You either start a liquor campaign, or you take a
crack at the Zetcs.
Look back at the files. It has happened year after
year.
To hell with liquor. To hell with the Zetes.

WOLF
At the last Stanford-Cal frosh jamboree, the fresh
men had a dance at Encina.
Two of the frosh, fourth floor habitants, went to
their rooms about an hour after the dance started.
They got as far as the fourth floor, that is, when they
heard a terrific racket down at the end of the hall.
They investigated. Of course they investigated.
Anyone who lives, will live, or has lived in Encina
would investigate.
They found a guy, a big guy all dressed up in his
pretty clothes, trapped in a phone booth. The knob
was off the door; furniture was piled around keeping
him in. He was caught.
I am from Cal, he bellowed. Get, me out of here,
he shrieked. Open that damn door.
The frosh unpiled the furniture and opened fhe
door. Bellowing like a tiger (the trouble with tigers
is that they bellow too much), he charged downstairs
clumpity-clump with the two frosh right behind
clum pity-clump.
Downstairs in the lobby he found his girl. She was
easy to find. She was a queen. She was surrounded by
Stanford frosh.
That, they say, is the end of the story. He simply
reclaimed his girl, and that was all.
But what I want to know is who got him up in
that booth and how they did it.
And why he didn't take a poke at someone. In
eluding the beautiful girl who was the queen of the
dance.
