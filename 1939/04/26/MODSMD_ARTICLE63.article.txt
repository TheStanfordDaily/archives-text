## 500 Books, $200 Turnover Marks First 4 Weeks 
### WILSON CANNON 
One little room, five feet wide j
and fifteen feet deep.
One lace curtain on the window.
One rickety set of bookshelves,
but therein lies the tale. Overflow- I
ing from the shelves, piled knee-deep ;
on the floor, and sprawling over the ;
one chair are books, books, books— j
nearly 500 of them.
An ambitious undertaking in a
pint-sized location — and you have
the Stanford Co-operative Book
store, now an infant of a mere four j
weeks growth.

Brain-child of the A.S.U., Farm !
style, the co-op bookstore is far j
from being an entirely new idea. In- j
corporated in student-handled activ- |
ities in many universities, it first
saw light on the Stanford campus in
the form of an A.S.U. motion last
fall quarter which empowered re
search on the subject.
Interested students found the idea
practical, studied similar co-opera
tives then in full swing. With ap
proval of Dr. Wilbur and the Uni- !
versity Bookstore tucked away, it J
quietly opened for business one I
month ago, accomplished a turnover 1
of nearly $200 in the first two weeks. |
Campus sororities donated the ini
tial stock of books. Prominent!
among these was one hymn book j
from the Memorial Chapel (since j
returned), and a variety of offer- j
ings from the Palo Alto Library —!
complete with cards.
ECON—I9OI
Included on the shelves — but not |
hopefully — are a complete set of j
econ books, vintage 1901. Language j
texts are the most numerous of the
up-to-date books, while math and |
engineering texts are at a premium, j
Chief obstacle the tiny room has j
to overcome is the difficulty in ob- |
taining enough volumes to fill it to i
overflowing. Demand can handle {
them—when the books come in.
The shelves are rickety—but they '
were tacked and taped together by i
volunteer inexperts.
It's the sprit that counts.
