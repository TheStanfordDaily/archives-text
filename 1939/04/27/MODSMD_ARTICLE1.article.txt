### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
r door of The Daily phone booth
flew open about 8:15 last night
and the frosh editor came out, yell
ing, "War Declared." No other two
words in the English language could
have produced an effect even ap
proaching the shrill voices of girls
in the Shack, the momentary silence
of the boys. Somebody screamed,
"Turn on the radio!" Another voice
rose above the others, "It can't Ix?
true!" That's America today for you.
War jitters.
But what can be expected, what
with England's umbrella man fran
tically urging Parliamentary ap
proval of conscription of 310,000 men
because "No one can pretend that
this is peacetime." On our own side
of the big pond President Roosevelt
is trying to speed America's billion
dollar emergency national defense
program to completion. As long as
desperate arming keeps up, as long
as Hitler continues to make passes
at Europe's map, just so long will
dammed-up hysteria keep oozing
even, as happened last night, over a
baseless prank.
* »lt iji
Whatever he may feel at these
attempts at arming, Hitler is not
lipping his hand or showing any
emotion, save scorn. Der Fuehrer
characterized the British plan as
a "panicky decision," casually gave
the order to add 1,750,00 brown
shirt storm troopers to the regu
lar German army. Tit for tat. This
move gives the Reich about
500,000 trained army men.
In addition Hitler holds in reserve
approximately 230,000 expertly
trained and equipped men of his
touted Blackshirts commanded by
Heinrich Himmler of the Nazi Se
cret police. This organization to
gether with the motor, flying, and
marine corps, were all in the brown
shirt category before the purge of
June 29, 1934, when Ernst Roehm,
creator of this "second army," was
slain.

tiously predicted that the Rome-
Berlin axis would be ' compelled to
adopt new military measures" in or
der to counterbalance Great Britain's
conscription decision. To the other
extreme from this indefinite, "sit
tight" pronunciamento, some of the
ultra, ultra Fascists maintained that
Britain's boys jumping into khaki
would have the effect of converting
the Anti-Comintern Pact—formed by
Italy, Germany and Japan, adhered
to by Hungary and Spain — into a
powerful document by binding its
members in a military alliance.
Actually there is nothing to in
dicate what form the predicted
Italo-Gcrman military measures
may lake. Some of those fabled
"impartial observers," whose num
ber, at a time like this is legion,
believe a detailed plan for coping
with the alleged "encirclemcnt" by
Western Powers was drafted at
Innsbruck recently at a German-
Italo pow-wow.

tiny Belgium, whose reason
has been tempered by years of
acting the European wedge, saw her
parliament vote yesterday to build
the war machine demanded by the
national interests." Evidently, the
Belgian government, recalling the
trampling which the country under
went in 1914, has looked ahead to a
possible, more drastic encore, and
decided not to be caught napping.

And so, another day, another
army. Tomorrow Hitler will let go
on President Roosevelt and his now
famed note when he speaks before
the Reichstag. There's no telling
what will come out of that. Let's
just hope the next, time we hear
"War Declared" we will be able to
laugh it off as a relieved bunch of
kids did in the Shack last night.
