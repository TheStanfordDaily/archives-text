# Frenzied Frosh Edit Number 42
## 
### 
Routine turmoil of publishing
The Daily was supplanted last
night by frenzied chaos in the
Shack. The frosh staff put out
this edition, No. 42 of the vol
ume, under its own steam, of
which there was no lack.
Repeated threats by the frosh
as to what would happen if a
member of the old guard so
much as opened the door were
evidently not seriously enough
considered, for a group of three
who parked outside and uncer
emoniously started to yell: 'To
hell with '42!" were swiftly and
efficiently doused by a re
sourceful cup brigade.
Frosh theme song, intoned
lustily at times, weakly at oth
ers, not at all by the editor and
night editor, was "We Get
Along without You Very Well!"
Speculation as Co the fitness of
this theme was futile last night
while type was still molten, but
today it's all down in black and
white. How'd we do?
