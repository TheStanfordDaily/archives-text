Perpetuating the Pacific Coast Student Speech Congresses initialed by
the University of California and San Jose State College, Stanford Univer

Saturday, April 28 and 29.
Early Ibis quarter when the proposal was advanced that Stanford should
host this year's group, I)r. Inland T. Chapin, varsity debate coach, held

►two mock Congresses with the entire
J squad participating. Their success
i and worth was recognized and the

General aid and advice organiza
tion will be supplied by Bob Curtiss

According to Miss Glasman and
Curtiss, the Stanford Congress will
be patterned after the Washington
gathering, will be carried out on a
smaller scale. The local group will
have iour specialized committees on
I Rearmament, Pan Americanism,
Neutrality, and International Co
operation.
While back cast, the Stanford
delegates stayed at the Mayflower
Hotel and were immediately assimi

j politics." They were taken on tours
jof Arlington and Mt. Vernon and
I viviited the Senate and House while
they were in session. Accoixling to

Curtiss, her pictures graced Capitol
City and other front pages for quite
some time. The young lady herself
comments that since the trip she has
received several cards reading:
