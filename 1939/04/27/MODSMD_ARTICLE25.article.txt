## 
### 
A group of Robleites gathered in
the "Y" Wednesday afternoon to
talk over problems facing next, year's
sophomore class, especially that of
unity. A sophomore from the Row,
Ruth Reynolds, and one from a hall,
Mary June Montgomery, with Kay
Rogers led the discussion.
When separation from freshman
friends came up as the first problem,
Ruth Reynolds, Dec Gee, slated thai
on the Row duties inside the house
make contact outside difficult, but
that a definite effort must be made
to prevent separation. Free discus
sion from the floor was allowed and
among the solutions offered was that
of exchange dinners between the
girls in house and Row every two
weeks.
Kay Rogers announced that a
sophomore discussion group under
the "Y" has been planned for next
year. Pat Adams, new secretary of
the sophomore class, suggested hav
ing next year's freshman girls eat at
other living groups some evening
and the sophomores go to Roblc for
a homecoming dinner.
Ruth Reynolds also expressed tin
opinion that the sophomores' slump
in academic work is due to their
being overly involved in activities,
the lack of their former supervision,
and, for some, the increased social
privileges. The group expressed the
feeling that discrimination between
activities is necessary although ac
tivity in living groups is important
and a ladder to campus activities.
