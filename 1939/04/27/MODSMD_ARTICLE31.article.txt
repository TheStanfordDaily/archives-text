# Wilder's 'Our Town' Retains Punch, Vigor Sans Scenery
## 
### HARVA SPRAGER 
The play's the thing—an old say
ing that is aptly and forcefully
proven in the production of "Our
Town," the 1938 Pulitzer prize-win
ning play by Thornton Wilder. For
this play is produced entirely with
out the use of scenery or proper
ties, but it is so powerful that by
the end of the first act, the uncon
ventional style of production is for
gotten. Scenery would only have
detracted from the action.
The scene is laid in Grovei''s
Corners, N.H., which could easily
be any town in the United States.
The play tells of the life and love of
Emily Webb and George Gibbs, end
ing with the death of Emily. The
power and force of the play lies in
the simplicity and strength of the
writing and story.
WIT SEASONED
The main character is Frank
Craven who, as the stage manager,
plays the part of a homey philoso
pher, directing the audience as well
as the cast with wit and an extraor
dinary degree of understanding. He
seasons his part with typically small
town bits of business, such as check
ing his watch with the train whistle.
His characterization is the highlight
of the play.

J The most charming scene of the
' play takes place in the drug store
between Emily played by Martha
Scott, and George, Thomas Coley.
! In it the young hero goes to the
great expense of buying Emily an
ice cream soda, and the emotions
of adolescent love triumph over
; the shyness of the two young people
! as they declare the nature of their
feelings for each other.
DEATH IS LIFE
But the graveyard scene is the
best. In this, Wilder expresses his
conception of life and death in a
! most effective and beautiful manner.
| He tries to make the audience be
; lieve that death is just another
! phase of life, the only difference be
-1 ing that a dead person is "free for
he no longer lives inside a box."
An exceptional piece of acting was
turned in by Milton Parsons as the
drunken church organist. The
scenes in which he directs the choir
and staggers down the street in a
! drunken stupor are the outstanding
bits of the evening.
"Our Town" is a gripping power
ful story of "plain folk" with acting
that does not take a back seat to
I the excellence of the play.

J The most charming scene of the
' play takes place in the drug store
between Emily played by Martha
Scott, and George, Thomas Coley.
! In it the young hero goes to the
great expense of buying Emily an
ice cream soda, and the emotions
of adolescent love triumph over
; the shyness of the two young people
! as they declare the nature of their
feelings for each other.
DEATH IS LIFE
But the graveyard scene is the
best. In this, Wilder expresses his
conception of life and death in a
! most effective and beautiful manner.
| He tries to make the audience be
; lieve that death is just another
! phase of life, the only difference be
-1 ing that a dead person is "free for
he no longer lives inside a box."
An exceptional piece of acting was
turned in by Milton Parsons as the
drunken church organist. The
scenes in which he directs the choir
and staggers down the street in a
! drunken stupor are the outstanding
bits of the evening.
"Our Town" is a gripping power
ful story of "plain folk" with acting
that does not take a back seat to
I the excellence of the play.
The play's the thing—an old say
ing that is aptly and forcefully
proven in the production of "Our
Town," the 1938 Pulitzer prize-win
ning play by Thornton Wilder. For
this play is produced entirely with
out the use of scenery or proper
ties, but it is so powerful that by
the end of the first act, the uncon
ventional style of production is for
gotten. Scenery would only have
detracted from the action.
The scene is laid in Grovei''s
Corners, N.H., which could easily
be any town in the United States.
The play tells of the life and love of
Emily Webb and George Gibbs, end
ing with the death of Emily. The
power and force of the play lies in
the simplicity and strength of the
writing and story.
WIT SEASONED
The main character is Frank
Craven who, as the stage manager,
plays the part of a homey philoso
pher, directing the audience as well
as the cast with wit and an extraor
dinary degree of understanding. He
seasons his part with typically small
town bits of business, such as check
ing his watch with the train whistle.
His characterization is the highlight
of the play.
