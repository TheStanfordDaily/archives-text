SAN FRANCISCO, April 26 (UP).
â€”Seventy-four-year-old Mrs. Flora
Casse halted probate of her own es
tate in Superior Court today just as
the court was about to award final
administration papers to her daugh
ter. Mrs. Marion Bowen.
"I just heard yesterday that I
was 'dead'," Mrs. Casse, small and
dressed in black, said as she hustled
into court. "I came here to do some
thing about it. I'm very much alive."
The probate had been based on re
ports Mrs. Casse died in Cairo,
Egypt, eight years ago.

The Bureau of Home Economics
says the farm families that net $600
a year j*et ahead financially.
