"Campus Cavalcade." a pageant
written by Dorothy Nichols, will be
the highlight of the annual spring
festival to be given by the Stanford
Mothers' Club May 18 at 2:30 o'clock
in the Lawrence Frost Amphithe
ater.
Beginning with the coming of the
Spanish and continuing down
through scenes of modern student
life, the pageant, according to Mrs.
Ik L. Cody, president of the club,
will include an episode of the lavish
entertainment and hasty departure
of the Frenchman, Peter Coutts,
whose estate was part of the present
university grounds.
In the morning a tour of the cam
pus has been arranged which will
include visits to the Memorial
Church. Art Gallery, Art Museum,
and three old houses, formerly part
of Coutts' estate. All will be open
to the visitors without charge.
The temporary dwelling of the
Frenchman, now the residence of
Professor Eliot Black welder, will be
open to visitors. This was known as
the Eseondite Cottage, so called by
the David Starr Jordans, who oc
cupied it when Dr. Jordan first
came to Stanford as President of
the University. The other two hous
es to be visited will be the present
Professor Bernard Peyton home,
formerly the estate's office building
and a Spanish adobe made from the
barns.
"Last year's festival raised $2000 for
the Mothers' Club benefit fund that
maintains student rest homes and
provides emergency aid," explained
Mrs. Cody. "Tickets for the pageant
will be $1, and may be obtained at
the A.S.S.U. office or by calling Mrs.
Elsa Gardiner."
