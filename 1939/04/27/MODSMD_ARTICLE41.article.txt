### CHUCK SMITH 
If the B.A.C. wore to formally re
ply to vacationing Arch Jenkins'
plea for making Ant*ell Field the
site for the coming Trojan track
meet, it would probably run some
thing like this:
Dear Campaigning Sports Editor:
Haven't you heard some place
before, either in an econ class or
while listening to your house
manager rant about the lack of
lucre, that good football teams
equal ducats, that ducats equal
dollars, and most important, that
dollars equal improvements in
other sports. Or vice versa all
along the line.
Respectfully submitted,
15. A. C.
There's a padlock on the BA.C.
pur.se strings for the simple reason
that there is little money behind
those strings. And the U.S.C. meet
offers a good opportunity for track
to pay for itself this year.
Not only would the B.A.C. have to
shell out to secui'e added bleachers,
but also they would risk having to
turn away track fans if their facili
ties were not large enough. Also,
the coming contest with those phe
nomenal leapers and lopers from
down south promises to be a mighty
line drawing card.
It's perfectly true that the wind
whistles down the straightaway
in the stadium, that the start of
the 220. 440, 880, and low hurdles
are concealed from view, that the
cinder path is narrow and has lost
some of its original spring.
But the wind wasn't considered
too strong for the Olympic tryoutees
back in the summer of 1932. There
have been many fine performances
on both track and field accomplished
in those ruts and high winds of the
stadium. Who knows? With a little
attention to the cinder path, a calm
day, and such competition as those
Trojan flyers, Willis, Anderson, and
Jordan, Dink's boy, Clyde Jeffrey,
might do some record - breaking
watch stopping.
Another added attraction of
fered bv the stadium is the privi
lege of rabid fans to journey
around the foot of the stadium in
order to he at the finish of first
the 440, then across the field for
the century and high hurdles',
hack again for the 880. across for
the 220. etc.
Stanford has held meets with Cal
and U.S.C., the now dead and de
parted California Intercollegiates,
P.A. invitational meets, and Olympic
tryouts in the stadium for the past
17 years and there is no particular
reason for any change this year.
The bleachers on Angell Field are
bound to come some day. Everyone
wants to see them there for this is
a truly wonderful track. It's just
that the time isn't ripe for such
construction and that the dual meet
with the Trojans is too big to hold
on the smaller field.
Gosh, what is this, mutiny on
the sports staff? And after all the
nice things Boss Jenkins has done
for me! Well, he'll get the last
word anyhow.

to pay for itself this year.
Not only would the B.A.C. have to
shell out to secui'e added bleachers,
but also they would risk having to
turn away track fans if their facili
ties were not large enough. Also,
the coming contest with those phe
nomenal leapers and lopers from
down south promises to be a mighty
line drawing card.
It's perfectly true that the wind
whistles down the straightaway
in the stadium, that the start of
the 220. 440, 880, and low hurdles
are concealed from view, that the
cinder path is narrow and has lost
some of its original spring.
But the wind wasn't considered
too strong for the Olympic tryoutees
back in the summer of 1932. There
have been many fine performances
on both track and field accomplished
in those ruts and high winds of the
stadium. Who knows? With a little
attention to the cinder path, a calm
day, and such competition as those
Trojan flyers, Willis, Anderson, and
Jordan, Dink's boy, Clyde Jeffrey,
might do some record - breaking
watch stopping.
Another added attraction of
fered bv the stadium is the privi
lege of rabid fans to journey
around the foot of the stadium in
order to he at the finish of first
the 440, then across the field for
the century and high hurdles',
hack again for the 880. across for
the 220. etc.
Stanford has held meets with Cal
and U.S.C., the now dead and de
parted California Intercollegiates,
P.A. invitational meets, and Olympic
tryouts in the stadium for the past
17 years and there is no particular
reason for any change this year.
The bleachers on Angell Field are
bound to come some day. Everyone
wants to see them there for this is
a truly wonderful track. It's just
that the time isn't ripe for such
construction and that the dual meet
with the Trojans is too big to hold
on the smaller field.
Gosh, what is this, mutiny on
the sports staff? And after all the
nice things Boss Jenkins has done
for me! Well, he'll get the last
word anyhow.
If the B.A.C. wore to formally re
ply to vacationing Arch Jenkins'
plea for making Ant*ell Field the
site for the coming Trojan track
meet, it would probably run some
thing like this:
