# Card Cindermen Ease Up; Jeffrey Runs 9.6 Hundred
## 
### 
Marked by the absence of hurdler Bill Hawkins and the mediocrity of
their performances. Dink Templeton's cindcrmen held their weekly twi
light meet. "Hawk" is in the rest home with an attack of flu that he fell as
far back as the Cal meet, but he is hoping to be out and ready to perform
in the P.A. invitational on Saturday.
Mush Girard opened activities with a fairly good mile. Running almost
entirely by himself, Girard coasted in, stopping the watches at 4:1!).5,

i Little Les Johnson took listless Craig#
I Williamson in a 49.7 quarter. Clyde i
j Jeffrey was the only Card performer
j who flashed his regular form. Break
ing from his holes with much im- j
proved starts, Clyde negotiated a 9.6
hundred and a 21.3 furlong.
i Les Steers of San Mateo brought
; the crowd of about 100 to their feet
i with a leap of 6 ft. 3 in. in the high :
kjurnp. Jim Lincoln, Indian jumper,
' cleared only 6 ft. 1 in. and Bill Rum
j bly, another Card, surprised his i
! coach by clearing this same height
| on his fourth and unoflicial try.
Bill Wohle hit 51 ft. 4 in. in the
| shot while Stan Anderson relaxed
I live inches behind Bill. Pete Zagar j
caught hold of one toss in the discus !
i that hit 161 and called it a day. Bill
j Braheny was satisfied with only 182
J feet in the javelin.
Girard came back to ramble the 1
j half-mile in 1:56.6 with neither
Paul Moore nor Barney Ferguson
breaking 2 minutes. Bob Kenyon
showed signs of convalescence by
vaulting 11 ft. 6 in. to tie with Walt
McKenzie.
One of the better times turned in
yesterday was done by Johnny Em
i manuel. who circled the eight laps
|of the two mile in 0:39. The Cards
undoubtedly deserved a rest after ;
the intensive work of the week pre- j
vious to the California encounter. i
Potatoes too "sleepy" to sprout are '
given a whiff of ethylene chlorhyd- |
rin and they begin to show signs of
awakening almost immediately, farm
experts say. |
