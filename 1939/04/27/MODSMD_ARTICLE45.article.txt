# Cardinal Nine Trips Trojans
## Gaels Lead League After Trojan Defeat 
### 
The Card varsity baseballers made
it three wins in a row yesterday,
pounding out a decisive 8-6 win over
the University of Southern Califor
nia in Los Angeles to tumble the
once mighty Trojans from the league
lead.
The victory gave the Indian nine
a two-to-one margin over Sam
Barry's men of Troy in the three
game series between the two teams
this season. It dropped the U.S.C.
nine a full game behind the St.
Mary's Gaels in the California In
tercollegiate Baseball Association's
standings.
The Indians nicked Bob Winslow,
Southern California pitcher, for 13
solid hits. The losers made 11 hits.
Monty Pfyl, Card second-sacker, had
a perfect day at the plate with 5 base
hits in as many times at bat.
The Farm nine, redeeming them
selves after dropping the Cal series
in a 2-1 thriller Saturday, have
mopped up all opposition on their
trip to the southland.
