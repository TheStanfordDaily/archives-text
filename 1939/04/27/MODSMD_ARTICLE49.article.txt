# Frosh Stars Shine in Spring Practice
## 
### 
Frosh edition: hence a football story that should swell the scrap books
of those grunters who were freshman gridiron heroes last autumn and
who, from the looks of things, are worming their bulk into several of
those bloody varsity positions.
Signal drill last night found Tiny's fifty potential gridiron giants split
into four squads. Last year's varsity heavies, with the exception of frosh

lviconntock at the center spot, he Id 4
the limelight on the first squad. In I
the second squad, however, it was '
Frank Alberts, John Sturgeon, Dave
Patterson, Bob Crane, and Milt
Vucinich who were doing the heavy 1
work.
While on the subject, this Milt
Vucinich is good. He catches most
passes well, runs as low as a May- !
tag washing machine, and packs
about as much punch. The varsity |
could use him, but lie will pick up i
a great deal of game experience j
during a year of freshman football.
Tiny had Doug Stahle, Fred
Meyer, Bert Talcott, Yank Levin, |
and Pete Kmetovic spotted in the
third squad. It's a little early to say, i
but general say-so has it that Fred :
Meyers and Pete Kmetovic are the
two lads on this squad that have J
the best chances of seeing service, i
In the fourth pick-up team, Winkic ;
Jones, Jim Murphy, Bob Herringer,
and Art Rasmussen brought up the I
tag end for the Encina footballers. >
Our best bet in Ihis bunch is Winkie
Jones who will probably be moving
into faster circles within the next
week or so. t

scalping; it was practiced by the an
