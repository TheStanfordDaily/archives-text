# We Can Do Without You
## 
### 
ONE of the Stanford traditions that has not
yet gone by the boards is that every year
during spring guarter the regular Daily staff
runs out and leaves the frosh staff members to
see that the campus gets a Daily the next morn
ing.
Although our parting instruction from the
temporarily ousted old fogies was to have a
good time, we have endeavored to better their
usual output. So if the guality and clearness of
Vol. 95, No. 42, makes you wish for the same
kind of a Daily every day, we ask you to bear
with the regular staff for another year or two.
Then we will guarantee you the kind of Daily
you want and like.
Without a doubt, the frosh edition is the
height of the Daily cub reporter's achievement.
The Shack is their domain for the day (and
only half the night if they are lucky). But along
with the rule of the Shack come also the worries
of the Shack: the night editor wrangling with
Batman; the frosh managing editor fighting off
upper-class publicity hounds who think the
front page should be all theirs, and pleading
with the hard-hearted, itchy-palmed frosh busi
ness staff not to put in so many ads—if they
had their way the Stanford Daily would become
a shopping news, and the editor beating his
head on the wall trying to figure out what he
is going to use to fill up fifteen inches of edit
column.
The editor also starts to worry some more
after he reads the scholarly and high-sounding
pieces written by those who have been in the
same shoes as he several years ago. But he
just keeps pecking away at the typewriter in
his private office for the day, hoping that when
he comes down from his throne tomorrow
Sheldon & Press, Inc., won't be too severe in
their criticism.
With that he ends his rambling and decides
that he had better get down to work and put
something in this column which will have some
value.
