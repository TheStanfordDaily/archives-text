THAT the glamour of movie actresses has
been overplayed is certainly debatable, but
that these actresses, wherever they may go,
are a very potent factor in drawing crowds is
a known axiom in any man's business.
These actresses now advertise everything
from spark plugs to breakfast foods, and do a
good job of it.
For years Stanford has been attracting stu
dents to the biggest dances on the campus by
dangling before these students the prospect of
being able to dance to the music of "the biggest
name band of the guarter." These name bands
bring their best vocalists, both male and fe
male, to whom everyone has listened on the
radio.
To the immature mind of a freshman reporter,
there seems no great difference between pre
senting a name band with a prominent female
vocalist and presenting a not-so-prominent band
and a Hollywood actress at the forthcoming
Masgue Ball.
Yet the deal worked out by Rovena Conn and
Dick Lyon, co-chairmen for the Ball, to have as
guest star the ravishing Priscilla Lane was
frowned upon, in fact prohibited. It was agreed
that Miss Lane would prove a great drawing
card for the Masgue Ball, and the idea had al
most unanimous approval.
But Stanford was kept from being able to
see Miss Lane in person, because it might set
a precedent.
