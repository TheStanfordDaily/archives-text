LITTLE WALDO RIDES AGAIN
I ITTLE Waldo made his appearance last quarter. He
was in an editorial of The Daily. The editorial
was witty, a bit silly, and it related a tale about a
freshman reporter, Little Waldo.
To be more explicit. Little Waldo covered the
chlorine story. The accident wasn't very serious, but
it was significant. At least to Little Waldo it was sig
nificant. Maybe he had been reading too many stories
about crusading newspapermen. Possibly the chem
lab assistants exaggerated to Little Waldo the need
for new accident prevention. Or, Little Waldo didn't
like the thought of some of those friendly assistants
breathing in the nasty ole gases or being burned by
acids. Whatever his motive, Waldo toured the Chem
Building, asking everybody what was needed to make
the building safe, poking in dark corners for danger
ous conditions. When finished, he had a mass of in
formation. New gas masks were needed, the fire ex
tinguishers were antiquated, there was a shortage of
first aid kits, the gas cylinders were in poor shape,
and new air suction hoods were needed.
Pencil behind ear, notes tightly grasped in hand,
Waldo dashed to the Shack. He entered Ihe editor's
office without a knock, for this was a scoop. But excited,
thrilled Little Waldo received a terrific shock. The edi
tor hadn't jumped up and shouted "Hold everything,
break up the front page." The editor merely said, "I
don't think we can do anything about it."
Little Waldo left. He was hurt, angry. What's the
matter with those guys? Where's their backbone?

No, this talc is not finished. You see, the writer of
this column happens to be Little Waldo. So, when the
regular editors announced the staff of the frosh edi
tion, Little Waldo could hardly suppress his delight.
At last, his big chance had arrived. He'd show 'em!
He'd show 'em that not everybody at Stanford was
smug. He'd crusade in Bull Session for new chem
equipment. He'd show the real power of the press.

r I I HE day before the frosh edition Little Waldo walked
to the Chem Building—he didn't dash any more,
for he was learning to be smooth. Nevertheless, he
was excited, his buck-teeth clinched together with de
termination, his trusty Ticonderoga ready for action.
He was going to comb the building for additional facts
and verify those he already had. He entered Room 17,
where the original chlorine accident had occurred.
A shiny, red tube with handles immediately at
tracts his eye. One of the chemists tells him it's a new,
very effective fire extinguisher that was put in a few
weeks after the chlorine explosion and that all the
labs are equipped with them. Little Waldo feels faint.
His spirit drops like the stock market after a Hitler
speech. But just for a moment only; inspiration strikes
him. Wait a minute, he says, they can't steal my thun
der with, just these things. How about those blasted
old gas cylindei's that have caused most of the trouble?
A test tube juggler grins at Waldo and informs him
ihat new ones are also in use.
Waldo, more than a little worried about what he is
going to write about, forgets his smoothness and dashes
upstairs. Breathing heavily from taking two steps at
a time, Little Waldo hopefully asks the organic chem
professor if there isn't dire need for another shower
in his lab to be used in case students' clothes catch on
fire? Yes, there is a need for one more but it has al
ready been ordered, Waldo is told. With the hopeful
gleam in his innocent eyes fast fading, Waldo tries
again. How about new gas masks, Professor. There's
a desperate need for them, isn't there? Again, he is
thwarted. Waldo is informed that as soon as a suitable
mask is found, new ones will be procured. The pro
fessor deals a final blow as he asks Waldo not to say
anything about the air suction floods. The hood situa
tion will probably be remedied in the near future.

Deep in dispair, Little Waldo toddles back to En
cina. Entering the lobby, he doesn't even try to dodge
the water bags and flying shrapnel. He is lost in
thought. Maybe the editor wasn't so wrong, Waldo
admits. Maybe Stanford has something with its smug
ness. What good would have been done if the editor
had gone off on a tangent about the chem dangers?
The results were accomplished without all the mess.
Ah, well. Little Waldo sighs, maybe I had better read
my Western Civ more and read less of "Scoop Bright,
Star Reporter."
