I seem to remember the hack who usually writes
this column mentioning something about "Pop-eyed"
Pi Phis and "I'm-on-a-Committee" Tri Dclts. This
heart-warming tale has much of the same smell—
He was a Phi Delt—and the Sports Editor of the
last volume of The Daily (no names mentioned). Pie
was a lover of pat expressions.
She was a Kappa—you know what a Kappa is,
don't you? Yes, yes, that's very funny but we can't
print that definition.
He and she were chatting on a sofa at a party.
(Note: This is the first Phi Delt ever seen chatting to
a she on a sofa.)
A stranger approached, called she a pet name,
name.
The Phi Delt, springing one of his pat expressions,
bleated. "After all, let's call a horse a horse." We
agree. Could Webster do better?

She was a Robleitc, and a lover of lovies. She had
a rather plump, overly plump roommate.
One night she found her roommate's lost, lace
trimmed foundation.
But she didn't, feel she had guts enough to wear it.

Thornhill must be pounding his pretty boys pretty
hard. During play tryouts yesterday, the director as
signed one of Tiny's beef trusters who aspires to the
draaa-ma in his spare moments (incidentally his ini
tials arc A.A.) to read the bit part of "Bill." The
reading progressed smoothly. Then came William's first
line. Silence. "Well," yelled the director, "what about
it. William?" The football player wanted to help.
"Yeah, what about it, William," he threatened his fel
low hams. It was the director's turn. "That's you, you
clunk! You're reading William's part, aren't you?"
"No." replied the escape from the bucket brigade.
"You told me to read the part of Bill."

It was last Friday night at San Francisco's combina
tion beach and amusement park. A freshman (in fact,
he is acting editor of this frosh edition) is sitting on the
curb near the beach looking sheepishly at his car
parked a few yards away. It is dark. He is putting
on his shoes and stockings. The crowd passes and re
passes, and just stares. Then a feminine voice trills
from the darkness of the car, '0.K., Charlie, you can
get in the car now. (Chailie should write a book.)
He swears he was wading.
Thank you Gates; send protests to Jaques.

passes, and just stares. Then a feminine voice trills
from the darkness of the car, '0.K., Charlie, you can
get in the car now. (Chailie should write a book.)
He swears he was wading.
Thank you Gates; send protests to Jaques.

I seem to remember the hack who usually writes
this column mentioning something about "Pop-eyed"
Pi Phis and "I'm-on-a-Committee" Tri Dclts. This
heart-warming tale has much of the same smell—
He was a Phi Delt—and the Sports Editor of the
last volume of The Daily (no names mentioned). Pie
was a lover of pat expressions.
She was a Kappa—you know what a Kappa is,
don't you? Yes, yes, that's very funny but we can't
print that definition.
He and she were chatting on a sofa at a party.
(Note: This is the first Phi Delt ever seen chatting to
a she on a sofa.)
A stranger approached, called she a pet name,
name.
The Phi Delt, springing one of his pat expressions,
bleated. "After all, let's call a horse a horse." We
agree. Could Webster do better?

She was a Robleitc, and a lover of lovies. She had
a rather plump, overly plump roommate.
One night she found her roommate's lost, lace
trimmed foundation.
But she didn't, feel she had guts enough to wear it.

Thornhill must be pounding his pretty boys pretty
hard. During play tryouts yesterday, the director as
signed one of Tiny's beef trusters who aspires to the
draaa-ma in his spare moments (incidentally his ini
tials arc A.A.) to read the bit part of "Bill." The
reading progressed smoothly. Then came William's first
line. Silence. "Well," yelled the director, "what about
it. William?" The football player wanted to help.
"Yeah, what about it, William," he threatened his fel
low hams. It was the director's turn. "That's you, you
clunk! You're reading William's part, aren't you?"
"No." replied the escape from the bucket brigade.
"You told me to read the part of Bill."

It was last Friday night at San Francisco's combina
tion beach and amusement park. A freshman (in fact,
he is acting editor of this frosh edition) is sitting on the
curb near the beach looking sheepishly at his car
parked a few yards away. It is dark. He is putting
on his shoes and stockings. The crowd passes and re
passes, and just stares. Then a feminine voice trills
from the darkness of the car, '0.K., Charlie, you can
