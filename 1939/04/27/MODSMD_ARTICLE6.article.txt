I clared Milan Dempster, Farm Se
] eurity Administration official, who
I spoke last night in the Women's

j mcntary film "The River."
Manager of the Wesley Federal
I migratory worker camp, which will
I be visited Sunday by members of
j the Steinbeck Committee, which
presented last night's program, Mr.
Dempster discussed the unsanitary,
unhealthy conditions under which
live thousands of California itinerant
laborers.
