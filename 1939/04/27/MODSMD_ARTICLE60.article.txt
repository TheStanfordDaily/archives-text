# CAMPUS OPINION
## Equally BAGGED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
This is to answer the despicable
slander which was cast on the hon
orable Dekes by that rabble-rouser,
the Branner Bund Leader. I think
the Dekes are wonderful boys and
not "fools" at all. I have walked by
the house many times and have
never minded their playfully throw
ing water at me. None of my girl
friends have ever complained of
having their dresses ruined. As far
as fools go the Branner boys have
proved themselves as such by their
indiscriminate water bagging of
moving cars, distracting the drivers
and increasing the chances of col
lision and injury. Hall men should
be less hasty in finding fault with
the Dekes since the Deke house has
been a leader in the revolt against
Row politics and voted straight hall
this yeai".
Since Stanford is a Democracy I
am glad that we girls are bagged on
an equal basis with the men. And as
for Sister Cobbs and his column on
advice to the lovelorn, he never has
to "duck when he passes the Deke
house" because that brave young in
dividual always walks on the other
side of the street. I'm sure that he
never gets his glasses wet.
It seems to resolve itself down to
the fact that Stanford girls would
rather have their dresses sprinkled
by those handsome sharpshooting
Dekes than have their lives and cars
endangered by those bespectacled
blundering Branner bucket-briga
diers.
