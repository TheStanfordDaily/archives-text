# GRADE POINTS HIT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
R.D. writes under the heading |
"Stanford Social Register": "grade |
points are absolutely accurate as an |
indication of worth and ability." On I
the contrary, grade points are no j
more than a poor measure of a stu- |
dent's "worth and ability" for a giv- j
en taskâ€”all too often, the task of j
boning overnight for an ex, only to |
forget the material a week later. Let j
your R.D. inspect his fellow students I
and confess the absurdity of such a
statement.
