# Roble Director Recounts Introduction To Royalty
## 
### HELEN GRISWOLD 
"You could have heard a pin
drop —at the end of the ballroom
stood Her Majesty Queen Wilhel
mina!"
This simple but graphic picture is
part of Mrs. Leona B. Diekema's ac
count of her first view of the Queen
of the Netherlands, to whom she lat
er was presented at a private audi
ence. Mrs. Diekema, director of
Roble Hall, was recounting her ex
periences at the court of the Nether
lands, where she had many contacts
with the plenipotentiaries of foreign
countries during the years from
1929 to 1931, while her husband, the
late Garrett John Diekema, was the
American envoy to the Netherlands.
MEETS QUEEN
"As I entered the salon at the
Uoordeinde Palace, Queen Wilhel
mina rose to greet me," said Mrs.
Diekema. "I had read that one
never shakes hands with royalty,
but in her private audiences Queen
WiLhelmina does just that, which
made me feel quite at home. After
my interview, I left the room, back
ing and courtesying, as is the cus
tom, but it is a custom that can
make the shortest distance seem like
miles."
PRESENT AT SIGNING
Aside from their social activities
at The Hague, Ambassador and
Mrs. Diekema were asked to be
present at the signing of documents
for the Young Debt Payment Plan,
as representatives of the United
States.
On January 20, 1930, the envoys
from various European nations gath
ered to sign this pact, which, among
other things, provided for heavy
taxation throughout Germany in or
der to pay the heavy forfeits im
posed upon them by agreement of
the nations. "In the light of recent
developments, this has proved to
have been a very significant meet
ing, one which may have helped to
create the present German situa
tion," stated Mrs. Diekema.

On one occasion Mrs. Diekema was
asked if she could speak Dutch as
fluently as her husband. She re
plied that six words comprised her
total Dutch vocabulary. Prince
Henry of the Netherlands inquired
what they were, and Mrs. Diekema
was forced to admit that of the six,
she didn't know the meanings of
four, and that the remaining two
were the words for chicken and po
tatoes, which statement greatly

amused the Dutch people in the
company.
Asked for her opinion on the pres
ent European situation, Mrs. Dieke
ma declared she was confident that
Holland would not tight unless in
vaded, but that shg relies on Dutch
bluntness and straightforwardness
to keep The Netherlands from be
coming involved in the present bick
erings in Europe.
In summing up her stay in Am
sterdam as the wife of a foreign
diplomat, Mis. Diekema said, "It was
like living at the crossroads of the
world and watching history in the
making."

vaded, but that shg relies on Dutch
bluntness and straightforwardness
to keep The Netherlands from be
coming involved in the present bick
erings in Europe.
In summing up her stay in Am
sterdam as the wife of a foreign
diplomat, Mis. Diekema said, "It was
like living at the crossroads of the
world and watching history in the
making."
"You could have heard a pin
drop —at the end of the ballroom
stood Her Majesty Queen Wilhel
mina!"
This simple but graphic picture is
part of Mrs. Leona B. Diekema's ac
count of her first view of the Queen
of the Netherlands, to whom she lat
er was presented at a private audi
ence. Mrs. Diekema, director of
Roble Hall, was recounting her ex
periences at the court of the Nether
lands, where she had many contacts
with the plenipotentiaries of foreign
countries during the years from
1929 to 1931, while her husband, the
late Garrett John Diekema, was the
American envoy to the Netherlands.
MEETS QUEEN
"As I entered the salon at the
Uoordeinde Palace, Queen Wilhel
mina rose to greet me," said Mrs.
Diekema. "I had read that one
never shakes hands with royalty,
but in her private audiences Queen
WiLhelmina does just that, which
made me feel quite at home. After
my interview, I left the room, back
ing and courtesying, as is the cus
tom, but it is a custom that can
make the shortest distance seem like
miles."
PRESENT AT SIGNING
Aside from their social activities
at The Hague, Ambassador and
Mrs. Diekema were asked to be
present at the signing of documents
for the Young Debt Payment Plan,
as representatives of the United
States.
On January 20, 1930, the envoys
from various European nations gath
ered to sign this pact, which, among
other things, provided for heavy
taxation throughout Germany in or
der to pay the heavy forfeits im
posed upon them by agreement of
the nations. "In the light of recent
developments, this has proved to
have been a very significant meet
ing, one which may have helped to
create the present German situa
tion," stated Mrs. Diekema.
CAN'T SPEAK DUTCH
On one occasion Mrs. Diekema was
asked if she could speak Dutch as
fluently as her husband. She re
plied that six words comprised her
total Dutch vocabulary. Prince
Henry of the Netherlands inquired
what they were, and Mrs. Diekema
was forced to admit that of the six,
she didn't know the meanings of
four, and that the remaining two
were the words for chicken and po
tatoes, which statement greatly

amused the Dutch people in the
company.
Asked for her opinion on the pres
ent European situation, Mrs. Dieke
ma declared she was confident that
Holland would not tight unless in
vaded, but that shg relies on Dutch
bluntness and straightforwardness
to keep The Netherlands from be
coming involved in the present bick
erings in Europe.
