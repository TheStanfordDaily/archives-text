|>EFORE you are out of bed thLs
morning, before you have gulp
ed your coffee and rushed to an 8-
o'clcck, he will have spoken.
Yes, once again this insignificant
planet is standing slill in its orbit,
awaiting the words of Adolf Hitler.
At 12 noon in Berlin the man of
destiny will rise before a thundering
Reichstag to deliver his answer to
President Roosevelt's non-aggression
plea.
And the ears of the western world
are straining to hear the speech
which could spell its destruction if
the Reichsfuehrer wanted it to.
Peace lies in his hands; he has treat
ed it. roughly, but as yet he has with
held the final blow.

In all probability "No," will be
Hitler's reply to the President
proposal. Proclaiming his peace
ful intentions, he will demonstrate,
with embarrassing references to
the Spanish-American War, how
the United States has been iust as
rough on her Latin American
neighbors as Germany has been on
hers in Mittel Europa.
This is not war talk. The danger
lies not so much in the speech it
self as in the precarious state of
European affairs. Every major
power is ready and waiting for
something to start, and situations
like this are the ones that breed
war.

W/TTH conscription approved yes
terday by both houses of Par
liament, Britain will be prepared to
meet any attack on her chalk
cliffed isle or on the allies of her
anti-totalitarian bloc. France, Pol
and, Rumania, and Turkey are lined
up behind England, and Russia is
about to take the fatal step.
Soviet Ambassador Ivan Maisky
returned to London today bringing
word that his government has
agreed to intervene if any mem
ber of the stop-Hitler brigade is
attacked. British officials regard
this as an omen of a definite mili
tary pact in the near future.
The powerful, super - efficient
armies of Italy and the Reich have
been preparing for war these many
months. Japan, Hungary, and Jugo
slavia will join their battle-line as
soon as conflict breaks into the
open.

Vt/'ITH the powers of Europe and
the great menace of the Orient
lined up, waiting for the starting
gun, American minds are likely to
wonder what this country will do
when the big day comes. Only too
obvious is the anti-Fascist bias of
Franklin D. Roosevelt. The inferred
accusation in his peace plea plus his
frequent public blasts have been
sufficient to line up the United
States on the British side of the
fence.
Although no strictly accurate
judgment can be made, it is safe
to say that public opinion favors
the democracies over the dictator
ships on ideological grounds. But
does the country want to go to
war? That is the question.

Our interests in the current strug
gle in Europe are not stronger than
they were in the last war. We have
nothing to gain, everything to lose.
Millions of men killed and millions
of dollars lost proved in 1918 that
it is impossible to make the world
safe for democracy.
The problem narrows down to how
the United States can manage to
stay out of the conflict in this in
creasingly tiny world. American
financial interests and a few Amer
ican lives are bound to be involved
in the fortunes of the war. Propa
ganda can make men fight.
And fight wc will unless por
tents arc deceiving, unless the in
sanity of national ambition comes
lo a sudden and unexpected end.
