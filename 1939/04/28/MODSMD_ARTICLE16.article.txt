# Sophomore Carnival to Turn Pavilion Into Gayway Tonight as Convalescent Home Drive Swings into Spotlight
## Houghs, Queens Will Dervish At Masque Ball 
### JAMES COCHRANE 
Whirling dervishes and their girl
friends, sheiks and their harems,
j yes, even Ali Baba and his Forty
i Thieves will cavort about to modern
! swing at the Masque Ball next Fri
| day night from 9 to 1 o'clock.
Sheik Ali is probably more ac
j customed to the reedy sighs of a
snake-charming bunch—but Stan
ford isn't. So the Arabs will have
. to get along as best they can dancing
; to the music of one of the smoothest
bands on the coast, under the baton
I of Carvel Craig.
With Craig's 11-piece orchestra
: will come a novelty song trio, "The
Three Cs," and Kay Howard, fea
! tured singer.
SWEET BAM)
Described by Variety as "sweet
and smooth," the band plays in a
mood reminiscent of the Duchin-
Reisman school, accenting velvety
i brass work with violin and piano
! bits. Craig Is the original plugger
lof such song-hits as "More Than
Ever," "Please Be Kind," "So Help
Me," and "It's Wonderful."
Held anually as the concluding
event of the Convalescent Home's
week of charity, the costume ball
l has been traditionally one of the
| most colorful events of Stanford's
j year. This year's "Arabian Nights"
| theme offers great promise of a re
! turn of this color of former years, in
| the view of Lyon and Miss Conn.
The ball will be held in a huge
, Arab tent which will be erected in
the Women's Gym next week. Dec
| orators visited the gym yesterday
I morning to work out the plans.
! ENTERTAINMENT FEATURE
| Though it. is an integral part of
! the Convalescent Home Drive, the
Masque Ball will be primarily an
entertainment feature, according to
Lyon. "All proceeds will go to the
drive," Lyon said, "but we will be
satisfied to just break even on the
dance. We want to revive the old
tradition of Masque Balls this year
and make the dance a really color
ful event."
Bids for the Masque Ball go on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office this morn
ing, and may be purchased at any
time before the dance. Two masks
will be given with each bid, but the
remainder of the costume is up to
each person, Miss Conn said.
Working with Lyon and Miss
Conn are Tom Nichols, Maxine Dai-
Icy, June Murphy, Bob Low, and
John Shallenbergcr.

week of charity, the costume ball
l has been traditionally one of the
| most colorful events of Stanford's
j year. This year's "Arabian Nights"
| theme offers great promise of a re
! turn of this color of former years, in
| the view of Lyon and Miss Conn.
The ball will be held in a huge
, Arab tent which will be erected in
the Women's Gym next week. Dec
| orators visited the gym yesterday
I morning to work out the plans.
! ENTERTAINMENT FEATURE
| Though it. is an integral part of
! the Convalescent Home Drive, the
Masque Ball will be primarily an
entertainment feature, according to
Lyon. "All proceeds will go to the
drive," Lyon said, "but we will be
satisfied to just break even on the
dance. We want to revive the old
tradition of Masque Balls this year
and make the dance a really color
ful event."
Bids for the Masque Ball go on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office this morn
ing, and may be purchased at any
time before the dance. Two masks
will be given with each bid, but the
remainder of the costume is up to
each person, Miss Conn said.
Working with Lyon and Miss
Conn are Tom Nichols, Maxine Dai-
Icy, June Murphy, Bob Low, and
John Shallenbergcr.
Whirling dervishes and their girl
friends, sheiks and their harems,
j yes, even Ali Baba and his Forty
i Thieves will cavort about to modern
! swing at the Masque Ball next Fri
| day night from 9 to 1 o'clock.
Sheik Ali is probably more ac
j customed to the reedy sighs of a
snake-charming bunch—but Stan
ford isn't. So the Arabs will have
. to get along as best they can dancing
; to the music of one of the smoothest
bands on the coast, under the baton
I of Carvel Craig.
With Craig's 11-piece orchestra
: will come a novelty song trio, "The
Three Cs," and Kay Howard, fea
! tured singer.
SWEET BAM)
Described by Variety as "sweet
and smooth," the band plays in a
mood reminiscent of the Duchin-
Reisman school, accenting velvety
i brass work with violin and piano
! bits. Craig Is the original plugger
lof such song-hits as "More Than
Ever," "Please Be Kind," "So Help
Me," and "It's Wonderful."
