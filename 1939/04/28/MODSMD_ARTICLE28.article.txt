## 
### 
j Continuation of a survey being
! sponsored by the United States Pub
lic Health Service to gather infor
\ mation in regard to syphilis will be
! made at Stanford tomorrow, when
! Wassermann tests will be given both
j men and women from 9 to 11 o'clock
lat the Men's and Women's Health
| Services.
Specific purpose of the survey, ac
| cording to Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
: medical adviser of men, is to check
1 positive reactions which occasionally
! occur to the Wassermann tests when
| there has been no exposure to the
; disease or previous historical data
I showing infection.
j This is the third time that the
i tests have been given at Stanford
I and other universities which are co
j operating in the survey and they
[ will be made free of charge on ap
j plication by interested students.

J All stores in Rio de Janeiro have
j steel fronts, just in case a revolu-
I tion happens along.
