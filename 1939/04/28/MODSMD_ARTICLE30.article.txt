Stanford golf coui'se, was found by
sheriff's officers late yesterday

Campus officers conducted an in

Robles had become separated from
a companion, Albert Vasquez, also

golf balls. Apparently Robles, who
could not swim, stumbled into the
creek and drowned immediately,
according to Deputy Coroner Irving
