# Student Summer Jobs Still Open
## 
### 
In a message released yesterday
from the Student Employment Of
fice, Mrs. Irene Coverky notified all
students that there still exist many
vacancies for summer jobs with
Camp-fire groups, private camps,
and Boy Scout camps.
These positions call particularly
for men and women who are expe
rienced in the handicrafts, water
front work, nature study, riding and
program directing. This work is
done in return for room, board, and
occasionally transportation and cash.
Students who have not as yet regis
tered for surpmer work should make
application at the Employment Office
in the near future.
In the list of jobs open at present,
there is a call for a man to do
kitchen work during week-end
nights in return for board. A board
and cash position is still open to a
man who can cook and serve Sunday
dinner and who can wash a car.
The final call is for a man who will
be on the campus this summer and
who is interested in working in the
garden and home. This job pays
room and board.
