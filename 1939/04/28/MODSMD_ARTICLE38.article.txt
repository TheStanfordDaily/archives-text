# Grasshopper Plague Proves Boon to Stanford Scientists
## 
### 
The grasshopper plague that has been visiting desolation and destruc
tion on the grain and cotton crops of Coalinga is proving an indirect boon
to Stanford scientists.
Dr. George W. Beadle and Dr. Edward L. Tatum, Stanford biologists,
returned to their laboratory this week with two large packing cases filled
with dried grasshoppers which will provide valuable ingredients for im-

portant experiments on insect hor
mones.
Millions of grasshoppers collected
on a trip made by the two scientists
into Kern County were caught in
nets held out from an automobile
running board. When the dried re
mains of the hoppers, still in the
pupal stage (crawling, not yet flying)
are ground up and treated with al
cohol and other solvents they will
yield a hormone extract used in
studying the genetics of the vinegar
fly.
One of the strangest genetic rid
dles that has been known but unex
plained to scientists for several years
is that a great many varieties of in
sect will yield hormone substance
capable of changing the eye-color
of vinegar flies. When this extract
is injected by means of a microscopi
cally sharp-pointed pipette into
newly hatched larvae of the vinegar
fly belonging to a strain whose eyes
lack color, they develop normal red
dish-brown eyes.
This kind of environmental con
trol changes the eyes of only one
generation of Hies; their offspring,
like the grandparents, have no eye
color.
