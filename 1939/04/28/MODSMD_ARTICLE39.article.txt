## '42 GUILTY OF 'BAGGING' 
### 
My Dear Sally Sorority:
You are quite right, Stanford is a
Democracy and you girls are "bag
ged." However, you are mistaken
in some respects. The water bag
ging of moving cars, etc. is not the
work of Branncr, but of those lowly
untouchables of the Class of '42. If
you ever decide to walk by Branner
with your girl friends, who do not
complain of having their dresses
ruined, just let us know. I am sure
that those bespectacled blundering
Branner bucket - brigadiers can do
all that those "wonderful" Dekcs do,
plus a lot more.
We hall men are not finding fault
with the Deke house which voted
straight hall this year because it
probably couldn't get the Row to
run its way, but just wish to have
it known that Branner is not falling
apart nor is water dripping from
floor to floor. Branner extends its
most cordial invitation to you and
your friends to inspect our domi
cile.
We will be waiting for you.
