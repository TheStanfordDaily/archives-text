# GLAD YOU LIKED IT

The Editor, Sir:
There must be many people who ,
attended the Junior Prom last Fri- j
day evening willing to agree with j
me that George Olsen's floor show i
was certainly the best I hat they had '
ever had the pleasure of witnessing.
I am certain that, in all my travels, !
I have never seen its equal.
Congratulations, I think, are in j
order. Certainly an explanation of i
how it was so smoothly staged
should be forthcoming from either
the chairman of the dance or from
Dr. Wilbur.
I feel confident that if the Farm
were to have many more of these
high-class floor shows the accident
rate on the Bayshore would drop
off tremendously, sine* 3 there would
be fewer of the children trekking to
the city in search of equal enter
tainment.
Student - governed Stanford has j
certainly taken a major step ahead 1
by permitting really fine entertain- '
ment to be presented to the student j
body. Let's have more of it.
