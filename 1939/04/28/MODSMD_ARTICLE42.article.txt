# Union Votes Down 'Blind' U.S. Support
## S.P.U. Favors Policy Of Isolation For American Relations 
### 
After one of the Political Union's
most active sessions of the yeai" the
house by a 011-ll count voted down
the proposition "Resolved that the
United States should uncompro
misingly support Great Britain and
France in any policy they may
adopt toward the dictator nations."
Contrary to previous practice,
emphasis in the debate was not
placed upon the original proposi
tion. Following an exchange be
tween Conservatives and the left
wing Laborites over complete iso
lationism on the one hand, and ac
tive military support, the Liberal
party offered the amendment, "He
solved, that the United States con
tinue its present trade policy to co
operate with Great Britain and
France, refusing military aid so far
as it' is possible."
LABORITES SPLIT
With the new question before the
house, the Liberals drew active sup
port from the Labor wing, while the
Conservatives remained uncompro
misingly opposed to any form of
co-operative action. In spite of
split in party support the amend
ment was also defeated 25-21.
Taking the start at the opening
of the meeting, Jed Leetham intro
duced the original measure for the
Liberals and purposely shrouded the
party stand in an attempt to allow
ihe left, and right wing adherents to
set the tone of the discussion.
Branding a co-operative policy as
"the surest method of destroying
our valued institutions," Tim Hays,
the Conservative leader, set up the
party program in opposition to the
proposed measure, while Laborites
seemed hopelessly split between this
action and one of full military sup
port on the part of the United
States.
AMENDMENT supported
With the proceedings virtually
deadlocked Carl Diesenroth, Lib
eral leader, and Oliver Wyman
brought up the amendment which
gained immediate support from both
extremes in the house, but. with the
unstable element of the Conserva
tives brought back to the party the
motion could not be forced ihrough.
Urging that "isolationism would
not serve the best interests of this
country," the Liberals gained active
left wing support, but any policy
"which might bring the armed forc
es of the United States onto a Eu
ropean battlefield," was forcibly
outlawed.

misingly opposed to any form of
co-operative action. In spite of
split in party support the amend
ment was also defeated 25-21.
Taking the start at the opening
of the meeting, Jed Leetham intro
duced the original measure for the
Liberals and purposely shrouded the
party stand in an attempt to allow
ihe left, and right wing adherents to
set the tone of the discussion.
Branding a co-operative policy as
"the surest method of destroying
our valued institutions," Tim Hays,
the Conservative leader, set up the
party program in opposition to the
proposed measure, while Laborites
seemed hopelessly split between this
action and one of full military sup
port on the part of the United
States.
AMENDMENT supported
With the proceedings virtually
deadlocked Carl Diesenroth, Lib
eral leader, and Oliver Wyman
brought up the amendment which
gained immediate support from both
extremes in the house, but. with the
unstable element of the Conserva
tives brought back to the party the
motion could not be forced ihrough.
Urging that "isolationism would
not serve the best interests of this
country," the Liberals gained active
left wing support, but any policy
"which might bring the armed forc
es of the United States onto a Eu
ropean battlefield," was forcibly
outlawed.
After one of the Political Union's
most active sessions of the yeai" the
house by a 011-ll count voted down
the proposition "Resolved that the
United States should uncompro
misingly support Great Britain and
France in any policy they may
adopt toward the dictator nations."
Contrary to previous practice,
emphasis in the debate was not
placed upon the original proposi
tion. Following an exchange be
tween Conservatives and the left
wing Laborites over complete iso
lationism on the one hand, and ac
tive military support, the Liberal
party offered the amendment, "He
solved, that the United States con
tinue its present trade policy to co
operate with Great Britain and
France, refusing military aid so far
as it' is possible."
LABORITES SPLIT
With the new question before the
house, the Liberals drew active sup
port from the Labor wing, while the
Conservatives remained uncompro
misingly opposed to any form of
co-operative action. In spite of
split in party support the amend
ment was also defeated 25-21.
