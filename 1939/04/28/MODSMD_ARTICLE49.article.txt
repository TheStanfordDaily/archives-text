"Is that she?" inquired the dark
young man of the group of Farm
students that had gathered to watch
him sketch. "Don't be afraid to tell
me if it's wrong." But it wasn't
wrong; she was there on the paper
in black and white.
The dark young man was Carl
Shoucair, the Santa Monica artist
who has been on the Stanford cam
pus for the past ten days to sketch
and caricature Farm students.
He is really just marking time
until he leaves for Paris in the near
future. There he will attend the
Julien Academy of Art to which he
has received a scholarshio.
TRAVELED IN 4(i STATES
Mr. Shoucair has sketched his
way through all but two of the
United States and has painted many
famous people. He has drawn pas
sengers on boats to Bermuda, Los
Angeles, New York, and Cuba.
"I don't know what I'd do without
my work," he confided. "Once I
took a vacation and at the end of
two days I wanted to start drawing
again."
President Roosevelt and Vice-
President Garner are among the
notables he has sketched. The Pres
ident had two sittings for a portrait
to be included in the book of biogra
phies and illustrative drawings of
contemporary notables which Shou
cair is compiling. Several years ago
he was in Palo Alto to include Her
bert Hoover in his biographies.
FRIEND OF PRINCE
Prince Swasti Pradishah, brother
of the former Queen of Siam, is an
other of the prominent personages
he has drawn. In his scrapbook,
which is filled with sketches, copy
righted drawings, newspaper clip
pings of his travels, and the per
sonalities he has painted, is a picture
of him and his friend, the Prince.
When he was in Cuba, the news
papers got the story that the artist
was the Prince of Siam. "I got a lot
of business that day," he grinned.
Mr. Shoucair, a Syrian, now lives
in Santa Monica between his trav
els, but before that his home was in
Redlands. He attended Riverside
Junior College in Southern Califor
nia and then the Los Angeles Art
Institute. J. Francis Smith of Los
Angeles recommended him for the
scholarship to Paris.
"I prefer doing regular sketches
and portraits," the artist remarked,
"but at the universities I do more
business in caricatures. The college
people get more fun out of them."
He works in oils, watercolors, pen,
pencil, crayon, and charcoal.
While in Washington, he drew
Senator Carter Glass for a book by
James Palmer, Jr. It concerns also
Jesse James of the Reconstruction
Finance Corpoi'ation.
When questioned as to the com
pletion of his own book, he replied,
"Yes, I'm working on it, but before
it's finished I have a lot of traveling
i to do."
