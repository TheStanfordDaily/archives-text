EX COMMITTEE has not yet
passed on numerals for members of
the freshman track squad though it
is pretty certain that no more than
10 of the yearlings out of a squad
which once numbered over six dozen
will get the coveted '42 sweaters.
It seems like a terrifically rough
deal for these youngsters who train
from the first week of fall quarter
clear into the middle of the spring
term and then fail to get the only
token which the school has the
power to give for athletic achieve
ment.

THE REASON for the slim per
centage of block winners is due to
the fact that all California freshmen
have been taught to hate Stanford
freshmen, and all' Stanford frosh live
only for the day when they can
vanquish the Bear Cubs in some
form of endeavor.
As a consequence of this bitter
rivalry between two schools which
have similar scholastic standings and
equal prestige in the world without,
the rule has been set down that a
freshman track man must win a
place against the Bears in the Little
Big Meet if he is to be awarded a
numeral. Last Saturday only nine
Indians managed to place. Some
were sick or had off days; the rest
of the squad could win against other
competition, even press the strong
San Mateo Junior College aggrega
tion; yet they will not get recogni
tion because of a bitter rivalry
which has sprung up for no good
reason.
Of course, there will be times
when a mediocre athlete wins a
sweater because he happened to hit
a lucky streak in the Little Big
Meet. Ordinarily, however, the
youngsters run true to form.
Varsity trackmen must place
against U.S.C. or California, be on a
winning relay team win a first
place in the Fresno Relays or place
in the Pacific Coast Conference
Meet, where five places are awarded.
The chances of a deserving man
missing the boat with those oppor
tunities are rare indeed.
Whether Coach Bill Ellington will
have the nerve to flaunt the estab
lished custom and seek a couple of
dozen sweaters from Ex Committee
remains to be seen. Any action on
the matter must of necessity come
through his hands. It would be an
interesting experiment.
Before leaving the Freshman-
Bearcub meet, which the Berkeley
lads won by 112-19, we might bring
up the classic remark which Brutus
Hamilton, California's varsity coach,
passed to a few of the onlookers im
mediately after the relay had been
run. The Cubs had just put over
the greatest mass shellacking in the
history of Cal - Stanford freshman
relations.
Said Brutus: "Well, I had to jug
gle my men in a lot of events, but
we finally pulled through with a
tough victory." Hmm.

When Diver Roy Winkelmann
hurl his back just before the Cali
fornia-Indian swimming meet, it
marked his first non-appearance at
a conference aquatic feud in three
years. His only defeat in that time
was in a dual meet with the same
Bears in 1938 at Berkeley and he
recompensed for that upset with a
first place in the conference compe
tition a few weeks later. You might
like to think of "Wink" as a fun
loving little guy with a lot of ideas
of his own but it'll be a long long
time before Stanford will present a
diver who was as consistently ca
pable of bringing home first places
against all conference opposition.
That is it will be a long time unless
Howie Adams of the frosh team
turns out to be an Olympic cham
pion as a sophomore.

pable of bringing home first places
against all conference opposition.
That is it will be a long time unless
Howie Adams of the frosh team
turns out to be an Olympic cham
pion as a sophomore.
EX COMMITTEE has not yet
passed on numerals for members of
the freshman track squad though it
is pretty certain that no more than
10 of the yearlings out of a squad
which once numbered over six dozen
will get the coveted '42 sweaters.
It seems like a terrifically rough
deal for these youngsters who train
from the first week of fall quarter
clear into the middle of the spring
term and then fail to get the only
token which the school has the
power to give for athletic achieve
ment.

THE REASON for the slim per
centage of block winners is due to
the fact that all California freshmen
have been taught to hate Stanford
freshmen, and all' Stanford frosh live
only for the day when they can
vanquish the Bear Cubs in some
form of endeavor.
As a consequence of this bitter
rivalry between two schools which
have similar scholastic standings and
equal prestige in the world without,
the rule has been set down that a
freshman track man must win a
place against the Bears in the Little
Big Meet if he is to be awarded a
numeral. Last Saturday only nine
Indians managed to place. Some
were sick or had off days; the rest
of the squad could win against other
competition, even press the strong
San Mateo Junior College aggrega
tion; yet they will not get recogni
tion because of a bitter rivalry
which has sprung up for no good
reason.
Of course, there will be times
when a mediocre athlete wins a
sweater because he happened to hit
a lucky streak in the Little Big
Meet. Ordinarily, however, the
youngsters run true to form.
Varsity trackmen must place
against U.S.C. or California, be on a
winning relay team win a first
place in the Fresno Relays or place
in the Pacific Coast Conference
Meet, where five places are awarded.
The chances of a deserving man
missing the boat with those oppor
tunities are rare indeed.
Whether Coach Bill Ellington will
have the nerve to flaunt the estab
lished custom and seek a couple of
dozen sweaters from Ex Committee
remains to be seen. Any action on
the matter must of necessity come
through his hands. It would be an
interesting experiment.
Before leaving the Freshman-
Bearcub meet, which the Berkeley
lads won by 112-19, we might bring
up the classic remark which Brutus
Hamilton, California's varsity coach,
passed to a few of the onlookers im
mediately after the relay had been
run. The Cubs had just put over
the greatest mass shellacking in the
history of Cal - Stanford freshman
relations.
Said Brutus: "Well, I had to jug
gle my men in a lot of events, but
we finally pulled through with a
tough victory." Hmm.

When Diver Roy Winkelmann
hurl his back just before the Cali
fornia-Indian swimming meet, it
marked his first non-appearance at
a conference aquatic feud in three
years. His only defeat in that time
was in a dual meet with the same
Bears in 1938 at Berkeley and he
recompensed for that upset with a
first place in the conference compe
tition a few weeks later. You might
like to think of "Wink" as a fun
loving little guy with a lot of ideas
of his own but it'll be a long long
time before Stanford will present a
diver who was as consistently ca
pable of bringing home first places
