NEW YORK. April 27 (UP).â€”Dis
mal weather, which has pared nearly
150,000 in attendance off the young
baseball season as compared with
1938, postponed four more games to
day. At the four contests which
were played, two in the National
League and two in the American,
attendances were comparatively
small and did little to boost this sea
son's total, which stands at 041,107
for 51 games.

Rayon, an artificial silk, was first
produced in 1886.
