# Indian Poloists To Meet Trojans
## 
### 
Determined to repeat their victory j
1 over the top-notch Trojan polo
j squad, a hard riding quartet ol Card
i horsemen take to the highway field '
; at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon in the j
i last match of their two-game series.
! Last Friday in Los Angeles the In
; dians went on a last half scoring '
[ spree to swamp the southern bunch. I
| 10-5.
Previous to this the Farm stick j
and ball men were decidedly the !
underdogs. The only comparative 1
! yardstick being the University of j
1 Arizona matches, the Wildcats rank- 1
ing among the best in western col- j
legiate polo, with whom the Cards
: just managed to split a series while j
the Trojans came through with ;
straight wins.
Today the Indians will have the i
advantage of playing their own j
j mounts on a familiar field, but the !
| U.S.C. squad will put up a tough i
battle to avenge themselves. Prob
able starting line-up for the Cards
'in this afternoon's match will be
Walt Sullivan at No. 1, Steve i
| Downey No. 2, Jim Fullerton (C)
No. 3, and Bert McClintock No. 4. j
I This game is free to the public and j
| offers a splendid chance to witness
I first class college polo played here j
j on the campus.
