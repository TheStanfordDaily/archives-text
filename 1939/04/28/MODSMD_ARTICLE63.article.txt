# Defaults Mar Mural Hardball
## Stojkovich Imposes New Forfeit Limits 
### 
In a determined effort to stamp
out Ihe growing practice of default
which is slowly but surely bringing
the intramural hardball champion
ships to a standstill, Intramural
Manager Andrew Stojkovich is
planning to lay down the law. To
get the different organizations to
literally "play ball" with one an
other and with the intramural au
thorities. Stojkovich has outlined a
series of requirements and punish
ments which should get rid of "the
forfeit" for good.
Newest requirements concerning
the postponing or defaulting of a
game demand that a team express
its wish to postpone a tilt at least
48 hours before game time to Stojko
vich, that reasons for postponement
must be more urgent than in the
past, and that any team forfeiting a
second time without excuse is auto
matically dropped from the league
and points are taken from its intra
mural total.
Yesterday's results in hardball
play, two double defaults, is indica
tive of the way the tournament has
been lagging and justifies Manager
Stojkovich's drastic actions. How
ever, the softball games continued in
their quicker and lighter fashion.
Going into the seventh and final
inning tied at 6-all, Delta Tau
Delta's softball team pushed over a
winning run to defeat Theta Delt by
this slim margin in a mighty close
tilt. A direct contrast to this match
was Kappa Sig's crushing 25-8 win
over El Tigre. The fraternity bat
ters had a regular field day, while
the pitching combination of Coronett
to Olsen kept the El Tigre outfit well
in hand.
One big inning, the fourth, in
which they booted home 6 runs, was
responsible for Branner's batsmen's
victory of 10-4 against El Capitan.
The batteries were Ogilvie and
Pollack for ihe winners and Davis
and Collins for the losers.
