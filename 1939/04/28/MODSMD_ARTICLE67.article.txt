# Card Cindermen Seek Revenge
## Tracksters Out Gunning For Bears Trojans, Winded O's Also Entered in P.A. Meet Tomorrow 
### 
Competition in a track meet in j
which class alone will tell will give
Stanford's eindermen their first shot
at revenge for the defeat they took !
at the hands of California last Sat- '
urday. The occasion is the annual !
P.A. invitational track meet at Ed
wards Field tomorrow, and things
look promising for Dink Templeton's
pupils here where the going is so |
tough that an abundance of stars
and not depth will win the meet.
Not only will the Indians be gun- !
ning for the Bears, but will also get
their first crack at the Trojans, for !
four of U.S.C.'s mighty squad will
be in Berkeley performing Satur- 1
day.
4 TROJANS ENTERED
They are Earl Vickery, that red
headed flyer who is mighty close, in
fact, within one-tenth of a second,
of a world's record in the low hur
dles; Loring Day, a piker of a pole
vaulter as far as past Trojan per
formances go with a mark of 14 ft.
7 in.; Jim Humphrey, ace high
hurdler who accomplished a 14.3
flight last week-end; and the un
describable Louie Zamperini.
Clyde Jeffrey will meet perhaps
his strongest competition this year
in the form of Bob McGuire, San
Francisco Junior College's blond
flash, who has done a 9.7 in the,
century; Harold Davis, Morgan Hill
high school boy with a similar mark
to his credit; and the familiar Ray
Dean.
DISTANCES CLOSE
The distance events are sure to
yield some close races and fine
times. Seldom has there been gath
ered together in one meet such fine
paces as Troy's Zamperini; Stan
ford's "Mushy" Girard, and Paul
Moore; Cal's Cecil Cole, Stan Sadaj,
Ted Vollmer, Charlie Cooper, etc.;
and the Winged O's Ed Preston.
It's a shame that neither of the
crack Indian hurdlers, Sid Hayes or
Bill Hawkins, will get a chance to
match strides with the great Hum
phrey. Sid is still carefully nursing
his pulled muscle in anticipation of
a race with the Trojans Sat
urday while Bill's presence in Los
Angeles was necessary this week
end.
If Troy's Mr. Vickery wants to do
some record busting, he couldn't
find better men on the Coast to press
him to his utmost than Tom Moore
and Stanford's Captain Stan Hiser
man.
ZAGAR SQUITCHED
The "52-foot twins," Bill Wohle
and Stan Anderson, assure the Cards
of a majority of (he points in the
shot. Pete Zagar will be given an
other chance to shake himself loose
from the famous squitch applied by
Phil (Levy) Fox and turn the tables
on his rival. Dink Templeton's new
javelin find, Bill Braheny, will
again cross spears with Cal's Cap
tain Guy Mannuel, and Bill ought to
repeat his victory of last week-end.
