WHY can't Stanford have its movie queen?
Since the frosh opened the subject to
debate, the upperclassmen now take their
chance at putting their oar in.
For a good many years, the Masque ball has
been the biggest and the final event of the Con
valescent Home Drive —it has been one of the
drive's best money-makers; what's more, people
have enjoyed being separated from their money
for the Ball probably more than they have for
any other part of the drive.
Three years ago, however, the King-Queen
contest was withdrawn as a feature of the event.
Granted that that contest led to extravagance,
jealousies, disappointments, heart - break (in
some cases).
Doing away with it, however, made the
Masque Ball an annual flop —witness the last
two years.
This year, somebody thought up a new
publicity stunt —a movie queen at Stanford.
Stanford, much as it would like to think other
wise sometimes, is not far different from the rest
of America. America likes the glamor of the
movies; so does Stanford. Stanford—that is,
undergraduate Stanford —would like to see one
of the movie queens.
A Movie Queen as Queen of the Masque Ball.
There's not a better publicity stunt in the
world—and in this year of years, the Drive
needs at least one good idea to be a success.
It came along, through unusual tie-ups; it was
a natural.
Ex Committee okayed it. But it was stopped
cold.
Why?
1. It's an artificial stimulus to the Con Home
Drive —but so is all the publicity The Daily runs.
2. It would set a precedent—that is doubtful,
since such an idea would be almost impossible
to effect without the certain set of circum
stances, namely, a family tie-up witn the movie
industry, that now prevails. Besides, what if it
did? Is Stanford so pure that it hasn't plenty
of other precedents?
3. Misinterpretation by the newspapers—put
ting a heavy finger on an innocent idea is cer
tainly more subject to misinterpretation than
letting it be effected. Such prohibition hints
of more than innocence—what the city papers
could do with it, if the right man got hold of
the whole story!
The Daily suspects a reactionary sniff.
Bringing a movie star to the Masque Ball
would benefit no one but the Convalescent
Home. What possible harm could it do?
This isn't the first time, recently, that Stan
ford's blue-stockings have been hung on the
family clothes-line.
It's about time somebody applied some Clo
rox.
