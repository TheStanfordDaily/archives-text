THOSE freshmen who put out an issue of The
Daily yesterday morning were just a little
terrifying. Without a hitch—without any overt
hitches at least—they put out the paper 15
minutes before their midnight deadline, al
though predictions had ranged from 15 minutes
to an hour of overtime.
But those freshmen were just a little gullible
in the way they boomed Encina's Forty-Niner
Dance ("495r." they called it, rather originally),
to be held May 12.
In apparent good faith they announced there
would be a "wliiskerino contest," of all things.
Moreover, entrants will have just one week to
grow stubble for the competition; an examining
board will inspect contestants a week in ad
vance to see that they are clean-shaven.
Remarkable is the freshmen's utter indiffer
ence to the Third Law of Beards, which states
in undeniably clear terms that "freshmen are
too young to grow beards, at least in a week."
Particularly pertinent to the present discussion
is the first corollary, which makes it clear that
"if they try it they won't look so good."
That's the way with youth, it seems. No
respect for the laws of God and man.
Irrational as this affair appears, there is still
the sentimental aspect to be considered, how
over. Just think, cheek to cheek at a whiskerino.
What a medley of emotions the thought con
jures up!—R. D.
