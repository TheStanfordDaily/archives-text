# Carnival Spirit
## 
### 
TONIGHT the sophomores will fire the open
ing gun for an old Farm tradition. Big Game
bonfire, Pajamarino, Pledge Day, all have their
place, but nothing is as typical of Stanford,
nothing as long-remembered by an alumnus, as
the Convalescent Home Drive.
Instead of aimlessly scattering the Drive's
activities throughout the year, the student body
has concentrated them in one week in spring
quarter for the benefit of a worth-while char

: ily and a better enjoyment of life.
So typical a small-town lair is the Sophomore
Carnival, that one is constantly expecting W. C.
Fields to appear, and can hardly restrain him
self from yelling, "Hey, Rube!"
Anyone who knows how to have a good time
will tell you that a good farm-belt carnival, full
I of spirit and the smell of sawdust, is worth a
! dozen Gayways, Midways, trylons, and peri
! spheres. There is something spontaneous in
' the air that neither Grover Whalen nor Harris
! Connick can ever capture.
Year in and year out the sophomores put on
; a top-notch show, and tonight promises to be
no exception. If the dimes seem to disappear
! a little too quickly, it is always comforting to
know that they are helping to support a Con
valescent Home kid, instead of buying new
shoes for Sally Rand.â€”L. L.
