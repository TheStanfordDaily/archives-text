# BULL SESSION
## ATTENTION: LITTLE WALDO 
### JOHN COBBS 
I T ISN'T often that I get a chance to lean back and
speak like a wise old philosopher of the lessons
which experience has taught me; as professors are
fond of pointing out. college students are still in the
grammar school of experience. Eut yesterday was the
freshman edition of The Daily, and today the scene
is perfectly set for a good sage act.
The freshman who handled this column yesterday
was impressed with the way God and the comptroller
work out the problems of the University. He had just
seen a good crusade vanish in a puff of smoke, and
it made him wonder whether there was any point in
trying to redress the wrongs of Stanford. Evidently
the University was thoroughly capable of doctoring its
own warts.
After three years of playing "Chopsticks" on an
Underwood keyboard, I think I have the answer to
that, problem. It is simply that Stanford corrects it.s
faults when it is convenient, and forgets about them
when it is not. All the students and The Daily can
do is yell loud enough to raise the question of whether
or not reform is convenient.
If the University finds dirt on its face, it will re
move it, if there is no trouble involved. But if Stan
ford doesn't think the reform is worth the effort, it
will calmly ignore any amount of howling from the
students.
IN THE past three years we have had almost as
many Causes as we have had issues of The Daily;
and in the past three years, the University has quietly
overlooked almost as many Causes as there have been
issues of The Daily.
In my sophomore year, with all the enthusiasm of
youth I declared a holy war on Encina food. After
tlie third column, the cook cried, which distressed me.
A football player-hasher who was fond of the cook
started hunting me, which was even more distressing.
I spent a week avoiding him, and the Cause lapsed.
Today Enema's consumption of bicarbonate is the same
as il was when I risked my digestion there.

We have campaigned for courses in typing and
shorthand. We have marshalled facts and figures to
prove that Stanford cannot afford to maintain any
more expensive buildings. But the Announcement of
Courses is printed from the same type; and engineers
are surveying for the Hoover War Library tower of
of Babel.
We have cursed the Bawlout; we have directed a
logical barrage at the lockout system. But the official
blacklist still appears on schedule, and the complicated
ritual of late leaves remains sacred to the last pigeon
hole.
Stanford can change, and it can correct its own
faults, but only when convenient. Criticism on Ihe
campus is not destined to become a lost art. When
the University doesn't like our suggestions, it simply
ignores us. And when dear alma mater decides to cut
Us dead, it takes a lot of shouting to attract her
attention.
