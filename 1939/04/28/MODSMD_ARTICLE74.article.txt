MY DEAR AMI'S
I am not exadly a lover of lovies, but after yes-
I tcrday I don't feci that I have quite the guts to fill
| this column.
If you had the column, I would say that by the end
of the week you would be downright scatological,
getting filthier and funnier the while.
If 1 were a gentleman, the least I would do would
be I<> flip you to see who takes this space for the rest
I of the year.
Bui no one can write a column for very long and
remain a gentleman. I know.
And vou are learning.

A couple of weeks ago one ol them was in his
j room when the buzzer rang He ran out of the room to
tiie first phone. It was busy. He ran up to the phone on
the second floor just, above. It too was busy, as was
the phone on the third floor, as he discovered when he
got there. The phones on the fourth and fifth floors,
lie found, were out of order.
He ran over to the other side of Encina to the
other fifth floor phone. It was free. He picked up the
receiver, and a girl's voice asked him if he had the
Spanish assignment.
Of course, he said, and ran down to his first floor
! room, got the assignment, and ran back up to the fifth
floor phone.
He started to read the assignment. Suddenly the
I girl's voice interrupted him. "Oh, you're in another
class," and she hung up.
j \yi:ll. mayri:
A Stanford grad who has been out since last June
| working on a paper in a little town down south was
up on the Farm for a while the other day.
We had a coke in the Cellar. He ogled every girl
; who came by. "Gee," he would say. From the Alpha
; O's to the Pi Phis, from the Roble girls to Stevic and
I At en, he followed them with his eyes.
(I realize that is phrased in a way which will be a
| little uncomplimentary to the Alpha O's and the Roble
| itcs. All right. But it is a little complimentary to the
J Pi Phis and to Stevic and Aten for this column).
"Gee." he sighed, "you don't appreciate Stanford
women until you leave this place."
I said it was a hot day and he should not walk so
much in the sun with his hat off.
He paid no attention. He watched the girls go by
"Gee." lie said.
As I left him. lie was following two of them up
I the Row.
All of that scared me a little. Will the time come
Iwhen I think Stanford women en masse are a thing
to see?

J Pi Phis and to Stevic and Aten for this column).
"Gee." he sighed, "you don't appreciate Stanford
women until you leave this place."
I said it was a hot day and he should not walk so
much in the sun with his hat off.
He paid no attention. He watched the girls go by
"Gee." lie said.
As I left him. lie was following two of them up
I the Row.
All of that scared me a little. Will the time come
Iwhen I think Stanford women en masse are a thing
to see?
MY DEAR AMI'S
I am not exadly a lover of lovies, but after yes-
I tcrday I don't feci that I have quite the guts to fill
| this column.
If you had the column, I would say that by the end
of the week you would be downright scatological,
getting filthier and funnier the while.
If 1 were a gentleman, the least I would do would
be I<> flip you to see who takes this space for the rest
I of the year.
Bui no one can write a column for very long and
remain a gentleman. I know.
And vou are learning.

A couple of weeks ago one ol them was in his
j room when the buzzer rang He ran out of the room to
tiie first phone. It was busy. He ran up to the phone on
the second floor just, above. It too was busy, as was
the phone on the third floor, as he discovered when he
got there. The phones on the fourth and fifth floors,
lie found, were out of order.
He ran over to the other side of Encina to the
other fifth floor phone. It was free. He picked up the
receiver, and a girl's voice asked him if he had the
Spanish assignment.
Of course, he said, and ran down to his first floor
! room, got the assignment, and ran back up to the fifth
floor phone.
He started to read the assignment. Suddenly the
I girl's voice interrupted him. "Oh, you're in another
class," and she hung up.

I At en, he followed them with his eyes.
