# 'Mice and Men' Strong In Drama, Social Theme
## 
### 
I ' OF MICE AND MEN," <urrentl,\
j playing at the Geary Theater in San
j Francisco.
After San Francisco has slipped
j through one of its most barren win
ter theatrical seasons, the .simulta
neous opening of Thornton Wilder's
"Our Town" and John Steinbeck's
"Of Mice and Men," side by side on
the City's white way, leads drama
j goers to observe that "it never rains
j but it pours."
While, last week, 'Our Town"
' drew bridge-playing crowds to its
seven - no - trump performances,
Steinbeck's familiar legend of a
! couple of bindle-stiffs impressed au
diences all over again with the
straightforward simplicity of its nar
rative, the cumulative force of its
social message.
Staged by Frank Coletti and co
| produced by Sam Harris and Wal-
I lace Ford, the play is acted by al
most the same cast that appeared in
the long New York run. In three
I swiftly - moving acts the strange
tale of idealism and disillusion
grinds to its powerful end.
! WALLACE FORI) STARS
| Wallace Ford lives the part of
George. His action is always con
sistent. natural, and touched with
j sympathy that marks him as the
standout character. Lon Chaney, Jr.,
stepping into the difficult role of
hulking, witless Lennie, brings in
telligent, thoughtful action that com
plements his physical appearance.
I Expecting to be disappointed by his
j portrayal of this key character, au
diences were surprised by the sensi
tivity of the young actor's perform
| anee.
Crippled, forgotten Candy is
I subtly handled by John F. Hamilton,
j Frank Coletti assumes the part of

' mule-skinner Slim, displays mar
j velous stage presence and vocal ex
pression.
Curley's wife, taken by Isabel
Jewell, shadows her portrayal with
variations in mood, conveys the
gaudy, superficiality of her outward
character in contrast with the stunt
ed recesses of her mind; weighs
f idealistic hopes against garish sur
face
Rising to three peaks of action,
"Of Mice and Men," violent in its
explanation of men that buck barley
all day and dream of land of their
own where they may reap the bene
fits of the soil, tells a sharp, bitter
tale in black and white. Stark and
intense, it is not polite drawing-room
stuff. It is tempered always with
cold reality. Steinbeck has some
thing to say—and he says it well.—
Hutchinson.
