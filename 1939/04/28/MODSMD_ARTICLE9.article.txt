# 'Shoemaker's Holiday' Termed 'Ineffective'
## 
### JEAN NOWELL DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
Judged by modern standards, in
dicated by last night's production,
"Shoemaker's Holiday" is not dra
matically effective.
With a play demanding all the
color and exti-avagance of late Eliz
abethan and early Jacobean drama
turgy, modern dress and low key
acting united last night to give a
large audience in Little Theater a
puzzling evening's entertainment.
However, "Shoemaker's Holiday"
showed occasional flashes of the hi
larity and gusto of the times it
sought to portray.
CHARACTER PORTRAYAL
In costume, Asher Wilson's Simon
Eyre would have been robust, salty,
a product typical only of this pe
riod. Men like that don't exist
these days.
The simple, dignified scenery in no
way detracted from action. Lighting
was handled with skill and intelli
gence. But the lack of period cos
tumes and properties, involving
vague pantomime, caused narrative
development, to bog down.
Division of Speech and Drama
chose this occasion to introduce to
Farm theater-goers a host of new
talent that has been buried this year
in minor roles. Though most of them
lacked smooth stage technique,
their enthusiasm made up for lapses
in timing and delivery.
GUYSELMAN GOOD
Marian Guyselman, as Rose, turn
ed in a performance that was light,
natural, and appealing. Barbara
Thrasher, as her maid, gave a stand
out characterization. Always an ac
complished actress, she proved the
excellence of her dramatic ability.
Firk, played by Merle Meacham,
and Hodge, Fred Rodgers, were
amusing. The scene between Meach
am and Miss Thrasher was received
well by the audience. Patty de
Roulf did an able supporting job as
Margery, Simon's wife.
Cast in minor spots, but display
ing excellent dramatic skill, were
A1 Zelver, John Moore, Quentin
Warren, Ted Marcuse, and By Carl
son.
Hampered by the fact that he
couldn't be swashbuckling, Jack
Dawson did a creditable job as Ro
land Lacy. Melville Mack. Lord

! Mayor of London, was obsequiously
| correct in the role.
Waldemar Johansen, turning for
the first time from technical man
agement, at which he excells, to
straight direction, paced his play
well, but picked the wrong play for
! his costume innovations.
Despite the fact that the audience
i seemed confused about the triple
-1 theme development until the de
j nouement, when things fell nicely
! into place, "Shoemaker's Holiday"
I provided laughs in individual scenes,
j was often humorous, seldom up
roarious.
i It. will continue its run in Little
I Theater with matinee performance
j today at 3:30 o'clock, Saturday and
! Monday nights at 8 o'clock.
