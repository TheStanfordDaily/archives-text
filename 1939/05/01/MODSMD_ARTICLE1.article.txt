### LARRY LIVINCSTON 
I sat in a movie the
ater and watched another pre
war era, a film that showed with
unaffected reality how the last war
changed the lives of a pair of popu
lai dancers. Because thj picture
was filled with quaint old-fashioned
clothes and songs and automobiles
instead of the usual emotional close
ups, the audience seemed to find a
peculiarly current meaning in the
story it told.
A Palo Alto audience is no accu
rate index of the nation's popular
view of war, but from the applause
that greeted America's entrance into
the last conflict and the remarks
that drifted through the lobby after
the picture, it appears that a size
able cross-section of the country
considers war inevitable. It is with
such a mental set as this, or at least
one which recognizes the possibil
ity of trouble, that we scrutinize the
European scene today, asking, "What
are the odds?"
* * m
A S WAS to be expected, the
center of disturbance has shift
ed back to Danzig and the Polish
Corridor. Adolf Hitler has made
up his mind that he is going to
swallow (he Baltic port and that
he is going to build a road on
(Herman territory between the
Reich and East Prussia. This will
require the cession of Poland's
privileges in the free city and of
a strip of land 15 miles wide across
her precious outlet to the sea.
Because such a move would mean
a vast commercial sacrifice, because
the Poles place the Nazis near the
top of their long list of potential en
emies, they have repeatedly turned
down Germany's demands, and yes
terday took a firm stand against
giving up either land or privileges.
From Warsaw comes word that
Poland is ready to fight.
With armies patrolling the Ger
man border, with fleets of planes
flying over the capitol city, with
posters threatening Adolf Hitler,
the Poles are answering the Fueh
rer's denunciation of the Nazi-
Polish non-aggression pact. In his
speech to the Reichstag last Friday
Herr Hitler declared the treaty void
in the light of Poland's recent alli
ance with Britain.
* * *
In all probability Germany will
lake no action on the Danzig-
Corridor questions this week, hut
experience has proved that when
the Fuehrer talks about regaining
lands lost by the Treaty of Ver
sailles, when he rants about op
pressed Germans outside of the
Reich, he means to do something
about them in the near future.
Today he seems to be sitting back,
surveying with satisfaction the
map of Europe he has helped to
create, and waiting for the demo
cratic allies to make the next
move.
IRONICALLY enough, the Hitler
speech turning down Roosevelt's
co-operative peace proposal may re
sult in a move by France and Eng
land to prevent war through a se
ries of alliances with Germany. The
Nazi leader expressed his willing
ness to sign non-aggression agree
ments with any of the 31 powers
mentioned in the U. S. President's
plea.
The French and British arc se
riously considering signing such
pacts in order to catch Herr Hitler
in a noose he wove himself. If Eng
land was pledged to peace with Ger
many, she could not fulfill her ob
ligation to come to the aid of Poland
in case of attack. But if the Reich
signed such treaties with all the na
tions surrounding it, an aggressive
step against any of them would ren
der all agreements void.
Under the diplomatic system
(hat used lo be, this idea would
he considered a master stroke, the
creation of a genius (o keep the
world from war. But in I!)!!!),
when as many treaties are broken
as are kept. it will take more than
signatures and seals on paper to
guarantee the permanence of
peace.

Today he seems to be sitting back,

IRONICALLY enough, the Hitler
speech turning down Roosevelt's
co-operative peace proposal may re
sult in a move by France and Eng

signed such treaties with all the na

A Palo Alto audience is no accu

that greeted America's entrance into
the last conflict and the remarks
that drifted through the lobby after
the picture, it appears that a size

considers war inevitable. It is with
such a mental set as this, or at least

require the cession of Poland's
privileges in the free city and of

a vast commercial sacrifice, because
the Poles place the Nazis near the
