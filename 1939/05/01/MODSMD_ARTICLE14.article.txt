# Tag Day Salesmen to Forego 'Pressure Methods in Drive
## 
### BUD AMES 
"If any person does not buy a tag <oday, we aren't going (o call him
or her a 'heel.' as the salesmen did last year. Thai's not the spirit of this
year's Tag Day sale."
This statement by Nancy Burketl, chairman of the horde of Rohleite
tag sellers that will descend upon (he campus today, reflects the tone of all

►this week's Convalescent Home
Drive.
She added: "You might say that
we aren't going to pester people this
Tag Day. All we ask is that every
body give what he or she is able to,
and that they wear their tag instead
of stuffing it away in some pocket.
; If we see a person with a tag we
promise we won't try to sell him
another."
Miss Burkett then stated that she
J and her committee members hoped
| to smash last year's rccord of $251.
| "These tags cost so little that the
I committee operates under an over
head of only $8 with the result that
i the pro£t is great," she said.
Low operating costs and hoped-for
large profit make today's tag sale
a big part of the Convalescent Home
Drive.
"As for the selling," continued
! Miss Burkett, "there are 43 of us,
| and we are going to try to sell all
i of the 2,500 tags we had printed. We
| plan to work from 8 o'clock this
i morning until about 4 o'clock. We
won't cut any classes and aren't al
lowed up on the Row, but we will
sell at about ten places on the Quad
—even walking between classes."

year's Tag Day sale."
This statement by Nancy Burketl, chairman of the horde of Rohleite
tag sellers that will descend upon (he campus today, reflects the tone of all

►this week's Convalescent Home
Drive.
She added: "You might say that
we aren't going to pester people this
Tag Day. All we ask is that every
body give what he or she is able to,
and that they wear their tag instead
of stuffing it away in some pocket.
; If we see a person with a tag we
promise we won't try to sell him
another."
Miss Burkett then stated that she
J and her committee members hoped
| to smash last year's rccord of $251.
| "These tags cost so little that the
I committee operates under an over
head of only $8 with the result that
i the pro£t is great," she said.

large profit make today's tag sale
