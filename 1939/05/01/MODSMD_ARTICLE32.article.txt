WASHINGTON. April .*)() (UP>.-
The 7Gth Congress enters its fifth
month tomorrow, with only the pas
sage of routine appropriation bills to
mar its "do nothing" record.
So clogged are the legislative tur
bines wtih important measures lead

bringing about adjournment before
early August. The more pessimistic
beileve the sesson wll extend
throughout the entire summer.
