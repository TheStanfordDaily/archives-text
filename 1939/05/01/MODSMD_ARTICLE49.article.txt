i time in many a year.
Three young pitchers, Claude
Purkitt. Gil Rahn, and Bill Masters,
were largely responsible for the
sensational success of the Card nine.
Purkitt was Coach Harry Wolter's
surprise pitching choice in the first
game against the Trojans. He and
R;|hn, who shared the pitching
, duties with him, pitched fine ball
while their mates were hitting the
rival pitchers hard and often to win
I the game, 11-5.
Purkitt also pitched six innings
j the next day against Ucla before
: giving way to Lazzarone. Although
"Laz' was slightly wild, he man

Masters pitched the last game

behind "Cootie"; Thompson, had won
: the decisive game from Southern
' California. Bill, who hadn't played
I in a league game all year, turned
| in one of the best pitched games of
i the season only to lose, 3-2. He al
! lowed six hits and walked one.
Coach Wolter summed up the
I trip by saying, ' The boys played as
I a team, everyone played bang-up
ball, and they went to town." He
emphasized the fact that the nine,
one of the youngest clubs 011 the
• coast, had won more than half of
their games, and that two of their
defeats came in extra inning games.
"Monty Pfyl's hitting, Dan Boone's
great defensive play, and the fine
work of Bill Jameson," he said,
"played a big part in the team's
success in Los Angeles."
