v\T~'RESH orange juice squeezed to order."
i 1 Cellar menus will be so emblazoned
soon, when installation of "The Stanford Daily
Memorial Orange Juice Squeezer" is com
pleted.
The wording of the menu won't mean an
admission that the bottled orange juice the
Cellar now serves is not fresh — for it is
squeezed and delivered several times each day.
It will mean, however, that lovers of citric
acid may order their favorite morning set-up
sure of the vitamin C that disappears from juice
which stands for a short while and more con
fident of escaping the slightly bitter taste that
accompanies that standing. But they will have
to wait to have it squeezed.
Where one point was gained in last week's
diatribe against Stanford's monopolistic Union,
several appear to be lost.
Explanations are only too complete. Miss
Christine Ricker, head of the Union, is too
logical long to continue in 1939 the harangue
that each year occupies editorial columns.
It appears that catering to Stanford at the
dinner table is a complex administrative prob
lem, tied up with the legislative dictates of
the policy-forming Union Board of Governors.
Of the 530,000 net profit last year, for ex
ample, 510,500 came from the Community Fees
and was set aside for the Memorial Hall debt.
The rest of that payment was from moneys
which are in reality University funds, but which
are left with the Union merely to make up the
balance of the payment.
After deducting this 523,000, the 57,000 left
seems insignificant. It is used primarily to set
up a reserve fund, to which any business—
profit or non-profit—is entitled.
On the matter of gravy, admission is frank
that it's not the best in the world. But, answers
the Union, if Stanford demands gravy on its
meats, as it apparently does—even little pig
sausages—how else produce gravy for meats
which are juiceless than by a mass-production
method? How, they answer in effect, draw
blood from a bloodless insect?
Too, it is admitted that Cellar dinners do not
have the flavor the Union directors would like
them to have. Just now, however, a new hotel
range has been installed that they hope will
take care of that situation.
A survey made in 53 colleges recently
showing that "student employees accomplish
20 per cent less work than full-time employees
in a given time," replies to any inexpensive
labor assertions. Added into the cost of that
labor is breakage which is not charged against
Union employees: a cup and saucer cost 49
cents.
Thus, the answer to a public query.
What Union food lacks, the answer supplies
—administrative detail is too much for the
questioning taste of the eating public.
One thing has been learned, however. If
Stanford is dissatisfied, it has only to register
its complaints to learn the reasons. If knowing
the reasons doesn't make the food taste as Stan
ford would like it, seemingly the best solution
is to shed a mournful tear, eat elsewhere.
Or become less finicky in its tastes.

dinner table is a complex administrative prob
lem, tied up with the legislative dictates of
the policy-forming Union Board of Governors.
Of the 530,000 net profit last year, for ex
ample, 510,500 came from the Community Fees
and was set aside for the Memorial Hall debt.
The rest of that payment was from moneys
which are in reality University funds, but which
are left with the Union merely to make up the
balance of the payment.
After deducting this 523,000, the 57,000 left
seems insignificant. It is used primarily to set
up a reserve fund, to which any business—
profit or non-profit—is entitled.
On the matter of gravy, admission is frank
that it's not the best in the world. But, answers
the Union, if Stanford demands gravy on its
meats, as it apparently does—even little pig
sausages—how else produce gravy for meats
which are juiceless than by a mass-production
method? How, they answer in effect, draw
blood from a bloodless insect?
Too, it is admitted that Cellar dinners do not
have the flavor the Union directors would like
them to have. Just now, however, a new hotel
range has been installed that they hope will
take care of that situation.
A survey made in 53 colleges recently
showing that "student employees accomplish
20 per cent less work than full-time employees
in a given time," replies to any inexpensive
labor assertions. Added into the cost of that
labor is breakage which is not charged against
Union employees: a cup and saucer cost 49
cents.
Thus, the answer to a public query.
What Union food lacks, the answer supplies
—administrative detail is too much for the
questioning taste of the eating public.
One thing has been learned, however. If
Stanford is dissatisfied, it has only to register
its complaints to learn the reasons. If knowing
the reasons doesn't make the food taste as Stan
ford would like it, seemingly the best solution
is to shed a mournful tear, eat elsewhere.
Or become less finicky in its tastes.
v\T~'RESH orange juice squeezed to order."
i 1 Cellar menus will be so emblazoned
soon, when installation of "The Stanford Daily
Memorial Orange Juice Squeezer" is com
pleted.
The wording of the menu won't mean an
admission that the bottled orange juice the
Cellar now serves is not fresh — for it is
squeezed and delivered several times each day.
It will mean, however, that lovers of citric
acid may order their favorite morning set-up
sure of the vitamin C that disappears from juice
which stands for a short while and more con
fident of escaping the slightly bitter taste that
accompanies that standing. But they will have
to wait to have it squeezed.
Where one point was gained in last week's
diatribe against Stanford's monopolistic Union,
several appear to be lost.
Explanations are only too complete. Miss
Christine Ricker, head of the Union, is too
logical long to continue in 1939 the harangue
that each year occupies editorial columns.
