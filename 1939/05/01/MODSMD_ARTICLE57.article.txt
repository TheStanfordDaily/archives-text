# Plea for Postponement

Dear professor:
Teaching classes during spring quarter
must be awfully difficult, what with the weather
fair and academic spirit at a low ebb. I know
that what I have to write you won't make your
cross any lighter, but it may make it easier to
understand why it seems heavier than usual.
This week is a special one at Stanford, not as
noisy and troublesome as Big Game week, but
none the less one which is bound to produce
unsatisfactory scholastic results. Your lecture
rooms will not be quite as empty as they were
in football season, but minds will be wandering
and examination papers will show it.
Starting today, the student body is going to
be preoccupied with putting over the annual
Convalescent Home Drive. For every day of
the week a money-making event has been
scheduled, an event which is certain to lower
the curve in your classes.
No, this isn't a country club. It's a university,
designed to fit young men and women for the
business of living. Organizing and making a
success of the Convalescent Home Drive offers
training which is of practical value to a large
number of students.
If you can see your way clear to postponing
that 20-page report, if you can hold over that
midquarter, if you can dismiss lab a little early
on Wednesday so I can work at Labcr Day, I
think you will find the results satisfactory.
Please let this serve as a request to think of
the Convalescent Home Diive when you are

making assignments from now until Friday
And next week, pour it on.
