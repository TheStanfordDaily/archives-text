i'koi or tiii: pudding
/ 'OLLEGE professors, in my opinion, are usually
quite capable of taking care of themselves; at
least the ones I know seem able to worry along with
out asking me to defend them. And so it isn't often
that I find myself manning the battlements for the
honor of the faculty. But yesterday "The American
Mercury" sent us a reprint of one of its articles, to
gether with kind permission to print "up to one
third with full credit." After looking over the release,
I am ready to join any academic punitive expedition
that sets out to invade "The Mercury."
The article is one of those subtle presentations of
dogmatism, disguised in the false whiskers of reason
able argument. It. deplores the recognition which is
being given professors in government and business.
It rages at the timid executive who employ consulting
expert.
Throughout its indictment, it carefully skills facts
and figures, but it manages to give the impression
that the total I.Q. of all professors is a decimal. And
it closes on a note of touching yearning for the acade
mician who used to spend his time designing rockets
that would fly to the moon.
J MIGHT point out here that I have no all-absorbing
love for professors as a class. In fact, the nastiest
battle I have ever had with temptation occurred on a
dark night when one of my teachers carelessly stepped
off the curb into the beam of my headlights. Neither
have I any reason to throw bouquets at the faculty;
finals are too far away for them to remember it.
But it annoys me to see anyone working off a gi-udge
with arguments as flimsy as those "The Mercury"
uses. Professors are vulnerable to a great many at
tacks, but this is the first time I have ever seen them
assaulted for taking an interest in practical problems.
* * * *
Designing rockets is probably good entertainment.
But most of us students have no intention of going to
the moon. By this time we have gotten used to the
idea that we will have to spend our life on this planet,
and we prefer to work on immediate problems instead
of dreaming about over-size firecrackers. Rockets to
the moon are devilishly hard to incorporate into ordi
nary business policy.
And then, too, if professors are really as incompe
tent as "The Mercury" would have us believe, I
would like to know what psychological miracle they
work to gain the recognition they do. That, at least,
would be worth teaching.

I find it hard to believe that society is going to
crumble simply because we are beginning to ask
expert advice on complex problems. The professors
may not be able to find the answer, but the law of
averages gives them a better chance of success than
it. gives a politician whose only experience has been
in kissing babies. Scientific analysis seems more sens
ible than trial and error in government and business
as well as in laboratories.
Possibly "The Mercury" is right. More probably
"The Mercury" didn't do so well in its finals when it
was in college.

/ 'OLLEGE professors, in my opinion, are usually

out asking me to defend them. And so it isn't often
that I find myself manning the battlements for the
honor of the faculty. But yesterday "The American
Mercury" sent us a reprint of one of its articles, to
gether with kind permission to print "up to one
third with full credit." After looking over the release,
I am ready to join any academic punitive expedition
that sets out to invade "The Mercury."
The article is one of those subtle presentations of
dogmatism, disguised in the false whiskers of reason
able argument. It. deplores the recognition which is
being given professors in government and business.
It rages at the timid executive who employ consulting
expert.
Throughout its indictment, it carefully skills facts
and figures, but it manages to give the impression
that the total I.Q. of all professors is a decimal. And
it closes on a note of touching yearning for the acade
mician who used to spend his time designing rockets
that would fly to the moon.
J MIGHT point out here that I have no all-absorbing
love for professors as a class. In fact, the nastiest
battle I have ever had with temptation occurred on a
dark night when one of my teachers carelessly stepped
off the curb into the beam of my headlights. Neither
have I any reason to throw bouquets at the faculty;
finals are too far away for them to remember it.
But it annoys me to see anyone working off a gi-udge
with arguments as flimsy as those "The Mercury"
uses. Professors are vulnerable to a great many at
tacks, but this is the first time I have ever seen them
assaulted for taking an interest in practical problems.

Designing rockets is probably good entertainment.
But most of us students have no intention of going to
the moon. By this time we have gotten used to the
idea that we will have to spend our life on this planet,
and we prefer to work on immediate problems instead
of dreaming about over-size firecrackers. Rockets to
the moon are devilishly hard to incorporate into ordi
nary business policy.
And then, too, if professors are really as incompe
tent as "The Mercury" would have us believe, I
would like to know what psychological miracle they
work to gain the recognition they do. That, at least,
would be worth teaching.
