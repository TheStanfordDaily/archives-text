SURPRISE
One of the Branner boys has a girl at another of
Ihe Coast colleges, and the other night at about 11:30
he got. this telegram from her.
It was quite a shock, right at first. It read:
"Oh what a great wide wonderful world this is.
Love.
Junior"
The explanation is lhat the girl had just received
some sort of a junior appointment to her school paper
and was very happy and a Junior and all that.
If you don't mind my spoiling a perfectly good
story.

Six of our boys saw a show in San Jose Friday
night. They had just sot there when three girls moved
in next to them. They* were so good that none of the
guys I talked to could remember the plot of either
picture they saw, but merely that ihey remembered
sitting through two and a half pictures waiting for the
girls to leave.
I don t think I have been clear enough about these
girls. They had class, clothes, and were built by
Fisher. And there was one blonde: young and beauti
ful, and blonde.
When the girls got up to leave, three of the
hoys very cleverly sent the other three after the car.
' hey were going after the girls. Being Stanford
men—a synonym for wolves—they knew nothing
better to do than follow the girls. Simply follow
them, ihey followed them, slowly at first and
then faster and faster, until the girls reached their
car.
How's about it. they said.
The girls got in the car, closed tlie windows, and
locked the car.
The three smart boys waited for the three dumb
ones to ride up leisurely and respectfully in their
car. And while they were waiting, they noticed that
the car, the blonde, and friends were riding in kept
coming around the block.
What's up. they said.
Ihey found out when, iust as their car pulled
up. the blonde stopped in front of the show; and
lo and heboid, three more beautiful girls came
out of the show and got into the car with the
blonde.
Si\ and six. (he hoys said.
fhe> got in their car and started following the
blondes.
Now when they tell this story, it sounds like some
thing of an adventure. Actually it was just six guys
following six ;iloof girls who weren't in the least in
terested.
But to get on. They followed the car, and it came
down the Peninsula, stopping here and there to let
.1 gii I out at her home. When one of them got out at
Palo Alto, there were two left: the blonde and the
gill who \.;is driving. The blonde uot out at Athcrton.
No soap. They followed the last girl home. No soap.
It was a frustrating evening.
If I lie hoys had followed the dialogue in the
mo\ ie they saw at all closely, they would have
found at one place some guv said he had his heart
set on some girl.
Ibat is exactlv the way it was with one of the
hoys. He had bis heart set on the blonde.
ihe next dav he drove up to Athcrton to the
holnde's home to find out her name. Not iust like
that she wasn't going (o get awav from him. Well,
he found her name. He is no longer as sure of
himself.
The girl is T\ Cobb's (laughter.

car.
How's about it. they said.
The girls got in the car, closed tlie windows, and
locked the car.
The three smart boys waited for the three dumb
ones to ride up leisurely and respectfully in their
car. And while they were waiting, they noticed that
the car, the blonde, and friends were riding in kept
coming around the block.
What's up. they said.
Ihey found out when, iust as their car pulled
up. the blonde stopped in front of the show; and
lo and heboid, three more beautiful girls came
out of the show and got into the car with the
blonde.
Si\ and six. (he hoys said.
fhe> got in their car and started following the
blondes.
Now when they tell this story, it sounds like some
thing of an adventure. Actually it was just six guys
following six ;iloof girls who weren't in the least in
terested.
But to get on. They followed the car, and it came
down the Peninsula, stopping here and there to let
.1 gii I out at her home. When one of them got out at
Palo Alto, there were two left: the blonde and the
gill who \.;is driving. The blonde uot out at Athcrton.
No soap. They followed the last girl home. No soap.
It was a frustrating evening.
If I lie hoys had followed the dialogue in the
mo\ ie they saw at all closely, they would have
found at one place some guv said he had his heart
set on some girl.
Ibat is exactlv the way it was with one of the
hoys. He had bis heart set on the blonde.
ihe next dav he drove up to Athcrton to the
holnde's home to find out her name. Not iust like
that she wasn't going (o get awav from him. Well,
he found her name. He is no longer as sure of
himself.
The girl is T\ Cobb's (laughter.
SURPRISE
One of the Branner boys has a girl at another of
Ihe Coast colleges, and the other night at about 11:30
he got. this telegram from her.
It was quite a shock, right at first. It read:
"Oh what a great wide wonderful world this is.
Love.
Junior"
The explanation is lhat the girl had just received
some sort of a junior appointment to her school paper
and was very happy and a Junior and all that.
If you don't mind my spoiling a perfectly good
story.

Six of our boys saw a show in San Jose Friday
night. They had just sot there when three girls moved
in next to them. They* were so good that none of the
guys I talked to could remember the plot of either
picture they saw, but merely that ihey remembered
sitting through two and a half pictures waiting for the
girls to leave.
I don t think I have been clear enough about these
girls. They had class, clothes, and were built by
Fisher. And there was one blonde: young and beauti
ful, and blonde.
When the girls got up to leave, three of the
hoys very cleverly sent the other three after the car.
' hey were going after the girls. Being Stanford
men—a synonym for wolves—they knew nothing
better to do than follow the girls. Simply follow
them, ihey followed them, slowly at first and
then faster and faster, until the girls reached their
car.
