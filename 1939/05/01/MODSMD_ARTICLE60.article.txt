# Texas 'Ferdinand' Walking to Fair
## 
### 

ALL BULL AN*!) A YARD WIDE, "Scandalous John," the 1400-
pound animal shown above, is en route to the New York World's
Fair, making the trip afoot from his native Texas. Stopping off in
Washington, he is greeted by Senator Tom Connally, left, and Repre
sentative George Malion, both of Texas, and Ellen Edgemon, shown
sitting on the animal's back.
