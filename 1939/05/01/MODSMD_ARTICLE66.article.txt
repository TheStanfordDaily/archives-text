# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
As students ol Stanford who have
been taught the necessity for social
justice and fair treatment of labor,
we find ourselves amazed at the
conditions existing iti this supposed
ly enlightened community. We re
fer to the exploitation of the employ
ees of the University, in particular,;
the workers of the Stanford dining
halls. Expressive of the hypocrisy in
our social attitude are the conditions
of work imposed upon many of our
non-student help. Many of these '
men live in crowded basement rooms
in En cilia's basement, which serve as
bedrooms, laundry, and general liv
ing quarters for as many as four
men. No legitimate recreation i.s
provided for them. Most receive $40
monthly, board, and room of a sort
for nine hours daily of drudging ;
work, with absolutely no hope of ;
advancement or salary increase. For
some, it takes 1(5 hours to Ret in
their work, due to splitting of their
shift. All work under the gloomy
realization that they can be easily
replaced by an abundance of cheap
labor. We notice that the Cellar
breaks in about one new man
weekly.
In contrast to these conditions, we
note that the salaries of the women
directors of the hal..Â» average well
over $200 per month, that the Cellar
made approximately $:J5,000 last
year, most of it profit, that freshmen
pay approximately $1.40 daily for
meals, and other like incongruities.
While we realize the desirability
of economy, we object to the pro
cedure of reducing overhead at the
expense of human happiness and
welfare. Bettering the situation for
our non-student help would be an
investment in increased efficiency, a
higher type of work, and good will
from those who work. More import
ant than this, such remedial action

would express in concrete terms our
desire for humane and just condi
tions for labor. Stanford must set
an example of how to adjust the
social order in its own small
sphere, before it can hope to con
tribute towards the better working
of democracy in its larger needs.
