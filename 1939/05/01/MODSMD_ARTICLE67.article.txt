The Editor, Sir:
This opinion i.s directed to the
two infantile brains who reviewed
"Shoemaker's Holiday" last Thurs
day night.
Ash Wilson as the Shoemaker was
as perfect as any college actor could
have been. Firk and Hodge, por
trayed by Merle Meacham and Fred
Rodgers, positively stole the show.
But, according to our child geniuses
from the Daily they were simply
amusing.
If "Jack Dawson did a creditable
job as Roland Lacey," I'm Napoleon.
Melville Mack, I must agree, was
excellent as the Lord Mayor.
After submitting such a miserable
write-up of the play, our junior
high school minded reviewers had
the nerve to announce the dates and
time ol further performances.
One who Truly Enjoyed It
P.S.: Oh, yes, Ducky Henshaw
rides again.
