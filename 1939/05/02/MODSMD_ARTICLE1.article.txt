### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
I) EFORE Europe knocked the Pan-
American Clippers out of the
headlines last September, a great
many Americans regarded Japan as
the probable seat of the next inter
national explosion. Since then the
dictators have been usurping the
spotlight, and the dangerous Islands
across the Pacific almost have been
forgotten.
Today comes a reminder that the
Japanese Empire still is a factor to
lx> reckoned with, perhaps the vital
influence which will determine the
course of world history during the
next few years. The rising sun. of
Tokyo shone yesterday on London
and caused the British government
to halt, to fumble indecisively with
its international policy, and to
withhold action on its alliance with
Russia.
The Soviet insists that it will
take no further part in organizing
tin' anti-llitler bloc unless Eng
land agrees to a military alliance
with France and the U.S.S.R. But
the British are afraid to take the
step, afraid of the menace of
Japan.
With good reason, Mr. Chamber
lain believes that pact with Rus
sia will result in Japan transforming
the anti-Comintern agreement into
a military treaty with Germany and
Italy. At present the document is
nothing more than a vague denun
ciation of communism as a govern
mental form, but it rests on grounds
concrete enough to make it easily
changeable into an anti-democratic
alliance.
r | , HIS is exactly what England does
not want. She has trouble
enough finding means to deal with
Hitler and Mussolini without having
to worry about the Far East. The
Japanese would be an ever-present
danger to her valuable protectorates
and trade privileges in China, as well
as to the British owned city of
Hongkong.
Another reason why the Cham
berlain government may sneak out
of the hack door on the Russians
lies in Poland's and Rumania's
distrust of their powerful eastern
neighbor. Both of these nations
refuse to allow a Red army to oc
cupy their soil fur fear that the
Soviet might decide never to re
tire from this land that once be
longed to the Tsars.
Yesterday in Rome, Signor Mus- |
solini made a number of tempting
proposals to the Rumanian foreign
minister, Grigore Gafencu, in an ef
fort to win him over to the Rome-
Berlin axis. However, Gafencu, ap
parently confident that Britain will
make no alliance with the Soviet,
diplomatically turned down all of
II Duce's offers, and held fast to the j
chain of democratic allies.
4DOLF HITLER'S demands for
the return of Danzig and for a I
strip of territory across the Polish
Corridor have had results—but not j
the kind that he hoped for. Reports
come from Warsaw that the Poles
are considering the establishment of j
a protectorate over Danzig, which J
would insure the port from Nazi ag
gression without war. A militant
press and populace is rejecting the j
demand for a motor road across
Poland's only outlet to the sea.
While Foreign Minister Joseph j
Beck is expected late this week to j
deliver his ofiicial answer to Hit- j
ter's demands and to his denun
ciation of the l!»;;i Polish-German j
pact, the anti-Nazi sentiment j
aroused yesterdaj has warned the
Reich to expect no co-operation
in settling the Danzig-Corridor
tangle.
On one hand Hitler feels that he ;
has a right to absorb a free city I
which hius a population 95 per cent \
German and to establish a territorial j
link between the Reich proper and !
East. Prussia. Poland regards the j
idea as just another Nazi expansion
project, an effort to strangle her
commerce for the benefit of Ger
many, and perhaps an eventual in
vasion of Polish soil.
