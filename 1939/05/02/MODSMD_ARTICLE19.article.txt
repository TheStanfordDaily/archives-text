# Books Sought For Migrants
## 
### 
Since students who visited migra
tory labor camps near Westley last
week-end report urgent need among
the workers for magazines and lit
erature of all types, a drive to secure
reading material was organized by
the Steinbeck Committee at a meet
ing last night.
Students or professors willing to
contribute old magazines or books
for the workers are asked to leave
them at the Y.W.C.A. rooms or to
get in touch with Shirley Okell or
Betty Kline, 882(5.
Anyone interested in the migrant
problem may also attend a panel
to be held in conjunction with the
regular Tuesday night lecture series
May 16, according to Chairman Mary
Beaton, at which John Henderson,
of the Farm Security Administra
tion, will speak. Those who wish
to go on the next trip to nearby
migrant camps, set for Sunday, May
14. should call Stan Fidanquc, Se
quoia.
