II TIIE STANFORD baseball
team — composed entirely of ama
teurs — had not thrown away four
ball games out of a total of 15 con
ference starts, the young Indians
would be sitting on top of the league
today.
But a combination of inexperience
and miscues has left them stranded
in fourth place in a six-team race
with eight wins and seven losses. The
only games they really deserved to
lose were the second of the St.
Mary's trio and the one they lost
to U.S.C. on the local diamond.
Blame the other defeats on lack
of confidence or something like that
because the Indians were as good or
better in the other games lost, ex
cept on the scoreboard. Yep. they
still pay off on the most runs scored,
not on who could have won ii the
breaks had been different.
Before the highly successful trip
south last week, you could often
catch the squad members as tied up
as the very devil before a conference
game. In practice tilts, they were
loose and carefree; yet they won
most of the pre-season games with
comparative ease.
LOOKING TO next year (an old
tradition on the Farm), it might be
interesting to show you what Harry
Wolter will have to start with. Only
Wally deWitt, the lambasting right
fielder, graduates from the first
string. And deWitt, for all his hit
ting strength, had a pretty tough
time of it before he beat out a
couple of sophomores for the start
ing role.
Co-captain A 1 Lazzarone, still the
league's cleverest pitcher from this
slightly biased corner, may or may
not have one more season. Lazza
rone's still wondering if he can go to
business school and give enough
time to baseball practice on the
side. "Cootie" Thompson, the
coast's fastest if not the most sea
soned ace, is only a sophomore.
Bill Masters and Claude Furkitt,
who probably surprised even them
selves with their choice hurling per
formances in the south, also have
two more years apiece. Gil Rahn, a
junior with quite a precollege repu
tation, will be a definite threat next
year as a starting moundsman. If
Rahn were to spend all of winter
and spring quarters in baseball,
where his prospects are extremely
bright, great benefits to himself and
Stanford baseball would probably
be forthcoming.
BILL JAMESON has without a
doubt developed into the league's
outstanding catcher. Only Tony
Lombardi, California's big backstop,
even approaches him in general all
around fineness and ability to han
dle the most sullen of pitchers.
Jameson ended up with an unofficial
average of approximately .'3BO. He
and Bob Templeton both have an
other year.
Three more sophomores, Monte
Ply I at second, Herb Bull at short,
find Ike Boone at third, will all be
back as will Dick Shortall, a junior
alternate with Bull and Boone. Of
these, Boone has probably shown
the most improvement, though the
other three are far advanced from
the caterpillar stage in which they
opened the season.
Then there's Captain Norm Juney
at first or in the outfield, Smoky
Clark, and Bill Adams in the out
field. all three of whom have really
A-l potentialities. Clark had no
peer on the coast this year as a long
distance hitter.
And Thor Peterson, Bob Ditlev
sen, and Glenn South, three sopho
more speed merchants, can play
just about anywhere the occasion
demands with equal precision. May
be they weren't tops as rookies, but
like the rest of their squad broth
ers, whom we will not call young
any more, they have the ability to
shoot the works in '40.

selves with their choice hurling per
formances in the south, also have
two more years apiece. Gil Rahn, a
junior with quite a precollege repu
tation, will be a definite threat next
year as a starting moundsman. If
Rahn were to spend all of winter
and spring quarters in baseball,
where his prospects are extremely
bright, great benefits to himself and
Stanford baseball would probably
be forthcoming.
BILL JAMESON has without a
doubt developed into the league's
outstanding catcher. Only Tony
Lombardi, California's big backstop,
even approaches him in general all
around fineness and ability to han
dle the most sullen of pitchers.
Jameson ended up with an unofficial
average of approximately .'3BO. He
and Bob Templeton both have an
other year.
Three more sophomores, Monte
Ply I at second, Herb Bull at short,
find Ike Boone at third, will all be
back as will Dick Shortall, a junior
alternate with Bull and Boone. Of
these, Boone has probably shown
the most improvement, though the
other three are far advanced from
the caterpillar stage in which they
opened the season.
Then there's Captain Norm Juney
at first or in the outfield, Smoky
Clark, and Bill Adams in the out
field. all three of whom have really
A-l potentialities. Clark had no
peer on the coast this year as a long
distance hitter.
And Thor Peterson, Bob Ditlev
sen, and Glenn South, three sopho
more speed merchants, can play
just about anywhere the occasion
demands with equal precision. May
be they weren't tops as rookies, but
like the rest of their squad broth
ers, whom we will not call young
any more, they have the ability to
shoot the works in '40.
II TIIE STANFORD baseball
team — composed entirely of ama
teurs — had not thrown away four
ball games out of a total of 15 con
ference starts, the young Indians
would be sitting on top of the league
today.
But a combination of inexperience
and miscues has left them stranded
in fourth place in a six-team race
with eight wins and seven losses. The
only games they really deserved to
lose were the second of the St.
Mary's trio and the one they lost
to U.S.C. on the local diamond.
Blame the other defeats on lack
of confidence or something like that
because the Indians were as good or
better in the other games lost, ex
cept on the scoreboard. Yep. they
still pay off on the most runs scored,
not on who could have won ii the
breaks had been different.
Before the highly successful trip
south last week, you could often
catch the squad members as tied up
as the very devil before a conference
game. In practice tilts, they were
loose and carefree; yet they won
most of the pre-season games with
comparative ease.
LOOKING TO next year (an old
tradition on the Farm), it might be
interesting to show you what Harry
Wolter will have to start with. Only
Wally deWitt, the lambasting right
fielder, graduates from the first
string. And deWitt, for all his hit
ting strength, had a pretty tough
time of it before he beat out a
couple of sophomores for the start
ing role.
Co-captain A 1 Lazzarone, still the
league's cleverest pitcher from this
slightly biased corner, may or may
not have one more season. Lazza
rone's still wondering if he can go to
business school and give enough
time to baseball practice on the
side. "Cootie" Thompson, the
coast's fastest if not the most sea
soned ace, is only a sophomore.
