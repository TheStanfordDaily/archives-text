# Boston Teams Lead Circuits
## Bees Whip Giants; Join Red Sox at Top 
### 
NEW YORK. May 1 (UP).—Casey
Stengel's amazing Boston Bees re
placed Cincinnati in the National
League lead today by virtue of their
third straight victory over the New
York Giants, 7-2. The Reds lost to
Pittsburgh, 2-1.
This advance gave the city of Bos
ton representatives at the top of
both major circuits, because the
Red Sox already were tied with
the Yankees for first place in the
American League.
The Bees, who dropped out of a
brief lead on April 23, recaptured
that spot today behind the lour-hit
pitching of Bill Pickerel, a Brooklyn
castoff. Boston collected 10 hits off
Castleman, Lohrman and Walt
Brown, including Tony Cueeinello's
homer with two aboard.
The tail-end Pirates registered
their second win of the season —
after eight straight defeats — with
Johnny Rizzo leading the nine-hit
attack against two Cincinnati lling
ers: Whitey Moore and Bucky
Walters. Moore was wild in the
early innings, allowing five walks.
Rookie Rip Sewell held the Reds to
six hits. The Reds dropped to second
place.
At Chicago, the White Sox of the
American League beat the Cubs of
the National. 4-1, before 22.000 fans
in a benefit exhibition game for
Monte Stratton, the big Sox pitcher
whose mound career ended last fall
when his right leg was shattered by
an accidental pistol shot, necessitat
ing amputation.
