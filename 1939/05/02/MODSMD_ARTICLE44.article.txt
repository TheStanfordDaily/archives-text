# Varsity Trackmen Steam Up For U.S.C. Meet Saturday
## 
### 
Brightened by the return of their ailing stars, Dink Templeton's
traeksters went through ther first practice in direct preparation for next
Saturday's U.S.C. meet on the stadium oval.
It was an encouraging sight to set' Sid Hayes hack in a suit, gingerly
testing his game leg. and Boh Kenyon pole vaulting without any apparent

effects from that ankle he
three weeks ago and which kept him j
out of the Cal meet.
Then there was Ernie Clark, do- j
ing a little jogging after his pro- j
longed session with the flu. Bill I
Hawkins, returned from the South, |
and Huss Wulfi. though still favoring '
a weak ankle, taking a tew jumps at 1
just under 6 feet.
Saturday the greatest track team ;
in America will invade the stadium ;
to meet the Cards, and a glance at
their strength before-hand would do
well in preparing Stanford track tans !
for the shock they will get when the
mighty Trojan horde starts rolling. I
The track events will be covered in !
this issue and at a future date their ]
strength on the Held will be ex
posed.
JEFFREY UNBEATABLE
Though they won't beat the great
Clyde Jeffrey, the Trojan sprinters, :
Barney Willis, Mickey Anderson, j
and the veteran Payton Jordan, will !
certainly press "him to his utmost j
and make it mighty tough for little |
Dick Carew to cut in for any points J
in the dashes. ,
Willii. ran a 9.6 hundred last year j
but hasn't bettered 9.8 during the I
current season.
Anderson, a fugitive from Howard
Jones' football team, dashed 9.9 this j
year, but Jordan has not returned 1
to the form that helped him do 9.7
last year. Willis again leads the trio
in the 220 yard dash with a mark of:
21.4, and it is in this event that'
Carew, if he really hustles, may cut
in for points.
In Erwin Miller and Howard Up
ton, the Trojans have the two best
quarter milers on the coast. Both |
conquerors of California's Don
Watts, these flyers from Troy with
marks of 47.4 and 47.6 will be all
alone at the finish when they tangle j
with the Cards.
Z AM PER INI IN MILE
And in the distances it is the in
comparable Louie Zamperini. More i
like a machine than like a man. the J
great Louie is a pacer and a finisher
both, the best collegiate miler in the
country, and undoubtedly the best
distance runner in the history of
Pacific Coast track.
Louie's best performance is the
4:08.3 mile he ran last year when
beating the mighty Charles Fenske,
his best in the four-lap event this
year was the 4:14.1 mile he ambled
last Saturday in the P.A. meet. In
the half he has accomplished 1:53.2
and in the two-mile, a 9:12.8. Zam
perini has little assistance in the
distances; there is a 1:56 880-yard
man in Ed Powers, a 4:30 miler in
Bob Finch, and a 9:50 two-miler in
Mike Portonova.
The Trojans are definitely "red
hot" in the hurdles, boasting two
timber toppers who are undoubtedly
headed for national honors. They
are Jim Humphreys, who skipped
the high barriers in 14.3 two weeks'

ago and the great low hurdler rod
headed Earl Vickery who, a few
weeks ago, came within one-tenth
of a second of Jesse Owens' world
record when he skimmed the fur
long of barriers in 22.7.
With the fleet Miller and Upton
carrying most of the burden, Coach
Dean Cromwell, has a relay team
that is capable of around 3:15, fast
enough to beat the Indians by
yards.

Saturday's U.S.C. meet on the stadium oval.
It was an encouraging sight to set' Sid Hayes hack in a suit, gingerly
testing his game leg. and Boh Kenyon pole vaulting without any apparent

effects from that ankle he
three weeks ago and which kept him j
out of the Cal meet.
Then there was Ernie Clark, do- j
ing a little jogging after his pro- j
longed session with the flu. Bill I
Hawkins, returned from the South, |
and Huss Wulfi. though still favoring '
a weak ankle, taking a tew jumps at 1
just under 6 feet.
Saturday the greatest track team ;
in America will invade the stadium ;
to meet the Cards, and a glance at
their strength before-hand would do
well in preparing Stanford track tans !
for the shock they will get when the
mighty Trojan horde starts rolling. I
The track events will be covered in !
this issue and at a future date their ]
strength on the Held will be ex
posed.
JEFFREY UNBEATABLE
Though they won't beat the great
Clyde Jeffrey, the Trojan sprinters, :
Barney Willis, Mickey Anderson, j
and the veteran Payton Jordan, will !
certainly press "him to his utmost j
and make it mighty tough for little |
Dick Carew to cut in for any points J
in the dashes. ,
Willii. ran a 9.6 hundred last year j
but hasn't bettered 9.8 during the I
current season.
Anderson, a fugitive from Howard
Jones' football team, dashed 9.9 this j
year, but Jordan has not returned 1
to the form that helped him do 9.7
last year. Willis again leads the trio
in the 220 yard dash with a mark of:
21.4, and it is in this event that'
Carew, if he really hustles, may cut
in for points.
In Erwin Miller and Howard Up
ton, the Trojans have the two best
quarter milers on the coast. Both |
conquerors of California's Don
Watts, these flyers from Troy with
marks of 47.4 and 47.6 will be all
alone at the finish when they tangle j
with the Cards.
Z AM PER INI IN MILE
And in the distances it is the in
comparable Louie Zamperini. More i
like a machine than like a man. the J
great Louie is a pacer and a finisher
both, the best collegiate miler in the
country, and undoubtedly the best
distance runner in the history of
Pacific Coast track.
Louie's best performance is the
4:08.3 mile he ran last year when
beating the mighty Charles Fenske,
his best in the four-lap event this
year was the 4:14.1 mile he ambled
last Saturday in the P.A. meet. In
the half he has accomplished 1:53.2
and in the two-mile, a 9:12.8. Zam
perini has little assistance in the
distances; there is a 1:56 880-yard
man in Ed Powers, a 4:30 miler in
Bob Finch, and a 9:50 two-miler in
Mike Portonova.
The Trojans are definitely "red
hot" in the hurdles, boasting two
timber toppers who are undoubtedly
headed for national honors. They
are Jim Humphreys, who skipped
the high barriers in 14.3 two weeks'

ago and the great low hurdler rod
headed Earl Vickery who, a few
weeks ago, came within one-tenth
of a second of Jesse Owens' world
record when he skimmed the fur
long of barriers in 22.7.
With the fleet Miller and Upton
carrying most of the burden, Coach
Dean Cromwell, has a relay team
that is capable of around 3:15, fast
enough to beat the Indians by
yards.
Brightened by the return of their ailing stars, Dink Templeton's
traeksters went through ther first practice in direct preparation for next
Saturday's U.S.C. meet on the stadium oval.
