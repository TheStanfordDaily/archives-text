# For the Kids, Maybe?

\\"K yrY God! We've forgotten the kids."
IVI Thus someday this week some mem
ber of the Convalescent Home Drive commit
tee may wake up and remember the purpose
for which he's labored these last few days and
weeks: "To give a day of sunshine."
So far, this year's drive has been a business
proposition—provision of entertainment at a
high cost for a "worthy purpose." And in the
hullabaloo of the Soph Carnival, Tag Day, and
today's Strawberry Brunch, Stanford may have
lost sight of why for one week it turns its pock
ets inside out.
Just what is that story?
Exactly 20 years ago, the dream of David
Charles Gardner, then chaplain of the Univer
sity, became actuality. The mansion of Gover
nor and Mrs. Stanford was turned into a Con
valescent Home for children.
Since then, Stanford and Stanford's friends
have each year managed to come a little nearer
his ultimate goal: the time when the Home need
not limit the number of children it admits to 70
or 80, but the time when as many of the tired,
worn bodies as need helpful care and nourish
ment and rest can be accommodated.
Each year, it has been the practice for Stan
ford to remind itself of this goal. This year—
so far—it has remained unnoticed by every
body, including the committeemen in charge.
For this reason, and this reason alone, Stan
ford might well stop in the midst of today's
festivities and remember stories of kids like
Johnny.
Johnny, nine years old, came to the Home
some time ago with heart trouble. Johnny's
family was too poor to dress him in anything
but old inner tubes from tires. Contracting rub
ber cut off the circulation of his blood. It left
him apparently disabled for life.
Today, Johnny is almost well—he can play
with the rest of the kids, catch as many "Injuns"
as the next cowboy. Soon, he'll be able to go
home well. And happy.
Sunshine, rest, and care did it for him.
It will for many others.
