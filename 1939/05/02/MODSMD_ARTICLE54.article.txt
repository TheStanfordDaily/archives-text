# Still an Irritation

JERUSALEM has the Holy Sepulcher; Paris,
J the Arc de Triomphe; London, the Cenotaph
—and Stanford has the Library fountain.
Late last Sunday night a watchman making
his rounds rubbed his eyes. He was wide
awake and he knew he hadn't been drinking,
but there it was. The fountain had been trans
formed into a gigantic piece of old-fashioned
strawberry shortcake.
One thought flashed through his mind, the
standing order of the Corporation Yard to de
stroy immediately any ornamentation or em
bellishment that might be added to the con
troversial cuspidor. Truly it was a shame to
waste those melon-like strawberries, that ton
of whipped cream, but orders are orders.
Yeterday when the hard-working members
of the May Brunch committee arrived at the
Library, they found their advertisement torn
and crumpled, each individual strawberry
plucked from its setting, and the wrecked mass
lying on the lawn. Their indignation was right
eous; the Administration had granted them
permission to use the fountain for publicity this
week.
Investigation revealed that an inter-depart
mental memorandum had been sent to the Cor
poration Yard, that through an oversight Sun
day night's zealous watchman had not been
informed. The University was properly apolo
getic.
It was a wistful scene yesterday afternoon
when three Corporation Yard workmen were
piecing together the scraps of strawberry short
cake. After today's Brunch it will be torn down
again.
The source of all the excitement lies in the
University's standing order. Evidently Stan
ford is a little self-conscious about the Library
fountain.—L. L.
