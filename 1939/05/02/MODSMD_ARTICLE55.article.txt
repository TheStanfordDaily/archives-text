# Voice from the Past

### 
AS a whimsical commentary on Stanford, the
Convalescent Home Drive, Tag Day, and
spring in general, the following was written
yesterday by a former associate editor of The
Daily:
"Now is the time for the meek to inherit the
earth."
Or so they have always said.
But last night a meek graduate came back
to his Alma Mater and inherited only the ill
gotten gains of a once-fertile idea.
He hadn't been at Stanford for a long time.
He was happy to be back. A lovely blonde
thing smiled and came toward him with a
greeting on her lips. He was happy.
And then she slipped out a tag and fastened
it to him and smiled and said he owed her a
quarter. And he paid her and was sad and
remembered that there would have been no
such greeting if he hadn't fathered Tag Day in
the meek days of the past.
And he went home and wept.â€”J. R.
