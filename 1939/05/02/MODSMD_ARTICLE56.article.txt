THE HEEL YOU SAY

WOME days ago I remarked that it looked as though
this year's Convalescent Home Drive leaders were
going to use tactics adapted to a charitable project
and would not resort to the usual combination of black
mail and terrorism. Yesterday I found proof that my
dream was to be realized; yesterday Stanford's drive
ridden campus received its Magna Cai~ta.
The chairman of the Tag Day campaign announced
in a simple but stately proclamation, "If any person
does not buy a tag today, we aren't going to call him
or her a 'heel' as the salesmen did last year. That's
not the spirit of this year's Tag Day sale."

To freshmen or outsiders this may sound like a
simple restatement of an established right. But those
of us who remember drives of the past know that it
represents a real victory. Last year, for instance, the
chairman of Tag Day declared that anyone who didn't
buy a tag was a heel; and she stood by her proclama
tion even though the populace muttered and the cry
of "Tyranny" was raised on the Quad.
The whole question is very close to being absurd,
but it is a good illustration of the way some drive
leaders let their enthusiasm kick their sense of values
around. Campaigns at Stanford have a nasty way of
turning into holy crusades; and campaigners often
give the impression that if it weren't for a bunch of
silly laws they would use boiling oil instead of burn
ing comment.

As I pointed out last spring, the you're-a-heel-if
you-don't-buy argument is really nothing but logical
acrobatics. If you don't get a tag, presumably you're
a heel. But if you're already a heel, buying a tag
won't remove the quality of heelishness. If you're not
a heel, then you don't have to buy a tag to keep from
being one. But all this is beside the point.
The important thing is that even enthusiasm can't
excuse shakedown tactics that would make a racket
eer blush. And the plea of a worthy cause can't justify
calling a man a heel simply because he elects to keep
his dime in his own pocket.

No one questions the value of the Convalescent
Home Drive, and most of us are willing to kick the
props from under our budgets supporting it. But when
we contribute we like to think that, we are doing a
gracious act, not that we are paying blackmail to keep
from being labelled a heel.
Evidently our current drive leaders have grasped
this fundamental point in the philosophy of cam
paigning. At least they have abandoned the old robber
baron policies. Once again we are a free people.
