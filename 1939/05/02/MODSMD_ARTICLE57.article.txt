TEACHER'S PET
(But that has nothing to do with this story.)
The trouble with teachers is that they have to
know more than their students—or make their students
think they know more.
The trouble with being an education major is that
you end up as a teacher and have to spend the rest
of your life knowing more than grammar school kids.
Which means learning all of the stuff that the kids are
supposed to learn; and every now and then one of
the kids does learn what he was supposed to learn
and if you are a teacher and don't know the stuff
yourself, you are in a fine fix.
One of our Farm education major girls is head
ing straight for trouble along that line. Unless she
gets a kindergarten job, she's through.
It is not only that she cannot do elementary
arithmetic. She has trouble with geography. She
was getting applied practice in pointing with a stick
the other day in her geography class, where they
were discussing the timber country in Canada,
which is the sort of stufT they feed to grammar
school kids, if you will remember.
She was up at the blackboard with a long,
pointed stick.
"Now, Suzie, show the class where the timber lands
are in Canada," the education instructor told her.
She pointed her long stick to Montreal.
"Yes," the instructor said, "but be more explicit."
The girl traced a little circle around Montreal.
"Oh, it extends farther than that!" the instructor
admonished. .
Hesitatingly, the girl enlarged her circle.
The instructor looked at her closely. "Suzie,
don't you know where Canada is?" she asked sud
denly.
"No," Suzie said, and put on a dunce cap and
sat in the corner until the class was over and
"teacher" let her go out and smoke a cigarette.

MATCH PLAY
A lot of the boys who are taking part in this off
campus part of the Convalescent Home Drive were
quite concerned about which girls would be their
partners in the canvassing.
I hope they were all satisfied—but one of the girls
wasn't. All yesterday she was frantically calling chair
men and subchairmen and committee members to tell
them she had been mismatched.
"I can't possibly work with that person," she said.
"It would be too. too embarrassing. We used to go
steady."
Yeah. Way back last week.

WITH*A FEZ
A Stanford boy who was in Paris this summer had
the questionable pleasure of overhearing an English
lady point to him and say to a friend of hers. "And
there, my dear, is an Egyptian."
