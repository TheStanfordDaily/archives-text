# Joys of Convalescent Home Told in Letters

### JEAN NOWELL ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
I am feeling fine. I eat lots of things. I pray for Papa and
you and Tony. ... I am happy."
So w rites Angclo of his life at the Convalescent Home.
This is one of the concrete testimonies of childish satisfaction intro
duced through letters written from the Home to family and friends.

Surrounded by the delightful ani-4
mal drawings of Wolo and a clean, |
comfortable atmosphere which their 1
own homes do not afford them, 80 j
youngsters between the ages of 4 j
and 12 live at Stanford's Convales- |
cent Home, and enjoy an active,
healthy existence bonded for them j
in part by the proceeds from each !
year's drive among Stanford stu- j
dents.
In browsing through the letter
files kept at the Home, it is not '
hard to see that the food quantity ,
and quality angle has staggered
I more than one hungry little waif.
Dolores, who must, have a tre
| mendous capacity, relates, after
\ Thanksgiving Day,"I had five help
ings of turkey (with plenty of
dressing), two ;md a half potatoes j
I (with gravy), four spoonfuls of cran- j
1 berry sauce, a cup of jelly beans,,
! a chocolate thrkey and a dish of ice j
cream. After that I couldn't hold
anything else."
The letters, which, in their en- !
tiroty are worthy of collection in a!
folio, also reflect the fact that normal I
kid interests have not been sup- j
pressed hy a too-perfect environ- '
ment. Running through the loiters i
are references to model airplanes, I
scrapbooks, picture puzzles, and foot - |
ball. Everything seems to point to j
the fact that here is certainly a live- j
wire bunch. There arc probably (
many antics which never get in ;
those letters home.
Up to this point everything said
m praise of the Home Drive has j
| eventually gotten back to the fact
that "it's .1 worthy cause!" This is
a trite, meaningless phrase the j
! sharp, clear connotation of which is
realized only when one can come to
a real understanding of what the!
Home means to the kids who de- ;
pend on it.

cream. After that I couldn't hold
anything else."

tiroty are worthy of collection in a!
folio, also reflect the fact that normal I
kid interests have not been sup- j

are references to model airplanes, I
scrapbooks, picture puzzles, and foot - |
ball. Everything seems to point to j
the fact that here is certainly a live- j
wire bunch. There arc probably (
many antics which never get in ;
those letters home.
Up to this point everything said

that "it's .1 worthy cause!" This is
a trite, meaningless phrase the j
