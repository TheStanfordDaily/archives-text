NEW YORK, May 1 (UP).â€”Trad
ing in stocks tapered off today to
around the lowest level in five years
as traders withdrew to the sidelines
pending clarification of the interna
tional political situation.
Prices drifted through a narrow
range and closed irregularly lower.
Only a few issues had changes of a
point or more.
