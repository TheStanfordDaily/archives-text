j The Editor, Sir:
Having walked by the Deke house
for the past three years, and having
had the honor of exposing myself
I quite bravely to the more or less
| inaccurate shots of the "handsome
sharpshooters" numerous times, I
would like to make a comment on
the situation.
I have always found that small
; children usually get tired of their
I playthings very soon. But in this
j chronic case, it seems that the Dekes
| will never tire and will probably
I keep "bagging" for the rest of their
j lives.
I Secondly, row-man Cobbs is very
j susceptible to colds. Please pardon
him if he tries to keep his feet dry
by walking on the other side of the
street. Also Sorority Sal and her
sisters keep that side of the street
rather crowded. Girls have to take
showers sometimes and it's a rather
dry season.
