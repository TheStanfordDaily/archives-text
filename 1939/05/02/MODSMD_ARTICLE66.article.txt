# A 						BRUNCH OF TROUBLE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The inefficiency of Stanford's
Corporation Yard is colossal. After
securing permission, in the form of
a written statement, to use the
| library fountain for publicity pur
! poses in the annual Convalescent
Home Drive, committee workers
tossed up a skillfully complete rep-
I lica of a strawberry shortcake, com
j plete with whipped ceram.
Monday morning saw the thing
completely demolished. Questioned
| about its destruction, those-who
seemed-to-be-in-charge said that
orders had been given workmen to
take it away. "We didn't know that
you had permission for it," was the
general excuse. Yet written com
munication was made from Admin
istration Building to Corporation
Yard.
Just as a parting shot, Corp Yard
officials graciously assured, 'You
can put up another one if you want
to. We won't bother it this time."
No wonder campus committee
| chairmen have such a sweet time
promoting events. The co-operation
I they receive s a thing to marvel at.
