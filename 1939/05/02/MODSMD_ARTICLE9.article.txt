# Branner Sea Horses Exonerated
## Council Will Overlook Ruckus; Hall Men Promise to Behave 
### 
With a keynote directed at meet
ing each other half way, Men's Coun
cil and eight Branner men, repre
senting the hall in general, met yes
terday, informally discussed the re
cent Branner flooding, and came to
the ultimate decision that no penal
ties were in order for the hallmen.
Going out of their way to reach a
just decision, Council members ex
pressed the opinion that "since this
is the first time such action has been
taken in the hall, the Council felt
it was not their duty to exact large
penalties."
lIALLMEN HUMBLE
Reciprocating, the representative
hallmen acquiesced, and admitted
that they were sorry and that in the
future Men's Council could expect
only co-operation from the Branner
men.
Reason for yesterday's Council-
Branner bull session was, in brief,
the water battle royal which took
place in Branner Hall, Monday eve
ning, April 17, when fun-loving
hallmen broke out firehoses and pro
ceeded to participate in the biggest
hall water fight of the year.
THE DELUGE
After pouring two inches of water
in Branner corridors, water which
eventually seeped through the plas
ter ceilings into the lobby, the fight
ers moved on to Toyon, but were
disbanded and kept from any further
damaging actions by the Toyon
custodian, Bob Krupp.
Contemplating the action and the
damage, Dean Bunn next morning
stated that the matter "was strictly
a student problem, and as such it
would be referred to Men's Council.
Secondary matter up before Coun
cil yesterday was concerned with a
letter received from the comptroller's
office stating that in the future no
banners would be allowed to be
posted on the campus except on
Lasuen street, Union corner, and at
the post office.
