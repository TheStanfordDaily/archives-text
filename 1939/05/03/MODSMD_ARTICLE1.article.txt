### LARRY LIVINCSTON 
IT WAS during the infancy of the
Industrial Revolution, 150 years
ago, that the first President of the
United States warned his back
woods nation against becoming en
tangled in European affairs. To
many of those who saw this country
enter the Great War in 1917, his
words are those of a well-meaning
idealist, ignorant of the closely
knit world that was to come.
Still there arc in the United
States today a largo number of peo
ple whose beliefs earmark them as
isolationists, men who think that
if the government minds its own
business we still can manage to stay
out of war. What is to be done when
the nation's controlling financial in
terests howl for. protection of their
investments abroad, what, is to hap
pen when American neutrality is
violated, when our ships are sunk
and our citizens killed, they do not
say.
* * *
From Franklin I). Roosevelt's
recent peace proposal and his fre
quent condemnations of the ag
gressions and inhumanities of the
dictatorships, it is obvious that he
does not believe it possible for
the United Stales to remain aloof
from the turmoil in Europe.
But there are interests in the gov
ernment that think that by with
drawing into its .shell the country
can save itself from war. Leader
of the neutrality opposition is Cali
fornia's venerable Senator Hiram
Johnson, a man who, after viewing
both the practical and ideological
aspects of the situation, is convinced
that George Washington is still right
in 1939.
❖ *
when Senator Bank
head mentioned the adjourn
ment of Congress in the near future,
Johnson came forth with a signifi
cant. protest. He demanded that the
national legislature remain in ses
sion in order to minimize the pos- i
.sibility of the United States being j
involved in a European war.
The neutrality bloc, with a nuni- j
her of anti-New Dealers in agree
ment, believes that if we go to war
to knock over the dictatorships, we
will end up with a totalitarian
state ourselves. Lincoln and Wil
son both were dictators for a
time, hut their powers ended with
the peace treaties. This time John
son is not so certain that the na
tion would return to democracy
when the conflict came to an end.
* * *
r fast-moving twentieth cen
tury world is ripe for change,
and fascism is perhaps the most con
venient of several yawning pitfalls.
Those who dislike Roosevelt, can
easily imagine him as an American
dictator—and this they use as an
argument against his international
policy.
Those who are opposed to enter
ing a war, whether for the protec
tion of Wall St reet investments in
Europe, or in retaliation for the loss
of 100 American lives in the sinking
of a neutral ship, regard with alarm
each step the President takes in the
direction of transatlantic interfer
ence. But gradually they are com
ing to realize that with the conti
nents only hours apart it will be a
miracle if the United States is able
to keep out of the next conflict.
* * *
Realizing the danger that exists,
the national government is prepar
ing for any and all eventualities.
Under consideration at present is
a drive for world-supremacy in |
aviation research. This is a vital i
necessity if our expanded system
of defenses is not to he inferior
to Germany's, according to Col.
Charles A. Lindbergh, who is ad- j
vising the Department of War.
The United States has dropped to I
fifth place in this field it once led; j
Germany is first today, with Britain
second, Italy and France tied for
third and Soviet. Russia fourth.
