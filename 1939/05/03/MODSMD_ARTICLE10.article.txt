# Knights Walk Off in Night
## 
### 
And the Arabian Knights got
up and walked away!
Sure they did. At least many
of the knights on the Masque
Ball posters — and the posters
too—have disappeared from
bulletin boards and display
places on the campus.
But the committee needs
them, not only for art but, also
for art's sake. They were made
by art. students and will be re
quired in their classes. Any
Masque Ball posters that are
found may be returned at the
Lagunita desk.
