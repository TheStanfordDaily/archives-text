# Convalescent Home Colors Dreary Life of 80 Children
## 
### BETTY KLINE 
Specially designed desks fitting over each bed enable every child to
keep up his regular school work during his stay at the Stanford Convales
cent Home, according to Mrs. Ruth Atwood. director.
All schools from which the 80 inmates come accept with full credit |
studies done in the Home, she explained. A regular schoolroom is provided

for the 30-odd "runabouts,"
whose convalescence has reached
the point where they can be on their
feet.
Each group of children has a reg
ular tutor, and the curriculum is
complete even to an orchestra in
which the children themselves play
the various instruments, accompa
nied by a piano which is rolled into
the ward.
CLINIC RECOMMENDATIONS
A "happy medium" between the
extremes of hospital and home, the
Convalescent Home admits children
originally as bed-patients, after
they have been recommended
through doctors in various local
clinics. Medical Director Dr. Harold
Faber checks on the individual cases,
and if a child is accepted for treat
ment a two-weeks isolation period
is necessary before he can become
a part of one of the regular con
valescent units, Mrs. Atwood stated.
Complete medical and dental serv
ice for every child is part of the
answer to the student's query as to
where goes the $2.43 which he gives
for a "day of sunshine." Much of
the medical service is donated by
doctors who make daily visits, but
graduate registered nurses are kept
on duty 24 hours a day at the chil
dren's call, and medical equipment
and supplies add to the cost end of
the Home's financial set-up. Every
child who stays at the Home has his
teeth entirely put into shape before
his return home, Mrs. Atwood
added.
CASE HISTORY
On his release from the Home each
child is referred back to the clinic
which originally recommended him,
together with a file of his complete
case history, and the clinic is re
quested to continue any follow-up
work which is necessary in the case.
Although the cost per child per day
in the Home is not so low as that
quoted by a few other institutions,
Mrs. Atwood declared, it must be
understood that the Home's figures
include such costs as insurance, up
keep of buildings, and heating and
electricity, as well as the mainte
nance of the spotlessly sanitary con
dition of the entire place, the strik
ing feature of which almost every
visitor is well aware.
MINIATURE PLAYHOUSE
Other features of the Home in
clude a Tarzan-like tree house on
the outdoor playground, as well as
a miniature playhouse donated by
Mrs. Louis Stern. The playhouse,
which once belonged to Mrs. Stern's
daughter, is completely furnished,
including electric light and plumb
ing fixtures.
The basement of the home has
been transformed into a huge, lino
leum-floored playroom, with plenty
of space for recreation on rainy
days. On the walls of the playroom,
as well as in the dining hall, are to
be found the famous Wolo murals,
while several elaborate collections of
foreign and old-fashioned dolls, do
nated by Mrs. Timothy Hopkins and
others, are also on display in the
playroom.
