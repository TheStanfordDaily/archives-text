# Cardinals Appointments To Be Excom-Controlled; Reorganization Planned
## Thompson Admits Clique Control, Asks Parent Organization to Help Bring Lost Child' Back to Fold 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Attempting to "democratize" Cardinals, Ex Committee last night took
steps to restrict the activity organization's least democratic aspcct—self
perpetuation.
Nine positions in the activity organization— to he filled this spring—
will he filled hy Ex Committee from a list of 13 or 14 names to he suh-'

mitted by Cardinals, it was de-.
cided.
"I grant that Cardinals is undemo
cratic," President Roy Thompson
told the committee. "But I feel that
it has to be undemocratic in order
to fulfill the duties that it is called
on to fulfill."
Denying the truth of this state
ment, Annabelle Clark said, "I can
not see any reason why any com
mittee should be undemocratic."
COMPLAINTS ANSWERED
Thompson precipitated the dis
cussion when he appeared before
the committee to answer widespread
complaints that his organization is
undemocratic. Presumably he de
sired to clear the air before time
comes to select next year's Cardinals
members.
In past years this selection has
been made entirely by Cardinals,
subject only to routine approval by
Ex Committee.
Thompson deplored the fact that
"Cardinals no longer has the old,
friendly tie-in with Ex Committee."
He pointed out that membership in
his organization has come to be con
sidered an honor or reward rather
than a service position.
TOO MANY ACTIVITIES
This is due, he suggested, to the
fact that Cardinals in the past have
been in many other activities, that
they have been too busy to give the
job adequate attention. He said the
competent, relatively obscure stu
dent would dc the one sought hence
forth for membership in the organi
zation.
The reform .of selection of new
members arose out of Jim Barnum's
assertion that "Cardinals' choices are
a select group of people they happen
to know." He suggested a sub
committee of Ex Committee investi
gate these selections and report the
following week.
NEPOTISM CHARGED
Andy Stojkovich suggested that
Quad, Election Board, and Daily
appointments perhaps should be
more closely controlled by Ex Com
mittee.
"It isn't democratic for the Quad
and Election Board always to be
controlled by the same houses," he
declared.
It also was suggested the organi
zation's president be made an ex
oflicio member of Ex Committee.
Thi.s would require a constitutional
amendment, which could be voted
upon at a special election later this
quarter.
"It's easy to put an cx-officio
member on, but it's hard to get him
off," opined Bill Turner.
Other business of the meeting fol
lows:
SOCIAL REGULATIONS: Betty
Davis, making a preliminary report
on findings of her committee, sug
gested by-law changes to give Ex
Committee more control over off
campus dances.
Her recommendations included
prohibition of overnight dances,
complete reports following dances
given by alumni, requiring of dance
date applications at least two weeks
in advance of the date.
Killefer spoke. "What's all this
objection to overnight dances? I
don t. see that we should run this
place like a seminary."
