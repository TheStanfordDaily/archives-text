# Gratis to Come Back to Visit Old Hangouts
## 'Old Crowd' to Meet On Campus Saturday For University Day 
### 
They like to come back to the
Farm. They like to see how the old
school has changed. And most of all,
they like to see each other again.
At the annual University Day,
which will be held this Saturday,
Stanford's alumni from the old-tim
ers who left the old school way
back in 1892 down to the mere
youngsters who were in last year's
seniors will congregate for their
yearly reunion.
WAR REUNION
The "do you remembers" should
fly thick and fast at the '18 to '21
reunion. These alumni arc members
of the war generation. Most of the
men entered school in 1915 or 1916,
then enlisted, went overseas or into
training camps, and returned to
graduate in the '19, '20, or '21 classes.
Many of the wives of this particular
group were married when they were
freshmen or "sophomores, followed
their husbands to camps, or to
France, and then returned with them
to graduate.
They will attend the regular
meeting and lunch, but will hold a
special cocktail party and dinner at
the Menlo Country Club that night.
OLD HANGOUT
Returning for their first anniver
sary will be the Class of 1934. Un
der ihe chairmanship of Dave Pack
ard and Don Tatum, their special
get-together will be held to Stone's
Cellar, which was their particular
campus hang-out.
The Class of 1909 has been secre
tive about the plot they have brew
ing to celebrate their 30th anniver
sary, but according to the rumors
that have drifted into the alumni
office, there are plans afoot which
include a dinner Friday night at the
Yerba Buena Club on Treasure
Island.
ASSOCIATION MEETING
Plans for the day, which will in
clude all the alumni, consist of an
association meeting in the Little
Theater, at which the alumni coun
cil for the coming year will be
elected, the alumni assembly, at
which Dr. Wilbur will deliver his
welcoming speech, the alumni
luncheon in Union Court, the Stan
ford-U.S.C. track meet in the sta
dium, and a banquet in Union Hall.
Robert A. (Bones) Hamilton,
alumni secretary, is in chai'ge of the
entire affair, though each individual
class has been free to make any ar
rangements it chooses.

reunion. These alumni arc members
of the war generation. Most of the
men entered school in 1915 or 1916,
then enlisted, went overseas or into
training camps, and returned to
graduate in the '19, '20, or '21 classes.
Many of the wives of this particular
group were married when they were
freshmen or "sophomores, followed
their husbands to camps, or to
France, and then returned with them
to graduate.
They will attend the regular
meeting and lunch, but will hold a
special cocktail party and dinner at
the Menlo Country Club that night.
OLD HANGOUT
Returning for their first anniver
sary will be the Class of 1934. Un
der ihe chairmanship of Dave Pack
ard and Don Tatum, their special
get-together will be held to Stone's
Cellar, which was their particular
campus hang-out.
The Class of 1909 has been secre
tive about the plot they have brew
ing to celebrate their 30th anniver
sary, but according to the rumors

clude all the alumni, consist of an
association meeting in the Little

elected, the alumni assembly, at
which Dr. Wilbur will deliver his
welcoming speech, the alumni
luncheon in Union Court, the Stan
ford-U.S.C. track meet in the sta
dium, and a banquet in Union Hall.
Robert A. (Bones) Hamilton,
alumni secretary, is in chai'ge of the
entire affair, though each individual
class has been free to make any ar
rangements it chooses.
They like to come back to the
Farm. They like to see how the old
school has changed. And most of all,
they like to see each other again.
At the annual University Day,
which will be held this Saturday,
Stanford's alumni from the old-tim
ers who left the old school way
back in 1892 down to the mere
youngsters who were in last year's
seniors will congregate for their
yearly reunion.
WAR REUNION
