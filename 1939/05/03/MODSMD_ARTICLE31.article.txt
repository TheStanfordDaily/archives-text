Though Coach Dink Temnlcton concedes the Trojans the majority of
the points for events on the cinder path, he expects his pupils to at least j

split the field events with those su-<
permen from the South.
Couch Dean Cromwell has two
potential Olympic Games javelin
throwers in Bob Peoples and Hugo
DcGroot. Stanford's Bill Braheny,
with a mark of 211 feet, would be
considered tops in any league except
in this one which finds Peoples with
a record of 234 feet and DeGroot at
227.
However, Troy has no shot putters
to match the Indians' "52 - foot
twins," Bill Wohle and Stan An
dersen. Bob Fisher is their leading
contender with a toss only slightly
over 50 feet.

With the injury of John Wilson, i
6-foot 7-inch high jumper, Crom- !
well must depend on George Carter
at around 6 l't. 4 in. and on Clark i
Mallery.
A mighty close duel is promised in
the broad jump when Stanford's j
Ray Brown tangles with the Trojan 1
Bill Broomfield. Broomfield once
did 24 l'eet, however has not bettered
23 ft. 5 in. this year and the fast-im
proving Brown should take him.

Irving Howe at 13 it. 10 in., the |
invaders appear a cinch for 8 points ■
