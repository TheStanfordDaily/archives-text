PICKING ALL-STAR teams in!
any sport is a pastime which should
be discouraged. Only morons and
their younger brothers, those imbe
ciles who eat bugs, snakes, and
leeches, can be properly put in the
same class with those twerps who
insist on picking the best in every
thing, be it table tennis or baseball.
We hate bugs and abhor leeches;
yet today we find ourselves ready
to pick a conference baseball team
and offer no excuse for our lack of
judgment. We like the men we have
picked and hereby award them
Slants' annual batch of velvet slid
ing pads.
How would you like to face this
crew?
Catcher—Jameson, Stanford
First base—Wright, St. Mary's
Second base—Duezabou. California
Third base—Holley, L.S.C.
Short stop—Tran, St. Mary's
Left field—Clark. Stanford
Center field—Hirschon, U.C.L.A.
Right field — McNamara, Califor
nia
Picking one champion pitcher for
a crew like that is next to impos
sible, so we have selected four
moundsmen, the average number of
starters on an ordinary club.
This quartet includes: Brewer of
U.S.C.. Merrill of St. Mary's (be
cause he always hits a superb peak
against Stanford), and our own
Lazzarone and Thompson.
Thompson is only a sophomore
and therefore has to be excused for
the few faux-pas he made during
the season. When he was cooled
down and in top physical condition,
he couldn't be beaten. He has the
fastest ball in the league, a swell
drop, and an improving curve ball.

Lazzarone, the smallest regular
hurler in the conference, has the
experience and calmness that goes
to make a big league pitcher. His
minute stature is unusual in a first
rate moundsman, however, Lazz's
earned run average is precariously
close to the top of the league, if not
the best. Whether there were 16
errors or none, he seemed content
not to worry too much about the
situation.
Merrill, Stanford's prize jinx,
and Brewer were pitching for cham
pionship teams and had two excep
tionally good infields behind them.
Stanford's infield often smelled to
high heaven, sometimes played er
rorless ball. Had they played tight
ball all season, no one would have
questioned our nominating both
Thompson and Lazzarone for all
star posts.

Well, this picking the stars is so
much fun we might just as well go
further and award more precious
plaudits. Would anyone question us
in the following selections, most of
whom are purely team honors and
non-inclusive of the rest of the
league?
Best infield—St. Mary's
Best team leader—Hooks Devauers.
Cal
And for Stanford alone:
Most improved player—lke Boone
Most devastating hitter — Smoke
Clark
Best throwing arm—Norm Juney
: Most rasping voice—Herb "Frog"
Bull
I Quietest voice—Dick Shortall
Highest voice—Monte Pfyl
Fastest outfielder — Thor Peter -
I son

Best hunter—No such animal
Fastest infielder—Cookie South

PICKING ALL-STAR teams in!
any sport is a pastime which should
be discouraged. Only morons and
their younger brothers, those imbe
ciles who eat bugs, snakes, and
leeches, can be properly put in the
same class with those twerps who
insist on picking the best in every
thing, be it table tennis or baseball.
We hate bugs and abhor leeches;
yet today we find ourselves ready
to pick a conference baseball team
and offer no excuse for our lack of
judgment. We like the men we have
picked and hereby award them
Slants' annual batch of velvet slid
ing pads.
How would you like to face this
crew?
Catcher—Jameson, Stanford
First base—Wright, St. Mary's
Second base—Duezabou. California
Third base—Holley, L.S.C.
Short stop—Tran, St. Mary's
Left field—Clark. Stanford
Center field—Hirschon, U.C.L.A.
Right field — McNamara, Califor
nia
Picking one champion pitcher for
a crew like that is next to impos
sible, so we have selected four
moundsmen, the average number of
starters on an ordinary club.
This quartet includes: Brewer of
U.S.C.. Merrill of St. Mary's (be
cause he always hits a superb peak
against Stanford), and our own
Lazzarone and Thompson.
Thompson is only a sophomore
and therefore has to be excused for
the few faux-pas he made during
the season. When he was cooled
down and in top physical condition,
he couldn't be beaten. He has the
fastest ball in the league, a swell
drop, and an improving curve ball.

Lazzarone, the smallest regular
hurler in the conference, has the
experience and calmness that goes
to make a big league pitcher. His
minute stature is unusual in a first
rate moundsman, however, Lazz's
earned run average is precariously
close to the top of the league, if not
the best. Whether there were 16
errors or none, he seemed content
not to worry too much about the
situation.
Merrill, Stanford's prize jinx,
and Brewer were pitching for cham
pionship teams and had two excep
tionally good infields behind them.
Stanford's infield often smelled to
high heaven, sometimes played er
rorless ball. Had they played tight
ball all season, no one would have
questioned our nominating both
Thompson and Lazzarone for all
star posts.

Well, this picking the stars is so
much fun we might just as well go
further and award more precious
plaudits. Would anyone question us
in the following selections, most of
whom are purely team honors and
non-inclusive of the rest of the
league?
Best infield—St. Mary's
Best team leader—Hooks Devauers.
