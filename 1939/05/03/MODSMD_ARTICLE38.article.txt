# Water Poloists Seek Forward Replacements
## Five Veterans Return To Bolster squad 
### 
Ciird water poloists got under way
with their annual spring practice
immediately after the end of the
â–  spring swimming season with sev
; eral returning veterans and up-and
j coming members of last year's frosh
; and junior varsity teams, according
to Coach Nort Thornton, yesterday.
This year's squad will miss two of
i its prominent 1938 members, Johnny
J Lamb, former captain, and Jack
| Loupe, both forwards. Though this

loss will hit the team sorely, there
will still be returning veterans Bob
Plate, captain-elect and sprint; Ted
Moreno and Dick Hoover, two of
the best guards in the conference;
Harvey Rothschild, center-back; and
Roy Vitousek, goal guard.
Coach Thornton is trying all ap
plicants for the two forward posi
tions to be filled. Among last year's
varsity second-stringers who are
trying for the spots are Dave Not
tage, Bob Jamieson, Bill Weeden,
Bob Allen, and Bruce Jessup. Frosh
applicants are Hadley Bacon, Fred
Manwaring, Scott Dudley, and Dun
can Patty.
An old automobile invented and
built in 1903 by G. S. Waters of
New Bern, N.C., is still running.

Varsity water poloists will put
on an exhibition match at the
Junior Water Carnival Friday af
ternoon against a team composed
of seniors and alumni.
