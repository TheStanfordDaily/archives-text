# Standlee, Fay, Albert Impress

Norm Standlee carried his 2301
pounds all over the varsity practice i
field yesterday and managed to bow
every line combination Coach Tiny j
Thornhill could gather together.
Thornhill went deep into the ranks !
to give third and fourth string men
a chance to show their stufT in yes- i
terday's spring football scrimmage, l
but habitual headliners ocntinued to
lead the field by a comfortable'
margin.
Pete Fay continued to cut, dodge,
and change pace as he barged his
way through various secondary de
fenses. Sprinting down the flanks |
during last rugby season, Fay had
built his legs for even greater speed 1
and endurance than he had shown in
former grid seasons.
Frankie Albert made skeptics eat

their words as he plowed his dimin
utive carcass through heavy lines.
His passes, some with both feet tin
the ground, continued to hit their
marks as in the last freshman sea
son.
