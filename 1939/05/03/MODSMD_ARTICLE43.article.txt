# Midweek Meal
## 
### 
TODAY we labor—tonight we eat.
In substance, that's a description of today's
program for the Convalescent Home Drive.
Of all the things that line up each year during
the week of the Drive, Labor Day always is the
most successful—this year, it will be no dif
ferent.
For today, students, and as many professors
as can muster up the courage to mingle with
them, will actually go out to the Home and put
in tangible work for the Drive.
And whether that work takes the form of
one weed pulled or a wheelbarrow full makes
little difference. One weed each for 4,000 per
sons is a sizeable amount. There may be some
who will pull two weeds. And there'll be a hoe
to fit the palms of every two hands that show
up.
However many weeds are pulled or trees
chopped by each individual, it will be Stanford
at work—and loving it.
The whole story of the Drive has been told—
publicity chairmen and copy-writers and sales
men have pulled some of their best tricks out
of the bag already and have succeeded in mak
ing a success out of the Drive so far. Today,
they pull out another trick. Stanford is not only
going to love Labor Day but it's going to have
fun pulling those weeds.
It's going to be another chance to have the
kind of fun that Stanford had on Boathouse Day
and on Student-Faculty Day.
Plus that, it's for the Convalescent Home —
for Johnny and Dorothy and all the rest of the
kids that are there now and will be there in the
future.
What more perfect set-up? How better spend
this afternoon?
Besides which, this is the one thing of the
Drive that won't cost a cent. Only sweat. Food's
on the house.
