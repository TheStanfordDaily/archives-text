# Before Too Late
## 
### 
NIGHT after night, week after week, they
rehearsed for the Gaieties. Stanford song
writers had turned out numbers worthy of pro
fessionals, and talented vocalists were to put
them over with their best microphone tech
nigue. Then came Big Game Eve, the curtain
rose, and the mike went dead.
The audience groaned, writhed a little in its
red plush seats, but was not surprised. This
had happened before; the sound eguipment
had petered out at the 1937 Gaieties and the
Spring Show the year before.
When technical accidents marred productions
in the old Assembly Hall, people credited them
to the bats that lived in the attic and found no
cause for complaint. But when Stanford dra
matics moved into its new quarters in Memorial
Hall, best equipped college theater in the West,
there were murmurs of discontent. The huge
bill for the public address system merited some
thing better than a dead mike.
This month Ram's Head will produce an
other Spring Show. Undoubtedly song-writers
have poured all their genius into words and
music. Already the vocalists are spending long
hours in rehearsal.
Technicians for "Wake Up and Leave" would
do well to make sure that their sound equip
ment will not fail on the opening night. In case
of eventuality an assistant should be posted in
the auditorium to signal the cast to desert their
dead microphones, step to the footlights, and
shout their lyrics at the audience.
When the lovely heroine tenderly grasps the
mike and parts her rosebud lips, this time, let
there be song. And there will be dancing in the
streets.â€”L. L.
