PUBLISHED in the Campus Opinion column
today is a criticism of The Daily on grounds
that it has not given sufficient publicity to the
Stanford Political Union.
For the benefit of those who haven't heard,
it should be explained that the S.P.U. is a sort
of student parliament, at which are discussed
present-day national and international prob

lems. Alignment is through three parties -
Conservative, Liberal, and Labor.
Meetings are held about every three weeks
in one of the big rooms on the Quad, with 30
to 40 persons in attendance at each.
Having "missed the boat" according to Read
er Wyman, The Daily makes the following
answer:
Examples of activities The Daily has promoted
recently are the Convalescent Home Drive and
the Junior Prom. Practically the whole student
body takes part in the Home Drive—at least
to the extent of eating beans one noon or buying
a little red and white tag. And, with almost 500
bids sold to the Junior Prom, 20 to 25 per cent
of the student body must have been there.
Comparing these figures with the meager
(though no doubt interested) turn-out at Political
Union meetings, it is evident that the S.P.U. is
a minor activity.
This judgment, made on the basis of number
of students participating, is no reflection on the
worth of the institution. The point is that an
activity that interests less than one per cent of
a newspaper's readers does not often provide
the "top copy" that Reader Wyman mentions.
When the union makes news of feature sig
nificance despite its minority standing, it can
then expect to move on to page one, column
one.—R. D.
