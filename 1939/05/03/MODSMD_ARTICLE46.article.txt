### JOHN COBBS 
STEEPLE-CIIASE
I MAGINATION has been getting a lot of exercise at
Stanford ever since the University announced that
a 210-i'oot tower would be constructed to house the
Hoover War Library. The idea strained our powers
of speculation, even though they were in first-rate
condition after years of wrestling with hazy exam
questions. And now just when we have adjusted our
selves to 210 feet of steeple, a rumor arises that the
tower will be topped with a 40-foot cupola.
As I understand it, the cupola is still only a sug
gestion; it has not been incorporated into the plans.
But there is a good deal of agitation for it; and the
betting seems about even.
I want to make clear at this point that I have no
quarrel with the new library building, either with or
without cupola. I admit that I can't get my imagination
around that much concrete, but if the architects say
it is what we need, I am willing to go along with
them.
It distresses me, though, ot see the tower-building
fever breaking out on the Stanford campus. And it
frightens me to think where it may drive us. There
is a fascination about towers that even the? strongest
wills cannot resist, and if we start in to capture the
Campanile trade there is no telling what sort of
steeple we may pile up.

r T , HE first case of tower-building on record is still
the classic example of what can happen when the
designers get a hitch-your-wagon-to-a-star complex.
The Bible reports it as follows:
"And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and
a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let
us make us a name ..."

The Bible goes on to point out how the Lord was
annoyed by the idea and confounded the language of
the builders so that they finally quit in disgust. At
this point the analogy breaks down, because as far as
I can see the trustees, the alumni, and the students
already speak different languages, and if we are to
be punished some new penalty will have to be devised.
But the first part of the story illustrates the way the
tower complex works. We set out to build a city, and
we wind up building a tower that will reach unto
heaven, so that we can make a name for ourselves.
Whether we need and can afford a new building
is another question. As long as the proposed tower fits
in with the architecture, it is justified on aesthetic
grounds. But I am frightened. Already Stanford's
imagination has soared beyond a 210-foot altitude.
We don't want to put up some illegitimate brand of
mooring mast, just to attract attention at a distance.
