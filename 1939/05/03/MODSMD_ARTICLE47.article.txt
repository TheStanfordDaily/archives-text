Has anyone seen a girl in a brown suit?
Tuesday night I got a call from a girl who said that
she was the one driving the car that the six Farm boys
followed Friday night.
She was the one. all right, because she tuld a part
of the story I hadn't printed, and she had it straight.
I am saving that little bit for identification purposes.
Isul to get on. Talking to her, I found out these
tilings:
1. There were three blondes, not just one.
2. Ty Cobb's daughter was the one who left
the ear at Athcrton, but she was not the blonde the
guys were so interested in. How the girls knew
which blonde was being most ogled, I do not
know.
This is till very well. But the girl who called was
very secretive and coy. She would not. tell me who
she was or who the blonde was.
I asked her to the Union for a coke. Whether it
was for the column or because it was spring quarter
that I asked her. I'll leave it to you. But I asked her.
All right, she said. I'll meet you in the back room.
It looks bad, I said to myself. I won't pick her up:
she'll meet me.
How will I know you, I asked.
I'll wear a brown suit, she said.
Has anyone seen a girl in a brown suit?
I asked five girls who obviously were not wear
ing brown suits if that was a brown suit they had
on. In varying degrees of luifliness they told me
that they were not wearing brown suits.
I got a brown hamburger, a brown coke, a
brown look from a girl in a blue dress, and I
woke up the next morning with a dark brown
taste in my mouth; but no girl in a brown suit.
lias anyone seen a girl in a brown suit?
And will everyone please, for God's sake, stop
being so mysterious about all this?
