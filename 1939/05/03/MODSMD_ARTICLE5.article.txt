# Farm Leads in Research

"Dr Jordan always said he brought
the best half!"
His eyes snapping and his hands
moving slightly as if to drive each
point home, Dr. George Sprague
Myers was speaking. Curator of
j zoological collections on the Farm,
, and professor of biology, he was
away on his favorite subject—fish
and fish research.
i "Yes," he continued, "David Starr
Jordan started Stanford's collection
of fish. He brought half of In
j diana's collection with him when he
came to the Farm and since the
start he gave us we've gone a long
way."
i RATES FIRST
How far "we've gone" he at first
would not disclose. But finally he
admitted that Stanford's Museum of
Natural History ranks first in
America in the field of fish research,
and bows to few institutions of its
kind in ihe world.
Housed first in Jordan Hall, the
collection of Dr. Jordan's, plus sub-
I sequent additions, was moved to the

museum 15 years ago. Now placed
in immense stacks that zoological
students humorously term the "ref
erence libe," the collection is one
of the largest in the world.
Though Dr. Jordon bought the
original material, subsequent addi
tions have been procured mainly by
expeditions throughout all parts of
the globe.
Students and professors have vis
ited China, the Philippines. East In
dies, Brazil, Siberia, everywhere, in
search of more material. Dr. Jordan
himself headed several of these, the
last to Japan in 1922.
DR. TIERRE PROMINENT
Dr. A. W. Herre was another
prominent leader in the search for
material. His expeditions to Asia
resulted in valuable gains for the
museum. Last year Dr. Myers led
two such expeditions, one to the
Galapogos Islands with the Captain
Allan Hancock Expedition, the other
along the California coast.
Not only did Dr. Jordan furnish
the backbone of the present day
collection itself. Today his ichthy
ology library forms the major part
of the research library available to
Stanford workers.
In line with this research, the
Farm group has recently put out
the first few issues of the "Stanford
Ichthyology Bulletin," an expert
journal on fish research on the Stan
ford campus. Sent to similar insti
tutions throughout the world, ex
change publications are received
which furnish valuable material, add
much to the significance of the
library.
Dr. Jordan's name is necessarily
prominent in any account of the
Stanford Museum of Natural Ilis-
History. But today Dr. Myers and a
small staff of graduate exports are
carrying on.
They too are "bringing Stanford
the best half."

Dr. Jordan's name is necessarily
prominent in any account of the
Stanford Museum of Natural Ilis-
History. But today Dr. Myers and a
small staff of graduate exports are
carrying on.
They too are "bringing Stanford
the best half."
"Dr Jordan always said he brought
the best half!"
His eyes snapping and his hands
moving slightly as if to drive each
point home, Dr. George Sprague
Myers was speaking. Curator of
j zoological collections on the Farm,
, and professor of biology, he was
away on his favorite subject—fish
and fish research.
i "Yes," he continued, "David Starr
Jordan started Stanford's collection
of fish. He brought half of In
j diana's collection with him when he
came to the Farm and since the
start he gave us we've gone a long
way."
i RATES FIRST
How far "we've gone" he at first
would not disclose. But finally he
admitted that Stanford's Museum of
Natural History ranks first in
America in the field of fish research,
and bows to few institutions of its
kind in ihe world.
Housed first in Jordan Hall, the
collection of Dr. Jordan's, plus sub-
I sequent additions, was moved to the

museum 15 years ago. Now placed
in immense stacks that zoological
students humorously term the "ref
erence libe," the collection is one
of the largest in the world.
Though Dr. Jordon bought the
original material, subsequent addi
tions have been procured mainly by
expeditions throughout all parts of
the globe.
Students and professors have vis
ited China, the Philippines. East In
dies, Brazil, Siberia, everywhere, in
search of more material. Dr. Jordan
himself headed several of these, the
last to Japan in 1922.
DR. TIERRE PROMINENT
Dr. A. W. Herre was another
prominent leader in the search for
material. His expeditions to Asia
resulted in valuable gains for the
museum. Last year Dr. Myers led
two such expeditions, one to the
Galapogos Islands with the Captain
Allan Hancock Expedition, the other
along the California coast.
Not only did Dr. Jordan furnish
the backbone of the present day
collection itself. Today his ichthy
ology library forms the major part
of the research library available to
Stanford workers.
In line with this research, the
Farm group has recently put out
the first few issues of the "Stanford
Ichthyology Bulletin," an expert
journal on fish research on the Stan
ford campus. Sent to similar insti
tutions throughout the world, ex
