# Health in the Sun
## 
### 
Mrs. Ruth Atwood, superintendent of the Stan
ford Convalescent Home, looks over but a few of
her 70 patients, who daily play and learn in the
sunshine, take the long, slow road to health.
The Home was founded in 1917, largely through
the efforts of D. Charles Gardner, then chaplain
of the University, who interested all of Stanford
in "Giving a Day of Sunshine."
Best illustration of why that interest, is the fol
lowing story taken from the Home's case histories:
Little Dorothy Gilbert, two-thirds of the skin on
her frail body burned off, came to the Home to
die. She knew it and waited patiently, for special
ists had sent her to die in the sunshine where she
could at least be happy.
But 10 months later, completely healed, Dorothy
went home â€”went home happy and well.
It is with this in mind that Stanford each year
makes elaborate plans, eats beans and strawber
ries, makes checks payable at $2.56, dons overalls
and jeans to clean up the Convalescent Home
grounds.
Already Stanford is half-way through the week
it annually devotes to its pet charity and this year,
as never before, the Home needs Stanford's help.
