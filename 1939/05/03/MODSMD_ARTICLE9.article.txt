# Foundation Survey Opens Work on New Hoover Libe
## 
### 
Engineers, conducting Icugthy foundation and soil condition tests, today
took first steps toward actual construction of the Hoover Library on War,
Revolution and Peace which, when completed, will overlook the campus
from a site opposite Memorial Hall.
Expert investigation and pressure tests of the type of ground mate
rial which will underly the library's massive 210-foot tower arc at present

being carried on by Captain R. V.<
Laßarre, Los Angeles civil engineer
employed by Architect Arthur
Brown Jr., of San Francisco.
Captain Laßarre is the originator
of a unique apparatus which,
through the use of compressed nitro
gen, is able to apply pressures up to
120 tons in determining the settling
characteristics of building founda
tion beds.
On Captain Laßarre's instructions,
workmen have excavated three
shafts to a depth of 11 feet, on the
site of the proposed library. Bot
tom pit earth samples have exposed
a subsurface gravel cemented with
sandy clay, upon which these test
pressures are being exerted.
Final results of the tests are to be
used in checking proposed founda
tion plans with a view to making
the library building and its adjoin
ing tower earthquake-resistant. Pro
