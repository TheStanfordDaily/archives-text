### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
JT'S accomplished neatly and con
veniently in Soviet Russia. When
a government official falls out. of step
with Josef Stalin, he resigns his post
and disappears. Sometimes the news
of his speedy trial and execution
leaks outside of the Kremlin walls,
sometimes there are rumblings of a |
purge, but more often there is si- !
lence.
Yesterday Maxim Litvinov, the
Russian best known to the western
world, quit his office and was re
placed by a notorious yes-man of
the Communist party. As Foreign
Commissar since 1929, he has eased
his government into its present
front rank standing in international
affairs. He was responsible for the
United States' recognition of the
Soviet Union, for the attacks on
Italy's conquest of Ethiopia in the
League of Nations, for protests
against German and Italian inter
vention in the Spanish Civil War.
On Monday Litvinov was Eu
rope's master diplomat, standing
with Stalin atop the tomb of Nico
lai Lenin, reviewing the troops of
the U.S.S.R. Today his where
about is inconsequential and un
known.
* * *
r | A JIE new head of foreign affairs
is Viacheslav Molotov, who
continues to hold his position as
chairman of the Council of People's
Commissars (equivalent to Premier).
He has a firmly established reputa
tion for having achieved success by
stooging to Stalin. And it is a cer
tainty that from now on his deci
sions will be pre-fabricated by the
chief of the Communist state.
It is not difficult, to see through
the displacement of Litvinov. His
negotiations for an alliance with
capitalist-controlled England were
unpopular with the Russian govern
ment from the start. With Mr.
Chamberlain vacillating back and
forth from appeasement to the anti
llitler bloc, Stalin became inci'eas
ingly distrustful. When Britain re
fused to enter an out-and-out alli
ance with France and the Soviet, he
decided that it was time to take over
the foreign departments himself.
# i|t
Russia has little or nothing to
gain from interference in a west
ern European war. From the point
*>f view of the Communist chief,
her wisest policy is one of isola
tion. But Litvinov fell, like Presi
dent Roosevelt, that if his nation
interfered it could prevent war
and halt the aggressions of the
dictatorships.
With Molotov as an isolationist
Foreign Commissar, the U.S.S.R.
probably will break off negotiations
with London, and leave the demo
cratic bloc to solve its own prob
lems. The British guarantees to
Poland and Rumania have stood in
the way of an Anglo-Russian mili
tary alliance since the forging of
the chain around the Reich began.
»|t >;t
r Mr. Chamberlain's proj
ect is a failure. With the Soviet
out. of the deal, it. will be impossible
for England to prevent German,
Italian, and Hungarian troops from
occupying Polish and Rumanian
soil. If the dictators decided to
move in tomorrow, Warsaw and Bu
charest would remind Britain of
her promises, and in all probability
the Prime Minister would shrug his
shoulders and say he was sorry.
Further proof of the breakdown
of the stop-llitlcr front was the
announcement in the House of
Commons yesterday that the
Chamberlain government once
again may attempt rapprochement
with the Reich. England may sur
prise the Fuehrer by snapping up
his offer to enter into non-aggres
sion pacts with all the nations
listed by President Roosevelt in
his peace proposal.
When Josef Stalin, the world's
number one Communist, pledges his
resources to Neville Chamberlain,
manufacturing capitalist of Birm
ingham, come around and tell me
about it. .

It is not difficult, to see through
the displacement of Litvinov. His
negotiations for an alliance with
capitalist-controlled England were
unpopular with the Russian govern
ment from the start. With Mr.
Chamberlain vacillating back and
forth from appeasement to the anti
llitler bloc, Stalin became inci'eas
ingly distrustful. When Britain re
fused to enter an out-and-out alli
ance with France and the Soviet, he
decided that it was time to take over

Russia has little or nothing to

interfered it could prevent war
and halt the aggressions of the
dictatorships.

move in tomorrow, Warsaw and Bu
