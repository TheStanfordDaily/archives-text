# Labor Day Thrills Convalescent Tots
## 
### 
Eighty wide-eyed little convales
j cents stared down from their regi
mented cast-iron beds at yesterday's
I annual Labor Day dust-fest, smiled
j over perspiring, straining shoulders,
I waved wildly in time with the red
j coated, red-faced band, then squat
led back on their haunches echoing
| from bed to bed Iheir childish ap
j preciations and frequent sage re
i marks.
"My name is Vincent, and I'm
i seven years old," boasted a little
j fellow who was sitting on a bench
| facing the blaring band. "There
sure are some swell looking girls
out here this afternoon, aren't there?
Yes, I like the band, too."
"Yeah, not. bad girls," chimed Vin
cent's seven- and eight-year-old
, cohorts.
"I'm David," a dark-skinned,
j black-haired lisped over the edge of
j his bed. "One of those boys down
I there said I'm noisier than the band.
I Sure, I like the band because it's

real noisy, and I like all the people.
Everybody looks happy."
"I'd like to go to the barbecue," an
11-year-old bespectacled convales
cent confessed from the next bed.
"More people have taken pictures of
us kids today. But I wish those fel
lows in the band would slop flirting
with the nurses." He turned away
and began pointing out winking ex
amples from among the laboring
band members below.
Six beds over, a patient from San
Rafael, talking and looking like one
of the Dead End kids, ogled the
band, the workers, the passing
trucks, then chirped, "Gee, ain't
â™¦ his the class. Boy, some class."
"Yeah," chorused 20 voices. "Some
class!"
