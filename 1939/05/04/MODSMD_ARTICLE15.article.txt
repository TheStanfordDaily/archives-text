As the total amount in the drive j
treasury increases daily, Stanford J
prepares to relax at the Masque Ball j
tomorrow night after a week of good
work.
Traditional wind-up event of the
Convalescent Home Drive, the ball
has, in past years, been the most
colorful, most informal of the year's
big dances.
This year's "Arabian Nights"
theme is wide open as far as cos
tume is concerned. Reports yester
day indicated that the Farm is go
ing to the dance as everything from
roughs in dirty cords to hill-billies,
bathing beauties to harem girls.
MASKS REQUIRED
Encouraging the growing diversity
in costume, Rovena Conn, co-chair
man, announced that any sort of
costume was permissible. Only re
quirement, she said, was a mask,
which will be given with each bid.
"Anything can happen in a mask,"
Dick Lyon, co-chairman, added.
Resembling more than anything
else the "arts balls" which annually
splurge in most of the big cities,
this year's ball will be held in a huge
Arabian tent, erected in the Wom
en's Gym. Dancing will also be ar
ranged in the patio outside.
Carvel Craig and his orchestra,
introducers of "Please Be Kind"
i and "So Help Me," will play for the
dance from 9 to 1 o'clock.
MUSIC VELVETY'
Described by Variety as "vel
vety," Craig's band features a Du
chin-like arrangement,, accenting
smooth brass work with piano
phrasings. •
Two fortune tellers will be on duly
in booths throughout, the evening.
Soothsayers Phoebe Buroody and
Gayle Buchanan, using an original
"Turkish coffee" method of necro
mancy, will predict the future for
anyone who wants to know.
