# 'Use Serum Cautiously,' Says Schultz
## Chemical May Cause Permanent Loss Of Sense of Smell 
### 
Warning that the use of zinc sul
fate in man as an infantile paralysis
prophylactic may cause a perma
nent loss of the sense of smell, Dr.
Edwin Schultz, Stanford bacteriol
ogist, yesterday warned medical
men to proceed cautiously in the use
of ibis chemical on children and
adults.
Dr. Schultz' experimental tests
with zinc sulfate solution have led
to hopes of finding an effective safe
guard against infantile paralysis in
fection. His disclosure of the hazard
involved in the treatment was made
yesterday before the California Med
ical Association in convention at
Del Monte.
A one per cent solution of zinc
sulfate introduced into the nasal
passages of experimental monkeys,
Dr. Schultz said, renders "all or
nearly all animals'' highly resistant
to infantile paralysis infection for
one or two months or more.
However, he added, the use of zinc
sulfate as a promising prophylactic
in man Is attended with the hazard
that it may cause a permanent loss
of Lhe sense of smell.
"We already know that a one per
cent solution of zinc sulfate may in
duce a permanent anosmia (loss of
the sense of smell) in some persons,"
Dr. Schultz told medical delegates,
"and especially adults are more
prone to such a complication, prob
ably for local anatomic reasons.
"At the same time I am sure
that this risk can be reduced con
siderably by a somewhat more cau
tious procedure in applying the
solution."
Stanford medical school research
ers a year ago devised a method for
introducing the preventative chem
ical into the nasal passages, per
mitting the solution to flood the ol
factory nerve ends. Through Ihe.se
free nerve-ends, researchers believe,
the infantile paralysis virus enters
♦the nervous system.
Action of the zinc sulfate is be
lieved to make the olfactory nerve
ends impermeable to the virus for
a period of one or two months—the
duration of the ordinary infantile
paralysis epidemic.
When the olfactory nerve-ends
have been closed by zinc sulfate,
the virus apparently cannot enter
the nervous system; but this condi
tion brings about a temporary loss
I of the sense of smell.
Thus the problem of physicians is
to make sure that patients being in
oculated against infantile paralysis
lose their smell sense temporarily
but not permanently. Further, Dr.
Schultz said the return of the sense
of smell probably means that sus
ceptibility to infection also has re
t urncd.
