# Marks Poor, Spirit High In Final Twilight Meet Before Trojan Encounter
## 
### 
On any other track team in the
country last evening's strenuous
workout in the weekly twilight meet
would be the last real work until the
starting time on Saturday of the
encounter with the mighty Trojan.
But not for the Cards, for under
Coach Dink Templeton's "never get
stale" theories, they can well expect
plenty of running and jumping at
today's practice.
If last night's performances were
any indication of the way in which
the Indian cindermen plan to act
against U.S.C., those 55 points that
they are planning to score against
the greatest track team in the
country look pretty far away. Still,
though the times and distances were
very, very mediocre in most cases,
the spirit was there. And a track
team such as Templeton's which is
relaxed and has everything to gain
and nothing to lose, can be mighty
dangerous.

Clyde Jeffrey broke lethargically
from his holes in last evening's cen
tury dash and was onl> able to nose
out Ray Dean by two inches with a
terrific gather in the final 20 yards in
time which is below par for Jeffrey—
9.8. However, "Jeff" came back to
run a fine furlong in 21.3.
One of the better Cardinal events
last night was some further proof
of Craig Williamson's finally hitting
his stride. Craig was bothered ear
lier in the season with a cold and a
weak arch support, but he impressed
fans mighty favorably last Saturday
by beating out Bill McCurdy, for
mer Stanford track captain, for sec
ond place in a fast quarter-mile

i behind Cal's Don Watts. In yester
day's twilight 440-yard dash he led
the field almost the entire way to
finish in 48.9.
The distances were very poor,
Barney Ferguson and P;iul Moore
being beaten in a 1:58 half-mile by
1 Johnson of San Jose Slate, Moore
touring the mile course in 4:29, and
"Mushy" Cirard, Johnny Emman
uel, and A1 Soldate finishing close
together in that order in a 9:41 two
j mile.

Sid Hayes was on the sidelines of
' last night's hurdle races and the
! results were plainly evident. Big
! Bill Hawkins took the highs from
Dick Simpson by two yards in a
I slow 15 flat. Captain Stan Hiser
j man took a holiday from the low
barriers and it was up to "Hawk" to
| beat Simpson again and little Paul
Huston: the time was 24.3.
The bright light of the track events
was Templeton's relay team of Dick
Carew, "Rocky" Rockwell, William
| son, and Jeffrey which packed the
i mail through the four laps in 3:17.8
—time which will make the Trojan
j quartet really step.
Things on the field were not much
I brighter. However, "Da Pete" Zagar
caught hold of a mighty toss in the
discus which measured 168 ft. 8 in.
and Hamp Pool broke 150 feet for
j the first time in his life, going 4
inches over this goal he has been
i shooting at for so long. Bill Wohle
; and Stan Andersen continued mo

the shot, Wohle hitting 51 ft. 6 in.
and Andersen 50 ft. 4 in. Bill Bra

On any other track team in the
country last evening's strenuous
workout in the weekly twilight meet
would be the last real work until the
starting time on Saturday of the
encounter with the mighty Trojan.
But not for the Cards, for under
Coach Dink Templeton's "never get
stale" theories, they can well expect
plenty of running and jumping at
today's practice.
If last night's performances were
any indication of the way in which
the Indian cindermen plan to act
against U.S.C., those 55 points that
they are planning to score against
the greatest track team in the
country look pretty far away. Still,
though the times and distances were
very, very mediocre in most cases,
the spirit was there. And a track
team such as Templeton's which is
relaxed and has everything to gain
and nothing to lose, can be mighty
dangerous.

Clyde Jeffrey broke lethargically
from his holes in last evening's cen
tury dash and was onl> able to nose
out Ray Dean by two inches with a
terrific gather in the final 20 yards in
time which is below par for Jeffrey—
9.8. However, "Jeff" came back to
run a fine furlong in 21.3.
One of the better Cardinal events
last night was some further proof
of Craig Williamson's finally hitting
his stride. Craig was bothered ear
lier in the season with a cold and a
weak arch support, but he impressed
fans mighty favorably last Saturday
by beating out Bill McCurdy, for
mer Stanford track captain, for sec
ond place in a fast quarter-mile

i behind Cal's Don Watts. In yester
day's twilight 440-yard dash he led
the field almost the entire way to
finish in 48.9.
The distances were very poor,
Barney Ferguson and P;iul Moore
being beaten in a 1:58 half-mile by
1 Johnson of San Jose Slate, Moore
touring the mile course in 4:29, and
"Mushy" Cirard, Johnny Emman
uel, and A1 Soldate finishing close
together in that order in a 9:41 two
