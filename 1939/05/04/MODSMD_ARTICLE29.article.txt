WHILE WE sit around wondering
how clo.se we can come to (iO points
in our track meet Saturday with
U.S.C., we are missing some of the
choicest bits of news ever to come
out of the Northwest, where men I
are men and everybody else wants j
to split the Pacific Coast Confer
ence into two small leagues.
Every fall, the northerners get ,
pretty riled about the whole situa- i
lion because, as a rule, their football |
squad are definitely not on a par j
with those of the California schools. I
The sentiment dies down every I
time Washington State or Washing- j
ton or one of the Oregon institu- 1
tions comes through with an upset i
win over a usually favored Califor- !
niu outfit. In football and in bas- !
ketball. however, weather conditions |
offer no hazard to the northern |
members, except in cases like the
one here last fall when Washington ■
State, pitifully undermanned and in- 1
jury-ridden, fell prey to a tropical
heat wave. It was so hot that day j
that some of the boys in the press
box, high up on a windswept plateau, j
actually perspired as they worked.
With the coming of the track sea- |
son, the howl has gone up again. I
And by gosh, the northerners have 1
a few points which cannot be de- ,
nied. Up there where it snows and 1
blows clear into the middle of April, i
all workouts have to be taken in in
door arenas. But track muscles need j
sunshine and warmth, not the kind [
of stuffy heat that steams out of |
radiators.
WE HAVE to admit that their |
point about the inequality of train- I
ing conditions is absolutely true, bul j
that's a minor example of their real 1
gripe.
The northerners (hereafter to be
known as damyankees) are burned
up and fighting mad over a junior
college situation with which they !
cannot cope. Every time a Stanford
or S.C. trackman, hailing from Si- 1
wash J.C., breaks another record or !
just noses out the yankee ace who J
wasn't supposed to be beaten by i
anybody, the cry ruses, "Inequality," I
or "Down with the junior college." j
We look upon junior colleges as a |
normal step in higher education, i
The leaders of the protest move- |
ment see them only as a training'
ground for champion athletes. Both
of us are right to a certain degree, I
though the principle of education j
is still holding its head above |
water.

BUT A SPLIT in one of the
strongest conferences in the union
hardly seems like the correct so
lution for what Ls undoubtedly a bad
situation. The northerners have
better opportunities to lure pros
pective athletes because they have
fewer big universities in the prose
lyting field. Their coaches are as
good, or should be, if a comparison
of salaries between the north and
south means anything. It all nar
rows down to differences in training
conditions and the junior college ad
vantage.
You can realize right now how
riled we get every time we think
of the colossal material in all sports
which heads for U.S.C. There's noth
ing unlawful or particularly bad in
the system except that we are
peeved for not getting the prize
physical specimens first.
Now imagine how the largest
northwestern school is going to feel
when it suffers two 100-30 track de
feats in a row from the second and
third best California squads. You'd
be mad, too. Yes, and you'd do your
best to find a remedy that would
put you back in the athletic run
ning. If you split the conference,
you split gate receipts and interest.
It's going to be hard to change the
weather. So the only situation is to
try to change the jaysee system.
Maybe all transfers should lose a
year of eligibility regardless of the
kind of school from which they
came. That would force the high
school athletes either to register as
freshmen in the conference school or
lose one full season of action.
But a large number of men,
through scholastic deficiencies, fin
ancial problems, and the like, can't
start in at a school like California
or Stanford. Those who couldn't get
in the high standard schools would
stop at the second-year jaysee or go
where they could get in and make
the financial and scholastic grade.
And you know where that would
leave Stanford and California? Yep,
behind the eight-ball is right.

the financial and scholastic grade.
And you know where that would
leave Stanford and California? Yep,
behind the eight-ball is right.
WHILE WE sit around wondering
how clo.se we can come to (iO points
in our track meet Saturday with
U.S.C., we are missing some of the
choicest bits of news ever to come
out of the Northwest, where men I
are men and everybody else wants j
to split the Pacific Coast Confer
ence into two small leagues.
Every fall, the northerners get ,
pretty riled about the whole situa- i
lion because, as a rule, their football |
squad are definitely not on a par j
with those of the California schools. I
The sentiment dies down every I
time Washington State or Washing- j
ton or one of the Oregon institu- 1
tions comes through with an upset i
win over a usually favored Califor- !
niu outfit. In football and in bas- !
ketball. however, weather conditions |
offer no hazard to the northern |
members, except in cases like the
one here last fall when Washington ■
State, pitifully undermanned and in- 1
jury-ridden, fell prey to a tropical
heat wave. It was so hot that day j
that some of the boys in the press
box, high up on a windswept plateau, j
actually perspired as they worked.
With the coming of the track sea- |
son, the howl has gone up again. I
And by gosh, the northerners have 1
a few points which cannot be de- ,
nied. Up there where it snows and 1
blows clear into the middle of April, i
all workouts have to be taken in in
door arenas. But track muscles need j
sunshine and warmth, not the kind [
of stuffy heat that steams out of |
radiators.
WE HAVE to admit that their |
point about the inequality of train- I
ing conditions is absolutely true, bul j
that's a minor example of their real 1
gripe.
The northerners (hereafter to be
known as damyankees) are burned
up and fighting mad over a junior
college situation with which they !
cannot cope. Every time a Stanford
or S.C. trackman, hailing from Si- 1
wash J.C., breaks another record or !
just noses out the yankee ace who J
wasn't supposed to be beaten by i
anybody, the cry ruses, "Inequality," I
or "Down with the junior college." j
We look upon junior colleges as a |
normal step in higher education, i
The leaders of the protest move- |
ment see them only as a training'
ground for champion athletes. Both
of us are right to a certain degree, I
though the principle of education j
is still holding its head above |
water.

BUT A SPLIT in one of the
strongest conferences in the union
hardly seems like the correct so
lution for what Ls undoubtedly a bad
situation. The northerners have
better opportunities to lure pros
pective athletes because they have
fewer big universities in the prose
lyting field. Their coaches are as
good, or should be, if a comparison
of salaries between the north and
south means anything. It all nar
rows down to differences in training
conditions and the junior college ad
vantage.
You can realize right now how
riled we get every time we think
of the colossal material in all sports
which heads for U.S.C. There's noth
ing unlawful or particularly bad in
the system except that we are
peeved for not getting the prize
physical specimens first.
Now imagine how the largest
northwestern school is going to feel
when it suffers two 100-30 track de
feats in a row from the second and
third best California squads. You'd
be mad, too. Yes, and you'd do your
best to find a remedy that would
put you back in the athletic run
ning. If you split the conference,
you split gate receipts and interest.
It's going to be hard to change the
weather. So the only situation is to
try to change the jaysee system.
Maybe all transfers should lose a
year of eligibility regardless of the
kind of school from which they
came. That would force the high
school athletes either to register as
freshmen in the conference school or
lose one full season of action.
But a large number of men,
through scholastic deficiencies, fin
ancial problems, and the like, can't
start in at a school like California
or Stanford. Those who couldn't get
in the high standard schools would
stop at the second-year jaysee or go
where they could get in and make
the financial and scholastic grade.
And you know where that would
leave Stanford and California? Yep,
behind the eight-ball is right.

or Stanford. Those who couldn't get
in the high standard schools would
stop at the second-year jaysee or go
where they could get in and make
the financial and scholastic grade.
And you know where that would
leave Stanford and California? Yep,
behind the eight-ball is right.
WHILE WE sit around wondering
how clo.se we can come to (iO points
in our track meet Saturday with
U.S.C., we are missing some of the
choicest bits of news ever to come
out of the Northwest, where men I
are men and everybody else wants j
to split the Pacific Coast Confer
ence into two small leagues.
Every fall, the northerners get ,
pretty riled about the whole situa- i
lion because, as a rule, their football |
squad are definitely not on a par j
with those of the California schools. I
The sentiment dies down every I
time Washington State or Washing- j
ton or one of the Oregon institu- 1
tions comes through with an upset i
win over a usually favored Califor- !
niu outfit. In football and in bas- !
ketball. however, weather conditions |
offer no hazard to the northern |
members, except in cases like the
one here last fall when Washington ■
State, pitifully undermanned and in- 1
jury-ridden, fell prey to a tropical
heat wave. It was so hot that day j
that some of the boys in the press
box, high up on a windswept plateau, j
actually perspired as they worked.
With the coming of the track sea- |
son, the howl has gone up again. I
And by gosh, the northerners have 1
a few points which cannot be de- ,
nied. Up there where it snows and 1
blows clear into the middle of April, i
all workouts have to be taken in in
door arenas. But track muscles need j
sunshine and warmth, not the kind [
of stuffy heat that steams out of |
radiators.
WE HAVE to admit that their |
point about the inequality of train- I
ing conditions is absolutely true, bul j
that's a minor example of their real 1
gripe.
The northerners (hereafter to be
known as damyankees) are burned
up and fighting mad over a junior
college situation with which they !
cannot cope. Every time a Stanford
or S.C. trackman, hailing from Si- 1
wash J.C., breaks another record or !
just noses out the yankee ace who J
wasn't supposed to be beaten by i
anybody, the cry ruses, "Inequality," I
or "Down with the junior college." j
We look upon junior colleges as a |
normal step in higher education, i
The leaders of the protest move- |
ment see them only as a training'
ground for champion athletes. Both
of us are right to a certain degree, I
though the principle of education j
is still holding its head above |
water.

BUT A SPLIT in one of the
strongest conferences in the union
hardly seems like the correct so
lution for what Ls undoubtedly a bad
situation. The northerners have
better opportunities to lure pros
pective athletes because they have
fewer big universities in the prose
lyting field. Their coaches are as
good, or should be, if a comparison
of salaries between the north and
south means anything. It all nar
rows down to differences in training
conditions and the junior college ad
vantage.
You can realize right now how
riled we get every time we think
of the colossal material in all sports
which heads for U.S.C. There's noth
ing unlawful or particularly bad in
the system except that we are
peeved for not getting the prize
physical specimens first.
Now imagine how the largest
northwestern school is going to feel
when it suffers two 100-30 track de
feats in a row from the second and
third best California squads. You'd
be mad, too. Yes, and you'd do your
best to find a remedy that would
put you back in the athletic run
ning. If you split the conference,
you split gate receipts and interest.
It's going to be hard to change the
weather. So the only situation is to
try to change the jaysee system.
Maybe all transfers should lose a
year of eligibility regardless of the
kind of school from which they
came. That would force the high
school athletes either to register as
freshmen in the conference school or
lose one full season of action.
But a large number of men,
through scholastic deficiencies, fin
ancial problems, and the like, can't
start in at a school like California
or Stanford. Those who couldn't get
in the high standard schools would
stop at the second-year jaysee or go
where they could get in and make
the financial and scholastic grade.
