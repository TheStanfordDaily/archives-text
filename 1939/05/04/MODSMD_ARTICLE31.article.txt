# Derby Favorite Runs Fast Trial
## El Chico, Juvenile Take Light Workouts 
### 
LOUISVILLE, Ky„ May 3 (UP).—
Johnstown worked a mile at
Churchill Downs today, and at the
finish of his run looked more than
ever like the horse to beat in the
Derby on Saturday.
With Jimmy Stout up, William
Woodward's coll came out between
the third and fourth races and
loafed i. mile in 1:38 3-5.
With scarcely one full day of
rest since being shipped from Now
York, and with Stout restraining him
most of the way, Johnstown still
covered the distance in just one
fiith of a second slower time than
Viscounty did in whipping Techni
cian in the Derby trial yesterday.
It is likely he will be the first
favorite since Agile in 1905 to go
to the post as short as 1 to 3.
Four other contenders for the mint
julep classic had workouts. El Chico,
champion juvenile of last year, and
Winter Book, favorite until Johns
town displaced him, did a mile with
his stablemate, Our Mat.
El Chico covered the distance in
the poor time of 1:44 2-5, while Our
Mat did it a second faster. The other
two workers. Heather Broom and
Challedon, were merely galloped.
