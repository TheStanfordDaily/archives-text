# Cardinals Be Damned

### 
NO one can deny that Cardinals is undemo
cratic.
Roy Thompson, president of the activity or
ganization, admitted as much to Ex Committee
Tuesday night. In fact, he said Cardinals "has
to be undemocratic in order to fulfill the duties
it is called on to fulfill."
What he referred to was Cardinals' traditional
method of selecting new members. Instead of
being elected by the student body or appointed
by Ex Committee, new members are simply
chosen by Cardinals. Ratification of these se
lections has, in the past, been a routine mat
ter, approval being taken for granted.
Self-perpetuation —that's what it is. And self
perpetuation usually means that an organiza
tion is ingrown, controlled by a small, select
clique. Plenty of persons are thinking these
days that Cardinals is no exception.
Ex Committtee took steps Tuesday night—
very short ones, to be sure, but steps, anyhow —
to restrict this self-perpetuation. It reached a
sort of gentlemen's agreement with its undemo
cratic underling, under which Cardinals is to
nominate a few more persons than necessary,
Ex Committee to make final selections from this
group.
Obviously this is no solution to the problem.
Cardinals still will control selection of its new
members almost with the effectiveness of a
fraternity.
Basically, Cardinals is nothing but a subcom
mittee of Ex Committee. It was designed to
bear the burden of planning dances and other
student activities. It is a fact, however, that
Cardinals was conspicuous in its sloppy han
dling of post-game dances last fall. A couple
were successful, but there were some terrific
flops.
Remind Cardinals of this inefficiency, ask it
to justify its existence, and it points to the Con
valescent Home Drive. "Our baby!" the activity
men cry gleefully. "Where would your Home
Drive be without us?"
The answer is that Cardinals does not run the
drive. All it does is appoint some committee
chairmen to do the managing. And no one can
say that it takes an undemocratic clique to make
committee appointments that could just as well
be handled by Ex Committee. The committee
could refer to the card files, get advice from
its new activities co-ordinator, and do just as
satisfactory a job as Cardinals.
Boathouse Day was managed smoothly and
effectively by a committee appointed by Ex
Committee. It didn't take Cardinals to make
that function a success.
Therefore, since Cardinals is undesirable, un
democratic, and unnecessary, why not abolish
it? Ex Committee doesn't need to take entire
responsibility. It can put the question up to the
student body in the coming special election.
Cardinals is self-perpetuating.
Cardinals has developed into an honor so
ciety instead of a service committee.
Cardinals has very few necessary functions.
And the functions it does perform are fre
quently mismanaged.
Therefore, the time has come to decide
whether Cardinals shall be retained or abol
ished. Ex Committee's move is to put the
question on the next ballot.—R. D.

Committee. It didn't take Cardinals to make
that function a success.
Therefore, since Cardinals is undesirable, un
democratic, and unnecessary, why not abolish
it? Ex Committee doesn't need to take entire
responsibility. It can put the question up to the
student body in the coming special election.
Cardinals is self-perpetuating.
Cardinals has developed into an honor so
ciety instead of a service committee.
Cardinals has very few necessary functions.
And the functions it does perform are fre
quently mismanaged.
Therefore, the time has come to decide
whether Cardinals shall be retained or abol
ished. Ex Committee's move is to put the
question on the next ballot.—R. D.
NO one can deny that Cardinals is undemo
cratic.
Roy Thompson, president of the activity or
ganization, admitted as much to Ex Committee
Tuesday night. In fact, he said Cardinals "has
to be undemocratic in order to fulfill the duties
it is called on to fulfill."
What he referred to was Cardinals' traditional
method of selecting new members. Instead of
being elected by the student body or appointed
by Ex Committee, new members are simply
chosen by Cardinals. Ratification of these se
lections has, in the past, been a routine mat
ter, approval being taken for granted.
Self-perpetuation —that's what it is. And self
perpetuation usually means that an organiza
tion is ingrown, controlled by a small, select
clique. Plenty of persons are thinking these
days that Cardinals is no exception.
Ex Committtee took steps Tuesday night—
very short ones, to be sure, but steps, anyhow —
to restrict this self-perpetuation. It reached a
sort of gentlemen's agreement with its undemo
cratic underling, under which Cardinals is to
nominate a few more persons than necessary,
Ex Committee to make final selections from this
group.
Obviously this is no solution to the problem.
Cardinals still will control selection of its new
members almost with the effectiveness of a
fraternity.
Basically, Cardinals is nothing but a subcom
mittee of Ex Committee. It was designed to
bear the burden of planning dances and other
student activities. It is a fact, however, that
Cardinals was conspicuous in its sloppy han
dling of post-game dances last fall. A couple
were successful, but there were some terrific
flops.
Remind Cardinals of this inefficiency, ask it
to justify its existence, and it points to the Con
valescent Home Drive. "Our baby!" the activity
men cry gleefully. "Where would your Home
Drive be without us?"
The answer is that Cardinals does not run the
drive. All it does is appoint some committee
chairmen to do the managing. And no one can
say that it takes an undemocratic clique to make
committee appointments that could just as well
be handled by Ex Committee. The committee
could refer to the card files, get advice from
its new activities co-ordinator, and do just as
satisfactory a job as Cardinals.
Boathouse Day was managed smoothly and
effectively by a committee appointed by Ex
Committee. It didn't take Cardinals to make
that function a success.
