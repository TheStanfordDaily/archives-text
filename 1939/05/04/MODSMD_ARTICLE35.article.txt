# Sentiment? — Bah!

THE day was warm, and the sweat ran down
their faces and over their bare chests. Arms
used to golf clubs and tennis rackets swung
axes and picks and scythes. There was work

to bo done at the Convalescent Home.
No one objected to the lack of forks and
napkins for the barbecue. The meat tasted bet
tor there in the dusty twiHght than it could
have at the most elaborate candle-lit table. With
riotous good humor hundreds stuffed them
selves with dinner and cheered the informal
entertainment.
It happened yesterday just as it has hap
pened every year since Stanford established its
own Labor Day. Sunshine, and work that was
fun, and food.
Hundreds of dusty, happy faces that turned
toward home at 6:30 proved that callous post
depression Stanford knows how to enjoy itself.
The Convalescent Home kids were uppermost
in the minds of few of the workers yesterday.
Only a minute percentage caught a glimpse of
the 80 young people they were sweating for.
But, whether they knew it or not, those kids
were the reason that the students had a good
time. Raking, hoeing, and weeding really are
not fun. It is the pleasure of working for a
charitable cause that makes men and women
turn out for Labor Day year after year, that
insures the Home Drive's success.
Today, back in their gabardines and their
cashmere sweaters, they v/ill pooh-pooh the
idea. They went out and worked at the Con
valescent Home because—well, because they
wanted to.—L. L.
