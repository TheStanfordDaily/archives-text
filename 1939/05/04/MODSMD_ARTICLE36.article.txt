# BULL SESSION
## LIVE-AT-HOME; LET'S SPIKE IT 
### JOHN COBBS 
I iNTIL last Tuesday evening I had never considered
Ex Committee members particularly domestic. I
knew that they were fine, conscientious young men
and women, typical bulwarks of the American home,
but I hadn't thought of them as militant crusaders for
bigger hearthstones. It surprised me considerably,
then, to hear a subcommittee bring in a report call
ing for more restrictions on off-campus dances; and
it rather took the wind out of me when the sub
committee explained plans for an l 'on-campus" week
next fall "when the boys could go back to the rough
. . . and all cars would be banned."
Even in spring quarter, when seniors are expected
to be soft yielding masses of emotion, I cannot share
the sub-committee's enthusiasm for a live-at-home
and-like-it. week. And somehow I cannot follow its
reasoning on the off-campus dance question; the argu
ment presented sounds more like a dean's form letter
than the report of a student group.

JT IS very nice, of course, to center activities on the
campus. By doing this we bring the student body
together, bind ourselves closer to dear alma mater,
and encourage the virtues of simplicity. But I have
thought always that love of home was spontaneous,
and I am suspicious of any attempt to legislate it into
us.
I don't see how we can expect the students to love
Stanford any more if we spend a week splattering
them with synthetic sentiment. And I don't see how
we are going to arouse tender emotions in the rough
by taking his car away from him, leaving him to run
for his 8 o'clocks.

Loving dear alma mater is something every man
has to do for himself. We can't spoon-feed domestic
virtue to the students. And after being quarantined on
the Farm for a week, the roughs would bolt oil the
campus as soon as the border was opened.
The off-campus dance question works under the
same principles. It would be nice if more dances were
held on the campus. But if the students want to use
a hotel, there is no reason why they shouldn't.

Presumably we arc just as moral and well-behaved
away from Stanford as we are under its sandstone
arches. If we are not, the University has enough ar
tillery in the honor code and the conduct unbecoming
clause to put down any rebellions. And so there is no
reason why we shouldn't hold our dances where we
like.
Stanford is not a convent or a reform school. The
oretically, it works on the assumption that the students
are intelligent, well-behaved adults. If so, the stu
dents have a right to go where they like; legislation
can't change their preferences. The magic formula,
"moved, seconded, carried," doesn't, apply to tastes.
