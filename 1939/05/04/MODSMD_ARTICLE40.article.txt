# LITTLE RASCALS

The Encina boys are gambling again.
They are working that old trick on each other of
telling a guy you will give him a nickel for every
dollar he can stand on end, and he stands the dollar
on end and you give him a nickel and take his dollar.
It's working, too. Those frosh could be smarter.
