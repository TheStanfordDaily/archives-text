# 'Dodge City' Rip-Roaring Good Western
## 
### 
"DODGE CITY," now playing at
the Fox-Stanford Theater.
Yippee. Errol Flynn is back and
this time astride a horse, with a six
shooter at his hip.
Riding into '"Dodfte City" with his
pals, Alan Hale and "Big Boy" Wil
liams, Flynn becomes sheriff and
cleans up the town, breaking the
hold of crook Bruce Cabot and his
band of roughnecks. Included in the
story, of course, are scores of mur
ders and Olivia De Havilland.
FLYNNS ENGLISH
The scenarist goes to great pains to
explain Flynn's use of the King's'
English in the wild and wooly West
background and they do too to the
satisfaction of all concerned And as
the tough, quick-on-the-draw sher
iff Flynn plays his part with a
swashbuckling manner destined to
keep him tops with the women of
the audience. And. though they
won't admit it, with the men movie
goers, too.
Alan Hale has one scene which
gives him a chance to flaunt his
comedy talent and he does. His meek
manner when he gets involved with
The Pure Prairie League completely
wins the approval of the audience.
The big scene of the picture is
when the Civil War is fought all
over again at the expense of the
town saloon. It beats any of the
fight scenes ever filmed.
OLIVIA LOOKS LOVELY
Olivia DeHavilland doesn't have
much to do but she does a very ex
pert job of looking lovely and occa
sionally expressing emotions at the
right time. Ann Sheridan was the
bar beauty with the proper amount
of cheapness.
If you like rip-roaring action and
good comedy then "Dodge City" is
your dish.
