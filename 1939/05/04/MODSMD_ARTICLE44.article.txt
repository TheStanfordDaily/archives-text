The Editor, Sir:
The reporter who undertakes a
drama review ceases to be a mere
journalist and assumes certain dis
tinct and severe responsibilities.
These involve analyzing and criticis
ing the play under consideration —
and the production of that play (for
the distinction is important) — as
honestly, as validly, and as com
pletely as his capabilities will per
mit. He must attempt to understand
and interpret the motives and ob
jectives of those staging and per
forming the play. In the light of
these desired effects he must eval
uate the performances and produc
tion techniques that result. And,
with all this, the reviewer must pro
duce an article that is interesting
and effective from the newspaper's
point of view.
These are tasking responsibilities,
and it is not entirely to the dis
credit of the reviewer if he fails to
satisfy them. But to make no at
tempt to do so, to ignore the dom
inant issues entirely, not only re
sults in journalistic tripe, but is very
unkind to those whose efforts are
being criticized. This unkindness
lies not only in the injustice of such
criticism; still less in the damage to
individual egos. It lies in the ma
terial harm done by such reviewing
to the chances of success a play may
have. It is futile to conjecture what
audiences might have come to the
three performances of "Shoemaker's
Holiday" that followed the Daily re

view, had that review been —not fa
vorable—but honest and valid.
The contradiction between the re
action of the Daily critics and the
general audience response was,
therefore, painful irony to those
who had spent three hard weeks in
preparing the play. However, such
discussion is fruitless now—the play
is over. Fruitless also is any resume
of the innumerable instances where
in the recent review misunderstood
and misinterpreted the play, and
wherein it grievously misjudged
specific details of performance and
production.
This is not meant as a vitupera
tive attack; there have been enough
of« those. It is simply a plea for a
little more painstaking considera

lion of the position and responsibili
ties of a campus reviewer.
