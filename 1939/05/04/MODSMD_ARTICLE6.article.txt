# Queen's Kidnapping Provided Theme for Masque Ball in '34
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
"The queen has been kidnapped, |
God Save the King."
Such might have been the an- j
nouncement Farm Masque Bailers
faced in '.">4, while the campus Paul
Revere carried the news in a jounc
ing horse-less carriage.
Queen Eleanor "Hey Hey" Harris
was the reigning female potentate
of the Masque Ball theme, "King
dom of Hell," in 1934. She was car
ried away the eve before her coro
nation, while the campus ran in
circles and the administration tore j
its hair.
A scribe's-eye view of one Masque j
Ball of years gone by. A flash-back
into Masque Ball history.
Days when being king and queen
of the ball were ne'er-to-be-forgot
ten honors. Nights when hair-pull
ing and vote-casting assumed equal
importance.
One day before the 1934 celebra
tion, queen-elect Eleanor Harris
was captured by a masquerading

"photographer," held prisoner for
13 hours in a hou.se "ten minutes off j
the campus." H.R. Majesty was re- j
leased in scant time to appear for j
her own Masque Ball coronation —
termed the escapade "merely a i
prank."
Such were the hectic—but glorious
—times when king and queen elec
tions kept the campus agog for
weeks. They ended three years ago.
The king-queen tradition lasted |
one year longer. At the 1937 ball |
the dignitaries made their last ap
pearance. This time not as elected j
campus favorites, but as possessors j
of the "lucky" ticket.
But in those days gone by, campus
voters put their favorites on the
throne themselves. Voted for names j
such as Bobby "Dog Face" Grayson,
Peg "Leg" Worderi, and George i
"Brush" Fuller, while nominees
wondered if it was worth it all.
"The Queen is kidnapped."
The King has disappeared, too." j
