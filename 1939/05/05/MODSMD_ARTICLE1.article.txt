were days early in this
quarter when pacifists and mil
itarists, newsboys and radio com
mentators were shouting loudly
about and impending war. But dur
ing the past few weeks the imme
diacy and inevitability of conflict
have been soft-pedalled, and the
crisis seems more a confusion of
diplomatic give-and-take than a
reason to put Stanford in uniform.
Beneath the surface the European
situation has remained practically
static, except for one major change.
Russia has, in effect, held out for a
guarantee of armed aid against
Japan in return for backing the stop-
Hitler alliance, and the English have
answered, "Nay."

All tlie sound and fury we have
been hearing about British con
scription, the Danzig-Corridor de
mands, and the replacement of
Maxim Litvinov can be traced to
tills simple diplomatic refusal.
The air may be thick with ideol
ogies. demands, and rapproche
ments, but it all boils down to the
failure of the Anglo-Russian al
liance to click. To begin at the
beginning:
As soon as Japan i.s able to bring
her Chinese campaign to a satisfac
lroy close, she will turn her atten
tion to a war with Russia. As far as
providing territory for the expansion
of the overcrowded island empire,
the conquest of* China has been a
blatant failure. A land so thickly
populated, so rooted in its culture
and tradition, is not an easy one to
dominate. Japan is looking for an
other Manchukuo.
*;« v #
|N Siberia, Nippon sees the object
of her search. There, in juxtapo
sition with the Manchurian puppet
state, lies an almost limitless expanse
of territory suitable for Japanese
colonization. Realizing Ihe inevita
bility of an attack in this direction,
Russia is interested in a three-day
pact with France and England that
will assure her of aid against her
Oriental enemy.
Neville Chamberlain was flirt
ing with the Soviet because he
wanted its colossal resources on
his side of the dcmocratic-totali
tarian line-up for war. When he
heard the conditions the Russians
demanded, an outright military
treaty with France included, he
skipped out of the back door, re
alizing that such an agreement
would mean armed aid in Siberia
against Japan.

Britain's stand was to be expected,
and it is backed by typical British
reasons.. First, England is allied with
Poland and Rumania, both of whom
lear the U.S.S.R. and refuse to al
low its troops to cross their fron
tiers. Second, Mr. Chamberlain
fears an Anglo-Soviet pact would
be a signal for the Japanese to con
vert the anti-Commintern agreement
into a military alliance with the dic
tatorships.
Third, the Conservative interests
that control the government fear
the results of a war with Japan on
their trade and colonies in the
Orient. Fourth, England is being
careful not to antagonize Nationalist
Spain, which thus far has assumed
an apparently neutral attitude
toward the European stew.
