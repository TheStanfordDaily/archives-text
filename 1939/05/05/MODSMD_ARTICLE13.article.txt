# Dink Primes Cindermen For S.C. Win
## Card Track Coach Figures Team Cinch For 55 Points 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Maybe the Cardinal cindermen j
didn't believe their coach, Dink
Templeton, implicitly when he told ■
San Francisco reporters th.it they j
would turn back the mighty U.S.C. i
track team.
But between now and tomorrow
afternoon when they meet the ter
rible Trojans on the Stadium track,
no idea other than beating Crom- i
well's men will be uppermost in
their minds.
Why shouldn't they think so.
Aren't Dink's pupils, Jeffrey, Zagar,
Wohle, Andersen, Brown, and as- J
sistants a cinch for at least 55 j
points. The Daily's dope sheet says i
so and yet it doesn't take a lot of j
important facts into consideration. I
For instance, they have overlooked
that stone bruise acquired by Troy's!
top high hurdler, Jim Humphrey, in
a tangle with a hurdle last Tuesday,
a painful injury which has kept the !
U.S.C. star on crutches most of Ihe!
week. Nor has this dope sheet con- \
sidered the best ever performances j
turned in by Bill Grannis and Alan
Grey during the course of this week.!
Grannis, who was snatched from the l
intramural ranks by Templeton,
soared over the high jump bar at j
6 feet 3 last Tuesday and might be |
the surprise winner in an event that j
is wide open because of illness and
poor shape on the part of the favo- ;
rites.
Grey tossed the shot 49 ft. 4 inches |
earlier in the week and another put ;
like this by him might sweep the |
event for the Indians, thus pushing
the Trojans out of another of those j
important third-place points.
