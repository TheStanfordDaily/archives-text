# Dink Primes Cindermen For S.C. Win
## Card Track Coach Figures Team Cinch For 55 Points 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Maybe the Cardinal cindermen j
didn't believe their coach, Dink
Templeton, implicitly when he told ■
San Francisco reporters th.it they j
would turn back the mighty U.S.C. i
track team.
But between now and tomorrow
afternoon when they meet the ter
rible Trojans on the Stadium track,
no idea other than beating Crom- i
well's men will be uppermost in
their minds.
Why shouldn't they think so.
Aren't Dink's pupils, Jeffrey, Zagar,
Wohle, Andersen, Brown, and as- J
sistants a cinch for at least 55 j
points. The Daily's dope sheet says i
so and yet it doesn't take a lot of j
important facts into consideration. I
For instance, they have overlooked
that stone bruise acquired by Troy's!
top high hurdler, Jim Humphrey, in
a tangle with a hurdle last Tuesday,
a painful injury which has kept the !
U.S.C. star on crutches most of Ihe!
week. Nor has this dope sheet con- \
sidered the best ever performances j
turned in by Bill Grannis and Alan
Grey during the course of this week.!
Grannis, who was snatched from the l
intramural ranks by Templeton,
soared over the high jump bar at j
6 feet 3 last Tuesday and might be |
the surprise winner in an event that j
is wide open because of illness and
poor shape on the part of the favo- ;
rites.
Grey tossed the shot 49 ft. 4 inches |
earlier in the week and another put ;
like this by him might sweep the |
event for the Indians, thus pushing
the Trojans out of another of those j
important third-place points.
And llu'n there is that intangible* thing called by track experts "come
through pcrforinaiicc," which 1 lie predictors have overlooked. This is
often overemphasized, hut never could the situation he more perfect for
surprising up.-cts than 011 the stadium oval tomorrow. For it's a hunch of
leapers and lopers from the South that has been praised to the skies meet-

ing a supposedly hopeless and
ready beaten crew of tracksters from 1
the Farm.
Sure, Clyde Jeffrey will take both I
the dashes and little Dick Carew
could be light up there at Clyde's
heels.
Though Craig Williamson might
not beat U.S.C.'s strong quarter- i
milers, he might bust up their 1110- |
nopoly on first and second place I
points. "Mush" Girard won't take j
the great Zamperini in the mile or j
880 but he'll step in for two seconds |
and with the aid of Emanuel, Fer- j
guson, Soldate, and Moore, might I

hold the rival's yield in the distances J
lo only these two firsts by Zam
perini.
With Humphrey at only half steam
in the high hurdles, Bill Hawkins
can take first and Dick Simpson
could fight oft' the improving Bledsoe
for that valuable third. In the low
barriers Captain Stan Hiserman will
be hard pressed and must hustle to
grab a second place ahead of Troy's
Laret, let alone beat the swift
Vickery.
POOL HOPE IN DISCUS
If Grey can come through in the i
shot and the fast improving Hamp j
Pool get a hold of one in the discus.
U.S.C. can be cut to a mere point !
in the weights.
Things look hopeless in the javelin i
and pole vault with such champions j
as Peoples, DeGroot, Day. and Howe |
on hand. But Bill Braheny is a I
mighty good competitor and has
thrown 211 feet, which is comparable
with what Cromwell's spear tossers
have been doing in the last few |
weeks.
BROWN INJURED
Ray Brown is nursing a sore j
muscle but all a real broad jumper j
needs is one good leap and he has
five points. The high jump is prob- i
ably the most undecided event. Russ i
Wulff and Jim Lincoln of Stanford I
have been in and out of a sick bed !
for the past few weeks and the ;
Trojan jumpers have been slow to I
develop this year.
If it comes down to the relay, i
Templeton has now found a combi- j
nation (hat can match the speed of j
the quartet from Lo.s Angeles. Proof !
of this was the 3:17.8 race run by j
Carew, Rockwell, Williamson, and
Jeffrey during Wednesday's twilighl j
meet.
It looks as though it's a case of j
"it's" and "maybe's" against the un- >
deniable strength of U.S.C. but
stranger things have happened.

Tests indicate that rear tires give
100 per cent more mileage at 55
miles per hour than at 70 miles per
hour.

880 but he'll step in for two seconds |

guson, Soldate, and Moore, might I

hold the rival's yield in the distances J
lo only these two firsts by Zam

in the high hurdles, Bill Hawkins
can take first and Dick Simpson
could fight oft' the improving Bledsoe
for that valuable third. In the low

Laret, let alone beat the swift
Vickery.
POOL HOPE IN DISCUS
If Grey can come through in the i
shot and the fast improving Hamp j
Pool get a hold of one in the discus.
U.S.C. can be cut to a mere point !
in the weights.
Things look hopeless in the javelin i
and pole vault with such champions j
as Peoples, DeGroot, Day. and Howe |
on hand. But Bill Braheny is a I
mighty good competitor and has
thrown 211 feet, which is comparable
with what Cromwell's spear tossers
have been doing in the last few |
weeks.
BROWN INJURED
Ray Brown is nursing a sore j
muscle but all a real broad jumper j
needs is one good leap and he has
five points. The high jump is prob- i
ably the most undecided event. Russ i
Wulff and Jim Lincoln of Stanford I
have been in and out of a sick bed !
for the past few weeks and the ;
Trojan jumpers have been slow to I
develop this year.
If it comes down to the relay, i
Templeton has now found a combi- j
nation (hat can match the speed of j
the quartet from Lo.s Angeles. Proof !
of this was the 3:17.8 race run by j
Carew, Rockwell, Williamson, and
Jeffrey during Wednesday's twilighl j
meet.
It looks as though it's a case of j
"it's" and "maybe's" against the un- >
deniable strength of U.S.C. but
stranger things have happened.

Tests indicate that rear tires give
100 per cent more mileage at 55
miles per hour than at 70 miles per
hour.
Maybe the Cardinal cindermen j
didn't believe their coach, Dink
Templeton, implicitly when he told ■
San Francisco reporters th.it they j
would turn back the mighty U.S.C. i
track team.
But between now and tomorrow
afternoon when they meet the ter
rible Trojans on the Stadium track,
no idea other than beating Crom- i
well's men will be uppermost in
their minds.
Why shouldn't they think so.
Aren't Dink's pupils, Jeffrey, Zagar,
Wohle, Andersen, Brown, and as- J
sistants a cinch for at least 55 j
points. The Daily's dope sheet says i
so and yet it doesn't take a lot of j
important facts into consideration. I
For instance, they have overlooked
that stone bruise acquired by Troy's!
top high hurdler, Jim Humphrey, in
a tangle with a hurdle last Tuesday,
a painful injury which has kept the !
U.S.C. star on crutches most of Ihe!
week. Nor has this dope sheet con- \
sidered the best ever performances j
turned in by Bill Grannis and Alan
Grey during the course of this week.!
Grannis, who was snatched from the l
intramural ranks by Templeton,
soared over the high jump bar at j
6 feet 3 last Tuesday and might be |
the surprise winner in an event that j
is wide open because of illness and
poor shape on the part of the favo- ;
rites.
Grey tossed the shot 49 ft. 4 inches |
earlier in the week and another put ;
like this by him might sweep the |
event for the Indians, thus pushing
the Trojans out of another of those j
important third-place points.
And llu'n there is that intangible* thing called by track experts "come
through pcrforinaiicc," which 1 lie predictors have overlooked. This is
often overemphasized, hut never could the situation he more perfect for
surprising up.-cts than 011 the stadium oval tomorrow. For it's a hunch of
leapers and lopers from the South that has been praised to the skies meet-

ing a supposedly hopeless and
ready beaten crew of tracksters from 1
the Farm.
Sure, Clyde Jeffrey will take both I
the dashes and little Dick Carew
could be light up there at Clyde's
heels.
Though Craig Williamson might
not beat U.S.C.'s strong quarter- i
milers, he might bust up their 1110- |
nopoly on first and second place I
points. "Mush" Girard won't take j
the great Zamperini in the mile or j

Why shouldn't they think so.
Aren't Dink's pupils, Jeffrey, Zagar,
Wohle, Andersen, Brown, and as- J
sistants a cinch for at least 55 j
points. The Daily's dope sheet says i
so and yet it doesn't take a lot of j
important facts into consideration. I
For instance, they have overlooked
that stone bruise acquired by Troy's!
top high hurdler, Jim Humphrey, in
a tangle with a hurdle last Tuesday,
a painful injury which has kept the !
U.S.C. star on crutches most of Ihe!
week. Nor has this dope sheet con- \
sidered the best ever performances j
turned in by Bill Grannis and Alan
Grey during the course of this week.!
Grannis, who was snatched from the l
intramural ranks by Templeton,
soared over the high jump bar at j
6 feet 3 last Tuesday and might be |
the surprise winner in an event that j
is wide open because of illness and
poor shape on the part of the favo- ;
rites.
Grey tossed the shot 49 ft. 4 inches |
earlier in the week and another put ;
like this by him might sweep the |
event for the Indians, thus pushing
the Trojans out of another of those j
important third-place points.
And llu'n there is that intangible* thing called by track experts "come
through pcrforinaiicc," which 1 lie predictors have overlooked. This is
often overemphasized, hut never could the situation he more perfect for
surprising up.-cts than 011 the stadium oval tomorrow. For it's a hunch of
leapers and lopers from the South that has been praised to the skies meet-

ing a supposedly hopeless and
ready beaten crew of tracksters from 1
the Farm.
Sure, Clyde Jeffrey will take both I
the dashes and little Dick Carew
could be light up there at Clyde's
heels.
Though Craig Williamson might
not beat U.S.C.'s strong quarter- i
milers, he might bust up their 1110- |
nopoly on first and second place I
points. "Mush" Girard won't take j
the great Zamperini in the mile or j
880 but he'll step in for two seconds |
and with the aid of Emanuel, Fer- j
guson, Soldate, and Moore, might I

hold the rival's yield in the distances J
lo only these two firsts by Zam
perini.
With Humphrey at only half steam
in the high hurdles, Bill Hawkins
can take first and Dick Simpson
could fight oft' the improving Bledsoe
for that valuable third. In the low
barriers Captain Stan Hiserman will
be hard pressed and must hustle to
grab a second place ahead of Troy's
Laret, let alone beat the swift
Vickery.
POOL HOPE IN DISCUS
If Grey can come through in the i
shot and the fast improving Hamp j
Pool get a hold of one in the discus.
U.S.C. can be cut to a mere point !
in the weights.
Things look hopeless in the javelin i
and pole vault with such champions j
as Peoples, DeGroot, Day. and Howe |
on hand. But Bill Braheny is a I
mighty good competitor and has
thrown 211 feet, which is comparable
with what Cromwell's spear tossers
have been doing in the last few |
weeks.
BROWN INJURED
Ray Brown is nursing a sore j
muscle but all a real broad jumper j
needs is one good leap and he has
five points. The high jump is prob- i
ably the most undecided event. Russ i
Wulff and Jim Lincoln of Stanford I
have been in and out of a sick bed !
for the past few weeks and the ;
Trojan jumpers have been slow to I
develop this year.
If it comes down to the relay, i
Templeton has now found a combi- j
nation (hat can match the speed of j
the quartet from Lo.s Angeles. Proof !
of this was the 3:17.8 race run by j
Carew, Rockwell, Williamson, and
Jeffrey during Wednesday's twilighl j
meet.
It looks as though it's a case of j
"it's" and "maybe's" against the un- >
deniable strength of U.S.C. but
stranger things have happened.

Tests indicate that rear tires give
100 per cent more mileage at 55
miles per hour than at 70 miles per
hour.
Maybe the Cardinal cindermen j
didn't believe their coach, Dink
Templeton, implicitly when he told ■
San Francisco reporters th.it they j
would turn back the mighty U.S.C. i
track team.
But between now and tomorrow
afternoon when they meet the ter
rible Trojans on the Stadium track,
no idea other than beating Crom- i
well's men will be uppermost in
their minds.
Why shouldn't they think so.
