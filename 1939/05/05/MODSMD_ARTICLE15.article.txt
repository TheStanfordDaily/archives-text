# Union Hashers Depreciate Fresh Orange Juice Value
## 
### BUD AMES 
Last Monday morning, interested
readers glanced hastily through
a nearly full column editorial on
the merits of freshly-squeezed or
ange juice prepared to the indi
vidual customer's order in the Cel
lar. Always willing to comply,
Cellar authorities have dusted ofT
a little-used squeezer machine, and
have announced they are in the
freshly-squeezed orange juice busi
ness.
Cold facts yesterday recorded the
response of those interested read
ers. Yesterday's sales of freshly
squeezed orange juice had increased
more than 1000 per cent over Wed
nesday's sales. Yes â€” one glass of
freshly-squeezed orange juice had
been sold Wednesday and 12 whole
glasses had been sold when the Cel-

lar lads began turning oIT faucets
for the night.
Already busy Cellar hashers con
sidered the task of squeezing fresh
orange juice a bother. Finally one
of the white-coated workers yelled
across the counter at the gentlemen
of the press.
"It's silly and it's a lot of trouble.
Besides, I'll bet the pulp is bad for
you," he quipped.
"No," retaliated the press. "If or
ange juice sits for long it loses its
vitamin C."
B"wildered, the hasher leaned
confidentially across the counter and
with nothing but sincerity in his
! voice he questioned, "Where does it
, nlj
go?
The gentlemen of the press shook
' their shoulders and left.
