## 
### 
Delivering the main address at a
dinner honoring the presidents of
three railroads at the opening of the
new Union Station at Los Angeles,
President Ray Lyman Wilbur warn
ed Southern California that its fu
ture greatness must rest on some
thing more than the exploitation of
its natural resources.
Speaking further on Southern
California, Dr. Wilbur said, "It can
go on using invention after inven
tion, as it, has used the l-ailroad and
motion picture, or it can, by per
verse use of human qualities, incite
internal disorder, do foolish, waste
ful, and destructive things."
Dr. Wilbur listed four questions
the race must manage to solve if hu
man rights arc to survive. He point
ed out that "the power of the human
mind and of the human spirit is
great almost beyond conception. But.
that, power can be as great in de
struction as it has been in con
struction."
