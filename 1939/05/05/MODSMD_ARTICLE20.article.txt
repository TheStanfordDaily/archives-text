# Drive Reaches $3000 Mark
## Totals $500 Over Last Year's Figure 
### 
The Convalescent Home Drive
treasury went over the 3000-mark
last night, scoring a total of $3039.85.
according to Ken Cuthbcrtson,
treasurer.
Last night's total marked a $509.31
increase over the same period of
time last year. The marked increase

in receipts in this year's drive has
been due to more generous campus
contributions, Clint Olson, drive
chairman, said.
Today will be the final day of the
University drive, and the off-campus
drive ended at 10 o'clock last night.
No final results on the off-campus
drive were available.
Wednesday's totals were as fol
lows:
Living groups, $144.25; all-Univer
sity units, $13.15; golf tourney, $33;
Magic Lamp, $54.33; Labor Day con
cessions, $50.48; off-campus, $256.10;
total, $551.31.
Yesterday's returns to 8 o'clock in
cluded only living groups, amounted
to $281.48.
Proceeds from the Sophomre
Carnival last Friday night and the
Strawberry Brunch Tuesday will
not be in until late this month or
early June, according to Cuthbert
son. It is expected that they will
swell the drive total materially.
