# FIREHOUSE MEN PLAN REUNION
## 
### 
Stanford ex-firemen from away
' back are planning to meet this year
i on University Day when as many of
' them as respond to invitations issued
fby Chris Baldo, graduate student
I and lieutenant of the local fire de
' partment, return for an ex-firemen's
| reunion.
j Representatives of Stanford fire
i fighters from as far back as 1904
! are expected to turn up at the Uni
! versity Day gathering. Baldo is at
J least assured of one of the 1909 crop
in the person of Almon E. Roth,
former University comptroller,
! whose campus home is opposite ihe
present location of the firehouse.
Baldo, who is promoting the re
| union, comments on it:
"Such gatherings foster contact
| between business and professional
men who were former student fire
-1 men and the present student, fire-
I men, and also induces former
| members to visit the department to
! see what progress has taken place
t and to renew old acquaintances.
| Furthermore, the uniqueness of the
Stanford Fire Department, it being
| the only fire department in the
world which is owned and operated
! by a university and manned by stu
j dents, enables us to point with pride
I to our former living group."
