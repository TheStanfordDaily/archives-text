# Swing Breaks Into Society In Hot Music' Publications
## 
### 
Swing had the misfortune to en
ter the world's culture by the back
door. Instead of slipping gracefully
through columned haiiways into
"period" drawing rooms, like Bach
or Mozart, it made the mistake of
choosing the servants' entrance.
Up from the gutter, from cheap
cafes and dime dance halls where
$15-a-week sales girls and delivery
truck drivers bow to its pulsating
rhythms, swing has had to fight for
social acceptance. An evidence of
impending victory may be the almost
simultaneous issuance of three pub
lished works on hot music.
Perhaps the most important of
these is the English translation of
the famous French book, "Le Jazz
Hot," by Hugues Penasse (Wit
mark). Recognized as the greatest
modern critic of swing, Penassie has
turned out an authentic, objective
treatise on hot music that defines the
terms, lists different styles, consid
ers their principal exponents.
ARRANGERS PRAISED
A chapter is devoted to Louis
"Satchmo" Armstrong, and to Duke
Ellington. Naming the outstanding
improvisors, Penassie analyzes the
techniques of Bix Beiderbecke, Earl
Hines, Henderson, Trumbauer, Tea
garden and a host of other "ride
men.'' Arrangers come in for their
share of praise from Penassie, and
he speaks briefly of the "best or
chestras" of today. A complete ap
pendix lists the outstanding records
by notable rhythm groups — from
ragtime, jazz, and gut-bucket to
swing and modern hot music.
A personal account of swing mu
sic in America is Benny Goodman's
"The Kingdom of Swing" (Stack
pole). Conversational, relaxed in
tone, the 265-page account rushes

along with the same ease as the
King of Swing's music. If you read
no other part of the book, at least
look at Benny's story of his sky
rocket success at the Palomar. The
virtuoso of the clarinet was aided
and abetted in writing the volume
by Irving Kolodin, noted American
music critic.
SCHOLARLY APPROACH
Without trying to prove that jazz
is better than Bach, Wilder Hobson,
formerly an editor of Fortune
magazine, has written a serious con
sideration of hot music in "Ameri
can Jazz Music" (Norton). Almost
scholarly in approach, the volume
discusses jazz as a natural musical
language.
Tracing its origin and growth
over the brief 20-year period of its
life, the bok localizes swing styles
—the New Orleans group. Chicago
period, jazz in New York, commer
cial and concert jazz. The elements
of swing structure are defined.
The last chapter lists 30 great
swing records. Hines, Armstrong,
Beiderbecke, Ellington, Norvo, Cole
man, Hawkins are represented.
Standouts are Bob Crosby's "Who's
Sorry Now," Count Basie's "Swingin'
the Blues," and Goodman's "I Must
Have that Man."
Whether you're an ardent swing
fan, or whether you believe swing
is the grinding noise that precedes
the collapse of civilization, you'll
find interesting reading, full of
vitality and enthusiasm, in these
three books.—Hutchinson.

ragtime, jazz, and gut-bucket to
swing and modern hot music.
A personal account of swing mu
sic in America is Benny Goodman's
"The Kingdom of Swing" (Stack
pole). Conversational, relaxed in
tone, the 265-page account rushes

along with the same ease as the
King of Swing's music. If you read
no other part of the book, at least
look at Benny's story of his sky
rocket success at the Palomar. The
virtuoso of the clarinet was aided
and abetted in writing the volume
by Irving Kolodin, noted American
music critic.
SCHOLARLY APPROACH
Without trying to prove that jazz
is better than Bach, Wilder Hobson,
formerly an editor of Fortune
magazine, has written a serious con
sideration of hot music in "Ameri
can Jazz Music" (Norton). Almost
scholarly in approach, the volume
discusses jazz as a natural musical
language.
Tracing its origin and growth
over the brief 20-year period of its
life, the bok localizes swing styles
—the New Orleans group. Chicago
period, jazz in New York, commer
cial and concert jazz. The elements
of swing structure are defined.
The last chapter lists 30 great
swing records. Hines, Armstrong,
Beiderbecke, Ellington, Norvo, Cole
man, Hawkins are represented.
Standouts are Bob Crosby's "Who's
Sorry Now," Count Basie's "Swingin'
the Blues," and Goodman's "I Must
Have that Man."
Whether you're an ardent swing
fan, or whether you believe swing
is the grinding noise that precedes
the collapse of civilization, you'll
find interesting reading, full of
vitality and enthusiasm, in these
three books.—Hutchinson.

Swing had the misfortune to en
ter the world's culture by the back
door. Instead of slipping gracefully
through columned haiiways into
"period" drawing rooms, like Bach
or Mozart, it made the mistake of
choosing the servants' entrance.
Up from the gutter, from cheap
cafes and dime dance halls where
$15-a-week sales girls and delivery
truck drivers bow to its pulsating
rhythms, swing has had to fight for
social acceptance. An evidence of
impending victory may be the almost
simultaneous issuance of three pub
lished works on hot music.
Perhaps the most important of
these is the English translation of
the famous French book, "Le Jazz
Hot," by Hugues Penasse (Wit
mark). Recognized as the greatest
modern critic of swing, Penassie has
turned out an authentic, objective
treatise on hot music that defines the
terms, lists different styles, consid
ers their principal exponents.
ARRANGERS PRAISED
A chapter is devoted to Louis
"Satchmo" Armstrong, and to Duke
Ellington. Naming the outstanding
improvisors, Penassie analyzes the
techniques of Bix Beiderbecke, Earl
Hines, Henderson, Trumbauer, Tea
garden and a host of other "ride
men.'' Arrangers come in for their
share of praise from Penassie, and
he speaks briefly of the "best or
chestras" of today. A complete ap
pendix lists the outstanding records
by notable rhythm groups — from
ragtime, jazz, and gut-bucket to
swing and modern hot music.
