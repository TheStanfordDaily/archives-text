## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Spring Gridmen Show Promise For Fall Squad Thornhill Gripes Over Perennial Linemen Set-up 
### 
Spring footballers took on all the
appearances of a hard-working fall
squad as they ran through a make
shift scrimmage last night.
Coach Tiny Thornhill is still ex
perimenting to find the right com
binations and playÂ« that will click,
but the Indian mentor said he has
two backfields that can do all right.
He complained of his usual
trouble, twice as many backfield
players as linemen.
Norm Standlce, Gene Coldiron,
Jim Groves, and Pete Fay form one
backfield, while the frosh form the
other, Frank Albert, Pete Kmeto
vic, Don Grant, and Bob Temple
ton, a transfer.
But the backs aren't the problem
now. Tiny's trying to build a lino
to replace the men that graduated
and fill the holes that were weak
last year, too.
There are three fine ends, Andy
Stojkovich, Bill Willard, and Stan
Graff, not to mention Art Meiners
and Fred Meyer and John Gojko
vich. In the tackle spot Swede Jo
hannessen showed up especially
well last night, as did "Wink" Jones.
Stan Andersen will be out as soon
as track is over.
Dave Patterson and Steve Keuseff
took good care of the guard posts
scrimmaging against the Reds' Paul
Herringer and Bill Trout. Hamp
Pool is still a question-mark as far
as eligibility goes.
The center spot seems to be
empty with the absence of Tony
Calvelli, but Colin McClintock
seems to be working in pretty well.
He may have competition from Jake
Thompson and Doug Stahle.
