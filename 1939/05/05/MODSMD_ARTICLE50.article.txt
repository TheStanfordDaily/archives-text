ARDINALS be damned."
When that statement was made yes
terday, it meant exactly what it says.
For some time, Stanford has talked vaguely
of "democracy." Main charge against Cardi
nals is that it is "undemocratic." It is, but why?
Democracy at Stanford means representative
government. As such, it also means a response
to the will of the majority; conservatives like it
or not. Too, it means something more than a
system of student government.
It is, in a sense, a social relationship.
The "hello" tradition of former years is an
out-of-date example of that relationship. Boat
house Day, when everybody had a good time
together celebrating a new addition to the
University, was another example.
The day -to - day administration of student
body affairs, the student manager system, stu
dent body publications, extra-curricular activ
ities, are all evidences of that democracy at
work.
That, partially, covers the meaning of the
democracy which Stanford holds so near and
dear.
Certainly, it's far better than any more ex
treme type of University control that could be
set up.
Does Cardinals fit into this picture?
That group was originally established as an
administrative right - hand of Ex Committee.
Since then, in practice, it has become a body
of delegated authority. It has made its own
rules to a great extent; it has made its own
appointments, become self-perpetuating. It is
representative of no group or individual other
than itself.
Self - perpetuation, autocratic and arbitrary
use of authority do not fit into the rest of the
scene. Neither does the "honor" aspect that
Cardinals has assumed, since for all these
years Stanford has carefully refrained from set
ting up any major honor society like the Oval
Club idea which prevails elsewhere.
True, delegated authority and the commit
tee system have and do play a part in Stan
ford's democracy; but within the limits which
Cardinals has transcended.
With the establishment of the Activities Co
ordination Committee, there is no reason why
Cardinals should not be abolished, should not
be replaced by the method that will thereby
fit more aptly into the Stanford picture.
The committee will be a committee of ex
perts â€”but experts under the control of Ex Com
mittee; delegated authority operating under
restraint, and not arbitrary in character since
its functions and duties will be adequately
described by the constitutional provisions by
which it is established.
It is, then, the proper time.
Let Cardinals go.
