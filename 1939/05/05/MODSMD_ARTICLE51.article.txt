# Pre-Helsingfors Show

•"pHERE'S going to be a good show in the
-L Stadium tomorrow.
Of course, current dope sheets don't give
Stanford much of a chance. Roger Williams,
S.F. News sportswriter, gives the Trojan track
men a 69-62 victory. And Don Liebendorfer's
prediction averaged with those of Daily seers
is still less optimistic, giving Troy a 12V2-WJV2
win.
But the ccfld dope on Friday morning doesn't
always coincide with Saturday's hard facts. We
are reminded on the sports page today of Hum
phrey's bad foot, of Dink Templeton's promise
of a Cardinal win, of that famous intangible,
"come-through performance."
Of course, the meet will be in the Stadium—
more often known as the wind-tunnel—instead
of Angell Field. But the wind will blow against
U.S.C. as well as against Stanford—they'll both
be running in the same direction.
Whether Stanford wins or not, moreover, it
will be a good show, stars being a brilliant ag
gregation of Olympics possibilities and proba
bilities. From Stanford Andersen, Jeffrey, Za
gar, and Wohle. From Troy—Zamperini, Vick
ery, Day, Humphreys, Peoples, and De Groot.
Spectators may not see a Stanford victory.
They will see a Stanford team fighting for vic
tory. They will see an Olympics preview.
