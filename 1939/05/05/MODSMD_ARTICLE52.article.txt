# See if It Isn't

### 
THIS is the year that Stanford spent SlO,OOO
for a new Boathouse, the year when canoe
ing and water sports were supposed to hit an
all-time high. But something went wrong; it
didn't rain.
The official inauguration came and went with
only a suggestion of a mudbank around the
edge of Lagunita, but by the start of spring
quarter the tide took a turn for the worse. The
water unmistakably was snubbing the parvenu
Boathouse.

When the junior class sot about planning its
annual Water Carnival, it realized that it couldn't
sail floats on a muddy lake-bottom. Consulting
the Convalescent Home Drive files, the mem
bers discovered that seven years ago the Big
Game bonfire site was ready six months too
soon. The Water Carnival was staged in the
Encina Pools that year, with novelty races and
comic events, and it was rated one of the best
in history.
Today again the junior class will take refuge
in the concrete swimming hole.
The empty lake has resulted in a desertion
of tradition and a chance to tip the Water Car
nival out of the groove. It will be a clambake, a
jam-session, submarine swing.
This afternoon at two. — L. L.
