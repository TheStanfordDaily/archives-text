THE MINSTRELS SING . . .
SOCIOLOGISTS who are in the market for the lat
est spring styles in trends will find a new model
in this mornin's Campus Opinion column. Accord
ing to a letter from New York, communists played col
lege songs, including "Sons of the Stanford Red, at
their May Day parade. In this fact a good observer
should find enough trends to fill a dissertation.
Personally, I have no objection to letting the com
munists use "Sons of the Stanford Red," although it
may make the trustees squirm a little; and I don't
dare think what will happen if the Dies Committee
hears about it. After all, it is a good song, and the
words are rather appropriate.

There Is no particular reason why the communists
shouldn't iise the tune. Of course, Stanford is hardly
a stronghold of Leninism; but no one is likely to iden
tify us with the Revolution simply because one of our
football songs is played on May Day. Hie words of
"America" are set to the tune of "God Save the King,"
and the British don't regard that as grounds for sever
ing diplomatic relations.
I hope, though, that the communists used the song
simply because they liked the tune. If they were try
ing to capture college spirit and identify themselves
with American universities they chose the wrong set
of songs. '.O'Reilly's Daughter" and "Little Redwing"
are much more typical of the American campus.

AS a matter of fact, if the communists are trying to
build up a good musical repertoire, the best thing
they could do would be to learn the songs that are
sung in fraternity dining rooms on the nghts when
there are no guests. When the Reds pick the ordinary
football tunes, they miss the effect entirely.
The typical college songs are the ones that are not
sung at rallies. And these are t*he ones that would
identify the communists most closely with American
universities. Besides that, they are the songs that
would appeal most to American youth.
And then, too, songs of this type cannot be topped
for pure tunefulness. "O'Reilly's Daughter" is a mag
nificent marching song; in it we can almost hear the
pounding feet of a regiment. And in that song about
the English king who lived long years ago there is a
swinging rhythm that compares with the best of the
"Light Cavalry Overture."
The communists are wasting their time with foot
ball songs. Evidently they have seen too many Holly
wood versions of college life. In my opinion, the
cause of Leninism could be advanced a generation if
its leaders would take notes on the incidental music
for a fraternity dinner.
