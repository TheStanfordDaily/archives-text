# Lightly . . . And Politely
## NAUGHTY GIRLS 
### DOUG JAQUES 
The olhcr night, a couple of little Roble girls went
into a Roble phone booth and spent several minutes
calling all of the fraternities and men's hulls on the
campus.
They gave them the old line: We arc a couple of
lonesome Paly girls, ;md we are cooking up a little
party, and why don't you come. Of course you can
come, or if you can't come someone there can. We
will be on the corner of blah and blah. Meet us there
in a half hour.
Tile next day the girls claimed that nearly every
men's living group on the campus had one or more
representatives down at the corner. Waiting for
nothing.
