In the play "Shoemaker's Holiday," there was a
line near the end which ran somethng like, "Jesus
bless you lord.''
That line was the joy of the bit part players. They
all gave it en masse. They used lo wait for it to
come. They would dwell on it, accent it. "Jesus!
bless you lord."
At. the last rehearsals and first three performances
it was, "JESUS bless you lord."
But at the last show they all missed their cue, all
but one guy. "JESUS." he bellowed, and saw that he
was speaking the part alone, and let it drop.
The other characters picked up their parts, aiid
the play went on, passing right over the apparently un
expected interruption, that surprising expletive.
