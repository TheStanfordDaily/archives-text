A Sigma Nu passing through the food-line at the
barbecue Wednesday was being ribbed a little by the
girl giving out the ice cream. She was cracking about
his beard. "So you're growing another beard," she
said.
"Yeah." To himself he was saying, "Icc cream, oh
boy."
"So you think you can grow a beard," she said.
"Sure," he answered, and to himself he said, "Lots
of ice cream. Nothing but icc cream."
He only had eyes for the ice cream.
"What color?" she said, going on with the ribbing.
"Strawberry," he said, putting out his hand for the
| icc cream.
