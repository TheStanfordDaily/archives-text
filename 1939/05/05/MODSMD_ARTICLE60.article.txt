# STANFORD RED?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
This morning I received a letter
from one of my friends who is vis
iting in New York. It contained the
following excerpt in which I think
you might be interested:
"While on my way to ... I
heard a band playing 'Sons of the
Stanford Red.' and on investigating
found it was in the regular Com
munist parade held here every May
Day. It sure made me sore. They
must have paraded about two hours
and the streets were jammed. Other
college tunes were played. It seems
to me something should be done
about such a thing."
