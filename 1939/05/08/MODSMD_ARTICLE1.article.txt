### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
piVE YEARS ago when the nation
knell, at the shrine of the Blue
Eagle and General Johnson was the
high priest of the New Deal, ordi
nary citizens expressed considerable
surprise at the administration's call
ing in college professors and tech
nical experts to advise it on how to
conquer the Depression. "The Brain
Trust," they called these lean the
orizers in gold-rimmed glasses who
had displaced old-fashioned, pot
bellied politicians.
Today the United States has be
come conditioned to academic ad
vice. It has even become used to
the government's producing plays
and painting murals. But when it
calls in a radical artist-architect to
design a complete new national
highway system, a project which
will call for federalization of one of
the chief subjects of local control,
even the callous are bound to stir.
>h # *
For five years Norman Bel
Geddes, designer of innumerable
spectacular stage settings, func
tional buildings, and cities of to
morrow, has been consulting with
olliicals of the national highway
administration and with the Presi
dent of the United States. From
these conferences, from years of
intensive study and planning has
come an idea which will make it
p'ossihle to drive across the
country at 100 miles per hour.
Claiming that, his system will
eliminate head-on collisions and the
dangers of drunken drivers and road
hogs, Bel Geddes divides each unit
of his highway system into six lanes
separated by walls, on which
speeds of 50, 75, and 100 miles per
hour will be required. Turns may
be made on his roads at 50 with
less banking than in present
highway construction, and inclines
will be only half as steep as they
are now.
$ # *
yi T PRESENT highways and high
way construction are in the
hands of the states, with the federal
government interfering only to grant
subsidies and finance WPA projects.
The projected system would require
that Washington take over the sys
tem to insure uniform administra
tion for the high-speed roads.
Instead of running across the
country from one metropolis to an
other, the Bel Geddes brain child
will he fed as it passes large cities,
hut will stay clear of them and
their suburban traffic. Sociolog
ically designed, the national high
way system is supposed to meet
all the requirements of America
today and in the future.
"There is nothing morally wrong
with travelling faster than 40 miles
an hour as long as it can be done
safely," reasons Norman Bel Geddes,
and the rational man must agree. If
the automobiles of the future are
going to be capable of high speeds,
there is no reason why roads should
not, be built to accommodate them.
Of course, at present the idea is in
the visionary stage. Under ordinary
circumstances such a project would
attract little attention outside of
technical journals. But, when
Franklin D. Roosevelt and the coun
try's leading experts on transporta
tion are working with Bel Geddes, it
is time to take notice. The President
has long been interested in pro
gressive movements of this kind, and
then too, he often is willing to
finance them.

For five years Norman Bel
Geddes, designer of innumerable
spectacular stage settings, func
tional buildings, and cities of to
morrow, has been consulting with
olliicals of the national highway
administration and with the Presi
dent of the United States. From
these conferences, from years of
intensive study and planning has
come an idea which will make it
p'ossihle to drive across the
country at 100 miles per hour.
Claiming that, his system will
eliminate head-on collisions and the
dangers of drunken drivers and road
hogs, Bel Geddes divides each unit
of his highway system into six lanes
separated by walls, on which
speeds of 50, 75, and 100 miles per
hour will be required. Turns may
be made on his roads at 50 with
less banking than in present
highway construction, and inclines
will be only half as steep as they
are now.
$ # *
yi T PRESENT highways and high
way construction are in the
hands of the states, with the federal
government interfering only to grant
subsidies and finance WPA projects.
The projected system would require
that Washington take over the sys
tem to insure uniform administra
tion for the high-speed roads.
Instead of running across the
country from one metropolis to an
other, the Bel Geddes brain child
will he fed as it passes large cities,
hut will stay clear of them and
their suburban traffic. Sociolog
ically designed, the national high
way system is supposed to meet
all the requirements of America
today and in the future.
"There is nothing morally wrong
with travelling faster than 40 miles
an hour as long as it can be done
safely," reasons Norman Bel Geddes,
and the rational man must agree. If
the automobiles of the future are
going to be capable of high speeds,
there is no reason why roads should
not, be built to accommodate them.
Of course, at present the idea is in
the visionary stage. Under ordinary
circumstances such a project would
attract little attention outside of
technical journals. But, when
Franklin D. Roosevelt and the coun
try's leading experts on transporta
tion are working with Bel Geddes, it
is time to take notice. The President
has long been interested in pro
gressive movements of this kind, and
then too, he often is willing to
finance them.
