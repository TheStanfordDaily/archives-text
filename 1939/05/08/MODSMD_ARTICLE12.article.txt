# Gordy Davis Deplores Accident Rise
## 
### BUD AMES 
; "There have been move auto ac
i cidents since registration day this
' spring quarter than during the en
j tire fall and winter quarters eom
! bined," Gordy Davis, the man with '
I the shiny star, disgustedly snorted I
| yesterday afternoon.
Officer Davis followed his first
i verbal tirade against campus driv
! ers by more than forcefully con- j
! tinuing, "And Stanford drivers
are becoming generally negligent and I
inattentive behind the wheel."
When questioned as to the crimes :
most frequently perpetrated by cam- I
pus drivers, Davis admitted that
I only official records were under iock
i and key in one of the Comptroller's
pigeon holes, but that generally
I speaking, parking delinquencies
I were most numerous, with speeding
| offenses running a poor second.
The perennial problem of passen
j gers-on-the-running-board also ac
j counts for frequent informal visits
! with Men's Council, according to
Davis. New and fourth running
problem arises out of the childish
college desire for noise which more
than a few drivers have satiated by
I cutting, or entirely removing, ex
i haust mufflers.
"Strangely enough," he went on, I
j "four out of five of the campus au- j
j tomobile accidents have been caused
i by cars hitting such stationary ob
j jects as stumps and sign posts, and
i not by collisions between two mov
ing cars. Obviously, such accidents
| could only occur when drivers take
j their eyes off the road in order to
pick something off the car floor
1 or " Here Officer Davis stopped.

Continuing, he next verbally hack
ed with much fervor those drivers
who, despite all known regulations,
still insist upon exceeding estab
lished speed limits.

â–º "Distances between buildings arc
small on the campus," said Davis,
"and therefore, speed is not neces
sary. Particularly noticeable to both
myself and Officer Burns has been
the speeding near the Quad, even
though it is there that automobile
i and pedestrian traffic is mosi. con
gested."
Luckily enough, however, actual
tabulations show that to date this
' year there has been only one se
rious accident entailing bodily harm
on the campus. In addition there
have been approximately only three
accidents which have necessitated
first, aid.
"And the students may consider
themselves lucky that there have
been so few accidents," Davis con
cluded. "There is much room for
driving improvement. Stanford
drivers arc generally good about
stopping for signs, but their hand
signalling is poor. If campus driv
ers give the proper signals, they will
avoid much driving confusion and
many future accidents."
