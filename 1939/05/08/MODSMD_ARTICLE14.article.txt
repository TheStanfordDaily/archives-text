# International Settlement Threatened
## 
### 

JAPANESE DEMANDS for a "thoroughgoing reorganization" of the
International Settlement and suppression of "anti-Japanese activities
by citizens of third powers" in Shanghai was construed as an implied
threat to occupy the settlement and the French Concession, where
this statue of peace is located. The statue, on Avenue Edward VII,
is at the dividing line of the two foreign areas.
