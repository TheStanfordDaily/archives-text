Ihc 1939 Stanford Quad, seven
tons of yearbooks are rapidly
neai'ing completion for their
campus release on May .22.
The 15,000 pounds of Quads,
still unbound, will have travel
ed, in parts, over 3,800 miles be
fore Ihey finally make their
way to the Farm. Covers of the
book were sent to the East for
a secret processing commer

There, a coating of cellophane
was applied, adding luster and
protective covering to the
books and swelling the total
weight of the books by 250
pounds.

will be the 15th. A few books
may be ordered after that date
but will not be delivered until
shortly after the first ship
