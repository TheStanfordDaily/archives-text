members, it would promote co-oper
ation and stimulate interest in Uni
versity affairs.
That a program be worked out by
the executive board and report of
important changes on the campus be
made annually was also suggested.
ANNUAL REPORT
Henry Houser, president of the
association, delivered his annual re
port which will be published in di
gest form in the Illustrated Review.
The more formal aspect of the
get-together was dispensed with in
the morning, and the various alumni
were free to attend their reunion
luncheons and dinners and the
Stanford-U.S.C. track meet.
Aside from hundreds of delegates
lrom all over California there were
about 80 delegates from Oregon and
Nevada. Official delegates from all
the classes—lB92 to 1939—were also
present, together with representa
tives of Stanford clubs and profes
sional societies.
