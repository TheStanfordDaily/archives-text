# CAMPUS OPINION
## EAT IT, HOLTOM 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
After writing reviews in The I
Daily for three years and reading
letters from disgruntled cast mem
bers of shows that did not receive 1
wholly favorable write-ups, I was,
not surprised to see Dan Holtom's |
letter in Campus Opinion. In fact, I
rather expected to see it before. He's
an old timer at the game of second
guessing the reviewer.
Now, admittedly, some reviews — |
like some shows—are bad. Very few,
however, are unfair. That is one
thing these back-stage reviewers i
fail to sense. To them, an unfavor
able review—because it is unfavor
able— must necessarily be written
by a vindictive moron. On the other
hand, to give them credit, they often
drop around to tell the reviewer, if j
he has praised the performance, that,
he is brave, clean, reverent, help
ful .. .
AUDIENCE ANGLE
j The one thing these boys forget— j
i and it is easy to understand, per
| haps, why they should—is that the I
I reviewer is seeing the play from the :
| audience's angle, not from the per- ,
I formers'.
To say that the cast and stage |
j crew worked long hours on a play j
j to whip it into shape may be true,
but it makes no difference to the |
audience if the play is not well done, j
It is unfortunate perhaps that
: such hard work—and there is no
doubt that it is one of the most
grueling activities at Stanford — j
should sometimes go unappreciated. |
But the play's the thing. And the 1
| reviewer — and the audience — is '
j judging the play.
| NOT ALL PERFECT
It seems to me rather a sign of i
conceit, for members of Stanford I
[ casts to insist that every production i
i is the acme of perfection. And it ;
| seems too bad that they should take !
j it so to heart when, for one reason
; or another, one play out of a half !
; dozen fails to click. It happens in j
! the best of companies.
But what is more important, they |
i forget that every reviewer that's
I written on The Daily since I've been j
here has been actively interested in j
seeing Stanford dramatics improve.
If one, now and then, misses fire a ;
little, the reviewer usually regrets it
as much as the cast. Most of us
writing in the paper have followed I
j the plays with active sympathy, take I
I iust as much interest in congratu
| lating fine work as the casts in re- j
] ceiving it.
BIASED EVIDENCE
[ One other thing. Never omitted
from the gripe letters which a re
j viewer receives—most of them from
j the casts —is the comment that "those
j in the audience I talked to thought
' the play was swell."
Well, naturally. And it proves
i nothing. The reviewer, if he wanted
to, could dig up a list of people who
read his review and "thought it was
swell." He would certainly hesi
tate to prove his point by such
j biased evidence. But others ?
I remember once having Thomas
Wood Stevens tell me, when I spoke
j to him about the dramatic work,
: that he considered it a serious
j breach of dramatic etiquette for cast
j members to gripe about reviews.
IMPROVE NEXT ONE
His point was that, after failing to
! meet audience standards on one
i production, the only thing to do was
i to make the next performance so
superior that it would wash out the
taste of the last one.
And Mr. Stevens had the right
idea. He knew the theater and he
knew reviewers. He had been too
long in the game to accept review
| ers' standards if. in his honest opin
' ion, they were unjust to his work;

on the other hand, he did not hesi
tate to accept critical comment which
might sometimes point out flaws in
a given production.
No letters, no gripes, just better
performances next time.
All right, Mr. Holtom, what's your
next production?

The Editor, Sir:
After writing reviews in The I
Daily for three years and reading
letters from disgruntled cast mem
bers of shows that did not receive 1
wholly favorable write-ups, I was,
not surprised to see Dan Holtom's |
letter in Campus Opinion. In fact, I
rather expected to see it before. He's
an old timer at the game of second
guessing the reviewer.
Now, admittedly, some reviews — |
like some shows—are bad. Very few,
however, are unfair. That is one
thing these back-stage reviewers i
fail to sense. To them, an unfavor
able review—because it is unfavor
able— must necessarily be written
by a vindictive moron. On the other
hand, to give them credit, they often
drop around to tell the reviewer, if j
he has praised the performance, that,
he is brave, clean, reverent, help
ful .. .
AUDIENCE ANGLE
j The one thing these boys forget— j
i and it is easy to understand, per
| haps, why they should—is that the I
I reviewer is seeing the play from the :
| audience's angle, not from the per- ,
I formers'.
To say that the cast and stage |
j crew worked long hours on a play j
j to whip it into shape may be true,
but it makes no difference to the |
audience if the play is not well done, j
It is unfortunate perhaps that
: such hard work—and there is no
doubt that it is one of the most
grueling activities at Stanford — j
should sometimes go unappreciated. |
But the play's the thing. And the 1
| reviewer — and the audience — is '
j judging the play.
| NOT ALL PERFECT
It seems to me rather a sign of i
conceit, for members of Stanford I
[ casts to insist that every production i
i is the acme of perfection. And it ;
| seems too bad that they should take !
j it so to heart when, for one reason
; or another, one play out of a half !
; dozen fails to click. It happens in j
! the best of companies.
But what is more important, they |
i forget that every reviewer that's
I written on The Daily since I've been j
here has been actively interested in j
seeing Stanford dramatics improve.
If one, now and then, misses fire a ;
little, the reviewer usually regrets it
as much as the cast. Most of us

j crew worked long hours on a play j
j to whip it into shape may be true,
but it makes no difference to the |
audience if the play is not well done, j
It is unfortunate perhaps that
: such hard work—and there is no
doubt that it is one of the most
grueling activities at Stanford — j
should sometimes go unappreciated. |
But the play's the thing. And the 1
| reviewer — and the audience — is '
j judging the play.
| NOT ALL PERFECT
It seems to me rather a sign of i
conceit, for members of Stanford I
[ casts to insist that every production i
i is the acme of perfection. And it ;
| seems too bad that they should take !
j it so to heart when, for one reason
; or another, one play out of a half !
; dozen fails to click. It happens in j
! the best of companies.
But what is more important, they |
i forget that every reviewer that's
I written on The Daily since I've been j
here has been actively interested in j
seeing Stanford dramatics improve.
If one, now and then, misses fire a ;
little, the reviewer usually regrets it
as much as the cast. Most of us
writing in the paper have followed I
j the plays with active sympathy, take I
I iust as much interest in congratu
| lating fine work as the casts in re- j
] ceiving it.
BIASED EVIDENCE
[ One other thing. Never omitted
from the gripe letters which a re
j viewer receives—most of them from
j the casts —is the comment that "those
j in the audience I talked to thought
' the play was swell."
Well, naturally. And it proves
i nothing. The reviewer, if he wanted
to, could dig up a list of people who
read his review and "thought it was
swell." He would certainly hesi
tate to prove his point by such
j biased evidence. But others ?
I remember once having Thomas
Wood Stevens tell me, when I spoke
j to him about the dramatic work,
: that he considered it a serious
j breach of dramatic etiquette for cast
j members to gripe about reviews.
IMPROVE NEXT ONE
His point was that, after failing to
! meet audience standards on one
i production, the only thing to do was
i to make the next performance so
superior that it would wash out the
taste of the last one.
And Mr. Stevens had the right
idea. He knew the theater and he
knew reviewers. He had been too
long in the game to accept review
| ers' standards if. in his honest opin
' ion, they were unjust to his work;

on the other hand, he did not hesi
tate to accept critical comment which
might sometimes point out flaws in
a given production.
No letters, no gripes, just better
performances next time.
All right, Mr. Holtom, what's your
next production?
