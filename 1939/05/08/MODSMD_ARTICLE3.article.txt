# Rome, Berlin Convert Axis To War Pact
## Britain Fears Duce Lost as Mediator Of Polish Trouble 
### 
MILAN, Italy, May 7 (UP).—Ger
many and Italy today converted the
Rome-Berlin axis into -an outright
military a means of ''effi
ciently preserving peace in Europe,"
it was announced after a twcv-day
conference of the Italo-German for
eign ministers here.
1 Announcement of the fighting pact
between Fuehrer Adolf Hitler and
Premier Benito Mussolini struck a
major blow at Anglo-French efforts
to create an effective, armed "peace
front" among Europe's nations and
at Britain's hopes of ultimately
weaning II Duce away from his ties
\yith Hitler.
' The effects of the new military al
liance on Mussolini's reported readi
ness to assume a role of peace
maker between Poland and Ger
many were disputed among foreign
diplomats.
DUCE AS MEDIATOR
British comment held these hopes
had been shattered but French dip
lomats contended Mussolini, in or
der to safeguard her new responsi
bilities and prevent Italy from be
coming involved in war, would in
crease his efforts to achieve a peace
ful settlement of the Polish-German
troubles.
British diplomats were convinced
Mussolini must have obtained some
reward or promise of reward from
Hitler to enter into an alliance com
mitting him, supposedly, to support
Nazi military ventures under certain
conditions.
These diplomats said because of
Hitler's position Poland has not yet
provided Germany with any basis
for negotiating the Polish dispute,
the possibility of intervention by
Mussolini as mediator appeared lost.
It also was doubtful whether Poland
would accept a "neutral mediator"
who has an arms pact with Hitler.
THWART BRITAIN, FRANCE
It was indicated Mussolini, who
had been wary of entering into an
armed alliance with Hitler for fear
of being drawn into war over Dan
zig or some other issue for which the
Italian people would have no en
thusiasm, finally had agreed to the
necessity of militarily bolstering the
Rome-Berlin axis as a means of
thwarting the Anglo-French peace
front.
The groundwork lor converting
the Rome-Berlin axis—an unwritten
working agreement followed by for
mal cultural accords between Italy
and Germany — was laid several
weeks ago when the chiefs of the
German and Italian general staffs
met at Innsbruck in the Austrian
Tyrol.
Agreement on the Italo-German
military alliance increased specula
tion that Hitler would put new vigor
into his reported efforts to convert
the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo pact against
Communism into an out-and-out
military alliance.
STRENGTHEN FORCES
If he should be successful in this
attempt, Germany's fighting strength
then would be augmented by pacts
with the armed forces of Japan,
Hungary and Spain as well as with
Italy.
Japan in recent weeks has been
under heavy Nazi pressure seeking
Tokyo's consent to a direct military
alliance. The Japanese have weighed
the benefits of such an alliance
against friendship with other powers
—particularly Britain—in the Far
East, however, and were reported on
April 27 to have rejected the sug
gestion of an arms alliance.
