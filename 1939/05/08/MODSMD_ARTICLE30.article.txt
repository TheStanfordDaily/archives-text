# GIVE FOR GIVING'S SAKE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I do not hate little children.
I do not hate sincere charity.
But I do hate to see my fellow
students face a crisis. And wc are
lace to face with our annual spring
crisis. If you don't believe it dig
last Monday's Daily out of the waste
paper basket and look at the pitiful
editorial. Please make our work
easy for a week, whines the writer.
Goodness yes, it will require at least
a week of unremitted effort to pry
$2 per capita from the impoverished
Stanford community.
And to look at the front page is to
see the deeds of the Stanford co-eds
organizing into long lists of com
mittees again. If. my ruler is accu
rate the Brunch Committee is six
inches of column space.
Who are the hedonists among you
who think that business and pleas
ure go together? Who of you thinks
that an act of charity should be
committed in the easiest manner
possible? Well, if you don't believe
it you certainly are doing it. We
would not have tag day unless it
flattered our egoes to buy tags from
the prettier of the co-eds.
I am not recommending support
be withdrawn. Nothing of the sort.
I would like to see some of the
homelier virtues of charity return.
To give without being solicited by a
pretty smile, to work without being
recognized by the Dippy. Come, we
can rise to face the crisis.
But let us forget the pleasant
means and making fools of ourselves
and go to work not Tor our sakes
but for those of the little kiddies.
