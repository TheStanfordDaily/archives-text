# Clubs Plan to Hold Hidden Villa Picnic
## 
### 
The Roger Williams Club and the
Wesley Foundation will hold a pic
nic and joint meeting at Hidden
Villa, May 21, leaving here at A
o'clock Sunday afternoon.
After the planned recreation and
supper, an "around the fire" wor
ship service will be held. The picnic
will take the place of the regular

meetings.
Wage rates in Belgium have been
"frozen" recently, and employers
want the government to reduce
them.
