# Students Will Visit Mines In Geology Summer Course
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
It looks like a glorified summer vacation. It sounds swell, three
months in the open, tramping through southern California coastal ranges,
exjdoring mining camps in western Nevada.
Ft will be. But it will mean hard work, too.
It is the Stanford summer course in field geology. Nearing its third

► decade ol' existence, the field trips
I mean six days a week of ground
work for geology majors for three
! months, plus 15 units required for
j graduation.
; TRADITIONAL TRIP
A traditional trip for Farm geol
! ogists, the off-quarter course was
i originated nearly 30 years ago by
i Dr. J. C. Branner, second president
!of Stanford University. Since Dr.
' Branner's time they have been car
j l ied on under the watchful eye of
j Director 'C. F. Tolman, affection
; ately known as "Chief" to 27 suc
! ceeding classes of Farm students.
With shank's mare carrying them
i over an area including the Mt. Pinos
I quadrangle and a section of Nevada,
! bronzed geology students this year
will follow Dr. Dwight M. Lem
mon, field course director for the
first time.
For the students, the trip com
bines actual experience in the field
while working in pairs over desig
nated areas, plus preparation of in
dividual geologic reports at the end
of the nine-week period.
PROFESSORS LEARN
For the staff it means putting the
ories to practice, and an opportu
nity to know their students better.
Approximately 24 students and 4
instructors are expected. Minimum
requirements limit the class mainly
to seniors. Four non-Stanford men
have already signed the roster, one
from Washington, one from Texas,
and two from Fresno State.
Individual cost, in • addition to
personal equipment, includes tui
tion, syllabus and medical fees, and
board at camp and transportation in
the field.
During 1933-38 the United States
regained nearly half of the Latin
American export trade it lost be
tween 1929 and 1932.
