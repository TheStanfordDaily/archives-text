# Troy Puts Over Expected 81-50 Track Defeat
## Cards Take Annual Beating Despite Efforts by Jeffrey, Girard, Zager; Two-mile, Javelin Records Fall 
### CHUCK SMITH 
It's becoming an annual affair, (his heating administered hy the mighty
Trojan track team to Dink Templeton's cindermen.
Saturday it was 81-50, but the familiarity that appears from year to
year is not in the margin of defeat hut in the way hopes for a Cardinal
victory slowly disappear before the rush of U.S.C.'s greatness.
Before every meet with Troy's aces, Stanford can always be given
a chance by the experts of turning back the invaders, and Templeton and
his crew cling preciously to the conviction that an upset here, a spare
point there will eventually lead to success

Bui every year those hopes grad
ually disappear into thin air as
those supermen from the South go
to work. History repeated itself this
year.
Two meet records were broken
during the course of the meet.
Marston "Mushy" Girard, Indian
distance ace, ran the two-mile grind
in 9:39.4 to break the old mark of
9:41 set by Winn of U.S.C. in 1934.
Bob Peoples, current holder of the
nalive American record in the jave
lin, heaved the spear 228 feet, 1%
inches, to eclipse Johnny Mottram's
previous best of 218 feet, 1%, estab
lished in 1935.
The Indians could have won if Sid
Hayes, Russ Wulff, and Ray Brown
had been in condition to do their
best, il Dick Carew had been able
to match strides with those Hying
Trojan sprinters, if Paul Moore had
cut in for a shade of points in the
distances, and for a while it looked
as though these and other surprise
performances were going to bring
the Cards a win.
There was a brief moment when
things had Troy's Coach Dean
Cromwell definitely worried. It
was just before the running of the
100-yard dash. Mush Girard and
Craig Williamson had done what
was expected of them in the mile
and 440, but had scared the very
dickens out of Trojans Zamperini,
Miller, and Upton.
It was just after a comparative

unknown, Norm Christenson, had taken the lead in the broad jump with
a leap of 23 ft. 2 in., nine full inches better than his previous record. Allen
Grey had just hoisted himself into third place in the shot with a come
through flip of over 50 feet. And Jim Lincoln had gone over the bar at
G ft. 4 in. in the high jump on his first attempt in his duel with Trojan
Mallery.
CAREW FAILS TO CATCH ANDERSON AND JORDAN
Then the highly touted but disappointing Willis of S.C. was disqualified
lor jumping the gun twice in the century dash. But the tide turned.
Little Dick Carew couldn t quite catch those flying Trojans Anderson and
Jordan. Big Bill Hawkins wasn't able to match strides in the final sprint
ol the high hurdles with the supposedly injured Humphreys, but Dick
Simpson came home with a surprise third.
Then came that real heartbreaker, that one-two by Troy in the 880.
Runing a cagey race, Zamperini attracted all the attention, but it was
his Teammate Reading who romped home, with Zamp's assistance and
permission, however, in 1:54.7, which was by far his best-ever perform
ance.
A maroon sweep in the javelin aided by a come through toss of 213
feet by a supposed has-been, Reed Trusel, Mallery's continuing on to
win in the high jump, all added to the growing U.S.C. total.
IiROWN FOLDS UP. FAILS IN BROAD JUMP
Meanwhile. Ray Brown, counted on for a win in the broad jump, had
his leg buckle under him, and two Trojans. Laret and Broomfield, moved
ahead of Christenson to guarantee the visitors eight points.
Clyde Jeffrey took his second sprint victory of the afternoon in the
furlong and again two of Troy's flyers were right after him. The two
mile helped things by giving the Indians an expected first by Girard
and ;> second by John Emanuel. Vickery was untouchable in the lows
but Stan Hiserman took a strong second and "Hawk" sneaked in for
third.
After keeping the fans breathless through the trials of the discus
throw with a series of fouls and poor tosses, Pete Zagar finally tossed one
161 feet to take over his deserved position in front.
Though they did (> inches lower thfin usual, the Troy vaulters, Day
and Howe, took one-two in the pole vault, ahead of Bob Kenyon.
The relay was perhaps the most thrilling race of the day. With the
lead changing half a dozen times, the Trojans, by virtue of two poor
passes by the Cards and a burning 4G.8 anchor lap by Miller, finally nosed
out Templeton's quartet in the near record time of 3:14.7.

feet by a supposed has-been, Reed Trusel, Mallery's continuing on to
win in the high jump, all added to the growing U.S.C. total.
IiROWN FOLDS UP. FAILS IN BROAD JUMP
Meanwhile. Ray Brown, counted on for a win in the broad jump, had
his leg buckle under him, and two Trojans. Laret and Broomfield, moved
ahead of Christenson to guarantee the visitors eight points.
Clyde Jeffrey took his second sprint victory of the afternoon in the
furlong and again two of Troy's flyers were right after him. The two
mile helped things by giving the Indians an expected first by Girard
and ;> second by John Emanuel. Vickery was untouchable in the lows
but Stan Hiserman took a strong second and "Hawk" sneaked in for
third.
After keeping the fans breathless through the trials of the discus
throw with a series of fouls and poor tosses, Pete Zagar finally tossed one
161 feet to take over his deserved position in front.
Though they did (> inches lower thfin usual, the Troy vaulters, Day
and Howe, took one-two in the pole vault, ahead of Bob Kenyon.
The relay was perhaps the most thrilling race of the day. With the
lead changing half a dozen times, the Trojans, by virtue of two poor
passes by the Cards and a burning 4G.8 anchor lap by Miller, finally nosed
out Templeton's quartet in the near record time of 3:14.7.


CLYDE JEFFREY
It's becoming an annual affair, (his heating administered hy the mighty
Trojan track team to Dink Templeton's cindermen.
Saturday it was 81-50, but the familiarity that appears from year to
year is not in the margin of defeat hut in the way hopes for a Cardinal
victory slowly disappear before the rush of U.S.C.'s greatness.
Before every meet with Troy's aces, Stanford can always be given
a chance by the experts of turning back the invaders, and Templeton and
his crew cling preciously to the conviction that an upset here, a spare
point there will eventually lead to success

Bui every year those hopes grad
ually disappear into thin air as
those supermen from the South go
to work. History repeated itself this
year.
Two meet records were broken
during the course of the meet.
Marston "Mushy" Girard, Indian
distance ace, ran the two-mile grind
in 9:39.4 to break the old mark of
9:41 set by Winn of U.S.C. in 1934.
Bob Peoples, current holder of the
nalive American record in the jave
lin, heaved the spear 228 feet, 1%
inches, to eclipse Johnny Mottram's
previous best of 218 feet, 1%, estab
lished in 1935.
The Indians could have won if Sid
Hayes, Russ Wulff, and Ray Brown
had been in condition to do their
best, il Dick Carew had been able
to match strides with those Hying
Trojan sprinters, if Paul Moore had
cut in for a shade of points in the
distances, and for a while it looked
as though these and other surprise
performances were going to bring
the Cards a win.
There was a brief moment when
things had Troy's Coach Dean
Cromwell definitely worried. It
was just before the running of the
100-yard dash. Mush Girard and
Craig Williamson had done what
was expected of them in the mile
and 440, but had scared the very
dickens out of Trojans Zamperini,
Miller, and Upton.
It was just after a comparative

unknown, Norm Christenson, had taken the lead in the broad jump with
a leap of 23 ft. 2 in., nine full inches better than his previous record. Allen
Grey had just hoisted himself into third place in the shot with a come
through flip of over 50 feet. And Jim Lincoln had gone over the bar at
G ft. 4 in. in the high jump on his first attempt in his duel with Trojan
Mallery.
CAREW FAILS TO CATCH ANDERSON AND JORDAN
Then the highly touted but disappointing Willis of S.C. was disqualified
lor jumping the gun twice in the century dash. But the tide turned.
Little Dick Carew couldn t quite catch those flying Trojans Anderson and
Jordan. Big Bill Hawkins wasn't able to match strides in the final sprint
ol the high hurdles with the supposedly injured Humphreys, but Dick
Simpson came home with a surprise third.
Then came that real heartbreaker, that one-two by Troy in the 880.
Runing a cagey race, Zamperini attracted all the attention, but it was
his Teammate Reading who romped home, with Zamp's assistance and
permission, however, in 1:54.7, which was by far his best-ever perform
ance.

It was just after a comparative

unknown, Norm Christenson, had taken the lead in the broad jump with
a leap of 23 ft. 2 in., nine full inches better than his previous record. Allen
Grey had just hoisted himself into third place in the shot with a come
through flip of over 50 feet. And Jim Lincoln had gone over the bar at
G ft. 4 in. in the high jump on his first attempt in his duel with Trojan
Mallery.
CAREW FAILS TO CATCH ANDERSON AND JORDAN
Then the highly touted but disappointing Willis of S.C. was disqualified
lor jumping the gun twice in the century dash. But the tide turned.
Little Dick Carew couldn t quite catch those flying Trojans Anderson and
Jordan. Big Bill Hawkins wasn't able to match strides in the final sprint
ol the high hurdles with the supposedly injured Humphreys, but Dick
Simpson came home with a surprise third.
Then came that real heartbreaker, that one-two by Troy in the 880.
Runing a cagey race, Zamperini attracted all the attention, but it was
his Teammate Reading who romped home, with Zamp's assistance and
permission, however, in 1:54.7, which was by far his best-ever perform
ance.
A maroon sweep in the javelin aided by a come through toss of 213
feet by a supposed has-been, Reed Trusel, Mallery's continuing on to
win in the high jump, all added to the growing U.S.C. total.
IiROWN FOLDS UP. FAILS IN BROAD JUMP
Meanwhile. Ray Brown, counted on for a win in the broad jump, had
his leg buckle under him, and two Trojans. Laret and Broomfield, moved
ahead of Christenson to guarantee the visitors eight points.
Clyde Jeffrey took his second sprint victory of the afternoon in the
furlong and again two of Troy's flyers were right after him. The two
mile helped things by giving the Indians an expected first by Girard
and ;> second by John Emanuel. Vickery was untouchable in the lows
but Stan Hiserman took a strong second and "Hawk" sneaked in for
third.
After keeping the fans breathless through the trials of the discus
throw with a series of fouls and poor tosses, Pete Zagar finally tossed one
161 feet to take over his deserved position in front.
Though they did (> inches lower thfin usual, the Troy vaulters, Day
and Howe, took one-two in the pole vault, ahead of Bob Kenyon.
The relay was perhaps the most thrilling race of the day. With the
lead changing half a dozen times, the Trojans, by virtue of two poor
passes by the Cards and a burning 4G.8 anchor lap by Miller, finally nosed
out Templeton's quartet in the near record time of 3:14.7.


CLYDE JEFFREY
It's becoming an annual affair, (his heating administered hy the mighty
Trojan track team to Dink Templeton's cindermen.
Saturday it was 81-50, but the familiarity that appears from year to
year is not in the margin of defeat hut in the way hopes for a Cardinal
victory slowly disappear before the rush of U.S.C.'s greatness.
Before every meet with Troy's aces, Stanford can always be given
a chance by the experts of turning back the invaders, and Templeton and
his crew cling preciously to the conviction that an upset here, a spare
point there will eventually lead to success

Bui every year those hopes grad
ually disappear into thin air as
those supermen from the South go
to work. History repeated itself this
year.
Two meet records were broken
during the course of the meet.
Marston "Mushy" Girard, Indian
distance ace, ran the two-mile grind
in 9:39.4 to break the old mark of
9:41 set by Winn of U.S.C. in 1934.
Bob Peoples, current holder of the
nalive American record in the jave
lin, heaved the spear 228 feet, 1%
inches, to eclipse Johnny Mottram's
previous best of 218 feet, 1%, estab
lished in 1935.
The Indians could have won if Sid
Hayes, Russ Wulff, and Ray Brown
had been in condition to do their
best, il Dick Carew had been able
to match strides with those Hying
Trojan sprinters, if Paul Moore had
cut in for a shade of points in the
distances, and for a while it looked
as though these and other surprise
performances were going to bring
the Cards a win.
There was a brief moment when
things had Troy's Coach Dean
Cromwell definitely worried. It
was just before the running of the
100-yard dash. Mush Girard and
Craig Williamson had done what
was expected of them in the mile
and 440, but had scared the very
dickens out of Trojans Zamperini,
Miller, and Upton.
