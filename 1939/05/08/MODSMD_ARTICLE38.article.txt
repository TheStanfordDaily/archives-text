# Cincinnati Reds Smear Phillies, 13-4
## Dodgers, Giants, Other National League Winners 
### 
NEW YORK, May 7 (UP).—The
Cincinnati Reds put on their biggest
scoring spree of the season today as
they walloped the Philadelphia
Phillies, 13-4, and increased their
National League lead to a full game.
Led by Harry Craft and Frank
McCormick, who each hit homers,
the Reds scored 11 runs in three
innings and drove Hugh Mulcahy
and Al Hollingsworth from the
mound. Jim Henry finished up.
Paul Derringer went the route
and hung up his third victory of the
season for the Reds.
RECORD CROWD
Brooklyn's largest crowd of the
season —2(5,318 —watched the Dodgers
take over sole possession of second
place with a 2-1 win over the St.
Louis Cardinals. Pinch-hitter Babe
Phelps hammered over both Dodger
runs in the fourth on a single to
right with loaded bases.
Vito Tamulis, ex-Yankee pitcher,
went the route for his first win of
the year, giving up six hits. Bob
Bowman and Lon Warneke allowed
the Dodgers only four.
PIRATES TAKE BEES
The Pittsburgh Pirates, gradually
coming out of their last-place nose
dive, crushed the Boston Bees, 0-2,
to move within a half-game of the
7th place Chicago Cubs.
Bob Klinger and Bill Posedel
staged a tight pitching duel until
the sixth, with the Bees ahead, 1-0,
the Pirates came to bat in the sixth
and rang up three runs on four hits
to seal the verdict. The loss toppled
the Bees into third.
With Mel Ott setting the pace the
New York Giants hammered out 16
hits off Clay Bryant to whip the
Chicago Cubs, 10-3, and move into
a fourth place deadlock with the
Cards.
Cliff Melton, loser of his first two
starts, held the Cubs to six hits,
one a homer by Gabby Hartnett.
In the American League, the New
York Yankees came to life and re
gained first place with a top-heavy,
15-4 victory over the Chicago White
Sox. It was a typical Yankee vic
tory, seven of their 19 hits going for
extra bases. Joe Gordon hit two
homers and Red Rolfe, one. Red
Ruffing went the distance and pitch
ed nine-hit ball for his fourth vic
tory of the year.
