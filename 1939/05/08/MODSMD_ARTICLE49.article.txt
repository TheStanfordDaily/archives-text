ADOLF looked at Benito; Benito looked at
Adolf.
Sort of warily they looked at each other.
"Okay, it's a deal." In chorus.
Short, fat little Benny sat back, stuck his chin
out; slight little Adolf snarled.
Down inside, they didn't trust each other,
they didn't quite know what was coming up,
but they knew perfectly well they were like
the three little fishies—and they swam, and
they swam, all over the dam.
Yesterday, they looked at each other again.
"Okay, it's a big deal."
Benny stuck his chin out; Adolf snarled.
Outside —bitter chill it was.
Through the frosty windowpanes two or three
figures eyed the fire inside wistfully. Every
once in a while they would look at each other
wistfully.
In fact, the whole thing was wistful.
Clustered around the fireside was a small
group of forlorn-looking waifs. Half-terrorized,
completely pitiful, they were nevertheless glad
of the warm fire. They had been orphans—
they were back in the asylum now, though.
All of a sudden, little Adolf broke into song.
Benito smiled facetiously.
"It ain't what ya do,
Hit's the way hut ya do it . . ."
Old John —outside and cold—grimaced; La
Belle shivered, she'd had her crack at the boys
inside but while she had been riding high she'd
sold herself too completely to Old John. And
it looked as though he might be a little too old.
But, anyway, they still had one little orphan
left with them—by the hand, sort of under their
care.
They knew well they wouldn't have him
long, however, if they didn't do something.
Maybe gang up with slinky Vladimir. But
Vladimir was too busy also looking in the win
dow on his own hook. Besides, he wanted to
run things his own way.
Sammy, across the street, was too busy cut
ting another chaw off his plug to be bothered.
What the hell, anyway—"l'll be safe and you'll
be sorry, when the wolf comes to your door."
He'd been pretty smug now for some time.
They'd tried to get him to knock on the door
with them. To help them regain what they'd
lost. He'd forgotten that they were his best
customers, evidently.
But what could they do about it?
They needed the stuff he could sell them.
They knew, too, that he'd need their trade the
next time he tried to pull something. They
weren't exactly in any position to say anything
at this point, though.
So, the end of this little story finds Sammy
still settin' and chewin'. The brown juice has
drooled down in little streams on his grey
beard.
But there he sets.
