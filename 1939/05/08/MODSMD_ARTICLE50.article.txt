# One Easy Way Out

ONE out of every three Stanford students
drives his own car.
Each year since the darkest days of the De
pression has seen a rising number of auto
mobiles on the Farm. And with this increase
has come a multiplication of traffic tags and fines
far out of line with the guota of cars per capita.
During the academic year 1936-37, 96 tickets
were issued for speeding and 375 for parking
violations, netting 5759.50 in fines. Figures took
a sharp rise in 1937-38 when Gordy Davis and
George Burns found themselves obliged to hand
out 135 speeding and 469 parking tags, and
Men's and Women's Councils collected $989.50
in tribute.
Fall and winter guarters of this year, a de
pression in the accident market appeared to
be imminent. The machinery for enforcement
of Stanford traffic laws was ready to go into
low gear. Then came the spring.
So far this guarter there have been more
accidents than in fall and winter combined. Un
doubtedly the weather is conducive to crowded
roads, to picnics and beach parties, to moon
light rides and one-arm driving. But no amount
of romance is great enough to bear the blame
for skyrocketing statistics of traffic violations.
Figures for the year have not been computed
as yet, but unless there is a sudden drop within
the next few weeks, 1938 -39 undoubtedly will
have a blacker record than its predecessors.
Popularly accepted is the belief that college

drivers are more reckless than others. Scientific
tests have proved them more skillful. Regard
less of these facts, Stanford students realize that
their speed is far above average and that they
take too many chances.
Today the driver who considers it smart to
be careless is limited chiefly to the high school
and cow-college fields. At Stanford fast driving
is mainly a matter of habit. Few are the men
who keep the throttle down in order to show
off; fewer, the number who actually have to
get someplace in a hurry.
Life on the Farm runs slowly. The maximum
speeds allowed by law are high enough to meet
the requirements of all but a few on-every-com
mitteemen and every-night-a-daters.
A minimum amount of thought and consider
ation would result in complete banishment of
campus accidents. Here in the seclusion of
9,000 acres, Stanford should be able to immu
nize itself against the standard American dis
ease—speed. Living a little slower and a little
longer really is worth while.—L. L.

is mainly a matter of habit. Few are the men
who keep the throttle down in order to show
off; fewer, the number who actually have to
get someplace in a hurry.
Life on the Farm runs slowly. The maximum
speeds allowed by law are high enough to meet
the requirements of all but a few on-every-com
mitteemen and every-night-a-daters.
A minimum amount of thought and consider
ation would result in complete banishment of
campus accidents. Here in the seclusion of
9,000 acres, Stanford should be able to immu
nize itself against the standard American dis
ease—speed. Living a little slower and a little
longer really is worth while.—L. L.
ONE out of every three Stanford students
drives his own car.
Each year since the darkest days of the De
pression has seen a rising number of auto
mobiles on the Farm. And with this increase
has come a multiplication of traffic tags and fines
far out of line with the guota of cars per capita.
During the academic year 1936-37, 96 tickets
were issued for speeding and 375 for parking
violations, netting 5759.50 in fines. Figures took
a sharp rise in 1937-38 when Gordy Davis and
George Burns found themselves obliged to hand
out 135 speeding and 469 parking tags, and
Men's and Women's Councils collected $989.50
in tribute.
Fall and winter guarters of this year, a de
pression in the accident market appeared to
be imminent. The machinery for enforcement
of Stanford traffic laws was ready to go into
low gear. Then came the spring.
So far this guarter there have been more
accidents than in fall and winter combined. Un
doubtedly the weather is conducive to crowded
roads, to picnics and beach parties, to moon
light rides and one-arm driving. But no amount
of romance is great enough to bear the blame
for skyrocketing statistics of traffic violations.
Figures for the year have not been computed
as yet, but unless there is a sudden drop within
the next few weeks, 1938 -39 undoubtedly will
have a blacker record than its predecessors.
Popularly accepted is the belief that college

drivers are more reckless than others. Scientific
tests have proved them more skillful. Regard
less of these facts, Stanford students realize that
their speed is far above average and that they
take too many chances.
Today the driver who considers it smart to
be careless is limited chiefly to the high school
and cow-college fields. At Stanford fast driving
is mainly a matter of habit. Few are the men
who keep the throttle down in order to show
off; fewer, the number who actually have to
get someplace in a hurry.
