/ORDINARILY Stanford students don't think that the
University is either extravagant or careless in
eases where money is involved. After years of making
checks payable, most of us have concluded that even
the statues on the Quad have to pay rent for their
niches. This may be true for collections; but over the
week-end, I found some figures on University ex
penses, and as far as I can sec, Stanford is living beyond
its means.
It is pretty well agreed that the University was
founded to educate its students, not to build buildings,
and not to make a reputation. It is also agreed that
the quality of an education varies directly with the
money spent on it. It would seem reasonable, then, to
conclude that the more the University spends on the
instruction of each student, the better it fulfills its
purpose.
* * * *
But in the past few years, Stanford has made teach
ing play accompaniment while construction did the
solo. We have acquired a theater, an education build
ing, and an amphitheater; engineers are now scouting
the ground for a library tower. During that, time, our
endowment has remained constant, even shrinking a
little on paper. And until this year, faculty salaries
were cut 10 per cent; now they are cut only 5 per cent.
The buildings were given to us, and on first thought
it looked as though we couldn't lose by taking them.
But now that we have the buildings we have to pay
maintenance on them. With our budget already trim
med until it is practically a financial strip-tease, we
cannot afford maintenance.

r FHE COMPTROLLER has estimated that upkeep on
Memorial Hall and the Cubberlcy Building alone
amount to $14,000. Janitor service has increased in cost
by $4,000, lighting expense by $3,000. all in one year.
That $14,000 would pay the salaries of two of our
best professors, without cut, and would leave some
thing over for patching those collections of chuck
holes we call roads.

Enrollment has increased steadily throughout the
history of the University, excejst in the depression
years; now it is the largest in history. To correspond
to this there has been a deceptive increase in faculty;
but many of the new men added have been instructors
and assistants, not professors. Instead of experts, wc
have students teaching students.
And yet we keep on putting up new buildings. They
are very nice buildings', of course; but it was the best
brand of butter that ruined the White Rabbit's watch.
We might be a little less comfortable with a smaller
plant, and we wouldn't impress visitors as much. But
we could offer better instruction and laboratory facili
ties. Students want an education they can use later
on; they can't take buildings with them.

by $4,000, lighting expense by $3,000. all in one year.

Enrollment has increased steadily throughout the
history of the University, excejst in the depression
years; now it is the largest in history. To correspond
to this there has been a deceptive increase in faculty;
but many of the new men added have been instructors
and assistants, not professors. Instead of experts, wc
have students teaching students.
And yet we keep on putting up new buildings. They
are very nice buildings', of course; but it was the best
brand of butter that ruined the White Rabbit's watch.
We might be a little less comfortable with a smaller
plant, and we wouldn't impress visitors as much. But
we could offer better instruction and laboratory facili
ties. Students want an education they can use later
on; they can't take buildings with them.

/ORDINARILY Stanford students don't think that the
University is either extravagant or careless in
eases where money is involved. After years of making
checks payable, most of us have concluded that even
the statues on the Quad have to pay rent for their
niches. This may be true for collections; but over the
week-end, I found some figures on University ex
penses, and as far as I can sec, Stanford is living beyond
its means.
It is pretty well agreed that the University was
founded to educate its students, not to build buildings,
and not to make a reputation. It is also agreed that
the quality of an education varies directly with the
money spent on it. It would seem reasonable, then, to
conclude that the more the University spends on the
instruction of each student, the better it fulfills its
purpose.

But in the past few years, Stanford has made teach
ing play accompaniment while construction did the
solo. We have acquired a theater, an education build
ing, and an amphitheater; engineers are now scouting
the ground for a library tower. During that, time, our
endowment has remained constant, even shrinking a
little on paper. And until this year, faculty salaries
were cut 10 per cent; now they are cut only 5 per cent.
The buildings were given to us, and on first thought
it looked as though we couldn't lose by taking them.
