CATCHING
A Mariposa girl called the other night to say that
many girls in that cottage have poison oak.
They were out on a picnic the other day, and the
D.U.'s were having a picnic, fraternity style, nearby;
and, well, the picnics tended to merge.
The D.U.'s, the girls found, had poison oak.
And a little later on, they found that they too had
poison oak. Particularly the one girl who knew the
most D.U.'s.

BARN DANCE BETAS
Several graduate Betas were at the Barn Dance
Saturday night, and they had a couple of rooms at
the Palace.
There came that time in the early morning when
they decided they wanted to get the hell out. Boom.
In keeping with their mood, they saw a cop outside
as they left their room, and they asked him in.
They told him that a friend of theirs had just
passed out in the closet, and would he help them get
him out.
Sure, the cop said.
So they opened the closet door, the cop stepped in.
and they locked the door and beat it.
I suppose the cop is out of the closet by now. Out
or dead.

MASQUE BALL
A man dressed as a woman took a woman dressed
as a man to the Masque Ball. Thr costumes and make
up of both were good. The man, they say, looked
rather like a Ivpical Stanford woman, and the woman
looked quite like a Stanford rough who needed a
shave.
They also say that at one point during the evening
the man in woman's clothing shocked and embar
rassed a group of men at the dance.
