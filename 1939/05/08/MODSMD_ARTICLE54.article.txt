"Three Smart Girls Grow Up," cur
rently playing at the Fox Stanford
Deanna Durbin can sing. This is a
fact that none will dispute. But in
this picture, an attempt to continue

"Thumbs Down"

the inree amort
Girls" series, De
anna sings very
little, spends most
of her time being
not very "smart."
Based on a se
} ries of misunder
standings that
are nothing if not
inane, the' story
bounds along jer
kily, treats the

audience to a rough time before
things are finally unraveled. The
trick reverse wedding that has been
one of Hollywood's stocks-in-trade
is tugged in by the heels to solve a
multitude of troubles.
This is an unhappy family. I've
seldom seen an unhappier family.
Father is a big broker who makes
deals in eight-digit totals, screams
across the ocean to London, but has
no time to devote to his wife and
children. The typical burlesqued
Capitalist, he has that well-known
gold-plated heart, we find in the
last scene. Charles Winninger, old
trouper that he is, "mugs" the part
as well as could be expected.
The three smart girls, who are
supposedly growing up, behave in
varying manners. Nan Grey and
Helen Parish are both in love with
the same man—or so they fancy.
Deanna stumbles along until she
finally gets things fixed up so that
everyone's happy.
There are a couple of touching
scenes, lots of nocturnal prowling,
diaries and tears, and long stair
cases that Deanna is now becoming
adept at climbing. Recording and
photography are good; script is in
effectual.
In a few places the whole thing is
almost, but not quite, entertaining.—
