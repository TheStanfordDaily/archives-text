UP TO YESTERDAY, the Rome-Berlin Axis was, supposedly, merely
a "working agreement, with cultural connections" between Adolf
Ilitler and Benito Mussolini. And yesterday, effectively stymieing any
present chance Britain and France may have to woo 11 Duce away
from his northern partner and make peace at least a wee bit definite,
the two dictatorships converted their axis into a military pact, en
gineered by der Fuehrer.
