## 
### JOHN ZBIKOWSKI 
Stanford freshmen study in? the history of Western civilization arc be
ing helped in their work on the World War this month by an exhibit of
wartime books, letters, and propaganda pamphlets displayed in the lobby
of the Stanford library.
Arranged from the archives of the Iloover Library on War, Revolution
and Peace by Miss Nina Almond and Philip McLean, the exhibit gives

glimpses of British, German, Ameri-<
can propaganda; of occupied Bel
gium's successful struggle to pub
lish a saucy anti-German newspa
per; of shipping records from the
complete archives of the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium, and—to
add a modern touch — German,
French, and English editioifs of
Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf."
The suave, plausible British prop
aganda directed at America consists
of neat, modest pamphlets bearing
such titles as "Is England Apa
thetic?" and "The Navy and the
War." Sir Gilbert Parker was the
British propagandist in America,
and it is of note that he first laid
his groundwork by sounding out
American college and university
opinion toward the allied cause,
then prepared his tracts to meet and
guide such opinion. These, the
library discloses, were mailed by the
thousands to Americans carefully
chosen from "Who's Who."
In contrast, the German propa
ganda book which had a wide cir
culation here, entitled "Who Are the
Huns?" was bristling in nature. At
tempt was made in this book to
show that Germans were fighting for
the same cause in 1914 that Ameri
cans fought for in 1776.
American propaganda, the library
reveals, consisted in part of the so
called Red, White and Blue series
of pamphlets, edited by George
Creel, which had the staggering
total circulation of 61,000,000 copies.
