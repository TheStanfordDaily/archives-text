### 
PARIS, May 7 (UP). â€” Duke of
Windsor's decision to broadcast a
peace message to the United States
tomorrow from Verdun battlefield
aroused assertions tonight in London
court circles that "it looks as if he
is beginning ot act up as soon as the
king is out of the country."
Friends of the Duke asserted,
however, he actually had hesitated
to accept the invitation for his first
radio stalk since his abdication fare
well on Dec. 11, 1936, because it co
incided with the departure of King
George VI and Queen Elizabeth on
their visit to Canada and the United
States.
