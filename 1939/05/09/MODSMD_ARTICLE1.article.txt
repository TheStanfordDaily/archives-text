### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
IJE IS A MAN we have heard
little of since jallopies were
running around the campus with
signs boosting "Simpson for queen."
Most of us remember him best as
the fellow who spoke to us over the
radio, intimately and with simple
dignity, to tell why he was giving
up the throne of England for the
woman he loved.
Yesterday for the first time since
the beginning of his voluntary exile,
Edward, Duke of Windsor, chose to
address his opinion to the listening
world. Against the supremely ap
propriate background of the battle
fields of Verdun, the ex-king plead
ed with the nations of Europe and
America to keep themselves clear
of war.
By his own word, Windsor
spoke "simply as a soldier of the
last war whose most earnest pray
er it is that such cruel and de
structive madness shall never
again overtake mankind." It is
highly probable that he wrote the
speech himself, but that it repre
sented other interests than his own
is almost as certain.
* * A*
| ONDON i.s a city as full of parties
J and interests and lobbies as our
own national capital. Among these
is one, as yet unnamed and undis
covered, which is receiving Ed
ward's support. Many believe that
it is the anti-Chamberlain group led
by Anthony Eden, and that yester
day's speech was designed to dis
credit the international policy of
the Prime Minister.
Also current is the report, that
during his exile the former monarch
has been converted to the fascist
cause and that he spoke to bolster
the European status quo with Hitler
and Mussolini on top of the pile.
Certain it is that his speech was far
more conciliatory to the axis than
an Eden-inspired address would
ever allow.
* # *
Windsor's words were banned in
Filmland by action of the govern
ment-controlled British Broad
casting Company, which may indi
cate that Chamberlain considered
them to be directed against his
policies. At all costs, they were
calculated to make a profound
impression on the United States
and the continental powers.
Few of us have forgotten his ab
dication speech; all of us in some
slight degree have been conscious of
his silence. When the Duke of Wind
sor expressed his personal views
yesterday, we listened far more care
fully than if they had been the dec
larations of a powerful government.
We cannot be certain of exactly
what they were.

| lANZIG is still the sorest spot in
Europe. Fearing that friction
between Poland and Germany may
force her to come to the aid of her
ally, England has ottered 1o mediate
in the dispute. Hitler is planning to
hold a plebiscite in the free city,
but it is obvious that with a 95 per
cent Gentian population, Danzig will
choose to rejoin the Reich.
Loss of the port would be the
coup de grace for Polish trade, and
therein lies Mr. Chamberlain's fear
that Warsaw will order out. the army
to maintain its rights. So that she
will not be obliged to fulfill her
pledge of aid to Poland, Britain has
offered to settle the controversy
peacefully and with no danger to
herself.

dictators or remaining on the unof

credit the international policy of
the Prime Minister.
Also current is the report, that

has been converted to the fascist
