# Peace Plea Broadcast By Windsor
## 'No One Wants War' Duke Says; Speech Boycotted in England 
### 
VERDUN, France, May 8 (UP). —
The Duke of Windsor, speaking
"simply as a soldier of the last war,"
breathed a fervent prayer for pcace
in a radio broadcast tonight to
America.
While his brother, King George
VI, was on the Atlantic en route
on a peace mission to Canada and
the United States, the Duke defied
unfavorable official reaction in Eng
land to his broadcast and voiced a
vigorous warning to the world
against the horrors of another war.
He indirectly appealed to the Ger
man people when he said there is
no land whose people want war and
added:
"This I believe to be as true of the
German nation as of the British na
tion to which I belong, and the
French nation on whose friendly soil
I am now living."
"It is in a spirit larger than per
sonal or purely national interests
that pcace must be pursued," he
said,"and asked for an end to propa
ganda which is "poisoning the minds
of the people of the world."
The British Broadcasting Com
pany, which controls radio programs
in England, decided to boycott the
speech.
Officials of the company, after a
hurried meeting, decided not to re
broadcast the speech, regarding it
as untimely, coming when the King
and Queen are on the Atlantic,
bound on their peace mission to
America.
Thousands of British listeners who
have short-wave sets probably were
able to pick up the speech, how
ever.
The Duke's speech was made after
a tour of the battlefields outside
Verdun, called Dead Men's Hill,
where not an inch of soil escaped
the terrible churning of three years
of constant shelling which cost
1,500,000 French, American, and
German casualties.
