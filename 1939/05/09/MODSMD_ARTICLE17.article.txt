# 'Dutch' Dates To Be Debated By Freshmen
## 
### 
Encina challenges Roblc! Chuck
Smith, Encina proxy, last night
sneaked into the Robleites' hang-out
at dinner time and delivered them
an ultimatum forcing them into an
acceptance of the Encina challenge
to debate the question, "Resolved:
that women should pay for dates on
a 50-50 basis."
Roble women agreed to accept the
challenge and to uphold the affirma
tive side of the question. Mary
Helen McCune, Roble spokeswoman,
tonight will run the gamut of the
Encina dining hall to formally ac
cept the challenge.
ALL ENCINA INVITED
However, the Robleites have not
only agreed to engage in a verbal
battle with Encina debatei's, but
they arc so sure of themselves that
they have invited all of Encina to
come over to the ivy-clad dorm to
hear them vanquish the confident
males. Incidentally they will per
sonally serve after-dinner coffce to
their guests of the evening.
The verbal splinters will start fly
ing in the Roble lobby at 7 o'clock
tomorrow evening with Marjorie
Williams, Margery Gunn and Helen
Severance taking the floor to try to
tell the fellows that they would like
to chip in on dates.
EXPERIENCED DEBATERS
Trying to uphold the pride of the
always staid, conservative, and proud
Eticinamen will be Roger Boas, Rob
ert Hammett, and Bob McNeil.
Just to make the situation a little
hotter, the contenders for the most
part are accomplished debaters. The
three Encina representatives have
each had two quarters experience on
Lee Chapin's frosh debate squad,
and for the women, Helen Sever
ance was three times Montana state
champion debater.
