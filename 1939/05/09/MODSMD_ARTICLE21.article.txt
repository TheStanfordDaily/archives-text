# Roy Howard To Lecture Here Tonight
## Newspaper Publisher To Speak on 'Your American Press' 
### 
Interviewer of kings and dicta
tors, friend of presidents and em
perors, Roy W. Howard, famed
American newspaperman and chair
man of the board of Scripps-Howard
newspapers, will deliver the tenth
annual Donald R. Mellctt Memorial
Lecture tonight at 7:30 o'clock in
Memorial Hall auditorium. He will
speak on "Your American Press."
Ruler of a vast journalistic em
pire, including 24 metropolitan
dailies in the United States, one
press association and three picture
and feature syndicates, the speaker
will be introduced by a Stanford
alumnus, William Scripps Kellogg,
president of the California Newspa
per Publishers' Association and pub
lisher of the Glendale News-Press.
MAKES EUROPEAN TOUR
Mr. Howard returned less than
three weeks ago from a three
month tour of the capitals of Eu
rope, during which he interviewed
foreign diplomats, businessmen, and
political leaders concerning the in
ternational situation on the conti
nent. While in England last month,
he secured an exclusive interview
with Lord Beaverbrook, British
publisher and press lord, who fore
sees "no war in Europe this year."
Visiting the key countries abroad,
the newspaperman wrote a series of
seven articles for the Scripps-How
ard papers, analyzing the maneu
vers of the dictatorships and democ
racies following Hitler's annexation
of the remnants of Czechoslovakia.
Mr. Howard then climaxed the se
ries with a short-wave radio broad
cast from Paris on a National
Broadcasting Company network.
In 1933, the millionaire globe
trotting publisher became the first
journalist to be received by Japan's
Emperor Hirohito following His
Majesty's ascension as the Son of
Heaven. With his exclusive inter
view with Russia's Josef Stalin in
1936, the newspaperman executed
another journalistic scoop, to the
embarrassment of regular Moscow
correspondents, who for months had
been trying in vain to secure an
audience with the dictator.
WAR-TIME INTERVIEW
During the World War, the 50-
year-old president, and editor of the
New York World-Telegram, then
Paris correspondent for United
Press, interviewed David Lloyd
George, Britain's war-time prime
minister, and Winston Churchill.
Probably best known for his part
in the now-famous "false Ann Is
tice" of Nov. 7, 1918, Mr. Howard !
sent the premature bulletin an- j
nouncing the end of the war which j
preceded by four full days the news I
of the real Armistice. When Rear
Admiral Henry B. Wilson received
at Brest a message over his private
wire from the American Embassy in
Paris, saying that hostilities would \
cease at 2 o'clock that afternoon,
the newspaperman sent a flash to
that effect to the New York head- ,
quarters of United Press,
Established in 1929 "to perpetuate ;
in the free press of America the
spirit of Don Mellett," the lecture is
given every year as a memorial to j
the late editor of the Canton (Ohio)

I News, assassinated in 1920 by ene
; mies made in his editorial campaign
j against civic corruption.
Mellett waged an eight months'
I war on organized vice and crime in
[ Canton, endeavoring "to show the
j people how the authority they have
delegated is being misused." On ,
July 16, 1926, he was ambushed and
shot to death by gangsters. Re- ,
wards totaling $27,000 were offered
| for information leading to the ar
| rest and conviction of the murder- I
ers, but they were never appre- !
| hended.
"This is one of the few speeches j
ever made by Mr. Howard, who has j
j probably done less public speaking j
than any other newspaper man of j
equal distinction," declares Dr. Chil- j
: ton R. Bush, chairman of the divi- ;
I sion of journalism. "His address at i
i Stanford he regards as a duty be
i cause of the obvious perils to which l
j human liberties are currently being j
exposed."
