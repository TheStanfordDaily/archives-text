While the cast was prancing
through initial rehearsals of "Wake
Up and Leave," Ram's Head Spring
; Show, Crew Manager Lloyd Henley
| last night issued the call for tech
nical assistants and stage crew
workers.
Under Chet Johnson and Johnny
i Paulson, head technicians, a con
i struction crew, which wiil build
sets for the show, a pin-rail boss,
make-up men and women, costume,
and prop girls are needed to round
out the large group who will pre
pare "Wake Up and Leave" for its
production on May 26 and 27.
j Henley emphasized the fact that
i workers were badly needed, and
i lhat while experience in construc
tion and other work was desirable,
it was not indispensable. Only can
; didates for pin-rail boss must have
, had experience.
"It is a come one, come all affair
for the rest of the crew," Henley
said. He also pointed out that work
on the stage crew would count
toward Ram's Head membership.
Those wishing to work on the
crew will meet Wednesday night in
ihe workshop of Memorial Hall from
7 to 8 o'clock, Henley announced.
On the financial end of the pro
duction, Dramatics Manager Hank
Ha user last night drew up seating
and price schedules for the two per
formances, and will release them
