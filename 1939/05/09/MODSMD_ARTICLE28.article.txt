HERRON MISSES ONE
The one record in the foregoing
table not held by Stanford, set by
.Johnson of Yale, was missed by
Herron by one-tenth of a second
when he swam a 2:13.1 race.
Without a doubt, Herron is, ac
cording to Pacific Coast swimming
experts, the best all-around swim
mer on the coast at the present time.
His 440 is truly remarkable. The
former record was 5:13.7 and Her
ron slashed it to 4:45.7, coming
within 5 seconds of the world rec
ord. It eclipses even the National
College Varsity record of 4:46.4. He
tore the backstroke record from
1:57.5 down to 1:37.9.
DUDLEY IN BREASTSTROKE
In the breaststroke, Scott Dudley
is by far the outstanding swimmer to
hit Stanford and, in the opinion
of some experts, he will within a
short time be the best on the Pa
cific Coast.
The rest of the squad is not to
be neglected. â€žThe medley team of
Herron, Dudley, and Gardner Miller
turned in a spectacular time of
2:58.4, better by 5 seconds than any
varsity or Pacific Coast Conference
record. The addition of Brad Young
to the above three formed the
record - breaking 400-yard relay
team.
ADAMS SHOULD WIN
Only because there is no record
given in diving, did the Cards miss
in this event. Howie Adams, dimin
utive frosh, would surely have gar
nered this title.
After reviewing the very success
ful season of the Stanford frosh
swimmers, culminating in this great
national recognition, it is agreed by
all concerned that the Stanford
freshman team of the 1939 season is
ihe greatest aggregation of swim
mers ever to hit the Farm at one
time.
