# Trackmen Await Decision Of Faculty Committee On Trip to IC4-A Meet
## Hiserman, Hawkins Present List Of Possible Entries to Wilbur For Scholastic Recommendation 
### 
President Kay Lyman Wilbur yesterday entered Stanford's current
athletic squabble, concerning the track team's "strike," when he conferred
with Captain Stan Hiscrman and hurdler Itill Hawkins.
Final solution to the matter rests with the Faculty Athletics Commit
tee. composed of five faculty men. three of whom are members of the

Board of Athletic Control. In all<
probability, Dr. Wilbur will investi
gate the scholastic records of the
trackmen who might make the trip,
and make a complete report to the
committee today.
Since entry blanks for the IC4-A
meet are due in New York by mid
night, Thursday, final action must be
taken immediately.
UNANIMOUS SILENCE
Although unanimously enthusias
tic Sunday night and yesterday
morning over plans to refuse to
compete in any of the remaining
meets on the Indian schedule as a
protest to the Board of Athletic Con
trol's action ruling out Stanford
participation in the IC4-A meet,
trackmen yesterday afternoon were
just as unanimously silent, refusing
to admit anything concerning the
strike.
However, the three spokesmen of
the uprising, Clyde Jeffrey, Pete Za
gar, and Bill Wohle, were asked:
"Will you compete in the Fresno
Relays Saturday if the BA.C. docs
not reverse its decision?" Their
answers:
Jeffrey: "I don't know; I suppose
so."
Zagar: "That remains to be seen."
Wohle: "I can't answer that ques
tion."
All three men ai'e almost certain
to be included on an IC4-A squad,
should the Board's ruling be re
versed by the Faculty Athletics
Committee, in whose hands final
action rests.
Under the committee's own rul
ing, any man who has a reasonable
chance of winning a first place in a
national meet is automatically eli
gible for the meet.
CONFER WITH WILBUR
Captain Stan Hiscrman and Bill
Hawkins, ace hurdler, yesterday
presented to Dr. Wilbur the facts of
the case, including a list of track
men who arc possibilities to take
the trip for the IC4-A meet May 27.
The list, according to reliable
sources, was drawn up by Coach
Dink Templcton, and includes nine
or ten names. Three of these —Jef-
frey, Zagar, and Wohle—apparently
arc eligible at present, with a fourth
a "probable" member of the IC4-A
squad. The rest of the group may
become eligible within the next
week, depending upon their showing
in pracice workouts.
Chief objection presented by board
members to the trip is its proximity
to finals. Those going East would
be gone two weeks, returning ten
days before the exams begin.
OWENS DISAPPROVES
William B. Owens, faculty repre
sentative on the Pacific Coast Con
ference, yesterday expressed dis
approval of the proposed Eastern
trip, it was reliably reported.
He said that such a trip would
give Stanford a bad name with
Eastern schools, because of the fact
that an athletic team would be sent
away in the middle of a quarter,
according to informed sources.
If the trackmen continue their
strike, it will mean that the team
would refuse to run in the Fresno
Relays Saturday; the NC2-A meet
in June in Los Angeles; the Pacific
Coast Conference meet in Seattle,
May 20; and the A.A.U. champion
ships this summer.
