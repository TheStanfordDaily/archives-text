# Robleites to Give Tyrolean Dance
## 
### 
Robleites will dance Saturday
niglU to the music of Jack Winston
in the Women's Gym at their quar
terly formal. Theme for the evening
will be Tyrolean, and this idea will
be carried out in the decorations and
refreshments.
Because all campus dances must
close at 12 o'clock on Saturday night,
it has been arranged for supper to
be served after the dance from 11:30
to 12:30 o'clock. These tables will be
set with checkered table-cloths and
candles.
