# Line Spots Catch Mentor's Eye
## 
### 
"Big Chief Tiny" Thornhill was J
keeping an eagle eye on several ,
positions as he sent his footballers j
through a spring training session on ;
the frosh field yesterday. The prac- ;
lice period was devoted to smoothing j
out plays for scrimmages slated
Wednesday and Thursday after- 1
noons.
Wth the first-string backfield po
sitions taken care of by the usual
quartet of Gene Coldiron, Pete Fay,
Jim Groves, and Norm Stand lee, the
main attention of the coaching staff
was centered on the uncertain line
positions, where several holes left
by graduated seniors must be filled.
Colin McClintock, from last fall's
freshman squad, seems to be just
what any doctor would order to re
place Tony Calvelli at center. Dave
Patterson, another ex-frosh star, has
been working at one of the first
string guard spots.
Steve Keusseff, who has had the
inside track on the other gui i d po
sition to date, was on the second
string yesterday, while Kerman took
his place in the first bunch.

Frankie Albert, working at the
halfback threat position on the sec
ond squad, still looks like the best
pitcher on the team. Most of the
tosses Albert threw were aimed at
Bill Willard and Hugh Gallarneau,
and very few of them missed the
mark.
Thornhill has tentatively sched
uled scrimmages for every Wednes
day and Thursday afternoon.
