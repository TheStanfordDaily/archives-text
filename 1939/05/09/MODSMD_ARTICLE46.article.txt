STANFORD'S track strike is gradually boil
ing down into an unfortunate incident.
At this point, that's about all that can be said
for it, although behind yesterday's argument
there is a good deal for consideration.
In the first place, the cards are stacked against
the boys. Even if they persuaded the B.A.C. to
change its mind, they would have to run the
scrutiny of the Faculty Athletics Committee.
Three of the members of the Board of Athletic
Control are members of the committee, also.
In the second place, application blanks for
entries in the IC4-A meet are due in New York
before midnight, Thursday. Today is Tuesday
and there's much red tape still ahead.
The arguments in the case are clear-cut:
The track team, on the one side, feels that if
the football team, members of the tennis team,
and members of the golf team are sent East,
some representatives of Stanford should be
sent to the New York meet on May 27.
The Board of Athletic Control, not arguing
finances this time, points out that such a trip
would mean too much time out before finals
at the end of the quarter. If men are sent to the
IC4-A meet, that means that they must leave
here to be in Seattle for the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet on May 20, go to New York for
the next week-end, and return to Stanford about
June 1.
That is too much, says the Board. Competi
tion for which the other teams are being sent
comes after the quarter is over.
Incidental to these main points is the track
men's contention that they have better Bawlout
averages than the other teams.
Which is right?
Probably growing out of an informal dis
cussion following the Board's action on Sun
day, the "strike" idea gradually picked up steam
until it reached the proportions of a good news
story by 11 o'clock.
It's not such good news any more, unless Dr.
Wilbur so acts to find the trip feasible.
If he does, it will be better than ever.
At this particular point, however, the entire
situation has become complicated by early
over-enthusiasm and what now appears to be
a back-down.
The men who have acted as spokesmen spoke
for the whole team. But it was an unfortunate
move to delegate as spokesmen the very men
who would be most likely to make the trip.
And they talked themselves into an unten
able position. But a spectacular one.
Their only smart move was to register their
complaint with Dr. Wilbur.
Whether or not the members of the team go
East, then, there is one thing for future teams
to remember:
Complain first, threaten later.
