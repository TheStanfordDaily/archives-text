# He Speaks Tonight

### 
TONIGHT the Tuesday Evening Series skips
a beat. Instead of a speaker or artist on the
regular series, Roy W. Howard will deliver the
annual Donald R. Mellett Memorial Lecture.
Speaking on "Your American Press," Mr.
Howard is an appropriate person to deliver this
annual lecture, which was established in honor
of the courageous Canton, Ohio, editor who
was shot down while in the midst of a crusade
on the city's organized vice and crime.
Mr. Howard is an appropriate speaker be
cause he is director of the board of America's
foremost liberal newspaper chain — Scripps-
Howard newspapers.
Moreover, Mr. Howard will have something
to talk about. Less than three weeks ago he
returned from a tour of European capitals
where he interviewed industrial, political, and
journalistic leaders, analyzing their impressions
of the current world situation.
But this brief European tour is the least of
his experiences. He scooped all the regular
Moscow correspondents in 1936 with an ex
clusive interview with Josef Stalin. He was the
first journalist to interview Emperor Hirohito
of Japan.
Mr. Howard doesn't make many speeches.
But, with freedom of the press being restricted
all over the world, he apparently feels it his
duty to speak out, taking as his occasion the
Mellett lecture.—R. D.
