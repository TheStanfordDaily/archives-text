HE stood on English Corner and sighed.
Every few minutes a car whizzed past
Memorial Hall and down the road toward town.
He saw traffic pouring into the Palm Drive in
tersection from the side streets, Model T's and
'39 convertibles hurrying to Palo Alto without
bothering to look around them.
He looked at the freshman and the English
grad who were standing in the shadow of the
oaks, waiting for a ride. And he remembered.
Years before that concrete bench stood there,
waiting futilely for someone to sit down. Years

before the chains had become a permanent
fixture on Lasuen.
Then, no car would think of passing Eng
lish Corner without stopping to pick up Palo
Alto passengers. A date was considered the
only legitimate excuse for passing up anyone
who was waiting for a ride.
Perhaps the closed street has made them
careless, he thought. Rides to town are a tra
dition, and traditions have been depreciated
lately at Stanford. He shook his head—pretty
soon sophomores will be wearing cords.
Some of those ideas are a little silly, he
guessed. But the jitney service to Paly was a
practical custom. People are in too much of a
hurry these days, too wrapped up in them
selves to look around them, he thought.
A '32 Chevvie stopped and picked up the
freshman and the English grad. The door
slammed shut and it drove away.—L. L.
