# BULL SESSION
## BUILD, BUILT, BILLED 
### JOHN COBBS 
A SI pointed out yesterday, Stanford University seems
to be an institution suffering from an over-active
pituitary gland. We have expanded physical plant
while income has remained constant.; we have assumed
maintenance on new buildings at the same time that
professors' salaries were carrying a 10 per cent cut.
We have grown like a circus giant; and in the process
we have acquired a fine set of institutional growing
pains.
A tvpical example of the aches that expansion has
left with us in the financing arrangement for Memo
rial Hall. If the analogy to medicine were carried out,
the Theater set-up undoubtedly would be diagnosed
as acute indigestion.

The history of Memorial Hall is an involved record
of extravagance and wishful thinking, but the main
points are clear. The students, suffering from the ex
pansion fever, decided that they were willing to pay
for a new Theater. When the cloud of estimates,
authorizations and appropriations cleai'ed away we
found that the University had advanced $330,000 to
build Memorial Hall. The students were pledged to
pay this. Money was to be raised by paying an extra
dollar at registration each quarter, and by appropriat
ing part of the profits of the Union.
But this was only a minor part of the ache. The
real pain came when we promised to pay the Uni
versity five per cent interest on our gift. It is esti
mated that for 20 years Stanford students will owe
interest on the unpaid balance of their note.

A ND five per cent is not a nominal charge, intended
to cover bookkeeping costs. The average rate of
return on all the University's investments during the
past year was 4.04 per cent. More than that, in its
advances on the Theater, the University incurred no
risk; as long as it has students, payments will be
made on the note. Interest rates are supposed to be
reduced when there is no risk.
Five per cent interest on $380,000 amounts to
$16,500 each year. Average income from the extra dol
lar at registration is $12,000. If it were not for the
contribution from the Union, we would be going deeper
into debt each year.
The University has iron clad explanations for charg
ing us interest on our gift. It points out that it can
not tie up funds in long-term loans at low rates. It
turns its budget inside out, and proves that it needs
the money. It scoffs at the idea that it could not have
invested the money anywhere else at five per cent
and that it uses the theater note to pry additional
contributions from the students.
But the fact remains that the University drove the
kind of a bargain that gets melodrama villains hissed
off the stage. It is charging us a stiff rate of interest
on money we are giving it.
It is too late to worry about apportioning the blame.
The notes are signed. The dollar has been on our
registration bill as long as undergraduates can remem
ber. And it will still be on the bill 20 years from now.
The funny part about it all is that the University
didn't particularly want the Theater. In asking for
the appropriation, the comptroller explained carefully
that it was the students who demanded it; the trust
ees considered it less important than other construc
tion. But the urge to build was upon us. The Univer
sity drove a hard bargain because it needed money;
and yet it assumed yearly maintenance costs that
amount to some $8,000. It wanted to grow. The stu
dent body put itself in debt for a generation. It
wanted the Univex-sity to grow.
Is everybody happy?
