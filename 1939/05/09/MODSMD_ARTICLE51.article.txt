I was quite surprised yesterday when someone told
me the Thetas had a pig.
First the Thetas and then the pig.
It was too incongruous. I couldn't quite imagine
the Thetas with a pig groveling around their living
room.
I was restored and left, a little flat when I heard that
it wasn't the Thetas at all who have the pig. It is the
Dekes.
So the Dekes have a pig. All right, they have a
pig. So what?
But if the Thetas had had one . . .
