## REVIEW-A-LA-FRENCH 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
From time to time we have seen
reviews of films in the Daily — they I
have been insipid and meaningless.
We qiute understand that the Spirit j
of Criticism should never have been |
able to get under the arm of the
Statue of Liberty.
The American conception of a film
critic is a person who is paid to
write eulogies of nonsense; but
Stanford's newspaper surely doesn't
depend on the cheap and lurid ad- J
vertislng of Hollywood.
We suppose that you who arc on j
The Daily could have good film re
views printed, if you knew how to ;
write them. Of course, one may ar
gue, "American films being so ere- i
tinous as they are, what can the ,
poor critic do?"
For your edification we have j
translated a criticism of Gunga Din, I
which appeared in Les Annales (25 j
March). We know that we haven't j
done justice to the fine nuances of |
the original French text, which of |
course you may consult.
"Gunga Din, based on a poem by I
Rudyard Kipling, is another of those
American films dedicated to the j
greater glory of the English Army in I
India. Adventures, scuffles, battles,

assaults, stark heroism. The melo
dramatic part (what more can one
ask?) is excellent. Rarely have we
seen so many blows given or re
ceived, so many messy spills, wild
rides, and tumbles into gorges.
"But I preferred the Bengal Lanc
er in which there were at least a
few shreds of characters, and fewer
of those absurd episodes such as the
meeting of the Stranglers in the
mysterious temple—an episode truly
so stupid that one is almost ashamed
of ever having been thirteen years
old."
