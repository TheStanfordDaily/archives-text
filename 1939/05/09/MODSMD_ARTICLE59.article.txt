The Editor, Sir:
We wonderâ€”
1. How the "pencil-sharpener" in
the libe can ruin so many nice long
pencils? A good sharpener isn't too
expensive!
2. Why people can't be quiet in
the libe? It's supposed to be a ref
uge to which to flee when you really
want (or have to) study!
3. What's wrong with the lights in
the libe? I'll bet the oculists in Paly
pay the administration to keep the
lights as low as possible!

4. What'll lx* done about it?
Probably nothing!
