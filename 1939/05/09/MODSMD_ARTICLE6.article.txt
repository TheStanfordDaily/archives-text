# Heaven Gives Stage Crews New Problems
## 
### 
Confronting the stage crew of the
Division of Speech and Drama's
production, "No More Peace," which
will be given this Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday nights in Memorial
Theater, is the problem of Heaven.
Since there are no eye witnesses
who can be consulted concerning
the furnishings, lighting effects, and
scenery in general, there has been
need for a good deal of imagina
tion. However, Heaven, as pictured
in the play, is full of a good deal of
confusion, so the turmoil idea will
be carried out in the set.
It has been arranged so that two
banks of clouds will be tearing full
tilt across the stage, one in back and
the other just in front of the foot
lights.
So that the principles will not be
obscured by the activity of the
clouds, the Heaven set has been built
11 feet above the stage level.
The idea of a satirical presenta
tion of Heaven has been done on the
Broadway stage recently in the
Lunt-Fontanne production of "Am
phytrion 38." Stanford audiences
saw much the same soi't of thing in
the French picture, also about the
Amphytrion legend, which was
given as a part, of the Sunday movie
series.
According to Waldemar Johansen,
director, there is a need for men
who have tuxedos and who can
waltz, in the production. If there
are any men who desire to be in the
play, they are requested to come to
rehearsals tonight and tomorrow at
7 o'clock in the Memorial Theater.
These men will not have speaking
parts and will be finished at 9:15
o'clock.
