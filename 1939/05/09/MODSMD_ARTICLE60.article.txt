# NAME FOR WAR LIBE
## 
### 
The* Editor, Sir:
Since the new building which is
about to be started on the campus
will be a constant subject of con
versation, I think any confusion as
to its name should be cleared up
immediately. To this end I there
fore suggest that the name shall be
Boulder War Library.
