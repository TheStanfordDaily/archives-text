" r I' , HE nation must sleep on its I
haversack," boomed British
War Secretary Leslie Hore-Belisha
at the House of Commons as he an
nounced that his government will
mobilize 300,000 military, naval, and
aircraft reserves within the next, four
months.
These additions plus Ihe soldiers
pushed into service by the recently
adopted conscription measure will
swell the ranks of the territorial
forces (reserves) to 300,000 men.
Hinged on the tense conditions in
which Europe is living, the first
peace-time move of this kind since I
the Stuart kings justifies itself with
the claim that in today's wars hos
tilities begin without the aggressor
giving notice.
* * *
While Briton after Briton falls
hack into line, from the Vatican
comes a gleam of hope which may
mean the only possible solution of
the problem of how to keep Eu
rope at peace. Wily and experi
enced in diplomatic affairs and in
ternational relations, Pope Pius
XII has picked this tactful mo
ment to call a conference of the
major powers to settle the causes
of conflict and to postpone, if not
to avoid, another war.
Berlin reacted favorably to the in
vitation of the papal nuncio sug
gesting that problems in general and
that of Danzig in particular can be j
ironed out if England, France, Italy. !
Poland, and Germany put their
heads together.
* * $
REARING that the projected con- i
fercnce may be merely an en- j
core to Munich with Poland replac- [
ing Czechoslovakia as the victim,
the Anglo-French alliance has been
noticeably cool about the idea.
Chamberlain and Daladier have re
ferred the question to Warsaw in or
der to assure Poland's representa
tion at the conference, if there is I
one.
The interference of the Pope in j
international strife is historically j
speaking a sensational event. Not I
since medieval times, when the !
Church was the temporal and
spiritual ruler of all Europe, lias j
(he Iloly See assumed the role of
mediator.
Word of the efforts of Pius XII to
materialize his prayers for world
peace inevitably brings to mind the
supreme Curia of Innocent 111 and
that historic scene when Frederick j
Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Em- i
pire knelt in the snow before Al- |
exander II to do penance at i
Canossa.
Never again will the Church re
gain its medieval power, but if the
Vatican meeting is able to find a
balm for Europe's troubles, the Pap
acy will have achieved something
worthy of being called a miracle.
r PHE Danzig issue is still hanging
fire with Britain finally realiz
ing that Soviet Russia is going to
give her the cold shoulder and the
move for a Moscow-Belin agreement
well under way.
Stalin refuses to be drawn into a
pact which obliges him to come to
the aid of the democratic allies
without guaranteeing him recip
rocal aid in case of attack.
