# 'No More Peace' Opens Tomorrow
## 
### 
Social significance with a snicker is the keynote of the Division of
Speech and Drama production "No More Peace," which will have its
Stanford premiere tomorrow night in Memorial Hall at 8:15 o'clock.
Imagine Socrates trying to mediate between Napoleon and a Ilitler
csquc dictator named, appropriately, Cain, and giving up in disgust. This

is what happens in the biting satire
on war and modern totalitarianism
by Ernst Toller.
And Toller knows what he is talk
ing about—about the earthly half
of the play, at least. A voluntary
exile from Nazi Germany, because
of socialist leanings, he has had
every chance to observe the psy
schology of a dictator-lcd people.
But the serious side of the picture
will be soft-pedalled, and humor
will be the order of the d;iy in "No
More Peace." The denouement all
hinges on a discontented lady angel
who has a yearning for a pair of
modern stream-lined wings.
Playing Angel 1100 will be Bar
bara Thrasher, who has demonstrat
ed her ability at comedy parts in
such recent productions as "Royal
Family of Broadway" and "Shoe
maker's Holiday." As the wise but
futile Socrates will be Garrett Star
ver, and as the you-know-who
he's-supposed-to-be dictator will be
Dan Holtom.
The plot evolves around a bet
that Napoleon makes with St.
Francis of Assisi about whether it
is possible to start a war in this en
lightened day and age as easily as
it used to be. The little country of
Dunkelstein is the object, of this
heavenly experimentation, and it
reacts just as the realistic Napoleon
said it would.
Performances will be given on
Thursday, Friday and Saturday
nights. All tickets are reserved and
are 50 cents. They may be obtained
at the box office, or by phoning
Local 591 or Palo Alto 22041.
