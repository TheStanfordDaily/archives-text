# Roy Howard Pleas For Free Press
## Newspapers Cited As 'U. S. Defense For Democracy' 
### 
America must preserve its faith in
the country's free press, "the cham
pion and refuge of the people in
time of stress," believes Roy W.
Howard, famed American news
paperman-press lord, who delivered
the tenth annual Donald R. Mellett
Memorial Lecture last night in Me
morial Hall auditorium.
"Permit no foreign force to under
mine or abridge the freedom of your
press, which is the nation's greatest
defender of democracy. With all its
shortcomings, democracy is still the
freest and most enlightened govern
ment that the mind of man has yet
evolved," asserted the publisher of
the New York World-Telegram.
"No nation is wholly immune from
the threat of totalitarianism or its
alien ideologies. The efficiency and
durability of American democracy
has been challenged, but this chal
lenge comes, (liot from the left, but
from the extreme right. This new
movement may bring the greatest
social and political changes since
feudalism."
FORESEES EVOLUTION
Serving notice to both capital and
labor that their "short-sighted and
unimaginative leaders can no longer
continue their struggles with each
other against the best interests of
the people as a whole," Mr. Howard
declared that "in the next few years',
journalism will face its greatest and
most difficult task, that of preparing
ihc public for the introduction of a
sane political and economic evolu
tion."
The speaker, chairman of the
board of (he Scripps-Howard news
papers, characterized the American
newspaper as "little more than a
mirror of everyday life," explaining
that "the image is neither better nor
worse than what it. reflects."
AMERICA WELL-INFORMED
"The general public of America is
better informed than that of any
other country in the world," be
lieves the newspaperman. "The av
erage American reader has today a
better understanding of the forces
that affect his life than any other
citizen of any other nation in the
world."
"Nothing in corporate form has so
many human attributes as the typi
cal American daily newspaper," as
serted the speaker, who believes that.
!)0 per cent of the nation's news
papers are making a conscious effort
to secure honesty and objectivity in
the presentation of the news.

Stanford alumnus, President Wil
liam Seripps Kellogg of the Califor
nia Newspaper Publishers' Associa
tion, and published of the Glcndale

"Permit no foreign force to under
mine or abridge the freedom of your
press, which is the nation's greatest
defender of democracy. With all its
shortcomings, democracy is still the
freest and most enlightened govern
ment that the mind of man has yet
evolved," asserted the publisher of
the New York World-Telegram.
"No nation is wholly immune from
the threat of totalitarianism or its
alien ideologies. The efficiency and
durability of American democracy
has been challenged, but this chal
lenge comes, (liot from the left, but
from the extreme right. This new
movement may bring the greatest
social and political changes since
feudalism."
FORESEES EVOLUTION
Serving notice to both capital and
labor that their "short-sighted and
unimaginative leaders can no longer

other against the best interests of
the people as a whole," Mr. Howard
declared that "in the next few years',
journalism will face its greatest and
most difficult task, that of preparing
ihc public for the introduction of a
sane political and economic evolu
tion."
The speaker, chairman of the
board of (he Scripps-Howard news
papers, characterized the American
newspaper as "little more than a
mirror of everyday life," explaining
that "the image is neither better nor
worse than what it. reflects."
AMERICA WELL-INFORMED
"The general public of America is
better informed than that of any
other country in the world," be
lieves the newspaperman. "The av
erage American reader has today a
better understanding of the forces
that affect his life than any other
citizen of any other nation in the
world."
"Nothing in corporate form has so
many human attributes as the typi
cal American daily newspaper," as
serted the speaker, who believes that.
!)0 per cent of the nation's news
papers are making a conscious effort
to secure honesty and objectivity in
the presentation of the news.
Mr. Howard was introduced by a
Stanford alumnus, President Wil
liam Seripps Kellogg of the Califor
nia Newspaper Publishers' Associa
tion, and published of the Glcndale

America must preserve its faith in
the country's free press, "the cham
pion and refuge of the people in
time of stress," believes Roy W.
Howard, famed American news
paperman-press lord, who delivered
the tenth annual Donald R. Mellett
Memorial Lecture last night in Me
morial Hall auditorium.
