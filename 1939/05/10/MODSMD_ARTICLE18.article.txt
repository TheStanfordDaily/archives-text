# Excom Okays Conference Appropriation
## Hinrichs ,Horn to Be Leadership Institute Committee Heads 
### DICK DUDMAN 
God spoke to Ex Committee last
I night.
At least that's what Committce
| man Bill Turner thought when the
i lights blinked ofT for a moment just
after members had approved a $100
appropriation for the America-Japan
Student Conference, to be held this
summer at U.S.C.
"It's a message from Heaven,"
Turner breathed.
Sole objector to the expenditure
was Student Manager Tom Killefer,
who contended a week ago that the
A.S.S.U. could not afford it, that
$100 was granted two years ago only
because the conference was held at
Stanford then. Killefer ultimately
; withdrew his objection.
Other business follows:
LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE: Ap
pointed to the planning committee
for this annual "training school"

May 17, 24, and 31, it was decided.
COKE MACHINES: Killefer told
members that Cellar profits arc
threatened somewhat by the Coca-
Cola machines around the campus,
newest proposed machine being for
the Daily office. He suggested that
machines might be installed in Quad
and Chaparral offices.
"Chaparral hasn't room for a coke
machine in their office," Harry
Sheldon commented.
Committee members decided they
have no objections to installation of
the machines.
MASQUE BAM, DEFICIT: Ro
vena Conn, co-chairman, imported a
$200 loss on the Masque Ball. The
loss will be made up through in

At least that's what Committce

i lights blinked ofT for a moment just
after members had approved a $100
appropriation for the America-Japan
Student Conference, to be held this
summer at U.S.C.
"It's a message from Heaven,"
Turner breathed.
Sole objector to the expenditure
was Student Manager Tom Killefer,
who contended a week ago that the
A.S.S.U. could not afford it, that
$100 was granted two years ago only
because the conference was held at
Stanford then. Killefer ultimately
; withdrew his objection.

COKE MACHINES: Killefer told
members that Cellar profits arc
threatened somewhat by the Coca-
Cola machines around the campus,
newest proposed machine being for
the Daily office. He suggested that
machines might be installed in Quad
and Chaparral offices.
"Chaparral hasn't room for a coke
machine in their office," Harry
Sheldon commented.
Committee members decided they
have no objections to installation of
the machines.
