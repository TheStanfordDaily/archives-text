## Recommendation to Wilbur By Faculty Committee Winds Up Strike Threat 'Class Absence' Given as Reason For Refusal; Templeton Names Entries for Fresno Relays Saturday 
###

This was the decision announced yesterday in a recommendation to
President Wilbur from the Faculty Athletic Committee, which approved
the Board »>f Athletic Control's action in voting- not to participate in the
lias tern meet, to be held May 27 in New York.

Official reason given for the com
mittee's action was that the trip
would involve a two-week absence
from classes just before finals.
The recommendation is, in effect.,
a final decision.

<18-hour strike, called Sunday eve
ning, came to an end. Captain

HISERMAN TALKS
"It's all over now. I guess there'll
be no strike."
The cindermen threatened, if the
B.A.C. ruling were not reversed, to
refuse to compete in any more
meets this season. This would have
eliminated Stanford from the Fresno
Relays Saturday; the NC2A meet in
June in Los Angeles; the Pacific-
Coast Conference meet in Seattle,
May 20; and the A.A.U. champion
ships this summer.
The committee, three of whose

President .Wilbur into the scholar
ship records of the trackmen.

meet when lield in the East.
"This involves no special inter

Stanford will be unrepresented at the IC4A meet.
This was the decision announced yesterday in a recommendation to
President Wilbur from the Faculty Athletic Committee, which approved
the Board »>f Athletic Control's action in voting- not to participate in the
lias tern meet, to be held May 27 in New York.

Official reason given for the com
mittee's action was that the trip
would involve a two-week absence
from classes just before finals.
The recommendation is, in effect.,
a final decision.
Simultaneously, the track team's
<18-hour strike, called Sunday eve
ning, came to an end. Captain
Stan Hiserman, when informed of
the committee's recommendation,
said:
HISERMAN TALKS
"It's all over now. I guess there'll
be no strike."
The cindermen threatened, if the
B.A.C. ruling were not reversed, to
refuse to compete in any more
meets this season. This would have
eliminated Stanford from the Fresno
Relays Saturday; the NC2A meet in
June in Los Angeles; the Pacific-
Coast Conference meet in Seattle,
May 20; and the A.A.U. champion
ships this summer.
The committee, three of whose

President .Wilbur into the scholar
ship records of the trackmen.

team regularly attends the NC2-A
meet when lield in the East.
"This involves no special inter

is held on the Pacific Coast, how
ever, an eastern trip will be omit
ted when serious loss, of class time
is involved."
Spokesmen of the trackmen for
the short-lived "strike" were Clyde
