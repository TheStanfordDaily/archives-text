# LANEY WINS TARVER AWARD Frost Writes from Heidelberg
## 
### 
Jack Laney, Delta Chi, was
awarded the Bruce Tarver Memo
rial Interfraternity Scholarship by
the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol at its last meeting. The schol
arship this year will be with the
University of Osol at Oslo, Norway,
not the University of Heidelberg at
Heidelberg, Germany, as it was last
year.
Begun last year, this is the second
awarding of the Tarver award as
a foreign exchange scholarship. Un
til last year it was a scholarship
which was awarded to the fraternity
having the highest scholastic aver
age on the campus.
Laney was chosen from a list of
nine applicants for "all-around mer
it." Standing high in his class
scholastically with a B-plus to A
minus average, he has been very
active in extracurricular activities.
MANY ACTIVITIES
He was the head of Rally Com
mittee; he i.s a member of the var
sity tennis team; he was chairman
of the Stanford Fund, the Alumni
Drive, off-campus drive for the
Convalescent Home.
A student from the University of
Oslo will be a guest of the Delta
Chi House next year and have his
tuition paid by Interfraternity
Council.
FROST '38 WINNER
Gordy Frost, former editor of The
Daily, holds the award at present
and is now attending the Univer
sity of Heidelberg in Germany.
Adolf Boda is the exchange student
from Germany and is living at the
Beta house.
Art Doering. Stanford golfer, re
cieved the Phi Delta Theta ex
change scholarship with Heidelberg
for next year, and Marsall Linn was
awarded the Sigma Nu scholarship
with Switzerland. All of the foreign
exchange scholarships were handled
through the Interfraternity Council
office and the Institute of Interna
tional Education in New York.

Sent to Bud McDuflie, president
of the Interfraterniay Council, in a
special package to bring it through
the Nazi censors, this is the first of
two articles by Gordy Frost, Tar
ver Memorial Interfraternity Ex
change Scholarship student and for
mer editor of The Daily.
Frost in the letter to McDuffie
said: "I'm inclosing a little yarn
(which I hope gets through okay).
There's a lot more to say, but for
obvious reasons I'm not in the po
sition to shoot off. Even this may be
a little hot to get through." The
yarn is as follows:

By GORDY FROST

HEIDELBERG. Germany, March
3.â€”When some of our American Big
Guns in Washington begin to boom
uncontrollably, as they did early
this year, I begin to think that they
might well spend a year in Germany
so that they can aim straight.
No, I haven't turned Nazi, but
during the six months that I've lived
with the German people as a stu
dent here in Heidelberg I've seen the
second side of a question which
many Americans credit as having
only one.
PEOPLES MUCH ALIKE
To say that the 30 exchange stu
dents in Germany are "messengers
of good will" may be overstating the
case, but that they can help to pro
mote an understanding between two
peoples, purely as living human be
ings, is quite possible.
The governments of the United
States and Germany are at odds and
are of entirely different character;
the peoples themselves are much
alike. We all seem to want the same
things: peace (the Germans are as
strong for it as we are), happiness,
enough to eat, the roof overhead,
and some fun.
HITLER SUPPORT
Hitler has, so far, taken them from
their rotten post-inflation time near
er to these ends. Some of the things
he's done they don't quite agree
with, and they know that they have
made mistakes just as we have. For
instance, the November incidents
against the Jews had very little
popular support; they were no more
spontaneous than a riot scene staged
in a Hollywood studio.
But this is not a discussion of Ger
man governmental action. The sa
lient point here is that Germans as
individuals aren't much different
from Americans as individuals. Be
sides, they both like beer.
FRIENDSHIP CHANNELS
As I see it, there can be two con
nection links between countries; that
of government through diplomatic
channels, and that of man-to-man

through commercial and mutual
friendship channels.
In promoting the latter, exchange
scholarships may go a long way.
I've talked with quite a number
of Germans who were exchange stu
dents in America last year, and are
now home in Germany carrying on
their study. On questions of inter
national and national politics, we
most always agree eye to eye. They
will admit tne shortcomings of their
set-up, 1 of ours, and we usually
wind up over the last beer with a
general declaration that each has its
place, considering the general tem
perament, habits and history of the
people.
