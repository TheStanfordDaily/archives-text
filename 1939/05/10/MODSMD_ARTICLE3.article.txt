# Dining Hall to Remain Closed
## Brannerites Still Must 'Eat Around' Steady Boarder List Fails to Assure Cost Of Operating Plant 
### 
Branner Dining Hall will not be
reopened next year, according to an
announcement made yesterday by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. Be
cause the Administration finds it
impossible to finance the operation
of the dining room, independent hall
men will continue to eat at the
Union or off-campus next fall.
"We have been unable to work out
a scheme to pay for running the
hall which meets with the Comp
troller's approval," stated Dr. Wil
bur. Chief difficulty lies in the
impossibility of assuring a steady
list of board-payers.
The University cannot afford to
take the chance of reopening the
dining hall and having to close it
because of insufficient patronage,
the President said. Cost of putting
the plant in shape to prepare meals
has been estimated at more than
$5000 by Assistant Comptroller Er
nest Erwin.
SURVEY TO DE MADE
When hall men make their room
reservations for this year, the Dean
of Men's office will question all in
dependents to determine where they
are eating at present and whether
they would eat in Branner Dining
Hall if it were put in use again.
With definite data in hand and
figures on the approximate loso such
a move would mean to the Union
Cellar, there is still a good chance
that the room will be opened some
time in the future, according to Dean
of Men John Bunn. For the present
the Administration does not wish to
make it mandatory that Branner
I'esidents cat there in order to in
.sure financial backing.
ORIGINAL PLAN
Branner Dining Hall was inaugu
rated nine years ago to serve in
dependents. Originally it had been
planned as a central eating unit for
Toyon, Branner, and a third hall
which never was built. After a trial
period with a dwindling number of
diners, the room was closed because
board bills did not come near to
covering the cost of operation.
Last winter quarter Maurice Knox,
a Branner sophomore, circulated a
petition to reopen the dining hall,
and he obtained over 100 signatures.
Dean Bunn lent enthusiastic sup
port to the plan with the proviso that
financial details be worked out in a
manner satisfactory to the Comp
troller.
To insure the dining room against
a dearth of customers, it was pro
posed that Branner be converted into
a residence dormitory for inde
pendents. These men would be re
quired to eat in their hall just as
freshmen are in Encina.
With Branner reserved for un
affiliated men, Toyon was to be
gradually transformed into a dormi
tory for eating club members. The
plan of requiring all Branner resi
dents to pay for board in the dining
hall was calculated to guard against
a loss of patronage during the year.

pendents. These men would be re
quired to eat in their hall just as
freshmen are in Encina.
With Branner reserved for un
affiliated men, Toyon was to be
gradually transformed into a dormi
tory for eating club members. The
plan of requiring all Branner resi
dents to pay for board in the dining
hall was calculated to guard against
a loss of patronage during the year.
Branner Dining Hall will not be
reopened next year, according to an
announcement made yesterday by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. Be
cause the Administration finds it
impossible to finance the operation
of the dining room, independent hall
men will continue to eat at the
Union or off-campus next fall.
"We have been unable to work out
a scheme to pay for running the
hall which meets with the Comp
troller's approval," stated Dr. Wil
bur. Chief difficulty lies in the
impossibility of assuring a steady
list of board-payers.
The University cannot afford to
take the chance of reopening the
dining hall and having to close it
because of insufficient patronage,
the President said. Cost of putting
the plant in shape to prepare meals
has been estimated at more than
$5000 by Assistant Comptroller Er
nest Erwin.
SURVEY TO DE MADE
When hall men make their room
reservations for this year, the Dean
of Men's office will question all in
dependents to determine where they
are eating at present and whether
they would eat in Branner Dining
Hall if it were put in use again.
With definite data in hand and
figures on the approximate loso such
a move would mean to the Union
Cellar, there is still a good chance
that the room will be opened some
time in the future, according to Dean
of Men John Bunn. For the present
the Administration does not wish to
make it mandatory that Branner
I'esidents cat there in order to in
.sure financial backing.
ORIGINAL PLAN
Branner Dining Hall was inaugu
rated nine years ago to serve in
dependents. Originally it had been
planned as a central eating unit for
Toyon, Branner, and a third hall
which never was built. After a trial
period with a dwindling number of
diners, the room was closed because
board bills did not come near to
covering the cost of operation.
Last winter quarter Maurice Knox,
a Branner sophomore, circulated a
petition to reopen the dining hall,
and he obtained over 100 signatures.
Dean Bunn lent enthusiastic sup
port to the plan with the proviso that
financial details be worked out in a
manner satisfactory to the Comp
troller.
To insure the dining room against
a dearth of customers, it was pro
posed that Branner be converted into
a residence dormitory for inde
pendents. These men would be re
quired to eat in their hall just as
freshmen are in Encina.
With Branner reserved for un
affiliated men, Toyon was to be
