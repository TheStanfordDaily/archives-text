TIIE TRACK STRIKE is over, in case you didn't know there had been
one, but the complaints and cross-complaints which the argument on a
trip to the IC4A stirred up will be ringing in Stanford's ears for a lony
time to come.
But somehow, somewhere there should be a solution to the maze of
ticklish situations into which the Board of Athletic Control and Indian
athletic teams wend their steady way. Maybe the make-up of the board
three faculty, three students, and three alumni —isn't the correct balance
lor such a commission to have. Then again maybe all of Stanford's
sports teams have inborn gripes which even the most perfect Board could
not heal.
Having heard speeches and soap-box oratory on both sides until it is
hard to know where to place the blame for all these charges of favorit
ism, suppression, oppression, we can only show a few reasons why
each side in the controversy at hand feels as it docs.
The li.A.C'. has stated over and over that the planned New York
trip is undesirable only from the academic point of view. The fact
that secondary golf and tennis teams are being sent to national cham
pionships is proof enough of their assertion
They feel that a trip from the 17th of May, when the squad leaves
for Seattle and the conference meet, to the Ist of June, the earliest
date at which the tracksters could be back from New York, is too
tough. Too lough, even, for men with high bawl out averages.
Then, too, the B.A.C. wants the layman, old John Q. Public, to
havti 110 reason to look down on a school which allows its athletes
long and extended tours when they might he in the class-room.
And what is equally important, the hoard does not like to be dic
tated to by a bunch of "kids." No matter what the reason nor how
mighty the cause, the hoard naturally feels itself superior to imma
ture threats. Sincerity of purpose doesn't make a lot of difference,
especially when the sincere one, in his teen-age rag, calls you a
stumble-bum and an incompetent. Them's fighting words!
* # ill IK
Well, those few points are perhaps reason enough to quash a hoped
for trip; yet listen to the athlete's rebuttal.'
The track team, almost to a man, feeLs that it is the especial bane of
the B.A.C. It feels, and perhaps not without some reason, that, the board
is down on track, (he track coaches, and the track team itself. The team
believes the board's attitudes toward il in all instances this spring have
borne out their fears.
In the current issue, there is a surprising blast at Win. B. Owens,
the eminent law professor who is not only a hoard member, but presi
dent of the NCAA, collegedom's great union. And they feel that Prof.
Owens has no desire ot let the Indian greats compete in a meet spon
sored by the IC4A. The NCAA and the IC4A love each other just
like John L. Lewis and William Green.
The split between the two national athletic unions is one of the
widest breeches in the annals of sports. No one has ever attempted to
show that the professor is a prejudiced man. The facts just happen to
crop up in the current case, and we thought you might be interested
in the nasty undercurrent.
The track team, and many others along with them, feel that the BA.C
has taken a demagogic attitude beyond reason. The student members of
the board, who are nearly always prize athletes, are like puppets on a
string. Their lack of power on the board is something at which to marvel
And who can blame an athlete for usurping the organization which sc
many times offers him his literal bread and butter?

THAT COVERS most of the ofTense and defense on both sides. In
ihe present case, the offensive board has won again, although President
Wilbur again gave a complete review of their action before turning the
situation over to the Faculty Athletic Committee, as he did the case when
the board rendered Tiny Thornhill an "indefinite" contract for coaching
loot ball.
If you were a judge sitting alone on the present case, for instance,
what kind of a decision would you render? Maybe you think they are
both right. Or mavbe you think they both could stand a lot of "purging,"
in the manner of the day.
A good judge would eventually have to pick one of the other cases as
the best and throw the other into discard. But the track team-BA.C.
squabble has had no judge. And don't look at us as if you were wonder
ing which side we are sitting in on. We've said enough already.

ism, suppression, oppression, we can only show a few reasons why
each side in the controversy at hand feels as it docs.
The li.A.C'. has stated over and over that the planned New York
trip is undesirable only from the academic point of view. The fact
that secondary golf and tennis teams are being sent to national cham
pionships is proof enough of their assertion
They feel that a trip from the 17th of May, when the squad leaves
for Seattle and the conference meet, to the Ist of June, the earliest
date at which the tracksters could be back from New York, is too
tough. Too lough, even, for men with high bawl out averages.
Then, too, the B.A.C. wants the layman, old John Q. Public, to
havti 110 reason to look down on a school which allows its athletes
long and extended tours when they might he in the class-room.
And what is equally important, the hoard does not like to be dic
tated to by a bunch of "kids." No matter what the reason nor how
mighty the cause, the hoard naturally feels itself superior to imma
ture threats. Sincerity of purpose doesn't make a lot of difference,
especially when the sincere one, in his teen-age rag, calls you a
stumble-bum and an incompetent. Them's fighting words!
* # ill IK
Well, those few points are perhaps reason enough to quash a hoped
for trip; yet listen to the athlete's rebuttal.'
The track team, almost to a man, feeLs that it is the especial bane of
the B.A.C. It feels, and perhaps not without some reason, that, the board
is down on track, (he track coaches, and the track team itself. The team
believes the board's attitudes toward il in all instances this spring have
borne out their fears.
In the current issue, there is a surprising blast at Win. B. Owens,
the eminent law professor who is not only a hoard member, but presi
dent of the NCAA, collegedom's great union. And they feel that Prof.
Owens has no desire ot let the Indian greats compete in a meet spon
sored by the IC4A. The NCAA and the IC4A love each other just
like John L. Lewis and William Green.
The split between the two national athletic unions is one of the
widest breeches in the annals of sports. No one has ever attempted to
show that the professor is a prejudiced man. The facts just happen to
crop up in the current case, and we thought you might be interested
in the nasty undercurrent.
The track team, and many others along with them, feel that the BA.C
has taken a demagogic attitude beyond reason. The student members of
the board, who are nearly always prize athletes, are like puppets on a
string. Their lack of power on the board is something at which to marvel
And who can blame an athlete for usurping the organization which sc
many times offers him his literal bread and butter?

THAT COVERS most of the ofTense and defense on both sides. In
ihe present case, the offensive board has won again, although President
Wilbur again gave a complete review of their action before turning the
situation over to the Faculty Athletic Committee, as he did the case when
the board rendered Tiny Thornhill an "indefinite" contract for coaching
loot ball.
If you were a judge sitting alone on the present case, for instance,
what kind of a decision would you render? Maybe you think they are
both right. Or mavbe you think they both could stand a lot of "purging,"
in the manner of the day.
A good judge would eventually have to pick one of the other cases as
the best and throw the other into discard. But the track team-BA.C.
squabble has had no judge. And don't look at us as if you were wonder
ing which side we are sitting in on. We've said enough already.
TIIE TRACK STRIKE is over, in case you didn't know there had been
one, but the complaints and cross-complaints which the argument on a
trip to the IC4A stirred up will be ringing in Stanford's ears for a lony
time to come.
But somehow, somewhere there should be a solution to the maze of
ticklish situations into which the Board of Athletic Control and Indian
athletic teams wend their steady way. Maybe the make-up of the board
three faculty, three students, and three alumni —isn't the correct balance
lor such a commission to have. Then again maybe all of Stanford's
sports teams have inborn gripes which even the most perfect Board could
not heal.

havti 110 reason to look down on a school which allows its athletes
long and extended tours when they might he in the class-room.
And what is equally important, the hoard does not like to be dic
tated to by a bunch of "kids." No matter what the reason nor how
mighty the cause, the hoard naturally feels itself superior to imma

especially when the sincere one, in his teen-age rag, calls you a
stumble-bum and an incompetent. Them's fighting words!

Well, those few points are perhaps reason enough to quash a hoped
for trip; yet listen to the athlete's rebuttal.'
The track team, almost to a man, feeLs that it is the especial bane of
the B.A.C. It feels, and perhaps not without some reason, that, the board
is down on track, (he track coaches, and the track team itself. The team
believes the board's attitudes toward il in all instances this spring have
borne out their fears.
In the current issue, there is a surprising blast at Win. B. Owens,
the eminent law professor who is not only a hoard member, but presi
dent of the NCAA, collegedom's great union. And they feel that Prof.
Owens has no desire ot let the Indian greats compete in a meet spon
sored by the IC4A. The NCAA and the IC4A love each other just
like John L. Lewis and William Green.
The split between the two national athletic unions is one of the
widest breeches in the annals of sports. No one has ever attempted to
show that the professor is a prejudiced man. The facts just happen to
crop up in the current case, and we thought you might be interested
in the nasty undercurrent.
The track team, and many others along with them, feel that the BA.C
has taken a demagogic attitude beyond reason. The student members of
the board, who are nearly always prize athletes, are like puppets on a
string. Their lack of power on the board is something at which to marvel
And who can blame an athlete for usurping the organization which sc
many times offers him his literal bread and butter?

THAT COVERS most of the ofTense and defense on both sides. In
ihe present case, the offensive board has won again, although President
Wilbur again gave a complete review of their action before turning the
situation over to the Faculty Athletic Committee, as he did the case when
the board rendered Tiny Thornhill an "indefinite" contract for coaching
loot ball.
If you were a judge sitting alone on the present case, for instance,
what kind of a decision would you render? Maybe you think they are
both right. Or mavbe you think they both could stand a lot of "purging,"
in the manner of the day.
A good judge would eventually have to pick one of the other cases as
the best and throw the other into discard. But the track team-BA.C.
squabble has had no judge. And don't look at us as if you were wonder
ing which side we are sitting in on. We've said enough already.
TIIE TRACK STRIKE is over, in case you didn't know there had been
one, but the complaints and cross-complaints which the argument on a
trip to the IC4A stirred up will be ringing in Stanford's ears for a lony
time to come.
But somehow, somewhere there should be a solution to the maze of
ticklish situations into which the Board of Athletic Control and Indian
athletic teams wend their steady way. Maybe the make-up of the board
three faculty, three students, and three alumni —isn't the correct balance
lor such a commission to have. Then again maybe all of Stanford's
sports teams have inborn gripes which even the most perfect Board could
not heal.
Having heard speeches and soap-box oratory on both sides until it is
hard to know where to place the blame for all these charges of favorit
ism, suppression, oppression, we can only show a few reasons why
each side in the controversy at hand feels as it docs.
The li.A.C'. has stated over and over that the planned New York
trip is undesirable only from the academic point of view. The fact
that secondary golf and tennis teams are being sent to national cham
pionships is proof enough of their assertion
They feel that a trip from the 17th of May, when the squad leaves
for Seattle and the conference meet, to the Ist of June, the earliest
date at which the tracksters could be back from New York, is too
tough. Too lough, even, for men with high bawl out averages.
Then, too, the B.A.C. wants the layman, old John Q. Public, to
havti 110 reason to look down on a school which allows its athletes
long and extended tours when they might he in the class-room.
