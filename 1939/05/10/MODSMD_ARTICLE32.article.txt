# Coast Swim Stars Compete Sunday
## 
### 
An opportunity to see in action the
three greatest midtlle distance free
style swimmers on the Pacific Coast
will be given to the public on Sun
day, May 14, at Neptune Beach.
Paul Herron, star Stanford frosh
swimmer, will meet his two arch
rivals, Henry Paris and Bill Lucas,
in a special 440-yard swim. Lucas
has beaten Herron only once, and
last year Paris beat Herron in only
the 880. This latter race was run
off before Herron came to Stanford,
and his startling improvement should
give him the best chance to win.
