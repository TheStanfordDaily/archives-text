# Trackmen Work For Fresno Relays
## 
### 
Stanford's "unstruck" trackmen j
continued their practice sessions un
affected at the rejoicing about them.
During all the ruckus, Dink Tem
pleton's crew has gone through its
afternoons of jogging and jumping in
the usual manner.
The cindermen, despite the ab
sence of Templeton yesterday, tried
their hand at more baton passing
in preparation for the approaching
Fresno Relays. An added event to
the Relays program is an invita
tional 220-yard flight of low hur
dles. The sponsors of the relays are
always quick to grab a potential
record breaker, for the attractiveness
of their meet rests in the number of j
world's marks that have been set I
during it.
And in U.S.C.'s Earl Vickery, the j
meet's officials have a potential j
world beater in the lows. Vickery |
has already run 22.7, one-tenth of a j
second slower than the great Jesse j
Owens' world record, and with such
speedsters as Stanford's Captain
Stan Hiserman and Olympic Club's
Tom Moore pressing him, the Fres- I
no Relays acquire another record. |
As has become the custom, Tern- |
pleton will send his cohorts through j
a twilight meet starting at 5:30 this :
afternoon.

The soybean has been a principal j
crop in the Orient for probably 50 j
centuries.
