THERE is one more aspect of the track strike
that has not been brought into the open, as
yet, and which might as well be brought to the
attention of the Board of Athletic Control.
In ruling upon the academic consequences of
a prolonged absence from the campus of the
track team, the B.A.C. overstepped widely the
bounds of its jurisdiction.
It was for this reason —and the superior bawl
out averages of the members of the track team
—that the Sunday ruling was investigated and
the matter brought to the attention of the Faculty
Athletics Committee by President Wilbur.
The fact that three of the members of the
Faculty Athletics Committee are also members
of the Board is of some consequence.
But that fact should not make them so over
zealous as members of the B.A.C. that they
should rule all at once on aspects which should
not be part of their consideration.
Correct procedure in the matter would have
been to rule solely as members of the Board.
Then, when the matter was referred to the Fac
ulty Athletics Committee, to rule as members
of that body.
In the present case, it doesn't make any
difference since the outcome would have been
the same anyway, the set-up being what it is.
In the future, however, the consequences
might be of some importance.
If the members of the Board of Athletic Con
trol are going to rule as members of the Faculty
Athletic Committee while they are sitting with
the 8.A.C., their judgments are going to be
tinged with considerations which should not
enter the picture of the Board.
The Board is created to formulate policy for
management of Stanford's athletic set-up. The
Committee has been set up to rule on the aca
demic standing of athletes. The two are not
synonymous.
They shouldn't be.
In the present instance, Board members evi
dently thought they were.
If the Board had acted as the Board last Sun
day and left the decision with the Committee a
great deal of difficulty would have been saved.
In the future, therefore, as athletes stop and
consider, then threaten, let the Board of Athletic
Control stop and consider, remember its juris
diction.
