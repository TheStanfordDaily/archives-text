SO Branner Dining Hall will not be opened
next year.
Stanford, announces the Bulletin of Infor
mation, is a residence University. Yet no fa
cilities are provided to enable men students
who are not members of fraternities or eating
clubs to have their meals with a living group.
Men who have not been invited to join one
of these organizations must eat in the Union
Cellar or in downtown restaurants, a procedure
more expensive and less convivial than gather
ing around a table with 30 or 40 other students.
When the move to reopen Branner Dining
Hall was on the upgrade last winter, it ap
peared that the solution for the problem was
at last on hand. The completely eguipped
kitchen and dining room had been lying vacant
under a coat of dust for nine long years.
A petition was circulated, the Administration
lent its support, and everything pointed to a
reopening at the start of fall guarter.
Then arose that familiar figure on the Farm,
the ogre of the empty purse. The President of

the University, the Dean of Men, and the Comp
troller conferred repeatedly, trying to work out
a satisfactory way to finance the inauguration
of the dining hall.
The budget could not be stretched far enough
to provide the $5000 necessary to put the plant
in shape for serving meals. Furthermore there
was no guarantee that the independents would
patronize the place if it were opened. Past ex
perience was not encouraging.
The University has been forced to forego
lately a number of projects which it realizes as
eminently worth while. The lighting in the
Library is inadeguate. Campus roads are full
of chuck-holes. The Library parking lot needs
to be paved. The faculty still is bearing its five
per cent salary cut. Almost every scientific
department in the University lacks certain
eguipment. The Law School is inadeguately
housed.
It is ever thus. Stanford has no excess funds.
