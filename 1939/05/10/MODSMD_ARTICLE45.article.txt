### JOHN COBBS 
CLOSED SEASON
IT ISN'T often that I really feel sorry for Review Edi
tors; they always go skipping of! to shows while the
rest of the staff struggles with balky Underwoods, and
they usually have that contented look found only in
men who know some underhanded way of apple-pol
ishing Fate. But for the past two weeks, I have watched
Campus Opinion writers sniping at our reviewer, and
I have begun to feel a surprising sympathy for him.
If we can't have a closed season on Review Editors,
we ought at least establish a code of fair hunting
practices.
If I remember correctly, the commotion was started
by some student actors who didn't like The Daily's
comments. The rest of the letter-writers joined in like
neighborhood dogs which start to bark aimlessly when
they hear a yelp somewhere on the block.

AS USUAL, the comments have sorted themselves
out into two classes. There are the student actors
who think they are being sold down the river by the
reviewers' stupidity; and there are the student critics
who don't agree with the reviewer's opinions. Both
classes begin by throwing a bouquet to free speech,
and wind up by suggesting a lynching party.
The best way to dispose of the actors would be by
quoting one of the phrases that little boys chalk on
fences. Stanford's dramatic group has developed a
sensitiveness to criticism that is almost an allergy;
they yell like spoiled children whenever anyone im
plies that they don't turn in better performances than
Booth. If we believe them, every Stanford production
is perfect until The Daily's witch-doctor casts a spell
on it.

The student critics have a stronger case on the
face of it. But they overlook the fundamental fact
that the reviewer has as much right to his opinion as
they have to theirs.
The main object in printing reviews is to give stu
dents some guide that will help them in picking shows
they want to see. The best way to do this is to choose
a man with normal reactions and give him his head.
Readers can set up their own scale of valuation and
make their own appraisals of his comments.

To the best of my knowledge, our reviewer is a
normal human being. He does not believe in voodoo
worship; he does not turn into a black cat at mid
night; he drives a car when he can borrow one and
does not ride a broomstick. He loves his mother,
and he has read the Constitution.
He has opinions, of course. But under our present,
system that is no excuse for wanting to ride him out
of town on a rail.
