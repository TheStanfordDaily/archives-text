...A headline in yesterday's Daily read: "Heaven
Gives Stage Crews New Problems." ....
Yes, I have noticed. Things have been getting
more saintly around here. But I didn't know that Stan
ford was moving into heaven, and I had no idea at
all that the Division of Speech and Drama was think
ing of redesigning the place.
First they will cover a few clouds with mosaic, and
then block off a few chunks of space with chains with
signs on them saying something about the death rate
of female angels killed by fast-flapping wings.
They will find something in heaven which doesn't
mix, and make a law against it. The B.A.C. will
charge admission to choir practice, and the Adminis
tration will put Lucifer on Ihe honor code.
And it won't be long before Gabriel will be re
placed by a big name band.
Before all that happens I'm getting the hell out
of here.

Two Farm girls were looking at Esquire cartoons
in the cellar.
"Gee, it takes you a long time," one said to the
other. "Can't you understand them?" Her manner
was that of one patting a small child on the head.
"I just look at the picture," the other answered her.
"I don't read the caption. I look at the picture and
think of my own caption. It's dirtier that way."

Four guys went to the track meet Saturday. They
gave the attendant four tickets all wadded up, and
hurried on.
The attendant unfolded th ticketsâ€”and found three
track tickets and a ticket which said, "Free ride on
the roller-coaster wtih five cents."
The trick worked. The ticket-taker couldn't find
the irate crasher again.
