"TIIE MAN WHO KILLED
HITLER." Anonymous. Published
by George Palmer Putnam.
When George Palmer Putnam
broke away from the old and re
spectable Putnam Publishing firm
and established a new concern in
Hollywood, his first and smartest
move was to publish the sensational
"Man Who Killed Hitler." Ideal
publicity material, it aroused a stir
that splattered the name across the
nation's headlines.
After sending a eopy to Adolf
Hitler, via the German Embassy in
Washington, with a cleverly worded
note, and receiving a substantial
number of letters of protest, the final
and crowning achievement, from the
publicity man's point of view almost
to good to be true, was the receipt
of a bullet-riddled copy of the book.
Pix of Mr. Putnam holding the bat
tered volume made front pages from
coast to coast.
First of all, it should be under
stood that this is fiction — not the
supposedly factual record that has
lately hit booksellers' racks. There
are two books; this one is purely
fictional.
The idea behind this book is a
good one. It's obviously an attempt
to capitalize on the current European
interest. It was written, I'd say, in
the few weeks following the Ansch
luss—pounded out by a writer who
shows some feeling for words, some
slight sense of significant detail. Its
author is reputedly a former San
Francisco newspaperman. There is
little doubt that he wrote the book
in such haste that he had little time
to revise. Consequently the book
suffers.
Basically, as a literary work, "The
Man Who Killed Plitler" is poor.
Bloody, emotional, it precludes in
telligent evaluation. It's the kind of
a book that may sell a great many
copies, but few intelligent people
will consider it seriously.
"The Man Who Killed Hitler" was
a smart way to launch a new pub
lishing venture —and it may drag in
the dollars—but it's only a few short
steps above the* pulps.—Hutchinson.

Basically, as a literary work, "The
Man Who Killed Plitler" is poor.

"The Man Who Killed Hitler" was
a smart way to launch a new pub

the dollars—but it's only a few short
steps above the* pulps.—Hutchinson.
