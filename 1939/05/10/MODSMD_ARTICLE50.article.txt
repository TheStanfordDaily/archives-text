WORKERS ARISE!

The Editor. Sir:
"Two Student Hashers" called our
attention the other day to facts
which should be known to a greater
number of us; e.g., the pitiful con
dition of workers on the campus.
Professors will pay fine and ideal
istic lip service, in the classroom, to
the cause of underpaid and abused
labor. They will endlessly lecture
on the evil and deplorable results of
sweat-shop conditions in New York.
They will bitterly condemn the
starvation wage conditions prevail
ing in the textile industry in the
Southern states, and their attendant
misery. They will voice their sym
pathy for the oppressed labor of
foreign lands. They are so far en
grossed in labor problems in the ab
stract that they have no time to
notice the shameless exploitation of
labor going on right here on the
campus, where it should be most
obvious.
Most of the dining hall employes
are paid on the basis of $40 per
month, said two Student Hashers.
Yes, but quite often their monthly
check does not even reach this fig
ure. Remember that the dining hall
force is not paid when dining rooms
are closed several weeks per year,
as they are between school quarters
and holiday vacations. What is left
of their meager pay after such en
forced idleness?
Gardeners receive $4 per day, but
the University shamelessly docks
their pay when, on rainy days, they
are unable to work in the field. On
a full-time basis they work five days
a week for $20. If weather conditions
are unfavorable for two days a
week, as they frequently happen to
be in the winter months, they re
ceive consequently a weekly pay
envelope of $15.
Last year, 30 of them were laid off
for two months. One can presume
they were able to support their fam
ilies according to the high Ameri

can standard of living with savings
effected on the high wages they re
ceived in periods of full employ
ment.
Living conditions provided for
those who are lodged on the campus
barely include the main essentials
and a cheerless environment. There
are three swimming pools for men
on the campus but employees are
not allowed in them, nor are they
permitted the use of the gym
nasium.
Big business itself, which has no
reputation for paternalism, has a
much more humane attitude toward
labor than the world's tenth richest
university.
