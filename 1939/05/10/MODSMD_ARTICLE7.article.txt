wirttcn to rock Memorial Hall with
audience laughter, the Ram's Head
show will top all preceding spring
successes, he claimed.
STAGE CREW

Henley has called for technical
workers for the show. A construc
tion crew is needed to build sets;
according to Henley, experience in
construction work is not necessary.
In addition, spots for a pin-rail
boss, make-up, property, and cos
tume crews are to be filled.
A meeling has been called for to
night from 7 to 8 o'clock in the
workshop of Memorial Hall for
those interested in back-stage work.
Those on the technical crews will
recieve points toward Ram's Head
membership, Henley said.
