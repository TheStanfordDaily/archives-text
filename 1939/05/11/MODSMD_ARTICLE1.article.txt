### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
{)NE-FOURTII of Stanford hails
from San Francisco. Twenty
five per cent of the student body
vividly remembers the waterfront
strife which reached its climax in the
summer of 1934 with a city-wide
general strike. Continued long
shoremen's disputes and the activi
ties of Harry Bridges have kept the
memory fresh in its mind.
Anyone who has walked along the
Embarcadero in the foggy grayness
of the early morning to see a group
of union clock workers jump on a
scab and beat him up, anyone who
has seen packing-cases dropped on
a strike-breaker with accidental
purposiveness realizes that trouble
on the waterfront is serious busi
ness.
Today Portland, Ore., is the lo
cale for dock strife, and this
morning at 8 o'clock • the Water
front Employers Association will
close the port to all commerce.
Cause of this latest labor fracas is
the right of longshoremen to pick
et, a privilege upheld by federal
labor laws and denied by those of
Oregon.
When members of the Maritime
Office Employees Union picketed the
freighter, William Luckenbach,
company officials had the court is
sue an injunction against such ac
tion. Claiming their right under fed
eral acts, the workers ignored the
order and were arrested.
Anyone who has completed the
first week of Poli Sci 1 knows that
national laws over-rule those of the
states, but Portland police pinched
the picketers all the same.
* * >1*
was the signal for the In
ternational Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union, so well
known in these parts, to stick in its
oar. Holding out for the federally
guaranteed privilege of the work
ers, the Union announced that the
Luckenbach liner would not be
loaded until the injunction was void
ed. And this turned the incident into
a major controversy.
Firmly the employers published
an ultimatum. If longshoremen did
not report to the freighter in ques
tion by 8 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, the port of Portland was to be
closed. The inevitable came to
pass, and this morning the officials
will make good their threat.
* V #
Hope of preventing a prolonged
waterfront shut-down lies in a last
minute conference between Union
officials and employers called by
Arbiter Samuel Weinstein for this
morning. Ship owners refused to
accede to his plea late last night
to keep the port open, but agreed
to meet labor's representatives to
try to reach a settlement before the
closure damages the city's trade.
San Francisco never has com
pletely recovered from the period
when every ship in the harbor was
tied up, when day after day no
commercial vessel entered the Gold
en Gate. The disaster should have
served as an example for every port
on the Pacific Coast, but some people
have to put their fingers in the fire
to believe that it buiTis.

|N (he East the soft coal strike
rolls into its ninth week with no
solution apparent to the question
of granting a union shop. Meet
ing with mine operators and CIO
representatives in New York,
President Roosevelt demanded
that Ihe 4(50,000 men he put back
(o work as a matter of duty to the
nation.
The halt in the produciton of bi
tuminous coal has already resulted
in the shut-down of transportation
lines and a number of industrial
plants, and it threatens to affect
New York City's vital public utili- i
ties.
Governor A. B. Chandler of Ken- '
tucky yesterday announced that un -
less mines in his state are operat
ing by Monday he will send the
National Guard to protect miners
who desire to return to work.
