# Hitler Acknowledges Letter But Refuses Firehouse Boys
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
When Tom Collins and Hilton Smith sent Adolf Hitler a letter, neither
had the slightest idea that anything would result. But such was not the
case.
Last March 2i» Collins, Smith, and a few of the student fire crew
were discussing the European situation when they spotted a large, two-

map on the wall. The map was
taken from a Fortune magazine sur
vey of the United States Navy,
showing navy yards, air bases, train
ing stations, the number of different
types of ships, and where the ships
were located.
DEAR FUEHRER'
"We were feeling pretty good that
night, so we decided to send the
map to Hitler," Collins said. The
following letter was sent with the
map:
"Fuehrer Hitler
President Reichstag
Berlin, Germany
Dear Sir:
"In our recent discussions at the
| Firehouse in regard to the present
1 political situation in Europe, we
J have come to the conclusion that if
| we were better informed as to the
I relative naval strength of the mem
j bers of this "international poker
game" that there would be more
concrete evidence upon which to
base peace negotiations.
| ENCLOSED FIND'
"The enclosed map is the most
| complete summary of the naval
j power of our nation. We are un
| able to swear to the authenticity of
this report, for authorities might be
holding out a few ships here and
there.
"In return we would greatly ap
preciate a similar report on your
navy.
"Trusting this finds you in the
best, of heallh and with best re
gards from the Firehouse, we re
main "
Surprisingly enough, this letter
! was answered, for several days ago
j the Firehouse received a large
: brown envelope containing the orig
-1 inal map and a letter from "Korvett
| enkapitan" Albrecht, "Adjutant of
: the 'Wehrmacht' by orders of the
; Fuehrer and Reich Chancellery.
HITLER'S ANSWER
i Translated from German the let
ter reads:
i "In reply to your letter of March
26 addressed to the Fuehrer and
Rcichs Chancellor, wc wish to in
form you that such a similar col
lection of plans of the German Navy
does not exist."
"Some of the fellows think they
answered us because it. came from
j Stanford and America," Collins re

I ion is that they wanted to show us
Jup as just blundering American
fools. The letter is subtly sarcastic.
I So, after all, maybe the joke is on
