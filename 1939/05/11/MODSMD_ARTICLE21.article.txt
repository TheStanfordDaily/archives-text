Depicting the fantastic story of
what happens when Napoleon, bored
j with celestial bliss, bets St. Francis
; that he can start a war with a tele
gram, "No More Peace" is a witty
and probing satire on mob psy
i chology. Its author is a German so
| cialist, now in exile.

The play is in two acts and seven
scenes, two of which are in the first
act and five in the second. The
locale shifts from Heaven to Dun
kelstein, a little European country
which i.s the recipient of the fako
telegram. Though the people of the
country do not know just exactly
who sent the telegram declaring war,
they immediately declare war right
back at the aggressor, mobilize, set
up a dictator, and react in the gen
erally accepted manner.
The heavenly contingent Ls headed
by Quentin Warren as the bellicose
Napoleon, Her.schel Griffin as peace
loving St. Francis, Garrett Starmcr
as wise Socrates, and Barbara
Thraher as the utterly feminine An
gel 1100.
COMPLICATED SETS
Concerned principally with the
terrestrial side of things are Bob
Plate as Lot, John Moore as Laban,
and Dan Holtom as Cain the Dicta
tor. Aside from Socrates' attempt at
divine intervention the two groups
never meet.

Drama group's first production in the
big theater since "Tobias and the
Angel." The larger stage will offer
an opportunity for the more com
plicated sets which the play re
quires.
