# Chamberlain Urges Russian Peace Action
## British Head Denies Motive Is to Isolate Russia in War Crisis 
### 
LONDON, May 10 (UP).â€”Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain today,
in a last-minute effort to bring So
viet Russia into Europe's "peace
front," publicly assured Moscow
Great Britain and France have no
sinister intention of involving the
Soviets in a single-handed war |
against Germany.
Chamberlain admitted the Soviets ;
were suspicious of being drawn into J
an anti-aggression alignment in j
which they would be left "holding i
the bag" if Adolf Hitler's armies
should strike eastward to obtain
more territory for the expanding
German Reich.
RUSSIA SUSPICIOUS
Since Great Britain and France
gave guarantees to Poland and Ru
mania promising them military aid
in event of aggression the Russians
have suspected the British might
allow Germany to invade the U.S.
S.R. by way of Latvia, Esthonia,
Finland or Lithuania and then re
frain from giving any aid to Russia.
Chamberlain made it clear in his
House of Commons statement that
Britain does not intend to enter into
a military alliance with the Soviets.
SOVIET REPLY
The Soviets, in a formal announce
ment made in Moscow Tuesday
night replying to Britain's newest
"counter proposals," complained that
Britain refused to give any recipro
cal guarantees for the eventuality of
the Soviet union being drawn into
military operations in fulfillment of
obligations it (the U.S.S.R.) has
undertaken with respect to states of
Eastern Europe.
This referred to Russia's deter
mination to prevent a Nazi blow at
her own borders by lining up the
Baltic states in an anti-aggression
front, including Esthonia, Latvia
and Lithuania.
BALTIC STATES' PACTS
Latvia and Esthonia, according
to German announcements, have
agreed to sign non-aggression pacts
with Hitler, while Lithuania already
has such a mutual pact with the
Reich.
Although Chamberlain in his
statement did not directly mention
the Baltic States he conveyed the
impi'ession a compromise might be
reached whereby the Soviets would
abandon their demands for a mili
tary alliance and Britain and France
would agree to plug the Baltic gap.
EXTEND GUARANTEES
Ihis would be done, supposedly,
by extending the Anglo - French
guarantees already given to Poland
and Rumania to include the small
Baltic nations.
Chamberlain asserted that Mos
cow's communique objecting to the
British counter-proposals "seemed
to be based on some misunderstand
ings of the suggestions actually put
for ward."
