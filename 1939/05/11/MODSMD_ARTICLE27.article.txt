# Relief Question To Be Debated
## S.P.U. to Discuss Problem Tonight 
### 
Debating the question, "Resolved,
I that a two years' residence test be
required of all persons applying for
I government relief in California," the
Political Union will meet for the sec
! ond time this quarter in Room 320
j on the Geology corner at. 7:30 o'clock
; this evening.
! Anticipating a more than average
l debate on the topic of state-wide
interest, party leaders yesterday re
mained silent when questioned on
; the stand they would adopt. It was
| announced, however, that short cau
i cuses would be held before the meet
i ing to build party platforms.
I Tim Hays, head of the Conserva-
I tive contingent; Carl Diesenroth,
i top man in the Liberal party; and
Bob Wood, head of the Laborites,
have not named their speakers of
the evening, but with only two or
three additional debates planned be
fore the close of the quarter, it was
suggested that they would personally
take the floor to consider tonight's
question.
It was also stated that the Union
' may revert to the Yale practice of
j inviting outside speakers by having
i a prominent Bay Region critic at
I one of the meetings in the future.
! This policy was originally put into
I effect when the Union got its start
i on the campus last year, after two
i Stanford debaters had seen the Yale
Union in action, but it was shortly
j abandoned at the request of the ad-
I ministration.
