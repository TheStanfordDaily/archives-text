### 
A special delivery letter from Elsa
Maxwell has inspired the Encina
Forty-Niners for their Barn Dance
Friday night, according to Jess Shen
son, chairman. The theme will be
carried out according to Miss Max
well's suggestions for decorations
and a surprise entertainment.
Jim Mack has obtained replicas
of Old San Francisco store fronts to
line the walls of the lobby. Wagons,
greens and a papier-mache cow are
to gve the entrance a barny atmos
phere.
A punch bar and a billiard room
in the annexes, Encina beards, and
costumes of all sorts will complete
the transformation. Encina will be
canvassed tonight in a ticket-selling
campaign, and tickets will be $1.00.
