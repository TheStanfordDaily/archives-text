# Stanford's 'Five Musketeers' Will Graduate This Quarter
## 
### 
Five scared little boys, wearing knee pants and with hair neatly
smoothed down, were grouped together at the opening day of kindergarten.
That was way back in li>22 at Phoenix, Arizona.
Seventeen years later these same live boys, not so timid, not so little,
and not wearing short pants, are still comrades and are going to graduate

from Stanford together. Bill Har-<
rington, De McLaurin, Jack Laney,
Perry Chisum, and Charles Melczpr
are members of this inseparable
quintet.
During kindergarten the lads
formed their "gang." They played
baseball and basketball together on
the grammar school team. They
even formed a tackle football squad,
with real shoulder pads and every
thing, and played the boys on the
other side of town.
AT ODDS
The only time they differed was
over girls, for it is difficult for five
fellows to like one girl.
After grammar school, the five
went to the same high school and
continued being a "gang." And
when it was time to think of col
lege. there was little difficulty. One
of the boys' sisters had gone to
Stanford, another one's brother was
then at Stanford and the father of a
third one was an alumnus.
Naturally, the other two went with
the majority of the "gang."
together on campus
On the campus, it was impossible
for the paths of the fellows to lead
in the same direction. Nevertheless,
they stayed together as much as
possible. Two joined the same fra
ternity, two live in the same hall,
two have taken the same courses.
With graduation, the "gang" will
reach a parting of the way, for
Laney goes to Norway on a schol
arship, Chisum will enroll in a
technical school in Chicago, Mc-
Laurin will work in Oakland with a
national insurance company, Melc
zer plans to go to business chool,
and Harrington plans to attend the
University of Michigan's law school.
But until that inevitable day of
June 18 the "gang" that has played,
fought, and stood together plans to

hold one last affair toegther. So, if
you see five young men on the Quad
one of these nights singing "Auld
Lang Syne," you'll know that the
"gang" is out for the last time.

smoothed down, were grouped together at the opening day of kindergarten.
That was way back in li>22 at Phoenix, Arizona.
Seventeen years later these same live boys, not so timid, not so little,
and not wearing short pants, are still comrades and are going to graduate

from Stanford together. Bill Har-<
rington, De McLaurin, Jack Laney,
Perry Chisum, and Charles Melczpr
are members of this inseparable
quintet.
During kindergarten the lads
formed their "gang." They played
baseball and basketball together on
the grammar school team. They
even formed a tackle football squad,
with real shoulder pads and every
thing, and played the boys on the
other side of town.
AT ODDS
The only time they differed was
over girls, for it is difficult for five
fellows to like one girl.
After grammar school, the five
went to the same high school and
continued being a "gang." And
when it was time to think of col
lege. there was little difficulty. One
of the boys' sisters had gone to
Stanford, another one's brother was
then at Stanford and the father of a
third one was an alumnus.
Naturally, the other two went with
the majority of the "gang."
together on campus
On the campus, it was impossible
for the paths of the fellows to lead
in the same direction. Nevertheless,
they stayed together as much as
possible. Two joined the same fra
ternity, two live in the same hall,
two have taken the same courses.
With graduation, the "gang" will
reach a parting of the way, for
Laney goes to Norway on a schol
arship, Chisum will enroll in a
technical school in Chicago, Mc-
Laurin will work in Oakland with a
national insurance company, Melc
zer plans to go to business chool,
and Harrington plans to attend the
University of Michigan's law school.
But until that inevitable day of
June 18 the "gang" that has played,
fought, and stood together plans to

hold one last affair toegther. So, if
you see five young men on the Quad
one of these nights singing "Auld
Lang Syne," you'll know that the
"gang" is out for the last time.
