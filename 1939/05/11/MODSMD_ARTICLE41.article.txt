—Peace seems to be what we all
want, and regardless of what im
pression the German government
may give, these people are no more
anxious to fight than we are. Both
countries are filled with a lot of
misconceptions and misinformation.
I'm afraid that may always be.
For instance, many a European
thinks that all Americans are rich.
With two pfennigs in my pocket, I
can deny that. They also think that
we are all crazy, which may be
partly true. There's a story going the
rounds among Americans here about
two of "our boys" who were in Rome
not long ago, and, on the strength of
some things which these people
drink instead of water, decided to
pull some Richard Halliburton stuff.
CRAZY AMERICANS
Having noticed a high wall, which
apparently surrounded some "for
bidden cloister," they decided to
pass over it into the "sacred inte
rior." Behind the wall lay a bank
of heavy bushes. With acrobatic
ease, the larger chap heaved the
other over the wall, and waited sev
eral seconds before he finally heard
the inevitable "dull thud" that
tritely meant that the other was
back to earth.
"Joe, ya' all right?" he called.
"Yea, I'm all right," was the an
swer. "But them ain't bushes, them's
the tops of trees."
They were Stanford men.
When not climbing walls, Ameri
cans do a good job over here. And
particularly can exchange students,
whose studies carry them into daily
contact with other men who some
day may have a lot to do with Amer
ica's relations abroad.

These same students, when back
in America, can help greatly to
clarify the international differences
of opinion through their conversa
tion and writing. Things can be
explained as they really are. I know
that I shall have some very inter
esting stories to tell.
Friendship, not hate, between two
peoples may be an idealistic, but not
impossible, contribution to peace.
Thus, when the Interfraternity
Council sends a man to Europe next
year, it may do more than send a
man to Europe.

HEIDELBERG, Germany, March 3.
—Peace seems to be what we all
want, and regardless of what im
pression the German government
may give, these people are no more
anxious to fight than we are. Both
countries are filled with a lot of
misconceptions and misinformation.
I'm afraid that may always be.
For instance, many a European
thinks that all Americans are rich.
With two pfennigs in my pocket, I
can deny that. They also think that
we are all crazy, which may be
partly true. There's a story going the
rounds among Americans here about
two of "our boys" who were in Rome
not long ago, and, on the strength of
some things which these people
drink instead of water, decided to
pull some Richard Halliburton stuff.
CRAZY AMERICANS
Having noticed a high wall, which
apparently surrounded some "for
bidden cloister," they decided to
pass over it into the "sacred inte
rior." Behind the wall lay a bank
of heavy bushes. With acrobatic
ease, the larger chap heaved the
other over the wall, and waited sev
eral seconds before he finally heard
the inevitable "dull thud" that
tritely meant that the other was
back to earth.
"Joe, ya' all right?" he called.
"Yea, I'm all right," was the an
swer. "But them ain't bushes, them's
the tops of trees."
They were Stanford men.
When not climbing walls, Ameri
cans do a good job over here. And
particularly can exchange students,
whose studies carry them into daily
contact with other men who some
day may have a lot to do with Amer
ica's relations abroad.

These same students, when back
in America, can help greatly to
clarify the international differences
of opinion through their conversa
tion and writing. Things can be
explained as they really are. I know
that I shall have some very inter
esting stories to tell.
Friendship, not hate, between two
peoples may be an idealistic, but not
impossible, contribution to peace.
Thus, when the Interfraternity
Council sends a man to Europe next
year, it may do more than send a
man to Europe.
