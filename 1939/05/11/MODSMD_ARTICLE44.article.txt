# Leonard Talks On Radio Hour
## Progressive School Under Discussion 
### 
"Whereas the traditional school as
sumed that the possession of knowl
edge led to its application, the mod
ern school deals directly with be
havior and builds it out of experi
ence, knowledge, and skills," Dr.
John Paul Leonard remarked in a
talk on the University radio hour
over station KGO last night.
Dr. Leonard, associate professor of
education, spoke on the subject,
"Can We Measure the Results of
the Progressive School?"
He stated the purpose of the pro
gressive school as an attempt to un
derstand the culture in which we
live, to determine adequately the na
ture of the learner, and to design
with boys arid girls types of guided
experience to devlop power to sus
tain democratic values and practices
and to build indiivdual interests and
personalities in . harmony with dis
covered needs and abilities.
The results of an attempted eval
uation of progressive school methods
from an eight-year study of 29 pub
lic and private high schools and 280
colleges and universities were cited
by Dr. Leonard.
"The chief gains," he said, "are in
areas not touched by the traditional
school—in the development of so
cial understandings, desirable dem
ocratic attitudes, improved social
adjustment, ability to evaluate evi
dence critically, and a very much
widened area of interests. If youths

from Ihese schools do as well in the
traditional skills and basic knowl
edge as those of regular schools
and achieve these additional values,
then the success of the progressive
school has been sustained."
