# Jeffrey Romps 9.5 sec. 'Hundred'
## Cardinal Speed-Burner Turns in Fastest Mark In Dink's Twilight Meet 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Five months of tutelage under
Coach Dink Templeton bore fruit
last evening in the twilight of Stan
ford's weekly informal track meet.
Templeton's pupil was none other
than the world's fastest human,
Clyde Jeffrey. For yesterday Clyde
achieved what he and Dink have
been striving for ever since the
sprinter enrolled on the Farm,
namely, a perfect start.
SUCCESS!
The results of Clyde's flashing
start and his natural speed was what
every fan present anticipated, a 9.5
100-yard dash. The series of ex
periments Templeton has been using
on Jeffrey to improve his starts, such
as a return to holes in place of the
conventional blocks, a one-handed
stance for starting, and the idea of
singing for relaxation have finally
succeeded.
A 9.5 century is only one-tenth of
a second from the world's record
held jointly by Jesse Owens and
Frank Wykoff. It's a big step from
a 9.(5 sprinter, Jeffrey's former
status, to one who can do 9.5, but
now that Clyde knows he can start
and doesn't have to depend entirely
on his final burst of speed; the rec
ord books may soon suffer a change.
FASTEST YET
"Jeff" ran against Ray Dean,
Olympic Club dashtnan, and team
mates Stan Hiserman and Dick
Carew. He was two yards ahead of
Dean when the pair crossed the
finish. The race was Ihe fastest cen
tury Clyde has ever run and kept,
intact his record of not having lost
a race this year.
What better setting could Tem
pleton have for producing a world
record holder than that featured
100-yard dash on the Fresno Relays
program, the use of the nation's
fastest track, and the presence of
Jeffrey.
RELAY EXPERIMENT
Several of the other events on
yesterday's track program were in
preparation for the coming relays.
Templeton experimented with a mile
relay team, which included Carew,
Les Johnson, Mushy Girard, and
George Rockwell. This quartet
turned the four laps in the good
time of '5:18.7 against a strong San
Jose team.
The other team, probably Stan
ford's best bet for a victory in a
relay event at Fresno, was the 880-
yard quartet made up of Carew,
Hiserman, Johnson, and Jeffrey.
These four toured the half-mile in
the mighty swift time of 1:28.
RECORD HOLDERS
Hiserman is the sole surviving
member of a Stanford team which
sot the present world's record of
1:25 during the Fresno Relays back
in 1937. The other record holders
are Jimmy Kneubuhl. Ray Malott,
and Jack Weiershauser.
In some of the regular races of
yesterday's meet, Girard beat
plucky Joie McNabb of San Jose in
a close two-mile battle. Barney Fer
guson nipped team-mate Paul Moore
in a 1:58 half-mile, and Bill Hawk
ins won a slow flight of high hurdles
in 15 seconds flat.

as a return to holes in place of the
conventional blocks, a one-handed
stance for starting, and the idea of
singing for relaxation have finally
succeeded.
A 9.5 century is only one-tenth of
a second from the world's record
held jointly by Jesse Owens and
Frank Wykoff. It's a big step from
a 9.(5 sprinter, Jeffrey's former
status, to one who can do 9.5, but
now that Clyde knows he can start
and doesn't have to depend entirely
on his final burst of speed; the rec
ord books may soon suffer a change.
FASTEST YET
"Jeff" ran against Ray Dean,
Olympic Club dashtnan, and team
mates Stan Hiserman and Dick
Carew. He was two yards ahead of
Dean when the pair crossed the
finish. The race was Ihe fastest cen
tury Clyde has ever run and kept,
intact his record of not having lost
a race this year.
What better setting could Tem
pleton have for producing a world
record holder than that featured
100-yard dash on the Fresno Relays
program, the use of the nation's
fastest track, and the presence of
Jeffrey.
RELAY EXPERIMENT
Several of the other events on
yesterday's track program were in
preparation for the coming relays.
Templeton experimented with a mile
relay team, which included Carew,
Les Johnson, Mushy Girard, and
George Rockwell. This quartet
turned the four laps in the good
time of '5:18.7 against a strong San
Jose team.
The other team, probably Stan
ford's best bet for a victory in a
relay event at Fresno, was the 880-
yard quartet made up of Carew,
Hiserman, Johnson, and Jeffrey.
These four toured the half-mile in
the mighty swift time of 1:28.
RECORD HOLDERS
Hiserman is the sole surviving
member of a Stanford team which
sot the present world's record of
1:25 during the Fresno Relays back
in 1937. The other record holders
are Jimmy Kneubuhl. Ray Malott,
and Jack Weiershauser.
In some of the regular races of
yesterday's meet, Girard beat
plucky Joie McNabb of San Jose in
a close two-mile battle. Barney Fer
guson nipped team-mate Paul Moore
in a 1:58 half-mile, and Bill Hawk
ins won a slow flight of high hurdles
in 15 seconds flat.
Five months of tutelage under
Coach Dink Templeton bore fruit
last evening in the twilight of Stan
ford's weekly informal track meet.
Templeton's pupil was none other
than the world's fastest human,
Clyde Jeffrey. For yesterday Clyde
achieved what he and Dink have
been striving for ever since the
sprinter enrolled on the Farm,
namely, a perfect start.
SUCCESS!
The results of Clyde's flashing
start and his natural speed was what
every fan present anticipated, a 9.5
100-yard dash. The series of ex
periments Templeton has been using
on Jeffrey to improve his starts, such
as a return to holes in place of the
conventional blocks, a one-handed
stance for starting, and the idea of
singing for relaxation have finally
succeeded.
