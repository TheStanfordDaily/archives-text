# Seniors, Juniors to Flay Off Interclass Soccer Tourney
## 
### 
For the first time in several years
the finals of the interclass soccer
tournament will be played between
two upperclass teams, as the fresh
men and sophomores were defeated
by the juniors and seniors, respec
tively, yesterday afternoon.
The juniors bested the yearlings,
last year's class winners, in a close
game, winning 2-1. The sophomore
squad was easily whipped by an ace
senior aggregation, by a 3-0 score.
The two winning teams meet this
afternoon at 4:15 o'clock on the
varsity soccer field for the play-off.
"Unless something happens, I think
the juniors will win," Coach Harry
Maloney predicted.
JUNIORS START FAST
In the frosh-junior contest, the
upperclass team started last and
scored a few minutes after the open
ing gun. The juniors tallied again
five minutes later. The freshmen
gained strength in the second half
and scored with five minutes left
to play.
Possible opportunity to tie the
game was lost when Nick Bills tried
for a goal with 10 seconds left to
play, and missed by only several
feet. Lee Champion made the
freshman goal, as did Chris S-ontum
and Bill Edwards for the juniors.
In the soph-senior game, the
fourth year men had complete con
trol from the beginning to the final

! gun. Tricky line play and more ex
j perince carried the seniors to vic
j tory. The sophomores lacked a
I strong forward line and the neces
j sary team work.
Senior scorers were Gunther
j Gerbstead, Ed Gudwill, and How
[ ard Naquin.
