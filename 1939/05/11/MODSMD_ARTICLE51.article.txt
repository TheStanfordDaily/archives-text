### ARCH JENKINS 
WITH ALL the focus we have put
I on local track during the past week, j
! ihe deeds of some of the better cin- !
: Jerpath athletes in other sections ,
| have missed our eye.
Track at U.S.C., California, and
j Stanford is so uniformly good that ;
j we have come to look upon the '
I Golden State Trio as the only bunch ,
jof boys worth mentioning in the
I public print. Maybe we are tops in ;
| ihe long run, but let's give the re.st
| of these United States a fair break. !
Especially deserving of a little j
mention is big "One Man Gang" ;
Hackney, Kansas State's large but
i dull shot-putter. While Stan Arder
| sen and Bill Wohle have been toy- j
ing at insignificant distances like 51 '
| or 52 feet. 4he "Gang" lofttd a put
of 55 feet, 11 inches, last Saturday.
And this negro, Watkins, of Michi- !
gan, is said to be able to hit 54 feet ;
without too much trouble.
Wohle and "Andy" haven't yet
approached any peak, but the cell- j
I ing is rising like the foam on a j
I quickly poured beer.
WE LIKE to think of Clyde Jef- '
I frey as invincible, especially on the
I west Coast, and there isn't a reason 1
| in the world to expect anyone to [
beat him this year. Yet the cold i
Northwest will present a couple of (
white aces in the conference meet i
on April 20 who will really make
big "Jeff" go after those records to |
win.
The best the north country has to j
offer are Jack Emigh of Montana !
and Lee Orr of Washington State, j
Orr has been out of action with an ;
injury and may not be in peak con- |
dition until the NCAA meet in mid- 1
June, but Emigh will do all right.
The Montana streak loped
through a 220 in 20.5 on April
25 in a meet with Eastern Oregon j
Normal. That's only two-tenths I
of a second over the world's rec
ord and it was made almost be- 1
I fore the snow had cleared away
from Cheney, Wash. (Ever heard
of it before?) Emigh has been
knocking on the door for a long
time now. This may be his year to
grab the high honors.
An unknown sprinter from the |
Normal named Vic Carpine had al
ready won a 9.5 hundred. He won't ;
be able to run in the conference
meet, though he is eligible for the
NCAA and other big meets.
❖ * *
Lee Orr, the Coygar ace, is espe
cially fit for the 220. He loses ground ,
in the first 50 yards—something like |
Jeffrey—and then lights out like a {
bat out of hades. The Emigh-Orr- !
Jeffrey duel on a day of sunsilme !
would almost be worth the price of :
a ticket ot Seattle.
Orris likewise no amateur in j
the 100, having been a member of ;
the Canadian Olympic team in 1
1936. In a meet with Idaho last
week, Orr was out of action; yet j
the Cougars swept the event in j
0.8 with Ledford. Pettichord, and ;
Littlejohn. The Washington State j
mile relay team will leave the
Golden State Trio a good ten yards j
behind.
Oh yes, Bill Dale runs the half j
mile in 1:55 and Jack Orr, Lee's big j
brothei'. will be under 48 seconds in j
the quarter mile.

The Montana streak loped
through a 220 in 20.5 on April
25 in a meet with Eastern Oregon j
Normal. That's only two-tenths I
of a second over the world's rec
ord and it was made almost be- 1
I fore the snow had cleared away
from Cheney, Wash. (Ever heard
of it before?) Emigh has been
knocking on the door for a long
time now. This may be his year to
grab the high honors.
An unknown sprinter from the |
Normal named Vic Carpine had al
ready won a 9.5 hundred. He won't ;
be able to run in the conference
meet, though he is eligible for the
NCAA and other big meets.

Lee Orr, the Coygar ace, is espe
cially fit for the 220. He loses ground ,
in the first 50 yards—something like |
Jeffrey—and then lights out like a {
bat out of hades. The Emigh-Orr- !
Jeffrey duel on a day of sunsilme !
would almost be worth the price of :
a ticket ot Seattle.
Orris likewise no amateur in j
the 100, having been a member of ;
the Canadian Olympic team in 1
1936. In a meet with Idaho last
week, Orr was out of action; yet j
the Cougars swept the event in j
0.8 with Ledford. Pettichord, and ;
Littlejohn. The Washington State j
mile relay team will leave the
Golden State Trio a good ten yards j
behind.
Oh yes, Bill Dale runs the half j
mile in 1:55 and Jack Orr, Lee's big j
brothei'. will be under 48 seconds in j
the quarter mile.

I on local track during the past week, j

Track at U.S.C., California, and
j Stanford is so uniformly good that ;
j we have come to look upon the '
I Golden State Trio as the only bunch ,
jof boys worth mentioning in the
I public print. Maybe we are tops in ;
| ihe long run, but let's give the re.st
| of these United States a fair break. !
Especially deserving of a little j
mention is big "One Man Gang" ;
Hackney, Kansas State's large but
i dull shot-putter. While Stan Arder
| sen and Bill Wohle have been toy- j
ing at insignificant distances like 51 '
| or 52 feet. 4he "Gang" lofttd a put
of 55 feet, 11 inches, last Saturday.
And this negro, Watkins, of Michi- !
gan, is said to be able to hit 54 feet ;
without too much trouble.
Wohle and "Andy" haven't yet
approached any peak, but the cell- j
I ing is rising like the foam on a j
I quickly poured beer.
WE LIKE to think of Clyde Jef- '
I frey as invincible, especially on the
I west Coast, and there isn't a reason 1
| in the world to expect anyone to [
beat him this year. Yet the cold i
Northwest will present a couple of (
white aces in the conference meet i
on April 20 who will really make
big "Jeff" go after those records to |
win.
