# Frank Albert Runs Wild, Leads 2nd Stringers To Scrimmage Victory
## 'Tiny's' Regulars Treated Roughly In 3-0 Defeat; Frosh Back Whips Befuddling Southpaw Passes 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
i FnUtkie Albert, sensational halfback triple-threat from last fall's un
defeated freshman squad, passed and kicked the second team to a 3-0
victory over the so-called first team in a scrimmage held on the frosh
(i< Id yesterday afternoon.
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill had planned a routine spring workout for his
1939 varsity squad, hut Albert and his mates kicked over the traces by

marching down field at (ho start oi'<
the session for a field goal and then |
holding a powerful but erratic first!
team scoreless for the remainder of j
the 45-minute practice period.
ALBERT STARTS THINGS
The second team was given the J
ball near midfield to start Ihe scrim- j
mage. Alberts started things with ;
ona of his southpaw heaves to Hugh ,
Gallerneau for a first down with j
yards to spare. Passes to Gallerneau
and Bob Templeton carried the j
white shirted second eleven to the 1
vicinity of the first's 15-yard !
marker.
When the attack was slowed to a i
walk by a hard-charging varsity !
forward wall, Albert dropped back |
to the 23-yard line and split the up- |
rights with a place-kick for the !
only points of the afternoon.
BACKFIELD
Working with Albert in the sec
ond team backfield were Galler
neau. Templeton, and Bob Crane.
The forward wall was made up of
Doug Stahle at center, Ken Robesky j
and Steve Keusseff at guards, Bill 1
Trout and Wink Jones at tackles,
and Fred Meyer and Bill Willard at i
ends.
The first team showed flashes of
power and speed during the work- 1
out, but there was a good deal of |
the usual spring sloppiness present, i
Pete Fay broke off tackle for a 45- l
yard gallop once, and threw a flank
pass to Norm Standlee for another ,
substantial gain.
JOIIANNESSEN STARS
The line looked strong, although
blocking was a bit ragged and the j
timing went completely haywire on !
some plays. "Swecje" Johannessen
showed well at tackle. He broke
through on almost every play, and (
chased Albert all over the back
field, but had a good deal of trouble
catching up with him.
