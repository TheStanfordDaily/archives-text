IN the light of volleys recently leveled at
Cardinals, today's page one announcement
of tryouts for that august body is extremely
interesting.
Opening the list considered for membership
to volunteers is a definite step away from the
undemocratic principles of which Cardinals
has been accused.
A move in the right direction —yes. A guar
antee of democracy—never.
Rally Committee members are selected from
a list of tryoutees, but that the selections have
been made strictly on the basis of experience
and ability never has been apparent.
Last week in Education 134, Student Govern
ment, a Committee member was defending the
method of making appointments. "Of course
we try to select the best men and women avail
able."
"Oh, I guess it was just a coincidence that
one woman from each sorority, two from Lagu
nita, and one from the Union were picked last
year/' a small voice exclaimed. The silence
was eloquent.
Undoubtedly the sign-up system brings to
light a number of men and v/omen who other
wise never would be considered for Cardinals
or Rally Committee membership. How great
an effect it has on final selections is a question.
Self-perpetuating bodies are intrinsically and
unavoidably undemocratic. Interviewing vol
untary tryoutees deadens the pain, but it does
not strike at the root of the disease.
As long as Cardinals chooses more Cardinals,
Stanford is bowing to the divine right of kings.
