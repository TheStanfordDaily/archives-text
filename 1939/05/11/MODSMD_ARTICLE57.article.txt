ENTIRELY foreign to most Stanford students
is the type of summer vacation that was
planned last night by a small group that met in
the Women's Clubhouse.
It was the "summer plans" meeting spon
sored by the Stanford Y.W.C.A., and three so
cial workers told students about opportunities
to attend work camps, an international relations
institute, and a "social service laboratory."
Some of the students who attended that
meeting, to take an example, will spend ten
weeks this summer living in a migrant labor
camp near Bakersfield. About 30 students in
all will be living there, working with a dual
objective—to undertake some project for raising
the standard of living among the workers (in
this case, to build a community meeting hall),
and to engage in first-hand study of a social
problem.
And then there are other students who will
help organize "mobile units" of agricultural
workers, thereby to cope with a situation in
which 50 per cent of the state's agricultural
workers migrate where 25 per cent could handle
the seasonal work.
Included in each of these units will be a
trailer clinic, and tent-floors, plumbing facilities,
and an electric system that can be packed into
trailers for transportation from one agricultural
district to the next.
Of course there isn't a spectacular percentage
of Stanford's student body that will take part
in this first-hand social science this summer.
But those who do will get beyond the limits
inherent in social science texts. They will find
themselves immersed in the class struggle long
enough to get an unforgettable insight into the
worker's attitude. They will get an idea of the
scope and potentialities of the social sciences,
which they have so long considered Stanford's
pipe major.—R. D.
