# Fun Is Fun

THEY won the debate, but they backed down.
Last night, all Stanford sat waiting the re
sults of the Roble-Encina debate. Here, said the
women, was to be the final and complete eman
cipation.
Here, said the men, is a chance to save a dime
or two.
With such arguments as "Chivalry is out of
date!" the Roble women tricked their way to
victory.
With "Well, it was all in fun," they tricked
their way to a double victory.
What is this anyway, double talk?
Since when do the Roble women think they
can get away with that sort of thing? Do they
think they can have their coke and drink it too?

If the Encina class of '42 is as good as it says
it is, it'll turn to Castilleja and Paly High School
for its dates and teach the women behind the
ivy-covered walls a good lesson for a change.
With the quip on "chivalry" and men as a
starting point, it might be well to point to the
emancipation of womanhood and the assump
tion thereby of a certain amount of "chivalry"
on the women's part, and then contrast it with
last night's fiasco.
The Roble women professed to desire equal
ity. It appears that all they wanted was the
last word.
For a good many years, Stanford was known
as a marriage market. The freshman women
are certainly starting off on the wrong foot.
It is obvious, however, that they won't have
to pick up the technique of married life by the
trial and error method. They seem to be well
versed in how to win an argument for good and
for all and to their complete satisfaction.
Encinamen —instead of resenting it, probably
liked it — and will probably be chivalrous
enough to continue to buzz through the Roble
switchboard.
It would serve the women right, however,
if the men would make them stand by the deci
sion of the judges, take President McCune's
remark about "the whole thing being in fun"
as fun.
