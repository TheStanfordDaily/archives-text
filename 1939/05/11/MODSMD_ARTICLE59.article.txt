NO APIION STRINGS ATTACHED
STANFORD, we are often told, is essentially provin
cial. Usually I shove this idea into a back closet
of my mind and pay no attention to it. But after
watching the recent assaults on our off-campus dance
policies, I am beginning to wonder.
The problem is still unsettled, and the commotion
that attends the birth of a committee report makes
judgment difficult. There are one or two facts, though,
that can be sorted out of the liter. A sub-committee
of Excom recommended at the last meeting that more
restrictions be placed on off-campus dances; and it
managed to give the impression that any organization
sponsoring a party in the city has made Mepisto an ex
officio member. At the same time it was announced
that "a voluntary committee opposing off-campus
dances will report . . . next week.'
f have no particular objection to the suggested
restrictions, and if a voluntary committee wants to
amuse itself investigating dances, I don't grudge them
their entertainment. But it distresses me to see Stan
ford working on the idea that anything held beyond
the gates at Palm Drive is tainted with evil.
The University does not need any more control
over off-campus functions. It already has the ' con
duct unbecoming" rule, which gives it everything but
extradition rights. If any particular dance reflects on
the Stanford reputation, the University has the power
of summary court-martial.
:Jc * # *
\ ND there is no objection to dances simply as dances.
The reason for sniping at off-campus functions
lies in a vague feeling that the outside world is some
how corrupting, that we cannot enter it without becom
ing polluted.
This idea crops up regularly in the arguments pre
sented. It is assumed by various committees that
going away from the campus involves immorality of
one sort or another. They won't believe that we can
go up to the city and return without exposing our
souls to contamination.
>J: At $ $
The trouble with this reasoning is that we have
some four years at Stanford, while we have 60-odd
in the outside world. We came from the world, and
we will go back into it. If we risk damnation every
time we venture outside the gates, the law of aver
ages says that we had reservations in hell before we
ever came to Stanford.
Nine thousand acres of campus give us room enough
to be comfortable, but with society organized the
way it is now, we won't spend our lives here. If we
can't come into contact with the outside world without
being poisoned, we might as well be written off at
once.

The trouble with this reasoning is that we have
some four years at Stanford, while we have 60-odd
in the outside world. We came from the world, and
we will go back into it. If we risk damnation every
time we venture outside the gates, the law of aver
ages says that we had reservations in hell before we
ever came to Stanford.
Nine thousand acres of campus give us room enough
to be comfortable, but with society organized the
way it is now, we won't spend our lives here. If we
can't come into contact with the outside world without
being poisoned, we might as well be written off at
once.
NO APIION STRINGS ATTACHED
STANFORD, we are often told, is essentially provin
cial. Usually I shove this idea into a back closet
of my mind and pay no attention to it. But after
watching the recent assaults on our off-campus dance
policies, I am beginning to wonder.
The problem is still unsettled, and the commotion
that attends the birth of a committee report makes
judgment difficult. There are one or two facts, though,
that can be sorted out of the liter. A sub-committee
of Excom recommended at the last meeting that more
restrictions be placed on off-campus dances; and it
managed to give the impression that any organization
sponsoring a party in the city has made Mepisto an ex
officio member. At the same time it was announced
that "a voluntary committee opposing off-campus
dances will report . . . next week.'
f have no particular objection to the suggested
restrictions, and if a voluntary committee wants to
amuse itself investigating dances, I don't grudge them
their entertainment. But it distresses me to see Stan
ford working on the idea that anything held beyond
the gates at Palm Drive is tainted with evil.
The University does not need any more control
over off-campus functions. It already has the ' con
duct unbecoming" rule, which gives it everything but
extradition rights. If any particular dance reflects on
the Stanford reputation, the University has the power
of summary court-martial.
:Jc * # *
\ ND there is no objection to dances simply as dances.
The reason for sniping at off-campus functions
lies in a vague feeling that the outside world is some
how corrupting, that we cannot enter it without becom
ing polluted.
This idea crops up regularly in the arguments pre
sented. It is assumed by various committees that
going away from the campus involves immorality of
one sort or another. They won't believe that we can
go up to the city and return without exposing our
souls to contamination.
