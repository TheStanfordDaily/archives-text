### DOUG JAQUES 
MOMENTS LIKE THAT

He was home for the week-end. Saturday night..
It was going to be a big night. He could feel it. It
had to be.
He got a date. Tonight's the night, he said.
But he soon saw it wasn't going right. It was the
girl. It was him. It was something. The night, his big
night, was going to pot. No one was having any fun.
He took her home early-*-but that wasn't going to
ruin his Saturday night home. He got another girl.
Home is like that, he said. If your first date turns
out no good, you can get another one. Boom.
The second one was going fine. It was still fine
when they went in to .net the soda.
They were sitting at a table guzzling whenâ€”the
mother of the first girl came in and saw them.
"Hello, D ," she had started to say hello to her
daughter, to the girl she thought was her daughter.
Yes, his Saturday night home was ruined.

DRUNK

To some people this slorv may seem beautifully
sentimental and appealingly tragic. That is no way to
look at it. It's about a young man, rather a pretty
looking man with curly hair and good features.
He went up to the bar, and with him were a man
and a woman.
"Henry!" he called to the barkeep. "Henry!" Then
in lowered tones he asked a waiter, "Is his name
Henry?"
The waiter told him the barkeep's name.
"Why inja tell me b'fore?" the young man said,
and called again to the bartender, this time by the
right name.
When the barkeep came over, he said, "My wife
just had a baby. Half hour ago, my wife had a baby.
Give my friends a drink."
Droopily he watched his friends drink. It was ten
minutes later that he called, "Henry! Fix me a drink."
"What would you like?"'
"Whiskey."
"Scotch and soda?"
"I detest .scotch."
"Bourbon and soda?"
"I detest bourbon. Never drink it."
"Old fashion?"
"Detest it. You fix me something. I was a tee
totaler until 20 minutes ago."
