BLAST AT COLUMNIST

Dear Johnny Cobbs:
Although a lot of your Bull Se.s- j
sioning shows you to be just an old |
bourgeois * %*, in a lot more of I
it you have displayed a pretty well |
balanced head. But in your column j
yesterday you were again just an [
old bourgeois &c" c '<! *.
Dan Holtom's Campus Opinion on I
The Daily review of "The Shoemak- j
er's Holiday," to mention one of the |
two that were printed, was not writ- j
ten by one who "has developed a I
sensitiveness to criticism that is al- I
most an allergy."
INTELLIGENT CRITICISM
Holtom, as a perusal of his letter
will clearly show, was only pleading
for intelligent criticism of the drama
productions here, a criticism which
must necessarily be based on a j
knowledge of the subject. More- i
over, Holtom, wlio waited until the !
run of the show was over before he|
wrote his letter, was not a member
of the cast. As assistant director for
the production he had plenty of op
portunity for watching proceedings |
from out front, and for checking j
audience reaction.
LEANS BACKWARD
Now while the Daily review was!
written with painstaking honesty and ,
with every indication of leaning j
backward to give the show a break,!
this honesty and leaning backward:
were unfortunately useless, because'
here was also every indication that j
the reviewers had not the slightest j
real knowledge of the theater lore
and esthetics.
And such a knowledge is very im
portant. You see, Johnny, many of .
the kids in the theater here are not
indulging in the game for the sake |
of a dilettante recreation, and they ,
want more than their names in cam
pus publications. Since they expect
to follow the theater as a profession,
a casual resume of a production is
of no value to them. Therefore, a
reviewer ignorant; of theater technic)
i is a drag on the line.
REASON FOR REVIEWS
You say that "the main object in
| printing reviews is to give students
| some guide that will help them in
; picking shows they want to see."
That's fine as far as it goes, but de
j spite the people around here who'd
j like to see that three quarters of a
million dollar plant turned into a
! lecture hall, some have a strong feel
' ing that the plant should house a
school of the drama.

And if there is to be such a school
here, we must have competent dra
matic criticism. In the light of this
statement, a so-called critic who
does not know his theater appears as
.silly as I would if I undertook to
judge an exhibit of cubistic art, for
which I have some intellectual ap
preciation, but no real emotion.
DRAMA ART
Don't forget that the drama is in
art form, and must be judged ac
cordingly by certain standards,
which while flexible are neverthe
less there. Which means that the re
viewer, while remaining a member
of the audience, must also see a pro
duction as befits a critic of a form
of art. I hope I will not be termed
too impractically visionary if I sug
gest that all campus reviewers gain
some acquaintance with ihe theater
before they attempt to evaluate a
production.
By the way. Johnny, you old bour
geois â€¢s!*&, how about a contribu
tion for the June Chappie?
