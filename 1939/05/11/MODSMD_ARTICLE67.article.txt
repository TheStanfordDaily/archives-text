NEW DELHI, India, May 10 (UP).
â€”A Moslem named Bhadu Fakir,
who died at the age of 132 in the
village of Philipnegar, near Kustea,
was believed to be the oldest man
in India. Bhadu Fakir retained all
his teeth and was in full possession
of his faculties until his last illness.

S. D. Lee proved conclusively that
a one-legged athlete can be a good
track man when he hopped 100 yards
in 11 seconds.
