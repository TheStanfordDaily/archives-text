# Vocom Aids In Evaluating Professions

(This is the first of a series to
be written to clarify the objec
tives of the Vocational Student
Committee and to explain the op
portunities it offers students as
yet undecided on a vocation.—Ed
itor's Note)

In these days when all a college
student hears about the professions
is that they are overcrowded and
underpaid, the problem which
looms blackest on his horizon is that
of vocation.
It does seem that no matter which
occupational channel a student lets
his mind wander into he meets dis
couragement some place along the
line in the form of lack of qualifi
cations, academic or otherwise,
discovery of crowded conditions in
the field and other disagreeable
revelations concerning either the
profession or himself in relation to
it.
REVIVED :} YEARS AGO
Observing that this situation was
becoming acute as it pertained to
the women in Stanford, Miss Yost
revived the vocational committee
idea here three years ago. The com
mittee functioned not so much as a
guidance unit as one organized to
make vocational material available
to students.
Although the original committee
did not continue its work, the pres
ent, newly organized group, under
the leadership of Gretchen Gillespie,
chairman, has outlined its work with
a similar objective in mind.
UPPER DIVISION WOMEN
Basing its present work on a sur
vey made last fall of the vocational
inclinations of upper division women
in the University, the Committee
meets once a week to consider
speakers and meetings which will
serve to inform and educate inter
ested women on the campus. The
survey revealed that the first choices
among women on the campus were:
work in personnel, social, education,
and business. This simple knowl
edge has been extended through
much work compiling pamphlets,
vocational books and other litera
ture.
The material is available at all
times to women students and can
be taken from Miss Anastasia
Doyle's office at any time. This phase
of the committee's work is conduct
ed like a lending library.
