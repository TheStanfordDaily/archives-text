# Roble Wins 50-50 Dates; Backs Down
## First Frosh Debate Ends in Triumph For Dutch Dates 
### 
Winning a debate, the provisions
of which, if adopted, would prove
revolutionary to life on the Farm,
three Roble women last night con
vinced the judges and most men
present that Roble women should
pay for dates on a 50-50 basis.
But as usual, the women exercised
their time-worn prerogative and
changed their mind. Immediately
after the decision, Mary Helen Mc-
Cune, Roble president, backed down
and stated that "the whole thing
was all in fun," and that they didn't
want the fellows to take their argu
ments too seriously.
50-50 ARGUMENTS
To a packed Roble lobby Margery
Gunn, Marjorie Williams, and Helen
Severance presented an overwhelm
ing array of arguments for their
point that Roble women should go
50-50 on dates.
Some of the women's outstanding
points were that they would thereby
get more dates and not have to sit
at home so much; that dates would
be better and there would be less
Half Moon Bay sand-in-the-food
affairs; and that the fellows would
look more handsome because they
would have more money to spend
on clothes, etc.
TRADITION UPHELD
The points presented by the En
cinamen, Robert Hammett, Bob
McNeil, and Roger Boas relied in
the main on the tradition theme, and
that it was scientifically anti-social
to have women paying for dates.
They also stated that the men do not
have the numerous "boudoir ex
penses" that are necessary for the
women.
Some of the questions asked by
the men were "Do we want Roble
ites to be known as Pacific Coast
Amazons?", "Do we want love to
be put on a monetary basis?" and
"Have you ever seen a good woman
one-arm driver?"
NEGATIVE POINTS
The women refuted negative points
with such arguments as "Chivalry
is out of date," "There is equality
in everything else; why shouldn't, we
have social equality?" and "Many
Encinamen work their way through
school, so why shouldn't? we enable
them to have more dates than they
now have?"
Judges of the debate were Dr. Le
land Chapin, head debate coach,
Miss Louise Linton, of the Division
of Spech and Drama, and George
Knoles of the history department.
