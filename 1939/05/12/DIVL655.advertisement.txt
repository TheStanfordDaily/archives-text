JL)i(J you know llial radio broadcasting station* from
coast to coast are linked by more than 53,000 miles
of special telephone circuits?
Even before the earliest days of broadcasting,
Bell System engineers developed means of trans
mitting sounds of all kinds by wire. These have
been improved constantly to transmit the extremely
high and low sound frequencies of music and
entertainment.
Just as years of telephone research stand back
of today's special broadcasting circuits — so the
research of today is helping to solve the communi*
cations problems of tomorrow. Another Bell System
contribution to your daily life.
