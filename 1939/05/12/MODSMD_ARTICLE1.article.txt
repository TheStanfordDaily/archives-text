### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
r ITHUMBING through the news dis
patched from which this column
is culled is diabolically tempting to
night. That story about the 24 Penn
sylvanians who are suspected of
murdering 200 people for their in
surance, or the one concerning the
complications in the love life of John
Barrymore and Elaine Barrie would
provide a highly diverting evening.
When history is being made at
break-neck speed in Europe every
hour of every day, events once
sharply etched in black and white
begin to turn a little dull and gray.
If, one year ago today, we had read
that England had threatened to de
clare war on Hitler if he seized Dan
zig, we would have sputtered over
our coffee and whispered about it
in our eight-o'clocks.
But it happened yesterday in
stead of a year ago, and to most
of Stanford it will be more of the
same old stuff. Since the first
breathless scare of the Munich
crisis, we have learned to sit back
and accept the news from Europe
much as we do the scores of the
major league baseball games.

W/lIAT makes Prime Minister
Chamberlain's declaration im
portant to international observers is
that it marks the end of all chances
that Britain may return to the pol
icy of appeasement. Ever since the
September settlement the govern
ment has been oscillating between a
firm anti-fascist policy and trying
to persuade the dictators to behave.
Yesterday he threatened to attack
the Nazis if they try to seize Danzig
or to invade Poland, and this time
we can be reasonably sure he meant
what he said.
When he stated his belief that
neither the English nor the Ger
man people really want war. his
words rang most true. A bit iron
ic. this statement. For it is the
propaganda of speech and press
and the policies of leaders like
Mr. Chamberlain that create wars
and make men light.

I | NFORTUNATELY for both the
democratic allies and the Rome-
Berlin axis, the Union of Socialist
Soviet Republics is not the innocent
child they thought it was. Realizing
the might of the Red Army, the na
tions of western Europe always con
sidered Russia as an infant Hercu
les, strong but still susceptible to
guile.
During the past week they have
learned that the Soviet has no in
tention of being the tool for the
diplomatic machinations of either
party. When Britain refused to ac
cede to its demand for a three-way
treaty of mutual aid with France
included, Moscow hinted that, it
might consider lining up with the
dictators.
As a matter of fact ideologically
the U.S.S.R. has little in common
with either the democratic or the
totalitarian states. Stalin is out
to guard his own interests, and the
road that offers protection to Rus
sia is the road he will take.
By abstaining from alliances with
either side, he has placed himself
in a position to dictate to them
both. The Soviet chief has ordered
that the problem of Danzig must not
be settled by the League of Nations
when it meets next Monday. Not
until Vice Foreign Commissar
Potemkin arrives in Geneva is the
future of the Free City to be de
cided.
According to the Treaty of Ver
sailles, the League is the guardian
of Danzig, and it holds the power to
decide whether it should be turned
over to Germany or to Poland or
whether its fate should be sealed by
a plebiscite.
With democrats and dictators lin
ed up at even odds, it seems that
Russia can tip the scales either way
it wants.
Meanwhile every army in Eu
rope is getting ready for the big
day. As he opened the French
Parliament yesterday, Premier
Daladier shouted across the Ger
man and Italian borders word that
lie will mobilize a million more
men if the absolutist armies do not
stop multiplying.
