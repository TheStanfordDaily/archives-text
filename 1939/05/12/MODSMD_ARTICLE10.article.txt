not to submit to the dictators."

his own Conservative party at a

DALADIER SPEAKS
The Prime Minister dropped a
hint that it is doubtful whether the
German people would have any en
thusiasm for fallowing Hitler into a
war against Great Britain.
The Prime Minister's warning that
Britain will go to war over Danzig,
strongest statement on the subject
thus far, was believed to constitute
an attempt, to stamp out spreading
suspicion that he is flirting with the
idea of reviving his "appeasement"
policy.

Chamberlain's speech, in effect a
warning to the dictators "not to
stai*t anything" because Britain's
strength is on a fighting basis, was
echoed across the English Channel
in a speech by Premier Edouard
Daladier before the French Cham
ber of Deputies.
Daladier, like Chamberlain, warn
ed the dictators, that "if peace is
wrecked the weight of our arms
will be felt."
Chamberlain rebuked Hitler for
the latter's unilateral denunciation
of the 1935 Anglo-German naval
treaty in his April 26 Reichstag
speech and asserted that the basic
reason for the treaty had not been
removed.
His statement was regarded as a
warning to Germany that, if Hitler
wants to start a naval race, he is
hopelessly outclassed.
Discussing the Anglo-German
naval treaty, he said:
"I hold now as I have always
held, that the Anglo-German naval
treaty could properly be regarded as
a symbolic desire of our two peoples
never to go to war with one another
again."

meeting in Albert Hall that Britain,
with France at her side, is irrevo
cably determined to fight, if Fuehrer
Adolf Hitler uses force to carry out
his demands for restoration of Dan
zig to the Reich or threatens Polish
independence.
DALADIER SPEAKS
The Prime Minister dropped a
hint that it is doubtful whether the
German people would have any en
thusiasm for fallowing Hitler into a
war against Great Britain.
The Prime Minister's warning that
Britain will go to war over Danzig,
strongest statement on the subject
thus far, was believed to constitute
an attempt, to stamp out spreading
suspicion that he is flirting with the
idea of reviving his "appeasement"
policy.
REBUKES HITLER
Chamberlain's speech, in effect a
warning to the dictators "not to
stai*t anything" because Britain's
strength is on a fighting basis, was
echoed across the English Channel
in a speech by Premier Edouard
Daladier before the French Cham
ber of Deputies.
Daladier, like Chamberlain, warn
ed the dictators, that "if peace is
wrecked the weight of our arms
will be felt."
Chamberlain rebuked Hitler for
the latter's unilateral denunciation
of the 1935 Anglo-German naval
treaty in his April 26 Reichstag
speech and asserted that the basic
reason for the treaty had not been
removed.
His statement was regarded as a
warning to Germany that, if Hitler
wants to start a naval race, he is
hopelessly outclassed.
Discussing the Anglo-German
naval treaty, he said:
"I hold now as I have always
held, that the Anglo-German naval
treaty could properly be regarded as
a symbolic desire of our two peoples
never to go to war with one another
again."
