# Quad Records indicate Sellout
## 
### 
With comparative figures from
last year's Quad records indicating
that a near sell-out may be reached
by the May 22 release date, Man
ager Margaret Hale urged that, or
ders for the 1939 Quad be placed
within the next, five days.
Sales will continue at the Post
Office, A.S.S.U., and Quad offices
until the release date or until the
Quads are sold out. A second vc
lease date for name-on-cover books
purchased after the initial deadline
for such sales last week has been set
for May 30.
Quads may be purchased for $5.07,
or with name on cover for $6.17.
