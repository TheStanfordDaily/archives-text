# FOUR MODEL T's SERVE FARM 20 YEARS
## 
### 
Four Stanford old-timers.
A quartet who were campus
j "queens" in the old days when the
I Farm was in the horse-and-buggy
| age, and a street-cleaner was «in in
, dispensable official on the campus.
They came in when the horse, and
! the old - fashioned street - cleaner,
: went out. Four model T fords, vin
i tage ranging from 1921 on up, which
! have seen undergrads come and go,
I but which apparently go on forever.
Twenty years ago —the war was
i barely over, prosperity was just
' around the corner, and Stanford was
feeling mighty proud of its snappy
! horse-drawn carriages and kept a
1 stable of over 50 horses to help do
! the heavy work on the grounds.
Then came the age of the auto
mobile. Stanford held an auction,
! sold every horse, and proudly mo
torized itself. Included in the equip
ment that was bought were several
1 model Ts.
In 1921 a young man named Nels
! Palmer drove a model T for the
i Corporation Yard. Today he is still
driving—at the wheel of the same
j Ford.
The mileage meter shows the car
! has run 84,305 miles, but Nels says

something's been wrong with the
meter lately and it chalks up only
six miles when he runs about
twenty.
Twenty miles an hour is top speed,
but Nels admits he holds it down to
13 or 14. He has to drive by guess
work. because (he speedometer
hasn't been in top shape for quite a
while.
Four of the ancient Fords are still
on deck in their Corp Yard garages.
The cream of the lot is a '24 model,

with one '23 and two '21's tagging
along.
Last year those four cars ran up
a total of 10,500 miles on their cam
pus rounds as a maintenance and
clean-up fleet. They seldom go off
campus, occasional trips to Paly and
Redwood city generally mean a trip
to the repair shop.
They're the last of the old guard,
and even they may be scrapped
soon. But thei"e's life in the old boys
yet.

Redwood city generally mean a trip

They're the last of the old guard,

yet.
Four Stanford old-timers.
A quartet who were campus
j "queens" in the old days when the
I Farm was in the horse-and-buggy
| age, and a street-cleaner was «in in
, dispensable official on the campus.
They came in when the horse, and
! the old - fashioned street - cleaner,
: went out. Four model T fords, vin
i tage ranging from 1921 on up, which
! have seen undergrads come and go,
I but which apparently go on forever.
Twenty years ago —the war was
i barely over, prosperity was just
' around the corner, and Stanford was
feeling mighty proud of its snappy
! horse-drawn carriages and kept a
1 stable of over 50 horses to help do
! the heavy work on the grounds.
Then came the age of the auto
mobile. Stanford held an auction,
! sold every horse, and proudly mo
torized itself. Included in the equip
ment that was bought were several
1 model Ts.
In 1921 a young man named Nels
! Palmer drove a model T for the
i Corporation Yard. Today he is still
driving—at the wheel of the same
j Ford.
The mileage meter shows the car
! has run 84,305 miles, but Nels says

something's been wrong with the
meter lately and it chalks up only
six miles when he runs about
twenty.
Twenty miles an hour is top speed,
but Nels admits he holds it down to
13 or 14. He has to drive by guess
work. because (he speedometer
hasn't been in top shape for quite a
while.
Four of the ancient Fords are still
on deck in their Corp Yard garages.
The cream of the lot is a '24 model,

with one '23 and two '21's tagging
along.
Last year those four cars ran up
a total of 10,500 miles on their cam
pus rounds as a maintenance and
clean-up fleet. They seldom go off
campus, occasional trips to Paly and
Redwood city generally mean a trip
to the repair shop.
