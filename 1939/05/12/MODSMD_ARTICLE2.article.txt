# Biting Satire, Brilliant Sets Make Toller Play Worthwhile
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
A biting satire that cut with sharp
precision through the whole question
of war and peace was Ernst Toller's
"No More Peace," opening a three
night run in Memorial Hall audito
rium last night before an audience
of 300.
Against settings that were artisti
cally superb, the action moved with
strength and mature dignity, height
ened with overtones in deep
throated humor. Directed by Wal
demar Johansen, who stepped from
technical production to straight di
rection, "No More Peace" stars
Qucntin Warren, Herschel Griffin,
Barbara Thrasher, Garrett Starmer,
Dan Holtom, Mprle Meacham, and a
uniformly excellent supporting
group.
MODERN LINES
Technical Director William Bas
sctt turned out magnificent settings
—ranging from Mount Olympus,
pitched in variations of blue and
purple with shifting cloud back
grounds, to scenes in mythical Dun
kelstein, modern in simplicity of line
and color combination.
Portraying Napoleon with wings,
Qucntin Warren was forceful,
twisted each Toller phrase so that
its full meanng stood clear and un
mistakable. Dan Holtom, with sleek
hair and toothbrush mustache, gut
turally played the part of wartime
Dictator Cain, former hairdresser,
with assurance and strength.
THRASHER AMUSING
As Angel 1100, celestial stenogra
pher who bartered the outcome of
the gods' joke for a new pair of
Parisian wings, Barbara Thrasher
was amusing at all times. Herschel
Griffin's St. Francis was one of the
weaker characterizations of the eve
ning's generally strong production.
Merle Meacham, in tattered garb
and white beard, lightened scenes
with his pointed wit as Noah, "an
unemployed worker." The sequence
with Mcacham and Garret Starmer,
playing Socrates, was one of the
highlights of the production.
CEFARATTI GOOD
Übiquitous and servile, Samuel, a
commissionaire of the Graustarkian
kingdom, was handled ably by Tony
Cefaratti. Mildred Green turned in a
smooth, studied performance as Ra
chel, the capitalist's daughter. Her
father, Laban, was played with ma
turity and grace by John Moore, as
suming his first leading role.
Norman Sloanc, Bob Walters, and
Fred Rogers, playing stooge finan
ciers, were especially effective in
their group appearance before the
curtain. Adolfo Arias was a sympa
ethetic romantic lead opposite Miss
Green.
The modern satirical comedy will
continue in Memorial Hall tonight
and tomorrow night.

turally played the part of wartime
Dictator Cain, former hairdresser,
with assurance and strength.
THRASHER AMUSING
As Angel 1100, celestial stenogra
pher who bartered the outcome of
the gods' joke for a new pair of
Parisian wings, Barbara Thrasher
was amusing at all times. Herschel
Griffin's St. Francis was one of the
weaker characterizations of the eve
ning's generally strong production.
Merle Meacham, in tattered garb
and white beard, lightened scenes
with his pointed wit as Noah, "an
unemployed worker." The sequence
with Mcacham and Garret Starmer,
playing Socrates, was one of the
highlights of the production.
CEFARATTI GOOD
Übiquitous and servile, Samuel, a
commissionaire of the Graustarkian
kingdom, was handled ably by Tony
Cefaratti. Mildred Green turned in a
smooth, studied performance as Ra
chel, the capitalist's daughter. Her
father, Laban, was played with ma
turity and grace by John Moore, as
suming his first leading role.
Norman Sloanc, Bob Walters, and
Fred Rogers, playing stooge finan
ciers, were especially effective in
their group appearance before the
curtain. Adolfo Arias was a sympa
ethetic romantic lead opposite Miss
Green.
The modern satirical comedy will
continue in Memorial Hall tonight
and tomorrow night.
A biting satire that cut with sharp
precision through the whole question
of war and peace was Ernst Toller's
"No More Peace," opening a three
night run in Memorial Hall audito
rium last night before an audience
of 300.
Against settings that were artisti
cally superb, the action moved with
strength and mature dignity, height
ened with overtones in deep
throated humor. Directed by Wal
demar Johansen, who stepped from
technical production to straight di
rection, "No More Peace" stars
Qucntin Warren, Herschel Griffin,
Barbara Thrasher, Garrett Starmer,
Dan Holtom, Mprle Meacham, and a
uniformly excellent supporting
group.
MODERN LINES
Technical Director William Bas
sctt turned out magnificent settings
—ranging from Mount Olympus,
pitched in variations of blue and
purple with shifting cloud back
grounds, to scenes in mythical Dun
kelstein, modern in simplicity of line
and color combination.
Portraying Napoleon with wings,
Qucntin Warren was forceful,
twisted each Toller phrase so that
its full meanng stood clear and un
mistakable. Dan Holtom, with sleek
hair and toothbrush mustache, gut
turally played the part of wartime
Dictator Cain, former hairdresser,
with assurance and strength.
