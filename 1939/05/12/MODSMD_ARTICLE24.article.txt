## 'Make Life' Keynote Of Campaign to Put Stanford in News 
### 
With casts and technical crewsj
working through their puces in i
preparation lor the Spring Show!
opening on May 26, publicity direc- I
tors were launching a campaign to !
cl ash into Life and Stage muga- i
zincs, and into the San Francisco j
Chronicle rotogravure section.
Handled by Jack Dawson, the,
"Make Life" campaign has con- i
sisted of sending daily letters to the i
magazine editors, containing infor- i
mation concernng the Spring Show,,
and attempting to arrange for Life [
coverage on performance nights.
SPECIAL ST A TIO NEK Y
Encouraged by Life's mention of I
Stanford Ham's Head (then called'
Stagers) several months ago in con- j
neclion with a series of photographs'
of an Eastern musical show, Daw- :
son has had special Ram's Head i
stationery printed for the cam- I
paign.
Besides the Ram's Head letter- ]
head at the top of the stationery, I
down the left side are printed the j
words: "Revolving chairmanship, |
Norton, Cahn, and Dawson —three j
rides for a dime."
Down the other side of the page |
is a familiar old saw, paraphrased i
for the occasion:
"If at first you don't succeed—
1930 — try — 1937 — try — 1938 —
try—l939—again."
LEITER FROM LIFE
A letter received yesterday from ;
Life indicated that no definite ar- i
rangements would be made, either i
one ay or another, for several days, j
1 icket prices for "Wake Up and ;
Leave" have been reduced to $1 for j
the best orchestra seats in Memorial i
Hall. Other prices in the game sec- i
tion will be 75 and 50 cents, while j
balcony seats will also sell for the |
latter two prices.
