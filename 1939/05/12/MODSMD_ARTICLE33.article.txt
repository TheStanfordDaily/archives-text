# Women to Decide On Social Rulings
## 
### 
During the last few weeks, the
meetings of the Women's Council
have been occupied mainly with
discussions of the women's social
regulations. A painstaking survey is
being conducted by a committee
under Women's Conference in view
of certain revisions to be made in
the regulations.
At present no final decisions have
been made either by Council or
Conference, since they must await
the results of the voting by the
women in the residences on the va
rious proposed amendments to the
code of social regulations. Final de
cisions are expeclcd sometime next
week.
