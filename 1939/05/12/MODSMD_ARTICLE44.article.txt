### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 11 (UP).
â€”Harmon M. Wuley, convicted kid
naper of George Weyerhaeuser, Ta
coma lumber heir, today lost another
round of his court fight to get out
of Alcatraz prison when he was
denied the right to make an appeal
as a pauper.
Federal Judge A. F. St. Sure de
nied Waley's petition to appeal from
denial of his suits for writs of ha
beas corpus. Permission of the
court is required for a pauper's ap
peal, under which court costs are
not assessed the appellant.
Waley, who kidnaped the Tacoma
youth in 1935, is serving 45 years on
Alcatraz. He has been denied five
petitions for writs of habeas corpus
on different grounds, two in 1938
and three this year.
