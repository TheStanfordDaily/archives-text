### JERRY MAYER 
TIIE BAWLOUT —tan terror of Stanford, maddening marauder of col
lege happiness, acme of agony. Just what, you ask, is this dirge of doom :
doing in a sports column?
Well, to be exact, it isn't doing anything except being used as a medium j
i:i a diabolic scheme to evaluate the grade ratings of the various major |
athletic teams.
The figures don't prove anything except that anyone who compiles j
them is an idiot because naturally a lot of different things enter in. llow- I
ever, it does seem to me that they are interesting in an abstract sort of
a way.
Naturally, tho football players have the lowest average—which is to be l
expected considering all fall quarter they are in their season, which means i
hard physical contact the greater part of each week, not to mention the'
mental pitches the players have to reach almost every week-end. All of I
this naturally flattens a gridder's average almost as effectively as a steam- j
roller flattening an angel food cake. (
ONLY THE first string men of each major team were figured in. The I
calculations are on the basis of 2.0 being a C average and 3.0 a B average. |
Football—the average Bawlout record is 121 plus 19; a 2.2 rating.
Basketball—B2 plus 24—2.4.
Track—9o plus 45—2.5.
Baseball—B3 plus 30-2.4.
Tennis—ll3 plus 101—2.9.
The gride average of the tennis team is nothing less than sensational, j
four of the first stringers having better than B averages. But: the other !

averages are also enlightening, as*
well as satisfying.
The average non-extra-curricular I
student doesn't usually have better
than a 2.4 or 2.5 record, so when
Stanford has four major sport teams
ai ound that mark it shows the ath
letes are either picking their courses
judiciously, or else Stanford is the
breeding place of athletes of supe
rior intelligence.
I can see some burly, unshaved
athlete stop a stranger, drop one
arm coyly on his hip and while wav
ing the other in very aesthetic man
ner, recite as follows:
"We don't win every football
game;
Some of our contests were a
shame.
We may often be crude with the
Stanford maids,
But, darn it anyway, we shure I
got de grades."
FRESNO RELAYS tomorrow \
night at the Raisin City are prob- j
ably the greatest event of their kind !
in the country. Year in and year out ]
th.2 times, distances, and heights
surpass easily those made in any
other similar relays, including the
famed Drake and Penn Relays.
Following their misunderstood
"protest," which slipped through j
their fingers and became a "strike"
before they knew it, the tracksters
are entering full-force. Clyde Jef
frey, Bill Wohle, and Pete Zagar,
ring-leaders of the "prospect," will
forget about the IC4-A. and prob
ably each will add first place points
to Stanford's total in the open
events.
In case Phil Levy Fox, ex-Card
now competing for the Olympic
Club, is entered tomorrow night, it
will be interesting to see whether he
still holds the Indian sign over
Zagar.
Big Pete has a superstition that
Fox holds the evil-eye over him,
and consequently he always ties up
when he faces the dark-skinned
Olympian. At the P.A. meet at Ber
keley a couple of weeks ago, Zagar
threw the startling distance of 139
feet, to take fourth. That's a full
30 feet behind his best mark, and
25 behind his average distance. Oh
well, elephants are scared of mice,
too.
The University of San Francisco
and San Jose State College will re
sume their gridiron warfare after a
three-year lapse when they meet in
Kezar Stadium next Sept. 23, it
was announced today.
