# Farm Four, San Mateo- Fifty-Fifty
## Polo Squad Travels To Salt Lake Tuesday To Battle Arizona 
### 
It's a fast week for the polo
squad.
First it's battle the San Mateo
Polo Club team at 2:30 o'clock this
afternoon on the highway field.
Then it's take the train Tuesday
for Salt Lake City and meet the
University of Arizona in a two
match series May 18 and 20.
In today's match, the outcome is
about a toss-up: it's one of the
best rated squads on the Peninsula
up against a squad, the Stanford
squad, with a past experience rec
ord strong enough to win.
TOUGH BATTLE
That it will be a tough battle for
both sides, no one doubts.
Which squad plays the game for
Stanford is still undecided, and it
will depend on how the game goes
which men will stay in. But the
probable line-up is:
Walt Sullivan at No. 1; Steve
Downey, No. 2; Jim Fullerton (c),
No. 3; and Bert McClintock, No. 4.
SAN MATEO SQUAD
The San Mateo Polo Club is
pending up a squad composed of
Bill Gilmore, Lloyd Dinkelspiel, Ted
and Pat Linfoot.
Tomorrow morning Major Harry
Allen is matching his A squad
against his B squad in a warm-up
scrimmage lor the Arizona match at
Salt Lake City.
