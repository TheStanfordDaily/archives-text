# 'B's' Wallop 'A's' In Hard-fought Scrum Session
## Moon Mullins Sparks Whites to Touchdown In Closing Minutes 
### 
Sending his gridmen through an
other slam-bang scrimmage, Coach
"Tiny" Thornhill saw his red-jer
•seyed first team drop another de
cision to the second string on the
frosh lield yesterday.
With Frankie Albert taking a day
off because of a slightly injured
leg, "Moon" Mullin.s sparked the
seconds to a touchdown on the last
play of I lie practice session. A hard
charging forward wall kept the reds
back on their heels during most of
the session. Chet Patton worked in
the- second team baekfield in place
oh Bob Templeton.
The first team was made up of the
same eleven men who played Wed
nesday with Fay, St; ndh c. Cold
iron, and Groves in the baekfield
and Graff, Johannessen, Kerrnan,
McClintock, Patterson, Gibson, and
Stojkovich on the line.
The left side of the first line, with
Graff, Johannessen, and KermaVt
playing heads up defensive ball,
looked very good. The whites made
most of their gains on cut-backs be
tween Guard Dave Patterson and
Tackle "Hoot" Gibson.
Doug Stable, who fought his way
up from the fourth string, worked
well at the pivot position for the
Second string. As a result of Stable's
advance, Thornhill now has fallen
heir to a pair of very promising
centers from last fall's frosh squad.
Colin McClintock has become al
most a fixture at that position on
the first team.
