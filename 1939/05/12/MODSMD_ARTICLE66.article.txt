# Clyde Jeffrey Key Man of Relays
## Troy Favored To Win Meet 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Coach Dink Templeton's cindcrmcn have their work till out for them
when they entrain tomorrow for Fresno and the annual Pacific Coast
Relays, 'ihey've trained dioir guns on the mighty Tro'an track squad and
won't Le satisfied unless tho\ knock over the favored U.S.C. team and get
revenge for that dual meet licking at lhe hands of Troy last week-end.
Cromwell's warriors have every right to the position of favorite, for
with a trio of sprinters like Jordan, Anderson, and Willis to handle the

t hort relays and with the unbeatable
| Zamperini in the anchor lap of the
longer races, they look the logical
choice.
Last year the Cards finished in
! ihird place behind U.S.C. and Cal,
| but with a fellow named Jeffrey
: handling the anchor laps of the 44'),
| 880, and mile relays things may be
| different tomorrow evening.
And truly Clyde Jeffrey is the
| big- question murk of tomorrow's
1 meet, for if he can overcome the
j U.S.C. anchor-lap runner in those
, three short relays the Indians will
| have 30 points, a majority of the
j points awarded in the relay events,
j and will be well on their way to a
j win.
Though the distance men in both
| the two-mile and the medley race
I cannot be expected to romp home
I ahead of Zamperini, they should
j bring in two seconds.
But what the fans will be hoping
I for from Jeffrey will l<r a world'*
| record in the featured century. The
situation will be ripe for Fresno's
j track is the fastest in the nation, and
J there will be a good field of dash-
I men pushing Clyde.
The other assaull on a world mark
j will be made by Earl Vickery of S.C.
J in the low hurdles. This event has
j been added to the usual program
I and is an equally good bet for a
| world's mark.
The high hurdle race will find Bill
Hawkins again matching strides
j against Troy's great Humphreys.
' it's a shame that Sid Hayes will not
! be able to get in his nickel's worth
also.
Messrs. Anderson, Wohle, Bra
heny, Grey, Pool, and Zagar will
handle the hurling events for Dink
and will garner a majority of the
points. In the other field events the
, pickings will be slimmer, but Mc-
Kenzie, Brown, and Kenyon will try
to cut in for some places.
! A total of 21 men arc traveling
' south, and here is the way Temple
ton is planning to run his pupils in
the relays: 440-yard relay, Grant.
Carew, Hiserman, Jeffrey; 880-yard
relay, Johnson, Carcw, Hiserman,
Jeffrey; mile relay, Johnson, Rock
i well, Williamson, Jeffrey; two-mile
relay, Ferguson, Emanuel, Moore,
Girard: medley relay, Williamson

And truly Clyde Jeffrey is the

1 meet, for if he can overcome the
j U.S.C. anchor-lap runner in those
, three short relays the Indians will
| have 30 points, a majority of the
j points awarded in the relay events,
j and will be well on their way to a
j win.
Though the distance men in both
| the two-mile and the medley race
I cannot be expected to romp home
I ahead of Zamperini, they should
j bring in two seconds.
But what the fans will be hoping
I for from Jeffrey will l<r a world'*
| record in the featured century. The
situation will be ripe for Fresno's
j track is the fastest in the nation, and
J there will be a good field of dash-
I men pushing Clyde.
The other assaull on a world mark
j will be made by Earl Vickery of S.C.
J in the low hurdles. This event has
j been added to the usual program
I and is an equally good bet for a

Hawkins again matching strides
j against Troy's great Humphreys.

Messrs. Anderson, Wohle, Bra

to cut in for some places.
