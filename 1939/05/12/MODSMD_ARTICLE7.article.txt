# English Annual Accepts Play
## Prose, Verse Entries Due Next Monday 
### 
Jim Stone's "Beginning Without
End" has been chosen for the
"Pulitzer Prize" section of the Year
book of Stanford Writing, according
to English Club executive board.
Stone's one-act play was one of
the three winning plays in Ram's
Head's recent contest, and has been
produced at Stanford and on the
Peninsula seven times.
Adding to the best-of-the-year in
Stanford writing, the selection of
this play follows the choosing of the
Daily editorial, columns, and
Chaparral selection for the Year
book.
Included in the book will be short
stories and verse submitted by the
campus at large, according to Eng
lish Club. Two prizes of $25 each
will be given the authors of the best
stories and verse.
Students competing for a place in
the Yearbook and a chance at the
$25 prizes must have their manu
scripts in by Monday, Scott McGil
vray has announced. They must be
given to the English Club secre
tary or sent, to MacGilvray at the
Beta house.
'People have asked how many
manuscripts they can submit," Mac-
Gilvray said yesterday. "They can
turn in any numberâ€”just so they
are in by Monday."
