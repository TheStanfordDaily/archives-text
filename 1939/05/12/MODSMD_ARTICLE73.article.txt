# All Trimmed and Stuffed

THE postman always rings twiceâ€”the old
boy staggered in today for the fourth time.
He rang for a Daily staff member named
Hutchinson.
His eyes twinkled as he handed him the
envelope. "Yep," he said, "it sure looks like
you're the boy v/ho's really in for it this spring.
The draymatist fellers is really out after your
job."
"Yeah. Sure," the Duke replied.
He opened the letter. He had a sense of
humor so he didn't get mad when he read
what's printed in today's Campus Opinion
column.
He took it in the spirit it was meant.
He did have a few points in mind, however,
that might bear mental transcription.
In seven out of eight reviews of local drama
presentations, reaction of the reviewer has
been favorable. The fuss at present looks as
though it originated with someone who had
his toes stepped on for the first time.
The theater is run for the benefit of the au
dience. Therefore, the reviewer should see the
performance as a member of the audience, not
as a member of the cast, and not, particularly, as
an expert dramatist himself. It is his job to tell
his readers what he likes or dislikes.
If his readers trust his judgment they will
agree; if they don't they will disagree
If the reviewer is to whitewash campus dra
matic productions, as it looks as though the
dramatists who have written criticisms would
like, that becomes an insult to the integrity of
himself and his readers.
It is interesting to note, too, that the persons
of the drama division who are most vitally in
terested in dramatics, and have probably the
real sense of the theater, have not entered the
current controversy.
Today's Campus Opinion writer says, "Rec
ognize the fact that if better plays are to be
brought to Stanford . . That, in itself, is an
admission that Stanford drama could be im
proved.
Maybe the reviews aren't so hypercritical
after all.
