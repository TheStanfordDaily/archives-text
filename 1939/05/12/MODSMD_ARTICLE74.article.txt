# Happy Birthday!
## 
### 
THIS morning The Daily salutes a newcomer
to the Stanford-Palo Alto community.
The new arrival is the Palo Alto Free Press,
a five-column four-page weekly which is pub
lished co-operatively by a Community Press
Club. Subscribers are members of the club,
and periodically they will elect directors who
will serve as the editorial staff of the publica
tion.
Stanford has a particular interest in the new
paper. Edward Maslin Mulme, emeritus profes
sor of history, writes a front-page column for
each issue, a column entitled "Making His
tory."
And William S. Hopkins, assistant professor
of economics, plans to write for the paper. His
contribution to the first issue is a review of
John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath."
Professors Harold Chapman Brown and Theo
dore J. Kreps also have agreed to contribute to
the paper.
Having announced its policy as progressive,
the Free Press will represent classes and groups
in the community that, justly or not, feel that
the editorial policy of the Palo Alto Times is
not congruent with their economic interests or
political beliefs.
Greeting the new paper, The Daily wishes it
many happy returns of the day.â€”R. D.
