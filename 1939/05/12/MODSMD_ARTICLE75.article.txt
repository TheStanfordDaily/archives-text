# Cause for Little Worry

ON June 18 the class of '39 will undergo a
painful experience. Sitting in the Frost
Amphitheater for Commencement exercises,
648 seniors will contemplate sentimentally their
undergraduate life and will look forward ap
prehensively toward what is to come.
1" or many will loom the fear of unemploy
ment or the threat of wiping windshields for
the next four years. Reassuring to these men
will be a survey of representative university
graduates from 1928 to 1935 issued by the
U.S. Office of Education last week.
With 95 per cent of their number temporarily
or permanently employed, college alumni have
experienced notable success in securing jobs
during the depression years. Earnings for men
average 51,314 the first year and 52,383 after
eight years; for women, 51,092 the first year and
51,606 the eighth.
These and other statistics singularly favorable
in the light of economic conditions during the
period covered puncture the current legend |
that a large percentage of university graduates 1
are pounding the streets.
Apparently the class of '39 will eat, but |

whether it will find the type of work it wants
is another story. Only one man in four and
one woman in three secured the position he
desired in the first job, according to the survey.
Many aspiring public relations counsels and
efficiency experts undoubtedly will find them
selves selling bonds or insurance, but this has
decided advantages over being on relief. Only
two per cent of the men and one per cent of the
women investigated have been reduced to the
New Deal's payrolls.
As the graduates sit in the Amphitheater
fingering the sleeves of their academic gowns,
they will have little cause to worry about the
bogey of unemployment. Private offices and
pate de foie gras may be scarce for the next'
few years, but there will be a time clock and
Irish stew waiting for everybody.—L. L.
