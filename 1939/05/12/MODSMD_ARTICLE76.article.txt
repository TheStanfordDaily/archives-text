MOKE BUILDINGS
(STANFORD'S building mania and its parasitic effect
k on the academic budget hay never been the fa
vorite subject of conversation on the campus, but for
the past year or so it has cropped up fairly often.
Whenever it docs, some apprentice seer looks superior
and points out that if we don't accept buildings when
they are offered us, we won't get buildings.
This line of argument is usually expounded with
dramatic imagination. The men advancing it picture
the Stanford of the future gradually falling to pieces.
They see the Quad reduced to a condition resembling
the ruins of Carthage, and they predict that other
schools will make us outdated. They ask rhetorically
what Stanford can do under the circumstances.

What these prophets of doom overlook is the fact
that we can expand physical plant without raiding
the academic budget. And it stands to reason that if
we can work it this way, we are making a mistake
not to.
No one objects to buildings simply as buildings.
The trouble with them is that maintenance on new
construction must come out of University income, and
that means that funds available for academic work
are reduced. The solution to the problem is to make
adequate provision for maintenance before undertak
ing construction.

A NUMBER of universities make it a policy never
to accept the gift of a new building unless a main
tenance fund goes along with it. It would be easy
enough for Stanford to adopt this rule. When we are
offered a new building, we could accept the money,
but we could delay construction until we have a fund
to pay upkeep.
It is true that we would receive fewer gifts under
this policy. When a man comes around with a couple
of hundred thousand dollars to give away, it doesn't
please him to be told that we can't use it until some
one is willing to pay maintenance. He may take his
money off to some college that will throw up an im
pressive structure with his name over the door. But
even though we lose a chance at a new building we
would keep our academic budget intact, which means
that we wouldn't trade the quality of our education
ofr p. Nile of concrete.

And we would be given buildings in spite of our
cautious policy. A man who has a hundred thousand
dollars or so to give away usually knows enough about
business management to understand why we are play
ing cagey.
As it is now. each new piece of construction takes a
corner off the budget, and causes a corresponding loss
in our capacity for giving students an education. If
we insisted on a maintenance fund, each new building
would be so much net gain.
