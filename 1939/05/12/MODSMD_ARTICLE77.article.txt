# Lightly . . . And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
NATURE NOTE
As I have mentioned before, rumor has it that
there was a bat in the Pi Phi house all last year.
They say that Tuesday night there was a bat in
the Tri Delt house.
How can they tell.

What is all this Campus Opinion talk about es
thetics? They are saying old Hutch ain't got no
knowledge of esthetics. They are saying that he goes
to a play, and maybe he likes it and maybe he don't
like it. and he comes back and writes what he thinks
for The Daily. But they are saying he ain't got no
esthetics.
The way they are saying it, it sounds kinda like they
were saying he ain't got no ethics. Like he's double
crossing someone.
They say that I he people who put on the plays want
old Hutch to write about esthetics and say was it
good theater or bad theater and was the damn thing
art. But it seems to me that the professors over there
could kinda take the actors aside after the play and
tell them if they put enough art into it, and if it was
good theater.
I dunno. The rest of us farmers sorta like to
know was it a good show or a bad show, so maybe
we can get a girl and take her to it and have a
good time.
But maybe a show is a serious thing, like a lecture
or caster oil. Maybe we got the wrong idea. Maybe
if we want to have a good time we should read a
good book or get a drink or go to a dance. And laugh
at old Hutch while he writes about esthetics.

One of the houses is having its Spring formal in a
couple of weeks—and one-fourth of the brothers are
importing girls from Southern California for the binge.
Is it love and sweet romance, or love, or sweet
romance?
All I know is that any way you look at it, it's going
to co.st someone money. Are Southern California girls
worth this difference in price?
I personally would rather look around for a
small Strnford blonde.

The Dee Gees are trying to laugh this one off. Like
the man who whistles in the dark.
They got this card in the mail:
"Upsilon chapter of Delta Gamma requests the
pleasure of your company on Sunday evening, the
fourteenth of may, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine,
from five-thirty until seven-thirty o'clock. Please
present this card. Open House."
And on the other side it read:
"This is a sample of 150 invitations to be distributed
to hall men Saturday. Suggest you cancel plans Sun
day. Imperative you keep it quiet."
It's a neat trick.

The Dee Gees are trying to laugh this one off. Like
the man who whistles in the dark.
They got this card in the mail:
"Upsilon chapter of Delta Gamma requests the
pleasure of your company on Sunday evening, the
fourteenth of may, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine,
from five-thirty until seven-thirty o'clock. Please
present this card. Open House."
And on the other side it read:
"This is a sample of 150 invitations to be distributed
to hall men Saturday. Suggest you cancel plans Sun
day. Imperative you keep it quiet."
It's a neat trick.
1 promised not to tell a soul.
NATURE NOTE
As I have mentioned before, rumor has it that
there was a bat in the Pi Phi house all last year.
They say that Tuesday night there was a bat in
the Tri Delt house.
How can they tell.

What is all this Campus Opinion talk about es
thetics? They are saying old Hutch ain't got no
knowledge of esthetics. They are saying that he goes
to a play, and maybe he likes it and maybe he don't
like it. and he comes back and writes what he thinks
for The Daily. But they are saying he ain't got no
esthetics.
The way they are saying it, it sounds kinda like they
were saying he ain't got no ethics. Like he's double
crossing someone.
They say that I he people who put on the plays want
old Hutch to write about esthetics and say was it
good theater or bad theater and was the damn thing
art. But it seems to me that the professors over there
could kinda take the actors aside after the play and
tell them if they put enough art into it, and if it was
good theater.
I dunno. The rest of us farmers sorta like to
know was it a good show or a bad show, so maybe
we can get a girl and take her to it and have a
good time.
But maybe a show is a serious thing, like a lecture
or caster oil. Maybe we got the wrong idea. Maybe
if we want to have a good time we should read a
good book or get a drink or go to a dance. And laugh
at old Hutch while he writes about esthetics.

One of the houses is having its Spring formal in a
couple of weeks—and one-fourth of the brothers are
importing girls from Southern California for the binge.
Is it love and sweet romance, or love, or sweet
romance?
All I know is that any way you look at it, it's going
to co.st someone money. Are Southern California girls
worth this difference in price?
I personally would rather look around for a
small Strnford blonde.
