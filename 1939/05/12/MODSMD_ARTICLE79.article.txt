The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that following the
appearance of Art Levirison's and
Dan Holtom's excellent articles on
the position that dramatics occupy
tieiv at Stanford, the time has come
for The Daily to do several things,
to-wit:
1. Admit its errors instead of try
ing to defend them in such a petty
way.
2. Cease its umeliable reviews.
3. Obtain a reviewer v/hu under
stands the theater and who bases his
crhuism on someining more than
whether he, in his particular mood,
liked or disliked the snow.
4. Recognize the tact that if bet
tor plays are to be brought to Stan
ford. this end can bevt oe obtained
by a policy of » > operation with,
rather than opposition to the spoech
an.l drama department.
In the event the first foi r
points do not meet with your ap
proval, stuff a duck.
