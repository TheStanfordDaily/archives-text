The Editor, Sir:
I don't like to gripe but I'd like to
know how there could be a $200
deficit for the Masque Ball.
There were over 100 couples there
and this means $225 at least. I hap
pen to know that the orchestra was
paid about $135 and this leaves a
balance of $00.
This seems more than adequate to
cover expense in borrowing cur
tains and paying ticket-takers and
police.

J A $200 deficit means that at least
!$270 or twice that pa id the orches
j tra was spent on borrowing cur
j tains. II this is true it sounds like
I poor dance planning.

The Editor, Sir:
May I hereby offer congratula
tions to Small Timer, who implies
that the Hoover War Library be
called the Boulder Library, oti his
choice of a name? For himself, of
course that is. The surest mark of
a Small Timer anywhere is his abil
j ity to discover the most significant
j thing in his surroundings and gal
' lop up to scribble something scurri
lous on it. May'l also congratulate
j The Daily on discovering the one
; maverick on the campus (surely no
Californian) who is a follower of
that more conspicuous Small Timer,
1 Mr. Harold Ickes? May I, finally,
| offer both of them a large boulder,
|to be worn permanently on the
head?
