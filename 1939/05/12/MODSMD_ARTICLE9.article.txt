### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
By ROSEMARIE MULLANY

In Miss Anastasia Doyle's obscure ;
office in the Administration Build- j
ing is buried a wealth of informa- j
tive vocational material to which I
any woman in the University is ac
corded free access.
This fact, while having been con
stant for quite some time now, is j
little utilized at present. Every |
imaginable field is covered in some j
way by the books, pamphlets and i
files in the office. Not only is there j
information discussing the possibili- i
ties for women in the various pro- j
fessions, but the material also in- j
eludes fairly complete information |
on schools and training colleges spe- ;
cializing in their educational offer
ings. I
In a attempt to summarize the :
benefits to be derived from this j
work, which is the result of in- j
tensive labors by the Vocational j
Committee, it would perhaps be
well to list the information available j
on certain popular professions for j
women:
MOTION PICTURES
In this file the committee has a |
pamphlet from a recently organized S
school of motion picture arts located
in Los Angeles. Very briefly and
concisely the booklet tells just what |
the school has to offer, including j
courses and local connections in the
industry.
Another pamphlet entitled, "The
Current Outlook in Motion Pic- !
tures," published by the National j
Federation of Business and Profes- |
sional Women's Clubs, enumerates
the vast number of internal divi
sions in the field and compares
women's and men's employment in
the profession. It. also includes small
articles by prominent women al
ready occupied in the movie in
dustry.
In addition to this routine mate
rial are several letters from cxecu
tives in the studios explaining;
I among other things the best train
! ing for work in the movies and just
j what the chances for employment i
; are.
LAW
The folder containing vocational ;
! information on this topic fairly J
bulges as it i.s lilted from the tile, j
It includes magazine articles by and !
i about women judges and lawyers !
I stating their positions, how they got '
j them, and how they are progress
, ing. More pertinent, however, to l
j students actually interested in tak
! ing up law will be the letters flora
| former Stanford women students!
j now engaged in practice. These give
an insight into the problems and ad
i vantages of the profession which is j
j seldom captured in a magazine ar- !
tide.
j ART
The bulk of this file is taken up '
j with letters and pamphlets dealing i
I with the architectural side of the j
j field. Most of these stress the fact i
i that the architectural profession i.s i
I as yet uninvaded by women. On j
! the other hand they state the difii- !
j culties which may be encountered I
j in breaking into it.
j Included in all of these files are }
j the names of men and women with j
j whom the committee has been in I
; communication at one time or an - i
j other and who have consented to |
| interview students concerning the |
j chances for employment in their re- j
i spective fields. I
According to Gretchen Gillespie, |
: present chairman of the Vocational
j Committee, the group does not par- :
i ticularly aim to direct the voca- j
| tional inclinations of students, but
j merely to acquaint those still fum-
I bling for an occupation with the
| possibilities open to them.
