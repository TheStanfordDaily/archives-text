### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
IJANZIG — with a German ac
cent. Harlan, Ky. — with a
southern drawl.
In these two spots on opposite
sides of the Atlantic, men are pre
paring their guns for trouble today.
Over there it amounts to an inter
national crisis, here, a labor clash.
But there are the points to start
with tomorrow if you are looking
for a pool of blood.
Nazi troops are pouring into the
Free City on the Baltic, and the
Poles are awaiting apprehensively a
Hitler coup. In Kentucky the Na
tional Guard is patrolling the soft
coal mines to allow the strikers to
return to work, and CIO picketers
are ready for trouble.

To deal lirst with the event
capable of shaking the world:
40,000 German troopers under the
guise of tourists entered Danzig
over the week-end to take part in
Nazi demonstrations scheduled for
lodav. With the city full of
brown-shirts, with pro-German
sentiment roused to a record
height, now is the time for Adolf
Hitler to stage his coup.
The fact that thousands of ballots
labeled "JA" and "NEIN" have been
printed by a local newspaper gives
strength to the rumor that the
JReich will hold a plebiscite in the
Free City this week. With a popu
lation 95 per cent German, it is ob
vious what the result would be.

WHENEVER Hitler is ready to
make a grab, he conciliates the
pro-Nazi natives with a series of
outrages against local Germans.
True to form, this week-end Poles
were guilty of a suspiciously large
number of attacks on Danzig Hit
lerites. Shots have beefi fired, but
as yet no casualties have resulted.
The Storm Troopers assembled
in the strategic Baltic port in
sist that today's demonstration
will he just a concert at the
sports palace, followed by a few
steins of beer. But in the tense
ness of the current situation, it
would not be surprising if this
little clambake turned into the
start of the conquest of Danzig.
Warsaw has declared its intention
of fighting to keep the Reich from
taking the Free City. If Polish troops
go into action, England and France
are pledged to come to their aid.
But Chamberlain and Daladier will
not go to war over this international
snarl; it does not mean enough to
them to sacrifice a soldier, an air
plane, or a sack of wheat.

'pO TURN from beer to mint ju
leps, from Germany to Ken
tucky, we find that we may be hear
ing rifle shots close to home. To
day, at the start of the tenth week
of the strike in the bituminous coal
industry, Gov. A. B. Chandler's state
troops will stand guard at Harlan to
enabled weary miners to return to
work.
At the same time sympathizers
• of the United Mine Workers will
picket to prevent the strike being
brought an end without their hav
ing secured a union shop. Inspir
ed by John L. Lewis, this organ
of the CIO has been battling the
mine operators of the Appalachian
region for the past nine weeks
trying to achieve their objective.

When, at a joint meeting of un
ion representatives and mining offi
cials, President Roosevelt demanded
that the conflict be settled and the
men be put back to work for the
good of the nation, it appeared that
the strike was near its end. Nego
tiations were recommended and
made rapid progress until the end of
la.st week when they struck a snag,
and the compromise collapsed.
Tired of the strife which has
closed down numerous industrial
plants and transport lines and
threatens New York public utilities,
Gov. Chandler issued an ultimatum
to the United Mine Workers to set
tle the conflict or he would station
troops at the mines to enable men
to go back to work.
