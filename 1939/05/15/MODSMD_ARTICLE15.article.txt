# Elwell Visits Lab of First Radio Triumph
## Alumnus Key Men In British Defense 
### 
Cyril Frank Elwell, Stanford
graduate in 1908 and recognized in
ternationally as one of radio's im
mortals recently returned to Palo
Alto, the scene of his first triumphs
in wireless telephony.
According to the trim, white
haired engineer, who today ranks
as one of Great Britain's key men
in the all-important defense prepa
rations against air-attacks, he is in
the United States "merely for a
vacation."
EARLY EXPERIMENTS
Elwcll's early experiments made
soon after his graduation underlie
the first beginnings of radio and are
irrevocably linked with the Stan
ford campus and Palo Alto. Recent
ly he has constructed for the Brit
ish government, a chain of 11 radio
stations which form a line of de
fense along the North Sea.
These stations form a part of a
gigantic scheme to detect approach
ing airplanes which are heading for
England. Because the North Sea
can be crossed in six minutes by
invading aircraft, this line of radio
communication has been perfected
so that it automatically calculates
the speed, the height, and strength
of an oncoming fleet of ships, lays
barrage, sights guns, and fires them.
ADVENTUROUS CAREER
As a youth of 14 Engineer Elwell
began an adventurous career which
took him to many parts of the globe.
It. was in Australia that he saw a
Stanford register and decided to en
roll at this university. He arrived
at Stanford at 18, without a high
school education, but. nevertheless
completed entrance board examina
tions in German, French, Spanish,
physics and mathematics, and en
tered Stanford in 1903. He was
graduated in 1907 with A.B. and en
gineering degrees and a year later
with a degree in engraving.
Before the war, Engineer Elwell
aided in the discovery and devel
opment of such radio improvements
as the oscillating tube in 1912, and
the radio amplifier in the same
year. In 1932, Mr. Elwell visited
Stanford and used the facilities of
the engineering libraries for re
search in electro-metallurgy.
This is his first trip back to the
Stanford campus in seven years.

ADVENTUROUS CAREER
As a youth of 14 Engineer Elwell
began an adventurous career which
took him to many parts of the globe.
It. was in Australia that he saw a
Stanford register and decided to en
roll at this university. He arrived
at Stanford at 18, without a high
school education, but. nevertheless
completed entrance board examina
tions in German, French, Spanish,
physics and mathematics, and en
tered Stanford in 1903. He was
graduated in 1907 with A.B. and en
gineering degrees and a year later
with a degree in engraving.
Before the war, Engineer Elwell
aided in the discovery and devel
opment of such radio improvements
as the oscillating tube in 1912, and
the radio amplifier in the same
year. In 1932, Mr. Elwell visited
Stanford and used the facilities of
the engineering libraries for re
search in electro-metallurgy.
This is his first trip back to the
Stanford campus in seven years.
Cyril Frank Elwell, Stanford
graduate in 1908 and recognized in
ternationally as one of radio's im
mortals recently returned to Palo
Alto, the scene of his first triumphs
in wireless telephony.
According to the trim, white
haired engineer, who today ranks
as one of Great Britain's key men
in the all-important defense prepa
rations against air-attacks, he is in
the United States "merely for a
vacation."
EARLY EXPERIMENTS
Elwcll's early experiments made
soon after his graduation underlie
the first beginnings of radio and are
irrevocably linked with the Stan
ford campus and Palo Alto. Recent
ly he has constructed for the Brit
ish government, a chain of 11 radio
stations which form a line of de
fense along the North Sea.
These stations form a part of a
gigantic scheme to detect approach
ing airplanes which are heading for
England. Because the North Sea
can be crossed in six minutes by
invading aircraft, this line of radio
communication has been perfected
so that it automatically calculates
the speed, the height, and strength
of an oncoming fleet of ships, lays
barrage, sights guns, and fires them.
