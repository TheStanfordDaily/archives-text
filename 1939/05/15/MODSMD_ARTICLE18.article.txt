Bob Livingston, Farm Peace
Council head, presented the ques
tions, part of a nation-wide college
poll, to six Stanford professors who,
in turn, submitted the questions to
their classes.
In replying to the query of
whether or not they thought the
Italian and German governments
wore fairly discussed in the Ameri
| can press, Farm students registered
an 81.11 per cent negative vote.
At the same time, they believed
that United States' foreign policy, in
time of war, should permit her sup
plying England and France with
food and clothing in the event that
the latter countries should oppose
Italy, Germany, or Japan, ilow
j ever, a margin of only 54.18 per cent
favored such economic aid.
Over 200 students, representing
70 per cent of those who replied,
opposed United States' supplying
munitions and armaments to Eng
land and France. When the question
of America's granting military aid to
! these two countries in their fight
j against the fascist forces was intro
duced, Farm students were definite
lin their condemnation of such a
i proposal. Over 92 per cent opposed
I armed assistance to France and
I England.
"One of the significant results of
! the poll lies in the strong correla
i tion of answers," Livingston com
! mented. "We noted in tabulating
j results that those who believed the
; press of our country had been fair
j in representation of fascist activi
i ties in Europe also favored United
I States' sending munitions and troops
to aid any alliance against the
Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis," he con
tinued.
Stanford professors assisting in
the poll were Robert T. Ross and
Paul R. Farnsworth, psychology;
Thomas A. Bailey, Merril T. Spald
ing, Carl Brand, and Payson J.

The Dartmouth poll was conduct

compilation has not yet, been made,
I Livingston said.
Even though they believe thai Italian and German activities have
been unfairly represented in the American press, Stanford students favor
United States' granting economic aid to a French-English alliance against
the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis.
