# Retirement Story False, Says Wilbur
## Denies He Will Remain President After Reaching 65 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur
last night denied a report which ap
peared Friday in a San Francisco
paper to the efTect that he had ad
dressed a letter to the Board of
Trustees expressing his willingness
to remain as president of Stanford
University after his 65th birthday.
The newspaper, in a "confirmed
report," had stated that the letter
would possibly result in a waiver of
the University retirement law to
allow the president to remain in
olfice after the retirement age.
"No such letter was sent," Dr.
Wilbur commented.
President Wilbur, who had held
office 23 years, will be 65 next April
13. If no special waiver is made,
the retirement law will go into ef
fect in the fall of 1940.
The Board of Trustees, according
to the newspaper, met last Thursday
night to receive the letter, and
planned to act upon the matter at
their regular meeting this Thurs
day night.
Waiver of the i*etirement age
limit would constitute an unprece
dented move on the part of the
trustees. The law has always ap
plied equally and impersonally.
Among prominent members of
the faculty who have been retired
by the law are Professors Clarke B.
Whitticr, law; Cyrus F. Tolman, eco
nomic geology; Alonzo Englebert
Taylor, Food Research Institute;
Charles Moser, civil engineering;
Arthur William Meyer, anatomy;
Ernest Whitney Martin, classics;
Wilfred H. Manwaring, bacteriol
ogy; and Edward M. Hulme, history.
