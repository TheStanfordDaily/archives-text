# 'Hardy's' Still Going Strong; Rooney Good
## 
### 
"The Hardy's Ride High," .now
playing at the Fox-Stanford.
For some time now the reviewer's !
plaintive cry has been "Tone down
Andy Hardy." But this reviewer's
standpoint, the only bright spot in

the seemingly in
terminable Hardy '
series, is Andy i
Hardy as played i
by Mickey Roon- i
ey-
Granted that he j
overplays, mugs, j
and generally acts j
more like a Hol
lywood problem j
child than an ad- ]
olescent 16-year- j
old, he still man- |
ages to get laughs i
— lots of them — I

j from his audiences.
The sweetness and light of the j
I Hardy family, is apt to pall because
| they are more like a satire on the j
' average American family than a j
! portrayal of the real. Yet each i
' characterization, in itself, is a true
portrayal of what the scenarists in
, tended. It is just that they are too
I good to be true.
The plot is absurd, concerned as
I it is with the Judge's inheritance of
52.000.000 and subsequent loss of
same, through his own honesty. Bui
individual incidents were funny.
Andy's precipitous exist from a des
signing chorus girl's apartment, An- i
| dy's precipitous exit from a design
ing chorus girl's apartment, Andy's
' meeting with a Boston "fancypants" |
' youth, and Andy's final lie to his
I girl. —Nowell
