# Taylor, Stanwyck Wed in San Diego
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, May 14 (UP).—
1 Robert Taylor and Barbara Stan
! wyck, whose friendship had been in
[ the hand-holding stage for nearly
i three years, were married early to
! day.
They eloped to San Diego where
; they were married in a midnight
ceremony performed by a justice of
the peace. Ninety minutes later
they were motoring back to Holly
! wood.
!
Although their marriage had been
expected for several weeks, the
i manner in which it was carried out
was a surprise. For a week, they
had the license, but no one here
j except themselves knew of it. The
secret had been kept because the
j license was issued to them under
' their legal names—Arlington Brugh
; and Ruby Stevens. Superstitious of
the 13th, they waited until after
j midnight of the 14th — today —to
i use it.
The iron furnace was invented
! by Lord Dudley in 1621.
