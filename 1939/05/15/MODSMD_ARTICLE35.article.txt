## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Cards Drop Fresno Meet To Troy by Small Point Margin 
### 
Remarkable because of tlie absence of any worlds' records, last Sat
urday's Pacific Coast Relays at Fresno were even more remarkable be-'
cause of the fact Unit a mere three points separated those "untouchable"
Trojans and Cftacii Dink Templeton's cindcrmen.
To be more exact, the margin between the two teams was .'1 13-20

points, for UiS.C. finished with 56i
D-10, ihe Curds with 53*4, Cal fol
lowed at 42 13-20, then U.C.L.A.
ll :: i, Fresno State 11' i, Pepperdine
7, College of Pacific 5, San Jose State
2'j, and finally San Diego and
Whittier, each with 2.
DOPE UPSET
Contrary to the dope sheets of
the experts, Troy didn't win every
relay race, and likewise the Indian
tracksters upset Templeton's pre
diction that they wouldn't win any
baton passing event by taking the
880-yard relay. Instead Stanford's
cindermen got revenge for the dual
meet beating they took at the hands
of California a month ago and came
within an ace of achieving their
highest ambition, defeating U.S.C.
It was a head wind of 11 miles
per hour that robbed Clyde Jeffrey
of a chance to break the world's rec
ord in the 100-yard dash and also
robbed the relays of another record
to brag about. The wind slowed
"JefY" to a mere 9.8 but this time
was good enough to give him a one
yard decision over Fresno's own
Tommy Nelson
TROY THRILLS
The exploits of two of Troy's
trackmen gave the crowd perhaps
their biggest thrills. First there was
that sensational mile run by Louis
Zamperini as anchor man on the
winning medley relay team. The
great "Zamp" was 25 yards behind
Cole of California when he took over
and yet he hit the tape a full 10
yards ahead of the Cal man It was
undoubtedly the best mile in Coast
history, for he was caught unoffi
cially in 4:09.5.
Barney Willis was the other man
to amuse the crowd, for Barney was
caught napping and had to run the
anchor 110 yards of the quarter
mile sprint relay with his sweat
pants flapping about his knees. Wil
lis kept his team's lead and won the
event but later lost, the half-mile
race for his quartet by muffing the
baton.
If it wasn't these two gentlemen
who brought the fans to their feet it
was certainly Stanford's Bill Hawk
ins and Troy's Jim Humphrey, who
put on ihe greatest high hurdle bat
tle in relay history. The Trojan
was declared the winner by a scant
inch in the time of 14.8.
LONE CARD VICTORY
The Indian team of Johnson,
Carew. Hiserman, and JefTrey took
the only Indian victory in the re
lay events. These four whipped
through the 880 yards in 1:2(5.7, which
is 1.7 seconds from the world mark,
to take the Bear outfit by three
yards.
Surprising on the field were the
ups and downs of two of Stanford's
weight men. First there was Bill
Wohle, who slipped into third place
in the shot put, being nosed out of
second place by an eighth of an
inch bj Don McNeil of U.S.C. How
ever Stan Andersen handled the first
place position with a heave of 51
ft. 7 in.
POOL GOOD
The other surprising performance
was a come-through for the best
and was delivered by diseobulus
Ilamp Pool. Hamp tossed the platter
three feel better than ever before
to lake second at 153 ft. 9 in. Pete
Zagar won thi.s event far ahead of
the field with a toss of 108 ft. 2'-j in.
which set to the boards the meet
record of 104 ft. 5 in. held by Car
penter of S.C.
The Card's total reached its "al
most won" proportions due to a sec
ond in the mile relay, thirds in the
440-yard, 2-rnile, and medley re
lays. a third by Dick Simpson in the
high hurdles, and a four-way tie
for fourth by Jim Lincoln in the
high jump.
