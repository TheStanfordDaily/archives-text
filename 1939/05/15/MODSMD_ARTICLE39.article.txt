# Paul Herron Clips Off Two Records
## 
### 
Paul Herron, the Stanford-Long
Beach swimming ace, did it again
yesterday when he splashed his way
to an easy victory and two new rec
ords in a special invitational 440 held
at Neptune Beach in Alameda.
The Stanford record-breaker gur
gled his way over a 190 - yard
straight-away course to the eye
popping tune of 5:00.2, thereby clip
pine seven seconds off the official
P.A.A. record for the 400-yard dis
tance.
In addition Herron cracked the
National Intercollegiate record set
by Tom Haney of Michigan three
weeks ago by clipping eight seconds
off the officially recorded lime.
