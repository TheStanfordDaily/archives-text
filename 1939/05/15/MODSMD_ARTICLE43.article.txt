# Stanford Ruggers To Get Jackets
## 
### 
Twenty-two Stanford rugby play
ers will be awarded leather jackets
at a squad banquet to be held at
Villa LaFayette Wednesday night,
May 17.
While rugby men do not receive
letter awards, Advisory Coach Harry
Maloney has received enough con
tributions from interested alumni
and outsiders to make the presenta
tions possible.
The Indian team, runner-up for
the Northern California title and co
champion in the conference, was
the only outfit to defeat the strong
British Columbia All-Stars when
that team played a series at the

Golden Gate Exposition last month.
Despite the loss to Stanford, the
Canadians thought enough of the
winner's type of play to offer the
Farm crew a flat thousand dollar
guarantee for a trip into the North
west next Christmas vacation.
