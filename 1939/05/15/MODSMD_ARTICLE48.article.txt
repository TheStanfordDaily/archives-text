# 323 Blind Mice
## 
### 
FOR the edification of the Gallup-minded, to
day comes Stanford's answer to the nation
wide survey of student opinion on the foreign
policy of the United States being conducted by
the Dartmouth peace council.
Interesting, if far from representative, are the
results of this poll of two psychology and four
history classes which was rushed east by wire
to earmark Stanford as moderately isolationist.
If the outcome is inaccurate, Dartmouth's paci
fists have only themselves to blame. Questions
received a day ahead of time with instructions
that the survey must be conducted on a specific
date deny statisticians adequate time to feel the
pulse of a large university.
However, scrutinizing the results obtained
Friday reveals a view of foreign policy which
appears to be in key with the traditional Stan
ford attitude. Eighty-one per cent believe the
United States press unfair to Germany and Italy;
55 per cent would send food and clothing to the
Anglo-French alliance in case of war; 30 per
cent would supply munitions; and 8 per cent
favor armed intervention.
A high degree of correlation exists between
the opinions of those students who believe the
press deals justly with the axis powers and
those who would send troops to fight for the
democratic allies. These are Stanford's inter
nationalists.
Conclusions drawn from the poll indicate
that the 323 students quizzed are mildly isola
tionist. Whether they know whereof they
speak, whether their ideas are based on a care
ful consideration of current problems, are still
unanswered questions.
The students of this propaganda-conscious
age suspect the .newspapers of bias in favor of
France and England. Yet nowhere and at no
iime in history has there been a freer press
than that which exists today in the United
States.
While most foreign journals are strictly cen
sored and many of them mere government or
gans, American papers, from the New York
Times to the Daily Worker, can express their
frank opinions of Roosevelt, Chamberlain, and
Hitler.
Isolationism today is little more than a word.
The experience of 1917 proved that the United
States cannot keep out of a major European
war. The stand taken by the Stanford survey,
the wishy-washy stand, coincides with views of
a great many Americans who unknowingly are
afraid to face the problem ahead of them.
Not that we should resolve to send food and
clothing, munitions and men to fight in a Euro
pean war—but, a definite policy might serve to
prevent such a conflict.
A firm declaration that the United States will
aid the democratic nations probably would be
the most effective available means of staving
off a war aggravated by the Rome-Berlin axis.
Isolationists will raise their hands in horror;
conservatives will cower at the prospect.
But, in plain language, if we pledge ourselves
to France and Britain, we will scare the hell out
of Hitler and Mussolini. And probably avoid
the war they want to start.—L. L.

appears to be in key with the traditional Stan
ford attitude. Eighty-one per cent believe the
United States press unfair to Germany and Italy;
55 per cent would send food and clothing to the
Anglo-French alliance in case of war; 30 per
cent would supply munitions; and 8 per cent
favor armed intervention.
A high degree of correlation exists between
the opinions of those students who believe the
press deals justly with the axis powers and
those who would send troops to fight for the
democratic allies. These are Stanford's inter
nationalists.
Conclusions drawn from the poll indicate
that the 323 students quizzed are mildly isola
tionist. Whether they know whereof they
speak, whether their ideas are based on a care
ful consideration of current problems, are still
unanswered questions.
The students of this propaganda-conscious
age suspect the .newspapers of bias in favor of
France and England. Yet nowhere and at no
iime in history has there been a freer press
than that which exists today in the United
States.
While most foreign journals are strictly cen
sored and many of them mere government or
gans, American papers, from the New York
Times to the Daily Worker, can express their
frank opinions of Roosevelt, Chamberlain, and
Hitler.
Isolationism today is little more than a word.
The experience of 1917 proved that the United
States cannot keep out of a major European
war. The stand taken by the Stanford survey,
the wishy-washy stand, coincides with views of
a great many Americans who unknowingly are
afraid to face the problem ahead of them.
Not that we should resolve to send food and
clothing, munitions and men to fight in a Euro
pean war—but, a definite policy might serve to
prevent such a conflict.
A firm declaration that the United States will
aid the democratic nations probably would be
the most effective available means of staving
off a war aggravated by the Rome-Berlin axis.
Isolationists will raise their hands in horror;
conservatives will cower at the prospect.
But, in plain language, if we pledge ourselves
to France and Britain, we will scare the hell out
of Hitler and Mussolini. And probably avoid
the war they want to start.—L. L.
FOR the edification of the Gallup-minded, to
day comes Stanford's answer to the nation
wide survey of student opinion on the foreign
policy of the United States being conducted by
the Dartmouth peace council.
Interesting, if far from representative, are the
results of this poll of two psychology and four
history classes which was rushed east by wire
to earmark Stanford as moderately isolationist.
If the outcome is inaccurate, Dartmouth's paci
fists have only themselves to blame. Questions
received a day ahead of time with instructions
that the survey must be conducted on a specific
date deny statisticians adequate time to feel the
pulse of a large university.
However, scrutinizing the results obtained
Friday reveals a view of foreign policy which
appears to be in key with the traditional Stan
ford attitude. Eighty-one per cent believe the
United States press unfair to Germany and Italy;
55 per cent would send food and clothing to the
