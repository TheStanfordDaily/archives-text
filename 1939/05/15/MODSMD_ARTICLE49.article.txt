# The
						Other Quarter
## 
### 
NOT long after seniors have received their
diplomas in the Frost Memorial Amphi
theater, a group of summer students moves in
on the Stanford campus.
Few persons realize that activity here during
the summer is as complete as it is during the
other three quarters.
This summer, 25 visiting professors will aug
ment the part of the regular faculty which stays
on for the three months. All of Stanford's fa
cilities will be available for both professors
and students; there will be 10 special confer
ences held on the campus.
Added to this, the campus assumes an air of
informality that is not duplicated during the
rest of the year and the result seems to be not
only profitable in an academic way, but so
cially as well.
However great that result may be, however,
it is certain that summer quarter is an impor
tant part of Stanford's year, is most probably
the part of which it can afford to be proudest.
