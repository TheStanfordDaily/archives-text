# Long-Range Planning
## 
### 
FOURTH annual Leadership Institute of Stan
ford will this week hold its first meeting.
Probably better planned and directed than
its predecessors, the Institute will offer a valu
able opportunity to next year's student office
holders to obtain a little previous information
on what they are stepping into.
Idea that motivates the series of meetings is
the success of student government and how

that success can be achieved.
Plan of the Institute is to bring together out
going and incoming leaders who will meet with
Dr. Hand of the education department, who has
made a special study of the field, expose them
to the problems of Stanford's political system,
pass on the ideas that have come from expe
rience.
Unquestionably, the Institute offers a valuable
solution to the yearly problem of inexperienced
student legislators and administrators trying to
step into office cold and yet still carry on cer
tain long-range policies which are coincidental
with student government.
The one thing that may prevent the Institute
from achieving its goal is lack of interest on
the part of the officials-elect.
What they must realize is that their part in
the Institute is far more important than anyone
else's. It is they with whom Stanford must live
next year. •
