# BULL SESSION

### JOHN COBBS 
THE MEEK SHALL INHERIT

the better part of three years now, I have
camped behind a wobbly Underwood in the Daily
Shack, dispensing blessings and curses with fine im
partiality, like a slot machine. But I have discovered
that next year 1 must coinc out from my typewriter
barricade; instead of telling other people how to man
age campus affairs, I must manage one or two things
myself. Remembering the fine impartiality of com
mentators, I have decided that it is time I learned
somethng more about managing.
For the rest of the year I will observe the spinning
wheels of student government at close range, and will
try not to get my fingers pinched. Then perhaps next
fall, Daily columnists won't find it too easy to get
topics.

But this means that I must come from my seat
behind the Underwood. Bull Session is an imperious
mistress and demands faithful attention. Night editors
have a way of being downright rude when copy is late;
they use words that, are not found even in a modern
novel. There is no time to do any observing across a
keyboard.
And so until the end of the volume, Bull Session and
[ will go different ways. But I am looking forward to
what is going to happen when the "Under New Man
agement" sign is hung out. The Editor has worked
out a bit of strategy that rates with anything Napoleon
ever did.

A FTER this the campus leaders who have hunched
their shoulders and ducked their heads against
the winds of The Daily, will get a chance to create
some wind of their own. Each day the column will be
written by someone prominent on the campus. We
are looking forward to lots of finely impartial curses
and blessings,
I find the idea very intriguing. For three years the
accusation, "You don't understand," has rattled
around the Shack. Campus leaders have muttered to
themselves and looked like the third assassin in Mac
beth. The Campus Opinion column has echoed with
complaints and partial explanations.

But now democracy has extended to include jour
nalistic lightning. Women's Conference can explain
its ideas on jurisdctonal imperialism. Cardinals can
put the theory of government through its paces. As
sorted professors who have looked down their noses
at The Daily can split their own infinitives. Bull Ses
sion under the new policy should combine all the best
features of the Court of Human Relations and an old
fashioned camp meeting.
In the meantime I am re-reading that strctch in
the Bible about him who is without sin casting the
first stone; and as I step out from behind the battle
ments of my Underwood, I am prepared to dodge.
