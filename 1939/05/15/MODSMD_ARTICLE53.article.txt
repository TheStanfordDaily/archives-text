# Lightly . . . And Politely
## GEORGE AND LENNIE 
### DOUG JAQUES 
At Vanessi's, after midnight Friday night. The
elderly Italian headwaiter leads the way to the table.
He leans over to clear away the dishes lott by the
last occupants.
"I'ma mad," he mumbles. "I'ma sore."
Surprised, the young lady looks at him. "What?"
"I'ma talkin' aloe, lady." He goes of! mumbling in
Italian.
Aloud, clear voice in the corner. An angry glare
toward that corner from the Italian. A quick glance,
you see the source of the Italian's anger, you see
Celebrities.
Wallace Ford and Lon Cheney, Jr., George and
Lennie. They are in character. George is angry. His
sharp voice breaks across the room. 'The show . . .
Gotta show tomorrow . . . Gotta woik tomorrow . . .
She was drunk . . . She wouldn't admit she was
drunk."
Lennie is beside him. You can almost hear him say,
"Yeah, George." Big, dark, long black hair close to
his ears, he is conscious of being stared at.
Fat little freckle-faced George takes out a cigar,
lights it. He talks to Lennie, to the big, middle-aged,
dyed-haired blonde beside him, to his cigar, to the
second row balcony.
His blonde and Lennie's red-head don't talk. They
look bored. George gets up. and they leave. The red
head, the blonde, and Lennie leave. George the
waiter, is magnanimous as he gives him a tip. You see
he is wearing a colored silk scarf in place of a necktie.
He sticks his cigar in the corner of his mouth and
starts off after George and the women.
He is talking. To Lennie, the red-head, the blonde?
The girl up in front behind the cashier's window could
tell. She could hear him.
The old Italian looks after him and swears in Ital
ian. and swears at a waiter clearing off a table.
And George tells the cashier, the man by the door,
Lennie, the blonde, that he has to woik otmorrow.

Speaking of plays, Women's Conference had quite
a battle last year. I hear, when a girl took a cultural
late leave to see "Room Service . . . One of the Toyon
boys got a nice two-pound box of candy for Mother's
Day. . . . Last week I got my full quota of threaten
ing letters and calls, and My God, here we go again.
