# CAMPUS OPINION
## PEACE POLL 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
On May 10, H. B. Lee received a
letter from the Dartmouth College
Peace Committee asking his assist
ance in swinging a nationwide poll
covering students in every Ameri
can college to determine opinions on
two questions related to internation
al affairs. The Dartmouth commit
tee desired that these questions be
posed on May 11.
Obviously, on such short notice,
it was impossible to conduct any
thorough poll of the whole student
body. However, seven professors
were phoned late Wednesday night,
informed of the poll, and asked to
co-operate.
It speaks well of the democracy
and vigor of these men who respond
ed so enthusiastically and were glad
to help promote a student enterprise
though such promotion caused in
convenience, might not taste well to
their students or colleagues, and
would probably not result in a real
ly thorough and reliable expression
of opinion.
They were more than willing to
go out of their way to conduct the
questionable simply because stu
dents had asked the questions. Stu
dents had made at least one more
attempt to think seriously about an
involved and signfiant problem. That
their attempt was an awkward one
was secondary to the spirit in which
it was generated.
The poll was answered by 323
students. Given such agreeable and
immediate assistance by the profes
sors we were obviously able to have
a fairer expression of student opin
ion than could have been obtained
without their aid. Respectful campus
opinion is fostered by faculty co
operation like this.
