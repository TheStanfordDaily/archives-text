# . . . TO AMMAN'S HEART

The Editor, Sir:
Before I start I thoroughly realize
that what I am about to say is
the worst kind of rank radicalism,
especially here on the Stanford
campus.
A few months ago, while walking
up the Row, I overtook three of
our typical Stanford girls who were
very much engrossed in some topic.
Would you believe it, they were
talking about how much fun it was
to cook (something entirely new to
them), and how they enjoyed the
Home Making Course they were
taking. A complete reversal of deep
rooted custom since the five hun
dred.
They were more elated over the
fact that their muffins were actually
edible, and the roast palatable than
if they had been dated up for the
next six months.
That's great stuff; more power to
them. They really got a kick out of
it, and so did I, being from the old
school.
I have been here for four years,
and I have seen them come and go.
About three-fourths of these young
sters have never seen a kitchen, and

the sight of a range would make
them bilious.
Chase these "clothes horses" into
the kitchen with more of these home
making courses.
Looking for an eligible wife in 10
years. C. S.
