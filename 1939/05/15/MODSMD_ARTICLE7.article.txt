# Photo-Ogling Printers Delay Quad Schedule

### 
The wor iters of the Sunset Press
took so much time out. to look at
50 pages of candid shots in the
1939 Quad that work ended a day
later than was expected. Quads are
now in the bindery, covers and
printed sections of the book having
been completed during the latter
part of last week.
Also enthusiastic about the four
color photographs which will be
used as the cover and section divi
sions, the Press acclaims the pictures
as the best work ever to pass
through their hands, and will ex
hibit them in the window display
of the Press Building in San Fran
cisco.
Quads will be distributed next
Monday, at least a week earlier than

in previous years, according to Man
ager Margaret Hale. Sales will con
tinue throughout the week, or un
til books are sold out. Purchasers
may order their Quads at the Post
Office desk, the A.S.S.U., and t he-
Quad office.
Because finer paper has been
used, and over twice the number of
candid camera sections added, the
1939 Quad will be thicker book than
in previous years, Editor Frank
Lippman said. Printed in lower case
style throughout, the book will com
bine striking layouts with vivid
photography to give a "stream
lined" effect.
Quads may be ordered for $5.67
each, or, with the buyer's name on
the covex', for $6.17.
