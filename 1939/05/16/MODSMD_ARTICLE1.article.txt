### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
IT WAS midnight in Moscow.
Looming up against the slate
blueness of the sky, the massive
towers of the Kremlin gave no hint
that they housed Josef Stalin in
stead of Peter the Great.
The door to the great wing occu
pied by the Foreign Commissariat
swung heavily open to admit Sir
William Seeds, British Ambassador
to the U.S.S.R., to the presence of
Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molo
lov. In the richness of imperial fur
niture, ancient candelabra, and walls
of green malachite, only the drab
gray uniform of the Commissar be
trayed this as a twentieth century
Communist state.
Formalities over, lie leaned for
ward to convey Russia's official
reply to England's proposed alli
ance, assuring Soviet aid to the
democratic allies in case of at
tack, but making no reciprocal
guarantee in the event that the
Union was invaded.
No.

r I I HE British Ambassador was not,
surprised. He did not under- j
stand how Mr. Chamberlain could!
expect Stalin to agree to a pact!
which offered him practically notli- i
ing except a guarantee against an i
unchallenged Nazi invasion of Pol- I
and, Rumania, and Greece. The ]
mighty force of the Red Army could ,
not, gained as easily as that.
Telephoning to London, Sir Wil- I
Ham expressed his regret to the l
Prime Minister, and was surprised to '
hear him reply that he was not giv- j
ing up the cause, that he still had i
hopes of winning the support of the j
Soviet Union without entering a j
full military alliance.

Behind the optimism of Neville
Chamberlain lay this hope: Stalin
may capitulate if France and Eng- i
land extend their anti-aggression
pact to include Esthonia, Lithu- j
ania, and Latvia, thus protecting
Russia from a German attack by
way of these buffer states.
However, this is the white-wash- j
ed. idealistic view of the situation. I
Today the U.S.S.R. occupies the
commanding position on the Eu- j
ropean chess board, and stands to;
gain more from temporary isolation!
than from a treaty which does not 1
grant, significant concessions.

is negotiating with Tur
key for an alliance which will
be a duplicate of the Anglo-Turkish
accord which was sealed last week, j
In order to soothe any pain that may
have resulted from friction between t
the Turks and the French mandate
in Syria, Daladier's Foreign Office l
will surrender sovereignty over Al- j
exandretta, a strip of land on ihc!
eastern shore of the Mediterranean.'
With this strategic power of the j
Near East (irmly linked to Eng- j
land and France, it will he difficult
for Russia to keep away from the j
council table of the anti-fascists. !
Turkey has agreed to open the >
Dardanelles to both of its new !
allies, and a brief glimpse at the
history of the last World War re- '
veals the strategic importance of ;
this entrance to the Black Sea.

If trouble were to start in eastern
Europe, the axis powers immedi
ately would place their base of op
erations in Rumania, and attempt to
settle the issue on the Black Sea.
It is then that, the Dardanelles and !
armed aid from Turkey would be
important enough to assurj victory
lor the allies.
War in the Balkans surely would
involve the Soviet. Miles of wheat
lands in the Ukraine and Russian
ports on the Black Sea would stand
in need of protection. A strategic
ally minded nation, and the U.S.S.R.
is just that, would side with France
and England in the conflict on the!
strength of their agreements with!
Turkey.
Until there is something worth '
bothering with, the Soviet Union I
will stand alone.
