### 
Room rents in l>ofli men's and women's halls will l»e raised next fall
according to an announcement made yesterday hy President Ray Lyman
Wilhur and Comptroller J. Hugh Jackson.
At the same time the Dean of Men's office stated that tlio Toyon-
Branner set-up will remain unchanged next year. Although various

•changes have been discussed in con
nection with the proposal to re

Because of reduced income from
endowment, the University finds it
necessary to add $15 per quarter to
room rent for women's dormitories
and $0 per quarter for men's halls,
including Encina, Sequoia, Toyon,
Branner, and the Old Union.
FARM RATES LOW
Rates for Roble, Lagunita, and the

tions, according to Dr. Wilbur.

but eating club members.

obstacles it. would be impossible to

and $0 per quarter for men's halls,

Rates for Roble, Lagunita, and the
