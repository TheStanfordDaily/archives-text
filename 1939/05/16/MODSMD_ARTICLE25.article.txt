### ARCH JENKINS 
LEE ORR. Washington State Col
lege's big sprint ace, didn't run in
the Northern Division meet at Pull
man last Saturday. If Orr doesn't
compete in the conference meet in
Seattle this week-end, Stanford's
chances of winning the all-Coast
get-together might be dimmed about
50 per cent.
Just what, you are probably ask
ing, does Orr's entry mean to the
Indians? Well, the only hope the
local lads have for first place hangs
on the ability of the snow birds
from the north country to take away
a slug of points from the long array
of Trojan champions. And Orr, may
his injuries heal, looks like the man
to take two seconds and eight val
uable points behind Clyde Jeffrey,
who will not be beaten on any coast
this year.
Sii|)|inse Orr got a second in the
KM) and 220-yard dashes and an
chored the sizzling Cougar relay
team into the top spot over the
S.C. baton crew? That would take
13 big points away from the south
erners in a 12-team race, and that
is just about the margin that our
Indians have to pick up some
where.
Then, again, if the Cougars, who
level in upsetting us warm weather
fiends, take two points away from the
Terrible Trojans, they might forget
their initial purpose and go on to
win the darned thing themselves.
The problem is mildly terrific. At
any rate, whether Orr helps the
Stanford cause or no, he is still the
only man in the West who can make
Jeff ramble. That is, he's the only
man unless Emigh, Montana's prize
220-yard ace, has another 20.5 per
formance under his belt. Emigh
was second in a 20.9 race in the
northern finals, so don't say we
didn't tell you if Jeffrey hits 20.2
or 20.3 provided the howling Se
attle zephyrs are under four miles
an hour.

Orr's injury brings to mind a
peculiar situation which has con
fronted sprint stars up Pullman
way. The Cougars draw great
track men from many corners of
the globe, in about the same pro
portion as Stanford. Rut there
seems to lie a jinx on any sprinter
molding into a champion down
there in the middle of those wind
swept wheat fields.
The Cougar coaching is much
better than average and Washing
ton State has every facility neces
sary to safety and comfort includ
ing such things as a flock of train
ers, a swell new track, and a field
house big enough for Bob Peoples
and all his javelin tosses. The Cou
gars never lack a freshman sprint
ace who burned up the paths in
high schools.
Bui lew of these young aces are
contenders by the time they reach
their senior years. In quick suc
cession. the great Negro Wes Foster,
then Paul Swift, and now Lee Orr,
have all been caught by ailing
muscles in the legs. Maybe it's due
to the terrific strain the runners un
dergo before hot weather sets in.
The distance men and field com
petitors can unlimber gradually, but
the same thing doesn't hold true for
the short races.
Unfortunately, all of the Cougars
could have been world champs had
their legs held up for three varsity
years. Orr might come back, though
he lacks Jeffrey's top condition and
hasn t been in fast company all year.
For the sake ot both ol them, how
ever, and to disprove the jinx theory
we've cooked up. we'll keep our
fingers crossed lor a Jeffrey-Orr
duel—and maybe two of them—this
Saturday.

Orr's injury brings to mind a
peculiar situation which has con
fronted sprint stars up Pullman
way. The Cougars draw great
track men from many corners of
the globe, in about the same pro
portion as Stanford. Rut there
seems to lie a jinx on any sprinter
molding into a champion down
there in the middle of those wind
swept wheat fields.
The Cougar coaching is much
better than average and Washing
ton State has every facility neces
sary to safety and comfort includ
ing such things as a flock of train
ers, a swell new track, and a field
house big enough for Bob Peoples
and all his javelin tosses. The Cou
gars never lack a freshman sprint
ace who burned up the paths in
high schools.
Bui lew of these young aces are
contenders by the time they reach
their senior years. In quick suc
cession. the great Negro Wes Foster,
then Paul Swift, and now Lee Orr,
have all been caught by ailing
muscles in the legs. Maybe it's due
to the terrific strain the runners un
dergo before hot weather sets in.
The distance men and field com
petitors can unlimber gradually, but
the same thing doesn't hold true for
the short races.
Unfortunately, all of the Cougars
could have been world champs had
their legs held up for three varsity
years. Orr might come back, though
he lacks Jeffrey's top condition and
hasn t been in fast company all year.
For the sake ot both ol them, how
ever, and to disprove the jinx theory
we've cooked up. we'll keep our
fingers crossed lor a Jeffrey-Orr
duel—and maybe two of them—this
Saturday.
LEE ORR. Washington State Col
lege's big sprint ace, didn't run in
the Northern Division meet at Pull
man last Saturday. If Orr doesn't
compete in the conference meet in
Seattle this week-end, Stanford's
chances of winning the all-Coast
get-together might be dimmed about
50 per cent.
Just what, you are probably ask
ing, does Orr's entry mean to the
Indians? Well, the only hope the
local lads have for first place hangs
on the ability of the snow birds
from the north country to take away
a slug of points from the long array
of Trojan champions. And Orr, may
his injuries heal, looks like the man
to take two seconds and eight val
uable points behind Clyde Jeffrey,
who will not be beaten on any coast
this year.
Sii|)|inse Orr got a second in the
KM) and 220-yard dashes and an
chored the sizzling Cougar relay
team into the top spot over the
S.C. baton crew? That would take
13 big points away from the south
erners in a 12-team race, and that
is just about the margin that our
Indians have to pick up some
where.
Then, again, if the Cougars, who
level in upsetting us warm weather
fiends, take two points away from the
Terrible Trojans, they might forget
their initial purpose and go on to
win the darned thing themselves.
The problem is mildly terrific. At
any rate, whether Orr helps the
Stanford cause or no, he is still the
only man in the West who can make
Jeff ramble. That is, he's the only
man unless Emigh, Montana's prize
220-yard ace, has another 20.5 per
formance under his belt. Emigh
was second in a 20.9 race in the
northern finals, so don't say we
didn't tell you if Jeffrey hits 20.2
or 20.3 provided the howling Se
attle zephyrs are under four miles
