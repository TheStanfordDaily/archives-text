# Bill Paulman Awarded Gimbel Trophy
## Ace Gridder Selected For Athletic Attitude Paulman's Fame Started With 'Vowing Sophs' 
### 
Chosen as the graduating senior
"whose attitude toward athletics
is outstanding," Bill Paulman, star
footballer whose fame runs way
back to tho time of the "Vowing
Sophs," was yesterday named the
winner of the annual Jake Gimbel
Award.
An award committee headed by
Dr. Thomas Storey and including
Professor W. B. Owens and Dean
of Men John Bunn recommended
Paulman to President Ray Lyman
Wilbur. He was chosen not only for
his "helpful attitude toward team
mates and his co-operation with his
coaches" but also for "his uncom
plaining attitude while disabled
from time to time because ol ath
letic injury."
INJURY JINX
"Brittle Bill," as Paulman was
often called for the jinx ol injuries
that seemed to follow him on the
gridiron, first rose to fame as the
sophomore member of the "vow
boys" in their final season.
His punting and passing through
out the season aided the Cards to
reach the Rose Bowl, and he was
the main cog in their victory there
over a mighty Southern Methodist
outfit.
LEG BROKEN
That was in the season of "35. Next
year Bill broke a leg during a prac
tice session and was kept from ac
tion. However, in 1937, though ham
pered by injuries of one kind and
another, he boosted the Indians into
second place in the Coast Confer
ence. He almost successfully fought
off the Bowl-bound wonder team
from Cal that year all by himself.
During the season that has just
passed he was the foundation of
Coach Tiny Thornhill's backfield
and a steadying influence of confi
dence and experience. He also
performed creditably in the annual
East-West classic in Kezar Stadium.
The Gimbel winners in the past

Wilbur. He was chosen not only for
his "helpful attitude toward team
mates and his co-operation with his
coaches" but also for "his uncom
plaining attitude while disabled
from time to time because ol ath
letic injury."
INJURY JINX
"Brittle Bill," as Paulman was
often called for the jinx ol injuries
that seemed to follow him on the
gridiron, first rose to fame as the
sophomore member of the "vow
boys" in their final season.
His punting and passing through
out the season aided the Cards to
reach the Rose Bowl, and he was
the main cog in their victory there
over a mighty Southern Methodist
outfit.
LEG BROKEN
That was in the season of "35. Next
year Bill broke a leg during a prac
tice session and was kept from ac
tion. However, in 1937, though ham
pered by injuries of one kind and
another, he boosted the Indians into
second place in the Coast Confer
ence. He almost successfully fought
off the Bowl-bound wonder team
from Cal that year all by himself.
During the season that has just
passed he was the foundation of
Coach Tiny Thornhill's backfield
and a steadying influence of confi
dence and experience. He also
performed creditably in the annual
East-West classic in Kezar Stadium.
