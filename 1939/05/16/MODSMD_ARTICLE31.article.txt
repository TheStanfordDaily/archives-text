# Cindermen Prime For Seattle Meet
## 
### 
Back from Fresno if not with the
scalp of the Trojan at least with a
handful of his hair. Stanford's cin
dermen yesterday plunged into
preparation for their trip to Seattle
and the Pacific Coast Conference
meet.
Dink Templeton's subjects missed
taking the mighty U.S.C. team by a
mere three points at the Relays, and
now that they realize that Troy can
be taken they arc anxious to have
another crack at their cindermen.
The team of 18 men. as yet unnamed,
will leave Wednesday afternoon in
order to be in Seattle for the trials
on Friday. The finals follow on
Saturday.
