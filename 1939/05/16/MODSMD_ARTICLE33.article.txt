# Farm Poloists Entrain for Utah
## 
### 
Resting on their close 8-7 victory
over the San Mateo Polo Club last
Saturday, the A-squad Card horse
men entrain for Salt Lake City this
afternoon where they will meet the
crack University of Utah squad in a
two-game series Thursday and Sat
urday.
Chief blow to the Indians' chances
in the series will be the absence of
Captain Jim Fullerton, who will
remain here because of increased
studies. Walt Sullivan, Steve Down
ey, and Bert McClintock will ride at
positions 1, 2 and 4. respectively,
but it is still undecided who will
fill the vacated No. 3 position.
The rest of tonight's traveling
squad will be made up of Louis
Metzger, Tony Keese, and Dave
Brookes. The team will be accom
panied by Major Harry Allen,
coach; Sergeant Casen; and Bob
Thomas, senior manager.
In Saturday's match with San .
Mateo, Steve Downey, hard riding
No. 2. led the Cards with five goals,
despite a somewhat off day for the ;
team as a whole.
