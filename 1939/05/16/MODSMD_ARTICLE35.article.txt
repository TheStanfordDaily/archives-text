Resting from two hard scrim
mages last week that will probably
be repeated Wednesday and Thurs
day, the spring 1939 football squad
went through a relatively easy
workout on the frosh gridiron yes
terday. Most of the practice session
was devoted to polishing running
and passing plays.
Frankie Albert saw no action as
he is still favoring an ankle that was
slightly injured last Wednesday. If
the work so far this spring may be
used as an indication, next fall's
varsity will rely a good deal on
speed and deception. Several of the
plays used in spring scrimmages
have been well suited to Albert's
left-handed passing style.
