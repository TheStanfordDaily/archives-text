# Rising Price Curve

### 
WHEN the class of '92 arrived at Stanford
for the first registration day, no charge
was made for tuition. Today the "Make All
Checks Payable" sign seems as typical of the
Farm as the front of the Chapel.
As times have changed, so have fees at Stan
ford. Yesterday the University announced the
latest rise in the cost of getting an education —
$15 added to room rent in women's halls and
$9 added in men's.
The reason isn't a new one. The rate of in
come on the University's investments continues
to drop, and as it falls, so student fees will rise.
The blame does not lie with the Administra
tion. What happens in Wall Street is respon
sible, not what happens in Dr. Wilbur's office.
The situation is regrettable because the ris
ing cost of going to Stanford is inevitably and
insidiously undermining the tradition of de
mocracy.
In the opinion of many outsiders, this is a
school for rich men's sons. Actually our sys
tem of scholarships and the student employ
ment service make it possible for anyone with
outstanding ability to attend the University.
But it isn't easy.
For many years low room rents in the halls
have kept men from being forced to drop school
—men without the cash or the first-string ath
letic ability necessary to pledge a fraternity.
The rise is only $9 per quarter, but it is repre
sentative of a trend. If the income from invest
ments continues to fall, there will be bigger
checks made out for other services provided
by the University. Scholarships will be corre
spondingly rare, and Stanford will lose its most
worth-while class of students.
And here the problem reaches its unanswer
able conclusion. Nothing we can do will make
interest rates go up.
With the unhappy prospect of a student body
composed of bankers' sons, of an exclusive,
effete Stanford of the future, we are left empty
handed.—L. L.
