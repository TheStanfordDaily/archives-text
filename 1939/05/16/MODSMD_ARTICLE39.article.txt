# Value v. Limitation

### 
A HANDFUL of Stanford students had a
chance last Sunday to get a first-hand
glimpse of the Federal government's migrant
labor program.
They drove to the Federal camp at Westley,
Calif., where 45 families still are living as the
pea season draws to a close.
They found there are 13 such camps in Cali
fornia. The plan is ultimately to provide living
facilities for the bulk of the migrant agricultural
labor, camps to be placed at strategic points
where workers can use them in preference to
living in squatter camps.
Besides providing a place to live, the govern
ment through the Farm Security Administration
organizes recreation and offers instruction ,in
dietetics and birth control.
Sanitary facilities alone of these Federal
camps would make them far superior to ordi
nary squatter camps, but with this thorough
going program of rehabilitation the camps are
a boon to the migrant, who has been taking an
economic beating so long.
Valuable as they are, however, in providing
adequate and healthy living conditions, these
camps are not by any means a cure-all. All they
do is ameliorate a bad situation. The program
doesn't pretend to tackle the problem of sea
sonal demand for labor. When the pea season
is over around Tracy, there is nothing for the
workers to do but move along to some other
crop in need of harvest.
And this camp program does not touch the
problem of an oversupply of casual farm labor.
When a grower has a crop about ready for
harvesting he wants to be sure of an adequate
labor supply. So he advertises extensively,
so extensively that twice as many persons show
up as there are jobs.
The Stanford students who visited the camp
Sunday saw invaluable assistance being given
to the migrant worker. Also they saw the limi
tations on this particular type of assistance.
Keeping in mind the fact that the camp program
hits only at a specific aspect of the whole prob
lem of agricultural labor, they were able to
appreciate its value without harping on its
shortcomings. R. D.
