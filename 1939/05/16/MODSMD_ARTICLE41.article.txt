# COLUMNISTS AND THINGS
## 
### 
I HAVE been awed, amused and angered by several
generations of Daily columnists, but now that I my
self face the terror of a blank page and a deadline I
repent the latter emotion and feel the first grow
stronger.
All the fancy figures of speech of the demised John
Cobbs, laid end to end, would touch, I suppose, prac
tically everything in literature. I now avoid thinking
of them lest I succumb to a feeling of inferiority. Be
fore his passing he went in quite heavily for the
Bible, which was appropriate and a good example for
other columnists who will shortly step up or down
or out.
Daily columnists come and go and I, who must
read all of them every night, am sometimes grateful
that they are not like the proverbial brook. But re
gardless of the depths of their footprints on the sands
of time they all make imprints on my disposition.
John Cobbs has sweetened it somewhat with his ex
ceptionally clean copy, meticulous punctuation and
correct spelling.
Doug Jaques will never learn to spell "blonde"
(feminine, of course). He always leaves off the
final "e." And his occasional poetry—that, makes some
thing of an imprint, too. I forgive him, however,
knowing that because of his subject matter he is under
stronger compulsion to mince words than to spell them.
Larry Livingston, who must each night make his
tory and often out of thin U.P. dispatches, tortures me
nightly by arousing, simultaneously, my awe, anger,
and amusement —and also gratitude, because his col
umn is the last. I think he spends most of his wakeful
hours studying history: he can reel off historical ex
amples of this or that like a prof. Nightly I boil at
his mention of Hitler and Mussolini and wonder if
there'll be war tomorrow and then count my wife and
children on my fingers and figure out how many drafts
I will escape. If a staff member who takes R.O.T.C.
comes into the shop in uniform I will smile, at first
sadly, and then with genuine amusement when I try
to imagine him as a real Army officer.

A s . the Daily's linotype operator lam probably as
close to good literature as a beer hall pianist is to
good music. I claim no competence in judging Daily
writings for their literary worth. But I do like to
form opinions of the writers and speculate on their
measure of success after graduation, judging upon
their improvement from day to day in the Daily.
I can remember them as timid, smooth-faced fresh
men with unsteady voices, saying '"Please" and "Thank
you" very politely when first they braved the back
shop to get or return a proof. As their beards grow
and as they advance with promotion after promotion
they lose their timidity and may hazard such language
as "Here!" and simply "Okay." Then they are night
editors, associate editors, columnists, and a managing
editor and The Editor. They have full-fledged mascu
line voices, good beards, and, I suppose, hair on their
chests. They are men. They can step up to a bar
without trembling.
They also are newspapermen, which is a step one
way or the other from just men, depending on how
you look upon newspapermen. When a volume closes
we in the back shop shake hands with them in genuine
congratulation or condolence or good-bye. We know
that it has taken gruelling work to earn titles in the
masthead or the privilege of signing a column. There
have been sacrifices of pleasure and grades.
The campus, which flavors its morning coffee with
the Daily, no doubt overlooks the sentimental side of
this sheet. We workmen who put the paper to bed
each night don't. We've seen girls wipe their eyes
and fellows sniffle when the last issue with their names
in it is closed up. We think that the paper has given
to them just about, what they've given to it.
For us it's always a sad good-bye to the graduating
big-shots of a volume. There are more good wishes
than are spoken.
