The editor was explaining in staff meeting yester
day that Wednesday we put out a women's edition.
He was telling how it is with women's editions.
"If anyone in pants comes into the Shack on Wed

"Mobbed!" the women's editor bellowed. With a

He went into the Y.W.C.A.
"This is a worthy group," he said. "I admire your
causes and the way you work. I would like to join."
The Y.W.C.A. girls, a little flustered, quickly

When Dave Botsford was at Stanford, everyone
said he looked like a mouse, or like a white rat. He

ticularly the ears.
But tonight he is a man. He is back in New York,
and tonight he is going to broadcast over the radio on

ANSWERS TO HARD QUESTIONS
Why is it that Farm women home for the night
right after dinner take off their clothes and put on
something comfortable and prohibitive?
Or is that just a funny line girls give me when I
call them up at night to take them out?
Why is it Mills girls talk so much about how sup
pressed ihey are, and in the same breath say that they
have to be in at 1:30 and it's almost that now and
why don't you drive faster or I will get a lockout?
Always all in one breath.
Why is it that the Thetas never do anything you
can write about—or let on, at least, that they had done
anything you could write about.
Tlie editor of Daily Volume !I1 will pay $10 to
the persons who send in the best answers to these
questions, lie will pay the winners, that is. if they
can catch him. He is. at present, in Europe.

MICE AND MEN
When Dave Botsford was at Stanford, everyone
said he looked like a mouse, or like a white rat. He
did. He had the thin white face and the ears, par
ticularly the ears.
But tonight he is a man. He is back in New York,
and tonight he is going to broadcast over the radio on
that program on which men, en masse, debate with
women, en masse. You know, Battle of the Sexes.
It's just another Stanford Success Story.

ANSWERS TO HARD QUESTIONS
Why is it that Farm women home for the night
right after dinner take off their clothes and put on
something comfortable and prohibitive?
Or is that just a funny line girls give me when I
call them up at night to take them out?
Why is it Mills girls talk so much about how sup
pressed ihey are, and in the same breath say that they
have to be in at 1:30 and it's almost that now and
why don't you drive faster or I will get a lockout?
Always all in one breath.
Why is it that the Thetas never do anything you
can write about—or let on, at least, that they had done
anything you could write about.
Tlie editor of Daily Volume !I1 will pay $10 to
the persons who send in the best answers to these
questions, lie will pay the winners, that is. if they
can catch him. He is. at present, in Europe.

He was telling how it is with women's editions.
"If anyone in pants comes into the Shack on Wed
nesday, he will be . .
"Mobbed!" the women's editor bellowed. With a
gleam in her eye.

NATURE NOTE
They say Hitler is importing dogs into Germany.
They say it concerns the Poles.

I DON'T KNOW
He went into the Y.W.C.A.
"This is a worthy group," he said. "I admire your
causes and the way you work. I would like to join."
The Y.W.C.A. girls, a little flustered, quickly
thumbed through their constitution. There was noth
ing in it that said men couldn't join if they really
wanted to.
So he is now a member.
