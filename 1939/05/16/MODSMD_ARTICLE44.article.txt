# CAMPUS OPINION
## FILLER CARTOON'S 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
While reading my copy of the
Daily this morning I came upon a
cartoon entitled, "Mopsy." Subject
of the limning is a blackish mass
which can be roughly identified as a
female human being. Said charac
ter is standing in a bathroom and is
evidently dripping wet. The balloon
informs us of the character's cogent
observations, i.e., "Now isn't that
silly! I've taken a bath with my
clothes on."
Other cartoons by this same artist
have appeared from time to time —
evidently whenever the advertising
stall had a gaping hole to fill.
It matters not that the cartoons are
very possibly given to the Daily
along with advertising cuts or that
the emergency is most pressing—the
person or persons responsible for
the insertion of these monstrosities
owes the student body of the Uni
versity an apology.
I hope that you will see that we
get it.
