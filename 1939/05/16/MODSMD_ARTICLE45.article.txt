The Editor, Sir:
Once again this morning I notice
that Larry Livingston has regurgi
tated The Chronicle for his column,
which has declined now to a point
of ridiculous insipidity.
Let me point out that the Rowell-
Smith-Brier rag is staffed by in
competents and hotheads, and
prints virtually nothing which is fit

for your columnist to pass on to us
as "news." With regard in particu
lar to his statement, copied from
Brier this morning, that the Pope
has not made any move resembling
mediation for centuries, it will be
of interest to you all to learn that the
Pope endeavored to mediate our
holy war with Spain, for which we
were invoking the authority of the
civilized world without permission,
as well as a previous dispute between
Germany and Spain, not to mention
earlier incidents.
It should have been remembered
at least that in 1917 the Papacy
made efforts to bring to a conclu
sion the great war to save the world
for democracy. Last week Roy
Howard said the American public is
the best informed in the world: does
that mean anything to The Daily and
The Chronicle?
"Why bring that up now!"
