The Editor, Sir:
By the sound of yesterday's Bull
Session, John Cobbs has snapped
the cover on his Underwood shut
for the last time. Thus ends, prac
tically unremarked, I presume —
judging by campus inclination to
pass change unnoticed—what should
be called the most successful Bull
Session career in Daily history.
For two and a half years now,
Cobbs has filled five inches of 18-em
8-point with material often strik
ingly sage, usually sensible, and—at
worst — interesting. His weighted,
double-barrelled styles have made
the simile and metaphor practically
glorified, while his thoughtful, con
servative attitude has struck a con
genial note on the Farm.
This is no place for a euphemistic
speech; it is unnecessary. Campus

! readers, turning instinctively to the
j back page, will miss Cobbs' Bull
j Session. This is only a second short
| attempt at a Mark Antony—a speech
to bury, not to praise.
But from one who has read Bull
Session since Cobbs first tentatively
■ signed his name under it, congratu
lations for fine work.
