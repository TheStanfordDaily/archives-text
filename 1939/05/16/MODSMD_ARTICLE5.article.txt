12 IN SHOW
With the Spring Show cast re
hearsing with Art MtCue's band
yesterday, the 42 actors and singers
are once again working in Memorial
Hall under the direction of J. P.
Cahn, and Assistants Harry Muheim
and Charlie Bulotti.
On the rehearsal stage, Shirley
Jones, who has been making up
dance routines for Ram's Head pro
ductions during the last two years,
is creating a jitter-bug number
which, promises Director Cahn, will
"stop the show."
USE OLD STARS
In the workshop Johnny Paulson
is directing a crew to concoct sets
representing everything from a
transcontinental telephone conver
sation to a night club featuring a
surrealistic mural by San Salvadorc
Dilley.
Termed the acme of "screw
loose" farce by the four co-authors,
"Wake Up and Leave" will star
former Ram's Head favorites includ
ing Gerry Schreiber, Barbara
Thrasher, and Virginia Sharpc. In
the role of that "intellectual aberra
tion," Mrs. Fcatherstone, Virginia
Sharpc's antics range from breeding
Australian lung-fish to believing in
the signs of the zodiac.
Another highlight of the show is
the double-talking character, Milton
Sanzifranz, who can speak for five
minutes without saying anything.
According to Director Cahn, ability
to read music will be required to
understand the program for Ihe
show, for included in the cast list is
a character whose name is properly
pronounced as a whistle and best i
translated as "F-e-f-b-nat-b-flat-b- i
flat."
Music for the show will include 15
new songs, arranged into 18 orches
tral numbers. Band for the show will
be Art McCue's, which has been
featured in the last three Ram's Head
productions. Musical arrangements
are being prepared by Myron Birn
baum.
