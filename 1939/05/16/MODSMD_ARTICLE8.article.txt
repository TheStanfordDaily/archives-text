# Steinbeck Committee Visits Migrant Camp at Westley
## 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Looking westward across the flat,
dusty' land of the Sacramento Val
ley we could see the orderly rows
of one-room houses and tent plat
forms that were the Westley Fed
eral Migrant Labor Camp.
It was the Steinbeck Committee's
trip last. Sunday to this camp, the
nearest of those operated by the
federal government.
We were a few miles south of
Tracy, Calif., a pea-raising district.
The season's peak had passed just
a couple of weeks before, but many
of the workers already had packed
their jalopies and trailers and had
left, in search of other work.
Only 45 families were left, the
assistant director told us, in the
camp which can hold as many as
300 families.
COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
The community buildings—meet
ing hall, laundry building, and
small clinic —and the neat pre-lab
ricated houses contrasted sharply
with the rickety packing-box shacks
to be found alsewhere- in the valley.
It cost the government $35 to put
up each of those houses, the young
assistant director said. When the
crop is ready for harvesting and the
migrants begin to arrive, the first
ones get the houses, later ones must
take tent platforms.
NO RENT
No rent is charged, he explained,
but each family pays 10 cents a day
into a sort of commuiiity fund, spent
according to decisions made by rep
resentatives of the migrants them-

] selves. The money goes mostly for
: balls and bats lor Sunday baseball
j games and for community dances on
Saturday night.
If a family can't afford this fee,
the sum can be worked oil around
the camp at the rate of 40 cents
i an hour.
WIHTE-IIAIRKI) MAN
What kind of people live in the
Westley Camp? The way to find out
I is to talk it over with two or three
!of them, for example, the spare,
! white-haired man standing silently
'on his front porch watching the
i young fellows playing soft ball.
"They may be a little fast for me
, at baseball," he says, "but. when it
comes to picking peas I can still
i beat the lot of them."
I He's been on the road five years
. now, he says. Traveled back and
! forth across the western United
: States quite a few times since the
! day when, with his wife and 12
| children, he had left his land in
Arkansas.
EYE BANDAGED
His wife, a large, capable looking
woman, comes out. of the house with
several children. The 8-year-old
1 boy, youngest in the family, has his
i eye bandaged because he was hit
there with a clod the day before.
He smiles. It doesn't hurt much, he
says.
What do they do in the winter?
Sometimes they go up into the
mountains to chop wood lor four
months, the wife says. "It's beau
tiful up there, and the air is so cool.'
We'll be leaving again pretty soon i
for the mountains. Next year we'll
be back here again.'
A few doors away another woman I
sits on her porch chewing tobacco,
shaded from the Sunday afternoon
sun. There is a lead wedding ring
on her finger, given her once by
the man who is inside with the three
children.
FRIENDLY WOMAN
She is friendly, offers a cold drink
of water. She's from Arkansas —
Blue Ridge Mountains section. When '
farming became harder and harder
and gradually impossible, the fam
ily moved down into the cotton i
district and became tenant farmers,
"share - croppers." Mechanization
there put them on the road. She
takes another chew of tobacco.
This family has been in Califor
nia only three months, so any relief
grants they get are from the FSA. i
For families who have been in the
state more than a year, aid cOmes I
from the State Relief Administra
tion. About twice a month the
ones under SRA drive to Stockton
for their allotments.
Asked what incomes these fami- j
lies had before becoming migrants,!
the assistant director said that most i
of them made around $450 in good
times on their Oklahoma and Ar-

Kansas farms. In bad times, this
figure dropped to around $250 a
year.
Most of them sufTer from malnu
trition, he said. Left to themselves,
they eat mostly beans, bacon, and
sourdough. Part of the camp's re
habilitation program is a scries of
evening talks on cooking and diet
etics. For one thing, the women are
gradually being persuaded to in
clude fruit, and fresh vegetables in
the diet. 1
