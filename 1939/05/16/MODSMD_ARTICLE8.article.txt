# Steinbeck Committee Visits Migrant Camp at Westley
## 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Looking westward across the flat,
dusty' land of the Sacramento Val
ley we could see the orderly rows
of one-room houses and tent plat
forms that were the Westley Fed
eral Migrant Labor Camp.
It was the Steinbeck Committee's
trip last. Sunday to this camp, the
nearest of those operated by the
federal government.
We were a few miles south of
Tracy, Calif., a pea-raising district.
The season's peak had passed just
a couple of weeks before, but many
of the workers already had packed
their jalopies and trailers and had
left, in search of other work.
Only 45 families were left, the
assistant director told us, in the
camp which can hold as many as
300 families.
COMMUNITY BUILDINGS
The community buildings—meet
ing hall, laundry building, and
small clinic —and the neat pre-lab
ricated houses contrasted sharply
with the rickety packing-box shacks
to be found alsewhere- in the valley.
It cost the government $35 to put
up each of those houses, the young
assistant director said. When the
crop is ready for harvesting and the
migrants begin to arrive, the first
ones get the houses, later ones must
take tent platforms.
NO RENT
No rent is charged, he explained,
but each family pays 10 cents a day
into a sort of commuiiity fund, spent
according to decisions made by rep
resentatives of the migrants them-

] selves. The money goes mostly for
: balls and bats lor Sunday baseball
j games and for community dances on
Saturday night.
If a family can't afford this fee,
the sum can be worked oil around
the camp at the rate of 40 cents
i an hour.
WIHTE-IIAIRKI) MAN
What kind of people live in the
Westley Camp? The way to find out
I is to talk it over with two or three
!of them, for example, the spare,
! white-haired man standing silently
'on his front porch watching the
i young fellows playing soft ball.
"They may be a little fast for me
, at baseball," he says, "but. when it
comes to picking peas I can still
i beat the lot of them."
I He's been on the road five years
. now, he says. Traveled back and
! forth across the western United
: States quite a few times since the
! day when, with his wife and 12
| children, he had left his land in
Arkansas.
EYE BANDAGED
His wife, a large, capable looking
woman, comes out. of the house with
several children. The 8-year-old
1 boy, youngest in the family, has his
i eye bandaged because he was hit
there with a clod the day before.
He smiles. It doesn't hurt much, he
says.
What do they do in the winter?
Sometimes they go up into the
mountains to chop wood lor four
months, the wife says. "It's beau
