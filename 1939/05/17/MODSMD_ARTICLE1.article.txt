### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
r |M-lIS morning a man named Al
bert Windsor and his wife, the
former Elizabeth Bowee-Lyon, will
set foot on the soil of Canada —and
history will be made. For the first
time a reigning king and queen of
England will visit the New World.
Quebec, so charmingly and unap
propriated Gallic, will welcome
George VI to the Dominion today.
From there he will tour rapidly the
key cities of eastern Canada and
pay a hasty call on the United
States.
Two days in Washington as the
guests of the President, a visit to
New York to realize Grover Whal
en's supreme achievement, and a
breather at Ilyde Park—the trip
seems hardly worth the effort.
* * *
J JOWEVER, there is a great deal
more meaning to this journey
than greets the eye in pomp and
circumstance. Why, in a year when
Europe is flirting with war, does the
King desert his post to travel to
America?
Not to see the Dionne quintuplets,
Ihe trylon, or the perisphere, but to
make sure that the bond between
the United Sattes and Britain is
strong and will not fail in case of
emergency. A common language,
similar political institutions, and an
intangible spirit of sympathy—these
are the strands from which the cable
is woven.
* Jjt s,'t
In the last analysis George VI
is really little more than a highly
paid civil servant. He is hired by
the government to act as the focal
point for the patriotism and na
tional pride that are so strong in
Britain. Cabinets and Parliaments
rise and fall with* the tide of poli
tics, but the monarchy is perma
nent and stable.
In perfect harmony with the Eng
lish character is this dependability
of the Crown. Politically the king
ship is a vestigal organ, but psy
chologically it is indispensable to
the success of the island nation.
* * *
r visit of the King and Queen
is extremely flattering to Amer
ican ego. To a country where every
shabby-genteel peer is lionized on
the strength of his social position,
this is the most graceful move that
Great Britain could make. In a
sense, she has sent us something
that, surpasses the tangible, the man
who is the personification of the
most intense and understanding
patriotism in the world.
When we hear of the elaborate
accommodations and the expensive
entertainment that are being ar
ranged for King George and
Queen Elizabeth, we must not
pass them off as trumpery and
snobbishness. For they represent
the guaranty of a vital alliance in
the war that is to come.
* n< *
With England bending over back
ward to secure Soviet Russia as an
ally, her drive to secure a solid line
up against the fascist states is ob
vious. Yesterday she offered to en
ter into a mutual aggression pact
with the U.S.S.R., guaranteeing Hid
in case of attack from Germany but
making no commitments regarding a
Japanese invasion.
Neville Chamberlain is doing his
part to secure support for Britain
from the East. The West, an easier
and subtler job, has been left in
the hands of the King. England is
voyaging to America to make sure
that the trans-Atlantic bond is un
breakable.

that, surpasses the tangible, the man
who is the personification of the
most intense and understanding
patriotism in the world.
When we hear of the elaborate
accommodations and the expensive
entertainment that are being ar
ranged for King George and
Queen Elizabeth, we must not
pass them off as trumpery and
snobbishness. For they represent
the guaranty of a vital alliance in
the war that is to come.

With England bending over back
ward to secure Soviet Russia as an
ally, her drive to secure a solid line
up against the fascist states is ob
vious. Yesterday she offered to en
ter into a mutual aggression pact
with the U.S.S.R., guaranteeing Hid
in case of attack from Germany but
making no commitments regarding a
Japanese invasion.
Neville Chamberlain is doing his
part to secure support for Britain
from the East. The West, an easier
and subtler job, has been left in
the hands of the King. England is
voyaging to America to make sure
that the trans-Atlantic bond is un
breakable.
r |M-lIS morning a man named Al
bert Windsor and his wife, the
former Elizabeth Bowee-Lyon, will
set foot on the soil of Canada —and
history will be made. For the first
time a reigning king and queen of
England will visit the New World.
Quebec, so charmingly and unap
propriated Gallic, will welcome
George VI to the Dominion today.
From there he will tour rapidly the
key cities of eastern Canada and
pay a hasty call on the United
States.
Two days in Washington as the
guests of the President, a visit to
New York to realize Grover Whal
en's supreme achievement, and a
breather at Ilyde Park—the trip
seems hardly worth the effort.
* * *
J JOWEVER, there is a great deal
more meaning to this journey
than greets the eye in pomp and
circumstance. Why, in a year when
Europe is flirting with war, does the
King desert his post to travel to
America?
Not to see the Dionne quintuplets,
Ihe trylon, or the perisphere, but to
make sure that the bond between
the United Sattes and Britain is
strong and will not fail in case of
emergency. A common language,
similar political institutions, and an
intangible spirit of sympathy—these
are the strands from which the cable
is woven.
* Jjt s,'t
In the last analysis George VI
is really little more than a highly
paid civil servant. He is hired by
the government to act as the focal
point for the patriotism and na
tional pride that are so strong in
Britain. Cabinets and Parliaments
rise and fall with* the tide of poli
tics, but the monarchy is perma
nent and stable.
In perfect harmony with the Eng
lish character is this dependability
of the Crown. Politically the king
ship is a vestigal organ, but psy
chologically it is indispensable to
the success of the island nation.
* * *
r visit of the King and Queen
is extremely flattering to Amer
ican ego. To a country where every
shabby-genteel peer is lionized on
the strength of his social position,
this is the most graceful move that
Great Britain could make. In a
sense, she has sent us something
that, surpasses the tangible, the man
who is the personification of the
most intense and understanding
patriotism in the world.
