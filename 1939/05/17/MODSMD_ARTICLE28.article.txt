# 'No Sporting Blood,' Says Unchallenged Turtle Owner
## 
### BUD AMES 
The Farm no longer thrills to the thunder of racing hoofs across the
campus. Her sporting lilood is dead. Only the julep remains. Here it
lias been two days now and no owner has come forward to challenge the
Stojkovich-Weiner entry, Bessie Humble.
"Why no. mister, Bessie's not a , she's a turtle."'

> In the strictest confidence, hop
ing to boost racing odds, Trainer
Joe Weiner, who in his spare time
is an Encina sponsor, yesterday af
ternoon released first track-side
dope concerning his spirited charger.
"Bessie is in top condition,"
Weiner whispered. "Andy, the co
owner, and I giye her a work-out
and run her through a maze every
around the room somewhere. All
athletes have to keep in condition,
day. Right now she is resting
you know."
PARTNER FOR BESSIE'
When questioned as to the name
and purpose of a morning-after
green turtle gurgling around a
water-filled beer mug, Weiner
stated that the animal in question
kept Bessie from getting "lonely,"
and was named "Panther Body."
"Andy and I purchased Bessie up
at the Barn Dance at Lagunita, and
some nice girl just gave us Panther-
Body. But both of the turtles are
happy. We feed them on moths,
flies, and spiders that we catch
around the room. The bugs have to
be alive because neither Bessie nor
Panther Body will eat a dead ani
mal.
"Yes, we have had a couple of
challenges," Joe sadly confideded,
"but; they were only in fun. The
D.U.'s mentioned something about a
race, and some girl challenged us,
but they both backed down. We
a?e still looking for a race—any
time and anywhere."
KIDNAPPED!
Whereupon-proud Trainer Weiner
began to search the corners for his
wandering Bessie Rumble. The
search proved fruitless. Bessie could
not be found. "I'll bet she's been
kidnapped," Joe roared and his
speech became more excited.
As the door closed, he was still
searching for poor Bessie, and
mumbling, "Boy, Andy is sure go
ing to be mad when he finds out
somebody kidnapped Bessie. Boy,
Andy is sure going to be sore.
Gosh!"

searching for poor Bessie, and
mumbling, "Boy, Andy is sure go
ing to be mad when he finds out
somebody kidnapped Bessie. Boy,
Andy is sure going to be sore.
Gosh!"
The Farm no longer thrills to the thunder of racing hoofs across the
campus. Her sporting lilood is dead. Only the julep remains. Here it
lias been two days now and no owner has come forward to challenge the
Stojkovich-Weiner entry, Bessie Humble.
"Why no. mister, Bessie's not a , she's a turtle."'

> In the strictest confidence, hop
ing to boost racing odds, Trainer
Joe Weiner, who in his spare time
is an Encina sponsor, yesterday af
ternoon released first track-side
dope concerning his spirited charger.
"Bessie is in top condition,"
Weiner whispered. "Andy, the co
owner, and I giye her a work-out
and run her through a maze every
around the room somewhere. All
athletes have to keep in condition,
day. Right now she is resting
you know."
PARTNER FOR BESSIE'
When questioned as to the name
and purpose of a morning-after
green turtle gurgling around a
water-filled beer mug, Weiner
stated that the animal in question
kept Bessie from getting "lonely,"
and was named "Panther Body."
"Andy and I purchased Bessie up
at the Barn Dance at Lagunita, and
some nice girl just gave us Panther-
Body. But both of the turtles are
happy. We feed them on moths,
flies, and spiders that we catch
around the room. The bugs have to
be alive because neither Bessie nor
Panther Body will eat a dead ani
mal.
"Yes, we have had a couple of
challenges," Joe sadly confideded,
"but; they were only in fun. The
D.U.'s mentioned something about a
race, and some girl challenged us,
but they both backed down. We
a?e still looking for a race—any
time and anywhere."
KIDNAPPED!
Whereupon-proud Trainer Weiner
began to search the corners for his
wandering Bessie Rumble. The
search proved fruitless. Bessie could
not be found. "I'll bet she's been
kidnapped," Joe roared and his
speech became more excited.
As the door closed, he was still
searching for poor Bessie, and
mumbling, "Boy, Andy is sure go
ing to be mad when he finds out
somebody kidnapped Bessie. Boy,
Andy is sure going to be sore.
