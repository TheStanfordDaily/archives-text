Vocational Committee's files are not i
limited to those students profes- j
sionally undecided, according to j
Gretchen Gillespie, chairman of Vo- '
cational Committee.
Women who have already set j
their vocational courses will find I
much helpful material in the files.
Various specialized training schools
have forwarded pamphlets and there
are numerous letters from employ
ers in the various fields stating what
training they consider most valuable
to enter their respective professions.
Illustrating the completeness of!
the files, some examples of their!
