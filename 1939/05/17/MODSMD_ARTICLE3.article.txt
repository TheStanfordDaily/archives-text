Other Ex Committee business last
night follows:
GLEE CLUB MERGER: Stanford
does not have sufficient interest in
music to support two glee clubs.
Committeemen agreed to this as they
approved an application by Men's
and Women's Glee Clubs to be con
solidated into one organization.
According to Herb Woolley, Men's
Glee Club manager, who presented
the plan, choral singing on the cam
pus is not given sufficient adminis
tration support to bring out the
necessary 40 men and 40 women for
two clubs.
Instead of being hired by the ad
ministration, the director is paid by
the Associated Students, Woolley
pointed out.
Also, no University credit is given
for Glee Club work, although credit
is given for such activities as band,
debate, and dramatics, he explained.
"All we have to work for is the
joy of singing," he said.
LECTURE SERIES: With such
speakers available as H. R. Knicker

Presenting the plan, President
H. B. Lee suggested that books of
tickets good for three lectures be
sold at a reduced rate, with tickets

consideration at a later meeting, so
the whole program can be outlined
this quarter.

GLEE CLUB MERGER: Stanford
does not have sufficient interest in
music to support two glee clubs.
Committeemen agreed to this as they
approved an application by Men's
and Women's Glee Clubs to be con
solidated into one organization.
According to Herb Woolley, Men's
Glee Club manager, who presented
the plan, choral singing on the cam
pus is not given sufficient adminis
tration support to bring out the
necessary 40 men and 40 women for
two clubs.
Instead of being hired by the ad
ministration, the director is paid by
the Associated Students, Woolley
pointed out.
Also, no University credit is given
for Glee Club work, although credit
is given for such activities as band,
debate, and dramatics, he explained.
"All we have to work for is the
joy of singing," he said.
