## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Cindermen Get Extra Day To Train for Conference Tilt 
### 
Because the trials for the Coast Conference Meet in Seattle have heen
moved up to Saturday morning, Stanford's journeying cindermen will not
leave for the North until Thursday afternoon and will therefore run
through their twilight meet as usual this afternoon.
The trials were earlier scheduled for Friday, necessitating the squad's

leaving today. But now that the<
tracksters have this extra day. Dink
Templeton has been given a fine
chance to choose those deserving
the trip. Thirteen men have been
definitely picked and the remaining
five will be named for their per
formances this afternoon.
So Stanford track fans will have
an opportunity to see the possible
Coast Conference champions per
forming at their best this evening
just before their Northern invasion.
Ternpleton's men have at least an
even chance to finally take the Tro
jans for those northern stars, though
not sensational in all events, are go
ing to take points where it hurts
U.S.C. the most.
NORTHERN SPRINTERS
Washington State has a pair of
sprinters, Lee Orr and Curt Led
ford, who have marks approaching
9.5 and 20.5 and who will, Tem
pleton hopes, not necessarily beat
Clyde Jeffrey, but nose out Troy's
Jordan, Anderson, and Willis. Then
I here is Jack Emigh of Montana,
who has beaten both of these boys
and is bound to enter the picture
somewhere.
Washington State also presents a
quarter-miler who might bust up
the monopoly held by Trojans Miller
and Upton in every meet they have
been in so far this year. The gen
tleman's name is Mel Pettichord,
who won the 440 in last week's
Northern Division Conference Meet
without the least competition in
48.1.
The mighty Zamperini will run
into plenty of trouble up North in
both the mile and 880. First he must
beat Girard of Stanford, Cole of
Cal, and Dixon Garner of W.S.C.,
who last week won the mile in
4:16.4. Then. Louie will have to face
Bill Dale, another Cougar and Ore
gon's Kerm Storli, who ran a 1:52.1
hall' in that order and a stride apart
last Saturday.
STRONG IN FIELD
And on the field the Northerners
are strong in the two events that the
Trojans seemed to have cinched.
Namely, the pole vault and the jave
lin where U.S.C.'s domain will be
invaded by Oregon's great, vaulter,
George Varoff and Boyd Brown, a
234-foot javelin thrower.
The trackmen who have already
been named for the trip to Seattle
are Hiserman (C), Jeffrey, Hawkins,
Simpson, Williamson, Girard, Wohle,
Andersen, Zagar, Pool, Braheny, Lin
coln, and Wulff. Those that must
prove their worth tomorrow in or
der to catch that train are Carew,
Rockwell, Johnson, Moore, Eman
uel, Grey, Grannis, Christenson,
Brown, Kenyon, Houston a,nd Coro
nett.
