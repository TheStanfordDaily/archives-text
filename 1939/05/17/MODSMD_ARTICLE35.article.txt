# Waterpoloists To Face Grads
## Annual Tilt to Start In Encina Pools, 4:30 
### 
One of the headline events in
spring water polo takes place this
afternoon in the Encina pools at 4:30
o'clock with the annual meeting of
the next year's varsity with gradu
ating seniors and alumni.
The game will undoubtedly be
one of the best ever fought in the
home pools. Coach Nort Thornton's
1940 varsity men are rounding into
form after several weeks of spring
practice, and the alums are bringing
back an array of waterslashers that
would put fear into any man.
WIGET TO STAR
For the past week the senior-alum
combine has been taking the varsity
in informal practice sessions. An
other blow to the varsity will be
the absence of Dick Hoover, guard,
because of a bad case of poison oak.
Of the alumni, the most outstand
ing will be Wally Wiget, star of some
years ago and known as the trickiest
ball handler and manhandler ever
to hit the game of water polo. Any
game with Wiget participating will
assuredly be fast, tough, and exciting
for spectators, though possibly a
little hard on the opposition.
OTHER PLAYERS
Other past master poloists com
peting will be Bob Hoover, Bill
Hanna, Johnny Lamb, Don Peterson,
Harvey Rothschild, Bob Haslacher,
John Shallenberger, Hal Weatherbe,
Bill Hatch, and Lloyd Wilson.
The varsity squad will probably
be made up of Captain-elect Bob
Plate, Ted Moreno, Roy Vitousek,
members of last year's second-string
and freshman squads.
Women will not be admitted to the
game.
