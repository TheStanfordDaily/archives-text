I
I With half the matches in the all-
University golf tournament played,
j eight pairings will be played off to
| day to complete the first round.
Yesterday's matches saw the var
j sity and frosh divotmen recover their
j equilibrium and, with one exception,
I defeat the underdogs. The only up
| set was Frank Scheble's 2 and 1
win over Pete Jones. Jones had
1 qualified with a 75, while Scheble
j only had an 82.
| Ray Watson, one of the better
! divot-diggers and member of last
j year's varsity, took the win over
Harris Flannery 5 and 4. Bill Brig
j ham, new member of the varsity,
| kept his good start by defeating Dud
j Smith 6 and 4.
I Coach Eddie Twiggs has set today
as the deadline for the other matches
! as the second-round play must start
I tomorrow.
