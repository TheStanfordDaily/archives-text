Tin: PROBLEM of how to create ]
; a large enough gang to defeat !
I Southern California in the Coast I
! Conference track meet this week- J
j end is getting harder to solve all !
the time.
If you were to take out your
: pencil and paper and start a rough ;
j estimate, it wouldn't take you very [
j long to see what the Trojans have
J in their own defense. Louis Zam
| perini will win any of the two j
I events which he enters. Dixie Gar- ,
j ner, the Washington State ace, might
I press the great Zamp in the two- i
I mile, but both of them will already I
| have run a mile. Garner will try !
I to beat the Trojan down the stretch j
j as so many others have done this j
! year. And he probably will get so j
I tied up doing it that Zamperini 1
land possibly Girard, Vollmer, and!
i Sadaj may all beat him in. his eight- j
! lap specialty.
Garner is a brilliant two-miler, j
i capable of so if Ih> runs across j
these words of wisdom and gives I
them the proper heed, he will con- |
1 tent himself with a bit part in the I
mile and then go after the Trojan
in the longer race, where he |
I should be unbeatable. If he beats !
Zamperini out of a first place, the J
Indians can come that closer to
: winning the meet.

WHAT MAKES the Stanford sit
uation so good is the fact that the j
first place points that we have seem
to be just about untouchable, Clyde J
Jeffrey will win two firsts, Pete j
Zagar will win the discus with Hamp
Pool second or third, Stan Anderson j
and Bill Wohle will once again go
one-two in the shot without much
effort, Bill Hawkins will do no worse
than second in the high hurdles and
even has the stuff to beat the Tro
jan Humphrey.
Mushy Girard will place twice in j
his two times up with a possible
first place in either the two-mile or
880, depending on the aforemen
tioned Garner-Zamperini feud. Stan
Hiserman seems like a sure shot for
second in the low hurdles, while â– 
Dick Simpson is still good enough j
| for third or fourth behind Hum
| phrey and Hawkins. Because of
| ailing leg conditions, Sid Hayes, Russ i
Wulff, and Ray Brown, hurdler, I
high jumper, and broad jumper, re- !
spectively, must be counted out of !
contention.
Wulff lias never approached his
stand-out performances of his I

freshman year when lie was gen
erally conceded to he as good or
better than Lcs Steers, the San
Mateo high ceiling expert. He's
only a junior now, however, and
with the springiest legs and near
perfect form, he could very eas
ily make a come-back in one of
the big meets this year.
Brown and Hayes really did ex
pert jobs in "cracking up." Brown
was in the hospital for five days
after the Trojan meet before he
could even walk again but wants
another crack at Bromfield and
Laret of S.C. in the conference set
to. The best mark up north is under
23 feet; so Brown, on a good day,
is capable of second place behind
Manuel of California and can even
take the first.
But it's hardly fair to count points
as questionable as those in a con
ference meet.

PUT THE Indian sure-fire points
all together and you get a sum ap
proximating 50 digits. The Trojans
have six cinch firsts from Zamper
ini, (2), Humphrey, Vickery, Peo
ples, and either Carter or Day.
Their total in seconds and worse de
pends on the ability of the Norse
men to exceed all their previous
bests. And that's where Stanford
starts plugging for the northern
division.
