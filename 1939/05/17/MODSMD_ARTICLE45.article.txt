# On Their Shoulders
## 
### 
TONIGHT will determine largely the success
of student body government at Stanford next
year.
Leadership Institute, for which little more
explanation of purpose is necessary than has
been given formerly, meets for the first time.
There, old and new student leaders will meet
to hear Dr. Hand as a specialist in student gov
ernment outline ideas and ideals, pass on to the
officers-elect some of the bases on which stu
dent government is founded.
On cursory examination, student government
is a simple thing. It is 268 pages in the hand
book. It is an office staff of three clerks in the
A.S.S.U. office. It is a student manager; it is a
student president. It is also many other things.
It is The Daily. It is the fraternities and sorori
ties. It is the Honor Code. It is Stanford de
mocracy.
All of these and many more things are a part
of student government.
Most important of its functions is to assume
the responsibility for student affairs and activi
ties that otherwise would be under the direct
supervision of the University.
Viewed philosophically, student government
is also an assumption of restraint.
Practically, it teaches democracy at Stanford.
As long as democracy is functioning at this
University, student government will be the ma
chinery that makes it operate.
Thus, when student officers assume their
duties, they become a part of a broad concept
that is impossible for them to visualize as long
as they obtain no broader view of their govern
ment than the narrow routine of their individual
offices.
Tonight's lecture, the meetings of the Insti
tute that will follow it, will give next year's
leaders an opportunity to see the entire picture.
If they grasp it, they will have a hold on student
government that other groups of officers have
not yet had.
It's in their power to do so—if they will open
their eyes and take a good, long look first.
