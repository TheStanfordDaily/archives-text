# A.S.S.U. Lecture Series
## 
### 
IT looks as though Stanford will have a full
fledged lecture series next year, comparable
to its successful Concert Series.
Ex Committee made tentative plans last night,
expecting to get the program ready to go and
the tickets printed this year. Three speakers
is the numbered considered most satisfactory
—one a guarter.
Lest anyone think Ex Committee is rushing
into anything in making such definite plans, it
should be recognized that two lectures held this
year were conducted with the idea that they
should serve as soundings of campus enthu
siasm for paid admission lectures.
When John Gunther appeared there was a
big turn-out and the lecture made a profit.
But Vincent Sheean spoke to a greatly re
duced audience, and the project went into the
red. Some blamed the loss on choice of date—
it was too busy a night, they said.
Others blamed widespread dissatisfaction
with Mr. Gunther's adderss on grounds he sen
sationalized his talk too much and failed to
document his statements sufficiently.
The idea of a lecture series is a good one.
But its first year will be a crucial one. Only by
obtaining top-notch speakers with a large meas
ure of box-office appeal can students and Palo
Altans be convinced that the lecture series
ticket book is one of the things they should buy
on fall guarter Reg Day.
If this year's lectures are successful, students
will buy season tickets on Reg Day with no
more reluctance than they show now in paying
for Quad, Chappie, and Concert Series.—R. D.
