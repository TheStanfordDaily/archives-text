# In the Academic Line

### 
CLOSE to the end of next week the time
schedule will make its quarterly appear
ance, and the student body will cast through
the pages for its quota of pipes and require
ments.
With a tentative schedule in mind, freshmen
will preregister, and upper division students
will dismiss the subject until Reg Day next fall.
Then, between asking and answering, "Have a
good summer?" they will scribble programs
that will satisfy their advisers, and forget about
the problem for another quarter.
Engineering, basic medical sciences, and a
few other majors allow little leeway in choosing
courses, but the liberal arts fields give students
an almost unlimited selection.
This freedom could be used to assure sched
ules designed to fit varying interests, but it usu

ally results in blind choices and unsystematized
programs.
Prime difficulty under the present set-up is a
lack of long-range planning. Few majors in the
Schools of Letters and Social Sciences know
what classes they are going to take from quar
ter to quarter. The Announcement of Courses,
obtainable free at the Administration Building,
is an almost unknown document.
Making selections is not easy. Whether to
base them primarily on the reputation of the
professor or on the material covered is always
a problem. Conflicts in hours and excess units
are almost inevitable.
Nevertheless, we are paying $115 a quarter
to attend the University. A student who jumps
from department to department looking for
pipes and neglecting the development of his
interests is wasting his money.
An hour or so spent with a copy of the An
nouncement of Courses plus an appointment
with one's adviser will result in a well-inte
grated program for the next year.
Without such long-range planning, the liberal
arts departments can turn out only jacks of all
trades and masters of none.â€”L. L.
