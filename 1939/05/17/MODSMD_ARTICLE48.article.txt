# BULL SESSION
## 
### GRAHAM STUART 
Second sues! columnist, Dr. Stuart, professor of
political science, is an expert in international af
fairs and an authority on Latin America. Today,
he writes Bull Session with an eye to the obvious
and presents an exposition of what Stanford doesn't
know—how important it is as an institution for
training men and women for diplomatic service.—
