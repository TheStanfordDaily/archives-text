'TUIIS column has long both interested me and in
trigued me. It offers such a rare opportunity to
the scribe with a latent instinct of reform to point out
the glaring weaknesses of his fellow beings. Many a
time when a student's car has cut in on Lasuen or has
parked in front of the post office so as to make it as
difficult as possible for others to use space which is
wasted I have wondered whether a session on cour
tesy in driving and parking might not be appropriate
and useful.
On other occasions the column makes it possible for
the interested party to seek for understanding on the
whys and wherefores of actions seemingly incompre
hensible. For example, on the subject of polls of
public opinion, why was a class of over 200 upper
division students who are studying specifically the
problems of neutrality and American foreign policy
overlooked a second time in a poll representing the
student body's reaction to this very question?
But perhaps best of all the column offers an oppor
tunity to bring to the attention of its readers matters
and developments in the University or outside which
might otherwise be overlooked. A visit to my office
this morning of Orray Taft, a former Stanford stu
dent who is now a member of the American Foreign
Service stationed in Warsaw, brought to mind the fine
representation that Stanford has in this service. In
the last annual examination two Stanford men, Both
well and Henderson, were successful out of the hun
dreds of well prepared candidates who presented
themselves.
AT the present time five Stanford students are serv
ing in the Department of State, Harry Turkel in
the Treaty Division, Theodore Achilles in the Division
of European Affairs, James K. Penfield in the Division
of Far Eastern Affairs, Willard Barbour in the Divi
sion of American Republics, and Elizabeth Clarke as
a clerk in the section working on refugee problems.

jj In the field service Norman Davis, President Roo
fsevelt's ambassador at large, heads the list of the
career officers. Frances Willis, top career woman in
the service, is second diplomatic secrtary in Brussels;
Elbridge Durbrow is consul in Naples; Willard More
land is vice consul in Bordeaux; Robert McClintock
third secretary in Ciudad Trujillo; and Roswell Bever-
Jstock vice consul in Belfast. Of the more recent re-
Jcruits John Jernegan is vice consul in Barcelona;
fPhilip Williams in Rio de Janeiro; William Belton in
Havana; and George West in Windsor.
President Roosevelt's last reorganization order,
which places commercial and agricultural attaches in
'the foreign service, bolh enlarges and extends the pos-
Isibilities of the career service. Formerly a diplomat
was said to be an honest man sent, abroad to lie for
|his country. Today in this era of international an
archy the diplomatic service is the government's first
[line of defense. It is a service that requires ability,
'character, and personality. Stanford in Ihe past decade
!has made a good beginning in its representation in
.the Foreign Service—it is a fine tradition to maintain.
