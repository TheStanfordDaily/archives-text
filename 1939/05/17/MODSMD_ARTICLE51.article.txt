They say that, one of the freshmen was writing a
paper on smuggling, and had to do a little reference
work on it. He looked up his subject in the card cata
logue, and on nearly every card he saw the words,
"Library of Congress." He started looking for the
Library of Congress. He couldn't find it alone, so he
asked one of the librarians.
"The Library of Congress?" the librarian said. "I
don't know where it is." (You can see this librarian
scratching his head and looking around. "Why, it was
just here a minute ago.")
"Hey, Joe," he said to a fellow librarian, "where's
the Library of Congress?"
> The second librarian gave the freshman the tradi
tional library stall. "Try the Felton Library," he said.
The freshman asked a third librarian where is the
Library of Congress. He had to find the Library of
oCngrcss if it look all night.
I A.s he found out from iho third librarian, it would
take more than all night. Even in an airplane he
couldn't get to Washington, D.C., in a night.
