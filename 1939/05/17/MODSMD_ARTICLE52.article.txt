# 'Dark Victory' Gives Davis Chance to Act
## 
### 
"DARK VICTORY," now play- j
ing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
Just as "Of Human Bondage,"
"Dangerous," and "Jezebel" be
longed to eßtte Davis alone, so too
does "Dark Victory" exist for the i
sole purpose of giving the first lady |
of the screen a chance to act.
A consistently effective plot, aided!
by a good script and thoughtful di
recting, becomes a very considerable ;
choice for 1939's list of ten best :
motion pictures.
And, unless Helen Hayes returns!
to the screen before next Christmas, |
it becomes the vehicle which should |
bring to Bette Davis her third Acad- J
emy Award.
HAS "GUTTY" ROLE
Miss Davis plays the role of Judie
Trahern, a spoiled Long Island rich
girl, for everything that the part of
fers her. Always best when playing
what she terms "gutty" girls, this
role is no exception.
The situation is that of a society
girl, headstrong, scornful of any
but her own decisions, finally driv- '
en by recurrent headaches, dizzi- I
ness and impaired vision to seek:
dreaded medical advice.
She, of course, falls in love with j
the handsome brain surgeon; play- !
ed, of course, by George Brent. The!
catch is tht he knows she will die j
within a few months, and is too I
much in love with her to tell her so. |
TOP DRAMATIC SCENE
The sequence in which she inad
vertently discovers the hopeless na
luve of her case is perhaps the
quietest, coldest, most brutal scene
in recent cinema history. The se
quence which follows, in which she
cynically tells the doctor he enn go
to hell, is perhaps the most dra
matic scene in any picture this year.
Miss Davis handles both superbly.
This picture does not, end happily.
Physically, it is tragedy from the
opening scene. Tragedy, that is, in
sofar as death is tragic.
But playing behind the theme of
imminent death is a spiritual qual- j
ity unique in motion pictures — a j
quality which will leave you a little j
more in awe of life and death — j
