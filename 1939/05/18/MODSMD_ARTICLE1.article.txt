### JEAN NOWELL 
|>RITAIN never breaks a promise,
but that is because she never
makes a promise. Those to whom
she pledges her solemn word are
apt to find themselves, at times of
crisis, citing British pacts and agree
ments full of words which have
more meanings than meet the
straightforward mind. Yesterday an
other trusting set of souls lost their
girlish laughter.
For yesterday Zionist Jews found
that the 1917 Balfour Declaration
which they had assumed promised
the Jews a national home in Pales
tine, really does no such thing, but
actually states "that such a home
should be founded in Palestine."
This subtly worded phrase now it
seems, gives England the right to
let down the 402,000 Jews who are
now living in the Holy Land.

The official white paper issued
yesterday, which set forth a "final
plan" for establishment of an
Arab state in Palestine within the
next ten years, and limitation of
Jewish emigrants to one-third
the total population, brought im- !
mediate condemnation from Zion
ist leaders who termed it "a Brit
ish surrender to moslem terror
ism."
Backing the three-point resistance
plan put forth by the Jewish Agency
for Palestine, representative of
world Jewry, came reports of more
violent action by Jews actually in
Palestine. In Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv the British government's im
migration headquarters were shat
tered by bombs and gutted by fire
a few hours before the beginning of
a general strike scheduled as a pro
test against the new British plan for
the future of the Holy Land.

fUST why the British nave let the
•* Jews down can be traced back to
the man who is the greatest single
enemy the so-called non-Aryan race
has today—Adolf Hitler. For yester
day came Neville Chamberlain's in
timation that Great Britain is anx
ious to weld the moslem world into
a solid bloc, giving the Anglo-French
"Peace Front" the potential backing
of 21 nations in either active or
passive role's.
Back in 1!)17 when Lord Bal
four declared for the "nation
al home" there was no sccret
about the fact that it was done
purely to aid the British in the
war. At the same time, the Arabs
were promised independence, and
for the same reason. The war was
won and then came the embar
rassing problems of just exactly
what was meant by both state
ments, and where the two poli
cies elbowed each other, which
was to get the right of way.
* *
Britain, up to the present, has
maintained that the Arabian inde
pendence cannot come west, of the
Jordan. But the Arabs have never
been able to see it that way. There
has been what almost amounts to
civil war in Palestine for the last
three years, and now the English
can afford it no longer.
* * *
MOSLEM addition to the Anglo-
French Stop Hitler bloc means
Palestine as well as Turkey, Egypt,
Iran, Arabia, and Afghanistan. Brit
ain's lite-line to the empire, and
life is what the empire means to
her in case of war, lies through the
Suez. Constant Italian agitation
among the Arabs has threatened to
line the shores of the Suez, the Red
Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Arab
ian Sea with thousands of fierce
tribesmen awfully, awfully hostile
to English interests.
Britain has never been one to let
petty matters stand in the way of
what was best for Britain.
