# Birnbaum Tackles Spring Show Score
## 
### 
He's moved into the new Ram's
Head quarters in the basement of
Memorial Hall, but his troubles are
just as numerous as when he worked
in the draughty old Roble Gym.
Myron Birnbaum has been work
ing for three years, arranging music
for Ram's Head productions, and
never yet have things gone perfect
ly, he claims. This spring, his job
on "Wake Up and Leave" is even
more involved, since 18 separate ar
rangements for a 27-piece band
must be made of the 15 tunes in
the show before presentation on
May 2(5 and 27.
In addition each musical number
must be fitted exactly as to length,
musical style, and orchestral
strength to its spot, in the show. In
former years, songs were simply ar
ranged arbitrarily, and the scene in
which they appeared molded to fit.
After the first tryout of the 14
arrangements already completed,
Birnbaum has called the music for
"Wake Up and Leave" the best he
has handled. Orchestral arrange

ments vary from "corn, through j
swing, to a Sousa-liko military i
march." he said.
Although the new Ram's Head
room is a great improvement over
his quarters in the Roble Gym, he
is on the look-out for a repetition
of the deluge caused last week
when water from a window-box
poured into the room, flooding his
manuscript paper and giving (hem
a parchment-like appearance. To
cap his worries, the Ram's Head
room has become a gathering place
for show workers, who, he claims,
insist upon singing while he is i
working.
While Birnbaum can work with- I
out a piano while writing his com- [
plicated arrangements, other music |
within hearing distance bothers |
him, he says.
Musically, "Wake Up and Leave" i
is the most difficult job he has j
tackled. Among his problems are j
how to make music like a train for j
90 seconds, and how to arrange for i
an orchestra so that it sounds like I

a trans-continental telephone con
versation.
Insuring music ot accompany
the script for brief passages, Birn
baum is attempting to add humor to
the already gag-packed script.
He calls Art McCue's band the
ideal medium for show music, since
most men in the organization can
play at least two instruments, thus
allowing him great freedom in or
chestration.
A graduate law student, Birnbaum
has taken several weeks off during
(he last three years during fall and
spring quarters to handle orches
tral arrangements.
Tickets for "Wake Up and Leave"
will be on sale today and through
out. (he week at (he A.S.S.U. office,
according to Hank Houser, dramatic
manager. The ducats will not be
available on English Corner as they
have been for the past two days.
With the work for his last show
nearing completion, he's saying
nostalgically, "It's hard work, but
I'll sure miss it. . ,

which they appeared molded to fit.
After the first tryout of the 14
arrangements already completed,
Birnbaum has called the music for
"Wake Up and Leave" the best he
has handled. Orchestral arrange

ments vary from "corn, through j
swing, to a Sousa-liko military i
march." he said.
Although the new Ram's Head
room is a great improvement over
his quarters in the Roble Gym, he
is on the look-out for a repetition
of the deluge caused last week
when water from a window-box
poured into the room, flooding his
manuscript paper and giving (hem
a parchment-like appearance. To
cap his worries, the Ram's Head
room has become a gathering place
for show workers, who, he claims,
insist upon singing while he is i
working.
While Birnbaum can work with- I
out a piano while writing his com- [
plicated arrangements, other music |
within hearing distance bothers |
him, he says.
Musically, "Wake Up and Leave" i
is the most difficult job he has j
tackled. Among his problems are j
how to make music like a train for j
90 seconds, and how to arrange for i
an orchestra so that it sounds like I

a trans-continental telephone con
versation.
Insuring music ot accompany
the script for brief passages, Birn
baum is attempting to add humor to
the already gag-packed script.
He calls Art McCue's band the
ideal medium for show music, since
most men in the organization can
play at least two instruments, thus
allowing him great freedom in or
chestration.
A graduate law student, Birnbaum
has taken several weeks off during
(he last three years during fall and
spring quarters to handle orches

Tickets for "Wake Up and Leave"
will be on sale today and through

have been for the past two days.

He's moved into the new Ram's
Head quarters in the basement of

Myron Birnbaum has been work
ing for three years, arranging music
for Ram's Head productions, and
never yet have things gone perfect
ly, he claims. This spring, his job
on "Wake Up and Leave" is even
more involved, since 18 separate ar
rangements for a 27-piece band
must be made of the 15 tunes in
the show before presentation on
May 2(5 and 27.
In addition each musical number
must be fitted exactly as to length,
musical style, and orchestral
strength to its spot, in the show. In
former years, songs were simply ar
ranged arbitrarily, and the scene in
which they appeared molded to fit.
