# '39 Concerts Announced By Collins
## Tibbett, Symphony, Don Cossacks, Sayao Signed for Series 
### 
Lawrence Tibbett, Bidu Sayao,
the Don Cossack Choir, and the San
Francisco Symphony with Pierre
Monteux conducting and Isaac Stern
as violin soloist have been signed to
appear on the 1939-40 Stanford
Concert Series, John Collins, the
new manager, announced yesterday.
Tibbett's two previous appearances
at Stanford have been the most pop
ular single concerts the series has
ever had, and the box office sale for
the Don Cossack concerts here has
been second only to that of Tibbett.
New to Stanford will be Bidu
Sayao, soprano who has come up
from Brazil in the last few years
and is gradually taking over Lily
Pons' roles in the Metropolitan
Opera. Primarily a coloratura, Mi.ss
Sayao is famous too for many lyric
soprano roles.
Pierre Monteux, who will conduct
a larger San Francisco Symphony
when he comes to the Farm next
year, is known chiefly as an inter
preter of the moderns. Although his
programs include the music of all
times, he gives more attention to
modem composers than do the
other conductors.
General Platoff's Don Cossack
Choir, which will open the season
next year on Oct. 11, is composed of
25 ex-officers of the Russian Army.
The Cossacks are comedians, danc
ers, and whistlers as well as un
usual vocalists. A sword-throwing
dancer is one of the better known
members of the group.
Bidu Sayao's appearance is sched
uled for Nov. 27, which will bring
two concerts during fall quarter for
the first time. Lawrencc Tibbett
will sing on Jan. 25, and the Sym
phony, which hasn't been heard here
since 1936, will appear some time
in April.
