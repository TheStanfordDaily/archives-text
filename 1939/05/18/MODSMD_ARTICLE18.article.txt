# United Mine Workers Sign Coal Groups
## Harlan Operators Hold Out Against 'Union Shop' Demands 
### 
HARLAN, Ky„ May 17 (UP).—
The United Mine Workers today
signed contracts with three more
soft coal producing groups, leaving
the Harlan Coal Operators Associa
tion the only major holdout against
its demands for a "union shop."
Union miners organized yesterday
to rout the state militiamen who
have enforced rigid discipline since
Sunday. Governor A. B. Chandler
took no chances, however, and or
dered the 800 troops on duty aug
mented by Company G of the 149 th
Kentucky Infantry.
Brigadier General Ellerbe Carter
sent two detachments to the Harlan-
Bell County border to protect tip
ples of the Kentucky Cardinal Coal
Corporation and the Southern Min
ing Company, which reopened with
out contracts.
George S. Ward, secretary of the
Harlan association, said the opera
tors were willing to sign new con
tracts but they were adamant against
the "union shop" clause.
Those signing were the Virginia
Coal Operators Association, the
Southern Appalachian Coal Opera
tors Association, and the Hazard
Coal Operators Association. Earlier
the Southwest Virginia Bituminous
Operators Association, the Big San
dy - Elkhorn Association, and the
Kanawha Association had signed.
