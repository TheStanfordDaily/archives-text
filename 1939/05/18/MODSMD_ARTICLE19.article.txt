# Dancers Rehearse For Spring Revue
## 
### 
Orchesis, honorary dance society,
is in rehearsal for their spring pro
gram which will be presented in the
Memorial Theater on May 31.
This year's program will include
solo numbers and small group se
lections. Comic dances will be pre
sented, differing from the loftier
themes of last year's concert. Junior
Orchesis will satirize afternoon teas
and modern dance.
