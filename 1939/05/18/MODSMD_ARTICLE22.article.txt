## 
### 
Returning to her Alma Mater, the
University of Michigan, Mrs. Leorta
B. Diekema will end her five years
of directing Stanford's Roble Hall in
i June.
"It issn't that I don't like Stanford,'
! she said. "Even after I received (his
! offer I had a hard time deciding;
j who knows, I may even come back
| again. But now I'll try reversing the
I procedure and spend my vacations
! at Stanford while working in the
I East."
Mrs. Diekema will fill the posi
-1 tion of director of the Martha Cook
Building at the University of Michi
i gan. Endowed by the University, it
1 is a women's dormitory with the
! same set-up as Stanford.
My duties there will be the same
as at Stanford," Roble's director re-
I marked. "But it will be on a smaller
j scale. There will be only 120 girls
—about half as many as at Roble."
When Mrs. Diekema came to Stan
i ford five years ago, it. was to take
J over a new idea — that of using
Roble as a freshman dormitory only,
Previously she had been housemoth
er of a smaller group at Michigan

while working for her master's de
gree, but the idea of a living group
lor freshman women only presented
new possibilities and problems.
"Although I hate to leave Stan
ford, Ann Arbor is where my roots
really are," she reflected. "And the
school has student government the
same kind we have nearly all."
Taking over Mrs. Diekema's
freshman family for next year will
be Miss Helen Sims.
She is a graduate of the Univer
sity of Minnesota and at present is
versity of Minnesota, is at present
dean of women at State Teachers
College, Clarion, Pennsylvania,
where she is working for her doc
tor's degree. She has studied abroad
and is interested in classics and per
sonnel. Before her present position,
which she has held for nine years,
Miss Sims was assistant dean of
women and instructor of Latin at
Humlin University, St. Paul.
Mrs. Diekema plans to return to
Michigan after commencement by
way of British Columbia. She will
begin work at Michigan in the fall
and Miss Sims will take up her
duties at Stanford.
