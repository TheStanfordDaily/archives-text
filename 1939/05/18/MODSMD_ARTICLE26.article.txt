# C.O.P. to Hear Farm Debaters
## Mellinkoff, O'Leary To Ding Fraternities 
### 
At the special request of the Col
lege of the Pacific, two of the Me
daille Jofi're debaters. Sherman Mel
linkoff and Thomas O'Leary, will
participate in a forensic tilt at that
college today.
Their first appearance will be at
10:15 o'clock before a student body
assembly when they present the af
firmative of the question: "Resolved,
that college fraternities and sorori
ties should be abolished. "At 1:15
o'clock Mellinkoff and O'Leary will
broadcast the debate over station
KWG, located at 1200 kilocycles on
the dial. Their Pacific opponents
will be William Biddiek and Erwin
Farley.
The debate will be conducted in
an entirely new fashion, according
to Sherman Mellinkoff. Entitled
"cross examination" style, the tilt
starts with a ten-minute construc
tive speech from the affirmative
after which the opposition is allot
ted five minutes in which to cross
examine the first speaker.
The procedure is then reversed
for the negative side of the ques
tion, and then both sides conclude
with a five-minute rebuttal. Ac
cording to Mellinkoff this method
makes the debate sound somewhat
like a courtroom scene but "should
also insure a lively tilt."
