# Biologists Get $200,000 Capital Gift
## Dr. Wilbur Accepts Rockefeller Grant For Cell Researches 
### 
Gift of a $200,000 grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation for sup
port of researches in chemophysical
biology, which have been carried
out at Stanford during the last Jive
years, was announced today by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur.
This capital sum, Dr. Wilbur said,
may be retained as endowment or
spent at a rate not to exceed $20,000
per year. It makes possible an ex
pansion of researches on the struc
ture, behavior, and heredity of plant
and animal cells which are being
conducted by Professor George W.
Beadle, Lawrence R. Blinks, C. B.
van Niel, C. V. Taylor, Victor C.
Twitt.y, and Douglas M. Whitaker.
Supported in part during the last
five years by Rockefeller Founda
tion grants totaling $07,000, the work
of these men has centered upon
fundamental problems oi the living
cell as the common protoplasmic
unit in all plants and animals, or or
ganic form and function, develop
ment and heredity.
"Our knowledge of living things
will be greatly enhanced by studies
of those cells common to all," Dr.
Wilbur said in announcing the gift.
"The application of modern physics
and chemistry to biology is full of
opportunities for a better under
standing of life and eventually of
man."
