# Corp Yard's Nels Parker Reminisces
## 
### 
A lot older than the Corp yard's
fleet of Model T's, and in a lot bet
ter condition, is Nels Parker, a
Swede from the old country, who
has been in the Farm's employ since
1911.
Nels hit Stanford when the chapel
was still in ruins, and one of his
first jobs was carrying precious mo
saics and other materials to the
workmen. One of his chief regrets
is that the chimes in the old chapel
tower, which way wrecked in the
'quake, were not replaced.
Born in 1872 in the little village
of Broby, Sweden, he left his home
when he was 20 years old to try his
luck in the States. He worked as a
lumberman, mill hand, and farm
hand, while attending school so that
he might learn to read and write
English.
In 1911, he came West and was
given a team on the Stanford stock
farm to drive; eight years later he
got a Ford. He's been driving that
ever since.
"You students haven't changed
much since the early days," he
commented. "The only thing is your
hats. I can remember when the
frosh wore dinks, the sophomores
red hats, and the seniors sombreros.
Now you don't wear any," and he
tchk-tchked.
Nels has a mild hankering to visit
his folks in Sweden but he's a little
bit leary of a long stayâ€”too cold.
But a summer visit would be a dif
ferent thing. His eyes grew dreamy
as he described "long quiet days
when it never gets dark, because it
is the beautiful land of the mid
night sun."
