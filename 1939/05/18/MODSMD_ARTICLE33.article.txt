# Greats of Farm Athletics Line Harry Maloney's Office

### D. AMES 
"I've been collecting these sport
pictures around my office since way
back before the Great War," Harry
Maloney, director of minor sports,
mused in his on-and-off Irish
brogue. Harry is a medium-sized,
middle-aged man with a deep-lined
face and a perpetual smile.
"And I know all the fellows in
those pictures personally," he con
tinued. "That picture of Gene Tun
ney, Eddie Eagan, and myself was
taken back in 1919 when I was
coach and trainer of the American
Track and Field Team at the A.E.F.
meet in Paris. Gene still writes to
me; why, just the other day I got a
letter from him saying he couldn't
present his boxing awards because
May 25 Ls his birthday. I should
have remembered."
ALWAYS VISITORS
Harry bounced from his wooden
chair, across the room to his closet,
where he fished the letter from Tun
ney out of a coat pocket in order
to show it to a pair of newly ar
rived visitors. Harry always has
visitors in his little oflice.
"What about my life history?" he
rambled on. "Well, I was born in
Dublin and passed through a mili
tary school back there. In 1900 I
was shipped off to Africa as a ser
geant of scouts in the Boer War.
Those Boers were smart, clean
fighters, and they took plenty of
shots at me. I came down with
fever in Africa, and was declared
unfit for military duty. That's why

I came to California and opened a
gymnasium in Pasadena in 1904."
From there Harry went on to re
late how back in l'JOB David Stan-
Jordan, Stanford's first president,
asked him to direct Stanford ath
letics. "So I gave my equipment to
the Y.M.C.A. and I've been here
ever since," he chuckled.
KNOWS TIfEM ALL
"That's when I started to collect
all these sport photographs." Harry
repeated. "That one's of the famous
Black Rugby team of New Zealand
which beat Stanford 5G to 0 and Cal
57 to 0 in 1913. I tok care of their
injuries and, would you believe it,
8 of those 22 lads were killed at the
beginning of the World War."
Harry pointed from one picture to
another, calling each soccer man,
each rugby player, by name. His
finger pointed out a Stanford grad
uate, John Macrady, who flew a rec
ord trans-continental flight of 2700
miles back about 1915: and then to
"Hilton, who is an eastern univer
sity president," and to "Pellas, who
is now a coffee and spice importer."
All of these men used to play rugby
for Harry.
Harry was still pointing and re
calling when some more visitors
came in and distracted his attention.

The Bureau of Agricultural Eco
nomics expects a larger hatch and
increased market and storage sup
plies of poultry and eggs in 1939
compared with 1938.
