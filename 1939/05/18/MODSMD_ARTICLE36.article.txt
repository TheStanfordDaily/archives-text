SPUING isn't supposed to be the
football season and practice is a lit
tle informal, and mostly experi
menting with plays and combina
tions to give the coaches an idea foi
the coming fall. But in the East
they've taken to scheduling regulai
games with the same teams the>
play in the fall.
We think our idea is a little bet
ter, makes (he real season more ex
citing, more important. It seems
sort of commercialized or something
to play games in the spring. For
tunately Coast Conference rules
prohibit spring intercollegiate games
or football might turn into an all
year-round affair. Bpsides, it's a
hard enough grind on the lellows to
play all fall without adding spring
games.
TAKE a glance at what our team
has been doing this spring. Things
are looking up, especially in the
backfield. Norm Standlee came out
of last season looking amazingly
like Bobby Grayson. Once Norm
gets started, he's darn hard to stop
—we'd hate to try. He's not only a
line-plunger, but also goes full
speed ahead around the end.
Pete Fay, of course, is our star
broken-field runner. If he just steers
clear of streptococci and such, he'll
be another candidate for national
recognition. Gene Coldiron is our
best blocking back and we'll really
need him.
There has been much talk of Frank
Albert—that he's too light lor var
sity competition and that he's over
rated. But go watch him in spring
practice. If anything, he looks even
better as a kicker, passer, and run
ner than he did when he was a
frosh.
This fall will also see the return
of Jim Groves, a good, really tough
ball-carrier and we welcome him
back with open arms, editorially
speaking. Besides these would-be
stars, there are a number of other
god backs, Hugh Gallarneau, Bob
Crane, and Don Templeton.
WE KNOW what you're thinking
now. Reams are always written
about the backs and the poor line
men slave away with no recogni
tion. But right now it's much more
pleasant to think about the back
lield than the line.
Jim Lawson always turns out
good ends and next year will be no
exception. He has three outstanding
ones this year, Andy Stojkovich,
Bill Willard, and Stan Graft'. That
spot is fun to think about.
And the tackles have possibilities.
Swede Johannessen has been sensa
tional in practice and will slip right
into Zagar's shoes. Stan Andersen is
out at the track now, as you know,
but he'll be there in the fall. An
other god prospect is Wink Jones,
who has shown up fine in prac
tice, but is inexperienced.
But the guard spots are the sad
dest of all. Unless Corky Donahue
and Hamp Pool are back, things
look pretty black. Ken Robesky,
Steve Keussel', Dave Patterson, and
John Kerman have been flanking
the center this spring, but we have
to admit they don't look like All-
Americans.
The crucial center post that often
makes or breaks a team is filled very
nicely by big Colin McClintock. But
he's another lacking experience.
We'll just hope he seasons quickly.
