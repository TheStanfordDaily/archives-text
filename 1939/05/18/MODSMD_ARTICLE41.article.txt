## Trackmen Uninspired in Last Pre-Seattle Practice Drill 
### MARGE HOVEY, Sports Editor 
A cold wind blowing over Angell
Field wasn't much of an inspiration
to the varsity cindermen who came
out for the weekly twilight meet
last night. This was the last practice
before the team leaves lor Seattle
this afternoon for the Pacific Coast
Championships which start Satur
day.
Clyde Jefirey performed only in
the hundred, getting off to a slow
start to make it in 9.8. But Jeffrey
is pretty much of a cinch to win
any sprint he enters, even against
the fast Lee Orr and Curt Ledford.
The main question mark is Craig
Williamson, who went to the rest
home yesterday. According to Dink
Templeton, if Williamson isn't able
to go to Seattle, Les Johnson and
George Rockwell, the other relay
men, will stay home too.

The shot put was one of the en
j couraging events last night with
, Stan Andersen putting it out 51
| feet 7'-j inches, and Bill Wohle doing
1 51 feet 4 inches. Allen Grey, the
| come-through man of the S.C. meet,
put the weight 49 feet 2 inches.
This is one event where the Indians
might make a clean sweep.
Bill Braheny will be the only jave
; lin thrower from the Farm at Seattle
and his best heave* of 211 feet looks
a little low beside Peoples, De Groot,
j and Brown.
Mushy Girard and Paul Moore
j will be the milers this week-end.
Girard ran 4:20.7 last night, which
I is all right considering he wasn't
j pushed. He can be counted on to
give Zamperini and Cole some com-
I petition in the meet.
Pete Zagar is about ready to set
j a new record in the discus, though
his best throw yesterday was 163
feet. He and Hamp Pool will be the
Card delegation at Seattle.
Captain Stan Hiserman finished
the low hurdles in a dead heat with
Gubser of the Olympic Club in 24
Hat. In the high hurdles Bill Huw
-1 kins ran two 14.8 races. Dick Simp
son is the other hurdler who will
; compete at Seattle.
Ceiling for the high jump was low
i last night with Les Steers of San

Mateo J.C. only doing 6-5, good for
anyone except him. Jim Lincoln
jumped 6-3 and Russ Wulft did 6-2
to win spots for themselves on the
traveling squad. Only broad jumper
to go will be Norm Christianson.
