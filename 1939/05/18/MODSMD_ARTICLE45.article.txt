# Alums Upset Waterpoloists
## Regulars Lose Annual Tilt for First Time 
### 
Showing a beautiful offense, es
pecially in the middle of the tank,
the alumni water polo team gave the
varsity a decisive 6-1 defeat yester
day afternoon.
With Don Peterson, Bob Hoover,
and Harvey Rothschild carrying the
brunt of the attack, the former Card
men had little trouble disposing of a
green varsity. Only lettermen for
the regulars were Captain Bob Plate
and Ted Moreno, guai'd.
This was the first time that Ihe
alums have won the annual contest
and also the first time that the var
sity cracked before the grads did.
Half-time score saw the old men
leading only 2-1, but Bill Hanna
came through to score three goals,
while Bob Hoover made two and
Rothschild one. Bob Allen was the
only scorer for the varsity, breaking
through when Hanna was out of the
game.
