# "A" for Effort
## 
### 
BACK in grade school there was always a
part of the report card in which the more
esthetic qualities of the individual were graded.
Heading the list of this little group and far and
away the most important was the word "effort."
For some reason a person never seems to
recover from this conditioning.
The blow of bringing home to a parent a re
port card full of C's and D's was always soft
ened by that little item "A for effort." (Unless,
of course, the parents were those who de
manded that results measure up to capacities.)
Although the appearance in high school and
college of the "A for effort" item is noticeably
absent from the grade report sheet, it becomes
more and more apparent that certain individuals
still expect this compensatory approbation from
their fellows.
They place their faith in the words of the
popular song which tells us that "It ain't whut
cha do, it's a way hut cha do it."
Perhaps these bewildered people would do
better to consider the mood in which the tune
was written. For in the cold light of day it is
only too unhappily true that results are the
things that count.
When a committee drive goes sour, in spite
of the chairman's sleepless nights and work
filled days, the thing that happens is that the
campus knows the drive was badly done and
is blissfully unaware of the brain and brawn
that were expended.
When a campus play goes sour the audi
ence is only human in its reaction. It is fairly
obvious that large numbers of people labored
long and hard to bring the presentation before
the audience.
But the people still don't like it.
When the workers moan, "But everyone
worked so hard on it," one is apt to feel, rather
than sympathy, a deep regret that anyone
bothered.
Expended energy is no doubt a phenomenon
worthy of something, but expended energy
alone never drew gales of approval from a
student group for an inefficient, though hard
working, committee.
No audience ever gave seven curtain calls
to a cast which produced a flop even though
everyone worked awfully hard.
Yes, it's a hard, cruel world and college is
only the first of it. Here dies that sympathy for
effort; here flourish the demands for good re
sults. But the publicly unlamented expended
energy may not be a total loss. At least the
expender learns what not to do next time.
He may some day put all that work into a
smashing success and feel as a reward the
warming fires of public approval. But when
his efforts curdle, all his whining and moaning
won't do the trick.
The good people just don't give the "A" for
effort.
