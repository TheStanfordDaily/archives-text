# No Tattletale Grey
## 
### 
THE DAILY maintains a policy of careful
avoidance of gossip columns —a policy sup
posedly reflecting the attitude of a student body
which has always prided itself on its responsi
bility and self-government—in short, its first
maturity.
That this policy is condoned by the general
campus is a fact well known. It is only a few
freshmen, still under the psychological spell
of their high school Tattletale columns, who
ever deplore the absence of a scandal section.
But The Daily can't conscientiously pat itself
on the back for its really commendable absti
nence when the whole purpose of the thing is
defeated by the students who carry on their
gossip campaigns more furiously by word of
mouth.
Those who have ever been the victim of such
a campaign (as who has not to some degree?)
know the unfairnegs of the whole situation and
how easily a tiny truth can be distorted into a
mass of lies.
The fact that people do make mistakes and
must take the conseguences does not necessi
tate that they must take more than they deserve.
Yet, when a story starts and is whispered about,
it usually becomes so distorted that it reaches
its climax far wide of the truth.
The whole business of scandal-mongering is
reminiscent of a child's game in which the chil

dren whisper a sentence around the group from
ear to ear until it reaches the last child who
must repeat what he hears aloud.
The original sentence is then told and the
children are thrown into gales of laughter at the
huge discrepancy between the two.
But the "older children" don't play fair, be
cause the last one does not repeat aloud and
the person who caused the original comment
never has a chance to defend it against the
distortion.
The students of Stanford are highly intelli
gent men and women. They know the irrepar
able damage which gossip can do. They pub
licly say that they are glad the grey in The
Daily is not Tattletale.
But they trade a lesser evil for a larger one
when they persist in the indulgence of their
nasty little distortion game.
