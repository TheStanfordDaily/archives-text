### FRANCES SLATER 
TIIE CHILDREN'S HOUR
r | I IIE lobby of Roble smells of vinegar and salad oil
and is full of the bright, conventional, misleading
pattern of a first day at Stanford. The lobby crowd
is seldom home.

Lucy is lonely and therefore despicable. She is
also given to fawning confidences. Sometimes she goes
down to the room in the basement, plays the phono
graph, and dances around by herself. The red stone
floor is slick, and when she dances around she looks
at a travel poster of Spain which gives her a little
thrill. The record is cracked and scratchy, but that is
part of the impression—"l picked a flower the color, of
your eyes—your eyes—your eyes."
Miss Taylor tells her she had better not play the
phonograph today and pinches Lucy's cheek, her
smile stiff with duty and distaste.

The lobby crowd is seldom home, oh, the lobby
crowd is seldom home.

|Y|'ARY is a tall, strong girl with heavy, sandy eye
brows and big hands. She is conservative by na
ture and seems to attract plainness around herself.
Her idea of bright color is a touch of a red button
on a dark blue dress.
People iust a class below Mary can tell by looking
at her that she comes from a good family and mis
trust her accordingly. People in Mary's own class are
to rich f»nd too playful for her.
Lately, Mary diets frequently and stands before
the mirror with her fists pressed against her hip
bones. It pleases her when they show.
Mary is not beautiful but she is intelligent.
Oh, the lobby crowd is seldom home, seldom home,
seldom home.

Anne is pretty but so willing to make friends that
the corridor aristocracy has given her up. Tomorrow
there will be an examination in the History of Western
Civilization. Anne wants to know if Plato would say
that her bathrobe was not real but part of a reality
and why.
The rest of the crowd are on the Romans. Anne
will flunk the ex tomorrow. She is too intensely
interested to learn the syllabus.

Oh, the lobby crowd is seldom home, seldom home,
seldom home; oh, the lobby crowd is seldom home.
