BUZZER TWICE

ALL OVER THE DAMN

PEDICULOUS?

SHADES OF '2.»

Despite it's being spring quarter, tales of bright
freshmen still float, about the campus.
Eack in the autumn registration days a Roble lass
accosted her sponsor concerning some of the rules in
the little green book.
"I understand most of these rules pretty well," she
said, "but this system of buzzers has me a bit baffled.
I understand the part about one buzz for a call and two
for a caller. But tell me, how can you tell, just by
loking at it, if the little black button wiggles once
or twice?"

The Dckes arc still at it.
The other day, so the story goes, an elderly gentle
man was peacefully making his way up the Row. As
he meditatively contemplated the pavement outside of
the Deke house —"Splop"—a water bag landed on
the back of his neck.
Sputtering with rage, he strode into the house.
After a struggle to regain his speech he finally told
of! those present in explicit expletives. The boys
soothed him and pi-omised on their collective words
of honor to be good. He stalked out, a picture of out
raged dignity, and (you've guessed it) down came an
other water bag, exactly as before.
This time he was too mad to speak.
P.S.: He hasn't been heard from since.

One of the Daily men is blessed(?) with a mighty
head of hair. In fact, when he comes in no one recog
nizes him.
A girl in one of his classes takes great delight in
heckling him. One day it was just too much to be
borne. "Oh, you get in my hair!" was his highly
original retort.
"Not without a guide I don't," she says.

It was in a biology class. The professor was ex
plaining the posture of the raccoon. "Now the horse
walks on its toes, but the racoon walks on the flat of
its foot."
The inevitable dumb one: "But wouldn't that make
its arches fall?"

Some years ago the Phi Psis has a dance —on their
tennis court. Several A.K.L.'s wanted to crash the
party ({is people do) so they went around to see
what the chances were—? No soap.
Nothing daunted, the would-be crashers scouted
around the court, and finally stationed themselves
amid the bushes surrounding the corner where the
punch bowl was located.
The China boy serving the punch left the precious
fluid from time to time, whereupon our heroes would
drink their fill of refreshment through a long glass
tube stretched through the wire net of the court.
They were sick later on.

Overheard from the D.U.'s: "Aw, you can't swim
any more than you can play pool."
