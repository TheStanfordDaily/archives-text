# 'Indian Dance' Standout Spot Of Ice Follies
## 
### 
"ICE FOLLIES," now appearing
at Winterland (formerly Dream
land Auditorium) San Francisco.
Two score effectively costumed
skaters, and choreography produced
by two of the finest ballet directors
in the field combine to make "Ice
Follies" as unusual and diverting an
evening's entertainment as San
Francisco has had to offer in sev
eral seasons.
The same 24 lovelies who backed
Joan Crawford in the M-G-M tech
nicolor production of "Ice Follies"
plus a dozen professional skating
champions are a first-class show in
themselves. In addition, scenic ef
fects, costumes, lighting, and or
chestra are effectively handled to
make the Follies a beautiful and
well-integrated production.
SWING DANCE BEWILDERING
Standout of the performance is
the "Indian Dance," featuring three
American and Canadian figure skat
ing champions against a background
of 16 dazzling Indian headdresses
worn by as many beautiful girls.
This is the same number, by the
way, that climaxed the M-G-M pro
duction.
"Swing Dance on Ice" is a bewil
dering whirl of white ties, tails, and
fluffy skirts that leaves the audience
as breathless as the skaters. The
show reaches a dramatic conclusion
with "Scotch Lassies," vaguely sug
gestive of the Radio City Rockettes
on ice skates, but none the less ef
fective.
APPEAL TO JITTERBUG
Individual stars are difficult to
pick in a show that contains more
than a dozen American, European,
and Olympic champions, but Ruby
and Bobby Maxson, Junior cham
pions of the Northwest, and Idi
Papez and Karl Zwack, European
and Olympic champions, took as
many curtain calls as any.
LaVerne Busher's "Eccentric
Dance" has a special appeal to the
jitterbug, but seems somehow out
of place on ice skates, traditionally
the most graceful of arts. Lcs Ham
ilton deserves credit for the fun
niest performance of the evening.
"Ice Follies" is at least a different
and diverting brand of entertain
ment, and perhaps the chance to
see old Dreamland Auditorium
dressed up like the Metropolitan
Opera House is in itself worth a
trip to the city.â€”Pat Smith
