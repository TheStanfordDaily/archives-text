The Editor, Sir:
Stanford students are constantly
faced with increasing costs of at
tending the University. This, of
course, is by no means within the
control of the University authori
ties because it is the inevitable ex
pense of an institution which is
growing and definitely demands im
provements, and as a result requires
costly upkeep.
But now that the increase seems
to have no cessation, it is my per
sonal opinion that the expenditures
should be increased to the extent of
maintaining more traffic officers for
the purpose of patrolling the cam
pus streets. The present traffic of
ficer has routine duties to perform
which do not permit him to award
1/100 the number of citations for
speeding that the campus speed de
mons deserve.
The strict enforcement of the
speed limit as exhibited by Palo
Alto would go far in preserving the
life and limbs of the campus popu
lation, and still the additional ex
pense would be negligible as com
pared to the total.
Therefore, if we, the campus resi
dents, desire a safer place to live
in view of the increasing number
of fast cars and drivers, let us de
mand that some of the funds allotted
for the enforcement of the 20 and
25 miles per hour traffic regula
tions.
