# German Group To Present Two Comedies
## 
### 
In a hunting lodge sits a beauti
ful young lady awaiting the return
of her husband and their handsome
guest, with whom the husband is
out duck hunting. This will be the
sccne and the situation when the
curtains part on "Der Mocrder, the
first of the two comedies to be
given by the German department
Friday, May 19. at 8 o'clock in the
Little Theater. This play was chosen
chiefly for its student interest and
appeal, and is to be presented with
completely modern costumes and
settings.
The young wife will be played by
Miss Anita Cast, who is greatly up
set because the two have not re
turned much earlier. Quentin War
ren, cast as the wooden-legged
apothecary, causes the young wife
further anxiety when he tells her
that twice before this situation has
occurred, and in each case a jeal
ous husband has murdered his
guest. The plot really thickens
when the husband returns—alone.
In the second comedy, "Panne
vor Alt-Heidelberg," the costumes
are modern, the play having been
set in 1932. On one occasion the
costuming is old-fashioned when
the heroine, Elsa Berg, played by
Siegrid Bcuche, dresses in frumpy
clothes in an effort to make the
hero, John Farley, played by Bill
Edwards, dislike her.
The play has a happy ending,
however, which satisfies the fath
ers of the young couple, who plan
ned the whole love affair.
