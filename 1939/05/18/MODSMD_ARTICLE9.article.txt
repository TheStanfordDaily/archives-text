# Hand Calls Student Leaders University's 'Junior Faculty'
## 
### 
Carrying through the idea that the
heads of campus activities represent
the "junior faculty" of the Univer
sity, Dr. Harold Hand of the school
of education addressed members of
Leadership Institute at the first of
its fourth annual series of meetings
in the Women's Clubhouse last
night.
Student leaders are in charge of
an "informal curriculum" which
should comprise a true part of every
college education, Dr. Hand ex
plained in applying his analogy. De
claring that the "junior faculty"
should be able to profit by the ex
periences of the "senior (acuity,"
he outlined five brief points which
any professor would be expected to
include in a course.
"Any math professor," he stated,
"would be expected to know in ad
vance what he was trying to do—or
teach. He would have to know what
learning was possible and desirable
under the heading of mathematics,
and what learning should be avoid
ed." Stanford leaders, he thinks, are
"above average," but are not always
informed as to what objects should
be accomplished or avoided in their
particular activity

Stressing democratic distribution
of learning opportunity as the sec
ond point, Dr. Hand stated that no
self-respecting professor would lim
it the homework he assigned any
student because of which side of
the campus he lived on or the kind
of friends he had. That economic
selection through raising of any
financial barriers to participate in
activities should be avoided was the
third point.
Continuity — preparing incoming
1 leaders to take over their jobs in
telligently rather than starting from
: scratch—is the final point for any
activity head to consider, he con
j eluded. Professors spend years
training, yet we often turn student
leaders loose on responsible jobs
{ with no qualifications except, that
j they have been successful politic
ians, he deplored.
At. the second meeting of this
I year's session of Leadership Insti
j tute, to be held next Tuesday in the
j Women's Clubhouse at. 7:15, Lyle
! Cook, Jack Laney, and Putzie HLn
; richs will give short talks. Three
j hundred student leaders who have
i been notified are asked to attend,
and the meeting is open to all who
I are interested.
