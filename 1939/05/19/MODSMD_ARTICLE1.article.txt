# History ... 1939

### LARRY LIVINCSTON 
a little more than six
months ago a crazy Polish Jew
killed a Nazi diplomat in Pains.
Here was the opportunity Adolf
Hitler had long been waiting for, and
he gave Propaganda Minister
Coebbels the signal to unleash the
most, brutal anti-Semitic campaign
of this century.
In Britain the news was received
with horror. Over the tea cups it
was referred to as an utter outrage.
The English press was filled with
denunciations of the Fuehrer, and
before long the King's Foreign Min
ister was interfering in an effort to
rescue the Jews from their Nazi
hell.

Six months ago Parliament met
to consider the problem of a co
lonial refuge for the German ex
iles. There was Palestine, of
course, but that would not Ik*
large enough if the entire Jewish
population of the greater Reich
was to he liquidated.
The possibilities of turning over
British colonies in Africa and South
America were discussed, but never
were made the subject of definite
action. Before long the presses were
humming a new tune, and the plight
of Hitler's black sheep was forgot
ten.
A* * %
r JPODAY the Jews are as much in
need of a refuge as they were
when the Nazis were dispossessing
them, herding them into concentra
tion camps, or lining them up against
walls in more sensational numbers.
Anti-Semitism threatens to become
a government policy in almost every
nation of central Europe.
These are the conditions under
which Britain has closed Palestine
to further Jewish immigration.
Yesterday the expected reaction
occurred. There were riots and
violence throughout the Holy
Land. One British soldier was
killed, and over 150 demonstra
tors were wounded. Through the
narrow cobblcstoncd streets of
Jerusalem and the broad boule
vards of modern Tel-Aviv stream
ing crowds angrily protested Kng
land's action.
# * *
Buildings were set afire, bombs
were thrown, and a few of the less
violent resorted to voluntary fast
ing. London organizations planned
to take action, but the last hope of
the Jews, the dream of Zion, is
gone.
It was all very well for the Brit
ish to seek a homeland for the ex
iles when they had nothing to lose
in the game.
Now that they see hope of win
ning over the Arabs from Italy
by guaranteeing them dominant
rights in Palestine, they have for
gotten about the Hitler persecu
tions and the lialfour agreement
of 1917.
England's action is only natural.
Self-preservation is instinctive, and
when a nation sees a chance to
strengthen its position in the pre
war world of 1939, the plight of a
persecuted people is immaterial.
