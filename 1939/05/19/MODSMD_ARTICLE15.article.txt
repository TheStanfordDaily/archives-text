### 
Though yesterday's unexpected
rain chased the cast and audiencc
of "Campus Cavalcade" from the
Frost Amphitheater to the shelter
of Memorial Hall, the Mothers' Club
pageant was played as scheduled.
The cast of Ram's Head's "Wake
Up and Leave," who were rehears
ing in the theater, were called upon
to set the stage, hang lights, and
open dressing rooms for the 200 per
sons in the "Cavalcade" cast.
Despite the unforeseen change in
plans the performance depicting the
story of Stanford from the time of
the Indians to the present day was
given a smooth production, full of
color and life.
