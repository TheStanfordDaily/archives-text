ish offer to enter into general stafT
consultations with the Soviet Red

a tvi-power military alliance as the
price of her adherence to the Anglo-
French peace front.
Britain's latest compromise pro
posal, handed to Soviet. Ambassador
Ivan M. Maisky at the foreign office
by Permanent Foreign Secretary Sir

Mascow, which still insists upon an
outright military pact with Grcal
Britain and Fra ncc.
