# Dr Walter Thompson Heads Consumer Co-op
## 
### BETTY KLINE 
Open membership, democraticÂ»
control, distribution ol profits to j
members, and political and religious J
neutrality, are four of the principles
adhered to by the Consumers' Co
operative Society of Palo Alto, ac
cording to Dr. Walter Thompson, |
Professor of political science and
president of the co-op's board of
directors.
Owning its own grocery store and
gas station, and possessing agree- ,
ments with dairying, laundering,,
and cleaning establishments, the co
operative serves as a medium for
some 300 Palo Alto families to pur- 1
chase collectively, and to redistrib
ute whatever profits there may be
to its own members.
In the co-op store, at 439 Flor- j
ence Street, Palo Alfo, products are j
sold at regular prices, but all profits
are xedistributed to members at the i
end of the year in proportion to the
amount of purchases each member
has made.
OUTSIDERS MAY BUY
Anyone may purchase from the ;
store, although profits are divided 1
among members only. The advantage '
to an outsider in buying at the store j
is that the quality of all goods is !
assured by the desire of the co-op |
members to secure for themselves j
the best values possible. Research is ;
carried on, partly in conjunction
with the Consumers' Union, to de- j
termine the merit of all products the ,
co-op secures.
Quantity purchases may be made j
either through wholesalers or !
through bargaining directly with !
manufacturers, in which case a I
product may be ordered to definite j
specifications.
In addition to the complete line of 1
groceries at the Florence Street i
store, the co-op operates a seven
pump gas station with a mechanic I
and facilities for auto repairs at the '
corner of Channing and Emerson ,
Streets in Palo Alto.
SAVINGS RETURNED
Co-operative agreements are also
maintained with a local dairy, I
laundry, and cleaners, whereby the
co-operative receives a discount in
return for its collective patronage,
and the savings are redistributed
among the members in proportion to
individual patronage at the end of
the year.
Membership in the co-op is open
to anyone, according to Gault Lynn,
instructor in economics and treas- I
urer of the co-op's board of direc
tors. Membership fee is $10, $8 of !
which is refunded if a member
moves away.
Sixty of the 300-odd co-op mem
bers are listed under "officers" in
the Bawlout, according to Lynn, and
an unknown number of assistants,
instructors, university employees,
and graduate students keeping house ;
swell the ranks, he explained.

That the principles of the Paly
co-op are especially applicable at
Stanford is pointed out by Professor
Thompson, who states that Senator
Leland Stanford was especially in
terested in the co-operative move
ment and twice sought to introduce
a bill in the senate "to encourage
co-operation and to provide for the
formation of associations . . . for
the purpose of conducting any law
ful business and dividing the profits
among the members thereof."
In his address at the first meeting
of the university's board of trustees
in 1883, the Senator said, "... Out
of these suggestions grows consid
eration of the great advantages, es
pecially to the laboring man, of co
operation, by which each individual
has the benefit of the intellectual and
physical forces of his associates. By
intelligent application of these prin
ciples will be found the greatest
lever to elevate the mass of hu
manity, and laws should be formed
to protect and develop co-operative
associations. . . . Hence it is we
have provided for thorough instruc
tion in the principles of co-opera
tion."
Part of a national and internation
al movement of Consumers' Co-op
eratives, the local society started in
1935 with only five members.' The
original inspiration was that of Dr.
James Murray Luck, associate pro
fessor of biochemistry, who became
interested in Consumers' Co-opera
tives while studying in Cambridge,
England.
Mrs. Harry A. Williams, wife of
the assistant professor of civil engi
neering, was also one of the orig
inal five members, while Dr. Ernest
Hilgard, professor of psychology,
was the president of the first board
of directors.
