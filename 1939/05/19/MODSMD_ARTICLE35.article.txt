thousand Nazi Stormtroopers, in
cluding neai'ly 3000 members of
Adolf Hitler's "Liebstandarte" body
guard, have arrived quietly in the
Free City of Danzig in recent days,
according to confidential diplomatic
advices reaching London.
The Stormtroopers, identified as
mostly "S.S." elite guards, were said
to have reached Danzig by sea from
Stettin, Germany, aboard vessels of
the German East Prussian Service.

said, to avoid passing through the
Polish Corridor with its heavy con
