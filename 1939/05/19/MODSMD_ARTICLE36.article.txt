SHANGHAI, Friday, May 19 (UP), j
â€”Police aided by U.S. Marines and
British infantrymen today began a
house-to-house search of the Anglo-
American area of the International 1
Settlement to round up suspected
Chinese Nationalist terrorists.
All roads leadng from the Anglo-
American area into the Japanese
area, the Chinese City and the
French concession, were barricaded, j
The raids began at 4 a.m. They were
designed to forestall a reported
Japanese move to seize police con
trol of the entire settlement area.
Settlement authorities last week
agreed to Japanese demands that i
terrorists, who have assassinated!
more than 75 pro-Japanese Chinese
leaders during the last year, be
ousted from the settlement and com- ;
plete neutrality be enforced in the
settlement henceforth.
