Norm Standlee, Pott' Fay and .several of their team-mates ganged up
oil a red-jer .eyed second team in scrimmage yesterday to smash out a
I Mi win. If was the last time the two teams will oppose each other until
the intersquad game in the stadium June 3.
The second's tally was made on a fluke early in the practice session.

â–ºOn fourth down, Hugh Gallarneau
booted a punt deep into the white's
J territory Coach "Husky" Hunt, act
! ing as linesman, called an offside on
the play, and most of the men on
i both teams turned around to start
the play again.
Pete Fay fumbled the ball over his
| own goal line and a red shirted
player fell on it for six points. Fay
made up for his mistake a lew min
utes later when he sliced off tackle
from the two-yard line to even the
j score. Norm Standlee converted
i with a place kick.
Standlee scored the final touch
down of the game, going over from
| the one.
Frankie Albert and Bill Willard
did not see action yesterday. Wil
-1 lard will not be able tfc work out
i for about a month because oi a bad
! rib injury. Albert is still bothered
by a sore ankle. Gallarneau, after
playing some fine football, had to
retire from the scrimmage with a
turned ankle.
Coach Thornhill plans to split the
I squad into two groups for the rest
;of the practice sessions. Emphasis
! will be placed on polishing plays.
