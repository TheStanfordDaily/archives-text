# Weakened Track Squad Goes North
## Williamson, Hayes, Clark on sick List; Card Hopes Narrow 
### 
Without the services of such po
tential point winners as Ernie Clark,
; Sid Hayes, and Craig Williamson,
; Stanford's track team yesterday
headed north to Seattle and the Pa
: cific Coast Conference meet.
The absence of these three sick or
injured cut the traveling squad to
i 17 men, including a relay team, but
still the optimistic observers yive
the Cards a chance to come through
in their third assault on U.S.C.s
mightiness.
Maybe the third time is the charm,
with the northern cindermen cut
ting in for points in the sprints, 440,
. 880, javelin, and pole vault. With
| Cal to hold El Trojan at bay in the
broad jump, 2-mile, and high jump,
maybe Dink Tompleton's boys can
capitalize on their first places and
j .squeeze in enough other points to
succeed.
Last year they certainly upset the
! dope bucket to come through,
Given chances only for a poor third
behind S.C. and Ca!, the Indians,
i led by Edson Burrows and Ray Ma
| lott, who won between them the
j 440, 880. mile, and 2-mile, hoisted
| themselves into a strong second
place.
In Clyde Jeffrey, Pete Zagar, and
either Stan Andersen or Bill Wohle,
j the Cards have cinch firsts in the
' sprints and weights, which gives
them 20 digits there. Victory will
depend upon whether the relay
team. Hawkins, Hiserman, Girard,
Wullf, Pool, Lincoln, Braheny, can
combine their efforts for another 20
points.
