News before It's News — Seattle,
May 20, 1939.— The University of
Southern California track team
nosed out Stanford and Washington
State today in a photo finish as seven
Coast Conference records were
broken and one tied.
* * *
IT'S RATIIKK unfortunate that
the conference track meet tomorrow
won't be judged on first and second
places alone. For, if that were the
case, Stanford would probably ease
into first place by a one or two
point margin. Maybe a look at out
infallible dope sheet on win and
place positions wll convince you:
100-yard dash—Jeffrey (S) and
Orr (WSC); new record.
220-yard dash—Jeffrey and Orr.
New Coast record.
440-yard d;th—Watts (C) and
Miller (SC). •
880-yard run—Dale (WSC) and
Storli (O).
Mile—Zamperini (SC) and Gir
ard (S). New record.
Two-mile—Zamperini and Gar
ner (WSC). New record.
Low hurdles—Vickery (SC) and
Hiserman (S). New record.
High hurdles—Humphrey (SC)
and Hawkins (S). Tie record.
Discus—Zagar (S) and Pool (S).
Shot—Anderson (S) and Wohle
(S). Two new records.

■ Javelin — Peoples (SC) and
Ilrown (O). New record.
Broad jump—Manuel (C 1 ) and
Hioomfield (SC).
llif>h jump—Carter (SC) and
Wulft (S).
Pole vault—VarofT (O) and Day
(SC). «
Mile relay—WSC. I.'SC, Stan
' ford, and California.

TIIEY COUNT five places in the
! coast affair with first at 5 and a 4, 3,
I 2, 1 succession. Therefore the Tro
i jans are a dead cinch for four firsts
■ and should take one or two more, in
i the pole vault or the high jump.
I Carter, on persistent performance, is
! not the host high jumper on the
Coast; still he could repeat hi.s Stan
lord performance. Wulff is coming
back (he did (J ft. 3 in. just before
j he left) and has the gt>od omen of
[ Slants with him to place or possibly
win the darned thing.
Stanford, on the other hand, has
only four top spots, Ihree of which
j are dead certain. But the Indians
look like the goods for six seconds
j where the Trojans get only three.
That leaves the first-second meet at
I Stanford, 44: Southern California,
: 42.
Well, the dream is nice to rest
' upon.
