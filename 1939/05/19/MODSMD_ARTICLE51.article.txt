# The 						Noble Savage

IT was at the Leadership Institute meeting last
Wednesday night. And the air was thick
with the theories of John Locke and Jean
Jacgues Rousseau.
The guestion arose whether self-government
is a natural right of the student body or is a
privilege benevolently granted by the Admin
istration.
Without involving himself in a maze of politi
cal theory, Dr. Hand expressed his belief that
as long as a university is exempt from taxation
it bears an obligation to allow student govern
ment to function free from veto or limitation.
To some extent this view is based on the
assumption that Ex Committee is incapable
of passing legislation harmful to the University.
However, this is a fault common to all repre
sentative governments.
Self-rule which exists only under the for
bearance of a superior authority is not true
democracy. As long as the Administration
keeps its hand on the faucet ready to cut off
the stream the privilege is only imaginary.
The guestion is this:
Is Stanford obligated to confer complete
freedom in self-government upon its student
body?
State universities can excuse limitations on
the basis of their obligation to the taxpayers.
Religious schools are under similar obligations
to the institutions that support them.
Is the fact that Stanford is exempt from taxa
tion sufficient reason to oblige it to give train
ing in citizenship which amounts to unlimited
democracy?
Although instances of interference are rare
under the present set-up, the Administration
stands ready to veto any act of Ex Committee
it considers unwise.
Remarkable as it may seem, this can be ac
complished within the framework of democracy.
The threat of expulsion from school is often
sufficient to control the vote of a student repre
sentative.—L. L.
