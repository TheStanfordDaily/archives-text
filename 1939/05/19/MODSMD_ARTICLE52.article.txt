CONSIDER for a moment the sociological
aspects of the "fwee itty fishies" (formerly
known as the three little fish) which we are
hearing so much about these days.
At first thought these three aquatic verte
brates appear completely innocuous—irrele
vant to the social scene and the class struggle—
as they swim in their "itty bitty pool."
But such is not the case. Relevant they are,
not to the class struggle, perhaps, but to an
important if frequently unrecognized aspect of
the American bourgeois culture pattern.
This threatened facet of our culture is the
aggregation of doggerel verse that has become
a traditional possession of American childhood.
It includes such verses as Little Jack Horner and
Old Mother Hubbard. As these examples sug
gest, most of this juvenile poetic heritage is
attributed to a legendary person called Mother
Goose.
But this Mother Goosian lore is threatened—
threatened by the same undermining force that
has made people say "I'm sick of it" when an
orchestra begins to play von Flotow's "Mar
tha."
The three little fish constituted a stronghold
of America's juvenile doggerel until swing or
chestras ensnared them and prostituted their
native charm.
The piscatorial trio was not the first to go.
Others have been the Red and Yellow Basket,
Little Sir Echo, and even Patty-cake, Patty-cake,
Baker's Man.
It is true enough that they found themselves
lifted to new heights of popularity by the corny
trumpet, the seductive saxophone.
But did they last? NO! After a few short
months they were cast-off garments, mere ba
nalities, scorned by all.
Sacrificed on the altar of swing, they leave
only their mutilated bodies as monuments to
a vanishing culture pattern, quickly being lost
to the little boys and girls of America. R. D.
