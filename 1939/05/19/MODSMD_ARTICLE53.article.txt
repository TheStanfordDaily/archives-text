WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
I AM sorry to have John Cobbs leave this column.
I have enjoyed his keen and incisive comment.
There have been times when he combined fact and
comment in sufch a way as to force the reader to the
intended conclusion. But usually it has been the soft
and gentle reminder that, after all, the reader had a
mind, and might use it with profit, and enjoyment.
Cobbs belongs to the group—and it is not a large one
—that in all the years of The Daily have made that
journal a constructive force in Stanford life. This
was because he dealt with ideas.
Of course The Daily must deal with ideas, or per
ish. It has no other primary function. Unlike other
student activities, it must do more than participate.
It cannot drift. And it dare not imitate. There have
been editors who have thought of it as "just another
newspaper." But not for long. Despite the somewhat
disconcerting air of nonchalance affected by many a
reader of the paper, and all his cursory reading and
violent denunciation, he, too, is looking for such com
ment on the passing scene as will enable him to feel
somehow that he is a vital part of this great insti
tution.
When an editor—or a contributor—k>s sensed this
ever-present student drive for self-exjMjssion, he has
written a chapter in Stanford history. And at all times
—let us remember—The Daily is the diary of the
University.
For, as Cobbs has said, or perhaps it was his bril
liant contemporary, Livingston, Stanford is not built;
it is being built. Its history is not somewhere in the
"nineties"; it is here and now. And this means that
trustees and faculty and administration and alumni,
and, most of all. the students are creating it now. And
negative action is part of the record, and always much
of the record is negative.

STANFORD life is what the students make it. Sug
k gestion as to conduct, interest, purpose may be
made. An elaborate system of advising furnishes a
framework within which the student acts; but it is
the student who acts, or fails to act.
All about us are the unusual opportunities of this
stimulating experience, "living at Stanford"—church,
music, lectures, laboratories, libraries, galleries, mu
seum, teachers, scholars, a matchless out-of-doors
with facilities for its use, and a continual stream of
new students with minds as well as bodies.
But if you doubt how vapid, how uninteresting and
how purposeless much of the activity about us is—how
we "throw away" these priceless opportunities that
come only once in a lifetime—if you doubt it—well,
read The Daily!
I would suggest that we attempt to see ourselves
as others see us; although a little questioning "outside"
does tend to shatter the shell of provincialism. I would
suggest that we consider—and often—what we might
have been. That is, if we consider just what this "free
dom" of which we hear so much does mean to the
individual. The "winds of freedom" were called for by
men and women who wanted at Stanford—and after—
a constructive life. Look at their record!

'J'HE time may easily be at hand when a thoughtless,
heedless and faithless generation will be made to
take what family, church and state have to giver—in
order that civilization may not perish. No, I do not
mean any fonn of Fascism. Nor do I see any hope
in the revolt of the masses behind the brilliant facade
of Communism. I see again a democracy—in action—
for a people who deserve to be free.
A community that carouses with or without, drink;
that sneers and loafs as it smokes; that dresses—and
often acts—in ways to shock outsiders; that litters post
office, administration building lobby, lawns with the
debris of daily routine; that takes it for granted that
this is a "farm" and its inhabitants "Indians"—such a
community is posing and acting a part, and a sorry
part, at that. It is not living at all. And in so doing, it
is preparing for a vapid, a crude, and a barren exist
ence in the years to come.
If this is preaching and scolding, and I fear it is,
it is all in the tradition of the personal column. Even
before Cobbs "took up the Bible," he was apt to preach,
although he may not thank me for saying so, and how
he did scold!
One of the simple souls who did so much to make
the world of thought in which we live, sang words
that will seem vapid to a sophisticated generation, yet
they carry the sting of reality:
"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,
The saddest are these, 'It might have been'."
