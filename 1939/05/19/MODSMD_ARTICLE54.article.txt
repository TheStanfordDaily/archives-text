# Lightly . . . And Politely

### DOUC JAQUES 
We smelted the Shack when we were a block from
it. ' That's not our usual stench," he said. "That can't
be the Shack." But it was the Shack. The edit board
and the rest of us rabble were coming over to put out
the paper after lunch; but when we got to the Shack,
we couldn't go in.
"There's a dead body in there," said the editor.
"What a smell."
"That's no dead body," the managing editor said.
"It's the board of trustees."
"This is serious. We've got to find out what's
in there," the editor said. "I want two reporters
and a night editor to investigate."
Then there was a big argument. We said it was
the duty of the edit hoard to investigate unexpect
ed odors and that they had been making and in
vestigating odors for years, and they said, "Rabble,
get in there."
Finally the two associates got thinking that it
was about election time and that it would be a
fine way to get votes to show how brave they
were. As one man they volunteered. We didn't
argue.
In about one minute they came running out.
"Perfume! It's perfume. All over the damn office!"
they yelled.
It was them women. They had put out the last
paper. They were afraid their paper wouldn't stink
bad enough, so they stunk up the office with perfume.
Well, we couldn't work in there with that sickly
smell. Two brave freshmen went in and opened all
the windows. We waited around, but that didn't help
much. Then the frosh went in again and got all the
typewriters and some paper.
"We gotta go to the hills," the editor said.
We found a spot, and took our typewriters out and
put them under a tree, and the editor .said. "Give me
a bottle of beer."
It was good out there under that tree for a while.
Everyone was working good and having a fine time,
and then the beer gave out, and we got to thinking
about that perfume.
It made us mad. We got sore and started cuss
sing and blaspheming something awful. We were
all sitting around under that tree swearing and
blaspheming like sinners.
And you know, just like that, that 11
tree fell on us.
