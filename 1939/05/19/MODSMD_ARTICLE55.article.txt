KING GEORGE VI and Queen Elizabeth became the first British
sovereigns to stand on Canadian soil Wednesday morning when they
arrived at Quebec for an 11.000-mile tour of the Dominion and the
United States. Their Majesties are shown in radio picture above shortly
before disembarking from the liner Empress of Austrajia.
