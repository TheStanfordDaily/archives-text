# Farm Plays Host to Fair Visitors on 'Welcome' Day
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
"It never rains at Stanford."
Two of the visitors present yes
terday at Welcome-to-Stanford Day
were listening attentively to Edwin
T. Coman, member of the committee
handling arrangements.
"It never rains ..."
It did. But nevertheless, a host of
visitors to the Exposition trooped
through the inner Quad, followed 25
student guides through show places
on the Farm, and generally agreed
that, rain or shine, the campus was
well worth seeing.
Tourists on the whole were en- ,
thusiastic, eager to ask questions,
and ready to answer them. Students
on duty at the Guide OfTice found
that questions weren't more sur
prising than usual, there were just
more of them.
Visitors enjoyed seeing Stanford's
athletic plant at the Encina and La
gunita gyms. Consensus showed
that these two places rated high in
tourist appeal.
Memorial Chapel of course was
the main focus of visitor attention.
Groups tip-toed through the door
to "oh and ah" at the interior, stood
outside in the drizzle to admire the
facade.
Volunteer guides admitted they
enjoyed the experience. One Stan
ford woman betrayed her own re
action completely when she said,
"See that man in the last party? He
sure was cute!"
Visitors heard of yesterday's trip
to Farm through 5000 invitations
sent to the Exposition and to hotels
in San Francisco. A few who toured
the campus were former Stanford
ites, some visiting the Farm for the
first time since student days.
Result of a decision not to hold a
Stanford exhibit at the Exposition,
Welcome - to - Stanford day was
planned as a method of showing
Exposition out-of-towners the best
possible Farm exhibit, the campus
itself.
The second of a series of tourist
days, yesterday's "open house" is
one of similar occasions planned
monthly.
Visitors yesterday were highly
pleased with what they saw. Per

j was an observation one tourist made
concerning the Chapel.
' "Sonny," he said, "it's pretty, but
we've got a barbecue stand back in
North Dakota that looks just like it!"
"It never rains at Stanford."

monthly.
Visitors yesterday were highly
pleased with what they saw. Per

j was an observation one tourist made
concerning the Chapel.
' "Sonny," he said, "it's pretty, but
we've got a barbecue stand back in
North Dakota that looks just like it!"
"It never rains at Stanford."
Two of the visitors present yes
terday at Welcome-to-Stanford Day
were listening attentively to Edwin
T. Coman, member of the committee
handling arrangements.
"It never rains ..."
It did. But nevertheless, a host of
visitors to the Exposition trooped
through the inner Quad, followed 25
student guides through show places
on the Farm, and generally agreed
that, rain or shine, the campus was
well worth seeing.
Tourists on the whole were en- ,
thusiastic, eager to ask questions,
and ready to answer them. Students
on duty at the Guide OfTice found
that questions weren't more sur
prising than usual, there were just
more of them.
Visitors enjoyed seeing Stanford's
athletic plant at the Encina and La
gunita gyms. Consensus showed
that these two places rated high in
tourist appeal.
Memorial Chapel of course was
the main focus of visitor attention.
Groups tip-toed through the door
to "oh and ah" at the interior, stood
outside in the drizzle to admire the
facade.
Volunteer guides admitted they
enjoyed the experience. One Stan
ford woman betrayed her own re
action completely when she said,
"See that man in the last party? He
sure was cute!"
Visitors heard of yesterday's trip
to Farm through 5000 invitations
sent to the Exposition and to hotels
in San Francisco. A few who toured
the campus were former Stanford
ites, some visiting the Farm for the
first time since student days.
Result of a decision not to hold a
Stanford exhibit at the Exposition,
Welcome - to - Stanford day was
planned as a method of showing
Exposition out-of-towners the best
possible Farm exhibit, the campus
itself.
The second of a series of tourist
days, yesterday's "open house" is
one of similar occasions planned
monthly.
