# CAMPUS OPINION
## MORE CELLAR HASHERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is not only the poor wages and
working conditions in the Stanford
eating places, it is new men coming
and going all of the time at short
intervals.
It is said some of the Cellar em
ployes have gotten married since
working on the job; said men have
asked for a raise in pay to help
keep the wolf from their door, but
the answer is that they shouldn't
have gotten married. I suppose it
would have been better to live old
maids and bachelors, but some of
those married persons have had to
look elsewhere for employment, and
when anyone gets sick and can't
work for a few days, he is docked
on his time card.
When he goes to the 8.A.C., the
nurses ask what kind of place you
are working at. The sick worker is
entitled to compensation, but does
he get it? I understand Ihere are
several not taking rooms on campus;
those should get an allowance for
not taking rooms. There are sev
eral students living in the Mayficld
district; and they say they go up
the highway to get their meals be
cause it is cheaper.
I believe some of the boys have
been in the Cellar for a long time,
but if you ask them they would
give,you some reason why they have
stayed, but it wouldn't be the
wages.
Mr. Editor, please print this letter,
as I haven't time to see you.
