# TO HIS GENEROSITY
## 
### 
(Editorial)
OUT of the idleness of rumor that has again and again risen
in waves of speculation on this campus, yesterday came
the announcement that the Board of Trustees had requested
Dr. Wilbur to remain as President until 1942.
That he accepted speaks much of the generosity of spirit with
which he has been President of this University.
The resolution under which Dr. Wilbur's retention was asked
by the Board is as follows:
"Resolved, that all members of the teaching or executive staff
of the University shall retire from active service upon the close
of the academic year in which they shall become sixty-five years
of age, unless with their consent they be continued in active
service by the formal action of the Board of Trustees."
That the action is not as unusual as some of Stanford's rumors
would make out is easily proven by brief review.
The academic careers of Professors Lee Emerson Bassett,
Edward Curtis Franklin, and Walter Greenwood Beach, for ex
amples, were continued by just such action in the past.
At present, there are five professors emeriti who take an
active part in the work of their departments.
If Stanford will only pause and look at itself objectively, it
will realize just how much of a service Dr. Wilbur is performing,
just how unselfish he is by remaining the two additional years.
In the first place, after 30 years of continuous service any
man is sure to be tired of his job.
In the second place, the last eight years of struggle to main
tain this University have not been easy ones.
That the result has been as good as it is, is due primarily to
the ability of the Farm's top administrator.
Stanford is in no such condition that any man whom the Uni
versity might desire as its next President would leap at the
chance. The outlook is, however, that in two years the status
will be far different.
Stanford, at present, is not a wealthy university. It has not
the distinguished faculty that it might have. Its professors and
students have, for the last ten years, been coasting on the repu
tation of former years.
If Stanford doesn't think so, let it look at the record. It can
be found easily enough.
It is certain, therefore, that Stanford could well be thankful
this morning when it realizes that it doesn't have to take the
chance of finding a new man for the job at this particular time.
And feel a twinge of regret that it will have to in two years.

students have, for the last ten years, been coasting on the repu
tation of former years.
If Stanford doesn't think so, let it look at the record. It can
be found easily enough.
It is certain, therefore, that Stanford could well be thankful
this morning when it realizes that it doesn't have to take the
chance of finding a new man for the job at this particular time.
And feel a twinge of regret that it will have to in two years.
(Editorial)
OUT of the idleness of rumor that has again and again risen
in waves of speculation on this campus, yesterday came
the announcement that the Board of Trustees had requested
Dr. Wilbur to remain as President until 1942.
That he accepted speaks much of the generosity of spirit with
which he has been President of this University.
The resolution under which Dr. Wilbur's retention was asked
by the Board is as follows:
"Resolved, that all members of the teaching or executive staff
of the University shall retire from active service upon the close
of the academic year in which they shall become sixty-five years
of age, unless with their consent they be continued in active
service by the formal action of the Board of Trustees."
That the action is not as unusual as some of Stanford's rumors
would make out is easily proven by brief review.
The academic careers of Professors Lee Emerson Bassett,
Edward Curtis Franklin, and Walter Greenwood Beach, for ex
amples, were continued by just such action in the past.
At present, there are five professors emeriti who take an
active part in the work of their departments.
If Stanford will only pause and look at itself objectively, it
will realize just how much of a service Dr. Wilbur is performing,
just how unselfish he is by remaining the two additional years.
In the first place, after 30 years of continuous service any
man is sure to be tired of his job.
In the second place, the last eight years of struggle to main
tain this University have not been easy ones.
That the result has been as good as it is, is due primarily to
the ability of the Farm's top administrator.
Stanford is in no such condition that any man whom the Uni
versity might desire as its next President would leap at the
chance. The outlook is, however, that in two years the status
will be far different.
Stanford, at present, is not a wealthy university. It has not
the distinguished faculty that it might have. Its professors and
students have, for the last ten years, been coasting on the repu
tation of former years.
If Stanford doesn't think so, let it look at the record. It can
be found easily enough.
It is certain, therefore, that Stanford could well be thankful
