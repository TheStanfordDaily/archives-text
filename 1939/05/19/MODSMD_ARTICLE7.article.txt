# Debaters Return From Island Trip
## 
### 
Annan Hampar and Robert Moul
ton, Stanford debaters, returned to
the Farm Tuesday after a three
weeks' trip to the Hawiian Islands.
While in the islands Hampar and
Moulton participated in two non
decision debates with the University
of Hawaii.
Recounting the details of the
trip, Hampar remarked that going
over wasn't particularly interesting,
that neither of the debaters were
seasick. Once they landed, Stan
ford's forensic men were greeted by
reporters and photographers, then
proceeded on a tour of the island
under the guidance of Mr. Louis
Pecker, French consul.
Questioned as to whether the Ha
waiian girls were everything the
steamship ads claim they arc, Ham
par quietly retorted, "Well, of
course, you don't find one under
every palm tree ..."
On the relations of the many na
tionalities represented in the Ha
waiian population, Hampar said,
"All the races there get along very
harmoniously. The army and navy
are alarmists in their attitude toward
the whole situation."
