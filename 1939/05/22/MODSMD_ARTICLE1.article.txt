the worried face of Eu
rope a rope is stretched taut.
At one end"ti Solid German-Italian
axis is tugging, while France and
England are frantically pulling at
the other and anxiously waiting for
the arrival of Russian aid.
A succession of minor interna
tional incidents are gnawing ai. the
little strands of which the rope is
made. It was hacked at its weakest
point this week-end when a Pole
killed a Danzig German, and the
tension at both ends nearly broke
the hawser.
* * At
All through last week Nazi
troopers in plain clothes slunk into
Danzig to attend a Hitler celebra
tion. By Saturday night a mob
had assembled around the build
ing housing the Polish customs of
ficials, and the inevitable hap
pened. Afraid of being stormed by
the excited storm troopers, the
Poles attempted to make their es
capes through the crowd in an au
tomobile.
When a group of brown shirts and
Danzig citizens attacked the car, the
chauffeur shot and killed a German
butcher. These are the insignificant
incidents of which wars are made,
and the governments involved real
ize it only too well.
The Nazis claim that the incident
was caused by the Polish officials'
attack on the citizens and have de
manded a formal apology from War
saw, an indemnity for the victim's
family, and the custody of the mur
derer. The Poles have retaliated
with a protest, to the Danzig Sen
ate, branding the attack as a viola
tion of their right to control the
customs.
OEIIINI) the excited exchange of
notes and diplomatic comuni
cations yesterday lies the om
inous threat that Hitler may see
fit to make the killing his excuse
for going to war. If Poland refuses
to give him satisfaction, and all
indications are that will be the
case, he either will have to fight
or accept the slap in the face.
We who know Adoif Hitler and
have witnessed his public acts for
the past few years will be surprised
if he takes this lying down. It is for
the Nazis to kill the enemies of the
Reich, and not vice-versa.
* * *
In the mighty munitions and the
expertly trained forces of the
Fatherland, its Fuehrer has good,
cause for confidence in his ability to
win a short, quick war. Yesterday
the formal signing of the Pact of
Milan gave excellent reason for
bolstering further his self-posses
sion.
By the terms of this alliance ce
menting the Rome-Berlin axis,
Germany and Italy guarantee each
other armed aid not only for de
fensive purposes, hut also for an
offensive move against an enemy.
Fully aware of the military supe
riority of their allies, the Italians
will probably agree to a merging
of general staffs with Nazi gen
erals in the top commands.
Thus, if Herr Hitler decides to
move against tho Poles because of
the Danzig incident, he will be
backed automatically with the full
armed support of Fascist Italy.
However, in all probability, the
axis powers will discover that they
have to deal with not. merely Eng
land and France, but also Soviet
Russia if they reduce the issue to
actual war. After conferring with
Ambassador Ivan Maisky in Geneva
yesterday, Prime Minister Cham
berlain finally agreed to grant the
U.S.S.R. the full defensive pact it
has been demanding as its price for
entering the democratic defense
front.
No decision has yet been reach
ed as to guaranteeing the integ
rity of the Baltic nations, but
Britain has backed down to
pledge herself to come to the aid of
the Soviet in case of enemy ag
gression.
The risk of being dragged into a
war with Japan over an attack on
Russia's Pacific shore is worth the
assurance that the mighty Red Army
will fight for England when Hitler
goes to war.
