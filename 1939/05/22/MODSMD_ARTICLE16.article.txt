# Streamlined Quads Take Bow Today
## Yearbook Arrives Ahead of Schedule 
### 
It's here!
White-covered, streamlined, thick
ly pictorial, "keyed to the tempo of
today," the 1939 Stanford Quad will
make its debut, on the Farm today,
several weeks earlier than usual.
Doors of the Quad office will be
open from 1 to 5 o'clock this after
noon, tomorrow, and Wednesday.
All books except those with names
on covers purchased after May 1
will be ready for distribution.
Sale of the few remaining Quads
will also begin this afternoon, to
continue until all books are sold.
Since only a small number remain,
Manager Margaret Hale urged that
purchases be made ioday.
SALE PROCEDURE
She also stressed the fact that
sales stubs must be presented when
the G)uad is delivered. Purchasers
need not call in person, but that
their stub must be turned in by the
person who calls for the book.
Those who have lost their stub
may receive their Quads upon pay
ment of a 25-cent charge, which
covers book-keeping costs, according
to Miss Hale.
The white-leather book, highlight
ed by a striking cover color photo
graph, has been hailed by the few
who have seen the book already as
the "best for years." Thicker than
California's "Blue and Gold," en
livened by over 50 candid camera
pages, as well as informal pictures
of each living group, the 1939 Quad
covers Stanford pictorially from Reg
Day to the closing days of spring
quartei'.
DIVISION PAGES
Four brilliant color pictures, coat
ed with cellophane-like material,
act as division pages. Under stu
dent-artist Dick Spencer, picture
layouts have been made to hit the
top spots of Farm activities, por
tray Stanford pictorially rather than
verbally. Copy has been cut to a
minimum, and stream-lined make
up used throughout.
Those who ordered name-on
cover books after the first of this
month will receive their Quads on
May 30. In the past, late purchas
ers have been unable to procure
name-on-cover books, but to accom
modate such persons this year, late
delivery of 150 books has been
ordered.

person who calls for the book.
Those who have lost their stub
may receive their Quads upon pay
ment of a 25-cent charge, which
covers book-keeping costs, according
to Miss Hale.
The white-leather book, highlight
ed by a striking cover color photo
graph, has been hailed by the few
who have seen the book already as
the "best for years." Thicker than
California's "Blue and Gold," en
livened by over 50 candid camera
pages, as well as informal pictures
of each living group, the 1939 Quad
covers Stanford pictorially from Reg
Day to the closing days of spring
quartei'.
DIVISION PAGES
Four brilliant color pictures, coat
ed with cellophane-like material,
act as division pages. Under stu
dent-artist Dick Spencer, picture
layouts have been made to hit the
top spots of Farm activities, por
tray Stanford pictorially rather than
verbally. Copy has been cut to a
minimum, and stream-lined make
up used throughout.
Those who ordered name-on
cover books after the first of this
month will receive their Quads on
May 30. In the past, late purchas
ers have been unable to procure
name-on-cover books, but to accom
modate such persons this year, late
delivery of 150 books has been
ordered.
It's here!
White-covered, streamlined, thick
ly pictorial, "keyed to the tempo of
today," the 1939 Stanford Quad will

noon, tomorrow, and Wednesday.
All books except those with names

will also begin this afternoon, to
continue until all books are sold.
