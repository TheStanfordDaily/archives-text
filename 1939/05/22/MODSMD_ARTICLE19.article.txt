# 'Situation 6' Six Months In Writing
## Five Stories Outlined, Discarded Before Spring Show Okayed 
### 
Although the Ram's Head Spring
Show next Friday night will be
called "Wake Up and Leave" on the
program, the four co-authors of the
musical farce — Sherm Mellinkoff,
J. P. Cahn, Charley Bulotti, and
Harry Muheim—still think of the
show by its original title, "Situation
No. 6."
Tlie name came late in winter
quarter when the four were work
ing on the show because the story
of "Wake Up and Leave" was the
sixth plot they had considered. Ac
cording to Mellinkoff, five earlier
stories had been outlined and dis
carded before the final one was
started.
Tho writing of "Wake Up and
Leave" was a six-months affair, Mel
linkoff said.
COLLEGE SATIRE
Ho, Cahn, and Carl Deisenroth,
composer of much of the show's
music, had the initial idea of writing
a musical satire on college life early
in fall quarter, although little was
done on the show until spring va
cation, when the four authors gath
ered each night, at Cahn's house in
Menlo Park.
"They were practically all night
sessions," said Mellinkoff. "All of
us except Bulotti, who couldn't
type, would take turns sitting at
the typewriter, known as 'The Con
sole,' and the others would talk
through the parts of each character.
"Muheim was the Chief Reader,
but," continued Mellinkoff, "he
usually read so well that even bad
lines would be funny."
ALUMNUS HELPS
Mac Gordon, Spring Show co
author of the first two musical pro
ductions several years ago, aided the
four by listening to lines and then
offering suggestions. "We used to
read him what we had, then take
down all he said, and put it into the
script," Mellinkoff commented.
By the end of Spring Vacation, the
outline of the plot and several
scenes were completed, and the re
mainder of the show finished during
the next two weeks. Additions,
corrections, and deletions are being
made all the time, Mellinkoff said.
Tickets are on sale to the mass
produced show at the A.S.S.U. of
fice for $1, 75 cents, and 50 cents,
ramatic Manager Hank Houser an
nounced that good scats for both
Friday and Saturday nights still
may be purchased.
