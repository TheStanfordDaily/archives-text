SACRAMENTO, May 21 (UP). â€”
Gov. Culbcrt Olson tonight agreed
to call a special election on a $30-
Every-Thursday pension proposal,
but said his sympathy with objec
tives of the plan should not be con
strued to mean he believed it would
be feasible if adopted.
Addressing thousands of "ham
and eggs" advocates at a mass meet
ing at the State Fair grounds, Gov
ernor Olson said: "While I am in
sympathy with its objectives, I do
not want you to infer from my pres
ence here, or the granting of your
petition, that I believe in the feasi
bility of the plan proposed in this
measure, or that it. would accom
plish its objectives, if adopted."
