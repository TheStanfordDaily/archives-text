# IRRESPONSIBLE DRIVERS

J Dear Student-Alumnus No. 1:
I read your very appropriate let
ter of May 18 and wish to congratu
late you on your frank opinion.
I fully agree with your statement
that speeders go unheeded on the
campus at all hours of the day and
night. Your point that the lives of
campus residents are jeopardized as
long as these speeders are permitted
Ito take their course, was well
S brought out. At times I wonder just
! as you and many others have, how
J it is that we have been fortunate in
| not having a traffic death, not. in
| auto vs. auto accidents, but rather
j in auto vs. pedestrian accidents. It
j is a sound policy to keep a car un
| der control at all times, but when
we see some of these speed-maniacs
j pull in and out of congested drive-
I ways, parking lots, and turn cor
ners at excessive speed, we question
j whether they even care whether
| their cars are under control.
! SOLUTION?
Also in your letter, fellow student
alumnus, you refer to additional ap
propriations to meet the salaries of
more traffic officers. Even though I
think that is a splendid idea, before
we make more pressing demands,
let's see if something else will solve
our problem.
Could the traffic officer issue more
citations? Or, could his hours, if
they aren't already, be arranged so
that he can greet the early morn
ing speeders who attempt to make
an 8 o'clock even after getting up
late? He could certainly schedule
his lunch hour so that he could park
on Lasuen or Santa Teresa about 12
o'clock daily and .see if his vision is
quick enough to count the number
of cars that whiz past him. I guar
antee he would see plenty of speed
intermingled with careless driving.
WELFARE AT STAKE
Now for our welfare, do you think
the University authorities, includ
ing the campus chief of police, are
giving any consideration to the im
portance, or should I say the serious
ness of our topic? I recollect faintly
that some time past the acting
comptroller issued a list of traffic
regulations for the University em
| ployees to observe while operating
I University vehicles as well as their
own cars.
I'm sure that the students have
not had a satisfactory chance to ab
sorb some of the very pertinent reg
ulations. So, in view of this, would
it not be a marvelous idea to have
an item in the syllabus fee such as
"traffic regulations and their ob
servance and enforcement, 50 cents,"
so that all students would be abso
lutely conscious of the 20 and 25
miles per hour speed limits and the
safety of campus residents? Its ex
pediency cannot be questioned.
Again, congratulations on your
good work Student Alumnus No. 1.
By the way, what is your name?
