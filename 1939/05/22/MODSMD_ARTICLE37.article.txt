The Editor, Sir:
In reply to a certain "Student
Alumnus" upon the subject of
speeding on the campus, I should
like to bandy a few words of dis
agreement with that worthy who, it
seems, is laboring under the false
impression that speed is the essen
tial factor in determining dangerous
driving on the campus or any place
else. It has always be«n my con
tention, based upon experience and
Wilshire Boulevard, that it is the
inconsiderate driver, the driver
whom you cannot depend on, who is
to be feared more than the petty
speed limit exceeder.
A driver who will pull out from
the curb without a hand signal, who
does not observe boulevard-stop
signs, who suddenly applies his

brakes without fair indication, or
who takes what is not rightfully his
right-of-way at an intersection, is
in my mind ten times as dangerous
as the driver who lawfully deems it
"reasonable and prudent" to exceed
the speed limit slightly. In fact, I
think you would agree that, in gen
eral, if we had considerate drivers
and intelligent pedestrians on the
campus, everybody could drive fast
without anybody objecting.
