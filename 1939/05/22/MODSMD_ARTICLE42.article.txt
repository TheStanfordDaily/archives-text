# Political Union Completes First Year at Stanford
## 
### OLIVER WYMAN 
An institution growing out of undergraduate interest, and organized
to broaden the scope of Stanford's extra-curricular activities, the Polit
ical Union this month completes its first year 011 the campus as a part
of Stanford's expanding tradition. Drought to (lie coast by two men on
tho debate squad who had seen the Yale Union in session last spring,

the idea originally adopted at Ox-4
ford, England, several years ago, be- j
came a reality at Stanford last May. i
Returning from a nation-wide
debating tour, Gerald Marcus, '38,
and Carl Deisenroth, '38, presented I
the Yale plan to campus debaters, I
and it was from this nucleus that the 1
Stanford Union got its start. Adopt
ing the rules of procedure used in
the eastern university, the organi- ;
zation provided machinery for open i
debate on topics of national and in- ;
ternational interest which up to that I
time had for the most part been j
considered only in scattered campus 1
groups. '
FIRST PRESIDENT
Otis Brubaker, now an instructor |
in the history department, was j
elected first president of the Union, !
and Vincent Lemmon followed him j
as head of the growing organization j
during the fall and winter quarters. !
In February Lemmon proposed
a change in the house rules which, j
when incorporated, meant a slight i
differentiation from the original j
Yale practice, but the constitution j
maintains the essential features of j
parliamentary practice as they are j
now found in the British House of |
Commons.
Heading the organization since j
Lemmon's retirement last winter I
quarter has been John Mockovics, J
who led a movement greatly liber- j
alizng the debate procedure on the j
floor of the house. The purpose of '
the new policy has been to encour- ■
age wider participation in house dis- j
cussions, and it has drawn general i
approval at recent meetings.
FACULTY ADVISER
In the capacity of faculty adviser,
Professor Thomas Barclay has wit- 1
nessed the growth of the Union
since its initial debate a year ago, j
and recently commented on the wide |
opportunities the organization gives |
the undergraduate "for a better un- '
derstanding of national affairs."
The Standing Committee has not (
made known the resolution to be !
presented at next Thursday's meet- 1
ing, but indicated that any under- f
graduates desiring information re
garding membership in the Union
should call Bob Wood, head of the j
election committee, at the S.A.E. j
house.
