# Cards Second in P.C.C. Meet Behind U.S.C. as Records Fall
## Cal Gets Third; Jeffrey Cracks Century Mark 
### 
With monotonous regularity
U.S.C.'s track team won another
meet, this time the Pacific Coast Con
ference, but not without some ex
ceptional record breaking and some
thrilling races.
The Trojans gathered 67 points
to take first while the Card cinder
men coasted in a strong second with
45, safely ahead of Cal at 38. W;ish
ington State followed with 30, Ore
gon 15' 2, U.C.L.A. 13, Montana 7,
Oregon State 5, Washington, the
meet's host, and Idaho 2.
During the course of the after
noon's activities six Coast Confer
ence records were broken and two
tied. Stanford's Clyde Jeffrey did his
share of damage to the record book
by first breaking the mark of 9.7
held by Draper and Talley of S.C.
with a sizzling 9.6 century. He later
lied the 220-yard mark of 21 flat as
he won his second victory of the
day.
SHOT-PUT UPSET
Another event to yield a new
meet record and the most startling
upset of the day was the shot-put.
Herb Michaels, Cal putter, thrice
beaten by Indians Stan Andersen
and Bill Wohle, got off a heave of
52 ft. 41/2 in., which toppled the Card
weightmen from their throne and
broke the old mark by 3 inches.
Leather lunged Louis Zamperini
opened the assault on records with
a thrilling 4:16.3 mile run which
eclipsed Edson Burrows' record
time of 4:17.9. Zamperini took
Stanford's "Mushy" Girard and
Cal's Cecil Cole in the stretch
sprint, but "Mush" came through
to beat his Bear rival for the sec
ond spot.
However, two northern distance
men were too tough for Zamp in
the 880 and, the tired Trojan had
to be satisfied with third behind
Dale of W.S.C. and Storli of Ore
gon in a 1:54.6 half—slow time for
any of these three runners.
HURDLER PLACES
Bill Hawkins of Stanford proved
himself to be the best all-around
hurdler on the field by taking a
close second behind Troy's Hum
phreys in a 14.6 flight of highs and
later coming back for a surprise
fourth place in the lows. In both
races "Hawk" was running against
specialists in either the highs or
lows, but he was able to place high
in both.
Captain Stan Hiserman ran the
race he is now getting used to. Stan
was a close second behind the great
Earl Vickery of U.S.C. in a record
breaking 23.3 race of low hurdles.
Big Pete Zagar, another of Coach
Dink Templeton's prize weightmen,
performed as was expected, win
ning the discus with a heave of
157 ft. 4 in. Pete cut the margin
pretty close, for he was only 4
inches ahead of Wrotnoski of S.C.
UNEXPECTED POINTS
But. Stanford's real heroes of the
day were the flock of cindermen
who made the trip North worth
something by coming through for
unexpected fourths and fifths to help
swell the Indian point total.
Paul Moore gave evidence of what
a great runner he could have been
this year if not for injury by taking
a fifth in the mile. Dick Carew
.showed signs of his old self by
grabbing ofi' fifths in both the
sprints.
And Dick Simpson hurdled him
self into a fifth place in the highs
while Allen Grey Hipped the shot
48 ft. 11 in. for another fifth and a
valuable point. Bill Bi'aheny main
tained the Cardinal monopoly on
fifths in his department by hurling
the javelin 193 ft. 9 in. for another
point. Ilamp Pool took a fourth in
the discus with a toss of 145 ft. 5 in.,
and the tired and makeshift relay
team of Carew, Johnson, Rockwell,
and Jeffrey grabbed another fifth.

performed as was expected, win
ning the discus with a heave of
157 ft. 4 in. Pete cut the margin
pretty close, for he was only 4
inches ahead of Wrotnoski of S.C.
UNEXPECTED POINTS
But. Stanford's real heroes of the
day were the flock of cindermen
who made the trip North worth
something by coming through for
unexpected fourths and fifths to help
swell the Indian point total.
Paul Moore gave evidence of what
a great runner he could have been
this year if not for injury by taking
a fifth in the mile. Dick Carew
.showed signs of his old self by
grabbing ofi' fifths in both the
sprints.
And Dick Simpson hurdled him
self into a fifth place in the highs
while Allen Grey Hipped the shot
48 ft. 11 in. for another fifth and a
valuable point. Bill Bi'aheny main
tained the Cardinal monopoly on
fifths in his department by hurling
the javelin 193 ft. 9 in. for another
point. Ilamp Pool took a fourth in
the discus with a toss of 145 ft. 5 in.,
and the tired and makeshift relay
team of Carew, Johnson, Rockwell,
and Jeffrey grabbed another fifth.
With monotonous regularity
U.S.C.'s track team won another
meet, this time the Pacific Coast Con
ference, but not without some ex
ceptional record breaking and some
thrilling races.
The Trojans gathered 67 points
to take first while the Card cinder
men coasted in a strong second with
45, safely ahead of Cal at 38. W;ish
ington State followed with 30, Ore
gon 15' 2, U.C.L.A. 13, Montana 7,
Oregon State 5, Washington, the
meet's host, and Idaho 2.
During the course of the after
noon's activities six Coast Confer
ence records were broken and two
tied. Stanford's Clyde Jeffrey did his
share of damage to the record book
by first breaking the mark of 9.7
held by Draper and Talley of S.C.
with a sizzling 9.6 century. He later
lied the 220-yard mark of 21 flat as
he won his second victory of the
day.
SHOT-PUT UPSET
Another event to yield a new
meet record and the most startling
upset of the day was the shot-put.
Herb Michaels, Cal putter, thrice
beaten by Indians Stan Andersen
and Bill Wohle, got off a heave of
52 ft. 41/2 in., which toppled the Card
weightmen from their throne and
broke the old mark by 3 inches.
Leather lunged Louis Zamperini
opened the assault on records with
a thrilling 4:16.3 mile run which
eclipsed Edson Burrows' record
time of 4:17.9. Zamperini took
Stanford's "Mushy" Girard and
Cal's Cecil Cole in the stretch
sprint, but "Mush" came through
to beat his Bear rival for the sec
ond spot.
However, two northern distance
men were too tough for Zamp in
the 880 and, the tired Trojan had
to be satisfied with third behind
Dale of W.S.C. and Storli of Ore
gon in a 1:54.6 half—slow time for
any of these three runners.
HURDLER PLACES
Bill Hawkins of Stanford proved
himself to be the best all-around
hurdler on the field by taking a
close second behind Troy's Hum
phreys in a 14.6 flight of highs and
later coming back for a surprise
fourth place in the lows. In both
races "Hawk" was running against
specialists in either the highs or
lows, but he was able to place high
in both.
Captain Stan Hiserman ran the
race he is now getting used to. Stan
was a close second behind the great
Earl Vickery of U.S.C. in a record
breaking 23.3 race of low hurdles.
Big Pete Zagar, another of Coach
Dink Templeton's prize weightmen,
performed as was expected, win

sprint, but "Mush" came through
to beat his Bear rival for the sec
ond spot.
However, two northern distance
men were too tough for Zamp in
the 880 and, the tired Trojan had
to be satisfied with third behind
Dale of W.S.C. and Storli of Ore
gon in a 1:54.6 half—slow time for
any of these three runners.
HURDLER PLACES
Bill Hawkins of Stanford proved
himself to be the best all-around
hurdler on the field by taking a
close second behind Troy's Hum
phreys in a 14.6 flight of highs and
later coming back for a surprise
fourth place in the lows. In both
races "Hawk" was running against
specialists in either the highs or
lows, but he was able to place high
in both.
Captain Stan Hiserman ran the
race he is now getting used to. Stan
was a close second behind the great
Earl Vickery of U.S.C. in a record
breaking 23.3 race of low hurdles.
Big Pete Zagar, another of Coach
Dink Templeton's prize weightmen,
performed as was expected, win
ning the discus with a heave of
157 ft. 4 in. Pete cut the margin
pretty close, for he was only 4
inches ahead of Wrotnoski of S.C.
UNEXPECTED POINTS
But. Stanford's real heroes of the
day were the flock of cindermen
who made the trip North worth
something by coming through for
unexpected fourths and fifths to help
swell the Indian point total.
Paul Moore gave evidence of what
a great runner he could have been
this year if not for injury by taking
a fifth in the mile. Dick Carew
.showed signs of his old self by
grabbing ofi' fifths in both the
sprints.
And Dick Simpson hurdled him
self into a fifth place in the highs
while Allen Grey Hipped the shot
48 ft. 11 in. for another fifth and a
valuable point. Bill Bi'aheny main
tained the Cardinal monopoly on
fifths in his department by hurling
the javelin 193 ft. 9 in. for another
point. Ilamp Pool took a fourth in
the discus with a toss of 145 ft. 5 in.,
and the tired and makeshift relay
team of Carew, Johnson, Rockwell,
and Jeffrey grabbed another fifth.
