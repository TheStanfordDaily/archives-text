# 'Diz' Successful In Comeback
## Pitches Cubs 4-0 Win Over Boston 
### 
NEW YORK, May 21 (UP). -
Dizzy Dean, his fireball gone but his
pitching wizardry intact, joined the
select group of baseball players
who have "come back'' today when
he blanked the Boston Bees with
three hits and brought the Chicago
Cubs a 4-0 victory as Standings in
the National League remained un
changed.
With practically nothing left of
his former speed, Dean employed a
sweeping curve, and a baffling
change of pace to halt the Bees at
every step. He was never in trouble
and exhibited marvelous control, is
suing no walks and fanning two. It
was his first win of the year.
A three-run first inning was
enough for the first place St. Louis
Cardinals and they downed the
Philadelphia Phillies, 5-2, to hold
their slender first place lead over
the Cincinnati Reds.
