## Footwork, Passing Stressed in Nightly Practice Sessions 
### 
Stanford's future success on the
j basketball court, more than five
i months away, is already being
| planned, with intensive spring bas
i ketball practice being held every
J afternoon in the Pavilion,
Practice opened less than two
I weeks ago and has featured thor
ough drills in fundamentals. The
J fundamentals emphasized are work
I in shooting, ball handling and pass
| ing, footwork, balance, and timing
i offensive plays.
Coach Everett Dean has planned
\ a detailed program for the remain
j der of the practice season. This
i week scrimmage games will be hold
i for the first time and the men will
! be tried in different combinations.
TOURNAMENT DUE
When fairly even combinations
i have been found, an elimination
tournament will be held. Each
i team will be named after this year's
graduating basketball stars.
Coach Dean says it is too early to
predict the success of the next year's
■ varsity. "Things are not too bright,
j The future is problematical, de
j pending upon such circumstan«*es as
! the condition of Burness' knee and
| the new material that we get."
Speaking of new material, Dean
emphasized that Stanford basket-
I ball should be for California and
! western boys. Thus, discounting any
I takl of raiding Indiana for players.
J. C. PROSPECTS

I ned down, he indicated that there
are strong possibilities of enrolling
some good junior college cage men.

enough to select individual stars, for
we haven't even had a scrimmage,"
| Dean explained. >l ßut several of
| the boys look better than during last
: season."

Stanford's future success on the
j basketball court, more than five
i months away, is already being
| planned, with intensive spring bas
i ketball practice being held every
J afternoon in the Pavilion,
Practice opened less than two
I weeks ago and has featured thor
ough drills in fundamentals. The
J fundamentals emphasized are work
I in shooting, ball handling and pass
| ing, footwork, balance, and timing
i offensive plays.
Coach Everett Dean has planned
\ a detailed program for the remain
j der of the practice season. This
i week scrimmage games will be hold
i for the first time and the men will
! be tried in different combinations.
TOURNAMENT DUE
When fairly even combinations
i have been found, an elimination
tournament will be held. Each
i team will be named after this year's
graduating basketball stars.
Coach Dean says it is too early to
predict the success of the next year's
■ varsity. "Things are not too bright,
j The future is problematical, de
j pending upon such circumstan«*es as
! the condition of Burness' knee and
| the new material that we get."
Speaking of new material, Dean
emphasized that Stanford basket-
I ball should be for California and
! western boys. Thus, discounting any
I takl of raiding Indiana for players.
J. C. PROSPECTS
j Although Dean could not be pin-
I ned down, he indicated that there
are strong possibilities of enrolling
some good junior college cage men.
"We haven't been going long
enough to select individual stars, for
we haven't even had a scrimmage,"
| Dean explained. >l ßut several of
| the boys look better than during last
: season."
Men turning out for spring prac
tice are John Alltucker, Wilbert
Anderson, Bob Breckner, Don Bur
ness, Bill Cowden, Tilford Denton,
| Oliver Hamlin, Verne Hoffman, Ed
win Jones, Leon Lafaille, Kai Lar
j sen, Horace Lee, Harvey Lyon, Bob
I Oakford, and Walter Oberlander.
