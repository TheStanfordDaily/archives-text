# Stanford Polo Team Sweeps Utah in 2-match Series
## 
### 
Card poloists returned to the
Farm from Salt Lake City kite last
night by horseless carriage with
! straight wins chalked up lo their
record for the four-game series with
: the University of Utah. In the two
matches held over the week-end,
the Indians showed themselves in
fine form on strange mounts and on
a foreign field by out-riding their
! opponents, 10-4, 7-3.
In the first game Steve Downey
was outstanding, making all of the
10 Card goals. While he individually
I starred, much of the scoring was
due to close teamwork and sure
passing.
FAST FIELD
The Indians experienced some dif
, fieulty in getting used to the last
roll on the dirt field, but got their
j eye early enough to have little
trouble in downing the crack Utah
squad.
David Brooks, alternating for Jim
Fullerton, team captain, who was
unable to make the trip, turned the
supposed weak link in the Indian
four to an asset with the sure, hard
: riding game he turned in.
FIRST HALF CLOSE
With the Utah malletmen coming
I back with a vengeance, the second
match was marked by close scores
up until the last half when the
! Cards went ahead. In this game
| Doug Keese, who played the No. 3
' position vacated by Captain Fuller
) ton, and Louis Metzger who went
iin for Walt Sullivan, turned in
I scores with first-rate performance.
