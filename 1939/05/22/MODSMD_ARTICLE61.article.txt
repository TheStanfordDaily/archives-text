DEMOCRACY hammered insistently on Car
dinals' door two weeks ago when Ex Com
mittee suggested a change in the organization's
traditional means of obtaining members —self-
perpetuation.
Cardinals had been choosing Cardinals for
a long time, receiving automatic approval by
Ex Committee of their selections. The result
was that the organization became ingrown,
composed only of friends and acquaintances of
former Cardinals. Naturally this was a limited,
unrepresentative group.
Also these students who were to plan activi
ties already were prominent in activities. They
had enough to do already—so much that they
often have functioned with second- or third-rate
efficiency.
Ex Committee's suggestion was that Cardinals
choose a relatively large number of prospective
members, more than necessary to fill the va
cancies. Cardinals has done this; Saturday it
selected nominations for the nine vacancies.
Yes, Democracy hammered on the door. And
Cardinals appears to have opened the door a
little in complying with Ex Committee's sug
gestion. But Cardinals probably realized that
Ex Committee could have forced compliance
with that suggestion.
The point is that Cardinals is a creature of
Ex Committee. Ex Committee can ignore these
nominations completely if it likes, making the
appointments entirely by itself.
But Ex Committee is going to "play ball." It
is going to appoint a committee to interview
these nominees and do its selecting from these
findings.
Ex Committee will do well to remember, how
ever, that it need not abide by these nomina
tions. If it is satisfied by only eight of the
proposed names, it can choose as the ninth any
one it chooses.—R. D.
