# No Sudden Death?
## 
### 
IN the sound and fury of today's campus opin
ion, a local alumnus deplores the speed of
student drivers, and an undergraduate rebuts
with proof that fast driving is not the cause of
most accidents.
But one crack-up resulting in physical in
jury has marred the records in George and
Gordy's domain this year, and that one involved
two conservative faculty members. That all
Stanford students were born under the right
sign is improbable. Rather, one is led to con
clude that they are not as careless as the local
citizenry would like to believe.
Speed, it must be granted, is not their strong
point, but a strong majority of them are skilled
drivers, seldom if ever guilty of going through
stop signs, sweeping too widely around cor
ners, or using the wrong side of the road. Youth,
which is supposed to be responsible for poor
judgment, pays dividends in guick mental and
muscular reaction.
Stanford's traffic authorities have established
a record unmatched by any comparable com
munity. The surveillance of the officers is un
impeachable; Men's and Women's Councils are
unescapable.
Of late, bushes, fences, and other impedi
menta have been clipped and torn down to
eliminate blind corners on the campus. The
University is conscious of the importance of
safety precautions, and its attitude is, to a large
extent, responsible for the scarcity of accidents.
Actual figures, not superficial personal ob
servations, are a valid basis for criticism of
Stanford traffic conditions. And death and de
struction are absent from the record.â€”L. L.
