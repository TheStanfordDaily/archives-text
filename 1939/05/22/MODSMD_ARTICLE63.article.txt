THE third of Stanford's publications is ready
for distribution today—on time.
As the Quad's 1,950 buyers thumb through
the 1939 edition of the book, they will be more
than satisfied that they have received their
money's worth.
Piece by piece, as proofs and forms came
back from the City, word filtered out of the
Quad offices that this year's book was good.
Last week, at a preview party, that word was
substantiated. This year's book is not only
good, it's the best one that Stanford has ever
seen.
Color pages, candid shots, informal pictures
show Stanford as it is, yet manage to portray
some of the underlying feeling of Stanford life
—that intangible quality that does not appear
on the surface in black and white.
To the people who produced the book, to
Frank Lippmann, its editor, and Margaret Hale,
business manager, particularly, Stanford owes
congratulations for an excellent job.
To the persons who are about to assume staff
positions for next year, a word of warning that
they will have to go a long way to pioduce as
fine a book in 1940.
