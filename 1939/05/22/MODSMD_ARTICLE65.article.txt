SWING OUT SOLDIER
J/VERYONE, from Stanford cabbages to Balkan
kings, is looking for signs of war . Some claim to
find them in the scare headlines, in the accounts of
diplomatic meetings and dictator doings.
But no one knows anything for sure except that
war-scare headlines, diplomats, and dictators can't be
trusted. They may herald war, or they may not. But
other thermometers of war fever are being overlooked,
signs which are far more accurate than any 72-point
banner across a Chronicle front page.
One of these measuring sticks is music. Two critics
that I know of have noted the significance of the
simultaneous, and somewhat sinister, release of George
M. Cohan's "We Must Be Ready," and Kate Smith's
recording of "The Star Spangled Banner." One of
these is Dr. Warren D. Allen, at Stanford, who spoke
to his class the other night about war music. He
started by sketching the connection between the two
in past conflicts and ended up by inking: "If war is
declared tomorrow, what will you march to?" When
the class sat silently, he commanded. "Well, say it!"
And the answer was unanimous and obvious:
"Swing!"
For, war music is popular music. It always has
been. There is no special brand, dusted off for the
occasion. The music that you sing at. home, hear on
the radio, bellow at the close of a liquid evening is the
same music that will march you down to the enlist
ment office and over the top.
Men feel better about fighting if they could hear
the music they danced to at home.

the requence back. American war music
has always been the music of the church or the
home. Yes—the church. The Puritans centered their
musical lives there, and so Colonial troops marched to
Calvinistic psalm times.
Civil War troops sang folk and dance songs. "Dixie"
was a walk-around dance written for a minstrel show,
"Battle Hymn of the Republic," an old camp-meeting
negro song known first as "John Brown's Body."
The cocky Americans in the Spanish-American war
danced and marched to the then-popular two-steps.
The music had the quick jerky rhythm of the slogan,
"Remember the Maine, To Hell with Spain."
And in the World War, Cohan started the ball roll
ing with dance songs like "Yankee Doodle Dandy,"
and "Over There." He has been quoted as saying
that "Over There" won the war, and he isn't far wrong,
as far as American troops are concerned. Irving Ber
lin and the rest of the commercial writers turned out
war songs by the dozens; music halls, phonographs,
variety shows, mass meetings, parades, homes, church
es, dances resounded with war music—exactly the
same sort of musical stuff that made peace-time,
dance-time music.
And today? Dr. Allen has told his classes the an
swer: it will bo swing, hard-biting, captivating swing,
the same music that ail nine campus dances Satur
day night danced to. Perhaps there will be new
words, but it won't be necessary. Bands will play
"Tiger," or "Bugle Call Rag," and regiments will
quick-step down the street. "St. Louis Blues" will
comfort Missouri troops when they're exhausted and
scared and cold. And new songs, like "We Must Be
Ready." will be written.
In these musical terms can war fever best be read.
For music prepares a peaceful nation to become a
hysterical, hating mass. It makes them psychologically
ready, and when sufficient emotional powder has been
heaped, the pile will explode.
Psychologically, America is musically ready for
war. Open your ears, and you can hear it taking hold.
And you might as well listen now.
Perhaps son, you won't be able to listen carefully
to the same music you danced to this week-end. The
noise of your own marching feet will drown it out.
