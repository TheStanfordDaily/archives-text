BLIND DATING

TOUGII

LOVE AM) PLATO

He called her in the morning and in the afternoon
and at night, and the next afternoon he called her
last, of all. He wanted a date. He had his line all
set, he knew just what he was going to sayâ€”but she
was never in.
Every time he called the girl in the room next door
answered the phone.
He got to know her quite well. The last time he
called, this girl said the other girl was in the beauty
parlor.
Oh, the guy said.
Finally in desperation he said, "What the hell. Has
she or hasn't she got a dale."
"Yes," the girl said. "I'm sorry."
It wasn't until a week later that he found out the
girl on the phone had thought he had asked her if
she had a date.
"Yes," she had said. "I'm sorry."
But if she hadn't had a date, and had made one
with him, and he had not understood and had gone
that night to pick up the other girl. . . .

One of the football backs was feeling happy like a
whale. He got into position and waited for the ball to
be snapped.
"Three little fishies in an itty bitty poo," he sang,
and then louder, "Three little fishies in an itty bitty
poo."
A snort of disgust. He turns around. Tiny Thorn
hill is standing in back of him. Glaring.

He thought it all over very carefully. They had
been going together for some time. One night when
the moon had been risjht, he had held her hand.
"Yes," he told the boys in his house, "I think I
am becoming quite fond of the dear girl."
The next night he gave her his pin.

And last year one of the boys gave his pin to a
girl he had gone with for many moons.
Humor has it that they slapped each other on the
bark and exchanged mutual congratulations at that
very tender moment.
