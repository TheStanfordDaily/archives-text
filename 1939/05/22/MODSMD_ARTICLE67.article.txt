# Stevenson's Early Days Described in 'Silverado'

### 
"Stevenson nt Silverado." by
Anne Holler Issler; pnl>lislied by
Caxton Printers.
The oddly guided destiny of Rob
ert Louis Stevenson forced his er
rant footsteps from his ancestral
home in Edinburgh to a high moun
tain in northern California.
It's a long way from Silverado
Mine, on Mount Saint Helena near
Calistoga, to Scotland. But of all the
places inhabited by Stevenson—Eng
land. France, Samoa, and Ihe United
States—none bears the impress of
his presence more strongly than the
rolling hills north of San Francisco,
the Napa Valley, where he and Fan
ny Osbourne spent their honey
moon.
TRAVEL BOOK
Here, tired, ill, and discouraged,
Stevenson wrote the notes from
which he later constructed "The Sil
verado Squatters," appraised as one
of his best travel books. During the
summer he spent at the ramshackle
mine, high in the warm, dry air of
northern California, he regained his i
health and came to know and un- <
derstand the simple, rather pictur- i
esque people who inhabited the!
region.

f And yet biographers have, until |
; now, overlooked this period of the (
! great author's life. The task ofj
chronicling Stevenson's Silverado!
days fell to Mrs. Issler. Her record
is based on the personal reminis
i eences of those who still remember
the man who lived among them.
QUILT HUMOR
In the series of conversations, in- j
terviews, and interpretive comment i
that make up the book, Mrs. Issler
never allows pedagogical discussion j
to stifle her story. A flair for quiet |
humor relieves over-serious parts. \
She describes the same people about j
whom Stevenson wove so fascinat- I
ing a tale with sympathy and intel
ligent care. And the result is an j
amazingly well integrated book that 1
paints one strong portrait of a j
buoyant, vivacious man, sensitive j
and imaginative, and a strange blend !
of Calvinlst and artist.
While the book is essentially bio- j
graphical, it serves the second pur- j
pose of conveying the environmental i
relationship between Stevenson and j
the bright, casual hills of northern |
California that were a refuge for a ;
very troubled young man. — Hutch- j
