# Convincing Acting Highlights Plays
## 
### 
Clever and sprightly plots, coupled
with excellent performance by •iein
bers of both casts, made thoroughly
enjoyable the two German comedies
played in a packed Little Theater
Friday evening.
Giving a convincing performance
of the mad apothecary in "Der
Moerder," Quentin Warren provided
the only serious note in the comedy.
The other members of the cast en
tered into the comic spirit of com
mon misunderstandings, which based
the play's plot.
Good acting on the part of all the
members of the cast of "Panne vor
Alt-Heidelberg" made this second
comedy equally successful, and
proved to the audience that romance
in old Heidelberg is not dead.
