# Food Research Institute Collects Reports, Statistics

### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
On the southeast corner of the
Inner Quad, Stanford's Food Re
search Institute is located, but to
the surprise of many, no appetizing
odors of food emanate from this
building.
Regardless of the vague popular
notion that the Institute is merely a
cooking school, the duties of this
division of the School of Social
Sciences are much more important
than tinkering with pots and pans.
In fact, if any one division at
Stanford has achieved world rec
ognition, it is the Food Research In-
It receives data from almost all of
the countries of the world, and in
turn the results of the institute's
work is spread throughout the
globe.
BUILDS KNOWLEDGE
"The broad purpose of the Insti
tute," as stated in one of its recent
publications, "is to build up an accu
rate and increasingly comprehensive
body of significant knowledge con
cerning food production, trade con
sumption, and prices.
"Chief emphasis is laid on eco
nomic aspects of food problems.
Special attention is given to the
world position, to international re
lationships, to governmental policies
in their bearing on agriculture, and
on food marketing, prices, and
consumption."
Research deals primarily with
wheat, fats, and oils, and is accom
plished through analyzing and in-

terpreting printed reports and
statistics. About 400 periodicals arc
continually being received, from
which then analyzations are made.
Results of the research are published
in "Studies" and distributed
throughout the world.
PUBLISHED INFORMATION
The importance of the institute
lies in the published information
concerning certain foodstuffs that
are of untold aid to farmers and
governments. Over 130 books and
pamphlets have been published up
to 1938.
Professor Merrill K. Bennett, eco
nomic geographer, explains the re
search on wheat. "We try to look
at world agriculture, using wheat as
the focus. We keep track of world
wheat news through many period
icals. Statistics are compiled, in
cluding the production, consump
tion, imports, and exports of every
country.
ANALYSES MADE
"The future of wheat is analyzed
in terms of past development. We
seek to learn whether volume of
production will increase, and how
much wheat is carried as stocks.
Even what changes of prices are
probable."
The institute was established in
1921 by the University trustees and
from grants by the Carnegie Corpo
ration. Although research is the
primary purpose, a limited amount
of instruction is offered to advanced
students.

statistics. About 400 periodicals arc
continually being received, from
which then analyzations are made.
Results of the research are published
in "Studies" and distributed
throughout the world.
PUBLISHED INFORMATION
The importance of the institute
lies in the published information
concerning certain foodstuffs that
are of untold aid to farmers and
governments. Over 130 books and
pamphlets have been published up
to 1938.
Professor Merrill K. Bennett, eco
nomic geographer, explains the re
search on wheat. "We try to look
at world agriculture, using wheat as
the focus. We keep track of world
wheat news through many period
icals. Statistics are compiled, in
cluding the production, consump
tion, imports, and exports of every
country.
ANALYSES MADE
"The future of wheat is analyzed
in terms of past development. We
seek to learn whether volume of
production will increase, and how
much wheat is carried as stocks.
Even what changes of prices are
probable."
The institute was established in
1921 by the University trustees and
from grants by the Carnegie Corpo
ration. Although research is the
primary purpose, a limited amount
of instruction is offered to advanced
students.
On the southeast corner of the
Inner Quad, Stanford's Food Re
search Institute is located, but to
the surprise of many, no appetizing
odors of food emanate from this
building.
Regardless of the vague popular
notion that the Institute is merely a
cooking school, the duties of this
division of the School of Social
Sciences are much more important
than tinkering with pots and pans.
In fact, if any one division at
Stanford has achieved world rec
ognition, it is the Food Research In-
It receives data from almost all of
the countries of the world, and in
turn the results of the institute's
work is spread throughout the
globe.
BUILDS KNOWLEDGE
"The broad purpose of the Insti
tute," as stated in one of its recent
publications, "is to build up an accu
rate and increasingly comprehensive
body of significant knowledge con
cerning food production, trade con
sumption, and prices.
"Chief emphasis is laid on eco
nomic aspects of food problems.
Special attention is given to the
world position, to international re
lationships, to governmental policies
in their bearing on agriculture, and
on food marketing, prices, and
consumption."
Research deals primarily with
wheat, fats, and oils, and is accom
plished through analyzing and in-

terpreting printed reports and
statistics. About 400 periodicals arc
continually being received, from
which then analyzations are made.
Results of the research are published
in "Studies" and distributed
throughout the world.
