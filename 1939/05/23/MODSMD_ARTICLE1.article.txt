WO the nations went to war. They
k took this step after enlightened
leaders agreed that things had come
to such a sorry state that they could
be improved only by making them
worse.
The leaders, of course, did not use
ihi.s precise phrase. On the con
trary, they went to the slogan bar
rel, somewhat cob-webbed since
1914, and hauled out battle cries
which had been effective more than
20 years ago. These they slightly
revised and repolished, so that they
read: "Fight Fascism!" "Save Amer
ica for the Americans!" "Make the
Western Hemisphere Safe for De
mocracy!"
And on the other side of the ocean
they read: "Sons of Germany, Italy
and Fascist Spain, Unite!" "The
Axis Will Abolish Taxes!" "Cleanse
the World of the Jewish Cabal!"
And spurred by these gentle
urgings, millions of young men
went to the various fronts, where
they massacred each other with
great earnestness, while civilian
populations starved behind the
lines, or were wiped out by en
emy fleets, all going to prove that
you can conquer error and death
by heaping on a lot more of it.
* *
United States was a little late
in getting into the second World
War because it took the militarist
faction in Congress some tedious
time to prove that the best interests
of neutrality would be served by be
ing unneutral, and that the pacifist
intentions of America would best be
advanced by going to war.
In paving the way for the war dec
laration, propagandists naturally
availed themselves of the technique
developed during the last war.
They said that American free insti
tutions were menaced and could be
preserved only by war. They said
that war would bring on not only a
fresh demonstration of national uni
ty, but also a wave of prosperity.
They said that farmers and laborers
would benefit enormously by the
impetus of the Allied demand for
manufactured goods and produce.
So war was declared, and Amer
ica preserved its free institutions
by conscripting labor as well as
soldiers, by prohibiting strikes, by
establishing a rigid censorship
over all publications and jailing
dissenters, includng the Ludlow
itcs who still clamored pitifully for
a war referendum.
And prosperity came with an in
crease in wages, only to be oblit
erated swiftly by a double increase
in the costs of food and rent, and
an increase in taxation caused by a
20-billion-dollar wartime deficit
plus a 30-billion loan to the Allies.
A year, two years, three years
passed and the millennium did not
arrive. Nothing arrived but casualty
lists columns long, and misery and
hunger, and bombing planes, and
plagues of pellagra and a strange
new disease against, which medical
men had no weapon. And a blight
descended upon all the acres of the
earth.
* * <■
IVOW more months passed and
tho world was in shambles. In
the smoking ruins of what was once
a great American city rats and other
vermin scuttled, and sly, prowling
things which came out only at night.
And among these beasts tottered one
old man, quite mad, who had fought
in this war and in the last war and
who by some miracle had escaped
death, though his mind was touched.
This old man, pottering among the
ruins for a morsel of food, kept re
peating over and over again into
his dirty beard:
"110, (hey told me that the
memory of me, the Unknown Sol
dier, would go down into history.
History—what is history? History
is the record of man's amazing
capacity for repeating blunders."

United States was a little late
in getting into the second World
War because it took the militarist
faction in Congress some tedious
time to prove that the best interests
of neutrality would be served by be
ing unneutral, and that the pacifist
intentions of America would best be
advanced by going to war.
In paving the way for the war dec
laration, propagandists naturally
availed themselves of the technique
developed during the last war.
They said that American free insti
tutions were menaced and could be
preserved only by war. They said
that war would bring on not only a
fresh demonstration of national uni
ty, but also a wave of prosperity.
They said that farmers and laborers
would benefit enormously by the
impetus of the Allied demand for
manufactured goods and produce.
So war was declared, and Amer
ica preserved its free institutions
by conscripting labor as well as
soldiers, by prohibiting strikes, by
establishing a rigid censorship
over all publications and jailing
dissenters, includng the Ludlow
itcs who still clamored pitifully for
a war referendum.
And prosperity came with an in
crease in wages, only to be oblit
erated swiftly by a double increase
in the costs of food and rent, and
an increase in taxation caused by a
20-billion-dollar wartime deficit
plus a 30-billion loan to the Allies.
A year, two years, three years
passed and the millennium did not
arrive. Nothing arrived but casualty
lists columns long, and misery and
hunger, and bombing planes, and
plagues of pellagra and a strange
new disease against, which medical
men had no weapon. And a blight
descended upon all the acres of the
earth.
