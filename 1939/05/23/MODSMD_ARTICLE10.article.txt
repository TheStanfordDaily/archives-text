# Berlin, Rome Sign 10-year Peace Pact
## Alliance Intended As Blow to Anglo-French United Peace Front 
### 
BERLIN, May 22 (UP).—Germany
and Italy today signed a 10-year
military alliance as their "deter
mined answer to the democratic war
mongers," but assured the world
every outstanding European prob
lem can be settled without resort to
war.
The signing of the pact, by Ciano
and German Foreign Minister Joa
chim von Ribbentrop, inquired only
four minutes and was witnessed by
Hitler who unsmilingly shook hands
with the two foreign ministers after
it was over.
Despite the professed desires for
peaceful settlements in Europe —
Italy's Mediterranean claims against
France as well as the Polish-German
dispute — Ciano and Ribbentrop
made it clear the alliance was in
tended as a counter blow to the
Anglo-French "peace front" in Eu
rope.
ALLIANCE PUBLISHED
The seven-point alliance, designed
for "either peace or war," was pub
lished textually but Italian quarters
announced it would be supplemented
by secret, agreements dividing Eu
rope, the Mediterranean and North
Africa in Nazi and Fascist zones of
influence.
1. Germany and Italy agree to
pursue a common policy on "all
questions of common interest or
touching the general European situ
ation."
2. If their common interests are
endangered in any way "they will
enter into consultation concerning
measures necessary to protect their
interests" and "if the security or
other vital interests of either party
shall be threatened from the outside
the other party will lend the threat
ened party full political and diplo
matic support in order to eliminate
the threat."
If either Germany or Italy should
become involved in war "against the
wishes and hopes of the parties, the
other party will immediately come
to his aid as an ally and support
him with all military power, on land,
sea and air."
INCREASE CO-OPERATION
4. In order to carry out these
commitments both Italy and Ger
many will "deepen their co-opera
tion on military grounds and in the
field of military economy" and will
"remain in regular consultation con
cerning other measures necessary to
the practical effectuation of these
obligations."
5. The two nations agree "in case
of a commonly conducted war to
conclude an armistice and peace only
in full agreement with one another."
6. Both powers "recognize the sig
nificance of their joint relations to
the powers friendly to them" (the
nations of the anti-Communist pact
including Japan, Spain, Hungary and
Manchukuo) and are "determined to
maintain these relations and regu
late them on a common basis, bind
ing them to these powers."
7. The pact is effective immedi
ately for 10 years, before the end
of which they will consult regarding
its extension.
