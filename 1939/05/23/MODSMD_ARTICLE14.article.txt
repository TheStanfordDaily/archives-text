# Spring Show to Glorify Jack Came as Industry
## 
### 
For most Stanfordites, "jacks" is
a game you played as a kid. But to
Mr. Featherstone, and his son, Bill,
in Ram's Head's "Wake Up and
Leave," jacks is an industry, as well
as a headache to the elder Feather
stone.
Taking place for the most part at
Ivory Towers University, where Bill
Featherstone goes to school, "Wake
Up and Leave" tells the story of the

jack industry, glorified to magnifi
cent scales. Mr. Featherstone has
sent Bill to Ivory Towers in spite of
the fact that his son prefers to enter
the jack business with his father.
Bored with university lite at
Towers—reputedly an accurate sat

j ire of Stanford—Bill starts a rival
j jack industry in his fraternity,
! threatens to run his father out of
| business. Putting life into the chil
j dren's game, Bill's fraternity broth
j er.s design platinum jacks for opera
| wear, organize intramural jack
j tournaments, and sweep the country
j with the revitalized game.
Anxious to discover the source of
| the rival business, Mr. Featherstone
j sends Tony Spumoni, gangster's son,
| down to Towers, only to have Joe
i taken into the jack industry by
I Bill's fraternity.
The happily-ever-aftcr twist
| comes when Mardi, Bill's girl, tricks
j Mr. Featherstone into merging with
I the Towers firm before he realizes
i that his own son is president of the
i company.
Mr. Featherstone will be played
by Charley Bulotti; Bill, by Bob
| Stephens. Gerry Schreiber will take
the part of Mardi, while her rival
will lie played by Eloise Lam be rt.
Director J. P. Cahn has an
nounced that curtain for "Wake Up
1 and Leave" next Friday and Satur
| day nights will go up at 8 o'clock
j sharp, and that late-comers will not
jbe seated until the first break in
j the show.
