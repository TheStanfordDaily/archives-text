# Mrs. Cubberley Serves Farm As 'Second Mrs. Stanford'
## 
### MARY JUDSON 
"It is with great pride ..."
With these words Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur expressed Stanford's senti
ments as he accepted a portrait of
Helen Van Uxem Cubberley last
Thursday, to be added to the Uni
versity's collection.
A loyal Stanfordite since her first
day here, 41 years ago, when she ar
rived on campus here with the "new
professor" in the education depart
ment, Mrs. Cubberley has been
somewhat of a second Mrs. Stanford
to the Farm.
GRADUATED HERE
In order to better aid Dr. Cub
berley in his work of building up
Stanford's Education Department,
Mrs. Cubberley registered at the
University as an Upper Division
student. In 1900 she graduated with
an A.B. degree as a German major,
thus furthering her education, which
had been cut short at the University
of Indiana when she left after her
sophomore year to marry Dr. Cub
berley, then the recently appointed
president of Vincennes University.
Dr. and Mrs. Cubberley remained
at Vincennes three years before they
were transferred to San Diego,
where Dr. Cubberley had been made
superintendent of schools. In 1898,
Dr. David Starr Jordan invited Dr.
Cubberley to take over Stanford's
failing education department, then
with only 38 enrolled students, and
sorely in need of reorganization.
NOTED FOR HOSPITALS
During her early years at Stanford
Mrs. Cubberley proved an able
helpmate to her husband in his ex
pansion of the education. Their
house on San Juan Hill, built in
1908, became famous for the hospi
tality and spirit of understanding

that could always be found there. j
Always interested in women's ac- !
tivities, Mrs. Cubberley did much to i
help the Women's Clubhouse during j
that organization's drive to put the j
clubhouse "over" on the campus, i
She was its secretary from 1916 to |
1933.
"Ever since I first attended or |
lived at any university I have felt i
sorry for the married women on j
campus. Those women married to j
students could never seem to hope j
to enter into campus activities
wholly. They weren't exactly stu- |
dents nor were they faculty; they J
were the in-betweens." she believes, i
FOUNDS STANFORD DAMES
Here then, Mrs. Cubberley turned j
out to be the guiding light for the J
organzation of the Stanford Dames, j
Farm chapter of the national so- j
ciety of married women students.
She was elected honorary mem- }
ber to Phi Beta Kappa in 1905, to ,
Cap and Gown in 1922, and in 192G |
to Pi Lambda Theta, national worn- ,
en's honorary education society !
whose Stanford chapter she helped !
organize.
