# Engineers Make Tests Of Libe Site
## Seismic Equipment To Record Earth's Vibration Character 
### 
Supplementing the foundation
tests recently made' by Captain
R. V. La√üarre of Los Angeles, con
sulting engineer, a shaking machine
and delicate seismic instruments
were lowered yesterday into en
larged pits at the Stanford campus
site of the Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace. These in
struments will record the vibration
characteristics of the foundation
earth that is to support the library's
210-foot tower.
The Seismological division of the
United States Coast and Geodetic
Survey is conducting these test. l ; un
der the direction of Franklin P. Ul
rieh. Recordings are to be analyzed
by Professor Lydik S. Jacobsen,
head of the Stanford vibration lab
oratory, with a view to advancing
engineering knowledge of the be
havior of building foundations dur
ing earthquakes.
EXPERIMENTS PLANNED
The shaking machine, which is
able to exert forces up to 7000
pounds against the walls of a pit,
will be placed in operation at the
depth of 11 feet below the surface
of the ground where it will set up
ground vibrations that will be re
corded by seismic instruments placed
in pits 25 yards away.
"Vibration characteristics of the
ground," explained Professor Jacob
sen, "will depend upon the local ge
ology. When the library has been
completely constructed, it will alter
the natural vibration period of the
foundation. Interconnection be
tween the ground's vibration period
and that of the building is not well
understood, and we are therefore in
terested in accumulating data for
future study."
LIKE BOWL OF JELLY
"It is as though a bowl of jelly
were shaken," Professor Jacobsen
continued. "That would be compa
rable with the shaking of the
ground. But place some object on
top of that jelly in the bowl, and
the jelly's vibration period naturally
changes. That would be comparable
to the effect of a building on the
vibration of the ground beneath."
For seven years Professor Jacob
sen has been a dollar-a-year con
sultant to the Coast and Geodetic
Survey. His original design for a
shaking machine has been the basic
pattern for models used by the Sur
vey's seismological division in mak
ing vibration records of more than
300 large buildings in San Francisco,
San Jose, Los Angeles and Long
Beach.
In addition, the machine has
been utilized in testing the vibration
periods of Searsville Dam, near
Stanford, of the Morris Dam near
Pasadena, and the Hoover Dam.
