### 

KENTUCKY'S FAME!) HARLAN COUNTY took on the appearance
of an armed camp last week when national guardsmen, ordered out by
Governor A. B. "Happy" Chandler, patrolled six coal mines whose
operators refused to sign union agreements. In top picture, pistol am
munition is being issued, while lower photo shows a trooper guarding
a bridge at one of the mines. Machine guns and tanks were moved
into the area to prevent violence.
