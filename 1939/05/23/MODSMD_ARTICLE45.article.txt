## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Mural Kickers Compete Here This Afternoon Manager Stojkovich Announces Swimming Meet for Thursday 
### 
Open to anyone registered in the
University, the annual intramural
drop-kicking contest will be held
today on the freshman practice field.
Last year's winner, Glenn Hamil
ton, is expected to be on hand to
protect the title he won last year
with his accurate toe.
Skill of the competitors is tested
by tallying the number of kicks
they put through the crossbars at
several chosen spots, 10-, 20-, 30-,
and 40-yard lines. And the winner
will receive the George Brooke tro
phy, awarded annually for accuracy
in drop kicking.
The intramural contest will fol
low the Australian football tele
graphic meet to be held among the
members of the football squad this
afternoon.
A date for the big intramural
swimming meet has been definitely
set by Intramural Manager Andrew
Lewis Stojkovich. The trials will be
this coming Thursday, May 25, and
the finals on Friday. So far 28
teams have entered and plenty of
action is promised.
And the intramural tennis tourna
ment is fast drawing to a close. The
Delt II netters reached the semi
finals by defeating Phi Sig, 2-1,
while Zete and the Delt I teams also
reached this charmed circle by
turning back Delta Chi and D.U.,
respectively, by scores of 2-0. The
fourth and only remaining place
in the semi-finals will be the win
ner of the Kappa Alpha vs. Phi
Psi match.
