roor old Slants took a tdrrific
beating in Seattle Saturday because |
the author got a bum steer on a
couple of races.
In the first place, Lee Orr, the best ]
220 man in this country—that i.s,'
next to Clyde Jeffrey—failed to run ;
again, and thereby put a slight i
i squitch in our system guessing con- |
test. Then Louis Zamperini got a |
mere third in the 880-yard run be- j
i cause he forgot to reckon with a j
couple of fleetfoots from Oregon j
and Washington State.
>{« * *
OUR OUESSES missed all day.
Russ Wulff was shut out in the high
j jump, Herb Michael's record
i breaking shot, put left Stan Ander
i sen and Bill Wohle in the lurch, i
and so on.
Our prediction of seven broken
records, however, fell only one
[ short and that was the 220-yard
mark which Clyde Jeftrey tied in a '
lope.
Dick Carew deserves a break for '
winning two fifths in exceedingly j
fast fields while Mushy Girard must J
have poured it on the great Zamp j
j in terrific fashion to take that sec- j
i ond in the mile run. Maybe Girard j
, had something to do with Zampe
rini's failure in the SBO. But there's
' only one Superman, and he's just a
j character in the tunny papers.

A REALLY interesting afternoon j
| of football finesse is on tap this!
I afternoon on the freshman field
i some time after 3 o'clock. The Stan- !
! ford grid .squad is competing tele- j
I graphically with a team from the;
Carleton Club of Australia. Tiny's '
best will kick and pass both the |
American and Australian type balls 1
i for distance records.
We always wondered just how far j
j a guy like Tony Calvelli could j
| really throw a football when he
i didn't have a mob of linemen around |
his neck. He was definitely a bet

ter center than he was a back field
ace, but he did win a couple ol
sparkling victories with that big
l ight hand of his.
Remember the 51-yard beauty he
tossed over the mob up in Oregon
in '37 tor a touchdown and an In
dian triumph, with only a couple ol
minutes remaining?

EDSON BURROWS, the Stanford
distance ace who managed to mix
newspaper work and distance run
ning w'ith amazing success, is hang
ing around the Farm these days
with a thought on his mind. Bur
rows, in case you don't remember
him, won the mile and two-mile
championships in last year's Coast
meet. Zamperini, incidentally, broke
his mile record Saturday in Seattle,
Burrows' home town, the dog!
Well, Burrows luis always been
pretty shy in hi.s actions; yet he
feels he can concentrate on the two
mile alone and run 9:10 before the
Olympic trials.
He hasn't made his mind up doli
nitely yet but the idea sounds good.

In the first place, Lee Orr, the best ]
220 man in this country—that i.s,'
next to Clyde Jeffrey—failed to run ;
again, and thereby put a slight i
i squitch in our system guessing con- |

mere third in the 880-yard run be- j
i cause he forgot to reckon with a j
couple of fleetfoots from Oregon j

OUR OUESSES missed all day.
Russ Wulff was shut out in the high
j jump, Herb Michael's record
i breaking shot, put left Stan Ander
i sen and Bill Wohle in the lurch, i
and so on.
Our prediction of seven broken
records, however, fell only one
[ short and that was the 220-yard
mark which Clyde Jeftrey tied in a '
lope.
Dick Carew deserves a break for '
winning two fifths in exceedingly j
fast fields while Mushy Girard must J
have poured it on the great Zamp j
j in terrific fashion to take that sec- j
i ond in the mile run. Maybe Girard j
, had something to do with Zampe
rini's failure in the SBO. But there's
' only one Superman, and he's just a

A REALLY interesting afternoon j
| of football finesse is on tap this!
I afternoon on the freshman field
i some time after 3 o'clock. The Stan- !
! ford grid .squad is competing tele- j
I graphically with a team from the;
Carleton Club of Australia. Tiny's '
best will kick and pass both the |
American and Australian type balls 1
i for distance records.
We always wondered just how far j
j a guy like Tony Calvelli could j
| really throw a football when he
i didn't have a mob of linemen around |
his neck. He was definitely a bet

ter center than he was a back field
ace, but he did win a couple ol
sparkling victories with that big
l ight hand of his.
Remember the 51-yard beauty he
tossed over the mob up in Oregon
in '37 tor a touchdown and an In
dian triumph, with only a couple ol
minutes remaining?

EDSON BURROWS, the Stanford
distance ace who managed to mix
newspaper work and distance run
ning w'ith amazing success, is hang
ing around the Farm these days
with a thought on his mind. Bur
rows, in case you don't remember
him, won the mile and two-mile
championships in last year's Coast
meet. Zamperini, incidentally, broke
his mile record Saturday in Seattle,
Burrows' home town, the dog!
Well, Burrows luis always been
pretty shy in hi.s actions; yet he
feels he can concentrate on the two
mile alone and run 9:10 before the
Olympic trials.
He hasn't made his mind up doli
nitely yet but the idea sounds good.
