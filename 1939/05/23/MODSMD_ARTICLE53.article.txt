# The 						Winds of Rumor

WITH most of the campus looking askance
at the recent investigation and suggested
revisions of the social regulations for the
A.S.S.U., it appears that three off-campus events
have been put on the spot.
The sophomore class picnic to be held Sat
urday and the junior class picnic held last Sat
urday, and a possible senior affair, are, in a
sense, test cases.
Chairmen of the three functions are to hand
in reports to the dean of men's office as to their
estimation of the event which they planned, the
advisability of continuing such events in the
future.
It seems almost apparent that what is hoped
for is a report showing the inadvisability of
such continuance.
The revision suggested for the A.S.S.U. social
regulations was mild. It hit primarily all-night
dances and fixed a set procedure for clearing
and granting of dates for functions.
It hinted, however, of further encroachments
to come.
The reports of the picnic chairmen hint even
more strongly.
All this year, from the Majorette on, Stanford
has seen a stricter and stricter policy in regard
to social functions being formed by rulings
which will serve as precedents for decisions on
social functions of the future.
Time after time, disgruntled class officers and
committee chairmen have reported a mysterious
clamping down on their ideas for both campus
and off-campus events. Most notable was the
movie queen idea for the Masque Ball.
Most of these stories have been traceable only
to circumstancial sources and evidence. But
they have been uniform in one respect. Most
of them have been substantiated by more than
one person concerned; most of them have
pointed to a definite trend that leads ultimately
to suppression of many of Stanford's customary
social activities.
Nobody has said so definitely—in fact every
body has stumbled over everybody else in mak
ing denials.
Yet every once in a while something filters
through.
And it is a fact that there has been opposition
to many of the social events that students have
planned.
For example, take off-campus dances.
Why shouldn't there be off-campus dances?
Why shouldn't Stanford invite a respectable
movie star to be its guest at a dance? Why
shouldn't the Senior Class be able to have a
floor show at the Prom?
There's nothing harmful in any one of those
ideas—yet each one has been dinged. Dinged
not cleanly and in a clear-cut manner — but
smothered.
And that's what is happening to social life
at Stanford—its class picnics, its dances, its
fraternity and sorority functions—it is being
smothered by vague generalizations which re
fuse to meet squarely the argument of "What's
wrong with these ideas?"
Surely, if Stanford's students are mature and
intelligent enough to run their own government,
they are mature and intelligent enough to run
their own social affairs.
The only major conclusion possible at this
particular time is that chairmen of the sopho
more, junior, and senior affairs are on the spot.
But so is Stanford's social life. Pretty soon
it looks as though it will be underneath that
spot.
