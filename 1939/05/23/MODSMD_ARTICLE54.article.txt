# Two Men on a Ballot
## 
### 
BY this time tomorrow there will be a new
Editor of The Daily for Volume 96.
Sunday night, the two associates who today
are running for that editorship walked out of
the Shack. Both of them left behind the work
of three years.
To the campus, perhaps those three years of
work on The Daily have not been apparent. But
to the members of the Daily staff, that work has '
meant enough confidence to place those men
in the position where one of the two will next
fall be this newspaper's Editor.
Both are as near masters in their own lines as !
any Stanford journalists ever have been. Both
are thoroughly familiar with Stanford—its spirit ,
and its life.

What's more, both have definite ideas on
Stanford—its spirit and its life.
As the staff today makes its decision between
the two, it will do well to remember not only
those ideas and what they are, the personalities
involved, the past record of each, but to weigh
carefully the reactions which each may have
as the sequence of events is picked up again
next year.
Tonight, the retiring members of edit board
of Volume 95, including the defeated asso
ciate, will feel more than a little wistful as those
of The Daily who are to remain staff members
celebrate their appointments to higher positions.
That feeling will be the one of those who
are side-tracked, only to watch others go on.
But now, before elections, before new staff
appointments, to both of the associates, to Larry,
to Dud:
"Good luck!"
