# BULL SESSION

### HENRY MADDEN 
Instructor, History of Western Civilization
STUDENTS AND FACULTY
/ iNE of the rising lights on The Daily asked me to
conduct a session, blithely ignoring the fact that
attempting to fill in the stead of such distinguished
sessioners as John Cobbs, Abe Mellinkoff, and others
stretching back to remoter times, is no mean task. And
he made the assignment more difficult by giving me
free rein. Despite the apparent airiness of seasoned
columnists, flitting from subject to subject, untouched
by the shadow of editorial control, I am convinced
that the average columnist appreciates a hint as to
what the reader wants. However, in the absence of
such direction, perhaps no safer subject could be found
than the hoary matter of student-faculty relationships.
In the February issue of the "American Mercury"
that veteran iconoclast, Albert Jack Nock (no puns,
please!) runs a skeleton out of the academic closet in
an article entitled "College Is No Place to Get an
Education." The burden of Nock's squib is that the
crux of Mark Hopkins' famous saying, "The best uni
versity in the world is a log with a student on one
end and a teacher on the other" is being lost sight
of; instead of concentrating on the student and the
teacher, the educational system is going in for for
estry with jubilant enthusiasm. The modest pine plank
has been replaced by the tubular magnificence of a
redwood trunk, and where soft converse was once the
rule, now semaphore and heliograph signals flash arbi
trarily between the remote parties.
Lost in the burgeoning growth of academic timber,
the student may plaintively wonder why the process
of getting an education has become so impersonal. By
way of answer, he hears that professors are engaged
in an esoteric process known as research, which re
leases them only at stated periods to face an assembly
of students. The ringing of the bell, so goes this rea
soning, releases not only the students but also the
instructor, who returns, like a sun-dazzled mole, to
the labyrinth of research.

TYTOW this line of reasoning has been distorted until
it serves the student as an excuse to shun the
relationship which would normally develop. First of
all, the research labyrinth is grossly exaggerated;
should the student attempt, to brave it, he would not
find his instructor a Minotaur, champing at the pros
pect of annihilating the unwary innocent. Secondly,
leaving aside considerations of this overdone subject,
it is apparent that, the teacher-student-log relationship
cannot be cemented by occasional Roman holidays like
the well-intentioned Student-Faculty Get-Together. It
must rest on a firmer foundation than a three-legged
race and a picnic supper.
Where is the golden mean in the student-faculty
relationship? It lies somewhere between the extremes
of non-intercourse and boisterous familiarity. No Stan
ford student of a decade ago had finished his pasturage
on the Farm until he had sat at the feet of David Starr
Jordan and listened to the reminiscences of a gentle
and serene mind, but to slap his back and call him
"Dave" would not have made that student a better or
a wiser man.
Dr. Jordan has been gone for eight years, but the
Farm is the same. Its motto is the sameâ€”Die Luft der
Freiheit weht. Before that gentle breeze students and
faculty should follow paths which run parallel and
often intertwine.
