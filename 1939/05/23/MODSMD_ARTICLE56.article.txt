For the past week people have been telling me I
have my picture on the front of the Quad.
Of course I have.
It cost me $10.
That's one story. The other is that my friend Burtt
and I were just standing there one Winter Quarter
Saturday afternoon, and a few girls were herded up
onto the steps by a couple of Quad photographers.
Let's cet the hell out. Burtt said to me.
No, the photographer said, you'll make a good
background.
>Jt «l* *
if by background you mean the object
farthest back, the blonde on the top steps was the
background in that picture.
It's one of the few times in history that the back
ground of the picture lias ever been the foreground.
When you look at the picture, the first thing you
see is the blonde.
When I went over to see Frank Lippman the Mon
day after the picture was taken to pay my $10, I took
a look at the picture.
Gee, Frank, I said. This picture is costing me a
lot. of money. I think I was pretty decent about giving
up a Saturday afternoon to have it. taken. Can't you
do something about my shoes?
What's the matter with them?
Look.
Hmmm. Not so good. You'll have to take that up
with the business manager.
I went to see Margaret. Hmmm. she said. You'll
have to take that up with the photographer.
Hmmm, the photographer said. * Maybe the janitor
can help.
*** * .
Hmmm. the janitor said. Just my size. Sure. I
can shine 'em up fine.
I gave him my shoes, and then I waited until
the Quad came out yesterday. He shincd them up
fine, all right.
