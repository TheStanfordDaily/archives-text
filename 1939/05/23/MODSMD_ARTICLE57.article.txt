# Don't See the Exposition At a Dog-Trot: Stroll
## 
### 
You can see the Fair in 12 hours, if you want to— hut we advise against
the plan.
We tried it.
If you want to trot from building to building, from court to court, from
exhibit to exhibit, you're welcome to.
But there are too many good things at the Exposition to scrape the
surface in such a desultory way. Take your time. Relax. Stroll like a
Continental,
Let's put first things first, like the old platitude. Move down Pacific
Promenade past the floral crescent until you come to the Palace of Fine

and Decorative Arts. Pay the mant
at the door your quarter and spend J
a good many hours wandering '
through the miles of galleries that
house $20,000,000 worth of the finest
art objects in the world. You've
heard all about the collection—Bot
ticelli's "Birth of Venus," Raphael's
"Madonna of the Chair," Titian, Tin
toretto, Donatello, van Orley, Hals.
Every great period is represented,
from Renaissance sculpture, Gothic
tapestry, to Renoir, Courbet, Manet,
Pissaro. If, like us, you admire Van
Gogh, there's a whole room full to
see.
When you're tired of looking at
the classics and moderns of Europe, ,
you can turn to the exhibit of Pacific ;
arts. In case after case you may look
at Ming China and beaten Inca gold, 1
idols from Polynesia, fragile Japa- !
nese screens. "It's the best collection j
of Pacific art ever made," the direc- J
tor told us. "Twenty-four museums j
and governments have sent the finest \
of their art treasures." You'll never j
see a more complete representation i
of the, masterpieces of Western cul- |
ture.
When the humanities begin to pall, |
take a glance at the science building, j
Let Phil Klauber pull mechanical I
rabbits out of mysterious hats at the i
House of Magic. Blink at the strobo- |
scope and wonder at the Voder. |
Take a crack at those free tele- j
phone calls and, when you're tired '
of standing in line, relax for a while '
in the R.C.A. record salon where J
you may hear anything from Mr.
"Gobstick" Shaw to Mr. "Hands" i
Stokowski.
SEE THE CAVALCADE
It's just about time for the Caval
cade of the Golden West. Buy some I
peanuts and sit in the back. (It's 1
windy in front.) Though it may take |
you a while to get in the spirit of 1
the colossus, you'll soon be wanting !
to help Governor Stanford pound j
that golden spike.
Maybe you'll wonder where to eat. 1
For lunch, why not try the Sand- '
wich Slide—if you like to see your J
food tobogganing toward you. For i
dinner, pick up a journalist friend
(hint) and eat at the Press Club.
The "facilities" are excellent. Or
pick up a San Francisco woman !
friend and eat at the swank Yerba !
Buena Club.
