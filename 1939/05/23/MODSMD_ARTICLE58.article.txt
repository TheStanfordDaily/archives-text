But, of course, things are just be
ginning to get interesting now. Fluo
rescent lighting is pulling that cloak
of glamor-glow around familiar
things. The Tower of the Sun is
blossoming in blue and orange. And
the fountains bubble a colored
dampness. Treasure Island becomes
a vaguely unreal place.
When you get bored with pro
gressively "instructive" things, and
want pleasure with relaxation, don't
head for a sex show. Drift down the
Avenue of Olives and walk into the
surpiise of the Exposition. It's the
El Salvador Pavilion. With a free
cup of coffee in hand, you'll hear
music you've never heard before by
a ten-piece native marimba band.
When they stop playing at 10 o'clock,
there's still time for the Gayway—
if you're in a hilarious mood.—
