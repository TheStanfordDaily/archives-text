## 
### 
To accommodate the annual over- j
llow of friends and relatives who |
come to Stanford to witness grad- 1
uation ceremonies, arrangements i
are now being made by Miss Anas
tasia Doyle and Mr. Bertram A.:
Gage, respective directors of worn- J
en's and men's dormitories, to j
house these visitors in campus resi
dence units during the Senior Week
festivities.
As seniors who have tried to re
serve rooms for visitors in Palo Alto
recently, well know, it is quite im- |
possible to find accommodations now j
and has been for quite some time, i
Commenting on the developing solu
tion, Dr. Wilbur remarked that he
didn't see why it wasn't thought of
long ago.
The rooms made available to visi
tors will be arranged as much in
hotel fashion as possible and any fee j
charged will be nominal, according
to announcement made last night by
Harry Horton.
The first units to be opened for
such purposes will probably be
Lagunita and Toyon and others
will be opened as they are needed. I
Arrangements are not yet definite
enough to call for reservations from
the students, but Mr. Gage and I
Miss Doyle are laboring toward final
draft of plans.
