# History ... 1939
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
in every world a
k group of men is considering it
self the hub of the universe. Ex
Committee is meeting, Leadership
Institute is feeling self-consciously
responsible, and the Daily staff is
celebrating down the highway.
These things are inconsequential.
How can they be considered im
portant when 59 sailors are trapped
in a U. S. navy submarine 240 feet
deep in the Atlantic off the coast of
New Hampshire? Even these do not
matter, the 59 who may soon be
grabbing for food and gasping for
air, when the fate of the civilized
world is being decided somewhere
else.

It is neither in the sunken sub,
"Squalus," nor the private spheres
of Stanford men that the fate of us,
who are alive in 1939, is being
graved. A century from now his
torians will ignore these bagatelles
and concentrate on the fact that on
May 24 the solidification of the
Russo-Anglo-French pact took place
Because France, her strongest ally,
and Turkey, her newest, are de
pendent on Britain joining the
Soviet, Neville Chamberlain is
agreeing to the alliance. Premier
Dnladier has already staked his lot
with the Red Army, and Turkey
holds the key to the Russian ports
on the Black Sea in her control of
the Dardanelles.

VSTTTH Foreign Secretary Viscount
Halifax conferring with Foreign
Commissar Ivan Maisky in Geneva,
and Poland and Rumania approving
all the way, London certainly will
raise no objections to an alliance
with Moscow, regardless of com
munism, capitalism, or any other
political theory.
The fact that, the German-Italian
league is capable of a military vic
tory is perfectly apparent to the
democratic allies. Backed by the
colossal power of the Red Army,
they have nothing to fear. So they
are turning yes-men, bowing low
before Soviet demands for a mutual
aggression pact in order to present a
stiff upper lip to Mussolini and
Hitler.

While England and Russia shuf
fled the cards in one committee
room of the League of Nations Pal
ace, in another the League lent its
support ot Polish i-esistance to Ger
man designs on Danzig. By order
ing the return of neutral Director
Dr. Karl Burckhardt to his post, va
cated because of opposition by the
Nazi Senate of the Free City, the
international body established defi
nite opposition to the Reich's ab
sorbing the Baltic port.
At present, the only practical so
lution to the problem appears to be
a joint German-Polish protectorate,
but in the light of recent interna
tional friction, it is obvious that
there will not be smooth skiing all
the way down hill.
