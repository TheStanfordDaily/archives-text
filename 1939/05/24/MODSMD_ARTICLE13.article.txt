# Excom Blocks Approval Of '40 Quad Appointments
## 
### 
Ex Committee last night thumbed through the A.S.S.U. handbook,
found its constitutional prerogative, and refused to approve Quad staff
appointments, on the grounds of affiliation hierarchy.
The staff for the 1940 yearbook, which was named yesterday, was ap
proved by Publications Council, and then passed on to Ex Committee for
final okay.
The governing body, however, fearing that "a certain house" was gain
ing control "beyond a coincidental stage," sent the appointments back to

Publications Council for further in-#
vestigation.
Frank Lippman, outgoing editor
of the Quad, attended the meeting I
to answer questions and present rea- ,
spns for ihe various staff choices. j
Main arguments against acceptance I
of the appointments were presented j
by Andy Stojkovich and Jim Bar
njum, who felt that "the certain j
hj<>use" not only was building a j
hierarchy on the Quad staff, but that
the same house was, in addition, '
going so far as to train men to cany j
on that hierarchy. I
"You can't tell me you raise a j
certain brand of guy in the |a cer- i
tain | house," Tom Killefer added.
As it stands now, the 1940 Quad
is an illegitimate book, without a
staff, since the appointments have j
been sent back to Publications Coun
cil, which can approve the staff— j
but subject to Ex Committee okay, j
This double approval follows selec- j
tion by the outgoing editor and j
manager.

committee of four to investigate |
Cjardinals and Rally Committee sug
gestions for members for next year's j

belle Clark.
The committee will name final j
choices for the seven Cardinal po- j
sitions and the 37 Rally Committee '
openings from the master list pre- j
sented to Ex Committee by out- J
going Cardinals headman Roy j
Thompson.

found its constitutional prerogative, and refused to approve Quad staff
appointments, on the grounds of affiliation hierarchy.
The staff for the 1940 yearbook, which was named yesterday, was ap
proved by Publications Council, and then passed on to Ex Committee for
final okay.
The governing body, however, fearing that "a certain house" was gain
ing control "beyond a coincidental stage," sent the appointments back to

Publications Council for further in-#
vestigation.
Frank Lippman, outgoing editor
of the Quad, attended the meeting I
to answer questions and present rea- ,
spns for ihe various staff choices. j
Main arguments against acceptance I
of the appointments were presented j
by Andy Stojkovich and Jim Bar
njum, who felt that "the certain j
hj<>use" not only was building a j
hierarchy on the Quad staff, but that
the same house was, in addition, '
going so far as to train men to cany j
on that hierarchy. I
"You can't tell me you raise a j
certain brand of guy in the |a cer- i
tain | house," Tom Killefer added.
As it stands now, the 1940 Quad
is an illegitimate book, without a
staff, since the appointments have j
been sent back to Publications Coun
cil, which can approve the staff— j
but subject to Ex Committee okay, j
This double approval follows selec- j
tion by the outgoing editor and j
manager.
