## Commander Reports All Aboard Alive

PORTSMOUTH, N.M.. M;iy 23
(UP). â€”Sixty-two of the American
Navy's undersea dogs sat calmly on
the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean
tonight, trapped in the submarine
"Squalus," the navy's newest, sub
mersible, which plunged to the bot
tom today in 240 feet of water near
the isles of shoals.
The U. S. Navy put into operation
all its facilities for the rescue of
submersible craft and anticipated
all the men would be saved and the
submarine raised without further
mishap.
Rescue vessels, equipped with
modern salvage equipment devel
oped since the S-4 disaster of 12
years ago, sped to Portsmouth under
forced draft from Brooklyn, Boston
and New London. Rescue ships
from the Portsmouth naval base
clustered over the sunken vessel.
Most of the special salvage equip
ment was expected to arrive at mid
morning but diving apparatus and
rescue gear available here was be
ing assembled tonight under direc
tion of Lieut. Comdr. C. B. 'Monsen,
inventor of the Monsen lung by
which submarine-trapped men may
rise to the surface.
Monsen, who flew here from
Washington, said "real diving opera
tions will not begin until 6 a.m. to
morrow." He was accompanied by
Lieut.. Comdr. B. H. Behnke, a phy
sician specializing in the treatment
of deep sea divers.
There are four escape hatches on
top of the submersible, but three of
these are in the flooded portion, leav
ing only one available for rescue
work.
Oxygen tanks and enough food
and water for several days are in
the unflooded sections of the ship.
In his brief conversation with Ad
miral Cole, interrupted by the
breaking of the telephone line, Na
quin reported there was no confu
sion aboard the submarine and no
alarm. Everyone was "quite com
fortable," he said, and the men ex
pected to be rescued shortly.
