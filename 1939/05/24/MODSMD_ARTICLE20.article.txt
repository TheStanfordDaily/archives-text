# Campus Heads Review Student Organization
## Cuthbertson, Cook, Hinrichs Lead Final Institute Discussion 
### 
Bringing last week's broad discus
sion of the philosophy of student
government down to a consideration
of the more general problems of the
student committee, Leadership In
stitute listened last night to talks by
Lyle Cook, Pulzie Hinrichs, and
Ken Cuthbertson.
Cook, who spoke first, told of the
projected Activities Co - ordination
Committee and under what circum
stances its work would benefit the
student body to the greatest extent.
This system in practice, Cook be
lieves, will broaden knowledge of
student government, put officers in
positions in which they are most
interested, promote wider interest in
student government and greater ef
ficiency therein.
CARD INDEX
Under the activities co-ordination
plan, card indexes of all students
desiring to sign up would be kept.
From the cards, committee chair
men would judge eligibility and
fitness for certain types of work.
After each committee job had been
done, the chairman would put his
rating of the student on the card.
Second speaker, Ken Cuthbertson,
president-elect of the student body,
discussed problems which face a
committee chairman. Prime disad
vantage in the present committee
system, according to Cuthbertson,
is the '••stigma" which is attached to
work on the small groups. OTO many
students are liable to make them
selves available for committee work
for the glory and publicity con
nected with it.
SUB-COMMITTEES
Cuthbertson then took up the re
lations of the chairman with his
committee members, stating that it
was h.s belief that the head man
should not have to take the respon
sibility for the work of the members
of his group, but should make each
man responsible for his own job.
Cuthbertson also discussed the place
of sub-committees in the campus
political scheme.
To cover the continuity angle of
committee work, Putzie Hinrichs
spoke at considerable length on ihe
advisability of leaving complete re
ports for later committees. Describ
ing a vocal report as being the most
advantageous, the former head of
Roble sponsors stated that she felt
that the written report, complete in
detail, could approach the benefits
of the confab. She cited Lyle Cook's
report on Pre-Reg as one of the
best ever filed. In line with his idea
of leaving samples of programs,
maps of guide tounr, and identifi
cation, she suggested that a scrap
book with full coverage of such
minor items would be more than
valuable to incoming committeemen.
The meeting was conducted by
Betty Davis, vice-president of the
student body.

for the glory and publicity con
nected with it.
SUB-COMMITTEES
Cuthbertson then took up the re
lations of the chairman with his
committee members, stating that it
was h.s belief that the head man
should not have to take the respon
sibility for the work of the members
of his group, but should make each
man responsible for his own job.
Cuthbertson also discussed the place
of sub-committees in the campus
political scheme.
To cover the continuity angle of
committee work, Putzie Hinrichs
spoke at considerable length on ihe
advisability of leaving complete re
ports for later committees. Describ
ing a vocal report as being the most
advantageous, the former head of
Roble sponsors stated that she felt
that the written report, complete in
detail, could approach the benefits
of the confab. She cited Lyle Cook's
report on Pre-Reg as one of the
best ever filed. In line with his idea
of leaving samples of programs,
maps of guide tounr, and identifi
cation, she suggested that a scrap
book with full coverage of such
minor items would be more than
valuable to incoming committeemen.
The meeting was conducted by
Betty Davis, vice-president of the
student body.
Bringing last week's broad discus
sion of the philosophy of student
government down to a consideration
of the more general problems of the
student committee, Leadership In
stitute listened last night to talks by
Lyle Cook, Pulzie Hinrichs, and
Ken Cuthbertson.
Cook, who spoke first, told of the
projected Activities Co - ordination
Committee and under what circum
stances its work would benefit the
student body to the greatest extent.
This system in practice, Cook be
lieves, will broaden knowledge of
student government, put officers in
positions in which they are most
interested, promote wider interest in
student government and greater ef
ficiency therein.
CARD INDEX
Under the activities co-ordination
plan, card indexes of all students
desiring to sign up would be kept.
From the cards, committee chair
men would judge eligibility and
fitness for certain types of work.
After each committee job had been
done, the chairman would put his
rating of the student on the card.
Second speaker, Ken Cuthbertson,
president-elect of the student body,
discussed problems which face a
committee chairman. Prime disad
vantage in the present committee
system, according to Cuthbertson,
is the '••stigma" which is attached to
work on the small groups. OTO many
students are liable to make them
selves available for committee work
for the glory and publicity con
nected with it.
