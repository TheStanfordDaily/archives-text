# 'Wake Up' May Be Last Spring Show
## Cahn Finds Faculty View Discouraging Academic Difficulties Of Show Workers Bring Criticism 
### 
That "Wake Up and Leave" may
be the last Spring Show to lie pro
duced became a possibility last night
when Ram's Head President J. P.
Calm said that "administration in
difference may make it very difficult,
to continue the Spring Show next
year."
President Calm said he felt Uni
versity authorities were regarding
student dramatic work without in
terest, although, from his point of
view, he believed such activity
could do as much for amateur the
ater workers as other productions,
since responsibility as well as tech
nical training could be given.
In addition, he pointed out, stu
dent productions were tangible evi
dences of active undergraduate the
atrical work which would be viewed
favorably by alumni and friends of
the university.
Without interest from the admin-

istration as well as from students
and outsiders, he felt that Ram's
Head work could proceed only with
great difficulty.
"Ram's Head has made every ef
fort to co-operate with the admin
istration in scholarship and in pro
tection of Memorial Hall," he said-
He explained that the organization
has set up a ruling that production
workers must, have a C average in
the Bawlout, or go plus the quarter
before producton, in order to work
on any show.
"We don't want the people who
are not doing their academic work,"
he said. "We can find plenty of oth
ers who are up in their studies to
work on shows without taking in
those who will blame dramatics for
going minus."
BEHIND ADMINISTRATION
"It's up to the people themselves
to decide whether they can handle
both dramatic and scholastic work.
They are perfectly free to come
firmly behind academic restrictions
which will keep such people out of
our productions. But if they aren't
gi*own up enough to balance dra
matic and scholastic work in spite
of all we can do, it is their fault, and
not that of Ram's Head as a whole."
Dean Mary Yost, speaking on the
question of scholarship standing
among Ram's Head members, said
that "there has been a great deal of
faculty criticism of Ram's Head be
cause some of those working in stu
dent productions have gotten into
academic difficulty."
She stated emphatically, however,
that there was no suggestion from
the administration that. Ram's Head
work bo forcibly curtailed, but, six
said, "Ram's Head itself may find
it advisable, in view of the crowded
spring quarter, to give up the
Spring Show."
She made clear that she and other
administration officials were inter
ested in student, dramatics and wish
ed to encourage them. "We don't
like to see Ram's Head being criti
cized when it can possibly be avoid
ed." she said.

Commenting upon the Ram's Head
ruling for scholarship requirements,
she said that difficulty had arisen
