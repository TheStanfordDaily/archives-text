## Bryan Makes Final Plans for Saturday Trip to Santa Cruz 
### 
A fleet of Greyhound busses will
carry fun-seeking sophomores to an
all-day picnic at Santa Cruz on
Saturday—if a sufficient number of
people signify that they're going, in
the A.S.S.U. office today, according
ot Greyson Bryan, picnic chairman.
"Whether or not we'll have the
get-together depend* on those who
sign for tickets—not buy them but
just sign up—in the A.S.S.U. office
by this afternoon," Bryan added.
Emphasizing the need of rounding
plans into shape before the day
long gathering, Bryan urged sopho
mores to "register now and attend
Saturday." The busses must be
chartered and food must be pur
chased, he said. Assisting Bryan are
Bob Low, transportation; Bob Beck
barn, food; and Dwight Hutchinson,
publicity.
TICKETS 50 CENTS
Tickets, which will be retailed by
living group representatives during
the remainder of the week, will sell
for 50 cents, it was disclosed. "Ob
viously this price doesn't cover all
the expenses," Bryan said. "But the
remaining $1 needed to meet costs
will be paid by the class. All it will
cost you is the one ticket at 50 cents
—on the line," he pleaded.
Busses transporting the group will
leave from the library parking lot
at 9:30 o'clock. No private cars will
be allowed. Swimming, basketball,
beach sports, and the amusement
zone at Santa Cruz will occupy
sophomores until late in the after
noon, when busses will bring sec
ond-year men and women back to
the Farm in time for Saturday night
dates. "By the way," Bryan con
tinued, "the picnic will be a strictly
no-date affair."
Bryan yesterday listed living
group sales chiefs who will aid in
retailing tickets.

A fleet of Greyhound busses will
carry fun-seeking sophomores to an
all-day picnic at Santa Cruz on
Saturday—if a sufficient number of
people signify that they're going, in
the A.S.S.U. office today, according
ot Greyson Bryan, picnic chairman.
"Whether or not we'll have the
get-together depend* on those who
sign for tickets—not buy them but
just sign up—in the A.S.S.U. office
by this afternoon," Bryan added.
Emphasizing the need of rounding
plans into shape before the day
long gathering, Bryan urged sopho
mores to "register now and attend
Saturday." The busses must be
chartered and food must be pur
chased, he said. Assisting Bryan are
Bob Low, transportation; Bob Beck
barn, food; and Dwight Hutchinson,
publicity.
TICKETS 50 CENTS
Tickets, which will be retailed by
living group representatives during
the remainder of the week, will sell
for 50 cents, it was disclosed. "Ob
viously this price doesn't cover all
the expenses," Bryan said. "But the
remaining $1 needed to meet costs
will be paid by the class. All it will
cost you is the one ticket at 50 cents
—on the line," he pleaded.
Busses transporting the group will
leave from the library parking lot
at 9:30 o'clock. No private cars will
be allowed. Swimming, basketball,
beach sports, and the amusement
zone at Santa Cruz will occupy
sophomores until late in the after
noon, when busses will bring sec
ond-year men and women back to
the Farm in time for Saturday night
dates. "By the way," Bryan con
tinued, "the picnic will be a strictly
no-date affair."
Bryan yesterday listed living
group sales chiefs who will aid in
retailing tickets.
