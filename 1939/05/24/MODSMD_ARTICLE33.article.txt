# New Instrument Measures Building Reaction to Quakes
## 
### BUD AMES 
"This shaking model represents a wall in Long Beach during the
earthquake of 19.'M," explained Mr, Boodberg, right-hand man to vibration
expert Professor Jacohsen. "These two erratically shaped cams shake the
model in two directions at once and thus we are able to see just how a
wall will react in a certain type of earthquake."
Mr. Boodberg, who has been experimenting with earth and building
; vibrations for a little over a year now, dropped a few drops of ink on a

pen attached to the quaking model<
and then pointed to a thin line snak
ing across a sheet of paper. "That,"
he continued proudly, "is exactly the
same recording made in the 1933
earthquake.
'By alternating the tension on
these springs we are able to trans
form this model into a brick, con
crete, wooden — or any kind of a
wall. The number of vibrations that
wall makes over—let us say a sec
ond— constitutes that wall's fre
quency.' And one of those little inky
wiggles is known as the wall's 'pe
riod'."
DESTRUCTION PERIODS
Mr. Boodberg then went on to
explain that every building pos
sesses a period which, if it occurs in
an earthquake, will lead to the de
struction of that period. In general
short buildings have a short period
of about one second and taller
buildings have progressively longer
periods.
"The purpose of my study is to
find the happy medium type of wall
which will resist the majority of
vibrations that any earthquake can
produce," Mr. Boodberg stated.
"These studies are becoming increas
ingly important every year, due to
the fact that Tokyo has frequent
quakes, California has had several
and vibrations were recorded in
Helena, Montana, in 1935."
Results of Mr. Boodberg's tests are
to be forwarded to Los Angeles
County construction officials for
luture reference in the formation
and adoption of a proper and rela
tively safe building code.
MODEL EXPERIMENTS
The experimenter turned away
from his still shaking model and
pointing to a large earth-filled box
he explained, "That model is being
used for tests as to the reaction of
certain earth in the south which is
going to be utilized in dam construc
tion. In this laboratory we can jar
that earth by means of a GOO-pound
swinging pendulum and thereby de
termine exactly how that earth will 1
react under earthquake and slide !

Mr. Boodberg turned back to his !
wall model, dropped a few more '
drops of ink on the jiggling pen- 1

that afternoon he watched a little !

strip of paper.

Results of Mr. Boodberg's tests are
to be forwarded to Los Angeles
County construction officials for
luture reference in the formation
and adoption of a proper and rela
tively safe building code.
MODEL EXPERIMENTS
The experimenter turned away
from his still shaking model and
pointing to a large earth-filled box
he explained, "That model is being
used for tests as to the reaction of
certain earth in the south which is
going to be utilized in dam construc
tion. In this laboratory we can jar
that earth by means of a GOO-pound
swinging pendulum and thereby de
termine exactly how that earth will 1
react under earthquake and slide !
conditions.
Mr. Boodberg turned back to his !
wall model, dropped a few more '
drops of ink on the jiggling pen- 1
point, and then for the tenth time j
that afternoon he watched a little !
black line snake across the white '
strip of paper.
"This shaking model represents a wall in Long Beach during the
earthquake of 19.'M," explained Mr, Boodberg, right-hand man to vibration
expert Professor Jacohsen. "These two erratically shaped cams shake the
model in two directions at once and thus we are able to see just how a
wall will react in a certain type of earthquake."
Mr. Boodberg, who has been experimenting with earth and building
; vibrations for a little over a year now, dropped a few drops of ink on a

pen attached to the quaking model<
and then pointed to a thin line snak
ing across a sheet of paper. "That,"
he continued proudly, "is exactly the
same recording made in the 1933
earthquake.
'By alternating the tension on
these springs we are able to trans
form this model into a brick, con
crete, wooden — or any kind of a
wall. The number of vibrations that
wall makes over—let us say a sec
ond— constitutes that wall's fre
quency.' And one of those little inky
wiggles is known as the wall's 'pe
riod'."
DESTRUCTION PERIODS
Mr. Boodberg then went on to
explain that every building pos
sesses a period which, if it occurs in
an earthquake, will lead to the de
struction of that period. In general
short buildings have a short period
of about one second and taller
buildings have progressively longer
periods.
"The purpose of my study is to
find the happy medium type of wall
which will resist the majority of
vibrations that any earthquake can
produce," Mr. Boodberg stated.
"These studies are becoming increas
ingly important every year, due to
the fact that Tokyo has frequent
quakes, California has had several
and vibrations were recorded in
Helena, Montana, in 1935."
