## Dean Tells of Four Months' Trip Abroad 
### 
I Characterizing as "impossible" any
attempt to predict "the loyalty and
j stability of the German people until
they meet their test," Dr. Grayson N*
' Kefauver, dean of the School of Ed
; ucation who returned last week
I from a four months' trip abroad,
j spoke last night in Memorial Hall,
i in Memorial Hall auditorium.
I "The people of Germany appar
ently are willing to- struggle and
; make sacrifices to achieve the ob
| jectives they have set for them
' selves," declared the speaker, who
discussed "Social and Educational
j Observations in Europe" at a pro-
I gram of the Tuesday Evening
! Series.
That Germany is at war at the
| present time, is thÂ« opinion of Dr.
1 Kefauver, who explained that "the
use of propaganda, displays of mili
j tary might, and the support of dis
-1 turbances within the country con
stitute a form of modern warfare."
Efforts of the European dictator-
I ships to mold and influence public
i opinion and to gain support for their
act from other nations was noticed
I during his travels by the lecturer,
who explained that "there is a great
deal of very crude, as well as much
clever, propaganda in Europe to
day."
