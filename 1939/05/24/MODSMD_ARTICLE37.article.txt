Last fall, some bloke in the city— '
an alumnus or some similar specie— !
started a little* quip to the effect
that Tiny Thornhill had stated
Frankie Albert, his elusive left
handed passing ace, would not work
in the Warner system. The Warner
.system, as you probably know, with
all it.s supposed intricacies and sly
maneuverin.', still requires bis
backfield men like Ernie Nevers and
Norm Standlee for it.s main offen
sive And that means at least three
200-pound linemen in the front;
rank.
Anyhow, the alumnus or some--
thing was shut off before very long j
because few people believed that j
Thornhill would leave a man appar
ently as uncanny as Albert sitting
on the bench. Thornhill has since 1
intimated on several occasions that
Albert should go a long way in
bringing Stanford back to the foot
ball foreground. Albert has since i
justified all the nice things people i
have been saying about him by 1
mildly running wild in spring prac- I
tice.
They said last fall that Albert
was just lucky, that lie would i
never be able to dodge tacklers i
and complete over <10 per cent of
all his passes attempted when he
ran up against big and tough
varsity competition. Little Frank
ie was all through. Even the ex-

perts w ho watched him almost sin
gle-handed heat the U.S.C. and
t'al I'rosh teams were sure of it.
But Albert has started more
touchdown drives than any other
man in spring practice. His passes
are clicking almost monotonously,
though any Stanford aerial comple
tion can hardly lx> called monoto
nous; and the opposing ends and
tackles are still trying to catch him
before he flings.
Some of the other Monday morn
ing experts feel that there isn't room
lor both Pete Fay, another relatively
-Ifrtle man. and Frank Albert, a
football midget, in the same first
team. Thornhill has split them up
in spring training with Fay running
on the first string. Fay has the ex
perience and is definitely a threat
for All-American if Stanford has a
winning club.
Perhaps it would he a wise move
to have both Fay and Albert in the
first team line-up. Yet schools
with more material than our In
dians. like U.S.C. and California,
have four or five men play ing the
same position when some of them
could he playing first string in an
other spot. Having two potential
All-Americans the same year in
the same spot is something a little
new for Stanford to take.
But don't worry about Albert
warming any bench. The chances
are that both he and Fay will play
more time in the fall than any other
back with the possible exception of
Norm Standlee. Upon these three
men, incidentally, rests most of the
potentialities of this year's eleven.
