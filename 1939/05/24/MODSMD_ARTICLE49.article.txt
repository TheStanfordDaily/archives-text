# Last of the Shows?
## 
### 
STANFORD may witness this year, what is
its last Spring Show.
That was the announcement yesterday of
J. P. Cahn, director.
Refusing to place the responsibility on any
one personally, he referred indirectly to the
same type of opposition that has met many of
Stanford's social activities this last year.
There has not been direct criticism of the
Spring Show. In fact, there has been little criti
cism of dramatics in general.
Rather, there has been the charge that stu
dents who are involved in the production of
the show are failing to keep up with the aca
demic side of Stanford life.
However, if the administration will pause
for a moment, look at the record, it will find
that those who are having difficulty are not
those who are vitally concerned with the Spring
Show.
It will find that that is merely a convenient
excuse.
For a good many weelcs there have been a
series of unfortunate stories filtering out of
Memorial Hall that there was soon to be an
administrative shut-down on the Spring Show,
the Gaieties, and other student-produced dra
matic presentations.
Consistently, there has been no concrete
foundation for these stories. Now, however,
there seems to be some basis for them.
"Lack of administration interest," says J. P.
Cahn, "may make continuance of the Spring
Show difficult."
And that is a generalization that applies to
more activities than the Spring Show.
Where, exactly, will it end?
