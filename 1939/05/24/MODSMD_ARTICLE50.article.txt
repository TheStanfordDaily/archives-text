# For Further Consideration
## 
### 
EX COMMITTEE stuck its nose in where it
doesn't exactly belong last night.
It was afraid, it appears, to build up a hier
archy on the Quad.
So, it turned back the recommendation of the
editor and the business manager of the Quad
for further consideration by Publications Coun
cil.
It's true that one house has controlled the
editorship of the Quad for a good many years.
But it's also true that a vote of the staff has
approved the editor's choice for his successor.
It's true that there's nobody else for the job.
Ex Committee evidently thinks it can pull
Quad editors out of the hat.
All there is to say:
Let them try it.
