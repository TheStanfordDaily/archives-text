# Not Dead Yet
## 
### 
IT doesn't seem like much, Dud, that you and
I should only have left what's been in the
past.
Unfortunately, however, that seems to be all.
Today, when I had to first turn to Larry, hand
outstretched, it meant that you were to join one
of the finest groups of men that The Daily has
ever seen.
At this point there doesn't seem to be much
left for you and me, and Jean and Press. But
there's more than you think.
There is Volume 95.
Just what it has meant to Stanford is an im
measurable quantity. Whatever it has been,
however, is as much due to your efforts as
anyone else's. Your photographs, your edits,
your news stories have meant just as much to
The Daily as the work of those who may have
done that work just a little more spectacularly,
if not just as consistently.
As you consider "what might have been,"
remember what has been.
And remember particularly your part in what
has been and what will be yet.
