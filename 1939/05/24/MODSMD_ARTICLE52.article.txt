# Long Live Volume 96
## 
### 
THIS morning, The Daily finds itself with a
new editor.
Three years ago, that new editor walked into
the Daily Shack, asked for his first position on
the staff. He trembled as most Daily tryoutees
do; he was a little baffled by all the confusion
of copy desk.
Today, however, he's as near to me top as
anyone can come—he's editor-elect.
Just how long it will take Stanford to realize
how good an editor it has is a matter for debate.
But this much is sure:
The man who will next fall occupy the green
cushion on the lopsided chair won't find that
cushion too well grooved for comfort.
For Larry Livingston has ideas.
He has absorbed over a three-year period the
spirit of Stanford — and that's what Stanford
needs.
For some time Stanford has to a large extent

forgotten itself. It has turned to the City, it has
turned to outside interests for motivation.
But Larry will not forget the Stanford that
used to be.
The Stanford that still may be.
He will type firmly and concisely on the
Underwood in the editor's office.
And that will do credit to Stanford.
And to Volume 96.
