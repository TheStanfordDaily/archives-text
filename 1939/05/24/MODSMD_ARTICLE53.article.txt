Managing Editor, Volumes 94 and !)5
Death, as it must to all men . . .
And there's a perfect lead on the story which is
written twice a year in The Daily. It's the story of
Daily elections.
It belongs in the Sad Commentary Department, this
business of building-up-to-an-awful-let-down, which
has happened ever since The Daily began electing
editors. Net result of this voting is that the theoretically
second best man on the stafT is lost—his value, after
a certain number of crosses on a certain number of
ballots are counted, boils down to nil. He's out—com
pletely.
* * * *
Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it gives the defeated
candidate a chance to do things he always has wanted
to do, but, because of The Daily, has been unable to
find time or willingness to undertake these other
projects. That, at least, is the contention of one former
candidate for editor of The Daily, who was defeated
by a close vote. At first, he told me, it seemed as
though someone were playing mumblety-peg between
his shoulder-blades, but when a week or two of
reminiscing and condolences had cluttered up the air,
he decided that what-the-hell-maybc-it-was-all-for
the-best. And he still holds that view, with emphasis,
today—long after the dust has formed a 3-em coating
on his picture, which was engraved especially for the
occasion. A monument to futility.
Methinks, however, that the former candidate for
the editorship of The Daily was drooling rationalism,
which is a habit usually acquired in college, and a
rather morbid one, according to all qualified observers.
There is no reason why any organization, whether
it be the Thuddlewhap County Pansy Study League or
the International Council for the Legalization of Presi
dential Offices, should have to guillotine its second
best man. Top-notch ability is not exactly übiquitous,
and any pruning of such man-power is pure waste,
without justification.

Now, I'm not carrying a torch for any candidate.
I am, on the contrary, merely stating a fact which
Daily staffs have known for many years—a fact which
has tormented editorial boards to such an extent that
a serious study was launched two years ago on the
subject. But the study withered away into nothing
ness.
Mayhap someday an editorial board will decide now
listen we-gotta-do-somcthing-about-this-situa
tion-and-let's-do-it-now. And. if the gods be willing,
an answer to the problem will be dragged out, tried
and not found wanting. Then, The Daily will be a
perfect organization.
Today, the situation is unchanged. And the situa
tion will be unchanged, most likely, for many volumes
to come. Yeah, The Daily will continue to pile up in
front of doors five mornings every week—it'll always
cotne out, and the campus will reach for it and grin
and growl as it has in the past.
But that interdepartmental inefficiency continues—
and The Daily, the most-demanded section of Stan
fordiana, which requires four years of sincere and
sometimes thankless work of every staff member, con
tinues to muddle along with a vestigial mechanism that
permits unnecessary death.
There'll come a time when editorial board will
have a brainstorm, and then there will be no need for
Daily gripe sessions.
Ain't progress wonderful?

find time or willingness to undertake these other
projects. That, at least, is the contention of one former
candidate for editor of The Daily, who was defeated
by a close vote. At first, he told me, it seemed as
though someone were playing mumblety-peg between
his shoulder-blades, but when a week or two of
reminiscing and condolences had cluttered up the air,
he decided that what-the-hell-maybc-it-was-all-for
the-best. And he still holds that view, with emphasis,
today—long after the dust has formed a 3-em coating
on his picture, which was engraved especially for the
occasion. A monument to futility.
Methinks, however, that the former candidate for
the editorship of The Daily was drooling rationalism,
which is a habit usually acquired in college, and a
rather morbid one, according to all qualified observers.
There is no reason why any organization, whether
it be the Thuddlewhap County Pansy Study League or
the International Council for the Legalization of Presi
dential Offices, should have to guillotine its second
best man. Top-notch ability is not exactly übiquitous,
and any pruning of such man-power is pure waste,
without justification.

Now, I'm not carrying a torch for any candidate.
I am, on the contrary, merely stating a fact which
Daily staffs have known for many years—a fact which
has tormented editorial boards to such an extent that
a serious study was launched two years ago on the
subject. But the study withered away into nothing
ness.
Mayhap someday an editorial board will decide now
listen we-gotta-do-somcthing-about-this-situa
tion-and-let's-do-it-now. And. if the gods be willing,
an answer to the problem will be dragged out, tried
and not found wanting. Then, The Daily will be a
perfect organization.
Today, the situation is unchanged. And the situa
tion will be unchanged, most likely, for many volumes
to come. Yeah, The Daily will continue to pile up in
front of doors five mornings every week—it'll always
cotne out, and the campus will reach for it and grin
and growl as it has in the past.
But that interdepartmental inefficiency continues—
and The Daily, the most-demanded section of Stan
fordiana, which requires four years of sincere and
sometimes thankless work of every staff member, con
tinues to muddle along with a vestigial mechanism that
permits unnecessary death.
There'll come a time when editorial board will
have a brainstorm, and then there will be no need for
Daily gripe sessions.
Ain't progress wonderful?
Managing Editor, Volumes 94 and !)5
Death, as it must to all men . . .
And there's a perfect lead on the story which is
written twice a year in The Daily. It's the story of
Daily elections.
It belongs in the Sad Commentary Department, this
business of building-up-to-an-awful-let-down, which
has happened ever since The Daily began electing
editors. Net result of this voting is that the theoretically
second best man on the stafT is lost—his value, after
a certain number of crosses on a certain number of
ballots are counted, boils down to nil. He's out—com
pletely.

Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it gives the defeated
candidate a chance to do things he always has wanted
to do, but, because of The Daily, has been unable to
find time or willingness to undertake these other
projects. That, at least, is the contention of one former
candidate for editor of The Daily, who was defeated
