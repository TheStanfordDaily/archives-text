# Lightly ... And Politely

### DOUG JAQUES 
(This is a story about a fabulous character. He
has a full, if somewhat nasal voice, he wears his
clothes in a perfectly natural way, and he sleeps
with his feet toward Mecca like any good Chris
tian; but he's just not like other people. Some of
what I will say happened in the past, some will
happen in the future; and all of it can happen.)

Life has been dull for him since he lost his affinity
for both rain and girls, and has had to slop singing
duets under trees in the rain.
One night this quarter he did find a girl who liked
to sing duets in the center of the Quad in the moon
light, and forthwith took her to the center of the
Quad and sang till the cows came home and it was
lockout time.
I personally would rather have heard a nice fat
wolf howling at the moon than to have heard him sing
that night—and the girl must have felt the same way
about it. She has not been with him in the moon
light in the centcr of the Quad since.
And that is a perfectly innocent statement. If she
was with him in the Quad in the moonlight, they
would be singing.

This spring has been hard on him. I can remember
last spring when the lake was full, he would get a
date wilh a girl and take her canoeing. Often I have
seen him standing in front of the mirror, his wavy
hair neatly combed, his teeth a gleaming white, sing
ing like mad to his face and teeth and hair in the
mirror, getting ready for his very, very romantic date.
Rut this has been a bad year. lie has spent
several dull months going to shows with the boys
and half-heartedly learning the new songs, and
having no dates.
It was one of these nights with the boys that
he saw the movie, "Yes My Darling Daughter."
The boys were talking about the scene where the
young man and young woman go away to a lake
together for the week-end, and both of their par
ents are furious.
"Well, why shouldn't they go away together," he
said. "They were in love, weren't they?''
I began to feel rather sorry for the romantic little
x>y who couldn't get a date.
I was pleased to hear the other day that he has a
date for a dance on one of the coming week-ends—
even if it is an imported date.
"Boy, wait until she comes in on the train," the
boys were saying. "We'll fix it all up. Joe and Bill
and John can play horns, and we'll get up a band and
meet her at the station. It will be a riot."
As I say, I was beginning to feel srrry for this
fellow from the never-never land..; give him
one spring quarter night." I said. "Let's let him
have his date."
"Oh. we've already told him about it," they said,
"lie thinks it's a swell idea. He wants to play his
French horn."

I was pleased to hear the other day that he has a
date for a dance on one of the coming week-ends—
even if it is an imported date.
"Boy, wait until she comes in on the train," the
boys were saying. "We'll fix it all up. Joe and Bill
and John can play horns, and we'll get up a band and
meet her at the station. It will be a riot."
As I say, I was beginning to feel srrry for this
fellow from the never-never land..; give him
one spring quarter night." I said. "Let's let him
have his date."
"Oh. we've already told him about it," they said,
"lie thinks it's a swell idea. He wants to play his
French horn."

(This is a story about a fabulous character. He
has a full, if somewhat nasal voice, he wears his
clothes in a perfectly natural way, and he sleeps
with his feet toward Mecca like any good Chris
tian; but he's just not like other people. Some of
what I will say happened in the past, some will
happen in the future; and all of it can happen.)

Life has been dull for him since he lost his affinity
for both rain and girls, and has had to slop singing
duets under trees in the rain.
One night this quarter he did find a girl who liked
to sing duets in the center of the Quad in the moon
light, and forthwith took her to the center of the
Quad and sang till the cows came home and it was
lockout time.
I personally would rather have heard a nice fat
wolf howling at the moon than to have heard him sing
that night—and the girl must have felt the same way
about it. She has not been with him in the moon
light in the centcr of the Quad since.
And that is a perfectly innocent statement. If she
was with him in the Quad in the moonlight, they
would be singing.

This spring has been hard on him. I can remember
last spring when the lake was full, he would get a
date wilh a girl and take her canoeing. Often I have
seen him standing in front of the mirror, his wavy
hair neatly combed, his teeth a gleaming white, sing
ing like mad to his face and teeth and hair in the
mirror, getting ready for his very, very romantic date.
Rut this has been a bad year. lie has spent
several dull months going to shows with the boys
and half-heartedly learning the new songs, and
having no dates.
It was one of these nights with the boys that
he saw the movie, "Yes My Darling Daughter."
The boys were talking about the scene where the
young man and young woman go away to a lake
together for the week-end, and both of their par
ents are furious.
"Well, why shouldn't they go away together," he
said. "They were in love, weren't they?''
I began to feel rather sorry for the romantic little
x>y who couldn't get a date.
I was pleased to hear the other day that he has a
date for a dance on one of the coming week-ends—
