### LARRY LIVINCSTON 
ACCUSTOMED have we be
come to looking across the At
lantic at the antics of the man with
the forelock and the man with the
chin, that we almost have forgot
ten the importance of the danger
that lurks in the Orient.
However, when European news is
dull, one always can look to Japan
and China to provide enough ex
citement, to keep the presses roll
ing. Today the trans-Pacific powers
no longer are engaged in their pri
vate war, but are looking to the
western nations for their alliances
and battles.
$ *
To find a starting point on the
vicious circle, first there is the
problem of the Anglo-Soviet pact
and what bearing it will have on
relations between Japan and Rus
sia. Ever since the island empire
failed in its attempt to gain more
than economic domination of
China, it has been obvious that it
will try to expand in some other
direction.
French Indo-China is a possibil
ity, but more convenient and more
probable is the Siberian plain north
of Manchukuo. A very simple and
practical extension of control this
would be, but it is sure to result in
an armed protest by Russia. When
the London-Moscow alliance is
signed and sealed, it will prove but
another complication added to the
picture.
* * *
France and Britain will be
pledged to fight by the side of
the Soviet if it is attacked by the
Japanese. Despite a recent refusal
to do so, at such a juncture Nippon
would convert the anti-Commintern
agreement into a military pact, and
Mussolini and Hitler would come
to her aid.
Here we have another World
War. a battle royal involving all
the major powers, caused by the
overpopulation of a group of Pa
cific Islands. It may seem ridicu
lous to foresee England and (Ger
many at war over a minor con
quest on the other side of the
world, but if either of them is
looking for an excuse, that will
be as good as any.
* * *
If anyone is in need of proof that
Japan has no fear of the vengeance
of the western nations, he has only
to turn the spotlight on the inter
national settlement of Amoy iu
China. There Nipponese officers
blandly have been violating British,
French, and American neutrality
and safe-conduct rights throughout
the past weeks.
In an effort to gain control of the
.strategically-located city, the Japa
nese have sailed a threatening num
ber of warships into the harbor, and
have been answered by the western
powers' matching vessel for vessel.

TUESDAY a well armed
Japanese cruiser stopped a
large British merchantman, the
Ranpura, boarded her, and in
spected her papers. Outraged, but
helpless, the English could only
protest the incident. Yesterday it
was re-enacted when the French
liner. Aramis, was boarded in vio
lation of all international law and
its officers were submitted to simi
lar indignities.
Episodes like these, house to
house searches for Chinese sympa
thizers in the settlement reserved for
British, French, and U.S. citizens,
and Japanese declarations of in
amicable intentions are supremely
indicative of the attitude of the em
pire. Again and again the western
ers will brush these incidents aside
like flies, but a final showdown is
inevitable.
* * *
In another year than this one,
Japan's ambitions would not be con
sidered a proper cause for *a war
which would involve Europe. But
the situation is different now from
what it was during the Sino-Japa
nese War. At. that time conditions
in the western world were relatively
settled.

TUESDAY a well armed
Japanese cruiser stopped a
large British merchantman, the
Ranpura, boarded her, and in
spected her papers. Outraged, but
helpless, the English could only
protest the incident. Yesterday it
was re-enacted when the French
liner. Aramis, was boarded in vio
lation of all international law and
its officers were submitted to simi
lar indignities.
Episodes like these, house to
house searches for Chinese sympa
thizers in the settlement reserved for
British, French, and U.S. citizens,
and Japanese declarations of in
amicable intentions are supremely
indicative of the attitude of the em
pire. Again and again the western
ers will brush these incidents aside
like flies, but a final showdown is
inevitable.

In another year than this one,
Japan's ambitions would not be con
sidered a proper cause for *a war
which would involve Europe. But
the situation is different now from
what it was during the Sino-Japa
nese War. At. that time conditions
in the western world were relatively
settled.
ACCUSTOMED have we be
come to looking across the At
lantic at the antics of the man with
the forelock and the man with the
chin, that we almost have forgot
ten the importance of the danger
that lurks in the Orient.
However, when European news is
dull, one always can look to Japan
and China to provide enough ex
citement, to keep the presses roll
ing. Today the trans-Pacific powers
no longer are engaged in their pri
vate war, but are looking to the
western nations for their alliances
and battles.

To find a starting point on the
vicious circle, first there is the
problem of the Anglo-Soviet pact
and what bearing it will have on
relations between Japan and Rus
sia. Ever since the island empire
failed in its attempt to gain more
than economic domination of
China, it has been obvious that it
will try to expand in some other
direction.
French Indo-China is a possibil
ity, but more convenient and more
probable is the Siberian plain north
of Manchukuo. A very simple and
practical extension of control this
would be, but it is sure to result in
an armed protest by Russia. When
the London-Moscow alliance is
signed and sealed, it will prove but
another complication added to the
picture.
* * *
France and Britain will be
pledged to fight by the side of
the Soviet if it is attacked by the
Japanese. Despite a recent refusal
to do so, at such a juncture Nippon
would convert the anti-Commintern
agreement into a military pact, and
Mussolini and Hitler would come
to her aid.
Here we have another World
War. a battle royal involving all
the major powers, caused by the
overpopulation of a group of Pa
cific Islands. It may seem ridicu
lous to foresee England and (Ger
many at war over a minor con
quest on the other side of the
world, but if either of them is
looking for an excuse, that will
be as good as any.
* * *
If anyone is in need of proof that
Japan has no fear of the vengeance
of the western nations, he has only
to turn the spotlight on the inter
national settlement of Amoy iu
China. There Nipponese officers
blandly have been violating British,
French, and American neutrality
and safe-conduct rights throughout
the past weeks.
