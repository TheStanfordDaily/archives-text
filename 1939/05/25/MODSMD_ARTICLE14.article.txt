# Spring Show Sound System Stands Tests
## 'Wake Up' Hearing Insured by Three Broadcasting Units 
### 
Auidences for this — perhaps the
last—Spring Show, "Wake Up and
Leave," will have no trouble in
hearing lines and songs Friday and
Saturday nights, show directors
claim.
Since criticism has been leveled at
former shows because public address
systems were inadequate, special
provisions have been made this
year to insure fool-proof broadcast
ing equipment, they said.
Three independent public address
systems have been mounted, com
prising several thousand dollars
worth of equipment, according to

Director J. P. Cahn. Two of the sys
tems will be in use, with the third
ready at any time to replace either
one.
Five speakers will carry stage
voices to every part of Memorial
Hall. Tests conducted last night,
after equipment had been checked
by Dr. Frederic Terman, professor
of electrical engineering, proved
that a stage whisper would carry to
upper balcony rows.
Cahn announced that curtain Fri
day and Saturday nights would go
up promptly at 8 o'clock, and that
late-comer.s would not be seated un
til the first break in the show.
Art McCue's 16-piece band, with
a 27-instrument combination pos
sible, has been rehearsing the 18
musical arrangements prepared by
Myron Birnbaum, have found "Wake
Up and Leave" music "the best
we've played for a Stanford show."
Dramatic Manager Hank Hauser,
considering the number of house
dances this week-end, suggested that
the early curtain time of "Wake Up
and Leave" would make it quite
possible to attend both the show
and the dance the same evening.
"It will make a fine combination,"
he said.

Although ticket sales have been
mounting rapidly, Dramatic Man
ager Hank Hauser said yesterday
that many good seats for any of
the three prices—75 cents, 50 cents
and $I—were still available at
the A.S.S.U. office. He also re
minded those who wish to return
tickets that they will have until
Friday afternoon at 5 o'clock.
