# Vitamins Defined On Radio Hour
## 
### 
"All of us have heard of vitamins
for we live in a vitamin conscious
world," said Dr. Dwight L. Wilbur
in his address on "Vitamins" on the
Stanford University Radio Hour last
night.
He continued by defining vitamins
as sparks that are necessary for
growth, for reproduction, for use of
the special senses and for life it
self. He went on with a considera
tion of the individual vitamins, the
things they do, and the results
which follow a lack of a sufficient
supply of them.
"Vitamin deficiency diseases com
pose the only known group of
disease which is entirely prevent
able and curable," he concluded,
"and it is well to remember that
vitamins are foods and not drugs, so
that the grocery store is more im
portant than the drug store in the
prevention and treatment of vitamin
deficiency states."
