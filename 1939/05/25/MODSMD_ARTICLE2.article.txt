U. S. NAVY'S "Squalus," shown above, sank Tuesday l(i miles off Portsmouth in 240 feet of water. A
specially constructed rescue diving hell, used for the first time, was sent down yesterday afternoon, brought
up 25 survivors in three trips, left eight men still alive in the sub, reported 26 men dead. The Navy's
newest undcrseas craft filled rapidly, sank during a test run when a high speed induction valve failed to
close. It was believed that the inrush of water accounted for the reported deaths.
