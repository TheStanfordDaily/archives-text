# President Says Stanford Won't Split Conference Over Proselyting Issue
## Atherton Charges Won't Change Indian Attitude on Participation In Pacific Coast League Games 
### ARCH JENKINS Sports Editor 
Stanford will be no party to a break-up of the Pacific Coast Conference.
Reassuring The Daily on a stand which he took earlier in the week at
a San Francisco luncheon. President Itay Lyman Wilbur last night declared
again that hints of the subsidization of athletes in most of the schools would
in 110 way alter the I'arms favorable attitude toward the collegiate league
and its principles.
President Wilbur had further intimated in his San Francisco inter
view that the notorious Atherton "G"-man survey of the athletic nollcies

â–ºof all the conference schools would
in no wLse affect the Stanford posi
tion.
The Atherton investigation, spon
sored by the conference itself and
led by former G-man Edward G.
Atherton, is just now concluding its
sweeping studies, in the Pacific
Northwest institutions. Atherton
himself wi'l bring his findings and
recommendations to the semi-annual
meeting of the conference early in
June.
FIRST OFFICIAL DICTUM
President Wilbur's open stand on
the aid-to-athletes problem is the
first such official dictum to come
from any of the high ranking officials
in the league's official and unofficial
membership, including the ice
packed and frozen pseudo-members
from Montana and Idaho.
On several instances, however,
discontent, charges and counter
charges have been hurled back and
forth, especially during the football
season and immediately preceding
the conference track meet held in
Seattle last Saturday. All of the
northern members had more than
their share of trouble with the Cali
fornia .squads last fall and only
Washington State proved a match
for the Southerners in track and field
competition.
Proponents of the hinted split are
equally divided between the north
ern and southern members, with
neither side showing any willingness
to co-operate or arbitrate until Dr.
Wilbur established Stanford's view
point this week. The Southerners
apparently desire games with the
bigger drawing cards of the inde
pendent schools, while the Northern
ers have often hinted that their
members could get "better breaks'
and more recognition in a separate
conference. Both sides have shown
tendencies to cover up trouble in
their own yards by hurling prose
lyting charges and the like at the
! other schools with reckless abandon.
SPLIT REMOTE
Regarding proselyting and assist
ance, President Wilbur put the Stan
ford foot forward in exceptionally
plain fashion.
"I am interested in opportunity
and help for boys who have to
struggle," he insisted, "but beyond
I the fees charged by the University,
help should be limited to honest
jobs. All we have to do is to be
honest about our sports and keep
them clean. And we can't ever let
gate receipts become an important
or guiding influence."
i With Stanford breaking the ice on
! the most dangerous subject to face
! conference members since the virtual
j exclusion of Montana and Idaho
J three years ago, the tension of the
1 early June meeting has apparently
I been lessened considerably. It is
! quite probable that the Atherton
probe will alter somewhat the man
ner in which the member schools
obtain and keep athletes, but any
| danger of a complete conference
I split now seems remote.
