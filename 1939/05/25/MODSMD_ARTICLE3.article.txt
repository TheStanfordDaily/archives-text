# Deep Sea 'Elevator' Rescues 25 from Sunken Submarine
## 
### 
PORTSMOUTH, N.H., May 25 (UP). —Navy divers descended to cold
depths of the Atlantic yesterday and in three perilous trips of an under
sea "elevator" brought to the surface 25 survivors of the foundered sub
marine U.S.S. Squalus—but reported that 2(» "undoubtedly" had perished
in the disaster.
It was believed that only a fourth trip would be necessary to raise the
remaining eight of the 33 survivors. When the newest of the Navy's sub-

marines sank helplessly in diving *
grounds off the isles of shoals yes
terday 59 men were aboard.
The survivors were raised in
groups of seven, eight and ten in a
diving bell, the first such rescues
in U.S. Navy history. All wei - e de
scribed as in good condition. Two
who were brought to the Navy Yard
pier and placed in ambulances ap
peared to laymen, however, to "have
suffered from exposure.
OFFICER SAVED
The submarine salvage tug Falcon
brought the first batch of seven to
the surface in its cylindrical metal

chamber at 1:26 p.m. E.D.T. Among
them was Lieutenant Johr. C. Nich
ols of Chicago, fourth in command
of the stricken submarine, who was
shot up ahead of enlisted men so
that his superiors might have a
clear picture of conditions in the
stricken Squalus, 240 feet below.
General opinion among naval men
at the scene was the dead men had
been trapped in the flooded com
partments in the first rush of water
through the induction valve. They
drowned there, it was believed,
without hope of escape, while their
comrades were able to shut off the
flood by closing watertight doors.
LIVING RESCUED
Naval authorities said the rescue
work would go on "day and night"
until the submarine was raised to the
surface, but it was believed if present
progress were maintained at least
all of the living would be raised to
night under searchlights from the
concentration of Naval and Coast
Guard craft clustered about the oil
slicked waters five miles south of
the Isles of Shoals and 1G miles off
shore.
The tragedy occurred yesterday
when the Squalus submerged on a
practice dive at 9:40 a.m. When it
failed to rise on schedule time, the
sister sub Sculpin was ordered to
search for the Squalus and saw a
red smoke bomb burst over the sea
to indicate a mishap.
The Sculpin discovered a com
munications buoy floated from the
submerged vessel. In the buoy was
a telephone to the Squalus and the
Scuipin talked over it to Lieutenant
Naquin for a few minutes until the
line snapped. Thereafter communi
cation was maintained in code mes
sages rapped out inside the Squalus'
hull and picked up by the delicate
sound detection apparatus aboard
the Sculpin.

The rescue tug Falcon's diving
bell, bringing the last eight sur
vivors to the surface from the sub
marine Squalus, stalled at a depth
of 150 feet tonight. A diver was
sent down to assist in clearing the
bell, which apparently had become
fouled in some lines. Lieutenant
Commander John I), Longstaff
said the trouble was minor and
undoubtedly could be cleared up
by the diver.

The rescue tug Falcon's diving

PORTSMOUTH, N.H., May 25 (UP). —Navy divers descended to cold
depths of the Atlantic yesterday and in three perilous trips of an under
sea "elevator" brought to the surface 25 survivors of the foundered sub
marine U.S.S. Squalus—but reported that 2(» "undoubtedly" had perished
in the disaster.
It was believed that only a fourth trip would be necessary to raise the
remaining eight of the 33 survivors. When the newest of the Navy's sub-

marines sank helplessly in diving *
grounds off the isles of shoals yes
terday 59 men were aboard.
The survivors were raised in
groups of seven, eight and ten in a
diving bell, the first such rescues
in U.S. Navy history. All wei - e de
scribed as in good condition. Two
who were brought to the Navy Yard
pier and placed in ambulances ap
peared to laymen, however, to "have
suffered from exposure.
OFFICER SAVED
The submarine salvage tug Falcon
brought the first batch of seven to
the surface in its cylindrical metal

chamber at 1:26 p.m. E.D.T. Among
them was Lieutenant Johr. C. Nich
ols of Chicago, fourth in command
of the stricken submarine, who was
shot up ahead of enlisted men so
that his superiors might have a
clear picture of conditions in the
stricken Squalus, 240 feet below.
General opinion among naval men
at the scene was the dead men had
been trapped in the flooded com
partments in the first rush of water
through the induction valve. They
drowned there, it was believed,
without hope of escape, while their
comrades were able to shut off the
flood by closing watertight doors.
LIVING RESCUED
Naval authorities said the rescue
work would go on "day and night"
until the submarine was raised to the
surface, but it was believed if present
progress were maintained at least
all of the living would be raised to
night under searchlights from the
concentration of Naval and Coast
Guard craft clustered about the oil
slicked waters five miles south of
the Isles of Shoals and 1G miles off
shore.
The tragedy occurred yesterday
when the Squalus submerged on a
practice dive at 9:40 a.m. When it
failed to rise on schedule time, the
sister sub Sculpin was ordered to
search for the Squalus and saw a
red smoke bomb burst over the sea
to indicate a mishap.
The Sculpin discovered a com
munications buoy floated from the
submerged vessel. In the buoy was
a telephone to the Squalus and the
Scuipin talked over it to Lieutenant
Naquin for a few minutes until the
line snapped. Thereafter communi
cation was maintained in code mes
