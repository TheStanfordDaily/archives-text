# Council Decides Code Violation
## 
### 
An Honor Code ca.se, involving
a Med School student who borrowed
a formula from his neighbor in a
final exam, used it and turned it in
as his own work, was handled in
Men' Council yesterday in addition
to several standard traffic cases.
After Men's Council had once ac
cepted his story and dismissed the
case against him, the student con
fessed that he had cheated in the
exam. Decision of Council was that
he should be failed in the course
and placed on probation for the rest
of his college career.
