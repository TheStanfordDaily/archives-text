## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Bear Distance Man Beats Girard in Twilight Mile 
### 
Coach Dink Templeton entertained
| one of California's distance men yes
) terday in the weekly twilight meet,
j but the guest, Dick Peter, winner of
| the half-mile in the dual meet be-
I tween Cal and Stanford, proved to
j be very unappreeiative. Instead of
, politely allowing the Cards' ace mil
| er, "Mush" Girard, to take the four
i lap event as was expected, Peter
I stepped ahead of "Mush" to win by
j some 8 yards.
Peter's time was 4:19.9, pretty fair
i for a sophomore who supposedly
| specializes on the half-mile! The
j track fans will see plenty of races
I next year between these two for
i both will be back for more cinder
j burning.
1 The other event of interest in yes-
I terday's meet was a one-man affair.
, It featured Dick Simpson in 400 me-
I ters of low hurdling. Dink sent
j "Simp" through his first hurdle race
' at this distance in preparation for
1 the Compton Relays which has this
Olympic event on its program. Dick

I skimmed through the grueling 400
meters of barrier in 54.G, which is
pretty good for the first time.
He made the mistake of most be
ginners by running the first half too
fast, but Dick has the strength and
should develop with practice. If he
I can cut a second off his time it
j should be fast enough to win at
Compton for last year Greg Stout,
I formerly of Cal, won in 53.3.
There was little other action on
! the cinder path last evening, for
i many of the tracksters were missing.
I Clyde Jeffrey, giving handicaps of
j 1 yard to Ray Dean, 2 yards to Dick
i Carew, and 3 yards to Stan HLser
! man, just missed catching Dean in
a 9.7 century.
And in a furlong dash, he just
i barely failed to eat up the five yards
I allotted to Carew and was timed
•in 21.2.

1 The other event of interest in yes-
I terday's meet was a one-man affair.
, It featured Dick Simpson in 400 me-
I ters of low hurdling. Dink sent
j "Simp" through his first hurdle race
' at this distance in preparation for
1 the Compton Relays which has this
Olympic event on its program. Dick

I skimmed through the grueling 400
meters of barrier in 54.G, which is
pretty good for the first time.
He made the mistake of most be
ginners by running the first half too
fast, but Dick has the strength and
should develop with practice. If he
I can cut a second off his time it
j should be fast enough to win at
Compton for last year Greg Stout,
I formerly of Cal, won in 53.3.
There was little other action on
! the cinder path last evening, for
i many of the tracksters were missing.
I Clyde Jeffrey, giving handicaps of
j 1 yard to Ray Dean, 2 yards to Dick
i Carew, and 3 yards to Stan HLser
! man, just missed catching Dean in
a 9.7 century.
And in a furlong dash, he just
i barely failed to eat up the five yards
I allotted to Carew and was timed
•in 21.2.

Coach Dink Templeton entertained
| one of California's distance men yes
) terday in the weekly twilight meet,
j but the guest, Dick Peter, winner of
| the half-mile in the dual meet be-
I tween Cal and Stanford, proved to
j be very unappreeiative. Instead of
, politely allowing the Cards' ace mil
| er, "Mush" Girard, to take the four
i lap event as was expected, Peter
I stepped ahead of "Mush" to win by
j some 8 yards.
Peter's time was 4:19.9, pretty fair
i for a sophomore who supposedly
| specializes on the half-mile! The
j track fans will see plenty of races
I next year between these two for
i both will be back for more cinder
j burning.
