# A.S.U. to Debate Nazi Regime
## 2 German Students Will Speak Tonight 
### 
Nazi Germany's youth movement
and other aspects of the Hitler re
gime will be debated from opposing
viewpoints tonight as Adolf Bode,
German exchange student, and
Gertie Landauer, of the University
of California, appear at the Ameri
can Student Union meeting in the
Women's Clubhouse at 8 o'clock.
Bode, who lives in the Beta house
on the campus, is a member of Hit
ler's National Socialist Party, while
Miss Landauer was a student for
several years in Germany before she
returned to Berkeley, where he
father is a professor.
According to President Glasmann
of the A.S.U., elections to fill offices
for next, year will be conducted
prior to the start of the discussion.
"The discussion should be par
ticularly interesting, Miss Glasmann
said, "since both Miss Landauer and
Bode were in Germany to witness
Hitler's advent to power and his
gradual transformation of demo
cratic Germany into a totalitarian
state."
Guests will be invited to take part
in the discussion and both speakers
have signified their willingness to
answer question in so far as they are
able, Miss Glasmann said.
