STANFORD'S social system is rapidly becom
ing an inconsistency.
For the last few months, the keynote has been
Stanford activities for Stanford men and women.
Ostensibly the Farm was to sponsor for itself a
program which would once again interest itself
in itself.
That part of the program is fine.
Now, however, it seems that on-campus af
fairs are receiving the same touch that off-cam
pus affairs received for a purpose.
Stanford is told in one breath that it should
stay home and enjoy itself.
On the intake it is told it can't have a floor
show, it can't have a movie queen. Now the
Spring Show is being quietly smothered by
lack of "administrative interest."
Unfortunately, however, there doesn't seem
to be much purpose behind the latter moves.
If there -isn't some change in attitude toward
these social and other like activities that under
graduates plan for themselves, just one thing
can result:
That is, that Stanford, instead of being the
democratic and peaceful community that every
one seems to desire, will be split into a hundred
small groups, each going its own way and get
ting farther and farther away from the central
tradition of the Stanford spirit.
Toward the kind of spirit that can best be
found in small spots close to U.S. 101.
