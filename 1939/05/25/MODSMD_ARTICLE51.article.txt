# Answer to a Problem
## 
### 
IN almost every American college there is an
illegitimate child, a little accident which
everyone knows exists, but is seldom brought
out and introduced to company.
Subsidizing athletes has become an almost
universal practice in institutions of higher edu
cation; yet a majority of them are ashamed of
the fact and conceal it whenever possible.
That some schools have gone beyond the
moral bounds of amateur sport is responsible
for the stigma which has become attached to
university aid to athletes.
Scholarships, hashing jobs, and work in other
necessary positions are certainly legitimate.
But in marked instances athletic stars have
been treated more like valuable employees than
students of a university.
This never has been true at Stanford.
When Dr. Wilbur told newspaper interview
ers that he favors financial aid for athletes to
the extent of regular charges made by the Uni
versity, he was looking an unavoidable situation
straight in the eye.
With intercollegiate sports running in their
present groove and financial conditions what
they are, it would be a wilfully blind college
president who tried to reform the system. In
stead of doing battle with the windmills, Dr.
Wilbur has accepted athletic aid at its face
value.
From something that might have smelled of
professionalism, he has created a set-up de
signed to give educational opportunities to
young men who otherwise would be unable
to go to college.
Stanford depends on sports admissions to
help pay for its dormitories and laboratories.
The University makes no secret of the fact.
As long as the Administration xegards ath
letic subsidies in this fair and honest light, Stan
ford will walk with dignity in the field of ama
teur sport. —L. L.
