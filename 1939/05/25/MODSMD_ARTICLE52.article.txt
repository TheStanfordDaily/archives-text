TYPICAL attitude of Ex Committee toward
the publications that the A.S.S.U. publishes
is that anyone is competent to hold top posi
tions.
That attitude resulted Tuesday night in a
refusal by Ex Committee to approve the ap
pointments for editor and business manager of
next year's Quad on the grounds that one
fraternity for a number of years has had mem
bers of its house as editor or business manager
or both and that this is the time to put an end
to the practice.
Ex Committee did not consider the merits of
the individuals involved, did not inquire par

ticularly into the why and how of the situation.
In the first place, there is nobody else for the
two jobs.
Quad appointments were not made on the
basis of house affiliation. The editor has a
signed statement from each of the four junior
editors, from whom the editor was chosen, each
of which names as suggested editor the man
who was picked. Those statements were made
two weeks before appointments were made.
Publications Council has recommended that
Ex Committee reconsider its action and has
suggested an investigation next year to study
the system whereby Quad appointments are
made with an eye to changing it so that the
Quad will attract and hold more persons who
are interested and capable enough to hold top
Quad positions and so that the editor will not
be forced to pick a man from his own house.
The difference between the two methods is
obvious—one is positive, the other is negative.
It's time Ex Committee put a little reverse
English on the legislative ball.
