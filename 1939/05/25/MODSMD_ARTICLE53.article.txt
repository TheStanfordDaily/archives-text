### PAYSON J. TREAT Professor of History 
r ¥ I HERE are certain compensations these days for the
student of history. He doesn't get the jitters so
easily; he knows that the gift of prophecy has not been
bestowed on man (at least in this generation), so most
of the dire predictions of our Cassandras will never
eventuate; and he fails to be impressed by either the
sweeping generalization or the unqualified assertion.
So many of the arguments which have arisen during
the present long-drawn-out crisis start from assertions
which cannot be established. "If another world war
is fought it will mean the end of Western Civilization"
—a pretty mouthful, but meaning nothing at all. West
em Civilization has been assailed by destructive agen
cies as potent, in their day, as any which the imme
diate future can hold, yet it has never been destroyed.
The recuperative power of a worthwhile civilization
is as marvelous as that of the human body. If West
ern Civilization falls, it will be due more likely to
dry rot and termites than to bombs and poison gas.
And there's another mouthful which is designed to
shrivel the Ihinking faculties—"lf war breaks out in
Europe the United States cannot possibly escape par
ticipation." Here the burden of proof rests upon him
who makes such an assertion. And while he is trying
to support his prediction (which can be proved only
by future events), a valuable discussion might be
developed as to why the United States should go in or
stay out, and how it should conduct itself if it really
wanted to remain at peace.

'T'HE student of histox-y derives some comfort from
the fact that during the greatest war the world
has yet known, such weak powers as Switzerland,
Spain, and the Scandinavian states, almost within
sound of the battle roar, maintained their peaceful
status. If the United States goes three thousand miles
over sea to mix in a struggle it has learned nothing
from the experience of those close-up neutrals.
Confucius attached great importance to the correct
use of words, and he spent a lot of time defining the
catchwords which were bandied about in his day. The
historian knows that discussion would proceed more
constructively if such terms as "democracy," "totali
tarian," "aggressor," "pacifist," "isolationist," were
defined before they were tossed about. And he knows
that war is a man-made catastrophe, and that there
can be no war when a will for peace prevails on both
sides. But knowing how unpredictable are the ways
of men he would prepare, by adequate measures,
against a will for war on the part of an enemy or on
the part of our own war-makers. Our armed forces
will defend us against foes abroad, and an enlight
ened public opinion against foes at home. Sabotage in
our sources of information is more dangerous than
sabotage in the turret of a battleship.

that war is a man-made catastrophe, and that there
can be no war when a will for peace prevails on both
sides. But knowing how unpredictable are the ways
of men he would prepare, by adequate measures,
against a will for war on the part of an enemy or on
the part of our own war-makers. Our armed forces
will defend us against foes abroad, and an enlight

sabotage in the turret of a battleship.
r ¥ I HERE are certain compensations these days for the
student of history. He doesn't get the jitters so
easily; he knows that the gift of prophecy has not been
bestowed on man (at least in this generation), so most
of the dire predictions of our Cassandras will never
eventuate; and he fails to be impressed by either the
sweeping generalization or the unqualified assertion.
So many of the arguments which have arisen during
the present long-drawn-out crisis start from assertions
which cannot be established. "If another world war
is fought it will mean the end of Western Civilization"
—a pretty mouthful, but meaning nothing at all. West
em Civilization has been assailed by destructive agen
cies as potent, in their day, as any which the imme
diate future can hold, yet it has never been destroyed.
The recuperative power of a worthwhile civilization
is as marvelous as that of the human body. If West
ern Civilization falls, it will be due more likely to
dry rot and termites than to bombs and poison gas.
And there's another mouthful which is designed to
shrivel the Ihinking faculties—"lf war breaks out in
Europe the United States cannot possibly escape par
ticipation." Here the burden of proof rests upon him
who makes such an assertion. And while he is trying
to support his prediction (which can be proved only
by future events), a valuable discussion might be
developed as to why the United States should go in or
stay out, and how it should conduct itself if it really
wanted to remain at peace.

'T'HE student of histox-y derives some comfort from
the fact that during the greatest war the world
has yet known, such weak powers as Switzerland,
Spain, and the Scandinavian states, almost within
sound of the battle roar, maintained their peaceful
status. If the United States goes three thousand miles
over sea to mix in a struggle it has learned nothing
from the experience of those close-up neutrals.
Confucius attached great importance to the correct
use of words, and he spent a lot of time defining the
