POLITICS
A certain member of Ex Committee was criticiz
ing the Quad Tuesday night on charges of graft and
corruption and appointing editor and business man
ager successors from a certain fraternity whicli was

Quad."
That is not the coincidence. The coincidence is on
page 342 of the Quad. Speaking of the eating club to
which A Certain Member of Ex Committee belongs,
the Quad says:
"(A Certain Club) has played with student govern
ment more than some ..."

ITS THE LAW
It took him a long time before he even got a clue
to where the book might be.
"Try the Felton Library," a librarian told him
after lie had spent several minutes looking for the
book.
He weaved up the steps to the Felton Library. He
broke the hush-hush sanctity of the room asking the
librarian for the book.
Not here, she said.
The book, I mean, she said.
Where is it?
Well, I can get it for you, she said, but you have to
read it here.
She got it from the rare book room and gave it to
him. He found the section he wanted; two pages in
the middle.
The book was very old and very rare, he didn't
doubt. But. the way it was, it was useless. The two
pages he was interested in were uncut.
So he stalled to cut them.
And the librarian looked up. You can't do that,
she shouted.
Why?
It's a rare book.
But the pages are uncut.
It's a rare book.
What good is it if you can't read it?
We save them.
For what?
They are very rare.
He couldn't get around that point. He gave up.
It was a very rare book. She took it back to the
secret place reserved for rare uncut books.
