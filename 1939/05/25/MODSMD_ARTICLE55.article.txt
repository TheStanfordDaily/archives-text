# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHAT TRADITIONS? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Since student-alumni are using
your column to good advantage, per
haps my few remarks would also
make students conscious of the
rules, regulations, speed limits, and
traditions which control our en
vironment. I know that the condi
tions mentioned in the letters are
undoubtedly true, but I shall let
that matter for them to expound
while I review one of Stanford's tra
ditions and its unobservance.
When I first entered Stanford as
an upperclassman I was warned
against smoking on the Quad, oth
erwise I would find my belongings
as well as myself in the bull pen.
After this, not the actual experience
but the warning, I had high regard
for Stanford's No. 1 tradition. The
original source for such a tradition
was not known until later as a
graduate student a Freshman Bible
accidentally came into my posses
sion. In the first few pages I read
the following:
"No Smoking on the Quad: A few
years after the University opened 47
years ago, Mrs. Stanford asked stu
dents not to smoke inside the Quad
rangle or on Ihe arched walks sur
rounding them. For 47 years Stan
ford men and women have respected
her wish."
MRS. STANFORD'S WISH
As Stanford men and women of
the present, there is nothing that
would be easier to do than to com
ply with the wish of the one who
has done so much for us and for
the generations to come. Her re
quest, which has been respected for
nearly half a century, seems to be
slowly passing into oblivion in spite
of the efforts of the administration
and some of the faculty members
ot encourage its observance.
If some departments in the Uni
versity need an illustrious example
to follow, I refer them to the geol
ogy department, where both faculty
members and students join in their
smoking outside.
SMOKERS ATTENTION
The Quad is becoming a rendez
vous for smokers, the majority, I
presume, are unaware of the tradi
tion. Many are undergraduates, lots
of them are graduates, and of
course others are seasoned faculty
members. Since graduates and fac
ulty members wouldn't belittle
themselves by reading the Frosh
Bible, it would be well if the A. S.

|S. U. would provide a "Graduate
i Edition" for the graduates and a "De
, Luxe Edition" for the faculty so
J that they could acquaint themselves
I with the etiquette of their environ
j ment just as freshmen do. The ob
j servance of a tradition cannot be
I enforced, it can only be encour
aged.
In so doing we need more Stan-
I ford-loving men and women who
! are willing to respect Mrs. Stan
ford's "no smoking inside the Quad
! rangle or on the arched walks" re
' quest in appreciation for her sacri
: (ices for us. Let us remember Mrs.
1 Stanford and her wish.
