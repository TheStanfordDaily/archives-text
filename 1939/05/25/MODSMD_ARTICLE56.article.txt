### 
; The Editor, Sir:
"I was a student rn Germany,"
' will be the subject of a discussion,
i sponsored by the A.S.U., in the
j Women's Clubhouse tonight.
I Because there seems to be a lit
tle misunderstanding about this dis
cussion—not debate —I want to ex
i plain a few things. In the first
1 place, I know the speakers person
; ally, and they are both fine and
I honest young people with a high de
! gree of intellectual integrity, though
! they represent entirely different
, ideologies.
j Gertie Landauer is a daughter of
| Dr. Landauer, famous professor of
: economics at the University of Cali
j fornia, who had to leave Germany as
! a refugee because of race and mem
! bership in the Socialist party. She
I is a junior in philosophy at Cal,
! where she has been very active in
J social work, especially refugee re
; lief work; almost single-handed she
I brought five full scholarships to
' gether for refugee students.
1 I met Gertie for the first time last
| year at Asilomar, where she made a
I very strong impression upon every
! body through her speeches and

personal conversations. She i.s an
all-around swell girl and of course
she is very well informed because of
the background and the contacts she
has now.
Adolf Bode i.s one of my best
friends here on the campus, al
though we do not agree many times.
He came" to America a year ago "to
study American literature, and not
to practice propaganda," as he em
phatically states. He will not speak
as a "Nazi"—in fact, he only belongs
to the Hitler Jugend and not to the
party—but as one student to the
other, just as Gertie is going to talk:
informally. Adolf will give his per
sonal opinions, which do not need to
be the offiical party opinions.
Adolf and I proved that you can
be very good friends, although po
litically far apart. We stand for
different ideas and yet we want to
bring the youth not only of Europe
but of the entire world together.
We believe in peaceful discussion
and in a noncoercive world organi
zation. That's why we have this
meeting.
It's going to be as complete and
objective as possible: Gertie presents
her view, Adolf his opinions, both
will discuss personal experiences,
and you are free to ask any ques
tion you feel like afterwards.
International understanding is
needed now more than anything
else. We will have to consider our
respective countries as compli
mentary parts of a single world, in
which we all will have to get along
with each other. We will have to
do away with many international
prejudices and pet hatreds. And
"we" means the youth of all coun
tries and races. Youth has never
been more conscious of its possibili
ties and of its exploiters than we
ai*e now. So let's make use of our

knowledge!
The A.S.U. invites all of you to
hear these two German students,
one ol which cannot return to her
home country. They will talk as
friends, frankly and possibly sharp
ly. And they will hammer into your
minds the conviction that it is up
to youth to act now, to forget the
artificial borders and unite as the
strongest international lorce lor
world peace. This meeting will
make you feel also that il we don't
exactly love each other, we at least
have to respect each other's integ
rity.

"I was a student rn Germany,"
' will be the subject of a discussion,

j Women's Clubhouse tonight.
I Because there seems to be a lit
tle misunderstanding about this dis
cussion—not debate —I want to ex
i plain a few things. In the first
1 place, I know the speakers person
; ally, and they are both fine and
I honest young people with a high de
! gree of intellectual integrity, though
! they represent entirely different
, ideologies.
j Gertie Landauer is a daughter of
| Dr. Landauer, famous professor of
: economics at the University of Cali
j fornia, who had to leave Germany as
! a refugee because of race and mem
! bership in the Socialist party. She
I is a junior in philosophy at Cal,
! where she has been very active in
J social work, especially refugee re
; lief work; almost single-handed she
I brought five full scholarships to
' gether for refugee students.
1 I met Gertie for the first time last
| year at Asilomar, where she made a
I very strong impression upon every
! body through her speeches and

personal conversations. She i.s an
all-around swell girl and of course
she is very well informed because of
the background and the contacts she
has now.
Adolf Bode i.s one of my best
friends here on the campus, al
though we do not agree many times.
He came" to America a year ago "to
study American literature, and not
to practice propaganda," as he em
phatically states. He will not speak
as a "Nazi"—in fact, he only belongs
to the Hitler Jugend and not to the
party—but as one student to the
other, just as Gertie is going to talk:
informally. Adolf will give his per
sonal opinions, which do not need to
be the offiical party opinions.
Adolf and I proved that you can
be very good friends, although po
litically far apart. We stand for
different ideas and yet we want to
bring the youth not only of Europe
but of the entire world together.
We believe in peaceful discussion
and in a noncoercive world organi
zation. That's why we have this
meeting.
It's going to be as complete and
objective as possible: Gertie presents
her view, Adolf his opinions, both
will discuss personal experiences,
and you are free to ask any ques
tion you feel like afterwards.
International understanding is
needed now more than anything
else. We will have to consider our
respective countries as compli
mentary parts of a single world, in
which we all will have to get along
with each other. We will have to
do away with many international
prejudices and pet hatreds. And
"we" means the youth of all coun
tries and races. Youth has never
been more conscious of its possibili
ties and of its exploiters than we
ai*e now. So let's make use of our

knowledge!
The A.S.U. invites all of you to
