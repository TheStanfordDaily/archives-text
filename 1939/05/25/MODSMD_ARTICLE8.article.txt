# Publications Reapprove Quad Staff
## 
### 
Publications Council, asked yes
terday by Ex Committee to recon
sider its approval of appointments
to positions on the 1940 Quad, yes
terday afternoon again approved
staff appointments as made by Edi
tor Frank Lippmann and Business
Manager Margaret Hale.
At the same time, the Council
passed a resolution suggesting to Ex
Committee that a committee be ap
pointed next year to work with
Publications Council and investigate
the system of Quad appointments.
Consensus of Publications Council
members was that appointment of
the best people for the jobs has been
made this year, despite the fact that
both are from one fraternity.
This answer will reply to Ex Com
mittee's contention Tuesday night,
that a hierarchy has been formed by
one house on both the business and
editorial staffs.
Interpretation by the Council of
Ex Committee's action was that "the
committee felt that the system,
rather than this year's appointments,
is wrong." For this reason, the sug
gestion was passed in the form of a
resolution to accompany a re-sub
mission of the Quad appointment
list at next week's Ex Committee
meeting.
