### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
"JF YOU want to know who we are,
We are the gentlemen of Japan"
sings the opening chorus of Gilbert
and Sullivan's "Mikado," snapping
shut its fans to underline the state
ment.
In a manner just as blunt, but a
trifle less musical, Japan announced
yesterday that she is blockading the
coast of China and will halt and
search all foreign vessels to make
sure they are carrying no cargo des
tined to help the Chinese cause.
Explaining, but in no sense at
tempting to excuse this week's
l>oarding of the British liner Itan
pura and the French Aramis, Nip
ponese naval authorities proclaim
ed their intention of stopping all
foreign ships, regardless of neu
trality rights or international law.

r I I HESE are harsh words, even for
the Orient's nearly-fascist pow
er. Back of them lie broad hints
that British, French, and American
ships have indirectly been aiding
China by sending her shipments of
vital supplies. That this is the privi
lege of the neutral western nations
seems not to impress Japan; she is
determined to attempt to starve the
mainland into submission.
Now the reason for the Empire's
designs on the Arnoy international
settlement is apparent, the why and
wherefore of its house-to-house
searches for Chinese sympathizers
have come to the surface. Failing to
gain control of this center of foreign
commerce, the Japanese now are
trying another means of stopping
the flow of western trade to China.

When the songs of the rising
sun interfere with France and
England's commerce, they are
playing A dangerous game. Money
is the life-blood of the West, and
cutting off Oriental trade is like
amputating a finger. This week's
incidents will result in diplomatic
notes, and they, in turn, may lead
to trouble.
To date, no American vessel has
been challenged, but a number of
them are sailing within the block
ade line at present. If a U.S. ship
is searched, and there is little reason
to think this will not happen, our
government would be forced to pro
test. And visions of the Panay inci
dent, of American marines in Shang
hai arise to frighten us.

THE Nazis had a tough day yes
terday. On both coasts of the
United States her pride was sadly
dented. While German and Aus
rian refugees celebrated their free
dom with an elaborate production
of Schiller's "William Tell" in Holly
wood, Fritz Kuhn, America's num
ber one Hitlerite, was arrested in
New York on charges of grand lar
ceny and forgery.
Far more distressing to the dis
tant Fuehrer than these events
was Russia's 30 per cent increase
in its annual defense budget,
liaising the appropriatoin to 31 bil
lion dollars, the supreme soviet
gave Germany added reason to
fear the almost-completed Triple
Entente.

With the foreign ministers and am
bassadors of Britain and the U. S.
S. P. giving the mutual aggression
pact the go signal, all that remains
to seal it is the approval of these
nations' representative bodies. Im
mediately upon conclusion of the al
liance the heads of both military
staffs will join in conferences of
strategy.
Although England has guaranteed
Russia armed aid against any Eu
ropean invader, she has remained
.significantly silent on the subject of
interference in case of a Japanese
attack. Whether this problem will
have to be settled before the alli
ance becomes final is still an un
known quantity.
At all costs it. is known that
France. Britain, and Russia will be
pledged to support one another if
any of them, or any nation whose
integrity they arc protecting, falls
victim to aggression.
