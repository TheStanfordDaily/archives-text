Coast School for Workers, will be the speakers at Stanford's second Stu
dent Workers' Conference of the year Sunday from 2:30 ot 5 o'clock in
the basement of the Women's Clubhouse.

The conference is being held foH
the purpose of explaining the aims
and mechanism of the Pacific Coast
Workers' School to interested stu
dents. At present there are five
scholarships available.
HELD IN BERKELEY
To be held in Berkeley from June
24 to July 22, the school's purpose
is to "provide opportunities for
workers to study the social and
economic problems of present-day
society, to train themselves in clear
thinking and adequate expression,
and to develop a desire for study as
a means to the understanding and
enjoyment of life."
Last year the student body con
sisted of approximately 84 students.
Of these 14 were college students,
and the rest workers, about half of
which were affiliated with the A. F.
of L. and C.1.0. The group repre
sented all fields of endeavor from
unemployed migrants and unskilled
laborers up to the so-called "white
collar" labor workers â€” Retail
Clerks, United Automobile Workers,
International Lady Garment Work
ers, household employees, and sail
ors and longshoremen. Ages range
from 15 to 74 years.
PAID SCHOLARSHIPS
For each college student who is
admitted to the school there must
be a paid scholarship provided for
a worker from some interested
group on his campus. The five
scholarships from the Farm have
been provided through the work of
representatives to a Student-Faculty
Committee. Students are represented
by one delegate each from Roble,
Lagunita, Union, Panhellcnic, Wom
en's Conference, Intcrclub Council

Sequoia, and Encina. Faculty spon
sors include Drs. William S. Hopkins
and Phillip W. Buck, and Miss Fran
ces Terrell, who represents Miss
Mary Yost's office.
The main function of university
students at the school is observation,
since the school exists mainly for
the workers whose problems are
considered in detail. However, those
students admitted are expected to
tutor individuals or small groups in
subjects in which they have special
training or information, and to aid
the worker students in learning the
full use of libraries.
