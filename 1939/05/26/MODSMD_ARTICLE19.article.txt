# Ram's Head Anticipates Farm Audience Approval For Fourth Spring Show
## Smooth Plot, Riotous Gag Scenes Combine to Make Wake Up-Bent of Campus Musical Comedies 
### JOHN FLAHERTY 
It look tliem four years of Spring Show-in# to do it, but Rain's Head
lias hit the jackpot with "Y\ake Up and Leave." When audiences tonight
and tomorrow night feed their money into the Memorial Hall machine,
the wheels should spin until the three golden eagles roll up.
The four men who turned out the script had their eyes open for gag

scenes and lines perhaps more than
for straight plot. But for the most
part the tale runs along smoothly
enough to string together some of
Ihe funniest, scenes ever to knock
about on the gigantic Hall stage.
Somewhere I hey dug up a new gag
book and pulled out some lines
which pack the show with guffaws.

The cast is full of Ram's Head
stars—Gerry Schreibor, a charming
and skillful comedienne, Virginia
Sharpe, Shirley Jones, Jack Daw
son, Barbara Thrasher, Marco
Thorne—all of them at their best.
New faces enliven the show; a
notable find is Bob Stephens, actor,
and singer; Eloise Lambert, the oth
er singing lead; Charley Bulotti and
Harry Muheim, co-authors working
in their own show. A lot of others
move in and out with almost be
wildering rapidity.
All of the scenes show the splen
did direction of J. P. Cahn, with
smooth work on crowded stages.
Several scenes arc outstanding: the
Towers Daily bit, with Marco Thorne
as the Night Editor, and Sherm Mel
linkoff's song; the garden scene; the
telephone conversation; jitterbug
number.
McCUE'S MUSIC
Music for the show is handled
again by Art McCue's competent
16-piece organization.
Last night, Cahn called for a song
to be raised three keys. The band
casually marked the change on their
scores, and played it through imme
diately in the new key.
Musical Director Bimbaum is
tearing his hair over arrangements,
but lie has whipped the 18 musical
numbers into professional shape.
On the whole, the music is equal
to that of former shows, although
the large number of "patter" tunes
keeps the straight ballad-style
pieces down to a small number.
Audiences will be able to hear the
music. After crawling in and out
of obscure corners in the Hall t/>
investigate the public address set
up, Ram's Head guarantees the sys
tem will work.
Unless something drastic has hap
pened between last night and to
night, "Wake Up and Leave" will
click with the Farm tonight.

keeps the straight ballad-style
pieces down to a small number.
Audiences will be able to hear the
music. After crawling in and out
of obscure corners in the Hall t/>
investigate the public address set
up, Ram's Head guarantees the sys
tem will work.
Unless something drastic has hap
pened between last night and to
night, "Wake Up and Leave" will
click with the Farm tonight.
It look tliem four years of Spring Show-in# to do it, but Rain's Head
lias hit the jackpot with "Y\ake Up and Leave." When audiences tonight
and tomorrow night feed their money into the Memorial Hall machine,
the wheels should spin until the three golden eagles roll up.
The four men who turned out the script had their eyes open for gag

scenes and lines perhaps more than
for straight plot. But for the most
part the tale runs along smoothly
enough to string together some of
Ihe funniest, scenes ever to knock
about on the gigantic Hall stage.
Somewhere I hey dug up a new gag
book and pulled out some lines
which pack the show with guffaws.

The cast is full of Ram's Head
stars—Gerry Schreibor, a charming
and skillful comedienne, Virginia
Sharpe, Shirley Jones, Jack Daw
son, Barbara Thrasher, Marco
Thorne—all of them at their best.
New faces enliven the show; a
notable find is Bob Stephens, actor,
and singer; Eloise Lambert, the oth
er singing lead; Charley Bulotti and
Harry Muheim, co-authors working
in their own show. A lot of others
move in and out with almost be
wildering rapidity.
All of the scenes show the splen
did direction of J. P. Cahn, with
smooth work on crowded stages.
Several scenes arc outstanding: the
Towers Daily bit, with Marco Thorne
as the Night Editor, and Sherm Mel
linkoff's song; the garden scene; the
telephone conversation; jitterbug
number.
McCUE'S MUSIC
Music for the show is handled
again by Art McCue's competent
16-piece organization.
Last night, Cahn called for a song
to be raised three keys. The band
casually marked the change on their
scores, and played it through imme
diately in the new key.
Musical Director Bimbaum is
tearing his hair over arrangements,
but lie has whipped the 18 musical
numbers into professional shape.
On the whole, the music is equal
to that of former shows, although
the large number of "patter" tunes
keeps the straight ballad-style
pieces down to a small number.
