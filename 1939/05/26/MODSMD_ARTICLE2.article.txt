# Diver Kills Hopes For Squalus' Men
## Aft Torpedo Room Found Flooded; 26 Coffins Arrive 
### 
PORTSMOUTH, N.H., May 25
(UP). â€”A navy diver peered into
the sunken hulk of the submarine
U.S.S. 'Squalus tonight, and sent up
word which dimmed a flickering
hope that some of the 26 men still
trapped in the submarine might be
alive.
The diver reported he found the
aft torpedo room of the Squalus
flooded. It was this room which an
expert as Lieut. Comdr. Edward
Ellsberg, U.S.N.R., who participated
in salvage of the S-51, had said of
fered the best chance of remaining
comparatively dry, since it was the
farthest from the induction valve
through which the water entered.
Soon after this discovery it was
learned that Rear Admiral Cyrus W.
Cole, commandant of the Ports
mouth Navy Yard, had ordered 26
coffins sent to the yard.
Two divers went down to the
Squalus in the repaired diving bell
which had brought 33 men to the
surface during last night and early
today.
The bell was made fast to the aft
torpedo room escape hatch. Then
the hatch was opened and water
gushed from the submarine. A diver
peered in on the off chance that
there might be an air pocket in
which a man could live. He found
the compartment completely flooded
The hatch was closed once more.
