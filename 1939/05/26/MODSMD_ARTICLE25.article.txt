studying some phase of secretarial work, Vocational Committee has as
sembled complete information on representative business schools located

field. On the contrary, she adds that*
it is one of the best vocational step
ping stones.
RATES AVAILABLE
Among the information available
in Miss Doyle's office in the Admin
istration Building is a compilation
of rates of the various schools lo

average approximately three months
longer than the stenographic and in
cludes courses in spelling, grammar,

more extensive and many of the
schools are the boarding school type.

higher, averaging $800 to $1000 per
year. Day students are charged $200
to $500 per year.
