# U.S. to Probe Tax Evasion In California
## Atty. Gen. Murphy Discloses Moves To Break Overlords 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May 25 (UP).â€”
Atty. Gen. Frank Murphy, making u
whirlwind tour oi' California, today
revealed that the Federal Govern
ment plans to uproot municipal cor
ruption by prosecution of income
tax evaders.
He disclosed his plans "to break
the rule of the overlords of the
underworld" shortly after he had
appeared before the local Federal
Grand Jury, which indicted two of
ficials of the 50-million-dollar Pa
cific States Savings & Loan Co.
ODELL CHARGED
The indictment charged Robert S.
Odell, ousted president, and Ger
ald R. White, vice-president, with
destroying and concealing records of
the company's properties which
would have proved the company in
solvent.
The Federal Grand Jury met in
a special night session last night,
apparently at the request of Mr.
Murphy, following his arrival here
with Director J. Edgar Hoover of
ihe Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The indictments apparently re
sulted from involuntary bankruptcy
proceedings filed against the firm
a week ago by a group of creditors.
CASE REJECTED
The bankruptcy case was rejected
by Federal Judge Leon R. Yankwich
on the technical ground that the
company's principal place of busi
ness was not in this judicial district.
The indictment charged that fol
lowing the filing of the bankruptcy
petition, the defendants destroyed
records and documents of the com
pany.
Mr. Murphy disclosed his next
major objective was to clean up
municipal corruption through the
use of the income tax laws.
