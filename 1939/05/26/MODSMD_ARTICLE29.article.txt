# Falcon Training Quarters Set Up In Encina Bull Pen
## 
### BUD AMES 
"We can't hear a thing you say |
because of these squawking fal- !
cons," Tom Polhemus and Telford j
Work, the Daily bank boy, chorused i
together in order to make them- J
selves heard above the bleatings of I
two American Kestrel — sparrow!
hawks to you. Work tossed each bird !
a hunk of raw beef and only then
did anything resembling silence j
settle about the room.
"Historically speaking, we stole j
these two hawks out of a nest of ■
five last April 2(5." Work explained.
"At that time they had lost most of |
their down but they had no powers |
of flight. Then we began training j
them to respond to a whistle. You [
see, we hold a piece of beef in our j
hand, and then whistle. The falcons j
get to associate the whistle with '
food." , j
PROGRESS DESCRIBED
Polhemus nodded his head and
supplemented Work's statements by i
explaining that, the falcons soon |
learned to run across the floor and
then hop into the hand that was
holding the bit of meat. Gradually
hopping was replaced by actual,
swilt flight, and with flight came in- i
telligence.
Work, who collects bird eggs and
studies bird types in his spare time,
could not refrain from bubbling
forth a chant of bird-book facts.
"These hawks never get any
larger than a large robin," he said,
"and they feed on small rodents,
grass hoppers, and small birds such
as the sparrow."
"Yeah," Polhemus butted in. "My
big hope is to take this pair up to
San Francisco and sic 'em on the
sparrows in Union Square. They
would really clean up."
RELATIVE MERITS
In the background, Work contin
ued to rant on concerning the rela
tive merits of the two birds.
"Diablo, the bigger bird, decided
to fly the coop the other day so he
flew out the window and over onto
a branch of the Encina roof. We

whistled but he didn't return. It i
wasn't until 7 o'clock that Diablo
lit on A1 Horn's window sill and |
scared him half to death. We finally !
got him back in the cage."
In response to a request for a :
demonstration of the abilities of the
two falcons, the owners took one
hawk into the hall and around the
far corner out of sight. Polhemus
returned in a minute, blew a queer
blast on a dime-store whistle. From
out of the dusk of the hall a bird
swished, then alighted on Polhemus'
outstretched hand. Again the pro
cedure was repeated and again the j
bird fiew direct to the hand at the I
sound of the whistle.
"That is all the farthest we have
gotten with the training," admitted
Work, "but tomorrow we are going
to begin using an imitation lure re- I
sembling a mouse or bird. In that j
way we " He was too late to
complete his sentence for the birds !

Polhemus shouted; but the falcons
shouted louder.

cons," Tom Polhemus and Telford j

hawks to you. Work tossed each bird !
a hunk of raw beef and only then
did anything resembling silence j
settle about the room.
"Historically speaking, we stole j
these two hawks out of a nest of ■
five last April 2(5." Work explained.
"At that time they had lost most of |
their down but they had no powers |
of flight. Then we began training j
them to respond to a whistle. You [
see, we hold a piece of beef in our j
hand, and then whistle. The falcons j
get to associate the whistle with '
food." , j
PROGRESS DESCRIBED
Polhemus nodded his head and
supplemented Work's statements by i
explaining that, the falcons soon |
learned to run across the floor and
then hop into the hand that was
holding the bit of meat. Gradually
hopping was replaced by actual,
swilt flight, and with flight came in- i
telligence.
Work, who collects bird eggs and
studies bird types in his spare time,
could not refrain from bubbling
forth a chant of bird-book facts.
"These hawks never get any
larger than a large robin," he said,
"and they feed on small rodents,
grass hoppers, and small birds such
as the sparrow."
"Yeah," Polhemus butted in. "My
big hope is to take this pair up to
San Francisco and sic 'em on the
sparrows in Union Square. They
would really clean up."
RELATIVE MERITS
In the background, Work contin
ued to rant on concerning the rela
tive merits of the two birds.
"Diablo, the bigger bird, decided
to fly the coop the other day so he
flew out the window and over onto
a branch of the Encina roof. We

whistled but he didn't return. It i
wasn't until 7 o'clock that Diablo
lit on A1 Horn's window sill and |
scared him half to death. We finally !
got him back in the cage."
In response to a request for a :
demonstration of the abilities of the
two falcons, the owners took one
hawk into the hall and around the
far corner out of sight. Polhemus
returned in a minute, blew a queer
blast on a dime-store whistle. From
out of the dusk of the hall a bird
swished, then alighted on Polhemus'
outstretched hand. Again the pro
cedure was repeated and again the j
bird fiew direct to the hand at the I
sound of the whistle.
"That is all the farthest we have
