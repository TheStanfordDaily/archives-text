# Remaining Quads Selling
## Only 30 Books Left, Reports Manager 
### 
Four days after the 1939 Stanford ,
Quad made its appearance on the
Farm last Monday, only 30 unor
dered yearbooks remain unsold, re
ported Margaret Hale.
Past records show that such a
rapid sell-out is almost unprece
dented in Quad history. Only 11 of
the 30 Quads are available on cam
pus this week, with the remaining
19 arriving on May 30 with the last i
delivery of name-on-cover books. I
Sale through the mails is expect- j
ed to diminish the small number of j
Quads considerably, so that imme- i
diate purchase is imperative, Miss j
Hale said. j
Total sale of Quads is already i
over that of last year, since 100 more
copies were printed than in 1938.
Sales will continue today and to
morrow in the afternoon until the
11 books available are sold, and will
begin again on the 31st until all
books are gone.
Although sale of duplicate pic
tures of every Quad photograph has
proceeded rapidly, Editor Frank
Lippman reported that a large num- '
ber of candid, as well as sports pic
tures were left. Price range of the
pictures is from 10 cents up.
