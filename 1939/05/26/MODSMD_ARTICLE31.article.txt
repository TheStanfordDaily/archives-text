# Deinum Elected A.S.U. President
## 
### 
Preceding discussion of the Nazi
regime, A.S.U. members last night
elected Andries Deinum, Dutch stu
dent, as president for the coming
year. Bob Low. Frances Slater and
Bill Simonds received positions of
vice-president, secretary, and treas
urer, respectively.
The discussion got under way with
a pointed talk, "I Was a Student in
Germany,'' delivered by Adolph
Bode, German exchange student.
Keynote of Bode's speech, which fol
lowed the rise of the Hitler regime
from a democratic Germany to a
totalitarian state, centered about im
mediate and drastic action on the
part of all intelligent youth as die
strongest international force work
ing for world peace.

Following a similar tone and
theme, Gertie Landauer, German
refugee student at present attending
California, supplemented Bode's dis
cussion, at the same time pointing
toward a mutual respect of the in
tegrity of the youth of all nations.
Climax of the evening's activities
came with a question and answer
discussion between the two speakers
and attending audience, questions
which centered chiefly around the
youth movement in the present-day
Germany.
Expressing pleasure over the larg
est turnout during the year, newly
elected President Deinum gave
"closer co-operation with A.S.U. so
cieties in other California colleges"
as the object of next fall's activities.
