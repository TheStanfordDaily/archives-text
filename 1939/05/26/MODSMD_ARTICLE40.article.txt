1 PROVING THAT all the charges
of professionalism and athletic sub
: terfuge in. the Pacific Coast confer
ence is not restricted to the Calil'or
; nia schools, two Northwest student
1 papers have just divulged that How
; ard Hobson, Oregon's successful
! basketball and baseball coach, is an
i employee of the New York Yankees
baseball club.
We adopted southerners had come
I to look upon ourselves as the worst
j offenders in matters of above
board athletic policy, but now we
! are finally beginning to see that no
I school is much of a superior to any
other. When we think of dastardly
athletic plots, we invariably turn to
U.S.C., St. Mary's, or some other
I Golden State institution. More often
j than not our stories are a little wild.
But we never even think of the
; damyankees pulling the same tactics
! while we are busy riddling one an
! other down here with counter
j charge bullets.

Of course, many of the stories
about the Terrible Trojans and the
Mad Magician of Moraga are often
products of our fertile if not accu
rate imaginations. It's funny how
we had come to look on our
northern neighbors as just hum
ble, struggling infants who were
getting a bum deal from the con
ference deck. Never again will
j we be inveigled into stringing
i along with pure amateurism. There
1 ain't no such animal. Nor should
there be one. The only thing that
hurts us is that some of the
schools, in which professionalism
! is extremely rampant, have spent
all their time screaming to the
public press about the injustice of
J it all.
i Hobson, an able leader on a bet
! ter than starvation wage scale, now
joins the ranks of a select few of
i the California gentlemen in an of
ficial capacity. We're just wondering
now what others of the coaching
gentry are finding that one salary is

[ insufficient for the fun they get out
! of being kids all their lives.
Hobson has admitted his servi
: tude and hasn't even denied the fact
; that, as a minor part of the Yank
| farm system, he is getting some-
I where in the neighborhood of 200
| simoleans a month, better than
ditch - digging, any way you look at
; it. And with guys like Joe and Jack
Gordon in your back-yard, the split
| oil bonuses for exceptional services
' rendered ought to sweeten the kitty
just that much more.
It's getting to the point now
where the coaches are getting so
many connections that they # will
soon be forming themselves into
I corporations to handle their many
affairs. Just imagine: "(ins Men
tor, Inc. — Coaching, Proselyting,
and Contract Service. Able-bodied
Baseball and Football Players Our
Specialty."

Don't get the idea that this is any
; treatise on the evils at Oregon—or
anywhere else. It just doesn't seem
right for a coach of any school ox
university paying a living wage
(and there are few in the confer-
I ence that do not) to spend his spare
j moments figuring out markets for
j his prize specimens.
If he wants to be a coach, let him
j be a coach and take the bitter and
J sweet that goes with it. If he wants
to go in for professional scouting
work, then let him make that his
sole field.
After all, we are reputed to be
educational institutions, not training
schools for any professional agency.
