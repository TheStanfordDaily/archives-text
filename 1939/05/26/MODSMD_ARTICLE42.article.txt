### 
Alpha Delt's intramural swimmers
took one big step yesterday in de
fense of their title when they led
the field of qualifiers by a large
margin. The defending champs
placed a total of eight men in the
trials of the five races that were
run off.
Next in line came the Betas with
four mermen, then Kappa Sigma and
Japanese Club with three each. But
the three places taken by the Japa
nese Club looked the biggest of all,
for all of them were first places in
the three free-style races taken by
speedy Pete Okumoto.
Okumoto took the 50-yard free
style in 24.6, the 100-yard dash in
57.3, and the 150 in 1:44, and in every
case was well ahead of the field.
Dave Nottage, Alpha Delt star,
paced the breast-strokers to be lead
ing qualifier with a mark of 52.7 in
the 75-yard race.
