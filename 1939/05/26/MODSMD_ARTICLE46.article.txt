TO tie in with what has been said regarding
the changing status of social regulations and
life at Stanford, it is only fair to present the
other side to a picture which seems all one
color.
That the picture is not all black or all white
will have to be admitted after a brief considera
tion of the factors involved.
First objection to permitting dance commit
tees to arrange floor shows, movie queens, and
like attractions is that they may go beyond the
bounds i of sensibility and decency. It has hap
pened —and at Stanford.
A few years ago, it happened once too often.
Faculty wives, as patronesses, objected and
handed down the ultimatum that they could
not act as patronesses if the practice was to
continue.
Without patronesses, there would have been
no dances.
Students, not wishing to discontinue all cam
pus dances, urged that they be dances only—
without objectionable entertainment.
This suggestion was acceptable to all con
cerned and was put into effect.
This year, when the idea of the floor show
and the movie queen came up, the administra
tion clamped down for the reason that it did
not feel that any student committee would or
could assume responsibility for the actions and
programs of the entertainers involved.
That is a summary of the official view of the
situation.
The undergraduate student body, on the
other hand, feels that it is competent to pick
entertainment that does not fall under the
classification adopted by the administration.
Apparently, dances plus entertainment have
more appeal than just dances.
In regard to the whole situation, everyone
seems fairly well agreed that it is a wise thing
to discourage off-campus dances and that on
campus affairs can offer as much in the way of
social enjoyability as affairs elsewhere.
But students feel that if they are to give up
some of their off-campus affairs they should
have freer rein in planning their on-campus
entertainment.
Somewhere in between there is doubtless a
middle ground that would be an advantageous
position for both sides to occupy.
If somebody can only find it.
And if both parties will forget they have been
at odds and work together.

Apparently, dances plus entertainment have
more appeal than just dances.
In regard to the whole situation, everyone
seems fairly well agreed that it is a wise thing
to discourage off-campus dances and that on
campus affairs can offer as much in the way of
social enjoyability as affairs elsewhere.
But students feel that if they are to give up
some of their off-campus affairs they should
have freer rein in planning their on-campus
entertainment.
Somewhere in between there is doubtless a
middle ground that would be an advantageous
position for both sides to occupy.
If somebody can only find it.
And if both parties will forget they have been
at odds and work together.
