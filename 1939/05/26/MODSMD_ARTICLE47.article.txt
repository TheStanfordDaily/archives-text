STUDENT - WRITTEN, student - produced, stu
dent - acted, tonight and tomorrow night
Stanford will see its fourth, and perhaps its last,
Spring Show.
Since the new Division of Speech and
Drama has moved into Memorial Hall and
spouted plays until the campus has almost
reached the saturation point, student produc
tions consistently have become fewer and far
ther between. Because of what Ram's Head
terms administration indifference, the Spring
Show may be abandoned next year.
However, this is a problem to be discussed
and settled next year. Tonight, regardless of
threats to the custom, Ram's Head is producing
another show, one that promises to land at the
top of its list of successful musical comedies.
"Wake Up and Leave" takes place at Ivory
Towers University, and Ivory Towers is Stan
ford. It holds up a mirror to give committee
men, fraternity men, and letter men a slightly
sour view of what they look like.
The satire is sharp and clever. Music, acting,
and direction have been given a Phi Bete rating
by previewers.
Student productions of this kind give the
training that results in post-graduate jobs on
Broadway and in Hollywood.
As long as it produces designers, directors,
actors, and technicians, as long as it gives un
dergraduates a chance to bear a major respon
sibility, the Spring Show is a valuable insti
tution.
Tonight Ram's Head is going to lampoon Stan
ford, a job that should have been started long
ago.â€”L. L.
