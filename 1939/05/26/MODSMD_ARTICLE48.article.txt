### H. B. "BEEB" LEE President, Associated Students 
PRESENT. FUTURE AND PAST
IN RECENTLY thumbing through the copies of Inst
year's Daily, my eyes fell upon an article in the
"30" edition by Tom Killefer, then retiring A.SS.U.
President. This article proved interesting to me from
several standpoints. Some of them, I believe, are
worth mentioning. First of all, Tom pointed out that
our student government is "in no wise perfect, but
that it compares more than favorably with the stu
dent government at other colleges and universities."
The first contention is rather obvious, but the latter
conviction, for those who are unaware of Stanford's
top-notch position on the ladder of student govern
ment, bears repetition.
We cannot claim to be leaders in every department
of the game, but as your representative at the na
tional and two regional conventions of student presi
dents, I found that consistently we had met and
solved problems that were yet to be recognized by
other colleges. At the same time I learned to appre
ciate more than ever an Administration which has so
freely delegated to student government the responsi
bility of student control and discipline that usually
falls under varying degrees of faculty domination in
other similar institutions. To me, these findings were
indicative of a progressive type of leadership of which
Stanford can well be proud.

'"POM went on to suggest "that some sort of board or
agency for co-ordinating activities, distributing
committee appointments, and operating the new activ
ity files is badly needed." Such foresight was idealized
this year by Ex Committee's creation of an office known
as the "Activities Co-ordinator."
Set up to make student government more demo
cratic, this office can well anticipate trouble in its
first year as an advisory board for committee appoint
ments. And I should like to warn next year's officers
not to expect this group, in its infancy, to completely
solve the numerous problems for which it has been
created. It, no doubt, will suffer repeated set-backs,
and if we lose sight of what such a body, when its
many imperfections have been ironed out by the
passing of time, can mean to future student govei'n
ment, it is liable to be discarded.
Before I bow out I should like to leave just one
idea. Take it for what it's worthâ€”l like it.

A COUPLE of years ago, I stumbled upon a section
of the Reserve Book Room in the Libe which
shelved a number of books concerned with the romance
of Stanford Univeristy and its founders. Never had I
read a more exciting history, and I came to wonder
if there was any way in which this story of Stanford
could be presented to the freshman class. It seemed to
me that a common knowledge of the background of
this great institution would go a long way in instilling
an honest-to-goodness Stanford Spirit.
If you are with me on the idea, what do you think
of this as an approach? Conduct a one unit, plus
minus course with lectures once a week during the
Spring Quarter. Have attendance be the sole basis
of grading. Call upon outstanding men, not necessarily
lecturing professors, but men who have been intimately
connected with certain phases of Stanford's history and
men who are capable of passing on, first hand, the
era of romance in which they took part.
It seems to me that such information would be vital
to new students if they are enthusiastically to join the
so-called "Stanford Family." It would point out to
them numerous offerings of this institution which most
graduating seniors now never x-ealized existed.
Of course, you always have to face the stigma at
tached to any required course. However, the charac
ter of the subject matter and the personnel of the
speaking staff when such men as Herbert Hoover, Dr.
Wilbur, Almon Roth. Edgar Robinson, and others
could be invited to talk would far offset this stigma.
Anyway, it might be worth considering.
In closing, I should like to congratulate you on
your choice of Ken Cuthbertson and Coline Upshaw
as your leaders for next year. You have chosen two
outstanding personalities blessed with sound judgment
and real leadership ability. I should like to take 1 his
opportunity to wish, these two the best of luck for
the coming year.
