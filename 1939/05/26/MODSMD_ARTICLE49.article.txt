By now there are 70 young men and women on
this campus who are beginning to realize what has
happened to them.
The new Phi Betes are beginning to lose that Santa-
Claus-comes-in-the-Spring feeling, and are seeing
what they have been let in for.
One by one it is coming to them. They have repu
tations to live up to.
They tell the story about the professor who con
gratulated a new Phi Beteâ€”and at the same time
handed him back an ex.
He had flunked the ex.

His fraternity brothers put a bod on the porch of
the Theta house a couple of nights ago, and then put
him to bed nnd tied him up, and left him ihere.
He was wound up on the Theta front porch.
There undoubtedly have been many young men
wound up on the Theta front porch.
And tied up. It is probably the first time any guy
was tied up on the front porch of the Theta house
by someone other than a Theta.
And it is undoubtedly the first time anyone in
that situation lias been freed by a Theta from being
tied up.

When the track team was in Seattle, they were
coming down en masse in the elevator from the top
floor of a 15-story building. The elevator stopped at;
the 11th floor, and the governor of Washington stepped
in.
One of the team recognized the governor and greet
ed him.
"I would like you to meet the Stanford track team,"
he said.
Now Clyde Jeffrey, they say, is a very quiet, mod
est young man not given to throwing his weight
around and making himself conspicuous. But when
his friend said that that man was the governor of
Washington, lie said to himself, they can't pull that
J stuff on me. That guy's no governor. That's some jani-
I tor on his day off.
So Jeffrey stepped up to the governor, clapped
him on the back and said, "Hi ya. Gov old boy. How's
tricks?" or something equally inappropriate. He bur
j lesqued his greeting to the governor to about the third
! floor.
And then turned a pretty purple when he learned
that it had been the governor after all.
He doesn't even like to think about it.
