REGINA, Sask, May 25 (UP).—
Wheat country farmers tonight
hailed "George the Rainmaker."
King George VI came to the wheat
capital of Canada today and with
him came rain, just as it had yester
day when he and Queen Elizabeth
visited Winnipeg.
For weeks there had been no
heavy rains, so necessary for a
bountiful yield. Farmers feared their
crops soon might be blighted by
drought.
But today—just as Their Majes
ties stepped from the royal stream
liner carrying them on their Domin
ion tour —it poured. Cheering thou
sands, many of them farmers who
had come from remote sections of
Saskatchewan's broad wheat belt,
promptly nicknamed their King
"George the Rainmaker."
Their Majesties sensed immediate
ly that, the rain Was a good omen
for the wheat crop—symbolized by
sheaves bound to center poles of the
streets. They smiled and waved as
they rode through the streets in an
open car.
After a visit to the city hall, the
royal procession moved on to the
legislative buildings where the
speaker of the legislative assembly
greeted the King and Queen on be
half of the people of Saskatchewan.
