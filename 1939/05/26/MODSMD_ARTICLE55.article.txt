l The Editor, Sir:
| Please, kind Sir, my I.Q. approxi
j mates a round number called 40.
| Consequently I find it exceedingly
j difficult to comprehend Mr. Jaques'
! subtlety in his Thursday morning
I garble column. During the year I
: have discovered through intensive
observation that Mr. Jaques' I.Q.
j approaches 40%. This is of course
the reason the "clever" little "poli
tics item" passed me by, leaving me
struggling far behind in its muck,
unable to cope with the "Great
Jaques."
What specifically it has reference
I to no one in our club has been able
|to hazard a guess. We only know
j that such rodent, back-wall writing
j journalism has a decidedly nasty
| undercurrent. There is no doubt it
| gives our club ugly publicity which
[ it does not deserve.
What even Mr. Jaques had in mind
j would have been better said out very
| plainly or not at all. This would be
| the only fair thing to do. At pres
| ent we are looking forward to a
j visit from Mr. Dies at any moment.
jJust what, will be investigated we
j cannot tell, but we do have a vague
I feeling that he is behind the door.
Mr. Jaques should be fair-minded
j enough to come out with an ex
j planation. We would like to get in
jon the secret, too. Oh, yes, our
I Rogues' Gallery is on page 343 of
! the Quad rather than on 342. Just
for the record, of course.
