# GOOD QUAD
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Here as a graduate student, I have
! had the opportunity today along
i with the rest, of Stanford to see the
1939 Quad. As one who can fully
appreciate the amount of work and
money that has gone into the book,
I would like to compliment the
Quad Board for having turned out
one of the best college yearbooks I
j have seen.
