# PIG PEDESTRIANS
## 
### 
While compliments and slams are
being passed out to Stanford drivers,
let us not neglect to put in his place
the Stanford-noonday pedestrian
who, during the heaviest traffic,
stalks along the middle of the pave
ment with the mien of a maharajah,
bestowing a hurt glance on any
driver who dares to honk his horn.
Distressed
