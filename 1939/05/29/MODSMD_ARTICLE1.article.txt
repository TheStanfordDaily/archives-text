### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
JpOR the past five years the stu
dent vertebrae of Stanford's
stiff Republican backbone have been
echoing their fathers' railing against
Roosevelt taxing and Roosevelt
spending.
Before the last presidential elec
tion, thunder from Encina to the
Row threatened a wholesale hegira
of Southern California bankers if
F.D.R. was not thrown out of office.
And when the New Deal was ap
proved at the polls, the local G.O.P.
men continued to moan and hold
their heads whenever they thought
of what was happenuig in Wash
ington.
Even the most faithful Farley
itc cannot deny that the Roose
velt administration has been ex
pending fancifully huge sums on
government projects and relief.
Stanford's representatives of the
upper middle class speak truth
fully when they tell of the tax
burden they are about to inherit.

r | I HERE are two sides to every
question. New Dealers can cite
facts and figures to show the de
crease in unemployment, the im
provement in living conditions of
those in the lowest income brackets,
and a dozen other bright results of
the President's spending policy. On
the other hand, the iconoclasts can
demonstrate just as convincingly
how the Administration is holding
"up recovery by destroying the
faith of the big business man and the
investor.
Because of the peculiar nature of
these economic views, the country
has been split into New Deal and
anti-New Deal camps, rather than
along the conventional lines of the
Republican and Democratic parties.
This week we have evidence that
Roosevelt at last is recognizing the
economy protests that have been
pounded on his door all this time.

Moving to allay the fears of big
business and to discredit the at
tacks of its opponents, the New
Deal announced this week-end its
intention of bringing government
taxing and spending a little nearer
to the middle of the road. Ac
tually the Administration is bow
ing to the demands of Repub
licans and insurgent Democrats,
but it is bending gracefully with
little loss of dignity or equilib
rium.
The projected reform, as an
nounced by Secretary of the Treas
ury Morgenthau, will salve the
wounds of capital by abolishing the
undivided profits tax. In addition to
killing this levy, which business has
long regarded as a punishment for
success, the plan will facilitate a
longer carryover of operating losses
and revise capital stock and excess
profits taxes.

JF ALL of this sounds agreeably
unlikely to arouse the usual bick
ering in our national government,
we have only to consider that item
of the project which proposes to do
away with tax exemption for United
States securities. In the belief that
such a move will encourage finan
cial interests to stimulate private
enterprise instead of investing their
funds in government bonds, Roose
velt has been asking Congress to
make this change since the begin
ning of his session.
However, an opposition bloc, led
by Democratic Senator George of
Georgia and Republican Senator
Borah of Idaho, is determined to
fight the measure. Holding that
such a move would be unconsti
tutional, they are backed by state
and civic governments which
have huge investments in tax
exempt securities.
Officials of the Treasury Depart
ment. estimate that taxing the bonds
will result in a $300,000,000-dollar in
crease in federal income, enough to
rcducc the figures on the red side of
the ledger, if not to liquidate the
national debt.
