FORMER APPEARANCES
The Roth quartet first appeared at
Stanford during the summer of 1937
at which time they played with a
chamber orchestra which performed
all six of the Brandenburg con
certs. Last summer Feri Roth and
his colleagues Jeno Antal, Fcrcnc
Molnar ,and Janos Scholz gave a
series of concerts under the aus
pices of the new organization,
"Friends of Music." This group or
ganized the subscription concerts so
that a reserve may be accumulated
for the furtherance of future musical
projects at Stanford.
The Friends of Music are led by
Mrs. Herbert Hoover, Mrs. Selah
Chamberlain, Mr. George T. Cam
eron, Mr. Robert Watt Miller, Mrs.
Frederic Wheeler.
