OLD ORCHARD, Mc„ May 28
(UP). —An unheralded young man
named Smith streaked a G5O-pound
airplane across a wave-packed beach
today and then pointed her nose
out over the sea on an unauthorized
flight to Europe.
His full name was Thomas Smith,
125, and his ultimate destination was
I VHgue —Foynes, Ireland, probably, if
Ibis 160 gallons of gasoline ran low;
possibly London, if he still were go
ing strong when he got to the other
side. From the start he had shrouded
in mystery his preparations for the
j adventure that has meant glory for
J some, death for many.
In the absence of any word of
Smith, information from the New
foundland coast late today was omi
nous. Were he in the vicinity of St.
j John's, he would be contending with
a strong southeasterly wind, in
I swirling snow which caked into ice
on automobile windshields and a
I ground visibility of 1,000 yards. Air
j men termed "very poor" the pros
j pect of successfully navigating the
| coast by airplane.
The take-off was timed to a mat
ter of minutes, with the tide nosing
in over the smooth sands imme
diately after Smith lifted the baby
clipper from them. The cruising
speed of the plane was reported to
| be 85 miles an hour and its maxi
! mum 105 miles an hour.
