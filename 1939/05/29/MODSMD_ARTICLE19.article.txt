# Spring Show Hits Pay Dirt In Second Act
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
For two nights this week-end
Stanford was treated to entertain
ment that had the night-marish
surrealism of Dali with overtones in
Moss Hart and George S. KaulT- j
mann.
Overgagged in places and definite- i
ly spotty, "Wake Up and Leave" got
ofT to a slow start through a first
act that was relieved by only one
acceptable scene, the Kau Tau fra
ternity initiation.
But Sherm MellinkofT, Harry Mu- j
heim, Charlie Bulotti, and J. P.
Cahn, co-authors, played their cards
beautifully in a rollicking second act
that lifted their show to the cate
gory of a true musical instead of a
second-rate imitation of "You Can't
Take It with You." If for no other
single reason, the telephone conver
sation scene made the whole eve- 1
ning worth while.
MUSIC BELOW PAR
Musical numbers fell slightly be
low par, but arrangements by My
ron Birnbaum helped to make up
for the slack and Art McCue's band
was one of the best outfits that has
fronted a spring show. Jim Stone's
"Changed Your Mind" was the j
strongest ballad and was artfully j
introduced as background music j
from time to time.
The Gilbert and Sullivan-esque!
ditties of MellinkofT and Carl Dies- !
enroth were notably good because j
of catchy words and tricky tune but \
were sung rather poorly. We wished
that "Fair Towers," really the theme
melody of the show, could have
been slipped into sequences oftener.
If Stanford's in search of a new
alma mater, we suggest, with tongue!
in cheek, this song. "Blase and Class I
of '42" was standout satire that J
ticked along with fascinating lilt.

stopped the show as usual. The
sparkle she tosses into swing chore

Cahn's masterful direction of the i
whole production demonstrated skill ]
such as Stanford has seldom seen.
Virginia Sharpes' portrayal of j
Mrs. Feathcrstone, so much like
Penney, was professional at all j
times. Her characterization was
head-and-shoulders above that of
any other of the 37 members of the
cast. Harry Muheim, as Joe Spu
