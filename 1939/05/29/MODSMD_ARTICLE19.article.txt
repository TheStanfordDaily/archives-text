# Spring Show Hits Pay Dirt In Second Act
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
For two nights this week-end
Stanford was treated to entertain
ment that had the night-marish
surrealism of Dali with overtones in
Moss Hart and George S. KaulT- j
mann.
Overgagged in places and definite- i
ly spotty, "Wake Up and Leave" got
ofT to a slow start through a first
act that was relieved by only one
acceptable scene, the Kau Tau fra
ternity initiation.
But Sherm MellinkofT, Harry Mu- j
heim, Charlie Bulotti, and J. P.
Cahn, co-authors, played their cards
beautifully in a rollicking second act
that lifted their show to the cate
gory of a true musical instead of a
second-rate imitation of "You Can't
Take It with You." If for no other
single reason, the telephone conver
sation scene made the whole eve- 1
ning worth while.
MUSIC BELOW PAR
Musical numbers fell slightly be
low par, but arrangements by My
ron Birnbaum helped to make up
for the slack and Art McCue's band
was one of the best outfits that has
fronted a spring show. Jim Stone's
"Changed Your Mind" was the j
strongest ballad and was artfully j
introduced as background music j
from time to time.
The Gilbert and Sullivan-esque!
ditties of MellinkofT and Carl Dies- !
enroth were notably good because j
of catchy words and tricky tune but \
were sung rather poorly. We wished
that "Fair Towers," really the theme
melody of the show, could have
been slipped into sequences oftener.
If Stanford's in search of a new
alma mater, we suggest, with tongue!
in cheek, this song. "Blase and Class I
of '42" was standout satire that J
ticked along with fascinating lilt.

stopped the show as usual. The
sparkle she tosses into swing chore
ography never grows tiresome. J. P. 1
Cahn's masterful direction of the i
whole production demonstrated skill ]
such as Stanford has seldom seen.
Virginia Sharpes' portrayal of j
Mrs. Feathcrstone, so much like
Penney, was professional at all j
times. Her characterization was
head-and-shoulders above that of
any other of the 37 members of the
cast. Harry Muheim, as Joe Spu
moni, the raucous and cheerful
gangster, was strong and convinc
ing. Charlie Bulotti, with or with
out a light beard, was good. Bob
Stevens, the young romantic lead,
did his best to make the role less
a stuffed shirt part than it really
was. His singing was adequate.
FEMININE LEADS
Margaret Paulson, Gerry Schrei
ber, and Eloise Lambert handled
feminine leads with enthusiasm and
ease. Tony Cefaretti and Lyle Pres
sey did a neat bit of work as plumb
ers. Incidentally, much of Pressey's
first speech was taken directly
from the encyclopedia. Aubrey
Austin added amusing business as
the Star Reporter.
First two scenes of Act 1 estab
lished plot basis and character de
lineation. Scenery representing the
Featherstone mansion was not par
ticularly good. In scene three, ac
tion shifted to the Towers Daily
office. This sequence added in no
way to plot development, was
dragged in by the heels to provide
a peg for the "We're from the
Daily" song.
KAU TAU INITIATION
As audiences became restless with
the scenes that were stuffed to the
limit with gags, many of which were
lost because of insufficient plugging
or crowd laughter, the initiation
scene showed promise of saving the
day.
Cleverly staged and costumed, it
brought the best lines of the eve
ning to this point. A woefully weak
tag line let the audience slip from
the mood that the sequence estab
lished.
AM) TO TIIE FINALE
The Psi Psi garden setting intro
duced well handled group action
and spacing of gags that continued
during the remainder of the per
formance. The telephone conversa
tion was as nearly professional as
any student-written show could at
tain. The stormy weather crack
brought down the rafters.
The finale was superbly staged.
Technical perfection in lighting and
color combination made the scene
strong, while song arrangements
were skillfully integrated. Stage
Manager Wilma Fitts and Technical
Director Chet Johnson aided Cahn
in producting Ram's Head's fourth
spring show. Dramatics Manager
Henry Hauser was assisted by
Gordy Weber and Robert Prince.

Gordy Weber and Robert Prince.
For two nights this week-end
Stanford was treated to entertain
ment that had the night-marish
surrealism of Dali with overtones in
Moss Hart and George S. KaulT- j
mann.
Overgagged in places and definite- i
ly spotty, "Wake Up and Leave" got
ofT to a slow start through a first
act that was relieved by only one
acceptable scene, the Kau Tau fra
ternity initiation.
But Sherm MellinkofT, Harry Mu- j
heim, Charlie Bulotti, and J. P.
Cahn, co-authors, played their cards
beautifully in a rollicking second act
that lifted their show to the cate
gory of a true musical instead of a
second-rate imitation of "You Can't
Take It with You." If for no other
single reason, the telephone conver
sation scene made the whole eve- 1
ning worth while.
MUSIC BELOW PAR
Musical numbers fell slightly be
low par, but arrangements by My
ron Birnbaum helped to make up
for the slack and Art McCue's band
was one of the best outfits that has
fronted a spring show. Jim Stone's
"Changed Your Mind" was the j
strongest ballad and was artfully j
introduced as background music j
from time to time.
The Gilbert and Sullivan-esque!
ditties of MellinkofT and Carl Dies- !
enroth were notably good because j
of catchy words and tricky tune but \
were sung rather poorly. We wished
that "Fair Towers," really the theme
melody of the show, could have
been slipped into sequences oftener.
If Stanford's in search of a new
alma mater, we suggest, with tongue!
in cheek, this song. "Blase and Class I
of '42" was standout satire that J
ticked along with fascinating lilt.

stopped the show as usual. The
sparkle she tosses into swing chore
ography never grows tiresome. J. P. 1
Cahn's masterful direction of the i
whole production demonstrated skill ]
such as Stanford has seldom seen.
Virginia Sharpes' portrayal of j
Mrs. Feathcrstone, so much like
Penney, was professional at all j
times. Her characterization was
head-and-shoulders above that of
any other of the 37 members of the
cast. Harry Muheim, as Joe Spu
moni, the raucous and cheerful
gangster, was strong and convinc
ing. Charlie Bulotti, with or with
out a light beard, was good. Bob
Stevens, the young romantic lead,
did his best to make the role less
a stuffed shirt part than it really
was. His singing was adequate.
FEMININE LEADS
Margaret Paulson, Gerry Schrei
ber, and Eloise Lambert handled
feminine leads with enthusiasm and
ease. Tony Cefaretti and Lyle Pres
sey did a neat bit of work as plumb
ers. Incidentally, much of Pressey's
first speech was taken directly
from the encyclopedia. Aubrey
Austin added amusing business as
the Star Reporter.
First two scenes of Act 1 estab
lished plot basis and character de
lineation. Scenery representing the
Featherstone mansion was not par
ticularly good. In scene three, ac
tion shifted to the Towers Daily
office. This sequence added in no
way to plot development, was
dragged in by the heels to provide
a peg for the "We're from the
Daily" song.
KAU TAU INITIATION
As audiences became restless with
the scenes that were stuffed to the
limit with gags, many of which were
lost because of insufficient plugging
or crowd laughter, the initiation
scene showed promise of saving the
day.
Cleverly staged and costumed, it
brought the best lines of the eve
ning to this point. A woefully weak
tag line let the audience slip from
the mood that the sequence estab
lished.
AM) TO TIIE FINALE
The Psi Psi garden setting intro
duced well handled group action
and spacing of gags that continued
during the remainder of the per
formance. The telephone conversa
tion was as nearly professional as
any student-written show could at
tain. The stormy weather crack
brought down the rafters.
The finale was superbly staged.
Technical perfection in lighting and
color combination made the scene
strong, while song arrangements
were skillfully integrated. Stage
Manager Wilma Fitts and Technical
Director Chet Johnson aided Cahn
in producting Ram's Head's fourth
spring show. Dramatics Manager

Gordy Weber and Robert Prince.
For two nights this week-end
Stanford was treated to entertain
ment that had the night-marish
surrealism of Dali with overtones in
Moss Hart and George S. KaulT- j
mann.
Overgagged in places and definite- i
ly spotty, "Wake Up and Leave" got
ofT to a slow start through a first
act that was relieved by only one
acceptable scene, the Kau Tau fra
ternity initiation.
But Sherm MellinkofT, Harry Mu- j
heim, Charlie Bulotti, and J. P.
Cahn, co-authors, played their cards
beautifully in a rollicking second act
that lifted their show to the cate
gory of a true musical instead of a
second-rate imitation of "You Can't
Take It with You." If for no other
single reason, the telephone conver
sation scene made the whole eve- 1
ning worth while.
MUSIC BELOW PAR
Musical numbers fell slightly be
low par, but arrangements by My
ron Birnbaum helped to make up
for the slack and Art McCue's band
was one of the best outfits that has
fronted a spring show. Jim Stone's
"Changed Your Mind" was the j
strongest ballad and was artfully j
introduced as background music j
from time to time.
The Gilbert and Sullivan-esque!
ditties of MellinkofT and Carl Dies- !
enroth were notably good because j
of catchy words and tricky tune but \
were sung rather poorly. We wished
that "Fair Towers," really the theme
melody of the show, could have
been slipped into sequences oftener.
If Stanford's in search of a new
alma mater, we suggest, with tongue!
in cheek, this song. "Blase and Class I
of '42" was standout satire that J
ticked along with fascinating lilt.

stopped the show as usual. The
sparkle she tosses into swing chore
ography never grows tiresome. J. P. 1
Cahn's masterful direction of the i
whole production demonstrated skill ]
such as Stanford has seldom seen.
Virginia Sharpes' portrayal of j
Mrs. Feathcrstone, so much like
Penney, was professional at all j
times. Her characterization was
head-and-shoulders above that of
any other of the 37 members of the
cast. Harry Muheim, as Joe Spu
moni, the raucous and cheerful
gangster, was strong and convinc
ing. Charlie Bulotti, with or with
out a light beard, was good. Bob
Stevens, the young romantic lead,
did his best to make the role less
a stuffed shirt part than it really
was. His singing was adequate.
FEMININE LEADS
Margaret Paulson, Gerry Schrei
ber, and Eloise Lambert handled
feminine leads with enthusiasm and
ease. Tony Cefaretti and Lyle Pres
sey did a neat bit of work as plumb
ers. Incidentally, much of Pressey's
first speech was taken directly
from the encyclopedia. Aubrey
Austin added amusing business as
the Star Reporter.
First two scenes of Act 1 estab
lished plot basis and character de
lineation. Scenery representing the
Featherstone mansion was not par
ticularly good. In scene three, ac
tion shifted to the Towers Daily
office. This sequence added in no
way to plot development, was
dragged in by the heels to provide
a peg for the "We're from the
Daily" song.
KAU TAU INITIATION
As audiences became restless with
the scenes that were stuffed to the
limit with gags, many of which were
lost because of insufficient plugging
or crowd laughter, the initiation
scene showed promise of saving the
day.
Cleverly staged and costumed, it
brought the best lines of the eve
ning to this point. A woefully weak
tag line let the audience slip from
the mood that the sequence estab
lished.
AM) TO TIIE FINALE
The Psi Psi garden setting intro
duced well handled group action
and spacing of gags that continued
during the remainder of the per
formance. The telephone conversa
tion was as nearly professional as
any student-written show could at
tain. The stormy weather crack
brought down the rafters.
The finale was superbly staged.
Technical perfection in lighting and
color combination made the scene
strong, while song arrangements
were skillfully integrated. Stage
Manager Wilma Fitts and Technical
Director Chet Johnson aided Cahn
in producting Ram's Head's fourth
spring show. Dramatics Manager
Henry Hauser was assisted by
