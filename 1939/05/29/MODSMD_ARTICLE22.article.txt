# Dr. Wilbur Suggests 'A Coach on the Field' For Student Dramatics
## President Cites Neglected Safely, Fire Rides During Rehearsals As Cause for Ending Spring Show 
### 
Recommending thai dramatics should he run on "the same system as
athletics, where there is a coach on (he field," Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
tei (lay answered recent criticisms that student activities in dramatics were
being snufTed out by "administrative indifference."
"Is it any wonder that we aren't enthusiastic about such shows?" he
asked, turning to reports from the Comptroller's office which cited in-

â– stances of student neglect of safety
and fire rules and instances of ex
tensive damage which assertedly was
done by students participating in last
fall's Big Game Gaieties.
"It i.-, my place to see that students
are not injured; it is also my placc
to see that the Memorial Theater
is run on an organized basis," he
declared.
"We don't want such disasters as
the Iriquois Theater fire to happen
here," he said, referring to instances
when Fire Chief Robert E. Dugan
had discovered cigarette stubs lit
tering floors near inflammable ma
terials and sets.
"In any professional theater in
the country that wouldn't be allowed
to happen," he declared.
STUDENT DECLARATION
Dr. Wilbur's statement was issued
in response to questions regarding
Ram's Head President J. P. Calm's
declaration last week that he felt
University authorities were regard
ing student dramatic work without;
interest, although he believed such
activity could do as much for ama
teur theater workers as other pro
ductions.
Such activities as the Big Game
Gaieties and the Spring Show, Calm
said, give students responsibility as
well as technical training and "arc
tangible evidences of active under
graduate theatrical work which
would be viewed favorably by alum
ni and friends of the University."
Dr. Wilbur's statement also con
tained the declaration that there
have been complaints because of
low scholastic work, apparently due
to the fact that students have been
overly active in dramatics.
SHOULD BE ORGANIZED'
"It is my idea that Ram's Head or
any other student organization
should not work by itself," he also
said. "Rather, the students should
work under a competent dramatics
supervisor, much the same as they
do on the athletic field.
"As it is now, there is little or
ganization or direction to student
drama work. Some sort of adviser
would be enough to supply those
qualities."
Commenting on the scholastic
standing of drama students, Mary
Yost, dean of women, at the time
of Calm's assertions said that "there
has been a great deal of faculty
criticism of Ram's Head because
some of those working in student,
productions have gotten into aca
demic difficulty."
Cahn, on that point, declared, "It's
up to the people themselves to de
cide whether they can handle both
dramatic and scholastic work. The
administration is perfectly free to
come firmly behind academic restric
tions which will keep such people
out of our productions.
"But if students aren't grown up
enough to balance dramatic and
scholastic work in spite of all we
can do, it is their fault and not that
of Ram's Head as a whole."
