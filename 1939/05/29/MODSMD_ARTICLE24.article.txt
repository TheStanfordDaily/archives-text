# Farm discovery Abolishes Canned Salmon 'Sniffers'
## 
### 
Stanford branches into another field. In days of yesteryear, the Cardi- j
jnil colors waved over the football field and the cinder oval. Now Stan- J
ford University scientists have placed her banner so that it wavesâ€”over
a can of salmon.
Housewives who formerly depended upon ail inspector's sense of
smell in selecting their brand of salmon, hereafter may depend 011 a tiny

test-tube to pass judgment.
The Stanford group, led by Dr.
Charles Alsberg, former director of
the Stanford Food Research Insti
tute 1 , recently served notice that
their efforts to aid in salmon inspec
tion are finally bearing fruit.
Under the present system, in
spoHors snilf unscientifically, fol
low their noses in making condem
nations. Cannery men claim that
the possible percentage of error is
too high.
THREE-YEAR EXPERIMENTS
Three years ago the Association of
Pacific Fisheries told a group of
Stanford bacteriologists and chem
ists their problems. The campus
scientists are coming through.
The findings of the investigation,
it was learned, may save Pacific
Coast fishermen and eanners thou
sands of dollars each year. Not only
will it put condemnations on a sci
entific basis, but it will furnish the
industry with new weapons with
which to fight spoilage.
SEEKIN(; DISINFECTANT
At present the research workers
are seeking a disinfectant to solve
the greatest problem left, that of
reducing the number of bacteria
that are the ultimate cause of the
spoilage.
That once done the Stanford
group will know the hardest half is
over. "They shall not pass" will
mean contaminated cans of salmon
too!
