# English Test Radio System for Mines

LONDON (UP). —A two-way sys
tem of radio communication, which
would enable men in remote parts
of a mine to keep in touch with the
world above, is being tested in a
South Yorkshire colliery.
If experiments prove successful,
one of the terrors of mining—the
fear of being cut off from contact
jvith rescuers after an accident—
will be banished.
During a disaster drill, it was
found that by means of a transmitter
at the pithead men trapped behind a
barrier of fallen roof could receive
messages from the surface.
