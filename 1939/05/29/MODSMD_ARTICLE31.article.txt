## THANKS FOR LABOR DAY 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Board of Directors of the
Stanford Convalescent Home hopes
that you will find room to print
this acknowledgment of all the help
given to them by the students dur
ing the recent annual drive and
Labor Day. They appreciate very
much the interest taken in the or
ganization and the very substantial
help which they received both
financially and in work done on the
grounds. They hope that all en
joyed the day and feel that their
efforts were well repaid by the aid
which they have given to the
children.
It is impossible to thank each stu
dent who contributed to the total
result, but all that was done is very
much appreciated.

Secretary-Treasurer
