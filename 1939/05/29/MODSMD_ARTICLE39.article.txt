### JERRY MAYER 
ONCE UPON a time the IC4-A
was the blue ribbon track event of
the eastern schools. Yale, Princeton,
Harvard, and Dartmouth took turns
winning the championship, smug in
the feeling that if they weren't the
best track teams in the country they
:il least had the best pedigree.
Today Harvard, Yale, Princeton
and Dartmouth still have their pedi
grees, but the glory of winning the
famous Icy Foray is out of the ques
tion. Because, of course, the east
erners in a moment of weakness in
vited Stanford, California, and U,
S. C. to join their fold.
Unlike the N.C.A.A., which any
college in the country can enter pro
vided it puts up the necessary fee,
the Icy Foray is open only to team
belonging to the association. When
the Trojans, Bears and Indians
.were asked to become members, the
event commenced to take on the as
pects of a rerunning of the Pacific
Coast Conference meet. In fact, last
Saturday at Randall's Island, New
York, the Trojans scored more
points than they did in the P.C.C.
trackfest.
But the fact remains that the east
ern schools started, established, de
veloped their Blue Ribbon meet —
and then handed it over to the
West. A vote of thanks is in order.

FROM LISTENING to the broad
cast of last Saturday's affair it seems
almost certain that if Stanford's
B.A.C. had seen its way clear to
send the best seven Card cinder
pathmen east the Cards could easily
have taken second place behind the
Trojans. Clyde Jeffrey could have

won the sprints in a walk and Pete
Zagar would have been a good 7
feet better than the rest of the field
in the discus. Stan Andersen and
Bill Wohle could have finished two
three in the shot put, certainly no
worse than three-four; Mushy Gir
ard, running the way he did at Se
attle, would have nabbed a third in
the mile. Hurdlers Stan Hisernian
and Bill Hawkins probably would
have nabbed seconds in the lows
and highs, respectively. Each has
been pushing Viekery and Hum
phreys, who won the two events for
U.S.C., all season.
Count 'em up—over 30 points.
Pittsburgh was second with 20. If
Simpson, Pool and Braheny were to
be included, a few more points could
be tackled on Stanford's "might
have been" total.

THE SPORTS FRONT FIVE
YEARS AGO THIS WEEK: Seven
Stanford trackmen won the Icy
Foray with 35'/i points (U.S.C. scor
ed 71' v last Saturday), winning four
events. Johnny Lyman annexed the
shot, Slinger Dunn, copped the dis
cus, Al Blackman nabbed the 400
meters and Sam Klopstock triumph
ed in the low hurdles. Dink Tcm
pleton announced that this would be
the last time Stanford would ever
enter this particular meet. P.S.—
U.S.C. was not entered.
Lawson Little, great golfer, won
the British Amateur championship,
was voted a Block S, which two
weeks before had been denied him
because he had only won his way
as far as the semi-finals of the Na
tional Amateur championship.
