PARIS, May 28 (UP).â€”U. S. Am
bassador William C. Bullitt, obvious
ly referring to the reversal of
Franco-British foreign policy since
March, said in a speech dedicating
the American Legion memorial
vault in the new Neuilly Cemetery
today:
"To Americans as to all the great
peoples of the western world ac
ceptance of war is a less horrible
alternative than acceptance of en
slavement."
Premier Edouard Daladicr also
spoke at the ceremony. The United
States ambassador insisted those who
thought Americans fought in vain in
the World War, and say another
world war in inevitable, were
wrong.
