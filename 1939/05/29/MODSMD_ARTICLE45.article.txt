# Alpha Delis Cop Intramural Swim Title
## Japanese; D.U.'s Fake Second Spot; Frosh Sweeps Diving 
### 
Amassing a total of 31 points, al-
most twice that of the nearest con-
tender, Alpha Delta Phi swept the
intramural swimming meet held
Thursday and Friday afternoons in
the Encina Pools.
Tied for second place were the
Japanese Club and the D.U.'s with
16 points each. Other teams placed
in the following order: Kappa
Sig 7; Chi Psi, 6; Alpha Sig, 6;
Branner, 4; Sigma Chi, 4; Phi Delt,
3; Beta, 2; Encina Basement, 2; and
Sequoia, 1.
The annual meet saw the breaking
of only one intramural record. Dave
Nottage, Alpha Delt, swam the 75-
yard breast stroke in the trials in
the fast time of :52.7 to lop better
than half a second from the mark
of :53.4 held by Dick Lyon, Zete.
JAPANESE STAR
Pete Okumoto, Japanese Club,
starred with his wins in both the
50 - yard and 100 - yard free - style
races. His trial time of :24.6 was
not quite fast enough to set a new
record but was far-and-away the
best performance turned in.
Lewis Dorsey, competing for the
Encina Basement, swept the diving
event from all contenders with the
notable aggregate point score of
127.8.
