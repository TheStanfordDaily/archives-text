# Dean Pitches Hubs to Win
## Cards Sneak Came; Giants Victorious 
### 
NEW YORK. May 28 (UP).— Dizzy
Dean's sore arm formula—"all work
and no play"—continued to pay off
dividends, today as the former Na
tional League pitching ace hung up
his second straight victory li-2 over
the Pittsburgh Pirates and moved
the Chicago Cubs into third place.
Dean held the Pirates to eight
scattered hits. Joe Bowman and
Bill Swift worked for the Pirates,
giving up nine blows.
The St. Louis Cardinals snapped
the Cincinnati Reds' winning streak
at 12 straight by squeezing out a 6-55
decision in the first game of a
double-header.
St. Louis got off to a three-run
lead in the first on two hits, a sacri
fice, four straight walks off Johnny
Vandermeer and a balk.
The Reds came back with four
runs in the third on four singles
and an error but Pepper Martin's
triple, Medwick's double and
Mize's single gave the Cards a 5-4
margin in the fourth. McCormick's
homer tied it up for the Reds in the
fifth.
The New York Giants put on a
five-run rally in the eighth inning
and downed the Philadelphia Phil
lies, 7-2, to ride into sixth place.
The Giants collected 10 hits to the
Phillies' 9 and knocked out Max
Butcher in the eighth. Bill Lohr
mann was credited with the win.
