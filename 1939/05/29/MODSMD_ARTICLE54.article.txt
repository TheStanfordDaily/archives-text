THAT there is more than one side to the dis
cussion of Ram's Head activities in Memorial
Theater was proved by Dr. Wilbur's statement
on page one in regard to unsupervised work
in Memorial Theater.
He points out:
1. That there is a system of a sort when stu
dents work unsupervised as long as certain
individuals are in control. When those indi
viduals are gone, there is no system.
2. That students are careless in regard to
safety and fire regulations while working back
stage.
3. That student organizations are irrespon
sible and indifferent as regards cleaning up
after their productions, that they have little
courtesy in regard to clearing stages for Divi
sion productions.
Best illustration of what he means is the story
told in a report from the Comptroller's Office.
On an inspection tour, Fire Chief Dugan came
upon two students painting on sets for the
Big Game Gaieties backstage. The one which
they were doing was on paper soaked in oil.
They were using oil paint, but had applied too
much in some spots.
To clean the extra paint off, they were using
gasoline.
Both fire doors back stage were open. A
large cast was rehearsing on stage.
On the floor were cigarette stubs.
There are fire rules which provide for no
smoking backstage and that fire doors shall
be kept closed.
What might have been in this case is not a
happy conjecture.
Ram's Head will have to go a long way to
meet such charges as these and the one that
its members are having difficulty with their
academic work.
As a solution, Dr. Wilbur proposes that stu
dent activities be put entirely under the direc
tion of faculty supervision—under professional
supervision.
That this may be a fair way out of what is
apparently a distressing dilemma is almost ob
vious.
As in the case of social functions, if students
cannot wield with common sense the respon
sibility that is directed their way, some solution
must be found. It must be accepted that ad
ministration assertions in regard to the situation
are correct.
Faculty "supervision" might be much less
irritating to students vitally concerned with
their work in Memorial Theater than faculty
"direction."
Finally, the professional theater does not
tolerate disregard of its rules—there is a reason
for them.
Memorial Theater cannot afford that disre
gard either.
