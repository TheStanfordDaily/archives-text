FAR famed and blessed with a reputation
founded on fact are such Stanford depart
ments as biology, psychology, education, and
the graduate schools. But the liberal arts sub
jects never have been diamonds glittering on
the University's bosom.
In an institution of this size, with a somewhat
restricted budget, it has been necessary to con
centrate on economics, political science, and the
other courses most in demand when allotting
funds for social studies.
Inadeguately staffed and eguipped, the fine
arts have been left to struggle along as best
they can.
This week one of these step-children will be
a Cinderella. For the Department of Music
will ride to the ball in a pumpkin coach when
it presents its barogue festival.
Performances by the world-famed Roth Quar
tet on Tuesday and Friday evenings will lead
up to a concert version of Purcell's opera "Dido
and Aeneas" on Saturday. In addition, stu
dents will present a modern dance recital in
Memorial Hall Wednesday evening, and the
band will perform in the Frost Amphitheater
Thursday afternoon.
With a major event scheduled for each day
of the festival, it is hoped that the student body
will take advantage of this opportunity to hear
great music.
Artists of the caliber of the Roth Quartet and
a performance as musically important as "Dido
and Aeneas" are certain to attract off-campus
attention.
And perhaps a Prince Charming will come
along to fit the Department of Music with a glass
slipper.—L. L.
