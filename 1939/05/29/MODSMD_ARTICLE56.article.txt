# If Not Now â€” Soon

### 
ON the announcement list of new members
of Phi Beta Kappa last week there were
70 names.
The number in itself is not particularly re
markable, but the number of those students

who have maintained excellent ratings in their
academic work and yet have been leaders in
student and extra-curricular activities is exceed
ingly large.
From this fact there are a few conclusions
that follow logically:
That the Phi Beta Kappa award will mean
more in the future if it can be given to this
type of person.
That soon being a Phi Bete will not carry the
customary stigma.
