### THOMAS S. BARCLAY Professor of Political Science 
COLLEGE MEN AND POLITICS
II recent years, both news reporting and the editorial
have become increasingly impersonal. The decline
of the former personal journalism has been met, in
part, by the rise of the columnist.
Today, politics, sport, news, town gossip, philosophy,
humor, education, essays, medical hints, and advice to
the lovelorn are purveyed by many contributors, in
cluding Lippmann, Broun, Rice, Pegler, Winchell,
Cobbs, and other famous men. Their purpose usually
is to simplify and to explain, frequently by original
methods of presentation and by unusual language.
Students of political science are chiefly interested in
the political columnist, who represents a significant
return to personal journalism. He endeavors to in
terpret governmental policies and to indicate trends.
In that sense, the following brief observations are
made on the place of the college trained man in
politics today.
Two phases of the situation are clear. First, there
is the emergence since 1933 of the rather mysterious
Brain Trust, by which is meant a vague group of
professors, experts in economics, in political science,
and in law, who have attempted to bring to the solu
tion of national problems a spirit of enterprise and
of inventiveness. Although politicians, lawyers, and
business men have gone to Washington for many
decades, the first time the word "brains" had been
used was when the professors arrived there. These
men were not a cohesive group; rather they repre
sented a general point of view and a philosophy which
maintained that economic and political processes are
contingent rather than inevitable. Experimentation in
governmental problems seemed to them necessary and
desirable.
* * * *
M ANY of these college men, both those recruited
from university faculties and their students, have
been appointed to administrative positions of respon
sibility. Others, possibly a score, have been named to
the federal bench. The achievements of these groups
and the recognition they have received constitute evi
dence of a new sense of values and of common public
purpose which arc a source of pride to college men
everywhere.
Second, there is the growing conviction that col
lege men should take an active and practical inter
est. in politics. That is, they should recognize that the
foundation of the vast business of government remains
the political party. It is not necessary, perhaps, that
they should enter directly the ranks of the office-hold
ing and office-seeking class. But they must realize
that, in every jurisdiction, the management, the cost,
and the conduct of the public business are determined
by the leadership and the character of the political
parties. Pressure and reform groups are effective, but
they are not sufficient.
It is no doubt true that politics has been, is, and
always will be, carried on by politicians. It is equally
true, however, that much can be done to improve the
quality and the intelligence of political leadership.
Participation in politics by college men who have be
come party politicians by avocation is greatly needed.
Party management and control are only too often in
opposition ot movements for improving the process of
government. There is encouraging evidence today at
testing to the fact that informed college men are
abandoning their traditional attiude of indifference
and are becoming "citizen politicians."

foundation of the vast business of government remains
the political party. It is not necessary, perhaps, that
they should enter directly the ranks of the office-hold
ing and office-seeking class. But they must realize
that, in every jurisdiction, the management, the cost,

It is no doubt true that politics has been, is, and

COLLEGE MEN AND POLITICS
II recent years, both news reporting and the editorial
have become increasingly impersonal. The decline
of the former personal journalism has been met, in
part, by the rise of the columnist.
Today, politics, sport, news, town gossip, philosophy,
humor, education, essays, medical hints, and advice to
the lovelorn are purveyed by many contributors, in
cluding Lippmann, Broun, Rice, Pegler, Winchell,
Cobbs, and other famous men. Their purpose usually
is to simplify and to explain, frequently by original
methods of presentation and by unusual language.
Students of political science are chiefly interested in
the political columnist, who represents a significant
return to personal journalism. He endeavors to in
terpret governmental policies and to indicate trends.
In that sense, the following brief observations are
made on the place of the college trained man in
politics today.
Two phases of the situation are clear. First, there
is the emergence since 1933 of the rather mysterious
Brain Trust, by which is meant a vague group of
professors, experts in economics, in political science,
and in law, who have attempted to bring to the solu
tion of national problems a spirit of enterprise and
of inventiveness. Although politicians, lawyers, and
business men have gone to Washington for many
decades, the first time the word "brains" had been
used was when the professors arrived there. These
men were not a cohesive group; rather they repre
sented a general point of view and a philosophy which
maintained that economic and political processes are
contingent rather than inevitable. Experimentation in
governmental problems seemed to them necessary and
desirable.
