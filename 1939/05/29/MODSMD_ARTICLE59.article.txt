Two kids, possibly from high school, were sitting
in the balcony watching "Washington Square" the
other night.
A1 Jolson was mammying his way through a song,
and the guy said, "Gee, that Jolson. He's good."
"What's good about him?" the girl said. "He
can't dance and he can't sing and he can't act.'
And then Alice Faye came on the screen. "Now
there's someone who is good," the girl said.
"Ah, what's good about her. She can't act, she
can't sing, she can't dance. What's she got."
The girl looked at him in utter amazement. "Well,"
she said. "Well!"
Is he blind, she said to herself.
