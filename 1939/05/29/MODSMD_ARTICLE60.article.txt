They say it is the truth about the people at the
Beta-Delt ferry-boat dance.
I mean about the two persons who accidentally
crashed the party.
They were standing at the dock waiting for a ferry
to Oakland. As it happened they were standing at the
place from where people leaving on the fraternity
party were embarking.
The ferry was about to pull out. The guy on the
boat taking tiekets saw these two men standing
there.
"Hey, you had better get on if you're going," he
said, hurriedly helping them on.
The two men went into the ferry, pulled out their
newspapers, and settled themselves for a ride to
Oakland.
And then the orchestra started to play. . . .
