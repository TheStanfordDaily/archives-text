# ER, PICNIC
## 
### 
I believe it was at the Axe Society dinner that
this happened.
One of the juniors interested in the junior picnic
held at Half Moon Bay a couple of week-ends ago
called across the table to another junior and asked
him how many of the juniors in his house were going
to it.
He mentioned the number going and then said,
"I think that's a pretty good number considering we
are having our house beer bust on Sunday."
It was about then that he realized he was sitting
next to Dean Bunn.
