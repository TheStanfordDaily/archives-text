# 'Lucky Night' Theme Stifled By Taylor, Loy
## 
### 
"LUCKY NIGHT," playing now
at the Fox-Stanford.
This is a show with a good theme.
On the surface, it's a neat, domes
tic drama. But underneath, it poses
the subtle problem that faces mil
lions of people in a bewildering
world.
Bill and Cora, who met on a park
bench, were both searching for

something. After
they were mar
ried, they began
to search togeth
er for the thing
that would give
meaning and di
rection to their
lives. Cora found
it in the security
of a third floor
apartment, with
new curtains, and
a potted plant on
the fire escape.
Bill didn't find it

in a $35-a-week job selilng paint.
He had an idea. He was rebellious.
He believed in celebrating — cele
brate when you win and when you
lose. If you don't, the world will
take all the fun away from you.
The idea, to him, was more im
portant than $35 a week, saving
money, and rationing cigarettes.
This is the background against
which Myrna Loy and Robert Tay
lor proceed to mutilate a fairly in
teresting social theme. Maybe it is
n't their fault. The cards were
stacked; dialogue is poor. And, in
one valiant attempt after another
to play the parts lightly, Loy and
Taylor tread so heavily that they
stifle the lilt that earlier parts of
the film demanded.
This could have been excellent,
and it turned out "only fair." —
