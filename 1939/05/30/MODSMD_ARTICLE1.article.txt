### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
JT WAS drizzling and the lamps
were dim at the entrance to
Downing Street where night after
night a spasmodic train of figures
in top hats, carrying black umbrel
las, turned the corner and knocked
at the door of Number 10.
Gathered around the conference
fable the British Cabinet debated for
endless hours the advisability of
capitulating to the Soviet's demand
for a full mutual protection pact.
Pro—the assurance of an opposition
formidable enough to intimidate
Germany and Italy. Con—the dan
ger of being dragged into a war in
the Far East where Russo-Japanese
tension is approaching the breaking
point.
After considering and reconsid
ering every angle of the situation,
the ministers concluded that they
could not afford to lose the oppor
tunity the alliance presented. How
ever. they sent their proposition
lo Moscow with explicit mention
of the conditions under which
they would send troops to Russia's
aid, and on the question of Japan
it was silent.
»»t *l« *
r J TOMORROW the Supreme Soviet
will deliver its reply to the Brit
ish ambassador, accepting, rejecting,
or holding out for a few changes in
the proposal. Highly probable it is
that one of the desired modifications
will be a guarantee of support in
case of a Japanese attack.
The necessity of armed aid against
the eastern empire is a great deal
closer to reality than the threat of
aggression by any European power.
For today comes word that troops
of Japan and Soviet-controlled
Outer Mongolia already have clash
ed on the northern frontier of Man
chukuo, that thousands of regular
mechanized troops and over 200 air
planes were engaged in the battle.
* * *
Most sensational is the Japanese
claim that 42 Russian planes were
shot down in the warfare that
continued all last week. The Nip
ponese boast that hut one of their
own planes was disabled leads one
to doubt the accuracy of the pre
vious figure, hut all authoritative
sources tend to verify it, and the
Soviet government refuses to deny
or confirm it.
Speculation is rife over the whys
and wherefores of this fight, over a
territory that, is worthless cxcept for
the paleontological remains found on
its Gobi Desert. It. may be that
Japan intends it. as a last-minute
warning to England not to sign the
Russian pact. On the other hand,
she may be trying to demonstrate
that the alliance with western Eu
rope will have no effect on her im
perialistic program
There is also a strong possibility
that the informal war was foment
ed in Moscow in order to convince
Britain of the necessity of a close
and qualified Franco-Russo-lirit
ish pledge.
# * *
the bond between these
TT three nations almost complete
and the*ink on the Rome - Berlin
military alliance already dry, Adolf
Hitler is about to revive his cam
paign to win Japan and Spain as
full-fledged members of the fascist
front. Tomorrow flying flags and
roaring cannon will welcome home
the German troops that the Nazis
long denied they sent to Spain. And
at the same time attractive offers
are being sent to General Franco in
Madrid.
* * *
If Stalin accepts the conditions of
the British alliance. Hitler will find
it far easier to convince the Japa
nese that they should transform the
anti-Commintern agreement into a
military pact. With France and Eng
land backing Russia, the Nipponese
are bound to feel that perhaps they
too will need support from western
Europe.
London and Berlin arc full of
rumors that the Fuehrer will seize
the opportunity offered by the
forging of the Anglo-Soviet bond
to conduct a final house-cleaning
of all his empty avowals of
friendship.
