# Quad Staff Up for Final Excom Okay
## Date Tie-ups Solution May He Presented In Long-range Plan 
### 
Ex Committee tonight will review
investigations of Quad staff, Cardi
nals, and Rally Committee appoint
ments for a possible final approval.
In addition Betty Davis, A.S.S.U.
vice-president, will present the final
report of her investigation of pos
sible revisions for social regulations
for on- and off-campus dances.
A solution to tie-ups on dates may
be the result of Roy Thompson's
study on the subject. He will pre
sent findings, for Cardinals, in the
form of a long-range planning study.
PRESENTED LAST WEEK
The staff for the 1940 yearbook
was announced at last week's meet
ing by retiring editor Frank Lipp
man, following approval of the ap
pointments by Publications Council.
Standing by its constitutional pre
rogative of final approval, however,
Ex Committee refused to okay the
staff, on the grounds of affiliation
hierarchy. Fearing that "a certain
house" was gaining control "be
yond a coincidental stage," the ap
pointments were returned to Publi
cations Council for further investi
gation.
The latter group met last Wednes
day, re-approved the staff. At the
same time, the Council passed a res
olution suggesting to Ex Committee
that a committee be appointed next
year to work with Publications
Council and investigate the system
of Quad appointments.
SYSTEM AT FAULT'
Reason given for the reiteration
was that "the committee felt that the
system, rather than this year's ap
pointments, is wrong."
That next year's Cardinals and
Rally Committee heads and mem
bers will be given final approval by
Ex Committee seemed a dstinct pos
sibility, according to informed
sources.
Last week, outgoing Cardinals
Chairman Roy Thompson presented
a list of suggestions to till the seven
Cardinals positions and the 37 Rally
Committee openings. From this list,
final choices were to be named fol
lowing investigation by a committee
consisting of Ken Cuthbertson, Co
line Upshaw, Jim Barnum, and An
nabel le Clark.
Other business will include ap
proval of the Daily business staff
appointments, made yesterday by
new Business Manager Jim Cutler.
