# Roth Concert Series Opens Tonight, 7:30
## Three-day Program Opens with Debussy 
### 
The Roth Quartet's first concert
of the season here at Stanford will
be presented tonight at 7:30 o'clock
in Memorial Hall as a feature of
the regular Tuesday series. The
concert will be free, and no seats
will be reserved.
First on the program will be
String Quartet in G minor by
Claude Debussy. Written in 1893
while Debussy was engaged in writ
ing "Pelleas and Melisande," the
work is the only string quartet ever
written by the composer.
COPLAND OUTSTANDING
Aaron Copland, who wrote the
second quartet to be performed on
the program, is an outstanding rep
resentative of the young school of
American composers sometimes
called "radical." His music ranges
from the so-called "musicians" mu
sic of his early period to functional
"easy-to-do-and-get" compositions
of the last few years.
The last composition will be Beet
hoven's String Quartet in F major.
This is the 16th of Beethoven's 17
quartets and was written approxi
mately a year before his death in
1827. This F major quartet is not
considered as profound as the other
five great. Beethoven quartets, but is
rather charming and melodic.
