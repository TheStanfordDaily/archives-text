# Congress Plans Cut in Farm Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 29 (UP). â€”
Farm bloc leaders considered it
probable tonight that conferees on
the record billion dollar agricultural
appropriation bill will retain the
controverted $225,000,000 parity pro
vision, but will chip millions from
the measure to placate President
Roosevelt and the economy group.
There are more than 60 items in
the bill which could be pruned
without arousing too much opposi
tion, it was stated.
One of the targets is the $113,000,-
000 grant for disposal of farm sur
passes. Another item is the $25,-
000,000 voted to relieve farm ten
ancy conditions. These two and the
parity proposal were rejected by the
House.
