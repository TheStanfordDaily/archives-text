# Radio Club Lays Revival Plans
## Inactive Group Calls Meeting to Organize 
### 
All students interested in reorgan
izing the Stanford Radio Club have
been asked by Cameron Pierce and
Mike Villard to attend the meeting
tomorrow night at 7:15, Room 510 in
the Electrical Engineering lab.
The club has been inactive for the
past year and next year will be con
ducted along entirely different
lines, according to the organizers. In
the future the club will be under
the supervision of the electrical en
gineering department.
According to Villard, next year
members will have the use of a one
kilowatt short-wave radio-telephone
and telegraph station, which he and
Pierce are constructing.
This year the Stanford radio team,
with Stan Carr operating and
Pierce and Villard handling the
equipment, won third place in
schools west of the Mississippi in a
contest to see how many foreign
stations each team could call.
Since the equipment available has
been improved, the club is interested
to see how many men are interested
in taking part in the group next
year.
