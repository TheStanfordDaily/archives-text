THE ORACLE
! The Editor, Sir:
Last Thursday, Friday, and Sat
; urday nights provided three excel
| lent opportunities for students and
! friends to treat themselves to some
; of the best, in my opinion, of what
i Stanford has to offer. 1 am speaking
of the A.S.U.-sponsored discussion
| between Adolf Bode and Gertie
i Landauer, and the two performances
j of Ram's Head Spring Show, "Wake
I Up and Leave."
! OBJECTIVITY
Apparently, many persons real
ized the value, intellectual as well as
emotional, to be derived from an
objective treatment of a certain
' phase of Nazi Germany's activities
j from two distinguished students, for
j the strenuous efforts of Miss Glass
! man and her A.S.U. organization
j were rewarded by a packed audi
! ence.
Here, there is no necessity for ex
| tending sympathy—rather, enthusi
| astic congratulations are in order.
! As everyone who attended the af
j fairs will most certainly agree, the
j Landauer-Bode conversation proved
l immensely enlightening to those of
; us who, eager to learn something of
j the truth, must depend upon the
| newspapers and other equally un
| dependable sources for our infor-
I mation about the rest of the world.
SPUING SHOW
I Much less fortunate were students
; who figuratively slaved to give us a
| 100 per cent student show, "Wake Up
! and Leave," on Friday and Saturday
: evenings. To see the manner in
which those "kids" scrambled around
| back-stage at the Memorial Theater
j keeping things moving is an im
| mensely satisfying experience.
They are people who are really
j interested in their work, putting
I their all into each effort.
! ENVY
How f envy them!
! Yet although they very obviously
; enjoy their work, it is safe to con
-1 elude that a poor turnout of spec
j tutors has a tremendous demoraliz
ing effect upon them.
Any outsider, who may be around,
can feel their disappointment. Yet
even more pathetic is the fact that a
high quality of entertainment, con
ceived and acted out entirely by
i Stanford men and women, is benefit
| ting only a fraction of us.
Highly probable is it that wc may
i not have the opportunity in the
! future to see such shows. If this
I becomes a reality, there will be only
those of -us, Ihe potential audience,
who have been either stupidly in
different or too lethargic to give such
a line, hardworking bunch of "kids"
real break, to be blamed.
I, for one, will be very sad.

THE ORACLE
! The Editor, Sir:
Last Thursday, Friday, and Sat
; urday nights provided three excel
| lent opportunities for students and
! friends to treat themselves to some
; of the best, in my opinion, of what
i Stanford has to offer. 1 am speaking
of the A.S.U.-sponsored discussion
| between Adolf Bode and Gertie
i Landauer, and the two performances
j of Ram's Head Spring Show, "Wake
I Up and Leave."
! OBJECTIVITY
Apparently, many persons real
ized the value, intellectual as well as
emotional, to be derived from an
objective treatment of a certain
' phase of Nazi Germany's activities
j from two distinguished students, for
j the strenuous efforts of Miss Glass
! man and her A.S.U. organization
j were rewarded by a packed audi
! ence.
Here, there is no necessity for ex
| tending sympathy—rather, enthusi
| astic congratulations are in order.
! As everyone who attended the af
j fairs will most certainly agree, the
j Landauer-Bode conversation proved
l immensely enlightening to those of
; us who, eager to learn something of
j the truth, must depend upon the
| newspapers and other equally un
| dependable sources for our infor-
I mation about the rest of the world.
SPUING SHOW
I Much less fortunate were students
; who figuratively slaved to give us a
| 100 per cent student show, "Wake Up
! and Leave," on Friday and Saturday
: evenings. To see the manner in
which those "kids" scrambled around
| back-stage at the Memorial Theater
j keeping things moving is an im
| mensely satisfying experience.
They are people who are really
j interested in their work, putting
I their all into each effort.
! ENVY
How f envy them!
! Yet although they very obviously
; enjoy their work, it is safe to con
-1 elude that a poor turnout of spec
j tutors has a tremendous demoraliz
ing effect upon them.
Any outsider, who may be around,
