The Editor, Sir:
May I take this means of express
ing my thanks to Dr. Robinson for

his friendly and sincere "plugging"
of the Spring Show. He said it was
the best student show in many years.
He should know.
Also my friends in the show and
fellow technicians join me in ex
pressing regret that the Paly Times
hadn't got the sense to send a fair
minded and unbiased reviewer to
see the show Friday night. That
pseudo - sophisticated person who
signed himself "staff reviewer" wrote
an article that was unfair and
seemed to be pointed at one small
group of persons connected with the
show.
