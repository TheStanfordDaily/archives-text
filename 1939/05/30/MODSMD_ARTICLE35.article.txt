# Vancouver Hails Royalty In Big Ovation
## Royal Mace Given George; Crowds Pour Over Canada Border 
### 
VANCOUVER, 8.C., May 29 (UP).
I —Vancouver, Canada's great Pacific
seaport, took King George and
! Queen Elizabeth to its heart today.
Half a million people, including an
I estimated 20.000 Americans, gave
their majesties a thunderous wel
i come when they stepped off the
royal train and drove past a massed
military display through decorated
| streets to the city hall.
At the city hall King George was
! presented with Vancouver's five
[ foot royal rnace, in token of his sov
| ereignty.
Fifteen thousand sang the
j Hallelujah Chorus.
GREAT OVATION
The city's ovation, one of the
greatest George and Elizabeth have
received since they ascended Brit
ain's throne, blended western Can
ada's good fellowship arid the Do
minion's traditional devotion to King
and Empire.
Alter a day crowded with recep
-1 tions, processions and other formali
j ties—a day that was one of the
! many climaxes of the royal couple's
tour of Canada—they departed late
this afternoon by boat for Victoria,
arriving four hours later.
In Victoria, capital of British Co
lumbia and Canada's most English
city, where gas is called petrol and
where cricket, rugger and tea are
honored institutions, their majes
ties will stay over Memorial Day.
KING TO SPEAK
George is scheduled to make a
brief nation-wide broadcast from
Victoria tomorrow noon. Except for
this, he and Queen Elizabeth will
spend the day in rest—relaxing in
their quarters in Government
House, or driving through quiet,
oak-lined streets.
The King and Queen turn east
Wednesday via Vancouver, New
Westminster, Jasper Park and Ed
monton en route to Niagara Falls,
where they will enter American soil
for their history-making visit to
Washington, D.C.
21-GUN SALUTE
The royal train arrived in Van
couver at 10 a.m. (P.S.T.), The in
stant the King's foot touched ground
the 15th Coast Brigade, Royal Cana
dian Artillery, fired a 21-gun salute.
The salute set off a din of whistles
in the harbor which was crowded
with scores of pleasure and com
mercial craft and four Canadian de
stroyers.
More than 2100 officers and men
representing all units of the Van
couver garrison, with detachments
from the Royal Canadian Navy, the
Royal Canadian Air force, paraded
at full strength.
