# Spanish Group To Give Comedies
## 
### 
"Rosina Es Ftagil" (Rosina Is
Fickle) and "La Rcja" (The Window
Grill), two one-act comedies in
Spanish, will be presented by the
Spanish students of the Department
of Romanic Languages, Thursday,
June 1, at 8 o'clock in the Little
Theater.
"Rosina," by Gregorio Martinez
Sierra, is a comedy dealing with the
affairs of a coquette who finds it
difficult to make up her mind with
whom she is in love. John T. Rcid
is directing this play.
The second one-act is by Joaquin
and Serafin Alvarez Quintero and
will be directed by Ralph Michels.
This play will be noted for its cast,
all of whom speak Spanish as a
native tongue. Notable among the
linguists is Ramon Espinosa, who
has played prominent roles in all
of the language plays presented on
the campus.
