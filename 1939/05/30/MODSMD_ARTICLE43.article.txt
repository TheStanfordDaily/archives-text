DINK TEMPLETON, our veteran J
"all work, no play" propagandist,
can sit back now and rest on his
laurels, for none other than the great
Jerome Herman Dean, oft-times ad
dressed as Ole Diz, among other
titles, has found solace in the Tem
pleton theories.
Ole Diz, known to most of us as
one of the few really great baseball j
players ever to play in the National |
League, is in the midst of another
comeback—his fifth or sixth — and;
this time he seems to have discov- j
ered why he never made the grade
in his previous attempts.
"I wasn't working hard enough," j
he has said, "and from now on I'll j
take my regular turn with all work j
'and no play."
* * *
All of which should make the!
Dink beam with joy. Not everyone
in these United States agrees with
Templeton on his contention that an,
athlete never grow.'", stale. Dink in- I
sists there is no such thing as being
over-trained. The real reason for
physical failure, he has always in
sisted, is pure lack of work and
nothing else. That, of course, does
n't include the unexpected casual
ties such a pulled muscles and shin
splints.
Dizzy Dean's first two come
backs were shrouded with sor
row simply because his once pow
erful fog ball no longer carried
the same zip and deception. Dean
would pitch one day, get knocked
out of the box, and then have all
the specialists in that section of
the country advise a month of
nothing but rest. Dedn would rest
and then get knocked out of the
box again in another :>0 days. The
monotony of the thing was stu
pendous.
Then the not-so-dizzy one fig
ured out his own salvation. He was
knocked out of the box a few weeks
ago in a charity game and the docs
shook their mangy beards horizon
tally. But Dean asked to pitch again
as quick as he could. And he's al
lowed only two runs in his last 13
innings. Good for a has-been, any
how.

CHARLIE PADDOCK, once the
world's fastest human, is one of the
critics who sincerely disapprove of
Tompleton's all-work technique.
Paddock now a southern Caliiornia
sports editor, has no argument with
Dink as a coach; he merely denies
the theory that every runner should
bo worked at full steam constantly.

He advocates a jogging formula and
cites his own case history as visible
evidence. Extremely powerful men,
such as Clyde Jeffrey, he agrees,
might get along with constant pres
sure. But not every runner is as
powerful in both the arms and legs
as is Jeffrey.
Paddock's schedule calls for jog
ging a quarter, then walking a
quarter, for two or three miles.
This routine, he argues, will build
wind and legs as good as any sys
tem known, and that, after all, is
the chief reason for long months of
practice and effort.
* * *
Trying to argue with either Tem
pleton or Paddock, two of track
dom's immortals, would be . a feeble
gesture. Templeton has had more
than his share of champions devel
oped with work and more work.
Paddock and others have grown
strong by dog-trotting. Whether the
constant pressure of hard work at
lull steam will work in every case
is questionable; yet it must be the
only solution to make Stanford the
world's second best track and field
team year after year.

Trying to argue with either Tem
pleton or Paddock, two of track
dom's immortals, would be . a feeble
gesture. Templeton has had more
than his share of champions devel
oped with work and more work.
Paddock and others have grown
strong by dog-trotting. Whether the
constant pressure of hard work at
lull steam will work in every case
is questionable; yet it must be the
only solution to make Stanford the

team year after year.
DINK TEMPLETON, our veteran J
"all work, no play" propagandist,
can sit back now and rest on his
laurels, for none other than the great
Jerome Herman Dean, oft-times ad
dressed as Ole Diz, among other
titles, has found solace in the Tem
pleton theories.
Ole Diz, known to most of us as
one of the few really great baseball j
players ever to play in the National |
League, is in the midst of another
comeback—his fifth or sixth — and;
this time he seems to have discov- j
ered why he never made the grade
in his previous attempts.
"I wasn't working hard enough," j
he has said, "and from now on I'll j
take my regular turn with all work j
'and no play."

sists there is no such thing as being
over-trained. The real reason for
physical failure, he has always in
sisted, is pure lack of work and
nothing else. That, of course, does
n't include the unexpected casual
ties such a pulled muscles and shin
splints.
Dizzy Dean's first two come
backs were shrouded with sor
row simply because his once pow
erful fog ball no longer carried
the same zip and deception. Dean
would pitch one day, get knocked
out of the box, and then have all
the specialists in that section of
the country advise a month of
nothing but rest. Dedn would rest
and then get knocked out of the
box again in another :>0 days. The
monotony of the thing was stu
pendous.
Then the not-so-dizzy one fig
ured out his own salvation. He was
knocked out of the box a few weeks
ago in a charity game and the docs
shook their mangy beards horizon
tally. But Dean asked to pitch again
as quick as he could. And he's al
lowed only two runs in his last 13
innings. Good for a has-been, any
how.

CHARLIE PADDOCK, once the
world's fastest human, is one of the
critics who sincerely disapprove of
Tompleton's all-work technique.
Paddock now a southern Caliiornia
sports editor, has no argument with
Dink as a coach; he merely denies
the theory that every runner should
bo worked at full steam constantly.

He advocates a jogging formula and
cites his own case history as visible
evidence. Extremely powerful men,
such as Clyde Jeffrey, he agrees,
might get along with constant pres
sure. But not every runner is as
powerful in both the arms and legs
as is Jeffrey.
Paddock's schedule calls for jog
ging a quarter, then walking a
quarter, for two or three miles.
This routine, he argues, will build
