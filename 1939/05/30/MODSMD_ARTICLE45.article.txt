# Tiny Grooms Teams For Intersquad Tilt
## 'Reds' and Whites' Meet Saturday In Stadium for Annual Tussle 
### 
Polishing plays and whipping their boys into condition to play a full
game: that is where Coaches Tiny Thornhill, .!im Law son. and Bon VVin
k!eman are concentrating their work this week.
With three days—two practice days—before the annual inter-squad
game in the Stadium, the Reds and Whites will be ready Saturday to show

what Stanford will have on the griiH
come next autumn —and to show
whom it will come from.-
Thornhill's first-and-fourth-string
combination has the edge from here,
j It is expected that Pete Fay's climax
1 running and tentatively stronger for
ward wall will prove a little too
much for the Wiklemen.
AIR ATTACK
These second-and-fourth-stringers
j are planning on making their touch
; downs tho easy way—via the air.
j Frankie Albert, "pilot" of last fall's
i frosh squad, will lead the attack,
according to current plans.
In practice Albert has shown no
| set-back in his accuracy, and has
i lust none of his steam.
JOHANNESSEN TO START
For Thornhill. Swede Johannessen
who will probably start the game at
j tackle, has shown well in spring
practice. He is expected to fill the
first-string post left vacant by Pete
' Zagar.
Colin McClintock, another product
! of last year's frosh squad, is expected
' to open the game at center for the
I first string. He has grown a lot
I since last fall, and seems to have the
i inside track in the free-for-all battle
for the pivot post left vacant by Tony
Calvelli.
