# To Show or Not to Show
## 
### 
BECAUSE of the better story on what may
or may not happen to Spring Shows in
the future, there has been little said on the
excellent job that Ram's Head did on Friday
and Saturday nights.
To J. P. Cahn, president of that organization
and director of the show, to the show's authors,
and to the cast, congratulations are due on
the best Spring Show Stanford has yet had the
opportunity to see.
It is unfortunate, however, that the Farm
could not see its way clear to giving support
to what was a superior job. If there is any
way to kill off talent and interest in an activity,
it is lack of campus support.
That student dramatics should have to suffer
that problem at the same time that it must meet
administrative criticism may prove too much
of a burden.
Now that both sides have been heard on
"administrative indifference," it is apparent that
some sort of a program may be mapped out
that will satisfy both parties—perhaps a "dra
matics coach" as Dr. Wilbur has suggested.
The administration is not disinterested in
Stanford's dramatics program; but it is not en
thusiastic about the student part of that pro
gram as it is apparent now.
It is admitted that good work is being pro
duced as long as persons like J. t. Cahn are
in charge. What's going to happen, however,
when he goes?
That seems like an unanswerable guestion.
Also, if student shows are to continue to be
produced, how meet the reports of indifference
to the system and the regulations that safe
guard Memorial Theater?
Apparently things cannot stand as they are.
The next move is for both sides to get to
gether and reach the conclusion that will satisfy
both—it can be done; it seldom fails in the
long run.
And such a solution would make for a change
j.n attitude that would once again fit dramatics
into the Stanford picture.
