WHEN Ex Committee meets tonight it will
have to take definite action on the tie-up
it has caused in Quad appointments for 1940.
It is almost evident that the fact that the editor
and business manager of the book each have
a possibility of making approximately $1000
for the year's work they do has in the first
place put an obstacle to objective investigation.
There seems little doubt that the recom
mended appointments will go through at Ex
Committee meeting tonight — there's nobody
else for the jobs that wants or can handle them.
However, there still remains the system.
If Ex Committee wants to act on that prob
lem, it has every right to—but not in the way
it has gone about inquiring into both Quad
salaries and appointments this year.
Ex Committee has started with the assumption
that something is wrong in both cases—per
haps there is. That conclusion should follow
and not precede an investigation, however.
In both cases, too, persons appointed to the
inquiry have more or less started off with find
ing conclusions to fit their own ideas. As a con
sequence, they have not listened to or con
sidered other views which might throw an
entirely different light on the situation. Neither
have they appointed anyone for investigation
who knows or understands the publications
set-up.
If, next year, Ex Committee still feels the
system is wrong, let it go ahead.
But first let it look at its own system of inves
tigating.
