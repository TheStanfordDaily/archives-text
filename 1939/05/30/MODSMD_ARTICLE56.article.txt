### R. L. TEMPLETON, '18 Head Coach, Stanford Track 
"I'VE conic to the conclusion this track stuff," says
Bill Hawkins just after the Terrible Trojans had
finished waxing us good for the third straight week
end at Seattle, "is all in the mind."
Bill is ;i senior who will graduate with high honors
into med school this month, and all I could do was
lie on the bed emitting ghastly imitations of belly
laughs as I thought "what a hell of a time to be find
ing that out."
Last Sunday at .supper Stan Andersen was in jovial
humor. Not only had he hit 52 feet or better three
days in a row in practice, but he also got the gladsome
tidings that the great Elmer Hackney, Kansas State
strong man who put for a new American record of
55-11 last month, had fallen to 51-7 in the Big Six,
just like a human being, and that he only weighed
207 instead of the 2(57 Andy had visualized him as
being.

But Skin's putting 52 feet and thinking it's good
for him sounds to me just like Art Docrifig shooting an
80 and being proud of it.
"You're in a mental rut, you runt," I hammered
at him over and over again, Stan being one guy that
even a professional coach can talk to like a l'rat bro.
"You ain't really weak enough to think 52 is far for
you. You just think you're that weak. Here you
want to get shot to the moon in a rocket and you
haven't even made that trip to Europe yet. And yuh
ain't goin' to either, unless you raise that rut about
two feet in a hurry."
* ♦ » ♦
r piIIS afternoon big Stan Andersen gave that old shot
the fiiiht of its life. He huffed and he pufled, he
hooked and he sliced, he landed high and he landed
low, he popped 'em up in the air and he drove 'em
on a line. But every time he put he was letting go
for a knockout to the old chin. He wore the 53-foot
line out. He hit 53-9 and 53-8 with puts he knew were
far from right so that his exasperation drove him on
to renewed efforts. He changed to standing puts to
get the feel of the old punch and he broke every
known mark in existence by actually hitting the 52-
foot line. By then he was worn out. And Wee Willie
Wohle and handsome Alan Grey were so tied up into
bow knots trying to get in a little decent respectable
practice on smooth formful putting that they had to
give up for the day.
A tired and jaded track team watched and fired
up as they saw the triumph of mind over matter, re
sults over pretty form. Even the high jumpers, Russ
WuKT and Jim Lincoln, just about to give themselves
over to the ash can, cleared 6-3 and looked good doing
it. Mushy Girard came out of the stupor brought on
from beating Cole to run a 1:55.7 880 and squawk
about his terrible finish. The sprinters ran 440's just
like they'd never read Charley Paddock on how it
made 'em burn out. Even Dick Carew did 49:6 to tic
Craig Williamson, out for the first time in two weeks
after a severe bout with the sniffles.
And once again hope was born, silly though it may
seem, that the Terrible Trojans, who last Saturday
wrecked the 1.C.4-A. as a big league championship for
all time, still could be had.
Now, what I'm getting at is maybe the day of the
professional coach's domination as a dictator, as a top
sarge if he's of the opinion that the good old common
clay pose gets best results, or as a general if he can
do it better on his high horse, is catching up with him.
The old English system, every man do as he damn
pleases, doesn't get the kind of results that bring joy,
satisfaction, or what the boys have delighted in call
ing it lately, "fun," that even the present sophisticated
American collegian enjoys. The captain can't handle
the situation, even if he is a natural-born leader, with
out causing feelings of jealousy, and get himself in
shape to do his stuff. The old college spirit has spread
itself out in too many ways to be dependable for polic
ing athletes' best efforts.

PERHAPS the whole business ought to be turned
k over to the psychology department. Only yester
day I heard a brawny tackle remark to a clumsy end,
"Psychologically, I think we'll be in a swell position
next season." I couldn't help thinking, "Too bad the
guy's got brains. What a swell tackle he'd make with
out 'em."
But Stanford men do have brains. They know that
"discipline is for the mass6s." Many are "isolated
cases." The coach's job is mainly to keep their brains
from starting arguments with themselves to prove that
they don't really want to do the thing they've set their
hearts on doing.
I only wish I'd majored in psychology instead of
law. How I regret that one and only psych class I
took under the dear and beloved Frank Angell, the
finest sportsman Stanford could ever know.
The only trouble was I had just made the varsity
football team for the first time. I didn't get around to
so very many classes. I did go take the final. My
seat was between Feg Murray and Morris Kirksey.
The big hall was filled by 300 students as I tried to
slink Unnoticed to my seat. I saw Dr. Angell peer
under his glasses and smile. Feg and Morrie had it
cooked up together. As I started through the crowded
aisle between the seats they started the class with a
horrible holler, "Hurra-a-a-ay," clapping for all they
were worth. I never had the nerve to go near the
Psychology Department again, and it has just struck
me lately that any failure amongst the track lads of
this year ought to be hung squarely on that Murray-
Kirksey peg, 'way back there in the fall of 1915, for
keeping me from getting the proper training every
modern coach should have.

Bill Hawkins just after the Terrible Trojans had

r piIIS afternoon big Stan Andersen gave that old shot
the fiiiht of its life. He huffed and he pufled, he
hooked and he sliced, he landed high and he landed
low, he popped 'em up in the air and he drove 'em
on a line. But every time he put he was letting go
for a knockout to the old chin. He wore the 53-foot
line out. He hit 53-9 and 53-8 with puts he knew were
far from right so that his exasperation drove him on
to renewed efforts. He changed to standing puts to
get the feel of the old punch and he broke every
known mark in existence by actually hitting the 52-
foot line. By then he was worn out. And Wee Willie
Wohle and handsome Alan Grey were so tied up into
bow knots trying to get in a little decent respectable
practice on smooth formful putting that they had to
give up for the day.
A tired and jaded track team watched and fired
up as they saw the triumph of mind over matter, re
sults over pretty form. Even the high jumpers, Russ
WuKT and Jim Lincoln, just about to give themselves
over to the ash can, cleared 6-3 and looked good doing
it. Mushy Girard came out of the stupor brought on
from beating Cole to run a 1:55.7 880 and squawk
about his terrible finish. The sprinters ran 440's just
like they'd never read Charley Paddock on how it
made 'em burn out. Even Dick Carew did 49:6 to tic
Craig Williamson, out for the first time in two weeks
after a severe bout with the sniffles.
And once again hope was born, silly though it may
seem, that the Terrible Trojans, who last Saturday
wrecked the 1.C.4-A. as a big league championship for
all time, still could be had.
Now, what I'm getting at is maybe the day of the
professional coach's domination as a dictator, as a top
sarge if he's of the opinion that the good old common
clay pose gets best results, or as a general if he can
do it better on his high horse, is catching up with him.
The old English system, every man do as he damn
pleases, doesn't get the kind of results that bring joy,
satisfaction, or what the boys have delighted in call
ing it lately, "fun," that even the present sophisticated
American collegian enjoys. The captain can't handle
the situation, even if he is a natural-born leader, with
out causing feelings of jealousy, and get himself in
shape to do his stuff. The old college spirit has spread
itself out in too many ways to be dependable for polic
ing athletes' best efforts.

PERHAPS the whole business ought to be turned
k over to the psychology department. Only yester
day I heard a brawny tackle remark to a clumsy end,
"Psychologically, I think we'll be in a swell position
next season." I couldn't help thinking, "Too bad the
guy's got brains. What a swell tackle he'd make with
out 'em."
But Stanford men do have brains. They know that
"discipline is for the mass6s." Many are "isolated
cases." The coach's job is mainly to keep their brains
from starting arguments with themselves to prove that
they don't really want to do the thing they've set their
hearts on doing.
I only wish I'd majored in psychology instead of
law. How I regret that one and only psych class I
took under the dear and beloved Frank Angell, the
finest sportsman Stanford could ever know.
The only trouble was I had just made the varsity
football team for the first time. I didn't get around to
so very many classes. I did go take the final. My
seat was between Feg Murray and Morris Kirksey.
The big hall was filled by 300 students as I tried to
slink Unnoticed to my seat. I saw Dr. Angell peer
under his glasses and smile. Feg and Morrie had it
cooked up together. As I started through the crowded
aisle between the seats they started the class with a
horrible holler, "Hurra-a-a-ay," clapping for all they
were worth. I never had the nerve to go near the
Psychology Department again, and it has just struck
me lately that any failure amongst the track lads of
this year ought to be hung squarely on that Murray-
Kirksey peg, 'way back there in the fall of 1915, for
keeping me from getting the proper training every
modern coach should have.
"I'VE conic to the conclusion this track stuff," says
Bill Hawkins just after the Terrible Trojans had
finished waxing us good for the third straight week
end at Seattle, "is all in the mind."
Bill is ;i senior who will graduate with high honors
into med school this month, and all I could do was
lie on the bed emitting ghastly imitations of belly
laughs as I thought "what a hell of a time to be find
ing that out."
Last Sunday at .supper Stan Andersen was in jovial
humor. Not only had he hit 52 feet or better three
days in a row in practice, but he also got the gladsome
tidings that the great Elmer Hackney, Kansas State
strong man who put for a new American record of
55-11 last month, had fallen to 51-7 in the Big Six,
just like a human being, and that he only weighed
207 instead of the 2(57 Andy had visualized him as
being.

But Skin's putting 52 feet and thinking it's good
for him sounds to me just like Art Docrifig shooting an
80 and being proud of it.
"You're in a mental rut, you runt," I hammered
at him over and over again, Stan being one guy that
even a professional coach can talk to like a l'rat bro.
"You ain't really weak enough to think 52 is far for
you. You just think you're that weak. Here you
want to get shot to the moon in a rocket and you
haven't even made that trip to Europe yet. And yuh
ain't goin' to either, unless you raise that rut about

from beating Cole to run a 1:55.7 880 and squawk
about his terrible finish. The sprinters ran 440's just
like they'd never read Charley Paddock on how it
made 'em burn out. Even Dick Carew did 49:6 to tic
Craig Williamson, out for the first time in two weeks
after a severe bout with the sniffles.
And once again hope was born, silly though it may
seem, that the Terrible Trojans, who last Saturday
wrecked the 1.C.4-A. as a big league championship for
all time, still could be had.
Now, what I'm getting at is maybe the day of the
professional coach's domination as a dictator, as a top
sarge if he's of the opinion that the good old common
clay pose gets best results, or as a general if he can
do it better on his high horse, is catching up with him.
The old English system, every man do as he damn
pleases, doesn't get the kind of results that bring joy,
satisfaction, or what the boys have delighted in call
ing it lately, "fun," that even the present sophisticated
American collegian enjoys. The captain can't handle
the situation, even if he is a natural-born leader, with
out causing feelings of jealousy, and get himself in
shape to do his stuff. The old college spirit has spread
itself out in too many ways to be dependable for polic
ing athletes' best efforts.

PERHAPS the whole business ought to be turned
k over to the psychology department. Only yester
day I heard a brawny tackle remark to a clumsy end,
"Psychologically, I think we'll be in a swell position
next season." I couldn't help thinking, "Too bad the
guy's got brains. What a swell tackle he'd make with
out 'em."
But Stanford men do have brains. They know that
"discipline is for the mass6s." Many are "isolated
cases." The coach's job is mainly to keep their brains
from starting arguments with themselves to prove that
they don't really want to do the thing they've set their
hearts on doing.
I only wish I'd majored in psychology instead of
law. How I regret that one and only psych class I
took under the dear and beloved Frank Angell, the
finest sportsman Stanford could ever know.
The only trouble was I had just made the varsity
football team for the first time. I didn't get around to
so very many classes. I did go take the final. My
seat was between Feg Murray and Morris Kirksey.
The big hall was filled by 300 students as I tried to
slink Unnoticed to my seat. I saw Dr. Angell peer
under his glasses and smile. Feg and Morrie had it
cooked up together. As I started through the crowded
aisle between the seats they started the class with a
horrible holler, "Hurra-a-a-ay," clapping for all they
were worth. I never had the nerve to go near the
Psychology Department again, and it has just struck
me lately that any failure amongst the track lads of
this year ought to be hung squarely on that Murray-
Kirksey peg, 'way back there in the fall of 1915, for
keeping me from getting the proper training every
modern coach should have.
"I'VE conic to the conclusion this track stuff," says
Bill Hawkins just after the Terrible Trojans had
finished waxing us good for the third straight week
end at Seattle, "is all in the mind."
Bill is ;i senior who will graduate with high honors
into med school this month, and all I could do was
lie on the bed emitting ghastly imitations of belly
laughs as I thought "what a hell of a time to be find
ing that out."
Last Sunday at .supper Stan Andersen was in jovial
humor. Not only had he hit 52 feet or better three
days in a row in practice, but he also got the gladsome
tidings that the great Elmer Hackney, Kansas State
strong man who put for a new American record of
55-11 last month, had fallen to 51-7 in the Big Six,
just like a human being, and that he only weighed
207 instead of the 2(57 Andy had visualized him as
being.

But Skin's putting 52 feet and thinking it's good
for him sounds to me just like Art Docrifig shooting an
80 and being proud of it.
"You're in a mental rut, you runt," I hammered
at him over and over again, Stan being one guy that
even a professional coach can talk to like a l'rat bro.
"You ain't really weak enough to think 52 is far for
you. You just think you're that weak. Here you
want to get shot to the moon in a rocket and you
haven't even made that trip to Europe yet. And yuh
ain't goin' to either, unless you raise that rut about
two feet in a hurry."
* ♦ » ♦
r piIIS afternoon big Stan Andersen gave that old shot
the fiiiht of its life. He huffed and he pufled, he
hooked and he sliced, he landed high and he landed
low, he popped 'em up in the air and he drove 'em
on a line. But every time he put he was letting go
for a knockout to the old chin. He wore the 53-foot
line out. He hit 53-9 and 53-8 with puts he knew were
far from right so that his exasperation drove him on
to renewed efforts. He changed to standing puts to
get the feel of the old punch and he broke every
known mark in existence by actually hitting the 52-
foot line. By then he was worn out. And Wee Willie
Wohle and handsome Alan Grey were so tied up into
bow knots trying to get in a little decent respectable
practice on smooth formful putting that they had to
give up for the day.
A tired and jaded track team watched and fired
up as they saw the triumph of mind over matter, re
sults over pretty form. Even the high jumpers, Russ
WuKT and Jim Lincoln, just about to give themselves
over to the ash can, cleared 6-3 and looked good doing
it. Mushy Girard came out of the stupor brought on
from beating Cole to run a 1:55.7 880 and squawk

PERHAPS the whole business ought to be turned
k over to the psychology department. Only yester
day I heard a brawny tackle remark to a clumsy end,
"Psychologically, I think we'll be in a swell position
next season." I couldn't help thinking, "Too bad the
guy's got brains. What a swell tackle he'd make with
out 'em."
But Stanford men do have brains. They know that
"discipline is for the mass6s." Many are "isolated
cases." The coach's job is mainly to keep their brains
from starting arguments with themselves to prove that
they don't really want to do the thing they've set their
hearts on doing.
I only wish I'd majored in psychology instead of
law. How I regret that one and only psych class I
took under the dear and beloved Frank Angell, the
finest sportsman Stanford could ever know.
The only trouble was I had just made the varsity
football team for the first time. I didn't get around to
so very many classes. I did go take the final. My
seat was between Feg Murray and Morris Kirksey.
The big hall was filled by 300 students as I tried to
slink Unnoticed to my seat. I saw Dr. Angell peer
under his glasses and smile. Feg and Morrie had it
cooked up together. As I started through the crowded
aisle between the seats they started the class with a
horrible holler, "Hurra-a-a-ay," clapping for all they
were worth. I never had the nerve to go near the
Psychology Department again, and it has just struck
me lately that any failure amongst the track lads of
this year ought to be hung squarely on that Murray-
Kirksey peg, 'way back there in the fall of 1915, for
keeping me from getting the proper training every
modern coach should have.
