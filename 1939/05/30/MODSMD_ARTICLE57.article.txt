INSIDE DOPE
The story that the rabble whisper around the Quad
office is that the editor opens and read the managing
editor's letters.
Now the managing editor thinks that is a black
thing to do. She reprimands the editor with lady-like
oaths whenever she catches him at this business.
But she, of course, never opens his mail. But the
other day she went into her office and saw a tele
gram on her desk. It was open and addressed to the
editor.
It is my desk, she said, and the telegram is open.
I can say I read it by accident.
The telegram read: "Sorry I can't be with you,
son. Happy birthdayâ€”Mother."
The editor is a funny guy, opening other people's
mail the way he does, but he's a nice guy, she said.
Why didn't he tell me it was his birthday?
She was going to buy him a present. He should
have told her sooner, but she would get him one any
way. As she was about to leave the office, the editor
came in.
"Well, blackness," she said. "Why didn't you tell
me it was your birthday."
"What?"
"Your birthday," she said, showing him the tele
gram.
He had a laugh.
It was not his birthday. He had written his folks
something about graduation, and his mother was tele
graphing back that they couldn't make it here for
he ceremonies.
She was telegraphing the cheap way.
And, by God, the managing editor says, if you leave
your mail on my desk where I'll have to accidentally
read it again . . .

PLAYBOY
One of the A.T.O.'s is a blind-date gigolo. Never
let a strange girl think she has never met you before,
is his motto.
The other night his mother called him on the phone.
He had no idea she was in a phoning temperament
or in the vicinity. "This is your mother," she said,
only not quite so bluntly.
"Oh you kid," he said.
' This is your mother."
"Don't give me that, line," he said. "You're that
blonde in the blue dress I met at Tiny's, aren't you?"
And she continued to insist she was his mother,
and he continued to tell her to stop kidding him and
wasn't she every woman he had met at all the spots
all year. Until, some five minutes later, he was finally
convinced she was his mother.
From whom he now has no secrets.
