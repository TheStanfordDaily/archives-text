# Women's Rise Shown in Book On Vocations
## 
### 
Bound in a style as attractive as
its content is satisfying, "Women at
Work" presents to readers a brief,
well written history of the commer
cial activities of women, a sum
mary of current professional fields
entitled "Pioneers and Headliners,"
and a list of the career tours which
are offered to visitors to the New
York World Fair.
That is but a table of contents and
cannot remotely suggest the quality
of the publication. Its articles are
written by such notables as Ida M.
Tarbell, Dorothy Canlield Fisher,
Inez Haynes Irwin, Mary R. Beard,
and Margaret Culkin Banning. They
succeed in compressing into type the
sweep of women's advancement in
the arts and sciences, the profes
sions and business during the last
half century.
In this book the name Bourke-
White means what it has always
meant: superlative photography. To
match this craftsman's skill are
pictorial contributions by four
other camera sharks. Their efforts
pooled, an cfTect is produced which
in itself would make "Women at
Work" worth looking into.
Purchased by Vocational Com
mittee to supplement its growing
library, five copies of the publica
tion are now available in Miss Anas
tasia Doyle's office.
The opinions and vocational sug
gestions in the publication arc writ
ten on good authority and readers
can toss their literary grains of salt
to the winds while absorbing it. To
those not in need of vocational aid,
the book is still valuable if only to
give an example of fine design, edit
ing, writing and photography.â€”Mul
