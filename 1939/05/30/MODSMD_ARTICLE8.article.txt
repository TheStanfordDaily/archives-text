# Heavy Seas Balk 'Squalus' Rescue
## 
### 
PORTSMOUTH, N.H., May 29
(UP). â€”Handicapped by heavy sens
and a pea-soup fog that rolled in
with a northeast wind off the Banks,
navy salvage workers strove tonight
to drag the sunken submarine Squa
lus to shallow water.
Forty fathoms down where the
ship rested on the Atlantic's blue
mud bottom, air lines throbbed as
compressed air forced water from
the flooded after compartments
where 2G men were trapped when
the ship sank during a "crash" dive
Tuesday.
A brief report from the navy sal
vage tug Falcon said huge tugs will
try to yank the ship along the bot
tom after some water had been
forced out and the load lightened.
