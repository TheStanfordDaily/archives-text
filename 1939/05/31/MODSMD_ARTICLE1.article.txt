# History ...1939

### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
PAR UP in the North in an un
known land there stands a great
rock a thousand miles square and a
thousand high. Once in each ten
centuries a little bird Hies there to
sharpen its beak. When the rock is
worn completely away, then a single
day of eternity will have passed.
* ♦ *
Each time I reflect on this little
story of Willem Hendrick Van
Loon's, I am tempted to recognize
the meaninglessness of history. How
can the insignificant acts of a Julius
Caesar or an Adolf Hitler have any
effect on the great universal flux,
about which we know nothing?
However, bringing the discus
sion down to earth, it is not the
infinite that affects us as groups
and as individuals, hut the day to
day happenings in which we are
playing a part. These events and
(heir settings in this relatively ex
citing world has been for seven
months the raison d'etre of this
column.
Attempting to paint, for Stanford,
the picture of history as it is being
made, lias led to few conclusions.
In Ihis brief moment events have
come charging at us with horrifying
regularity, most of them foreshadow
ing an unhappy future.
# * *
JJESPITE the ominous warnings of
war to come, of inhumanity and
cruelty and greed that History—l 939
has sounded, the game isn't up yet.
Evolution is something more than a
monument to futility. Today the
fate of the world lies in the mind
of Adolf Hitler, in* the signing of
the Anglo-Soviet alliancc, and in a
dozen other situations we know of
only in news print, but'tomorrow
there can be a change.
In this mechanized twentieth
century the potentialities of the
individual have been greatly un
derestimated. For every force
toward war. for every dictator and
demagogue, there can he a man
crusading for the cause of peace.
And in his hands the responsibil
ity for a world conflict lies just as
heavy as it does in those of Cham
berlain, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini,
Dahulicr. and Roosevelt.
* # *
The youth of 1939 must decide if
it is willing to make the sacrifices
necessary to preserve world peace.
More than the wild-eyed idealists,
more than the long-haired radicals
must be willing to see their broth
ers suffer. It is to the plain, un
thinking, average individual that we
throw the challenge.
Unfortunately, he probably will
not comprehend.

PAR UP in the North in an un
known land there stands a great
rock a thousand miles square and a

Each time I reflect on this little
story of Willem Hendrick Van
Loon's, I am tempted to recognize
the meaninglessness of history. How
can the insignificant acts of a Julius
Caesar or an Adolf Hitler have any
effect on the great universal flux,
about which we know nothing?
However, bringing the discus
sion down to earth, it is not the
infinite that affects us as groups
and as individuals, hut the day to

playing a part. These events and

toward war. for every dictator and
demagogue, there can he a man
crusading for the cause of peace.
And in his hands the responsibil
ity for a world conflict lies just as
heavy as it does in those of Cham
berlain, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini,
Dahulicr. and Roosevelt.
