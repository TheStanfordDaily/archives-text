# Spring Grid Practice Ends
## Regulation Game Slated Saturday Reds Picked to Whip Whites as Practice Closes for Summer 
### 
Stanford's annual gridiron civil
war is slated to break out again
Saturday afternoon on the Stadium
turf when Jim Lawson's Reds face i
Ben Winkelman's Whites in a regu
lation game that winds up spring
football practice.
The Reds, in spite of the prob
able loss of Swede Johannesson, first
string tackle, will be favored. Jo
hannesson,.expected to fill the shoes
ol "Big Pete" Zagar, injured a knee
last Thursday, and may not see ac
tion.
A backfield of Coldiron, Fay,
Groves, and Standlce should give
Lawson's squad an edge; and what
remains of the first team line, even
with Anderson, Pool, and Donahue 1
absent, will be hard to beat.
Ben Winkelman has been drilling
his charges on a short passing at
tack, with Frankie Albert flipping j
southpaw tosses to Hugh Gallarneau,
Fred Meyer, and Bill Greer.
Besides Albert and Meyer, up from
the frosh squad, several other new- ;
comers will be on the field at the
kickoft". Colin McClintock at center
and Dave Patterson at right guard ,
have been named as starters for the
Reds. Bob Crane at quarter, Doug
Stahle at center, and Winkie Jones j
a*, left tackle, also freshmen, will
start for the White eleven.
Andy Stojkovich and Stan Graff
are a pair of veteran ends in the j
Red lineup. Chick Orme is the only
other lineman who saw much action
last year that will start. Steve Keus
seff and Bill Willard top a list of
eight men not in shape to play Sat
urday.
