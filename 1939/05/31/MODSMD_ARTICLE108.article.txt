# The 						Last of 95
## 
### 
WHAT seems a long time ago, a little guy
by the name of Waldo walked into The
Daily Shack, bewildered, but wise; enthusiastic,
but bound by restrictions.
Since the day he walked in the door, he's
found out a lot of things—a lot of things about
Stanford, a lot of things about the people who
run Stanford, a lot of things about publishing
Stanford's newspaper.
Today, the ghost of the Little Waldo that was
takes a wiser but still enthusiastic editorial
board of Volume 95 by the hand and walks out
the front door with them.
What they leave behind are green walls, a
little dirtier perhaps than when they came in,
a few more pictures on those walls, a lot more
cigarette burns on the floors, a now uncush
ioned editor's chair.
But they also leave behind what is poten
tially the most competent staff for Volume 96
that The Daily has seen yet.
That staff has a lot of experiences before it.
It will find that the facts are not always what
Stanford wants in its stories and editorials.
It will find that what is in print cannot be
taken back.
It will find that people don't read The Daily
thoroughly.
It will find that there is usually more than
one side to any controversy, and when it tries
to tread the middle line between the two ex
tremes it will satisfy neither side.
But it will learn those things gracefully.
As Volume 95 fades, it leaves behind two
major problems: social regulations and student
participation in dramatics. Much has been said
on both subjects, much will be said in the
future.
Stanford, if it wants to, can find again the
spirit which typified its early history, the spirit
which it has never quite regained after the set
back it took with the rest of the country early
in the '30's.
It can regain that spirit if administration, fac
ulty, and the student body stop working at
cross-purposes in a number of small problems,
attack on a planned basis the larger problems
which the Stanford family faces together and
must meet together.
That's the way Volume 95 sees it, Larry, and
I've written just about enough to make things
sound a little ominous.
They are—just a little.
And I've written just about enough, too.
It's hard to stop pushing the Underwood after
four months; it's hard to find just the right tag
line knowing that it will probably contain the
last word you'll ever write for The Daily or for
Stanford. Unfortunately, there are a lot of
thoughts and words that that tag-line should
contain.
But they can't be written, Larry. They can
only be felt.
