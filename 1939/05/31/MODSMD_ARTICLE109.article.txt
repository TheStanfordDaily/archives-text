# The 						Changing Factor
## 
### 
WITH no further action coming to the sur
face on whether or not Stanford's social
regulations are to be liberalized or made more
conservative, something of an impasse has been
reached.
Both extremes have their points of argument.
It is difficult to understand, however, why
the responsibility for their own social conduct
cannot be turned over almost entirely to the
students.
Responsibility for individual conduct is, in
the first place, given to them by their parents
when they are sent away from home to this
University.
The University already goes so far as to dele
gate also responsibility for individual social
conduct within almost unlimited bounds. The
Honor Code, the relative absence of strict rules
for the governing of individual conduct within
living groups are both but examples.
Responsibility has been delegated in an un
limited quantity, for another instance, to mem
bers of publications staffs. They are given the
right to publish anything they see fitâ€”rather,
anything within the bounds of their own good
tastes.
Why that same delegation cannot be made
for group social activities is the question in
point.
The administration view is that experience in
the past has not shown that it can successfully
be done.
Student ideas and temper, however, have
changed in the past few years. In the early
part of this decade, students were an irrespon
sible group; they aped, to a certain extent,
an assumption of irresponsibility on the part
of the elder generation.
They don't any more.

That is why they think they are entitled to
be allowed to plan their own entertainment,
their own group activities.
Perhaps it might be tried.
