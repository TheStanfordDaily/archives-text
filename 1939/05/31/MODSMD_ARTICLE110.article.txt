# BULL SESSION

HERE IT COMES; THERE IT GOES
OARTING, I have found, is always an embarrassing
business; it is only in the movies that a character
can deliver his final lines with well-coached feeling
and turn to walk off into the sunset. In any world
but a celluloid one, stumbling over the doormat is
an unavoidable feature of a farewell.
In this case parting is not only sweet sorrow; it is
also a damned awkward problem in journalism. Three
weeks ago, I left, trailing clouds of tender sentiment,
to prowl through the back copies of the Student Man
ager's Report. Since then I have watched Bull Session
from the audience instead of from backstage, beaming
at the kind things that were said, cringing a little at
the use of the past tense. Now as I return for the
finale, I have the feeling that a good dramatist would
have written my last exit into the preceding act.

But after three years behind an Underwood, the
temptation to have the last word Ls stronger than any
sense of the dramatic; and so I return to find the type
writers as cranky as ever and the night editor's taste
in cigarettes at its usual deplorable level. After saying
hello all around, I will now buckle down to the serious
business of getting the hell out of here again.
Looking back over partings of the past, I find that
there are two fashions in them. There is the kiss-and
make-up technique, and opposed to it, the stalwart-to
the-last method. In the first type the writer pats all
the backs he has knifed, apologizes to everybody in
sight and bows himself out vowing that he did only
what he thought was right. In the stalwart farewell
the columnist saves a particularly violent bit of explo
sive for the last issue and exits to incidental music
consisting of military marches and screams of the
wounded.

I5 U T I have straddled the fence for so long that I
find no appeal in either of the extreme brands of
parting. I think the best thing to do is to sneak quietly
ofT without tinkering with the status quo. It pains me
to leave feuds unsettled, but I have no desire to be
forgiven my trespasses if it means that I must write
something that has to be served up with a spoon.
It would be nice to quit on a note of thunder; but
at the moment I can't remember any outstanding
things that should draw the lightning. Women's Con
ference, I still maintain, strongly resembles a fiock of
sheep—with ambition. The administration, I would not
cast as Little 80-Peep; but this late in the year, there
is no point in crying "wolf."

It would be nice to go over the arguments about
new buildings and the way they mutilate the academic
budget; but the ground is being broken for the Hoover
Library, and 10 inches of type doesn't compare with
250 feet of reinforced concrete.
And so I shall abandon my feuds just as they stand,
returning to my memories. On the whole they are very
pleasant memories, although there are outstanding
exceptions, like that afternoon when I moved my type
writer into the February gale that swept through an
open window, and meditated on the sad realization
that I was not one of the millions to whom Alka-
Seltzer brings instant relief.
Bull Session has followed the program laid out for
it. It has commented. It has not peddled panaceas; it
has not tried to sell marked-down Causes. I claim no
particular patronage from the goddess of justice, and
so I shall not try to defend Bull Session's conduct. But
to those who think they have been unfairly criticized,
I can quote a line I have used before: "Purity is its
own security."
