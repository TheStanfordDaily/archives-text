# 'Best Writing of Year' Found by English Club
## 
### 
"A Yearbook of Stanford Writ
ing," published by the English
Club and on sale Thursday.
Seventy-four mimeographed pages
between simple buff covers.
This is the unpretentious dress
that tomorrow will present to the
campus.Stanford's best writing. 1938-
39. Drawing nine short stories, sev
eral pages of verse, standout Daily
columns and an editorial, a selection
from Chaparral, and the prize-win
ning Ram's Head one-act play, the
slim volume will convey a repre
sentative picture of the Farm's lit
erary life. In a smaller sense, it will
mirror broader intellectual and cul
tural trends of a confused world out
side sandstone cloisters.
Opening the collection of short
stories, from which one will be
chosen for a $25 prize, is Suzanne
Macpherson's "In the Tuileries," a
fluent, well-balanced sketch of a
dreamy afternoon and a large, blond
Frenchman.
PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY
Doug Jaques' "Sweet Billy," a
strong psychological study, is easily
one of the best pieces of prose in the
collection. Beneath a light but well
handled surface story runs a com
plex theme that holds reader inter
est from the opening paragraphs to
the conclusion.
"Christmas Tree," by Gloria
Workman, is a slight, innocuous tale
that is notable for character deline
ation through dialogue.
Obviously turning to Steinbeck for
his model, Scott McGilvray em
ployed clipped, flat dialogue with
briefly pointed description to paint a
forceful tale of disillusion in "A
Man Who Tried."
In "A Room on the Quad," by
James Fullerton, a common theme is
rather patly handled. The treatment
is light and satisfactory.
DRURY STORY IMPRESSIVE
Allen Drury's "Comes Soon the
Glad Tomorrow" is a story that may
well win the prize award. Suave,
studied description create one very
real character and one rather un
steady character, slightly uncon
vincing but well-rounded. Dialogue
is a little weak and story develop
ment is apt to bog down, but the
total effect is impressive.
A short, amusing piece that races
along with well-tempered force and
an edge of abandon is Jojin Clinc's
"Plastered Cast." It's swell reading.
Her effective treatment of a faulty
and unconvincing theme rescues
Kathleen Norris' "Measure the
Wind" from being utterly beyond be
lief. Its weird beauty and poignancy
leave a lingering memory.

; Balanced dialogue and timing
combine with an episode that has
universal interest to make John
Ahern's "He Was Almost Eighteen"
a thoroughly satisfactory story.
MATURE POETRY
j In the verse selections arc poems
Iby Ann Stanford, whose verse, in
our opinion, compares well with any
j written in the country today. An
accomplished artist, her poems are
mature, lyrically superb. Suzanne
Macpherson's "Twice-Born" is ex
cellent; Charles Leong contributes
"Penchant" and "Chinese Scene"
that are slight but good.
Sherm Mellinkoff's three verses
are seriously preoccupied with the
same theme, are handled with heav
ily accented meetr that docs not
convey his point wits as much sub
tiety as force.
Gloria Workman and Jack Ahern
! add slender, light rhymes, and Art
j Levinson's "The Swift Black Stal
j lion of My Hate," pitched so much
in the tone of William Blake, is ex
! traordinarily fine.—Hutchinson

erary life. In a smaller sense, it will
mirror broader intellectual and cul
tural trends of a confused world out
side sandstone cloisters.
Opening the collection of short
stories, from which one will be
chosen for a $25 prize, is Suzanne
Macpherson's "In the Tuileries," a
fluent, well-balanced sketch of a
dreamy afternoon and a large, blond
Frenchman.
PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY
Doug Jaques' "Sweet Billy," a
strong psychological study, is easily
one of the best pieces of prose in the
collection. Beneath a light but well
handled surface story runs a com
plex theme that holds reader inter
est from the opening paragraphs to
the conclusion.
"Christmas Tree," by Gloria
Workman, is a slight, innocuous tale
that is notable for character deline
ation through dialogue.
Obviously turning to Steinbeck for
his model, Scott McGilvray em
ployed clipped, flat dialogue with
briefly pointed description to paint a
forceful tale of disillusion in "A
Man Who Tried."
In "A Room on the Quad," by
James Fullerton, a common theme is
rather patly handled. The treatment
is light and satisfactory.
DRURY STORY IMPRESSIVE
Allen Drury's "Comes Soon the
Glad Tomorrow" is a story that may
well win the prize award. Suave,
studied description create one very
real character and one rather un
steady character, slightly uncon
vincing but well-rounded. Dialogue
is a little weak and story develop
ment is apt to bog down, but the
total effect is impressive.
A short, amusing piece that races
along with well-tempered force and
an edge of abandon is Jojin Clinc's
"Plastered Cast." It's swell reading.
Her effective treatment of a faulty
and unconvincing theme rescues
Kathleen Norris' "Measure the
Wind" from being utterly beyond be
lief. Its weird beauty and poignancy
leave a lingering memory.

; Balanced dialogue and timing
combine with an episode that has
universal interest to make John
Ahern's "He Was Almost Eighteen"
a thoroughly satisfactory story.
MATURE POETRY
