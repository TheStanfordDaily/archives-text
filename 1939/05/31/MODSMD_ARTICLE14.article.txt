month early for seniors and their
partners Friday night, June 16, when
Toyon Lobby is banked with flowers,
Anson Weeks' 18 - piece orchestra
plays smooth music, and the clock
strikes 10 o'clock to indicate the
opening of the last dance of '39—the
Senior Ball.
The classic of all Farm dances will
bring an unusually decorated dance
floor, the "Dancin'-with-Anson" mu
sic of Anson Weeks, souvenir charm
bracelets, and a midnight supper,
t Instead of the usual squab break
fast served at midnight, chicken-a
la-king will tempt the early morning
palates of dancing seniors. Catering
will be handled by Hubert.
BIDS, FAVORS
Leather - bound dance progiams
will come with dance bids, and at the
door a charm bracelet gold-filled

engraved "Senior Ball, 1939," will be
given to each woman. Inside will be
places for two pictures, to be taken
that night.
Anson Weeks will bring an 18-
piece orchestra, having just finished

at various southern hotels.
Price of bids, which may be bought
only by seniors, is $8, lower than for
many years past when tickets have

make a surplus.
