# Daily Stops; Life Begins
## 
### 
We gotta take finals too, de
spite popular rumor to the
contrary, and therefore today
we start, studying, according to
informed sources.
This is it, the last Daily of the
quarter.
High officials, close to inner
circles, last night revealed that
study table will open today for
sissies.
Daily Men will gather at 2
o'clock for opening ceremonies
of the semi-annual Shack
Shakedown Trust. Poker fes
tivities will cost participants
nothing but money. Bridge
festivities will cost participants
nothing but trumped aces.
Both games will be run by as
sorted members of assorted edit
boards. Bring your own money
and your own acts.
