# Debaters Close '38-'39 Season With Banquet
## Mellinkoff Wins Kay Memorial Prize; 5 Others Take Cups 
### 
Stanford foren.sic men wrote "finis"
to the '38â€”'39 debate season last night
at their annual banquet which saw
awards made to several men for
their year's work under Dr. Leland
Chapin, varsity debate coach.
Seniors were awarded cups for
general forensic excellence. Among
the winners were Tim Hays, Gene
Glasmann, John Moscovics, and Nel
son Norman.
Sherman Mellinkoff was the recip
ient of the Ronald Kay Memorial
Award. This award is made by Dr.
Chapin to the students he considers
outstanding in debating.
ESTABLISHED IJM4
It was established in 1934 by the
classmates of the late Ronald Kay,
Stanford student and debater, to
commemorate his work in the ac
tivity. Each year Dr. Chapin makes
hLi choice and the debater's name is
engraved on the memorial plaque.
Last night's gathering marked the
end of one of the most active and
successful forensic seasons in Stan
ford debute annals. Under the direc
tion of Bob Putnam, debate mana
ger, the Indian Tour, the Hawaiian
Tour and the Medaille Joffre, were
run off.
Participants in the Indian Tour
were Walt Stoessel, Harry Horton,
Bob Moulton, and Bob Putnam.
They travelled through the Indian
reservation territory and returned
vertiable storehouses of information
on the subject.
HAWAIIAN JOUR
Although the Hawaiian debaters,
Armen Hampar and Bob Moulton,
had a little difficulty in getting off to
the Island Paradise what with water
front strikes, dissension in the ranks,
and other complications, they fi
nally sailed for three weeks of travel,
sightseeing and debating.
The Joffre debate was, according
to authorities, one of the best ever
presented to the memory of the
French wartime general, although
Stanford's competitors, Tom O'Leary,
Brooke von Falkenstein, and Sher
man Mellinkoff, did not pull through
with first place.
