Tryoutees for the Chaparral busi
ness staff for next fall will be inter
viewed by Business Manager-elect
Stan Swallord today at 1:30 o'clock
in the Chappie business office in the
Press Building. All students inter
ested in securing a position on the
business staff are invited by Editor
elect Marco Thbrne to attend the
meeting.
"This year's freshmen are espe
cially encouraged to try out for the
Chappie," declares Swafford, "as our
new policy is to start new salesmen
in their sophomore year."
A tryoutee meeting for those seek
ing positions on the editorial staff
of the humor magazine was held
yesterday afternoon.
