# Bismark's Words Sound Warning to Der Fuehrer
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Adolf Hitler and Benito Musso
lini have joined hands across the
Alps in the most dangerous alliance
of the twentieth 'century, dangerous
because Germany and Italy are
pledged to mutual aid, not only in
case they are attacked, but if they
initiate their own campaigns of ag
gression.
What this means is that the Fueh
rer can demand Danzig or any other
piece of territory he takes a fancy
to, and be sure that the Italian army
will back him up. On his end of
the axis, II Duce has something
more than his own forces with
which to threaten France when he
states his claims on Tunisia and the
Suez Canal.
To date, Mussolini has met with
unqualified success in his terri
torial ambitions; Ethiopia and Al
bania are Fascist colonies. Hitler's
campaign to build a Greater Reich
will go down in history as the most
sensational project of the first half
of the twentieth century. Austria,
the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia —
and now he is ready for Danzig.
However, there is always the pos
sibility that the Fuehrer will bite off
more than he can chew. Back in
the '90's Bismark sounded a warn
ing that the Nazis would do well to
regard today:
"When you have your knee on
the throat of a vanquished nation,

you can take from him all you like.
He does not resist. . . . But you
must always beware of abusing your
victory and exaggerating your con
guests. Otherwise you load your
self for many generations with a
crushing burden which ends by
having the most mischievous re
sults for the victor — almost more
than for the vanquished."
