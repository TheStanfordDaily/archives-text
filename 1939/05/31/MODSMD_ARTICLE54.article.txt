while in Holland last summer.
The winner was selected from the
hundreds of students taking tours to
Europe and pictures taken on the
trip were submitted. More than 500

The picture was taken on one of
the numrous islands in rural Hol
land and the photographed young

in front of their house.
Gust uses a German candid cam

Although the winner has a choice
of several trips, he will go to the
Scandinavian countries, England,
Ireland, and Scotland. Last year he
toured France, Germany, Italy,
Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands,
and England.
Gust pointed out that there is no
censorship difficulty with taking
pictures in Europe, except near
fortifications.
