# Quads Await Latecomers
## Many Yearbooks Uncalled for as Yet 
### 
"Please call for your Quads," re
quested Quad Manager Margaret
Hale yesterday. She said that a
large number of Quads, both with
and without name-on-cover were
yet unclaimed.
"They cost five or six dollars,"
she pointed out. "I don't understand
why people don't call for them." She
said that books unclaimed after July
1 would be resold at the A.S.S.U.
office.
She also announced that books
which were purchased late did not
arrive yesterday as formerly plan
ned since printers and binderies
were closed on the holiday. "They
should be here by Thursday or Fri
day, however," she said.
Books are to be called for at the
Quad office. Pictures, duplicates of
those in the yearbook, are still on
sale there, according to Editor
Frank Lippmann.
