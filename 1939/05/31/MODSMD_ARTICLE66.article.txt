Jim Stone fathered Stanford's
$KOOO boat house, financed entirely
by student funds. Designed by
Dick Spencer, the structure re
places the ancient boat house which
collapsed at 19,'18's Junior Water
Carnival on its 25th birthday.
Built in IJHU for $1800, Boathouse
Number One was used as a home
for racing shells of the Stanford
crew, as well as being the center
of more fundamental springtime
activities. Boathouse Number Two
was formally opened on March 4
with a gala celebration.
