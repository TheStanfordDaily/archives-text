MAXINE TURNER, drum majorette of the Card
hand for the '38 football season. Loup an outfit
ungraced l>.v anything as neat as Maxine, the hand
rccognized the now universal trend among hands,
signed the pretty majorette for the season. The male
half of the rooting section welcomed her initial ap
pearance at the head of the trumpet tooters, within
a week accepted her as the chief and only reason
for attending football games. Not so Women's Con
ference. which raised a belated eyebrow week before
Rig Game time, issued an edict barring Maxine from
her decorative position. Grounds: Conduct unbe
coming a Stanford Woman, the fact that she did not
attend Stanford at all. Effect: The band quickly
announced a strike, refused to appear without the
now-notorious majorette. Result: Faced with an
impasse. Conference backed down, rooters went wild,
Maxine pranced into the Berkeley stadium, her en
thusiasm undinuncd. She was the only reason not
given for the final score of G-0.
