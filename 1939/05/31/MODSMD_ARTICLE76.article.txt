THE MOST IMPORTANT advance in radio since De Forrest's invention of the audiou tube in HMitj,"'
is the way scientists described the Klystron, pictured above as its Stanford inventors and developers
present it for experimentation to the aviation world. Developing ultra-short radio waves in frequen
cies hitherto unattainable by radio devices, the Klystron is expected to make feasible almost fool-proof
airplane direction beams and thus prevent acciden's such as occurred when a transport liner crashed
in the Pacific Ocean near Point Reyes. Shown wilh the invention above are (left to right): Sigurd Yarian.
David L. Webster, John Woodyard, William Hansen, and Russell Varian, all workers on the Klystron.
