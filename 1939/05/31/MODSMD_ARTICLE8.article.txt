### 
Appio\ ing the Quad appointments it had spurned at the previous meet
ing. Ex Committee last night determined, however, to extend its publica
tions investigation through the coming week.
Last week's refusal to pass the appointments was merely a protest
move, it was explained, since they were made "under a systm which
can't be changed overnight." + â€” ;

Appointments for the 1340 Quad
are as follows:
Editor, Newton Russell; junior
editors, Paula Stephenson, Marian
Smith, Chai'les Runacres, Peggy
Herrmann; managing editor, Julia
Johnson; head photographer, Ed
mond Ducommun; associate pho
tographers, Nancy Griswod, James
Meikle.
Manager, Jim Will; junior man
agers, Jim McKellar, Jim Baker,
Patricia Adams, Harriet Leon.
Although some members sug
gested the current publications in
vestigation be dropped for the year,
the committee adopted President
H. B. Lee's recommendation the
probe be continued.
Lee quoted President Ray Lyman
Wilbur and Graduate Manager Al
fred R. Masters as saying that some
change should be made in Quad
staff organization.
Added ot the committee at the
suggestion of Chairman Annabelle
Clark were Frank Lippman, Quad
editor, and Harty Sheldon, Daily
editor. It was though these additions
would bring closer co-operation be
tween investigators and investi
gated.
