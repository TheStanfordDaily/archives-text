Although there will be an entirely different line-up thi.-: year. Coach
Eddie Twiggs still has hopes for his men. Last year the varsity had such
nun as Art Docring and Ray Watson, hut Warren Bcrl, top-ranking regu-

>lar this year, has an outstanding
record.
Stanford won the Pacific Coast
Conference, southern division, for
the singles title in April, losing the
team play to Cal.
SPLIT WITH CAL
Later in the season they split the
Cal series, winning the second
match. In April the team travelled
down south to defeat U.C.L.A. by a
large margin, and tie with U.S.C.
S;;n Francisco State, U.S.F., and
Colorado were easy victims for the

are undecided yet, but will probably
include Berl, Don Kennedy, Don
Haslett, Jack Showaller, Bud Fin

ways managed in the past to whip a
team into shape.
