EVERY TIME a guy writes his
last column he is supposed to pull
down his hair and spout big tears
immoderately in all directions. For
several reasons, we will have to
forego that procedure:
1. Virtual baldness compels us to
keep from pulling our hair in long,
drawn-out crying jags.
2. The pressure of other interests,
including starting back to school for
I six days, makes this last curtain call
: not only timely but imperative.
3. The B.A.C. has shaken off our
• varied attacks like nine ducks would
water.
4. Stanford has no championship
I teams to steal the headlines.
5. In other words, we are tired,
I sad, disillusioned, and devoid of
words either good or bad.

Looking back over the volume, we
j ran across an amazing number of
campaigns and demands which we
fostered through Slants.
A. Build bleachers on Angel!
Held, at any cost and before the
I U.S.C. meet on May 5, 15)39.
B. Have the U.S.C. meet on An
gell Field anyway and bring in
j portable bleachers.
C. Institute a Ladies' Day at
I baseball games.
I). Give the outstanding track
stars a trip to the 1.C.4-A. meet in
New York on May 20 and 27, 1939.
Those were our most hotly con
tested battles of the volume. The
results were equally amazing.
In the same order Slants accom-
I plished:
A. Nothing. But a campaign was
started in the San Francisco papers
to accompany our own. We got
seven letters — all unperfuined —
and one exceedingly alert body
| sent Bill Leiser a dollar for the
I $15,000 project. Slants intends to
turn the mystery of the missing
dollar over to the Dies Committee
| on un-American activities.
B. Nothing. U.S.C. walloped
Stanford mercilessly in the sta
dium mire after a B.A.C. crew had
! spent three days weeding the
track. Clyde Jeffrey, Earl Vickery,
and Jim Humphrey, all potential
wcrld champions in their flat race
events, ran high-school times into
a steep counter wind. Bob Peoples
broke the meet javelin record. He
was not throwing against the wind.
C. Nothing. The gals stayed
away in droves from all the dia
mond encounters. It must l>e the
way the players talk. Or the color
j of their uniforms.
D. Nothing. The faculty ath-
I letic committee, which has three
I members of the B.A.C. on its five
man roster, approved the latter
tribunal's judgment in refusing the
trip, snarled at The Daily sports
editor and The Daily, and then
calmly rested again on their in
| fallible judgment.

The power of the press is a mar
| velous thing. At the same time,
however, we got free passes to a lot
j of swell track meets, basketball and
I baseball games, one beer bust and
] two banquets.
We saw a track team, which even
j Dink Templeton thought could beat
the Terrible Trojans, bow in three
different meets to Cromwell's Crush
ers. We even saw the second-rate
j California Bears whap our Indians
j in a dual meet which should have
1 gone strictly red.
We watched California's baseball
' team lick Stanford with two un-
I canny last-inning rallies. Only the
horse polo players of all the spring
squads had any semblance of a
; championship aggregation.

JUST TO keep in training, though,
here are two predictions that you
I might remember during the sum

mer. In the first place, both Corky
Donahue and Hamp Pool may be
playing guard for the Big Reds next
fall. II they are both eligible (Pool's
case comes before the conference
meeting in early June), Stanford will
be the toughest team to handle on
the Coast.
And don't be surprised if Pete
Zagar is haunting the freshmen again
next fall with his mountie baritone.
All this talk about big Pete playing
professional football is as unfounded
as the garble the fraternities hand
out during rushing season. Zagar
already has his sponsor's job for
next year and probably will get in
a good deal of graduate engineering.
Then he will win the Olympic discus
championship for school, country,
and self. That is, he will unless some
big - mouthed professional football
scout ruins our pipe dream with a
contract like the one that lured
Whizzer White.
And this is really "30."
