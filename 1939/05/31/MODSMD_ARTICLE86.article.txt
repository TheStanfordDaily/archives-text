# Doering to Enter National Open
## 
### 
Art Doering, top-ranking Card
golfer, left Sunday to compete in
the National Open Golf Tournament
in Philadelphia June 8-10.
Doering was the lowest amateur
in the National Open last year at
Denver. Since the open is a meet
that both professionals and ama
teurs can enter, the pros usually
lead the field.
After winning the Santa Clara
County Championship recently, the
Farm senior decided to try the
qualifying match for the Open. He
came out third behind Earl Fry and
Pat Marokovich, who were not able
to go east. This put Doering up as
the top qualifier from northern
California.
