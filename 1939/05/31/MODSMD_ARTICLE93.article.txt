## ARCH JENKINS, Sports Editor Track Squad To Fire On U.S.C. Again Cards Get Chance At Trojan Saturday In Compton Relays 
### 
Every cinder fan knows that if
U.S.C.V tracksters are to be
beaten in a meet, this year, the only
team that can do this apparently
impossible task is Dink Templeton's
Cardinals.
Three times Joffrey, Zagar, etc.,
have bowed to those terrible Tro
jans, in dual meet competition, by
a mere three points in the Fresno
Relays, and in the Pacific Coast
Conference meet. But they will
have two more cracks at the men
from the South—the Compton Re
lays this coming Saturday, and the
N.C.A.A. later in June.
Though the Indian entry list has
been cut pretty low tor the ap
proaching relays, they still will have
a chance to topple El Trojan. The
main reason lor this optimism is the
fact that Louie Zamperini, because
of the row last year, has been tact
fully withheld from competition.
However, the National Collegiates
will be a tougher nut to crack. Here
the opposition will include crack
trackmen from all over the nation.
But it Stan Andersen continues to
nick 53 feet in the shot he should
be able to take the best in the
country.
And in Jeffrey and Zagar the
Cards have three more sure first
places and there are plenty of other
potential point winners on Tem
pleton's squad.
