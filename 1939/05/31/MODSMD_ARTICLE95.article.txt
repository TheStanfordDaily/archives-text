GROSSINGER LAKE, N.Y., May
30 (UP). — Maxie Baer, completing
training for his contenders' battle
with Young Lou Nova Thursday
night, looked pitiful yesterday in
three rounds of boxing that virtu
ally wound up seven weeks of
training.
Although Maxie was coasting and
clowning most of the time against
Sparmates, Elza Thompson and
Sandy McDonald, he appeared slow
in his reactions, off in his timing
and still wide open for straight lefts
and rights.
The Federal Bureau of Farm
Economics described the gain in in
dustrial production during the last
half of 1938 as one of the sharpest
on record.
