## 
### 
Biggest scientific gathering of the
year west of the Rockies is the an
nual meeting of the Pacific Division
of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, which be
gins a six-day session at Stanford
next Monday.
More than 1000 scientists and their
families from universities, colleges,
junior colleges, and research labora
tories of eleven Western states are
expected to converge on the campus
for an intellectual and recreational
week. Lagunita Court and the Un
ion dormitory are being given over
to the visitors.
16 Groups Represented
Sixteen branches of science will be
represented in meetings of the par
ticipating societies of the A.A.A.S.
These include astronomers, botanists,
chemists, ecologists, entomologists,
experimental biologists, geographers,
horticulturists, ichthyologists and
hepetologists, meteorologists, natur
alists, physicists, physics teachers,
phytopathologists, plant physiologists
and soil scientists.
The schedule calls for registration
only on Monday, headquarters at
the Women's Clubhouse, for all ex
cept members of the Western So
ciety of Soil Science, who will meet
that day.
Kadiation Discussed
Tuesday the meeting gets off to its
start with a symposium on "Radia
tion and Life," Cubberley Hall, 9
a.m. W. V. Houston, Caltech, will
open with a discussion of radiation;
John H. Lawrence, University of
California, will talk on "Radioactive
Elements as Tracers in Metabolic
Studies"; M. Delbruck, Caltech, on
"Radiation and the Hereditary Mech
anism," and Robert R. Newell, Stan
ford Medical School, on "Medical
Applications." Tuesday afternoon,
J. W. Mc√üain, Stanford, will discuss
"Recent Advances in Colloid Chem
istry"; A. R. Davis, U.C., "Mineral
Metabolism in Plants"; Henry Bor
sook, Caltech, "Biological Oxidations
and Reductions," and J. W. Mac
farlane, U.C., "Research on Person
ality Development." Followirtg, at

4:30 p.m., Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur will hold a general reception

"Vector Maps and Crystal Analysis"
as part of a symposium of the Amer
ican Physical Society on Methods
and results of X-ray structure de
termination. This will take place on
Friday.
Klystron Tube Demonstration
Considerable interest attaches to
a physics symposium Thursday, at
