# Society Grants Medal of Honor To Timoshenko
## Stanford Professor Of Enginering Is First Coast Winner 
### 
Stephen P. Timoshenko, Stanford i
professor and world-famed authority ]
on theoretical and applied mechanics, j
1 last night was awarded the Lamme
S Medal for outstanding qualities as
! an engineering teacher.
The award was made by the So- |
ciety for the Promotion of Engineer- j
' ing Education at its annual meeting j
at Pennsylvania State College, and :
j the gold medal was accepted by j
Professor Arthur B. Domonoske,
I head of the Stanford mechanical en
j gineering department, on behalf of
; Professor Timoshenko, who is at i
| present in Europe.
First Coast Winner
Professor Timoshenko is the first |
j Pacific Coast engineer to win the j
! Lamme Medal since it was estab- j
| lished ten years ago by Benjamin I
I Garver Lamme, distinguished in- |
j ventor and chief engineer of the j
! Westinghouse Electric and Manu- j
! facturing Company. Harvard, Yale, i
Cornell, M.1.T., Wisconsin, Illinois, j
! Case School of Applied Science and |
Penn State engineers have been the
previous recipients.
With receipt of the Lamme Medal, !
j Professor Timoshenko takes rank;
ias perhaps the most celebrated |
| American engineer of the year. Last j
I December the American Society of j
i Mechanical Engineers paid him trib
ute on his sixtieth birthday by pub- |
lishing in his name a volume of tech- j
nical papers on the mechanics of I
solids—an honor unique in American i
engineering annals—and by electing <
him a fellow of the society.
'That Great Teacher'
In the introduction to that anni
versary volume, tall, grey- haired
Timoshenko was called "that great,
teacher." This judgment is echoed i
by Stanford engineering students,!
who look upon him as a teaching'
marvel for his ability to pour out

and kindle enthusiasm for the highly
abstruse calculations of his course
on mechanics of materials—one of
the most popular courses in the
engineering school, although one ol
the toughest.
A Russian, born in Kiev, in the
Ukraine, Timoshenko became em
bittered at the Bolshevik regime,
left Russia in 1920 for Jugoslavia,
and came to the United States in
1922. Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company made him a
research engineer, but the enjoyment
of teaching led him in 1927 to the
University of Michigan. In the same
year he received American citizen
ship papers. Stanford brought Timo
shenko west in 1936, encouraged not
only students but other engineering
professors as well to study under
him. His brother, Vladimir, leading"
authority in this country on Russian
agricultural economics, had preceded
him to Stanford as staff member of
the Food Research Institute.
Timoshenko has published five
books in Russian, six in English, two
in German; he has had five books
translated into other languages, and
has published in addition 23 papers
in Russian and 48 in English, French
or German.
This summer he is in Europe as
a member of a committee laying
plans for a world congress of bridge
engineers at Warsaw in 1940.
