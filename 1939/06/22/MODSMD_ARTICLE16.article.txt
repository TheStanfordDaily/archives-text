# Early Marriage Advocated As Boon to Life in America
## 
### 
Declaring that early marriages are
important if the family is to retain
its significance, President Ray Ly
man Wilbur, in an address at Stan
ford University's 48th annual Com
mencement, asserted a young man
should not be expected to maintain
his bride at the economic level
reached by her father in his full
maturity.
"The dowry system or some modi
fication of it, by which parents
through gifts assist the young couplc,
has done much in many parts of the
world to hold up the family," he
pointed out.
He added that various forms of
insurance, including health protec
tion, can and will do much to make
early marriages possible.
He spoke in part as follows:
No other part of the life of the
University is shared in to the same
extent as is Commencement by those
who are not students but who make
up the background from which our
students come. This is as it should
be, for each family has joined in on
the struggle that finds its mark of
award today in a diploma. From
the first days at primary school the
family has made sacrifices, given en
couragement, and helped in the
planning that is a part of the edu
cation which we are giving to more
and more of our youth for a longer
and longer time.
It all gets back to the biological
fact that it takes years to develop a
mature human being and that man
has ideals and hopes that distinguish
him from al other living creatures.
Youth Needs Long Training
In one way or in another here in
America our youth require these
longer periods of training in order
to fit into the life around them.
When we were primarily an agri
cultural people both boys and girls
were absorbed into the life of the
family and the community even be
fore they reached what we call the
age of majority. During most of
the history of our country the fam
ily has been the predominant social
unit. We now see the movement
forward of the community absorbing
many of the responsibilities that for
so long belonged to the family. To
me the most outstanding social prob
lem of the present time is this rela
tionship of the family to the com
munity and then that of the smaller
community to the larger govern
mental units such as the state and
nation.
We can over-organize and over
centralize to gain certain objects,
and yet be more susceptible to de
struction than we are in a more
individualized society.
As more and more of our popula
tion have become centralized in
large urban areas with the indus
trialization of many of our joint
activities, the position of the family
lias apparently become of less im
portance. Can we as living beirtgs
with certain specific attributes given
to us by Nature allow the family and

its importance to diminish? Are we
not thereby in danger of losing even
our position as the leading and con
trolling animals on this earth?
Place of the Family
In so far as we know the record,
the human family has ordinarily
taken over without question the full
care of its immature members until
they were able to assist in the sup
port of the family and eventually to
care for temselves. In the oldest ex
isting civilization—that of China—
the family has had a pre-eminent
place. Ancestor worship has played
its part in holding together the units
of which the family is the base.
Whatever may be our interpretation,
we cannot deny that the importance
of the family has gone alongside of
the oldest existing civilization, hold
ing it together on the same spot for
at least 4000 years.
Now in China, and certainly with
us, we find the community covering
many of the responsibilities formerly
handled at the fireside. Some of
these community responsibilities
have been the result of voluntary
associatons, but more and more the
government is stepping in and pro
viding facilities for educatijn, health,
recreation, etc., or determining
wages, hours of labor, and various
economic conditions. All sorts of
fantastic propositions have arisen in
all parts of the world to replace or
hamper the family unit. The com
munity care of infants instead of
the home care, easy laws or customs
regarding marriage, divorce, inheri
tance, have seemed attractive to
some, particularly to those who are
inclined to dodge the responsibilities
of their own personal activities in
life. It seems, though, as if the more
we try to pass over the normal re
sponsibilities of the family control
to others, the more ineffective and
unhappy become our lives. Appar
ently there is no way to avoid the
role of affection in life and of the
relationship of affection in the fam
ily circle to happiness.
Times of Conflict
In spite of these serious if not
critical relationships of the family,
this present period in American so
cial and economic life is one of
change and conflict, of momentous
decisions without adequate or often
even casual study of the factors in
volved. in so far as they concern the
family. Women are leaving the home
by the tens of millions over much
of the day. The psychological fac
tors for children of a home without
a mother are giving concern to those
who see the constantly rising bur
den of public institutions for mental
cases. In some parts of the world
so-called "progress" is being asso
ciated with a destruction of the
present moral beliefs and the sub
stitution of new concepts attacking
the family and putting all authority
in the hands of the people as or
ganized into an over - dominating
government or state to determine
what is right or wrong.

We have seen the enormous ex
tension of human comforts through
invention and discovery. We have
used the natural resources of the
earth together with the discovery
by the human mind of the laws of
nature to build up an intricate but
absorbingly interesting matrix of
which we are so proud and in which
we try to live with full satisfaction.
But our literature, even our daily
press, is filled with doubts and ques
tions. We are rediscovering ethical
and moral questions that from the
standpoint of most happiness to an
individual with conscience seem to
have been settled many centuries
ago. Religion has taken a different
form with many peoples. One can
not help but ask what are our real
human hopes? In what do we really
get satisfaction? What is worth
while? Where does the human race
want to go? What are its aims?
What is our destination?
Problems of Concern
We as human beings have the
same biological susceptibility as do
the animals which we control. There
are biological limits beyond which
we are unable to go. We are now
finding ourselves facing some of
these limits for ourselves. In our
own country, our population experts
tell us that before long we will have
a stationary population. There will
be fewer children and more old
people. We are already in the midst
of some of the difficulties associated
with these questions here in Cali
fornia. Except for the constant mi
gration of others into our state we
would not be able to maintain our
population even at present levels.
Our birth rate is falling rather than
rising. In hundreds of ways we are
finding ourselves discussing and
thinking in new terms that have to
do with human breeding. Our econ
omists, particularly our agricultural
economists, as they look ahead are
considering these questions with real
concern.
Knowledge Can Destroy
There are perils, too, in connection
with the application of some of our
new knowledge. We can destroy the
family as well as build it up by the
use of what we have learned in the

field of medicine. No greater facility
has ever been given the human race
i than has been made available
through modern science and medi
cine; but certain things cannot be
avoided, no matter what skills and
knowledge may be developing. We
cannot avoid the long period of im
maturity for human beings, for in
stance. Apparently we cannot avoid
the further development of a great
economic civilization which demands
i better training and more maturity
for those who take part in its ac-
I tivities. We are left then with the
fact that we must take care of our
| youth at least up to the age of 20
\ or 21 in some way that will give
them both protection and develop
ment. Modern medicine is saving
many whose weaknesses or defects
, would not have permitted survival
in the past. Those persons of large
income, long professional training
and highly developed .skills are hav
ing the smallest families. Trained
| and disciplined brains are not re
placing themselves at a sufficient
rate to keep intelligence in control
! of human affairs. If we were raising
domestic animals for slaughter, just
as some nations seem to be raising
' boys for war, we could drift along
] with these problems in the hope that
I some sort of an answer would even
| tually evolve.
But it seems to me that history
teachcs us that there is no substitute
j for the family if we are to have a
' society that stands for human be
ings at their best. If our hopes are
only those of comfort and health the
' problem would be comparatively
ieasy; but since practically all human
j beings are born with what we know
as conscience, and all of us have
I something else that we call ideals,
! our human hopes are not going to be
! satisfied by material comforts alone.
! There is another element that is a
i part of human happiness, and that
; is that unless we think of others and

do something for them wc miss the
greatest sources of happiness. It is
; in the family that these qualities are
' most apt to be developed. The pray
] ers of the parents have in them the
I things that are hoped for for their
children. Only through ideals and
the desire to work and live lor chil
| dren can we expect to have citizens
| who will hold together a civilization
J worthy of permanence. Our ad
; vances have come not through num-
I bers —no matter how much we may
| worship the God of Numbers at the
| polls with majority votes. Our ad
vances have been made by some
individuals whose physical and
1 mental qualities were such that they
> saw new ways of doing old things
and had a sense of leadership that
forced them to work far beyond their
own physical needs. It is in the
University that we are trying to
bring together those of this type and
to give them the fullest possible op
portunity for advancement.
Rise of Violence
If we think in terms of numbers
alone, and not of the quality of the
individual, unconsciously we are
likely to over-emphasize the rise of
power through violence, and not the
extension of our civilization through
persuasion and education. The rise
of power through violence, based on
numbers, is a vast menace to the
world of today. Those handling such
power view the family merely as a
source of supply for those units
necessary for the purposes of the
state. The spread of this mass gang
sterism is now one of the most seri
ous threats to the life of the family
—which is another way of saying
that it is one of the ways in which
human beings can destroy them
selves and their own institutions.
With multiple family units coming
together to make up a community or
a civilization or a government there
is safety; but when we have a na
tion that, regardless of those units,
depends upon what goes on within
one brain the path to ruin has al
ready been taken. In the family
there is the inevitable recognition of
the rights of others; there is the in
evitable development of moral con
science; and there is the beneficent
presence of affection as well as those
human hopes that dwell always in
the hearts of parents to create an
atmosphere that is conducive to what
we speak of as democracy in think
ing, in government, or in our rela
tions to each other.
Menace of Gangster Government
Besides this major menace to the
family that comes through gangster
government and war, there is the
steady encroachment of the com
munity of which I have already
spoken. The modern industrial com
munity is making domesticated or
menagerie animals out of human be
ings. Our domestication or confine
ment of animals has not always been
conducive to their vigor or to an
increase in their numbers. We all
know the difference between hot
house plants and those hardy plants

that have met with the vicissitudes
of sunshine and shadow, storm and
drought. We may live to pay a heavy
price for our comforts—for such
things as air-conditioning, rubber
tires, and sterilized foods. There are
so many subtle factors of nutrition
and of other conditions that have to
do with reproduction that we may
well find that there is no stopping
the present tendency to have more
and more American boys and girls
born on the farms of the South and
fewer and fewer born in our large
cities. Perhaps in the long run this
is better so, since there is more like
lihood of the family atmosphere sur
rounding a country child than one
born in a human hot-house such as
many of our great cities certainly
have become. Our endurance as liv
ing units will depend upon the
toughness of our brains and bodies.
If they are not good and resistent,
other human beings or other forms
of life will eventually win out in
that struggle which we see about us
at all times.
Among all of the anchors that hold
the human race steady certanly the
family is the one of outstanding sig
nificance. We must not be afraid to
review just what is happening about
us. We must be alert to protect the
family, to encourage our young peo
ple to have families.
