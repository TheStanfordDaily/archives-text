# Chaplain Finds England Shocked as Values Menaced

### D. ELTON TRUEBLOOD 
The last few months "been of
f.bsorbing interest to of
:he English scene because'they have
-.larked a radical change - in the
mood of the English people. The
creat change came in $tatch and
:he temper which appeared then has
continued. The central element in
.his change is the abandonment of
"appeasement," at least Social" as the
ordinary Englishman is eOHCerned.
During the winter -tss ! general
riood was one of hopey.ta'atty feel
ing that the Munich agretertient. had
really settled the most urgent prob
lems. This -hqpe was". inning to
complacency by early MaJtth. Per
haps there is no better to or
dinary conservative English- opinion
tiic-.n the cartoons of "Pttech," and
Punch," on March one
■f tttb worst mistakes its long
career. The chief cart<H>ri for that
date showed John Bull gettng out
vf bed and congratulating himself
'ha the Ides of March Jhad come
without the fulfillment of the pre
dictions of the prophets $f. gloom.
But that was the day -flifi which
German troops marched into
Prague, and a brave lost
their independence.
Once shocked out o£ $uch com
placency. John Bull is npt likely to
slip back into it again, J&>ce March

fifteenth, talk of diplomacy has so
dominated ordinary conversation
that even sport has been relegated
10 second place. Each person talks
as though he were minister of for
eign affairs and newspaper readers
hasten to learn how consultations
with Russia or other powers have
progressed.
In such a tense situation prepara
tion for war is obvious on every
hand. I could hear the sound of
aeroplanes most of every day in
late sp.'ing. Notices about A.R.P
(Air Raid Precautions) appear on
train car? and in public places. Ad
iron il ions to join some branch of
National Defense appea; at almost
every turn.
The future is not bright in any
way .ind most Englishmen expect
war, if I may judge by those I saw
in widely scattered .sections, but al
any rate the mood of defeatism is
gone. There is no longer a disposi
tion to condone the caving of Eng
land by giving away what belongs
to others. It is hard to know whe

ther the government has ended the
teinrorizing policy, tut it is easy to
see that the people do not support
it The average Englishman seems
to h'ive decided that everything he
holds dear is endangered and he has
dec.ided not to let i:. all be de
stroyed without a struggle. The
England of 1939 may still be weak
by continental .lulitary standards,
but her people are aioused.
