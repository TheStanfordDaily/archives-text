# Grid Practice Set for Sept. 7
## 
### 
Football practice on the Farm will
start this fall on September 7, fol
lowing a ruling made yesterday by
the Pacific Coast Conference at its!
annual meeting at Timberline Lodge, j
Mount Hood, Ore.
This will give Head Coach Claude ;
E. "Tiny" Thornhill a little more >
than two weeks to whip his charges '
into shape for the start of the 1939
grid season.
Conference members also pon- j
dered the case of Hampton Pool,
Stanford guard, whose eligibility is |
in doubt. Pool spent his first year j
at the University of California, and
this created a complicated situation .
which requires a Conference ruling |
for clarification.
