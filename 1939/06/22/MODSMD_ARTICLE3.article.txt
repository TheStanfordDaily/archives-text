# Wilbur Lauds Informality Of Summer Study
## 
### Ray Lyman Wilbur 
The Stanford campus has always
been attractive during the summer
months. Until the inauguration of
the 4-quarter system it was practi
cally deserted. Now, with the sum
mer quarter faculty and students,
there is the opportunity to enjoy
one of the most interesting univer
sity experiences in our country.
The classes ar smaller than in the
other quarters, the faculty is made
up both of Stanford professors and
those from many other institutions
of the United States and and
there is an informality in relation
ships that is veiy pleasing.
To those who are new to Califor
nia may I mention the weekend
trips that are possible either by
automobile, train or bus. The red
woods to the north. Treasure Island
in San Francisco Bay, the Sierra to
the east, the Monterey Bay and Pa
cific Ocean to the south and west,
the wooded Coast Range, the Mount
Hamilton range with its Lick Ob
servatory, all offer some vacation
along with university work.
It is my pi ivilige to welcome all of
the newcomers to the Stanford cam
pus—the new professors and the
new students. We are confident that
you will enjoy the associations here,
and we know from experience that
all of those on the Stanford campus
are in for both a profitable and a
pleasant time. This is just a word
of greeting and a welcome into the
Stanford family.
