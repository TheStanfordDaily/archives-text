# Anderson Play Slated Monday
## 
### 
Peter Stuyvesant walks again to
open the summer season of drama,
in the reading Monday night, June
26, of Maxwell Anderson's '"Knick
erbocker Holiday," by the Drama
tists in the Little Theater. The play
has not been heard on the coast
hitherto. Produced in New York as
a musical comedy with setting by
Kurt Weill, the sparkling satire, with
its Gilbertian lyrics, makes a read
ing which has both lilt and sharp
ness, with such personages as an
early Roosevelt who speaks with
broad Knickerbocker accent to forge
the link between the Amsterdam set
ting and the modern quips on politi
cal situations. As usual in the sum
mer readings, the cast will include
readers of talent from both graduate
and undergraduate ranks, with A.
Grove Day tyrannizing as Peter
Stuyvesant the dictator, and Fred
Giari, Louis Hill, Charlton Laird,
James Stone, George Wilson, and
others in the supporting parts. The
play is cut for presentation, and di
rected by Myna Brunton Hughes,
whose deft and thoughtful arrange
ments have made summer readings
professional in finish for several sea
sons.
Doors of the Little Theater will be

open at 7:30; the reading will begin
at eight o'clock sharp. Because of
the expensive edition in which the 1
volume is published, of which num
bers must be bought for the occa
sion, admission is twenty-five cents.
Maxwell Anderson has declared his
plays to be royalty free for Stanford |
reading, because of his years here;
a'j. a graduate student and because
of the award for verse drama which
has been established by the Drama
ists' Alliance to honor his name.
Kentucky's highest court, the court
of appeals, hands down more than
600 opinions annually.
