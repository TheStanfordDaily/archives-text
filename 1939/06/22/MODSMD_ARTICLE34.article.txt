Dr. Louis C. Cornish, president of
;;he .international Association for
Christianity and Religious
freedom and a member of the class
f .894, delivered the baccalaureate
sermon in Memorial Church last
â– >in day in connection with the 48th
annual Commencement. He spoke
n pcirt as follows:
What does Stanford mean to us?
We remember our beautiful domain,
stretching from the gates to the
foothills. Sunshine and shadow,
la''kness and dawn, have been pass
.<nK' over it for nearly fifty years.
Some 50,000 students have walked
JU' cloisters and studied in our
buildings, and carried away vivid
oil tures. The associations of the
place, precious as they are, blend
into its purpose.
"Center of Truth
Stanford is a center of truth. Nor
> f alone. No less than IG3B degree
granting centers.of the higher learn
ing are also giving degrees at their
June Commencements.
year no less than 1,400,000
."students have been enrolled in them.
'FVev are open to all who have the
intelligence and the stamina and the
will +o go through them. Our De
mocracy puts these opportunities be
fore all its sons and daughters, and
t 5 s one of the most important
achievements of our country.
How exceptional in the world we
-ive in this gift is can be seen in a
gle comparison. Here we have
v l OO,OOO college men and women,
is against about 800,000 students en
'"oiled in all the colleges and uni
'ersities in all the rest of the world.
VTany explanations could be given:
ve are the richest country in the
vorld, life is more fluid here than
n many other countries, in short
ve are a democracy where the wel
fare of all the people is the aim of
government.
Oavid Starr Jordan Cited
Starr Jordan, one of the
greatest of our American educators,
'hirty years ago, writing in his study
the campus, said, "The twen
ie+h is but one of the many centuries
crowding to take their place in the
development of human knowledge.
Each century will behold a geat in
crease in every branch of human
krowledge, a great widening of hu
nan thought, a great improvement
in human life, as enlightened in
telligence and precision rise to be
nore and more the controlling fac
tors in human action."
By educators of Di. Jordan's time
t was assumed that enlightened
mn-pose would more and more con
trol human action; but will it? This
vas evolution; but there is also grim
devolution.
Look at three countries: Germany,
"t;.'v and Japan. Says President
Hutchins of Chicago University,
The German universities surren
dered without a struggle all that had
#iven them vitality. They were cen
ralized, and made a mere branch of
he national political system."
No human achievement just hap
pens. It is at first a dream, then a
plan, and sometimes at long last a
"eality. Kings and prophets dreamed
of the free distribution of truth, but
Jiever saw it, never heard the teach
ings given in all our American in
stitutions. See to it that your lives
are deep rooted in truth.
