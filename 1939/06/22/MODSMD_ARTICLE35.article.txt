Perhaps because there are com
paratively few people here, perhaps
because the hot weather slows ev
eryone down, perhaps because it Is
difficult for most of us to lose the
vacation spirit traditionally asso
ciated with the summer months—
perhaps—a series of other factors
that would be discoverable only by
earnest and persistent sociologists,
summer quarter at Stanford is the
pleasantest and most informal quar
ter of all.
Between the hectic social whirl
pool of spring, and the rah-rah foot
ball season in fall, the university
lets down its hair, rolls up its shirt
sleeves, and figuratively sits on its
front porch in the shade to enjoy a
holiday with academic overtones.
There is something in the air
which suggests the romantic picture
of university life in some leisurely
Middle European spot. One imagines
hearing the strains of Viennese
waltzes, and academic discussions
on pleasant afternoons over beer
and cheese.
Life of Reilly
Undergraduate life, unhampered
by the necessity for an individual
to keep track of himself among 4,000
others—as in the other three quar
ters—becomes increasingly informal,
and, consequently, increasingly en
joyable. Pleasure is combined in
a charming ratio with academic busi
ness, while warm evenings, swim
ming pools, tennis courts and golf
courses, beaches and the hills con
tribute an invitation to the pursuit
of happiness.
But to those of us who have al
ready spent a considerable length
of time at Stanford—from students
through faculty—the opening of
summer quarter has a rather spe
cial significance. We remember that
in the old days, in the first years
of the University's life, Stanford
was a small college, a place where
everyone knew everyone else, where
men and women gathered togther in
formally purely for the pleasure of
each other's company rather than to
fight through a conventional dance
or party.
The Good Old Days
Those were the days of the "hello"
tradition, of the democratic spirit,
of the friendly, natural meeting of
students and faculty members on
comparatively equal social grounds.
Stanford today, in the fall, winter,

and spring months is much differ
ent. With its growth in size and
number of students enrolled, Stan
ford has started to sprawl socially.
Its wrists sometimes tend to hang
below its coat sleeves of informality
and We who are here
during the major three quarters
often look back on the old days
with a rather wistful air, a "home
was-never-like-that" expression.
But when summer quarter rolls
around Stanford changes. In practi
cally no time at all, that old-time
spirit comes back. Groups are small
enough so that members in them
can know each other. Large classes
shrink to manageable size. Profes
sors and students alike begin to re
lax, to stop hurrying, to enjoy.life
in a much more leisurely fashion.
All in all, the undergraduates lose
that hurried "got-to-get-my-$ll5-
worth" look, graduate students find
a profitable eight weeks spent in
comfortable achievements, and Stan
ford goes back to the old days of
David Starr Jordan —when the pur
suit after learning was a stroll taken
in the companionship of pleasant
friends rather than a mass exhibition
of an academic St. Vitus dance.
