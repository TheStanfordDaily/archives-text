# Stevens Sees Lively Summer
## Director Returns To Stage Two Plays 
### 
"We are going to have a lively
summer season," said Thomas Wood
Stevens, director of Stanford dra
matics and originator of the famous
modern Globe Theater productions, j
when he returned to the campus for
the beginning of summer quarter.
"I am not showing my hand as yet
with titles of plays, since I want to
look over my material in classes be- |
fore final choices are made, but there
will be one Elizabethan play and one
modern play, and there is a possi- ;
bility that the play winning the
Anderson Award for verse drama
may be staged instead of read in the
usual manner, at the end of sum
mer."
Mr. Stevens arrived from La Jolla,
where he had gone for a brief rest
after his work of the spring super
vising the Globe Theater as it is
established at the New York World's
Fair. Memorial Hall begins to hum
on registration day, with a full staff
prepared to teach and supervise sets !
and costumes under Mr. Stevens'
direction for the quarter's work.
Both Waldemar Johansen, stage;
designer, and Helen Green, costume
designer, have spent recent months
in Europe, where they have visited
theaters from Sweden to Italy; the!
result of their studies will appear
in the summer plays, where new
ideas on decoration, materials, light
ing, will be the rule.
