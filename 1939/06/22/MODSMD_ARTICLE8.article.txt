# Director Outlines Full Quarter of Activities

### DR. ELLIOT G. MEARS 
Director of Summer Quarter
In welcoming the students who will be with us this summer, 1 want
to stress particularly the atmosphere of friendliness prevailing on our
campus. The unique advantages which Stanford presents throughout the
year as a residence university are intensified in the summer. Furthermore,
a smaller student body, and the inaction of their more formal crganiza-

■tions, have the merit of bringing
more closely together the members
of the entire community.
It is the manifest desire of the
regular staff who remain on duty,
and I believe that I may speak also
for those students who are continu
ing on from the spring quarter, to
welcome the newcomers sincerely
and heartily, and to make them
realize that we are glad they are
here. With this spirit prevailing, even
the intensive study which courses
require will not be found irksome,
and it is hoped that everyone will
utilize the opportunities for recrea
tion which the University has pro
vided.
Worthwhile Opportunities
The summer quarter here offers
an unusual and worthwhile opportu
nity for combined study, recreation,
and entertainment. The session of
nearly eleven weeks, with a shorter
period available for teachers en
rolled in the School of Education,
provides a unique chance for stu
dents to make progress and gain
time, scholastically, under conditions
which offer superior academic facili
ties. The summer quarter offers
courses in numerous subjects; the
special emphasis, however, is upon
advanced instruction. Normally, ap
proximately two-thirds of our en
rollment consists of students with
graduate standing.
Staff Is Distinguished
The addition of a distinguished
staff of visiting professors brings us
into contact with men of different
experiences, fresh viewpoints, and
experts in special subjects. This dis
tinctive feature of our summer
quarter, which should attract stu
dents, is not appreciated adequately
by Stanford men and women regis
tered during the autumn, winter,
and spring quarters.
Tuesday evenings throughout the
session are set aside for the Tues
day Evening Series, which is pre
sented throughout the academic
year by the Committee on Public
Exercises to the University com
munity without charge. Lectures,
concei-ts, motion pictures are planned
for the current series. Dr. Clyde A.
Duniway will open the series on
June 27, speaking on "Stanford's
Part in the World War." This will
