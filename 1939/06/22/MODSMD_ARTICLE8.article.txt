# Director Outlines Full Quarter of Activities
## 
### DR. ELLIOT G. MEARS 
Director of Summer Quarter
In welcoming the students who will be with us this summer, 1 want
to stress particularly the atmosphere of friendliness prevailing on our
campus. The unique advantages which Stanford presents throughout the
year as a residence university are intensified in the summer. Furthermore,
a smaller student body, and the inaction of their more formal crganiza-

■tions, have the merit of bringing
more closely together the members
of the entire community.
It is the manifest desire of the
regular staff who remain on duty,
and I believe that I may speak also
for those students who are continu
ing on from the spring quarter, to
welcome the newcomers sincerely
and heartily, and to make them
realize that we are glad they are
here. With this spirit prevailing, even
the intensive study which courses
require will not be found irksome,
and it is hoped that everyone will
utilize the opportunities for recrea
tion which the University has pro
vided.
Worthwhile Opportunities
The summer quarter here offers
an unusual and worthwhile opportu
nity for combined study, recreation,
and entertainment. The session of
nearly eleven weeks, with a shorter
period available for teachers en
rolled in the School of Education,
provides a unique chance for stu
dents to make progress and gain
time, scholastically, under conditions
which offer superior academic facili
ties. The summer quarter offers
courses in numerous subjects; the
special emphasis, however, is upon
advanced instruction. Normally, ap
proximately two-thirds of our en
rollment consists of students with
graduate standing.
Staff Is Distinguished
The addition of a distinguished
staff of visiting professors brings us
into contact with men of different
experiences, fresh viewpoints, and
experts in special subjects. This dis
tinctive feature of our summer
quarter, which should attract stu
dents, is not appreciated adequately
by Stanford men and women regis
tered during the autumn, winter,
and spring quarters.
Tuesday evenings throughout the
session are set aside for the Tues
day Evening Series, which is pre
sented throughout the academic
year by the Committee on Public
Exercises to the University com
munity without charge. Lectures,
concei-ts, motion pictures are planned
for the current series. Dr. Clyde A.
Duniway will open the series on

Part in the World War." This will
be given at 8:00 o'clock in the j
uditorium of the Education Build

r.f lectures will be given at 4:15 in

turned to Stanford after a year spent ,
abroad studying, will open the j
Thursday series on June 29. He has {
selected "Europe's Musical Dilemma |
—1939'' as his subject. The lectures |
given in this series also are open to j

an unusual and worthwhile opportu
nity for combined study, recreation,
and entertainment. The session of
nearly eleven weeks, with a shorter
period available for teachers en
rolled in the School of Education,
provides a unique chance for stu
dents to make progress and gain
time, scholastically, under conditions
which offer superior academic facili
ties. The summer quarter offers
courses in numerous subjects; the
special emphasis, however, is upon
advanced instruction. Normally, ap
proximately two-thirds of our en
rollment consists of students with
graduate standing.
Staff Is Distinguished
The addition of a distinguished
staff of visiting professors brings us
into contact with men of different
experiences, fresh viewpoints, and
experts in special subjects. This dis
tinctive feature of our summer
quarter, which should attract stu
dents, is not appreciated adequately
by Stanford men and women regis
tered during the autumn, winter,
and spring quarters.
Tuesday evenings throughout the
session are set aside for the Tues
day Evening Series, which is pre
sented throughout the academic
year by the Committee on Public
Exercises to the University com
munity without charge. Lectures,
concei-ts, motion pictures are planned
for the current series. Dr. Clyde A.
Duniway will open the series on
June 27, speaking on "Stanford's
Part in the World War." This will
be given at 8:00 o'clock in the j
uditorium of the Education Build
ng.
Thursday Lectures
On Thursday afternoons a series
r.f lectures will be given at 4:15 in
:he auditorium of the Education '
Building. Raymond Kendall, in
structor in music, who has just re- I
turned to Stanford after a year spent ,
abroad studying, will open the j
Thursday series on June 29. He has {
selected "Europe's Musical Dilemma |
—1939'' as his subject. The lectures |
given in this series also are open to j
the community without charge.
The Dramatists' Alliance of Stan
rord University will present a pro
gram of lectures and readings in
drama, and an assembly week the
part of August which will con
clude the drama contests of 1939.
Roth Quartet
The Roth Quartet, under the aus
pices of the Friends of Music, will
give six concerts: Friday, June 30,
ht 4:15; Friday, July 7, at 4:15; Tues
day, July 11. at 4:15; Friday, July 14,
t 8:15; Tuesday, July 18, at 4:15; and
Friday, July 21, at 8:15. A special
•ate of 50 cents for each concert has
">een made for summer quarter stu
dents.
Vesper services are planned for
Sunday afternoons at 4:15 in the

Laurence Frost Amphitheater.
On Sunday evenings at 7:30 o'clock
Warren D. Allen, University organist,
will give weekly organ recitals in
the Memorial Church.
University plays will be presented
by the Division of Speech and Drama
on July 27, 28, and 29 and August 17,
18, and 19 in the auditorium of the
Memorial Hall.
Thirteen Conferences Planned
Stanford will be the meeting place
of thirteen conferences this summer.
It is estimated that approximately
6,000 people will attend the following
conferences: Western Psychological
Association; American Association
for (he Advancement of Science, Pa
cific Division; Centenary of the
Enunciation of the Cell Theory; Na
tional Conference of College Direc
tors of Physical Education for Wom
en; Editorial Conference of Cali

Buckwheat production in the
United States dropped from an an

Director of Summer Quarter
In welcoming the students who will be with us this summer, 1 want
to stress particularly the atmosphere of friendliness prevailing on our
campus. The unique advantages which Stanford presents throughout the
year as a residence university are intensified in the summer. Furthermore,
a smaller student body, and the inaction of their more formal crganiza-

■tions, have the merit of bringing
more closely together the members
of the entire community.
It is the manifest desire of the
regular staff who remain on duty,
and I believe that I may speak also
for those students who are continu
ing on from the spring quarter, to
welcome the newcomers sincerely
and heartily, and to make them
realize that we are glad they are
here. With this spirit prevailing, even
the intensive study which courses
require will not be found irksome,
and it is hoped that everyone will
utilize the opportunities for recrea
tion which the University has pro
vided.

tors of Physical Education for Wom

Director of Summer Quarter
In welcoming the students who will be with us this summer, 1 want
to stress particularly the atmosphere of friendliness prevailing on our
campus. The unique advantages which Stanford presents throughout the
year as a residence university are intensified in the summer. Furthermore,
a smaller student body, and the inaction of their more formal crganiza-

■tions, have the merit of bringing
more closely together the members
of the entire community.
It is the manifest desire of the
regular staff who remain on duty,
and I believe that I may speak also
for those students who are continu
ing on from the spring quarter, to
welcome the newcomers sincerely
and heartily, and to make them
realize that we are glad they are
here. With this spirit prevailing, even
the intensive study which courses
require will not be found irksome,
and it is hoped that everyone will
utilize the opportunities for recrea
tion which the University has pro
vided.
Worthwhile Opportunities
The summer quarter here offers
an unusual and worthwhile opportu
nity for combined study, recreation,
and entertainment. The session of
nearly eleven weeks, with a shorter
period available for teachers en
rolled in the School of Education,
provides a unique chance for stu
dents to make progress and gain
time, scholastically, under conditions
which offer superior academic facili
ties. The summer quarter offers
courses in numerous subjects; the
special emphasis, however, is upon
advanced instruction. Normally, ap
proximately two-thirds of our en
rollment consists of students with
graduate standing.
Staff Is Distinguished
The addition of a distinguished
staff of visiting professors brings us
into contact with men of different
experiences, fresh viewpoints, and
experts in special subjects. This dis
tinctive feature of our summer
quarter, which should attract stu
dents, is not appreciated adequately
by Stanford men and women regis
tered during the autumn, winter,
and spring quarters.
Tuesday evenings throughout the
session are set aside for the Tues
day Evening Series, which is pre
sented throughout the academic
year by the Committee on Public

munity without charge. Lectures,
