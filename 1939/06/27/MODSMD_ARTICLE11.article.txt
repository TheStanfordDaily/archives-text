# Pacific Scientists Commence Six-day Campus Conference
## President Holmes Will Give Address Tonight; Leaders Report Progress 
### 
Progress of scientific endeavor throughout the Pacific Coast and far
western states is being reported and recorded on the Stanford campus
this week as the Pacific Division of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science opened its twenty-third annual meeting this
morning.
Dr. S. J. Holmes, professor emeritus of zoology at the University of
California, will deliver the presidential address to members of the par-

ticipating organizations tonight at 8
o'clock in the Memorial Theater. In
discussing "Darwinian Ethics and Its
Practical Application," he plans to
show some of the far-reaching ef
fects of the Darwinian theory of
evolution, especially in the social
sciences. Professor Holmes believes
that Darwin contributed greatly
toward making ethics scientific and
of greater value to mankind.
"The Neolithic Economy in North
western Europe" is to be the sub
ject of the Wednesday evening ad
dress by Professor V. Gordon Childe
of the University of Edinburgh,
Scotland. Thursday evening, Pro
fessor J. D. Bernal from the Uni
versity of London will discuss "The
Structure of Protein Molecules."
This afternoon the sessions will
be devoted to reviews of current re
search. The meeting will convene at
1:30 o'clock in the Education Build
ing. The speakers and their subjects
include Dr. J. W. Mcßain, Stanford,
"Recent Advances in Colloid Chem
istry"; A. R. Davis, University of
California, "Mineral Metabolism in
Plants"; Henry Borsook, Califomia
Institute of Technology, "Biological
Oxidations and Reductions"; and
Jean W. Macfarlane, University of
California, "Research on Personal
ity Development."
SYMPOSIUM OPENS MEET
Following registration yesterday, a
symposium on "Radiation and Life,"
beginning at 9 a.m. today in the
Education Building was the first of
the series of general meetings.
Opening speaker was W. V. Houston
of the California Institute of Tech
nology.
Professor Houston divides radia
tion into two general classes—mate
rial and electromagnetic. He dis
cussed each of the these types with
reference to three general propert
ies: method of production, the pene
tration of the radiation through
matter, and the effect produced by
the radiation on matter.
Investigations of world nuclear
physicists have contributed to biol
ogy and medicine the artifically ra
dioactive isotype, which John H.
Lawrence of the University of Cali
fornia reported this morning as an
important new implement for the
study of normal and abnormal proc
esses.
ISOTYPES PROVE VALUABLE
Concluding his discussion of "Ra
dioactive Elements as Tracers in
Metabolic Studies," Professor Law
rence stated, "The radioactive iso
types have opened up new vistas for
the biologist, and already they have
been instrumental in uncovering new
facts concerning life processes both
in health and disease. They are
doubly valuable since many of them
can be used both as substitutes for
radium in therapy and as 'tracers'
in body processes."
Other speakers on the morning
symposium were M. Delburck, Cali
fornia Institute of Technology, "Ra
diation and the Hereditary Mech
anism"; and Robert R. Newell, Stan
ford University Hospitals, "Med
ical Applications."
The first social event of the con
ference will be the general recep
tion given this afternoon by Presi
dent and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wilbur
for members of the Pacific Division
of the Association and associated

societies and invited guests. The
reception will be in the patio of the
Women's Gymnasium from 4:30 to 6
o'clock. Wednesday afternoon from
4 to 6 o'clock tea will be served by
wives of members of the local com
mittee in the Women's Clubhouse.
GROUP MEETINGS FOLLOW
After the general session Tues

day, members of the independent
scientific organizations and officially
associated societies which make up
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science will ad
journ to their respective special
group meetings. The Western So
ciety of Soil Science selected yes
terday for its special meetings.
