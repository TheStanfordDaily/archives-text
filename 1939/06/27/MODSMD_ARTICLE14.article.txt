# Psychological Association Closes Two-day Meeting
## 
### 
Movies of the Dick Tracy club, the Secret Agents club, and the Law
and Order club—three child groups—Saturday afternoon closed the West
ern Psychological Association's symposium on the topic: Contributions of
Psychology to the Understanding of Social Issues. This was the last session
of a two-day conference held here by the association.

The panel discussion in the Edu-<
cation Building auditorium was con
ducted by Chairman Robert C.
Tryon of the University of Califor
nia. Other speaker were Professors
Ernest R. Hilgard, Stanford; Floyd
Ruch, Southern California; Ralph I
Gundlach, Washington; Franklin
Fearing, U.C.L.A.; and Kurt Lewin,
lowa.
LEWIN GIVES REPORT
The motion pictures accompanied
a report by Professor Lewin on child
group behavior under various types
of government. His observations of
boys at work in clubs organized as
democratic, autocratic, and laissez
faire societies showed democracy to
be psychologically the best form of
social organization.
Democratic Dick Tracy club boys
had the most group feeling and the
least hostility between members.
Conversation was frequent and the
individuals eager to please one an
oher. In the autocratic Secret
Agents club Professor Lewin found
a more egocentric outlook, little
conversation.
"The amount of smiling is prac
tically zero in an autocracy," said
Professor Lewin. It was also shown
that the Secret Agents worked qui
etly and efficiently while their
leader was in the room but work
ceased and anarchy prevailed a
short time after he left. Significant
ly, some of the Secret Agents en
gaged in mock gun-play in their dic
tator's. absence. Dick Tracy's demo
crats continued their work as usual
even without their elected leader.
CLASHES FEATURE CLUB
The Law and Order club, organ
ized on an anarchiacal, laissez-faire
basis, had no law and consequently
showed little order. Individual
clashes cut down the freedom of
movement of the members of the
group and the final result, with no

* direction of group activity, was very
evident boredom on the part of all
members. The work output of this
group was far less than that done
by either of the other two.
Professor Lewin made his group
behavior studies at the lowa Child
Welfare Station. He came to this
country from the University of Ber
lin after the Nazis gained control
in Germany.

crats continued their work as usual
even without their elected leader.
CLASHES FEATURE CLUB
The Law and Order club, organ
ized on an anarchiacal, laissez-faire
basis, had no law and consequently
showed little order. Individual
clashes cut down the freedom of
movement of the members of the
group and the final result, with no

* direction of group activity, was very
evident boredom on the part of all
members. The work output of this
group was far less than that done
by either of the other two.
Professor Lewin made his group
behavior studies at the lowa Child
Welfare Station. He came to this
country from the University of Ber
lin after the Nazis gained control
in Germany.
Movies of the Dick Tracy club, the Secret Agents club, and the Law
and Order club—three child groups—Saturday afternoon closed the West
ern Psychological Association's symposium on the topic: Contributions of
Psychology to the Understanding of Social Issues. This was the last session
of a two-day conference held here by the association.

The panel discussion in the Edu-<
cation Building auditorium was con
ducted by Chairman Robert C.
Tryon of the University of Califor
nia. Other speaker were Professors
Ernest R. Hilgard, Stanford; Floyd
Ruch, Southern California; Ralph I
Gundlach, Washington; Franklin
Fearing, U.C.L.A.; and Kurt Lewin,
lowa.
LEWIN GIVES REPORT
The motion pictures accompanied
a report by Professor Lewin on child
group behavior under various types
of government. His observations of
boys at work in clubs organized as
democratic, autocratic, and laissez
faire societies showed democracy to
be psychologically the best form of
social organization.
Democratic Dick Tracy club boys
had the most group feeling and the
least hostility between members.
Conversation was frequent and the
individuals eager to please one an
oher. In the autocratic Secret
Agents club Professor Lewin found
a more egocentric outlook, little
conversation.
"The amount of smiling is prac
tically zero in an autocracy," said
Professor Lewin. It was also shown
that the Secret Agents worked qui
etly and efficiently while their
leader was in the room but work
ceased and anarchy prevailed a
short time after he left. Significant
ly, some of the Secret Agents en
gaged in mock gun-play in their dic
tator's. absence. Dick Tracy's demo
crats continued their work as usual
even without their elected leader.
