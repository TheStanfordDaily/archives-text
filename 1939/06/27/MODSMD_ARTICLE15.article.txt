W/ANDERING along the cloisters
of the Quad between spring and
summer quarters, trying to find out
what my grades were going to be
before allowing professors suffi
cient time to read the finals, the
melancholy emptiness of the de
populated sandstone combined with
the nostalgia of student good-byes
to conjure up a somewhat imagina
tive vision.
Fantastic perhaps, but not incon
gruous, was the picture I saw of
brown-robed friars strolling slowly
in the shadows of the arches, deep
in meditation or turning occasion
ally to contemplate the glistening
brilliance of the facade of the Me
morial Church. It was not the sen
timental Victorian Revival picture
they saw, but the awful severity of
true Byzantine mosaic like that
which decorated the monasteries of
the early Middle Ages.
Just what this vision meant is dif
ficult to say. It may have been the
combination of the effects of a
fiercely brilliant sun and the Senior
Ball the night before. It may have
been a flight made in sheer exu
berance by a mind set free from the
discipline of final examinations.
But rather, I choose to think that
it was merely a valid reflection upon
a tendency exhibited by universities
in general and Stanford in particu
lar. The life of the college student
and of the professor is comparable
in many ways to the monastic exist
ence that produced the saints and
scholars of medieval times.
Here, on the Farm, we are able to
watch the stream of the moving
world flowing past us at the other
end of Palm Drive. The successes
and failures of these years we live
are paraded before our reviewing
stand, and we have an opportunity
to study them objectively, without
emotion, so that we may live more
wisely in that actual world.
Rising from the table where he
was working on the painful detail of
an illuminated manuscript, the me
dieval friar would walk to the open
window and gaze down at the busy
market-place at the foot of the hill.
Even so does the 20t.h century stu
dent observe the follies of a quickly
changing civilization from his ivory
tower.
This attitude, this ability to ex
amine life through a microscope is
perhaps the most important of the
intangibles to be gained from a uni
versity training. But it presents
dangers so great that they easily
can outweigh advantages it offers.
No matter how impersonal, how
scientific the outlook that is devel
oped, it must be remembered that
it is meant to serve as equipment for
the business of living in a world full
of personalities and prejudices. If
in concentrating on the method we
ignore the material to which we are

going to apply it, we are defeating
our own ends.
In addition to being scholarly and
mastering books, it is necessary to
be conscious at all times of the men
and women around us to learn to
understand them, and to get along
with them, even if our ideas clash.
Furthermore, it is important to
know what is happening in the world
outside of Stanford, to realize that
the world is moving forward, even
though we seem to be standing still.
To be able to capture these two
ideas—wise, thoughtful, scientific
observation, free from emotion and
prejudice and an understanding of
the personalities and events that
surround us—is to possess the best
that a higher education can give.
Stanford has these things to offer
its students. They have only to seize
both in balanced amounts to grasp
the equipment for success.
