# Geise Studies Life of Cells
## Scholarship Awarded Stanford Scientist 
### 
Effects of the sun's rays on living
cells, well known to be both bene
ficial and harmful, are the subject
of studies by Dr. Arthur C. Geise,
assistant professor of biology, which
will take him to Holland for a year's
study on a Rockefeller Foundation
scholarship.
For the past three years Professor
Geise has been studying the effects
of ultraviolet rays of sunlight on
building up of cells. His study in
Holland will be on the other side of
the problem, the destructive effects.
In recent years biologists have
come to understand a great deal of
the beneficial as well as the harm
ful effects of the sun's ultraviolet
rays; but Dr. Geise's study is con
cerned with how the cells are af
fected. The manner in which the
rays influence cells is the problem
with which he is working. He has
already made some discoveries of
potential significance and declared
that medical science needs to know
more about how ultraviolet rays of
different intensity affect the cells.
Experimenting with sperm cells
of sea urchins and ocean worms, he
found that cell nuclei are immensely
more sensitive to the rays than is
the cytoplasm. Dr. Geise hopes to
find out more about how different
wave lengths and dosages of different
intensity affect the different parts
and functions of the cell.
Cells of a wide diversity of differ
ent animals show similar reaction to
ultraviolet rays, he said his studies
here showed. That is, the effect of
ultraviolet rays is apparently fun
damental to all animal cell life.
