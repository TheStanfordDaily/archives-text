Dr. Harlen Martin Adams, acting in
structor in the School of Education in
the summer quarters of '37, '38 and
'39 and spring of '37. Dr. Adams,
originally from the saintly hills and
vales of Utah (8.A., Brigham Young
University, 1925) will be associate
professor of English, in charge of
speech and dramatics. Following a
number of years' experience teach- ■
ing in Utah high schools, he has
been, since 1935, instructor and
counselor at Menlo School and
Junior College.

School of Education buzzed dur
ing registration time, not only with
students getting their courses lined
up for the Ph.D., Ed.D., Master's
and so forth, but also wtih a galaxy
of special activities and services.
One could in a trice sign up for the
weekly education luncheons, the
softball league (if one were a male),
the picnic at Los Altos Country Club
next Friday night, and so on far
into the night. You pays your little
fee and takes your choices.
♦ * *
That picnic is expected to mark
an exodus from the campus of
just about the entire school—fac
ulty, students, faculty wives, stu
dents' wives, lock, stock and bar
rel. Former summer students
know it as a time of jollification,
for the Dean and Mrs. Kefauver
show everybody a good time.
Transportation will be provided
for everyone who left his automo
bile back home for the family to
use during the summer.
* * *
First luncheon of the Education
Club will be July 6. Dr. Ell wood
Patterson Cubberley, dean emeri
tus, and Dean Kefauver will speak.
Place is the Union dining room. Al
together there will be six lunch
eons during the quarter.
♦ * *
The School of Education has em
barked on a new venture this sum
mer, which may, for one thing, solve
the problem of students whose fam
ilies are with them. Children may
enroll, at a reduced rate, in the new
summer classes for elementary and
high school pupils. Information
is available at the Edubation office.
With children taken care of, Father
will be freer to study and Mother to
shop and sight-see. And of course
it will be grand for the kiddies.
♦ * »
Speaking of softball, an ambitious
member of the School has actually
written a book on the subject and it
is filed in the Education library. Au
thor is C. B. Kennedy; title, "All
Bull and a Yard Wide." This au
thoritative opus on the Stanford edu
cators' type of softball relieves a

possible anxiety on the part of
newcomers who want to get in the
swim by pointing out that a knowl
edge of the rules, while helpful, is
not a prerequisite. Ability to out
talk umpires and opponents, how
ever, is an important factor in get
ting beyond the bench-warming
staep.

Softball is firmly entrenched as
an integral part of the pedagogical
program at Stanford's summer ses
sions. No less than 8 or 10 teams
are in process of organization, said
Dr. Harold C. Hand, described as
self-appointed Czar of the ball
swatting fraternity. In his pro
motion efforts he says softball "af
fords a welcomed catharsis to
overworked male students punch
drunk from the overdoses of class
room anaesthetics which will be
doled out daily by the professors.

School of Education buzzed dur

students getting their courses lined
up for the Ph.D., Ed.D., Master's
and so forth, but also wtih a galaxy
of special activities and services.
One could in a trice sign up for the
weekly education luncheons, the
softball league (if one were a male),
the picnic at Los Altos Country Club
next Friday night, and so on far
into the night. You pays your little
fee and takes your choices.

That picnic is expected to mark
an exodus from the campus of
just about the entire school—fac
ulty, students, faculty wives, stu
dents' wives, lock, stock and bar
rel. Former summer students
know it as a time of jollification,
for the Dean and Mrs. Kefauver
show everybody a good time.
Transportation will be provided
for everyone who left his automo
bile back home for the family to
use during the summer.

First luncheon of the Education
Club will be July 6. Dr. Ell wood

barked on a new venture this sum

the problem of students whose fam
ilies are with them. Children may
enroll, at a reduced rate, in the new

Speaking of softball, an ambitious

written a book on the subject and it
is filed in the Education library. Au
thor is C. B. Kennedy; title, "All
Bull and a Yard Wide." This au
thoritative opus on the Stanford edu
cators' type of softball relieves a

possible anxiety on the part of
newcomers who want to get in the
swim by pointing out that a knowl
edge of the rules, while helpful, is
not a prerequisite. Ability to out
talk umpires and opponents, how
ever, is an important factor in get

Softball is firmly entrenched as
an integral part of the pedagogical
program at Stanford's summer ses

are in process of organization, said
