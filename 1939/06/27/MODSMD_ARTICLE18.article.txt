# INDIAN SUMMER

ling's shouting and tumult has
died. And even if our hearts are less
contrite than academically sun
burned, we are rather pleasantly
settling down to a not-dull-but
quiescent Indian Summer. There is
no yell leader to generate spirit,
and even if there were he would find
a too-self-satisfied rooting section in
Suns of the Stanford Red.
An aging ten days ago I was
caught like my Stanford brethren
in the sleepless and nervous week
of finals, and I rather enjoyed the
excitement, if not its personalized
results. That was typical of a year
ful of a thousand sundry "activi
ties," with study and appertinent
scholars as a not too omnipresent
background. And then when three
fourths of Stanford's friends left,
and with them the Souza-like hulla
baloo, many of us felt a sleepy mel
ancholy, like the left-behind at Wai
kiki. The separately-lived events of
Stanford's orthodox 210 days were
forming a single flow of recollec
tions, and contrasted with the pros
pect of a thinned and sunned uni
versity, the memory made us hope
—although I am sure the Psycho
logical Convention is finding a much
more intricate explanation even
now.
But since Stanford's most sooth
ing schedule and new women at
Roble have settled down upon us, I
for one am enjoying the Farm in a
new and mellow way: the forti
tude of my labs mingles smoothly
with the absence of a distracting
hierarchy of glittering and noisy
collegianisms. And I have the feel
ing that other vacation-cheated
Stanfordites are finding the deleted
whirr conducive to relaxation. Ad
mittedly this is especially true with
the City and Roble not too far away.
And of course we are probably en
joying these balmied academic days
partially because we have already
decided to be here: where there is a
will, there is always rationalization.
* * *
B" T nevertheless the rationaliza
tion has rather convinced most of
us and we venture to claim that sum
mer schooling will compete favor
ably with San Francisco five days a
week, with its own pleasing admix
ture of concerts and jolly-ups, and
without any oppressive feelings of
scholastic tyranny — at least until
midquarters. There surely can be
no doubt that this is not the Stan
ford that alone rooms in the memo
ries of 80 per cent of Stanford men,
and a fair unfair number of Stan
ford women. But it is a different j
Stanford that is not without its re
semblances to a real university, and
not lacking in an attractive tempo
rary seclusion from the nerves of j
collegiate roar. Some may miss the 1
unintentional satires staged by var
ious groups in the regular univer
sity, not to mention anyone in par
ticular lest we mention ourselves.
And some may miss a crowded Eng

'lish corner and the mass-congrega
tion of the Stanford Union's vic
tims for sociability and over-expen
sive tomato juice. But visiting or new
students, professors, and hangers
on like myself will probably think of
things missed when we begin more
usual activity in September.
Yes, I enjoyed the shouting and
the tumult, but now that it has died,
and the rah-rah and the nerves de
part, I am finding a temporary grati
fication in a peaceful but occupying
Stanford. Schopenhauer said that
we make ourselves busy to forget
the essential morbidity of living.
Philosophically we might agree, but
practically it's a terrible shame that
instead of indigestion Schopenhauer
couldn't have had a light schedule
at Stanford during one of the Farm's
best "Indian Summers."

Yes, I enjoyed the shouting and
the tumult, but now that it has died,
and the rah-rah and the nerves de
part, I am finding a temporary grati
fication in a peaceful but occupying
Stanford. Schopenhauer said that
we make ourselves busy to forget
the essential morbidity of living.
Philosophically we might agree, but
practically it's a terrible shame that
instead of indigestion Schopenhauer
couldn't have had a light schedule
at Stanford during one of the Farm's

ling's shouting and tumult has
died. And even if our hearts are less
contrite than academically sun
burned, we are rather pleasantly
settling down to a not-dull-but
quiescent Indian Summer. There is
no yell leader to generate spirit,
and even if there were he would find
a too-self-satisfied rooting section in
Suns of the Stanford Red.
An aging ten days ago I was
caught like my Stanford brethren
in the sleepless and nervous week
of finals, and I rather enjoyed the
excitement, if not its personalized
results. That was typical of a year
ful of a thousand sundry "activi
ties," with study and appertinent
scholars as a not too omnipresent
background. And then when three
fourths of Stanford's friends left,
and with them the Souza-like hulla
baloo, many of us felt a sleepy mel
ancholy, like the left-behind at Wai
kiki. The separately-lived events of
Stanford's orthodox 210 days were
forming a single flow of recollec
tions, and contrasted with the pros
pect of a thinned and sunned uni
versity, the memory made us hope
—although I am sure the Psycho
logical Convention is finding a much
more intricate explanation even
now.
But since Stanford's most sooth
ing schedule and new women at
Roble have settled down upon us, I
for one am enjoying the Farm in a
new and mellow way: the forti
tude of my labs mingles smoothly
with the absence of a distracting
hierarchy of glittering and noisy
collegianisms. And I have the feel
ing that other vacation-cheated
Stanfordites are finding the deleted
whirr conducive to relaxation. Ad
mittedly this is especially true with
the City and Roble not too far away.
And of course we are probably en
joying these balmied academic days
partially because we have already
decided to be here: where there is a
will, there is always rationalization.

B" T nevertheless the rationaliza
tion has rather convinced most of
us and we venture to claim that sum
