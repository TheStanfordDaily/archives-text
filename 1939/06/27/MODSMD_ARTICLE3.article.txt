# Chaplain Flays Endless Strain
## Trueblood Scores Lack of Security 
### 
'The ordeal of this generation is
that of living in a time of unending
strain which modern inventions, es
pecially the airplane, help to pro
duce," asserted Dr. D. Elton True
blood, University chaplain, in his
sermon in Memorial Church Sun
day.
Emphasizing the apparent rapid
ity with which contemporary litera
ture becomes antiquated, Dr. True
blood explained how "our rapidly
changing world has made that which
seemed so important at the time
only trivial a short while later."
'There are many aspects of the
change which 10 years has brought,
the chaplain observed, "but per
haps the most startling is the com
plete loss of security which millions
have suffered. It is, of course, the
children who suffer most bitterly."
Dr. Trueblood contrasted the evil
done by natural forces with that
which is man-made, declaring that
"when the earth trembles, it does
not think about clever ways of tor
turing its victims. Earthquakes do
not produce concentration camps."
"The sober truth is that our most
prized inventions have come too
soon in human history. Children, as
we are, have been given weapons
before they are disciplined enough
to use them safely. The time is
bound to come when the oceans
will be little better barriers than is
the English Channel today," assert
ed Dr. Trueblood in referring to the
possibility of America's isolation
from world affairs.
