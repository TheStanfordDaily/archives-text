# Meats Sees Continuance Of Far Eastern Conflict
## 
### ELIOT G. MEARS Director, Summer Quarter 
(Editor's Note: Dr. Mears, who returned to the campus recently fol
lowing a two months' trip to the Orient, today presents some of his views
concerning the Sino-Japanese war.)

The Far Eastern situation is exceedingly confused and complicated.
Not only are the issues difficult to unravel but also the conflicting propa
ganda from Chinese, Japanese, Soviet, and British sources often leaves one
at a loss to know what to believe. Then there is the wide diversity of

►opinion expressed by foreign resi
dents who interpret identical hap
penings so differently.
There is a real point to the story
of the editor of a New York daily
who cabled his Shanghai corre
spondent to report immediately "the
bottom facts on China." The sens
ible reply was, "There are no facts,
and there is no bottom." Press re
ports from the interior are particu
larly unreliable owing to heavy cen
sorship and the few neutrals there.
I found no evidences of an early
cessation of hostilities in Eastern
Asia. Every indication points the
other way. Japan is quiet, surpris
ingly few soldiers are seen, yet the
people with whom I talked were re
signed to a long period of unsettle
ment. A former student of mine
stated that the Japanese press was
stressing the present stage in China
as one of reconstruction, while "the
next war" was responsible for the
many and increasing measures of
governmental control of foreign im
ports, currency restrictions, price
setting, and other devices of an em
ergency or military nature.
STIFF COMPETITION MET
This viewpoint was expressed by
other well-informed Japanese. The
unanticipated stiff operations of the
Chinese forces in North China and
the prolonged military operations in
Asia since then have been respon
sible for these current press reports.
The military is in virtual control in
Japan proper, absolutely so on the
mainland, while the liberal forces in
the universities and elsewhere are
not vocal.
Last month the feeling toward the
British was bitter, more so than


DR. ELIOT G. MEARS
toward any country not
the Soviet Union. In her desire to
dominate Eastern Asia, Japan right
ly regards the British Empire as her
chief stumbling block, for the in
terests of the latter are far greater
than those of any other Power. The
attitude toward the Chinese was less
bitter than I had expected to find,
but Chiang Kai-shek is universally
hated for his role as the outstanding
personal antagonist to their impe
rial designs.
The terrible air bombings at
Chungking which killed an estimat
ed 7000 helpless civilians were mere
ly another attempt to kill the Mar
shall, since he is without question
the rallying point for the recent ad
vances in China's internal patriotism
and progress.
CHINESE MORALE BETTER
The majority.of the people with
whom I talked at Peking and Tient
sin appeared confident of an ulti
mate Chinese victory. My inform
ants were mainly Americans and
Europeans, especially English, and a
few Chinese. In their opinion, the
period necessary before the Chinese
could make any strong resistance
varied greatly, with a year and a
half as the minimum period before
Chiang's forces would became
formidable in open battle.
An important feature in the sit
uation is that each successive air
raid seems to improve the internal
co-ordination and spirit of the Chi
nese forces who are engaged in
widespread and increasingly suc
cessful guerilla tactics.
The Japanese are in firm control
of the main railways and leading i
coast cities which provided the ar
teries of Asian trade, yet the pres
ence of irregular Chinese troops,
sometimes within a mile or two of
these lines as well as in all occupied
cities, presents a very difficult mili
tary situation.
For example, no foreigner now 1
ventures more than four miles out
side Shanghai, the greatest commer
cial and financial center, or beyond
the Summer Palace, 12 miles outside
Peking. The Chinese seem to believe
that the existence of their vast
population, estimated at over 400,-
000,000 of whom at least 40,00,000 are
on trek, and-the passage of time are
favorable factors which will make
their final victory sure.
There are many indications that
the Japanese are anxious to secure
an early peace. It is hard, however,
to envisage any real basis of nego
tiation. The powerful dominance of
the military clique, which overshad
ows all Japanese policies of the
present and immediate future, gives
no indication of diminishing influ
ence—in fact, the trend appear to
be running in their favor owing to

'the critical position of Japan in world
politics.
JAPAN STIFFENS POLICY
The recent incident at Tientsin,
when four Chinese were alleged by
the Japanese military to be the as
sassins of 1 a local Chinese official,
has now developed inot a major is
sue. This outcome was greatly fear
ed by numerous British and Amer
ican business men. Despite some
loss of prestige which the British
would have suffered had they agreed
to surrender these refugees to the
local authorities this affair was
deemed by many residents as of far
less significance than the flagrant
attacks upon British officials, civil
ians, property, and ships.
The temper of the Japanese au
thorities at Tokyo and Tientsin was
unmistakable. The foreign nationals
were fully aware that there are
left in China only nine of the
twenty-nine national concessions
existing there 25 years ago.

Last month the feeling toward the

toward any country not

terests of the latter are far greater
than those of any other Power. The
attitude toward the Chinese was less
bitter than I had expected to find,
but Chiang Kai-shek is universally
hated for his role as the outstanding
personal antagonist to their impe
rial designs.
The terrible air bombings at
Chungking which killed an estimat

the rallying point for the recent ad

and progress.
CHINESE MORALE BETTER
The majority.of the people with
whom I talked at Peking and Tient
sin appeared confident of an ulti
mate Chinese victory. My inform
ants were mainly Americans and
Europeans, especially English, and a
few Chinese. In their opinion, the
period necessary before the Chinese
could make any strong resistance
varied greatly, with a year and a
half as the minimum period before
Chiang's forces would became
formidable in open battle.
An important feature in the sit
uation is that each successive air
raid seems to improve the internal
co-ordination and spirit of the Chi
nese forces who are engaged in
widespread and increasingly suc
cessful guerilla tactics.
The Japanese are in firm control
of the main railways and leading i
coast cities which provided the ar
teries of Asian trade, yet the pres
ence of irregular Chinese troops,
sometimes within a mile or two of
these lines as well as in all occupied
cities, presents a very difficult mili
tary situation.
For example, no foreigner now 1
ventures more than four miles out
side Shanghai, the greatest commer
cial and financial center, or beyond
the Summer Palace, 12 miles outside
Peking. The Chinese seem to believe
that the existence of their vast
population, estimated at over 400,-
000,000 of whom at least 40,00,000 are
on trek, and-the passage of time are
favorable factors which will make
their final victory sure.
There are many indications that
the Japanese are anxious to secure
an early peace. It is hard, however,
to envisage any real basis of nego
tiation. The powerful dominance of
the military clique, which overshad
ows all Japanese policies of the
present and immediate future, gives
no indication of diminishing influ
ence—in fact, the trend appear to
be running in their favor owing to

'the critical position of Japan in world
politics.

JAPAN STIFFENS POLICY
The recent incident at Tientsin,
when four Chinese were alleged by
the Japanese military to be the as
sassins of 1 a local Chinese official,
has now developed inot a major is
sue. This outcome was greatly fear
ed by numerous British and Amer
ican business men. Despite some
loss of prestige which the British
would have suffered had they agreed
to surrender these refugees to the
local authorities this affair was
deemed by many residents as of far
less significance than the flagrant
attacks upon British officials, civil
ians, property, and ships.
The temper of the Japanese au
thorities at Tokyo and Tientsin was
unmistakable. The foreign nationals
were fully aware that there are
left in China only nine of the
twenty-nine national concessions
existing there 25 years ago.
(Editor's Note: Dr. Mears, who returned to the campus recently fol
lowing a two months' trip to the Orient, today presents some of his views
concerning the Sino-Japanese war.)

The Far Eastern situation is exceedingly confused and complicated.
Not only are the issues difficult to unravel but also the conflicting propa
ganda from Chinese, Japanese, Soviet, and British sources often leaves one
at a loss to know what to believe. Then there is the wide diversity of

►opinion expressed by foreign resi
dents who interpret identical hap
penings so differently.
There is a real point to the story
of the editor of a New York daily
who cabled his Shanghai corre
spondent to report immediately "the
bottom facts on China." The sens
ible reply was, "There are no facts,
and there is no bottom." Press re
ports from the interior are particu
larly unreliable owing to heavy cen
sorship and the few neutrals there.
I found no evidences of an early
cessation of hostilities in Eastern
Asia. Every indication points the
other way. Japan is quiet, surpris
ingly few soldiers are seen, yet the
people with whom I talked were re
signed to a long period of unsettle
ment. A former student of mine
stated that the Japanese press was
stressing the present stage in China
as one of reconstruction, while "the
next war" was responsible for the
many and increasing measures of
governmental control of foreign im
ports, currency restrictions, price
setting, and other devices of an em
ergency or military nature.
STIFF COMPETITION MET
This viewpoint was expressed by
other well-informed Japanese. The
unanticipated stiff operations of the
Chinese forces in North China and
the prolonged military operations in
Asia since then have been respon
sible for these current press reports.
The military is in virtual control in
Japan proper, absolutely so on the
mainland, while the liberal forces in
the universities and elsewhere are
not vocal.
Last month the feeling toward the
British was bitter, more so than


DR. ELIOT G. MEARS
toward any country not
the Soviet Union. In her desire to
dominate Eastern Asia, Japan right
ly regards the British Empire as her
chief stumbling block, for the in
terests of the latter are far greater
than those of any other Power. The
attitude toward the Chinese was less
bitter than I had expected to find,
but Chiang Kai-shek is universally
hated for his role as the outstanding
personal antagonist to their impe
rial designs.
The terrible air bombings at
Chungking which killed an estimat
ed 7000 helpless civilians were mere
ly another attempt to kill the Mar
shall, since he is without question
the rallying point for the recent ad
vances in China's internal patriotism
and progress.
CHINESE MORALE BETTER
The majority.of the people with
whom I talked at Peking and Tient
sin appeared confident of an ulti
mate Chinese victory. My inform
ants were mainly Americans and
Europeans, especially English, and a
few Chinese. In their opinion, the
period necessary before the Chinese
could make any strong resistance
varied greatly, with a year and a
half as the minimum period before
Chiang's forces would became
formidable in open battle.
An important feature in the sit
uation is that each successive air
raid seems to improve the internal
co-ordination and spirit of the Chi
nese forces who are engaged in
widespread and increasingly suc
cessful guerilla tactics.
The Japanese are in firm control
of the main railways and leading i
coast cities which provided the ar
teries of Asian trade, yet the pres
ence of irregular Chinese troops,
sometimes within a mile or two of
these lines as well as in all occupied
cities, presents a very difficult mili
tary situation.
For example, no foreigner now 1
ventures more than four miles out
side Shanghai, the greatest commer
cial and financial center, or beyond
the Summer Palace, 12 miles outside
Peking. The Chinese seem to believe
that the existence of their vast
population, estimated at over 400,-
000,000 of whom at least 40,00,000 are
on trek, and-the passage of time are
favorable factors which will make
their final victory sure.
There are many indications that
the Japanese are anxious to secure
an early peace. It is hard, however,
to envisage any real basis of nego
tiation. The powerful dominance of
the military clique, which overshad
ows all Japanese policies of the
present and immediate future, gives
no indication of diminishing influ
ence—in fact, the trend appear to
be running in their favor owing to

'the critical position of Japan in world
