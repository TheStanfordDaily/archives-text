### ELIOT G. MEARS Director, Summer Quarter 
(Editor's Note: Dr. Mears, who returned to the campus recently fol
lowing a two months' trip to the Orient, today presents some of his views
concerning the Sino-Japanese war.)

The Far Eastern situation is exceedingly confused and complicated.
Not only are the issues difficult to unravel but also the conflicting propa
ganda from Chinese, Japanese, Soviet, and British sources often leaves one
at a loss to know what to believe. Then there is the wide diversity of

►opinion expressed by foreign resi
dents who interpret identical hap
penings so differently.
There is a real point to the story
of the editor of a New York daily
who cabled his Shanghai corre
spondent to report immediately "the
bottom facts on China." The sens
ible reply was, "There are no facts,
and there is no bottom." Press re
ports from the interior are particu
larly unreliable owing to heavy cen
sorship and the few neutrals there.
I found no evidences of an early
cessation of hostilities in Eastern
Asia. Every indication points the
other way. Japan is quiet, surpris
ingly few soldiers are seen, yet the
people with whom I talked were re
signed to a long period of unsettle
ment. A former student of mine
stated that the Japanese press was
stressing the present stage in China
as one of reconstruction, while "the
next war" was responsible for the
many and increasing measures of
governmental control of foreign im
ports, currency restrictions, price
setting, and other devices of an em
ergency or military nature.
STIFF COMPETITION MET
This viewpoint was expressed by
other well-informed Japanese. The
unanticipated stiff operations of the
Chinese forces in North China and
the prolonged military operations in
Asia since then have been respon
sible for these current press reports.
The military is in virtual control in
Japan proper, absolutely so on the
mainland, while the liberal forces in
the universities and elsewhere are
not vocal.
Last month the feeling toward the
British was bitter, more so than
