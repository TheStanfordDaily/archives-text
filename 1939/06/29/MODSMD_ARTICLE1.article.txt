## 
### 
"The structure of proteins is the major unsolved problem on the bound
ary of chemistry and biology today," states J. D. Bernal, University of
London, who will address members of the Pacific Division of the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement of Science at the last general meet
ing of the conference tonight at 8 o'clock in the Memorial Theater.

Professor Bernal, who is a Fellow
of the Royal Society and has been
professor' of physics at the English
college since 1938, believes that in
the structure of proteins lies a key
to the solution of many of the prob
lems of the development and origin
of life.
400 PAPERS PRESENTED
More than 400 papers will be pre

istry, astronomy, geology and geog
raphy, zoological sciences, zoological
and botanical sciences, botanical sci
ences, medical sciences, and agricul
ture sections.
