# London Physicist to Address Scientific Convention Tonight
## 
### 
"The structure of proteins is the major unsolved problem on the bound
ary of chemistry and biology today," states J. D. Bernal, University of
London, who will address members of the Pacific Division of the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement of Science at the last general meet
ing of the conference tonight at 8 o'clock in the Memorial Theater.

Professor Bernal, who is a Fellow
of the Royal Society and has been
professor' of physics at the English
college since 1938, believes that in
the structure of proteins lies a key
to the solution of many of the prob
lems of the development and origin
of life.
400 PAPERS PRESENTED
More than 400 papers will be pre
sented before the 23rd annual meet
ing adjourns tomorrow. Members
of the various independent scien
tific organizations which make up
the American Association are holding
their own conference sessions today
and tomorrow in order to report the
latest developments in their special
fields.
The 17 participating societies have
been classified under physics, chem
istry, astronomy, geology and geog
raphy, zoological sciences, zoological
and botanical sciences, botanical sci
ences, medical sciences, and agricul
ture sections.
RADIO DEMONSTRATION
Among the sessions this afternoon
will be a symposium on "Some New
Ultra-high-frequency Radio Appa
ratus." Stanford physicists will dis
cuss and demonstrate the klystron
and rhumbatron. Symposium par
ticipants include R. H. Varian, W. W.
Hansen, D. L. Webster, and S. F.
Varian.
Speaking before the American As
sociation of Physics Teachers this
afternoon, H. P. Gillette of San Ma
rino, California, will explain how he
has predicted that the next period of
drouth will come in the year 1966. <
The subject of his speech is "Varves
and Rock Strata as Records of
Cycles."
"Dams and the Problem of Migra
tory Fishes" was the subject of a
symposium this morning during
which illustrated talks on Bonneville
Dam and the Sacramento river sal
mon-salvage problem were given.
This meeting was sponsored by the
Western Division of the American
Society of Ichthyologists and Her
petologists and was a joint session
with the Western Society of Nat
uralists.
CLOSES SATURDAY
Final conference sessions are
scheduled for Friday and several
group dinners have been arranged.
Saturday has been left free for field
excursions.
Commencing on the last day of

,the American Association meeting,

scheduled for Friday and several
group dinners have been arranged.
Saturday has been left free for field
excursions.
Commencing on the last day of

,the American Association meeting,
July 1, will be the Conference on
the Enunciation of the Cell Theory
which will consist of a series of
symposia commemorating the cen
tary of the Cell Theory.
"The structure of proteins is the major unsolved problem on the bound
ary of chemistry and biology today," states J. D. Bernal, University of
London, who will address members of the Pacific Division of the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement of Science at the last general meet
ing of the conference tonight at 8 o'clock in the Memorial Theater.

Professor Bernal, who is a Fellow
of the Royal Society and has been
professor' of physics at the English
college since 1938, believes that in
the structure of proteins lies a key
to the solution of many of the prob
lems of the development and origin
of life.
400 PAPERS PRESENTED
More than 400 papers will be pre
sented before the 23rd annual meet
ing adjourns tomorrow. Members
of the various independent scien
tific organizations which make up
the American Association are holding
their own conference sessions today
and tomorrow in order to report the
latest developments in their special
fields.
The 17 participating societies have
been classified under physics, chem
istry, astronomy, geology and geog
raphy, zoological sciences, zoological
and botanical sciences, botanical sci
ences, medical sciences, and agricul
ture sections.
RADIO DEMONSTRATION
Among the sessions this afternoon
will be a symposium on "Some New
Ultra-high-frequency Radio Appa
ratus." Stanford physicists will dis
cuss and demonstrate the klystron
and rhumbatron. Symposium par
ticipants include R. H. Varian, W. W.
Hansen, D. L. Webster, and S. F.
Varian.
Speaking before the American As
sociation of Physics Teachers this
afternoon, H. P. Gillette of San Ma
rino, California, will explain how he
has predicted that the next period of
drouth will come in the year 1966. <
The subject of his speech is "Varves
and Rock Strata as Records of
Cycles."
"Dams and the Problem of Migra
tory Fishes" was the subject of a
symposium this morning during
which illustrated talks on Bonneville
Dam and the Sacramento river sal
mon-salvage problem were given.
This meeting was sponsored by the
Western Division of the American
Society of Ichthyologists and Her
petologists and was a joint session
with the Western Society of Nat
uralists.
