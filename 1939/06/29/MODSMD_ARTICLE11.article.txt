# Noted Biologists Convene Tomorrow for Symposium
## Six-day Campus Meet to Feature Discussions of Cells, Protoplasm 
### RAMON ESPINOSA 
Leading biologists of the United States and Europe will meet on the
Stanford campus tomorrow for a six-day symposium on the celt and
protoplasm.
Commemorating the centennial of the formulation of the cell theory,
the meeting will feature such world-renowned scientists as E. G. Conklin
of Princeton, Robert Chambers of New York University, R. G. Harrison

•of Yale, W. M. Stanley of the Rocke
feller Medical Research Institute,
and A. Szent-Gyorgyi, discoverer of
vitamin C, of the University of Sze
ged, Hungary.
TAYLOR IN CHARGE
The convention will be presented
under the auspices of Stanford's
School of Biological Sciences, whose
Dean, Dr. Charles Vincent Taylor,
is in charge, in conjunction with the
annual conventon of the Pacific Di
vision, American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
The symposium, Dr. Taylor points
out, has been designed with a view
to drawing the interest and attend
ance of the layman as well as that of
the professional biologist, and all
visitors will be welcomed. The ses
sions will be held in room 100, the
Old Little Theater, on the Inner
Quadrangle, at 10 a.m., 2 and 8 p.m.,
from July 1 to 5. Admission is free.
The following program of varied
topics has been planned
FRIDAY, 7:30 P.M.—An introduc
tory address, "Cell and Protoplasm
Concepts: Historical Account," by
Dr. Conklin, will be followed by a
general meeting of speakers and
visitors at the Women's Clubhouse
for refreshments.
SATURDAY, 10 A.M.—"The Mi
cro-Dissection of Living Cells," an
illustrated address by Dr. Robert
Chambers. 2 P.M.—"The Cell Wall
and Protoplasm," an address by Dr.
I. W. Bailey of Harvard. 8 P.M.—
"Chromosomes and Cytoplasm in
Protozoa,' by Dr. H. S. Jennings of
Johns Hopkins.
.. SUNDAY, 10 A.M.—Richard Gold
schmidt of the University of Cali
fornia will speak on "Genes and
Chromosomes." 2 P.M. — Cellular
Differentiation and External Envi
ronment," by Dr. C. M. Child of the
University of Chicago, emeritus, now
associated with Stanford research.
4 P.M—A tea in the patio of the
Women's Gymnasium. 8 P.M.—Dr.
R. G. Harrison of Yale will discuss
"Cellular Differentiation and Inter
nal Environment."
MONDAY, 10 A.M.—Dr. G. A. Ko
foid of the University of California,
emeritus, will speak on "Cell and
Organism." 2 P.M.—"Chemical As
pects of Micro-organisms," an ad
dress by Dr. C. B. Van Niel of Stan
ford's Hopkins Marine Station. 8
P.M.—An address, as yet untitled,
by Dr. W. M. Stanley, who pioneered
the isolation and crystallization of
the virus at Rockefeller Institute of
Medical Research.
In explaining the purpose of the
symposium, Dr. Taylor points out
that, just as the atomic theory es
tablished the existence of minute
particles of matter as the basis of
the chemical phenomena of inani
mate matter, so the formulation of
the cell theory as the structural unit
of all living things led to the realiza
tion that all organisms are merely
different derivatives of a common
formula, and the consideration of all
living organisms, plants or animals,
as modified cells or aggregates of
cells.
This concept was the impetus for
an era of intensive investigation on
substances, mechanisms, and func
tions common to all cells, in the hope
that analysis of these phenomena
would ultimately bring scientists
closer to an understanding of the
nature of life.
It is in commemoration of this new
horizon in biology that biologists all
over the world are celebrating the
centennial of the formulation of the
cell theory, and it is in an attempt
to outline and summarize, by lec
tures and conferences, the accom
plishments of workers in the last
hundred years that Stanford is play
ing host to this roster of distin
guished biologists.
