# 'Ascent of F6,' War Satire, To Be Presented July 7
## 
### 
"The Ascent of F6," directed by Dr. Margery Bailey, will be read July 7
on the tattle Theater stage. In order to co-operate with the Division of
Speech and Drama, the Dramatists' Alliance has changed the date of this
reading from July 3, which was the date for which the reading of "The
Ascent of F6" was originally planned.

"The play will appeal to modern"
people because it is a satire on the
falsity of war as a means of bolster
ing national pride, and the shallow
and ungrateful response of the pub
lic to heroic efforts and a ringing ex
altation of the life devoted to pure
science.
BRITISH CARICATURIST
"The villains, the wretched people
of the play, are extraordinary caric
atures of prominent cabinet mem
bers and hostesses in England, and
the hero is a veiled portrait of the
modern type of adventurer whom
we have seen in two personalities in
recent years, Lawrence of Arabia
and Lindbergh," said Dr. Bailey of
"The Ascent of F6."
This reading, a war satire by
W. H. Auden and Christopher Ish
erwood, was selected by Thomas W.
Stevens, head of the Speech and
Drama Department, on the basis of
a public vote. The list included in
addition to "The Ascent of F6," "The
Zeal of Thy House," a medieval play
by Dorothy Sayers, and "The Fam
ily Reunion," a modern domestic
tragedy by T. S. Eliot.

Although the play is partially cast,
Dr. Bailey announced that any men
interested in reading with the group

Following the two readings,
"Knickerbocker Holiday," and "The
Ascent of F6," which are both verse
dramas dealing with modern society
and government, the Dramatists' Al
liance will present a series of lec
tures by members of the faculty of
the School of Letters on the esthet

ics of verse drama in the various
European countries. The first lec
ture will be delivered on July 10 by
Dr. Albert Guerard on Racine, and
will be followed by the reading of
selected scenes in French and in
English translations.

A meeting of Phi Delta Kappa,
national honorary educational so
ciety, will be held tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the Social Room of the
Educational Building, according to
Norton D. Thornton, secretary.
"The Ascent of F6," directed by Dr. Margery Bailey, will be read July 7
on the tattle Theater stage. In order to co-operate with the Division of
Speech and Drama, the Dramatists' Alliance has changed the date of this
reading from July 3, which was the date for which the reading of "The
Ascent of F6" was originally planned.

"The play will appeal to modern"
people because it is a satire on the
falsity of war as a means of bolster
ing national pride, and the shallow
and ungrateful response of the pub
lic to heroic efforts and a ringing ex
altation of the life devoted to pure
science.
BRITISH CARICATURIST
"The villains, the wretched people
of the play, are extraordinary caric
atures of prominent cabinet mem
bers and hostesses in England, and
the hero is a veiled portrait of the
modern type of adventurer whom
we have seen in two personalities in
recent years, Lawrence of Arabia
and Lindbergh," said Dr. Bailey of
"The Ascent of F6."
This reading, a war satire by
W. H. Auden and Christopher Ish
erwood, was selected by Thomas W.
Stevens, head of the Speech and
Drama Department, on the basis of
a public vote. The list included in
addition to "The Ascent of F6," "The
Zeal of Thy House," a medieval play
by Dorothy Sayers, and "The Fam
ily Reunion," a modern domestic
tragedy by T. S. Eliot.
TRYOUTEES SOUGHT
Although the play is partially cast,
Dr. Bailey announced that any men
interested in reading with the group
could try out Friday evening at
7:30 o'clock in Room 200 M on the
English Corner. All the women's
roles have been filled.
