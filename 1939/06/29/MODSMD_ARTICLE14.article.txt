JJR. MARGERY BAILEY, who is<
heading the Dramatists' Alli
ance group, and who is also direct
ing the reading of "The Ascent of
F6," which goes on the Little Thea
ter stage at 8 o'clock on July 7, is
delighted with the Chemistry con
ference, which, by the way, goes by
the name of the National Colloid
Symposium, and which is taking
place on the- Farm from July 1-8.
Reason being that the chemists have
reserved 100 of the Little Theater's
198 seats for that night. Chortles
Dr. Bailey, "Those chemists are
sensible people, they want to see a
play while they are here."

They do say that Mr. Stevens
was more than glad to give up the
plays that he had scheduled for
July 5, 6, and 7. Ten days was
not sufficient time to whip any
thing into shape for performance.
It is known, however, that Mr.
Stevens' classes in Technique of
Acting and Rehearsal and Per
formance are reading "The Tem
pest," and that it will be prob
ably one of the Division's early
presentations.

T>UTH MARTIN, director of the
Ram's Head readings this sum
mer, has scheduled two readings, the
first of which will take place on
July 13. "White Washing Julia," by
Henry Osborne oJnes, and "The Sec
ond Mrs. Tanqueray," by Pinero are
Ruth's choices. Tryouts will be an
nounced very shortly, and "la direc
trice" hopes to see a lot of new faces
at the tryouts.

Ash Wilson, last quarter's Simon
Eyre in "Shoemaker's Holiday,"
and Merle Meachem, Noah in "No
More Peace," have taken on new

► roles. Morning, noon, and night,
they can be seen toting trays at
Roble. Happy landings, fellows!

jQJOWN at the Palo Alto Com
munity Center, Gordon Wil
liams has just finished co-direct
ing "A Slight Case of Murder." Ted
Curtis also worked on costumes for
the show. Phyllis Lakin, who was
prominent in Farm dramatics two
years ago, takes to the boards again
in the Community Theater's "Girls
in Uniform," which goes on around
the middle of July.

The new Ram's Head pin is
really a killer-diller. It looks like
nothing so much as a corkscrew.
There are some cruel souls who
might point out its appropriateness,
but far be it from me.
