# Variety of Books Roll Off Presses
## 
### 
"Variety" might well be the theme
song of the Stanford University
Press, for books from cancer to
crime, from drama to mining, are
rapidly rolling off the presses.
Two books of importance, pub
lished in May, were "Crime Is a
Business" by John C. R. McDonald,
and "Cancer Handbook" edited by
Eric Lilyencrantz, M.D., of the
Stanford Medical School. The meth
ods outlined in this handbook on
cancer are founded on present prac
tices at the Stanford University Tu
mor Clinic. The book is primarily of
a professional nature.
BOOK PRAISED
In reference to the book, "Crime
Is a Business," by a police inspector
for the Oakland Police Department
and lecturer for the Oakland, San
Jose, and San Joaquin Valley po
lice schools, a recent comment
stated that this book was as "in
teresting as any mystery noveL"
August Vollmer, well known pro
fessor of police administration, in
commenting on the book, says, "It is
the most complete exposition of the
methods used by criminals for de
frauding the public that has ever
been presented."
As the summer quarter brings to
the campus an influx of pedagog
ically minded persons, a recent pub
lication should be noted. This is the
"History of Education Chart," by
Dr. Lester B. Sands and John C. Al
mack. In outline form, it is intended
primarily for students beginning
their first course in the history of
education, and for graduates who
are seeking review direction. It is
in topical outline form, arranged
chronologically.
NEW VOLUMES PLANNED
Probably by the middle of August,
two books of a specialized nature
will be off the press. One, "Sen
teniae and the Dramas of Corneille,"
is a very learned work by W. L.
Schwartz of the Stanford French de
partment. "Introduction to Mine
Surveying" by Professor W. W. Sta
ley of the Denver School of Mines is
the second book. It will be particu
larly usable as a text in mine sur
vey for mining engineers in precious
metals and coal.
Of interest to students of history
and the theater are some prospec
tive books in these fields. "Children
and the Theater," by Carolyn Fisher
and Mrs. H. G. Robinson is a treatise
on children's theaters. It is an out

growth of the work being done by
its authors in Palo Alto.
To the California history enthus
iast news of the reprinting of C. F.
McGlashan's "History of the Donner
Party" will be welcomed. Of t par
ticular interest in connection with
this reprint is the fact that notes for
the work have been compiled by
Mr. and Mrs. George Hinkle.

Of interest to students of history
and the theater are some prospec
tive books in these fields. "Children
and the Theater," by Carolyn Fisher
and Mrs. H. G. Robinson is a treatise
on children's theaters. It is an out

growth of the work being done by
its authors in Palo Alto.
To the California history enthus
iast news of the reprinting of C. F.
McGlashan's "History of the Donner
Party" will be welcomed. Of t par
ticular interest in connection with
this reprint is the fact that notes for
the work have been compiled by
Mr. and Mrs. George Hinkle.
"Variety" might well be the theme
song of the Stanford University
Press, for books from cancer to
crime, from drama to mining, are
rapidly rolling off the presses.
Two books of importance, pub
lished in May, were "Crime Is a
Business" by John C. R. McDonald,
and "Cancer Handbook" edited by
Eric Lilyencrantz, M.D., of the
Stanford Medical School. The meth
ods outlined in this handbook on
cancer are founded on present prac
tices at the Stanford University Tu
mor Clinic. The book is primarily of
a professional nature.
BOOK PRAISED
In reference to the book, "Crime
Is a Business," by a police inspector
for the Oakland Police Department
and lecturer for the Oakland, San
Jose, and San Joaquin Valley po
lice schools, a recent comment
stated that this book was as "in
teresting as any mystery noveL"
August Vollmer, well known pro
fessor of police administration, in
commenting on the book, says, "It is
the most complete exposition of the
methods used by criminals for de
frauding the public that has ever
been presented."
As the summer quarter brings to
the campus an influx of pedagog
ically minded persons, a recent pub
lication should be noted. This is the
"History of Education Chart," by
Dr. Lester B. Sands and John C. Al
mack. In outline form, it is intended
primarily for students beginning
their first course in the history of
education, and for graduates who
are seeking review direction. It is
in topical outline form, arranged
chronologically.
NEW VOLUMES PLANNED
Probably by the middle of August,
two books of a specialized nature
will be off the press. One, "Sen
teniae and the Dramas of Corneille,"
is a very learned work by W. L.
Schwartz of the Stanford French de
partment. "Introduction to Mine
Surveying" by Professor W. W. Sta
ley of the Denver School of Mines is
the second book. It will be particu
larly usable as a text in mine sur
vey for mining engineers in precious
metals and coal.
