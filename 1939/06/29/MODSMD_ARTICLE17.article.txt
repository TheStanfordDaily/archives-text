Defying the long odds quoted by
sports writers against possibilities
of a team winning the national col
legiate golf title twice in a row,
Stanford's golfers, with three men
playing their first year of varsity
golf, successfully defended the cham
pionship by a four-best-man total
score of 612, Tuesday at Des Moines,

Northwestern with 614 and lowa

of play for Stanford, set the pace for
the Indians with a sparkling 147.
He was also credited with the best
round of the match with a two
under-par 70. During this round,
Berl scored a 37 on the first nine and
came back with three birdies on the
second nine for a sizzling 33. His
total of 147 left him three strokes
behind the leader, Sid Richardson
of Northwestern.

nedy, 153; Showalter, 159; Wright,
157; Finger, 155; and Brigham, 163.
