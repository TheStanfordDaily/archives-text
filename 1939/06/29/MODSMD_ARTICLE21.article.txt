# Stanford Gets J.C. Cindermen
## 
### 
Blair Hyde, national junior college
record holder for the half-mile; Bur
man Skrable, only a stride behind
Hyde; and Jack Moore, mile and
two-mile star, yesterday announced
plans to enroll in Stanford in ihe
fall quarter as transfers from San
Mateo Junior College.
Three more outstanding Matean
men will probably not enroll until
a later date, however.
Les Steers, well - known high
jumper and javelin thrower; Con
nie Varneck, 6 - foot 5 - inch high
jumper and record holder in the
hop, step and jump event at the re
cent Junior Pacific Association meet,
and Francis Olson, middle distance
ace, will probably stay on at the
Matean institution, source for many
Stanford stars in recent years.
Of the latter three, Steers and
Varneck hope to enroll in time for
next season. Olson, however, will
definitely run another year at San
Mateo where he was recently elected
track and field captain for 1940.
