# Feudal Tower Is Mecca For Stanfordites
## 
### 
History at Stanford is not con
fined to the 900 section of the li
brary stacks or the classrooms on
English Corner. The Farm itself is
as legend-laden as a haunted house.
Monuments to the University's past
stud every cranny of the 9,000-acre
campus.
Among the most romantic and old
est is a mysterious medieval brick
tower about one mile out along
Sandhill Road in the direction of the
Ryan High Voltage Laboratory. This
Ruined pile, resembling a feudal
donjon keep, is pierced with Gothic
arches through which one can see
down, down, down into a pool of
stagnant water full of debris. It is
known as Frenchman's Tower, a
landmark recalling the days in the
'70's when an exotic Frenchman
paymaster in the French army,
turned up in California about the
same time that $5,000,000 turned up
missing from the payroll.
Peter Coutts was his name; he
purchased a great tract of land, to
day comprising most of the Stanford
campus, named it the Matadero
Ranch, and began raising fine-bred
horses on a grandiose scale.
To bring water to his estate, he
pierced a tunnel through one of the
rolling foothills, today known as

"Frenchman's cave," and reared
around his well the brick edifice
now famous as Frenchman's Tower.
Coutts later returned to France
and built himself an elaborate cha
teau; the tower he left behind is
used these days only as a medium
into which half a century of Stan
ford students have carved their in
itials.
