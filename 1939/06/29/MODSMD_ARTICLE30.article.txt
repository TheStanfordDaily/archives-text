HELP! HELP!! i
TO THE SCHOOL OF EDUCA
TION: Humble conductor of this
column wishes to serve the School
of Education as much as possible
this summer. But I am only another
victim of the cruel system that forces
all graduate students to slave away
no end on term papers.
SO: Pull-ease help me find news!

Students enrolling since June 20
will have to give up Saturday morn
ing in order to make up that Stan
ford aptitude test. For the benefit of
those who missed it the first time,
it is to be repeated Saturday at 9
o'clock in room 214, History and Eco
nomics building.
* * ♦
Keynote of the summer's work will
be sounded by Dean Grayson N.
Kefauver of the School of Education
at the first weekly Education Club
luncheon in the Union dining room,
July 6. There will be six luncheons
of the group during the summer.

American Federation of Teachers
are planning their summer's program
of activities and are anxious to get
in touch with all members in this
section who wish to take part, an
nounced Mr. Leif Thorne-Thomsen.
First meeting last week and second
one Wednesday were devoted to
formulating a program of activities.
Off-campus members are urged to
attend.

Lest newcomers have difficulty
finding the Los Altos Country
Club, site for the reception being
given by Dean and Mrs. Grayson
N. Kefauver Friday night, the
School of Education has mimeo
graphed a map showing the route
from hither to yon. Copies are in
the office and directions are ever
so much more explicit than those
in the old Welsh ballad:
"You turn to the right,
Then you turn to the left,

'Till you come to the end of the lane.
Then you turn to the left
And then to the right,
Then you'd better inquire again."

Dr. Reginald Bell, on sabbatical
leave next fall, isn't going to bask
in the sunshine of the Italian Riviera
or do any of the other glamorous
things candidates for the Ph.D. de
gree often imagine they will do when
they become professors in universi
ties and have sabbaticals of their
own. He is going to spend the year
in the Child Development Workshop
at the University of Chicago. This
project in educational experiment
and development is being organized
by the Commission on Teacher Edu
cation of the American Council of
Education. Not mere pleasure, but
an inspiring job well worth the ef
fort, says Dr. Bell. Numerous schools
are participating.

"I'd like to take all of the educa
tion courses this summer, so I won't
have to keep coming back year after
year," remarked a vivacious lady
from one of California's largest cit
ies. "At least, since I'm working on
my thesis, I think I'll sign up for
290 a, 290b and 290c." (These courses
all come at the same time.) But the
lady isn't triplets, so apparently she
felt it is a good idea to start the
summer in a kidding mood, whether
or not she can keep that up until
the end of the eight weeks.

Lest newcomers have difficulty
finding the Los Altos Country
Club, site for the reception being
given by Dean and Mrs. Grayson
N. Kefauver Friday night, the
School of Education has mimeo
graphed a map showing the route
from hither to yon. Copies are in
the office and directions are ever
so much more explicit than those
in the old Welsh ballad:
"You turn to the right,
Then you turn to the left,

'Till you come to the end of the lane.
Then you turn to the left
And then to the right,
Then you'd better inquire again."

Dr. Reginald Bell, on sabbatical
leave next fall, isn't going to bask
in the sunshine of the Italian Riviera
or do any of the other glamorous
things candidates for the Ph.D. de
gree often imagine they will do when
they become professors in universi
ties and have sabbaticals of their
own. He is going to spend the year
in the Child Development Workshop
at the University of Chicago. This
project in educational experiment
and development is being organized
by the Commission on Teacher Edu
cation of the American Council of
Education. Not mere pleasure, but
an inspiring job well worth the ef
fort, says Dr. Bell. Numerous schools
are participating.

"I'd like to take all of the educa
tion courses this summer, so I won't
have to keep coming back year after
year," remarked a vivacious lady
from one of California's largest cit
ies. "At least, since I'm working on
my thesis, I think I'll sign up for
290 a, 290b and 290c." (These courses
all come at the same time.) But the
lady isn't triplets, so apparently she
felt it is a good idea to start the
summer in a kidding mood, whether
or not she can keep that up until
the end of the eight weeks.
