# Science Shows Latest Insect War Weapons
## 
### 
The latest weapons of warfare—
against insect pests—were demon
strated on the Stanford campus
Wednesday morning before mem
bers of the Pacific Slope Branch of
the American Association of Eco
nomic Entomologists, meeting for a
thi'ee-day conference in connection
with the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.
Four trees across from the geology
corner became thoroughly disin
fected as they were used as guinea
pigs while the entomologists watched
the newest in sprayers, dusters, and
fumigators go through their paces.
Any weevils around the Quad office
were also exterminated by the dem
onstration.
An agricultural rogues' gallery was
assembled in room 320 of the Geology
Building where types of injurious
insects from various parts of the
country were displayed. Biggest bug
was a six-inch lobster-like indi
vidual from New Guinea. This one
bug plague is named Eurycantha
horrida. California, U.C.L.A., Davis,
and Oregon State all furnished ex
hibits. Also on display were chemi
cals used as insecticides, and collec
tions of recent books on entomology
and pest control.
Tuesday, Wednesday afternoon,
and Thursday morning were de
voted to the reading of over 60 sci
entific papers on plant pests and
their control, compiled from re
search on Western ranches and agri
cultural stations.
A barbecue for more than 200
members of the association was held
Wednesday evening. The final busi
ness session will be held this morn
ing. In the afternoon the meeting
will adjourn to San Francisco for
a joint session with the Pacific Coast
Entomological Society.
