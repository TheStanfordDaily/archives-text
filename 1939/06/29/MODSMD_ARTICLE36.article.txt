### 
As a contribution to meetings of
the Dramatists' Alliance at Stanford
University this summer, Miss Mar
garita de Mayo, visiting associate
professor of Spanish from Vassar
College, is directing a production of
the 17th century drama, "Peribanez,"
by the classic Spanish dramatist,
Lope de Vega, to be given in the
Union patio on the evening of July
20.
The play, which revolves around
the classic Spanish theme of honor
and its ramifications in the code of
love and class distinctions, will be
presented admission-free. Members
of the cast already selected are Mer
cedes Ezcurro, Miguel Prado, Ramon
Espinosa, and Dr. Walter Kaulfers.
Chili, as most Americans know
and eat it, is not obtainable very
far below the Rio Grande. It it
strictly an American dish.
