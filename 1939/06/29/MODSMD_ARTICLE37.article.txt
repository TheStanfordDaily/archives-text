# Holmes Stresses Scientific Ethics
## 
### 
"Were all questions of morality
frankly recognized as scientific prob
lems much of the conflict in moral
aims would disappear," declared Dr.
S. J. Holmes, president of the Pacific
Division of the American Associa
tion for the Advancement of Science,
as he delivered the keynote address
of the twenty-third annual meeting
Tuesday evening in Memorial Thea
ter.
In pleading for scientific ethics,
Dr. Holmes indicated the necessity
of turning from the present tendency
of divorcing wisdom from morality.
The 71-year-old authority on hered
ity and evolution stated that "one of
the most serious obstacles to several
moral reforms is the blind adherence
to moral codes that command un
questioning obedience."
"The people of Christian nations
profess allegiance to a code which
the exigencies of their lives com
pel them to continually violate. The
result is confusion and conflict and
a constant incentive to hypocrisy,"
he continued.
Speaking on "Darwinian Ethics
and Its Practical Application," Dr.
Holmes, who is professor emeritus
of zoology at the University of Cali
fornia, suggested that current moral

practice might be considerably im
proved if it becomes more con
sciously and definitely regulated in
terms of the Darwinian standard.
Darwin, he believes, by approaching
ethics purely from the standpoint of
natural history contributed greatly
toward making ethics scientific and
of more value to mankind.
