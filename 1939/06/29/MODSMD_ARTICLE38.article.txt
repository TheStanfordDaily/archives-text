University made the headlines
when it took a sum of $250 from its
budget to be used to purchase swing
phonograph records. A play for pub
licity? I hardly think so. Rather it
was the feeling on the part of the
university that perhaps there was
a new art form being created in
this country and that it wouldn't be
a bad idea to have a few collector's
items for its students to study in
years to come.
This isn't going to be a definition
of swing music but rather a plea to
understand its tenets and not to
mistake it with its shoddy imitators.
General conception of swing mu
sic is it is anything that is fast and
loud and the faster and louder the
better. Hence the phenomenal rise
of Artie Shaw. As this observer sees
it, the essential ingredient of swing
music is the feeling that the per
former has at the time of the per
formance. He may have marvelous
technical ability but if it isn't com
bined with an inherent gift deep in
side him it will sound forced and
be artificially brilliant. It is from
such performances as these that
much of this criticism of swing mu
sic arises.

"IVot so long ago, so the story goes,
a prof got to the Union with just
enough time for a cup of coffee be
fore his eight o'clock. And before
he could get it, some one played
Larry Clinton's record of "My
Heart Belongs to Daddy." Leaving
his coffee untasted he rushed to his
class and spent the hour in a violent
harangue on the immoral effects of
swing music today. Who ever said
"My Heart Belongs to Daddy" was
swing? And so it goes. Only an
other indication of the unbelievable
readiness of people to discourse on
things in which their ignorance is
colossal.
No one ever became an art critic
by looking at 100 or 1000 pictures,
but one can learn to tell what is
swing and what isn't by listening
and listening, and that is the only
way. You can read a book and it
won't help you a bit in determining
what is good or bad in music. You
have to develop an ear for it like
the art critic has to develop his eyes
to see what the artist is trying to do.
There is a new art form being
developed here. Unfortunately it has
come up through the gutter and is
associated with jitterbugs. But its
true worth is being recognized more
and more, and as soon as the public
can forget some of its racial preju
dices and remember that talent is
where you find it, a lot of the mis
understanding surrounding swing
music will vanish.
Speaking of finding it, Stanford
will have the opportunity to compare
two of the most famous and dis
cussed bands this next week. Artie
Shaw will be playing in a San Fran

■Cisco theater and Benny Goodman
will be at the Exposition. When you
hear them, forget the jitterbugs and
try to understand what they are
trying to present. I imagine you'll
be surprised.
