Control of education in Germany
by the National Socialist German
Workers' Party "to educate the Ger
man youth for the National Com
munity and for full pledge to Lead
er and Nation" is described in "Edu
cation in Germany," recently pub
lished as Bulletin 1938, No. 15, by
the Office of Education in the De
partment of the Interior.
The study was made so that Ger
man students can be placed accu
rately in American colleges and
universities.
EDUCATION CONTROLLED
Control of education throughout
all Germany, the bulletin states, was
brought into the central government
by the establishment, in May 1934,
of a Reich Ministry of Education.
Previously the German States had
been fairly free in building and man
aging their own school systems.
Heredity, racial science, and
family and population policies were
introduced in the curriculum in
1935 so that the boys and girls would
leave school with a "full apprecia
tion of the necessity and spirit of
blood purity." Special interest was
attached to prehistory and folklore.
The curricula show a turning
toward subjects commonly termed
practical, such as modern languages,
mathematics, and the sciences, and
definitely less study of the classics.
Fewer, not more, students are to be
made ready for and admitted to the
universities. Girls are almost de
nied admission to the universities
because Latin is so nearly elimi
nated from the curricula of the girls'
schools.
The regulations governing the
education of Jewish children togeth
er with the decrees barring Jewish
folk from practicing the professions
in Germany are also summarized in
the bulletin.
A 1938 check by the Biological
Survey indicated there were ap
proximately 5,000,000 "big game ani
