# Alumni Gifts Exceed '38 Mark
## 
### 
Exceeding last year's total by 21
per cent, contributions to the Stan
ford Fund by more than 2600 alumni
and friends have brought the total
amount received since February 1 in
the third annual appeal to $46,553.
Eighteen hundred of the gifts
came from alumni living in Cali
fornia. The rest from Stanford men
and women living in 17 foreign
countries, Hawaii, Alaska, the
Philippines, and the Canal Zone.
Only the states of Vermont, North
and South Dakota were missing from
the role. From Bahrein on the Per
sian Gulf came the contribution
which traveled the greatest distance.
It was the donation of Victor J.
M inner, '25.
Paul C. Edwards, '06, associate
editor of the San Francisco News,
served as chairman of the commit
tee to raise the funds. Most of the
money was given to the University
without restriction as to its use.
