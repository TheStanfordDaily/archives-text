# First Reading Of Summer Wins Acclaim
## 
### 
Judging by the row of nine tuxedo
shirt fronts and three evening dresses
which rollicked through "Knicker
bocker Holiday" Monday evening,
Stanford is in for a summer of en
tertaining and worth-while play
readings.
Sheared of stage "business" and
music (except for the entr'acte mad
rigal recordings), Maxwell Ander
son's satire of old New York still
carried across the footlights enough
timeliness and punch to keep its
audience laughing at Pieter Stuy
vesant (A. Grove Day), the fuehrer
of New Amsterdam, and at the
muddle-headed machinations of the
town council (Harry Earl Jones,
Louis Hill, George Z. Wilson, Jeffer
son M. Crismon).
Ringmaster of this three-ring cir
cus of parody on dictatorship, war,
diplomacy, and democracy, was
shrewd, pot-boiling Washington Irv
ing (Charlton Laird) as an author
trying to write a book which, to
sell well among the first families of
New York, must bear no scandal
about their ancestors.
As Brom Broeck, the First Amer
ican (because he simply cannot take
orders), James Stone overlooked in
his reading of the part the utter
satire of the play and so did too
"straight" a rendition of a ne'er-do
well tinker who twice escapes hang
j ing and steals his sweetheart from
right under Stuyvesant's nose.
As that sweetheart, Tina Tien
hoeven, Louise Linton was delicious,
combining artlessness and sophisti
cation with delicacy. Mynheer Tien
hoven, her father and a war profi
teer who sells muskets and firewater
to the Indians, George Z. Wilson,
played the best Dutch accent in a
town council whose attempts at the
Hollander dialect sometimes sounded
like Sam Schlepperman.
Schermerhorn (David Bell), as
large holes in whose walls have to
turnkey of a hoosegow, the two
be guarded by himself and his wife,
took to his part with relish, as did
Mistress Schermerhorn (Virginia
Sharpe) who managed some risque
innuendo with ponderous Dutch
subtlety.
Tenpin, survivor of several In
dian scalpings and friend to Brom,
was done by W. W. Chamberlain,
whose Western twang helped him to
many laughs. Mina, a girl of Nieuw
Amsterdam, was played by Barbara
Harmon.
Although "Knickerbocker Holiday"
showed general excellence in per
formance, the satire and mood rested

chiefly with the experienced A.
Grove Day who endowed the peg
legged character of Pieter Stuyve
sant with all the fatuous bluster and
craven selfishness of your favorite
dictator, and then some.—Leff

Since the population of New York
City is expected to reach a total of
10,800,000 by 1960, the hospital sys
tem must replace 24,300 beds and
provide 25,500 new beds within the
next 25 years.

Amsterdam, was played by Barbara
Harmon.
Although "Knickerbocker Holiday"
showed general excellence in per
formance, the satire and mood rested

chiefly with the experienced A.
Grove Day who endowed the peg
legged character of Pieter Stuyve
sant with all the fatuous bluster and
craven selfishness of your favorite
dictator, and then some.—Leff

Since the population of New York
City is expected to reach a total of
10,800,000 by 1960, the hospital sys
tem must replace 24,300 beds and
provide 25,500 new beds within the
next 25 years.
Judging by the row of nine tuxedo
shirt fronts and three evening dresses
which rollicked through "Knicker
bocker Holiday" Monday evening,
Stanford is in for a summer of en
tertaining and worth-while play
readings.
Sheared of stage "business" and
music (except for the entr'acte mad
rigal recordings), Maxwell Ander
son's satire of old New York still
carried across the footlights enough
timeliness and punch to keep its
audience laughing at Pieter Stuy
vesant (A. Grove Day), the fuehrer
of New Amsterdam, and at the
muddle-headed machinations of the
town council (Harry Earl Jones,
Louis Hill, George Z. Wilson, Jeffer
son M. Crismon).
Ringmaster of this three-ring cir
cus of parody on dictatorship, war,
diplomacy, and democracy, was
shrewd, pot-boiling Washington Irv
ing (Charlton Laird) as an author
trying to write a book which, to
sell well among the first families of
New York, must bear no scandal
about their ancestors.
As Brom Broeck, the First Amer
ican (because he simply cannot take
orders), James Stone overlooked in
his reading of the part the utter
satire of the play and so did too
"straight" a rendition of a ne'er-do
well tinker who twice escapes hang
j ing and steals his sweetheart from
right under Stuyvesant's nose.
As that sweetheart, Tina Tien
hoeven, Louise Linton was delicious,
combining artlessness and sophisti
cation with delicacy. Mynheer Tien
hoven, her father and a war profi
teer who sells muskets and firewater
to the Indians, George Z. Wilson,
played the best Dutch accent in a
town council whose attempts at the
Hollander dialect sometimes sounded
like Sam Schlepperman.
Schermerhorn (David Bell), as
large holes in whose walls have to
turnkey of a hoosegow, the two
be guarded by himself and his wife,
took to his part with relish, as did
Mistress Schermerhorn (Virginia
Sharpe) who managed some risque
innuendo with ponderous Dutch
subtlety.
Tenpin, survivor of several In
dian scalpings and friend to Brom,
was done by W. W. Chamberlain,
whose Western twang helped him to
many laughs. Mina, a girl of Nieuw
Amsterdam, was played by Barbara
Harmon.
