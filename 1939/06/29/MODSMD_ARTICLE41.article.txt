# INDIAN SUMMER
## 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
a place in England that'
has hills and trees like Stan
ford's. And in the summer the air
is idle, and there are brownish-yel
low stacks of that oat-stuff in the
fields. Or at least that's what a
Stanford student reads in the Shrop
shire - named and Stanford - like
verses of A. E. Housman, a Cam
bridge Latin professor who liked to
drink quarts of British ale and then
tell people what he thought about
women and friends, playing cricket,
going to war, and leaning on a
scythe and rake all day.
One of the main things that Hous
man and his ale and ink say, is that
men, like Stanford's or Cambridge's
or even Hockerville's, gradually lose
their youthful freedom and bury
their closest ideals and pleasures in
conferring to a middle-aged world.
Which is a hell of a note just six
days before America celebrates her
independence.
But in spite of the Fourth of July,
and the firecrackers that burned a
pair of my pants right into the hands
of Mose as recently as last year,
Housman was not "intellectually"
drunk when he caught the disap
pointing mood of chaps like us who
have turned into monitors for some
thing or someone who deadens their
younger aspirations. All kinds of
things, Housman suggests, can do
that; he must have known about
bridge-playing wives, Sinclair Lew
is' Babbits (who, unfortunately, are
not always Sinclair Lewis'), and the
general run of emotionally deaf and
blind mutes that make grave-yards
out of the particular ten square feet
of the world in the center of which
they happen to be standing. In
columns we can say that very
bravely. A few of us even do it
orally or through the medium of
laughing.
♦ * *
B ul getting pre-occupied with any
particular work or pleasure often
kills a free man's finest friend: en
joyment, of things beyond his own
field, and good humor rather than
self-importance for every-day oc
currences. In such a position one is
not only apt to become one of
Housman's most despondent living
dead, but he is also likely to say
what one prim lady did coming out
of the Education Building yesterday:
"Mr. Chalmers, the point I'm trying
to make would be more evident if
you were squarely facing the prob
lem; that is, we should be giving
them "background" all along the
line!"
It's that bromidial "background"
and taking it tritely that un-freshens
living. And takes its annual toll of
Babbits among young biz school
grads, makes intellectual Ichabod
Cranes of some teachers, inorganic
things out of a few scientists, and
golfingly ordinary bedside-men out
of some of us pre-medics. I would
hesitate to call them all Republicans,
inclining as I do to be disgustingly
democratic, but I am much afraid
that they are among Alf Landon's
unashamed supporters.
But I knew a Republican once

'who kept his and Housman's "heart
and soul." He was rather human,
and although a brilliant mathema
tician, saw lots of things in the
world that aren't cube-roots and
logarithms. That speaks bravely for
the American political party system,
and gives one hope that no matter
what specialty college is teaching us,
we can all, perhaps, keep a measure
of the universal interest that is usu
ally a part of being under twenty
one.

verses of A. E. Housman, a Cam
bridge Latin professor who liked to
drink quarts of British ale and then
tell people what he thought about
women and friends, playing cricket,
going to war, and leaning on a
scythe and rake all day.
One of the main things that Hous
man and his ale and ink say, is that
men, like Stanford's or Cambridge's
or even Hockerville's, gradually lose
their youthful freedom and bury
their closest ideals and pleasures in
conferring to a middle-aged world.
Which is a hell of a note just six
days before America celebrates her
independence.
But in spite of the Fourth of July,
and the firecrackers that burned a
pair of my pants right into the hands
of Mose as recently as last year,
Housman was not "intellectually"
drunk when he caught the disap
pointing mood of chaps like us who
have turned into monitors for some
thing or someone who deadens their
younger aspirations. All kinds of
things, Housman suggests, can do
that; he must have known about
bridge-playing wives, Sinclair Lew
is' Babbits (who, unfortunately, are
not always Sinclair Lewis'), and the
general run of emotionally deaf and
blind mutes that make grave-yards
out of the particular ten square feet
of the world in the center of which
they happen to be standing. In
columns we can say that very
bravely. A few of us even do it
orally or through the medium of
laughing.

self-importance for every-day oc

not only apt to become one of
Housman's most despondent living
dead, but he is also likely to say
what one prim lady did coming out
of the Education Building yesterday:
"Mr. Chalmers, the point I'm trying

It's that bromidial "background"

golfingly ordinary bedside-men out
