Pamphlets and leaflets which were
widely distributed in the United
States before 1916 show graphically
the efforts of both the Allies and
the Central Powers to influence the
United States in entering the war
on their side. There is also an ex
hibit of the Northcliffe "Air Pact"
propaganda which was the British
contribution to the campaign toward
destroying the enemy morale by
dropping broadsides and leaflets over
enemy lines from planes or bal
loons. Lord Northcliffe was in charge
of the distribution of British propa
ganda in enemy countries.
In the Graduate School of Busi
ness an exhibit of industrial adver
tising is displayed. Models of
the early Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco and of the early coach
and pony express are features of
the banking exhibit.
In the Stanford Art Gallery, paint
ings by contemporary artists col
lected by the Gardena High School
