At Oxford, no male student may
be seen on the street with a woman;
at Stanford, any student who fails to
say "Hello" to a passing stranger is
violating one of the University's old
est customs, the "hello" spirit.
Summer quarter Stanfordites will
probably not be troubled by the tra
dition which forbids corduroy trou
sers to lower division students; dur
ing their frosh and soph years, these
have to get along with moleskins.
One of Stanford's oldest tradi
tions, however, originated by Mrs.
Stanford, is always observed: there
is no smoking on the Quad. Like
wise at her behest, men do not play
pool in dormitories on Sunday.
The Stanford "rough" is supposed
to have gone the way of the great
auk and the saber-tooth tiger. But
he still has the esprit de corps to
whistle, cheer, and hoot the daring
or ignorant female who presumes on
the sacred masculine precincts of
the Law steps. These are on the
Quad opposite the Libe and may be
identified by the penny-pitching go
ing on at all times. Gals, keep off
the Law steps!
Palo Alto is a small village in
California noted for its cut-throat
motion picture theaters and South
ern Pacific escape mechanism. How
ever, for the student who must visit
this hamlet, Stanford provides the
tradition that those waiting at the
beginning of Palm Drive will be
picked up by those driving by. Don't
stick out your thumb, though.
Although the Carnegie Institute
maintains a plant geology lab on
campus, corsages are taboo at Stan
ford dances, and Dutch treats are
legal and civilized.
Your Roble hasher, ladies, is that
efficient white wraith who makes the
entree appear before you where no
entree was before, but in between
times you may accompany him to
milkshakes, movies, dances, or
drives without losing caste. He, too,
is working for his degree.
