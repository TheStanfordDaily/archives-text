# Professor Brown Gives Radio Talk

"The filament of the ordinary 60-
watt lamp in your home operates
at a temperature of 2500 degrees
Centigrade," stated Leland H. Brown,
assistant professor of electrical en
gineering, on the Stanford Radio
Hour last night. "This," he contin
ued, "is above the melting point of
asbestos."
Stressing the precautions necessary
to produce a lamp of the highest
efficiency and longest life, the speak
er stated that, for all its perfection,
the modern incandescent lamp is
only about 10 per cent efficient.
Dr. Brown described the neon
light as being the result of the lu
minous glow occurring when high
voltage is applied to neon gas at
low pressures.
Whether or not the efficiency of
fluorescent lamps will increase as
rapidly as did that of incandescent
lamps, and whether this will come
about through incandescent sources,
are among the problems that await
electrical engineers, according to
Professor Brown.
