# Farm to Hear Noted Physicist Speak Today
## Prof. J. D. Bernal To Discuss 'Social Functions of Science' 
### 
"The Social Function of Science"
will be discussed this afternoon by
Professor J. D. Bernal, noted British
physicist and crystallographer, in
the auditorium of the Education
Building at 4:15 o'clock, according to
the Committee on Public Exercises.
An authority on the structure of
protein and the theory of liquids,
Dr. Bernal, professor of physics at
Birkbeck College, University of Lon
don, is here to attend the meetings
of the National Colloid Symposium,
which opens on the campus today,
and the recent sessions of the Ameri
can Association for the Advance
ment of Science.
A critical examination of the func
tion of science in society has devel
oped in the past few years, mainly
the result of the World War and un
certain economic conditions, which,
according to the speaker, have shown
that science can be used for de
struction and wasteful purposes as
well as to lead to continuous pro
gressive improvement in conditions
of life.
Dr. Bernal explains that many per
sons have even demanded the com
plete cessation of all scientific re
search as the only means of procur
ing an acceptable civilization, and
that scientists themselves, faced with
this criticism, have been forced to
consider how their work is connect
ed with the social and economic de
velopments which are occurring
around them.
This connection between science
and society will be discussed by the
speaker, who will explain how far
scientists, both individually and col
lectively, are responsible for such a
situation, suggesting what possible
steps could be taken which would
lead to a fruitful utilization of
science.
