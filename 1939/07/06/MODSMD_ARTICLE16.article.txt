"OEMEMBER the hullabaloo when<
the long-lost Ram's Head
plaques were discovered in the pos
session of a certain band leader then
playing in the city? The organiza
tions contributing most to the Gaie
ties last fall were to have their
names engraved on it, and it was to
become an annual event.
When we glimpsed it today, no
names had been added since 1935.
We wonder if the fact that the en
graving on the plaques specifically
states that they are to be awarded
to the men's and women's organiza
tion presenting the best entertain
ment feature of each Big Game Gaie
ties has anything to do with the
blanks, because the last nomination
was made on a basis of the amount
of work done by the group, technical
or acting.

We gratefully acknowledge Chet
Johnson's explanation of the ori
gin of the Ram's Head pin. It's a
stylized stage screw, which ac
counts both for its resemblance to
a cork screw and to a Ram's Head.

Reports from the Daily "smoothie"
say that all Farm jitterbugs have a
holiday due them just so they can
go Fairwards to see, and hear, ye
old king of swing, B. Goodman, and
to a City theater to hear Artie Shaw
and his band "send them" in the
aisles. Our reporter rates Shaw's
show superior to Goodman's.

"|\["OW vacationing on the Farm is
the glamorous actress-wife of
Feri Roth, the eminent quartet lead
er. Under the name of Marie Doray,
she will soon return to Hollywood
to begin work in "The Life of Rob
ert Schumann," which Lester Cow
all is producing for Universal. Mrs.
Roth is playing the second feminine

'lead, supporting Anna Neagle, who
is co-starring in the production.
Miss Claire McGregor, who is
a member of the Speech and
Drama staff, gleaned some very
favorable reviews several weeks
ago for her performance as Miss
Baker in the dramatization of
Frank Norris' "McTeague," which
the Players Club did in the City.
Her brilliant characterization was
one of the high spots of the scin
tillating opening of that play,
which was dramatized from Nor
ris' novel by Charles Caldwell
Dobie.
Helen Green and Ruth Cannon,
also from the department, assisted
on the wardrobe for the play.

"The Tempest" has now com
pleted casting, and comes the good
news that it will run for seven
nights. Maybe the Farm is to have
a summer drama season after all,
what with two readings and a seven
day run of a Shakespearean pro
duction coming up. Waldemar Jo
hansen is planning some pretty spe
cial sets for the last production, I
hear.—Farrell
