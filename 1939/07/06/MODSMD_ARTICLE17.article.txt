# Bernal Closes Cell Symposium
## 
### 
Concluding a six-day series of
lectures by some of the world's
leading scientists on the cell and
protoplasm, J. D. Bemal of London,
internationally renowned physicist
and X-ray sleuth of the protein
molecule, last night suggested that
the phenomena of cell division might
be perfectly explicable on the basis
of principles of colloid chemistry
and physics.
He declared that a further analysis
of the exact nature of cell constitu
ents would help to clear much of
the mystery from essentially simple
phenomena obtained in cells.
In the afternoon, Dr. L. V. Heil
brun of Pennsylvania gave evidence
in support of the thesis that clotting
action of calcium upon protoplasm
constituents is the key to the
shortening of muscle fibers.
