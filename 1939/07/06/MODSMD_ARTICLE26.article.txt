### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
jy/JARK TWAIN said that constant'
criticism of the Devil was "un
just, un-American, and, in fact,
French!" "Anyone," observed that
old Atheist, "who governs four-fifths
of the human race should be cred
ited with a good deal of executive
ability." Most people who knew
Mark Twain as a profane Westerner
knew fairly accurately what he
meant by the "Devil"—perhaps best
described as that sort of thing which
is not considered appropriate in
front of Aunt Pollies, stern uncles, or
over-zealous picnic superintendents.
But most of the rest of us have our
own little private conceptions of
Satan. Last night mine was the in
considerate chap who made my bed
so that it was impossible for my
shoulders and toes to be warm at the
same time. This morning, after
reading the latest war news, I am
sure the Devil is the prototype of
all jingo ists. And I don't consider it
French in the least to criticize him.
What Anthony Eden has been
calling "circumstances in the past
hectic month" for the last two years,
has convinced most people that the
democracies must stop the dictators.
England really wants to arrest the
development of the Hitler blossom,
they think, but Britain hasn't been
firm enough. Of course, they sug
gestively observe, the United States
hasn't lent much support to the fee
ble English umbrella. And lurking
beneath the surface objectivity, and
in some cases the word-service to
neutrality, is the feeling of a Sousa
band and God-help-us-in-this
righteous-war.

JV" 0W the hectic circumstances have
not left me, I confess, without
the opinion that Berlin's mega
lomaniac is an unhumorous bad
name. And I certainly do not ap
prove of Mussolini as the "savior of
Ethiopian womanhood," or of Der
Furore as the knight errant of
Czechoslovakian, Austrian, "Dan
zigian," and, as might soon be the
case, European "Germans." But
there are a number of factors that
rather chill my ardor for our send
ing me and other Americans to war.
Some of these factors, I am ready
to admit, are rather personal, such
as the fact that I like my legs at
tached to the rest of my body and
am enjoying living. But one of the
reasons involves this so-called
English disapproval of aggression.
Such unradical and reliable
sources as the Christian Science
Monitor tell us that "America and
Great Britain are the basic props of
the German war machine," and "the
United States and England are sup
plying Japan with sixty-eight per
cent of her war supplies" — which
Japan needs to wage peace on
China. Facts such as those make
me wonder how much those in con
trol in England (and America) ac
tually oppose the aggression which
they make so heinous in the public
prints. Such facts make me wonder
how nearly our general opinion co
incides with what is being done eco
nomically to "halt the hun." Is it
altogether logical for the British
rhetoricians to raise diplomatic cain
with aggressor states when British
industrialists are enjoying a profit
able exportation of munitions to Ber
lin, Rome, and Tokio?
