# Study-list Change Deadline Today
## 
### 
Announcement has been made
by the Registrar's office that to
day is the last day that students
enrolled for the summer quarter
may make changes in their study
lists without being subject to
fines.
After today all program re
visions must be made by petition
to the Registration Committee
subject to the following fines: $2
for each course added or dropped
or $3 where one course is sub
stituted for another.
AH program changes made since
registration should be filed at the
Registrar's Office on the regular
revised study-lists cards. Students
are held responsible for courses
and units as they appear on the
official study lists filed at the time
of registration and no credit will
be given for courses which do not
appear thereon. This ruling ap
plies to Physical Education as well
as academic subjects.
