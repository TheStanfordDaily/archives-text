# 'Ascent of F6' Slated Tonight
## 
### 
"The Ascent of F6," a modern
satire on propaganda, hypocrisy, and
hysteria, will be read tomorrow night
at 8 o'clock in the Little Theater.
Since a hundred of the 198 seats
have been reserved for the Colloid
Symposium, Dr. Margery Bailey, di
rector of the Dramatists' Alliance,
warns those planning to attend the
reading to arrive early.
Second on Stanford's summer play
reading program (the first was
"Knickerbocker Holiday") "The As
sent of F6" features such campus
actors as Charles Denny, Charlton
Laird, Virginia Sharpe, Louise Lin
ton, and A. Grove Day. An original
musical score has been arranged by
Harry E. Jones.
