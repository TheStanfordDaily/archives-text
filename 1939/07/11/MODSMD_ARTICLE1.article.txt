# Educators Debate Freedom, Heredity, Cinema at Session
## Dr. Trueblood Discusses Heretics; Spirited Arguments Feature Meet 
### DWIGHT MITCHELL 
Threats to academic freedom in colleges, the age-old question of heredity
versus environment, preservation of democratic ideal as a major task of
educators and problems of utilizing moving pictures in the schools occu
pied the attention of approximately 1000 educators at the seventh annual
educational conference sponsored by the School of Education here Friday,

Saturday and Sunday. 1
Spirited debate marked discus
sions following each address, as con
flicting points of view brought sharp
battles of wit from panel members.
Shortened to three days because
of the annual conference of the Na
tional Education Association in San
Francisco, the conference closed with
an address entitled "The Function
of Heretics" by D. Elton Trueblood,
University chaplain, in the Memo
rial Church Sunday morning.
I.Q. VARIABILITY DOUBTED
Claims that intelligence quotients
of children are highly variable un
der controlled conditions, made by
Dr. Geo. D. Stoddard, director of the
Child Welfare Research station of
the University of lowa, Friday pre
cipitated a heated controversy in
which Dr. Lewis Madison Terman,
Stanford psychologist, questioned
the validity of the Iowa findings.
Dr. Stoddard described experi
ments in which he claimed children
of feeble-minded parents, when
placed in a stimulating environment,
developed I.Q.'s equivalent to the
average of those of university pro
fessors' children. From a mean I.Q.
of 64.2, a group of 13 children pro
gressed until they showed a mean
of 91.8, according to Dr. Stoddard.
Dr. Terman claimed his experi
ments showed that I.Q.'s show little
variation under varied environ
mental conditions.
MOTION PICTURES FORUM
How schools are to obtain moving
picture films of educational worth
to show in classrooms was the
problem discussed at the forum ses
sion on motion pictures, with 200
persons in attendance. Educators
and representatives of moving pic
ture producers argued the merits of
commercial films.
Schools should have the responsi
bility of deciding what films should
be shown, declared Professor Mary
A. May, director of the Institute of
Human Relations at Yale. However, it
was argued that schools should not
have to make the films any more
than they now print textbooks.
PROGRESSIVE METHODS
Preservation of America's demo
cratic ideals depends upon a vigor
ous and aggressive campaign by
teachers, declared Dr. Jesse H. New
lon of Teachers College, Columbia
University. His advocacy of apply
ing progressive methods in school
procedure brought forth sharp
criticism from Dr. Charles H. Judd,
director of the education program of
the National Youth Administration,
who argued that youth should be
subjected to the experience of hard
work in order to become adjusted
to conditions of successful living.
Integrity of colleges and universi
ties is threatened by political pres
sure, especially in state institutions,
declared Dexter Keezer, president of
Reed College, Portland, Ore. Teach
ers are constantly harrassed by be
ing forced to defend themselves
against charges of subversiveness.
