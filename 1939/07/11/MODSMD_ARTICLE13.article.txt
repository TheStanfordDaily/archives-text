# 'Ascent of F-6' Misses Fire; Wilson, Day Carry Reading
## 
### 
Self-abnegation is the solution of-"
fered by "The Ascent of F-6" to the
troubles society suffers today from
war, nationalism and hypocrisy. This
at once dings what was otherwise
a capable reading presented by the
Dramatic Alliance Friday.
A race between Great Britain and
the government of "Ostnia" to climb
Mt. Chormopuloda (F-6 on colonial
maps) and thereby control the native
millions at its base was the theme of
this satire by W. H. Auden and
Christopher Isherwood. Incidental
music arranged by Harry Earl Jones
would never have been missed if
omitted but provided an effective
sound backdrop in spots.
Mr. and Mrs. "A" (Charlton
Laird and Myna Brunton Hughes)
chanted petulant lyrics of dissat
isfaction, illustrating the average
family's reaction to politicians and
propagandists.
England's famous Cliveden set
was parodied by Sir James Ran
som (Clifford Hamer); Lady Isa
bel Welwyn (Virginia Sharpe);
General Dellaby-Couch (Dr. Bay
ard Quincy Morgan); and Lord
Stagmantle (A. Grove Day) as an
undisguised oLrd Beaverbrook. Sir
James and the General missed be
ing types, and so let their parts
down somewhat. Sharpey would
profit by studying fine shades as
well as broad splashes of charac
ter. Mr. Day's jowlings suited the
part and the audience well.
This audience, however, warmed
most to George Z. Wilson as the
veddy veddy British announcer for
"Station 2-L-O, Lon-don," who
broadcast bulletins on the patriotic
assault of forbidding F-6 by moun
taineer Michael Ransom (Charles
Denny). Mr. Denny sympathized
with the part but lacked some in
effable quality of voice required to
make him true. James Stone was
cast as David Gunn, an egomaniac
member of the expedition, but if the
script had not had lan Shawcross
(Ted Marcuse), another of the
climbing party, describe this neu

'rosis, the audience would have
thought him merely screwy.
Marcuse himself hystericized in
conventional dramatic tantrums
when the occasion arose. As Dr.
Williams, mild and sensible fourth
man on the trip, Ralph Parr was
mild and sensible.
Michael saved the "empah." of
course, by topping F-6; his body
was found there by General Blavek
of Ostnia (Marshall Dill). Louis
Hill as the Lost-Horizonesque ab
bot of Chormopuloda was more a
high school principal warning his
class of life's pitfalls than an all
wise monk cautioning Michael
against society's tyrannies.
Louise Linton was the mother,
whose Presence came to Michael in
his dying hour. As such, she was
lovable but insufficiently cosmic.
All of "The Ascent of F-6" might be
so characterized:
It tried hard to be, but was not,
sufficiently cosmic.â€”Leff
