### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
Not long ago, I was talking to Mr.'
Johansen, technical director of the
Department of Speech and Drama,
about his recent European trip. The
avowed purpose of the chat was a
feature story for The Daily, but I
"kyped" it to use in this column.
His departure from the states and
arrival in London were made under
auspicious circumstances. He left
New York in the midst of last fall's
tremendous hurricane, which broke
shop windows on Fifth Avenue, and
arrived in London during the Crisis.
The situation soon resolved itself,
however, and "Jo" turned to the
enthralling job of examining the Eu
ropean stage for new techniques,
mainly in the production end, but
also in writing and acting.
According to "Jo," the Scandina
vian countries are especially active
and progressive in the theater. As
an example of their experimental
fervor, he cited a Sonja Henie-like
production of 'As You Like It' where
the sets were all snow scenes, which
blended the sets and action into a
smooth, exciting production. "Need
less to say, the actors were all ac
complished skaters," "Jo" added.
* * *
"The Swedish are translating
everything. I saw such produc
tions as 'Bury the Dead,' and
'You Can't Take It with You';
also the new Swedish playwrights
are very good. In Gotaborg, there
is one of the most remarkable the
aters I have ever seen, for tech
nical equipment, that is." And
Mr. Johansen went on to talk en
thusiastically of the theatre where
six stage levels allow tremendous
pageants to be put on with scarce
ly a second's wait between shifts,
as well as simple one-set produc
tions.
Mr. Johansen saw a great many
Shakespearean productions abroad,
especially in Germany, where they
are popular. Very few plays with
social themes are produced in Nazi
Germany because the audiences
seek to escape reality in the the

ater. However, one of the most
amusing of the productions was one
of the plays presented in the Brit
ish Drama League contest, in which
the Bard's lines were read with a
thick Scottish accent.
Mr. Johansen spent several months
at the Munich and Hanover opera
houses, where he worked on the
staging of the operas. Munich pos
sesses one of the few theater mu
seums in the world; there a stu
dent of the theater can trace its de
velopment from the early Greek
presentations right through to the
most modern productions. Ameri
cans will soon have the privilege of
seeing some of the museum's exhib
its when that portion of the museum
dealing with Shakespeare's plays
and times are sent on a tour to this
country.
One of the more unusual theatres
that Mr. Johansen visited while in
England was Mr. Nugent-Monck's
in Norwich. There, in a very old
theatre of the Globe theatre type, a
group of amateurs are presenting
every type of play from the classics
to the most modern. Most of his
troupe have been with him for 15
years, and now, though still amateur
in standing, give almost professional
performances.
Of all the interesting things he
told of his experiences on the
Rockefeller Fellowship trip, how
ever, I prefer the theatre that he
saw in Dornach, Switzerland. The
theatre is devoted to the philosophy
of Goethe, and the construction of
the building attempts to express this,
and also follow the ideas of Paul
Cezanne's painting. If it sounds odd,
you should see a picture of it. To
say the total effect is unusual is an
understatement.

"The Swedish are translating
everything. I saw such produc
tions as 'Bury the Dead,' and
'You Can't Take It with You';
also the new Swedish playwrights
are very good. In Gotaborg, there
is one of the most remarkable the
aters I have ever seen, for tech
nical equipment, that is." And
Mr. Johansen went on to talk en
thusiastically of the theatre where
six stage levels allow tremendous
pageants to be put on with scarce
ly a second's wait between shifts,
as well as simple one-set produc
tions.
Mr. Johansen saw a great many
Shakespearean productions abroad,
especially in Germany, where they
are popular. Very few plays with
social themes are produced in Nazi
Germany because the audiences
seek to escape reality in the the

ater. However, one of the most
amusing of the productions was one
of the plays presented in the Brit
ish Drama League contest, in which
the Bard's lines were read with a
thick Scottish accent.
Mr. Johansen spent several months
at the Munich and Hanover opera
houses, where he worked on the
staging of the operas. Munich pos
sesses one of the few theater mu
seums in the world; there a stu
dent of the theater can trace its de
velopment from the early Greek
presentations right through to the
most modern productions. Ameri
cans will soon have the privilege of
seeing some of the museum's exhib
its when that portion of the museum
dealing with Shakespeare's plays
and times are sent on a tour to this
country.
One of the more unusual theatres
that Mr. Johansen visited while in
England was Mr. Nugent-Monck's
in Norwich. There, in a very old
theatre of the Globe theatre type, a
group of amateurs are presenting
every type of play from the classics
to the most modern. Most of his
troupe have been with him for 15
years, and now, though still amateur
in standing, give almost professional
performances.
Of all the interesting things he
told of his experiences on the
Rockefeller Fellowship trip, how
ever, I prefer the theatre that he
saw in Dornach, Switzerland. The
theatre is devoted to the philosophy
of Goethe, and the construction of
the building attempts to express this,
and also follow the ideas of Paul
Cezanne's painting. If it sounds odd,
you should see a picture of it. To
say the total effect is unusual is an
understatement.

Not long ago, I was talking to Mr.'
Johansen, technical director of the
Department of Speech and Drama,
about his recent European trip. The
avowed purpose of the chat was a
feature story for The Daily, but I
"kyped" it to use in this column.
His departure from the states and
arrival in London were made under
auspicious circumstances. He left
New York in the midst of last fall's
tremendous hurricane, which broke
shop windows on Fifth Avenue, and
arrived in London during the Crisis.
The situation soon resolved itself,
however, and "Jo" turned to the
enthralling job of examining the Eu
ropean stage for new techniques,
mainly in the production end, but
also in writing and acting.
According to "Jo," the Scandina
vian countries are especially active
and progressive in the theater. As
an example of their experimental
fervor, he cited a Sonja Henie-like
production of 'As You Like It' where
the sets were all snow scenes, which
blended the sets and action into a
smooth, exciting production. "Need
less to say, the actors were all ac
complished skaters," "Jo" added.
