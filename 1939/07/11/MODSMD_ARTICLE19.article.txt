# Comfort Bans Formal Attire At Stanford
## 
### 
From the chill tundras of New
England to the langorous tropics of
Hawaii, they converge on Stanford
for the summer quarter. Having
heard of Stanford as "the Harvard
of the West," these school teachers
and graduate students and pre
frosh wonder what modes of dress
prevail on the Farm, and to be on
the safe side stick to their full
length hose and choking ties.
However, ever since David Starr
Jordan told a frosh to call him
"Dave" rather than the more for
mal "David," Stanford styles have
been pro the casual and comfortable.
Just as the "cops" shed their offi
cial blue tunics in summer, so at
Stanford students and faculty alike
discard all excess clothing.
For the men, ties are out. So are
jackets. Polo shirts and cotton
slacks, not necessarily creased, plus
brown and white "saddle" shoes are
standard all over the broad acres of
the University, and in Palo Alto
as well.
"Boycott stockings" is the
which Stanford womanhood has long
upheld. Silk, lisle, or cotton, all hos
iery extending above the ankles is
best laid away for future reference
while here. Sport shoes, short
sleeved, light-weight dresses and
combinations, are not only sensible
in these climes and times, but are
"de rigueur" on campus.
And as with attire, so with Stan
ford mores (a word borrowed from
the psych convention), informality
and comfort are the keynotes of stu
dent and faculty work and play.
