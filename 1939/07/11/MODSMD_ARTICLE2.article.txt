# Extra Concert Planned Today
## Roth Quartet Will Play Again Friday 
### 
Lovers of chamber music have an
opportunity to hear the Roth Quar
tet at 4:15 o'clock this afternoon in
addition to the usual Friday after
noon concert. The quartet will offer
the usual alternation of classical,
modern and romantic works, includ
ing quartets by Baillot, Honegger,
and Borodin.
It is the only program of the pres
ent season to contain no music by a
German composer.
Baillot, a French violin virtuoso,
was a contemporary of Beethoven.
He is said to have been the last rep
resentative of the great classical
school of French violin-playing.
Arthur Honegger is best known
for his "King David," "Pacific 231"
and other more startling works; but
his first string quartet exemplifies
modern French chamber music at
its best.
The romantic work which con
cludes the program is the D Major
Quartet by Borodin, a Russian con
temporary of Liszt, Wagner, and
Brahms. The slow movement, "Noc
turno," is one of the most popular
in chamber-music literature.
The program begins at 4:15 o'clock
sharp and will conclude well before
6 o'clock The usual rates prevail.
However, some tickets for students
may be had free at the vestry of the
Memorial Church, as a limited num
ber are available, thanks to Friends
of Music who are away and unable
to use their cards. These will not be
available at the Hall.
