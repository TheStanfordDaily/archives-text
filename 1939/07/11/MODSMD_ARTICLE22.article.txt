# INDIAN SUMMER
## TEXAS JACK 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
YTOW can anyone be so offensives
as John Garner?
How can a pair of bushy eye
brows, a cigar, and a wrinkled suit
decide to run for President? Log
rolling, riding dark horses, and even
hiring shimmy-dancers have pro
duced some pretty wry results at
political conventions, but fate will
certainly out-do herself if this
desert-dried politician, with a smile
scarcely emerged from Darwin's
last phylum, becomes President of
the United States.
Most people have long given
play to their kindest sentiment and
called Cactus Jack "harmless."
Even when he permitted himself
to be a friend-of-the-people front
for liberty-league-like men be
hind him, most of us thought his
cowpuncher hat made him more
humorous than destructive. But
now that he has that gargantuan
hat of his in "the ring," he really
cuts a grim figure, boots and all.
No more grizzly nightmare could
haunt a political science student
than to imagine John Nance Garner
fishing his way into the White
House, and singing cowboy songs to
open the national legislature. That
may sound far-fetched; in fact, it is.
Texas only has 22 electoral votes.
But the old boy is vice-president
now, a sad commentary in itself.
And there are people who suspect
him of having had a hand in the
post-Huey Long campftre meeting
of the House of Representatives in
front of the Capitol Building, when
our congressmen were all jolly fel
lows and sang "Sweet Adeline" and
"The Old Oaken Bucket" while the
Senate labored over the country's
relatively important budget.
* * *
COME smart advertising man, like
Bruce Dish-the-trite-stuff Bar
ton, might get Benny Goodman for
Jack's running mate and seriously
start a third party: Benny to show
enterprising, progressive spirit, and
Garner to reassure America's com
mon folk that a "good, honest,
horse-sensical man was gonna show
them politician fellers a thing or
two." It couldn't be more convinc
ing if it came right out of a Holly
wood Art-butcher's Shoppe, direct
ed by Darryl Zanuck.
Barton would have a fine time
trying to think up a catchy slogan
too. In 1881 it was 'Tippy-canoe
and Tyler too!" In 1917 it was
funnier yet: "Wilson kept us out
of war!" In 1928 it was "A1 Smith,'
the Happy Warrior." And with ma
terial like that homely philosopher
John Garner, just think what a
gag-man could do. "Garner the
Goats for Garner" would prob
ably sweep the country from
Maine to Vermont, and it might
even be fitting to regenerate Tex
as by a revival of "Remember the
Alamo!"
In the meantime we are trying
hard to forget—to forget that John

■Garner does have slightly better
than a cigar-store Indian's chance of
being president of the United States.
It is a little gruesome, somehow.
If Garner is nominated it will gen
uinely restore a relative faith in
hall-row politics.

rolling, riding dark horses, and even
hiring shimmy-dancers have pro
duced some pretty wry results at
political conventions, but fate will
certainly out-do herself if this
desert-dried politician, with a smile
scarcely emerged from Darwin's
last phylum, becomes President of
the United States.
Most people have long given
play to their kindest sentiment and
called Cactus Jack "harmless."
Even when he permitted himself
to be a friend-of-the-people front
for liberty-league-like men be
hind him, most of us thought his
cowpuncher hat made him more
humorous than destructive. But
now that he has that gargantuan
hat of his in "the ring," he really
cuts a grim figure, boots and all.
No more grizzly nightmare could
haunt a political science student
than to imagine John Nance Garner
fishing his way into the White
House, and singing cowboy songs to
open the national legislature. That
may sound far-fetched; in fact, it is.
Texas only has 22 electoral votes.
But the old boy is vice-president
now, a sad commentary in itself.
And there are people who suspect
him of having had a hand in the
post-Huey Long campftre meeting
of the House of Representatives in
front of the Capitol Building, when
our congressmen were all jolly fel
lows and sang "Sweet Adeline" and
"The Old Oaken Bucket" while the
Senate labored over the country's
relatively important budget.

COME smart advertising man, like
Bruce Dish-the-trite-stuff Bar
ton, might get Benny Goodman for
Jack's running mate and seriously
start a third party: Benny to show
enterprising, progressive spirit, and
Garner to reassure America's com
mon folk that a "good, honest,
horse-sensical man was gonna show
them politician fellers a thing or
two." It couldn't be more convinc
ing if it came right out of a Holly
wood Art-butcher's Shoppe, direct
ed by Darryl Zanuck.
Barton would have a fine time
trying to think up a catchy slogan
too. In 1881 it was 'Tippy-canoe
and Tyler too!" In 1917 it was
funnier yet: "Wilson kept us out
of war!" In 1928 it was "A1 Smith,'
the Happy Warrior." And with ma
terial like that homely philosopher
John Garner, just think what a
gag-man could do. "Garner the
Goats for Garner" would prob
ably sweep the country from
Maine to Vermont, and it might
even be fitting to regenerate Tex
as by a revival of "Remember the
Alamo!"
In the meantime we are trying
hard to forget—to forget that John

■Garner does have slightly better
than a cigar-store Indian's chance of
being president of the United States.
It is a little gruesome, somehow.
If Garner is nominated it will gen
uinely restore a relative faith in
hall-row politics.
YTOW can anyone be so offensives
as John Garner?

brows, a cigar, and a wrinkled suit
decide to run for President? Log
