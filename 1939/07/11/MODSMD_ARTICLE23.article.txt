## HISTORIC TOWER ALL WET 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What could have been the main
feature with a bold by-line was a
five-paragraph story on page four in
the last issue of The Daily.
If this sketchy article inspired any
one to go out and see the historic
landmark, he would be sadly disil
lusioned when he ended up by
Searsville Lake where no towers
may be seen floating. The Sandhill
road does not go anywhere near
Frenchman's Tower, although it is
quite attractive to students after
dances, etc.
To get to the tower one goes along
the road in the direction of the Ryan
Lab, but one turns to the right up
Page Mill for about one-half mile
where the tower is to the left of
the road.
If you want to grow up to be a
worthy student of journalism like
your teacher, Mr. Ballard, you
should learn to get the facts straight.
