# STUDENT OPINION SOUGHT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In order to get the general con
sensus of opinion as to what the
student body thinks and would like
to do in the way of amusements,
such as jolly-ups, would it be pos
sible to have the regular "Campus
Opinion" reinstated into The Daily?
The Men's and Women's Councils
would like to know what the Stu
dent Body enjoys in order to plan
activities for the quarter.
I might say that Campus Opin
ions, if reinstated, should be lim
ited, as formerly done, as to the
scope of questions taken up.
