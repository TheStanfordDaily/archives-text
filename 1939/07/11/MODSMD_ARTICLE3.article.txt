### 
Bizarre desert plants of Baja Cali
fornia will be discussed by Dr. Ira L.
Wiggins, associate professor of biol
ogy, on the Stanford Radio Hour
tonight over station KGO at 7:15.
Dr. Wiggins has spent eight months
in the field studying the fantastic
flora of this barren region of the
Mexican peninsula.
Dr. Wiggins will tell about some
of the unusual characteristics of
plants battling to live under desert
conditions. He will describe the
various types of cacti and emphasize
their variations from ordinary
plants. "Among the most charac
teristic plants of the Baja California
desert," states Dr. Wiggins, "are the
cacti, some of which have fleshy
dahlia-like roots; others creep over
the ground like caterpillars; others
are giants 50 feet high."
