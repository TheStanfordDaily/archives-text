# 45 Sign for New Workshop Under Eurich
## 
### 
Forty-five students had enrolled
by yesterday morning in the School
of Education's new "evaluation
workshop."
Designed to stress the evaluation
of pupils' development in relation
to the objectives of their educational
program, the course will last from
July 10 to August 18. The class is
planned for school administrators,
teachers, and supervisors who are
interested in improving and devel
oping their curricula.
During the five-week period, the
class will work on these curricular
and evaluation problems under the
guidance of Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, pro
fessor of education at Stanford, and
a staff that has been assembled from
all parts of the country. Co-opera
tion will be received from the com
mittee on Workshops and Field
Service in the Progressive Educa
tion Association.
The workshop, which commenced
its activities yesterday, is the result
of a recently originated idea. It is
being applied this summer at Stan
ford for the first time.
