ican Way," successful New York
play by George S. Kaufman and
Moss Hart, will be presented to
night by Mrs. Guy Stevens Farring
ton at 8 o'clock in Memorial Hall
auditorium as a program of the

A cavalcade of life in this country

houses. Closed for five weeks fol

World's Fair, it is to be resumed on
July 17 for an indefinite engage
ment.
Well known to the University and
the community for her dramatic
readings, Mrs. Farrington has re
markable control of voice, charac
terization and dialect, and a delight
ful sense of humor. Through her
reading, she is able to create for her
audience both scene and characters,
according to critics who have attend
ed previous readings at the Univer
sity.
"More than a mere chronicle of
America's life and history during the
past four decades, 'The American
Way' is a real, down-to-earth drama;
it has humor, poignancy, and ex
cellent characters with good dialogue
and a stirring end," declare critics.
The program, this week's pres
entation of the Tuesday Evening
Series, has been arranged by the of
fice of the Director of Summer
Quarter.
