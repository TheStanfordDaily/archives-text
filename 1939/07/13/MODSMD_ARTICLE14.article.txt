# Costumes, Sets To Be Featured In 'Tempest'
## 
### 
Decorative scenery and period
costuming rather than the usual
curtained backdrop and modern
dress of the Elizabethan play, will
highlight the presentation of Shake
speare's "Tempest," to be produced
by the Division of Speech and Drama
starting Saturday, July 22, at 8:15
o'clock in the Little Theater.
Though deemed one of the Bard's
most popular plays, noted for its
good low comedy, the "The Tempest"
is rarely produced because of tech
nical difficulties, according to Thom
as Wood Stevens, who is directing
the play. In the Stanford produc
tion, the storm sound effects will tie
in effectively with representative
music to be played on a recorder
under the direction of Paul Barrett.
BERGMAN HEADS CAST
Virgil Bergman, who heads the
cast as Prospero, will be remem
bered for his portrayals of villains
in last summer's productions. Ariel
will be played by Mildred Green and
Ruth Martin, double cast; Alonzo by
J. Edwin Arnold, and Trinculo by
Merle Meacham. Wilma Fitts will
play the part of Juno; Kathleen An
derson will portray Iris, another
goddess. Ralph Parr will play Gon
zalo, and Paul Barrett, Adrian.
SETS ON REVOLVING STAGE
"We are trying to make this a pic
torial production rather than pre
sent the play in Elizabethan style,
with neither props nor sets," de
clared Mr. Stevens. "This will give
the stage crew and prop men a
chance to work in Shakespearean
drama." Waldemar Johansen, man
aging the stage settings, has solved
the set problem by placing decora
tive scenery on a revolving stage.
Charles Fitts has charge of the light
ing; Helen Green is costume direc
tor.
After the opening Saturday night,
"The Tempest" will have five addi
tional performances, the next being
the only matinee, Tuesday, July 25,
at 4:15 o'clock. Remaining per
formances will be July 26 through
29 at 8:15 o'clock. Due to the fact
that the Little Theater has a limited
capacity of 200 seats, it is advised
that seats be reserved in advance
by calling P.A. 22041. All seats are
50 cents.
