# University Press Grows From Small Enterprise
## 
### 
"Big trees from little acorns gTow" could be the motto of the devel
opment of the Stanford University Press. Since the year of its first major
publication in 1895 to its average of 30 titles in 1939, the growth of the
Press has been steady.
Beginning its career in a private shop on the campus back in the
1890's, the Press was run in this manner until 1917, when the plant

was bought by the University. '
As early as 1892 the University
imprint appeared on the first actual
learned publication, a thesis writ
ten at Cornell by O. L. Elliott, then
Registrar, on '"Hie Tariff Policy of
the United States, 1789-1943." The
first book-length publication in
1895, was "Economic Geology," a
syllabus of lectures, by Branner and
Newsom.
FIRST BOOKS PRINTED
In its infancy the major activity
of the Press was confined to the
well known "University Series,"
started in 1908 under the chairman
ship of Vernon Kellogg. Such slack
time as existed was used for the
printing of actual books to be mar
keted.
In 1917 when the University took
over the Press and set it up as a
printing house, a well equipped
plant and personnel was organ
ized. W. A. Friend, manager of the
Press, and Professor William Hawley
Davis, editor, have held these posi
tions since the beginning of the or
ganization.
The plant itself has been located
at various places on the campus,
starting at what is now the corpora
tion yard and ending at its present
location. In 1930 it was greatly en
larged by the addition of the fac
tory building and the photo-lithogra
phy department several years later.
COMPLETE FACILITIES
As a regular printing house, the
Press has all the necessary facilities
of printing, binding, and lithogra
phy, as well as an art and business
department, staffed by 70 employees.
All of the necessary printed matter
for the University, such as cata
logues and bulletins, as well as The
Daily and the Chaparral for the As
sociated Students, are published in
the Press shops.
Books from the Press have a
world-wide distribution through its
local business office and the Oxford
University Press, which acts as its
agent in Great Britain.
