# Hoover Library To Go Up Soon
## Ground Breaking Set For Early August 
### 
Dirt will fly for the new Hoover
Library of War, Revolution, and
Peace about the first of August. "We
could get started right now," stated
A. A. Martinez of the Wagner Con
tracting Company, "but there would
be no point in it." The contractors
are marking time for the next two
weeks until the structural steel is
ready for delivery from the East.
After basement and foundation
have been dug, concrete pouring
will start about the end of August.
A 270-foot skeleton of steel will be
erected and then construction of
walls, floors, and interiors will
commence. It is expected the build
ing will be ready in October or No
vember of 1940 to house the mil
lions of books, pamphlets, newspa
pers, and manuscripts which com
prise one of the largest collections
on recent world history in existence.
13 STACK LEVELS
From its present cramped wing in
the Stanford Library, the Hoover
archives will be transferred to a
270-foot tower facing the Memorial
Theater. Photographic equipment
and the newspaper collection will be
housed in the basement. The first
floor will contain exhibit space,
reading rooms, map rooms, and the
main offices.
Book stacks will start on the sec
ond floor, which is also to include
study facilities and run to the thir
teenth level.
BEACON TOPS TOWER
Carillon bells will be a prominent
feature of the tower, which will be
topped by an airplane beacon and
observation platforms. No special
observance has been planned for the
ground-breaking, according to the
Committee on Public Exercises.
