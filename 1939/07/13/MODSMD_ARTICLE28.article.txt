tures is a broad road — Panama

row of cedar trees. Running the

and Palo Alto.
The "Dinky," as old No. 26 of the
Peninsula Railroad Company was
known, answered the helm for 20
years to Conductor Charles D. Whit

A trolley line was operating in
Palo Alto by 1906 but three years
more went by before Mrs. Stanford's
brother, a university trustee, could
be convinced that rapid transit on
the Farm would not scare the horses.
He, however, owned his own horse
less carriage at the time, and as

■autos were forbidden on Palm Drive,
built the road that parallels it for
his own use.
