# Physical Ed Directors Meet Today
## Dr. Frank to Speak On Fundamental Needs 
### 
Discussing "Women's Functional
Needs, Capacities, Sensibilities, and
Values," Dr. Lawrence K. Frank will
hold the third in his series of sem
inars this afternoon for the dual
national conference of the directors
of physical education for college
women.
NO SOLUTION PROPOSED
Dr. Frank, who is associated with
the Josiah Macy, Jr., Foundation of
New York and is a former member
of the Hoover Research Committee
on Social Trends, is attempting to
point "that understanding of the in
dividual girl as a personality is an
attempt to look at her as emerging
from her past experience." Dr. Frank
himself is proposing no solution to
the problems being studied, but says
that he would like to "see what the
directors meeting at Stanford will
themselves work out."
"What we know about the high
school and college girl," and "Recent
Studies and New Conceptions Basic
for Physical Education" have been
discussed. The concluding seminar
tomorrow will take as a problem,
"Physical Education for Women
Today."
TRIPS PLANNED
Numerous trips to points of inter
est are planned for the delegation,
including visits to Mills College, the
Golden Gate International Exposi
tion, and the University of Califor
nia. The conference will close Sat
urday with a meeting of old and
new members of the board of direc
tors of both the National Association
and the Western Society.
This week's conference of a na
tionwide delegation includes all of
ficials from both the National Asso
ciation of Directors of Physical Edu
cation for College Women and the
Western Society of Departments of
Physical Education for College
Women.
