### 
For each student, graduate or un
dergraduate, registered at Stanford
this summer, one teaching or admin
istrative officer is being employed
by the University.
This fact is revealed by figures,
released by the Registrar last Mon
day, which list a total of 801 officers
in the employ of the University for
the summer quarter, as contrasted
with a registration of 816 students.
Of these, 547 are graduates, while
269 are undergraduates. Of the latter,
125 are Lower Division students.

The School of Education heads the
list of registrations with a total of
349, of which 335 are graduates.
Following in order, they are: the
School of Social Sciences, School of
Letters, Physical Sciences, Business,
Biological Sciences, and Law.
By residence, students from the
western states are far in the lead.
California tops the list with 103 stu
dents. Next in order are Oregon,
with 32, Washington, with 21, Ari
zona, with 20, Utah, with 16, and
Idaho, with 13. New York leads the

account for 15 registrations, Hawaii
leading with 4, followed by Canada

divided.
