# Farm Alumni 'Run' G.G.I.E.

Stanford needs no official exhibit
at the Golden Gate International
Exhibition. Achievements in culture
and administrative genius of alumni
have made Stanford's part in San
Francisco's world fair self-evident to
all students and former graduates.
Long before army dredges started
to build man-made Treasure Island,
Leland Whitman Cutler, Stanford
alumnus, Class of '06, had been
named president of the exposition
and he is still acting in that capacity.
Harris de Haven Connick, Class of
'03, who became director of works
for the Panama Pacific International
Exposition in 1915, is now general
manager in charge of San Fran
cisco's 50 million dollar show.
In other positions of similar and
lesser importance, scores of other
Stanford men and women are work
ing in public relations, engineering,
and scientific branches of the fair.
Among the more recent graduates
that are making the fair a success
are Stanley Beaubaire, who was in
charge of the New York office of
the exposition for two years, and
Charles Fontius, former student
manager who is with the Interna
tional Business Machine Corpora
tion.
