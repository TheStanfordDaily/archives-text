# Turntable Set, Special Effects To Mark Play
## 'Tempest' to Offer Lightning, Thunder On Saturday Night 
### 
Little Theater lights will go up
Saturday at 8:15 o'clock on a ship
rocking in a tempest. Then before
the audience's eyes the scene will
shift instantly to an island cave.
The play will be "The Tempest,"
by Shakespeare, produced by Stan
ford's Division of Speech and Drama.
The effect will come from a set de
vised for this production by Mr.
Waldemar Johansen, technical direc
tor. "The Tempest" is a long play
and in order to speed up the show
Mr. Johansen has built a small re
volving stage.
BLACKOUT SCENE SHIFTS
As shown in the sketch, an im
pressionistic ship is seen to the right
and a stylized cave, the cell of Pros
pero, to the left. Action will take
place all over and around this set,
with scenes changing in a blackout
as down in the basement a wheel is
turned to rotate the superstructure.
The rocking of the ship will be
achieved by balancing part of the
backdrop on pivots with a concealed
student stagehand to shake it. "That
ship is going to shake," assures the
technical director, "so everybody will
get a little seasick."
RECONSTRUCTED SET
Mr. Johansen "dreamed up" the
idea and built a tiny cardboard mod
el over the Fourth of July. Then
the full-size set was built of ply
wood, a hole drilled in the stage,
and the revolving mechanism in
stalled. This done, it was decided
to shift the entire rig 18 inches back
stage, so it was torn up and is now
being reconstructed by the stage
craft class. The old hole remains,
however. At that, the set is costing
only about $35.
The one sizeable prop in this pro
duction of "The Tempest" will be a

table from which a repast will dis
appear at the stroke of a hand.
The methods of having one scene
dissolve into another makes lighting
problems especially difficult, accord
ing to Charles Fitts, lighting direc
tor. Pools of illumination must be
made to match on all sides as the
stage turns.
The boat scene will be a dank
green, but the rest of the show, ex
cept for the storm, will be lavender,
rose, and other warm tints to set
off colorful Renaissance costumes.
Lights will be operated by Lois

Feldheym, Ruth Jordan, and Chet
Johnson.
In the storm, lightning will flash,
thunder crash, and the surf will
roar. The lightning will come from
footlights raised overhead and oper
ated by a switch brought from the
old Assembly Hall. Sheets of sheet
iron will be banged to produce
thunder, and a tilting trough full of
peas or gravel will simulate the
surf.
"It's going to be a good show,"
declares Mr. Johansen. "There's
lots of humor in "The Tempest."

as down in the basement a wheel is
turned to rotate the superstructure.
The rocking of the ship will be
achieved by balancing part of the
backdrop on pivots with a concealed
student stagehand to shake it. "That
ship is going to shake," assures the
technical director, "so everybody will
get a little seasick."
RECONSTRUCTED SET
Mr. Johansen "dreamed up" the
idea and built a tiny cardboard mod
el over the Fourth of July. Then
the full-size set was built of ply
wood, a hole drilled in the stage,
and the revolving mechanism in
stalled. This done, it was decided
to shift the entire rig 18 inches back
stage, so it was torn up and is now
being reconstructed by the stage
craft class. The old hole remains,
however. At that, the set is costing
only about $35.
The one sizeable prop in this pro
duction of "The Tempest" will be a

table from which a repast will dis
appear at the stroke of a hand.
The methods of having one scene
dissolve into another makes lighting
problems especially difficult, accord
ing to Charles Fitts, lighting direc
tor. Pools of illumination must be
made to match on all sides as the
stage turns.
The boat scene will be a dank
green, but the rest of the show, ex
cept for the storm, will be lavender,
rose, and other warm tints to set
off colorful Renaissance costumes.
Lights will be operated by Lois

Feldheym, Ruth Jordan, and Chet
Johnson.
In the storm, lightning will flash,
thunder crash, and the surf will
roar. The lightning will come from
footlights raised overhead and oper
ated by a switch brought from the
old Assembly Hall. Sheets of sheet
iron will be banged to produce
thunder, and a tilting trough full of
peas or gravel will simulate the
surf.
"It's going to be a good show,"
declares Mr. Johansen. "There's
lots of humor in "The Tempest."
Little Theater lights will go up
Saturday at 8:15 o'clock on a ship
rocking in a tempest. Then before
the audience's eyes the scene will
shift instantly to an island cave.
The play will be "The Tempest,"
by Shakespeare, produced by Stan
ford's Division of Speech and Drama.
The effect will come from a set de
vised for this production by Mr.
Waldemar Johansen, technical direc
tor. "The Tempest" is a long play
and in order to speed up the show
Mr. Johansen has built a small re
volving stage.
BLACKOUT SCENE SHIFTS
As shown in the sketch, an im
pressionistic ship is seen to the right
and a stylized cave, the cell of Pros
pero, to the left. Action will take
place all over and around this set,
with scenes changing in a blackout
as down in the basement a wheel is
turned to rotate the superstructure.
The rocking of the ship will be
achieved by balancing part of the
backdrop on pivots with a concealed
student stagehand to shake it. "That
ship is going to shake," assures the
technical director, "so everybody will
