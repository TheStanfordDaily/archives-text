jV/lAYBE it's because every jury
comedy has to have the twelve
good men, etc., but they do say that
if you saw Ram's Head's reading of
"Ladies of the Jury," you can skip
Helen Hayes' box-office smash in the
city.
The semi-setting of the reading
of "The Ascent of F6" the other
night was to my mind one of the
better things in readings. Perhaps
reading in front of a backdrop at
one long table calls forth more
from the participants, but I liked
the way the mountain peaks
helped to give the feeling of the
play.

From Dr. Margery Bailey, who is
heading the Dramatists' Alliance
group this summer comes the news
that they are branching out into the
movie field. Dramatist's Alliance is
keeping a record in Technicolor film
of all the Shakespearean perform
ances that are given in the sum
mer quarter's drama festivals.
The collection now includes mov
ies of "Antony and Cleopatra" and
"Twelfth Night," and plans are un
der way for shooting "The Tempest"
under the direction of Mr. Stevens.
The movies are made in the Amphi
theater on eight millimeter Koda
chrome by Margaret Hamilton
Storey.
The full series will be shown as
one of the interests of the Drama
tist's Alliance Assembly Week,
August 1-5.

For those cityward going people on
the campus, I pass along two swell
ways of spending time. The first,
"The Ice Follies," which is filling
Winterland to capacity, makes a
swell way of spending a refreshing
evening. Don't sit farther down than

the fifth row, though, because it
gets cold down there. Also Kay Ky
ser is conducting his "musical col
lege" ever on the island. Oh, yes,
Martha Raye and Tony Martin open
for a week Wednesday at the Golden
Gate.
