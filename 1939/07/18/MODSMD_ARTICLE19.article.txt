# Track Mentor May Resign
## Templeton Considers Newspaper Position 
### 
Rumor that Dink Templeton, Stan
ford track mentor, will resign his po
sition in favor of a newspaper job
has caused much speculation
among followers of Stanford track
teams.
The problem of producing teams
that will maintain Stanford's pres
ent position in N.C.2-A. and Pacific
Coast track circles will undoubtedly
take on added weight if Templeton
should give up his position here. It
is a known fact that the success of
Indian track teams is and has been
largely due to the ability of Dink
Templeton to bring out the best in
each man.
CHAMPIONS DEVELOPED
During his 20 years of coaching,
Templeton has taken charge of nu
merous athletes with little or no
prep school experience and built
champions of them. Ben Eastman,
Johnny Lyman, and more recently,
Pete Zagar are but three of the
champions developed by Templeton.
The rumor that the Stanford men
tor will resign has, as yet, no defi
nite foundation. Templeton dis
cussed the matter earlier this month
with Dr. Thomas Storey, head of
the department of physical educa
tion. Dr. Storey states that at that
time, Templeton appeared ready to
resign, and that Templeton is the
only person who knows definitely
whether or not the rumor is true.
NEWSPAPER LURES DINK
It has been a known fact for some
time that the Stanford mentor has
been seriously considering an offer
by Charlie Paddock, Los Angeles
sports editor, to join his staff. Should
Templeton resign, it is almost cer
tain that he will accept Paddock's
offer.
With the exception of Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, who said he would be
"surprised" if Templeton resigned,
campus authorities have expressed
no amazement at the rumor.
