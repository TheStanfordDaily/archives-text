# Eurich to Discuss 'Changing College'

Why do colleges exist? Why
should they be supported by society?
What should they do for the stu
dents enrolled?
Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, professor of
education, will attempt to answer
these questions on the Stanford Ra
dio Hour at 7:15 o'clock Wednesday
evening over KGO. The talk is en

Eurich will further show how col

needs of students.
