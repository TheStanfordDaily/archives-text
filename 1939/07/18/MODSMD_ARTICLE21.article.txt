# Publishers Present Modern McGuffeys in Text Exhibit
## 
### 
The exhibit of textbooks in Room
300 on the Quad has everything but
Pacifica and the Gayway. For the
rest of the week approximately 43
publishers of school books will dis
play here their latest in Reading,
'Riting, and 'Rithmetic.
Also offered are crisp bright vol
umes in every shade of the spectrum
on such topics as Social Living,
Physiography, and Sex Education.
During 1939-40, grammar school
children will study Character
Building, Accident Prevention, and
Driving. They will do home work
in Commercial Law, and Memory
Improvement.
McGuffey's Reader suited our
grandparents, but streamlined edu
cation offers such titles as "Read An
other Story," "Donald Duck and His
Friends," and "Reading for Fun."
Arithmetic used to be a matter of
A, B, and C and their respective
apples. Now the publishers promote
brilliant cards, each with a sum,
to be flashed before the third
grader. At home, the pupil's father
can get problems wrong in "My
Practice Book in Arithmetic."
Three textbooks whose titles illus
trate the modern trend are labelled
"Facts and Fancies," "Whys and
Wherefores," and "Marihuana."
The hundreds of books in Room
300 are displayed on undraped lab
tables, placed in severe rows.
That purveyors of texts keep their
fingers on the world's pulse is evi
denced by a crayon or watercolor
book, "Little Citizens and Their

•Flags" in which tiny fingers are in
vited to smear the colors on the
flags of the United States, France,
Italy, Japan, and others. Even the
yellow hammer and sickle of the
U.S.S.R. is offered, but the* German
swastika is missing.
