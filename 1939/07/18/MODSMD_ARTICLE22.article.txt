# Stanford Golfers Point for Finals
## 
### 
Golfers successful in the early
stages of the Stanford Invitational
Tournament are polishing up their
form this week in preparation for
the final rounds of match play to be
held this Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday.
Two elimination rounds in the
championship flight leave Warren
Berl defending champion, Mat Pala
cio, medalist, Bud Finger, and
Charles de Bretteville among those
fighting it out for the title.
The entry list of 152 sets a record
for the number of players compet
ing in the Invitational. Because of
the large size of the field there are
seven flights in addition to the title
round.
