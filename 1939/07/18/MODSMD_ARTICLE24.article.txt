# Scope and Non-Sequences

### DWIGHT MITCHELL 
TEXTBOOKS are on ex- 4
hibit this week in Room 300,
Engineering Building. Approximate
ly 43 publishers are showing from
a half dozen to 100 books each, on
virtually every phase of education.
The exhibit is an annual affair
sponsored by the School of Educa
tion. Usually it is given during the
Educational Conference but was
held later this year on account of
the fact that the conference is a
busy time for teachers to examine
books at leisure and because many
of the same books were on exhibi
tion at the National Education As
sociation conference in San Fran
cisco.

Approximately 70 teachers of the
Language Arts are working, under
supervision of a committee of the
Stanford Education faculty, toward
completion of a three-year inves
tigation which is expected to throw
additional light on problems of jun
ior and senior high school teaching
of English, foreign languages and
social studies.
Each member of the group is writ
ing up results of his experimental
work during the past two years and
making plans to adjust further his
classroom procedures in the light of
results observed thus far. Publica
tion of a considerable mass of val
uable educational material is antici
pated.
In connection with their work, the
Language Arts Investigators have an
exhibit in the Education Building of
work carried out in numerous west
ern high schools. First exhibit to go
up was a mural from West Seattle
High School, Seattle, Wash.

If there is no end to the making
of books it should follow as a corol
lary that of the making of bibliog
raphies there is no end. Just try
enrolling in almost any Education
course. Immediately you are handed
a thick sheaf of mimeographed paper
listing scads of books and articles

'pertaining to your subject. Nobody
expects you to read all of them and
nobody will stop you if you try to.
But you can add these bibliogra
phies to your notebooks and maybe
get a spurious feeling of accom
plishment. Next fall you can im
press the folks back home with
them, for somebody might think you
really read all the books listed in
them. Probably you can't bring
them back next summer and thus
escape paying a syllabus fee, but
whatever else you do with these
bibliographies, keep them, for they
are the index to immense quantities
of valuable knowledge. (Professor,
will that hold 'em?)
