# State Editors Hold Midyear Meeting Here
## Assets, Liabilities, Problems of Press Discussed by Group 
### 
"Let's Look at Our Job" was the
title of an address by Donald J.
Sterling, managing editor of the
Oregon Journal, given before mem

forms of news dissemination should
be regarded as allies, advised Mr.
Sterling. "There is no point in see

newsbroadcasting. It is here, and

changes in the industrial revolution.
