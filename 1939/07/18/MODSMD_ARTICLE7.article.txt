# State Editors Hold Midyear Meeting Here
## Assets, Liabilities, Problems of Press Discussed by Group 
### 
"Let's Look at Our Job" was the
title of an address by Donald J.
Sterling, managing editor of the
Oregon Journal, given before mem
bers of the California Newspaper
Publishers Association at a banquet
in the Stanford Union Saturday
night.
For two days last week newspa
per men of the state, here for their
annual midyear editorial conference,
did look at their job, from all angles.
STRESSES COMMON ASSET
"Successful newspapers of any
age have enjoyed in common the one
essential asset, which is reader con
fidence," said Mr. Sterilng, who is
also president of the American So
ciety of Newspaper Editors. "Not
Polly anna poppycock, but just
common sense" is the policy adopted
by the general run of newspapers in
avoiding unfairness and control by
advertisers, two things which tend
to destroy confidence.
News broadcasting and other
forms of news dissemination should
be regarded as allies, advised Mr.
Sterling. "There is no point in see
ing things under the bed about
newsbroadcasting. It is here, and
here to stay."
SOCIAL ISSUES TOUCHED
From the standpoint of editorial
policies, three major social issues in
California were discussed Saturday
afternoon. Editors heard Professor
William S. Hopkins predict the "in
evitable end of small farming" and
continuance of the "agricultural
revolution" which will turn all
small farmers into "landless, prop
ertyless working people." He also
envisages the establishment of
large-scale "out-door food facto
ries," paralleling manufacturing
changes in the industrial revolution.
PRESS POLITICS HIT
Professor Edwin A. Cottrell, head
of the political science department,
described the history and value of
the initiative and referendum in
California politics. He mentioned the
fact that the press has criticized
these methods and opposed issues
presented to them, but claimed that
time has shown "the people have
been more nearly right than the leg
islators." He suggested that news
papers interpret more fully the
questions on the ballot.
Such technical newspaper prob
lems as departmentalization of the
news, what to display on the front
page, and how to use photographs
correctly in the paper were treated
in the morning sessions by Lawrence
Fanning of the San Francisco
Chronicle, Frank A. Clarvoe of the
San Francisco News, Robert F.
Franklin of the Bakersfield Califor
nian, and Jack S. McDowell of the
Turlock Journal.
More than 60 species of mosqui
toes are known to exist in the
United States.
