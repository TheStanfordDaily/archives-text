# Guest Clarinetist To Aid Quartet
## 
### 
Rudolph Schmitt, first clarinetist
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, will assist the Roth Quartet
in both concerts this week. This
afternoon the Quintet by Brahms
will be featured, and on Friday eve
ning the Quintet by Mozart, both
for clarinet and strings. The Brahms
performance will be an event of rare
significance, while the Mozart Quin
tet is familiar and popular.
American composers will be rep
resented by Daniel Gregory Mason's
"Serenade" on this afternoon's pro
gram, and by Roy Harris' Four Pre
ludes and Fugues for string quar
tet Friday evening. The latter work,
dedicated to the Roth Quartet, is to
be played for the first time.
