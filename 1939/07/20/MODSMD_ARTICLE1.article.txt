# Hotel Head Defends Private Business in Conference Talk
## Lucius Boomer Warns Executives Of Taxation's Threat to Enterprise 
### 
A challenge to see that private enterprises are not overwhelmed was
flung to all business men by Mr. Lucius Boomer, president of the Wal
dorf-Astoria Hotel, last night at the dinner meeting of the Stanford Third
Annual Business Conference.
Speaking on the "Current Challenge to Private Enterprise," Mr.
Boomer pointed out that the objective of private enterprise is to ere-

ate more wealth and that saving is
basic to national wealth.
"To increase wealth is to make
available the essential means to the
more abundant life; to destroy
wealth is to impoverish. Clearly, to
increase it is not merely to move it
about; to take it from one point of
accumulation and put it at another;
or to dissipate it by dividing it into
small fragments, making it thereby
ineffective."
In speaking of the danger of ex
tinction of private enterprise by
cost of government through taxa
tion he said:
"A sound system of taxation must
be based on the desirability of
greater national wealth; conservation
must be encouraged and diminution
of capital by wasteful spending must
be discouraged."
Business must have courage, de
clared Boomer, to face pressure
groups in many new forms and to
see that private enterprises are not
overwhelmed. There is danger of
the government not being the agent
of the common people but of the
pressure groups in special interest.
In partial answer to the problem,
Boomer suggested that business
should resell itself to the American
people. It must tell and retell its
success stories and reawaken the
public interest in successful private
business—not only to their own ad
vantage; but to general good for all.
Other problems of concern that
were cited are government competi
tion in business and right of owners
of enterprises as a minority to have
something to say in labor disputes.
