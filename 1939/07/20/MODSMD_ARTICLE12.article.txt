# Librarian Finds Old Document
## Souvenir Tells Tale Of Human Bondage 
### 
A small battered book which lay
for years on a shelf in the Felton
Room, on the third floor of the
library, has recently yielded a relic
of those days when one man sold
himself to another as a bondsman.
The volume, a collection of letters
by John Wilkes published in 1769,
was discovered by the Felton Room
librarian, Miss Violet Shue, to be
jacketed with two thin sheets of
parchment or vellum.
Unfolded, these appear to be frag
ments of an indenture involving two
men and a sum of money. Each
sheet is roughly 6 by 12 inches and
was apparently snipped out of a
much larger document. Only the
first few lines are legible. According
to Nathan Van Patten, director of
Stanford libraries, such souvenirs of
the 18th and early 19th centuries are
by no means rare. Consequently, no
plans are being made to submit the
antique to expert examination.
The book itself, according to a
note on the cover, is "From the
library of W. M. Thackeray." It was
presented to the collection by Mrs.
Kate Felton Elkins, daughter of the
founder, Charlotte Ashley Felton.
The Felton Room, on the third
floor of the library, is a richly fur
nished parlor full of finely bound
books of fiction and first editions,
and other ilterary curiosities. It is
open to the public on week days
from 1:30 to 4:30 o'clock.
