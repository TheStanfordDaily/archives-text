# Inge Reviews "Religious Experience" by Trueblood
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: Dr. W. R. Inge,
long dean of St. Paul's Cathedral,
London, who reviews Dr. D. El
ton Trueblood's latest volume,
"The Trustworthiness of Religious
Experience," is one of Europe's
outstanding philosophers and re
ligious thinkers.)

The subject of this excellent lec
ture is the fundamental question of
religion. How far is that state of
consciousness which is variously
called the mystical vision, the inner
light, the testimony of the Holy
Spirit and religious experience to be
trusted as a revelation of objective
truth?
It is the crucial problem in re
ligion for the famous "proofs" of the
existence of God do not bring us to
the God of religion. Miracle and
prophecy, even if they can be proved,
do not prove anything that is im
portant for religion. They are still
on the plane of scientific or historical
fact, and religion deals with the un
seen, the timeless, the spiritual. The
external authority of the Church de
pends on the source of its authority.
All our faith ultimately stands or
falls with the validity of what we
now call religious experience.
• • *
Can we rely on the inner light?
Certainly not always. The old mys
tics, such as the author of the "Theo
logia Germanica," warn us most se
riously against what they call the
false light, which they regard as a
snare of the evil one. Catholic writ
ers, who give importance to what
they call mystical phenomena, are
obliged to find tests to distinguish
these supernatural favours from
contrefagons diaboliques.
The mind thinks that it has ex
perienced what it has been led to
expect. A striking instance is the
phenomenon of instantaneous con
version, which John Wesley believ
ed, from observation among his dis
ciples, to be universal, but which
even Methodists now recognize to be
an unusual even Methodists now
recognise to be an unusual experi
ence. Spiritual ambition, Schwar
merci and (as we see from the rec
ords of many female mystics) sup
pressed eroticism all play their part.
In spite of the extreme difficulty
of describing experiences which
language was not formed to de
scribe, and the treacherousness of
memory in recalling fugitive and
formless communications, the testi
mony of contemplatives is, as the
author of this lecture insists, both
emphatic and singularly harmo
nious.
* * *
If we reject it, it must be be

►cause we have chosen a philosophy
which rules out, to start with, the
possibility of intercourse with ob
jective spiritual reality. The mate
rialism of the nineteenth century,
the agnosticism which does all its
serious thinking on the hypothesis
that the spiritual world is only a
luminous haze floating ineffectually
over the surface of the real world,
the pragmatism of William James
and his followers, who hold that
truth is whatever it suits us to be
lieve, so that we may believe what
we will at our own risk—these and
other modern philosophies are in
compatible with the Christian view
of reality.
A true philosophy must find room
for all aspects of truth. It must rec
ognise that our preconception of the
absolute values, which for the relig
ious mind are the revelation of the
nature and character of God, is as
clear and worthy of respect as our
perception of visible objects. We
have no right whatever to exclude
this knowledge as necessarily un
trustworthy or merely subjective. It
is one of the fundamental facts for
which philosphy has to account.

Experience," is one of Europe's

ligious thinkers.)

The subject of this excellent lec
ture is the fundamental question of
religion. How far is that state of
consciousness which is variously
called the mystical vision, the inner
light, the testimony of the Holy
Spirit and religious experience to be
trusted as a revelation of objective
truth?
It is the crucial problem in re
ligion for the famous "proofs" of the
existence of God do not bring us to
the God of religion. Miracle and
prophecy, even if they can be proved,
do not prove anything that is im
portant for religion. They are still
on the plane of scientific or historical
fact, and religion deals with the un
seen, the timeless, the spiritual. The
external authority of the Church de
pends on the source of its authority.
All our faith ultimately stands or
falls with the validity of what we
now call religious experience.
• • *
Can we rely on the inner light?
Certainly not always. The old mys
tics, such as the author of the "Theo
logia Germanica," warn us most se
riously against what they call the
false light, which they regard as a
snare of the evil one. Catholic writ
ers, who give importance to what
they call mystical phenomena, are
obliged to find tests to distinguish
these supernatural favours from
contrefagons diaboliques.
The mind thinks that it has ex
perienced what it has been led to
expect. A striking instance is the
phenomenon of instantaneous con
version, which John Wesley believ
ed, from observation among his dis
ciples, to be universal, but which
even Methodists now recognize to be
an unusual even Methodists now
recognise to be an unusual experi
ence. Spiritual ambition, Schwar
merci and (as we see from the rec
ords of many female mystics) sup
pressed eroticism all play their part.
In spite of the extreme difficulty
of describing experiences which
language was not formed to de
scribe, and the treacherousness of
memory in recalling fugitive and
formless communications, the testi
mony of contemplatives is, as the
author of this lecture insists, both
emphatic and singularly harmo
nious.

If we reject it, it must be be

►cause we have chosen a philosophy
which rules out, to start with, the
possibility of intercourse with ob

rialism of the nineteenth century,
the agnosticism which does all its
serious thinking on the hypothesis
that the spiritual world is only a
luminous haze floating ineffectually
over the surface of the real world,
the pragmatism of William James
and his followers, who hold that
truth is whatever it suits us to be
lieve, so that we may believe what
we will at our own risk—these and
other modern philosophies are in

of reality.
A true philosophy must find room
for all aspects of truth. It must rec
