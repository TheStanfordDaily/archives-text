# Dee Gee Checks Stolen by Forger
## 
### 
Along a trail of forged checks to
taling over $200, police are seeking
J. K. Stokes, who, they believe, cop
ied the signature of a Stanford so
rority official with such accuracy as
to fool four peninsula cities.
Stokes is reported to have stolen
45 blank checks from Delta Gamma
house last week, forged "Theresa L.
Tate" on them, passed $117.50 worth
in Palo Alto, and others in San
Francisco, San Jose, and Redwood
City.
Stokes was arrested in Palo Alto
two years ago for bad checks, ac
cording to police reports. Later that
year he was given a 14-year sen
tence in Idaho for forgery.
Hudson Bay is not a bay, but an
inland sea.
