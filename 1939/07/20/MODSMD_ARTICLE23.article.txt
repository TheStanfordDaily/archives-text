# Famous Poet Visiting Here For Vacation

"The proletarian movement in
prose has not as yet carried over
into the field of poetry and prob
ably never will," believes John
Gould Fletcher, winner of the Pul
itzer Prize in poetry in 1938, who
arrived in Paol Alto Monday from
his home in Little Rock for a visit
of several months.
"Although there is no definite
trend in poetry comparable to the
proletarian movement in prose lit
erature," continued the poet, "there
seems to be a tendency toward a
modem type of verse drama which
may appear over the radio in the
near future."
That social changes since the
World War have brought about a
decline of interest in poetry is the
opinion of Mr. Fletcher, who believes
that "the last period of really good
poetry was from 1913 to 1926."
The poet has been in California
before, having visited San Francisco
in 1915 for the Panama-Pacific In
ternational Exposition, but this is
his first visit to Palo Alto. Although
he plans to spend most of his time
viewing the exhibits at the Golden
Gate International Exposition on
Treasure Island, Mr. Fletcher ex
pressed interest in Stanford's dra
matic productions and plans to at
tend the initial performance of "The
Tempest" on the campus Saturday
night.
