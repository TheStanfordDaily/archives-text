### DWIGHT MITCHELL 
CINCE a full stomach powerfully
inhibits combativeness, this
paragraph is an earnest plea to the
Union chef, cooks, and dispensers of
food in general to pile the plates
heavily at the Education Club lunch
eon today.
For Dr. Ernest R. Hilgard, profes
sor of psychology, is going to stick
out his neck by discussing the high
ly controversial topic, "Should Pu
pils Be Permitted to Fail?"
* ♦ *
Dr. Hilgard is pinch-hitting for
Dr. Walter Thompson, professor of
political science, who was scheduled
to talk on the Harry Bridges case,
but whose lips were effectually
sealed by a subpoena to appear as a
witness in the case.

A recent Guest Column brought
an eloquent protest from that famous
and prolific poet, philosopher, writ
er-of-letters-to-editors and ageless
man about town, Old Man Anony
mous. This übiquitous scribbler,
whose productions have been thrown
away by the thousands in every edi
torial office in the civilized world, is
getting a better break here, for he
has a nice, controversial point to
make.
With allowances for my inade
quacy with his handwriting (no of
fense; mine's terrible), I present his
message herewith:
"I happen to be the poor sin
ner pilloried by Mr. McGuirk in
today's Daily as an ignorant and
prejudiced hater of swing. So I
am; and the incident is reported
correctly. To the expert in such
matters, "My Heart Belongs to
Daddy" may not be swing, but it's

all one to me; but if I want to
hear the "Rain Song of the Anda
man Islanders" I'll go to the Anda
man Islands. Why must I hear
more primitive music before I've
had my breakfast? The dying
wheeze of a justly decaying civi
livation.
—One Who Is Afraid
to Sign His Name
Well, what do YOU think? And
YOU and YOU and YOU? Write
your message and leave it in the
cigar box (not intended as free ad
vertising for Cremo) at the foot of
the stairway in Education Building.
THANKS to those who put news
in that cigar box. It's in this paper
unless the editor got hard boiled—
which he has frequently done. Let's
have MORE NEWS.
