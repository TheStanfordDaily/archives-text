### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
CEEN at "Ladies and Gentlemen"
the other night—half the Stan
ford campus.
Prevailing opinion doesn't give the
play the break that the Chronicle's
reviewer did. If it runs more than
a month on Broadway, Broadway
isn't the toughie it's cracked up to
be. 'Miss Hayes, as always, was su
perb, and the character delineations
were individual gems. However, the
play is weak.
Witnessed some rehearsals of "The
Tempest"; it promises to be a good
show. The production which Mr.
Stevens gave it in San Diego was
very good, and this promises to be
far better.
Helen Green has designed the
fanciest collection of wigs for—let's
call it "The Big Wind," just for a
change—ever seen over in the Little
Theater. The golden wood-shaving
creation for Ariel, the sea-weed
coiffure for the mermaid, and the
Greek hair-dos for the various god
desses are all extra-special.

At the first performance Saturday
night, Millie Green will play Ariel;
Virginia Rogers, Miranda; and Nel
lie Fitts, Juno. Ruth Martin, Joyce
Clumeck, and June Olson, respec
tively, will play those roles on alter
nate nights.
The advanced costume design
class will exhibit its work in the
foyer of the Little Theater during
the run of "The Tempest."

Another item for Shakespeare
fans: The Wayfarer's Playhouse in
the City, 1749 Clay, is presenting
"Measure for Measure" in modern
dress this Friday and Saturday
nights. Their performances of
"Taming of the Shrew" were sup
posed to be super, and they say

'"Measure for Measui-e" should be
just as good.

Phyllis Lakin, who was one of
the shining lights of the Stanford
stage, several years ago, will he
treading the hoards again this
week-end in the Community The
ater's production of "Girls in Uni
form."
