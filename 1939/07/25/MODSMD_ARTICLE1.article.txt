# Tempest' Opens Week Run With Brilliant Performance
## Costumes, Make-Up, Setting Add Greatly to Realism of Production 
### 
In Shakespeare's own time, "The Tempest" was played in a bare loft
of a theatre, with few props, and young boys in the female parts.
Saturday night in the Little Theater, "The Tempest" was played as if
Prospero's magic isle had really existed, and Ariel and Caliban once
lived. Waldemar Johansen's set showed a real ship rocking among real

waves, with real thunder, and light
ning revealing huddled courtiers
and mariners genuinely terrified by
a convincing tempest.

"The Tempest" will continue its
run in the Little Theater of Stan
ford Memorial Hall today, Tues
day, July 25 at 4:15 o'clock, and
Wednesday, July 26 through Satur
day, July 29 at 8:15 o'clock daily.
Seats are 50 cents, and may be
reserved in advance by telephon
ing Palo Alto 22041.

Thomas Wood Stevens' production
of Shakespeare's "The Tempest"
was a candid enactment of a tale of
human jealousies and superhuman
magic. Because they did not point
attention to the fact that they were
"acting" one of the finest plays of a
great playwright, but took the script
at face value, the entire cast was
able to deliver a strong and truth
ful interpretation of the real Shake
speare, co-operating to give a total
effect of beauty and force.
Ariel stole the show. When Mil
dred Green applied the grease
paint and donned her golden cos
tume, she really became an "Airy
Spirit." Her piquant trills of voice,
her sly gestures and saucy poses,
not only satisfied the requirements
of the part but endeared the little
sprite to the 200 members of an
audience which packed the Little
Theater.
PROSPERO SLURS VERSE
Vergil Bergman, cast as Prospero,
succeeded only partly in projecting
the poetry and meaning of his lines.
An occasional perfunctoriness of
speech tended to slur the deeper
meaning of the verse.
Ferdinand (Ted Marcuse) and Mi
randa (Virginia Rogers) were lov
able juveniles; their parts left them
little scope to be anything more.
They carried off the inanity of their
lines a little with tongue in cheek,
but this added to the play for a
modern audience.
The part of Caliban, the witch
born slave of Prospero, is difficult
because of the ease with which it
can be overplayed. William Dusel
found to a nicety just how far hor
rible mouthings and bestial motions
would go to make the brute seem
real.
Trinculo (Merle Meacham) and
Stephano (Charles Buoltti) played
the buffoon and the drunk with
precision, and avoided falling over
into vaudevillainry.
KING READ WELL
A wicked scheming pair were Se
bastian (Asher Wilson) and An
tonio (Fred Giari). They did their
Machiavellian plotting with Machia
vellian zest, and handled their ra
piers gracefully.
Goddess-like in their brief ap
pearance were Virginia Sharpe,
Wilma Fitts, and Kathleen Ander
son as the goddesses Ceres, Juno,
and Iris. Paul Barrett handled the
part of Adrian well.
Important to the success of "The
Tempest" was the lighting which set
off Helen Green's elaborate and au
thentic costumes. The lights were
designed by Charles Fitts and oper
ated by Lois Feldhym, Chester
Johnson, and Ruth Jordan.
