# Dr. Thompson Explains Stand On Subpoena
## 
### 
Professor Walter Thompson of the
Stanford political science faculty is
sued the following statement Satur
day to avoid any confusion of pub
licity released in regard to his pos
sible appearance as a defense witness
in the Bridges deportation hearing.
"I have not been served with a
subpoena to appear at the hearing.
I do not know whether I shall be
summoned to appear at the hearing.
Like the late Will Rogers, 'all I
know is what I see in the papers.'
"If I am subpoenaed by the de
fense, I would technically be a de
fense witness for Mr. Bridges. How
ever, that is a mere technicality.
Any statements I would make re
garding Marxian philosophy, as
viewed from the standpoint of po
litical theory, would be as objec
tive and detached as if the hearing
were a graduate seminar. If either
the government or the defense has
any use for such testimony, they are
welcome to it."
