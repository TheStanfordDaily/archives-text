# Storey Films 'Tempest' Cast
## Student Group Goes On Movie 'Location' 
### 
The cast of "The Tempest" went
"on location" yesterday afternoon in
the Frost Amphitheater, and made
a motion picture of the famous
Shakespeare comedy.
This full-color movie will be
played Saturday, August 5, in the
Women's Clubhouse auditorium at
10 a.m. and will be open to the
public. Color films of "Anthony
and Cleopatra," and "Twelfth Night"
will be run off on the same pro
gram. These latter Shakespeare
plays were produced at Stanford in
1936 and 1937 respectively, and
were filmed by what is now the
Dramatist's Alliance, the head of
which is Dr. Margery Bailey.
PARTIAL FILMING
Like the others, 'The Tempest"
will be recorded on eight milli
meter kodachrome. The entire play
will not be photographed, but a run
ning sequence of all scenes will
make the costume record, which is
the original purpose of the project.
Behind the camera was Miss Mar
garet Storey, who used a parasol,
blanket, and rain cape for an im
promptu field dark room out in the
amphitheater. She remarked that it
shut out light so successfully, she
couldn't see to load the camera.
LIBRARY TO HOLD FILMS
According to Dr. Bailey, the films
of Stanford's Shakesperean produc
tions will be turned over to the
University library when proper fa
cilities are provided for preserving
them. She added that "The Tem
pest," now running at the Little
Theater, "is one of the best Shake
speare plays the campus has seen."
