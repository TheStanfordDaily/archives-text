### DWIGHT MITCHELL 
presumably hard-boiled busi-<
ness men got into the Educa
tion Club luncheon by mistake last
Thursday and liked it so well they
remained through the meeting and
declared they wanted to come back
for more. It all happened because
there was a business men's con- !
vention going on on the campus at
the same time as the luncheon.

Stanford Daily ain't done right
by Colorado, protests somebody
from near Pike's Peak. A recent
story of summer school enrollment
failed to mention Colorado and
this writcr-of-letters-to-the-editor
(anonymous) says he can count
seven students from there. But
my dear sir, we didn't name the
western states that have fewer
than 13 students here. Maybe you
can find more in the Bawlout. So
even though we think we're right
we offer you this amende hon
orable for your hurt feelings.
Come again. And bring 100 citi
zens of your great state for sum

► mer school next year. They'll
like it.

Everywhere one turns on the
Stanford campus, he runs bang into
an author. This time it is Professor
Holland D. Roberts of the School of
Education, who is busy reading
proof on the second volume of his
English series—in collaboration with
Helen Rand—entitled "Let's Read," j
primarily for junior high school |
pupils. First volume was published
two years ago, second will be out j
this fall and another is forthcom
ing.

Dr. John C. Almack, professor of
education, and Mrs. Almack will
leave for Missouri at the close of!
the summer session to vacation in
the Ozarks.
Lake Tahoe is beckoning to Dr. !
and Mrs. Paul Leonard, who are
planning to spend vacation there
after the close of the summer ses- J
sion.

Remember four years ago when
men of the School of Education ,
first started the summer school |
softball league? (Yes, Alfonso,
some of us were here then and
still haven't got our Ph.D.'s.) And
now there are 150 teacher-hall
players out there Tuesdays and
Thursdays. Some of the boys
think it would be swell to have a
cheering section and think that
would be a good activity for the
women education students. But
gentlemen, why shouldn't the
women have softball teams of their
own? They would benefit as
much as the men do from organ- j
ized physical recreation. Wouldn't
they?

The members of the Education De- j
