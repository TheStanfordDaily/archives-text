# Stanford Recalls Varsity Crew Days
## 
### 
Way back in 1916, the Stanford
varsity rowing crew was an out
standing group of stalwarts noted
throughout the country for their fine
rowing ability. They completely
swamped the California crew by a
four-length victory.
Interest at the farm for this sport
has fallen off since then. However,
Stanford athletes are capable of re
peating the performance if they
care to develop this into a major
sport once again.
Harriet Quimby was the first
woman in the United States to hold
an airplane pilot's license.
