# Quist Downs Low In Brookline Sets
## 
### 
Bob Low, Card sophomore tennis
star, was beaten by Davis Cup ace
Adrian Quist of Australia Friday at
Brookline, Mass., 6-0, 6-3, 6-3 in
the Longwood Bowl Tourney. Qust
went on to win the championship by
beating Gene Mako, United States
Davis Cup man and doubles partner
of Don Budge.
Low couldn't get started against
the driving play of the Australian
star during the first set, and won his
first service in the third game of
the second set. Quist, intent on
gaining back titles in America,
turned on the steam all the way,
and though the Indian ace drove him
back from the net for a short time
in the second set with perfect corner
placement shots, his experience
overcame the Indian netter's play.
The Cardinal star had previously
gained the quarter-finals by beating
Gil Hunt and National Junior
Champion Dave Freeman.
