# Business Heads Begin Sessions
## Executives Launch Five-day Conference 
### 
Opening its nineteenth annual
session, the Western Conference for
Commercial and Trade Executives
swung into action yesterday morning
with two general sessions at Lagu
nita Court.
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carver, Har
vard professor of political economy,
opened the first meeting by discuss
ing "Harnessing Human Motives" in
which he pointed out that the engi
neer must harness potentially evil
physical forces and turn them to
good ends. The economist must
harness such evil human motives as
greed, selfishness, ego, and gambling
and direct them into channels that
will benefit all mankind.
The practice of "chiseling" was
scored by David E. Faville, Stanford
profesosr of marketing, in the sec
ond joint session, when he called at
tention to the "Diversion of Trade
from Established Retail Channels.
"If it had not been for the pro
longed depression, we would not
have heard so much of the 'con
sumer co-operative.' The high effi
ciency of American business, how
ever, will not allow these co-opera
tives to thrive to the extent of
those in Sweden," asserted the
speaker.
