# White Lama To Lecture Here Tonight
## Dr. Bernard to Tell Adventures in Tibet 
### 
Only white man ever to be made
a Buddhist lama and to live in the
sacred lamaseries of Tibet, Dr.
Theos Bernard will present an il
lustrated travel lecture on "The
Penthouse of the Gods" tonight at
8 o'clock in Memorial Hall audi
torium as a program of the Tues
day Evening Series.
Traveling half-way around the
world, from a prosaic law practice
in Tucson, Ariz., to Lhasa, the holy
city of Tibet, the speaker lived and
studied with Buddhist monks, par
ticipating in age-old religious rites
never before even witnessed by a
white man.
FILMS SACRED RITES
Ancient Buddhist rituals never
before recorded in permanent form
were filmed by Dr. Bernard, who
returned to the United States with
over 10,000 photographs and 20,000
feet of color motion pictures. The
lecturer will supplement his talk
with a color film showing scenes
within sacred Buddhist temples.
Permitted to traverse sections of
the Orient never before visited by a
white man, the speaker journeyed
to Tibet, not as an explorer, pho
tographer, or collector of Asiatic cu
rios, but as a student of Buddhism
and Tantric ritual.
TRAVELS TO INDIA
After receiving his master's de
gree in philosophy at Columbia
University with a thesis on "An
Introduction to Tantric Principles,"
Dr. Bernard, in order to prepare
himself for his Ph.D. degree, spent
a year in India to increase his
knowledge of Buddhism.
A member of the American An
thropological Society, the Royal
Asiatic Society of Great Britain, and
the American Ethnological Society,
the speaker is the author of nu
merous periodicals, articles and
monographs which have been print
ed in American and English jour
nals. "The Penthouse of the Gods,"
his book dealing with his experi
ences in Tibetan lamaseries, was
printed early this year.
