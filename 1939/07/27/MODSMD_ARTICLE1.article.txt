# Chamber of Commerce Head Speaks at Trade Conference
## Supreme Court Decisions to Limit Industrial Recovery, Says Mussatti 
### 
Recent Supreme Court decisions will have far-reaching effects on lim
iting industrial and agricultural recovery, according to James Mussatti,
general manager of the California State Chamber of Commerce, at a
speech before a joint session of the Western Conference for Commercial
and Trade Executives at Lagunita Court, yesterday.

Mr. Mussatti pointed out that the#
decision of the Currin vs. Wallace i
tobacco case of 1935 in which to- :
bacco from the time it is in the
warehouse until an offer is made for
it is an article subject to interstate
commerce regulation was a definite
step in the complete control of all
agricultural products from the prep
aration of the soil to consumption.
DECISIONS AFFECT INDUSTRY
Two other decisions that have had
a similar effect on business are the
Transmission Power vs. T.V.A. case,
"excluding from court those seeking
constitutional protection of their
property against T.V.A. operating
under invalid government authority"
and the milk case of 1937 in which
the government was permitted to set
up districts and regulate milk prices
in these areas adjoining those of
competitive prices.
"To create and preserve democ
racy," declared Mussatti, "we must
simplify and decentralize govern
ment to the point where the average
citizen can keep track of its doings.
GOVERNMENT IN BUSINESS
"The development of administra
tive absolutism in the United States
marks a departure from the ideas
which have governed our American
institutions. Ours has been an effort
to secure a balance between indi
vidual life and general security in
which neither was to be sacrificed.
"We have had too many instances
of administrative determination ar
rived at on the basis of seeking con
ference with one side and resent
ment at being compelled to hear the
other side. This philosophy believes
in a system in which the adminis
trative bureau undertakes at the
same time to be investigator, prose
cutor, and judge."
As a solution to this problem, Mus
satti advocates an amendment to the
interstate act which would define
commerce as "the sale, purchase, ex
change, or transportation of any ar
ticle or service and shall not include
manufacture or production of such
articles or services.
"We cannot continue to operate
under a system of half capitalism
and half socialism. Industry will die
of stagnation if it cannot grow."
