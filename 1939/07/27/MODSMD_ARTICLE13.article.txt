EXPERIENCED READERS
"It is a play in which, without
any assistance or stage trickery—
the sound of marching feet or any
thing else, there is the extraordinary
recreation of the agony which is
now being enacted in Europe. The
action is more sharply unified than
anything you have in the 18th cen
tury when unity was a fetish. All
these things give enormous point
and drive to the author's emotional
expression," said Dr. Bailey, refer
ring to "Distant Harvest."
The cast includes the most expe
rienced readers of the vicinity, ac
cording ot Dr. Bailey. Myna Brun
ton Hughes will play Esther, and
James Clancy will play Karl, her
husband. The part of Heinrich, the
virtuoso of the violin who plays on
the street to keep himself alive will
be played by Russell Brinley, the
assistant director of the Palo Alto
Community Theater. Melba Rae
Toombs and Clifford Hamar will
portray Mavie and Johan.
Two rooms of the Art Gallery will
be devoted to the exhibits which
will be displayed. Prints, models,
and programs from private collec
tions, including material on the Chi
nese stage from Mr. Shau Wing
Chan of Stanford University will be
shown.
Other exhibits in the Art Gallery
will include three puppets designed
for old fashioned minstrel shows,
loaned by Perry Dilly, who will
bring his puppet theater performance
of "Under the Gaslight," by Au
gustin Daly (1867) to the Little
Theater on Wednesday.
Other puppets in the exhibit will
include some from the Chinese
hand-puppet theater, and puppets of
the classic, or traditional, theater.
The puppets, hand-made and beau
tifully tailored, show with rare hu
mor and delicacy the characteristics

of the roles and make-up.
The other room will display a col
lection from the Albatross Book
and Record shop of personal letters,
signed photographs, and programs of
Ellen Terry and Modjeska. A col
lection of mementos from a tour
with Joseph Jefferson, including

tion, which were obtained through
Mr. George Wilson, will also be on

In the Library, a selection of pro
grams, photographs, and original di

collection of Mr. George Poultney
of San Francisco will be shown.
A complete brochure of the Poult
ney collection with annotations con
cerning each play will be on sale in
