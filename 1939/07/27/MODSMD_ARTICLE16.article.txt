# Hilgard Speaks On Psych Aids
## Experts Are Ready To Help Individuals 
### 
"There are psychological aspects
within matters of gravest human
concern." This was the theme of the
discussion by Dr. E. R. Hilgard, pro
fessor of psychology and education,
on the Stanford Radio Hour over
KGO last night.
Dr. Hilgard pointed out that psy
chology can serve the individual
person. He showed that modern psy
chologists are prepared to aid per
sons of all ages in the numerous
situations which they must meet at
the expense of emotional stress.
"As a second service, psychology
furnishes aid to education, business,
and government," declared Dr. Hil
gard. "In these fields he serves as
a technician. He uses his profes
sional knowledge to help other
people do the tasks they have set for
themselves."
Dr. Hilgard believes that psy
chologists are now beginning to see
that they have been too long con
tented with being mere technicians.
In this connection he referred to the
rapidly growing Society for the Psy
chological Study of Social Issues
which is collecting research data on
such problems as race prejudice, the
psychology of labor conflict, and
psychological aspects of war and
peace.
