# Art Exhibit Now Features Black Pottery
## 
### 
Maria and Julian Martinez, Pueblo
Indians from southwestern United
States, are now exhibiting their
world famous black pottery in the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gal
lery from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, in
cluding Sunday.
The primitive methods used in
modeling and firing the pottery are
almost unbelievable. The clay is
collected from the soil only after
pompous ceremony and the spread
ing of blue com meal by these two
people as a prayer for their success.
The clay is then pounded and made
ready for use by the skillful hands
of Maria and Julian. A flat bottom
is modeled by using a clay mold.
Fat coils of clay carefully pinched
and molded form the main shape of
the bowl. When this hardens, Maria
scrapes the crude clay bowl with
razor-like shells until the coils have
disappeared and the fat, rather ugly
shape becomes thin and extremely
graceful. Templets, turn-wheels,
and other modern pottery equipment
are not used in this shaping and
building-up process. The delicate
touch of Maria's hands shapes the
clay. They then carefully polish the
pottery with stones and pebbles with
almost endless patience until the
clay has taken on a brilliant red hue.
PAINTER CHEWS BRUSHES
The Yucca brushes used for paint
ing on the designs are chewed with
the teeth until the desired edge or
point is obtained. Julian is now
ready to paint on the designs. His
skillful hands express his tremen
dous creative powers found on all
Maria and Julian pottery.
Rickety tin cans and old worn
out grates are used to hold the pot
tery as they are fired by manure
chips, supplying the necessary heat.
The pottery is placed upside down
on the grates and made ready for
the final firing. However, befoi'e this
is done, Maria and Julian once again
pray and spread blue cornmeal
around the fire. Their work is hon
est, sincere, and religiously done.
TIN RETAINS HEAT
Tin sheets are then placed around
and over the pottery to hold in the
tremendous heat. Bone ashes spread
over the fire makes a thick smoke
that turns the red clay into the rich
black that is characteristic of this
famous pottery.
With two little sticks, the pottery
is expertly extricated from the mass
of jumbled tin, grates, manure
chips, and bone ashes. The finished
product is now ready for sale or
exhibit—the result of many hours of
labor, prayer, and primitive skill.
Maria and Julian are now exhib
iting and giving personal demonstra
tions at the World's Fair in San
Francisco.

pompous ceremony and the spread
ing of blue com meal by these two
people as a prayer for their success.
The clay is then pounded and made
ready for use by the skillful hands
of Maria and Julian. A flat bottom
is modeled by using a clay mold.
Fat coils of clay carefully pinched
and molded form the main shape of
the bowl. When this hardens, Maria
scrapes the crude clay bowl with
razor-like shells until the coils have
disappeared and the fat, rather ugly
shape becomes thin and extremely
graceful. Templets, turn-wheels,
and other modern pottery equipment
are not used in this shaping and
building-up process. The delicate
touch of Maria's hands shapes the
clay. They then carefully polish the
pottery with stones and pebbles with
almost endless patience until the
clay has taken on a brilliant red hue.
PAINTER CHEWS BRUSHES
The Yucca brushes used for paint
ing on the designs are chewed with
the teeth until the desired edge or
point is obtained. Julian is now
ready to paint on the designs. His
skillful hands express his tremen
dous creative powers found on all
Maria and Julian pottery.
Rickety tin cans and old worn
out grates are used to hold the pot
tery as they are fired by manure
chips, supplying the necessary heat.
The pottery is placed upside down
on the grates and made ready for
the final firing. However, befoi'e this
is done, Maria and Julian once again
pray and spread blue cornmeal
around the fire. Their work is hon
est, sincere, and religiously done.
TIN RETAINS HEAT
Tin sheets are then placed around
and over the pottery to hold in the
tremendous heat. Bone ashes spread
over the fire makes a thick smoke
that turns the red clay into the rich
black that is characteristic of this
famous pottery.
With two little sticks, the pottery
is expertly extricated from the mass
of jumbled tin, grates, manure
chips, and bone ashes. The finished
product is now ready for sale or
exhibit—the result of many hours of
labor, prayer, and primitive skill.
Maria and Julian are now exhib
iting and giving personal demonstra
tions at the World's Fair in San
Francisco.

Indians from southwestern United
States, are now exhibiting their
world famous black pottery in the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gal
lery from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, in

The primitive methods used in
modeling and firing the pottery are
almost unbelievable. The clay is
collected from the soil only after
pompous ceremony and the spread

people as a prayer for their success.
