# Stanford's Honor Code System Proves Successful
## 
### 
Although the Stanford Honor Code is a standard applying to all
phases of student life, it applies most practically to the taking of exam
inations. Because of approach of midquartcr exams, and the fact that
many summer quarter students are not familiar with the Honor Code,
The Stanford Daily is co-operating with Men's and Women's Councils,
whose duties include the inculcation of the Honor Code, by presenting
two articles on this subject. (Editor's Note.)

In 1921 Stanford University's Aca
demic Council granted the individ
ual petitions of 1700 students by vot
ing to adopt an Honor System for
the regulation of academic work.
Prior to this action, the Law School
was the only department which con
ducted its class work by putting
students on their honor.
The administration approved Aca
demic Council's action, and accord
ingly delegated full responsibility
for honesty in academic and social
conduct to the student body itself.
It is because nearly two decades of
the Stanford Honor Code have prov
ed its success, that professors with
draw from classrooms as soon as ex
amination papers have been distrib
uted. Acceptance of the code in good
faith by 17 "generations" of students
enable one today to leave the exam
ination room for a smoke off Quad
or to write his blue book out of
doors.
FARM LIFE BUILT ON CODE
To new students, this honor sys
tem is one of the most impressive
aspects of Stanford life. Many have
come from high schools or colleges
with a proctor system which make
examinations merely a contest be
tween cheating and catching, and
where "getting away with it" is con
sidered the smart thing to do.
Stanford students asked for an
honor system and it was given them
by the administration on condition
that they could make it work. It is
a tradition that is cherished as a
matter of course by every Stanford
man and woman. Those who do not
live up to it are subject to social
censure as well as to specific pen
alties. The Honor Code is more
than an academic discipline; it is a
fundamental standard of conduct,
which Dr. David Starr Jordan stated
as follows:
"Students are expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order, moral
ity, personal honor, and the rights of
others, as is demanded of good citi

zens. Failure to do this will be suf
ficient cause for removal from the
University."
SYSTEM HAS WIDE RANGE
A constant reminder of the Honor
Code as it applies to academic work
is the pledge, "No unpermitted aid
given or received," which must be
signed on every examination, term
paper, or other work submitted to
the University. The faculty assists
the student to obey this rule by
supplying alternate seats at exam
inations so these may be taken
without crowding.
Besides cheating on "exes," other
violations of the Honor Code include
the use in papers of unrecognized
quotations, references, or ideas; sub
mitting one composition for two
courses without the professors'
knowledge, and misusing library
privileges. The Code extends, how
ever, to any dishonorable conduct
"unbecoming a Stanford man or
woman."
COUNCILS PRESERVE CODE
Charged with the preservation and
administration of the Stanford Hon
or Code are Men's Council and
Women's Council, bodies democrat
ically elected by the students. They
are disciplinary groups with super
visory control over the Honor Sys
tem, traffic violations, and social
regulations. During the summer
quarter, its members also act as
sponsors for new students.
The members of this quarter's
councils are:
Women's Council: Mary Etta Far
rell (chairman); Betty Dirks; Bonnie
Bump; and Jane Harrington.
Men's Council: Carl Phillips
(chairman); Ken Cuthbertson; and
Stanley Neyhart.
These individuals are prepared to
answer questions of a social or aca
demic nature regarding campus life.
All violations of the Honor Code
should be reported to them.
HONORED TRADITION
The Honor Code is Stanford's
most precious tradition. A privilege
not enjoyed in every educational in

stitution, the Honor Code distin
guishes the Stanford student on
campus and in later life. The Honor
Code is a personal matter. It exists
not just to have blue books an
swered honestly, although that is im
portant, but to give each student the
means of fulfilling the trust of the
administration, and to express his
own honesty and integrity.
The advantage of the Honor Code
is not just a protection of the class
average, but is the expression of
honorable conduct and pride in self
government by each student.
This summer's Councils appeal to
the faculty, old and new, as well as
to all students, to co-operate in pre
serving the Honor Code as an in
tegral part of Stanford University.

York City was organized in 1870.
