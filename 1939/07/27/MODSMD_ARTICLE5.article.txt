# Fay to Battle In Grid Classic
## Back Will See Action In Game August 30 
### 
Pete Fay, Cardinal back of last
season, has been assured a chance
to see action in the College All-Star
vs. New York Giants football game
in Chicago August 30.
Fay had previously been certain
of making the trip east with the
squad when the Chicago Tribune
tendered him an invitation earlier
this year. However, it was not until
final votes were counted Monday
that found Fay among the top men
in the nation, thus assuring him a
chance to play.
Two other Farm footballers of last
year, Tony Calvelli and Bill Paul
man, will also be in the All-Star
line-up.
A poll will soon be under way to
determine the coaches for the
squad. The coach with the greatest
number of votes will automatically
become head coach. His assistants
will be the leading coaches from
each of the sections, the Pacific
Coast, East, Midwest, and South.
