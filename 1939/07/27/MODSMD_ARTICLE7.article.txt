# Fish Control Plan Offered By Dr. Meyers
## Marine Biologists Condemn Politics In Fishing Industry 
### 
Increasing commercial exploita
tion of fish resources is making in
ternational conservation essential,
believes Dr. George S. Meyers,
Stanford biologist, who addressed a
meeting of the sixth annual Pacific
Science Congress in Berkeley Tues
day.
"With an increase in commercial
exploitation, measures of conserva
tion become necessary," asserted the
speaker, "but such measures in
many or most instances must be of
international scope to be really ef
fective.
"For the good of the nations con
cerned, both severally and collec
tively, international conservation of
a biological resource should not be
left to the usual diplomatic chan
nels," declared Dr. Meyers at the
meeting, at which marine biologists
considered methods of wresting con
trol of fishing away from politicians
in favor of an international super
visory body.
When conventional diplomacy is
used, actual details of agreements
are often subject to the purely po
litical acts of diplomats and lawyers
who are "totally unable to compre
hend the biological problems and
dangers involved," the speaker ex
plained.
"International conservation meas
ures, to be of the most possible ad
vantage to each of the nations con
cerned, must be decided upon by
boards of competent fishery biol
ogists of the interested nations with
an eye to permanent good rather
than immediate nationalistic ends,"
asserted Dr. Meyers.
