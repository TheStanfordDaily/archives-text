# Dilley's Puppeteers to Offer Daly's 'Under the Gaslight'
## 1867 Melodrama to Be Presented In Little Theater Tomorrow Night 
### 
Perry Dilley's Puppet Theater will move its inhabitants and their stage
home, bag and baggage, from their San Francisco studio to Stanford for a
Wednesday night performance of "Under the Gaslight," which the Drama
tists' Alliance is sponsoring as an evening event of the Assembly. It will
play in the Little Theater at 8 o'clock with a 50-cent admission price.

"Under the Gaslight" is a five-act'
melodrama which Augustin Daly
wrote in 1867. The little wood and
paper actors will play it "straight."
Among the scenes to be represented
will be the Blue Room at Delmoni
co's, A Lower East Side Street, the
foot of Pier 30, and A Railway Sta
tion at Shrewsbury Bend. Twelve
characters will appear, manipulated
by three puppeteers; Mr. Dilley,
Grace Wickham, and Richard
Casady.
DILLEY IS TOPS
Mr. Dilley is one of the most noted
American puppeteers, according to
Dr. Margery Bailey, head of Dra
matists' Assembly. He has received
much favorable recognition both at
home and abroad. Cyril Beaumont's
"Puppets and the Puppet Stage," a
book on international puppetry, pub
lished last fall, carries twelve photos
of Dilley's work.
The showing of "Under the Gas
light" will follow the afternoon dis
cussion of the problems of the little
theater director, by Mr. Hugh Gillis,
and a discussion of the revival play
ed straight, by Mr. R. A. Brauns of
San Mateo. These seminar groups
will be held in the Women's Club
house and the public will be wel
comed if they care to attend.
PUPPETS ARE RESPONSIVE
The puppets which Mr. Dilley
creates, wirtes for, and directs are
not the string marionettes with
which the public is more familiar
but the "guignol" type, or the hand
puppet, which Mr. Dilley believes to
be the more perfect instrument. This
puppet responds better to manipu
lation and more perfectly suggests
the third dimension, according to Mr.
Dilley. He feels the hand puppet can
be in more immediate contact with
the puppeteer's mind, that it is the
symbol of the player's own feeling
and response to the text of the play
being presented.
Mr. Dilley consented to bring his
puppet theater down from San Fran
cisco because he is much interested
in historic American drama, which
is one of the features of the week's
assembly.

be the more perfect instrument. This
puppet responds better to manipu
lation and more perfectly suggests
the third dimension, according to Mr.
Dilley. He feels the hand puppet can
be in more immediate contact with
the puppeteer's mind, that it is the
symbol of the player's own feeling
and response to the text of the play
being presented.
Mr. Dilley consented to bring his
puppet theater down from San Fran
cisco because he is much interested
in historic American drama, which
is one of the features of the week's
assembly.
Perry Dilley's Puppet Theater will move its inhabitants and their stage
home, bag and baggage, from their San Francisco studio to Stanford for a
Wednesday night performance of "Under the Gaslight," which the Drama
tists' Alliance is sponsoring as an evening event of the Assembly. It will
play in the Little Theater at 8 o'clock with a 50-cent admission price.

"Under the Gaslight" is a five-act'
melodrama which Augustin Daly
wrote in 1867. The little wood and
paper actors will play it "straight."
Among the scenes to be represented
will be the Blue Room at Delmoni
co's, A Lower East Side Street, the
foot of Pier 30, and A Railway Sta
tion at Shrewsbury Bend. Twelve
characters will appear, manipulated
by three puppeteers; Mr. Dilley,
Grace Wickham, and Richard
Casady.
DILLEY IS TOPS
Mr. Dilley is one of the most noted
American puppeteers, according to
Dr. Margery Bailey, head of Dra
matists' Assembly. He has received
much favorable recognition both at
home and abroad. Cyril Beaumont's
"Puppets and the Puppet Stage," a
book on international puppetry, pub
lished last fall, carries twelve photos
of Dilley's work.
The showing of "Under the Gas
light" will follow the afternoon dis
cussion of the problems of the little
theater director, by Mr. Hugh Gillis,
and a discussion of the revival play
ed straight, by Mr. R. A. Brauns of
San Mateo. These seminar groups
will be held in the Women's Club
house and the public will be wel
comed if they care to attend.
PUPPETS ARE RESPONSIVE
The puppets which Mr. Dilley
creates, wirtes for, and directs are
not the string marionettes with
which the public is more familiar
but the "guignol" type, or the hand
puppet, which Mr. Dilley believes to
be the more perfect instrument. This
puppet responds better to manipu
lation and more perfectly suggests
the third dimension, according to Mr.
Dilley. He feels the hand puppet can
