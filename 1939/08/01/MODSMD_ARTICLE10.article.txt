bow to an American audience at
Pittsfield, Mass., in September, 1928,
having come to this country at the
invitation of Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge to participate in her Cham
ber Music Festival. Last September
the group celebrated the tenth an
niversary of its American debut at
the Pittsfield Chamber Music Fes
tival.
The Quarter, composed of Feri
Roth, Jeno Antal, Ferenc Molnar,
and Janos Scholz, presented 16 con
certs at Stanford last summer, and
this year gave a series of six, under
the sponsorship of the Friends of
Music.

the program at tonight's concert will
also include: Quartet in E Minor, by
Mrs. Coolidge, and Quartet in A

mann, according to the Summer
Quarter office, in charge of the pro

The concert will begin promptly at
8 o'clock, and late-comers will have
to wait until the end of the first
movement before being admitted to
the auditorium. Following the pro
gram, the audience will be given an
opportunity to meet members of the
Quartet and Mrs. Coolidge in the
Green Room.
