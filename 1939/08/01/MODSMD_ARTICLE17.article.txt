## Viennese Collection Featured by Gallery 
### 
An unusual collection of theater
designs of the 18th and 19th century
Viennese Schools is now on exhibit
in the Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery. The collection is the prop
erty of Mr. Janos Scholz, 'cellist for
the Roth Quartet, and will remain
on public exhibit until August 5.
The exhibition includes a selection
of original drawings by the great
masters of scenic designs in Italy and
Middle Europe from the end of the
17th century to 1840. These sketches
and drawings come from a collection
which was formed by an Austrian
stage designer, Michael Mayr
(1796-1873) who worked in Vienna
and other cities of the Austrian Em
pire. He also visited Italy around
1850, and while travellings he ac
quired the artistic estate of Lorenzo
Sachetti, Anton de Pain, and Nor
bert Bittner.
OLDER DRAWINGS FOUND
In these collections, Mayr also
found drawings by other masters of
earlier periods. In the magnificent
set of drawings by the members of
the famous Bolognese family of the
Bibiena, there are two drawings by
the great Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena
whose influence on the stage designs
was revolutionary and was followed
by most of the architects of the 18th
century.
The collection remained undis
turbed until recently, when a small
part of it became German State
property and the bulk, some sketch
books, and about 2000 prints and
drawings have been acquired by Mr.
Scholz and brought over to this
country.
NEVER BEFORE SHOWN
The drawings are shown now for
the first time, and have never been
published before. The exhibit is
under the supervision of Mr. Walde
mar Johansen, technical director of
the Division of Speech and Drama.
Also of special interest now on
exhibit in the Art Gallery are min
strels designed for an old-fashioned
minstrel show. This collection is
loaned by Perry Dilly.
These marionettes show the history
and conditions 50 years ago. They
have travelled all around the globe.
