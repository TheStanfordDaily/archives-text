# Critic Praises Curran Revival
## Denny, Loftus Excel In Play on Hereafter 
### 
"OUTWARD BOUND," playing
at the Curran this week.
This story of a group of oddly as
sorted people who find themselves
shipmates on a voyage to an un
known port, and eventually discover
that they are dead and are sailing
toward their judgment is the grand
daddy of "On Borrowed Time" and
"Our Town," plays where death is
treated as something commonplace
and yet as different as the man next
door.
"Outward Bound" is an actor's
paradise. The roles are all meaty.
Some of the cast of the Stage League,
Inc., revival catch the quality of the
play, and give sterling performances.
Others miss, and confidentially....
DENNY SHOWS SINCERITY
Reginald Denny, as Prior, the
wastrel, has a role tailored for him
and he takes advantage of it.
Cecilia Loftus, in the thoroughly
charming role of Mrs. Midget, gives
an amusing and yet poignant per
formance. Colin Campbell, as
Scrubby, the bar-tender, plays his
bit to the hilt.
The Examiner ("Oh, yes, there
are dozens of us") who settles the
passengers' after-life while he
smokes a big, black cigar, was beau
tifully played by Evan Thomas.
There the bouquets end. Dorothy
Jordan and Richard Cromwell, as
the "half-ways," miss their charac
terizations badly. Not allowed to
land, but condemned always to sail
back and forth on the boat because
they committed suicide as the only
way to keep their love free from the
taint of gossip, they could have
made their parts the best in the play.
WITHERSPOON DELIVERS
The movie's Cora Witherspoon as
snobbish Mrs. Cliveden-Banks is a
bore until she faces the Examiner,
and then for about five minutes she
presents herself with an elegant
finale.
"Outward Bound" is truly worth
seeing despite some of the bricks
your reviewer has thrown, and Kate
Drain Lawson's set of a ship's bar is
a marvelous thing, but she slipped a
bit when she designed Cora Wither
spoon's mourning weeds!—Farrell

"Outward Bound" is an actor's
paradise. The roles are all meaty.
Some of the cast of the Stage League,
Inc., revival catch the quality of the
play, and give sterling performances.
Others miss, and confidentially....
DENNY SHOWS SINCERITY
Reginald Denny, as Prior, the
wastrel, has a role tailored for him
and he takes advantage of it.
Cecilia Loftus, in the thoroughly
charming role of Mrs. Midget, gives
an amusing and yet poignant per
formance. Colin Campbell, as
Scrubby, the bar-tender, plays his
bit to the hilt.
The Examiner ("Oh, yes, there
are dozens of us") who settles the
passengers' after-life while he
smokes a big, black cigar, was beau
tifully played by Evan Thomas.
There the bouquets end. Dorothy
Jordan and Richard Cromwell, as
the "half-ways," miss their charac
terizations badly. Not allowed to
land, but condemned always to sail
back and forth on the boat because
they committed suicide as the only
way to keep their love free from the
taint of gossip, they could have
made their parts the best in the play.
WITHERSPOON DELIVERS
The movie's Cora Witherspoon as
snobbish Mrs. Cliveden-Banks is a
bore until she faces the Examiner,
and then for about five minutes she
presents herself with an elegant
finale.
"Outward Bound" is truly worth
seeing despite some of the bricks
your reviewer has thrown, and Kate
Drain Lawson's set of a ship's bar is
a marvelous thing, but she slipped a
bit when she designed Cora Wither
spoon's mourning weeds!—Farrell
