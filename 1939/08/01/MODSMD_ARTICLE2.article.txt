# STANFORD GOLFER BEATEN
## 
### 
Art Doering, Stanford varsity golf
ace, was defeated in the early stages
of the St. Paul open golf tournament
in Minnesota Saturday. Doering
shot 75 and 77, but was unable to
win over the severe veteran com
petition of several great open cham
pions, including such famous pro
fesisonal stars as Dick Metz, Ralph
Guldahl and Gene Sarazen. Only
four amateurs were entered in the
tourney.
