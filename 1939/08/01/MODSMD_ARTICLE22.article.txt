# Farm Coloradans Hold 'Day' Today
## 
### 
With apologies to the San Fran
cisco Exposition and its "days" for
special events, nine students from
Colorado who are attending Stanford
this summer will hold an informal
get-together today to celebrate their
own "Colorado Day" on the campus.
All loyal Coloradans, both past
and present, are invited to attend a
luncheon in the Union dining room
at noon today. John C. Almack,
professor of education, will speak.
