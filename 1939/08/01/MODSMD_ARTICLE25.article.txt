# Stanford's Honor Code System Reflects Democracy
## 
### 
For those new to Stanford who will wonder where the proctors are
when exams arirve, and for those who wonder whether putting students on
their honor, socially as well as academically, is not visionary idealism;
for those who might think the ideal of the Stanford Gentleman and Stan
ford woman is old fashioned, The Daily offers the following interpreta
tion of the Stanford Honor Code, by Stanley Neyhart, Secretary of Men's
Council. This is the second and last of two articles on the Honor Code.
(Editor's Note.)

Three hundred years ago the cur-'
riculum of the American college was
limited to Hebrew, Latin, religion
and philosophy. But the combined
influence of a democratic society,
the ideals of liberal college presi
dents, and the pressure of industrial
and technical change imposed new
obligations upon the colleges. Today
the American university is virtually
a replica of the larger social struc
ture, and John Dewey can truly and
proudly say that "education is life."
But the complexities of this mod
ern university demand systems of
control as strongly as society de
mands its laws and government.
Saliently, the organization and con
trols selected by a university re
flect its objectives and philosophy.
As a government may bfe fascist, so
a university may be autocratic.
Thankfully, Stanford is democratic
ally conceived, and the Honor Code
and system of student government
are extensions and rearmations of
its democratic objectives. What does
this imply?
DEMOCRATIC EDUCATION
As I interpret it, the ideal of dem
ocratic education is to assure the
maximum development of the indi
vidual personality consistent with
the common good. Obviously, the
memorization of class materials and
the mastery of a methodology are
not sufficient to nourish this ideal.
Knowledge is only a component of
personality, of which character is an
equally important ingredient.
So viewed, the Honor Code and
the opportunities for participation
in student activities and govern
ment are means to an end, pos
sessing only instrumental value.
Collectively they represent a rec
ognition that one cannot develop
character unless opportunities for
such development are granted.
If we accept the tenet that every
individual is "self-seeking," the phi
losophy and function of the Honor
Code renders every violation a para
dox—since the breach is more in
jurious to the violator than to the
group. Westermarck finds the origin
of the conscience of an individual in
a fear of punishment or social dis
approval. The morale of Stanford
men and women is so constituted
that a violation cannot but generate
this "dread of society" and destroy
the first requisite for the possession
of happiness—inner harmony.
GRADES VS. KNOWLEDGE
In examinations, non-observance
of the Honor Code conflicts with
self-interest by dissociating appear
ances and realities. Grades are

►measures of one's ability in relation
to his classmates. Fraudulently ac
quired, they permit the violator no
objective measure of his capacities
and needs, and the deceptive appear
ance of worth which the violator
engenders will eventually dissolve
under the tests of merit demanded
by life.
Those unhappy souls who seek
grades rather than knowledge,
gaining thereby an ephemeral ad
miration, are analogous to the
fervent money-grubbers who have
transferred to a criteria of success
the essence of success itself.
The Honor Code is not a static
principle; it is manifested in, and
derives whatever strength it may
have, from the beliefs, attitudes and
desires of the students themselves.
No ethical standards can prevail
except quite transiently and tempo
rarily, without the acquiescence and
support of their makers.
