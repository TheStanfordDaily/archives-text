# Speaker Backs Commissions
## Sharfman Defends Regulatory Bodies 
### 
"Government by commissions is
not arbitrary or irresponsible gov
ernment," believes Dr. Isaiah L.
Sharfman, acting professor of eco
nomics for the summer quarter, who
addressed the Commonwealth Club
in San Francisco Friday morning.
"Regulatory commissions have
come to stay," asserted the speaker,
a noted authority on regulatory
bodies and chairman of the econom
ics department at the University of
Michigan, discussing the subject,
"Government by Commissions."
"Sweeping slogans, popularized
for political purposes, exert great
influence upon the public mind," Dr.
Sharfman declared, "often in direc
tions seriously hostile to the public
welfare.
"They tend to over-simplify com
plex and difficult problems, and
thereby to visit condemnation upon
necessary and sound policies as well
as upon those clearly meriting vig
orous resistance."


DR. I. L. SHARFMAN
