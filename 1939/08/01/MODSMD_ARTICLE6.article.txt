# Leader Urges Measures For Business Aid
## 'Confidence Needed,' Believes Tibbett 
### 
Measures that will restore the
confidence of business and release
frozen capital were urged as an an
swer to unemployment by Carleton
B. Tibbetts, prominent industrialist,
at the closing sessions of the nine
teenth annual Western Conference
for Commercial and Trade Execu
tives Friday morning on the cam
pus.
California's Unemployment Re
serve program—workable and fool
proof as it is—still does not carry
a real solution to the problem of un
employment, believes the speaker,
explaining that 700,000 claims have
been handled by the commission
since the first of this year, and that
a half million of these have proved
valid.
ADVOCATES INQUIRY
"A total of $650,000 to $700,000 a
week is being paid out of reserves,"
Mr. Tibbetts declared. "This is big
business. But with all this — with
total payments approximately $50,-
000,000 a year—no dent has been
made in the status of the State Re
lief Administration relief load. It
would be mighty interesting to in
vestigate this situation and see what
the 'score' is.
"After four years, I don't think
this unemployment reserves pro
gram is the answer to our problem.
The answer is to restore confidence.
Our banks today are bursting with
more money on deposit than they
ever had in 1929, while reports show
that inventions are lying 'on the
shelf' which would require $900,000,-
000 for full development," asserted
the speaker.
OFFICERS ELECTED
As its final action, delegates to the
conference elected Lloyd Meyers of
Glendale chairman of its board of
directors for the coming year. J.
Hugh Jackson, Dean of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, was
elected to the post of academic ad
