# Excavation Date Put Off
## Toyon Dance to Have War Library Theme 
### 
Digging of the foundations for the
new Hoover Library Building will
not commence until "some time next
week," according to Mr. A. A. Mar
tinez, associated with George Wag
ner, contractor. Originally sched
uled to start work this week, steam
shovels will not begin scooping earth
from the site opposite Memorial The
ater until last-minute touches are
put on engineers' plans.
CEREMONY PLANNED
As structural steel is not expected
to arrive until October, this delay of
the ground-breaking will not affect
the building program, and "plenty of
time" remains to dig the founda
tions, says Mr. Martinez. A corner
stone-laying ceremony is planned
for late fall, according to President
Ray Lyman Wilbur.
GROUND-BREAKING THEME
Toyon Hall's all-campus semi
formal, which takes place Friday
evening from 9 to 1 o'clock, has
chosen the ground-breaking as its
theme. Original plans included the
displaying of the first shovel-full of
earth turned. As this will not be
dug until after the dance, the motif
will center about a large architec
tural rendering of the new building.
Decorations will consist of a color
ful assortment of posters from the
Hoover Library and from the collec
tion of Professor Harold Fisher, its
acting director.
