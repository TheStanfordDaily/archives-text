When former President Herbert
Hoover arrived in Colorado yester
day for a fishing trip, he was met by
Governor Ralph L. Carr, the first
Republican chief Colorado has had
in more than a decade. Charles R.
Enos, Colorado Republican national
committeeman, also greeted Mr.
Hoover.
Western slope Republicans were
favored with an "off the record"
talk from the former chief execu
tive. On Saturday evening, Mr.
Hoover will be guest at a dinner at
the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado
Springs.
