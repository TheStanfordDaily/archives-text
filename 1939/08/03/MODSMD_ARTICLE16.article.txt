### DOLORES FREITAS 
HPHAT favorite sport of degree'
candidates—questionnaire send
ing—can produce a lot of fun as well
as data, though it has its share of
vicissitudes.
Aside from accumulating vast
quantities of information which is
thrilling to nobody but himself, the
questionnaire-sender gets incident
als via the mails that make him feel
alternately very wise and very fool
ish indeed. Often he doesn't get
anything.
It amounts to a fascinating corre
spondence course in human nature,
an adventure in geography, a chance
to collect stamps and postmarks, an
invitation to send out another ques
tionnaire.
To the novice, investigation by
questionnairing results in a feel
ing akin to the Christmas spirit.
He opens fat, inviting envelopes
with anticipation; fairly bursts
with gratitude toward the gen
erous souls who volunteered ex
citing material; exhibits general
good feeling for those who gave
what he asked; and mentally sticks
out his tongue at a few who won't
co-operate but intend that he shall
hear about it.
People on the whole are a funda
mentally decent lot, the question
naire-sender learns; also that living
in Kansas City or Peoria or Butte,
Montana, detracts not a whit from
the sense of humor or from intel
lectual capacity. Except sometimes.
He falls into the bad habit of
classifying his questionnaire fillers,
as well as his data. Like this:
* * •
IYTO. I—The Unimaginative But
Dutiful — People who check
something everywhere indicated and
let it go at that. Easy to tabulate,
better than nothing, and infinitely
more preferable than a response
from a —
No. 2 —Chronic Playboy—The col
lege student who fills out the page
with his tongue in his cheek and
makes smarty comments all over.
As a result, you must discount nearly
everything he says. These are the
fellows who are in danger of be
coming No. s's some day. (See be
low). Many of them, however, can
be grouped with—
No. 3 — Sophomoric Socialists —
College lads and lassies who "have
the dope" and spill it. Leaders all,
they are often willing to tell too
much. Your job is to sort out super
ficial observations and some preju
dice from the challenging comments

►they volunteer. Frequently humor
ous and always stimulating, as are
usually—
No. 4—The Nobility—established,
sincere workers in the field. Some
authorities, these people give gen
erously of their time and experi
ence to help you and (maybe) the
profession. What's admirable —
most of them answer promptly. It
is regrettable that these princes
among men must sometimes work
along with the—
No. s—Fathead or Sourpuss —an
anti-social element which doesn't
see reason in anything except its
own activities (it probably wrote a
book once) and therefore refuses to
play. It may take the time and
thought (?) however, to write the
question-nerror an explanatory let
ter which succeeds only in estab
lishing it definitely in this category.
Such a blight on the escutcheon of
scientific research is not to be con
fused wtih the—
* * *
No. 6—Conscientious Objector —
who seldom or never answers
anything remotely resembling a
questionnaire, for private or insti
tutional reasons. The C.O. usually
feels guilty about keeping your
stamped envelope, so he uses it to
write a polite note of regret. No
sale; no hard feelings.
In spite of a few setbacks of that
nature, however, the questionnaire
sender has much to be thankful for.
Whereas formerly he knew little and
had nothing to write about, he gets
reassuring evidence that nobody else
does either. He can then elaborate
on his ignorance in proportion to
the number of questionnaires that
were returned.
So, anyone planning to investi
gate "The Edueability of the Ken
tucky Mountain Pussy," or some
fool thing, will get where he is go
ing faster if he dispatches a bunch
of questions to pussy country edu
cators.
But there really should be a bu
reau of prospects for him to consult.
All institutions ought to issue an
nual directories in which their per
sonnel indicate whether they will
fill or won't fill questionnaires. Reg
istered fillers could then have such
a happy time comparing records that
they might cease to regard ques
tionnaires as a parasitic element in
their lives and, instead, feel grossly
snubbed if they didn't get any.

thrilling to nobody but himself, the
questionnaire-sender gets incident

alternately very wise and very fool
ish indeed. Often he doesn't get
anything.
It amounts to a fascinating corre
spondence course in human nature,
an adventure in geography, a chance
to collect stamps and postmarks, an
invitation to send out another ques

To the novice, investigation by
questionnairing results in a feel

He opens fat, inviting envelopes
with anticipation; fairly bursts
with gratitude toward the gen

citing material; exhibits general
good feeling for those who gave
what he asked; and mentally sticks
out his tongue at a few who won't
co-operate but intend that he shall
hear about it.
People on the whole are a funda
mentally decent lot, the question
naire-sender learns; also that living
in Kansas City or Peoria or Butte,
Montana, detracts not a whit from
the sense of humor or from intel

He falls into the bad habit of
classifying his questionnaire fillers,
as well as his data. Like this:

Dutiful — People who check

better than nothing, and infinitely
more preferable than a response

with his tongue in his cheek and
makes smarty comments all over.
As a result, you must discount nearly
everything he says. These are the
fellows who are in danger of be

be grouped with—
No. 3 — Sophomoric Socialists —
College lads and lassies who "have
the dope" and spill it. Leaders all,
they are often willing to tell too

sincere workers in the field. Some
authorities, these people give gen

profession. What's admirable —
most of them answer promptly. It
is regrettable that these princes

along with the—
No. s—Fathead or Sourpuss —an
anti-social element which doesn't
see reason in anything except its
own activities (it probably wrote a
book once) and therefore refuses to
play. It may take the time and

No. 6—Conscientious Objector —
who seldom or never answers
anything remotely resembling a
questionnaire, for private or insti
tutional reasons. The C.O. usually
feels guilty about keeping your
stamped envelope, so he uses it to
write a polite note of regret. No
sale; no hard feelings.
In spite of a few setbacks of that
nature, however, the questionnaire
sender has much to be thankful for.
Whereas formerly he knew little and
had nothing to write about, he gets
reassuring evidence that nobody else
does either. He can then elaborate
on his ignorance in proportion to
the number of questionnaires that
were returned.
So, anyone planning to investi
gate "The Edueability of the Ken

fool thing, will get where he is go

of questions to pussy country edu
cators.
But there really should be a bu
reau of prospects for him to consult.
All institutions ought to issue an
nual directories in which their per
sonnel indicate whether they will
fill or won't fill questionnaires. Reg
istered fillers could then have such
a happy time comparing records that
they might cease to regard ques

their lives and, instead, feel grossly
snubbed if they didn't get any.
HPHAT favorite sport of degree'
candidates—questionnaire send
