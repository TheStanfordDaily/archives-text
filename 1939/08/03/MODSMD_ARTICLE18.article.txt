## 
### 
Source material on negro racial
achievements in the fields of inven
tion, publications, business and edu
cation is being featured in a loan
exhibit of Miss Glenn of Palo Alto,
in the Education Library during the
summer quarter.
Among the examples of popular
negro newspapers on display is a
golden anniversary edition of "The
New York Age." When slavery was
abolished there were four negro
newspapers published; today there
are 230.
Many contributions of major im
portance have been made by negro
inventors to the industrial develop
ment of our country. The American
sugar industry was developed in
Louisiana from the invention of the
vacuum sugar pan by a negro.
Through this device sugar refining
has evolved from the primitive kettle
to great electric vacuum pans of
today.
The United Shoe Machinery Co.
of Massachusetts, largest of its kind
in the world, was founded upon the
original Jan Ernst Matzelger patent,
and the purchase of the stock-com
pany he founded just before his
death at the age of 37. Since then
the machine for automatically per
forming all operations in attaching
soles to shoes has been much im
proved. But credit must go to
Matzelger for this great evolution in
human comfort at the low cost we
have today.
The exhibit includes pictures of
Booker T. Washington, author of
"Up from Slavery"; Marion Ander
son, contralto; Paul Robeson, bari
tone; Eunice Carter, lawyer assist
