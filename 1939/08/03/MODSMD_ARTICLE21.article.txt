### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
Dr. Margery Bailey, Miss Myna.
Brunton Hughes of Dramatists' Al
liance (you know, Dramatists' Al
liance), and Mrs. Marion McDonald
of San Mateo created a bit of sensa
tion last night at the Dilly Puppet's
showing of Augustin Daly's "Un
der the Gaslight." They attended in
costumes which fitted in with the
period of the mellerdrammer.
Miss Hughes wore a gown of her
great-great aunt's and Mrs. McDon
ald wore a costume that Dr. Bailey
wore in her first role in a high
school play. Dr. Bailey wore a cos
tume from the same play under a
dolman purchased by her grand
mother from Lord and Taylor in
the 1870's.
Dr. Bailey grinned yesterday
morning, "It's going to be lots of
fun, and in keeping with the idea
of the revival."

All credit should go to The March
of Time for its marvelous treatise
on the history of the growth of the
motion picture as a new art form.
This is one of the better issues of
RKO's genie of the lamp.
Word from the island of Judy
Spalding, a Ram's Header, who is
playing the role of the maid in
"Three Cornered Moon" in a Hilo,
Hawaii, production. Judy is also
doing props for the show and is
combing the island for a pair of
plush drapes; seems that in the land
of luaus they don't use such things.
The Martinez-Sierra play, "The
Two Shepherds," will not show on

>the 14th as originally announced, but
will play on the 16th, 17th, 18th and
19th of August. August 23 and 24
will see a production of the Max
well Anderson prize play, "Night
Before the Border." Mr. Stevens will
announce the casting of the two
some time this week.

Helen Green will be exhibiting
sketches of the costumes used in
"The Tempest" in the foyer of the
Little Theater this week. In order
that the costumes in the "Tempest"
should be of harmonizing colors,
Helen dyed all the materials for each
costume at one time; result, some
pretty "snazzy" creations. By the
way, Helen called the color of
Miranda's gown "sympathetic"
green, nice?

Dr. Margery Bailey, Dramatists'
Alliance proctor, would like to have
it announced, and this is as good a
place as many, that anyone desiring
to attend the Author's Dinner on
Friday must make reservations.
Friday night's performance of
"The Tempest" (how I harp on that
production, but it deserves as much
space as it gets) hung out the S.R.O.
sign, however, it was entirely by ac
cident. It seems that someone count
ed about 20 more seats than the 198
that the Little Theater holds, and
then the box-office sold them. To
show how good the play was —no
one complained.
