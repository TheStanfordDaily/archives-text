# 'Tiny' Regains Lead in Poll For Coach in Pro Grid Game
## 
### 
Persia, now known as Iran, has
2500 years of continuous recorded
history.

Numerous petitions circulating in
Palo Alto barber shops and on the
campus put "Tiny" Thornhill, Stan
ford grid coach, again in the often
shifting lead in a poll being con
ducted to pick a coaching staff for
the College Ail-Star football team
which plays the New York Giants
in Chicago on August 30.
When the Pacific Coast race ap
peared between Madigan of St.
Mary's and Stanford's Thornhill, an
avalanche of votes late Monday and
early Tuesday sent Shaw into the
lead. More votes for Thornhill and
Madigan late Tuesday put them
back in first and second positions,
respectively. Thornhill has 236,024
votes, Madigan 233,847, and Shaw
211,649.
Elmer Layden, Notre Dame men
tor, leads in the poll for head coach,
with 1,343,331 votes. He appears to
be definitely "in,** as his closest
competitor is Lyn Waldorf of
Northwestern with 674,624.
If Thornhill does represent the
Coast on the five-man coaching
staff, it may mean a better chance
for the three Indians on the over
size college squad.

A new heavy-springed automobile
accelerator pedal which resists
movements at higher speeds is now
being installed on cars to prevent
the thoughtless driver from exceed
ing speed limits.
