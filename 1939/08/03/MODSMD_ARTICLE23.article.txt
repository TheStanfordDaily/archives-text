### DWIGHT MITCHELL 
pAREWELL to softball. Wheel'
chair league plays last round of
games this afternoon. Only remain
ing problem is the play-off to deter
mine who will take second place,
next to the Yankees of the league,

cation: Accordions will remain un
defeated.
Today's games: Accordions will
take Outlaws; Cardinals meet Le
gion; New Dealers and Samaritans;
Horse Thieves and Pushovers; So
cialists and Fish Grabbers; Prune

Photography invaded the soft
ball diamonds last week and re

board at the foot of the stairs in
the Education Building.
Nomination for softball distinc
tion: Miss Lucile Casey, New Deal
stalwart; she can hit, she can field
better than the average man out
there, and she can throw a whole
lot better than the average. Men,
maybe our physical supremacy is
threatened, but those are the facts,
whether we like it or not.
