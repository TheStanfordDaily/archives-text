# Prize Drama Shows Pathos Of Refugees
## 
### 
Passion, misery, and love are dif
ficult emotions to present dramatic
ally without distortion. Because the
play "Distant Harvest" genuinely
reveals the misery of modern Jewish
refugees and their deep capacities
to love and hate, its author, Arthur
McCullough Sampley of Denton,
Texas, won the Maxwell Anderson
Award for 1939.
Read before a Stanford Little The
ater audience last Monday evening,
"Distant Harvest" conveyed a true

and terrible picture of the funda
mental tragedy of present-day in
tolerance as it affects individuals.
The performance of the reading
was spotty and unpolished. Dorothy
Tully as the pathetic sweetheart
Marie rode a wave of emotion with
neither crest nor trough. Esther, her
older friend, wife of the German
Karl, gave live reactions only in dia
logue with Karl himself.
Marie's lover, Johann (Clifford
Hamar), was too flaccid in spots.
Heinrich (Don Brown), the violin
ist, tortured by persecution, found
and delivered with a fitting voice
the horror of his crazed morbidity.
B. Russell Brinley as Wilhelm, the
Nazi spy, was authentically curt and
thick of accent.
Possibly because his lines were
most impassioned, James Clancy as
Karl, the German husband, seemed
to ignite all those about him. Cer
tainly he saw most meaning in the
play.
In a world where slogans are re
placing human values, and dema
gogues suppress humans, the play
"Distant Harvest" is an encouraging
sign. If an English professor in
Denton, Texas, can capture and pro
ject this tragedy, there may yet be
hope.â€”Leff
