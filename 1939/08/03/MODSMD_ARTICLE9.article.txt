"The sense of real danger in Eu
rope today may bring about a
friendship between England and
America based on a feeling of mu
tual respect." Thus is the opinion of
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood Stanford
chaplain, as expressed in his talk
"Common Problems of England and
America" on the Stanford University
Hour last night.
"At the present time," stated Dr.
Trueblood, "there are three import
ant features of national life which
are the same in both of our coun
tries. These are that both countries
allow a high degree of personal
freedom, that both countries are es
sentially anti-militaristic, and that
both countries transcend a narrow
racialism."
Dr. Trueblood also alleged that
there has been a misunderstanding
of English culture on America's part,
but that England has a greater mis
understanding of American ways of
doing things.
