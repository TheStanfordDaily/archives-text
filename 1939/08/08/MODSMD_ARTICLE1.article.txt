# Crum to Speak On Future U.S. Economic View
## Business Professor To Discuss American Destiny Tonight at 8 
### 
Economic aspects of the destiny of
the United States will be discussed
tonight by Dr. William Leonard
Crum, acting professor of business
economics in the Graduate School of
Business, when he speaks on "A
Rendezvous with Destiny" at a
program of the Tuesday Evening
Series in Memorial Hall auditorium
at 8 o'clock.
An appraisal of those elements in
national destiny which may fairly
be regarded as inevitable or mainly
beyond the influence of policy will
be made by the speaker, who has
served as an administrative, edi
torial, and technical officer for the
Harvard Economic Society since 1923*
Dr. Crum will discuss the many
points of view which prompt the
various methods used to control
economic forces, also speaking of the
principal areas within which control
may be attempted.
Emphasis will be placed by the
speaker upon divergent points of
view which may condition the con
trols undertaken, upon some of the
roughly predictable consequences of
important types of control, and upon
the characteristics of economic or
ganization under particular types of
control.
The speaker, who took an active
part in the recent Stanford Business
Conference on the campus, joined
the Stanford summer faculty in
1934. Dr. Crum received his A.B. de
gree at Williams in 1914, his A.M.
degree from Yale in 1916, and his
Ph.D. the following year. He served
as assistant professor of statistics at
Harvard from 1923 to 1927.
