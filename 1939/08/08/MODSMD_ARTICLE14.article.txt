# Discoverer of 'Peking Man' Denies Aryan Origin Doctrine
## Man Began in Several Centers, Pacific Science Congress Told 
### 
One single center where all of mankind originated never existed.
Man must have developed from different centers distributed over the
world, each branch taking its own course more or less independently of
the others. The result of this trend is manifested by the existence of the
various races today.
This was the conclusion expressed last night by Dr. Franz Weiden
reich, Cenozoic Research Laboratory of Peiping Union Medical College,

'discoverer of the Peking Man.
He was speaking before the Sixth
Pacific Science Congress.
Dr. Weidenreich spoke on "Pithe
canthropus and Sinathropus, the
Most Primitive Hominid Types
Known Hitherto, and Their Rela
tionship to Later Stages of Evolu
tion."
He spoke, in part, as follows:
"The first discovery of an almost
complete brain case of Sinathropus
Pekinensis demonstrated the close
relationship existing between this
hominid type and the Java Man,
Pithecanthropus erectus.
FAMOUS SKULL CAP
"Additional finds of Sinathropus
material confirmed the first impres
sion, but for Pithecantropus, Du
bois' famous skull cap remained the
only one for a long time.
"Thanks to the never slackening
endeavor of Dr. R. von Koenigswald,
however, we possess today three
more brain cases of Pithecanthropus,
one upper jaw and a lower one.
MORE PRIMITIVE
"These remains reveal that Pithe
canthropus represents a real hom
inid with his general characters
closely related to Snianthropus but
more primitive than the latter in
regard to certain features.
"Pithecanthropus and Sinanthro
pus represent a special group among
the fossil hominids, which may be
specified as Prehominids, according
to Boule's classification. Morpho
logical differences, however, justify
alloting the two types to two dif
ferent sub-types of races.
"The new Pithecanthropus mate
rial strengthens also the suggestion
that Homo Solensis (Javanthropus)
has to be regarded as a more ad
vanced Pithecanthropus, corre
sponding to the next phase of evolu
tion represented by Neanderthal
Man in the European line. This re
lationship proves that at least in
Java we are dealing with a special
line of human evolution restricted
to this territory."

"These remains reveal that Pithe
canthropus represents a real hom
inid with his general characters
closely related to Snianthropus but
more primitive than the latter in
regard to certain features.
"Pithecanthropus and Sinanthro
pus represent a special group among
the fossil hominids, which may be
specified as Prehominids, according
to Boule's classification. Morpho
logical differences, however, justify
alloting the two types to two dif
ferent sub-types of races.
"The new Pithecanthropus mate
rial strengthens also the suggestion
that Homo Solensis (Javanthropus)
has to be regarded as a more ad
vanced Pithecanthropus, corre
sponding to the next phase of evolu
tion represented by Neanderthal
Man in the European line. This re
lationship proves that at least in
Java we are dealing with a special
line of human evolution restricted
to this territory."


DR. EDGAR E. ROBINSON
One single center where all of mankind originated never existed.
Man must have developed from different centers distributed over the
world, each branch taking its own course more or less independently of
the others. The result of this trend is manifested by the existence of the
various races today.
This was the conclusion expressed last night by Dr. Franz Weiden
reich, Cenozoic Research Laboratory of Peiping Union Medical College,

'discoverer of the Peking Man.
He was speaking before the Sixth
Pacific Science Congress.
Dr. Weidenreich spoke on "Pithe
canthropus and Sinathropus, the
Most Primitive Hominid Types
Known Hitherto, and Their Rela
tionship to Later Stages of Evolu
tion."
He spoke, in part, as follows:
"The first discovery of an almost
complete brain case of Sinathropus
Pekinensis demonstrated the close
relationship existing between this
hominid type and the Java Man,
Pithecanthropus erectus.
FAMOUS SKULL CAP
"Additional finds of Sinathropus
material confirmed the first impres
sion, but for Pithecantropus, Du
bois' famous skull cap remained the
only one for a long time.
"Thanks to the never slackening
endeavor of Dr. R. von Koenigswald,
however, we possess today three
more brain cases of Pithecanthropus,
one upper jaw and a lower one.
MORE PRIMITIVE
