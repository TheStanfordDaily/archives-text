# STAGE BUSINESS
## 
### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
JUST before Dramatists' Assembly'
week drew to a close Saturday
night, the Alliance held an author's
dinner at the Union. Professor Hu
bert C. Heffner, new head of the
Division of Speech and Drama,
m.c.'d the affair, and told those pres
ent that the drama contests which
the Alliance sponsors are watched
with interest throughout the coun
try, and that it is from this type of
enterprise that Hollywood and New
York are now looking for screen
and stage material.
The vote of the assembly on
the best professional plays of the
year resulted in the victory of
Robert Sherwood's "Abe Lincoln
in Illinois." Jean Clark, joint win
ner of the Anderson Award, and
Muriel Roy Bolton, Etherage
Award winner, were presented
with their awards.
Also, the Alliance presented
Thomas Wood Stevens, director and
mainspring of the Globe Theater
Players, with a book of facsimiles of
maps of the old Globe Theater as an
indication of the esteem and grati
tude which the Alliance feels toward
him. Nice gesture, that.

John Gould Fletcher, eminent
poet and Pulitzer prize winner, ad
dressed the assembly on the poet's
behalf at Saturday's luncheon dis
cussion of verse or prose for the
modern theme.

A LOT of Stanford-trained actors
have been gracing the boards of
the Palo Alto Community Theater
this summer. Look at the list who
will appear in their September
show, "The Royal Family of Broad
way," by George S. Kaufman.
James Bacigalupi will play the dash

>ing Tony Cavendish; Dorothy DeYoe
from the Stanford Bookstore will
play Fanny Cavendish; and Ann
Wayland, recently of the "Tovarich"
cast, will take the role of Kitty
Dean.
Gilman Gist, long-time campus
funnyman—stage and Chaparral —
will recreate the role of Perry Stu
art. Remember your Gistmas Cards?
He's their originator and inventor.

Saturday's showing of color
movies of "Twelfth Night," "An
tony and Cleopatra," and "The
Tempest" showed that people other
than the actors achieved immortal
ity in celluloid. The prop girl, the
costume people, and other back
stage figures, including Mr. Stev
ens and Dr. Bailey, lent a human
touch to the record.

Glimpsed over at the Theater:
Jack Dawson, long-time leading
man for many campus productions.
"Daws" was graduated this spring,
and has been vacationing in New
York. He will create a new role
very shortly when he begins the life
of a business man in Oakland.
This has nothing to do with
Stage Business, except that I
think it's funny. Seems a girl
built a model house out of sugar
cubes in one of the architecture
courses. It was a very fancy
thing at the time, but it's deterio
rated since then and so has the
Graphic Arts department. Reason:
the ants are now making hearty
inroads both into the house and
into any art student who is so
unwise as to sit with less than the
room's breadth between himself
and the masterpiece. That's what
I call "suffering for one's art."
