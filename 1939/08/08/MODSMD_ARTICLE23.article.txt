# 'Dressing For Dinner' Used As Background For Comedy
## 
### 
"Dressing for dinner," one of the<
better known American indoor
sports, was the background for the
action in Muriel Roy Bolton's prize
comedy "Molehills" which was read
in the Little Theater Saturday night.
Humor in the play lies not in
smart cracks, sprinkled into the lines
like raisins in a bun, but in the
spontaneous humor of the dialogue.
It all happens because Marian
Drake gets orchids from a new ad
mirer, only the usual sweetpeas
from her husband.
The contrast of Marian's charac
ter in three different moods, ca
pable cleverness, furious exaspera
tion, and happy married love, en
tertain a theme that is without mo
notony. Plausible under the emo
tional strain of dressing for dinner,
these changing moods really intro
duce three characters in the one
woman and show amusingly how
each would deal with attending cir
cumstances.
The continuous laughter of the
audience at the Drake family dress
ing for dinner proved Miss Bolton's
success in handling this human
comedy of a mother and her fam
ily-
"Molehills" was read by members

of the Peninsula Little Theater group
of San Mateo under the direction of
Robert Brauns. Reading the part of
Marian Drake was Alberta Barthel
mess, with that of Jessie, the daugh
ter, taken by Janet Dole. Other
members of the cast were Sidney
Lewis, Vincent Vandre, Jr., and
Doris Danner.â€”Connell
