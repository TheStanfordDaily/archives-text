LASS ROOM teachers in Amer-'
ica's public schools must organ
ize to protect the rights of children
to free and adequate educational op
portunities, believes George T.
Guernsey, editor of "The American
Teacher," organ of the American
Federation of Teachers, who has
been on the Stanford campus for the
past two weeks.
"There is a definite, organized
drive against education in the
United States," he said in an in
terview, "and the professional
standing of teachers is jeopardized
by this drive. We have two aims,
a more democratic administration
of public schools and affiliation
with other organized groups that
stand for democracy in American
society.
"Affiliation with labor organiza
tions is not incongruous with such
a professional group as teachers, be
cause all such groups have a com
mon interest in fostering democratic
ideals."
Youthful and dynamic, Mr. Guern
sey spoke glowingly of the Federa
tion's growth; its membership has
doubled in the past two years, he
pointed out.
"We want to get people to think
about education. At present only
certain groups, and among them
powerful influences opposed to
present liberal tendencies, are ar
ticulate. Therein lies a real danger
to the public schools today."
Guernsey will leave the campus
this week.

Here's a story that parallels the
one about the boy whose eyes were
bigger than his stomach. Education
club members liked immensely the
idea of a week-end picnic. But when
it came to committing themselves to
go, they just couldn't see the dotted
line and the affair was called off.
Well, there are a few term papers,
exams, books, and so on to work
over this week and next, aren't
there? There's partial comfort in
the fact that at least 113 members
realized it was a good idea.

"Here's a copy of a new book on
Holmes," said the English professor.
"And here's another book for you to
look at, too, so you won't get
Holmes-sick."
"Since Cooper, Melville, and Long
fellow all wrote about the sea," the
professor went on, "We might call
them the sea, sea, sea boys."

LASS ROOM teachers in Amer-'
ica's public schools must organ
ize to protect the rights of children
to free and adequate educational op
portunities, believes George T.
Guernsey, editor of "The American
Teacher," organ of the American
Federation of Teachers, who has
been on the Stanford campus for the
past two weeks.
"There is a definite, organized
drive against education in the
United States," he said in an in
terview, "and the professional
standing of teachers is jeopardized
by this drive. We have two aims,
a more democratic administration
of public schools and affiliation
with other organized groups that
stand for democracy in American
society.
"Affiliation with labor organiza
tions is not incongruous with such
a professional group as teachers, be
cause all such groups have a com
mon interest in fostering democratic
ideals."
Youthful and dynamic, Mr. Guern
sey spoke glowingly of the Federa
tion's growth; its membership has
doubled in the past two years, he
pointed out.
"We want to get people to think
about education. At present only
certain groups, and among them
powerful influences opposed to
present liberal tendencies, are ar
ticulate. Therein lies a real danger
to the public schools today."
Guernsey will leave the campus

Here's a story that parallels the
one about the boy whose eyes were
bigger than his stomach. Education
club members liked immensely the
idea of a week-end picnic. But when
it came to committing themselves to
go, they just couldn't see the dotted
line and the affair was called off.
Well, there are a few term papers,
exams, books, and so on to work
over this week and next, aren't
there? There's partial comfort in
the fact that at least 113 members
realized it was a good idea.

"Here's a copy of a new book on
Holmes," said the English professor.
"And here's another book for you to
look at, too, so you won't get
Holmes-sick."
"Since Cooper, Melville, and Long
fellow all wrote about the sea," the
professor went on, "We might call
them the sea, sea, sea boys."

LASS ROOM teachers in Amer-'
ica's public schools must organ
ize to protect the rights of children
to free and adequate educational op
portunities, believes George T.
Guernsey, editor of "The American
Teacher," organ of the American
Federation of Teachers, who has
been on the Stanford campus for the
past two weeks.
"There is a definite, organized
drive against education in the
United States," he said in an in
terview, "and the professional
standing of teachers is jeopardized
by this drive. We have two aims,
a more democratic administration
of public schools and affiliation
with other organized groups that
stand for democracy in American
society.
"Affiliation with labor organiza
tions is not incongruous with such
a professional group as teachers, be
cause all such groups have a com
mon interest in fostering democratic
ideals."
Youthful and dynamic, Mr. Guern
sey spoke glowingly of the Federa
tion's growth; its membership has
doubled in the past two years, he
pointed out.
"We want to get people to think
about education. At present only
certain groups, and among them
powerful influences opposed to
present liberal tendencies, are ar
ticulate. Therein lies a real danger
to the public schools today."
Guernsey will leave the campus
this week.

Here's a story that parallels the
one about the boy whose eyes were
bigger than his stomach. Education
club members liked immensely the
idea of a week-end picnic. But when
it came to committing themselves to
go, they just couldn't see the dotted
line and the affair was called off.
Well, there are a few term papers,
exams, books, and so on to work
over this week and next, aren't
there? There's partial comfort in
the fact that at least 113 members
realized it was a good idea.
