# Perry Dilley's Puppets Play In 1867 Drama
## 
### 
Mellow reminiscing over "the
days of yesteryear" is a favorite pas
time manifested by singing old songs,
buying antiques, fussing through
granny's photo album, and putting
on theater revivals of old-time
"mellydrammies." For an age en
tertained by movies, radio, and
strip-dancers, marionette shows
still hold fascination.
These two facts made Perry Dil
ley's puppet production of "Under
the Gaslight" a highly amusing
show at the Little Theater Wednes
day evening. Presented by the
Dramatists' Alliance, this revival of
Augustin Daly's 1867 heart-wringer
was performed on a tiny stage by
figurines operated by the trained
fingers and clever voices of Mr.
Dilley, Grace Wickam, and Richard
Casady.
Complete from dashing young
blood to leering villain, "Under the
Gaslight" carried the beautiful and
innocent Laura Courtland through
all the cruel vicissitudes of fate's
bufferings and back to the arms of
her lover, Ray Trafford.
Though the puppets were comical,
the drama of life and love in 1867
was played "straight." Snorkey, the
gallant old war veteran truly tied
to the old railroad track by Spike,
the villain, and rescued just in the
nick of time by valiant Laura.
Besides being good clean fun for

Stanford theater-goers, "Under the
Gaslight" as done by Perry Dilley's
Puppet Theater is a significant
museum-piece from the history of
American drama.
