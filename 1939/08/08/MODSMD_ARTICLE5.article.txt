# Jeffrey Wins London Races
## Indian Ace Defeats Europeans in 100,220 
### 
Clyde Jeffrey, Cardinal sprinter
and captain-elect of the 1940 track
squad, took a double win at London,
England, yesterday when he annexed
100-yard dash honors in 9.8, and
took the 220 in 21.8, six-tenths of
a second off of the British record.
In the century, Jeffrey came from
behind the field in the last 25 yards
to win going away. The United
States touring squad, including
Goerge Varoff of Oregon, Les Steers
of San Mateo Junior College, Bill
Watson of Michigan, and Jeffrey, led
an international field in scoring 54
points. Great Britain scored 41, Ger
many 25, Italy 16, and Sweden 15.
In Glasgow, Scotland, Saturday,
Jeffrey scored a win in a 120-yard
sprint event and Steers leaped 6
feet 4 inches in the high jump.
