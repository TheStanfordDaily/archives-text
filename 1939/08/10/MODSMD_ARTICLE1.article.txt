# Hydroponics Experts Grow 'Crops' in Soil-less Basins
## 'Tank Farmers' Raise Goulash Vegetables in Chemical Nutrients 
### 
Hydroponics experts, or "tank farmers" as they are vulgarly called, now
find that one can grow all the vegetable ingredients of a savory Hungarian
goulash—onions, tomatoes, potatoes, corn—in a hasin of water at one and
the same time. A new development of the sensational 10-year-old science
of hydroponics, the process is significant in still further intensifying the

crop yield from the soil-less farm. '
W. F. Gericke, University of Cali
fornia pioneer in growing plants
without soil, described the process at
a meeting of botanists attending the
Sixth Pacific Science Congress yes
terday in the Education Building.
NEW METHODS EXPLAINED
Farming "a la goulash," as Pro
fessor Gericke described it in words
and pictures, puts the ordinary
methods of agirculture to shame. He
finds it possible to grow, in a basin
of water six feet wide by 36 feet
long, about three or four times as
much produce as could be gotten
from the same area of land under
the most favorable conditions.
Add to that multiple-cropping, or
planting two to four crops in the
same basin of water at the same
time, and Professor Gericke gets al
most astronomical harvests. For in
stance, from one basin in which po
tatoes and corn were simultaneously
raised, the yield was at the rate of
1500 bushels of potatoes and 285
bushels of corn per acre.
'LITTERS' USED
Potatoes sprout forth first, fol
lowed by the corn and tomatoes.
Instead of being planted in earth, the
potato sprouts, corn and tomato
seeds are "planted" in a litter of
excelsior or straw, contained in wire
mesh bottomed boxes. The boxes
are placed across the water basins,
and water level is maintained at just
below the litter.
Chemical nutrients circulate
through the water basin, and ap
parently the same proportions of
nutrients are suitable for many va
rieties of plants. Growth is rapid and
prodigious, yet the cost of chem
icals required for producing 1500
pounds of potatoes is only $1.45,
Professor Gericke said.
