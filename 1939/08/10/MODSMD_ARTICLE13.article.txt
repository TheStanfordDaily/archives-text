# Giant Corals of Pacific Described by Biologist
## Professor Yonge Discusses Reefs Extending 150 Miles from Coast 
### 
Coral reefs 1200 miles long, extending as far as 150 miles from the
coast line, and sheltering huge clams four feet long and weighing more
than a hundred pounds, were described last night by Professor C. M.
Yonge of the University of Bristol, England.
Speaking before a public session of the Sixth Pacific Science Congress,

in the Education Building, on "The
Biology of the Great Barrier Reef,"
Professor Yonge said in part:
"No ocean contains so rich a
growth of coral reef as does the Pa
cific. Fringing reefs bound the land
within the tropics especially along
its western shores and atolls are
scattering far and wide throughout
the South Seas. But the greatest
coral formation of all is the Great
Barrier Reef of Australia."
DISCUSSES CORAL REEFS
This series of reefs extends along
the northeastern shores of Australia
from the tropic of Capricorn in the
south almost to the shores of New
Guinea in the north, for a total dis
tance of more than 1200 miles. It is
made up of thousands of individual
reefs which extend in places as far
as 150 miles from the coast, accord
ing to the speaker.
"The biology of the corals which
form these reefs was examined by
the Great Barrier Reef Expedition,
which worked for more than a year
in 1928-29 on a small coral island
midway between the outer reef and
the mainland,' explained Professor
Yonge.
CORALS FORM COLONIES
"Corals are essentially sea anem
ones which have acquired the power
of forming massive limey skeletons.
Many are colonial in habit and grow
to a great size, forming colonies
which may be rounded and massive,
branching and tree-like, or flat en
crusting sheets, according to the re
gion where they grow," declared the
speaker.
"Corals of the first type are found
especially on the exposed outer sur
face of reefs, those of the second
type in sheltered water in the lee of
reefs, and of the third type on the
summits of reefs where the surf
sweeps over when the tide is out,"
asserted Professor Yonge.
