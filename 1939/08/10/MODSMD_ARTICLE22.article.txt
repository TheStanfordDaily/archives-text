# Famous Tree Is Basis For Stanford Seal
## 
### 
The Palo Alto tree, the lone red
wood that stands at the edge of
the campus, has stood there and
been noted in the pages of history
since the earliest of recorded annals.
It was doubtless standing there
when Columbus discovered Amer
ica.
It was a landmark to the first
white men and probably to the In
dians before the white men came.
The Mission Fathers rested at its
base on their journeys up and down
the El Camino Real. El Palo Alto,
the Spaniards called it.
Originally there was a twin tree,
but it succumbed many years ago.
Fears were expressed for the health
of the tree still remaining, and the
University stored up its roots with a
concrete buttress against the attacks
of the San Francisquito creek when,
in winter and springtime, floods
rush past the old tree's base.
This famous old tree gave the
name to Senator Stanford's ranch
and country estate, appears on the
University seal and, when the col
lege city was laid out at the edge
of the campus, it was given the
name of the old monarch.
