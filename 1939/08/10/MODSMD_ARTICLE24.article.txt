### LES SQUIRES Editor, Stanford Illustrated Review 
"C'OR the average undergraduate,*
alumni matters probably seem
as remote as a series of penguin pa
rades in the south polar regions.
Perhaps they are! With jolly-ups,
football games, and proms pock
marking the calendar, the second
handed college contacts of the
alumni groups don't seem very im
portant.
And yet, for even the most col
legiate of freshmen, there comes
the day when the cloistered doors of
learning must close. At that point,
the Alumni Association and the
alumni magazine step into the pic
ture. With the four years of actual
college in the past, the Alumni As
sociation attempts to carry some of
the benefits of college life over into
latter years.
It is in the hopes of carrying
out this task that the Stanford
alumni magazine, the Illustrated
Review, enters a new year. With
in the pages of the Review, we
hope to catch each month a com
plete picture of college life on the
Quad, a picture that will not
stress one activity more than an
other, but a picture that will give
a portrait of Stanford-1939 to an
oil-driller graduate in the wilds of
Sumatra.
For, contrary to what the under
graduate may think, there is much
pleasure to be gained in keeping in
contact with Stanford. As a single
graduate, one stands alone. As a
member of the Alumni Association,
each graduate is a unit in an army
of eight thousand Stanford men and
women, anxious and ready to build
a greater University.
♦ * *
is much for that army to
do. For too many years Stan
ford men and women have fallen
back on the comfortable thought
that their college was heavily en
dowed. They have blessed the Stan
fords, and have gone on serene in
the thought that their job was done.
But there is much yet to be ac
complished. Stanford has made great
strides in the last ten years, amaz
ing strides when one considers the
collapse of intellectual accomplish
ments in many quarters of the globe.
The ten years since 1929 have
indeed seen amazing progress.
Lagunita Court and the Women's
Gym have risen on empty fields.
The Memorial Theater has ma
tured from a dream into a reality.
The Education Builduig has cli
maxed the life-interest of a great
teacher. The Frost Memorial Am
phitheater has given a crown of
beauty to an already beautiful
campus. And now the Hoover Li

' brary is soon to lift a tower high
above all.
All this has been the material
progress of just ten years. Yet
much remains to be done. It is the
job of the future that gives to the
Alumni Association its main reason
for being. It is this strength of pur
pose that has carried the Alumni
Association through 47 of the Uni
versity's 49 years.
Perhaps the evening contempla
tion of a magazine article on Stan
ford doesn't have the romantic
push of night on the Quad. But
for thousands of alumni, scat
tered to the four winds of the
globe, the monthly pages of the
Illustrated Review do bring a
breath of college days, a breath
that brings a tingle to Stanford
hearts wherever they may be.
It is that thought that makes the
editing of the Stanford Illustrated
Review a pleasant job. It is the
thought that there are eight thou
sand Stanford men and women
pulling together toward the greater
future that makes it something more
than pleasant, that makes it a chal
lenge and a career.

And yet, for even the most col
legiate of freshmen, there comes
the day when the cloistered doors of
learning must close. At that point,
the Alumni Association and the
alumni magazine step into the pic
ture. With the four years of actual
college in the past, the Alumni As
sociation attempts to carry some of
the benefits of college life over into
latter years.
It is in the hopes of carrying
out this task that the Stanford
alumni magazine, the Illustrated
Review, enters a new year. With
in the pages of the Review, we
hope to catch each month a com
plete picture of college life on the
Quad, a picture that will not
stress one activity more than an
other, but a picture that will give
a portrait of Stanford-1939 to an
oil-driller graduate in the wilds of
Sumatra.
For, contrary to what the under
graduate may think, there is much
pleasure to be gained in keeping in
contact with Stanford. As a single
graduate, one stands alone. As a
member of the Alumni Association,
each graduate is a unit in an army
of eight thousand Stanford men and
women, anxious and ready to build
a greater University.

is much for that army to
do. For too many years Stan
ford men and women have fallen
back on the comfortable thought
that their college was heavily en
dowed. They have blessed the Stan
fords, and have gone on serene in
the thought that their job was done.
But there is much yet to be ac
complished. Stanford has made great
strides in the last ten years, amaz
ing strides when one considers the
collapse of intellectual accomplish
ments in many quarters of the globe.
The ten years since 1929 have
indeed seen amazing progress.
Lagunita Court and the Women's
Gym have risen on empty fields.
The Memorial Theater has ma
tured from a dream into a reality.
The Education Builduig has cli
maxed the life-interest of a great
teacher. The Frost Memorial Am
phitheater has given a crown of
beauty to an already beautiful
campus. And now the Hoover Li

' brary is soon to lift a tower high
above all.
All this has been the material
progress of just ten years. Yet
much remains to be done. It is the
job of the future that gives to the
Alumni Association its main reason
for being. It is this strength of pur
pose that has carried the Alumni
Association through 47 of the Uni
versity's 49 years.
Perhaps the evening contempla
tion of a magazine article on Stan
ford doesn't have the romantic
push of night on the Quad. But
for thousands of alumni, scat
tered to the four winds of the
globe, the monthly pages of the
Illustrated Review do bring a
breath of college days, a breath
that brings a tingle to Stanford
hearts wherever they may be.
It is that thought that makes the
editing of the Stanford Illustrated
Review a pleasant job. It is the
thought that there are eight thou
sand Stanford men and women
pulling together toward the greater
future that makes it something more
