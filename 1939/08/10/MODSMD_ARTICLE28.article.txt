# Mail Deliveries Can Be Speeded
## 
### 
Summer students and faculty can
do much to avoid delays in the de
livery of their mail, the Stanford
post office officials say .
A large number of errors and
omissions that might be easily cor
rected are responsible for lost time
in getting letters to their intended
recipients.
In the first place campus people
should notify the postoffice promptly
of their correct address â€” and not
forget to notify them if they change
that address. Students should also
notify publishers about one month
before leaving the campus of the
new address. This is important be
cause magazines and other publica
tions crop up in the post office and
cause much extra work and wasted
time for the post office employees
and for the addressee. This mate
rial is not forwardable.
Post office officials have also asked
that students turn in their box keys
and receive their deposit before
leaving the campus.
A card index is maintained in the
office in order to speed up the iden
tification of campus residents to
whom mail is sent with incomplete
or incorrect address.
The post office urges local resi
dents to warn their correspondents
that the campus post office is Stan
ford University and that letters for
people who live on the campus
should be addressed in that form

and not to Palo Alto. Especially on
mail trains when the clerks are sort
ing mail rapidly if the name Palo
Alto catches their eyes, even though
Stanford University is also written,
they are likely in their haste to toss
a letter into the Palo Alto rather
than the University sack, which
causes a time-consuming trip to the
wrong post office before the letter is
relayed to the campus.
Post office boxes are available for
those who desire them; and they
should be rented at once, for the
number is limited.
