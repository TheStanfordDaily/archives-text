of paintings which depicts the story
of Shakespeare's immortal play,

in his series of 36 paintings caught
pictorially the true spirit of the
Bard of Avon's famous tragedy. Mr.
Yacoubian, an Armenian inhabitant
of San Francisco's art colony, worked

years on the study of the play itself
and its many stage interpretations.
The paintings are on exhibit in In
