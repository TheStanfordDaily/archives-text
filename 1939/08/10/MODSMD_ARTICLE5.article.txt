### 
"Twin arts of the theater and
drama have persisted through wars,
suppressions, over-indulgence, star
vation, and those unpredictable,
flighty changes of taste which mean
success or failure to the artist," de
clared Dr. Margery Bailey, associate
professor of English literature, in an
address on the University Hour last
night over station KGO and the
NBC Blue Network.
"In every decade it has been said
that the theater is as dead as Baby
lonian kings, and yet in every decade
there is in it new vitality and the
production of new growths," declared
the speaker, who explained the in
fluences that the motion picture, the
small "community theater," and the
radio have exerted in the field of
drama and the theater.
Outlining the work of Stanford's
Dramatists' Alliance in attempting
to support and encourage dramatic
productivity, Dr. Bailey spoke on
the early work of the Alliance,
formed four years ago by a group
of faculty members and alumni of
the University.
