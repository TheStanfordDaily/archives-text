# Education Softball Final Slated Today
## 
### 
The Accordians and Outlaws will
battle this afternoon on the Sunken
Diamond for the School of Educa
tion softball championship.
The two teams won their way into
the finals yesterday when the Ac
cordions defeated the Cardinals 8
to 0, and the Outlaws beat the Sa
maritans 5 to 4. By virtue of their
phenomenal season of 11 straight
wins before the play-offs, the Ac
cordions are installed as pre-game
favorites to cop the title.
