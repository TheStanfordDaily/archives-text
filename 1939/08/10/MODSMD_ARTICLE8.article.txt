# Stanford Men Await Call In Bridges Case
## 
### 
Subpoenaed by the defense in the
Harry Bridges deportation hearing,
two Stanford professors are waiting
to define "Communism" at Angel
Island some time next week.
Dr. Walter Thompson, professor
of political science, who teaches
courses in political panaceas, polit
ical theory, and principles of politics,
expressed uncertainty as to when
he would be called to testify. Asked
for his opinion on the testimony he
has been subpoenaed to give, Pro
fessor Thompson stated:
"Being under subpoena at the
request of the defense, I am tech
nically a witness for the defend
ant. However, I hold no brief
cither for or against Mr. Bridges,
whom I have never met, who I do
not recall ever having seen, and
about whom I know very little.
"My testimony will consist of an
exposition of the leading adher
ents of the Marxian school of po
litical philosophy. I intend to make
that testimony objective and de
tached."
Dr. Harold Chapman Brown, head
of Stanford's philosophy department,
teaches ethics, modern philosophy,
and a seminar in liberalism. Re
gional vice-president of the Ameri
can Federation of Teachers, he is
also prominent in the American
Civil Liberties Union, and on the
board of the Consumers' Union.
Regarding the testimony he is ex
pected to give, Professor Brown yes
terday declared:
"This statement which I am to
make under subpoena concerns the
content and significance of Marx
ist philosophy. It is not to be taken
as a statement of my own views
on any of the points in question.
I have endeavored to treat the
subject as objectively as I should
the philosophies of Plato, St.
Thomas Aquinas, or Emmanuel
Kant, if there were need of an
exposition of their views. It dif
fers from a classroom presentation
only in that it is limited to ex
position and does not include
critical evaluation."
