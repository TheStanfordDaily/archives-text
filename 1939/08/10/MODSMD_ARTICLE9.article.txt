# Lind to Discuss Racial Experiment
## 
### 
"Hawaii's Racial Experiment"
will be discussed by Dr. Andrew W.
Lind, acting professor of sociology,
next Wednesday evening during the
weekly Stanford Radio Program
over KGO at 7:15 o'clock.
"During the 50 years ending in
1940, four hundred thousand men,
women, and children migrated to
Hawaii from such varied regions as
China, Japan, the Islands of the Pa
cific, Korea, Manchuria, Russia,
Germany, Norway, Italy, Spain, Por
tugal, Puerto Rico, and the United
States," declared Professor Lind in
commenting on his forthcoming talk.
"Roughly one-third of all the
marriages in Hawaii are across the
conventionally delegated racial
lines," he continued, "and the cumu
lative effect of these mixed marriages
is to build in the islands a hybrid
population."
