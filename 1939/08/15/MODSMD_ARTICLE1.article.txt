# S.F. Music Critic to Offer Illustrated Lecture-Recital
## Alfred Frankenstein Will Speak Tonight in Tuesday Series Program 
### 
"Art into Music," an illustrated lecture-recital based on Moussorgsky's
"Pictures from an Exhibition" and originals by Victor Hartmann, will be
presented this evening by Alfred Frankenstein, music critic of the San
Francisco Chronicle, and Edna McEachern, lecturer in music and educa
tion at Stanford, at 8 o'clock in Memorial Hall auditorium, announces

the Summer Quarter office. i
When an exhibition of the works
of Hartmann, architect-painter and
designer, was held in St. Peters
burg in 1874, Moussorgsky attended
the show and composed a suite of
ten pieces for the piano, descriptive
of ten of the 400 pictures in the
exhibition.
SPECULATION ARISES
Little known until 1922, when it
was orchestrated by Ravel, these
compositions have since become
classics and have been widely played.
In recent years, speculation has aris
en regarding the Hartmann pictures
for, since he was a minor artist, only
a small amount of his work has been
preserved, and no exhibition of it
has been presented since 1874.
Following more than four years
of intensive search, Mr. Franken
stein succeeded in locating what he
believes to be every picture by the
artist that still exists, and has re
constructed, for the first time, a
partial skeleton of the exhibition
Moussorsky immortalized in his
music.
SLIDES TO BE SHOWN
Slides of the Hartmann pictures,
as well as others which Moussorg
sky has described in his music, will
be presented by Mr. Frankenstein,
who will comment on both the music
and the pictures.
Miss McEachern will play the en
tire suite of Moussorsgsky in its or
iginal version for the piano.
