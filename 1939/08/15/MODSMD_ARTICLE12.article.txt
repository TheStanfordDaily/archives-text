## 
### 
Dr. Harold Chapman Brown, head
of Stanford's philosophy department,
has been summoned by defense at
torneys to take the stand today in
the Harry Bridges deportation hear
ing at Angel's Island.
Calling of Dr. Brown wis post
poned to enable the defense to fin
ish questioning John L. Leech,
former Los Angeles Communist.
Dr. Brown expects to con plete his
testimony today, but may be re
quired to testify tomorrow if gov
ernment or defense counsels wish
to question him further on the the
ories of Karl Marx and Frederich
Engels, which are the basis for the
Communist party program.
It is believed that the defense
will use the academic testimony of
Dr. Brown and Dr. Thompson, pro
fessor of political science, who will
testify later this week, to refute the
Communist party's asserted plan to
overthrow the government of the
United States by violence.
