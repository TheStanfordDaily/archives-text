# Public Relations Institute Opens Two-week Course
## Dr. Childs, Editor of Public Opinion Quarterly, Gives Theme for Study 
### 
A course in public relations for California business men, sponsored by
the American Institute for Public Relations, opened on the campus yes
terday morning under the direction of Dr. Rex F. Harlow, director of
the institute and assistant professor of education at Stanford.
Defining public relations as "those activities of individuals or organiza-

tions which have a social signifi
cance," Dr. Harwood L. Childs, edi
tor of Public Opinion Quarterly and
associate professor of politics at
Princeton University, gave the
theme for the study of public rela
tions which two-score executives
will make here in the next two
weeks.
BUSINESS TOO REMOTE
Harford Powel, former editor of
Collier's Weekly, pointed out that
the business man was too remote
from the consumer because of dif
ferences in age groupings.
"Because we mistakenly think
that others think the way we do, we
do not understand and see others. It
is a great delusion to think that
everyone is like yourself," declared
Mr. Powel.
Successful public relations de
pend on "more thinking, less talk
ing, and more deeds, whether they
be good, bad, or indifferent," believes
Mr. Powel.
LECTURE SUMMARIZED
Opening lectures were also given
by Dr. Don D. Lescohier, professor
of economics at the University of
Wisconsin, and Edward L. Beniays,
New York counselor on relations
between the public and national cor
porations.
Last night's meetings brought
short summaries of the morning lec
tures, after which general discus
sion was held between the faculty
and the 160 enrolled members.
