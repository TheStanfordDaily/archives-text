# Herron Sets New P.A. Swim Mark
## 
### 
Paul Herron, freshman swimming
star at Stanford last year, won the
P.A. 440-yard free style title Tues
day night in the Elk's Club pool in
San Francisco, defeating Bill Lucas,
Olympic Club ace, and Henry Paris
of Crystal plunge in the finals. Her
son set a new P.A. mark of 4:52.3,
erasing Lucas' 5:01.6.
Herron's new time betters his own
record, made in the Stanford pool
last year, by 1.2 seconds. Although
he will not be at Stanford during
the coming year, it is hoped that he
will return during the school year
1941-42.
