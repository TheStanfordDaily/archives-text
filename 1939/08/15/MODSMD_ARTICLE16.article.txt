TN THE past the mark of distinc-'
tion that always differentiated
the crew and other backstage work
ers from the "puh-formers" was
the white jumper (known as the
"cover-all" in the familiar par
lance). But now it's hard to tell just
who is lurking in the depths of a
white jumper—reason is that the
make-up class has taken to wearing
them for protection.
* * *
Ted Marcuse and Joyce Clumeck
began the movement (guess that
dignifies it) and claim that the
rest of the class plans to join it.
Why the jumpers, when the only
thing to put make-up on is their
faces? .... But, I must admit
that something that looked sus
piciously like Max Factor's No. 3
covered most of one white jumper
I saw.

ORDY WILLIAMS remember his
marvelous old man in "The
Lower Depths"?) is now director of
the Sacramento Community The
ater, which is good stuff. Gordy is
considering "Murder Has Been Ar
ranged" for his first production.

The set for "The Two Shep
herds" is going to rival "The Tem
pest" set. Very bright and color
ful, it is a sleepy courtyard in a
little Spanish village. A massive
church on one side of the cobble
stone courtyard and an adobe
casa with bright flowers climbing
over the porch on the other side
gives a marvelous effect. Mr. Jo
hansen has "really done himself
proud."

Hear Virginia Sharpe isn't feeling
up to assistant-directing the above
mentioned production. Very sor
ry. Now there's an exceedingly
talented person. Act, directs,
and does wonderful sketches, etc.
Her caricature booth was the high
light of spring quarter's "County
Fair," and I still hear people pull
ing some of the Mrs. Featherstone
gags from the Spring Show. All of
which reminds me of the priceless
line some one pulled about her as
she brought Mrs. Featherstone into

•private life one time, "And to think
she teaches school, too!"
