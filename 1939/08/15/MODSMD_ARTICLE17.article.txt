# Hoover's Home Lures Visitors To Campus
## 
### 
"Say, how do we get to the Hoover
home?"
Variations on this question have
become a tradition at Stanford, for
literally thousands of tourists each
year seek the Mecca which is their
former president's residence. The
house itself stands atop San Juan
Hill, where the Hoovers have lived
most of the time since their mar
riage.
At least three different structures
have been their residence since the
time Mr. and Mrs. Hoover were
graduated from Stanford. Shortly
after the World War, they built
their present home.
The Hoover sons went to the
primary and grammar school on the
campus, then to Palo Alto High
School, and later to Stanford. Their
campus home was in those early
years, unoccupied by them for long
intervals when Mr. Hoover's activi
ties as a mining engineer took
him to all parts of the world, but
they regarded the Farm as their
residence.
The present house was designed by
Mrs. Hoover, who laid out floor
plans, especially roof-floor plans, and
secured Professor Arthur Bridgman
Clark, formerly an architect, and
professor in charge of the Univer
sity's art instruction, to design a
house around the plans.
The result was not a big house, but
it has more rooms than most resi
dences of its size because Mrs. Hoo
ver desired a series of rooms on
different levels, open to the sky and
sunshineâ€”and on warm days to the
shade. The flat roofs and terraces,
connected by short flights of steps,
afford outdoor "rooms," with views
of the campus and surrounding
hills and mountains in all direc
tions.
