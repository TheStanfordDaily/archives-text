# Review Publisher To Visit Campus
## 
### 
Originator of one of the newest
and most important ideas in pub
lishing is Miss Virginia Kirkus, who
will be the guest of Mrs. Helen
Stirling on campus Friday, August
18. Mrs. Stirling is head of the
book department of the Stanford
Bookstore.
To provide book sellers with ad
vance unbiased trade reviews is an
idea which occurred to Miss Kirkus
four or five years ago when she was
with Harper's. Publishers scoffed,
said it was a "crazy" idea, that no
woman could handle it. Today Vir
ginia Kirkus heads the Kirkus
Bookshop service, providing the
trade with loose-leaf advice on vir
tually every book before it goes
on sale, and, says Mrs. Stirling, is
"one of the most widely quoted
women in the book world.
While visiting Stanford, Miss Kirk
us will be taken through most of
the libraries on the peninsula, meet
Mr. Van Patten, Stanford Univer
sity librarian, and then go on to
Los Angeles.
At Rollins College in Florida there
are no lectures or examinations. Stu
dents just sit with faculty members
in conference for two hours.
