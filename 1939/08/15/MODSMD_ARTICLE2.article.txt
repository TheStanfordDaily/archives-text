# Finger Captures Golf Championship
## 
### 
Charles "Bud" Finger captured
the San Mateo junior championship
Thursday at the Crystal Springs
golf course, thus adding another title
to those taken by Stanford golfers
this summer.
Finger won the 36-hole final
match without difficulty, defeating
Jimmy Wilbert of El Camino, 7 and
6. He shot a three under par 68 in
the morning round to go four up,
and clinched the afternoon play with
two birdies and a par on the first
three holes of the last nine.
Wednesday Wilbert took advan
tage of a hot putting streak, an im
portant part of the game on the
short Crystal Springs layout, and
upset Warren Berl, defending title
holder, 3 and 2 in a semi-final
match.
Berl and Finger's next tourna
ment play will be against a strong
field in the state amateur cham
pionships at Pebble Beach.
