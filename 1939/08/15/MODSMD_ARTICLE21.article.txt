CUMMER school students don't l
publish a yearbook, so that they
will have pictorial memories to keep
for life, but they can have a good
substitute as far as softball is con
cerned. Dr. Harold C. Hand, "czar"
of the Wheel Chair League, saw to
it that pictures of all teams, posed
and in action, were made, and they
are available at the education office.
Just one more little detail to take
care of in the closing rush of sum
mer school, men! Place your orders
with Miss Irene Craig, secretary.

From New York comes Miss Ruth
Meyer, new secretary in the Lan
guage Arts Investigation office, suc
ceeding Barbara Cochran, who has
gone to Washington, D.C. Miss
Meyer arrived at Stanford last Mon
day, said that although she knows
nobody here, she doesn't expect to
become homesick for the East. She
has "always liked California," espe
cially above the Mason and Dixon
line.

/'"'HILDREN traditionally inspired
to ecstasy when school closes in
the spring may or may not be en
vying the 60 or 70 pupils enrolled
in the Demonstration School this
summer; for these children were
able to have another such cele
bration at the end of last week, with
close of Stanford School of Edu
cation's first demonstration school
session. The Demonstration School
has been in session since early in
the quarter.
Following a meeting Tuesday
night, faculty members connected
with the school gave a party in
honor of Miss Leila Ann Taggart,
co-ordinator of the school.

Maybe it's because they didn't
know what the Bawlout is. But if
you have a copy of it, hang on to it
for dear life until this notice gets
around. Many summer school stu
dents are eager to have copies of
the Summer School Directory of
faculty and students but didn't
know they were obtainable. So now
they can't say they weren't in
formed. Copies are on sale at Comp
troller's office for only 16 cents. (In
cluding a penny tax.)

Approximately 30 members of
the class in Educational Sociol
ogy 263 are planning a dinner at
the Union Thursday noon in hon

► or of their instructor, Dr. Percy E.
Davidson, and Mrs. Davidson.
Committee members include Miss
Greba Theone Logan and Cecil
Hollingsworth.
"Our course has been largely
concerned with leisure," explained
one member of the class, "and this
dinner is to be the climax of that
phase of the activities of the class."

"Just a few more days for to tote
de weary load" and then, all in
spired and educated up to the eye
brows, summer school students will
go to carry the gospel of Twentieth
Century Education out to the world.
Typewriters getting hotter and hot
ter! Gray matter seething to the
boiling point! Term paper assign
ments staring everybody in the
face! Midnight oil! Battle is almost
won, folks. Courage!

Softball players: there was a
syllabus fee of 50 cents, wasn't
there? You know where Czar
Hand's office is, don't you? Now
that you are swamped with prep
arations for final exams, course
papers and all that, aren't you
sorry you didn't pay that 50 cents
last June, so you could forget it?
Some softball players haven't
kicked through yet — this tirade
isn't intended for the others. A
50-cent piece is much like a snipe,
and the Czar is still holding the
sack.
You're quite welcome to this
ever so gentle and subtle hint.

Now that the softball season is
over, Old Man Scopes thinks the
women of the School of Education
are secretly sorry they didn't take
his suggestion of having a league of
their own.
However, there is one player they
can't have, for love or money. Miss
Lucile Casey is to be with the New
Dealers again next year and that's a
warning.
Ladies, softball is excellent for the
figure. It is a fine way to reduce or
put on weight as the case may be; it
stimulates the brain; the rules are
excellent mental exercise, and you
acn develop your argumentative
ability no end, what with the great
American tradition regarding um
pires.
