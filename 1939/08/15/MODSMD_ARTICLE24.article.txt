# Encina Pools Close For Repairs Today
## 
### 
Encina pools will close today
for extensive repairs, according to
an announcement by Stanford Uni
versity officials Saturday.
Work on the pools will include a
complete overhaul of the filtering
system. The 10-year-old filter will
be entirely replaced by workmen
descending a ventilator beside the
75-foot pool and another opening
under the floor of swimming coach
Norton D. Thornton's office.
Pavement around the pools will
be repaired and the pools them
selves will be cleaned and painted.
Work is expected to be completed in
time for the opening of the fall
quarter.
The two 60-foot pools and one 75-
foot are considered to be among the
finest in California. Since their
opening in 1929 a large number of
famous intercollegiate swimmers
and divers have been trained in
them.
