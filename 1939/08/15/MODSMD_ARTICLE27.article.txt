T~|ELILAH'S fingers would itch so'
much people would think she
had delirium "tremblin's" or some
thing if she could see what long
hair some people let down. These
people let down their hair regu
larly—at 3 p.m. each Monday in
the Daily Shack. They are mem
bers of Education 215. Yes, they are
school teachers. Tsk, tsk, what would
the kiddies think if they could see
these sirs and ma'ams at these un
dignified and sometimes indignant
times?
If they could hear what is be
ing said, the boards of trustees
under which the teachers serve
might issue walking papers. The
superintendents might declare:
"They are not co-operating in our
program." Ladies of the P.-T. A.
might not want their offspring
(mutations —?) under such in
structors. The teachers' contracts
might go p-f-f-t.
But this "colyum" declares that
these teachers are doing some of
the most important work done by
any teachers. They are getting new
slants on their respective problems
of interpreting their schools to the
public and of interpreting the public
to their schools. They are learning
how to do better jobs of directing
publications and of teaching journal
ism classes.
All this involves seeing life as it
is—not as it might be or as it should
be. They are finding the bugs in
their work and are trying to find
ways of banning these bugs. In their
conversations they leave off all the
pedagogic flapdoodle.
Maybe it's better that some people,
especially school administrators,
don't visit these classes.

C CARED students who will get the
A's and B's? That is the big
question this week as students who
are finishing summer quarter courses
rush to the bargain counters of their
professors' desks to receive graded
papers.

True Tragedy: A studious young
fellow, who had been attempting
most of his life to gain body weight,
enrolled in a Stanford hygiene
course this summer. In his reading
he studied a number of books on
how to increase torso poundage. He
learned that to eat five meals a day
was a good plan; he learned the
value of proper rest and of other
good health habits. Applying the
knowledge of the hygiene course he
gained six pounds in six weeks, an
accomplishment he had never
achieved before . . . How much
good did he get from the course?
Will he earn an A? No, he read
more stuff than he actually needed

•to read, and neglected reading some
that the prof wanted him to read.
Besides, he writes a foul hand.

Forgotten Feud: On New Year's
Day, 1935, Stanford's Indians whip
ped Southern Methodist's Mus
tangs, 7-0, in Pasadena's Rose
Bowl. The Texas team was favor
ed by the dope. This game was
simply in the books, and not in
the minds of most spectators when
Treasure Island's All-Stars played
an All-Star team from Texas in
San Francisco last Saturday night.
But to a handful of watchers there
was tense drama every time Billy
Dewell and Bill Sanders of S.M.U.
tackled Stanford's ace, Jim Coffis,
The southerners were getting re
venge for that unexpected pasting
in '35.

Little League: The big League of
Nations meets in Geneva. The little
League of Nations meets in the
Stanford Cellar at odd hours around
the coffee table. A mixed group of
students from several different coun
tries have accidentally drawn to
gether in the Union a few times to
settle the world's problems by con
versation.
Overheard Oral: "Why doesn't
Stanford work up some of those co
operative tours to enable students
from far away to see California
scenery?"
