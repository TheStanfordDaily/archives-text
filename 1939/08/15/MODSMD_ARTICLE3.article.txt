# Dee, Low Beaten In Doubles Match
## 
### 
Dropping a five-set match to Wel
by Van Horn and Jack Kramer,
Larry Dee and Bob Low, Stanford
tennis stars, were eliminated from
competition in the national doubles
championships at Chestnut Hill,
Mass., Sunday afternoon, by scores
of 9-7, 3-6, 6-1, 6-8, 6-4.
In the best match of the day, both
teams discarded caution and tried
for "putaways" on almost every
shot. The match proved unexpect
edly good, since Van Horn and Kra
mer were heavy favorites and were
expected to take the match in
straight sets.
