# Old Winery Almost Became Men's Dorm
## 
### 
Palo Alto's Stock Farm, located
over the dirt road leading from the
Mausoleum to the Convalescent
Home, narrowly escaped being the
stronghold of the Stanford Rough
when, many years ago, the Univer
sity officials were casting about for
a new dormitory.
In those days the large building
was brick red and had held an im
portant place in Stanford history as
the "Farm" winery. With the found
ing of the University, the place fell
into disuse and it came within an
ace of being remodeled as a hall for
students. For the past many years
the building and the fields about it
have been leased to various tenants
for truck farming. Nine or ten years
ago its strawberry patches lured the
studentry, and on many a moonlit
night could be heard the reverbera
tion of shotguns, loaded with rock
salt, being discharged at berry pick
ers by irate Mexican tenants. In the
past few years, undesired tomatoes
have been the major product of the
vicinity.
Not until a few years ago, when
the land was leased to a dairy, were
the old wine presses removed from
the building's foundations and the
cobwebby casks tumbled about in
its musty corners rolled aside for
the advent of milk pails and cream
separators.
