## 
### 
A scoop shovel nosed into a mound
of earth yesterday morning at 8:13
o'clock and work on the foundation
of the new Hoover Library of War,
Revolution, and Peace had begun.
The 125-foot square foundation
will be dug by the University with
new machinery bought for the pur
pose. With an average depth of five
feet, the foundation will go down
12 feet under the tower, and 20 feet
under the elevator.
When excavation work is com
pleted in three or four weeks, ac
cording to A. A. Martinez, asso
ciated with the contractors, con
crete pouring will begin. Under the
site of the elevator will be laid a
"mat" of reinforced concrete 65 feet
square and six feet thick.
Structural steel, at present being
fabricated in the East, will then be
erected, and some time in November
the cornerstone of the library will
be laid.
