# Brown Called 'Prejudiced' In Bridges Case
## Charge Made After Communism Defined In Lengthy Paper 
### 
During cross-examination Thomas
B. Shoemaker, chief counsel for the
Department of Labor, clashed with
Examiner Landis in charging "preju
dice and bias" in the testimony given
by Dr. Harold Chapman Brown,
Stanford professor of philosophy, at
Angel Island yesterday.
Subpoenaed as a defense witness,
Dr. Brown testified regarding the
theories of Karl Marx and Freder
ick Engel, saying that the revolu
tion they advocated did not mean
revolution by violence.
After Dr. Brown finished reading
a 15,000-word paper on Communism,
Thomas B. Shoemaker, chief of the
government's counsel, began ques
tioning in regard to affiliations and
belief.
AFFILIATION QUESTIONED
"Are you a communist?" Shoe
maker asked. "Have you ever been
a Communist?" "Have you ever
made application to the Communist
party?"
Dr. Brown answered, "No."
Examiner James M. Landis, dean
of the Harvard Law School, inter
rupted at one point with the re
mark, "I have missed the point, if
it was Shoemaker's intention to show
the professor had a prejudiced in
terpretation of Communism."
"That is exactly what I hope to
bring out," Shoemaker answered,
"that Professor Brown is prejudiced
and biased, and I hope to show it
definitely before I am through."
FORCE NOT PLANNED
"Do you believe that force and
violence is a part of the plan of the
Communist party of the U.S.A.?"
asked Shoemaker as his first cross
examination question.
"I do not believe the communist
party contemplated or plans force
and violence," Dr. Brown answered.
Dr. Brown denied having ever met
Earl Browder, head of the Commun
ist party in America, and said that
he had no direct affiliations with the
party. He admitted being president
of the American-Russian Institute
in San Francisco, but said this in
volved no Communistic affiliations.
Shoemaker's question to Dr.
Brown, "Do you think the philoso
phy of the Soviet Union is better
than the democratic principle?" met
with objection from Examiner Lan
dis.
"Professor Brown's testimony was
on his knowledge of Marxian phi
losophy. Your examination is on the
personal belief of the professor,
which he can hardly be expected to
testify to," he said.
"I am wondering whether you be
lieve the purpose of this hearing is
to try the professor on the issue of
Communism. I should think that a
man could be a great authority on
Communism and still be a good
American citizen.
When Shoemaker later asked Dr.
Brown whether he believed there
was difference between Stalinism
and Leninism he replied, "Not in
basic theory, but it has been altered
by new conditions and problems."
Dr. Brown gave an emphatic "no"
to Shoemaker's question, "Do you
believe that a man can be a good
leader in the American labor move
ment if he does not believe in
Democracy?"

"I am wondering whether you be
lieve the purpose of this hearing is
to try the professor on the issue of
Communism. I should think that a
man could be a great authority on
Communism and still be a good
American citizen.
When Shoemaker later asked Dr.
Brown whether he believed there
was difference between Stalinism
and Leninism he replied, "Not in
basic theory, but it has been altered
by new conditions and problems."
Dr. Brown gave an emphatic "no"
to Shoemaker's question, "Do you
believe that a man can be a good
leader in the American labor move
ment if he does not believe in
Democracy?"
During cross-examination Thomas
B. Shoemaker, chief counsel for the
Department of Labor, clashed with
Examiner Landis in charging "preju
dice and bias" in the testimony given
by Dr. Harold Chapman Brown,
Stanford professor of philosophy, at
Angel Island yesterday.
Subpoenaed as a defense witness,
Dr. Brown testified regarding the
theories of Karl Marx and Freder
ick Engel, saying that the revolu
tion they advocated did not mean
revolution by violence.
After Dr. Brown finished reading
a 15,000-word paper on Communism,
Thomas B. Shoemaker, chief of the
government's counsel, began ques
tioning in regard to affiliations and
belief.
AFFILIATION QUESTIONED
"Are you a communist?" Shoe
maker asked. "Have you ever been
a Communist?" "Have you ever
made application to the Communist
party?"
Dr. Brown answered, "No."
Examiner James M. Landis, dean
of the Harvard Law School, inter
rupted at one point with the re
mark, "I have missed the point, if
it was Shoemaker's intention to show
the professor had a prejudiced in
terpretation of Communism."
"That is exactly what I hope to
bring out," Shoemaker answered,
"that Professor Brown is prejudiced
and biased, and I hope to show it
definitely before I am through."
FORCE NOT PLANNED
"Do you believe that force and
violence is a part of the plan of the
Communist party of the U.S.A.?"
asked Shoemaker as his first cross
examination question.
"I do not believe the communist
party contemplated or plans force
and violence," Dr. Brown answered.
Dr. Brown denied having ever met
Earl Browder, head of the Commun
ist party in America, and said that
he had no direct affiliations with the
party. He admitted being president
of the American-Russian Institute
in San Francisco, but said this in
volved no Communistic affiliations.
Shoemaker's question to Dr.
Brown, "Do you think the philoso
phy of the Soviet Union is better
than the democratic principle?" met
with objection from Examiner Lan
dis.
"Professor Brown's testimony was
on his knowledge of Marxian phi
losophy. Your examination is on the
personal belief of the professor,
which he can hardly be expected to
testify to," he said.
"I am wondering whether you be
