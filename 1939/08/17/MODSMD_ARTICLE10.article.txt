# Time-Lag' Called Fundamental Cause Of Present Economic, Social Disorder
## Princeton Expert Sees Industrial Need for 'Social Science Division' 
### 
That the failure of individuals or corporations to keep step with
•changing" social trends may be one cause of economic conflict is the
belief of Dr. Harwood Childs, noted Princeton public opinion authority,
who spoke at a session of the two-weeks' American Institute of Public
Relations conference on the campus yesterday.

► Terming the public relations
counsel "the general in charge of
synchronizing private and social
movements," the speaker suggested
that the serving of these counsels
as social scientists rather than mere
[ "press agents" may be the ultimate
! solution to governmental and eco
[ nomic conflicts.
"What business may need is a "so
cial science division" to take care of
problems of public relations more
deeply sociological than those of
publicity or propagandizing mer
chandise," declared Dr. Childs.

York public relations counsel, who
took exception to Dr. Childs' asser
tion that business has repeatedly
failed to consider social interests in
planning private enterprise.
Contending that the public rela
tions expert can fill his role as busi
ness' newest guide only through spe
cific public policies primarily re
lated to maintaining business as a
self-supporting unit of the competi

agreed with Dr. Childs' statement
that social implications of private
activities must be the primary con

movements," the speaker suggested
that the serving of these counsels
as social scientists rather than mere
[ "press agents" may be the ultimate
! solution to governmental and eco
[ nomic conflicts.
"What business may need is a "so
cial science division" to take care of
problems of public relations more
deeply sociological than those of
publicity or propagandizing mer
chandise," declared Dr. Childs.
DEFENDS BUSINESS
"Big Business" has adjusted con
flicting interests within its ranks bet
ter than have other professions, in
cluding medicine and religion, be
lieves Edward L. Bernays, New
York public relations counsel, who
took exception to Dr. Childs' asser
tion that business has repeatedly
failed to consider social interests in
planning private enterprise.
Contending that the public rela
tions expert can fill his role as busi
ness' newest guide only through spe
cific public policies primarily re
lated to maintaining business as a
self-supporting unit of the competi
tive system, Mr. Bernays also dis
agreed with Dr. Childs' statement
that social implications of private
activities must be the primary con
cern of such experts.
COUNSELS CAN HELP
An opportunity exists for public
relations counsels to help shift des
titute or relief populations to work
ing centers, believes Harford Pow
el, New York public relations
counsel, who also spoke at the meet
ing.
Dr. Donald D. Lescohier of the
University of Wisconsin, at a con
ference session Monday night, as
serted that other activities of busi
ness men, such as golf or social life,
might effect a better balanced ex
istence than "all work and no play,"
explaining that such a spreading of
interests keeps small businesses
from becoming large ones.
