"CLIDE Grandpa, slide!" And the'
old Wheel Chair got left be
hind in clouds of dust as Grandpa
slid into home plate with the win
ning run.
Moving pictures of the Wheel
Chair Softball League in action will
be shown at 7:30 o'clock tonight in
Room 50, Education Building. No
admission charge and nobody will
be allowed to contribute more than
a dime to the hospitalization fund.

Evaluation Workshoppers came
back from the Exposition Tuesday
night with a new and enthusiastic
appreciation of modern art. Dr.
Ray Faulkner, who will he in
charge of art instruction at Teach
ers College, Columbia University,
beginning this fall, conducted them
on a tour of the art exhibits at the
Fair. It was so interesting, said
one member of the party, that
other Fair visitors kept crowding
around Dr. Faulkner so that mem
bers of the party had to struggle
to get in hearing range.
Fourteen members of the School
of Education force attended a lunch
eon Tuesday in honor of Miss Ruth
Meyer, new secretary in the Lan
guage Arts Investigation office.

W/ANT to pick up a passenger to
go somewhere? Want to pick up
a ride to somewhere and share ex
penses?
Ever notice how the campus
breaks out with a rash of such folks
as the above two classes about this
time of the year? Just name a place
and likely as not somebody knows
of somebody who wants to go there
or take somebody there (but please
be reasonable about the place you
name). Here's hoping the picker
uppers and the pickee-uppees get
together—apply socialization by
traveling together.

Dr. and Mrs. Percy E. Davidson
and their daughter, Mrs. Orray
Taft, Jr., will be guests of the class
in Educational Sociology 26.3 at a
luncheon in the Union today noon.
Committee in charge includes Miss
Greba Logan, Cecil Hollingsworth
and Erwin Dingnian.
Miss Lena Lerza, secretary in the
office of Dr. Norman Fenton for

'the past two years, will leave at the
end of this week to accept a posi
tion in the offices of the Industrial
Accident Commission in San Fran
cisco.

JDLE pastime: imagining the worst
thing that could happen. How
would this be: "The School of Edu
cation decided today to hold classes
another week; no grades will be
given unless you take examina
tions in all classes at the end of
next week." Is that terrible enough
for you? If not, you "just ain't
hooman."
Softball photos are still on sale,
but better hurry up, men! Just
drop in Dr. Bell's office and don't
delay.
* * *
That's all, folks. Finis! Thirty!
Old Man "Scopes" will be here next
week but Education students in gen
eral won't, so good-bye until June,
1940. All who have liked the column
applaud heartily. (Wow, deafening!)
Thanks one and all and especially
those who have helped Old Scopes
ferret out the news.

Flying fish can attain a speed of
50 miles per hour.

Evaluation Workshoppers came
back from the Exposition Tuesday
night with a new and enthusiastic
appreciation of modern art. Dr.
Ray Faulkner, who will he in
charge of art instruction at Teach
ers College, Columbia University,
beginning this fall, conducted them
on a tour of the art exhibits at the
Fair. It was so interesting, said
one member of the party, that
other Fair visitors kept crowding
around Dr. Faulkner so that mem
bers of the party had to struggle
to get in hearing range.
Fourteen members of the School
of Education force attended a lunch
eon Tuesday in honor of Miss Ruth
Meyer, new secretary in the Lan
guage Arts Investigation office.

W/ANT to pick up a passenger to
go somewhere? Want to pick up
a ride to somewhere and share ex

Ever notice how the campus
breaks out with a rash of such folks
as the above two classes about this
time of the year? Just name a place
and likely as not somebody knows
of somebody who wants to go there
or take somebody there (but please
be reasonable about the place you
name). Here's hoping the picker
uppers and the pickee-uppees get
together—apply socialization by
traveling together.

Dr. and Mrs. Percy E. Davidson

JDLE pastime: imagining the worst
thing that could happen. How
would this be: "The School of Edu
cation decided today to hold classes
another week; no grades will be
given unless you take examina
tions in all classes at the end of
next week." Is that terrible enough
for you? If not, you "just ain't
hooman."
Softball photos are still on sale,
but better hurry up, men! Just
drop in Dr. Bell's office and don't
delay.

That's all, folks. Finis! Thirty!
Old Man "Scopes" will be here next
