"CUMMER book champions" are
usually just that, but all promi
nent sports writers and grandstand
quarterbacks (prominent or not) in
sist on establishing them. And few
coaches like to have their teams
predicted as champions.
Stanford's 1939 football team has
come in for its usual share of
glory in winning the "summer
book championship" of the Pa
cific Coast Conference. A few
weeks ago, "Slip" Madigan, St.
Mary's coach, predicted that Stan
ford would very likely be "the
team to beat." Even more re
cently, "Brick" Morse, California's
self-styled "perennial sophomore,"
tooted Stanford's horn a little
more loudly.
Knowledge of the fate of past
"summer champions," and not su
perstition, prompts us not to go too
far overboard for the Indians'
chances this fall. But it seems quite
evident that Stanford will be in the
top flight at the end of the season.
Much of the success of the In
dian team will depend upon
whether or not the present "ques
tion mark" line develops into a
workable unit. With Hamp Pool,
Stojkovich, Willard and Anderson,
and possibly "Corky" Donohue,
returning from last year, there will
be a fair nucleus for the 1939 for
ward wall. And with sophomores
such as McClintock and Jones
coming up, a good line is not be
yond hopes.
The work of Norm Standlee and
Frankie Albert in the backfield will
be a big factor in the coming cam
paign. Standlee showed by his
work as a sophomore last year that
he will be one of the best backs on
the coast. Albert, on the ability he
showed as a freshman and in spring
practice, serves notice that he may
be the best passer on the coast.

overboard. Although an inconspic

curricular activity for men in the

years ago for something which would
give education majors the necessary
physical relaxation and mental en

provided just that. They're as en

"CUMMER book champions" are

quarterbacks (prominent or not) in

coaches like to have their teams
predicted as champions.
Stanford's 1939 football team has
come in for its usual share of
glory in winning the "summer
book championship" of the Pa
cific Coast Conference. A few
weeks ago, "Slip" Madigan, St.
Mary's coach, predicted that Stan
ford would very likely be "the
team to beat." Even more re
cently, "Brick" Morse, California's
self-styled "perennial sophomore,"
tooted Stanford's horn a little
more loudly.
Knowledge of the fate of past
"summer champions," and not su
perstition, prompts us not to go too
far overboard for the Indians'
chances this fall. But it seems quite
evident that Stanford will be in the
top flight at the end of the season.
Much of the success of the In
dian team will depend upon
whether or not the present "ques
tion mark" line develops into a
workable unit. With Hamp Pool,
Stojkovich, Willard and Anderson,
and possibly "Corky" Donohue,
returning from last year, there will
be a fair nucleus for the 1939 for
ward wall. And with sophomores
such as McClintock and Jones
coming up, a good line is not be
yond hopes.
The work of Norm Standlee and
Frankie Albert in the backfield will
be a big factor in the coming cam
paign. Standlee showed by his
work as a sophomore last year that
he will be one of the best backs on
the coast. Albert, on the ability he
showed as a freshman and in spring
practice, serves notice that he may
be the best passer on the coast.

public, summer softball has estab
