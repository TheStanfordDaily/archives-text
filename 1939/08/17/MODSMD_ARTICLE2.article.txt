# Two Shepherds Termed Best Play of Season
## Entire Cast Scores In Stevens Drama 
### 
For individual performances,
Stanford's presentation of "The Two
Shepherds," by G. Martinez Sierra,
is perhaps the best play of the sum
mer season. A charming but ironic
vignette of youth shouldering age
aside in a little Spanish village, this
simple drama distills the best from
Waldemar Johansen's artistic set,
Charles Fitts' mood-setting lights,
and Thomas Wood Stevens' direct
ing.
Ralph Parr seems made for the
part of the gentle but firm old parish
priest, Don Antonio; as Dona Pa
quita, his sharp-tongued but soft-

hearted sister, Wilma Fitts injects
an unaccountable Irish brogue, but
otherwise expresses her character
well.
Cynical, sarcastic, atheistic de
scribes the character that William
Dusel imparts to Don Francisco
Lasada, the doctor who is dislodged
from a 30-year practice along with
his old friend the devout Don An
tonio. A nasal ranting voice and
easy manner make this a striking
role strikingly played.
COMIC CAST SCORES
Merle Meacham playing the irre
pressibly mischievous adolescent,
Juanillo, seems positively type-cast;
a trifle too much sophistication and
too little bounce detract from his
characterization only a bit. Millie
Green's boo-hoo-hoo's as Lucia, the
darling little peasant girl "done
wrong" by the mayor's son set the
high mark for genuine weeping on
a Stanford stage.
As Mateo, the said Mayor's Casa
nova-minded offspring, Ted Marcuse
