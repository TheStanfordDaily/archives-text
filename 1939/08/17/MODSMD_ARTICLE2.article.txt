# Two Shepherds Termed Best Play of Season
## Entire Cast Scores In Stevens Drama 
### 
For individual performances,
Stanford's presentation of "The Two
Shepherds," by G. Martinez Sierra,
is perhaps the best play of the sum
mer season. A charming but ironic
vignette of youth shouldering age
aside in a little Spanish village, this
simple drama distills the best from
Waldemar Johansen's artistic set,
Charles Fitts' mood-setting lights,
and Thomas Wood Stevens' direct
ing.
Ralph Parr seems made for the
part of the gentle but firm old parish
priest, Don Antonio; as Dona Pa
quita, his sharp-tongued but soft-

hearted sister, Wilma Fitts injects
an unaccountable Irish brogue, but
otherwise expresses her character
well.
Cynical, sarcastic, atheistic de
scribes the character that William
Dusel imparts to Don Francisco
Lasada, the doctor who is dislodged
from a 30-year practice along with
his old friend the devout Don An
tonio. A nasal ranting voice and
easy manner make this a striking
role strikingly played.
COMIC CAST SCORES
Merle Meacham playing the irre
pressibly mischievous adolescent,
Juanillo, seems positively type-cast;
a trifle too much sophistication and
too little bounce detract from his
characterization only a bit. Millie
Green's boo-hoo-hoo's as Lucia, the
darling little peasant girl "done
wrong" by the mayor's son set the
high mark for genuine weeping on
a Stanford stage.
As Mateo, the said Mayor's Casa
nova-minded offspring, Ted Marcuse
breaks with his past and delivers
true perception and clean comedy.
From the moment Don Juan de
Dios, a chaplain, steps on stage, Ash
er Wilson takes over the play. His
sly expressions, indescribably apt
voice, and subtle mannerisms attract
all attention. In that he has only one
appearance, the audience is disap
pointed at the final curtain.
SMALL ROLES WELL DONE
A1 Zelver and J. Edwin Arnold
make very good country bumpkins,
bringing their quarrel over an ass
to the parish priest. Harry Muheim
proves that even in Spain a small
town mayor can be a Babbitt, while
the mayoress, Joyce Clumeck, waves
her fan just in the manner of a
would-be aristocrat.
Kathleen Anderson, June Olson,
and Ruth Martin portray respec
tively Dona Gertrudis, the School
Mistress, and Rosita, three ladies of
the community. To small roles they
bring careful attention and individ
ual performances. A green uniform
and decayed military bearing dis
tinguish Luther Thompson as the
colonel of the Civil Guard.
Dark and handsome is Fred Giari
as Don Jose Maria, the new priest
who replaces good grey Don An
tonio.—Leff

her fan just in the manner of a
would-be aristocrat.
Kathleen Anderson, June Olson,
and Ruth Martin portray respec
tively Dona Gertrudis, the School
Mistress, and Rosita, three ladies of
the community. To small roles they
bring careful attention and individ
ual performances. A green uniform
and decayed military bearing dis
tinguish Luther Thompson as the
colonel of the Civil Guard.
Dark and handsome is Fred Giari
as Don Jose Maria, the new priest
who replaces good grey Don An
tonio.—Leff
For individual performances,
Stanford's presentation of "The Two
Shepherds," by G. Martinez Sierra,
is perhaps the best play of the sum
mer season. A charming but ironic
vignette of youth shouldering age
aside in a little Spanish village, this
simple drama distills the best from
Waldemar Johansen's artistic set,
Charles Fitts' mood-setting lights,
and Thomas Wood Stevens' direct
ing.
Ralph Parr seems made for the
part of the gentle but firm old parish
priest, Don Antonio; as Dona Pa
quita, his sharp-tongued but soft-

hearted sister, Wilma Fitts injects
an unaccountable Irish brogue, but
otherwise expresses her character
well.
Cynical, sarcastic, atheistic de
scribes the character that William
Dusel imparts to Don Francisco
Lasada, the doctor who is dislodged
from a 30-year practice along with
his old friend the devout Don An
tonio. A nasal ranting voice and
easy manner make this a striking
role strikingly played.
COMIC CAST SCORES
Merle Meacham playing the irre
pressibly mischievous adolescent,
Juanillo, seems positively type-cast;
a trifle too much sophistication and
too little bounce detract from his
characterization only a bit. Millie
Green's boo-hoo-hoo's as Lucia, the
darling little peasant girl "done
wrong" by the mayor's son set the
high mark for genuine weeping on
a Stanford stage.
As Mateo, the said Mayor's Casa
nova-minded offspring, Ted Marcuse
breaks with his past and delivers
true perception and clean comedy.
From the moment Don Juan de
Dios, a chaplain, steps on stage, Ash
er Wilson takes over the play. His
sly expressions, indescribably apt
voice, and subtle mannerisms attract
all attention. In that he has only one
appearance, the audience is disap
pointed at the final curtain.
SMALL ROLES WELL DONE
A1 Zelver and J. Edwin Arnold
make very good country bumpkins,
bringing their quarrel over an ass
to the parish priest. Harry Muheim
proves that even in Spain a small
town mayor can be a Babbitt, while
the mayoress, Joyce Clumeck, waves
her fan just in the manner of a
would-be aristocrat.
