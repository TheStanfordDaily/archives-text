### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
FITTS, ye old maestro of'
the lighting over at the Memo
rial Theater, will be leaving come
Fall quarter. Said announcement is
one of the saddest to all the theater's
habitues. Chuck and Nellie (Wilma
Fitts), besides being very capable
and versatile, are a couple of swell
people.
The Padua Hills Theater, where
Chuck is to fill the position of gen
eral manager will be getting a good
man. Nellie will probably do some
work there, too.

Looking at some of the records
of last summer's Dramatists' As
sembly, I find that Arthur Mc-
Cullough Sampley, joint winner
of this summer's Anderson Award,
was a runner-up last summer,
winning distinguished second hon
ors with his "Last Illusion." Sec
ond honors last summer, joint win
ner this summer, may be top hon
ors next summer. It is people like
Mr. Sampley who are helping to
further the cause of verse drama
in the American Theater.

By way of the Palo Alto Times
comes news of one of the featured
players in "The Two Shepherds."
The figurine of a Madonna and
Child stands quietly in the Spanish
garden in which the action of the
play centers, and at the end of the
play when the kindly old priest
leaves his parish, he takes it with
him into "exile."
* * *
N° SUCH statutette would be
found in the prop room; an at
tempt to make one fell through. But
luckily, at the last minute a Cath
olic supply house in San Francisco
that could supply the elusive statu
ette was located by Mr. Barker,
house manager, and the Madonna
and Child arrived in time for the
dress rehearsal.

The Drama Division will move
into Women's Clubhouse from 4
to 6 o'clock Friday afternoon
when the classes in Technique of

1 Acting and Projects in Directing
will collaborate in presenting
three one-act plays. They will be
presented in the following order:
"Twilight Saint," directed by J.
Edwin Arnold; "Poverty," directed
by John Van Duser; and "Dust of
the Road," directed by Agnes
Hoffman
The public is cordially invited, and
we might add from experience that
though the plays may lack smooth
ness, they are always interesting.
They are under the supervision of
Thomas Wood Stevens.

By way of the Palo Alto Times
comes news of one of the featured
players in "The Two Shepherds."
The figurine of a Madonna and
Child stands quietly in the Spanish
garden in which the action of the
play centers, and at the end of the
play when the kindly old priest
leaves his parish, he takes it with
him into "exile."

N° SUCH statutette would be
found in the prop room; an at
tempt to make one fell through. But
luckily, at the last minute a Cath
olic supply house in San Francisco
that could supply the elusive statu
ette was located by Mr. Barker,
house manager, and the Madonna
and Child arrived in time for the
dress rehearsal.

The Drama Division will move
into Women's Clubhouse from 4
to 6 o'clock Friday afternoon
when the classes in Technique of

1 Acting and Projects in Directing
will collaborate in presenting
three one-act plays. They will be
presented in the following order:
"Twilight Saint," directed by J.
Edwin Arnold; "Poverty," directed
by John Van Duser; and "Dust of
the Road," directed by Agnes
Hoffman
The public is cordially invited, and
we might add from experience that
though the plays may lack smooth
ness, they are always interesting.
They are under the supervision of
Thomas Wood Stevens.
FITTS, ye old maestro of'
the lighting over at the Memo
rial Theater, will be leaving come
Fall quarter. Said announcement is
one of the saddest to all the theater's
habitues. Chuck and Nellie (Wilma
Fitts), besides being very capable
and versatile, are a couple of swell
people.
The Padua Hills Theater, where
Chuck is to fill the position of gen
eral manager will be getting a good
man. Nellie will probably do some
work there, too.

Looking at some of the records
of last summer's Dramatists' As
sembly, I find that Arthur Mc-
Cullough Sampley, joint winner
of this summer's Anderson Award,
was a runner-up last summer,
winning distinguished second hon
ors with his "Last Illusion." Sec
ond honors last summer, joint win
ner this summer, may be top hon
ors next summer. It is people like
