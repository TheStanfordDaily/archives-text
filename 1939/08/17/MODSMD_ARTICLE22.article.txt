### FRANCIS DUBOIS 
(Editor's Note. — "Make all <
checks payable to Stanford Uni
versity" is one transaltion of the
official Stanford motto, "Die Luft
der Freiheit weht," which really
means "Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow." Of Francis Dußois, '39,
who has attended seven universi
ties in his much travelled career,
the Daily requested a personal
comment on Stanford's motto.)
TNDEED the Winds of Freedom
blow! Several times I have pointed
a moistened finger skyward to de
termine to what degree the Stanford
motto is lived by.
At the risk of being branded an
exhibitionist on the order of gang
land's Dixie Davis, I herewith pre
sent the findings of a test conducted
earlier this year.
The background in brief: A
slightly excessive rate of speed
and a bad adjustment of my rear
view mirror conspired to fetch me
a citation to appear at the J.P.'s
court in Centerville, Alameda
County. The judge, a Cal grad
uate, sentenced me to a five-dol
lar fine or a day in jail. Now, I
am inured to jails, for my prowl
ing proclivities have brought me
short stirs in the prisons of five
European countries, on charges
ranging from riding a bicycle no
handed to suspected espionage. So,
never before having been arrested
in the U.S.—not even for traffic
law violation—l elected to serve
the jail sentence (1) to save five
dollars, (2) to procure material
for a story, and (3) to see just
how drafty are the Stanford Winds
of Freedom.
The judge genially deputized my
companion, a Stanford co-ed, to con
duct me to the splendid new jail on
the banks of Lake Merritt in Oak
land.
With some maneuvering I con
trived to be cell-mate of a young
murderer, Rodney Greig. Rod was
a pleasant companion. We chatted,
played "slap," a card game, worked
a cross-word puzzle, and read Stev
enson's "Apology for Idlers," which
I had brought along to while away
the time.

good behavior, my stretch
was shortened to eight hours.
Greig was facing the toughest rap
justice can mete out; four days later
he was sentenced to death in San
Quentin's lethal gas chamber. The
anomaly of the situation, our unlike
lots, was dramatic and intriguing to
the imagination.
Some of the Daily lads gave me
valuable pointers on how to exploit
the escapade. I marketed an article
to the San Francisco Chronicle for
a sum many times the amount of
the fine I had dodged. The story
was timely and something of a
scoop, for the Bay papers had been
thirsting for copy on Greig for many
weeks.
The German-Czech crisis and
the coronation of Pius XII were
the spot-lit news, but my yarn was
smeared over three columns and
headed "A Stanford Student in
Same Jail Finds Killer Poised,
Quick Witted." A number of ref
erences to Stanford were made.
The story was featured amidst
others on the crime page about
petting party bandits, narcotics
seizures, witchcraft trials, and
brothel hold-ups.
Needless to say, I feared that the
Stanford administration would
squirm at the taint of notoriety I
had attracted to it. And I was al
most reconciled to casting about for

•my next alma mater (it would be
my eighth).
But here came the greatest sur
prise. I wasn't dismissed from
school; I wasn't even called onto
the carpet by Dean Bunn to explain
unbecoming conduct; no-one of the
administration so much as raised an
eyebrow.
I wish to thank Stanford for tol
erance of this extracurricular activ
ity. May the Farm never be con
verted into a concentration camp!
Die Luft der Freiheit weht!
