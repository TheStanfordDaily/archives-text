"Night Before the Border," Jean
Clark's Maxwell Anderson Prize
Play will be presented to Stanford
audiences next Wednesday and
Thursday, Aug. 23 and 24, at 8:15
o'clock in the Little Theater. The
play was recently given a five-day
run at the Pasadena Playhouse as
part of their Maxwell Anderson fes
tival.
Miss Clark of Eugene, Ore., was
co-winner of the award with Ar
thur McCullough Sampley, whose
"Distant Harvest" was presented
during the Dramatists' Assembly
week earlier in the summer. The
dramas were so similar in theme, the
tragedy of modern persecution, and
so equal in quality that the Alli
ance was unable to decide between
them.
Thomas Wood Stevens, director of
"Night Before the Border," has an
nounced the following castings:
Neal Barry, Stanford graduate,
will play Stacy Rand, an American
newspaper correspondent; Irina
Rand, his wife, will be done by
Virginia Rogers.
Margaret Hayes, an English writ
er, will be portrayed by Joyce Clu
meck; Gottfried, chief clerk of the
censor's office, by Ted Marcuse; and
Heinrich, a Storm troop officer, by
Harry Muheim. The role of Karena
will be played by Virginia Sharpe or
Kathleen Anderson; Asher Wilson
and J. Edwin Arnold are reading two
parts, the casting of which will be
settled later.
Admission will be 50 cents, and
reservations may be obtained by tel
ephoning P.A. 22041.
