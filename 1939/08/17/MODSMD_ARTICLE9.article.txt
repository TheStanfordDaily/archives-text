# Turkeys Gobble, Coaches Squabble at New Holiday
## 
### BOB CONNELL 
For another year,
Now that time of gladness,
Thanksgiving Day, is here."
—Old Song
Thanksgiving is advancing on the
nation by leaps and bounds this year,
to the tune of that stirring march,
"Turkey Day the New Deal Way."
President Roosevelt, from safely
outside the United States, in New
Brunswick, has announced that No
vember 23 will be Thanksgiving
Day, not November 30 as previously
supposed by every graduate football
manager in the country.
Perhaps the President forgets
that to return to Washington lie
must skirt the stern and rock
hound coast of New England, pass
ing the harbor of Plymouth, Mass.,
directly under the beetling brows

of the Board of Selectmen, each
the son of a Pilgrim Father. If he
returns hy land through the hos
tile states of Maine and Vermont,
neither one a Democratic strong
hold, he will find Governors Bar
rows and Aiken expressing cordial
disapproval.
The "last Thursday in November,"
precedent for Thanksgiving, has
lasted for close to a century through
Republican and Democratic admin
istrations alike. It was first estab
lished by Abraham Lincoln, an
earlier president. Actually, Presi
dent Roosevelt's proclamation will
affect only Federal territories, the
District of Columbia, and govern
ment employees.
Many of the governors, who really
proclaim the holiday in their sepa
rate states, have refused to recog

nize the proposed change. Others,
among them Governor Olson have
expressed approval. So we will
probably see the "double standard"
in holidays this fall.
Biggest howls at this surprise
turkey "putsch" have come from
football coaches and managers
with midweek games scheduled on
a Thursday that is now no holiday.
California and Stanford arc on op
posite sides of the "fowl" line.
A1 Masters, Stanford graduate
manager, stated he did not believe
the change would affect the "gate"
at the Big Game on November 25.
'It might even help us a bit," he said.
Kenneth Priestley, graduate ath
letic manager at California, natural
ly takes the opposite view. He be
lieves Big Game attendance will be
unfavorably influenced by the fact

that it is now to come in the midst
of the four-day student holiday.
Approval and support of this
quick-step in the march of time
come from merchants, who will
gain a week in the Christmas
shopping season which traditional
ly starts immediately after
Thanksgiving. Poultrymen were
happy, thinking of the hundreds
of dollars worth of feed the tur
keys wouldn't eat in that extra
week. Then they remembered the
money they would lose, lacking a
week's added weight on their tur
keys' frames.
No statement was obtained from
old Mr. Gobbler himself. Polls have
proven that the average mental age
of newspaper readers is over 12.
Find the Boy Scout that believes a
turkey can talk and the Daily will
let him conduct the interview. If
he is successful the turkey and the
Boy Scout will be sent to Ripley's
Odditorium, postpaid and post haste.
Glossed over by commenting jour
nalists was a little-mentioned post
script to the President's proclama
tion. This states that every year,
from 1940 on, Thanksgiving will be
on the second Thursday. From there
on the real trouble will start.
Armistice day enters the picture.
The Daily statistician has calculated,
with the aid of a pair of 8. power
field glasses and an empty bottle,
that Thanksgiving will waver from
November 8 to 14.
This will cause Armistice Day to
fall on the day before, the day after,
and on Thanksgiving Day itself, re
sulting in more confusion for the
masses. The traffic problem alone—
millions of people rushing from 11
o'clock Armistice Services to 1
o'clock turkey dinners—is enough
to bring on nervous indigestion, even
to Democrats.
The dispute will probably be set
tled once and for all in November
1940, unless, of course, election day
falls on Thanksgiving, in which case
it will be a holiday and the polls
will be closed so people can eat in
peace.
For another year,
Now that time of gladness,

Thanksgiving is advancing on the
nation by leaps and bounds this year,
to the tune of that stirring march,
"Turkey Day the New Deal Way."
President Roosevelt, from safely
outside the United States, in New
Brunswick, has announced that No
vember 23 will be Thanksgiving
Day, not November 30 as previously
supposed by every graduate football
manager in the country.
Perhaps the President forgets
that to return to Washington lie
must skirt the stern and rock
hound coast of New England, pass
ing the harbor of Plymouth, Mass.,
directly under the beetling brows

of the Board of Selectmen, each
the son of a Pilgrim Father. If he
returns hy land through the hos
tile states of Maine and Vermont,
neither one a Democratic strong
hold, he will find Governors Bar
rows and Aiken expressing cordial
disapproval.
The "last Thursday in November,"
precedent for Thanksgiving, has
lasted for close to a century through
Republican and Democratic admin
istrations alike. It was first estab
lished by Abraham Lincoln, an
earlier president. Actually, Presi
dent Roosevelt's proclamation will
affect only Federal territories, the
District of Columbia, and govern
ment employees.
Many of the governors, who really
proclaim the holiday in their sepa
rate states, have refused to recog

nize the proposed change. Others,
among them Governor Olson have
expressed approval. So we will
probably see the "double standard"
in holidays this fall.

lished by Abraham Lincoln, an
earlier president. Actually, Presi
dent Roosevelt's proclamation will
affect only Federal territories, the
District of Columbia, and govern
ment employees.
Many of the governors, who really
proclaim the holiday in their sepa
rate states, have refused to recog

nize the proposed change. Others,
among them Governor Olson have
expressed approval. So we will
probably see the "double standard"
in holidays this fall.
Biggest howls at this surprise
turkey "putsch" have come from
football coaches and managers
with midweek games scheduled on
a Thursday that is now no holiday.
California and Stanford arc on op
posite sides of the "fowl" line.
A1 Masters, Stanford graduate
manager, stated he did not believe
the change would affect the "gate"
at the Big Game on November 25.
'It might even help us a bit," he said.
Kenneth Priestley, graduate ath
letic manager at California, natural
ly takes the opposite view. He be
lieves Big Game attendance will be
unfavorably influenced by the fact

that it is now to come in the midst
of the four-day student holiday.
Approval and support of this
quick-step in the march of time
come from merchants, who will
gain a week in the Christmas
shopping season which traditional
ly starts immediately after
Thanksgiving. Poultrymen were
happy, thinking of the hundreds
of dollars worth of feed the tur
keys wouldn't eat in that extra
week. Then they remembered the
money they would lose, lacking a
week's added weight on their tur
keys' frames.
No statement was obtained from
old Mr. Gobbler himself. Polls have
proven that the average mental age
of newspaper readers is over 12.
Find the Boy Scout that believes a
turkey can talk and the Daily will
let him conduct the interview. If
he is successful the turkey and the
Boy Scout will be sent to Ripley's
Odditorium, postpaid and post haste.
Glossed over by commenting jour
nalists was a little-mentioned post
script to the President's proclama
tion. This states that every year,
from 1940 on, Thanksgiving will be
on the second Thursday. From there
on the real trouble will start.
Armistice day enters the picture.
The Daily statistician has calculated,
with the aid of a pair of 8. power
field glasses and an empty bottle,
that Thanksgiving will waver from
November 8 to 14.
This will cause Armistice Day to
fall on the day before, the day after,
and on Thanksgiving Day itself, re
sulting in more confusion for the
masses. The traffic problem alone—
millions of people rushing from 11
o'clock Armistice Services to 1
o'clock turkey dinners—is enough
to bring on nervous indigestion, even
to Democrats.
The dispute will probably be set
tled once and for all in November
1940, unless, of course, election day
falls on Thanksgiving, in which case
it will be a holiday and the polls
will be closed so people can eat in
peace.
