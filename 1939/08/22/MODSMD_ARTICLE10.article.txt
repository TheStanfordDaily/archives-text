# Berry Praises Farm Theater
## Visiting Actor Lauds Talent Opportunities 
### 
Neal Berry, who will play Stacy
Rand in "Night Before the Border"
on the Little Theater stage tomor
row night, is a professional Broad
way actor who came to Stanford to
audit some courses because after a
month of his self-enforced vacation
he couldn't stand being away from
the theater. Thomas Wood Stevens,
director, asked him to work in a play,
and here he is, and "enjoying it
immensely."
"Working with Mr. Stevens is one
of the finest things that has hap
pened to me recently. He is the eas
iest and one of the most sensitive
directors I have worked with," the
tall young actor said.
LOCAL VETERAN
A veteran of the Palo Alto Com
munity Theater and campus stage,
he appeared in such productions as
"Three-Cornered Moon" and "Yel
low Jack." Mr. Berry has been busy
for the past four years supporting
major dramatic artists in New York.
Impressed with Stanford's new
theater, Mr. Berry asserted that its
plant was far superior to those of
many professional theaters. "It is
progressing so rapidly that it will
soon be comparable to the Yale
workshop and the Carnegie Tech
School of the Theater," Mr. Berry
commented.
PRAISES DEPARTMENT
"The department here is training
people far better now for storming
Broadway than when I was in
school. I doubt if there are more
than six or seven universities with
schools of this caliber throughout
the country."
He spoke of the Maxwell Ander
son Prize Play contest as being a
most encouraging sign to young
writers and said that he believed
good verse drama is one of the fin
est dramatic mediums. Discussing
"Night Before the Border," he re
ferred to Virginia Rogers, who is
playing Irina, as an "extremely tal
ented young woman."
"Stanford is doing its share in a
very capable fashion to arouse
greater interest in the drama. I am
impressed with the workmanlike
manner in which everything is han
dled here; props, lights, everything.
It is just as if one were with a pro
fessional company and I am quite
sure that some of the people here
have had more experience and long
er runs than I," he concluded,
smiling.

The praying mantis is the only
insect in the world that can turn its
head about like a man.
