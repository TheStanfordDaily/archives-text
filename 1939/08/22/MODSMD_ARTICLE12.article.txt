# 'Night Before Border' Starts Run Tomorrow
## Prize Play to Be Offered Thursday Night in Season's Final Production 
### 
The plight of outspoken newspaper correspondents in dictatorships
motivates the plot of "Night Before the Border," the Maxwell Anderson
prize play which will be presented in the Little Theater tomorrow and
Thursday night at 8:15 o'clock.
Neal Berry, Stanford '35, has returned to the campus to play the lead-

ing role in Jean Clark's award
drama. Berry has been working on
the New York stage for the last four
years, in a bit in John Gielgud's
"Hamlet" and later in a small part
in Maurice Evan's "Richard II." As

soon as "Night Before the Border"
is over, 'Mr. Berry will return to his
engagement with Judith Anderson
in "Family Portrait."
The action is laid in a German
border town filled with storm troop
ers, and treats the tense position of
a young American correspondent,
his Russian wife, an English fellow
journalist, and a Jewish professor
and friend â€”all seeking to cross the
border before midnight.
"The modern idiom and unhack
neyed verse form, restricted setting,
and compact cast, make this a play
distinctly in the modern manner for
the modern theater," says Margaret
Hamilton Storey, editor-in-chief for
Dramatist's Alliance. Joint winner
of the Anderson Award with Arthur
Sampleys' "Distant Harvest," "Night
Before the Border" was presented at
the Pasadena Playhouse as an item
in the Maxwell Anderson Festival
of this summer; Miss Clark's play
was applauded for its effective
qualities of tensity and tenderness.
LEAD TAKEN BY BERRY
The role of the newspaper corre
spondent is taken by Mr. Berry. He
is supported by Virginia Rogers,
Joyce Clumeck, Virginia Sharpe,
Marcuse, and Asher Wilson, all
of whom have been trouping during
spring and summer quarters in
modern and Shakespearean Stanford
productions.
"Night Before the Border" will be
Mr. Thomas Wood Stevens' last pro
duction at Stanford. In the autumn
he leturns to New Mexico to super
vise folk pageantry for the district.
He has served as acting director of
dramatics at Stanford for the last
two years.
