JEAN CLARK, author of "Night*
Before the Border," which goes
on the Little Theater boards tomor
row night, expects to attend the first
performance. Miss Clark, who now
lives in Eugene, Ore., formerly re
sided on the peninsula and attended
San Mateo Junior College, where
she received the beginning of her
dramatic training. That she must
have been a very good student is at
tested by the favorable comments
her Maxwell Anderson Award play
is receiving.
Dr. Margery Bailey, who has just
returned from Pasadena, arrived
there too late to see their produc
tion of "Night Before the Border,"
but said that the play was well re
ceived, and elicited favorable re
views.
* * ♦
"Night Before the Border" also
marks the last appearance here as
a director of Thomas Wood Stev
ens, whose finished productions of
both Shakespearean and modern
pieces have delighted Stanford au
diences for the past two years.
Few college directors could
complete four performances of one
play ("The Two Shepherds," and
a swell play it was) Saturday
night, and have ready the follow
ing Wednesday a new verse drama
with business polished to urbane
precision. Mr. Stevens, from his
long experience at Goodman The
ater and Carnegie Institute and
the discipline he created for the
Globe Theater Players and other
groups, not only can do it, but
does it with unruffled ease.
* * *
More on "Night Before the Bor
der": The lighting crew on this
production is really going to have a
work-out. The effects include an
air-raid when the lights of the city
go out, and the scene shifts from a
basement to an attic room.
♦ * *
The Dramatist's Alliance staff
will entertain the "Night Before the
Border" cast, director, and friends
after the performance Wednesday
night at Dr. Bailey's home.
John Gould Fletcher, the eminent
poet, will also attend. He has writ
ten several unpublished verse
dramas, and his interest, therefore, is

►not only the interest of a lyric poet
in lines but also of drama in verse.
The faculty of the School of Let
ters and of the Division of Speech
and Drama co-operated with the
Pasadena Playhouse in their Max
well Anderson Festival last week.
It is the custom of the Playhouse
to precede each week's run with
a lecture on the forthcoming play.
* * *
It was the wish of the Playhouse
because of Anderson's Stanford con
nection, to have all the week's lec
turers Stanford people. Henry David
Gray, instructor in play writing,
gave the opening lecture on "Eliza
beth the Queen." Vergil Whitaker,
because of his grounding in the
classics, discussed Medea, the central
character in "Wingless Victory."
Mr. Heffner, new head of the Drama
Division, lectured on "Both Your
Houses," and Miss Bailey gave an
address on "Star Wagon."

Houses," and Miss Bailey gave an
address on "Star Wagon."
JEAN CLARK, author of "Night*
Before the Border," which goes
on the Little Theater boards tomor
row night, expects to attend the first
performance. Miss Clark, who now
lives in Eugene, Ore., formerly re
sided on the peninsula and attended
San Mateo Junior College, where
she received the beginning of her
dramatic training. That she must
have been a very good student is at
tested by the favorable comments
her Maxwell Anderson Award play
is receiving.
Dr. Margery Bailey, who has just
returned from Pasadena, arrived
there too late to see their produc
tion of "Night Before the Border,"
but said that the play was well re
ceived, and elicited favorable re
views.
* * ♦
"Night Before the Border" also
marks the last appearance here as
a director of Thomas Wood Stev
ens, whose finished productions of
both Shakespearean and modern
pieces have delighted Stanford au
diences for the past two years.
Few college directors could
complete four performances of one
play ("The Two Shepherds," and
a swell play it was) Saturday
night, and have ready the follow
ing Wednesday a new verse drama
with business polished to urbane
precision. Mr. Stevens, from his
long experience at Goodman The
ater and Carnegie Institute and
the discipline he created for the
Globe Theater Players and other
groups, not only can do it, but
does it with unruffled ease.

More on "Night Before the Bor
der": The lighting crew on this
production is really going to have a
work-out. The effects include an
air-raid when the lights of the city
go out, and the scene shifts from a
basement to an attic room.

The Dramatist's Alliance staff
will entertain the "Night Before the
Border" cast, director, and friends
after the performance Wednesday
night at Dr. Bailey's home.
John Gould Fletcher, the eminent
poet, will also attend. He has writ
ten several unpublished verse
dramas, and his interest, therefore, is

►not only the interest of a lyric poet
in lines but also of drama in verse.
The faculty of the School of Let
ters and of the Division of Speech
and Drama co-operated with the
Pasadena Playhouse in their Max
well Anderson Festival last week.
It is the custom of the Playhouse
to precede each week's run with
a lecture on the forthcoming play.

It was the wish of the Playhouse
because of Anderson's Stanford con
nection, to have all the week's lec
turers Stanford people. Henry David
Gray, instructor in play writing,
gave the opening lecture on "Eliza
beth the Queen." Vergil Whitaker,
because of his grounding in the
classics, discussed Medea, the central
character in "Wingless Victory."
Mr. Heffner, new head of the Drama
Division, lectured on "Both Your
