"The Transbay Bridge will
not be materially damaged, if
at all, by any earthquake likely
to occur in the region." Dr.
Bailey Willis requests us to
publish this statement as his
considered opinion, to correct
the common report to the con
trary which appeared in our
issue of last week.
He bases his opinion on the
facts: the bridge is deeply
founded on rock like that of the
hills of San Francisco, where
there was no damage in 1906; it
was designed by competent en
gineers to resist shock and was
built with scrupulous care un
der the direction of the ablest
men in the profession. More
over its form and proportions
are such that any oscillation it
may develop in response to
the earthquake vibrations will
probably be a gentle swaying to
and fro, perhaps sufficient to
bother a driver in steering.
