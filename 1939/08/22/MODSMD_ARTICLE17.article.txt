# Bernays Tells Power of Words
## Publicist Predicts 'Paper Bullets' War 
### 
"Words will be as potent as bullets
in the next European war," declared
Edward L. Bernays, New York coun
sel on public relations, yesterday in
one of a series of lectures on public
relations being given on the campus.
"Paper bullets will have a more
devastating effect than lead bullets,
and word symbols rained from the
air will secure the winning or loss
of battles in front line trenches."
In the last war, according to Ber
nays, words had greatest effect on
non-combatants behind the lines and
through (hem an indirect effect on
the armies at the front. In the next
war there will be no non-combat
ants. Airplane attacks make all
populations combatants.
"There may soon be generals and
colonels leading battalions of 'word
specialists' in the public relations
of maintaining national interest and
security, as there now are army of
ficers carrying out activities in the
line at headquarters, and in the
service of supplies," said Bernays.

Ohio's oldest brick road is believed
to be a street in Steubenville laid
in 1882.

Ten years ago the United States
textile industry had 35,267,000 spin
dles; now it has only 25,854,000.
