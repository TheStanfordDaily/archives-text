JF HE can subdue all competitors
in the State Amateur Golf Cham
pionship at Del Monte and come out
with the title, Warren Berl will
have something more to crow about.
Runner-up in the national col
legiate championships last month,
Berl has already served notice that
he will have to be reckoned with.
Among the top notch players of the
state, Berl reigns as one of the fa
vorites to cop the title.
But looking at the competition
he will he up against in this tour
nament, it is hardly likely that
anyone will name Berl as the
number one man. To mention only
two, there are Roger Kelly and
Mat Palacio.
Kelly, the "rajah of the California
fairways," is a two-time winner who
will be facing the "third time jinx."
In the history of the tournament, no
competitor has been able to win
three years consecutively. Several
have won twice, but never has the
trick been turned to make it three
in a row.
Palacio is an ex-champ, having
been dethroned in 1937 by the above
mentioned Kelly, when the latter
routed him 11 and 10. Incidentally,
he was also National Interscholastic
champion in 1933.
And with Ernie Pieper. Don Ed
wards, Bob McGlashan and John
Gray, the tournament presents a
strong field. Any one of them
could heat Berl. Any one of them
could unhorse Kelly and take the
title.
Nothing has come from the East
recently regarding the progress of
Paulman and Calvelli on the college
all-star football team. We doubt the
fact that there may be no progress
to report, but are inclined to the
opinion that there are a number of
mighty good boys vieing for the po
sitions on that team, and that the
Stanford aces are finding competi
tion awfully tough.
At any rate, it is difficult to per
ceive how the all-star coaches can
keep valuable men like Calvelli and
Paulman on the bench for very long.
They should be seeing action before
the game is over, and plenty of it at
that. Of course, "plenty of action"
for the all-star team does not mean
60 minutes of football, or anywhere
near it. Fifteen minutes would not
be objectionable when they are play
ing for a team consisting of the 60
best college players in the nation
last year.
Rumor printed in the San Fran
cisco News last week suggested that
"Tex" Byrd has the inside track for
"Dink" Templeton's job. However,
Dr. Thomas Storey was out of town
this week, and consequently the
"rumor" cannot be confirmed.

near it. Fifteen minutes would not
be objectionable when they are play
ing for a team consisting of the 60
best college players in the nation
last year.
Rumor printed in the San Fran
cisco News last week suggested that
"Tex" Byrd has the inside track for
"Dink" Templeton's job. However,
Dr. Thomas Storey was out of town
this week, and consequently the
"rumor" cannot be confirmed.
JF HE can subdue all competitors
in the State Amateur Golf Cham
pionship at Del Monte and come out
with the title, Warren Berl will
have something more to crow about.
Runner-up in the national col
legiate championships last month,
Berl has already served notice that
he will have to be reckoned with.
Among the top notch players of the
state, Berl reigns as one of the fa
vorites to cop the title.
But looking at the competition
he will he up against in this tour
nament, it is hardly likely that
anyone will name Berl as the
number one man. To mention only
two, there are Roger Kelly and
Mat Palacio.
Kelly, the "rajah of the California
fairways," is a two-time winner who
will be facing the "third time jinx."
In the history of the tournament, no
competitor has been able to win
three years consecutively. Several
have won twice, but never has the
trick been turned to make it three
in a row.
Palacio is an ex-champ, having
been dethroned in 1937 by the above
mentioned Kelly, when the latter
routed him 11 and 10. Incidentally,
he was also National Interscholastic
champion in 1933.
And with Ernie Pieper. Don Ed
wards, Bob McGlashan and John
Gray, the tournament presents a
strong field. Any one of them
could heat Berl. Any one of them
could unhorse Kelly and take the
title.
Nothing has come from the East
recently regarding the progress of
Paulman and Calvelli on the college
all-star football team. We doubt the
fact that there may be no progress
to report, but are inclined to the
opinion that there are a number of
mighty good boys vieing for the po
sitions on that team, and that the
Stanford aces are finding competi
tion awfully tough.
At any rate, it is difficult to per
ceive how the all-star coaches can
keep valuable men like Calvelli and
Paulman on the bench for very long.
They should be seeing action before
the game is over, and plenty of it at
that. Of course, "plenty of action"
for the all-star team does not mean
60 minutes of football, or anywhere
near it. Fifteen minutes would not
be objectionable when they are play
ing for a team consisting of the 60
best college players in the nation
