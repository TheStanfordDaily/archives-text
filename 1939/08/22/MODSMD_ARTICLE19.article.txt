## 
### 
Choosing one's parents with care
is the secret to a long and interest
ing life, confided Professor Bailey
Willis, professor of geology emeritus,
to a Toyon Hall smoker last Thurs
day night.

Drawing on the adventures of
four-score years spent in virtually
every country on the globe, Dr. Wil
lis described encounters with wild
Indians, hill-billies, Chinese, and
Stanford graduates. While each in
cident was interesting in itself, all of

them went to prove Dr. Willis' point
that loyalty of man to man is the
most valuable attribute of living.
Several dozen Toyon men at
tended the smoker at which cig
arettes, cigars, and ice-cream on
sticks were passed around. The
speaker was introduced by Francis
Du√üois, Toyon manager.
