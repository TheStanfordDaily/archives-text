"What you think of all these re- (
ligions?" asked Li San, my head
coolie, in the heart of China.
"I have known good men under
many of them, Li; but what do
you think of them yourself?"
"Oh, I?" Li was puzzled to say
it. "I just a coolie. AH I know is
do the other feller like I want him
do me."
In Jerusalem, the "Holy City of
Hate," some 50-odd years ago, a
minister and his wife, upon whom
the hand of God lay heavy in the
loss of three daughters by ship
wreck, founded the American Col
ony, an organization dedicated to
service among the women and
children in need—and they are
numberless. It still carries on,
though able to alleviate only a small
part of the suffering caused by ig
norance and cruel intolerance.
During the World War, when Al
lenby was advancing and the nar
row streets were choked with the
wounded and dying of the retreat
ing Turks, Joseph Spofford, son of
the founder, volunteered the serv
ices of the Colony, saying to the Mo
hammedan Governor: "We are not
doctors, but we can nurse."
Said a British officer to me years
afterward: "I don't know what we
would have done, had it not been
for that wonderful American Col
ony." It is a group of about 80
straight-thinkers, united to main
tain the Anna Spofford Baby
Home, located on the Crusaders'
wall of the old city, and a ma
ternity clinic. It is a self-sup
porting business organization, run
for half a century on the prin-

On the island of Bali gifted peo
ple of Malay descent, devout be
lievers in the Hindoo religion, live
in village communities, each one di
rected by its elders, independently
of others. The rice fields and other
property essential to living are
communal. It is one of the oldest
forms of organized government and
under it the Balinese are happy,
without strife; but not because of
their village councils. Their gen
eral satisfaction in life springs from
the principle which is the foundation
of their self respect:
He who does not do all in his
power to promote the common
good is not worthy of a share of
the common goods.
In the City by the Golden Gate
live two men: the one, an agitator
by profession, has demonstrated only
too successfully the destructive, vit
riolic effect of his activities. The
other would have America follow
Li San and Christ. Which way are
we going?

their village councils. Their gen
eral satisfaction in life springs from
the principle which is the foundation
of their self respect:
He who does not do all in his
power to promote the common
good is not worthy of a share of
the common goods.
In the City by the Golden Gate
live two men: the one, an agitator
by profession, has demonstrated only
too successfully the destructive, vit
riolic effect of his activities. The
other would have America follow
Li San and Christ. Which way are
we going?
"What you think of all these re- (
ligions?" asked Li San, my head
coolie, in the heart of China.
"I have known good men under
many of them, Li; but what do
you think of them yourself?"
"Oh, I?" Li was puzzled to say
it. "I just a coolie. AH I know is
do the other feller like I want him
do me."
In Jerusalem, the "Holy City of
Hate," some 50-odd years ago, a
minister and his wife, upon whom
the hand of God lay heavy in the
loss of three daughters by ship
wreck, founded the American Col
ony, an organization dedicated to
service among the women and
children in need—and they are
numberless. It still carries on,
though able to alleviate only a small
part of the suffering caused by ig
norance and cruel intolerance.
During the World War, when Al
lenby was advancing and the nar
row streets were choked with the
wounded and dying of the retreat
ing Turks, Joseph Spofford, son of
the founder, volunteered the serv
ices of the Colony, saying to the Mo
hammedan Governor: "We are not
doctors, but we can nurse."
Said a British officer to me years
afterward: "I don't know what we
would have done, had it not been
for that wonderful American Col
ony." It is a group of about 80
straight-thinkers, united to main
