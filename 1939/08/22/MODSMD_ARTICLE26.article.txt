# Business Policy Relies on Public
## 
### 
The American public is as safe a
guide to policy as any select ma
jority. This theory was proved by
the answers of 93 business men to
a poll given yesterday as a part of
the public relations course now be
ing conducted by Professor Harwood
Childs of Princeton University.
The 14 questions on political and
economic questions were selected
from an American Institute of Pub
lic Opinion Poll.
The business men held closely to
party lines, which were predomi
nantly Republican, in all questions
of political importance, possible
presidential candidates and disap
proval of current administration
policy, according to Dr. Childs.
"A comparison of results of the
Stanford and national polls seems
to me to confirm the proposition
that on questions of general social
and economic public policy, the col
lective mind of the American people
is a safer guide than the opinion
of any small minority or self-ap
pointed elite," was Dr. Childs con
clusion from the test poll here.
