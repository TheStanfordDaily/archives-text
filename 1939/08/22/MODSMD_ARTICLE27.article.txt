# Nicol to Discuss 'Poets in Prison'
## 
### 
"French Poets in Prison" will be
the subject of a radio speech by Dr.
Theodore Nicol on the Stanford Ra
dio Program tomorrow night from
7:15 to 7:30 o'clock over KGO.
Dr. Nicol will attempt to show
that poets, being imaginative peo
ple, suffer less from prison life than
the normal person. To illustrate his
point he will briefly discuss the ef
fects of prison life on such famous
poets as Charles, Duke of Orleans;
Francois Villon, Andre Chenier, and
Paul Verlaine.
