# Sewer, Gas Mains Shifted for Libe
## 
### 
Shift of the sewer and gas mains
has occupied most of the first week
on the Hoover Library. This is nec
essary before the contractors can
continue the preliminary digging.
Such digging as is possible at the
present time has just begun. The
university has excavated about 8
feet in one place, but it will be nec
essary to dig an additional 16 feet
before construction can begin, ac
cording to the construction fore
man.
