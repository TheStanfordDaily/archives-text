# Bailey Refutes Manila Legend
## 
### 
The legend that British battle
ships prevented German ships from
attacking Dewey's fleet at Manila
Bay in 1898 has been disproved by
a Stanford history professor, Dr.
Thomas A. Bailey.
In an article, "Dewey, the Ger
mans, and the British at Manila Bay,
1898," to appear in the October is
sue of the American Historical Re
view, Dr. Bailey, long a student of
American diplomatic history, dis
proves this 40-year-old myth by
showing that the British captain
steered his two cruisers between the
German and American ships merely
to get a ring-side view of the
bombardment of Manila, and not at
all to intervene in threatened hos
tilities.
PHOTOSTAT EVIDENCE
Drawing upon photostats of log
books and the private papers of Ad
miral Dewey, the article further
proves that the Germans had no
intention of attacking the American
forces, despite their ungracious con
duct during the siege of Manila. Had
he had hostile intent, Vice-Admiral
von Diedcrich would have attacked
before the American line was aug
mented by the powerful Monterey,
and would not have reduced his own
force from five to three ships.
Ever since the World War the
supposed incident of British aid and
German unfriendliness at Manila
has been exploited by propagandists
and others. In a radio broadcast
January 14, 1938, Dorothy Thomp
son had the British save Dewey from
the Germans just before the battle
of Manila Bay; Westbrook Pegler in
his column for September 3, 1938,
referred to the "British admiral who
stood off the Germans at Manila
Bay . .

Professor Bailey, whose textbook,
"Diplomatic History of the Ameri
can People," will be published late
this year, is author of many mono.-
graphs on incidents in American
history. In an article on the sinking
of the Lusitania, he disproved many
popular suppositions surrounding the
ship, drawing on the original logbook
of the German submarine which
sank the giant liner.
As of May 1, there were a total
of 2,371 airports and landing fields
in the United States.

supposed incident of British aid and
German unfriendliness at Manila
has been exploited by propagandists
and others. In a radio broadcast
January 14, 1938, Dorothy Thomp
son had the British save Dewey from
the Germans just before the battle
of Manila Bay; Westbrook Pegler in
his column for September 3, 1938,
referred to the "British admiral who
stood off the Germans at Manila
Bay . .
HISTOY EXPERT
Professor Bailey, whose textbook,
"Diplomatic History of the Ameri
can People," will be published late
this year, is author of many mono.-
graphs on incidents in American
history. In an article on the sinking
of the Lusitania, he disproved many
popular suppositions surrounding the
ship, drawing on the original logbook
of the German submarine which
sank the giant liner.
As of May 1, there were a total
of 2,371 airports and landing fields
in the United States.
The legend that British battle
ships prevented German ships from
attacking Dewey's fleet at Manila
Bay in 1898 has been disproved by
a Stanford history professor, Dr.
Thomas A. Bailey.
In an article, "Dewey, the Ger
mans, and the British at Manila Bay,
1898," to appear in the October is
sue of the American Historical Re
view, Dr. Bailey, long a student of
American diplomatic history, dis
proves this 40-year-old myth by
showing that the British captain
steered his two cruisers between the
German and American ships merely
to get a ring-side view of the
bombardment of Manila, and not at
all to intervene in threatened hos
tilities.
PHOTOSTAT EVIDENCE
Drawing upon photostats of log
books and the private papers of Ad
miral Dewey, the article further
proves that the Germans had no
intention of attacking the American
forces, despite their ungracious con
duct during the siege of Manila. Had
he had hostile intent, Vice-Admiral
von Diedcrich would have attacked
before the American line was aug
mented by the powerful Monterey,
and would not have reduced his own
force from five to three ships.
Ever since the World War the
supposed incident of British aid and
German unfriendliness at Manila
has been exploited by propagandists
and others. In a radio broadcast
January 14, 1938, Dorothy Thomp
son had the British save Dewey from
the Germans just before the battle
of Manila Bay; Westbrook Pegler in
his column for September 3, 1938,
