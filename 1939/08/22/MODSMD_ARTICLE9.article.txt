# Lightning Machine to Have 'Kick' of Two Million Volts
## 
### 
Flashes of lightning six or seven
feet long, with a 2,000,000-volt kick—
power enough to shatter a log into
match-like splinters—will be gen
erated by a new type impulse or
"lightning" generator now being
constructed at the Ryan High Volt
age laboratory by William R. John
son, research assistant.
The new generator, designed by
Dr. William G. Hoover, assistant
professor of electrical engineering,
will replace several pieces of the
present equipment at the laboratory.
It will be completed during this fall
quarter, probably in October, ac
cording to Johnson.
BOLTS TO HAVE MORE SOCK*
Because lightning electricity dif
fers in action from regular power
line current, bolts from the new ma
chine will have more "sock" than
power sparks obtained from the big
laboratory transformer. The new
machine will also be easier and
more spectacular to demonstrate.

The present transformer is only used
every one or two years but the
lightning generator can be rigged
for action in a short time and will
be used much more often.
Practical use for the generator
will be in testing all types of out
door power equipment which are
subject to lightning shocks and
studying the different effect of these
shocks as compared with those of
ordinary line current.
REDWOOD TO BE USED
Redwood is now being dried in
special ovens and coated with paraf
fin for construction of the 20-foot
tower which supports the machine.
It is absolutely necessary, explains
Johnson, to have all the moisture
which conducts electricity removed
from the wood.
The paraffin seals the wood against
further moisture. In this condition
the treated wood has been found to
be a better non-conductor of elec
tricity than most ordinary insulat
ing compositions, says Johnson.
