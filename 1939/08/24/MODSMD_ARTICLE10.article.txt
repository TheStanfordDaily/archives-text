"Perhaps poets are the kind of men
that might be the least unhappy in
jail," hypothesized Dr. Theodore
Nicol in a talk entitled, "French
Poets in Prison," on the Stanford
Radio Program last evening.
"Being imaginative people they
can create a world of fancy and
thereby delude themselves that the
traditional 'stone walls and iron bars
do not (always) a prison make',"
Dr. Nicol said.
The speaker illustrated his point
by citing incidents from the lives of
such famous French poets as
Charles, Duke of Orleans, Francois
Villon, Andre Chemier, and Paul
Verlaine. Dr. Nicol brought out that
these men wrote some of their best
works while in prison.
