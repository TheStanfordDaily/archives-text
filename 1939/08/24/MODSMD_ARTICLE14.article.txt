Kaleidoscope of the summer:
Millie Green's pert impudence as
Ariel, flitting about the stage,
truly little more than air. . . .
Virginia Rogers' ingenuous ren
dering of the role of Miranda in
the same play. . . . The Division
of Speech and Drama en masse on
the back steps of the theater. . . .
Ye correspondent taking a terrific
beating as some yells at my de
parting back:
"Hey, did you hear about Julius
Caesar?"
"What is this, a gag?"
"No, it's the straight goods." This
with wide-eyed innocence.
"0.K., I'll bite, what about it?"
"He's dead!" Ye correspondent
moves on muttering.
The quietness but authentically
moving quality of "The Two Shep
herds," the marvelous bit by Ash
Wilson as the Chaplain. . . . Bill
Dusel's characterization as the Doc
tor. . . . Not quite getting the third
act of the "Ascent of F6." . . . The
backshop's ranting at the bi-weekly
dose of stage business. . . . Our pri
vate conviction that the best per
formances of the summer have been
given by Dr. M. Bailey in English
25, her reading of Lear and lago
calls for rave notices. . . . Virginia
Rogers' ethereal loveliness as Irina.
I thought I'd be glad when the
time came to write this Swan Song,
but now I wish I could follow the
example of so many of the stage's
old-timers, who make farewell ap
pearances after farewell appear
ances. Because it's been fun,
scrambling a colyum together
twice weekly; however it's time
to write —30—.
To everyone over at the Theater,
without whose interest and co-op
eration, this column would never
have been possible, thanks awfully.
Hope the fall brings fat roles and
full houses to you all.
