# Prize Play Undermines Cast
## 
### 
Viewing the first and second act
on one night, and the third act in
dress rehearsal is not the most ideal
manner in which to see a new play,
to give it fair and considered treat
ment, but the exigencies of space
and time made it necessary, if a
review of Jean Clark's "Night Be
fore the Border," playing for the
last time tonight in the Little Theater,
was to appear in the last issue of
the Stanford Daily.
Termed a tragedy of modern per
secution, the play calls a spade a
spade. Germany is Germany, and

the Nazis Nazis, but somehow this
story of an American foreign cor
respondent, his wife, an English
friend, and a Jewish refugee, lacks
punch. Neal Berry, fresh from
Broadway, is a disappointment. Us
'uns in the hinterlands have seen
better. His delivery and action
slowed down the pace of the play,
and his lovely speaking voice was
not enough to make up for his other
weaknesses.
Virginia Rogers was a lovely Irina,
despite a slightly inconsistent ac
cent, and a wistful poignancy she

gave the part will linger in the
audience's memory.
Ginny Sharpe's portrayal of Kar
ene, whose world has been knocked
out from under her since the rise
the Leader to power, is one of the
outstanding performances in the
play.
