T ARRY DEE is getting up in the
world. The Stanford freshman
ace turned in the biggest surprise of
the Newport Casino tennis tourna
ment by trouncing Bernard Destre
meau, French star, Tuesday.
We are willing to lay our total
capital (six bits at present) on Dee
to take the national intercollegiate
title before he finishes his four
years at Stanford. He has proven to
be probably the best prospect Stan
ford has ever had.

All this does not come within
the category of "summer book
champions," subject of a previous
commentary. Dee, by his work in
tournaments this year, his first in
"big time" tennis, has definitely
proved himself. His latest victory
only puts the final stamp on him
as a future great.

Football experts for years have
been trying to compare Ernie Nev
ers and Jim Thorpe as the two.
greatest fullbacks that ever lived.
This year, they already show evi
dence of making attempts to com
pare Norm Standlee with Nevers as
the greatest Stanford fullback.

A LL of which will conclude noth
ing. What method of comparison
is there? Statistics? How can they
compare over a period of 16 years?
The game itself has changed vastly.
The players are naturally playing
against teams of different strength
today than they were one or two
decades ago. For all we know (and
there is still no method of exact
comparison), Stanford may be meet
ing much stronger competition now
than in "the old days."
• * *
The only possible way of com
paring yesterday's players and teams
with those of today reeks slightly of
Utopianism. One would have to put
the teams of yesterday back in their
prime, then play them against the
teams of today. It just can't be done.
Comparisons like these amount
to nothing more than just plain
stuff and nonsense. It will be a
boon to the coaches and players
when the sports writers forget the
past and keep on living in the
present, taking things as they
come, evaluating them according
ly with things of the present in
stead of the past. The past is dead.
May it rest in peace.
