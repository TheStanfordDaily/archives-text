# Stanford Library Exhibits Belgian War-time Records
## 
### 
Belgian war-time records, letters,
and periodicals, selected from the
Hoover collection, are being display
ed in the lobby of the Stanford
Library.
Included in this exhibit are ship
ping records of the Commission for
Relief in Belgium, which was organ
ized in 1914 under the chairmanship
of Herbert Hoover. The commission
purchased, transported, and super
vised the distribution of food and
other commodities for the relief of
the population of Belgium and
Northern France, which was being
occupied by the German armies.
SHIPPING RECORDS SHOWN
One section of this arcliive collec
tion consists of 1586 folders of ship
ping records covering 2112 voyages
of C.R.B. vessels plying for the most
part between the United States and
Canadian ports and the Netherlands.
These vessels flying the Belgian Re
lief flag and provided with German
safe conduct passes, were permitted
to penetrate the blockades and dock
at the neutral Dutch port of Rot
terdam. From there their cargoes
of food and clothing were sent by
canal and rail to the communal
stores in occupied regions.
These shipping records supply a

'vivid and accurate picture of an im
portant link in the intricate chain
of operations whereby a population
of over 9,000,000 was kept alive in a
territory of 20,000 square miles, oc
cupied over four years by the forces
of an enemy power.
In spite of every precaution, not
all relief ships escaped the hazards
of these trips. The exhibited records

of the S. S. "Fridland" show that it
was mined in the North Sea on its
first voyage.
Curtailment of the press by Ger
man authorities in occupied Belgium
resulted in the appearance of many
clandestine newspapers and jour
nals. The Hoover Library possesses
over 50 files of such periodicals, con
taining over 1400 issues.
The most famous of these was the
"Libre Belgique," published by Bel
gian patriots throughout the period
of occupation. In spite of much ef
fort, the German authorities were
unable to prevent publication of
play.—Reviewer.

ping records of the Commission for
Relief in Belgium, which was organ
ized in 1914 under the chairmanship
of Herbert Hoover. The commission
purchased, transported, and super
vised the distribution of food and
other commodities for the relief of
the population of Belgium and
Northern France, which was being
occupied by the German armies.
SHIPPING RECORDS SHOWN
One section of this arcliive collec
tion consists of 1586 folders of ship
ping records covering 2112 voyages
of C.R.B. vessels plying for the most
part between the United States and
Canadian ports and the Netherlands.
These vessels flying the Belgian Re
lief flag and provided with German
safe conduct passes, were permitted
to penetrate the blockades and dock
at the neutral Dutch port of Rot
terdam. From there their cargoes
of food and clothing were sent by
canal and rail to the communal
stores in occupied regions.
These shipping records supply a

'vivid and accurate picture of an im
portant link in the intricate chain
of operations whereby a population
of over 9,000,000 was kept alive in a
territory of 20,000 square miles, oc
cupied over four years by the forces
of an enemy power.
In spite of every precaution, not
all relief ships escaped the hazards
of these trips. The exhibited records

of the S. S. "Fridland" show that it
was mined in the North Sea on its
first voyage.
Curtailment of the press by Ger
man authorities in occupied Belgium
resulted in the appearance of many
clandestine newspapers and jour
nals. The Hoover Library possesses
over 50 files of such periodicals, con
taining over 1400 issues.
The most famous of these was the
"Libre Belgique," published by Bel
gian patriots throughout the period
of occupation. In spite of much ef
fort, the German authorities were
unable to prevent publication of
play.—Reviewer.
