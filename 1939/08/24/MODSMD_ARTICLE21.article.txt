W/HAT is the Stanford University"
Press? To some people the
Press is the bus stop for Roble and
Lagunita. To others it is a commer
cial print shop located on the cam
pus. Few people realize the Press
is a department of the University,
maintaining a staff of some 70 per
sons primarily for the purpose of
fulfilling the printing requirements
of the University. All of the bulle
tins — Announcement of Courses,
"Bawlout," Information Bulletin,
and many others—all forms and sta
tionery employed in the routine op
eration of departments, are products
of this plant.

The plant proper, housed in a
building almost completely hid
den from the view of the passer
by, is equipped with the most
modern machinery for high-speed
publication printing. In addition to
the large volume of pamphlet
binding of bulletins and period
icals, and the cloth binding of
Press books, repairing and re
binding of library hooks is done
in the Press bindery.

Of course, to many people, espe
cially educators, the name Stanford
University Press does not represent
a manufacturing plant, but a pub
lishing house that ranks with the
other university presses of the
country. Last year more than 30
titles were issued from the Press,
printed and bound on the campus.
These titles are representative of
many fields. The only types of
manuscripts not considered for pub
lication are fiction, current poetry,
and juveniles. Authorship is not re
stricted to our campus. In fact,
more than half of our authors are
from other localities; a few have no
academic connections.

,r pHE Photolith department of the
Press was established several
years ago to fulfill a need of instruc
tors in western colleges and univer
sities. The Photolith process en
ables the Press to prepare and re
produce syllabi and other class and
laboratory materials in typewritten
form at considerable saving over
regularly printed material. The re
sult is clear, legible material, usu
ally issued in small edition for use
by an instructor in his own classes,
often bound in the form of a regu
lar book. In this phase of the Press
activities, materials produced at
Stanford are used in many western
institutions, including the Univer
sity of California, Chico and San
Jose State Colleges, College of the
Pacific, U.C.L.A., and as distant as
the University of Arizona.

For the students of the Univer
sity, a variety of work is done.
Printing of The Daily on a spe
cial web perfecting press is per
haps the largest regular job han
dled for the student organizations.
The Photolith Section of The
Daily is a very popular illustrated
supplement. The Chaparral is
regularly produced in this plant,
employing both letterpress print
ing and Photolith for the printing
of the sections containing most il
lustrations. Press artists co-op
erate by suggesting ideas for il
lustrating and arranging material
in new and interesting ways.
Hie hum of activity within the
Press continues through the sum
mer, gaining momentum as the open
ing of the school year approaches.
September is perhaps a dull month
for most departments of the Uni
versity, but the presses are turning
out forms, syllabi, and textbooks to
be used in fall classes. The state

ment often repeated: "Oh, I thought
you had the summer off if you
worked for the University," is met
with a smile by those at the Press.
