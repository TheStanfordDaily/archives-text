# Daily Offers Vacation Hints For Between-Quarter Rest
## 
### MARY JUDSON 
To most of the citizens of these"
United States, and even to those
lucky enough to be native to Cali
fornia, late August marks the be
ginning of the end of vacation sea
son; but not so for summer school
students who are just winding up
another session. A month in which
to rest up, to relax, to have a good
time at many near vacation spots
lies between the end of finals and
registration day in the fall.
To those new to the coast (this is
my first summer here) as well as
to those who live permanently in
the Bay area, San Francisco offers
constant attraction in the way of
eating places, theaters and places of
scenic interest such as Chinatown,
Fishermen's Wharf and Mission Do
lores.
FAIR RECOMMENDED
Of interest to everyone, native or
otherwise, is, of course, the Golden
Gate Exposition on Treasure Island.
If you have been meaning to go
all summer, but just haven't gotten
around to doing it, now is your
chance. The Fair is in full swing.
It won't be so crowded now that
the influx of summer vacationers is
diminished, and it is known that, as
far as the weather is concerned, the
start of fall is the best season for
San Francisco.
For the week-end pilgrimage for
rest and relaxation, Monterey Pen
insula appears to be the most popu
lar. Carmel, Del Monte and historic
Monterey are the best bets for good
times on the beach. With more time
and money to spend, just continue
on down the coast for sunny days
in Southern California.

1 Tahoe still holds its own as the
most popular lake resort in the state.
Here it is the style to own a sum
mer cabin of your own, however
small. If you don't, it is next best
to have a friend or friends with one,
and manage to get invited up for a
couple of days. Without this there
are still several lodges where it is
convenient and pleasant to stay, but
the season is closing, so it's up to
you to hurry.
PARKS PROVE POPULAR
The same is true of Yosemite,
which is no it_ss popular a summer
resort, as it i? a winter one when
it is mobbed during skiing days.
r ihe redwoods are at their best dur
ing warm wen r .i :r when shade seem>
'it a premium And if you core to
go farther south for coolness (yes
coolness), Sej[ JO 'i Park will a!>.o u-
Jei redwoods.
Other favor it?, j for those in se;:?cn

of a holiday include the ever
handy Russian River, Brookaale
Lodge, and for a quiet hideaway
with all the conveniences you might
try Lokoyah Lodge above Napa.
The state is yours for a good va
cation time!
