# Director Mears Summarizes Summer Quarter Activities
## 
### ELIOT G. MEARS Director, Summer Quarter 
The summer quarter this year has
produced many interesting features.
We should note, first of all, the suc
cession of important conferences,
commencing with the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science, Pacific Division, which had
nearly a thousand participants, and
including such groups as the Sym
posium on the Cell and Protoplasm,
National Colloid Symposium, the
Conference on Educational Fron
tiers, the third Stanford Business
Conference, and the Sixth Pacific
Science Congress.
The School of Education has of
fered distinctive work in their Eval
uation Workshop, summer classes
for elementary and high school pu
pils, and the study of modern lan
guage curriculum.
CONCERTS PRAISED
Again we have been favored by
the presence of the Roth Quartet,
with their performances in Memo
rial Church and the Union Court, as
well as their series of six concerts
in Memorial Hall, sponsored by the
Friends of Music.
On the Tuesday Evening Series, a
special concert by the quartet was
given through the generosity of our
musical benefactor, Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge.
The Dramatists' Alliance, under
the auspices of Dr. Margery Bailey,
presented a splendid program of ra
dio offerings, lectures on European
verse drama, and play readings, cul

minating in the Dramatists' Assem
bly from July 31 to August 5.
NOTEWORTHY PERFORMANCES
The Division of Speech and Drama
gave noteworthy performances of
"The Tempest," "The Two Shep
herds," and "Night Before the Bor
der." A delightful presentation of
the classic Spanish drama, "Periba
nez y El Comendador de Ocana," un
der the direction of Visiting Pro
fessor Margarita de Mayo of Vassar,
was also much appreciated by our
community.
The Sunday morning services in
Memorial Church were exceedingly
well attended, and the Sunday af
ternoon Vesper Services in the
Laurence Frost Memorial Amphi
theater were a welcome addition to
our summer program.
That social activities and sport
have not been neglected is evident
by formal dances, jolly-ups, and
soft-ball contests. The summer
quarter continues to be a period of
recreation as well as contemplation,
relaxation as well as serious study.
In spite of a decline in student en
rollment, as compared to last year,
which is in line with the nation
wide trend this summer, our aca
demic program has been fuller than
in any previous session. We have
been favored by a distinguished vis
iting faculty, a fine student body,
and a noteworthy series of diversi
fied and distinctive campus attrac
tions amid ideal weather conditions.

given through the generosity of our
musical benefactor, Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge.
The Dramatists' Alliance, under
the auspices of Dr. Margery Bailey,
presented a splendid program of ra
dio offerings, lectures on European
verse drama, and play readings, cul

minating in the Dramatists' Assem
bly from July 31 to August 5.
NOTEWORTHY PERFORMANCES
The Division of Speech and Drama
gave noteworthy performances of
"The Tempest," "The Two Shep
herds," and "Night Before the Bor
der." A delightful presentation of
the classic Spanish drama, "Periba
nez y El Comendador de Ocana," un
der the direction of Visiting Pro
fessor Margarita de Mayo of Vassar,
was also much appreciated by our
community.
The Sunday morning services in
Memorial Church were exceedingly
well attended, and the Sunday af
ternoon Vesper Services in the
Laurence Frost Memorial Amphi
theater were a welcome addition to
our summer program.
That social activities and sport
have not been neglected is evident
by formal dances, jolly-ups, and
soft-ball contests. The summer
quarter continues to be a period of
recreation as well as contemplation,
relaxation as well as serious study.
In spite of a decline in student en
rollment, as compared to last year,
which is in line with the nation
wide trend this summer, our aca
demic program has been fuller than
in any previous session. We have
been favored by a distinguished vis
iting faculty, a fine student body,
and a noteworthy series of diversi
fied and distinctive campus attrac
tions amid ideal weather conditions.
The summer quarter this year has
produced many interesting features.
We should note, first of all, the suc
cession of important conferences,
commencing with the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science, Pacific Division, which had
nearly a thousand participants, and
including such groups as the Sym
posium on the Cell and Protoplasm,
National Colloid Symposium, the
Conference on Educational Fron
tiers, the third Stanford Business
Conference, and the Sixth Pacific
Science Congress.
The School of Education has of
fered distinctive work in their Eval
uation Workshop, summer classes
for elementary and high school pu
pils, and the study of modern lan
guage curriculum.
CONCERTS PRAISED
Again we have been favored by
the presence of the Roth Quartet,
with their performances in Memo
rial Church and the Union Court, as
well as their series of six concerts
in Memorial Hall, sponsored by the
Friends of Music.
On the Tuesday Evening Series, a
special concert by the quartet was
given through the generosity of our
musical benefactor, Mrs. Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge.
