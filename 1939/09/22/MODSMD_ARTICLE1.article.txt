# History ...1939

### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
All over the world this week
people are boarding trains. Paris,
London, Berlin—in stations lit dimly
by pale, blue lights, precaution
against marauding bombers, young
men are bidding good-bye to rela
tives and sweethearts. Silent, dark
ened trains move through the night
to a new western front.
In America from Bangor to San
Diego, Palm Beach to Seattle, two
and a half million college students
are glancing hurriedly at timetables,
tossing aspirin tablets, tooth brushes
and tweed suits into sticker-plas
tered suitcases. A certain quota of
them are bound for Stanford Uni
versity, California. They'll bid fare
wells, too, and board trains. But
their destination will not be as grim
and uncompromising as that of their
European friends. A college dormi
tory may be no palace, but it isn't
a Maginot or a Siegfried line.
In the bitter poker game of
European politics, the cards that
are marked with the red letters
of war turned up in this summer's
deal. Just 25 years and one month
after they were played in Sara
jevo, Adolf Hitler saw them in his
hand. He'd arranged part of them
neatly a year before at Munich.
But the powers of Europe hadn't
raised the ante; they hadn't called
for the showdown that every poker
player knows so well. That game
was played at Munich and Adolf
raked in the stakes.
r jphis month, as the big men of Eu
rope again faced each other
across the Rand-McNally table-top
that had been the scene of their
earlier card-playing, the balance had
shifted. The pair of deuces that Ne
ville Chamberlain had held at Mun
ich had changed, miraculously, into
'ae Royal Flush. And Daladier, some
hoNw, seeme'd determined to play his
Full tHouse for all it was worth. The
bluff w«es up. All that remained was
to "cry I havoc on the land and un
leash tl je dogs of war."
England and France kept their
treaty yvith Poland one dark Sun
day morning after reports had been
definitely confirmed that German le
gions had invaded Polish soil.
Once again the great northern.
European plain has become the
battle ground of the nations.
Lacking any distinct natural boun
daries, Poland's borders for cen
turies have been the dividing line
between Germans and Slavs. There
could be no bigger mistake than to
imagine that the fight began with
the Treaty of Versailles.
J n 1772 Catherine the Great of Rus
sia, Frederick of Prussia, and
Maria Theresa of Austria played
their first game of mumblety-peg
with Poland, cutting out about one
fourth of the nation. The game con
tinued until, in' 1790, Poland was
inevitably destroyed as an independ
ent power, despite the heroic stand
of Kosciuszko, and Russia became a
European nation.
The Treaty of Versailles ressur
rected the land that had disappeared
from the European map a century
and a quarter before. These Poles,
somehow, take Patrick Henry seri
ously. That's why, even though
Number-two Nazi German Goering
predicts that all Poland will be at
the mercy of German troops inside
one week, less prejudiced observers
say that it will take Hitler far
longer than he dreams to quell the
nationalistic country.
This is Europe's "background
for war," 1939 style. And Stanford,
in the flimsy security of its ivory
tower, can't escape hearing, now
and then, the rumble of distant
guns that may invade even the
most private of "private worlds.".

All over the world this week
people are boarding trains. Paris,
London, Berlin—in stations lit dimly
by pale, blue lights, precaution
against marauding bombers, young
men are bidding good-bye to rela

to a new western front.
In America from Bangor to San
Diego, Palm Beach to Seattle, two
and a half million college students
are glancing hurriedly at timetables,
tossing aspirin tablets, tooth brushes
and tweed suits into sticker-plas
tered suitcases. A certain quota of
them are bound for Stanford Uni
versity, California. They'll bid fare
wells, too, and board trains. But
their destination will not be as grim
and uncompromising as that of their

a Maginot or a Siegfried line.
In the bitter poker game of
European politics, the cards that
are marked with the red letters
of war turned up in this summer's

after they were played in Sara
jevo, Adolf Hitler saw them in his
hand. He'd arranged part of them
neatly a year before at Munich.
But the powers of Europe hadn't
raised the ante; they hadn't called
for the showdown that every poker
player knows so well. That game
was played at Munich and Adolf
raked in the stakes.
r jphis month, as the big men of Eu
rope again faced each other
across the Rand-McNally table-top
that had been the scene of their
earlier card-playing, the balance had
shifted. The pair of deuces that Ne

ich had changed, miraculously, into
'ae Royal Flush. And Daladier, some
hoNw, seeme'd determined to play his
Full tHouse for all it was worth. The
bluff w«es up. All that remained was
to "cry I havoc on the land and un

England and France kept their
treaty yvith Poland one dark Sun

Once again the great northern.
European plain has become the
