# Code Regulates Late Leaves
## Quotas According To Class, Grades 
### 
Late leave regulations, though they
.seem complex to the freshmen
women, have been found as satis
factory as any regulations could be,
and have been agreed upon by the
Stanford women themselves.
All University residences for
women remain open until 10:30
o'clock on week night* (Sunday
through Thursday), and until 12
o'clock on Friday and Saturday
nights. A woman need not sign out
unless she is going to return after
the hall is closed.
First quarter freshmen women are
allowed one 2:30 leave each week.
This must be taken on either Friday
or Saturday night. Through the
quarter, freshmen women may have
three additional 2:30 leaves which
must also be used on week-ends.
Two special 2:30 leaves may be
granted throughout the quarter so
that cultural events off campus may
be attended. Permission for these
must be obtained beforehand from
the chairman of Women's Council.
For the A.S.S.U. Concert Series,
slips designated "cultural" are used.
These expire one half hour after the
performance is over.
So-called "lock-outs" occur when
a woman returns to the hall later
than the time for which she signed
out, when she fails to sign out, or
when a sign-out slip is filled out
incorrectly. Freshman lock-outs of
less than an hour are dealt with by
the Roble Committee of Five. Those
more than an hour are handled by
Women's Council.
Penalties for lock-outs are called
"lock-ins." The group which handles
a woman's case will designate certain
nights when she must remain in the
hall after 8 o'clock. However, she
is not checked, and the keeping of
lock-ins is under the honor code.
