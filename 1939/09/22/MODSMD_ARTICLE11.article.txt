o'clock Friday morning, Sept. 22, 700 new Stanford
men and women will have their first introduction to
Farm life.
On hand to greet the influx of freshmen will be

Ned Pugh, his committee of 40 pre-<
registration workers, and men and
women's sponsors. In an extensive
round of events that will allow the
'43-ers never a dull moment, the
committeemen will unfold the social
and academic picture of Stanford
days.
Before most of the 3300 regulars

members of the Class of '43, with
barbecue, jolly-up, campus tours
and a series of assorted entertain
ment that will occupy every minute
of three full days, already will have

been tabbing as "college life."
LETTERS MAILED
During the summer months a let
ter from Ken Cuthbertson, A.S.S.U.
president, and Ned Pugh, pre-reg
chairman, was mailed to over 800
prospective students who had been
accepted by the University. Mean
while, over 40 committee workers
had been shaping plans for the
crowded three-day period that would
welcome new lower division stu
dents. Basing their program on a
survey conducted among last year's
freshmen, revealing that the jolly
up and barbecue were the most pop
ular events, Pugh's assistants elimi
nated the least-liked items, concen
trated on the favored ones.
Pugh commented yesterday that,
in last year's class, only 22 students
failed to attend the Pre-Reg Pro
gram, a fact which contributed to
the large number of reservations
that have been made this year.
Ninety-nine per cent of the Class of
'42 voted their complete approval of
the orientation program.
When frosh have settled in Encina
and Roble on Friday morning, many
will arrange appointments for med
ical examinations. For all those who
have not taken it, the Aptitude Test
will be administered in Room 214,
History Building, at 1:30 o'clock.

dining halls at 6:15 o'clock Friday
night.

LETTERS MAILED
During the summer months a let
ter from Ken Cuthbertson, A.S.S.U.
president, and Ned Pugh, pre-reg
chairman, was mailed to over 800
prospective students who had been
accepted by the University. Mean
while, over 40 committee workers
had been shaping plans for the
crowded three-day period that would
welcome new lower division stu
dents. Basing their program on a
survey conducted among last year's
freshmen, revealing that the jolly
up and barbecue were the most pop
ular events, Pugh's assistants elimi
nated the least-liked items, concen
trated on the favored ones.
Pugh commented yesterday that,
in last year's class, only 22 students
failed to attend the Pre-Reg Pro
gram, a fact which contributed to
the large number of reservations
that have been made this year.
Ninety-nine per cent of the Class of
'42 voted their complete approval of
the orientation program.
When frosh have settled in Encina
and Roble on Friday morning, many
will arrange appointments for med
ical examinations. For all those who
have not taken it, the Aptitude Test
will be administered in Room 214,
History Building, at 1:30 o'clock.

first meals will be served in the
dining halls at 6:15 o'clock Friday
night.
House meetings in Roble and a
conclave in Encina lobby will fill the
evening. Dean of Men John Bunn
will be the principal Encina speaker,
while Major Harry R. Allen, R. O.
T. C. head, and Joe Weiner, head
sponsor, will speak briefly. In ac

LETTERS MAILED
During the summer months a let
ter from Ken Cuthbertson, A.S.S.U.
president, and Ned Pugh, pre-reg
chairman, was mailed to over 800
prospective students who had been
accepted by the University. Mean
while, over 40 committee workers
had been shaping plans for the
crowded three-day period that would
welcome new lower division stu
dents. Basing their program on a
survey conducted among last year's
freshmen, revealing that the jolly
up and barbecue were the most pop
ular events, Pugh's assistants elimi
nated the least-liked items, concen
trated on the favored ones.
Pugh commented yesterday that,
in last year's class, only 22 students
failed to attend the Pre-Reg Pro
gram, a fact which contributed to
the large number of reservations
that have been made this year.
Ninety-nine per cent of the Class of
'42 voted their complete approval of
the orientation program.
When frosh have settled in Encina
and Roble on Friday morning, many
will arrange appointments for med
ical examinations. For all those who
have not taken it, the Aptitude Test
will be administered in Room 214,
History Building, at 1:30 o'clock.

dining halls at 6:15 o'clock Friday
night.
House meetings in Roble and a
conclave in Encina lobby will fill the
evening. Dean of Men John Bunn
will be the principal Encina speaker,
while Major Harry R. Allen, R. O.
T. C. head, and Joe Weiner, head
sponsor, will speak briefly. In ac
cordance with social regulations,
Roble will close at 10:30 o'clock.
Alter a 7:15 o'clock breakfast, the
new frosh will be herded to Memo
rial Hall for the official welcoming
assembly. Ned Pugh, master of
ceremonies, will introduce Cuthbert
son and Coline Upshaw, A.S.S.U.
vice-president. Marco Thorne, "Old
Boy" of Chaparral and campus
funny-man, has promised to do
some "baby-killings." A Hawaiian
trio will sing, and Bob Mallett may
be present to augment the humor de
partment. Main item of the assembly
will be the first appearance to new
students of Coach Tiny Thornhill,
Card mentor. Yell King Johnny
Seamans, aided by Gordy Nicoll and
Ed Cook, will lead songs and yells.
At the end of the meeting, all frosh
will be introduced to their faculty
advisers. They will then arrange

for Saturday and Monday to discuss
academic programs.
