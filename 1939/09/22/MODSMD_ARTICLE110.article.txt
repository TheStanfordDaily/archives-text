# Stanford Street Scene
## 
### 
Three years ago this month a freshman en
tered Stanford. One tennis racket, three polo
shirts—he hoped he was properly equipped—
two pair of slacks, one sport coat, and a burn
ing inferiority complex that had been follow
ing him around as long as he could remember.
As he opened the door to his room on the
third floor of Encina Hall for the first time he
tried to forget the things that frightened him
about Stanford—the school for rich men's sons,
the place where athletes and sophisticates
quickly were respected and mediocrities merely
were tolerated.
Once inside, he was surprised when the
husky football player sitting on the bed did not
shoot at him the up-and-down glance he had
expected. He was shocked when he rushed
toward him to take his bags and smiling,
grasped his hand. Something was wrong.
Perhaps this man felt that it was his social
obligation to make his new roommate wel
come. The newcomer had started to open one
of his suitcases when a splintering crash
sounded outside the door and it opened to ad
mit three hulking freshman football men.
He pretended not to notice them and fumbled
clumsily with one of the straps on his bag, but
his new friend called him up from the floor and
introduced him to the athletes. It was funny,
he thought afterward, they had seemed gen
uinely glad to meet him, and they seemed
interested in the answers to the questions they
fired at him, not merely relieved that formali
ties were over.
Thinking of their apparent sincerity gave
him courage to walk downstairs to the lobby
after they had gone out to practice. The room
was full of young men talking in groups, but
he saw only a solitary chair against the wall,
and he made for it as quickly as possible to
avoid the embarrassment of being seen stand
ing alone.
He did not notice the tall, towsled-haired,
blond fellow who stood in his way until he
had bumped into him and was engaged in mut
tering excuses. But this one shook his hand
too, and smiled, and started a conversation.
After a few minutes he took the new fresh
man over to one of the groups and introduced
him around the circle. Names—the newcomer
tried hard to remember them, but by the time
the process was over he could recall only
the surnames of the son of the great paint
manufacturer and the fellow who had won the
scholarship he had applied for.
He could not help thinking, even when he
was adding a sentence or two to the conversa
tion, how new, how pleasant this experience
was.
When there was a lull, he heard himself say
ing, "This Stanford—it's a little different from
what I thought it would be."
