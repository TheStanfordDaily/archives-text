# Democracy Dissected
## 
### 
Fifty-four years ago, when Senator and Mrs.
Stanford endowed the University, they did so
with the conviction that they were founding a
democratic institution. And in a large measure
Stanford has fulfilled the trust that they placed
in it.
However, it is neither the will of the found
ers, nor of the Board of Trustees, nor of the
faculty that has kept the tradition of democracy
alive. The students, who have seen fit to gov
ern themselves sanely and efficiently, accord
ing to standards of truth and decency and
honor, are the men and women who have nur
tured that vital spirit.
Behind the glowing success that has made
government by students as complete at Stan
ford as it is at any other university lies a single
basic factor. Someone has called it the Honor
Code.
Because the student body has taken upon it
self the responsibilities of enforcing the rules
of fair play in writing examinations, in prepar

ing outside papers and themes, in using the
Library, the system, which in some institutions
would be considered impossible, has been an
outstanding success.
The Honor Code applies not only to aca
demic work, but to social regulations—closing
hours in women's residences and the funda
mental standard of conduct befitting a Stanford
man or woman.
Officials elected from the student body en
force the Code, and the records of the Men's
and Women's Councils stand witness to the
fact that they make it work.
Each new student entering the University
is thoroughly instructed in the principles of the
Honor Code and the regulations that have been
made in connection with it. Stanford expects
the individual to give them his serious con
sideration and to live up to the standards they
have established.
The man or woman who violates the Honor
Code seeks to destroy the democracy which is
the real spirit of Stanford.
