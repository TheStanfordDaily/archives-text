# FORGIVE US, FROSH

/ \NE of Stanford's most firmly entrenched traditions
is the tradition of establishing traditions. Every
September upperclassmen vigorously descend upon
the incoming frosh with welcomes as eager as those of
a ieciuiting officer, and with Farm customs at their
fingertips. Despite our misleading enthusiasm, we aie
not trying to sell you insurance, or even enlist you in
the British arrny. (The English are pretty good at
doing that for themselves.)
But we do have two objectives: First, to do exactly
the opposite of what many other colleges do; that is,
to make you realize that you are wanted. And second,
to build up our own egos with that indispensable feel
ing of "showing someone else around." Our most
magnanimous hope is that we can achieve the first
goal (welcoming you) with as sure-fire results as we
invariably achieve the second—making ourselves feel
good.
It m.-.y seem strange to some of you that so much
verve ;-.nd organization can be centered on fourteen
square miles of Stanford campus while war hysteria
is burning the world's cities like the incarnation of a
million Neros. Millions of Frenchmen are concen
trating on the Saarbrucken; Germany is sweeping
Poland; the British navy is blockading the oceans; the
United States is nervously wondering how long it can
stay out. And Stanford is all the while as busy as if
an air-raid had sounded—preparing not for airplanes,
but freshmen.

jk FRIEND of mine recently remarked that if he goes
to war it will be too bad to have wasted as much
time as he has in the dentist's chair. And some people
feel the same way about college—although perhaps a
little more strongly. And some answer such irony
in-despair with admissions of futility: We're going to
have a world war anyway. So why worry? Might as
well have a good time while we can. And that attitude
often borders on an even more futile one: not even
bothering to get the news the censors let us have—to
bothering to read the papers except when the head
lines get so big that it takes an effort to avoid them.
It is probably unreasonable to expect college men
and women to be full masters of "the way out," and
even foolhardy to expect that of a Bull Sessioner.
But it is certainly not Stanford's duty to forget about
events that may so soon directly affect us. That doesn't
mean that we have to forget Stanford either.
The Farm has a lot to offer those of us who find
an interest in Poland and Washington, as well as a
lot for those of us who make the amazing combina
tion of interests known as football, current events, and
pre-reg. And coming to this center of diverse fields,
where the interested (and interesting) Stanfordite can
find what, he looks for, involves registration and ac
climation. Registration—that mad whirl of fountain
pens that hits the ad building—is pretty much a case
for rugged individualism. But acclimation we hope to
help you with.
If that be a far cry from the Western Front, forgive
us, frosh. And hope for one week with us that it will
always be that far away.
