pOETRY and scicnce make strange bedfellows, but
Robin Lampson has not hesitated to combine them
in his latest novel in cadence, "Death Loses a Pair
of Wings."
Another story of the yellow fever brigade, this one
is the life of Dr. William Gorgas, the man who wiped
out yellowjack.
Lampson, claimed by both Stanford and California
as their fair-haired boy of literature, devotes most of
the book to Gorgas' early life in order to show how
the scourge of the tropics affected him even before
his birth. After treating this completely, he seems to
tire of his material and to rush to the final pages.
The picture of Gorgas as a tongue-tied young man
in love is one of the most appealing parts of the book,
but the direct and straight-forward style that charac
terizes this section disappears in latter parts of the
work.
Lampson encounters difficulties when he attempts to
explain scientific pursuits in blank verse. But he gives
a well-known history a new approach by telling it as
the story of a man with a job to do, not as the biqg
raphy of a scientist.
Gorgas is seen as a very real person at the first of
the book, but when the narrative takes him to Cuba,
his personality is submerged in events of epic propor
tions. At times he is a little too noble to be believ
able, but after all, great men are seldom like ordinary
mortals.
The author of "Laughter Out of the Ground" had a
definite idea in mind when he wrote this second novel.
He wanted to tell why people become what they are,
and as an example, shov/s how Gorgas became a hero
in a way that he had never planned.
The style of "Death Loses a Pair of Wings" is
reminiscent of Stephen Vincent Benet's "John Brown's
Body." Although it is no great epic, it is an interesting
story and the blank verse is a melodic relief from
ordinary prose.
