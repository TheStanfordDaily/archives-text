## 
### 
Beginning his first year in charge oi Stanford's Division of Speech and
Drama is Hubert Heffr.cr, who left his post as head of the theater depart
ment at Northwestern University to take over the Farm's drama activities.
"You have one of the finest plants in the country here," he said, "and
only the limitations of the men in charge can stop Stanford from becoming

•the leading school of drama in the !
United States. And, if we find our!
limitations'are too great, then we
must get out and let in other men
who can do the job."
Tentatively, two plays a quarter 1
are being scheduled by the division. 1
These will be divided, about equally, |
between the big and little theaters, j
The policy of major classic produc- J
tions will not be changed, but in j
addition the better moderns will be!
given due notice, with special at- !
tention on the American contempo- j
raries.
Particular emphasis will be placed
this year on original plays, and the
playwriting course will continue
through all three quarters. Mr.
Heffner hopes to have many of these j
original plays produced and pub
lished during the year. He is also'
interested in writings on local Cali- ;
l'omia subjects .
"It is our aim to have a widely
varied program," he concluded, "and
we shall work to integrate the pro
gram of study for students in the
Division of Speech and Drama so |
that they will have a broad cultural
background as well as good tech- ;
nical knowledge."
