# Farm Tradition Says No Dinks
## Democratic Theme Sounds Keynote 
### 
Senator and Mrs. Stanford, in 1891,
sounded the keynote of future Stan
ford years when they stated, "Let
Stanford be a school where a poor !
boy can receive an education." j
Their democratic plea has bred j
Stanford's democracy which in turn
has given rise to Stanford's wealth
of traditions.
The fact that incoming frosh are
not branded with the traditional
frosh dink is a tradition and an ex
ample of the Farm democracy in
itself. From this democratic spirit
sprang the "hello tradition"â€”the
custom of greeting all passersby on
the Quad. It was Mrs. Stanford's
wish that there be no smoking on
the Quad and no playing of pool or
billiards on Sundays. Her wish has
become a school resolution, and is i
obeyed.
Many Stanford traditions center
about Big Game week activities, all !
part of the friendly and not so j
friendly rivalry which has existed !
for many years between Stanford j
and the University of California.
Giving, another Stanford tradition,
has grown rapidly through the suc
cess of the many activities connected !
with Ihe Convalescent Home Drive, !
particularly the Masque 8.-ill, Labor |
Day, the Sophomore Carnival, and i
(he Junior Water Carnival.
The custom of giving rides to and
from Palo Alto is a tradition of con
venience. Diagonally across from
history corner and at the station j
corner in Palo Alto car-less men |
and women wait for rides to or from |
the campus. Tradition rules that the |
riding aid the unfortunates.
