# Thornhill Sees Indian Hopes Climb
## Templeton Given Leave; Winkleman Relinquishes Varsiy Coaching Job Bones Hamilton, Hoos to Assist Thornhill; New Track Mentor Appointment Still Unannounced 
### 
R. L. "Dink" Templeton, for 18 years Stanford's head track and field
coach, will not coach the Indian cinder squad in 1940.
Templeton was granted a year's leave of absence late in the summer
quarter. No official word has been given regarding his return in 1941,
although he took a similar leave to regain his health several years ago and

then came back again to put the<
Stanford thin-clads at the top of the
international track heap.
Rumors have been persistent
throughout the summer that Tem
pleton might definitely resign in fa
vor of a writing career. Charley
Paddock, the once fastest human
now associated with a publishing
group in Long Beach, had purport
edly offered Templeton a lucrative
editorial position. Since his tempo
rary departure from collegiate
coaching ranks, however, Templeton
has made no announcements as to
his immediate future.
Only a few days after granting
Templeton's leave of absence, the
Board of Athletic Control announced
that a similar leave had been given
1o Ben Winkleman, associate direc
tor of physical education and as
sistant football coach for three years.
His failure to return, coupled with
the resignation of Backfield Coach
Bobby Grayson last spring, leaves
the gx*id staff at eight men. This
crew must supervise both freshman
and varsity work-outs. Claude
"Tiny" Thornhill, head coach, may
juggle his staff as he sees fit, but
present indications are that they will
line up something like this:
Thornhill, Jim Lawson, Ernest j
"Husky" Hunt, and Earl Hoos, In
dian quarterback and captain in 1936,
will handle the varsity. Harry Ship- !
coach of last year's undefeated |
freshman outfit, will retain that po- j
sition with Bill Paulman and Louis j
Tsoutsouvas as his underlings.
HAMILTON TO COACH
"Bones" Hamilton, blocking half- j
back and all-American ace during |
his "Vow Boy" playing days, will i
act as varsity backfield coach. He j
held a similar post with the frosh |
last fall. His work as alumni secre
tary will undoubtedly curtail the [
time he will be able to spend with '
the two squads.
No successor has been officially i
mentioned for Templeton's position j
despite the fact that the list of 1
available candidates seems to have >
been cut to three young aspirants.
At any rate the successful contender i
will be signed for only one season, I
pending further action on Temple- !
ton's status.
"DINK'S" CAREER
The "Dink" was a Stanford grad- j
nate of the class of 1921 and almost j
instantly fame as the "Boy j
Coach" when he joined the Indian
coaching staff as an assistant direc- j
tor. As an undergraduate, he was |
said to have been the greatest kicker
in the history of western rugby '
football and was a champion high !
jumper and broad jumper despite j
his diminutive stature.
Winkleman came to Stanford in ,
the fall of 1936 after a successful
high school coaching career in Ar- !
kansas. He received his bachelor's;
decree- from University of Arkansas j
in 1922 and first impressed the Stan
ford football moguls with his analy- j
tical scouting reports on Southern j
Methodist University prior to the
1936 Rose Bowl game.
