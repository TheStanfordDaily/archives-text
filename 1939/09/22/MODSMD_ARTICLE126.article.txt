# Northwestern Ace Sits on Bench
## 
### 
Bill deCorrevont, Northwestern's
highly publicized sophomore half
back, will start his collegiate career
as a substitute.
espite the fact that the young Chi
cago ace scored 211 points in his sen
ior year in high school and showed
promise as a college freshman, his
abilities are still limited. He thus
has been essentially a ball carrier
and has been said to lack finesse as
a blocker, tackier, and kicker.
deCorrevont, however, didn't get
offers from over 70 colleges simply
because grid scouts had read about
him in the papers. His coaches and
other experts predict that he will
blossom forth as an ail-American as
a junior and may possibly be greater
than "Red" Grange as a senior.
