# Polo Chances Bright Despite Varsity Losses
## Returning Veterans Swell Posts Vacated By Lamb, Rothschild 
### 
To lose two all-conference play
ers would seem quite a blow to the
average water-polo team, yet Coach
Nort Thornton of Stanford isn't wor
rying about such a loss.
Despite the fact that John Lamb
and Harvey Rothschild, all-confer
ence forwards last year, according to
the choice of rival mentors, have
gone the sheepskin way, three sec
ond-string all-stars will find their
way back with a host of other vet
erans which makes this yeai-'s Stan
ford water polo picture extremely
bright.
Forward Bob Plate, captain this
year, Ted Moreno, forward, Roy
Vitousek, goalie, and Dick Hoover,
guard, are the honor packcrs.
HOOVER INELIGIBLE
A question mark presently looms
over the head of Hoover, who has
five units of incomplete grades to
make up before he will be eligible.
Coach Thornton considers him an
important cog in the offensive
strength of the squad.
The second-string all-conference
players are only a part of the ex
perience on hand, which include
many outstanding members of last
year's frosh squad.
Frank Downing, who was more
than threatening the first-string
berth of Vitousek at the close of last
season in the game with California,
will also be on hand. To make the
competition for the goalie stop espe
cially tough, Bob Burns, who was
first string two years ago when Vit
ousek was but m freshman, will also
be on hand after an absence. The
frosh also bring up two goalies who
spent a good deal of time in the
splash of things, Bill Ernst and Ed
Smith. Lloyd Wilson, third string
last season, will be back for one
more try.
FORWARD REPLACEMENTS
Probable first-string man, a sub
stitute for graduated Jack Loupe, i
the only member of the team who
didn't gain all-conference honors
last season, will be Dave Nottage,
forward. Bob Allen, ineligible last
year, comes back to try to regain his
first-string spot of two years ago.
Deemed outstanding frosh grad
uates, Hadley Bacon, forward, Fred
Manwaring, forward, and Duncan
Patty, centerback, who may be one i
of Stanford's all-time greats in the j
ducking pastime, will be set to give I
the varsity vets lots of trouble.
Scott Dudley, national freshman I
intercollegiate breaststroke cham- I
pion and record holder, and captain I
of last year's freshman poloists, has j
been bothered by a sinus infection j
