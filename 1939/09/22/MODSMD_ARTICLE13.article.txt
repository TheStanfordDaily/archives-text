# Jolly-Up Heads Pre-Reg Period
## Barbecue Scheduled Sunday; Band to Play 
### 
With the emphasis of' Stanford's
Pre-Reg period definitely pointed to
ward fostering friendship among the
entire freshman class, the Pre-Reg
committee has outlined plans for an
exclusively frosh Jolly-up and Sun
day evening barbecue.
The Jolly-up as a Stanford tradi
tion will be introduced to the Class
of '43 on Saturday evening from
9:30 to 11:30 o'clock in the Women's
Gym. It will be a no-date affair,
open only to incoming freshmen
with no second or third quarter
frosh being admitted. Les Smith
and his orchestra have been engaged
for the dance.
Name tags will be worn by frosh
throughout the evening and cutting
in will be in order. Other methods
of mixing the dancers will be used
by the committee. Johnny Seamans,
head yell leader, will act as master
of ceremonies and chief dance
caller.
Roble doors will close promptly at
12 midnight, one-half hour after the
Jolly-up.
BARBECUE PLANNED
Frosh will trek up behind the
Campus to the famed Stanford Hill
on Sunday afternon at 4:30 o'clock
for a hot supper of barbecued meat,
beans, salad, and ice cream, pre
pared under the personal supervi
sion of Sam Mac Donald, veteran
Farm barbecue artist, assisted by the
Encina kitchen staff.
It will be in this informal atmos
phere of rolling hills and venerable
oak trees that the new freshman
class will have its first opportunity
to hear Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President of the University.
Wishing to adhere to past Stanford
tradition, Dr. Wilbur this year ex
pressed a desire to withhold his
speech of welcome to the new class
until the barbecue, instead of giving
it at the assembly in Memorial
Theater.
BAND TO PERFORM
Far from being entirely on the
serious side, the program will be
livened by tunes from the Stanford
Band and by yells and songs led by
Johnny Seamans, head yell leader.
Under New Pugh, general Pre-
Registration chairman, committees
in charge of the Jolly-up and barbe
cue are as follows:
Jolly-up chairmap, Barney Fergu
son; assistants, Stan Glikbarg, Anne
Townsend, Sherman Mellinkoff, Sue
Atkinson, and all Encina and Roble
sponsors.
Barbecue chairman, Stan Swaf
ford; assistants, John Alltucker, Art
Gore, Mary Beach, Hugh O'Donnell,
Lois Whitmore, and John Avery.

Atkinson, and all Encina and Roble
sponsors.

With the emphasis of' Stanford's
Pre-Reg period definitely pointed to
ward fostering friendship among the
entire freshman class, the Pre-Reg
committee has outlined plans for an
exclusively frosh Jolly-up and Sun
day evening barbecue.
The Jolly-up as a Stanford tradi
tion will be introduced to the Class
of '43 on Saturday evening from
9:30 to 11:30 o'clock in the Women's
Gym. It will be a no-date affair,
open only to incoming freshmen
with no second or third quarter
frosh being admitted. Les Smith
and his orchestra have been engaged
for the dance.
Name tags will be worn by frosh
throughout the evening and cutting
in will be in order. Other methods
of mixing the dancers will be used
by the committee. Johnny Seamans,
head yell leader, will act as master
of ceremonies and chief dance
caller.
Roble doors will close promptly at
12 midnight, one-half hour after the
Jolly-up.
BARBECUE PLANNED
Frosh will trek up behind the
Campus to the famed Stanford Hill
on Sunday afternon at 4:30 o'clock
for a hot supper of barbecued meat,
beans, salad, and ice cream, pre
pared under the personal supervi
sion of Sam Mac Donald, veteran
Farm barbecue artist, assisted by the
Encina kitchen staff.
It will be in this informal atmos
phere of rolling hills and venerable
oak trees that the new freshman
class will have its first opportunity
to hear Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President of the University.
Wishing to adhere to past Stanford
tradition, Dr. Wilbur this year ex
pressed a desire to withhold his
speech of welcome to the new class
until the barbecue, instead of giving
it at the assembly in Memorial
Theater.
BAND TO PERFORM
Far from being entirely on the
serious side, the program will be
livened by tunes from the Stanford
Band and by yells and songs led by
Johnny Seamans, head yell leader.
Under New Pugh, general Pre-
Registration chairman, committees
in charge of the Jolly-up and barbe
