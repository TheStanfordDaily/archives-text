fielder, and Hal Costello, all-confer
ence first baseman, lead a group of
horsehiders.
Pfyl led Coach Lee Bissett's
Matean nine in hitting, and both
Cereghino and Costello have had

TRACK STARS
Three tracksters will definitely en
list here. All are middle-distance
men of nearly the same caliber —
Barman Skrable, Blair Hyde, and
Jack Moore.
Hyde opened the eyes of collegiate
coaches by tearing off a new na
tional junior college half-mile rec
ord of 1:53.4 in the national jaysee
meet at Sacramento. However, he

Skrable.

Moore, former California Inter
scholastic Federation champion, fin
ished ahead in the mile run and was
second best at twice that distance.
Coach Nort Thornton's swimming
prospects from the Class of '43 are
still rather indefinite, but three
promising high school stars are defi
nitely in line for berths on the frosh
swim squad.

Cereghino and Costello have had
outside experience.
TRACK STARS
Three tracksters will definitely en
list here. All are middle-distance
men of nearly the same caliber —
Barman Skrable, Blair Hyde, and
Jack Moore.
Hyde opened the eyes of collegiate
coaches by tearing off a new na
tional junior college half-mile rec
ord of 1:53.4 in the national jaysee
meet at Sacramento. However, he
was only a step ahead of his mate,
Skrable.

Moore, former California Inter
scholastic Federation champion, fin
ished ahead in the mile run and was
second best at twice that distance.
Coach Nort Thornton's swimming
prospects from the Class of '43 are
still rather indefinite, but three
promising high school stars are defi
nitely in line for berths on the frosh
swim squad.
TANKMEN

the local prep study mart at Paly
comes Don Smith. Peninsula Athletic
League and Northern California high
school 100- and 220-free style champ.
So far Don's best times are :56.4 and
2:24.5 for the two events.
Woodrow Wilson High School in
Long Beach sends its Southern Cali
fornia champion high school back
