# Ruling Changes Knockout Time
## 
### 
A situation that has long puzzled
keepers of fistic records and those
who like to make a small wager on
the outcome of a prize fight has
been cleared up by delegates to the
annual convention in Washington of
the National Boxing Association.
The ruling affected was one deal
ing with the official number of
rounds of a fight in which one fighter
is unable to answer the bell after
the one minute rest allowed between
cantos. The decision handed down
was that the losing boxer should be
considered knocked out in the round
following the rest period.
