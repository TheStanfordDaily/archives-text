# Seventeen Lettermen Return to Bolster Squad
## Shift of Santa Clara Game Gives Cards Early-Season Break; Standlee, Albert Slated to Star 
### 
"They never come back" is a far-flung: adage applied lo disposed cham
pions (hat Coach Claude E. "Tiny" Thornhill and the Stanford grid squad
are going to attempt to disprove this season.
Football—in the win and lose column—hasn't been the same since the
departure of the famed Vow Boys of 1933-35, but with 17 returning letter-

► men, prospects on the Farm look
reasonably bright for a much more
successful season than 1938 when
the Cards slipped to seventh place in
the conference standings with only
two victories against five defeats.
BRO.NC GAME
One disastrous aspect of 1938 has
been removed from this year's
schedule, however, when Santa Clara
was changed from the season's
opening game to a less obtrusive
midseason date. For three years the
Cards have been opening the season
with strong Bronco elevens and have
been decisively trounced. The psy
chological reaction is obvious—it al
ways took the Cards several weeks
to rally from those defeats to hit
their stride.
This year the Cards open the
season Sept. 30 against the powerful
Oregon State Beavers in the Stan
ford Stadium.
BACKFIELD STRONG
Thornhill readily admits that he
has some classy backfield material,
despite the loss of Pete Fay, who
decided to do some broken field
running in the business world in
stead of taking his last year of grid
eligibility. Fay was expected to al
ternate with Frankie Albert, sensa
tion of last year's undefeated frosh
squad, but now the offensive burden
of the left half spot is thrown on the
latter's shoulders. Two good men
are better than one, but Albert by
himself is a tiny load of triple-threat
dynamite. And the fact he's a
southpaw doesn't make it any easier
for the enemy to figure him out.
The rest of the first-string back
field, as things stand at the moment,
includes Gene Coldiron, quarter;
Jim Groves, right half; and Nonn
Standlee, full. Coldiron spelled the
graduated Bill Paulman for two
years and is capable of moving into
the starting berth. He's plenty
tough, knows how to block and
tackle.
GROVES RETURNS
Groves, first-string fullback in
1937, comes back after being out. for
a year with a shoulder injury. In
spring practice his vicious blocking
was outstanding and he's also a
powerful straight-ahead ballpacker.
In '37 he did all the kicking and
passing for the team also.
Standlee, hampered by an ankle
injury most of last season, didn't
really hit his form until the last two
games, when he powered his way
through the Cal and Dartmouth lines
like a guy named Grayson who used
to fool around with football on the
Farm.
The second-string backfield is
long on talent, but short on expe
rience. Hugh Gallarneau is pressing
Groves to win back the right half
back jjost that was regularly his lasl
year, while Rod Parker played
enough minutes last year to win a
stripe at fullback.
However, Bob Crane at quarter
back, guard on last year's frosh,
arid Moon Mullin, Albert's sub at
left half, are both inexperienced.
Mullin was on the squad last year
but didn't play, developing into a
