# Oregon State Has Light Grid Team
## 
### 
The Oregon State eleven which >
will open the season against Tiny
Thomhill's Indians won't be the
heaviest team in the country by a
long way, if the released weights are
accurate.
Of the 45 players listed in the pre
season roster, only half a dozen
weigh over 200 pounds. One of these
is John Tsoutsouvas, brother of
Louis Tsoutsouvas, former Cardinal
j.'reat who is now assisting Harry j
Shipkey with the Stanford frosh
eleven.
