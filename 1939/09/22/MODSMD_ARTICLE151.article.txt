# Assistant Coach
## Boxing Team Shy In Light Weights 
### 
Boxing Coach Clayton Frye is
sending out an urgent SOS call for
light weight boxers to fill several
vacant posts in the midget divisions
of his varsity boxing squad.
Several veteran mittmen are slat
ed to return for the heavier divi
sions, but a scarcity of bantam and
featherweight fighters may put a
crimp in the team's success story
this winter. The middleweight class
is also shy of capable men.
Regular physical education classes
will be given by Coach Frye autumn
quarter in both beginning and ad
vanced boxing technique. These are
not only for prospective varsity can
didates, men just wishing to learn
something of the art of self defense
are also advised to enroll.
