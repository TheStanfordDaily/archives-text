# Varsity Batmen Lose Two Stars
## 
### 
All but two of last years regu
lar members of Harry Wolter's base
ball aggregation are expected to put
in an appearance when the card
diamondmen go to work in earnest
next spring. A 1 Lazzarone, co-cap
tain last spring and almost one-half
the pitching staff, has graduated, and
Bill "Smoke" Clark, hard-hitting
outfielder, ran into scholastic diffi
culties that will probably keep him
out of action.
Captain Bill Jameson will, barring
unforeseen accidents, lead a nine
onto the field next spring that can
have veterans at every position.
Quentin "Cootie" Thompson will re
turn as mainstay of the mound corps,
to be assisted by Gil Rahn and
Claude Purkett.
Practice for varsity and freshman
baseball players will be held three
aftsrnoons a week during fall quar
ter. Intensive practice will probably
not begin until after Christmas vaca
tion.
