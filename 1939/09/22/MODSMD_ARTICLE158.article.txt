# ORR MADE ELIGIBLE
## 
### 
Lee Orr, rated as the one Coast
sprinter able to beat Stanford's
Clyde Jeffrey last year, was injured
before the Indian meet and lost
nearly a full year of eligibility. Be
cause this injury kept him out of all
but one meet last year, he was
granted another year's eligibility the
same day Stanford's Hamp Pool was
saved for another year.
