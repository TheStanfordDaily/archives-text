# Stickum to Reduce Illinois Fumbles
## 
### 
If University of Illinois gridders
are guilty of frequent fumbles this
season it won't be the fault of their
jersies, which are constructed with
strips of "stickum" cloth sewn on
them to aid in eliminating the fum
ble evil.
Each jersey of the traditional
Illini blue has four stripes of the
"stickum" cloth down the front,
with a square patch of the material
under each arm.
