DOERING MISSES
Art Doering, who qualified as the
San Francisco representative to the
National Open, was eliminated after
the second round along with Law
son Little, another former Stanford-
He.
Many of Coach Eddie Twiggs
stars and former players were re
united at the California Amateur
Championship at Del Monte in early
September. Although Jack Gage of
Santa Barbara won the title, some of
the Stanford golfers made a good
showing. Among the Farm entries
were Finger, Berl, Kennedy, Bill
Brigham, Chick Hines, Hal Stone,
Bob Thompson, Malcolm MeNaugh
ton, Frank Tatum, Guy Showley,
«md Stuart Hawley.
Art Doering, who was the third
lowest qualifier in the country for
the National Amateur championship,
has been joined by Warren Berl and
alums Bob Roos and Jack Horner
in that tourney.
