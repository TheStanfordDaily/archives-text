# Stanford, Ca! Physicists Measure Neutron Strength
## 
### 
Stanford and University of California physicists today announced that a
co-operative research carried on at Berkeley with the help of the Univer
sity of California's huge cyclotron has yielded a new measure of funda
mental importance in nuclear physicsâ€”the magnetic strength of the neu
tron.
According to information received from Professor Luis W. Alvarez of

California and Stanford's Professor,
Felix Bloch who carried out the
neutron experiments this summer,
the research represents the first di
rect experimental measurement of
the neutron's infinitesimal magnetic
strength or "moment." The value
found, although miniscule, is accu
rate to within one per cent.
RECENTLY DISCOVERED
Neutrons, the existence of which
was discovered only a few years
ago, are the smallest neutral particles
known. They carry no electrical
charge, and together with protons
they form the fundamental build
ing stones of all matter, constitut
ing the nucleus of every atom. In
the Berkeley experiment, neutrons
were shot through two-inch plates
of solid steel.
Although the "magnetic scatter
ing" of neutrons has been verified
in laboratories at Cornell, Columbia,
and Copenhagen, their precise
strength was not known until Pro
fessors Bloch and Alvarez completed
their experiments in the California
radiation laboratory this summer.
NEUTRONS POLARIZED
Such measurement, reported Pro
fessor Bloch, was made possible
through the use of the cyclotron, a
neutrons by bombarding a plate of
machine which produces streams of
beryllium with heavy hydrogen
atoms. By directing a stream of
neutrons between two magnetized
|ron plates, the professors obtained
somewhat orderly lines of neutrons
parallel to the polarized plates, thus
becoming polarized as light may be
polarized.
To measure the strength of the
neutron magnets, the professors
caused the neutrons to turn "som
ersaults" in an oscillating radio field,
during which time it became possible
to determine the precise condition
of minimum passage of these neu
trons. These figures, given the os
cillation frequency conditions, en
abled the professors to determine
the strength of the neutron mag
net.
