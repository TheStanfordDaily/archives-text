# Trojans Picked to Capture Conference Grid Pennant
## Coast Teams Foresee Struggle 'Keeping Up with the Joneses' 
### 
U.S.C. against the Coast!
That's the way this year's Pacific
j Coast Conference race shapes up
[ with Coach Howard Harding Jones
welcoming 2J lettermen back to the
I fold. The Trojans have at least, one
| letterman at every position except
j right half, and they are two and
j three deep in most of the spots.
Hairy Smith, all-American guard,
I and four outstanding ends will lead
i the Trojan line into action. In fact,
I the flankmen are so good that A 1
Krueger, the hoy whose great pass
catching beat Duke in the Rose Bowl.
| will probably start the season on the
! second string.
TROY'S BACKFIKI,D
In the Trojan backfield, things are
! looking so bright that the captain of
I the team, Joe Shell, will be under
| studying Bob Hoffman, who is one
of the most powerful blockers on the
i Coast. At quarterback, the main
I ball-carrying position, Jones will
I have two barrels of dynamite in
' Grenville Lansdell and Ambrose
Schindler. Lansdell sparked the of-
I fense last year, while Schindler, a
two-year letterman, was held out
j last season because of injuries.
Schindler may be shifted to fullback
to make room for both triple-threat
men in the same backfield.
After S.C. there is no positive
| standout, with California, Stanford,
j Oregon, Oregon State, and Wash
j ington appearing about even on pa-
I per. Stub Allison's Golden Bears
! dropped but one game last year—
| that to the Trojans—but Vic Bottari
is gone, along with Tackle Dave De
j Varona, and both will be tough to
I replace.
CAL lIOI'ES
Tony Firpo, called the Wild Bull
of the Campus around the Campa
! Nile, will attempt to lill Bottari's
I shoes, but that's a tough assignment
| for any man. Louie Smith, 6 ft. 4 in.
j halfback who boots 'em far and
1 high, is expected to do great things
opposite Firpo, but a lot of power
was lost to the Bear backfield when
Fred Anderson's leg was crushed
j under a load of machinery last sum
: mer, ending his football career.
The Bear line is an unknown
quantity, but if some of last year's
I gigantic frosh forwards come
| through, Allison may field a sur-
I prising, team.
Up in Oregon are a couple of dark
1 horse teams that are quite likely to
j turn this year's race upside down.
I Tex Oliver goes into his second year
at Oregon with his system more
firmly established and three prospec
! tive all-Coast performers on his
roster. Frank Emmons, a fast-mov
ing 215-pound fullback; Vic Regi
nato, a pass-nabbing end; and Jim
Stuart, a bruising 225-pound tackle,
5 are the Webfoots' candidates for
! honors, while Jim Cadenasso is a
' ranking center.

1 Coach Eon Stiner isn't saying i
much up at Oregon State but he has
the best material the northern school
| has seen since 1933. And that mate
| rial isn't just good—it's big. Take,
j for example, Eberle Schultz, (i ft., 5
i in., 225-pound guard. The only wor
ry the Beavers seem to have is
! whe her their ends will hold up; if
; they do, watch out!
HAIll) LUCK SQUAI)
Hard luck team of the league is
Washington, where Coach Jimmy
: Phelan always has a good team, sel-
I dom a good season. Last year the
Huskies were picked as co-favorites
for the championship, and then pro
ceeded to lose four of their first five
j games and tie the other. They
; snapped out of the rut finally,
j trouncing Stanford and U.S.C. on
j successive week-ends, the latter be
j ing S.C.'s only conference defeat of
i the season.
The entire first-string backfield of
1938 graduated along with two
corking guards, Steve Slivinski and
Art Means, but Phelan's substitute
backfield returns intact and that was
| the quartet that carried the burden
I the day the Huskies stopped the
j Trojans.
lIORRELL STEPS IN
U.C.L.A., with the only new coach
in the conference this year. Babe
Horrell, expects to have the finest
backfield on the Coast, but a weak
! line should keep the Bruins from
achieving great heights.
Jackie Robinson, who scintillated
: for Pasadena Junior College in foot
ball. basketball, baseball, and track,
holding the national junior college
broad jump record in the latter
sport, is expected to team with Ken
■ny Washington, another splendid
j negro halfback, and give the Bruins
j a pair of offensive aces who are
j touchdown threats from any place
I on the field.
WEAK LINE
But John Frawley and Jack Som
mers, whom Horrell predicts will be
the best guard combination on the
coast, provide U.C.L.A.'s only meas
ure of brililance in the line.
Last year Washington State slip
ped into the cellar of the conference
! for the first time in 13 years "Babe"
i Hollingbery has coached there.
I However, Hollingbery has only five
( regulars returning from the 1938
team which did not win a league
1 game and prospects of the Cougars
moving out of the cellar this year
seem slight.
