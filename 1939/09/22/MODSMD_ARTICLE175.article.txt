# Two Cards Play On Detroit Team
## 
### 
Only two ex-Stanford gridders are
playing professional football this
year, Tony Calvelli, center on last
year's team, and Jim "Monk" Mos
year, Tony Calvelli, center on last
crip, ail-American end with the
Vowing Sophs. Both are playing for
the Detroit Lions.
Ernie Nevers, brightest backfield
star in Stanford history and one of
the greatest the game has ever seen,
is coaching the Chicago Cardinals.
Three former Card gridders have
given up the play-for-pay sport this
year, Ernie Caddel, half, and Bob
"Horse" Reynolds, tackle, for De
troit; and Louis Tsoutsouvas, Pitts
burgh center.
