### JERRY MAYER 
Exactly one year ago the banner
line of the Stanford Daily sports
section blasted forth the startling
declaration — CARD GRIDDERS
BEST SINCE 'VOW BOYS.'
But Stanford won only three of
its nine games, finished in seventh
place in conference standings, and
Tiny Thornhill had to tight off the
wolves who were hollering for his
scalp.
Every person who followed
Stanford last year knew the rea
son for its collapse—an almost un
believable number of injuries to
key men, a terrible massacre at
the hands of a well-drilled Santa
Clara eleven in the first game
which handicapped the team's
mental attitude for several weeks,
bad breaks.
But there was another angle (o
the situation that was pretty gen
erally overlooked — over-enthus
iasm in the students built up by
the glowing write-ups in (he city
papers as well as the Daily. The
stuc&4ts. were expecting great
things and when the Cards started
in reverse and kept stumbling
there could be put one possible
reaction—dissatisfaction.
But when we look back we sec
things in their true perspective. The
Cards should not have been hailed
as pennant contenders, especially off
their opening season line-up. The
guards were woefully weak and
didn't become strong until Corky
Donahue and Hamp Pool were shift
ed from other positions. And even
then it took Donahue and Pool time
to get used to their new assign
ments.
At one end was a player who had
knocked at all-American honors two

seasons before but had been out of
action for a whole year nursing an
injured foot back to health; at the
other end was a player who had
seen little action during the '37
schedule.
An untried sophomore was at
quarterback, while at right half was
a boy who had played frosh football
two seasons previous and then had
n't touched a football for a whole
year.
The whole team as well as the
coach was put on the spot by the
glowing early-season publicity.
So this year the banner 011 the
sports page reads — THORNHILL
SEES GRID HOPES CLIMB.
That's not over-optimism, Stan
ford certainly should climb out of
seventh place, but we're not go
ing to put Tiny on the spot pre
dicting great tilings for his ball
club until we are thoroughly con
vinced they are going to do great
tilings. On the other hand, there's
no use trying to kid anyone, if the
team just hasn't got it we're going
to tell you. That way maybe we
can save Ihe overzcalous Stan
ford fan some embarrassment, as
well as give Tiny a break. Its
easy to imagine how lie felt when
the papers predicted a wonderful
season when Tiny must have
known that the team didn't meas
ure to the praise. lie must have
foreseen the handwriting on the
wall.
So that's our policy this volume,
in a word, HONESTY—honesty to
the team, to Tiny, and to the stu
dents.
But as long as they stay in there
I pitching, the Daily stays behind
I Stanford—win, lose, or draw.

Exactly one year ago the banner
line of the Stanford Daily sports
section blasted forth the startling
declaration — CARD GRIDDERS
BEST SINCE 'VOW BOYS.'
But Stanford won only three of
its nine games, finished in seventh
place in conference standings, and
Tiny Thornhill had to tight off the
wolves who were hollering for his
scalp.
Every person who followed
Stanford last year knew the rea
son for its collapse—an almost un
believable number of injuries to
key men, a terrible massacre at
the hands of a well-drilled Santa
Clara eleven in the first game
which handicapped the team's
mental attitude for several weeks,
bad breaks.
But there was another angle (o
the situation that was pretty gen
erally overlooked — over-enthus
iasm in the students built up by
the glowing write-ups in (he city
papers as well as the Daily. The
stuc&4ts. were expecting great
things and when the Cards started
in reverse and kept stumbling
there could be put one possible
reaction—dissatisfaction.
But when we look back we sec
things in their true perspective. The
Cards should not have been hailed
as pennant contenders, especially off
their opening season line-up. The
guards were woefully weak and
didn't become strong until Corky
Donahue and Hamp Pool were shift
ed from other positions. And even
then it took Donahue and Pool time
to get used to their new assign
ments.
At one end was a player who had
knocked at all-American honors two

seasons before but had been out of
action for a whole year nursing an
injured foot back to health; at the
other end was a player who had
seen little action during the '37
schedule.
An untried sophomore was at
quarterback, while at right half was
a boy who had played frosh football
two seasons previous and then had
n't touched a football for a whole
year.
The whole team as well as the
coach was put on the spot by the
glowing early-season publicity.
So this year the banner 011 the
sports page reads — THORNHILL
SEES GRID HOPES CLIMB.
That's not over-optimism, Stan
ford certainly should climb out of
seventh place, but we're not go
ing to put Tiny on the spot pre
dicting great tilings for his ball
club until we are thoroughly con
vinced they are going to do great
tilings. On the other hand, there's
no use trying to kid anyone, if the
team just hasn't got it we're going
to tell you. That way maybe we
can save Ihe overzcalous Stan
ford fan some embarrassment, as
well as give Tiny a break. Its
easy to imagine how lie felt when
the papers predicted a wonderful
season when Tiny must have
known that the team didn't meas
ure to the praise. lie must have
foreseen the handwriting on the
wall.
So that's our policy this volume,
in a word, HONESTY—honesty to
the team, to Tiny, and to the stu
dents.
But as long as they stay in there
I pitching, the Daily stays behind
I Stanford—win, lose, or draw.
