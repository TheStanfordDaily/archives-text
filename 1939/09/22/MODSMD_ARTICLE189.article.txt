# Gael Uniforms Eliminate Sleeves
## 
### 
Slip Madigan, builder of those St.
Mary's ''dream teams" that some
times turn into October nightmares,
isn't satisfied wtih having his foot
ball team dressed in the most col
orful uniforms in the country.
Madigan. who astounded the East
Coast when his eleven, fulfilling
their annual date with Fordham, ap
peared on the field in blue and white
jerseys and violent pink pants, has
announced his intention of letting
the Gaels face their foes this fall
in jerseys sans sleeves. According to
Slip, the display of brawny fore
arms is calculated to draw more
feminine customers when the Madi
gans play.
