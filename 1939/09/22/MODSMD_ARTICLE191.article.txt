# Frosh Tankmen Lost to '40 Varsity Squad
## Herron, Adams Leave School; Other Stars Raise Card Hopes 
### 
Shocked by the news that Paul i
Herron and Howard Adams, who
between them formed a major part
of the greatest freshman swimming 1
team in America last year, will not
return to school for varsity compe
tition, Coach Noli. Thornton was to
day faced by a black question mark
for the coming dive and splash
season.
Herron, who was capable of swim
ming and winning any event on the
program, and who held five national
intercollegiate freshman records by
himself, will not be back this year.
Adams, Far Western diving cham
pion, considered a cinch to cop con
ference springboard honors, has
decided to forsake school for a job
a year, after which he claims he
will again climb into a Cardinal suit.
OTHERS BOLSTER HOPES
Scott Dudley, the nation's num- I
ber one freshman breast stroker,
will probably be on hand, despite
the fact that he has been bothered
by sinus trouble, the Waterloo of
many mermen.
Gardner Miller, sprinter, who may
change to the 220- and 440-yard
events, moves up from the frosh.
The same for Brad Young, free
style sprinter and relay man.
Hadley Bacon, all-around man,
will come in handy as a fill-in for
any vacant spots. He can handle all
strokes with a degree of familiarity.
Jim Canning, baekstroker, whose
time of 1:47.5 against California frosh
last year was good enough for third
in the varsity conference meet, will
be better than California's best.
RETURNING VETS
However, still champion of this
spot, Bill Weeden, conference cham
pion who suffered but one setback
last year, will still rule the roost.
He is but a junior.
Another junior, Roy Vitousek,
who was good enough to win the 50-
and 100-yard freestyle events and
the 200-yard breaststroke race in
the Big Meet, returns.
However, a man who may possibly
over-shadow Vitousek is Pete Oku
moto, intramural champion. Oku
moto, a transfer from Hawaii, won
twice in the intramural meet, both
his winning times being better than
Vitousek could handle in the free
style events.

between them formed a major part
of the greatest freshman swimming 1
team in America last year, will not
return to school for varsity compe
tition, Coach Noli. Thornton was to
day faced by a black question mark
for the coming dive and splash
season.
Herron, who was capable of swim
ming and winning any event on the
program, and who held five national
intercollegiate freshman records by
himself, will not be back this year.
Adams, Far Western diving cham
pion, considered a cinch to cop con
ference springboard honors, has
decided to forsake school for a job
a year, after which he claims he
will again climb into a Cardinal suit.
OTHERS BOLSTER HOPES
Scott Dudley, the nation's num- I
ber one freshman breast stroker,
will probably be on hand, despite
the fact that he has been bothered
by sinus trouble, the Waterloo of
many mermen.
Gardner Miller, sprinter, who may
change to the 220- and 440-yard
events, moves up from the frosh.
The same for Brad Young, free
style sprinter and relay man.
Hadley Bacon, all-around man,
will come in handy as a fill-in for
any vacant spots. He can handle all
strokes with a degree of familiarity.
Jim Canning, baekstroker, whose
time of 1:47.5 against California frosh
last year was good enough for third
in the varsity conference meet, will
be better than California's best.
RETURNING VETS
However, still champion of this
spot, Bill Weeden, conference cham
pion who suffered but one setback
last year, will still rule the roost.
He is but a junior.
Another junior, Roy Vitousek,
who was good enough to win the 50-
and 100-yard freestyle events and
the 200-yard breaststroke race in
the Big Meet, returns.
However, a man who may possibly
over-shadow Vitousek is Pete Oku
moto, intramural champion. Oku
moto, a transfer from Hawaii, won
twice in the intramural meet, both
his winning times being better than
Vitousek could handle in the free
style events.
