### 
The spirit of Stanford's famed
Laughing Boys will again haunt the
basketball courts of the nation this
winter when three ihembers of the
former coast and national champion
ship Card quintet, led by Hank
Luisetti, band together in the colors
of the Jimmy Baxter All-Stars.
In addition to Luisetti, acclaimed
from coast to coast as one of the
greatest players of all time, Art
Stoeffen and Phil Zonne, his team
mates on the '38-'39 team that won
the Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship, will perform for the All-
Stars.
Other former greats who will
round out the team are Eddie Oram,
U.S.C.; Vide Christie, Loyola; Milt
Berg, Arizona; and Jack Hupp,
U.S.C.
The team expects to open its sea
son in Los Angeles, possibly against
U.S.C., and will play in Southern
California for several months before
starting on a national tour through
the Middle West and East, with a
wind-up in Madison Square Garden.
