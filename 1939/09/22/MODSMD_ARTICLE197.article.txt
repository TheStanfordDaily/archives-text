# Cincy Manager Predicts Club Win
## 
### 
Bill McKechnie, foxy manager of
the Cincinnati Reds, still leading the
National League in spite of a re
cent slump, finally predicted that his
club would nab the pennant in the
home stretch drive .
McKechnie, who wouldn't talk
i during the spring training season
| and was reticent all during the pen
i nant chase about his team's chances.
Now, with less than 30 games re
maining on the schedule, 23 of
which will be on the Reds' home
grounds, McKechnie, whose nine
holds a 31/2-game lead over the sec
ond place St. Louis Cards, has
broken his long period of skeptical
silence by saying, "I believe we'll
win by six games or more."
