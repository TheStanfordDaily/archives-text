# Santa Clara Loses Varsity Stars
## 
### 
Coach Buck Shaw will lead his
Santa Clara Broncos into a tough
nine-game schedule for 1939 minus
eleven 1938 veterans who had earned
two or more football letters.
Absent from the Bronco roster thi>-
year will be the names of such stars
as Jim Barlow, Bruno Pellegrini, Al
Wolff, and Jim Coughlan, who were
in a large part responsible for the
almost perfect record of Shaw
coached teams of 23 wins and three
losses in three years.
