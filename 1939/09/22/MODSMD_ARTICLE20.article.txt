## Stanford to Offer Civilian Air Training 
### 
Word received from the Civil
Aeronautics Authority this week in
formed University officials that
Stanford has been selected as one
of the many colleges and institu
tions to l'eceive government aid and
equipment as a part of a national
plan to add 11,000 new civilian pilots
to the list of qualified U.S. aviators.
As a participant of the civilian air
training program, Stanford will carry
on flight instruction for the school
at the Palo Alto Alto Airport. Mem
bers of the faculty connected with
aeronautics will teach ground in
struction, which must commence
early in October and cover 72 hours
of instruction before the end of win
ter quarter, according to air school
regulations.
Despite heavy demands for planes
due to the government's civilian
flying program, six new two-place
training planes have already arrived
at the airport from Lockhaven, Conn.
These craft augment the equipment
already owned by the Palo Alto Air
port Inc., and at least one instructor
and another mechanic will be added
to the teaching staff which has three
instructors at present.
Interested in the civilian training
course, and known to be capable of
teaching the required ground courses
are Professor A. B. Domonoske of
the engineering department at Stan
ford, Professor Norris E. Bradbury,
member of the physics department
faculty, and Professor David L. Web
ster, also of the physics department,
who put in a strong bid for the proj
ect at Stanford on a recent trip to
Washington, D.C.
Stanford and San Jose State are
two of 166 universities and colleges
which will be granted civilian air
schools. It is expected that between
40 and 50 students will be enrolled
for the course at Stanford, and there
is a possibility that several, women
students may be able to enroll in
the course as well as men students.
