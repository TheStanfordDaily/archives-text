# Foundation Work Nears Completion
## Hoover War Library To Tower 274 Feet Over University 
### 
The 274-foot tower which will face
Memorial Theater when the new
$600,000 "Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace" is com
pleted, is today but a hole in the
ground 124 feet square. Sixteen
stories high, the tower will have an
observation tower, a carillon to ri
val California's Campanile across the
bay.
The completion date is uncertain
at this time, due to the war and Pa
cific Coast labor difficulties, which
may delay arrival of materials.
With excavation for the building
nearly completed, the machine-gun
sound of riveting and hammering
will replace tractor and steam shovel
sound effects during open season in
the Library.
TO RECEIVE MATERIALS
According to John Leavers, con
struction superintendent, who has
had a hand in constructing Toyon
Hall and every building which has
gone up on the Campus since, this
week will be devoted to installing
equipment and receiving materials.
The tower will be supported by a
solid mat foundation made by a
continuous pour of cement, and con
structed of reinforced concrete and
steel.
President Wilbur is planning
groundbreaking ceremonies which
will probably take place during the
month of October.
RARE DOCUMENTS
Housed in the new building will
be the largest collection of wartime
documents gathered since 1914 from
secret files of the Allied and Central
Powers. Ex-President Herbert Hoo
ver began collection after the Armi
stice when he received the library
of Great Britain's Ministry of Infor
mation.
Five million documents large, the
collection includes photographs,
maps, and film as well as books and
papers.
What is now the Hoover Library
in a wing of the Stanford Library
will occupy the main floor of the
new building and room for four
other main collections will be pro
vided. They include the Ray Lyman
Wilbur collection on social prob
lems, the Hoover personal archives,
the Russian Revolution Institute,
and the German Revolution Insti
tute.
