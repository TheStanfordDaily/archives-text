# Farm Follows Honor Code
## Individual Support Makes System Work 
### 
Stanford's social and academic
morals are based on the student
honor codeâ€”a proven rule of con
duct which places responsibility for
honesty upon the individual stu
dent, and which includes no super
vision in its application.
Actually, the code requires no
more than that the student sign a
cursory honor pledge at the end of
every examination. This pledge
"No unpermitted aid given or re
ceived," is bluntly self-explanatory,
but at the same time carries the
weight of a long-established Stan
ford tradition.
The honor code demands that "no
references or quotations shall be
used without proper acknowledge
ment thereof." Students are expect
ed to do their own work, except in
instances where co-operation be
tween students is permissible. The
student himself is the judge of the
extent and kind of co-operation al
lowable.
In the use of the student body
card, in the library, in sign-outs,
and all other phases of Stanford life,
the Stanford student is expected to
live by the honor code.
There are no campus policemen to
watch the academic and socuil ac
tions of each student, but in justice
to the student body as a whole,
Men's and Women's Councils stand
ready to try, and punish, violators
of the Honor Code, where known.
