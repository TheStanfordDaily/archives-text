# Fire Razes Farm Professor's Home
## 
### 
The most serious fire on Campus
in over a year almost completely
destroyed the home of Charles Has
kell Danforth, professor of anatomy,
early in the morning of August 28.
The blaze broke out at 4:30 o'clock
and burned 45 minutes before it was
discovered. The fire raged for two
hours before it was extinguished,
leaving only a frame at 607 Cabrillo
Road.
Nobody was injured in the blaze,
which required four pieces of fire
apparatus to control. The cause of
the fire was undiscovered, accord
ing to information obtained at the
firehouse.
