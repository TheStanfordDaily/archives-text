# Cellar Refinished in Light Color
## 
### 
Students returning this fall will
find a renovated Cellar. Replacing
the former dark walls and wood
work, light cream plaster and blond
wood seats and booths are seen.
According to Miss Ricker, direc
tor of Union, the Swedish Modern
effect of the wood was achieved not
by installing new furniture, but by
scraping away what remained of

the dark paint and giving the raw
wood a light finish.
Painting the walls was necessary
in order to preserve the plastering
when cleaning the walls. The Cellar
has not had a new coat of paint for
nine years. The one new addition
this time was the placing of exten
sion leaves on the table in the corner
booth so that 15 people may sit there
comfortably.
