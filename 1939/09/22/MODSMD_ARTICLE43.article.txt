# New Committee to Involve More Students in Activities
## 
### 
A few minute's interview with a member of the new Activity Co
ordinating Committee will begin a career in campus activity for many
freshmen. In room 13 of the Union the Committee receives applications,
keeps a complete file of the names, interests, and high-school experience
of all students who apply.
Campus leaders, such as committee heads or organization presidents,

peruse the files for prospective ap-<
pointees; as each new student is
chosen to serve in some capacity an
estimate of his work is added to his
card in the file.
This system, which has been in
preparation for a little over a year,
enables any able student to help in
the type of activity in which he is
interested, and furnishes at the
same time a convenient basis of
selection for participation in campus
events.
PART OF CONSTITUTION
Incorporated in the A.S.S.U con
stitution last spring, the plan was
worked out by Lyle Cook, Betty
Davis, and Mary Sladen, who were
appointed by Ex Committee to in
vestigate problems in student ac
tivity participation.
Although the Activities Card File
is open to all campus leaders for
reference, its capacity, as well as
that of the Activity Co-ordinating
Committee, is advisory.
The Co-ordinating Committee,
members of which are to be selected
by Ex Committee at the beginning
of each year, may suggest changes
in committee appointments on the
grounds that an individual has an
activity load too heavy for his scho
lastic record, that he may do better
in other type of work, or that new
students may wish a chance to par
ticipate. Final action, however, rests
with Ex Committee or the president
of the class, Lyle Cook explained.
ADVISORY CAPACITY
Although the Co-ordinating Com
mittee works in close co-operation
with the administration, its final suc
cess depends upon student support,
Cook added, since its position is
that of an advisory body, intended
only to help in activity selections.
Besides interviewing students, and
helping to guide them as well as
possible into the proper channels, a
further function of the co-ordinat
ing program is to help sponsors in
presenting a program of activity ori
entation and presenting the possi
bilities of activities to new students,
part of this work is earned on dur
ing pre-registration, when new stu
dents are given a manual of activi
ties.
Students interested in journalism,
dramatics, music, 01* other fields
more specialized than that of serv
ice in student government should
also register with the A.S.S.U. ac
tivities card file, Cook declared, since
there are various opportunities for
them to participate in events involv
ing their type of work.
Office hours for interviews for the
Card File in Room 13 at the Union
will be announced later in the quar
ter. Student publications and organ
izations, will announce try-out pe
riods near the beginning of the year.
