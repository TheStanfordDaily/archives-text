# Orchesis Controls Dance Activities
## 
### 
Women's modern dance produc
tions at Stanford are controlled
through Orehesis, a dance group
under the direction of Margaret
Jewell, modern dance instructor.
Any woman interested in dancing
may become a member of Junior
Orehesis, whether she has had any
previous experience or not. Twice
yearly, tryouts are held for Senior
Orehesis. These two groups put on
modem dance recitals at which both
original compositions and technical
demonstrations are presented.
