A new typo generator with power
enough to shatter a log into match
like splinters will be completed this
quarter in the Ryan High Voltage
laboratory by William R. Johnson,
research assistant.
The new generator, designed by
Dr. William G. Hoover, assistant
professor of electrical engineering
will produce flashes six or seven feet
long, with a 2,000,000-vole kick.
