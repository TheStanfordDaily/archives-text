# WILBUR, DEANS GREET FROSH

### 
Again the campus is busy with
preparations for the return of its old
students and the coming of its new.
To both we extend a sincere wel
come. In the midst of our confused
and troubled world Stanford offers
to its young people opportunity for
mental training, opportunity for
friendship, and opportunity for co
operative living. These are signal
blessings today, and we know that
you will return full of desire to
make the most of them.
