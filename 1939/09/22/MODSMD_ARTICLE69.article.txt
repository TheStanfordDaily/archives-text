It is very stimulating to those of
us who have been here on the jot
for most of the year to see you all
return, refreshed and enthusiastic,
from your experiences and reflec
tions during the summer. The eager
ness in the eyes of the new students
is challenging. It is a pleasure to
welcome both boys and girls here to
Stanford for a year that, I hope, will
be most satisfactory and productive
for all.
I like to think of the beginning of
a new school year in the same way
that a coach views the opening of a
new season. He has analyzed the re
sults of the past year and, regard
less of the last record, he always
looks to the future With great hope.
As to the players, they are begin
ning a new period of training. This
means that if they are to get the
greatest return from the possibili
ties of the game, they must devote
themselves whole-heartedly to their
job. They must be willing to sacri
fice many of the habits and prac
tices that they are accustomed to
follow at other times. They are in
training, and good athletes always
play according to the requirements
of the game.
This is your responsibility and
your opportunity here at Stanford.
All the equipment and facilities nec
essary for your best development
are available. We coaches are eager
to put out a winning team, but it is
up to you to play the game.
