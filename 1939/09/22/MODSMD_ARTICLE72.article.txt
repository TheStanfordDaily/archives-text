Each year we take much pleasure
in welcoming a new group of en
tering students to share our Stan
ford privileges and responsibilities.
We love Stanford, and we hope that
you who are coming to us this fall
will love Stanford, too. We are look
ing forward eagerly to what you can
give us, as well as to what we can
give you.
Just as no civilization can long en
dure unless each generation adds its
share to the common store, so no
university can function as a living,
vital institution unless each student
generation with receptive and crea
tive minds gives of its youth and
enthusiasm and high ideals. A uni
versity must be more than a store
house of past knowledge. It must
be a lighthouse for the future.
Remember that along with your
registration books you will get the
Stanford brand, which will be with
you all the rest of your days. Dur
ing your student days wherever you
go, others will judge your actions
not as yours, but as those of "a
Stanford student." And in the years
to come, even though you may have
been here but a very short time, the
newspaper reports of you, whether
for good or ill, from the day of your
marriage to the day of your death,
will bear the caption, "a Stanford
man" or "a Stanford woman" did
this.
The branding iron of the Stanford
Farm is a good brand. There is
plenty of room here, good clean air,
and wholesome activities. "The wind
of freedom blows"—but that doesn't
mean license. You can be happy
here without being childish. In our
laboratories, the library, church and
theater, and in your contacts with
professors are intellectual, spiritual,
and cultural riches which are yours
for the taking.
We ax-e looking forward to having
you with us.
