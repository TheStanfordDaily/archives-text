## 
### 
Freshman and new lower division
students are this year being as
signed to rooms in Encina Hall ac
cording to a new plan worked out
in the offices of Dean of Men John
Bunn. The new arrangement will
be carried out to effect a more com
plete and valuable orientation to
Stanford on the part of each fresh
man student, according to Dean
Bunn.
The plan, which he described as
an heterogeneous arrangement of
residents, will place students with
roommates who are strangers to
them and who are if possible of
different interests and abilities.
"We are not placing old friends
together, and we are attempting as
much as possible to place athlete
with non-athlcte," Dean Bunn ex

plained. "We will also group stu
dents of varying academic majors
as much as possible.
"Encina life is a valuable experi
ence," he concluded. "We are sure
that the new arrangement, by mak
ing necessary a complete orientation
to Stanford life, will make Encina
even more valuable to the freshman
man."
Tl\e plan was tried in a few cases
last year, and, according to Dean
Bunn, worked well. The plan as car
ried through this year will be the
result of careful observation and
study, he said.
