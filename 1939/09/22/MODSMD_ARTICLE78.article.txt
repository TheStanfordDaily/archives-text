## Productions From 'Bard' Classics To Puppet Shows 
### 
Dividing productions between the
Division of Speech and Drama and
the Dramatists' Alliance, Stanford's
summer theater presented two plays,
five readings, and one puppet show
during the quarter.
Headed by Dr. Margery Bailey,
th<! Dramatists' Alliance began the
season with a reading of Maxwell
Anderson's "Knickerbocker Holi
day," the musical comedy which ran
last season in New York with Walter
Huston in the leading role of Peter
Stuyvesant. The patter lyrics oi
Kurt Weill's songs lent themselves
to reading, and the satire was well
presented by the cast, led by A.
Grove Day in the Huston role.
WAR SATIRIZED
During the National Colloid con
ference, a second reading was pre
sented by the Alliance. An acrid
satire on the falsity of war's heroism,
"The Ascent of F6," by W. H. Auden
and Christopher Isherwood, was
chosen.
In a different vein was the reading
of the 17th century Spanish play,
professor of Spanish from Vassar,
"Pvribanez," by Lope de Vega. Mar
garita de Mayo, visiting associate
directed.

the summer season w th a Drama
tists' Assembly held from July.3l to
Aug. 5. During this week the Max
well Anderson Award for verse
drama was given to Jean Clark for
her play, "Night Before the Border"
and to Arthur Sampley for his "Dis
