# One Professor, 22 Students Believed Caught in Europe
## 
### 
With 22 Stanford students and 5 faculty members in Europe or on the
high seas as this paper goes to press, repercussions from Adolf Hitler's war
drums are resounding in Farm ears.
Definite information has been received at Stanford from but 4 of the
21 students, all of whom are safe in neutral countries or in supposedly

protected areas of France and Eng-<
land.
Only one faculty member is re
ported in any possible danger:
Emeritus Professor and Mrs. Ar
thur Martin sailed Sept. 15 from
Norway, but Stanford friends have
received no word of their arrival in
New York.
PROFESSORS SAFE
The other four faculty members
are remaining in Europe for all or
part of the year to continue research
work begun before the war broke
out. Associate Professor and Mrs.
Henry Lanz are in London. Asso
ciate Professor and Mrs. Leland T.
Chapin are in Edinburgh, Scotland;
and Ralph S H. Lutz, professor of his
tory and dean of graduate study, is
doing research on the Versailles
Treaty for the Hoover Library in
Brussels, Belgium. In Germany when
war started, Professor Lutz left for
Holland on the last train out of
Germany.
HANSEN IN SKYROS
Miss Hazel D. Hansen, associate
professor of classics, is studying in
Skyros, an island in the Aegean.
Narrowly escaping being trapped
in Europe with thousands of other
Americans, Miss Mary Yost, dean of
women, left Southampton August 30
and arrived in New York Sept. 2 on
the Queen Mary. Her ship followed
the same course taken by the Athe
nia, which was sunk three days after
the departure of the Queen Mary.
Miss Yost was in Aberdeen when
the Russo-German pact was signed,
and in Scotland when Germany ad
vanced on Poland. Her abrupt de
parture from England climaxed a
three months' tour of the Scandi
navian countries. She was accom
panied by friends from Denver.
Stanley L. Sharp, instructor in
German, and Mrs. Sharp were in
Europe with their usual summer tour
of students eight days before the
war broke out, reaching New York
on Sept. 1. Fortunate to have seen

Europe intact for perhaps the last
time for perhaps a number of years,
all but two of the 22 students trav
eling with Dr. and Mrs. Sharp re
turned to this country.
Two of them, Grace Erskine and
Marilyn Eccles, are staying at the
American Consulate in Dinard,
France.
TIRED OF WAITING
Dr. Sharp said that fairly typical
of the man-on-the-street's view of
the war situation was the example
of the English in the first and then
in the last half of the summer: be
fore the Bank Holiday early in Aug
ust, very few people were traveling
onto the continent. But later, people
were traveling more than ever.
They were completely tired of the
war talk and the tension of waiting
for war.
Dr. Sharp said he had seen many
of the Stanford students traveling
independently in Europe, but could
give no information concerning them
after the conflict began, excepting
that Jeanne Welch came home on
his boat.
Others arriving safely from Eu
rope at about the time of the crisis
were Jean Webb and Carol Hall.
DOUBT EXPRESSED
Of the 22 Farm students whose
present location is in doubt, Dr.
Sharp met Phil Zonne, Pete McAr
thur, Bud McDuffie, and Joe Graves
in Rome.
Walt Stoessel and John Shallen
berger, two other of the Stanford
men in Europe, were both reported
leaving Southern Europe for Ger
many around Sept. 1, but no later
information has been received about
them.
Other students in Europe are:
Walt Fitch, Larry O'Brien, Lyman
Calkins, Dick Craemer, Dave Ryus,
president of last year's senior class,
Bud Milligan, Bill Todd, Ed. Ra-
Leigh, Betty Wood, Quentin Warren,
and Gretchen Ahlswede.
None of these people have defi
nitely been reported on.
More certain information has come
through concerning three other
Farm students. Beth Allen is in
Russia, where she will stay indefi
nitely. Dean Mayell is in Switzer
land attending the University of
Zurich.
Clyde Jeffrey, along with Les
Steers from San Mateo J. C., is
working as a taxi man in Monte
Carlo. Caught in Europe when the
was started, these two touring ath
letes quickly found jobs in that in
ternational fun zone aiding tourists
to get home.
Latest reports do not say when
they will return ot. this country.
Colonel Bernard B. Peyton, pro
fessor of military science and tac
tics at Stanford until last June, was
transferred to the embassy in Berlin
as a military attache. He left Stan
ford July 18 and is either in Ger
many at present or on the way there.
Tom Killefer, Stanford student
body manager last year and winner
of a Rhodes Scholarship, was unable
to go to Oxford to study this year.
All Rhodes scholarships have been
postponed.
However, Jack Laney, Delta Chi
awarded the Tarver exchange schol
arship, is now in Norway studying at
Oslo University. An unconfirmed
rumor states his ship was bombed
on the way over to Norway, but no
serious damage was done.

drums are resounding in Farm ears.
Definite information has been received at Stanford from but 4 of the
21 students, all of whom are safe in neutral countries or in supposedly

protected areas of France and Eng-<
land.
Only one faculty member is re
ported in any possible danger:
Emeritus Professor and Mrs. Ar
thur Martin sailed Sept. 15 from
Norway, but Stanford friends have
received no word of their arrival in
New York.
PROFESSORS SAFE
The other four faculty members
are remaining in Europe for all or
part of the year to continue research
work begun before the war broke
out. Associate Professor and Mrs.
Henry Lanz are in London. Asso
ciate Professor and Mrs. Leland T.
Chapin are in Edinburgh, Scotland;
and Ralph S H. Lutz, professor of his
tory and dean of graduate study, is
doing research on the Versailles
Treaty for the Hoover Library in
Brussels, Belgium. In Germany when
war started, Professor Lutz left for
Holland on the last train out of
Germany.
HANSEN IN SKYROS
Miss Hazel D. Hansen, associate
professor of classics, is studying in
Skyros, an island in the Aegean.
Narrowly escaping being trapped
in Europe with thousands of other
Americans, Miss Mary Yost, dean of
women, left Southampton August 30
and arrived in New York Sept. 2 on
the Queen Mary. Her ship followed
the same course taken by the Athe
nia, which was sunk three days after
the departure of the Queen Mary.
Miss Yost was in Aberdeen when
the Russo-German pact was signed,
and in Scotland when Germany ad
vanced on Poland. Her abrupt de
parture from England climaxed a
three months' tour of the Scandi
navian countries. She was accom
panied by friends from Denver.
Stanley L. Sharp, instructor in
German, and Mrs. Sharp were in
Europe with their usual summer tour
of students eight days before the
war broke out, reaching New York
on Sept. 1. Fortunate to have seen

Europe intact for perhaps the last
time for perhaps a number of years,
all but two of the 22 students trav
eling with Dr. and Mrs. Sharp re
turned to this country.
Two of them, Grace Erskine and
Marilyn Eccles, are staying at the
American Consulate in Dinard,
France.
TIRED OF WAITING
Dr. Sharp said that fairly typical
of the man-on-the-street's view of
the war situation was the example
of the English in the first and then
in the last half of the summer: be
fore the Bank Holiday early in Aug
ust, very few people were traveling
onto the continent. But later, people
were traveling more than ever.
They were completely tired of the
war talk and the tension of waiting
for war.
Dr. Sharp said he had seen many
of the Stanford students traveling
independently in Europe, but could
give no information concerning them
after the conflict began, excepting
that Jeanne Welch came home on
his boat.
Others arriving safely from Eu
rope at about the time of the crisis
were Jean Webb and Carol Hall.
DOUBT EXPRESSED
Of the 22 Farm students whose
present location is in doubt, Dr.
Sharp met Phil Zonne, Pete McAr
thur, Bud McDuffie, and Joe Graves
in Rome.
Walt Stoessel and John Shallen
berger, two other of the Stanford
men in Europe, were both reported
leaving Southern Europe for Ger
many around Sept. 1, but no later
information has been received about
them.
Other students in Europe are:
Walt Fitch, Larry O'Brien, Lyman
Calkins, Dick Craemer, Dave Ryus,
president of last year's senior class,
Bud Milligan, Bill Todd, Ed. Ra-
Leigh, Betty Wood, Quentin Warren,
and Gretchen Ahlswede.
None of these people have defi
nitely been reported on.
More certain information has come
through concerning three other
Farm students. Beth Allen is in
Russia, where she will stay indefi
nitely. Dean Mayell is in Switzer
land attending the University of
Zurich.
Clyde Jeffrey, along with Les
Steers from San Mateo J. C., is
working as a taxi man in Monte
Carlo. Caught in Europe when the
was started, these two touring ath
letes quickly found jobs in that in
ternational fun zone aiding tourists
to get home.
Latest reports do not say when
they will return ot. this country.
Colonel Bernard B. Peyton, pro
fessor of military science and tac
tics at Stanford until last June, was
transferred to the embassy in Berlin
as a military attache. He left Stan
ford July 18 and is either in Ger
many at present or on the way there.
Tom Killefer, Stanford student
body manager last year and winner
of a Rhodes Scholarship, was unable
to go to Oxford to study this year.
All Rhodes scholarships have been
postponed.
However, Jack Laney, Delta Chi
awarded the Tarver exchange schol
arship, is now in Norway studying at
Oslo University. An unconfirmed
rumor states his ship was bombed
on the way over to Norway, but no
serious damage was done.

21 students, all of whom are safe in neutral countries or in supposedly

protected areas of France and Eng-<
land.
Only one faculty member is re
ported in any possible danger:
Emeritus Professor and Mrs. Ar
thur Martin sailed Sept. 15 from
Norway, but Stanford friends have
received no word of their arrival in
New York.
PROFESSORS SAFE
The other four faculty members
are remaining in Europe for all or
part of the year to continue research
work begun before the war broke
out. Associate Professor and Mrs.
Henry Lanz are in London. Asso
ciate Professor and Mrs. Leland T.
Chapin are in Edinburgh, Scotland;
and Ralph S H. Lutz, professor of his
tory and dean of graduate study, is
doing research on the Versailles
Treaty for the Hoover Library in
Brussels, Belgium. In Germany when
war started, Professor Lutz left for
Holland on the last train out of
Germany.
HANSEN IN SKYROS
Miss Hazel D. Hansen, associate
professor of classics, is studying in
Skyros, an island in the Aegean.
Narrowly escaping being trapped
in Europe with thousands of other
Americans, Miss Mary Yost, dean of
women, left Southampton August 30
and arrived in New York Sept. 2 on
the Queen Mary. Her ship followed
the same course taken by the Athe
nia, which was sunk three days after
the departure of the Queen Mary.
Miss Yost was in Aberdeen when
the Russo-German pact was signed,
and in Scotland when Germany ad
vanced on Poland. Her abrupt de
parture from England climaxed a
three months' tour of the Scandi
navian countries. She was accom
panied by friends from Denver.
Stanley L. Sharp, instructor in
German, and Mrs. Sharp were in
Europe with their usual summer tour
of students eight days before the
war broke out, reaching New York
on Sept. 1. Fortunate to have seen

Europe intact for perhaps the last
time for perhaps a number of years,
all but two of the 22 students trav
eling with Dr. and Mrs. Sharp re
turned to this country.
Two of them, Grace Erskine and
Marilyn Eccles, are staying at the
American Consulate in Dinard,
France.
TIRED OF WAITING
Dr. Sharp said that fairly typical
of the man-on-the-street's view of
the war situation was the example
of the English in the first and then
in the last half of the summer: be
fore the Bank Holiday early in Aug
ust, very few people were traveling
onto the continent. But later, people
were traveling more than ever.
They were completely tired of the
war talk and the tension of waiting
for war.
Dr. Sharp said he had seen many
of the Stanford students traveling
independently in Europe, but could
give no information concerning them
after the conflict began, excepting
that Jeanne Welch came home on
his boat.
Others arriving safely from Eu
rope at about the time of the crisis
were Jean Webb and Carol Hall.
DOUBT EXPRESSED
Of the 22 Farm students whose
present location is in doubt, Dr.
Sharp met Phil Zonne, Pete McAr
thur, Bud McDuffie, and Joe Graves
in Rome.
Walt Stoessel and John Shallen
berger, two other of the Stanford
men in Europe, were both reported
leaving Southern Europe for Ger
many around Sept. 1, but no later
information has been received about
them.
Other students in Europe are:
Walt Fitch, Larry O'Brien, Lyman
Calkins, Dick Craemer, Dave Ryus,
president of last year's senior class,
Bud Milligan, Bill Todd, Ed. Ra-
Leigh, Betty Wood, Quentin Warren,
and Gretchen Ahlswede.
None of these people have defi
nitely been reported on.
More certain information has come
through concerning three other
Farm students. Beth Allen is in
Russia, where she will stay indefi
nitely. Dean Mayell is in Switzer
land attending the University of
Zurich.
Clyde Jeffrey, along with Les
Steers from San Mateo J. C., is
working as a taxi man in Monte
Carlo. Caught in Europe when the
was started, these two touring ath
letes quickly found jobs in that in
ternational fun zone aiding tourists
to get home.
Latest reports do not say when
they will return ot. this country.
Colonel Bernard B. Peyton, pro
fessor of military science and tac
tics at Stanford until last June, was
transferred to the embassy in Berlin
as a military attache. He left Stan
ford July 18 and is either in Ger
many at present or on the way there.
Tom Killefer, Stanford student
body manager last year and winner
of a Rhodes Scholarship, was unable
to go to Oxford to study this year.
All Rhodes scholarships have been
postponed.
However, Jack Laney, Delta Chi
awarded the Tarver exchange schol
arship, is now in Norway studying at
Oslo University. An unconfirmed
rumor states his ship was bombed
on the way over to Norway, but no
serious damage was done.
With 22 Stanford students and 5 faculty members in Europe or on the
high seas as this paper goes to press, repercussions from Adolf Hitler's war
drums are resounding in Farm ears.
