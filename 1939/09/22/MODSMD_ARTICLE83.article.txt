# Tri-Delts, Fijis Remodel Houses
## 
### 
Returning "Greeks" will not find
as many changes along the "Row"
as they did last September. Most
noticeable change is the new Delta
Delta Delta sorority house. Instead
of the familiar shingle dwelling, the
Tri-Delts have a large Spanish
stucco building for their new home.
Construction, which began July 1,
includes not only a new exterior, but
almost complete interior remodel
ing. Estimated cost is $20,000.
Further up the Row, the Phi
Gamma Delta House has had its in
terior remodelled. The_ "Fiji's" colo
nial white porch and exterior remain
the same, however. Cost is estimated
at $11,000.
