# Chaplain Plans Sunday Chapels
## Laymen to Address Student Services 
### 
To prove that "Religion at Stanford !
is not an ecclesiastic affair, but a j
part of common life," Dr. D. Elton
Tvueblood, chaplain, plans to invite .
a number of distinguished laymen
to speak at services each Sunday
throughout this year.
Carrying out his contention that
services are meant primarily for the ,
students themselves, Dr. Trueblood j
plans to continue his practice of the :
past two years of having one student j
and one faculty member read the
scripture lessons each Sunday. He
asks the students to volunteer for j
this opportunity, as well to offer sug- j
gestions at any time concerning \
prospective outside speakers at |
chapel whom they are interested in j
hearing.
First service will be held Sept. 24 |
when Dr. Trueblood will speak on J
"The Crisis in Civilization." The j
following Sunday, Oct. 1, will be the
traditional Matriculation Sunday at- j
tended by all freshmen at which
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, Dean
of Men John Bunn, and Dean of l
Women Mary Yost will speak.
