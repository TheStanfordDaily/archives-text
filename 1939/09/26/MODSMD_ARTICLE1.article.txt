### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
AN OLD MAN sat at a piano in a
glare of floodlights, playing for
ten thousand New Yorkers gathered
in gigantic Madison Square Garden.
He played quietly, slowly, without
the fire and fervor that music lovers
of 30 years ago had learned to asso
ciate with the name of Paderewski.
Suddenly his hands faltered above
the ivory keys. He slumped forward
against the piano.
The "farewell" conceit tour of the
world's most famous pianist was
ended. Seventy-nine-year-old Ig
nace Paderewski, statesman and art
ist, left the bright, demanding world
of teas, inceptions, and concerts that
night last May for a small villa on
the shores of Lake Geneva.

Yesterday as Poland. I)is native
land, for whose independence he
had fought at the council tables of
Europe, lay in virtual ruin before
the onslaught of Russia and Ger
many, her traditional foes, Pader
ewski had a visitor at his silent
retreat at Morgcs. The visitor was
an emissary from Bucharest, where
President Ignacy Moscicki and his
Polish officials have taken refuge
from flanie-ridden Warsaw.
The business that took the mes
senger to Riond Bosson meant that,
though Paderewski's years of public
life on the concert stage had ended,
his career as father of Polish free
dom was still Incomplete. There ap
peared to be strong indications that,
if Moscicki should resign, Paderew
ski would succeed him as the sym
bolic head of the state.
* * #
ostensible purpose of the
shift in leadership would be to
permit the establishment of a func
tioning Polish government in France.
Of course, Moscicki said in an ap
peal to the Polish people last week
that, their government continues to
function from Bucharest, though the
Rumanian government stoutly main
tains this is not true. Strict orders
prohibiting the expatriate Polish
chiefs from exercising any govern
mental authority on Rumanian soil
had been issued.
The obvious value of such a
move, proclaiming one of Poland's
greatest men as war-time premier,
lies in its tremendous propaganda
power. No one is foolish enough to
believe that a 79-year-old man
ran administer the complex ma
chinery of a nation in the throes
of war. Twenty-five years ago,
when he was premier, Paderewski
handled the job efficiently; today
that would be impossible. But the
name of Paderewski has far great
er worth than that of a simple ad
ministration.

Paderewski, should he accede to
the position of titular head of his
people, will be no ordinary premier
in any sense of the word. But, as
figurehead for a beleaguered coun
try, he could scarcely fail to attract
the sympathy of the entire civilized
world. At a time when the lords of
Europe control the charging race
horse of power politics with the
reins of propaganda, the drafting of
Paderewski is a master stroke.
Some observers believe that the
chief barrier to his acceptance of the
presidency—ar.J perhaps premier
ship as well—would be his health
which halted his long artistic career.
