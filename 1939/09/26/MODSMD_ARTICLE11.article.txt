# Southland Gale Takes 37 Lives
## High Seas Hinder Navy Rescue Work 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 25 (UP).â€”
Choppy seas, whipped by the toil of
a tropical gale, tonight hindered res
cue work of Coast Guard and Navy
patrol boats along the storm-smit
ten Southern California coastline.
At least 11 boats were known to
have been sunk and 23 others were
still missing. The death toll stood
at an estimated 37, although bodies
of many were not found. The storm
rolled up from the Mexican coast
last night and lashed at California
towns which had been sweltering in
an extended 100-degree heat wave.
Suddenness of the gale caught
thousands of persons who had gone
to the beaches and to sea to escape
the heat.
The storm was believed subsiding
iand passing inland to the desert ex
cept for occasional showers, but the
rescue ships were still heaving
about attempting to locate the
missing. At least 200 persons trap
ped on fishing barges were rescued
by heroic sailors and coast guards
men who put out in the churning
water. Scores of battered vessels
were swept ashore among other
storm debris.
Los Angeles streets were flooded
in some sections and traffic imped
ed, but inland cities suflered more.
The downpour in Los Angeles was
the heaviest September flood in
weather bureau records and follow
ed the heat wave which took from
60 to 80 lives. SOS calls came from
scores of points along the coast,
where stricken boats floundered. All
reports sifted in slowly.
Last vestiges of the heat wave
which blanketed Northern Califor
nia for nine days had been dispelled
tonight. Scattered rains and fog, ac
companied by cooling breezes,
swept, over the area, with occasional
rain forecast for Tuesday.
