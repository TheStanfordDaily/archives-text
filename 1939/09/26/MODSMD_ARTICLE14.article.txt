# Neutrality Bill In Committee; Lifts Embargo
## Administration Cuts Arms Ban Clause 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 (UP).—
The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee today received an adminis
tration neutrality revision bill con
taining minor concessions to Presi
dent Roosevelt's isolationist oppo
nents but providing for repeal of
the mandatory arms embai'go and
substitution of a modified cash-and
carry policy of dealing with bellig
erents.
Drafted by the group's Demo
cratic majority in "RUMPR" meet
ings under Chairman Key Pittman,
D., Nev., the measure was placed
before the fh\st regular meeting of
the full group since opening of the
special session called by the Presi
dent to enact legislation which he
believes will keep this nation out of
the European war.
RESEMBLES BLOOM BILL
The new measure technically is an
amended form of the so-called j
Bloom Bill as passed by the House
last session. However, all of the
original language except a few words
have been stricken out. Included in
the deletion is the preamble which
refers at one point to the United
States' adherence to the principles
of international law in pursuing its
policy of neutrality.
Chief concessions to the Presi
dent's foreign policy foes were pro
visions making major sections of the
act mandatory and giving Congress
equal power to declare a state of war
in existence between foreign pow
ers, thus forcing the chief executive
to proclaim the law in effect.
The Democratic draft, however,
clung fast to Mr. Roosevelt's de
mand for outright lifting of the em
bargo, central point of contention.
BANS U.S. VESSELS
The measure would ban shipment
of any kind of goods to belligerents
aboard American vessels, thus forc
ing foreign purchasers to assume full
title and responsibility to the ship
ments before they leave American
ports.
An important exception would
apply to land or inland waterway
shipments to Canada. Canadian pur
chases of arms and other supplies
from American producers could be
shipped on lake or canal barges, or
on regular rail, truck or airlines
owned by U.S. interests. The modi
fied cash provisions would apply,
however, and the President is left
free to impose restrictions on such
trade as he sees fit.
The modified cash provision per
mits the President to authorize for
eign purchases in this country on a
short-term credit basis —not longer
than 90 days. The credit could not
be renewed.
