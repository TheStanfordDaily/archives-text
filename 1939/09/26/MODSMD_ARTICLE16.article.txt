# Warsaw Flames Hurry Polish Plans to Set Up Government in France
## Paderewski May Become Symbolic Chief 
### United Press 
Following quickly on the heels of
the announcement that the entire
central section of Warsaw was in
flames, Poland today prepared to
set up a new government in France,
perhaps under the leadership of
aged Ignacy Paderewski who led his
country out of the shambles of the
World War, and carry on the war
at the side of Great Britain and
France.
The world-famous pianist, now 7U
and a voluntary exile from Poland
since 1921, may become the symbolic
head of the Polish state in a move to
arouse world-wide sympathy for the
Poles, if President Ignacy Moscicki,
a refugee in Rumania, decides to
resign.
A Polish Legion of 400,000 men is
being formed in France to aid the
Allied "fight to a finish" against Hit
lerism on the western front where
the war spread Monday along the
entire length of the German-French
frontier with deafening artillery fire.
FRENCH BIG GUNS
OPEN ATTACK ON RHINE
French long-range guns sent shells
whining across the Rhine and against
the main works of Germany's Sieg
fried Line at the edge of the Black
Forest—the first fighting along the
Rhine since the outbreak of the war.
The French high command told of
victories over the German air force
in two aerial battles. Four and per
haps five German planes were shot
down, two behind the French lines,
while the French lost two planes, it
was reported.
A German high command com
munique reporting that eight French
planes had been shot down was fol
lowed by a statement from the of
ficial D.N.B. news agency that the
planes were downed while attempt
ing to bomb the huge Zeppelin base
at Friedrichshafen on Lake Con
stance near the Swiss border. Later
D.N.B. revised its statement to say
merely that eight I rench craft were
brought down, eliminating any ref
erence to the place.
The German high command an
nounced eight French planes were
shot down when they attempted to
bomb the huge Zeppelin dirigible
and aviation plants at Friedrichs
hafen on Lake Constance, near the
Swiss border.
Neutral Swiss reports told of the
bombing of the Zeppelin works. The
Germans said the Frcnch were un
able to drop any bombs while the
French War Office countered with a
denial that eight planes had been
downed.
The Germans also claimed to havd
torpedoed and sunk a British de
stroyer, but no details were given.
