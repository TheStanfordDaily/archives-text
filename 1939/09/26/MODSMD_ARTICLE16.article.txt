# Warsaw Flames Hurry Polish Plans to Set Up Government in France
## Paderewski May Become Symbolic Chief 
### United Press 
Following quickly on the heels of
the announcement that the entire
central section of Warsaw was in
flames, Poland today prepared to
set up a new government in France,
perhaps under the leadership of
aged Ignacy Paderewski who led his
country out of the shambles of the
World War, and carry on the war
at the side of Great Britain and
France.
The world-famous pianist, now 7U
and a voluntary exile from Poland
since 1921, may become the symbolic
head of the Polish state in a move to
arouse world-wide sympathy for the
Poles, if President Ignacy Moscicki,
a refugee in Rumania, decides to
resign.
A Polish Legion of 400,000 men is
being formed in France to aid the
Allied "fight to a finish" against Hit
lerism on the western front where
the war spread Monday along the
entire length of the German-French
frontier with deafening artillery fire.
FRENCH BIG GUNS
OPEN ATTACK ON RHINE
French long-range guns sent shells
whining across the Rhine and against
the main works of Germany's Sieg
fried Line at the edge of the Black
Forestâ€”the first fighting along the
Rhine since the outbreak of the war.
The French high command told of
victories over the German air force
in two aerial battles. Four and per
haps five German planes were shot
down, two behind the French lines,
while the French lost two planes, it
was reported.
A German high command com
munique reporting that eight French
planes had been shot down was fol
lowed by a statement from the of
ficial D.N.B. news agency that the
planes were downed while attempt
ing to bomb the huge Zeppelin base
at Friedrichshafen on Lake Con
stance near the Swiss border. Later
D.N.B. revised its statement to say
merely that eight I rench craft were
brought down, eliminating any ref
erence to the place.
The German high command an
nounced eight French planes were
shot down when they attempted to
bomb the huge Zeppelin dirigible
and aviation plants at Friedrichs
hafen on Lake Constance, near the
Swiss border.
Neutral Swiss reports told of the
bombing of the Zeppelin works. The
Germans said the Frcnch were un
able to drop any bombs while the
French War Office countered with a
denial that eight planes had been
downed.
The Germans also claimed to havd
torpedoed and sunk a British de
stroyer, but no details were given.
BRITISH NONCOMMITTAL
OVER RUMORED SEA FIGHT
A day-long naval battle appeared
to have been fought off the west
coast of Norway, although the Brit
ish Admiralty said it knew nothing
of such a battle at sea. Residents of
islands off Bergen on the Norwe
gian west coast told of seeing an ap
parently damaged warship of un
identified nationality limping away
from the scene of battle in which at
least five warships were reported
to have participated.
A possible explanation of the
Norwegian reports was that British
warships, on their way up the Nor
wegian coast to convoy Scandina
vian merchant ships into English
ports and protect them against Nazi
submarines, might have run into
German war.ships.
WARSAW HOLDS OUT
DESPITE FLAMES
Warsaw, fast being reduced to
a heap of ruins by German siege
guns and planes, still held out de
fiantly Monday night against Nazi
demands that it surrender. With the
entire central area of the city re
ported in flames and "thousands"
of civilians killed over the week
end, the Polish defenders used bayo
nets against the Germans in the
suburbs to coixserve their dwindling
supplies of ammunition.
Shortly before midnight Monday
the Warsaw radio announced: "The
defense of Warsaw continues. The
defenders have successfully attacked
and repulsed the Germans in the
suburbs of Praga."
Nevertheless, the once beautiful
city seemed doomed and for many
of its defenders under arms there
seemed no alternative to death,
whether in resistance or after being
captured.
The official Vatican newspaper,
Osservatore Pioinano, called on
Adolf Hitler to end the bombing
and shelling of Warsaw but there
was no slackening in the siege.
Indications seemed to be increas
ing that another "peace proposal"
might come before next week-end,
despite the cuit rejections given by
Britain and France to Italian Pre
mier Mussolini's peace speech of
last Saturday and Hitler's own "last
ing peace" speech at Danzig a week
ago.
