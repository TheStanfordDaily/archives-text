# John Cobbs Drawls Tale Of Farm Dollar's Return
## 
### BUD AMES 
"So you want to know where your money goes?" drawled John Cohbs
Student Manager, spreading his two milky-colored shoes which were
planted on his overly neat desk.
"Well. I could tell you I only wish I knew where it went, but strangely
enough I do. Largely, the money received from the $15 community fees is

divided up among three student or
ganizations, namely the Women's
Athletic Association, the Stanford
Daily, and the various and multiple
organizations supported by the
A.S.S.U."
In a more specific vein, Cobbs
rustled through a ream of figured
papers pointing out these various
organizations and moaning concise
expenditures for each, twenty-one
in all, numbering such groups as tjie
Lecture Series, Debaters, and Hand
book printers, with a total expendi
ture of $23,950.
'"Pleasantly enough this will leave
a surplus of approximately $3,350
which will be turned into the oper
ating surplus fund and which will
be used for unexpected expenses
that have not been budgeted. What
remains of this operating surplus at
the end of this year will be de
posited in the unrestricted surplus
fund which at present totals ap
proximately $6,400.
"But this is only one side of this
Student Manager's job," Cobbs
moaned on. "In addition to handling
all the A.S.S.U. conducts, I also act
as banker for all the campus or
ganizations which, together with the
A.S.S.U., bank their accounts in the
Student Organizations Fund. Thus
whenever any campus organization
undertakes some enterprise such as
a dance they first get an authoriza
tion from the A.S.S.U. office. At tht
same time, the A.S.S.U. underwrites
and protects each of these enter
prises through use of a $4,000 un
derwriting fund which is kept leve
at all times."
Once under way, Cobbs was hare
to stop. But he concluded his in
teresting figuiizing by accounting
for $4,450 which he explained apolo
getically was used as a maintenanct
and replacement fund for the A.S
S.U. offices.

in all, numbering such groups as tjie
Lecture Series, Debaters, and Hand
book printers, with a total expendi
ture of $23,950.
'"Pleasantly enough this will leave
a surplus of approximately $3,350
which will be turned into the oper
ating surplus fund and which will
be used for unexpected expenses
that have not been budgeted. What
remains of this operating surplus at
the end of this year will be de
posited in the unrestricted surplus
fund which at present totals ap
proximately $6,400.
"But this is only one side of this
Student Manager's job," Cobbs
moaned on. "In addition to handling
all the A.S.S.U. conducts, I also act
as banker for all the campus or
ganizations which, together with the
A.S.S.U., bank their accounts in the
Student Organizations Fund. Thus
whenever any campus organization
undertakes some enterprise such as
a dance they first get an authoriza
tion from the A.S.S.U. office. At tht
same time, the A.S.S.U. underwrites
and protects each of these enter
prises through use of a $4,000 un
derwriting fund which is kept leve
at all times."
Once under way, Cobbs was hare
to stop. But he concluded his in
teresting figuiizing by accounting
for $4,450 which he explained apolo
getically was used as a maintenanct
and replacement fund for the A.S
S.U. offices.
"So you want to know where your money goes?" drawled John Cohbs
Student Manager, spreading his two milky-colored shoes which were
planted on his overly neat desk.
"Well. I could tell you I only wish I knew where it went, but strangely
enough I do. Largely, the money received from the $15 community fees is

divided up among three student or
ganizations, namely the Women's
Athletic Association, the Stanford
Daily, and the various and multiple
organizations supported by the
A.S.S.U."
In a more specific vein, Cobbs
rustled through a ream of figured
papers pointing out these various
organizations and moaning concise
