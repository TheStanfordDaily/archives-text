# 'Call at General' Says Postmaster
## 
### 
Stanford's Postmaster Ralph W.
Evans announced yesterday that all
new boxholders are advised to call
at general delivery until their mail
is steadily addressed to the new box
in order to avoid delay in receiving
mail.
Delay will also result, according
to Mr. Evans, if mail is directed to
the halls instead of to a street ad
dress or post office box. Magazines,
newspapers or books should be ad
dressed to boxes or street addresses
and publishers can be so notified on
Form No. 22-B, which, Mr. Evans
announces, can be procured at the
post office.
