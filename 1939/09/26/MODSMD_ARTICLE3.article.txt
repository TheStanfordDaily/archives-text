# Farm Soph Flees Nazi Air Attack
## Nancy Burkett Kinds Haven in Switzerland; Awaits Home 
### 
Nancy Burkett, Stanford Kappa
sophomore, is the only Farm student
in Europe known to be in any dan
ger as Adolph Hitler's war has
spread to five countries and modern
big-gun armies are fighting on three
fronts.
All of the reported 22 students
caught in Europe two weeks ago, in
cluding Clyde Jeffrey, sensational
sprinter who toured with American
track stars this summer, are now
safely in this country or on the <vay
home according to information re
ceived by their friends and families.
But according to a letter received
from Miss Burkett, she narrowly
escaped from Germany in a heavily
guarded sealed train after having
been through a bombing attack in
northern Germany.
ESCAPES TO SWITZERLAND
Leaving the train, with her moth
er and sister, in Vienna, she was
again under fire in that city as it too
was bombed before she could escape
into Switzerland.
She and her family are there now
waiting for a boat to this country.
Miss Burkett had planned to re
main away from Stanford all year to
travel around the world.
Also in Switzerland is Walt Stoes
sel, who was there at the time Hitler
moved in on Poland, and, according
to latest reports, has not yet left that
country.
Clyde Jeffrey and Les Steers, San
Mateo J.C. high jumper, landed in
New York Saturday on the Man
hattan, and are expected back on
the Peninsula at the end of this
week.
STUDENTS INTERRUPTED
Philip Dirstine, a fellowship stu
dent in chemistry who has been
studying in Germany, has been un
able to get back to this country
for another year at Stanford. He is
at present in the south of France.
Jack Vibert is in Germany work
ing at the American consulate office,
and Wolfgang Dieck, an exchange
scholar here from Germany last
year, is now in the German army.
These students, along with half a
dozen others, are remaining in
Europe of their own accord.
FIFTEEN WHO ESCAPED
But among those who were caught
there during the first few weeks of
the war and have now escaped are:
Walt Fitch, Bud McDufiie, Allen
Grey, John Shallenberger, Shirley
Okell, Quentin Warren, Devons
Gust, Phil Zonnc, ePte McArthur,
Dave Ryus, Bruce Oshier, Howard
Naquin, Gretchen Ahlswede, Ly
man Calkins, and Jerry Sparling.
John Shallenberger, former Daily
sports editor enrolled this year at the
Harvard School of Business, writes |
The Daily that there is definite dis
sension in Germany over Hitler's
bringing on the war, but this dis
sension is entirely subjugated to
Der Fuehrer's iron-handed power
over the country. The German man
in the street is against the war but
afraid to say so.
Shallenberger came back on the
Mauritania and says that it, like all
merchant vessels, was heavily ca
mouflaged and followed a zig-zag
course charted by the British Ad
miralty to help it escape enemy sub
marines.
Professor George W. Beadle of the
biology department came over from
Europe on the over-crowded "City
of Flint" which carried many of the
Athenia survivors, but refused to
comment on the trip or the reactions
of the passengers as they were once
again on the high seas and the prey
to possible submarines.

able to get back to this country
for another year at Stanford. He is
at present in the south of France.
Jack Vibert is in Germany work
ing at the American consulate office,
and Wolfgang Dieck, an exchange
scholar here from Germany last
year, is now in the German army.
These students, along with half a
dozen others, are remaining in
Europe of their own accord.
FIFTEEN WHO ESCAPED
But among those who were caught
there during the first few weeks of
the war and have now escaped are:
Walt Fitch, Bud McDufiie, Allen
Grey, John Shallenberger, Shirley
Okell, Quentin Warren, Devons
Gust, Phil Zonnc, ePte McArthur,
Dave Ryus, Bruce Oshier, Howard
Naquin, Gretchen Ahlswede, Ly
man Calkins, and Jerry Sparling.
John Shallenberger, former Daily
sports editor enrolled this year at the
Harvard School of Business, writes |
The Daily that there is definite dis
sension in Germany over Hitler's
bringing on the war, but this dis
sension is entirely subjugated to
Der Fuehrer's iron-handed power
over the country. The German man
in the street is against the war but
afraid to say so.
Shallenberger came back on the
Mauritania and says that it, like all
merchant vessels, was heavily ca
mouflaged and followed a zig-zag
course charted by the British Ad
miralty to help it escape enemy sub
marines.
Professor George W. Beadle of the
biology department came over from
Europe on the over-crowded "City
of Flint" which carried many of the
Athenia survivors, but refused to
comment on the trip or the reactions
of the passengers as they were once
again on the high seas and the prey
to possible submarines.
Nancy Burkett, Stanford Kappa
sophomore, is the only Farm student
in Europe known to be in any dan
ger as Adolph Hitler's war has
spread to five countries and modern
big-gun armies are fighting on three
fronts.
All of the reported 22 students
caught in Europe two weeks ago, in
cluding Clyde Jeffrey, sensational
sprinter who toured with American
track stars this summer, are now
safely in this country or on the <vay
home according to information re
ceived by their friends and families.
But according to a letter received
from Miss Burkett, she narrowly
escaped from Germany in a heavily
guarded sealed train after having
been through a bombing attack in
northern Germany.
ESCAPES TO SWITZERLAND
Leaving the train, with her moth
er and sister, in Vienna, she was
again under fire in that city as it too
was bombed before she could escape
into Switzerland.
She and her family are there now
waiting for a boat to this country.
Miss Burkett had planned to re
main away from Stanford all year to
travel around the world.
Also in Switzerland is Walt Stoes
sel, who was there at the time Hitler
moved in on Poland, and, according
to latest reports, has not yet left that
country.
Clyde Jeffrey and Les Steers, San
Mateo J.C. high jumper, landed in
New York Saturday on the Man
hattan, and are expected back on
the Peninsula at the end of this
week.
