MANILA, P.1., Sept. 25 (UP).—
Fourteen U.S. Nuvy bombers arrived
here today from the Hawaiian Is
lands to take stations in the United
States neutrality patrol of the Phil
ippine Islands. Fifteen planes left
Honolulu last week on a leisurely
flight but one was forced to fly back
to Midway to repair an engine break.
It was expected later.
