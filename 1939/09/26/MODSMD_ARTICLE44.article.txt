## 
### 
Lcs Squ ires, Stanford ';>G, came back to the Farm last summer to replacc
Norris James, '2(>, as editor and publisher of the Illustrated Review, Stan
ford's alumni magazine.
Once a columnist 011 The Daily, where he wrote a rhymed column'
"Swing in the News," Mr. Squires has held several journalistic positions

between the time of his graduation,
and his recent arrival here. Follow
ing graduation in 1936 he worked
nine months on the San Francisco
News before going into publicity
work in Hollywood.
After a year of running his own
publicity agency in Southern Cali
fornia, Mr. Squires returned to the
Bay area last year to do editorial
work for the Gctz Publishing Com
pany of San Francisco. Head of the
company is Robert Getz, Stanford
'35.
Back at the University to study
for a Master's degree in Interna
tional Relations, Les Squires has in
stituted several new features in the
Review in order to "brighten it up."
"Our new policy, besides reporting
alumni news, of course, will attempt
to present a complete picture of
Stanford life on campus and ofl," he
declaimed. "And we expect to use The
Daily extensively for news sources,"
he added.
"We are trying to lighten some of
the make-up styles," said Mr.
Squires. "The type of cover has
been the first big change, and we
positively guarantee to have no pic
tures of the Quad on future covers,
since that theme has been overem
phasized for too long a time." In
keeping with this new policy the
September cover depicts Norm
Standlee manicuring a lawn with
the caption "Big Red Machine: Sum
mer Model."
Copying Time Magazine's famous
quiz, a Stanford Quiz has been com
piled for the Illustrated Review to
jog alumni memories about Farm
history. Alvin C. Eurick, professor
of education at Stanford, who helped
Time make up its quiz, also aided in
arranging the Stanford question
naire.
As an experiment the Review is
now accepting short stories provided
they have Stanford backgrounds and
arc by new authors.
