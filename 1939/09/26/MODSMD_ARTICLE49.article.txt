# New Polo Coach Takes Over Squad
## 
### 
Fall quarter brings to Stanford a
new polo coach in the person of
Major John Smith.
With conditioning work on the
horses scheduled as the first step,
polo practice gets under way tomor
row on the practice field just south
of the R.O.T.C. barracks. More ad
vanced work will begin next week.
The greater part of last year's
team has graduated, but Major
Smith believes that the few return
ing veterans from the "A" squad
and the players who are coming up
from last season's "B" squad will
give him enough material.

As many as 4,000 termites have
been found in a cubic foot of wood.
