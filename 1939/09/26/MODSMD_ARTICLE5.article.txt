Mrs. Irene Coverley, head of the
Student Employment Office, yester
day released the following notice to
all students:
"All students applying for NYA
work, both graduate and undergrad

reason it is essential that each ap

Assignment cannot be made until
this is done. Future notices will be
released through The Daily and
posted on campus bulletin boards

Interviews will probably begin to
