# Cards Dig In This Week As Beaver Game Looms
## Break in Heat Wave Gives Indians Additional Impetus 
### 
One practice session a day is on
the menu for Tiny Thomhill's Car
dinal gridders as the Big Red # Ma
chine rolls into the last week of pre
season practice. With the opening
battle against Lon Stiner's potent
Oregon State eleven coming up Sat
urday, the Indians will be leveling
in earnest during these final work
outs, and it's a safe bet that more
than one night this week the lights
above the practice field wih see
duty.
Stanford's coaching staff is voting
a belated thanks to the weather man
for finally calling a halt to the re
cent heat wave. The hot sun did
some good by boiling off the excess
fat that many of the boys brought
back from summer vacation, but
last week's workouts wei'e slowed
almost to a halt by the torrid spell.
Some of the heavyweights on the
squad have wasted away to a mere
200-pound shadow. Colin McClin
tock and Bill Trout seem hardest
hit, although everyone on the squad
was beginning to have a "lean and
hungry look" by last Saturday.
LINEUP SAME
Thornhill's first-team lineup has
remained the same since practice
started ten days ago, but some of
the prospective regulars haven't
shown much in recent contact work,
and may find themselves gathering
slivers on the bench in the Stadium
Saturday.

Stan Andersen anrl "Swede" Jo
hansen were expected to hold down
the tackle slots, but both will have
to improve their performances to
date in order to get the call over
sophomore Wink Jones and "Big
Bill" Trout. Colin McClintock has
taken up where he left off at the
close of spring practice, and is one
of two sophomores almost certain to
take the field for the opening kick
off against the Beavers. The other
second-year man, needless to say,
will be Frankie Albert.
ALBERT SHINES
The flash from Glendale continues
to astound observers by the deadly
accuracy of his southpaw fireballs.
Albert may not be the best passer
on the coast, but he'll do until the
best comes along. After watching
him throw one strike after another
to receivers apparently covered, it
is hard to imagine anyone being
more accuratc.
Jim Groves, returning after a
year's absence due to an injured
shoulder, looked good in practice.
When the Indians went through a
hard scrum Saturday, Groves
blocked very effectively and broke
away for substantial gains on re
verses.
Pete Kmetovic, working at third
string left halfback, gave the first
team something of a headache in the
scrum. A member of last year's un
defeated frosh eleven and a sprinter
on the Papoose track team, Kmeto
vic gave a large crowd something to
cheer about by getting loose for sev
eral long gains through tackle and
around end.
Some of Kmetovic's success may
have been due to the absence of
three regulars from the first-string
lineup. McClintock, Johansen, and
Anderson watched the session from
the sidelines.
No serious injuries have turned up
yet. Several minor bruises have
been reported, but the squad is oth
erwise still intact.
A total of 112,860 persons visited
the Quad during the year 1937-38,
according to a day-by-day count
taken at Memorial Arch.

close of spring practice, and is one
of two sophomores almost certain to
take the field for the opening kick
off against the Beavers. The other
second-year man, needless to say,
will be Frankie Albert.
ALBERT SHINES
The flash from Glendale continues
to astound observers by the deadly
accuracy of his southpaw fireballs.
Albert may not be the best passer
on the coast, but he'll do until the
best comes along. After watching
him throw one strike after another
to receivers apparently covered, it
is hard to imagine anyone being
more accuratc.
Jim Groves, returning after a
year's absence due to an injured
shoulder, looked good in practice.
When the Indians went through a
hard scrum Saturday, Groves
blocked very effectively and broke
away for substantial gains on re
verses.
Pete Kmetovic, working at third
string left halfback, gave the first
team something of a headache in the
scrum. A member of last year's un
defeated frosh eleven and a sprinter
on the Papoose track team, Kmeto
vic gave a large crowd something to
cheer about by getting loose for sev
eral long gains through tackle and
around end.
Some of Kmetovic's success may
have been due to the absence of
three regulars from the first-string
lineup. McClintock, Johansen, and
Anderson watched the session from
the sidelines.
No serious injuries have turned up
yet. Several minor bruises have
been reported, but the squad is oth
erwise still intact.
A total of 112,860 persons visited
the Quad during the year 1937-38,
according to a day-by-day count
taken at Memorial Arch.
One practice session a day is on
the menu for Tiny Thomhill's Car
dinal gridders as the Big Red # Ma
chine rolls into the last week of pre
season practice. With the opening
battle against Lon Stiner's potent
Oregon State eleven coming up Sat
urday, the Indians will be leveling
in earnest during these final work
outs, and it's a safe bet that more
than one night this week the lights
above the practice field wih see
duty.
Stanford's coaching staff is voting
a belated thanks to the weather man
for finally calling a halt to the re
cent heat wave. The hot sun did
some good by boiling off the excess
fat that many of the boys brought
back from summer vacation, but
last week's workouts wei'e slowed
almost to a halt by the torrid spell.
Some of the heavyweights on the
squad have wasted away to a mere
200-pound shadow. Colin McClin
tock and Bill Trout seem hardest
hit, although everyone on the squad
was beginning to have a "lean and
hungry look" by last Saturday.
LINEUP SAME
Thornhill's first-team lineup has
remained the same since practice
started ten days ago, but some of
the prospective regulars haven't
shown much in recent contact work,
and may find themselves gathering
slivers on the bench in the Stadium
Saturday.

Stan Andersen anrl "Swede" Jo
hansen were expected to hold down
the tackle slots, but both will have
to improve their performances to
date in order to get the call over
sophomore Wink Jones and "Big
Bill" Trout. Colin McClintock has
taken up where he left off at the
close of spring practice, and is one
of two sophomores almost certain to
take the field for the opening kick
off against the Beavers. The other
second-year man, needless to say,
