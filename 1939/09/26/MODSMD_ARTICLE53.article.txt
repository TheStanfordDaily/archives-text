# Howie Adams To Rejoin Card Swim Team
## Coach Anticipates Successful Schedule For Diving Prodigy 
### 
Nort Thornton, local swimming
and diving mentor, sprang into the
air t'other day and did a back flip, a
jack knife, and a four and one-half
open forward somersault before
coming to rest from his fancy aerial
flight, according to usually reliable
sources.
He was stopped from climbing a
30-foot platform which then loomed
above the water-free Stanford pool
—say reports.
He was just celebrating—celebrat
ing the return of one-half of the lost
Stanford swimming legion —- Howie
Adams, by name.
lIERRON STILL MISSING
Paul Herron, the other 50 per cent,
is still missing.
Adams, former Richmond High
School and Fairmont Hotel sensa
tion, was ineligible as a freshman
last year, except in three meets.
This season he was to drop out of
school "to work a year." Coach
Thornton feared what this might
mean—"they never come back."
T'other day, however, without any
celebration, and reading in The
Daily that he wasn't coming back,
Adams came back.
THORNTON RELAXED
So Nort Thornton was able to for
get about the hot weather and re
lax, a happy man.
Howie will take the place of Roy
Winkelmann, now diving for Sally
Rand's "Gay Paree" on Treasure
Island. Wink, deciding the Olympic
Games are too much of a doubtful
issue, threw his lot at cutting figures
in the air for the Exposition troupe.
Adams and Winkelmann never
met in a diving contest.
Adams won the Far Western title
two years ago, whipping men that
Winkelmann could not conquer. De
spite the fact that Winkelmann was
defeated only once during his col
legiate calmer, many consider Ad
ams the better diver.
ADAMS SENIOR CHAMP
Adams was champion of the North
Coast section of the C.I.F. when a
senior at Richmond High School.
After graduation he stayed out of
school for a year, and was under
the hand of Phil Patterson of Fair
mont Hotel.
After only a year and a half un
der the famous springboard expert,
he collected the Far Western title.
Adams was victim of a "lay-off" last
year, however, when he was ruled
ineligible. He took place in only the
final three meets of the season.
But despite this "vacation" Coach
Thornton believes he will be uncon
tested for the conference title. "He
will have to work on his funda
mentals before he can expect to be
come an Olympic prospect," he said.
"But he's a real national hope."

THORNTON RELAXED
So Nort Thornton was able to for
get about the hot weather and re
lax, a happy man.
Howie will take the place of Roy
Winkelmann, now diving for Sally
Rand's "Gay Paree" on Treasure
Island. Wink, deciding the Olympic
Games are too much of a doubtful
issue, threw his lot at cutting figures
in the air for the Exposition troupe.
Adams and Winkelmann never
met in a diving contest.
Adams won the Far Western title
two years ago, whipping men that
Winkelmann could not conquer. De
spite the fact that Winkelmann was
defeated only once during his col
legiate calmer, many consider Ad
ams the better diver.
ADAMS SENIOR CHAMP
Adams was champion of the North
Coast section of the C.I.F. when a
senior at Richmond High School.
After graduation he stayed out of
school for a year, and was under
the hand of Phil Patterson of Fair
mont Hotel.
After only a year and a half un
der the famous springboard expert,
he collected the Far Western title.
Adams was victim of a "lay-off" last
year, however, when he was ruled
ineligible. He took place in only the
final three meets of the season.
But despite this "vacation" Coach
Thornton believes he will be uncon
tested for the conference title. "He
will have to work on his funda
mentals before he can expect to be
come an Olympic prospect," he said.
"But he's a real national hope."
Nort Thornton, local swimming
and diving mentor, sprang into the
air t'other day and did a back flip, a
jack knife, and a four and one-half
open forward somersault before
coming to rest from his fancy aerial
flight, according to usually reliable
sources.
He was stopped from climbing a
30-foot platform which then loomed
above the water-free Stanford pool
—say reports.
He was just celebrating—celebrat
ing the return of one-half of the lost
Stanford swimming legion —- Howie
Adams, by name.
lIERRON STILL MISSING
Paul Herron, the other 50 per cent,
is still missing.
Adams, former Richmond High
School and Fairmont Hotel sensa
tion, was ineligible as a freshman
last year, except in three meets.
This season he was to drop out of
school "to work a year." Coach
Thornton feared what this might
mean—"they never come back."
T'other day, however, without any
celebration, and reading in The
Daily that he wasn't coming back,
Adams came back.
