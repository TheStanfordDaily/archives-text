# Frosh Prime For Jaysee Champions
## Youngsters To Try Teeth On Modestans Shipkey Cut Squad From 75 to 45; Line Averages 200 Founds 
### 
A team so full of stars that it fea
tures teamwork is the set-up today
on the tSanford yearling football
outfit as it approaches its opening j
bill with Modesto J.C. which will be j
a preliminary to the varsity scrap |
with Oregon State Saturday.
The frosh squad has been whittled !
from 70 to 45 —four strings boast- j
ing of much of everything, or so it ;
would appear to the coaches and j
observers before the team has been
dipped in the acid.
The acid will be Modesto J. C., de- ,
fending Northern California, jaysee
conference champion, and reported '
little less potent than the season be- i
fore.
NO STARS
Head Man Harry Shipkey claims j
he hasn't any stars, which is just an i
expression, tl is more likely that !
he has so many stars that no one is j
outstanding.
The first string line is a formidable
institution which averages over 200 j
pounds. Little Ed McCain, guard, is
the baby, weighing 195.
The ends, both sticky-fiingered
gents, are fast—fast despite the 210
pounds they pack. Hank Norberg,
perennial king of Peninsula Athletic-
League linemen while at Palo Alto
High School, is also quite a punter.
Ed Stamrn is the other flanker.
TACKLE SPOTS
George Robinson, 212, will line up
with Bruno Banducchi, 190, at the
tackle points. With McCain will be
Dick Palmer, 195, at guard. Bill
Mannon, 205-pound Los Angeles
High School star, will be at the pivot
.spot.
The backfield is of no small fry,
with Charlie Taylor, blocking quar
terback, and Milt Vucinich, full
back, in the combination. They are
joined, however, by lesser weights,
the tricky gentleman of the combi
nation—Al Cole and Eric Arm
strong. It was the latter pair which
scored in the early-practice scrim
mages.
Cole will probably also do the
punting, although Norberg and Ver
non Hart, third-string end, are bet
ter at it. oßth are flankers, how
ever. Vucinich handles the passing
problem.
SECOND STRING
Pressing the first-string Papooses
will be number two men Bill Lymes
and Jack Tellefson, ends; Bob
Millington and Ralph Bochmier,
tackles; Roger Lavery and Emil
Norrls, guards; Pete Camolok, cen
ter; Bob Hammett, quarterback; Red
Robinson, left half; Bub Morrison,
right half; and Bob Greening', full
back.
