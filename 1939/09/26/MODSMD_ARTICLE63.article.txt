### JERRY MAYER 
It's a great feeling to pick up a
Sunday sports section and to once
again let your eyes wander over
columns of football news. There is
something more vitally alive about
a pigskin-laden sports page than
one featuring almost any other sport.
Even with tragedy engulfing Europe
and the front pages blazing sensa
tional banner lines of sunken war
ships, airplane attacks, and bloody
infantry advances, football will man
age to be the live issue in America
for the next two months.
Headers will scan the headlines on
the front pages, pondering momen
tarily on just how much propaganda
and how little truth they see be
hind the news—and then will move
on to the sports section, where they
can believe what they see. There
is something fundamentally more
cleanly exciting about football news
than the tainted mess of front page
foreign war news.
Last Sunday, for instance, there
was plenty for the football fanatic
to speculate over, despite the fact
that most of the big teams of the
country were withholding their
lirst shots for the coining Saturday.
San Jose State, with ex-Stanford
player Dud DeGroot and ex-Stan
tord coach Glenn Seobie Warner co
[ ordinating their mentoring abilities,
j upset San Francisco University. Al
though 75 per cent of the nation's
! colleges haven't even had their first
game yet, San Jose has won three
already, and has ten more games to
i go on its schedule.
The University of South Dakota
i obligingly traveled 1,500 miles to
i help Amos Alonzo Stagg success
| fully inaugurate his fiftieth year as
a football coach. Stagg's College of
Pacific gridders thumped the invad
| ing Dakotans, 6-0.
it is almost fantastic to contem
plate the story-book history that
i is Stagg's. Seventy-seven years
! old, Stagg was coaching before
most of our parents were born. In
188!), when the "Grand Old Man"
was just a perspiring young kid
fresh out of college, football didn't
know what it was to have a pass
i play. Gridders played with prac
tically no protective equipment,
i and it was suicide to compete if
| you didn't weigh art least 200
pounds. Trick plays in those days
meant clipping your opponent in
some new way. The word "sports
manship" wasn't even in the die
; tionary.
And yet this year Stagg is cele
j brating his fiftieth year as a coach.
! His flanker attack is one of the trick
| iest present-day offensives. Well
j conceived reverses are a funda
; mental part of Stagg's maneuvers
i while a play featuring two laterals
! followed by a forward pass put Col
| lege of Pacific into position to score
: their touchdown against South Da
j kita.
i It makes one wonder whethei
I Stagg grew up with football, oi
I whether football grew up wit!
| Stagg.
In our own little conference
I Washington State was the first tearr

I to break into action, defeating Gon
| zaga, 19-6, in very unimpressive
j fashion. It's bolstering to the morale
I of any true Stanford man to know
| that the only team to finish lower in
I the conference last year than the
i Cardinals doesn't show any improve
! ment.
j Dick Emerson, Cougar halfback,
: established himself as the first back
! field star of the season by practically
, beating Gonzaga single-handed. His
1 forward pass put the ball in position
I for the first touchdown, then after
' returning an intercepted pass more
than 50 yards, he scored the second
i marker on a 14-yard run. He flipped
five-yard aerial for the final touch
i down.
Police looking through the effects
of a 17-year-old boy drowned in a
| canoe in the Thames river found this
| entry in his diary: "Left about eight
| o'clock for Australia. Tide going the
wrong way."

It's a great feeling to pick up a
Sunday sports section and to once
again let your eyes wander over
columns of football news. There is
something more vitally alive about
a pigskin-laden sports page than
one featuring almost any other sport.
Even with tragedy engulfing Europe
and the front pages blazing sensa
tional banner lines of sunken war
ships, airplane attacks, and bloody
infantry advances, football will man
age to be the live issue in America
for the next two months.
Headers will scan the headlines on
the front pages, pondering momen
tarily on just how much propaganda
and how little truth they see be
hind the news—and then will move
on to the sports section, where they
can believe what they see. There
is something fundamentally more
cleanly exciting about football news
than the tainted mess of front page
foreign war news.
Last Sunday, for instance, there
was plenty for the football fanatic
to speculate over, despite the fact
that most of the big teams of the
country were withholding their
lirst shots for the coining Saturday.

it is almost fantastic to contem

i is Stagg's. Seventy-seven years

most of our parents were born. In
188!), when the "Grand Old Man"
was just a perspiring young kid
fresh out of college, football didn't
know what it was to have a pass
i play. Gridders played with prac
tically no protective equipment,
i and it was suicide to compete if
| you didn't weigh art least 200
pounds. Trick plays in those days
meant clipping your opponent in
some new way. The word "sports
manship" wasn't even in the die
; tionary.
And yet this year Stagg is cele
j brating his fiftieth year as a coach.
! His flanker attack is one of the trick
