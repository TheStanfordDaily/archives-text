# Welcome to Death

T AVE a good summer?"
XI Today on all parts of the campus hands
are being shaken and smiles are being ex
changed—Stanford is welcoming its family.
But of all the 4,200 men and women returning
to the Farm, not one is the same individual that
sailed down Palm Drive three and a half months
ago to start his summer vacation. Today a great
responsibility lies heavy on the shoulders of
the students of this and every other American
university, a responsibility only a few were
fearing or thinking about last June.
Keeping the United States out of the current
European war is the obligation of every in
telligent citizen. And it is the personal duty of
the young people of the nation, those who may
be called upon to fight and die, to prevent this
country from entering the conflict.
This is not a question of courage or cowar
dice. We already have learned that winning a
war for the Allies will not make the world safe
for democracy. The issue is whether or not we
are going to profit from the bitter lesson that
was contained in the Treaty of Versailles.
The far-sighted, intelligent person can see
this. But unfortunately there soon may come a
time when the majority of the United States'
citizens will say, "Germany and Russia are
winning. We cannot afford to stand by and let
them crush the democracies—because when
they have succeeded in dominating Europe,
they will turn to the western hemisphere."
Twenty years is the minimum amount of time
in which a highly heterogeneous German or
Russian empire, exhausted from the colossal
struggle of subjugating France and Britain,
could recover sufficiently to build the gigantic
fleet and supreme military organization capable
of invading North America. Long before this
day could come, Hitler and Stalin would be
battling over the supremacy of the Continent,
perhaps destroying each other.
The danger of a European invasion of the
United States is very slight. But if we enter the
war, the danger that we may see the end of all
democratic governments is great.
Either the Russo-German axis will vanquish
us completely, or the Allies will win—and we
can sit around for 21 years and wait to send
our sons across the Atlantic to be slaughtered
in the next war.
The duty of the Stanford student is clear. We
must fight to keep the United States from re
peating the blunder of 1917.
Not only must we campaign for peace in
these comparatively quiet days, but when the
fever of war is at its height, when friends pass
us by without speaking—because we are try
ing to save our country from the blind stupidity
that will lead to its destruction.

Either the Russo-German axis will vanquish
us completely, or the Allies will win—and we
can sit around for 21 years and wait to send
our sons across the Atlantic to be slaughtered
in the next war.
The duty of the Stanford student is clear. We
must fight to keep the United States from re
peating the blunder of 1917.
Not only must we campaign for peace in
these comparatively quiet days, but when the
fever of war is at its height, when friends pass
us by without speaking—because we are try
ing to save our country from the blind stupidity
that will lead to its destruction.
T AVE a good summer?"
XI Today on all parts of the campus hands
are being shaken and smiles are being ex
changed—Stanford is welcoming its family.
But of all the 4,200 men and women returning
to the Farm, not one is the same individual that
sailed down Palm Drive three and a half months
ago to start his summer vacation. Today a great
responsibility lies heavy on the shoulders of
the students of this and every other American
university, a responsibility only a few were
fearing or thinking about last June.
Keeping the United States out of the current
European war is the obligation of every in
telligent citizen. And it is the personal duty of
the young people of the nation, those who may
be called upon to fight and die, to prevent this
country from entering the conflict.
This is not a question of courage or cowar
dice. We already have learned that winning a
war for the Allies will not make the world safe
for democracy. The issue is whether or not we
are going to profit from the bitter lesson that
was contained in the Treaty of Versailles.
The far-sighted, intelligent person can see
this. But unfortunately there soon may come a
time when the majority of the United States'
citizens will say, "Germany and Russia are
winning. We cannot afford to stand by and let
them crush the democracies—because when
they have succeeded in dominating Europe,
they will turn to the western hemisphere."
Twenty years is the minimum amount of time
in which a highly heterogeneous German or
Russian empire, exhausted from the colossal
struggle of subjugating France and Britain,
could recover sufficiently to build the gigantic
fleet and supreme military organization capable
of invading North America. Long before this
day could come, Hitler and Stalin would be
battling over the supremacy of the Continent,
perhaps destroying each other.
The danger of a European invasion of the
United States is very slight. But if we enter the
war, the danger that we may see the end of all
democratic governments is great.
