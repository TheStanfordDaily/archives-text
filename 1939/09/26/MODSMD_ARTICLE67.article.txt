# The 						Great and Screwy State
## 
### 
THE first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November the people of California will vote
on a bill which is among the most ill-advised
that has ever been proposed since the state
was admitted to the Union.
The "$3O Every Thursday" or "Ham and
Eggs" plan, if passed, would be completely dis
astrous to the economic stability of the state —
and yet Professor Bernard Haley, one of the
foremost authorities on the subject, predicts
that it will be voted into effect.
If his prognostication is correct, not many
years will pass before Stanford University is
forced to close its doors. Bonds and other in
vestments made worthless by this inflationary
measure, the necessity of accepting "$3O-Thurs
day" warrants for payments—these alone are
capable of ruining the financial foundation of
the school.
The man in the street may argue in favor of
"Ham and Eggs" in the belief that it will harm
only wealthy holders of state securities and cor
porations engaged in interstate commerce while
it brings employment and prosperity to the
rank and file.
But let him examine part 4 of section 2 of the
bill, and he will find that it provides, "that the
sovereign people of the State of California de
clare that any intentional or deliberate curtail
ment or limitation or destruction of production
is in violation of the public interest." In other
words the courts very easily may interpret this
measure as denying the right to strike.
Thus "S3O Every Thursday" would be fatal
not to the interests of any single group or class,
but to the welfare of the entire commonwealth
of California. Those who find incredible the

possibility of such a proposal being accepted
must remember that a vast majority of its pro
ponents have never read any part of the bill
and that they regard it only as a gleaming prom
ise of an end to unemployment and a return of
state-wide prosperity.
What can Stanford students do to forestall
the disaster of a successful Retirement Life
Payments Act?
Merely this: An appreciable percentage of
the student body is of voting age. Let all those
who are qualified to enjoy the franchise, who
have lived in the state for the past year and in
the county for the past 90 days, register to vote
in Palo Alto before this Thursday. Let all voters
who have registered in their home towns apply
for absentee ballots between October 18 and
November 1.
And let every qualified Stanford man and
woman cast his vote to kill "$3O Every Thurs
day."

it brings employment and prosperity to the
rank and file.
But let him examine part 4 of section 2 of the
bill, and he will find that it provides, "that the
sovereign people of the State of California de
clare that any intentional or deliberate curtail
ment or limitation or destruction of production
is in violation of the public interest." In other
words the courts very easily may interpret this
measure as denying the right to strike.
Thus "S3O Every Thursday" would be fatal
not to the interests of any single group or class,
but to the welfare of the entire commonwealth
of California. Those who find incredible the

possibility of such a proposal being accepted
must remember that a vast majority of its pro
ponents have never read any part of the bill
and that they regard it only as a gleaming prom
ise of an end to unemployment and a return of
state-wide prosperity.
What can Stanford students do to forestall
the disaster of a successful Retirement Life
Payments Act?
Merely this: An appreciable percentage of
the student body is of voting age. Let all those
who are qualified to enjoy the franchise, who
have lived in the state for the past year and in
the county for the past 90 days, register to vote
in Palo Alto before this Thursday. Let all voters
who have registered in their home towns apply
for absentee ballots between October 18 and
November 1.
And let every qualified Stanford man and
woman cast his vote to kill "$3O Every Thurs
day."
THE first Tuesday after the first Monday in
November the people of California will vote
on a bill which is among the most ill-advised
that has ever been proposed since the state
was admitted to the Union.
The "$3O Every Thursday" or "Ham and
Eggs" plan, if passed, would be completely dis
astrous to the economic stability of the state —
and yet Professor Bernard Haley, one of the
foremost authorities on the subject, predicts
that it will be voted into effect.
If his prognostication is correct, not many
years will pass before Stanford University is
forced to close its doors. Bonds and other in
vestments made worthless by this inflationary
measure, the necessity of accepting "$3O-Thurs
day" warrants for payments—these alone are
capable of ruining the financial foundation of
the school.
The man in the street may argue in favor of
"Ham and Eggs" in the belief that it will harm
only wealthy holders of state securities and cor
porations engaged in interstate commerce while
it brings employment and prosperity to the
rank and file.
