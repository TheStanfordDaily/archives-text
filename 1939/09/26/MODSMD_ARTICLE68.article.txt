# BULL SESSION

### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
OF CABBAGES ANI) KINGS
' B 'HE British call them discussions; the French call
them tete-a-tctcs; cow punchers call them "chew
in" the fat"; sailors call them gam sessions. They take
place all over the Farm: on the English Corner, in
Encina hallways; in every habitable place, in fact, and
even in a few uninhabitable places closely associated
with the shower. Specialized types occur in the Cactus
Gardens and on the golf course. Stanford calls them
bull sessions.
As essential to Stanford men and women as are
overly large fans to haggard Sally Rand, is the preroga
tive of "slinging the bull." Europe may cease to mur
der people; the Ku Klux Klan may elect Bill Robinson
as its most Exalted Kleigel; San Franciscans may tell
you that Southern California weather is balmy. But
Stanford, from Encina to the foothills, always shall be
the scene of dozens of scattered bull sessions.
Stanford's sessions are as diverse in their topics as
in their locations—that is, when the company is mixed.
Every day small groups are "settling" the international
situation, religion, the library parking lot, high prices
on Union orange juice, the Roosevelt third term, Amer
ican neturality, and sex.
It is the diversity of subject and the freedom of
opinion in Stanford's typical bull sessions that the
Daily's Bull Session aspires 1o achieve. The column has
usually been two things: the means for and the cause
of letting off a lot of steam. People who have read the
column in the past have generally thanked God and
the editor of the Daily's for "Campus Opinion." And
such thanks as that speak well for a Bull Sessioner.
If he has something to say on a diversity of subjects,
and if he says them in English, he should attract a di
versity of criticism. This complimentary criticism, as
much as anything else, is this writer's wish.
We don't look for popular agreement; we don't look
for Ihings to write about that can only resolve them
selves into soft soap; we don't look either for chronic
complaint subjects. We hope only to keep Bull Session
Stanford's—and free.

in" the fat"; sailors call them gam sessions. They take
place all over the Farm: on the English Corner, in
Encina hallways; in every habitable place, in fact, and
even in a few uninhabitable places closely associated
with the shower. Specialized types occur in the Cactus
Gardens and on the golf course. Stanford calls them
bull sessions.
As essential to Stanford men and women as are
overly large fans to haggard Sally Rand, is the preroga
tive of "slinging the bull." Europe may cease to mur
der people; the Ku Klux Klan may elect Bill Robinson
as its most Exalted Kleigel; San Franciscans may tell
you that Southern California weather is balmy. But
Stanford, from Encina to the foothills, always shall be
the scene of dozens of scattered bull sessions.
Stanford's sessions are as diverse in their topics as
in their locations—that is, when the company is mixed.
Every day small groups are "settling" the international
situation, religion, the library parking lot, high prices
on Union orange juice, the Roosevelt third term, Amer
ican neturality, and sex.
It is the diversity of subject and the freedom of
opinion in Stanford's typical bull sessions that the
Daily's Bull Session aspires 1o achieve. The column has
usually been two things: the means for and the cause
of letting off a lot of steam. People who have read the
column in the past have generally thanked God and
the editor of the Daily's for "Campus Opinion." And
such thanks as that speak well for a Bull Sessioner.
If he has something to say on a diversity of subjects,
and if he says them in English, he should attract a di
versity of criticism. This complimentary criticism, as
much as anything else, is this writer's wish.
We don't look for popular agreement; we don't look
for Ihings to write about that can only resolve them
selves into soft soap; we don't look either for chronic
complaint subjects. We hope only to keep Bull Session
Stanford's—and free.
