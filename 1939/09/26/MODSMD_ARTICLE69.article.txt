# CAMPUS OPINION
## DOWN WITH "HAM AND EGGS" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I want to express my opinion concerning the farcical
Ham and Eggs Amendment to be voted upon Novem
ber 7. There is little doubt that, the voting public is
giving the amendment less consideration than it de
serves. And there is no doubt but that it is potentially
the most ruinous bill the people of the state have ever
voted upon.
Not enough voters realize what an excellent chance
it has to pass. In the general election of November 8.
last, 1,143,670 voters favored its passage. Only 1,398,999
voted against the proposition—a mere 55 per cent of
those who voted! This year the Ham and Eggs organi
zation has an income of approximately $100,000 per
month, most of which they arc spending on promotion.
They claim their paper, The National Ham and Eggs
Weekly, to be the fastest growing paper in the history
of the country. This may well be true. Their group
has become powerful enough to annihilate California's
credit, and government.
Perhaps Stanford students do not know the prob
able efTects which would result from its passage. I can
say that after having read the act and reliable analy
ses of the act thai I am convinced that if the act passes
and goes into effect Stanford will not hold open its
doors very long! This would be far from the worst of
the amendment's effects but it should be important
enough for us to want to do something.
The final registration day is September 28, Thurs
day. Any student who will be of age by November 7
should register and vote No. They should tell friends
elsewhere to do likewise. Because if the amendment is
not defeated we will all have to go home and un
doubtedly find the family packing to move out of the
state. Or moved.
Sincerely,
Bob Moulton
