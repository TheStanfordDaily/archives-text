# Haley Predicts Victory For 'Ham and Eggs' Plan
## 
### RICHARD B. DUDMAN 
Slowly, methodically, Bernard F. Haley, professor of economics, pointed
out yesterday exactly where the $:$0 Every Thursday" plan will collapse.
Then, having analyzed the economic and political objections to the
proposal, lie said he thought "it probably will pass." Many Stanford stu-

dents, along with other
throughout the state, will vote on i
the proposed amendment at the
special election Nov. 7.
WARRANTS DANGEROUS
Opposing the plan primarily on
economic grounds, Professor Haley,
who is one of three experts who
were appointed to study the plan by
the Commonwealth Club of Califor
nia, cited the possibility that mer
chants would organize in opposi
tion and refuse to accept the war
rants which would be issued under
the proposal.
"This would mean—as its backers
admit—immediate collapse of the'
plan," he said, "and a nightmarish
situation might result—speculation
in warrants, with bargainers paying
varying prices according to the
number of stamps on each warrant."
The professor considered it more
likely that the warrants would
force lawful money out of circula
tion after out-of-state transactions
had put a premium on it.
INFLATION IS CERTAINTY
A third possibility, lie pointed out, j
i.s establishment of a two-price sys- |
tem —one price for customers having j
warrants, another for those having
lawful money.
Unrestricted inflation is almost:
certain if the warrants are accepted, j
he said, explaining that $780,000,000 I
in new money would cause an inv- '
mediate rise in prices. The act pro- |
vides that the warrant payments for !
pensions and salaries of state cm- |
ployees must rise in proportion to
prices, thereby further increasing I
money in circulation.
From a political point of view the
plan is objectionable because it sets
up a powerful agency that is beyond
the control of courts, legislature, and
executive, the professor explained. !
CREATE DICTATORSHIP
"Many objectors to the plan say it
would create a dictatorship," he'
said. "I think it is more accurate,
although less sensational, to say that
the proposal would set up an agency
with tremendous power, and that
any such agency should be subject
to the legislature and courts."
Despite the defects he cited in the
plan, Professor Haley said it was
his guess the amendment would
pass.
"Backers of the plan have built
up a machine that will be practically
impossible for the opposition to
match before Nov. 7," he said. "Also,
since this is a special election, the
proponents will be likely to vote the
most heavily."
HARD TO ARGUE
He showed that ceitain changcs in
the bill, such as a provision that
state employees may receive then
pay in lawful money, are sure to
make certain groups more favorable
to the plan than in 1938.
"It is hard to argue with those
who favor the plan," he concluded.
"You answer every point they can
bring up and think you have proven
the plan not workable—and then
they say, 'At least it's a possible
remedy for unemployment and de
pression; how can you oppose it
without suggesting something bet
ter?' "

"You answer every point they can
bring up and think you have proven
the plan not workable—and then
they say, 'At least it's a possible
remedy for unemployment and de
pression; how can you oppose it
without suggesting something bet
ter?' "
Slowly, methodically, Bernard F. Haley, professor of economics, pointed
out yesterday exactly where the $:$0 Every Thursday" plan will collapse.
Then, having analyzed the economic and political objections to the
proposal, lie said he thought "it probably will pass." Many Stanford stu-

dents, along with other
throughout the state, will vote on i
the proposed amendment at the
special election Nov. 7.
WARRANTS DANGEROUS
Opposing the plan primarily on
economic grounds, Professor Haley,
who is one of three experts who
were appointed to study the plan by
the Commonwealth Club of Califor
nia, cited the possibility that mer
chants would organize in opposi
tion and refuse to accept the war
rants which would be issued under
the proposal.
"This would mean—as its backers
admit—immediate collapse of the'
plan," he said, "and a nightmarish
situation might result—speculation
in warrants, with bargainers paying
varying prices according to the
number of stamps on each warrant."
The professor considered it more
likely that the warrants would
force lawful money out of circula
tion after out-of-state transactions
had put a premium on it.
INFLATION IS CERTAINTY
A third possibility, lie pointed out, j
i.s establishment of a two-price sys- |
tem —one price for customers having j
warrants, another for those having
lawful money.
Unrestricted inflation is almost:
certain if the warrants are accepted, j
he said, explaining that $780,000,000 I
in new money would cause an inv- '
mediate rise in prices. The act pro- |
vides that the warrant payments for !
pensions and salaries of state cm- |
ployees must rise in proportion to
prices, thereby further increasing I
money in circulation.
From a political point of view the
plan is objectionable because it sets
up a powerful agency that is beyond
the control of courts, legislature, and
executive, the professor explained. !
CREATE DICTATORSHIP
"Many objectors to the plan say it
would create a dictatorship," he'
said. "I think it is more accurate,
although less sensational, to say that
the proposal would set up an agency
with tremendous power, and that
any such agency should be subject
to the legislature and courts."
Despite the defects he cited in the
plan, Professor Haley said it was
his guess the amendment would
pass.
"Backers of the plan have built
up a machine that will be practically
impossible for the opposition to
match before Nov. 7," he said. "Also,
since this is a special election, the
proponents will be likely to vote the
most heavily."
HARD TO ARGUE
He showed that ceitain changcs in
the bill, such as a provision that
state employees may receive then
pay in lawful money, are sure to
make certain groups more favorable
to the plan than in 1938.
"It is hard to argue with those
who favor the plan," he concluded.
"You answer every point they can
bring up and think you have proven
the plan not workable—and then
they say, 'At least it's a possible

pression; how can you oppose it
