# STANFORD'S EYESORE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
New students or visitors are favorably impressed
by the sweeping green lawn at the head of Paint Drive,
the carefully tended shrubbery, and by the neat group
of buildings with the Chapel in the background which
together comprise the Quad.
Evidently, they think Stanford takes pride in her
campus. And they are certain that she has put to no
little expense to maintain it in proper style.
For those who venture into the reference room of
Stanford's Library, however, any favorable impres
sion that may have been obtained earlier is destroyed
in short order. For at the southeast end of this room,
hanging over two large windows are to be seen some
torn remnants stuck together with library paste that
once might have been drapes. These tatters, in immi
nent danger of tearing loose from their moorings and
descending in a shower of dust upon some unsuspect
ing student of Californiana, had outlived their use
fulness at the time of the Teapot Dome Scandal.
The officials of the Library have long answered
students' complaints of poor lighting, lack of books, and
other facilities, by saying that the Library lacks funds.
Surely, the scarcity of money cannot be used as an
cxcuse for allowing this eyesore to remain. For at an
infinitesimal fraction of the cost of maintaining the
grounds in perfect order the curtains could be re
placed.
Why spend large amounts of money on the grounds
if the Library curtains are to remain as a reminder
that Stanford is only interested in the outward ap
pearances? If the University feels that it cannot afford
even this small expenditure or the cost of replacing
the drapes could at least be torn down and used to
cover that abomination, the Library fountain, or sold as
antique tapestries to some gullible museum.
A.S.C.. and R.V.M.
