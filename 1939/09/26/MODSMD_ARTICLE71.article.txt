# Gary Cooper Satisfies As 'Beau Geste'
## 
### 
"BEAU GESTE," playing today at
the Stanford Theater.
That gallant adventurer Beau
Geste is back again, this time played
by the strong silent man Gary Coo
per. Although those may be jus
tified who moan for the good old
days, when Ronald Coleman was the
dashing legionnaire, in our opinion
Cooper fills the bill and then some.
The first "Beau Geste" was before
this reviewer's time so we can't
compare the two performances ex
cept by remote control. Our only
complaint would be that Cooper
seemed to fit a little too easily into
the rough life of the Foreign Legion,
while Coleman typifies the aristo
cratic Englishman who sacrifices all
for the honor of the family.
COOPER DASHING
Coopel' is able to handle almost
any role, and he doesn't miss this
time. In his slow, western style he
has plenty of glamour and dash.
The real star of the show, as you
have undoubtedly heard, is Brian
Donlevy, the best villain to sneer in
many a day. His mere appearance
is frightening and he doesn't seem
to have a single virtue in him.
Ray Milland and Robert Preston
turned in creditable performances
as the two other Geste brothers, and
Louise Hay ward was convincing as
the girl Milland left behind.
PLOT MOVES RAPIDLY
Essentially an action picture, Par
amount hasn't missed a trick in
attempting to make their pride and
joy surpass the English "Four
Feathers." The battle sequence is
one of the best to grace the screen
in some time. The Legion runs from
trouble to battle to trouble at a fast
pace.
The picture slows down only at
the burial of Beau Geste, an ex
tended anticlimax to the already
completed story.
But the few weaknesses can't com
pare to the good points, and unless
you're living on your memories of
the old days, you're sure to enjoy
the new "Beau Geste."
