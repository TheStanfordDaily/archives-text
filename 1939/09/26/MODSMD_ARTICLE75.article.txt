## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Aii automobile accident was the principal cause of Fcrenc Molnar's
discovery of California. A one-day visit for a concert unexpectedly be
came a six months' sojourn in a hospital, and the famous Hungarian vio
linist found what he hopes will be his permanent home.
"The people of California arc unique in their friendliness and kindness,
I. who had always found the travel and the excitement of the traveling

concert artist perfectly satisfying,
discovered the 'simple life' during
that six months and later in the two
summers I spent here with the Roth
Quartet. So now I have settled
down, and Palo Alto shall be my
home." Molnar's Hungarian accents
slurred pleasantly over his "r's" and
"t's."
MOLNAR PLANS STUDIOS
At present his musical activities
will be divided between San Fran
cisco and Palo Alto, for he plans to
have studios in both places. His so
called "Open Day for AJI Music
Lovers" will be continued. This mu
sical open house was inaugurated
successfully this summer. At it, Palo
Altans and Stanford students and
professors may indulge their tastes
for either playing or simply enjoy
ing chamber music. "My purpose in
this is to give interested individuals
a chance to cultivate their own mu
sical tastes," he said.
A quartet of Stanford students is
to be organized, and will be trained
for the giving of public concerts.
To be known as the "Stanford Quar
tet," the group is to be made up of
students in the University and as
graduation causes a member to
leave, his place will be taken by an
other student.
Molnar, an officer in the Hun
garian army during the first World
War, spent the last two years of the
war in a Siberian prison camp. He
still has a violin made for him by a
fellow prisoner from the wood of
his bed. Steel wires from an elec
tric cord were used.
Commenting on Hungary's placc
in the present war, he says, "I know
that Hungary does not wish to en
ter. She is not prepared and has an
army of only about 60,000 men
However, she may be forced in by
her big neighbor, Germany. It it
like the big spider and the little
/ly."
Both Mr. and Mrs. Molnar were
concerned about the weather —il
waj raining. Assured that it was
"very unusual," they relaxed
slightly, but still remarked that "it
was the first time we have seer
weather like this since we have been
coming to California."

tric cord were used.
Commenting on Hungary's placc
in the present war, he says, "I know
that Hungary does not wish to en
ter. She is not prepared and has an
army of only about 60,000 men
However, she may be forced in by
her big neighbor, Germany. It it
like the big spider and the little
/ly."
Both Mr. and Mrs. Molnar were
concerned about the weather —il
waj raining. Assured that it was
"very unusual," they relaxed
slightly, but still remarked that "it
was the first time we have seer
weather like this since we have been
coming to California."
Aii automobile accident was the principal cause of Fcrenc Molnar's
discovery of California. A one-day visit for a concert unexpectedly be
came a six months' sojourn in a hospital, and the famous Hungarian vio
linist found what he hopes will be his permanent home.
"The people of California arc unique in their friendliness and kindness,
I. who had always found the travel and the excitement of the traveling

concert artist perfectly satisfying,
discovered the 'simple life' during
that six months and later in the two
summers I spent here with the Roth
Quartet. So now I have settled
down, and Palo Alto shall be my
home." Molnar's Hungarian accents
slurred pleasantly over his "r's" and
"t's."
MOLNAR PLANS STUDIOS
At present his musical activities
will be divided between San Fran
cisco and Palo Alto, for he plans to
have studios in both places. His so
called "Open Day for AJI Music
Lovers" will be continued. This mu
sical open house was inaugurated
successfully this summer. At it, Palo
Altans and Stanford students and
professors may indulge their tastes
for either playing or simply enjoy
ing chamber music. "My purpose in
this is to give interested individuals
a chance to cultivate their own mu
sical tastes," he said.
A quartet of Stanford students is
to be organized, and will be trained
for the giving of public concerts.
To be known as the "Stanford Quar
tet," the group is to be made up of
students in the University and as
graduation causes a member to
leave, his place will be taken by an
other student.
Molnar, an officer in the Hun
garian army during the first World
War, spent the last two years of the
war in a Siberian prison camp. He
still has a violin made for him by a
fellow prisoner from the wood of
his bed. Steel wires from an elec
tric cord were used.
