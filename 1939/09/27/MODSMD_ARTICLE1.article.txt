### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
J AST night at sundown the red
flames of destruction colored the
sky above Warsaw after a day-long
bombardment of the city by German
guns and 200 airplanes.
From his darkened radio station in
the heart of the battered city, an an
nouncer sent out bulletins to the
world that awaited word of War
saw's capture. The reports said that
the defenders of the shattered city
still were determined to resist "un
til death."

The Warsaw announcer, de
scribing the heavy barrage, said
"the last 21 hours, if anything,
have been still more terrible than
those of the preceding few days."
As he spoke, the scream of sirens
in the deserted streets mingled with
the crash of incendiary bombs that
spread the flaming ruin. "Most of
the public buildings in the city are
burning. Warsaw is entirely in ruins.
The fires and debris make circula
tion difficult, if not impossible," he
continued.
And there is small chance of ex
tinguishing the fires because of a
scarcity of water, while the food sit
uation is becoming steadily worse.
Meanwhile, 18 miles northwest of
the city, the old Russian fortress of
Modlin continued to hold off Nazi
assaults from that direction.

IN other sections of Warsaw the
Polish defenders fighting hand
tit-hand with bayonets against the
Germans repulsed a German at
tempt to seize the suburb of Mok
otow. But these military detach
ments in the suburbs had smaller
losses than the civilian popula
tion because the Nazis were bom
barding civilians, especially, in or
der to shatter morale by destruc
tion of life, the announcer added.
"It's impossible to estimate the
number of victims," he said.

While Stanfordites were chalking
up a new record autumn quarter
registration, Polish workers were
butchering and distributing the car
casses of hundreds of horses killed
by shells in the streets of Warsaw.
The homeless and destitute made
their evening meal on grilled horse
meat.
As the Warsaw announcer told of
the city's plight, the German radio
justified the aerial and artillery
bombardment on the grounds that
the capital is a military citadel
where "remnants of the completely
shattered Polish army still is offer
ing hopeless resistance to the Ger
man troops."

r JpHE grim recital of disaster con
tinued. Suddenly the announcer
halted. One last, sentence followed.
"Sorry, we must close down now for
the night." That was all from War
saw.
Satisfied with their demolition
of Poland. Nazi chieftains last
night dispatched their foreign min
ister, Joachim von Ribbcntrop, to
Moscow. The sudden journey of
Ribbcntrop is no traveling sales
man's routine jaunt. Ribbcntrop
used to sell champagne; now he
sells revised maps of Europe. It's
fairly obvious that his surprise
trip foreshadows another Soviet -
German conference to reshape
"zones of influence" on the Con
tinent.
