# F. R. Keeping 'Hands Off Neutrality
## Revision of Bill Left Up to Congress, Hull Informs Vandenberg 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2fi (UP).â€”
The administration is keeping hands
off .the neutrality law revision
struggle, Secretary of State Cordell
Hull indicated clearly today when
he advised Senator Arthur H. Van
denberg, R., Mich., that he has "com
plete confidence" in the ability of
Congress to solve the problem.
Hull, in response to a query from
Vandenberg, declined to be drawn
into a discussion of the relative
merits of the measure which admin
istration supporters placed before
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee yesterday for repeal of the
arms embargo and substitution of a
cash-and-carry plan of selling arms
and supplies to all belligerents.
The position taken by Hull con
formed with the views of adminis
tration leaders in Congress who have
promised Mr. Roosevelt victory for
the embargo repeal provided the
executive branch refrains from ac
tively participating in the contro
versy.
FEAR LOSS OF SUPPORT
Mr. Roosevelt's backers were said
to have resorted to that expedient
because of fear that the present sup
port of certain conservative Demo
crats for the administration program
would become alienated if Congress
is not given free sway in the strug
gle.
Earlier the President held a spe
cial meeting with six members of
his cabinet to discuss preparations
and steps already taken on the
"practical" neutrality front to keep
the United States out of the Euro
pean war, such as the operation of
the neutrality patrol.
Present were Secretary of State
Cordell Hull, Secretary of War
Harry Woodring, Acting Secretary
of the Navy Charles Edison, Secre
tary of Agriculture Henry A. Wal
lace, Secretary of Labor Frances
Perkins, and Attorney General
Frank Murphy.
PATROL OPERATING
Mr. Roosevelt said at his press
conference later that while he has
had no new information regarding
the presence of foreign submarines
near the American coast, the neu
trality patrol still is in full opera
tion and highly effective.
Prior to the meeting Mr. Roose
velt conferred with Senators Carl
Hayden, D., Ariz., and Francis T.
Maloney, D., Conn.
The conferences with the two
Senators came as informal polls on
Capitol Hill showed 52 Senators
committed or apparently for the ad
ministration plan; 25 either com
mitted against it or showing a tend
ency to lean toward the isolationist
side, and 19 still in the undecided
column.
