# French Repulse Surprise Drive
## German Troops Make Lauter River Attack 
### 
PARIS, Sept. 26 (UP). â€”German
troops today reached the French
front lines in a surprise attack along
the Lauter river about 13 miles west
of the Rhine but finally were driven
off in bitter hand-grenade fighting at
close range, according to military re
ports from the front.
The Germans, falling back under
the hand-grenade attack, were re
ported unofficially to have been cut
down by fire from French artillery
and only a small number were be
lieved to have reached the safety of
the Nazi lines.
In the broad plateau south of the
German communications centers of
Zweibruccken and Pirmascns west
of Wisscmbourg German heavy guns
opened a bombardment in an effort
to drive the Fench back from their
advance positions in the Horn val
ley where they menace a vital link
in the German Siegfied Line.
The French are close to the main
line of German fortifications at
Zweibruecken and it appeared the
Germans might be anticipating a
full-force French offense in that
sector.
Throughout the day French how
itzers hammered blockhouses and
artillery placements of the Siegfried
Line, firing over the heads of French
troops in advance positions in the
lower Vosges mountain sector cast
of the Saar basin.
French aerial photographs were
reported to have revealed several
sections of the Siegfried Line had
been "splintered" by the intense
French fire.
