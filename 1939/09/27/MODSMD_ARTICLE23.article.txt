# Hitler Throws Army to West
## Germans Mass Army In Defense Move 
### 
WITH THE GERMAN ARMY, on
the Western Front, Sept. 26 (UP).—
Germany today massed an army of
well over 1,000,000 men on the west
ern front, including crack units
shifted from the swift conquest of
Poland, to wage what probably will
be a purely defensive war.
A tour of 200 miles of fortifications
along teh German west wall—half of
them facing the Belgian and Luxem
i bourg borders—gave ample evidence
that Fuehrer Adolf Hitler's general
staff has no intention at present of
[ opening an offensive against the
I Allies.
The trip was made by five corre
! spondents, the first to see the west
i ern defenses, accompanied by gen
eral staff officers who answered
questions freely and enabled the
newspapermen to make closeup in
spections of numerous units of the
west wall.
WEST WALL MASSED
In one field three-quarters of a
mile wide and one and one-fourth
miles long were some 60 or 70 such
units. In the entire west wall were
said to be tens of thousands of them.
The impressions gained seemed to
j bear out what has been emphasized
I repeatedly and what officers accom
i panying the newspaper men con-
I tinued to emphasize, namely, that
! the west wall was planned and con
j structed as a defense barrier and as
i such will be tremendously difficult
I for the French and British forces to
1 conquer or even break through at
| any point.
Whether it is wholly impregnable,
| as the Germans claim, is something
i that only the actual test of battle
could show. But even to a layman it
; was obvious that a break in the
I wall would be at a great cost in
human lives.
I FORTIFICATION ENLARGED
The fortification line constantly is
I being enlarged and improved, and
i even today new construction was to
;be seen everywhere. Originally it
j was set up only opposite the French
frontier, but by order of Chancellor
Adolf Hitler it was extended north
to Holland and south to Switzerland.
It consists roughly of a front line
of individual defense units of con
crete and steel and first and second
! air defense zones bristling with anti
aircraft batteries, both fixed and
mobile.
At many points the wall is more
j than 30 miles deep.
The frontier regions we traversed
| tt)day were completely militarized,
although life in the villages and
| farms went on as nearly normally as
j possible under the circumstances.
Not only were the roads at some
j points jammed with anti-aircraft
I and anti-tank outfits, but exercising
| in the fields were machine gun and
: even artillery units.
Examination of the endless suc
j cession of concrete and steel em
' placements composing the west wall
(showed that the Germans took full
j advantage of every possible assis
tance nature offered them.
Most of the units are camouflaged
and many not perceptible from a
distance of even a few feet.
Some units arc disguised as farm
houses or barns.
