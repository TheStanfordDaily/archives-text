# Germany, Russia boldly Divide Poland, Scheme To Boss East Europe
## Nazi Minister Flies to Moscow To Make Plans 
### United Press 
Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia,
having carved up Poland and divid
ed it between them, today appeared
to be entering into a new deal to
spread their domination over all of
eastern Europe.
The deal may be sealed when
German Foreign Minister Joachim
von Ribbentrop and a coterie of
Nazi advisers arrives in Moscow by
airplane today to discuss what many
European reports say is a plan to
split the eastern half of Europe into
Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence.
RUMANIA FRIGHTENED
From Rumania, frightened by the
possibility that Russia may try to
take back her Bessarabia province
given to Rumania by the Allies after
the World War, it was reported that
the new Nazi-Soviet deal already
has been struck. Under it, accord
ing to these reports, Rumania and
the Balkans will come under the
Nazi sphere to aid Adolf Hitler's am
bition of a "drive to the cast" along
the Danube to the Black Sea.
Russia, it, was said in Bucharest,
will be given a free hand in the
little Baltic nations — step-children
of the last European war.
The Rumanian reports appeared to
be corroborated to a great extent in
London diplomatic circles.
If Hitler and Josef Stalin have
agreed upon a plan for joint domi
nation of eastern Europe it appears
that the Soviets arc moving quickly
into their allotted zone—with little
Esthonia as the first nation to feel
the effects of the deal. A Soviet,
communique last night revealed that
Soviet-Esthonian diplomatic con
tacts of recent days had reached an
acute stage.
RUSSIA SENDS DEMAND
Rumanian quarters heard that.
Russia had demanded that Esthonia
immediately disarm and dismantle
fortifications of three Esthonian
islands in the Bay of Finland. Soviet
troops were said to be massing along
Esthonia's border and it was an
nounced by the Moscow radio that
the Red fleet had been placed on a
war footing, with warships patrolling
waters off Esthonia and Finland.
The river Neva, which passes
through Leningrad into the White
Sea, was closed, barring Finnish
ships from the important communi
cations route.
The showdown in the Esthonian-
Russian dispute may come in Mos
cow today when the Esthonian for
eign minister, Dr. Karl Selter, re
turns there coincident with the. ar
rival of Ribbentrop.
Nazis in Berlin said that a discus
sion of final political settlements re
garding conquered Poland would
form the main theme of Ribbcn
trop's talks in Moscow.
