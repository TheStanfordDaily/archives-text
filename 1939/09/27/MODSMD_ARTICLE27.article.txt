''The Great Divide" by William
Vaughn Moody is to be presented
October 20 and 21 in Memorial Hall
as the Division of Speech and Dra
ma's season-opener, it was stated
yesterday by Professor Hubert Heff
m< r, new head of the department.
Written in 190(5 for Henry Miller,
"The Great Divide" was for many
ears considered "the great Ameri
can drama" by critics of the day.
it is essentially a problem drama,
showing the struggle between the
civilizations of the rugged Western
plains and the effete Eastern cities.
According to Mr. Heffner, the try

outs, to be held next Monday and
Tuesday from 3 to 5 o'clock in the
afternoon and from 7:30 to 9 o'clock
in the evening in room 2U5 of Me
morial Hall, will be completely open.
"We want everybody," emphasized
Mr. Heffner. "There is to be no
preference given students who are
registered in the Division of Speech
and Drama. Each part will be
awarded to the student who seems
best in the tryout."
Though "The Great Divide" is a
highly theatric play, the lines are
exciting and the plot well inte
grated, Mr. Heffner added.
There are parts available fur
eleven men and three women in the
play. The part of the Eastern girl
was played with great success by
famed actress Margaret Anglin.
The Division of Speech and Drama
plans to present two major produc
tions each quarter, and in addition
several studio productions are pro
jected, as well as lectures and ex
hibitions which will be given from
time to time during the year.
In addition to Professor Heffner,
who comes to Stanford from the
University of Minnesota, four other
new faculty members have been
added to the dramatics staff. They
are:
Elmer B. Mortensen, from the
University of lowa who is to be in
charge of debating; Thatcher Allred,
former head of the speech depart
ment at Weber College, Utah; George
Peavey, exchange professor from the
University of Hawaii; and Norman
Walsh, political science graduate.
