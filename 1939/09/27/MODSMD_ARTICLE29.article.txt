# PRICES MISQUOTED
## 
### 
In yesterday's College Bookshop
advertisement several prices were
misquoted. The used price of Ma-'
vor's "General Biology" should be
$2.75 instead of $1.75, the used
price for the lab set should be $2.20
instead of $2.00, and the retail price
for Anderson's "American Govern
ment" should be $3.75 instead of
$3.25.
