# Registration Hits All-time Highâ€”4207
## Enrollment Passes Lust Year's Total In First Two Days 
### 
Breaking the all-time enrollment
reeoid by 185, this year's registra
tion mark shows 4207 men and
women now have Stanford's new
beige-colored non-transferable stu
dent; body cards.
Of these, 2928 are men and 1279
are women. This indicates a slight
increase in the percentage of women
enrolled this year as compared with
last year's figures, according to J. P.
Mitchell, registrar.
PASSES \'JB TOTAL
Already the two-day total has sur
passed last year's complete enroll
ment of 4022. And the final figures
cannot be compiled until the end of
the week when non-penny-pinching
late registrants will be included.
From 8 to 5 o'clock yesterday the
Farm's 2842 old students plowed
through their reg booklets with the
dispatch of seasoned veterans. Some
were heard to express slight distress
at the "foreign address" innovation,
and one man obligingly replied with
a light-hearted "Timbuctoo."
INCREASE EXPLAINED
Since there has been no increase
in the freshman quotas, the jump in
figures may be explained by an in
crease of summer students who
stayed for regular session and the
admittance of a greater number of
junior transfers and graduate stu
dents.
In the two days of registration it
is figured that nearly half a million
dollars went across the counter in
"checks payable." Of course part of
this money will not be immediately
available since it was in tuition
notes.
