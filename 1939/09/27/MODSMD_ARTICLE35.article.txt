# Stanford Med Technicians Move to New Quarters
## 
### 
Technicians from the Stanford
School of Medicine are this week in
the process of moving into their new
$98,000 headquarters in San Fran
cisco.
The new structure, located oppo
site I he Stanford-Lane hospital, is
strictly modern in every detail. Fac
ing Clay Street it appears a mass of
glass, punctuated horizontally by
ribbons of steel and concrcte.
A problem was presented to
architects and engineers over the
matter of connecting the new build
ing with the hospital proper. The
difficulty was finally solved by con
struction of tunnel under and across
Clay Street.
Donated by Mrs. Louis Stern of
Palo Alto, the new structure was de
signed by Birge Clarke and David
Clark. Contracting was done by
Wells P. Goodenough of Palo Alto.
Extensive X-ray and technical
equipment is being moved into this
novelly constructed building. There
are six pairs of columns running

down the center of the building and
the side floors are cantilevered out
from the columns—thus anchoring
each floor from a central support and
avoiding the need for corner sup
ports.
Rooms of the building are separat
ed by what have been termed tem
porary partitions in order that the
present division of floor space may
be altered at any time. The building
now consists of a series of labora
tories and laboratory offices.
