# Roosevelt Asks Foreign Powers Halt Purchases
## U.S. Seeks to Stop Inroads on Vital Domestic Supplies 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2(5 (26).—
President Roosevelt hinted today
that the United States government
would appreciate a cessation of for
eign purchases of strategic war ma
terials, which have impeded this
country's program of building up its
own reserve stock of such materials.
He said that unnamed foreign
powers have been bidding in the
open markets for American sup
plies of the vital materials, thus im
peding the War Department's drive
to acquire sufficient domestic stores
to carry the United States through
an emergency.
The critical materials, he told his
press conference, include manganese,
crube rubber, high-grade manga
nese, ferro-manganese, pig tin, met
allurgical chrome and other min
erals.
PROGRAM HAMPERED
Secretary of War Harry H. Wood
ring and Acting Secretary of the
Navy Charles A. Edison, he said,
have informed him that attempts by
foreign purchasers to acquire the
strategic materials have hampered
the self-sufficiency program, which
was instituted last spring.
Congress authorized $100,000,000
for the raw materials acquisitions
phase of the multi-billion dollar
national defense program. Mr. Roo
sevelt made $10,000,000 immediately
available for initiation of the drive.
The Treasury asked for bids on
manganese, tungsten and chromium
and manila fiber. The first three
materials are essential in the manu
facture of durable steel, and domes
tic supplies of all are decidedly in
sufficient to meet wartime needs, ac
according to experts attached to the
United States Bureau of Mines.
SUPPLIES NEEDED
Because domestic supplies are
needed for this country's use, Mr.
Roosevelt said, he hoped foreign
purchasers would stop their pro
curement efforts of their own voli
tion.
He added cryptically, however,
that he is calling the attention of
executives in a position to control
such transaction to the existing situ
ation. He implied that the mere rec
ognition of the situation would be
sufficient, but some observers be
lieved that his statement meant ac
cess by foreign purchasers to the
materials involved might be cut off
if their acquisitions continue.

if their acquisitions continue.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2(5 (26).—
President Roosevelt hinted today
that the United States government
would appreciate a cessation of for
eign purchases of strategic war ma
terials, which have impeded this
country's program of building up its
own reserve stock of such materials.
He said that unnamed foreign
powers have been bidding in the
open markets for American sup
plies of the vital materials, thus im
peding the War Department's drive
to acquire sufficient domestic stores
to carry the United States through
an emergency.
The critical materials, he told his
press conference, include manganese,
crube rubber, high-grade manga
nese, ferro-manganese, pig tin, met
allurgical chrome and other min
erals.
PROGRAM HAMPERED
Secretary of War Harry H. Wood
ring and Acting Secretary of the
Navy Charles A. Edison, he said,
have informed him that attempts by
foreign purchasers to acquire the
strategic materials have hampered
the self-sufficiency program, which
was instituted last spring.
Congress authorized $100,000,000
for the raw materials acquisitions
phase of the multi-billion dollar
national defense program. Mr. Roo
sevelt made $10,000,000 immediately
available for initiation of the drive.
The Treasury asked for bids on
manganese, tungsten and chromium
and manila fiber. The first three
materials are essential in the manu
facture of durable steel, and domes
tic supplies of all are decidedly in
sufficient to meet wartime needs, ac
according to experts attached to the
United States Bureau of Mines.
SUPPLIES NEEDED
Because domestic supplies are
needed for this country's use, Mr.
Roosevelt said, he hoped foreign
purchasers would stop their pro
curement efforts of their own voli
tion.
He added cryptically, however,
that he is calling the attention of
executives in a position to control
such transaction to the existing situ
ation. He implied that the mere rec
ognition of the situation would be
sufficient, but some observers be
lieved that his statement meant ac
cess by foreign purchasers to the
materials involved might be cut off
if their acquisitions continue.
