## Reds Split with Cards; Rookie Thompson Snaps St. Louis Victory String Wallers Slated to Take Mound Today as Cincinnati Tries to Cinch First Pennant in Twenty Years 
### 
CINCINNATI, 0., Sept. 26 (Cl'). â€”The Cincinnati Reds broke even with
the St. Louis Cardinals today in a cut-throat double-header and moved
within one jump of clinching the National League pennant. Behind Gene;
Thompson's brilliant pitching the Reds won the opener, 3-1, hut the Car- j
dinals rallied behind Morton Cooper to capture the second game, (5-0.
The Reds can clinch their first pennant in 20 years by beating the Car- |
(finals either tomorrow or Thursday, and they confidently expect to re-

move all mathematical doubt by
sending their ace, Bitcky Walters,
victorious in 27 games, at the Cardi
nals for the game clincher tomorrow.
Walters has beaten the Cards four
out of five times this season. He will
be opposed by Fiddler Bill McGee.
Wily Bill McKechnie gambled to
day on Gene Thompson, freshman
luirler who last year pitched for the
Class B Columbia Sally League club,
and he came through in superb
fashion. Pitching his way out of two
tough jams, Thompson triumphed in
the opener to extend the Reds' win
ning streak to eight straight. In
letting the Cards down with nine
hits he snapped St. Louis' seven
game winning streak.
THOMPSON SURPRISES
The throng of 34,194 was sur
prised when the 22-year-old Thomp
son started to warm up. Bucky Wal
ters had been slated to hurl the
opener despite the fact that he
pitched and won his sixth straight on
Saturday. After the twin bill Mc-
Kechnie revealed that he planned
to pitch Walters in the second
game only if the Reds lost the
opener.
After Thompson's victory Mc-
Kechnie again gambled and started
Lee Grissom, erratic southpaw who
has won only one game since July 4,
and he overplayed his hand. Gris
som was hammered out of the box
in the first frame when five of the
six men who faced him reached
base.
MYERS IN HERO ROLE
Hero of the Reds' triumph was
Billy Myers who slugged Curt Davis
for the game-winning homer in the
second inning with two mates on
base. After Lombardi had doubled
over Slaughter's head in right and
Craft had .singled, Myers hit his
homer which bounded off the lop
of the concrete wall in left field.
Davis was derricked after the Reds
had rapped out five hits in the
second. Shoun, Bowman, Warneke,
and Weiland finished the Cards'
pitching job as Blades juggled his
lineup frequently for pinch hitters.
The Reds made a total of 12 hits,
with Frey, Lombardi, Berger, Mc-
Cormick, and Thompson making a
pair each.
