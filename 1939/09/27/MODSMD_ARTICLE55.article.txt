# Soccer Varsity Returns En Masse
## 
### 
Hopes for a bang-up varsity soc
i cer team this year rose yesterday
I as all of last year's varsity soccer-
I men returned to sign up. Coach
! Harry Maloney reports that 17 of
j his experienced players have re
j ported so far, and so many men have
applied that he has had lo turn
some down. The total number of
sign-ups so far is 40, which is all
that can be handled this season.
Coach Maloney believes that the
J team should have a good season with
I so many experienced players in the
j line-up. The team will have a fur
j ther inducement to win the inter-
I collegiate soccer championship, since
an old friend of Maloney's who takes
an active interest in soccer has of
fered to give the team a banquet and
each member a gold pin at the end
of the season if it wins the cham
pionship.
Frosh soccer is an unknown quan
tity so far. Thirty frosh have signed
i up, but little will be known about
I them until after the first practice
this afternoon.
j Varsity soccermen will receive
, their equipment and have their first
| practice Thursday afternoon, ac
! cording to Coach Maloney.
