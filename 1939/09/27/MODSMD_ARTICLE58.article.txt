Prepping for their initial tilt
j against the unknown quantity of I
J Modesto Jaysee, Coach Hairy Ship
| key's frosh footballers yesterday I
ran through regular scrimmages and j
| punt sctimmages.
Commenting on the condition of j
j the team as a whole, Assistant Coach i
j Louis Tsoutsouvas said that .since j
j the recession of the local heat wave j
I the boys have been showing a lot
more spirit and fire and have been ]
improving steadily. Since the cam- 1
j pus population has increased some !
| spectators have been haunting the |
I field, having a further lifting effect
on the players' attitudes.
In their prelim to the var.sity-
Oregcn State game this coming Sat- I

urday it is expected that Shipkey
wdl use as many fellows as he can
in an effort to get the best working
combinations for his first- itnd sec
ond-string teams.
Shinkey restated his former stand
that his boys are going out to win
and to play the best kind of ball that
they know how.
Probable first-string lineups at
the present time will see Hank Nor
herg and Ed Stamm holding down
the end posts; George Robinson and
Bruno Banducchi at tackles; Ed Mc-
Cain and Dick Palmer at guards; and
Bill Mannon at the center spot.
The backfield will see Al Cole and
Eric Armstrong in the halfback po
sition;: with Milt Vucinich at full and
Charley Taylor at quarter.
