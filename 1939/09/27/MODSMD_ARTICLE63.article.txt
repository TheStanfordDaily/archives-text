# Frank Albert Will Play Saturday
## Back Expected Out Tomorrow 
### 
"Nothing serious."
That wits the reassuring phrase Don Licbendorfer gave in explanation
of Frankie Albert's unexpected trip to the hospital Monday night.
Alter looking at X-rays of the pass-slinging halfback's insides, the'
medicos decided yesti rda\ that Albert was sutlering from nothing more

serious than a bruise in the region
of the solar plexus. Dr. Roth, team
physician, says that Albert will be
ready to don a suit and report for
practice tomorrow, and will most
probably be able to start against
Oregon State in Saturday's season
opener.
TEAM- SCRIMMAGES
Tiny Thornhill wound up yester
day's practice session by sending
ibe entire squad, minus Albert,
through a smashing offensive scrim
mage. Jim Verdiek, San Bernardino
transfer who was All-Southern Cali
fornia Junior College center before
coming to Stanford, took over the
center post on (lie first team during
the scrimmage. -This shift would
seem to indicate that he has gained
an edge over sophomore Colin Mc-
Clintock in the battle that has been
going on since practice started.
Verdiek is several pounds lighter
than McClintock, and a bit shorter,
but his experience may land him the
starting assignment against the Bea
vers from Corvallis.
TACKLES DOUBTFUL
The tackle positions are still some
thing of a mystery, and Tiny is the
only one who has any idea about
who will fill them Saturday. Stan
Andersen and Swede Johansen were
ticketed for them, and are doing
a good job of teaching members of
the present Big Red Machine the
finer points. Hamilton, remembered
as the man who mopped up for the
Vowing Sophs has been spending a
lot of time with Jim Groves on the
dummy. Hoos was also well-known
for his ability to lower the boom on
a defensive fullback.
Norm Standlee, "The Chief,"
starred in the ball-carrying depait
ment yesterday, and appeared to be
fully recovered from a knee injury
that bothered him last week.
Only three drill sessions remain
before Saturday's game, and no more
contact work is slated, although
Thornhill may decide to give the
squad another heavy workout.
