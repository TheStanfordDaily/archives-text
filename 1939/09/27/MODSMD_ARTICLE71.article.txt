# Intramural Football Teams Open '39 'Amateur' Roster
## 
### 
The cull goes out today for competitors in Stanford's intramural sports
program. With three teams already signed up for each, touch football,
golf, and volleyball, and two teams ready to vie for the horseshoe pitching
championship. Intramural Manager Andy Stojkovich looks forward to an
other fast intramural sports season. While Stojkovich is doing his part

for the Stanford football team, Ken-'
ny Davidson, Indian cage star, will
take over the duties of intramural
manager.
According to Manager Stojkovich,
actual work will get under way next
Monday if enough teams have signed
up by the end of this week. To
date El Toro, Delta Upsilon, and Phi
Kappa Sigma are the only organiza
tions which have entered teams.
With football fever running high
throughout the nation, touch foot
ball naturally steals the spotlight on
the intramural program for the fall
quarter. Delta Chi, defending their
grid championship for the third
consecutive year, will field another
strong team, and with pass-tossing
Freddie Baker as their spark-plug,
they loom as a good bet to make it
three in a row. Last season's run
ners-up, Sigma Chi, also promises
to be right in there when the last
whistle blows.
On the golf course it will be Sigma
Chi defending its crown, while Al
pha Delta Phi and Phi Delta Phi
will be working to retain their re
spective titles in volleyball and
horseshoes.

A Hillsdale, Mich., college sent out
$3,000 in dollar bills and asked they
be returned with whatever increase
they might earn. At last reports
more than half had been returned
with additional money.
