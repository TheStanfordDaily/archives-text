### JERRY MAYER 
MORALE STRONG
CARDS NOT SCARED
A southern California sports
weekly picks Stanford to finish in a
tie for fifth place in the 1938 Pa
cific Coast Conference race. The all
around strength of ihe teams is de
termined by a chart in which each
outfit is given a numerical rating in
the various departments of the game
—such as first team personnel, re
serves, speed, blocking, kicking, pass
defense, and several others. The
teams are picked to finish according
to their total number of points.
Having Stanford picked to finish in
a tie for fifth shouldn't injure the
feelings of Cardinal fans; it'll give
them a chance to gloat if the Reds
do better, and they won't have to
make excuses if they do worse.
But when Stanford is given only
30 points out of a possible 100 in
"morale," it makes one slightly
angry. A note is added, "Coach
under lire." to explain the low rat
ing. This implies the Indian grid
dcrs are entering the season
with drooping spirits, inferiority
complexes, and lack of confidence
in their coaching staff. It is a pic
ture of fear-stricken young men
cowering before the prospects of a
long, hard-hitting season.
If the compiler of this chart
would wander into practice sessions
going on in the Farm, he might be
amazed—and would undoubtedly be
embarrassed by the misinformation
he is passing out.
Stanford's morale has never been
better. Practically the whole team
to a man is solid behind Tiny Thorn
hill, and the close competition at
most of the positions is keeping
every player on his toes. No matter
how much or how little the Cards
have shown so far. morals has been
their long suit. How about a 90 or a
100 in morale, Mr. Maxwell Stiles?
We're not too angry at the writer,
however, because in his article ac
companying the chart he says: "It is
the writer's opinion that if any team
has been under-rated, that team is
Stanford."
U.C.L.A. MAD AT lIYLAND—
SO ARE WE
Dick Hyland, one of the lightest,
toughest backfield men in Stanford
grid history, is on the pan down at
U.C.L.A. It seems Dick is writing a
daily column for one of the Los An
geles papers and proposed to bring
to his readers a picture of each team
in the conference.
When Dick came to U.C.L.A. he
printed an "expose" of the Bruin
offense under its new coach, "Babe"
Horrell. He included diagrams of
two of Horrell's plays, two plays
which, incidentally, were of a confi
dential nature. The Bruins didn't
get mad, however, until the next day
when Hyland printed an "expose" of
the U.S.C. team.
The "expose" of the U.S.C. team
consisted of an article devoted en
tirely to Doyle Nave, the unsung
Trojan quarterback, who passed
Troy to a Rose Bowl victory last
January 1. There was nothing
about Howard Jones' system—no
confidential diagrams. *
So Coach Babe Horrell is sizzl

| ing. Note—the two plays dia
grammed by Hyland were chang
ed, so rival coaches need not howl
each other over in their haste to
get hold of the charts.
Although we were only amused
by the little episode down south,
it hit closer to home and we got
sore when Hyland slapped a quick
uppercut at Stanford,
The gist of Dick's article was thai
J he couldn't see how Stanford could
possibly be rated a contender for (he
championship, pointing out that the
Cards had gone through a stretch of
five conference games scoring only
one touchdown last year. That was
okay, because it was the truth,
j But when Dick completely de
preciated the great game the Cards
j put up against Cal, and the upset
I victory over Dartmouth—it wasn't
| okay. Absolutely no conclusion can
j be drawn from any Big Game, as
, serted Dick, because each team is at
! its highest mental pitch, a situation
which often allows the inferior team
to make a better showing than the
superior one.
Dartmouth's reputation was built
on a rickety foundation, he further
claims, because the Big Green team
plays only the Ivy Colleges of the
East who are still living ofT their
reputations built up in the '90's. The
Dartmouths are set-ups for any fair
ly good team from outside their own
sector, says the ex-Stanford great.
It's nice to know that Hyland con
sidered Stanford "a fairly good
team" at the end of last year.
Maybe if Dick had been back in
his uniform last year trying to stop
Bob MacLeod, all-American and
now a star professional player, he
might give Dartmouth — and Stan
ford—a little more credit. And Mac-
Leod wasn't the only tough man in
the eastern outfit.
Move over U.C.L.A., and let a
good school get mad.

ture of fear-stricken young men
cowering before the prospects of a
long, hard-hitting season.
If the compiler of this chart
would wander into practice sessions
going on in the Farm, he might be
amazed—and would undoubtedly be
embarrassed by the misinformation

Stanford's morale has never been
better. Practically the whole team
to a man is solid behind Tiny Thorn
hill, and the close competition at
most of the positions is keeping
every player on his toes. No matter
how much or how little the Cards
have shown so far. morals has been
their long suit. How about a 90 or a
100 in morale, Mr. Maxwell Stiles?
We're not too angry at the writer,

the writer's opinion that if any team

Stanford."
U.C.L.A. MAD AT lIYLAND—
SO ARE WE
Dick Hyland, one of the lightest,
toughest backfield men in Stanford
grid history, is on the pan down at
U.C.L.A. It seems Dick is writing a
daily column for one of the Los An
geles papers and proposed to bring
to his readers a picture of each team
in the conference.
When Dick came to U.C.L.A. he
printed an "expose" of the Bruin
offense under its new coach, "Babe"
Horrell. He included diagrams of
two of Horrell's plays, two plays
which, incidentally, were of a confi
dential nature. The Bruins didn't
get mad, however, until the next day
when Hyland printed an "expose" of
the U.S.C. team.
The "expose" of the U.S.C. team
consisted of an article devoted en
tirely to Doyle Nave, the unsung
Trojan quarterback, who passed
Troy to a Rose Bowl victory last
January 1. There was nothing
about Howard Jones' system—no
confidential diagrams. *
So Coach Babe Horrell is sizzl

| ing. Note—the two plays dia
grammed by Hyland were chang
ed, so rival coaches need not howl
each other over in their haste to
get hold of the charts.
Although we were only amused
by the little episode down south,
it hit closer to home and we got
sore when Hyland slapped a quick
uppercut at Stanford,
The gist of Dick's article was thai
J he couldn't see how Stanford could
possibly be rated a contender for (he
championship, pointing out that the
Cards had gone through a stretch of
five conference games scoring only
one touchdown last year. That was
okay, because it was the truth,
j But when Dick completely de
preciated the great game the Cards
j put up against Cal, and the upset
I victory over Dartmouth—it wasn't
| okay. Absolutely no conclusion can
j be drawn from any Big Game, as
, serted Dick, because each team is at
! its highest mental pitch, a situation
which often allows the inferior team
to make a better showing than the
superior one.
Dartmouth's reputation was built
on a rickety foundation, he further
claims, because the Big Green team
plays only the Ivy Colleges of the
East who are still living ofT their
reputations built up in the '90's. The
Dartmouths are set-ups for any fair
ly good team from outside their own
sector, says the ex-Stanford great.
It's nice to know that Hyland con
sidered Stanford "a fairly good
team" at the end of last year.
Maybe if Dick had been back in
his uniform last year trying to stop
Bob MacLeod, all-American and
now a star professional player, he
might give Dartmouth — and Stan
ford—a little more credit. And Mac-
Leod wasn't the only tough man in
the eastern outfit.
Move over U.C.L.A., and let a
good school get mad.
MORALE STRONG
CARDS NOT SCARED
A southern California sports
weekly picks Stanford to finish in a
tie for fifth place in the 1938 Pa
cific Coast Conference race. The all
around strength of ihe teams is de
termined by a chart in which each
outfit is given a numerical rating in
the various departments of the game
—such as first team personnel, re
serves, speed, blocking, kicking, pass
defense, and several others. The
teams are picked to finish according
to their total number of points.
Having Stanford picked to finish in
a tie for fifth shouldn't injure the
feelings of Cardinal fans; it'll give
them a chance to gloat if the Reds
do better, and they won't have to
make excuses if they do worse.
But when Stanford is given only
30 points out of a possible 100 in
"morale," it makes one slightly
angry. A note is added, "Coach
under lire." to explain the low rat
ing. This implies the Indian grid
dcrs are entering the season

complexes, and lack of confidence

U.C.L.A. It seems Dick is writing a
daily column for one of the Los An
geles papers and proposed to bring
to his readers a picture of each team
in the conference.
When Dick came to U.C.L.A. he
printed an "expose" of the Bruin
offense under its new coach, "Babe"
Horrell. He included diagrams of
two of Horrell's plays, two plays
which, incidentally, were of a confi
dential nature. The Bruins didn't
get mad, however, until the next day
when Hyland printed an "expose" of
the U.S.C. team.
The "expose" of the U.S.C. team
consisted of an article devoted en
tirely to Doyle Nave, the unsung
Trojan quarterback, who passed
Troy to a Rose Bowl victory last
January 1. There was nothing
about Howard Jones' system—no
confidential diagrams. *
So Coach Babe Horrell is sizzl

| ing. Note—the two plays dia
grammed by Hyland were chang
ed, so rival coaches need not howl
each other over in their haste to
get hold of the charts.
Although we were only amused
by the little episode down south,
it hit closer to home and we got
sore when Hyland slapped a quick
uppercut at Stanford,
The gist of Dick's article was thai
J he couldn't see how Stanford could
possibly be rated a contender for (he
championship, pointing out that the
Cards had gone through a stretch of
five conference games scoring only
one touchdown last year. That was
okay, because it was the truth,
j But when Dick completely de
preciated the great game the Cards
j put up against Cal, and the upset
I victory over Dartmouth—it wasn't
| okay. Absolutely no conclusion can
j be drawn from any Big Game, as
, serted Dick, because each team is at
! its highest mental pitch, a situation
which often allows the inferior team
to make a better showing than the
superior one.
Dartmouth's reputation was built
on a rickety foundation, he further
claims, because the Big Green team
plays only the Ivy Colleges of the
East who are still living ofT their
reputations built up in the '90's. The
Dartmouths are set-ups for any fair
ly good team from outside their own
sector, says the ex-Stanford great.
It's nice to know that Hyland con
sidered Stanford "a fairly good
team" at the end of last year.
Maybe if Dick had been back in
his uniform last year trying to stop
Bob MacLeod, all-American and
now a star professional player, he
might give Dartmouth — and Stan
ford—a little more credit. And Mac-
Leod wasn't the only tough man in
the eastern outfit.
Move over U.C.L.A., and let a
good school get mad.
MORALE STRONG
CARDS NOT SCARED
A southern California sports
weekly picks Stanford to finish in a
tie for fifth place in the 1938 Pa
cific Coast Conference race. The all
around strength of ihe teams is de
termined by a chart in which each
outfit is given a numerical rating in
the various departments of the game
—such as first team personnel, re
serves, speed, blocking, kicking, pass
defense, and several others. The
teams are picked to finish according
to their total number of points.
Having Stanford picked to finish in
a tie for fifth shouldn't injure the
feelings of Cardinal fans; it'll give
them a chance to gloat if the Reds
do better, and they won't have to
make excuses if they do worse.
But when Stanford is given only
30 points out of a possible 100 in
"morale," it makes one slightly
angry. A note is added, "Coach
under lire." to explain the low rat
ing. This implies the Indian grid
dcrs are entering the season
with drooping spirits, inferiority
complexes, and lack of confidence
in their coaching staff. It is a pic
ture of fear-stricken young men
cowering before the prospects of a
long, hard-hitting season.
If the compiler of this chart
would wander into practice sessions
going on in the Farm, he might be
amazed—and would undoubtedly be
embarrassed by the misinformation
he is passing out.
Stanford's morale has never been
better. Practically the whole team
to a man is solid behind Tiny Thorn
hill, and the close competition at
most of the positions is keeping
every player on his toes. No matter
how much or how little the Cards
have shown so far. morals has been
their long suit. How about a 90 or a
100 in morale, Mr. Maxwell Stiles?
We're not too angry at the writer,
however, because in his article ac
companying the chart he says: "It is
the writer's opinion that if any team
has been under-rated, that team is
Stanford."
