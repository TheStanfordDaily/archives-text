# Boxers Lacking In Light Classes
## Couch Frye Greeted By Few Good Mittmen 
### 
Boxing Coach Clayton Frye, with
several good mittmen returning, is
looking forward to his third season
at the farm with only one complaint:
the extreme scarcity of candidates in
the lighter weights. The bantam
weight spot on the varsity team is
completely open, and only one or two
men are returning for some of the
other midget divisions.
Bruce Berg will probably be back
to fill the featherweight position,
and Johnny Wilson, a veteran from
last year, is a lightweight who is
expected to don gloves when things
get under way over in the rope
skipping division of Encina Gym.
WELTEIt\\ EIGHT KETUKNS
Jack Rice, rugged welterweight
who was very successful last year
in the squared circle of the Pavilion,
will be back. Coach Frye already
looks on him as one of the best men
of his weight in coast boxing cir
cles. Rice isn't as polished a boxer
as Bill Wilber, who has graduated,
but he packs a solid punch, and is
built for endurance.
Doug Grant and Ed Stein will be
back to take care of the 165-pound
class. Stein, a junior this fall, with
continued experience should develop
into a thoroughly capable boxer.
The middleweight division is just
about open to all comers. Yank
Levin will be strongest candidate
for the light heavy position.
WARD DROPS OUT
Johnny Ward, sensational heavy
weight of the past season, will not
be in school fall quarter. Bill Greer
has grown up to the unlimited divi
sion from the lightheavy.
Coach Frye will give both begin
ning and advanced instruction in the
art of self defense during fall
quarter, which may be taken as a
physical education course. Those
with ability, who want to try for the
boxing squad, may be moved up
from these classes.
