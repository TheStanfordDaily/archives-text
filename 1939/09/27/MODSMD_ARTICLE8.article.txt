# Typical Frosh Woman Seeks Good Looking Farm Male
## 
### 
"Have I any good looking
boys wandering around? No, find
me one. No. no, I take it all back."
It was the voice of the Farm's typical
freshman woman, Jane Collyer,
ringing jokingly above the tumult
and din of the SOO registering fresh
men.
Two photographers and a Daily
staff member set out last Monday,
registration day, to find and reveal
to the Stanford world the most typ
ical frosh woman and man. Bob
Griswold. a not-too-clean and not
too-dirty Santa Monica man was
plucked from the mob as Jane's
partner in crime.
"What? You want my history,
past, present, and future," Jane
laughed. "This is a little embarrass
ing but. well, I'm 18, 5 feet 4 and I
have hazel eyes." She smiled again
to conceal a feeling of confusion.
"I've been living in Palo Alto for
the last hri ; years. You see, my
mother to Stanford, so it was
only n, '.hat I should want to
come 1 Farm ever since—oh,
ever .si n remember."
JANE iii AK UP
Shelled i barrage of common
place, i ped questions, Miss
Collyei bur in wonderfully, meet
ing eac : with a good natured,
humort I still intelligent an
swer. Wh.ii >. is going to be her
probablt Why, she plans to
become ■ icher and by way of
preparat i has been counseling
at a can luring the past summer.
How wot >he vote on the Ham and
Eggs question? No. because she be
lieves that you can't get money out
of nowhere.

"As for this registration business,"
Jane continued, "I think the system
is as efficient as can be expected, but
a little confusing. My adviser, Mr,
Farmer—he's a riot—has arranged
a swell program for me. I'm taking
14 units, with only one 8 o'clock and
no Saturday classes.
MENTIONS GRIPES
In her own campus complaint de
partment, Miss Collyer mentioned
two little "private gripes." Her first
complaint was that at rally meetings
the yell leaders never lead two
cheers in succession, with the result
that the crowd no sooner got warmed
up than they were forced to sit in
silence again and listen to another
speaker; and secondly, she had re
ceived no pre-registration issue of
the Daily.
"What do I think of blue jeans on
the men?" Jane concluded. Well, it
all depends upon the creature they're
on."
We left Miss Collyer and turned
to Bob Griswold, who was waiting
in a very typical position with a
hundred other students for one of
the ten seat cards in Chemistry 10.
"I soi't of figured on taking Biology,"
he began with a smile, "but. 'they'
decided that chemistry would be
best for me. I probably will major
in engineering." The last is a typ
ical remark.
