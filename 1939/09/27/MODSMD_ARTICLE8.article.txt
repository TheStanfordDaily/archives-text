# Typical Frosh Woman Seeks Good Looking Farm Male
## 
### 
"Have I any good looking
boys wandering around? No, find
me one. No. no, I take it all back."
It was the voice of the Farm's typical
freshman woman, Jane Collyer,
ringing jokingly above the tumult
and din of the SOO registering fresh
men.
Two photographers and a Daily
staff member set out last Monday,
registration day, to find and reveal
to the Stanford world the most typ
ical frosh woman and man. Bob
Griswold. a not-too-clean and not
too-dirty Santa Monica man was
plucked from the mob as Jane's
partner in crime.
"What? You want my history,
past, present, and future," Jane
laughed. "This is a little embarrass
ing but. well, I'm 18, 5 feet 4 and I
have hazel eyes." She smiled again
to conceal a feeling of confusion.
"I've been living in Palo Alto for
the last hri ; years. You see, my
mother to Stanford, so it was
only n, '.hat I should want to
come 1 Farm ever since—oh,
ever .si n remember."
JANE iii AK UP
Shelled i barrage of common
place, i ped questions, Miss
Collyei bur in wonderfully, meet
ing eac : with a good natured,
humort I still intelligent an
swer. Wh.ii >. is going to be her
probablt Why, she plans to
become ■ icher and by way of
preparat i has been counseling
at a can luring the past summer.
How wot >he vote on the Ham and
Eggs question? No. because she be
lieves that you can't get money out
of nowhere.

"As for this registration business,"
Jane continued, "I think the system
is as efficient as can be expected, but
a little confusing. My adviser, Mr,
Farmer—he's a riot—has arranged
a swell program for me. I'm taking
14 units, with only one 8 o'clock and
no Saturday classes.
MENTIONS GRIPES
In her own campus complaint de
partment, Miss Collyer mentioned
two little "private gripes." Her first
complaint was that at rally meetings
the yell leaders never lead two
cheers in succession, with the result
that the crowd no sooner got warmed
up than they were forced to sit in
silence again and listen to another
speaker; and secondly, she had re
ceived no pre-registration issue of
the Daily.
"What do I think of blue jeans on
the men?" Jane concluded. Well, it
all depends upon the creature they're
on."
We left Miss Collyer and turned
to Bob Griswold, who was waiting
in a very typical position with a
hundred other students for one of
the ten seat cards in Chemistry 10.
"I soi't of figured on taking Biology,"
he began with a smile, "but. 'they'
decided that chemistry would be
best for me. I probably will major
in engineering." The last is a typ
ical remark.
GIVES DESCRIPTION
"Physically speaking —as you
might call it—l'm 18, 5 feet 11 inches
tall, and I have blue eyes. Intel
lectually speaking I graduated from
Santa Monica High School. That is
my home town. As for the aptitude
test, I thought it was pretty easy
even though I had trouble with that
stuff about the religion of India."
Bob continued his pleasant chat
ting and answering, stepping forward
from time to time in order to keep
his place in the line which was
shortening none too rapidly. He con
fessed that he was the first of his
"Griswold tribe" ever to come to
the Farm. He once had considered
California but after comparing the
two campuses he decided to come to
Stanford. He also would vote "No"
on the Ham and Eggs question.
"No, I'm not playing football here
at Stanford, but I plan to go but for
baseball this winter. I'm also tak
ing R.O.T.C. because of the present
war condition and because it is a
generally good subject to know. And
as for those complaints you asked
about, I really can't find much
wrong except that my bed sags
something awful in the middle. But
I've got. it wired up pretty well."
DOES AERIAL WORK
Like Jane, Bob also worked this
summer, not at a girl's camp but at
the Douglas Airplane plant, in the
engineering department. He wasn't
certain whether he would seek em
ployment here at Stanford but he
might like to work later 011 in the
year.
"Sure, I've got a couple of girls
back in Santa Monica," Bob termi
nated the interview, looking down at
the floor. "As to whether I will be
faithful or not—that depends. I've
seen a few girls here I sure would
like to meet."
