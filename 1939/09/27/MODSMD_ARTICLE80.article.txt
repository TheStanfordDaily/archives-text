# Pay to the Order of.. Alma Mater

### 
THIS morning more than 4,000 Stanford stu
dents woke up with $115 missing from their
pocketbooks. Most of them didn't realize this
until they found that they did not have quite
enough small change to pay their breakfast
checks at the Cellar. And when they did, they
growled and their minds filled with visions of
storm clouds and "Please Make All Checks
Payable" signs.
These people were enjoying the idea of per
sonal martyrdom far too well to jerk their minds
back to reality and to analyze the real value of
a Stanford education, complete with laboratory
courses, library facilities, and all-night poker
games.
It has been said often and truly about many
schools that the value of their teaching cannot
be reduced to the crass terms of dollars and
cents. This statement is more meaningful at
Stanford than it is at almost any other institution,
for here the student can learn not only Western
Civ. and biochemistry and a thousand other
academic subjects, but also the technique of
living with other people, of following leaders,
and of leading followers.
The size of this student body gives the double
edged advantage of stimulating competition and
at the same time insuring that real ability will
not be lost in the crowd. Nowhere is the young
man or woman given a fairer chance to develop
to the limits of his or her potentialities. Stanford
passes judgment not on the basis of who you
are, but rather on what you do.
The student handing his check for $115 to
the lady with the rubber stamp is making his
cash investment in the University. Whether he
receives dividends, large or small or any at all,
is entirely up to him. Opportunities for every
type of intellectual pursuit, for physical devel
opment, for experience in leadership and ad
ministration are offered to him when he pays
his fee. He may take or leave them as he
chooses.
Alma Mater is offering her children four
years of training for life at a bargain price. The
wise investor will buy before the market rises.
