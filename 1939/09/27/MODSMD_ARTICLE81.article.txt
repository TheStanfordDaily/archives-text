# Stanford in the Air
## 
### 
AVIATION Ground School 1, MTWTh at 7
o'clock, 4 units, newest addition to the Stan
ford catalogue, meets for the first time tonight.
More than just another new course with a
name more interesting than usual, Aviation 1
from its first meeting will be Stanford's part in
the nation-wide Civil Aeronautics Authority
program to train 20,000 new fliers at govern
ment expense.
The ostensible purpose is to create a vast re
serve of civilians reasonably grounded in the
elements of aviation and able to fly a plane,
who can be called upon to defend this country
in the air.
The necessity of American preparedness is
obvious today. Stanford can and will play a
rightfully vital part in this large-scale plan to
build a civilian reserve army.
When government inspectors first began look
ing for possible sites for the new air schools,
Stanford came into consideration because of
past excellence in aviation practice. The Flying
Club has held the national Grover Leoning
award for two years. The choice was carefully
made, and this University can be proud to take
part.
No one in this country wants war. War is still
a long way off. But if we are called upon to
fight, it will be best to fight efficiently and effec
tively.
And Stanford students should be prepared to
take positions of leadership. Presumably the
upper portion of our social structure, college
students can best serve in the capacity of offi
cers, not as soldiers in the line.
Training them in the use of warfare's newest
and most effective weapon, though an unpleas
ant thought, is very probably the most effective
strategy. J. B.
