V'AZIS SMASH MAGINOT LINE! BOMBING OF
CHILDREN TOLD!
The Allies have valiantly held of! the regimented
might of Fascism for two years. But slowly the great
heart of democracy is breaking. Hitler-terror will
sweep France, subjugate England, and send an expedi
tionary force to the Americas. World civilization is
periled. Our blood-brothers are dying in defense of
liberty. Why stand we here idle?
Oh, I don't believe all that. You know all the propa
ganda they fed us last time: babies' hands cut. off, Bel
gian priests hung by their feet in church bells. It's
exaggerated.
* * *
Exaggerated? Can the fall of democracy be an ex
aggeration? Come out of your Ivory Tower, brother!
Hitler is burning the world.
AMERICAN LINER, SUNK BY SUB! BRUTALI
TIES TO PASSENGERS, REPORT!
Six leading American statesmen, all former neu
trality leaders, today condemned as an act of war
Germany's crass violation of American shipping rights.
Eye-witnesses swear that a Nazi U-boat was respon
sible for sinking the United States sailing ship War
Supplisia without warning. Fifty drowned.
I don't get excited over all this war hysteria. They're
just trying to drag us into Europe. What business have
wc in a war that was sewn by English-dominated im
perialism and nurtured in a hypocritical European
diplomacy that made speeches while it supported
Fascism economically—a war whose only harvest can
be destruction, with its chief accomplishment the plow
ing of another fertile field for tyrannies. Let's see that
our own democracy is secure—politically and econom
ically. The last war didn't help democracy much.
Do-nothing philosophies aren't worth much when
your house is on fire. This is civilization's last stand.
France and England are dying; the Nazis are attack
ing our ships already! Are we cowards? To war! To
war!

AMERICAN PRESS DEMANDS ACTION! U.S.
SENDS ULTIMATUM!
The smashing victories of the Nazi forces on the
Western Front have mobilized American thought.
Sinking of American ships and murder of American
sailors have sounded the call to arms. And the United
States Army and Navy were yesterday called to the
colors. First draft lists have been published.
I don't want to go to war. I wouldn't, know why I
was fighting. I don't particularly want to kill anyone,
and, frankly, I would much rather go to college than
be killed.
Coward! How can you think of personal safety or
peace when your brothers are giving their blood for
liberty? Do you want to surrender your home and
your family to barbarians? Coward!
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and
smile, smile, smile! We'll show them Nazis a thing or
two! They ain't fightin' them French frogs now. It's
us, by God! The Yankees. And Hitler can't lick his
Uncle Sammie!
And once again democracy will "be saved."
It is amazing how quickly we can forget, facts in
the face of emotion. What business have we in Eu
rope's war—except business? Hear the martial music?
I'd rather cheer for the Big Red Machine.

smile, smile, smile! We'll show them Nazis a thing or
two! They ain't fightin' them French frogs now. It's
us, by God! The Yankees. And Hitler can't lick his
Uncle Sammie!
And once again democracy will "be saved."
It is amazing how quickly we can forget, facts in
the face of emotion. What business have we in Eu
rope's war—except business? Hear the martial music?
I'd rather cheer for the Big Red Machine.

V'AZIS SMASH MAGINOT LINE! BOMBING OF
CHILDREN TOLD!
The Allies have valiantly held of! the regimented
might of Fascism for two years. But slowly the great
heart of democracy is breaking. Hitler-terror will
sweep France, subjugate England, and send an expedi
tionary force to the Americas. World civilization is
periled. Our blood-brothers are dying in defense of
liberty. Why stand we here idle?
Oh, I don't believe all that. You know all the propa
ganda they fed us last time: babies' hands cut. off, Bel
gian priests hung by their feet in church bells. It's
exaggerated.

Exaggerated? Can the fall of democracy be an ex

Hitler is burning the world.
AMERICAN LINER, SUNK BY SUB! BRUTALI
TIES TO PASSENGERS, REPORT!
Six leading American statesmen, all former neu
trality leaders, today condemned as an act of war
Germany's crass violation of American shipping rights.
Eye-witnesses swear that a Nazi U-boat was respon
sible for sinking the United States sailing ship War
Supplisia without warning. Fifty drowned.
I don't get excited over all this war hysteria. They're
just trying to drag us into Europe. What business have
wc in a war that was sewn by English-dominated im
perialism and nurtured in a hypocritical European
diplomacy that made speeches while it supported
Fascism economically—a war whose only harvest can
be destruction, with its chief accomplishment the plow
ing of another fertile field for tyrannies. Let's see that
our own democracy is secure—politically and econom
ically. The last war didn't help democracy much.
Do-nothing philosophies aren't worth much when
your house is on fire. This is civilization's last stand.
France and England are dying; the Nazis are attack
ing our ships already! Are we cowards? To war! To
war!

AMERICAN PRESS DEMANDS ACTION! U.S.

The smashing victories of the Nazi forces on the
Western Front have mobilized American thought.
Sinking of American ships and murder of American
sailors have sounded the call to arms. And the United
States Army and Navy were yesterday called to the
colors. First draft lists have been published.
I don't want to go to war. I wouldn't, know why I
was fighting. I don't particularly want to kill anyone,
and, frankly, I would much rather go to college than
be killed.
Coward! How can you think of personal safety or
peace when your brothers are giving their blood for
liberty? Do you want to surrender your home and
your family to barbarians? Coward!
