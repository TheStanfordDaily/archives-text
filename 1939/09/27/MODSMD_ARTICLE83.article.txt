PACIFICA
T>ACIFICA smiled quite unnoticeably, smiled and
stared down at. the ant-like little men and women
that hurried past her feet on their way to sec Botti
celli's "Birth of Venus" and Sally Rand's "Nude
Ranch." She smiled but did not wonder, for this was
Treasure Island where the sacred and profane rubbed
shoulders without anyone seeming to notice it.
It was amazing, she thought, that this artificial
island held up so well under the contrasts it was
forced to carry. And she looked over her left shoulder
toward the flashing, noisy, honky-tonk of the Gayway,
and then straight ahead to the peaceful, unearthly
beauty of the Court of the Moon and Stars.
In the Palais de l'Elegance the crowds were sipping
champagne, and at an outdoor refreshment stand they
were sucking soda pop through chewed straws. But
everywhere—at the art collection, the Hall of Science,
Vacationland—the atmosphere was the same.
These were ordinary men and women, but they
seemed a little different, as if they had left their bur
dens outside the gates to Treasure Island. They had
forgotten their troubles.

jVIORE than anything else the Fair on San Francisco
Bay recalls the imaginative splendor of Shangri-
La. Completely yet. subtcly fantastic, it transports its
guests to an unreal realm where they can forget all
but what is most beautiful in life.
The raucous ballyhoo of the amusement zone, the
scientific marvels, and the industrial exhibits—none of
these can destroy the dream-like, oriental atmosphere
that is the essence of the Exposition. Nor can the gaunt
wooden frame of the Federal Building or the extreme
modern design of several of the other pavilions dispel
the illusion that when the Fair is over, it will disappear
in a cloud of pink smoke.
To some the fantasy of this pleasure dome may
seem deplorable. They may be convinced that an en
terprise of this kind bears a prime obligation to dis
play the mateiial progress that the preceding decade or
two has produced. They may feel that, a fair should
experiment with architecture which can later be adapt
ed to practical use.
True it is that these have been the chief functions of
American expositions in recent years, and true it is
that the Pageant of the Pacific performs them without
over-accenting them.
But, its great gift is the same as that which made
James Hilton's Shangri-La the twentieth century's
Utopia. It i.s peace.
In a world glutted with dictators and commintems,
with international rivalries and national economic strife
menacing the life-span, the contributions of the Ex
position is invaluable. Upon entering its elephant
guarded gates the electric tension of today's uncertain
existence is removed.
This is a dream only in the sense that it enables one
to see more clearly, to realize the insignificance of per
sonal misfortunes and the foolishness of governments
that are an end in themselves.
Strolling alone on Treasure Island at night, away
from the crowds, with only the splashing of the foun
tains and the hum of distant music in one's ears, is like
deserting the outside world for a sphere where ideals
can be realized.

Pacifica smiled as she saw the slim young dreamer
walking toward her from the Court of the Seven Seas
where the lights already had been extinguished.
This new generation, she thought, why do they
think so much? Why isn't he on the Gayway, staring
for 25 cents at Miss America, with the men who ramp
back from the last war?—Livingston.
