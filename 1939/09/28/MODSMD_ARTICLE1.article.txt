### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
the punches in the Eu
ropean bout is an uncertain job
at best, but all indications point to
the conclusion that Esthonia, snug
gling on the Baltic coast next to Rus
sia, will be the next Soviet acquisi
tion.
Germany already has given the
nod of approval to any measures the
Soviets may wish to take against
Esthonia. The surface incident that
provoked Russian hostility was the
sinking of the "Metallist," a Soviet
steamer of about 4000 tons, by a Pol
ish submarine in the Gulf of Fin
land, off the coast of Esthonia.

Whether Esthonia can be held
responsible for the activity of Pol
ish subs in Esthonian waters is a
question that Russia seems to be
able to answer. An official an
nouncement from Moscow said that
the Polish undersea craft "Orzel"
asscrtedly "escaped" from the Es
thonian port of Tallium. News of
the sinking of the "Metallist" was
made public by the Tass news
agency with details that 19 of the
steamer's crew of 24 were saved
by Soviet patrol ships and "the
remaining five are missing."
The announcement came only two
hours after the arrival in Moscow of
the Esthonian mission with new ex
planations regarding alleged Polish
submarine activity in Esthonian
waters. In view of the "Metallist"
disaster it's almost sure to predict
that the new explanations will be
promptly rejected, just as those
made Sunday night were.

yi FTER flying back from Tallium
with the Esthonian minister to
Russia, the Soviet ambassador to
Esthonia, and two experts on inter
national law, whose services he'll be
sure to need, Karl Selter, the Es
thonian foreign minister, was cool
ing his heels in Molotov's outer of
fice, waiting to hear the pronounce
ment that will settle the fate of his
nation.
It's almost certain that he'll have
to accept Soviet demands that the
Russians be given virtual control
of Esthonian seaports with the
right to station armed forces in
them. This would, of course,
amount to Soviet domination of
Esthonia. Or Selter can take the
other course — reject any Soviet
demands and face the consequenc
es. Poland tried that with Ger
many. The world knows what
happened.

With the influx of foreign diplo
mats to Moscow, the Soviet capital
has become the unofficial "capital of
eastern Europe." The clever power
politics of Molotov and his Soviet
friends has made all roads lead to
Moscow. The balance of power has
been shifted so artfully that the fate
of the Continent is, for the first time
in history, being decided in Josef
Stalin's foreign office.
Master salesman Joachim Von
Ribbentrop, with bag, baggage, and
a staff of 39 experts, rolled into town
to discuss further Russo-German
collaboration. Included in the agen
da of conferences will be determina
tion of the future status of the now
conquered Polish nation.

HPIIOUGII (lie report was un
confirmed, it was believed that
Molotov has been dickering with
Japanese Ambassador Shigcnori
Togo over amplification of the
Russo-Japanese "cease fighting"
agreement on the frontiers of
Japan's Manchukuoan protec
torate.
In this same vein, rumors have
been floating around Berlin for
days that a possible Russo-Japa
nese non-aggression treaty, simi
lar to the Russo-Gcrnian pact,
will be signed in the near future.
Germany, of course, was trying
valiantly to harmonize relations
between the Soviets and the Jap
anese because Japanese support
w ill prove handy in the event that
(lie European war spreads beyond
the limits of the Continent.
