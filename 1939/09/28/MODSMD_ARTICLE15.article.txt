## New Pacts Expected In South America 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 (UP). —
The administration intends to expand
its trade treaty program during the
European war as a foundation for
post-war construction of world
trade, a high official told the United
Press tonight.
He said new trade pacts with the
Latin American Republics comprise
the major war-time objective of the
program.
Negotiations are envisaged with
Uruguay and Chile soon after, or
concurrently with, a projected ac
cord with Argentina. A pact with
Venezuela is understood to be near
conclusion, while others with Bo
livia, Paraguay and perhaps Peru,
are being studied.
It was pointed out this agenda, if
successfully concluded, would almost
complete a hemispheric pattern of
liberalized trade such as is under
discussion at the currcnt. inter-
American neutrality conference at
Panama City.
In Europe, the United Press was
informed, the administration in
tends to maintain the trade pact
progress it has made during the last
five years, including agreements in
effect with Great Britain and France.
In addition, renewals, with some ex
pansion, are likely among the Scan
dinavian neutrals while there arc
likely possibilities in Southeastern
Europe.
Prominent among European pros
pects is Spain, with which negotia
tions are expected when the Franco
government completes its post-revo
lutionary political and economic sta
bilization. It was recalled today the
two nations were on the verge of
completing a reciprocal pact before
Ihe civil war broke out in 1936.
