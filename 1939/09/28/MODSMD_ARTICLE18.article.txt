# Graham Stuart Praises F.D.R.'s Revised Neutrality Proposal
## Foreign Affairs Expert Says Act Will Keep United States from War 
### JOHN BURTT 
Practically, realistically, Professor Graham Stuart, political science de
partment expert on foreign affairs, yesterday expressed himself as wholly
in favor of the administration's proposed revisions to the present Ameri
can Neutrality Act.
He pointed out that the revision would not only substantially aid Great

Britain and France, but would help
keep the United States from being
involved in the present conflict.

"the best possible thing for the
United States at the present time is
to aid the Allies by making possible
their purchases of adequate sup
plies of munitions of war. We might
term this a policy of 'enlightened
selfishness'."
Professor Stuart predicted that an
improved neutrality law, including
the proposed cash-and-carry plan
and forbidding loans to belligerents,
would be passed by Congress.
"President Roosevelt," he pointed
out, "by offering a compromise to

Congress, and by recognizing thai
Congress should have a part in
formulating our neutrality legisla
tion, has materially increased the
possibility that the revisions will go
through."
Answering isolationist claims that
any let-down of I he present embargo
will place this country on the road
|to war, Professor Stuart said he
| could see nothing in the proposed
1 cash-and-carry revisions which
; might involve the U.S. in any way.
On the other hand, he pointed out,
| the present act can be fatal to our
neutrality.
"Under the present law," he said,
"we are permitted to ship 90 per
cent of contraband articles to bel
ligerents, in our own vessels, even to
