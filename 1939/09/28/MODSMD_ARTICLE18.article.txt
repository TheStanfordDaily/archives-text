# Graham Stuart Praises F.D.R.'s Revised Neutrality Proposal
## Foreign Affairs Expert Says Act Will Keep United States from War 
### JOHN BURTT 
Practically, realistically, Professor Graham Stuart, political science de
partment expert on foreign affairs, yesterday expressed himself as wholly
in favor of the administration's proposed revisions to the present Ameri
can Neutrality Act.
He pointed out that the revision would not only substantially aid Great

Britain and France, but would help
keep the United States from being
involved in the present conflict.
"As an indirect measure of self
defense," Dr. Stuart commented,
"the best possible thing for the
United States at the present time is
to aid the Allies by making possible
their purchases of adequate sup
plies of munitions of war. We might
term this a policy of 'enlightened
selfishness'."
Professor Stuart predicted that an
improved neutrality law, including
the proposed cash-and-carry plan
and forbidding loans to belligerents,
would be passed by Congress.
"President Roosevelt," he pointed
out, "by offering a compromise to

Congress, and by recognizing thai
Congress should have a part in
formulating our neutrality legisla
tion, has materially increased the
possibility that the revisions will go
through."
Answering isolationist claims that
any let-down of I he present embargo
will place this country on the road
|to war, Professor Stuart said he
| could see nothing in the proposed
1 cash-and-carry revisions which
; might involve the U.S. in any way.
On the other hand, he pointed out,
| the present act can be fatal to our
neutrality.
"Under the present law," he said,
"we are permitted to ship 90 per
cent of contraband articles to bel
ligerents, in our own vessels, even to


DR. GRAHAM STUART
the extent of purchase on credit."
He cited huge shipments of oil
and metals to belligerents specific
ally, and made clear the fact that
munitions, the only articles on the
present embargo list, actually consti.
tute a small percentage of all con
traband.
"The proposed law is in full ac
cordance with international law," he
said. "International law permits the
citizens of neutral states to sell
goods, including materials of war, to
all belligerents.
DEFENSE BUYING
"This is aimed to protect the peace
loving state by permitting it to buy
war materials for defense in case of
attack by a war-like state fully pre
pared for aggx-ession."
He emphasized the necessity of
such a c"«tcTi pointing out that
small states would have to maintain
huge war departments in time of
peace if they could not buy muni
tions in quantity during war.
Professor Stuart continued his
discussion in favor of revision, cit
ing that the present law forbids the
sale of munitions to Canada, yet the
Monroe Doctrine, America's Bible in
foreign relations, would require us
to send men to protect Canada
against European conquest.
COMPROMISE EXCELLENT
"President Roosevelt and Secre
tary Hull have proposed an excel
lent compromise which will end the
shortcomings of the existing law,"
he said. "They would retain those
parts of our so-called neutrality
law which keep Americans off bel

ligerent ships and out of war zones,
and prohibit loans to belligerents.
"But they would permit sale of
all goods, including munitions and
planes, to all belligerents who could
pay cash and make delivery in their
own vessels."
He said he considers such a pol
icy fair in that it aids the powers
which have not stocked up for ag
gressive warfare.
He concluded his statements,
stressing the non-political nature of
(he proposed revision. Former Sec
retary Stimson, Alfred M. Landon,

and Colonel George Knox, to men
tion a few prominent Republicans,
have committed themselves as en
tirely in favor of the proposal.

Professor Stuart continued his
discussion in favor of revision, cit
ing that the present law forbids the
sale of munitions to Canada, yet the
Monroe Doctrine, America's Bible in
foreign relations, would require us
to send men to protect Canada
against European conquest.
COMPROMISE EXCELLENT
"President Roosevelt and Secre
tary Hull have proposed an excel
lent compromise which will end the
shortcomings of the existing law,"
he said. "They would retain those
parts of our so-called neutrality
law which keep Americans off bel

ligerent ships and out of war zones,
and prohibit loans to belligerents.
"But they would permit sale of
all goods, including munitions and
planes, to all belligerents who could
pay cash and make delivery in their
own vessels."
He said he considers such a pol
icy fair in that it aids the powers
which have not stocked up for ag
gressive warfare.
He concluded his statements,
stressing the non-political nature of
(he proposed revision. Former Sec
retary Stimson, Alfred M. Landon,

and Colonel George Knox, to men
tion a few prominent Republicans,
have committed themselves as en
tirely in favor of the proposal.
Practically, realistically, Professor Graham Stuart, political science de
partment expert on foreign affairs, yesterday expressed himself as wholly
in favor of the administration's proposed revisions to the present Ameri
can Neutrality Act.
He pointed out that the revision would not only substantially aid Great

Britain and France, but would help
keep the United States from being
involved in the present conflict.
"As an indirect measure of self
defense," Dr. Stuart commented,
"the best possible thing for the
United States at the present time is
to aid the Allies by making possible
their purchases of adequate sup
plies of munitions of war. We might
term this a policy of 'enlightened
selfishness'."
Professor Stuart predicted that an
improved neutrality law, including
the proposed cash-and-carry plan
and forbidding loans to belligerents,
would be passed by Congress.
"President Roosevelt," he pointed
out, "by offering a compromise to

Congress, and by recognizing thai
Congress should have a part in
formulating our neutrality legisla
tion, has materially increased the
possibility that the revisions will go
through."
Answering isolationist claims that
any let-down of I he present embargo
will place this country on the road
|to war, Professor Stuart said he
| could see nothing in the proposed
1 cash-and-carry revisions which
; might involve the U.S. in any way.
On the other hand, he pointed out,
| the present act can be fatal to our
neutrality.
"Under the present law," he said,
"we are permitted to ship 90 per
cent of contraband articles to bel
ligerents, in our own vessels, even to


DR. GRAHAM STUART
the extent of purchase on credit."
He cited huge shipments of oil
and metals to belligerents specific
ally, and made clear the fact that
munitions, the only articles on the
present embargo list, actually consti.
tute a small percentage of all con
traband.
"The proposed law is in full ac
cordance with international law," he
said. "International law permits the
citizens of neutral states to sell
goods, including materials of war, to
all belligerents.
DEFENSE BUYING
"This is aimed to protect the peace
loving state by permitting it to buy
war materials for defense in case of
attack by a war-like state fully pre
pared for aggx-ession."
He emphasized the necessity of
such a c"«tcTi pointing out that
small states would have to maintain
huge war departments in time of
peace if they could not buy muni
tions in quantity during war.
