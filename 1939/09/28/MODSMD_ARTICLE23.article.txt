# Germans Claim Capture Of 100,000 Prisoners As Warsaw Surrenders
## Nazis Boast Sinking Second British Aircraft Carrier; Big Guns Shell French Towns Behind Maginot Line 
### (By United Press 
The defenders of Warsaw threw down their guns Wednesday and agreed
to surrender Ihe city, in whose valiant defense thousands of men, women
and children died, to the encircling German armies that for 20 days had
bombed and burned it into a shambles.
Few cities of modern times have suffered such a sieire as Warsaw.

►where 80.000 or 100,000 soldiers and
evon groups of women fought hand
to-hand with thiAenomy at the gate*
long after resistance had been wiped
out in other parts of Poland.
To Germany falls the prize of a
once-magnificent city at least half in
ruins, its streets piled with debris
and the bodies of men, women and
children, according to Polish radio
accounts.
The German high command, in its
announcement of Warsaw's uncon
ditional surrender, said the city
probably will be occupied Friday
and its estimated 100,000 military de
fenders made prisoners of war.
NAZIS CLAIM KAII)
The Nazi high command exult
antly claimed thai 20 German bomb
ing planes had inflicted serious dam
age on several British fleet units in
the North Sea, but the real facts of
the battle were obscured by con
flicting German and British ver
sions.
Berlin said the bombers destroyed
a second British aircraft carrier
and crippled a British battleship and
the German planes returned to
their bases without losses. The
British First Lord of the Admiralty,
Winston Churchill, told the House
of Commons that none of the ship.s
was hit and one German flying boat,
was shot down, a second damaged,
and a third forced down at sea,
where the crew of four was cap
tured.
GUNS lIAMMEIt FRANCE
On the Western Front German
long-range guns of the Siegfried
Line hammered at least a half
dozen villages and communications
lines deep behind the Maginot Line
throughout the day along a 5-mile
fi'ont east of Saarbruecken. French
semi-official quarters believed the
shelling was in preparation for a
major German offensive.
On the diplomatic side, Moscow
and Josef V. Stalin held the ."fpot
light. Political talks under way in
Moscow last night among diplomats
of Russia, Germany, Turkey, Es
thonia, Bulgaria and Japan that
may lead to further changes in the
' line-up for war and perhaps in the
map of Europe.
With the line-up for war contin
uing, the German press intensified
its warnings to Britain and France
to "halt the war while there is still
time." But the Allies turned a deaf
j ear, just as they did previously to
j the "final" peace proposals of Hitler
1 and Premier Benito Mussolini of
! Italy.
! Britain's answer was to impose
new taxes calling for "silver bul-
S lets" from every Briton—rich and
J poor—to carry on the war for three
! years or more at. the stupendous
1 cost, of $20,000,000 a day. Chancellor
| of the Exchequer Sir John Simon in-
I troduced a supplementary "war
J budget" in the House of Commons
I calling for higher taxes on beer,
; wine, sugar, tobacco, whisky, in
| come, inheritances and war profits.
