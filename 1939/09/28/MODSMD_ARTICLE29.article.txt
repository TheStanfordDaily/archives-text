# Cards Halt Cincy Pennant March

### 
CINCINNATI, Sept. 27 (UP). â€”
Cincinnati fandom, which has wait
ed 20 years to celebrate a baseball
championship, must wait another
day. "Fiddler Bill" McGee, hurling
one of the finest games of his career,
saw to that today when he pitched
the St. Louis Cardinals to a 4-0 tri
umph over the Cincinnati Reds.
Bucky Walters, Cincinnati ace
who went into the game with six
straight victories and a record of 27
and 10, pitched capably but he was
no match for the red hot McGee.
Walters gave up only seven hits, but
one of them was a homer by Terry
Moore and three others were bunch
ed in one inning.

A day on the moon is fourteen
times the length of a day on earth.
