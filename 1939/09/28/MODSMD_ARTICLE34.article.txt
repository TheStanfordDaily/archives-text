formations and plays.
They're rough and they're tough.
They've got a powerful, beefy line
and a flashy backfield. There are
seven returning lettermen in the
first - string lineup. A smashing,
hell-for-leather giant named Schultz
will start at left guard, and Jim Kis
sel burgh is a sensational fullback
who loves to break up ball games.
In other words, those Oregon State
Beavers are good.
Coach Lon Stiner's squad, which
will probably enter the Stadium as
favorites in Saturday's opener, is
being ballyhooed as the best mole
skin brigade to represent the Cor
vallis school since Stiner took over
the reins seven years ago. This in
spite of last fall's eleven, which
was good enough to rank third in
the final Pacific Coast Conference
standings.
LINE AVERAGES 200
According to tentative starting
lineups, the O.S.C. forward wall will
average around 200 pounds. Eberle
Schultz, a candidate for All-Ameri
can honors, is the mainstay of the
line. He stands six feet foui and
jostles the Fairbanks at the 225-
pound mark.
Morrie Kohler, right halfback,
has been ballyhooed as the best
little football player in Oregon
State's history.
John Tsoutsouvas, kid brother of
Louis "Choo-Choo" Tsoutsouvas, In
dian star of a few years ago who is
now helping Harry Shipkey coach
the Papoose gridders, will open at
center for the Beavers. The "Little
Choo-Choo" is noted for his depend
able pla}'.
FULLBACKS TO DUEL
The duel between Jim Kisselburgh
and Norm Standlee will be one of
the* highlights of Saturday's game.
The Oregon star was hailed as the
best sophomore back on the coast
last season, while Standlee spent a
lot of time on the bench with an
ankle injury.
Preparing to meet the Beavers'
invasion, Tiny Thornhill sent his
gridders through a drill on de
fensive tactics against Oregon State
formations and plays.
