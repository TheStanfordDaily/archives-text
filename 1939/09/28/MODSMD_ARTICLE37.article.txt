### JERRY MAYER 
CARD TACKLES WEAK
j AS BEAVER GAME LOOMS
One of the basic axioms of foot
; ball says, "A team is no stronger
than its tackles."
Tiny Thornhill, quite a lineman
I himself back at Pittsburgh when
S most of us were cutting our teeth
j on the slats of our cribs, pretty ob
i viously believes in that maxim,
judging by the time he and Jim
Lawson are putting in on Stanford's
| aggregation of tackles this week.
Stan Andersen, the only tackle
on the roster who has seen action
in a varsity game and on whom
much of Stanford's hopes for a
strong line depend, lias looked no
better than the rest despite his
two years as a regular. Andersen,
big and fast for his 215 pounds,
still is learning fitu'sse, although
his tremendous power is undisput
ed.
Andersen will start at left tackle
I Saturday against Oregon State
| despite the dissatisfaction Thorn
hill has expressed in his work, but
right now the other tackle spot is
wide open.
The work of '"Swede" Johnsen at
, left tackle is also discouraging to
I Tiny, and he's looking around for
! another man to fill the bill. Bill
j Trout, 240 pounds and one of the
j fastest linemen on the team, has
looked excellent at times, but a pos
sible ace in the hole is Corky Dona
hue, regular guard.
Corky played tackle in '37 and
I also during the early part of last
I season —until shifted to guard to fill
i a hole there. It is just barely pos
j sible that Donahue might be at that
right tackle slot, when the Cards face
off against the Beavers Saturday.
But this much is certain, that if
the quoted maxim is true, Stanford
j may have line trouble this year—
' unless Andersen, Johansen, et al, can
; snap out of their slump.
j That very undecidedness is part of
! the thrill and suspense of football
i season, but it sure is tough on the
■ fan, who has to beat his head against
| a wall all week wonde just
; what is going to happen when the
! game rolls around. You should see
the knocked-up walls in The Daily
sports office.
FUNNY STORY?
ABOUT STAN ANDERSEN
I The French Olympic Games dis
cus thrower who got off a tremen
dous heave during the Los Angeles
Games in 1932, only to discover that
all the officials were watching the
pole vault, has nothing on Stan An
dersen.
j Stan was competing in a track
{meet in British Columbia this sum
mer at which part of the ceremonies
I included a speech by the Duke of
I Sutherland. A bunch of Scotsmen
I adorned in their traditional kiltie
outfits were gathered on the field
waiting for the Duke to arrive
while Stan warmed up for the
javelin throw, an event he had de
cided to enter although he knew ab
solutely nothing about the technique
of hurling the spear.
Time passed, and no Duke, so
| the officials decided to start the
meet. Stan whipped down the
| javelin runway and sailed the
weapon out further than he had
j ever expected to. But just as Stan
i was recovering from his ama/.e
-! ment and a warm glow of satis
faction was settling over him, the
Duke of Sutherland arrived and
the kiltiod Scots hurried across the
javelin fairway to greet him. And
the joy in Stan's heart turned to
the brimstone of tragedy as one
of the skirted men nonchalantly
picked the quivering javelin out
of the ground and threw it aside.
Andersen yowled and ranted, he
shouted and jumped, he screamed
and shook his fist. But everyone on
the field was listening to the Duke,

so Stan eventually ended up listen
ing to the lord also, while he whis
pered invectives to his own sympa
thetic ears.
The speech over, the event re
sumed —just as it started, with An
dersen's toss not being counted.
He won the event, anyway, wkh a
throw many feet short of his ill
fated first toss.
