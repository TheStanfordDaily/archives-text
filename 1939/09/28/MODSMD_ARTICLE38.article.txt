# Shipkey Trims Papoose Attack
## Vucinich to Spark Frosh This Saturday 
### 
After more than two weeks of
practice together, Stanford's frosh
i grid satellites yesterday began
j showing stronger signs that there
i would be a fairly complete synchro
nization of the varied high school
i systems into the one employed by
! Coach Harry Shipkey when the
Papooses meet Modesto Jaysee Sat
urday.
In one of the hardest scrimmages
j of the season, Shipkey had his first
I and second stringers battering away
at the thirds for the better part of
'an hour yesterday. Both Hank
! Norberg and Eric Armstrong, end
! and halfback, were in the spotlight
as they pulled down passes from
fullback Milt Vucinich, while "Red"
Robinson operated nicely at left
| half on the second string, tearing
I off sizeable gains in tackle slants
! and end jaunts.
Vucinich's uncanny eye for ac
! curacy in tossing aerials indicates
that the Papooses' passing game may
| be as dangerous as the one which
Frankie Albert flaunted in the
| face of opponents last season. At
| least Coach Shipkey will be ready
j for an aerial bombardment if Vu
-1 cinich, Armstrong, Robinson, or Al
Cole are stopped at the line.
Last year in the opening game
i against Pomona Jaysee and with a
j less imposing array of high school
! aces backing him, Albert demon
l strated easily his superiority in the
I backfield. However, it will demain
j a toss-up until game-time to find
I out which of the above four grid
i ders or even an unknown will come
i out as the ace of the Modesto tilt.
