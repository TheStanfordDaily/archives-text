# Water Polo Has Full Turnout
## Tour Vets Return; Tough Defense Seen 
### 
As if he didn't already have
enough material, Coach Nort Thorn
ton yesterday watched four "has
beens" come back in their effort to
gain first-string berths on the water
polo team as practice started.
Yesterday was spent with a half
hour scrimmage and a half-hour
chalk talk, during which Coach
Thornton outlined the plans for the
season.
Twenty-six men are out for the
team â€”just two men short of four
lull strings. Among those 26, are the
four making decided comebacks -
Bill Burns, first-string goalie two
years ago; Bill Bleeker, first-string
forward as a sophomore, but absent
last season; Dick Clarke, varsity
swim star who played first string as
a frosh three years back; and Bob
Allen, a former star who was in
eligible last year.
Thornton was pleased with the
first scrimmage. Ho believes the de
fense will be especially formidable,
but is slightly worried about the
offense, which is due to a question
mark at the right forward spot. Cap
tain Bob Plate, sprint, and Dick
Hoover and Ted Moreno, guards,
now appear first string cinches.
The season opens in the home
pools against San Jose. Thursday,
October 12.
