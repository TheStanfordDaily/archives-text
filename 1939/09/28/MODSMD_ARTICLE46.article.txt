						Vote for Peace

TODAY at five campus polling places students
will register their views on peace and war.
Militarist, pacifist, and nationalist philosophies
will have a chance to come out into the open,
and a fair approximation of Stanford opinion
will result.
When a similar vote recently was taken at
the University of California, the outcome shook
many a sincere patriot from his chair. Approxi
mately 500 students stated that they would
volunteer for service if the United States en
tered the European war, 1,100 said they would
go if drafted—and 800 men asserted that they
would refuse to fight, even at the risk of im
prisonment.
A great many men and women who lived
through the last war and remember the patrio
tism that engulfed the nation then, branded the
new generation a bunch of slackers when they
read the results of that poll. And even sym
pathetic pacifists smiled wisely, contemplating
how many of the 800 would change their minds
when the time came.
Stanford, being a trifle more conservative
than her rival across the Bay, probably will not
commit herself to any rash promises. Men
eager for war and conscientious objectors ap
pear to be equally rare in this middle-of-the-road
student body.
Realizing how immaterial their sentiments
will be if war really comes, students are likely
to soberly resign themselves to submitting to
conscription. They will reason that once the
United States has declared war there is very
little that the individual can do to stop it.
But today there is peace in this country, and
now is the time when the young men and
women of America should fight.
With a battle strategy free from designs of
death and destruction, they must fight to save
the world—through peace.
