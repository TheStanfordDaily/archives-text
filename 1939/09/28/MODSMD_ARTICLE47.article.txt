WHEN President Roosevelt called the cur
rent emergency session of Congress to
change the status of American neutrality, the
gentlemen of the national legislature found
themselves placed in a very embarrassing po
sition. Like white mice in a psychology de
partment maze, they were offered only two ex
its—and neither appeared to be particularly ap
petizing.
Either the present arms embargo must con
tinue in force, or the proposed "cash and carry"
act must be put into effect. No other alterna
tive seems to have been presented.
Aside from the fact that the measure now un
der consideration will keep a great number of
potential neutral victims of naval warfare out
side of combat zones, the question involves
only a decision of whether we will get into war
quicker if we fail to remain strictly neutral or
if Germany and Russia start to win.
Balancing the issue delicately and adding to
the "cash and carry" side the weight of en
forced protection for American shipping and
the experience that involved us in the last war,
the scale points in favor of repeal of the em
bargo.
On the face of the matter, such a move would
be decidedly in accord with international law,
but actually no one pretends that it would not
favor the Allies.
In the spring of 1917 the Central Powers ap
peared to be ready to win the war, United States
ships were being attacked by German U-boats
•—and we entered the war.
Since "cash and carry" offers a remedy for
these situations that threaten to recur, perhaps
it is worth a trial. But in case it should fail,
maybe we-should start distributing gas masks
and digging shelters in the Library lawn.
