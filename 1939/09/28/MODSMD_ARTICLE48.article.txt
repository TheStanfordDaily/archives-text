IT is posible that the Democratic Party soon
will be accusing Stanford of boring-from
within tactics, and Mr. Hearst may be taking
the University off his black list: Stanford this
year is not going to celebrate Thanksgiving on
the legal holiday prescribed by President Roo
sevelt, but will hold a so-called Republican
Thanksgiving.
But in spite of what Messrs. Farley and Hearst
may think, Stanford's choice of Thanksgiving
is anything but political. It is all because of the
Big Game. Well, almost all.
That game was scheduled, as those things
always are, months in advance; months before
Mr. Roosevelt decided to move the day of grace

up a week lor purely business reasons. It was
scheduled lor a perfectly innocent day, Satur
day, Nov. 25.
And then Thursday, Nov. 23, was declared to
be Thanksgiving Day. Which made Saturday,
Nov. 25, innocent still, but a trifle confusing.
The crux of the matter was soon this: how
could Stanford celebrate Thanskgiving and the
Big Game rally on the same day; and how, as
a matter of fact, could Stanford en masse be
here in the Stadium on the following Saturday
for the game itself? Oh, yes, and go to classes
and examinations scheduled for that week, of
course.
So, Stanford will roast Cal's reputation on
legal Thanksgiving, and save the roasting of the
Turkey for the following week.â€”D. J.
