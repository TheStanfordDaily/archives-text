WHEN THE RAINS COME
r |' , HE Poles may be eating horsemeat, but in about
one month that Library parking lot is going to be
no mean trial either.
For years now it has been customary for the au
tumn and winter rains to make a mass of bogs and
quagmires out of the Libe wastelands, and most im
partial observers question a change of heart for '39
and '40. The rains have a way of observing traditions.
They are all conservatives.
For years now it has been customary to go wading
with library books. It's not the muddy shoes or the
splattered cars or the splotched pants that anyone
minds particularly. It's just the general atmosphere of
peril and uncertainty that hovers over any expedition
involving the virgin dangers of an unexplored mud pit.
Cleaning bills our parents can bear, we feel. But where
are the nerves hardy enough to brave the possibility
of being engulfed by some dark and terrible sea of
black water, sponsored by a begrimed and unortho
dox Neptune?

A ND where is the democratic voice that can remain
silent when he compares our synthesis of a shell
torn battlefield with the signs of plutocracy in the as
phalted faculty parking lot? It certainly requires no
mad "Ham-and-Eggs" demagogue, inspired by the in
equality between his own pocket-book and Morgan's
but unmoved by the growing disparity between his
own and his followers, to be struck by the flagrant caste
system prevalent in student-faculty parking relations.
Few things in life compare so unfavorably with any
thing else as does an alternating cycle of dust and mud
with smooth, clean asphalt. Irreparable damage can
be done to Stanford's customary capitalistic outlook by
just such flagrant displays of luxury and hardship liv
ing side by side.
On the brass-tacks side it strikes many of us as a
rather anomalous waste of energy that those big ce
ment mixers should be waking Enema bright and early
while pouring foundations into the new Hoover War
Libe when that no-man's land next to it is shrieking
for redemption. Where are our econ majors while
economy is being outraged? Conspiring, we suspect,
with the people who sell goulashes and clean pants.

Right now the Libe Parking Lot is not a crucial
eye-sore, only a little dusty and bumpy as a corrugated
washboard. But weathermen are unanimous in predict
ing rain this year. Is foresight a cry in the dark? Ah,
but a cry to be sure!
For representation the Boston Tea Party was staged;
for freedom of the seas the War of 1812 was fought;
for Africa, Stanley and Livingstone braved a dark con
tinent. Surely the noise of those cement mixers can
be waged in the interests of a hazardless, democratic
parking lot!
