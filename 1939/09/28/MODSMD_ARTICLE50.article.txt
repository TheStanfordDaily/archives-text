"DAYS OF OUK YEARS": PIERRE VAN PAASSEN
of Our Years" is far more than the auto
biography of a crack foreign correspondent; it is a
timely and moving commentary on the insane events
which have kept the world in a state of continuous
jitters since August 11, 1918. Pierre van Paassen is no
dispassionate observer, he is a sensitive intellectual
who has been forced to develop a sustaining philoso
phy which will carry him through the maze of dis
trust, greed and double dealing which mark conti
nental affairs.
Pierre van Paassen was born of bourgeois parents
in the tiny Dutch village of Brabant. A deep seated
fear of God Almighty colored the first 18 years of hi.s
Jife, for a merciless and bigotted Calvinistic deity hung
over the affairs of his home, school and town.

In the spring of 1914, the van Paassen family immi
grated to Canada. He was preparing for the min
istry and was, he thought, being a Hollander, com
pletely outside of Canadian politics, but no able
bodied man was permitted to hold that view long in a
country which needed soldiers as much as Canada did
by the third year of the war.
Of the war, van Paassen says, "A ditch, four years
wide, cuts across the lives of millions of men. In that
ditch they crawled through mire and filth, physically
and spiritually."

AFTER the war the disillusioned young man drifted
into reporting and soon became roving corre
spondent in Europe for the New York Evening World,
where he saw "the rising struggle against capitalist
industrialization which was destroying economic sta
bility and not only undermining all exterior security
of life, but also robbing millions of human beings of
all inner support."
With the crash came an increase in serious report
ing, for then, with unbelievable speed, the potential
evil which has been brewing in Continental affairs for
so long, suddenly began to boil into all too tangible
actualities.
Van Paassen saw, he felt, and he recorded, and then
late in 1938, after the mess has culminated in the in
credibile stupidity of Munich, he returned to his old
home, Brabant, for a visit, and there found the God
he'd lost so long ago. But not the same God.

Sitting in the half twilight on the steps of the old
town bell-tower, he found what he hopes is the way
out ."Europe and the world will in all probability
have to pass through the phase of Fascism. But it car
ries within it the seeds of its own disintegration. Out
of man's dissatisfaction and longing, new worlds are
born, for there will come a time when the peoples are
no longer afraid of death."
He sees that the struggle coming "is a struggle for
man,' and in that struggle, Christianity will triumph.
"But the triumphant Christianity will not be the
Christianity we know. It will be a new Christianity j
that comes up from the depths of the catacombs of j
suffering rind sorrow. Its apostles will be the martyrs
and saints of a new religion that will solve the ele- j
mentary problems of human existence, the conquest |
of economic slavery and poverty and peace."â€”Nowell j
