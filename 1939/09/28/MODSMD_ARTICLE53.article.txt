### 
The A.S.U. Book Exchange re
leased a list of books in great demand
yesterday and encouraged students
holding these books to bring them
in for immediate sale.
The books are as follows: Ander
son, "American Government"; Cush
man, "Leading Constitutional Deci
sions"; Mavor, "General Biology";
Modlum and Mclsaac, "Social Con
trol of Industry"; Webster, "General
Physics."
Since the beginning of the quarter
the book mart has sold 125 books
with a turnover of $311. Ten per
cent of these sales, to cover office
costs, is diverted back into the
A.S.U. coffers.
