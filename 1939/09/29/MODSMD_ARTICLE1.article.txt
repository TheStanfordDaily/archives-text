### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT topped
the first major hurdle in his
drive to change American neutrality
legislation when the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee yesterday voted
a favorable report on the bill that
would repeal the arms embargo.
With the committee's stamp of ap
porval, the bill will go before the
Senate on Monday.
The whole question of United
States neutrality bills has a topspin
on the humorous side. For, 110
matter how our Washington lead
ers attempt to hide their motives
under legal phraseology, they do
want to help the Allied cause
without embroiling the United
States. The business men of the
nation hate to see millions of dol
lars of fat orders lost because of
the embargo against belligerents.
While they're sincere in wanting
to keep the country out of war,
they would like to aid the Allies.
And they want to make every
thing technically correct by sub
stituting a neatly worded "cash
and carry" provision. We're le
gally, actually, technically neutral,
they say.

There isn't any doubt that the re
vised bill, reported favorably today
to the Senate, will pass. There may
be major and minor skirmishes. The
vote was 16 to 7, with 15 Democrats
and one Republican okaying the
legislation; four Republicans, one
Democrat, one Progressive and one
Farmer-Laborite registered thumbs
down.
Imagine, though, a reversal of
world conditions. Think of the Al
lies completely surrounded by the
German-Russian bloc, unable to send
ships to neutral America for much
needed war supplies. Only the Rus
sians and Germans might benefit
from the exchange; only they might
obtain the things necessary to con
tinue their conquest. Would the
United States then permit cash and
carry selling to all nations? Ob
viously there would be little discus
sion of changing the present neu
trality act under those circum
stances.

Yesterday neither group laid
down arguments during (lie three
hour committee session, both hav
ing agreed that the best proce
dure was to get the issue to the
floor as soon as possible. At the
close of the meeting, held behind
closed doors, it was revealed that
Senator William E. Borah and his
isolationists made 110 attempt to
strike from the bill the provision
eliminating the embargo. The
length of the discussion was laid
to two relatively important chang
es that were made in the proposed
bill.
The first change from the original
draft would exempt United States
shipping and airlines operating in
the western hemisphere from com
plying with the general provision
against American travel in bellig
erent areas.
* * *
r JpiIE second revision further nar
rows presidential discretion in
administering the act by banning
commerical credits to belligerent na
tions which are in default on their
payments for previous purchases in
this country. The bill originally
provided that the President in cer
tain instances could authorize 90-
day, non-renewable credits to bel
ligerent. buyers.
In its present form the bill would
allow the United States to sell war
equipment and other supplies to all
belligerents who are willing to as
sume title to the goods before they
leave American shores and then
transport them in their own vessels.
American vessels and citizens are
prohibited from traveling in certain
danger areas which the President
will outline in proclamation from
time to time. American nationals
must not travel in belligerent ships.
Congress is given equal power with
the. President to declare a state of
war in existence between two or
more countries. This concession will
earn wide approval from Senators
and Representatives.
