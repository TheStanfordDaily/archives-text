## 
### 
Emphasizing tradition and loyalty to the University, President Ray
Lyman Wilbur welcomed new students entering Stanford, greeted those
returning, in his annual opening address in Memorial Ilall yesterday.
"Though traditions themselves may change," Dr. Wilbur stated, "the
central core of sound and wholesome tradition remains basically the same

and that loyalty to the 'Family,'
which you have just become a part,
is the seat of tradition."
Enlarging his advice to the student
body to include the entire subject of
democracy and the stupidity of a
great number of people which perils
the representative type of govern
ment, Dr. Wilbur stated:
"Democracy is in more peril from
itself than from anything on the
outside," he said speaking of the
"Ham and Eggs" proposal now be
| fore the people. He condemned this
I form of "cheap majority rule eco
| nomics" as being absolutely op
| posed to natural laws and as a "fan
j tastic proposal that people can get
! something for nothing if they live
| long enough."
Enlarging his topic still more to
! include the present European situa
| tion, he said, "We are in the midst
of a world that thinks in terms of
, war." Dr. Wilbur told how he had
; in his Stanford career seen his class
! mates go ofT to the Philippines in
1898, and had seen his students go
to war overseas in 1914. He sincere
' ly hoped that he would not have to
sec his students go to war again.
