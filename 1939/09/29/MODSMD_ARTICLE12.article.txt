# Gaieties Director Calls for Talent
## 
### 
Charles Bulotti, director of the
Gaieties, yesterday issued a call to
all budding playwrights and com
posers for Gaieties material. Fresh
men and sophomores as well as up
per classmen are urged to submit
their ideas. The deadline for skits
and songs written by students is
October 6.
"A great deal of material is used
in the Gaieties and it is indeed im
portant that those who have talent
as writers and composers turn in
whatever ideas they have, no matter
how small they might seem," Bulotti
stated. Even incomplete skits and
songs will be accepted, and a special
committee of Ram's Head members
will work with the incompleted
scripts.
According to Dana Winters, Ram's
Head president, the Gaieties will
feature new talent, and all frosh
men and members of any other
class who have never before par
ticipated and would like to are en
couraged to present either their ma
terial or themselves for work in the
show. The Gaieties will be presented
at a matinee and evening perform
ance Oct. 24, the Friday preceding
the Big Game.
