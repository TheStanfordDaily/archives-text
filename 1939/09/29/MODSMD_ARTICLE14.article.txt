# Russians Sign Trade Treaty With Estonia
## Pact Precludes Soviet-Nazi Program For Eastern Europe 
### UNITED PRESS 
Russia and Estonia signed a pact
of mutual assistance and a trade
agreement in Moscow Thursday
night and thereby probably cleared
the way for further moves in the
widespread program of Russo-Ger
man collaboration for domination of
Eastern Europe which reportedly is
envisaged by Adolf Hitler and Josef
Stalin.
Just where Italy, Germany's mili
tary ally, will fit into this picture is
not clear but it is increasingly ap

dictators are working closely to
gether and that soon they must de

MAY CALL ITALY
One report was that II Duce may
be called in as "a powerful neutral"
in a peace conference which Mos

her month-old war.
There was no confirmation of the
reported Nazi-Soviet plan but de

move might be expected from Hitler
and Stalin.
Informed foreign diplomats in
Berlin believed a "final peace pro

Nazi air victory over the British
fleet—categorically denied by the
British Admiralty—was believed to
indicate Hitler is organizing a major
sea and air attack on the Allies.
The Nazi high command, having
announced Wednesday the "wreck
ing" of a British aircraft carrier and
damaging of a British battleship in
a North Sea air attack, claimed yes
terday to have damaged a British
10,000-ton cruiser off the Isle of
May, almost within sight of Edin
burgh. While calling this "another
lie," the British admitted the Ger
man air force had attempted to bomb
a destroyer near the Isle of May and
it was reported German planes tried
to pierce defenses along the Scottish
coast Thursday, but were driven off.
Pope Pius XII again raised his
voice in an appeal to the warring
nations to seek a solution of their
differences at the confercnce table
instead of in bloodshed. He asked
