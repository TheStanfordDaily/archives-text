# Russians Sign Trade Treaty With Estonia
## Pact Precludes Soviet-Nazi Program For Eastern Europe 
### UNITED PRESS 
Russia and Estonia signed a pact
of mutual assistance and a trade
agreement in Moscow Thursday
night and thereby probably cleared
the way for further moves in the
widespread program of Russo-Ger
man collaboration for domination of
Eastern Europe which reportedly is
envisaged by Adolf Hitler and Josef
Stalin.
Just where Italy, Germany's mili
tary ally, will fit into this picture is
not clear but it is increasingly ap
parent that the Russian and German
dictators are working closely to
gether and that soon they must de
cide what share Benito Mussolini is
to have ir. their grandiose plans.
MAY CALL ITALY
One report was that II Duce may
be called in as "a powerful neutral"
in a peace conference which Mos
cow and Berlin were reported to be
considering.
London newspapers said Italy or
the United States would be invited
to sit in on a conference designed
to settle Europe's problems and end
her month-old war.
There was no confirmation of the
reported Nazi-Soviet plan but de
velopments in Moscow, Berlin, and
reactions from other worried capitals
seemed to indicate some dramatic
move might be expected from Hitler
and Stalin.
Informed foreign diplomats in
Berlin believed a "final peace pro
posal" from Hitler would be forth
coming soon.
HITLER ORGANIZING ATTACK
The German high command's an
nouncement Thursday of a second
Nazi air victory over the British
fleet—categorically denied by the
British Admiralty—was believed to
indicate Hitler is organizing a major
sea and air attack on the Allies.
The Nazi high command, having
announced Wednesday the "wreck
ing" of a British aircraft carrier and
damaging of a British battleship in
a North Sea air attack, claimed yes
terday to have damaged a British
10,000-ton cruiser off the Isle of
May, almost within sight of Edin
burgh. While calling this "another
lie," the British admitted the Ger
man air force had attempted to bomb
a destroyer near the Isle of May and
it was reported German planes tried
to pierce defenses along the Scottish
coast Thursday, but were driven off.
Pope Pius XII again raised his
voice in an appeal to the warring
nations to seek a solution of their
differences at the confercnce table
instead of in bloodshed. He asked
that neutral nations take part in the
general conference. The pontiff did
nut send his peace appeal to Soviet
Russia, arch-foe of the Vatican, be
cause the Holy See and Moscow
have not had diplomatic contact
since the rise of Bolshevism 20
years ago.
German Foreign Minister Joa
chim von Ribbentrop continued his
mysterious conversations in Mos
cow and Nazis in Berlin said the
formation of a huge economic bloc
encompassing all of Eastern Europe
and dominated by Germany and
Russia was the goal of the talks.
On the western front a strong
French attack along the east bank
of the Moselle river on the Luxem
bourg frontier was reported to have

driven German forces back from po
sitions around Perl after day-long
shelling of the German lines. Fur
ther east on the 90-mile sector, a
German infantry attack led by tanks
was said to have been hurled back
at dawn when French machine guns
and artillery shattered the assault
I in the no-man's-land around Saar
j bruecken.
i The war was at a standstill on the
j 150 - mile Rhineland front from
, Karlsruhe and Lauterbourg south
j to the Swiss border.
In Poland the ancient fortress of
I Modlin, which played a heroic role
! in the defense of Warsaw, followed

HITLER ORGANIZING ATTACK
The German high command's an
nouncement Thursday of a second
Nazi air victory over the British
fleet—categorically denied by the
British Admiralty—was believed to
indicate Hitler is organizing a major
sea and air attack on the Allies.
The Nazi high command, having
announced Wednesday the "wreck
ing" of a British aircraft carrier and
damaging of a British battleship in
a North Sea air attack, claimed yes
terday to have damaged a British
10,000-ton cruiser off the Isle of
May, almost within sight of Edin
burgh. While calling this "another
lie," the British admitted the Ger
man air force had attempted to bomb
a destroyer near the Isle of May and
it was reported German planes tried
to pierce defenses along the Scottish
coast Thursday, but were driven off.
Pope Pius XII again raised his
voice in an appeal to the warring
nations to seek a solution of their
differences at the confercnce table
instead of in bloodshed. He asked
that neutral nations take part in the
general conference. The pontiff did
nut send his peace appeal to Soviet
Russia, arch-foe of the Vatican, be
cause the Holy See and Moscow
have not had diplomatic contact
since the rise of Bolshevism 20
years ago.
German Foreign Minister Joa
chim von Ribbentrop continued his
mysterious conversations in Mos
cow and Nazis in Berlin said the
formation of a huge economic bloc
encompassing all of Eastern Europe
and dominated by Germany and
Russia was the goal of the talks.
On the western front a strong
French attack along the east bank
of the Moselle river on the Luxem
bourg frontier was reported to have
