Indian Vcngcancc!
That's what Tiny Thornhill's 193!) edition of (he Big Red Machine will
l>e gunning for when they face the Oregon State lieavcrs in
season-opener on the Stadium turf.
Last year's cardinal-jerseyed hard-luck team pushed the Beavers all
over their home field at Corvallis, hut were unahle to score and lost a 6-0
to Lon Stincr's wrecking

crew,
Several new faces will be in the
Indian lineup this year to bolster the
returning lettermen. All eyes will
be on Frankie Albert, highly publi
cized passing phenom who will bo
making his varsity debut.
Leader of last year's undefeated
and untied Papoose squad, the so
called experts have named Albert as
the crucial question mark on the
Stanford eleven.
Teaming with Albert in the start
ing backfield will be Gene Coldiron,
Jim.Groves, and Norm Standlce. All
are experienced men who have been
regulars on previous teams.
Coldiron, at quarter, will be start
ing his last year of competition to
morrow. Seldom spectacular, Gene
is an excellent blocker and a good
team player. His vicious tackling
and general heads -up defensive
play has earned him the job of back
ing up the line when the other team
has possession of the ball.
Jim Groves, first-string fullback
on the 1937 team who was unable
to play last year because of a bad
shoulder injury, will start the game
at right halfback. Groves looked
very good running the ball on weak
side reverses in practice scrimmages
during the last two weeks, and, as
one of the best pass receivers on the
squad, will be on the pay end of
many southpaw heaves from Albert.
"Bones" Hamilton, Indian back
field coach who starred with Bobby
Grayson and the Vowing Sophs, has
been giving Groves extra instruction
in the fine art of blocking.
Norm Standlce has been dubbed
"The Chief' by his team mates. The
connection is obvious. When two
yards are needed for a first down,
Norm takes the ball from his full
back spot and gets 'em. When he
gets under way, it takes more than
one man to pull the big boy down.
Tiny Thornhill's main work dur
ing pre-season practice has been the
tackles. Stan Graff and Andy Stoj
kovich are back at end, Hamp Pool
and Corky Donahue should be able
to take care of the guard spots, and
Jim Verdiek and Colin McClintock
are inexperienced but promising
centers.
Stan Andersen is a two-year let
terman returning for left tackle, but
he suffered an injured leg during a
practice scrimmage, and may not be
able to play his best football yet.
Swede Johansen was expected to
be able to fill the right tackle spot,
in spite of his inexperience, but he
hasn't quite been coming up to ex
pectations in practice. Bill Trout,
who weighs in at 238 pounds, and j
Wink Jones, beefy sophomore, have
looked good in practice, and at least 1
one of thern has a fine chance to
start against the Beavers.
Thornhill said yesterday that he \
himself wasn't sure yet who would i
be his starting tackles.
Commenting on his team's pros- j
pects, Tiny said that it was "just like i
being in a dark room. It depends on j
how some of our inexperienced men j
perform."
Lon Stiner's Beavers finished the 1
season last fall in third place in the |
Coast Conference standings, and all
reports say that the Corvallis team !
has since improved.
With the Oregon State squad will |
come Jim Kissel burgh, highly touted j
last year as the best soph back on J
the coast. With Kisselburgh and 1
Standlee both operating from the
lullback position, a smashing duel ;
is in the offing.
Advance notices have named Eb- ;
erle Schultz as the best, lineman on '
the Oregon State squad. Schultz is i
a two-year letterman at the left!
guard position. Weighing over 220,'
he i.s expecte'd to make a strong bid !
lor All - Coast and All - American
honors.
