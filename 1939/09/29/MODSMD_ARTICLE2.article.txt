# Poll Reveals Card Voters Want Peace
## Repeal of Embargo On Arms Shipments Wins in Close Vote 
### 
Stanford may be a middle-of-the
road educational institution, but her
ideas on war and neutrality as
shown in the results of yesterday's
Daily poll, proved to be surpris
ingly consistent and liberal.
There was little doubt after the
first few ballots had been counted
that the supposedly conservative
and independent Stanford student
body had found in the war question
a ground for common understand
ing. Only on the question of repeal
of the present arms embargo and
the substitution of a "cash and car
ry" act was there anything like a I
split of the electorate.
REVISION FAVORED
Slightly more than half —57 per
cent. —of the ballots favored substi
tution of the new legislation. Yet
that small majority who urged re
vision evidently did so without any j
particular feeling of friendship I
toward the Allies, for a scant 16 per
cent signified any willingness to
fight for those same Allies should
Germany appear to be winning the
present war.
Most surprising single disclosure,
perhaps, was the final question in
which 37 per cent of the votes cast
indicated that they would prefer
imprisonment to acceptance of a j
European war draft.
The greatest single majority was
that accorded the problem of an at
tack on the United States. Ninety
one per cent would willingly defend
their country from invasion; yet. 84
per cent would rather stay home if
the Allies appeared in danger of de
feat.
UTOPIAN SOLUTION
Equally varied was the question
of volunteering or waiting draft.
Seventy-six per cent would shy from
volunteering while 69 per cent would
accept the draft. Discrepancies in
the poll naturally occurred through
failure of several voters to answer
every question.
While most of the ballots were
filled out formally, the typical col
lege man's desire to be heard
brought out additional material
which naturally could not be used
in the formal poll. Outstanding so
lution to the entire war-neutrality
jig-saw was proffered by the voter
who left his calling card and this
Utopian solution: "I won't go to war.
I'm going to South America, marry
an heiress, and drink myself to 1
death."
