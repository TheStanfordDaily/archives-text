WITH THE GERMAN ARMY,
ON THE WESTERN FRONT, Sept.
28 (UP). —From the German front
line positions on the east bank of
the Rhine I looked 200 yards across
the river today and watched French
soldiers washing clothes and fishing.
That is the way the war is going
on this 150-mile section of the
western front, from Karlsruhe south
to the Swiss border.
From where I stood on the Ger
man side of the Rhine frontier I
could plainly see a French armored
turret of the Maginot Line, its tri
color emblem fluttering defiance at
the Nazi swastika flying atop one of
the steel and concrete fangs of the
German westwall.
FIRING SPORADIC
German soldiers in the front lines
told me that there may be a shot or
two a week, but usually they go un
answered.
The Germans told me that just, a
few days ago the French across the
river staged an impromptu vaude
ville show in front of their turret,
singing, dancing and laughing.
The French soldiers wave to their
Nazi enemies and the Germans wave
back, sometimes mockingly giving
the clenched fist salute of the Com
munist red front.
The comraderie between the "ene
mies" on the Rhine isn't found ev
erywhere, to be sure, but nowhere
along the Rhine did I hear any such
firing as occurred yesterday when
four other correspondents and my
self visited the Zwiebruecken area
of the 100-mile sector between the
Rhine and Moselle Rivers.
GIANT GUN
Well inside the German frontier
on the upper Rhine my four con
ferees of the foreign press and I saw
a giant German gun able to fire
miles-deep into French territory.
But it was muzzled and cold.
German officers told me gravely
that it could be fired only on special
orders from Berlin.
Some of the heavy artillery in the
Rhineland forts is mounted in ar
mored turrets faked to look like
timbered country dwellings.
Completing our 650-mile inspec
tion of Germany's westwall it is
easy to understand the statements
of the German general staff that any
attack upon these bands of fortifica
tions, miles deep, must be at a ter
rific cost of life for the enemy.

a giant German gun able to fire
miles-deep into French territory.
But it was muzzled and cold.
German officers told me gravely
that it could be fired only on special
orders from Berlin.
Some of the heavy artillery in the
Rhineland forts is mounted in ar
mored turrets faked to look like
timbered country dwellings.
Completing our 650-mile inspec
tion of Germany's westwall it is
easy to understand the statements
of the German general staff that any
attack upon these bands of fortifica
tions, miles deep, must be at a ter
rific cost of life for the enemy.

WITH THE GERMAN ARMY,
ON THE WESTERN FRONT, Sept.
28 (UP). —From the German front
line positions on the east bank of
the Rhine I looked 200 yards across
the river today and watched French
soldiers washing clothes and fishing.
That is the way the war is going
on this 150-mile section of the
western front, from Karlsruhe south
to the Swiss border.
From where I stood on the Ger
man side of the Rhine frontier I
could plainly see a French armored
turret of the Maginot Line, its tri
color emblem fluttering defiance at
the Nazi swastika flying atop one of
the steel and concrete fangs of the
German westwall.
FIRING SPORADIC
German soldiers in the front lines
told me that there may be a shot or
two a week, but usually they go un
answered.
The Germans told me that just, a
few days ago the French across the
river staged an impromptu vaude
ville show in front of their turret,
singing, dancing and laughing.
The French soldiers wave to their
Nazi enemies and the Germans wave
back, sometimes mockingly giving
the clenched fist salute of the Com
munist red front.
The comraderie between the "ene
mies" on the Rhine isn't found ev
erywhere, to be sure, but nowhere
along the Rhine did I hear any such
firing as occurred yesterday when
four other correspondents and my
self visited the Zwiebruecken area
of the 100-mile sector between the
Rhine and Moselle Rivers.
GIANT GUN
Well inside the German frontier
on the upper Rhine my four con
ferees of the foreign press and I saw
a giant German gun able to fire
miles-deep into French territory.
But it was muzzled and cold.
German officers told me gravely
that it could be fired only on special
orders from Berlin.
