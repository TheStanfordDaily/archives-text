# Aviation Course Has Vacancies
## 
### 
Aviation Ground School I, Stan
ford's class for civilian aviators, still
can accommodate a limited number
of candidates for permanent places
in the class.
Fearing that many students may
have been discouraged by reports on
the physical examination, Dr. Web
ster said. "It seems from conversa
tions with prospective students that
the severity of the physical exami
nation, real as it is, has been some
what exaggerated by repetition, and
many good candidates may have
been led to underestimate their
chances."
Students still wishing to investi
gate the course are urged bv Dr.
Webster to see him in his office in
Room 385. Other information given
by Dr. Webster included:
1. Those students who already
have won their air licenses are in
eligible for the course.
2. No military obligations are at
tached to the training program un
der which Stanford has been sub
sidized by the federal government.
3. Permission of parents is neces
sary before students may enroll in
the course.
4. Schedule has been finally set at
MTWThF 7.
