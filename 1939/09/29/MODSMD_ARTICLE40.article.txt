# Card Yearling Gridmen Tapering Off for Initial Tilt With Modesto J.C.
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Climaxing throe weeks of intense drill, Coach Harry Shipkey's frosh
eleven will taper oIT todyy with only signal practice in anticipation of then
grid debut tomorrow against Modesto Junior College.
The opening kickoll' against the Jaysees at 12 o'clock will officially in
augurate Stanford's football season. And Modesto will he a tough season's
opener for they are consistently the*

strongest Jaysee outfit in Northern
California.
However, the Papooses have plen
ty of fireworks to shoot at their ri
vals in tomorrow's battle. For speed
there is little and shifty A1 Cole
plus husky and hustling Eric Ann
strong. For power Shipkey has the
mature and talented Milt Vucinich
and a carrot-topped line cracker,
Red Taylor.
TACKLES BEEFY
On Vucinich's husky shoulders fall
the passing and punting burdtns.
In Stamm and Norburg are a pair
of physically ideal ends—lanky, fast,
rugged. The tackles, Robinson and
Banducci, are both beefy and yet
agile and skillful enough with their
hands to move opposing linesmen
around in a hurry. «
The typical guard is built low to !
the ground and packs plenty of
beef. And McCain and Palmer fill
these qualifications to the last let
ter. While the first-string center, i
Bob Mannon, is a rangy six-looter
who does a good job of line-backing.
Yesterday Shipkey and his assist
ants, Bill Paulman and Louis Tsou
tsouvas, drilled the frosh against'
Modesto plays. Emphasis was put on
choking off the Jaysee pass plays |
and plugging holes in the line on j
cut-backs, both favorite weapons
of the invaders.
LINEMEN BURDENED
Also the linemen were burdened
with double blocking assignments in
case Modesto uses first a seven and
then a five-man line as has been
their habit.
This year's outfit will have to
hustle to uphold the record of last j
season's unbeaten, untied eleven, but j
they certainly have the material and |
the fire to do just that.
The starting lineup is: left end,
Norburg; left tackle, Robinson; left
guard, McCain; center, Mannon;
light guard, Palmer; right tackle, |
Banducci; right end, Stamm; quar- |
terback, Taylor; left half, Cole; right
half, Armstrong; fullback. Vucinich. i


(;ENE COLDIRON, varsity quar
terback, will start his last year of
college competition tomorrow
when the Indians meet the
Beavers.
