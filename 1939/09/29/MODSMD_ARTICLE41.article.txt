# Manager Names Mural Deadline
## 
### 
Today will definitely be the* last
day for any organization to enter a j
team in the fall intramural sports !
program, which consists of touch i
football, volleyball, golf, and horse- |
shoes.
That was the word from Intra- J
mural Manager Andy Stojkovich as
he awaited the completion of the
sign-up period, at which time he
and Kenny Davidson, who will
handle football and golf, will go to
work lining up schedules, leagues,
and other details.
Yesterday the sign-up for foot- j
ball swelled to 37 teams, about 15 !
teams short of what is hoped for. j
Meanwhile, the other entrance lists !
have been growing steadily until
yesterday there were approximately j
25 teams entered for each of the j
other sports.
