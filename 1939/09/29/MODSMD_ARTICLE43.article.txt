CINCINNATI. Sept. 27 (UP). —!
The Cincinnati Reds added another
amazing chapter to baseball history !
Thursday when they became the first j
team ever to make the jump from j
last place to a pennant in two years.
Last in 15337 the Reds climbed to
fourth place last season and com
pleted their journey to baseball's
promised land in Cincinnati when
they defeated the St. Louis Cardi
nals, 5-3, in the pennant clinching
game.
It was the second National League
pennant won by Cincinnati and the
first since Pat Moran's Reds copped
' the 1019 (lag and became an inno- i
! cent party to "the Black Sox" World i
; Series scandal. In the 1919 World
; Series which almost wrecked base
: ball, eight members of the American |
; League champion White Sox sold out
to gamblers and the Reds won the i
| world championship, five out of |
i eight games.
With the National League pennant)
safely tucked away the Reds will
. now turn their attention toward try- I
i ing to stop the New York Yankees i
in the World Series—a trick which
i the Giants in 1936 and 1937 and the
Cubs in 1938 found beyond their
scope. Already Jack Doyle, Broad
j way betting commissioner, has j
quoted 1 to 3 against the Yanks in
j the early odds lor the World Series
| opening next week.
