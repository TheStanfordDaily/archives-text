## Coach Thornton Worried About Waterdogs' Offense 
### 
Offense was still the big worry of
Coach Nort Thornton today as the
waterdogs continued practice for the
opening encounter of the season on
Thursday, Oct. 5, against San Jose
State.
The Spartan battle—scheduled for
local waters with the doors open to
the public free of charge -should be
the best ever in the Indian-State
series.
COACH WORRIED
Things have changed a lot, ex
plains Thornton, since three years
ago when the Cardinal poloists
squelched the attempts of the southr
ern seven, 27 to 0, for something
like an all-time high score record at
the ducking sport.
The Spartans have since grown
and, like their football team, are
making a bid for a place in the big
time water-polo. Coach Thornton is
worried over the possibilities of such
an entrance at the expense of his
team next week.
OFFENSE BAD
Besides the fact the Staters have
an outstanding outfit which is of vet
eran calibre, Thornton explains that
Stanford's offense is In bad shape.
The Stanford mentor is not worry
ing about the defense, backed by
two all-conference men, nor is he
worrying about controlling the ball.
The trouble, however, is that no one
can shoot, except Captain Bob Plate,
sprint, who has potted a couple.
PRACTICE DISCOURAGING
In practice the other day the jun
ior varsity had two men on the side
lines, and the varsity, faced by only
five opponents, could not score.
Thornton hopes that this may be

partly due to the goalie work of
Frank Downing and Bill Burns.
The Cardinals have two games be
fore opening the conference against
U.C.L.A. They will not play in the
junior nationals Sunday in San
Francisco.
