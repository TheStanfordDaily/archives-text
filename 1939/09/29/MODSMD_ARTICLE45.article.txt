CORVALLIS, Ore., Sept. 28 (UP).
â€”Coach Lon Stiner of the Oregon
State College Beavers broke his si
lence today to protest newspaper
predictions of a "dark horse" State
team. "We've lost a lot of lettermen,
and we're going up against Stanford
Saturday with a line which includes
four new men," Stiner said. "How
ever, I think we'll give them a good
battle, and they can look for plenty
of left and right-handed passing
mixed in with our running plays."
