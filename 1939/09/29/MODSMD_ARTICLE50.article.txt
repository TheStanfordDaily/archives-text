TO WIN O.S.C. GAME
I guess I'll pick Stanford to win
! tomorrow's game against Oregon j
1 State.
I wasn't sure for a while just who '
i I thought would win the tussle, but i
1 my confidence in the Indian team is j
: rapidly soaring.
For one thing, the attitude of the j
Card grid outfit is 100 per cent bet- j
ter than it was for the season- j
i opener last season against Santa ;
I Clara. At that time the San F ran- :
j cisco newspapers and the Daily had \
j been touting the Cards for a pos- i
: sible Coast, championship. Despite j
j the fact that the Cards were playing !
I a Bronco outfit that hadn't lost a j
! game in over two seasons, the Cards |
j went into the game overconfident. i
The Broncos won the game, 22-0, j
and had two other touchdowns !
! called back on penalties. Stan- !
ford's confidence, on stilts before }
(be game, collapsed like a pneu- |
malic lung, and it took Tiny |
Thornhill weeks to build it up !
1 again.
But the Card footballers enter
tomorrow's conflict with an en
tirely different attitude. The boys
have a determined confidence.
I But also, they have blood in their
eye.
The San Francisco newspapers,
j anxious not to go overboard on the i
i Cards again and look foolish as they
I did last year, have been laying it to
i Thornhillmen. And the Knights of
: the Farm are pretty sore.
Especially noticeable is the reac-
I tion of the tackles, who by far have
j had to bear the brunt of the poor.
! publicity. One of his fraternity,

brothers told me that "Swede" Jo
hansen is so riled up that he is ready
to chew the tail right off the invad
ing Beaver. This despite a sore
shoulder the Swede is carrying
around.
And Stan Andersen, who has had
to swallow more criticism than any
football player on the outfit, has
proved himself a great competitor on
the actual field of battle. Compet
ing in the shot put last spring, Stan
constantly did much better in the
meets than he did in practice.
Considering his vastly superior
playing under game conditions
and surrounded by the inspired
attitude of his teammates, the
f.os ihility of Andersen playing
the sensational way he has at
times is far from remote.
Although two of San Francisco's
leading sports writers reputedly
have offered 14 points and taken
Oregon State, the Indians who
played 'ast year remember how
they '.narehed right through the
Bearer line at will, only to have
" e offense bog down inside the 20-
yard line.
The Beavers finally won the game,
when a Cardinal forward pass
bounced off a receiver into the hands
of Vic Kohler, who incidentally is
out of tomorrow's fray with in
juries. Kohler toured his way over
60 yards for the only score of the
game.
And from that line, which the
Cards easily controlled, the best
guard and two best ends graduated.
