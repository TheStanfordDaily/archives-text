EVEN sacrosanct Stanford, tucked away in
its 9,000 acres, far from the world and its
troubles, has proved itself vulnerable to the icy
steel of war. It has taken the prospect of fight
ing in the trenches, of his body hanging on
barbed wire, of a bayonet stuck through his
middle to pierce the indifference of the typical
student toward everything outside of his per
sonal sphere.
Registering campus opinion in the poll con
ducted yesterday by The Daily, Stanford proved
itself to be determined to keep the United States
out of the European war, 84 per cent holding
that even the threat of a German victory would
not justify our entering the conflict.
Such an attitude, if it were typical of the
entire nation and could withstand the attacks
of what promises to be the heaviest barrage of
propaganda in history, would be the most ef
fective possible means of keeping the United
States out of war. If, when the landslide starts,
the leaders of the country can keep their heads
above water, we probably will be saved.
Assuming that Congress had declared war,
almost one-fourth of the voters, a normal num
ber, declared they would volunteer, but the
surprisingly large total of 37 per cent asserted
that they would refuse to serve, even at the
risk of disgrace and imprisonment.
Although certain self-appointed judges and
moralists will deem this figure sufficient to mark
the student body as over one-third pacifist,
Stanford knows that the percentage of con
scientious objectors who voted is high above
the percentage of middle-of-the-roaders, con
tent to accept the inevitable without bothering
to cast a straw vote to say so.
If it was not an accurate representation of
campus opinion, it may be asked, exactly what
was the value of the poll?
The answer is this: it has proved, beyond any
possible doubt, that Stanford is standing strong
and firm behind every wisely directed effort to
keep the United States out of war. And more
important still, it shows that those who are to
become the nation's leaders of tomorrow will
have brains enough to keep the last flame of
democracy from extinguishing itself.
