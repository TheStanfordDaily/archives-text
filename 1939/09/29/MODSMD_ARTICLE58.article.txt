# They're Off!
## 
### 
WARM sunlight slants through the goal posts
onto the white-lined turf of the Stadium,
a zebra-striped official raises his hands, the
whistle shrills from the field, and the Stanford
Red piles into Oregon State College to open
the 1939 football season.
You've been yelling since you entered the
big coliseum. Your throat is getting sore, and
the sound gradually drops in volume until, as
the afternoon fades into evening, you scream
in whispers.
You are cold when the sun is gone, and you
swear gently at the people who remain stand
ing in front of you after a good piay is over.
You go home tired and cold and hungry.
But it's worth it, and then some.
No sport can touch the thrill of college foot
ball—especially when it is your own team, your
own rooting section, your own campus.
Stanford football has always been at the top
as far as the thrill and the color are concerned.
In the days of the "Vow Boys" the school lived
and breathed football. In the lean years since,
enthusiasm has slackened only a little. Cham
pion or dweller in the cellar, the student body
considers football first, for itself, and results are
secondary.
No one knows yet how the 1939 varsity will
look in action. No one can foretell the end of
the always unpredictable Coast Conference.

The Big Red Machine may be a smooth-running
winner, or it may be a rusty dud.
But on top, or at the bottom, it is the Big Red
Machine—of and for Stanford —and will be
yelled and screamed at just as thoroughly this
new season as before.—J. B.
