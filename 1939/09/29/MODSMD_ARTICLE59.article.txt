# . . . And Make It Loud!

ONCE upon a time there was a rooting sec
tion. Small in number but valiant in spirit,
for three years it cheered Stanford's "Vowing
Sophomores" on to victory. Clear, sharp, and
loud the syllables of the Old Spell, Skyrocket,
and Axe Yell ripped back and forth across the
Stadium.
At last the dame came when Grayson, Ham
ilton, Moscrip, and Alustiza had to graduate,
and as they left the Cardinal gridiron, the spirit
of the cheering section gradually seemed to dis
appear with them. Of course it was easier to
yell for brilliant ail-Americans than for a bunch
of green youngsters, fumbling and muffing
plays, but all of them were Stanford men—and
equally deserving of the support of their stu
dent body.
Perhaps it was the fault of the yell leaders,
perhaps of Rally Committee, that for three long
years most of the cheers hardly carried to the
other side of the field, and the songs could
scarcely be heard above the music of the band.
Whatever the reason, the performance did not
reflect well on Stanford.
This week we are starting a new year, and
tomorrow a new football season. Although the
experts do not pick cur team to win the Con
ference, the boys can be counted on to make
a creditable showing —and above all, to beat
Cal.
The 1939 football squad is one that every
student can be proud of, and let us hope that
when the players run out on the field tomor
row, the student body will sound as if it is
really standing behind them.
Let every syllable split the elements of the
air, and let the rolling foothills rise to something
louder than an indistinct hum. And the rooting
section will be doing its part to help Stanford
win the game.
