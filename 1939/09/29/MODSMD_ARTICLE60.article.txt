CANADIAN BACON AND I ISII ROE
states besides Huey Long's Louisiana have pro
duced so many human-fantasias as Southern
California. The sunny southland is my home, and I
love it for its beauties. But Dr. Townsend, Ham and
Eggs' Sherman Bainbridge, and Aimee Scmple Mc-
Pherson are neither my, nor Earl Carrol's, nor the Na
tional Geographic Society's idea of scenic beauties.
Scenic wonders, yes. But beauties, no.
There is room for reasonable conjecture as to which
of Southern California's intelelctual trapeze artists is
the cleverest at robbing both Peter and Paul to pay
themselves. The venerable Dr. Townsend solved his
own old-age problem quite adequately. Aimee, on the
other hand, amply financed her gay young middle age,
kept the devil away from Angelus Temple by screaming
"Hallelujah!" and earned herself several well-built hus
bands. Now, that political moron Sherman Bainbridge,
and other astute philanthropists who are offering to
give away and take away other people's money, are
riding high on the crest of popular ignorance and $30-
every-Thursday. No, there's not much to choose among
the business minds of our shrewdest crack-pots.

OUT what I am wondering about is the next great
movement that will sweep our shambles of a state
after people are gettign thirty dollars on the maid's day
out, or the next mighty surge of stupidity even if Ham
and-Eggs goes the way of $200-u-month, Mah Jong,
and Monopoly, Canadian-bacon-and-caviar might ap
peal to a new audience; Ham-and-Eggs is so unrefined.
But there you run into invidious comparisons. Maybe
something provocative like "Who wants a new car
every month?" might be more effective.
But whatever the slogan, there's sure to be a re
vival. Barnum was right; there is a sucker born every
minute. And a lot of them seem 1o be born in Cali
fornia. But. all the suckers aren't fighting for Thirty
dollars-every-Thursday. Some of them are opposing
it.
We aren't suckers in the same sense at all: wc have
had enough of an education and our families have
enough to lose so that we are opposed to an insane
panacea —by information and by habit.. But having
that information we ought to be more concerned with
the problems and the needs that underlie these pe
riodic eruptions of demagogery. It is true that $30
every week as planned in the current nonsense-bill
cannot be had. But it is just as true that unemploy
ment and its conjoined economic illnesses must be
cured before people will stop asking for $30 a week—or
$200 a month, or Canadian bacon and fish roe.
Our first concern is to beat Ham-and-Eggs. But let's
not forget that unless the educated solve the problem,
the uneducated and the unscrupulous will. We'll still
have to beat Fifty-Dollars-on-Friday.
