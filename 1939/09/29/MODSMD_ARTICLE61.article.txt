## PROPAGANDA-PROOF? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The other day I noticed an AP dispatch recording
the fact that Sir Alfred Duff Cooper has recently been
appointed a representative to the British Bureau of
Propaganda. Yesterday I saw in Time Magazine for
Sept. 25 that Eve Curie has just "prepared lectures on
scientific subjects for the (French) Information Min
istry." Then today I learned that we are having both
of these propagandists on our lecture series this year.
So unless Time and the AP have their facts crossed,
we're in for a light dose of mixed fact and fiction.
I suppose it's not such a bad idea at that. Having
full-blown propagandists to listen to is a change to say
the least, and it will give us a chance to .see how propa
ganda-proof we are.
But there is one objectionable feature to the pro
gram, however, which I would like to call attention to.
That is the fact that when we pay to hear Mme.
Curie and Sir Alfred, that will make the second time
they have been paid. Their own governments pay
them once, then we pav them again. I object to this.
There is nothing \vronsl with spending an evening or so
sifting fact and fiction, but on the other hand, it seems
going too far to have to pay for the privilege.
