### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
THE old adage about all roads
leading to Rome has come in for
a lot of refurbishing these days. The
Russo-German appeal to Mussolini
to plead the case of totalitarianism
with the Allies shows the statement
is still partially true.
But a strong competitor with "the
eternal city" as terminus of real and
imaginary highways is Moscow, sud
denly the capital of the Continent.
Railroad stations and airports are
crowded with arriving diplomats.
Suitcases bearing the tags of nearly
every large and small European
embassy await delivery. Ribben
trop and his staff of 33 experts, in
Moscow to map strategy for future
Russo-German activities, swelled
the number of "visiting notables."

The foreign minister of Latvia,
Viihelms Munters, is flying to Mos
cow today at the invitation of the
Soviet government to find how Lat
via stands in view of last week's
Russian-Estonian accord. A British
report said that 20 divisions of the
Red army which were massed along
the Estonian border to enforce
Stalin's demands have been shifted
to the Latvian border for the same
purpose.

I ATVIA, of course, is quaking
u in its boots at the thought of
Russia's continuing her policy of
lining up the Baltic buffer states.
With Estonia virtually a Russian
protectorate, unconfirmed dis
patches indicated that the same
demands would be levelled against
Estonia. These were thought to
include (1) a new commercial
treaty, (2) a mutual assistance
pact like the one Estonia signed.
(.'{) the right to station Russian
troops in the port of Lihau above
Memcl and (4) provisions that
Lihau and Windau will become
free ports for Russian exports.
The Turkish foreign chieftain,
Sukru Saracoglu, was another vis
iting diplomat who had a long talk
with Molotov that "lasted more than
four hours." Josef Stalin and the
vice - foreign - commissar, Vladimir
Potemkin, attended, as well as the
Soviet ambassador to Turkey and
the Turkish ambassador to Russia.

There was, of course, no indica
tion as to what demands Russia was
making on Turkey, but the fact the
Sunday conference lasted from 6
p.m. to after midnight was taken to
mean that some rather broad pro
gram was under consideration.
The possibility that Japanese offi
cials are somewhat irked at the
Russo-German alliance was shown
by a reliable foreign office spokes
man in Tokyo who said, last night,
that the agreement splitting up Po
land is inconsistent with the anti-
Comintern agreement in which
Germany, Italy and Japan form a
front since it increases instead of
diminishes the growth of Com
munism.

"GERMAN leniency" toward
9 communists also was incon
sistent with Germany's avowed
agreements and objectives, the of
ficial said. Coming on the heels of
the Soviet-Japanese "cease fight
ing" pact, the sharp Japanese
criticism may mean that the Ori
ental question is still very much
undecided. A lot of fireworks may
ensue in the next week.
All Soviet activities along the
Baltic and efforts to consolidate
Turkish support give added credence
to Winston Churchill's assertion yes
terday that Stalin has brought to a
"dead stop" Fuehrer Hitler's ambi
tions to extend his domination into
eastern and southeastern Europe.
