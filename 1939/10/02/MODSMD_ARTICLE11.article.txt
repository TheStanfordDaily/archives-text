# Flying Days Over, Air Line Hostess Lands at Stanford
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Tradition says that an air-hostess always retires to get married, either
to lanky eo-piiots or wealthy passengers whom they've nursed through
the bitter stages of air sickness.
But Henrietta Mumaw broke the time-honored rule when she left Trans
continental Western Airlines two weeks ago for a prc-mcd course at

Stanford. Being an air-hostess
fun, she says, but microscopes and
cadavers seem to hold a fatal fasci
nation for this former "A" student
from the University of Pittsburgh.
After graduating from high school
in Pittsburgh, Miss Mumaw looked
around for the wherewithal to ob
tain a college education. Looking
netted her nothing, and she entered
training at South Side Hospital in
Pittsburgh.
RECEIVES SCHOLARSHIP
In 1937 she finished her training
and matriculated at the University
of Pittsburgh. Simultaneously she
got herself a job at Pittsburgh
Children's Hospital. School took up
her days and nursing took up her
nights. She managed to sandwich
about five hours daily which she
frittered away in sleeping and eat
ing.
Along the end of 1938, things be
gan to get difficult. The nursing
was not paying enough to keep her
in school and besides she says,
amazedly, "I was getting tired and
my grades were slipping to B's."
Then she received word that she
had been awarded the Margaret
Enright Scholarship for the best
pre-med student at Pittsburgh. An
other year in school was insured.
CHOSEN FOR HOSTESS
Last May, TWA officials came to
Pittsburgh searching for hostesses.
She was qualified (height between 5
ft. 2 in. and 5 ft. 4 in., weight be
tween 105 and 110 pounds, attractive,
and a graduate nurse) so she took
her finals three weeks before school
was out, and flew immediately to
Kansas City, Mo., for two weeks of
air hostess school.
From last June until two weeks
ago, Miss Mumaw divided her time
between Kansas City, New York,
Albuquerque, and Burbank. On the
Albuquerque-Burbank run she met
a prominent Kansas City doctor who
became interested in her medical
career, and he and several of his
colleagues made up a scholarship
for her which will see her through
her medical course.
"I had no idea even of exactly
where Stanford was until two
weeks ago," she says happily, "but
I'm sure that you who are native
Californians can't appreciate how
beautiful it is. You should go to
school in a skyscraper- it's terrible."

Enright Scholarship for the best
pre-med student at Pittsburgh. An
other year in school was insured.
CHOSEN FOR HOSTESS
Last May, TWA officials came to
Pittsburgh searching for hostesses.
She was qualified (height between 5
ft. 2 in. and 5 ft. 4 in., weight be
tween 105 and 110 pounds, attractive,
and a graduate nurse) so she took
her finals three weeks before school
was out, and flew immediately to
Kansas City, Mo., for two weeks of
air hostess school.
From last June until two weeks
ago, Miss Mumaw divided her time
between Kansas City, New York,
Albuquerque, and Burbank. On the
Albuquerque-Burbank run she met
a prominent Kansas City doctor who
became interested in her medical
career, and he and several of his
colleagues made up a scholarship
for her which will see her through
her medical course.
"I had no idea even of exactly
where Stanford was until two
weeks ago," she says happily, "but
I'm sure that you who are native
Californians can't appreciate how
beautiful it is. You should go to
school in a skyscraper- it's terrible."
Tradition says that an air-hostess always retires to get married, either
to lanky eo-piiots or wealthy passengers whom they've nursed through
the bitter stages of air sickness.
But Henrietta Mumaw broke the time-honored rule when she left Trans
continental Western Airlines two weeks ago for a prc-mcd course at

Stanford. Being an air-hostess
fun, she says, but microscopes and
cadavers seem to hold a fatal fasci
nation for this former "A" student
from the University of Pittsburgh.
After graduating from high school
in Pittsburgh, Miss Mumaw looked
around for the wherewithal to ob
tain a college education. Looking
netted her nothing, and she entered
training at South Side Hospital in
Pittsburgh.
RECEIVES SCHOLARSHIP
In 1937 she finished her training
and matriculated at the University
of Pittsburgh. Simultaneously she
got herself a job at Pittsburgh
Children's Hospital. School took up
her days and nursing took up her
nights. She managed to sandwich
about five hours daily which she
frittered away in sleeping and eat
ing.
Along the end of 1938, things be
gan to get difficult. The nursing
was not paying enough to keep her
in school and besides she says,
amazedly, "I was getting tired and
my grades were slipping to B's."
Then she received word that she
had been awarded the Margaret
Enright Scholarship for the best
pre-med student at Pittsburgh. An
other year in school was insured.
