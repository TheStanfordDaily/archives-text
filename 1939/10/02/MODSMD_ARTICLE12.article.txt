# Dr. Wilbur Hits 'Ham and Eggs'
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur told
a San Jose State freshman assem
bly Thursday that Ham and Eggs
advocates art trying to make natural
law, whereas democracy requires
that we first discover what are natu
ral laws and then try to live by
them.
In defiance of experts, he said, the
Ham and Eggs advocates would
fanatically change economic law by
counting noses. "They do this," he
said, "on the chance they will get
something for nothing, if they live
long enough to get it."
"Unless we learn to boss our
glands instead of allowing them to
boss us, we shall inevitably commit
suicide as a nation," Dr. Wilbur
warned. "Your real job here is to
learn to run your glands with their
various endocrines and not let them
run you. Self-discipline is essential
for all students."
