# Wheat Stocks Rise with War
## Farm Survey Shows Billion Bushels Excess 
### 
Stanford University Food Research
economists, in their annual survey
on wheat prices, announced yester
day that, world wheat stocks were
at near-record figures when Europe
opened its mass war last month.
The survey showed that wheat
stocks were in excess of one billion
bushels at the time of the war dec
laration, with another huge wheat
crop predicted for the 1939-40 sea
son. Exceptional harvests in the
1938-39 season have made the cur
rent records possible, they asserted.
Mrs. Helen C. Farnsworth and Hol
brook Working, who prepared the
survey, said in comment that such
unpredictable phenomena as chang
ing governmental policies would pos
sibly alter the future price levels but
that only a crop failure in Argentina
or Australia, or heavy destruction of
wheat being carried to war zones,
could '"prevent world wheat stocks
from rising to a new high level in
1940."
The report further said:
"There now is little question that
stocks of old-crop wheat on August
1, 1940, will be of record size, per
haps some 50,000,000 to 100,000,000
bushels larger than the present rec
ord carry-over of 1934." The sur
plus in that year was 1,168,000,000
bushels.
"We are inclined to the the view,"
the local wheat economists conclud
ed, "that North American wheat
prices are more likely to decline
moderately than to advance from
the levels of mid-September.
