# Western Peace Plan Developed In Convention
## 21 American Nations Agree on Neutrality, 'Safety Band' Ideas 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Oct. 1 (UP). â€”
Complete agreement on a program
designed to preserve peace in the
Western Hemisphere was reached
tonight by delegates of 21 American
nations. Included were agreements
on the thorniest details concerning
neutrality and a "safety band"
around the Americas.
Harmony was achieved after long
conferences today.
The Argentine and Chilean dele
gations, which had been delaying
agreement on the neutrality and
"safety band" proposals, were un
derstood to have received instruc
tions to "go along" on these proj
ects, clearing the way for final
agreement and adjournment.
300-MILE LIMIT SOUGHT
Some details remain to be smooth
ed out, but the delegates anticipate
no trouble. It was understood that
the Chilean delegation will seek to
have the "safety band" fixed at 50
miles from American shores, but
most of the delegates believe that
Chile is likely to yield to the ma
jority opinion and fix the limit at
300 miles.
A proposal to close American
ports to submarines is being re
drafted and the final text will not be
available before noon tomorrow, but
it is anticipated that it will leave the
way open for individual govern
ments to adopt their own policy
toward submarines. The resolution is
expected to provide that any Amer
ican republic may close its ports to
submarines, with the probability
that all will do so except Argentina
and possibly Uruguay.
Sumner Welles, head of the United
States delegation, commenting on
today's sessions, said that remarkable
harmony enabled surprising head
way to be made toward agreement.
TO SUBMIT DRAFTS
The completed drafts of neutrality
and "safety band" proposals are ex
pected to be submitted by the re
spective subcommittees tomorrow
morning. A full executive plenary
session is expected to be held on
Tuesday morning for approval of all
projects, with a public plenary ses
sion and closing speeches scheduled
for Tuesday afternoon.
It was believed likely that the
conference would approve another
meeting in October, 1940. in Havana.
In the opinion of most delegates,
the decisions reached at this con
sultation of the American nations
are more important and far-reach
ing than at any previous meeting in
the history of Pan America.
