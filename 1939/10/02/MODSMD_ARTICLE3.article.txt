# Germany, Italy Combine In Peace Demand; Russia Tightens Grasp on Baltic
## Hitler Wants Duce as Go-between To Make Appeals to Allies; Latvia Feared Next Morsel in Soviet Diet 
### United Press 
Germany and Italy got together Sunday on plans for a "mighty final
effort" to persuade the Allies to call off the war while Soviet Russia, still
professing neutrality, appeared to be tightening systematically her strangle
hold 011 the little Baltic nations.
Before this week is out the world probably will know whether it is to

be a merciless war to the finish—4
three, four or five years—and there I
may be clearer indications of
whether Russia and Italy will be
able to remain clear of the conflict, j
Dispatches from European capi
tals Sunday night indicated that Lat- !
via soon may go the way of her j
northern neighbor, Estonia, which
last, Friday was reduced to the status i
of a virtual Soviet protectorate.
CIANO SUMMONED
Adolf Hitler conferred in Berlin !
with Italy's dapper young foreign j
minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, who j
was summoned there from Rome to
hear the details of the Nazi-Soviet 1
"peace offensive" and supposedly to
agree to a proposal whereby his
father-in-law. Premier Benito Mus
solini, would serve as the go-be
tween. The plan as outlined by in
formed Nazis calls for Mussolini to
launch the "mighty final effort" for
peace by direct appeals to Britain
and France.
If he fails—and Britain and France
are refusing to listen to peace pro
posals from any quarter—Mussolini
runs the risk of being plunged into
the war on Hitler's side because of
the existing Italo-German military
alliance.
Winston Churchill, first lord of the
British admiralty and dominating
figure on the new British "war cabi
net," told the world in a radio ad
dress Sunday night that the war
will end only when Britain is con
vinced that "Hitler has had enough."
That, of course, must mean the
crushing of Hitlerism because Adolf
Hitler cannot survive in defeat.
HITLER MUST FIGHT
Hitler's course of action in event
of the probable Anglp-French re
jection seems to have been clearly
set. If Mussolini plugs for peace on
his behalf and fails, Hitler probably
will go before an already-summoned
session of his Reichstag the latter
part of this week and serve a "peace
ultimatum" on the Allies. This ulti
matum may be expected to carry the
threat of war to the finish by every
possible means — devastating air
raids and ruthless submarine war
fare — and probably a new threat
that Russia's enormous Red army
may fight on Germany's side to
crush the western powers.
A semi-official statement in Ber
lin warned that Hitler does not in
tend to wait long for the Allies to
decide; that "Germany and Russia
are equally determined to attain
their goal as quickly as possible—
namely, to halt the present war."
ITALY SHUNS WAR
Italy seemed to be showing scant
enthusiasm for Ciano's visit to Ber
lin and the Fascist press stressed
"economics and peace" rather than
the eventuality of Italian military
aid. Since Hitler's new working ar
rangement with the Soviets was an
nounced last week the Italians have
regarded it warily and suspiciously.
Churchill, in his radio talk Sun
day night, asserted that Russia's in
vasion of Poland and the agreement
with Hitler was due to Josef Stalin's
mistrust of the Nazi Fuehrer rather
than to friendship. He justified Rus
sia's invasion of Poland as "neces
sary" to protect Soviet interests
against "the Nazi menace" and said
that Stalin had brought to a "dead
stop" Hitler's ambitions of domi
nating the Baltic states, the Ukraine,
Rumania, Bulgaria and Turkey.

CIANO SUMMONED
Adolf Hitler conferred in Berlin !
with Italy's dapper young foreign j
minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, who j
was summoned there from Rome to
hear the details of the Nazi-Soviet 1
"peace offensive" and supposedly to
agree to a proposal whereby his
father-in-law. Premier Benito Mus
solini, would serve as the go-be
tween. The plan as outlined by in
formed Nazis calls for Mussolini to
launch the "mighty final effort" for
peace by direct appeals to Britain
and France.
If he fails—and Britain and France
are refusing to listen to peace pro
posals from any quarter—Mussolini
runs the risk of being plunged into
the war on Hitler's side because of
the existing Italo-German military
alliance.
Winston Churchill, first lord of the
British admiralty and dominating
figure on the new British "war cabi
net," told the world in a radio ad
dress Sunday night that the war
will end only when Britain is con
vinced that "Hitler has had enough."
That, of course, must mean the
crushing of Hitlerism because Adolf
Hitler cannot survive in defeat.
HITLER MUST FIGHT
Hitler's course of action in event
of the probable Anglp-French re
jection seems to have been clearly
set. If Mussolini plugs for peace on
his behalf and fails, Hitler probably
will go before an already-summoned
session of his Reichstag the latter
part of this week and serve a "peace
ultimatum" on the Allies. This ulti
matum may be expected to carry the
threat of war to the finish by every
possible means — devastating air
raids and ruthless submarine war
fare — and probably a new threat
that Russia's enormous Red army
may fight on Germany's side to
crush the western powers.
A semi-official statement in Ber
lin warned that Hitler does not in
tend to wait long for the Allies to
decide; that "Germany and Russia
are equally determined to attain
their goal as quickly as possible—
namely, to halt the present war."
ITALY SHUNS WAR
Italy seemed to be showing scant
enthusiasm for Ciano's visit to Ber
lin and the Fascist press stressed
"economics and peace" rather than
the eventuality of Italian military
aid. Since Hitler's new working ar
rangement with the Soviets was an
nounced last week the Italians have
regarded it warily and suspiciously.
