The attitude of the peoples of the
world at the time of the Czecho

the History Department, when he

On a year's sabbatical leave for |
research, Professor Savelle left the
campus in July, 1938, and traveling
by way of the Orient and the Suez j
Canal he arrived in France. There I
he spent three weeks of anxiety pre- J
ceding Munich and the Czechoslo- j
vakian dismemberment.
In this period of crisis Professor |
Savelle made many acquaintances
and collected numerous anecdotes.
Upon his return to the campus he
said of the current war, "There was
no real desire for war, but the
French now feel as they have all
alongâ€”that Germany has forced
them."
