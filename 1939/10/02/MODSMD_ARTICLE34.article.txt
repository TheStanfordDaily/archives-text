# Jinxed Indians Stopped by Beavers
## Hopes High Despite 12-0 Card Defeat Loss of Gallarneau And Willard Hampers Starting Line-up 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Last year's jinx descended on the
stadium gridiron again Saturday to
help make the 12-0 Oregon State
football victory a rather dismal af
fair, but several individual per
formances brightened the outlook
for the future.
Going into the game without the
services of Hugh Gallarneau and
Bill Willard, the Indians were
plagued by penalties at crucial mo
ments. Gallarneau was in the hospi
tal with an infected blister on his

foot and Willard tore a lateral liga
ment in his knee while warming up
before the game.
Bad breaks cannot, however, be
entirely blamed for the defeat, as
the Card offense was ragged and the
pass defense practically non-exist
ent most of the game. A great deal
of credit should also go to Lon
Stiner's well coached, smooth run
ning Oregon State Beavers.
The Orangemen had a more ex
perienced squad and several better
than average ball players, including
a center trio as good as any in the
country, Leonard Younce and
Eberle Schultz are a pair of big,
capable guards, and John Tsoutsou
vas, is a steady, dependable center
whose play was a high-light of the
game.
Bob Olson and Jim Kisselburgh
carried most of the offensive load for
the Beavers, and carried it much tcy.)
well to suit Farm rooters.
GROVES STANDOUT
Jim Verdick, transfer from San
Bernardino Junior College, turned
in a very creditable job at center
in his first game under Tiny Thorn
hill. With Sophomore Colin McClin
tock to spell him, Verdick constitutes
a strong bulwark of the line.
Jim Groves was the backfield
standout, breaking loose for good
gains on weak-side reverses. Groves
made the longest run of the game
when he sprinted up the sidelines
with the second half kick-off for 53
yards.
Norm Standlee surprised with his
kicking, getting off several towering
punts that brought back memories
of Bill Paulman. "The Chief" was
unable to make substantial gains
through center because of the tough
Oregon State line.
SOPHS SHOW PROMISE
Several sophomores showed a lot
of promise in spite of their inexpe
rience. Johnny Sturgeon made a
good impression at right half when
he relieved Groves. Despite his lack
of weight. Sturgeon is an efficient
blocker and a powerful running
back.
Pete Kmetovic, the San Jose speed
burner, received a big hand when he
left the game. Pete worked in well
with the first-string backfield in spite
of a couple of bobbled punts.
ENDS STRONG
Fred Meyer had a lot to live-up
to when he replaced Acting Captain
Andy Stojkovich, who played a
great game, but his work showed
that he had what it takes to become
a fine end.
Bill Greer, another inexperienced
player, moved up from third string
end when Willard was hurt, to see
;i lot of action.
With the conference turned upside
down by Saturday's upsets, Tiny
Thornhill's squad needn't feel too
discouraged by their loss. An upset
against Oregon at Portland next
week-end would give the Indian
warriors the inside lane in the race
for the Rose Bowl bid.

down by Saturday's upsets, Tiny
Thornhill's squad needn't feel too
discouraged by their loss. An upset
against Oregon at Portland next
week-end would give the Indian
warriors the inside lane in the race
for the Rose Bowl bid.
Last year's jinx descended on the
stadium gridiron again Saturday to
help make the 12-0 Oregon State
football victory a rather dismal af
fair, but several individual per
formances brightened the outlook
for the future.
Going into the game without the
services of Hugh Gallarneau and
Bill Willard, the Indians were
plagued by penalties at crucial mo
ments. Gallarneau was in the hospi
tal with an infected blister on his

foot and Willard tore a lateral liga
ment in his knee while warming up
before the game.
Bad breaks cannot, however, be
entirely blamed for the defeat, as
the Card offense was ragged and the
pass defense practically non-exist
ent most of the game. A great deal
of credit should also go to Lon
Stiner's well coached, smooth run
ning Oregon State Beavers.
The Orangemen had a more ex
perienced squad and several better
than average ball players, including
a center trio as good as any in the
country, Leonard Younce and
Eberle Schultz are a pair of big,
capable guards, and John Tsoutsou
vas, is a steady, dependable center
whose play was a high-light of the
game.
Bob Olson and Jim Kisselburgh
carried most of the offensive load for
the Beavers, and carried it much tcy.)
well to suit Farm rooters.
GROVES STANDOUT
Jim Verdick, transfer from San
Bernardino Junior College, turned
in a very creditable job at center
in his first game under Tiny Thorn
hill. With Sophomore Colin McClin
tock to spell him, Verdick constitutes
a strong bulwark of the line.
Jim Groves was the backfield
standout, breaking loose for good
gains on weak-side reverses. Groves
made the longest run of the game
when he sprinted up the sidelines
with the second half kick-off for 53
yards.
Norm Standlee surprised with his
kicking, getting off several towering
punts that brought back memories
of Bill Paulman. "The Chief" was
unable to make substantial gains
through center because of the tough
Oregon State line.
SOPHS SHOW PROMISE
Several sophomores showed a lot
of promise in spite of their inexpe
rience. Johnny Sturgeon made a
good impression at right half when
he relieved Groves. Despite his lack
of weight. Sturgeon is an efficient
blocker and a powerful running
back.
Pete Kmetovic, the San Jose speed
burner, received a big hand when he
left the game. Pete worked in well
with the first-string backfield in spite
of a couple of bobbled punts.
ENDS STRONG
Fred Meyer had a lot to live-up
to when he replaced Acting Captain
Andy Stojkovich, who played a
great game, but his work showed
that he had what it takes to become
a fine end.
Bill Greer, another inexperienced
player, moved up from third string
end when Willard was hurt, to see
;i lot of action.
With the conference turned upside
down by Saturday's upsets, Tiny
Thornhill's squad needn't feel too
discouraged by their loss. An upset
against Oregon at Portland next
week-end would give the Indian
