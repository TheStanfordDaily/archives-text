# Frosh Gridders Smash Modesto in Grid Opener
## 
### 
A rugged, hustling freshman football team that knows its business and
wastes little time trampled Modesto Junior College 19-0 last Saturday in
their initial game of the season.
Only sloppy ball handling robbed the yearlings from a score and kept
the two teams 011 an even par for the first quarter. In the second period.

however, the Papooses showed their
superiority over the Jaysee team and
hit pay dirt for 7 points.
FUMBLE SETS SCENE
It all started when A1 Cole fum
bled and fell on a Modesto punt on
the invaders' 42-yard line. Bob
Greening toured the weak side of
the line for nine yards. Cole made it
first down on the 32 and then tossed
to Greening for another first dnwn
on the 15. Cole and Red Taylor each
made 3 and Eric Armstrong clickcd
off 5 yards for another first down on
the 4. Greening and Cole each lost 1
and then the latter tossed a flat pass
to Armstrong for the payoff.
Armstrong again on the receiving
end tallied the second Card touch
down on a beautiful 40-yaid pass
from Milt Vucinich followed by a
20-yard ramble.
THIRD TALLY
The third touchdown followed a
62-yard drive dominated and di
rected by Don Selby, a second-string
halfback. Three times on drifters
off right tackle Selby flashed speed
and drive, accounting for 11 yards
each crack. However, it was Arm
strong again who actually packed
the mail over that last white line.

He swept left end for nine yards and
traveled over standing up.
The one black spot of the game
was the injury of first-string end
Hank Norburg. The big flankman
sustained a fractured cheek bone
and may be out for the season.
