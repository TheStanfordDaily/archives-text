# Good-bye, Mr. Chips

THE kid had the swell head. Thinking over
the ace performances he had been turning
in all week, the coach decided he had better
do something about it—for the good of the
team as well as of the kid.
"You big bum, you won't do better than 50
feet today," he drawled again and again in the
shot-putter's ear as the bus whizzed along on
the way to the meet. His words had their calcu
lated effect. The kid was lucky to put it 47 feet.
When he came out for practice the next
Monday, he seemed to have lost some of his
cockiness. It cost the coach a week of hard
work to build the boy up to the point where he
could repeat his first-place performances. It
was worth the trouble, the coach thought; he
had saved the kid and helped the team.
That was Dink's psychology.
For 18 years he coached track at Stanford,
and every season he turned out an outstanding
team. "The coach of champions," the sports
writers called him. Krenz, Barnes, Hables, Mil
ler, Eastman,' Klopstock, Dyer, Weiershauser,
Mallott, Mottram, and Jeffrey are only a few of
the cinderpath's immortals who took their les
sons from Dink.
But, he was something more to Stanford than
a successful track coach, something more vital
than a man responsible for a string of cham
pionships. His fierce devotion to the University
and his interest in the men it produced made
him an indispensable element on the Farm.
Four undergraduate years as a brilliant ath
lete and scholar, the early days as "the boy
coach," and finally he became a tradition. When
his final resignation was accepted last Friday
night, an important part of the Stanford spirit
was lost.
Dink's methods weren't gentle; he didn't
mollycoddle his boys. Sweating and straining
around the track late every afternoon, those
men were not working just for themselves, or
for Stanford.
They were running for Dink.
