### 
TODAY'S Campus Opinion letter amplifying
several obvious truths about war falls into a
common trap, proving, among other things,
that one additional question should have been
added to last week's Daily war poll.
Stating that 76 per cent of the people voting
in the poll showed that they would not volun
teer should this country go to war, yet that 69
per cent would go if drafted, Bob Livingston
writes: "If they (the volunteers) believe it their
patriotic duty to commit murder at the will of
the state, why don't they volunteer and show
their patriotism rather than their reluctance?"
People, at least university people in the year
1939, will not commit mass murder in war time
out of a sense of patriotic duty.
While flag-waving today is much more com
mon than it was five years ago, and we, the
people, are being told more and more often
what a damn good place this country is, we,
at least those of us at Stanford, have not been
regimented into patriotism. Not yet.
We are regimented in a great many ways,
and we will know without mistake what regi
mentation is when and if this country goes to
war, but the cynical aftermath of the World
War has kept us from becoming regimented
emotionally as far as the subject of war is con
cerned.
What those 69 per cent of the people here
at Stanford were doing when they indicated
they would submit to a draft was to show that
they would take a gambler's chance.
Should they refuse to go to war, it would
mean certain prison, and not such a prison as
the current criminal goes to, but probably much
worse; and it would mean life forevermore with
out a country and without a home, at the very
least.
But to go to war under draft would mean a
ten-to-one chance of escaping death or wounds
and returning home eventually to a normal life.
The Daily should have asked: "Would you
submit to draft because: (a) you believe it your
patriotic duty to do so; (b) you think it would

be to your own personal advantage?" The an
swer is obvious.
And dangerous—as dangerous as patriotism,
as far as keeping us out of war is concerned.
So it boils down to this: going to war now
is not a matter of mass patriotism; it is a matter
of personal courage or the lack of it. Propa
gandists, please copy.—D. J.

People, at least university people in the year
1939, will not commit mass murder in war time
out of a sense of patriotic duty.
While flag-waving today is much more com
mon than it was five years ago, and we, the
people, are being told more and more often
what a damn good place this country is, we,
at least those of us at Stanford, have not been
regimented into patriotism. Not yet.
We are regimented in a great many ways,
and we will know without mistake what regi
mentation is when and if this country goes to
war, but the cynical aftermath of the World
War has kept us from becoming regimented
emotionally as far as the subject of war is con
cerned.
What those 69 per cent of the people here
at Stanford were doing when they indicated
they would submit to a draft was to show that
they would take a gambler's chance.
Should they refuse to go to war, it would
mean certain prison, and not such a prison as
the current criminal goes to, but probably much
worse; and it would mean life forevermore with
out a country and without a home, at the very
least.
But to go to war under draft would mean a
ten-to-one chance of escaping death or wounds
and returning home eventually to a normal life.
The Daily should have asked: "Would you
submit to draft because: (a) you believe it your
patriotic duty to do so; (b) you think it would

be to your own personal advantage?" The an
swer is obvious.
And dangerous—as dangerous as patriotism,
as far as keeping us out of war is concerned.
So it boils down to this: going to war now
is not a matter of mass patriotism; it is a matter
of personal courage or the lack of it. Propa
gandists, please copy.—D. J.
TODAY'S Campus Opinion letter amplifying
several obvious truths about war falls into a
common trap, proving, among other things,
that one additional question should have been
added to last week's Daily war poll.
Stating that 76 per cent of the people voting
in the poll showed that they would not volun
teer should this country go to war, yet that 69
per cent would go if drafted, Bob Livingston
writes: "If they (the volunteers) believe it their
patriotic duty to commit murder at the will of
the state, why don't they volunteer and show
their patriotism rather than their reluctance?"
