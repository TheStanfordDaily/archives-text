GRUBBING lOR GLAMOUR

I WOULD not advise anyone to see '"These Glamour
Girls." A good satirical idea was butchered, as
usual, by Hollywood's overpaid circus trainers. But
there were, as there are in movies now and then, spots
of good caricature —glamour girls in all their pristine
monstrousness. The reason I advise against seeing the
picture even for those cartoons is that any Stanford
man and some Stanford women can see the same sort
of Woolworth aristocracy all over the Farm.

Stanfordites need no urging to condemn the ideol
ogies of war-mongers, gangsters, demagogues, and
horse-thieves. Now, the incarnations of affectation
around here, popularly mis-named "glamour girls,"
are not, it is true, horse-thieves. Perhaps that is the
best one can say for them. But their standards are
hardly more worthwhile, and their monotonously su
gared sameness is much more devastating to the na
tion's digestion than Al Capone and all the rest of our
twentieth century desperadoes. Those ever-gay, pre
tending-to-be-more-stupid than they are, Hollywood
imitating husband-hunters are grim but ever-present
reminders that America cannot forego stomach
powders.
No one particularly minds that they wander through
life wanting to do not one thing better than a grand
slam at bridge. Few condemn with particular bitter
ness the fact that ordinarily-delectable feminine pas
sions are devoted to mastering a stock of repartees in
which it is the object to say absolutely nothing, but
to say it energetically, knowingly, and suggestively.
In short, they are not the only fungus growths on
society, and hence do not stand out for marked con
demnation on that score. But the thing that rubs some
pelts against the grain is the plain fact that they are
so damned boring.

A/"ARIETY may not be the exclusive spice of life, but
* most of us feel it to be at least a contributing fac
tor. And the infinite solidarity of sameness presented
by the smilingly snobbish, who usually have empty
heads in which to echo their concertos of conceit, is
as deadening as the marriage of a boring lecture and
a society tea. They try to be glamorous, but they
really taste bad. And they aren't medicines at all—just
non-thrill social morphine.
There aren't really many of them at Stanford, I
guess. They just seem so plural because they are all
alike. What they have to live for it is hard to tell.
An honest Stanford women told me that the girls at a
sorority rush-party looked at the lining of her fur
coat to see how much it cost. Maybe that's what they
live for—fur coats. Personally, though, I think intel
lectual and emotional cadavers still look dead, even
with fur coats on.
Someone who is looking over my shoulder here says
I had better start getting connections at Mills—or some
where besides here. He's probably right. But most
glamour girls are so stupid that they won't even know
who I'm talking about. *
