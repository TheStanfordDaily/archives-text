TIIEY TOO WILL GO

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
I was naturally quite keenly interested in the
straw vote you polled last week asking opinion on three
questions concerning war.
Many of us constantly wonder just how strong our
national ideologies are and whether they can ever rep
resent the majority of average individual ideologies.
The United States, at least, tries to admit as much ex
pression of .opinion as possible to foster an approxima
tion of crystal-pure democracy. But we, too, are not
without our channels of information purposely de
signed to inculcate the "American way of life." These
channels, within any other national borders, would
truly be called subversive activities. I am not con
demning this, but trying to formulate a truth. . . .
The question that I find hardest to resolve in my
own mind is whether national patriotism can demand
of its citizens murder? Especially, I wonder, is mur
der justifiably legalized when the person they demand
that you kill is no more a real enemy of yours than
the German lad who lived next door or the Russian
boy at your elbow in class this morning? . .
We should hate the men who wrote our over
patriotic texts which so colored our eyes against see
ing who in our own country's history are the fathers
of American international injustices. We .should hate
the press which won't honestly appraise the news. And
we should call our friend and the best lover of civiliza
tion that man who dares to stand above the heads of
his countrymen and declare a truth.

about Thursday's poll, Mr. Editor,
k the answers to the first question (arms embargo) is
quite out of our hands. Moreover, opinion on that
score was so evenly divided that Stanford would have
a worse job of deciding than Congress, worse both from
the standpoint of effort and futility. Whether we would
be willing to fight in event of the two stipulations men
tioned in the poll (allies in danger of defeat or U.S.
territory invaded) . . . that, too, is rather out of our
hands for we won't be asked our willingness, and
moreover, neither stipulation could in any sense be
accurately defined. But the last question is the most
pertinent. "Would you volunteer?" Seventy-six per
cent would not. . . . Yet most of those would go if
drafted. Therein they show their weakness. The draft
will come shortly after the call for volunteers. If they
believe it their patriotic duty to commit murder at
the will of their state, why don't they volunteer and
show their patriotism rather than their reluctance. . . .
"Would you refuse to go, even at the risk of im
prisonment?" The man who refuses to go carries not
the strain of battle, but the greater strain of a man
without a country. After the war i.s over he will find
rehabilitation about as easy as a returning criminal.
He i.s the man who is too proud of his own honesty to
go to war and fire the gun into the air. But he. too,
will probably go to war.
