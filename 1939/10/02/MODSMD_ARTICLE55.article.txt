# Disaster Dwarfs Actors In Zanuck's 'Rains Came'
## 
### 
"THE RAINS CAME," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Disaster has hit Hollywood again. This time it's 21 combined earth
quake, flood, fire and plague—not to mention love—called "The Rains
Came."
Hollywood manages to turn the flicker version of Louis Bromlield's

best-seller into a turbulent, arrest
ing picture. And, though the story
centers about disaster, it is not
dwarfed by it.
The principal objection to the pic
ture is its scope. The necessity of
crowding details of action and plot
into the thin reel of celluloid that
tosses images on the screen for 105
short minutes restricts free character
development.
DIFFICULT DELINEATION
It's difficult to explain, emotion
ally, each character while you're
painting a broad, action-filled pic
ture of India with its torrential rains.
Consequently, these characters seem
convincing only in relation to the
events which transpire; and they're
not always too convincing.
George Brent deserves first acting
honors. As the slightly worn remit
tance man, his performance was su
perbly handled. Myrna Loy had a
more difficult job, perhaps because
she was miscast as the hard, selfish,
libidinous siren. After seeing her
as the perfect wife for all these
years, it's hard to imagine her as a
villainess. Her portrayal was not
bad, but someone along the Marlene
Dietrich line would have been bet
ter.
TYRONE IN TURBAN
Tyrone Power is back in costume
again; this time it's principally a
turban. Alter he discards the head
gear, he relaxes a little but is never
inspiring. Unless you like Tyrone
Power.
The much - publicized Brenda
Joyce earns all the advance praise

r
that has been shunted her way. As
the missionary's daughter, She gives
a natural, relaxed, and thoroughly
real performance.
But George Brent is the star; he
takes every scene, hands down.
Maybe the producers will give him 1
a chance, now, to do something be
sides stooge for Bette Davis.—Hovey. i

centers about disaster, it is not
dwarfed by it.
The principal objection to the pic
ture is its scope. The necessity of
crowding details of action and plot
into the thin reel of celluloid that
tosses images on the screen for 105
short minutes restricts free character
development.
DIFFICULT DELINEATION
It's difficult to explain, emotion
ally, each character while you're
painting a broad, action-filled pic
ture of India with its torrential rains.
Consequently, these characters seem
convincing only in relation to the
events which transpire; and they're
not always too convincing.
George Brent deserves first acting
honors. As the slightly worn remit
tance man, his performance was su
perbly handled. Myrna Loy had a
more difficult job, perhaps because
she was miscast as the hard, selfish,
libidinous siren. After seeing her
as the perfect wife for all these
years, it's hard to imagine her as a
villainess. Her portrayal was not
bad, but someone along the Marlene
Dietrich line would have been bet
ter.
TYRONE IN TURBAN
Tyrone Power is back in costume
again; this time it's principally a
turban. Alter he discards the head
gear, he relaxes a little but is never
inspiring. Unless you like Tyrone
Power.
The much - publicized Brenda
Joyce earns all the advance praise

r
that has been shunted her way. As
the missionary's daughter, She gives
a natural, relaxed, and thoroughly
real performance.
But George Brent is the star; he
takes every scene, hands down.
Maybe the producers will give him 1
a chance, now, to do something be
sides stooge for Bette Davis.—Hovey. i
