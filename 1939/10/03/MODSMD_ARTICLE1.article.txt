TPHE war gods of Europe were leaf
ing back the pages of history
yesterday with alarming rapidity.
They stopped at a date nearly a
hundred years ago when Great
Britain and France went into bit
ter warfare against Russia in the
Crimea, not so much in defense of
Turkey and the Ottoman Empire as
to prevent Russia from seizing the
Dardanelles.
In a great many details the sit
uation is much the same today,
for Russia was reported to he at
tempting to "neutralize" and per
haps usurp partial control of the
fortified straits in a diplomatic
stroke which, if successful, might
he even graver for the Allies than
Josef Stalin's new accord with
Adolf Hitler.
* * #
British and French hopes of a mu
tual assistance pact with Turkey
were tottering, for Soviet control of
the gateway to the Black Sea would
make completely ineffective any
such agreement. With the Russian
l>ear dominating the Dardanelles as
an enemy of the Allies, Britain's
vital life-line of empire to her near
eastern possessions and her Mediter
ranean route would be severed. The
threat to British sea power is huge.
* * *
r r , URKEY, whose foreign minister
is dickering with Molotov in
Moscow, is apparently seeking a
means to straddle the diplomatic
fence. Turkey would hate to an
tagonize Britain and France, while
she certainly would like to retain
friendly relations with Russia.
Russia's swift, incisive move
ments to consolidate the buffer
states along the Baltic, in addition
to scaling a Turkish alliance, con
tinued with what must have been
pleasing regularity to Molotov.
News from Riga, Latvia, said the
president of Estonia had ratified
the new pact with the Soviets by
special decree after an emergency
meeting of both houses of Par
liament.
It was rumored, too, in Berlin,
that the Russians had offered Lith
uania a "friendly agreement" in
stead of a mutual assistance pact
such as that concluded with Estonia.
Just what a Russian "friendly agree
ment" means is difficult to imagine,
though it's safe to predict it's no
gold-plated Christmas present.
* *
jpUROPEAN "flyers" were still
carrying foreigners to Moscow
last night. Presumably as part of
the recent Russo-German trade tie
up, 200 German armament technic
ians arrived at the Soviet capital.
They'll proceed to the industi-ial
areas as technical advisers, especial
ly in the iron, metallurgical and
electrical industries. This would
definitely indicate that the Berlin-
Russian agreement is more in earn
est than Winston Churchill or
Chamberlain dare to admit.
The Nazi press, in the same
vein, indicated strongly yesterday
that the Soviets and Italy may en
ler the war on Germany's side if
the Allies reject Fuehrer Hitler's
"filial" peace offer, which may be
placed before them officially with
in 48 hours by Premier Mussolini.
* * *
It's almost a sure bet that the Al
lies will reject the proposal. Hitler,
equipped only for a comparatively
swift war, obviously fears a long
conflict in which French and British
access to supplies and potential
power will tell the tale.
Italian foreign minister, smooth
Galeazzo Ciano, after a 19-hour par
ley in Berlin at the Fuehrer's bid
ding, left unexpectedly for Rome at
noon yesterday, supposedly bearing
the final proposal that Benito will
serve England and France.
If Mussolini's intervention fails —
and the cards seem already stacked
—Hitler probably will go before the
Reichstag Friday or Saturday and
deliver a "peace ultimatum." It will
be guttural and vehement, but it
may add little except further com
plication to the already insane Eu
ropean "hurrah's nest."

that the Russians had offered Lith

jpUROPEAN "flyers" were still
carrying foreigners to Moscow
last night. Presumably as part of
the recent Russo-German trade tie
up, 200 German armament technic

They'll proceed to the industi-ial
areas as technical advisers, especial

electrical industries. This would
definitely indicate that the Berlin-
Russian agreement is more in earn

The Nazi press, in the same
vein, indicated strongly yesterday
that the Soviets and Italy may en

the Allies reject Fuehrer Hitler's
"filial" peace offer, which may be
placed before them officially with
in 48 hours by Premier Mussolini.

It's almost a sure bet that the Al
lies will reject the proposal. Hitler,
equipped only for a comparatively
swift war, obviously fears a long
conflict in which French and British
access to supplies and potential
power will tell the tale.
Italian foreign minister, smooth
Galeazzo Ciano, after a 19-hour par

noon yesterday, supposedly bearing
the final proposal that Benito will

If Mussolini's intervention fails —
and the cards seem already stacked
—Hitler probably will go before the
Reichstag Friday or Saturday and
deliver a "peace ultimatum." It will
be guttural and vehement, but it
may add little except further com
plication to the already insane Eu
ropean "hurrah's nest."

In a great many details the sit
