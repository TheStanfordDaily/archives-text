The question of a Union Cellar
record player is due to come up
for discussion. It has not yet been
returned to its place in the Cellar
because of numerous complaints as
to noise, choice of records, and the
fact that coke patrons crowded out
lunch-eaters as they sat on the
counter stools listening to the ma
chine.
Major argument in favor of the
phonograph appears to be that it has
furnished the only steady source of
income to pay off the boathouse
debt.
