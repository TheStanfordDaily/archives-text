# Guggeheim Laboratory Aids Science, Stanford Since '17
## Research on Propellers Is Subject Of Current Airplane Experiments

This is the first of a series of feature articles dealing with little-known,

Stanford's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, housed in its com
paratively insignificant stucco building "somewhere behind the chapel,"
has, since 1917. proven itself an outstanding center of Pacific Coast aero
nautical experimentation and research.
Importance of the laboratory sprang into the public consciousness early
last summer with the arrival on campus of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh

•who was making, according to in
structing potentates, an interested
and informal inspection of the plant
and its inner workings.
However, in 01* out of the public
eye, such aerodynamic and aero
structural experimentation has been
going on at Stanford as far back as
1917 and '18 when Dr. W. F. Durand
and Professor E. P. Lesley, now re
tired, began their first propeller ex
perimentation for the National Ad
visory Committee for Aeronautics.
Continuing Dr. Durand's research,
Professor Leslie, working in the
Guggenheim laboratory, has just
completed some propeller research
for the same N.A.C.A., the body
which soon is to construct an expan
sive aeronautical laboratory at Sun
nyvale, the twin of the research
laboratory at Langley Field in Vir
ginia.
When questioned concerning the
probable future affiliation between
the Sunnyvale laboratory and the
Guggenheim laboratory, Professor
Elliott G. Reid, professor of Aero
dynamics, stated, "I would be sur
prised if we did not continue some
contract research for the N.A.C.A.
since we have been doing such work
since 1917.
Professor Reid's experimentation
centers about the laboratory's wind
tunnel, which is called a venturi
tube, having its smallest diameter at
the center. Out of the seven-and-a
half-foot mouth of this tunnel blows
a 100-mile-per-hour wind stream
which is created by an eight-bladed
fan.
As to the future, Professor Reid
plans to begin, in the near future, a
series of experimental tests on wing
flutter. This phenomenon in aero
structures is comparable to automo
bile front-wheel shimmy, except that
when things begin to shimmy in the
air they usually shake off. Tlie.se
flutter tests will be made on a model
wing measuring about three feet
long which will be placed and
watched in the tunnel's wind stream.
Guggenheim research, however,
does not center in the aero-dynamic
field, but is equally interested and
eqqually active in experimentation
with aero-structures. Most recent of
such structural experimentation, ac
cording to Professor Alfred S. Niles,
professor of Aeronautic Engineering,
has been the study of stiffened pan
els and metal columns which arc
called "channels." Other future ex
periments in this field which has not
as yet been thoroughly studied, will
be carried on to a possible conclusion
by a Stanford student as part of his
thesis work. In the same field, an
other structural student will soon
begin a series of tests with these
same channels after they have been
perforated, and thereby lightened, by
holes.
Summarizing the structural work
done by the Guggenheim Labora
tory, Professor Niles stated that the
primary structural aim was to ob
tain the maximum of strength with
the minimum of weight and, some
times, resistance.

since we have been doing such work
since 1917.
Professor Reid's experimentation
centers about the laboratory's wind
tunnel, which is called a venturi
tube, having its smallest diameter at
the center. Out of the seven-and-a
half-foot mouth of this tunnel blows
a 100-mile-per-hour wind stream
which is created by an eight-bladed
fan.
As to the future, Professor Reid
plans to begin, in the near future, a
series of experimental tests on wing
flutter. This phenomenon in aero
structures is comparable to automo
bile front-wheel shimmy, except that
when things begin to shimmy in the
air they usually shake off. Tlie.se
flutter tests will be made on a model
wing measuring about three feet
long which will be placed and
watched in the tunnel's wind stream.
Guggenheim research, however,
does not center in the aero-dynamic
field, but is equally interested and
eqqually active in experimentation
with aero-structures. Most recent of
such structural experimentation, ac
cording to Professor Alfred S. Niles,
professor of Aeronautic Engineering,
has been the study of stiffened pan
els and metal columns which arc
called "channels." Other future ex
periments in this field which has not
as yet been thoroughly studied, will
be carried on to a possible conclusion
by a Stanford student as part of his
thesis work. In the same field, an
other structural student will soon
begin a series of tests with these
same channels after they have been
perforated, and thereby lightened, by
holes.
Summarizing the structural work
done by the Guggenheim Labora
tory, Professor Niles stated that the
primary structural aim was to ob
tain the maximum of strength with
the minimum of weight and, some
times, resistance.

Stanford's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, housed in its com
paratively insignificant stucco building "somewhere behind the chapel,"
has, since 1917. proven itself an outstanding center of Pacific Coast aero
nautical experimentation and research.
Importance of the laboratory sprang into the public consciousness early
last summer with the arrival on campus of Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh

•who was making, according to in
structing potentates, an interested
and informal inspection of the plant
and its inner workings.
However, in 01* out of the public
eye, such aerodynamic and aero
structural experimentation has been
going on at Stanford as far back as
1917 and '18 when Dr. W. F. Durand
and Professor E. P. Lesley, now re
tired, began their first propeller ex
perimentation for the National Ad
visory Committee for Aeronautics.
Continuing Dr. Durand's research,
Professor Leslie, working in the
Guggenheim laboratory, has just
completed some propeller research
for the same N.A.C.A., the body
which soon is to construct an expan
sive aeronautical laboratory at Sun
nyvale, the twin of the research
laboratory at Langley Field in Vir
ginia.
When questioned concerning the
probable future affiliation between
the Sunnyvale laboratory and the
Guggenheim laboratory, Professor
Elliott G. Reid, professor of Aero
dynamics, stated, "I would be sur
prised if we did not continue some
contract research for the N.A.C.A.
