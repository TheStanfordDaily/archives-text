ber he questioned Frenchmen he
met and learned much of their feel
ing toward war and the crisis.

istry of foreign affairs gathering data

American diplomatic history.
Applying his comment to World
War II he said. "This time, if there
is a dictated peace, the French are
determined it will be a peace Ger
many won't ever be able to break
again. In other words, another Ver
sailles, only much worse.
"And that is just the reason why
the United States should stay out
of war and not be the party to still
another peace that will only sow
the seeds of future wars to come.
It's the same old struggle for bal
ance of power."
