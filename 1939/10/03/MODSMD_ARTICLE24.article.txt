# Russians Eye Dardanelles In Menace to Britain's Mediterranean Holdings
## Report of Steamship Sunk Off Brazilian Coast Relieved by Briton To Be Work of Secret Nazi Raider 
### United Press 
Russia was reported in Moscow dispatches early today to be attempting
to "neutralize" and perhaps obtain partial control of the fortified Darda
nelles in a diplomatic stroke which, if successful, might he graver for the
Allies than Josef Stalin's new agreement with Adolf Hitler.

OBSERVERS SKEPTICAL
Neutral observers doubted that

promised any military aid to Hitler
j and the Allies contended that the
Nazi press was trying to "scare"
them into accepting Hitler's peace
terms—already rejected in advance.
Kalian Foreign Minister Galeazzo
Ciano was en route back to Rome
after a 19-hour visit in Berlin dur
ing which Hitler's peace offensive
plans were outlined to him.
Of more immediate concern to the
neutral Americas, however, was the*
sinking in the South Atlantic, 70
miles of! the Brazilian coast, of the
British steamship Clement while
she was en route from New York to
Rio de Janeiro. Sixteen survivors of
the Clement's crew, landed at the
Brazilian port of Maceio, were un
able to agree as to whether the
5050-ton steamer was sunk by a Ger
man submarine or a Nazi cruiser.
BRITISH FEAR RAIDER
Britain feared that one of Ger
many's three 10,000-ton pocket bat
tleships had slipped by the British
blockade to prey on Allied shipping.
The sinking of the steamer spur
red the Inter-American Conference
meeting in Panama City to approve
immediately and unanimously a
project for the establishing of a wide
safety belt protected by warships
around the American republics to
insulate them from the European
war by barring any belligerent acts
inside the belt which in some places
extends as far as 600 miles at sea.
SENATE ATTACKS ACT
In Washington, the struggle over
President Roosevelt's proposal to
modify the American neutrality act
with a provision for cash-and-carry
sales of arms and munitions to bel
ligerents was launched vigorously
on the floor of the Senate.
Sen. William E. Borah, R., Ida.,
veteran leader of the isolationists,
charged that the President's pro
posal was sponsored by the "war
hounds of Europe" and is backed by
profit-seeking American munitions
manufacturers. If the arms embargo
is repealed, Borah said, the Europ
ean war will be brought "to our
midst."
U. S. Secretary of State Cofdell
Hull, follwoing the policy taken by
the United States after Germany
swallowed up Czechoslovakia, an
nounced that this country refuses to
recognize the joint Nazi-Soviet con
quest of Poland and that "mere
seizure of territory does not ex
tinguish the legal existence of a gov
ernment."
