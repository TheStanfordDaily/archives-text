# Thornhill Starts Grooming Indian Grid Aggregation For Oregon Journey
## Willard, Gallarneau, Groves Absent From Card Practice Line-up; Team Sees O.S.C. Game Pictures 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
With Bill Witlard, 1111iv11 Gallarneau and Jim Groves, missing. Tiny
Thornhill started drilling his Indian grid machine yesterday tor next Sat
urday's game against Tex Oliver's Oregon Webfeet in Portland.
Bill Witlard, the hoy who was "shot before the battle" last Saturday in
the stadium, was limping around the parcticc field with a metal brace on

his left knee. The final verdict
n't come in yet, but it now looks as
though it will be at least two weeks
before the big end will be able to
work out. It's possible that Willard
won't be able to play at all this
season.
lIAS CRACKED RIBS
Jim Groves played the last part of |
the Oregon State game with a couple :
of cracked ribs, and wasn't in shape i
to practice. Whether he will be j
back at his right half spot against j
Oregon depends on how the injury J
responds to treatment. He should be
;ible to play, but no one knows how
long.
Hugh Gallarneau was still running
a fever yesterday in the hospital, j
and, although he may be able to
make the trip with the squad, he
will probably be too weak from the |
hospital stretch to turn in his best '
game. * j
STURGEON PLAYS
Johnny St urgeon, 1(55 - pound i
sophomore back who played a lot of
good football while spelling Groves
against Oregon State, was on the
first team as Thornhill sent the
squad through dummy scrimmage
yesterday. With Gallarneau and
Groves question marks, Sturgeon
has moved up from the third string
to work with Norm Standlee, Gene
Coldiron, and Frankie Albert.
The rest of the team that started |
against the Beaver's was intact, j
Andy Stojkovich and Stan Graff
held down the wing posts. Stan An- i
dersen was at one tackle, while
Swede Johansen was at the other.
Johansen and Bill Trout divided
time in the opener, and the regular
assignment still seems to be a toss
up affair.
FILL GUARD POSTS
Corky Donahue and Hamp Pool
worked in the guard spots. Pool has
fully recovered from a blow on the
head which knocked him out in the j
last minute of play Saturday. Jim i
Verdiek was at center.
Yesterday's drill was spent try
ing to iron out some of the rough
spots that were noticed Saturday. A
scrimmage is scheduled for either
Tuesday or Wednesday.
Tiny, realizing that the Oregon
game would be a tough one, scrim
maged most of the squad until al
most 7 o'clock in yesterday's work
out. Main feature of the contact
work was that the team's spirit was
still good, and the Oregon State
game seemed to have no ill effects.
Moving pictures of the Oregon
State game were shown to the team
last night to demonstrate just where
and why the Big Red Machine
stalled.
TO LEAVE FOR NORTH
The Cards will entrain Thursday j
afternoon for Portland, where they i
will meet the Oregon team that out- j
played the mighty Thundering Herd ,
of Southern California and shat- j
tered tradition by leaving Los An- j
geles a 7-7 tie.
Tex Oliver's eleven features the j
jaekrabbit open-field running of |
Jay Graybeal and the line smashing 1
of Walt Emmons.

to work with Norm Standlee, Gene
Coldiron, and Frankie Albert.
The rest of the team that started |
against the Beaver's was intact, j
Andy Stojkovich and Stan Graff
held down the wing posts. Stan An- i
dersen was at one tackle, while
Swede Johansen was at the other.
Johansen and Bill Trout divided
time in the opener, and the regular
assignment still seems to be a toss
up affair.
FILL GUARD POSTS
Corky Donahue and Hamp Pool
worked in the guard spots. Pool has
fully recovered from a blow on the
head which knocked him out in the j
last minute of play Saturday. Jim i
Verdiek was at center.
Yesterday's drill was spent try
ing to iron out some of the rough
spots that were noticed Saturday. A
scrimmage is scheduled for either
Tuesday or Wednesday.
Tiny, realizing that the Oregon
game would be a tough one, scrim
maged most of the squad until al
most 7 o'clock in yesterday's work
out. Main feature of the contact
work was that the team's spirit was
still good, and the Oregon State
game seemed to have no ill effects.
Moving pictures of the Oregon
State game were shown to the team
last night to demonstrate just where
and why the Big Red Machine
stalled.
TO LEAVE FOR NORTH
The Cards will entrain Thursday j
afternoon for Portland, where they i
will meet the Oregon team that out- j
played the mighty Thundering Herd ,
of Southern California and shat- j
tered tradition by leaving Los An- j
geles a 7-7 tie.

Thornhill started drilling his Indian grid machine yesterday tor next Sat
urday's game against Tex Oliver's Oregon Webfeet in Portland.
Bill Witlard, the hoy who was "shot before the battle" last Saturday in
the stadium, was limping around the parcticc field with a metal brace on

his left knee. The final verdict
n't come in yet, but it now looks as
though it will be at least two weeks
before the big end will be able to
work out. It's possible that Willard
won't be able to play at all this
season.
lIAS CRACKED RIBS
Jim Groves played the last part of |
the Oregon State game with a couple :
of cracked ribs, and wasn't in shape i
to practice. Whether he will be j
back at his right half spot against j
Oregon depends on how the injury J
responds to treatment. He should be
;ible to play, but no one knows how
long.
Hugh Gallarneau was still running
a fever yesterday in the hospital, j
and, although he may be able to
make the trip with the squad, he
will probably be too weak from the |
hospital stretch to turn in his best '
game. * j
