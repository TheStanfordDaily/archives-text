There may be some fun in the
Coast Conference yet, it appears after
last week-end's games. The mighty
Trojan of U.S.C. suffered some em- j
barrassment from unexpected quar- j
ters when the Webfeet of Oregon ;
failed to get web-footed and forced j
Howard Jones' aggregation to come J
from behind for a tie.
California, picked by most experts
to finish second in the conference,
went out of its class a couple of
notches to take a trimming from
College of the Pacific. That game
between Amos Alonzo Stagg's Pa
cific's and San Jose State on Friday
night, Oct. 20, should be well worth
seeing.
Washington, supposed to have a |
dark-horse team, was slaughtered
by Pittsburgh.
% I
Yessir. maybe the Cards aren t I
out of this tiling yet. Despite the
score of last Saturday's debacle in
the local arena, there is still plenty i
of life in the old Indian. The Cards j
offense looked pretty potent at j
times, especially on those reverses j
to Jim Groves and Johnny Stur- !
geon off the Stanford left tackle.
The passing attack, it is true, was |
at its worst possible pitch, but un- !
less I miss my guess Stanford is still j
going to be a threat through the
airlanes before long. The practice
sessions that Frankie Albert missed
while he was in the hospital cost
him his keen edge in the passing de
partment, but with his natural abil
ity and confident attitude, one bad
day is just going to delay his blos
soming into stardom, not prevent it.
And Stanford won't meet many
teams that are as strong in the
middle of the tine as the Beavers
proved to be. Younce, Schuttz,
and Tsoutsouvas are two guards j
and a tenter who can hold their
own with any team in the country. |
Another favorable result, of the
game was the Indians' punting. ;
Stanford's average was over 42
yards per boot, which is better i
than just good in any league, and ;
especially, so . considering . that j
kicking was expected to be one of I
the weak departments.
Yep, we aren't discouraged yet. '
Stanford looked 100 per cent better !
than it did for the opener against I
Santa Clara last year, and look how
the Indians finished up 1938.

There may be some fun in the

California, picked by most experts
to finish second in the conference,
went out of its class a couple of

Yessir. maybe the Cards aren t I
out of this tiling yet. Despite the
score of last Saturday's debacle in
the local arena, there is still plenty i
of life in the old Indian. The Cards j
offense looked pretty potent at j
times, especially on those reverses j
to Jim Groves and Johnny Stur- !
geon off the Stanford left tackle.
The passing attack, it is true, was |
at its worst possible pitch, but un- !
less I miss my guess Stanford is still j
going to be a threat through the
airlanes before long. The practice
sessions that Frankie Albert missed
while he was in the hospital cost
him his keen edge in the passing de
partment, but with his natural abil
ity and confident attitude, one bad
day is just going to delay his blos
soming into stardom, not prevent it.
And Stanford won't meet many
teams that are as strong in the
middle of the tine as the Beavers
proved to be. Younce, Schuttz,
and Tsoutsouvas are two guards j
and a tenter who can hold their
own with any team in the country. |
Another favorable result, of the
game was the Indians' punting. ;
Stanford's average was over 42
yards per boot, which is better i
than just good in any league, and ;
especially, so . considering . that j
kicking was expected to be one of I
the weak departments.
Yep, we aren't discouraged yet. '
Stanford looked 100 per cent better !
than it did for the opener against I
Santa Clara last year, and look how
the Indians finished up 1938.
