# Bill Hamilton Voted 1939 Stanton! Soccer Captain
## 
### 
Bill Hamilton, stellar veteran on Coach Barry Maloney's soccer club,
yesterday afternoon was named by his team-mates to captain the squad
during the 1939 season which opens Wednesday, Oct. 11.
Hamilton, a husky backfield man of two years' varsity experience,
edged out Team-mate Bill Edwards in a balloting duel prior to yester-

day's practice session.
The Indian soccermen, with the
most promising outfit in years to
work under Coach Maloney, meet
Menlo Jaysee in the initial confer
ence game on the Stanford soccer
field, clashing with California in two
games which may decide the league
title, Nov. 18 and 25.
Other games will find the team
playing San Mateo Jaysee, San
Francisco Jaysee and University, and
San Jose State College in two games
apiece.
swung around to Pool and snarled,
"Hamp, you're yellow!"
So, shoulder to shoulder, and with
set, determined faces, they made
their way back to Dr. Wilbur's of
fice, gained admittance, and invited
him to watch the game from the
bench. Oregon State should have
been easy after that.
And of course, the story is
pretty well known by now, that
some freshman guard tried to
make Dr. Wilbur show his identi
fication before being admitted to
the stadium. At the freshman re
ception that night. Dr. Wilbur
stopped (i> joke with the embar
rassed frosh, whose face was a
flaming red.
Incidentally, Stanford's president
delivered a little talk to the grid
ders before they went out on the
field, the substance of it being that
he didn't care whether they won or
lost as long as they played the game.
