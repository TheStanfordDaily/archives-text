# Card Frosh End Breaks Bone
## Shipkey Says Frosh Offense Slow, Ragged 
### 
A promising freshman football ca
reer was not necessarily ended but
was definitely postponed for three
weeks when Hank Norberg, hefty
Papoose end, fractured his cheek
bone in the first quarter of last Sat
urday's 19-0 victory over Modesto.
Coach Harry Shipkey was, in fact
still is, expecting big things of Nor
burg but will have to wait three
weeks until the painful injury is
healed.
OFFENSE CALLED SLOW
In commenting on the yearlings'
convincing opener, Shipkey said that
the running of plays was ragged and
that the interference runners were
too slow and a little sloppy. How
ever, he gave the line, McCain, Ban
ducci, Palmer, and Robinson in par
ticular, plenty of praise for their
defensive play.
This week in preparation for
Placer Junior College the frosh will
pay lots of attention to offensive
charge, blocking, and to pass offense.
Placer is more or less an unknown
quantity, tying their only game with
Marin Junior College, 6-6.
BACK FIELD PLEASES COACII
In discussing the backfield Shipkey
was pleased with the performance of
Cole, Vucinich, and Selby. The
frosh mentor is planning to work on
Cole's and Selby's passing in an ef
fort to get 3 triple-threat men for
use at any time. He predicts that all
three of these boys will improve
greatly. â€¢
Yesterday the squad worked out
their stiffness and soreness with
light signal practice. But today they
go to work in earnest with an in
tensive pass scrimmage.
