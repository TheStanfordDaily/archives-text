# Thornton Seeks Forward Line For Waterdogs
## Indians to Meet Spartans Thursday In First Home Tilt 
### 
Bill Bleeker and Dave Nottage,
I Stanford water polo players, were
j deemed "very promising" yesterday
by Coach Nort Thornton as he con
| tinued his hunt for a winning for
| ward combination.
Bleeker and Nottage are trading
! shots with Scott Dudley, outstand
ing sophomore, Dick Clarke and
Bob Jamieson in a race for the two
, forward positions as the opening
! contest of the season with San Jo.se
| State scheduled Thursday.
The Spartans, claiming to have
j advanced another step in their quest
j for a spot in big-time water polo,
' will meet the Indian outfit in Encina
j Pool at 4:30 o'clock, with the doors
J being swung wide to whomever may
I want to watch "the toughest sport."
San Jose was originally scheduled
; as a "breather" by Coach Thornton,
j who didn't expect to have his boys
in top shape after only six or seven
days of practice. Originally. Thorn
j ton planned to use two full squads
! in the aqua skirmish, but advance
i dope now points, in the opposite di
j rection.
The team seems complete as a
| unit, but is weak at. the forward
i spots, and Mentor Nort is desperate
| in his search for an offensive syark.
! It may be that Bleaker and Nottage
j will do the trick.
I Stress has been placed on shoot
j ing drills during recent practices.
! Early last week Thornton said that
j while the offense seemed weak, it
[ was due to the lack of caliber in the
shooting, not inability to control the
ball.
The freshman poloists are under
; the guiding hand of Harvey Roths
child, all-Coast Stanford player last
; season. Rothschild will shoot his
men against Palo Alto High October
11 in their initial bill. Despite two
i scrimmages, Rothschild has not yet
put his hand upon a definite first
string combination.
