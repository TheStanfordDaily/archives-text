# Card Fencers See Good Season Ahead
## 
### 
Coach Elwyn Bugge, with five
veterans and seven promising
sophomores returning, is looking
forward to a good fencing season
when the Farm foil brigade swings
into action winter quarter.
Practice will be held all this quar
ter, with a few informal meets slat
ed against Bay Area competition.
The Card swordsmen will probably
not compete in the Heron Trophy
matches, which come early in the
season, if present plans are carried
out. Coach Bugge sent out a call for
anyone interested in going out for
frosh fencing, as several positions
are open on the Papoose squad.
CORVALLIS. Ore., Oct. 2 (UP).—
Lon Stiner gave his Oregon State
Beavers —conquerors of Stanford by
a 12-0 score Saturday—a rest today.
The Beavers emerged from the Palo
Alto game with no serious hurts.
