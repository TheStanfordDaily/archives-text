EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 2 (UP).—The
University of Oregon's football team
had little time today for quiet con
templation of its upset 7-7 tie with
Southern California Saturday. Coach
Tex Oliver sent the Ducks through a
brief warm-up drill two hours after
they left the train.
Oregon — which meets Stanford
Saturday at Portland —suffered only
one casualty in the Trojan game.
Bob Blenkinsop, an end, will be out
for the season with a fractured el
bow.
