# Facing the Problem
## 
### 
THIS afternoon Stanford's 24 fraternities are
going to cross their bridges before they come
to them.
Designed to prepare the answers before the
questions arise, the first Interfraternity Con
ference will work on rushing, scholarship, and
finances at its meetings today, early in the
quarter, when all is still quiet on the Row.
Under the guiding hand of President Bob
Moulton, Interfraternity Board of Control, alum
ni advisers, house managers, and rushing chair
men will asemble to consider these inevitable
problems while they are in the embryo stage,
instead of waiting for them to creep up and
bludgeon them in the middle of the year.
It is obvious that the three topics chosen for
discussion form the heart of the current fra
ternity problem. How to stay on the black side
of the ledger is a question that resolves itself
down to facts and figures, dollars and cents.
How to raise the scholastic average is more a
matter of individual discipline than anything
else.
But in rushing lies the rub.
Despite stringent rules, in past years Inter
iraternity Council never has been completely
successful in eliminating illegal rushing. This
year it hopes to strengthen itself by warning
freshmen that they will lose their pledging
privileges if they attend off-campus parties.
However, the houses still are faced with one
all-important question: Who is going to report
illegal rushing?
Gentlemen always have considered part of
the unwritten code to be an obligation not to
squeal on one another. Yet the pledge to sup
port the rules of Interfraternity Council and the
spirit of the Honor Code requires that they do
just that, if they know of any illegitimate
rushing.
The job is a repugnant one at best. But it
must be done if the fraternity system is going
to continue at Stanford on the bases of decency,
honesty, and fair play.
