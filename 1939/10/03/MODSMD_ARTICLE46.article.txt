# Spotlight on Stanford
## 
### 
WITH a well-developed philosophy of indi
vidualism, a unique physical plant, and a
set of traditions which belies its short 50 years
of existence, Stanford University is an extreme
ly interesting place. Not only its out-of-the-way
corners, filled with memories of a fascinating
past, but its academic departments and its ac
tive population hold colorful stories that would
fill well over 1001 nights.
This morning's page 1 feature article on the
Guggenheim Aeronautics Laboratory is the
first of a series that The Daily will publish dur
ing the quarter dealing with interesting features
of Stanford that the typical student and faculty
member have failed to see, despite their one
or twenty-one years on the Quad. From the
tales of the mysterious Frenchman, Peter Coutts,
who owned the Farm in pre-Stanford days, to
the latest development in infantile paralysis
prevention, the campus is covered with ab
sorbing material which most people know
nothing about.
Through its series of articles The Daily will
bring the student body some of this information,
but it cannot cover the entire history of the
University that has piled up during the past 50
years and which still is being made every day.
Somewhere in the Stanford curriculum there
is room for a course about the Farm. A three
unit series of lectures about this fascinating
community would do the trick.
"Know thyself," a wise philosopher once
said. Stanford would do well to take the hint.
