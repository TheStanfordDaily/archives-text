WITH the opening yesterday of ticket sales
lor the U.S.C. and California games came
the yearly repetition of the complaint that Stan
ford students cannot seem to get seats any
where near the playing field for parents and
friends.
While a number of tickets on the 35-yard
line were placed on sale yesterday morning,
by noon the only Big Game tickets available to
students were on the 10-yard line. And this, at
$4.40 per ticket, seems hard.
Distribution of the tickets is apparently fair.
The rooting section occupies two sections
(about 4,000 seats) on the 50-yard line. Flanking
the rooters on one side is a section for faculty
members and their guests, and original stadium
subscribers and their guests; on the other side
is a section which includes the President's pre
ferred list, the Board of Trustees, the football
team complimentary list, Block "S" Society, and
Buck of the Month Club.
These four sections stretch from the 20-yard
line on one end to the 35-yard line at the other.
One section on each side of these four goes to
Stanford students, the B.A.C. says. Apparently
the better section was sold out before noon yes
terday.
Obviously students will not be given prefer
ence over such groups as the original stadium
subscribers. The only immediate solution is to
get up early next year and avoid the ticket
window rush.—J. B.
