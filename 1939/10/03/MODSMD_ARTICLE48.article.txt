WILL YOUR WIFE BE HAPPY?
T EONARD S. COTTRELL, Jr., and Ernest Watson
Burgess, two curious college professors, are shin
ing the search-light of science on happy marriages.
Their researches, they claim (after probing deep ques
tionnaires into 526 family hearths), "are sufficient to
show two things: that prediction of marriage adjust
ment is feasible, and that an expectancy table of prob
abilities of success and failure in marriage can be
devised." Won't that be wonderful? A big form chart
on Wall Street quoting odds on the happily-ever
after chances of the nation's newlyweds. Will Rogers
always used to say the country would get tired of
horse racing.
Apparently taking their cue from Tanforan as well
as the Physics Lab, these brave new moderns found,
among other things, that college graduates adjust
themselves'in marriage better than do high school and
grammar school alumni, and that there is a percentage
relationship between happy marriages and the follow
ing: agreement between husband and wife on finances,
agreement between husband and wife concerning
friends, and agreement between husband and wife con
cerning relatives. There's a hot tip for you. If you
and your wife want to be happy, all you have to do is
agree.

OUT that's not all that these male Beatrice Fair
faxes offer. They also find an uneven but more or
less accurate mathematical relationship between the
length of courtship and the degree of marital bliss.
Less than one year and your chances are slim, only
20 per cent. Three to five years of "going steady" give
a chap the best odds, but if you dilly-dally longer than
five years you may as well stay sweet as you wereâ€”if
you were.
This attempt to regiment courtship and make mari
tal happiness a matter of statistic prediction represents
about the last, straw in testing the public's gullibility.
Quasi-science has invaded every human privacy from
doodling to digestive sluggishness. Real science not only
is unable to protect an advertising-haggard public, but
also involuntarily plays host to the parasitic intellec
tual astrologers.
Well, here's just one more twentieth century cau
tion: Court for three years and six months, agree with
your mate, and go to college. Then you too can be
happily married. I wonder if those two research men
could have overlooked the importance of Listerine,
Life-Buoy, and Ex-Lax?
