# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						HORRORS OF WAR 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
There was a man of no mean insight who last year
wrote in to object to Mr. Jaques' general literary style.
I quote from the objector's criticism: "Jaques stinks."
Jaques has now given up his attempts to be the cam
pus keyhole columnist in order to turn his talents to
writing editorials. Some campus quibbler may write a
letter to decide which is the lesser of two evils, edi
torial or column; I merely wish to take exception to
one of Jaques points in his editorial "... Perhaps to
Dream."
In this editorial he claims that a soldier has a ten
to-one chance of returning from a war alive and un
wounded to lead a normal life. It is obvious that
Jaques has never met a man who has been under fire
in a war of any duration. I have met a few such men,
and I have talked to others who have been closely asso
ciated with such men. The number of those who return
from actual fighting in a war to lead a normal life arc
in such a small minority, that, they are scarcely worth
considering, when one recalls the thousands who can
never recover from the warping effect of their expe
rience.
# * # *
A LTHOUGH few will question that actual conditions
at home will be highly abnormal, it is not to these
that I refer; it is rather the character of the individual
himself who can never again reach a normal state. The
cynicism and bitterness of his war years are never for
gotten, no matter how normal and successful he may
seem to casual acquaintances. He has not lost his life
or damaged his body, but he has gained certain char
acteristics which will seriously impair his usefulness
in the community.
Mr. Jaques' appeal is to a short-sighted egoism
which holds that a man with a sound body is all that
is necessary for a completely normal life. He seems
to argue that the loss of life is the only deplorable
aspect of war. He might with profit visit some of our
insane and observe the physically perfect graduates of
the last war. Of course, the field for research in this
matter is far greater in Europe. I would further sug
gest that Mr. Jaques give some thought to his editorials,
particularly when he is writing on a subject so
thoroughly serious as war.
Sincerely,
Powers Cameron

wounded to lead a normal life. It is obvious that
Jaques has never met a man who has been under fire
in a war of any duration. I have met a few such men,
and I have talked to others who have been closely asso
ciated with such men. The number of those who return
from actual fighting in a war to lead a normal life arc
in such a small minority, that, they are scarcely worth
considering, when one recalls the thousands who can
never recover from the warping effect of their expe
rience.

A LTHOUGH few will question that actual conditions
at home will be highly abnormal, it is not to these
that I refer; it is rather the character of the individual

cynicism and bitterness of his war years are never for
gotten, no matter how normal and successful he may
seem to casual acquaintances. He has not lost his life
or damaged his body, but he has gained certain char
acteristics which will seriously impair his usefulness
in the community.
Mr. Jaques' appeal is to a short-sighted egoism
which holds that a man with a sound body is all that
is necessary for a completely normal life. He seems
to argue that the loss of life is the only deplorable
aspect of war. He might with profit visit some of our
insane and observe the physically perfect graduates of
the last war. Of course, the field for research in this
matter is far greater in Europe. I would further sug
gest that Mr. Jaques give some thought to his editorials,
particularly when he is writing on a subject so
thoroughly serious as war.

r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
There was a man of no mean insight who last year
wrote in to object to Mr. Jaques' general literary style.
I quote from the objector's criticism: "Jaques stinks."
Jaques has now given up his attempts to be the cam
pus keyhole columnist in order to turn his talents to
writing editorials. Some campus quibbler may write a
letter to decide which is the lesser of two evils, edi
torial or column; I merely wish to take exception to
one of Jaques points in his editorial "... Perhaps to
Dream."
In this editorial he claims that a soldier has a ten
to-one chance of returning from a war alive and un
wounded to lead a normal life. It is obvious that
Jaques has never met a man who has been under fire
in a war of any duration. I have met a few such men,
and I have talked to others who have been closely asso
ciated with such men. The number of those who return
from actual fighting in a war to lead a normal life arc
in such a small minority, that, they are scarcely worth
considering, when one recalls the thousands who can
never recover from the warping effect of their expe
rience.
