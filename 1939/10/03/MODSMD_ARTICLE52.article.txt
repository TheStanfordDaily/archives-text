# Father Time Overtakes Desert Song'
## 
### 
Probably a good percentage of to
day's Stanford men and women saw
"The Desert Song" when they were
wearing short pants and hair rib
bons. To those who cherish this
early adventure into the legitimate
theater, this reviewer's advice is to
live on your memories.
Ten years ago, when dashing
Perry Askam sang the role of the
Red Shadow he was the ideal musical
comedy hero; today he is getting a
bit shop-worn. After all, no one can
stay young and beautiful forever.
AGE TROUBLES CAST
The rest of the cast is having the
same trouble with the old man who
carries the scythe. Elvira Tanzi,
who is again the Red Shadow's love,
had considerable difficulty reconcil
ing wrinkles with her determined
girlish charm. And a half-hearted
attempt at swinging her songs adds
nothing to the operetta's really
beautiful music.
However, it is in Sigmund Rom
berg's tunes that the production's
true merit lies. Askam really lets
himself go on the rousing "Riff
Song," and for a moment there, you
are back in the days when operettas
were the style, and movies still were
seen and not heard. Then's when
you realize that it's still a great show
despite the fact that over-romanti
cized deserts now have lost their
glamour, and ponderous comedy is
no longer the rule.
Apparently the sets are as orig
inal as the cast, and they, too, have
that frayed look. The only good set
is one of the rising sun on the des
ert; they couldn't go wrong on that.
Costuming is far too elaborate, and
only serves to emphasize those no
longer lithe figures and double chins.
ENTERTAINMENT BORES
But the last straw is the enter
tainment between acts. In the old
production there was a song about
"It." This time it's "Ooomph" and
it is overdone by a young lady (the
only one in the cast) who wears a
tight, white sweater.
It is sad that this revival of "The
Desert Song"—intended to show how
long the cast has lasted—manages
instead to make the audience feel
that they ought to stop behaving in
that silly manner and retire to re
spectable middle-age.—Hovey

that they ought to stop behaving in
that silly manner and retire to re
spectable middle-age.—Hovey
Probably a good percentage of to
day's Stanford men and women saw
"The Desert Song" when they were
wearing short pants and hair rib
bons. To those who cherish this
early adventure into the legitimate
theater, this reviewer's advice is to
live on your memories.
Ten years ago, when dashing
Perry Askam sang the role of the
Red Shadow he was the ideal musical
comedy hero; today he is getting a
bit shop-worn. After all, no one can
stay young and beautiful forever.
AGE TROUBLES CAST
The rest of the cast is having the
same trouble with the old man who
carries the scythe. Elvira Tanzi,
who is again the Red Shadow's love,
had considerable difficulty reconcil
ing wrinkles with her determined
girlish charm. And a half-hearted
attempt at swinging her songs adds
nothing to the operetta's really
beautiful music.
However, it is in Sigmund Rom
berg's tunes that the production's
true merit lies. Askam really lets
himself go on the rousing "Riff
Song," and for a moment there, you
are back in the days when operettas
were the style, and movies still were
seen and not heard. Then's when
you realize that it's still a great show
despite the fact that over-romanti
cized deserts now have lost their
glamour, and ponderous comedy is
no longer the rule.
Apparently the sets are as orig
inal as the cast, and they, too, have
that frayed look. The only good set
is one of the rising sun on the des
ert; they couldn't go wrong on that.
Costuming is far too elaborate, and
only serves to emphasize those no
longer lithe figures and double chins.
ENTERTAINMENT BORES
But the last straw is the enter
tainment between acts. In the old
production there was a song about
"It." This time it's "Ooomph" and
it is overdone by a young lady (the
only one in the cast) who wears a
tight, white sweater.
It is sad that this revival of "The
Desert Song"—intended to show how
long the cast has lasted—manages
instead to make the audience feel
that they ought to stop behaving in
that silly manner and retire to re
spectable middle-age.—Hovey
