### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
pRIME MINISTER Neville Cham
berlain neatly spiked any peace
overtures that Adolf Hitler may
make this week when he told the
House of Commons that Britain was
ready to "examine and test" any
Nazi peace proposals—but not on the
basis of the Russo-German conquest
of Poland.
Chamberlain simply said that Brit
ain and France will refuse to nego
tiate with a German government
headed by Hitler, that the unswerv
ing purpose of the Allies is to fight
on "until Hitlerism is crushed."
* * *
Obviously the test to which Brit
ain would put German peace pro
posals is one that Hitler's pres
tige and probably his entire Nazi
regime could not survie—the ir
revocable wiping out of the inva
sion of Poland, the "liberation" of
Czechoslovakia and the banish
ment forever of Nazi methods of
conquest.
In Berlin, it. was readily admitted
that Chamberlain had apparently
doomed Hitler's much-touted "peace
offensive." In fact, it seems now that
there remains little for Hitler to do
but to go before his deputies of the
Reichstag Thursday or Friday 2nd
serve a blistering "peace ultimatum"
upon Britain and France, which
these two nations will almost cer
tainly reject.
* * *
HPHE "scarcely veiled threat" of
Russian intervention cannot
swerve Britain and France from
their determination to crush Hit
lerism and "make certain that the
rule of violence shall cease and
that the words of governments,
once pledged, must henceforth be
kept," Chamberlain said. These
words had a round, rhetorical turn
that members of the House of
Commons love.
As the 70-year-old Prime Minis
ter said the Allies will fight on to a
finish even if Soviet Russia should
throw her enormous war machine
into the struggle on Germany's side,
the crowded House burst into cheers.
Although he seemed willing to
"examine" the peace formula which
Hitler is expected to outline this
week, Chamberlain held out little
hope that it would provide a means
of ending the month-old conflict.
Chamberlain, in reality, rejected
in advance Hitler's anticipated de
mand that the Allies recognize the
Nazi-Soviet conquest of Poland and
call off the war "because there is
nothing left to fight about."
* * *
ADDITIONAL color crept into
- the dramatic session when
white-haired Lloyd George, World
War premier of England and tra
ditional foe of Naziism, warned
Chamberlain to give cautious con
sideration to the German propos
als. He predicted that they might
be "far-reaching plans for perma
nent adjustments."
The old-time premier and British
political chieftain of unnumbered
campaigns urged that the United
States should be brought into any
peace discussions because "the
United States could help as a neu
tral." With the neutrality question
still hanging fire in Congress's spe
cial session, it's a sure bet that the
United States would refuse to meet
in any discussion with the European
powers, at least &t this time.

Alfred Duff Cooper, fiery first
lord of the admiralty who quit the
cabinet last year because he couldn't
swallow Chamberlain's since-scut
tled appeasement policy, interrupted
the meeting with the accusation that
Lloyd George's speech would be mis
interpreted as "a suggestion of sur
render." Lloyd George leaped to his
feet in angry protest.
"I would be the last man to say
we should surrender," he barked.
