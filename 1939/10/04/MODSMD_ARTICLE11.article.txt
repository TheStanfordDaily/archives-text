# Interfraternity Conference Stresses Co-operative Action
## 
### 
"There has been striking improve- i
mcnt in the fraternity situation at
Stanford in the past few years." So
spoke President Ray Lyman Wilbur
at the closing banquet of the first
fall Interfraternity Conference last
night.
Speaking to about 100 fraternity
presidents, rushing chairmen, and
house managers, President Wilbur
and Dean of Men John Bunn both
assured the group that the Uni
versity administration was behind
any improvements or progressive
plans the fraternities jnight carry
out. Dean Bunn called the Confer
ence itself "one of the most pro
gressive movements on the Stan
ford campus since I have been
here."
Its purpose to consider and pos
sibly solve problems that will face
the fraternities in the coming year,
the Conference consisted of group
meetings and discussions in the af
ternoon, with the banquet serving
as a summary business meeting for
all fraternity leaders.
Main problem of interest and dis
cussion was that of rushing. To
give house officers specific informa
tion on rushing regulations, Dick
Hoover, secretary of Interfraternity
Council, reported the results o'f the
rushing chairmen's meeting in the
afternoon.
"Accidental meetings between
[ fraternity men and frosh off-cam
pus, if followed by further conver
sation and general mixing, consti
tute illegal rushing," stated Hoover.
"All illegal rushing will be dealt
talk. A co-operative government,

with severely, but, with co-operative
action between houses and the
Council, it is hoped that such cases
will be rare."
Co-operation between the Uni
versity administration and fraterni
ties was the keynote of Dean Bunn's
conducted by the University and i,ts
students, will bring out the finest
results in University life and activi
ties, according to the guest speaker.
He pointed out that even in Encina
Hall such co-operation must exist.
' Though there were less 'fiunk
outs' in Encina last year than in the
past five years, the fraternities must
continue co-operating with us if they
want to continue with full houses,
for Encina is their 'source of sup
ply'," declared the Dean of Men.
In regard to the relationship be
tween the University and the Itow,
Dean Bunn believes that rules and
regulations are not much in them
selves; it is the attitude of the group
toward these rules and regulations
that counts.
Mr. George A. Whistler, president
of the Alumni Interfraternity Con
ference, gave a report of last Thurs
day's meeting of that organization.
All the discussions on various sub
jects and problems concluded with
the fact that leadership is behind the
successes or failures of the indi
vidual houses, reported Mr. Whis
tler.

I some form to all fraternities, were
j touched on by Lloyd Wilson, chair-
I man of the house managers' discus
sion group.
President Bob Moulton of Inter
fraternity Council presided at the
banquet as well as the meeting of
the house presidents. Closing the
banquet with plans for the future
year, Moulton declared that the fra
ternities should co-operate with the
' Council in "striving as a group to
make Stanford a better University."

"Accidental meetings between
[ fraternity men and frosh off-cam
pus, if followed by further conver
sation and general mixing, consti
tute illegal rushing," stated Hoover.
"All illegal rushing will be dealt
talk. A co-operative government,

with severely, but, with co-operative

students, will bring out the finest
results in University life and activi
ties, according to the guest speaker.
He pointed out that even in Encina
Hall such co-operation must exist.
' Though there were less 'fiunk
outs' in Encina last year than in the
past five years, the fraternities must
continue co-operating with us if they
want to continue with full houses,
for Encina is their 'source of sup
ply'," declared the Dean of Men.
In regard to the relationship be
tween the University and the Itow,
Dean Bunn believes that rules and
regulations are not much in them
selves; it is the attitude of the group
toward these rules and regulations
that counts.
