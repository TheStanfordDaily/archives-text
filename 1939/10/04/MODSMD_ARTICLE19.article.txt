# Excom Slates Election to Fill Vacated Posts
## School Votes Oct. 17 On Graduate Woman, Men's Council Jobs 
### 
A special student body election
will be held Oct. 17 to fill offices left
vacant by the failure of two students
to return to Stanford this year, it
was decided last night by Ex Com
mittee at its first meeting of the
year with Ken Cuthbertson presid
ing.
The following positions will be
filled:
1. Graduate woman on Ex Com
mittee, vacant because Roberta Tut
hill failed to return.
2. Men's Council member, vacant
because Harlan Copsey failed to
return.
Acting on Art Gore's application
for a date for the annual Student-
Faculty Field Day, the committee
approved Oct. 18 as the date for
the affair. It was decided last year
that shifting the day from spring to
fall would relieve the usual con
gestion of activities during the spring
months.
AXE RESTRICTED
On motion of Mollie West, an
amount up to $50 was granted to
Axe Society—traditional organizers
of the field day—providing the so
ciety pays of! its $18 debt to the
Associated Students before Oct. 18.
Student Manager John Cobbs sug
gested this restriction, since Axe
Society exceeded its allotment last
year by $18, a debt still owing to the
A.S.S.U.
The society was given permission
to solicit fraternities, sororities, eat
ing clubs, and dining halls for funds
to pay for the field day barbecue.
Other business of the evening fol

RECORD PLAYER: On motion
of Bill Janss, the committee went on
record as favoring return of the
record machine to the place it occu
pied last year in the Union Cellar.
Although Ex Committee has not
the final say in the matter—the de
cision is up to the Union Board of
Governors —it wants the machine
back because it earned around $15
a week toward the boathousc debt.
APPOINTMENTS: The following
appointments were made by Cuth
bertson and approved by Ex Com
mittee last night:
Dick Simpson, as student member
of the Union Board of Governors;
Grcyson Bryan, as lecture series
manager; Bill Lcckic, as election
board chairman; Lyle Cook, as ac
tivities co-ordinator; Art Gore, as
head of men's card file; Oliver Wy
man, as manager of Speakers' Bu
reau.
