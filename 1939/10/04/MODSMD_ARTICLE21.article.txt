might soon embroil Italy. Authorita
tive quarters in Rome said II Duce
favors a seven-power conference
comprising the United States, Ger

Italy and Turkey to seek a way of

Such a conference, according to
the Italian view, is the only hope; of

BRITISH PLEA RAISED
In the British House of Commons
another plea for inclusion of the
United States in any pcace discus

Lloyd George, Britain's World War
Premier, who warned Premier Ne
ville Chamberlain to give cautious
consideration to any proposals Hitler
may present.
The French believed Hitler had
abandoned his plans for. a "peace
ultimatum" before the Reichstag and
would substitute a series of milder
I proposals to be relayed through
some small neutral nation, perhaps
Belgium or Switzerland.
There seemed to be considerable
doubt the United States would en
ter into any peace conference at this
time, particularly in view of the
battle under way in Congress over
President Roosevelt's proposal to re
vise the neutrality act and permit
cash-and-carry arms shipments to
the warring nations.

Russia increased pressure on Lat

virtual Soviet protectorates in the
Baltic and was understood to have

Latvia and Lithuania would yield
quickly, making complete Soviet
domination of the inner Baltic.

ritorial waters.
By United Press

Premier Honito Mussolini of Italy was reported Tuesday night to Ik:
seeking a seven-power conference, which would include the United States,
as the only remaining hope of ending the European war, following Britain's
advance refusal to talk peace on any terms dictated by Adolf Hitler.
Mussolini, with little heart for war, still appeared to he struggling for a

( way out irom a real war' thai
might soon embroil Italy. Authorita
tive quarters in Rome said II Duce
favors a seven-power conference
comprising the United States, Ger
many, Russia, Great Britain, France,
Italy and Turkey to seek a way of
calling off the fight.
Such a conference, according to
the Italian view, is the only hope; of
swerving Britain and France from
their refusal to talk pcace on thr
basis of the partitioning of Poland.
BRITISH PLEA RAISED
In the British House of Commons
another plea for inclusion of the
United States in any pcace discus
sions was raised by fiery David
Lloyd George, Britain's World War
Premier, who warned Premier Ne
ville Chamberlain to give cautious
consideration to any proposals Hitler
may present.
The French believed Hitler had
abandoned his plans for. a "peace
ultimatum" before the Reichstag and
would substitute a series of milder
I proposals to be relayed through
some small neutral nation, perhaps
Belgium or Switzerland.
There seemed to be considerable
doubt the United States would en
ter into any peace conference at this
time, particularly in view of the
battle under way in Congress over
President Roosevelt's proposal to re
vise the neutrality act and permit
cash-and-carry arms shipments to
the warring nations.
RUSSIA TIGHTENS GRASP
Russia increased pressure on Lat
via and Lithuania to join Estonia as
virtual Soviet protectorates in the
Baltic and was understood to have
proposed a pact of mutual assistance
with Turkey, guardian of the Dar
danelles. It was taken for granted
Latvia and Lithuania would yield
quickly, making complete Soviet
domination of the inner Baltic.
President Roosevelt warned Amer
ican merchant vessels against boot
legging supplies and fuel to belliger
ent ships plying near American ter
ritorial waters.
