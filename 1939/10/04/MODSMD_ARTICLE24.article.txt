# Grafting, Pollination Done on Farm Orchard
## W. F. Wight Starts Experiment In 1922 on Twenty-acre Plot 
### BUD AMES 
By BUD AMES

Hidden in the fields behind the Chemistry Building, Stanford and the
United States Department oi' Agriculture maintain an experimental or
chard, a verdant, tree-packed, fruit-filled plot of ahout 20 acres.
The orchard blossomed into being back in 1!)22 with a half-way merger
of the Department of Agriculture, which supplied the necessary monetary

backing, and Stanford University,
which donated the equally neces
sary land and water. Since that
time, Mr. William F. Wight, lecturer
in biology, has been supervising the
orchard's progress and baffling
Mother Nature.
GRAD STUDENTS ASSIST
Scholastically speaking, Stanford
students have no connection with the
orchard, but, according to Mr.
Wight, graduate students have often
been hired by the Department oi
Agriculture to assist in the lengthy
job of pollination. It is through this
careful pollination that new varieties
of the orchard's four fruits —peach-
es, apricots, plums and pears — are
developed which, after all, is the
goal of Mr. Wight's experimenta
tion.
The exact number of trees grow
ing in those 20 acres is not known
but estimates place the figure at
about 3000, arranged in rows about
20 feet apart. Neither is the amount
of water used every month estab
lished. "We just use enough water
to keep the ground moist," Mr.
Wight stated.
LINNETS, ONLY PROBLEM
Problems — the orchard has thou
sands of them, and all in the form
of linnets, a little bird with a vorac
ious appetite who seems to appear
with the ripening apricots. The or
chard, however, has no fear of frost
and as yet has had no fruit frozen
in a quick cold snap.
When questioned as to whether or
not he crossed any plums with ap
ricots, Mr. Wight laughed and re
plied, "That would be as easy as'
crossing a dog with a cow. We do
do some grafting of one type of
branch to another type of tree, how
ever, and the resulting fruit is sur
prisingly good."
What happens to the products of
the orchard? A great deal of the
lruit drops to the ground and rots,
some is stolen by the birds, and
part is sold to the public by the
University.

Hidden in the fields behind the Chemistry Building, Stanford and the
United States Department oi' Agriculture maintain an experimental or
chard, a verdant, tree-packed, fruit-filled plot of ahout 20 acres.
The orchard blossomed into being back in 1!)22 with a half-way merger
of the Department of Agriculture, which supplied the necessary monetary

backing, and Stanford University,
which donated the equally neces
sary land and water. Since that
time, Mr. William F. Wight, lecturer
in biology, has been supervising the
orchard's progress and baffling
Mother Nature.
GRAD STUDENTS ASSIST
Scholastically speaking, Stanford
students have no connection with the
orchard, but, according to Mr.
Wight, graduate students have often
been hired by the Department oi
Agriculture to assist in the lengthy
job of pollination. It is through this
careful pollination that new varieties
of the orchard's four fruits —peach-
es, apricots, plums and pears — are
developed which, after all, is the
goal of Mr. Wight's experimenta
tion.
The exact number of trees grow
ing in those 20 acres is not known
but estimates place the figure at
about 3000, arranged in rows about
20 feet apart. Neither is the amount
of water used every month estab
lished. "We just use enough water
to keep the ground moist," Mr.
Wight stated.
LINNETS, ONLY PROBLEM
Problems — the orchard has thou
sands of them, and all in the form
of linnets, a little bird with a vorac
ious appetite who seems to appear
with the ripening apricots. The or
chard, however, has no fear of frost
and as yet has had no fruit frozen
in a quick cold snap.
When questioned as to whether or
not he crossed any plums with ap
ricots, Mr. Wight laughed and re
plied, "That would be as easy as'
crossing a dog with a cow. We do
do some grafting of one type of
branch to another type of tree, how
ever, and the resulting fruit is sur
prisingly good."
What happens to the products of
the orchard? A great deal of the
lruit drops to the ground and rots,
some is stolen by the birds, and
part is sold to the public by the
University.
