# New Engine Foils Firebug
## New Six-man Truck Holds 600 Gallons 
### 
The next time the fire whistle
blows and the sirens begin to wail,
Number GG, the latest addition to
Stanford University's Fire Depart
ment, will be taking an airing. The
pride and joy of the firehouse boys,
Sixty-six is the only one of its kind
on the peninsula.
The new fire engine, designed by
Chief Dugan, has eight pump tanks
holding 300 gallons of water, and is
mounted on a Ford cab-over-engine
truck chassis with a 95-horsepower
motor. Its 101-inch wheelbase is de
signed for maneuverability at grass
fires.
Built by the P. E. Van Pelt Co. of
Oakdale, the new equipment made
its initial run Monday afternoon in
response to a grass five alarm from
the Webb ranch on Portola Road.
Delivered Sunday, the wagon holds
6 men, 2 in the cab and 4 outside.
Other features of the new red
wagon are its two-speed differential
and its provision for 500 feet of
hose.

Monday's run with the engine was
incidentally caused by the depre
dations of a fire-bug, who also
caused equipment at Menlo and
Woodside to make several runs, ac
cording to word received from the
Stanford Fire Department.
