# San Francisco Exposition To Close Gates Oct. 29, Declares High Official
## Bay Region Groups Fail to Raise $1,500,000 to Assure Second Year; Thin Receipts Advance Closing Date 
### 
EXCLUSIVE TO THE DAILY
The Stanford Daily learned late last night from an authoritative source
that the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island will close
oilicially on Oct. 2!) instead of Dec. 2 as originally scheduled.
At the same time The Daily also was told thai the press as well as the
general public would not be informed of this newest decision of the Fair's

administration until noon
supposedly at a general luncheon in
San Francisco.
While several Bay area groups—
especially the hotel and transporta
tion interests — have organized a
new body to extend the Exposition
into 1940, opponents of a renewal
insist that all efforts at raising the
$1,500,000 necessary for rehabilitat
ing the grounds, have failed. The
exact reasons for advancing the
closing date more than a full month
from the original Dec. 2 date was
not immediately divulged, although
rumors of dissension among the
higher officialdom and exceedingly
slim gate receipts are said to have
been instrumental in the action.
The Daily "source" further in
sisted that a wholesale firing of de
partment heads and lesser lights
would begin tomorrow and continue j
until the Exposition breathes its last.
While the Charles "Doc" Strub man
agement had apparently brought, the
huge mid-bay project back into the
black ink ledger, the unexpected an
nouncements to come today would
seem to indicate that his efforts had
turned out as bleakly as those of his
predecessors.
Possibilities of a reopening are
still in the hands of the new bay
group, who insist that the Fair in its
second year would bring millions of
dollars and tourists into San Fran
cisco's not-too-overloaded coffers.
