### JERRY MAYER 
(Doug Guy. who coyers water
polo for The Daily and also acts
as peninsula correspondent for the
San Francisco Chronicle, takes
over Slants today to tell you
about the newest thing in football
players.)

15y DOUGLAS GUI!

Remember—we're not sure about
it, but there is a possibility that
Stanford's football machine, with all
its Standlees. Andersens, Coldirons,
Donahues, Alberts—and Kmetovics
-etc., is a very incomplete unit.
A freshman from somewhere, a
major in the "Sex Life of an Aus
tralian Flea," or something, some
one said, told us of a somewhat dif
ferent type of player who used to
cavort in his prep brain factory. If
such a man is necessary to make for
a completely balanced team, and a
becoming bullock of power, Stan
lord is out.
He looked so much like a profes
sor that we settled back for a dis
cussion—on the science of football,
its good and evil points.
DIALOGUE
"I used to know a player back in
my high school who was about as
good as Standlee. But he was a me
chanical player," started goggle
eyes.
"A mechanical player? That
must been interesting." Just try to
imagine the conference allowing —
well! '"Say. how'd he run?"
'"Fast."
"Sounds as if he used electricity."
"He was energetic, powerful."
DID HE HAVE BRAINS
"How about scholastic troubles," I
suggested. "It's hard enough for
students with brains to get anything
out of a professor's lecture. They
get on your nerves, you know."
"Oh, A1 was smart. Very mechan
ical about his studies, also. Lec
tures didn't bother him. He had
nerves of steel."
"Nerves of steel?"
"As tough as nails. We called him
'the iron man'."
THE IRON MAN
"Logical name."
The iron man —maybe this guy
really was a robot.
"But Al had a tragic end—was
clipped by a (ire engine one day."
"It put him out of shape, I sup
pose."
Didn't hurt him physically," the
freshman explained with a serious
expression, "but it affected him.
They took him away to the nut fac
tory. Still there. Tough. We used
to say. 'they scrapped the iron man'."
I dunno, maybe Tiny Thornhill's
passing up a bet.
