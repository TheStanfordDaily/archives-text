# Arc Lights Burn as Tiny Strikes for Oregon Win
## Coach Sends Boys Through Dummy Scrimmage, Works Out New Plays 
### 
Tiny Thornhill cracked the whip last night.
The Indian chief kept his Big Red Machine working under the arc
lights oi the practice Held until well after the rest of the Farm bad finished
dinner. It was the second night iu a row that the lights burned.
After a prolonged dummy scrimmage in which he ran three full teams
through several new plays that are to be used in an effort to stop Tex

Oliver s Oregon Webfeet, Thornhill,
used most of the first two strings
in a defensive scrimmage.
The Card first string was never
in as a unit, but several of its mem
bers worked. With the exception of
Norm Standlee, the defensive back
fields showed a definite weakness
against passes. Cookie South and
John Casey looked very good run
ning the ball against the gray-shirted
defensive players. South starred es
pecially on quick - breaking line
plays, and gave the Indian defense
a taste of what to expect when they
go up against Jay Graybeal, Oregon
flash.
TWO BACKS OUT
Both Jim Groves and Hugh Gal
larneau, right halfbacks, were un
able to practice in last night's ses
sion. Gallarneau is out of the hos
pital. and was on the practice field
for a time, watching the rest of the
squad work out. Groves also
showed up, and should play some
ball in Portland Saturday.
The first-string lineup in dummy
scrimmage found Stojkovich and
Graff at ends, Anderson and Johan
sen at tackles. Pool and Donahue at
guards, and Jim Verdiek at center.
Johnny Sturgeon was still at the
blocking half spot, although a sore
arm kept him out of the rough work.
Frankie Albert, Gene Coldiron,
and Norm Standlee handled the
other three first-string backfield po
sitions.
WILLARD WEARS BRACE
Fred Meyer and Bill Greer were
the second-string wingmen. Bill
Willard still has a brace on his knee,
and will not be able to play at all
Saturday.
Bill Trout and Winkie Jones were
behind Johansen and Andersen at
tackles. Patterson and Kerman were
the second-team guards, and Colin

McClintock worked at the center
post.
The backfield was made up of
Pete Kmetovic, Bob "Crunch" Crane, I
John Casey, and Cookie South.
The Oregon team that the Thorn- -
hillmen will meet Saturday will go j
down on the records, no matter how
they play during the rest of the I
season, as the first Eugene team in j
many a year to play good ball in |
Los Angeles. Oliver was undoubt
edly pointing for that game, and his j
eleven, after a battle like that, may j
not be in top shape when the In
dians take the field against them.
