# Waterdogs to Open Season With New Attack Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Hungarian system of playing
water polo will be employed by
Stanford University tomorrow ;il -
ternoon at 4:30 o'clock when the
Indians battle with San Jose State
in the opening encounter of the sta
j son at Encina pool.
According to Coach Nort Thorn
ton, for the interest of technical ob
servers, the contest will feature the
Hungarian style, as accented by the
Indians, against the American plan,
j practiced by the Spartans.
Jn short, the Hungarian system, a
new institution in Stanford water
' polo circles, is a six-man offense
which has a last break and a short
i passing game to worry opponents.
The American system, as used by
most teams, including tomorrow's
opposition, is a long passing game
| and a position system. Followers of
the "all toughie" sport find that the
j latter plan works only if a suitable
! ball handler is present at one of the
J forward positions.
1 FORWARDS WORRY COA( !i
Johnny Lamb, l'or three consecu
j tive years unanimous all-confer
; ence forward, handled this job for
; the local contingent during recent
j seasons, but the star's graduation
I left Coach Thornton short-handed
i this year.
In fact, the forward spots have
! been the big worry of Thornton to
! date. In practice yesterday, how
| ever, the two men whom Thornton
holds forth as hopefuls blossomed in
unexpected beauty, and Bill Bleeek
er and Dave Nottage looked capable
of taking over the sorry forward
posts.
LINE-UP LISTED
The line-up for tomorrow's scrap
i will have Captain Bob Plate at
i sprint, Bob Bleecker, left forward;
! Dave Nottage, right forward; Bob
I Allen, center back; Dick Hoover

left guard; Ted Moreno, right guard;
and Frank Dowling, goalie.
Bill Burns, who starred in early
season practices, has been confined
to the rest home. He may be re
leased by game time, but would be
capable of playing only a few min
utes of the battle, Thornton be
lieves.
