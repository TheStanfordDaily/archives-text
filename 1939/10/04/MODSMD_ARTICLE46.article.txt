# Papoose Soccer Games Scheduled
## 
### 
With a forward line that has
shown itself strong and aggressive
in practice workouts, the 1939 edi
tion of the Papoose soccer squad
has proved itself one of the most
promising aggregations to strike the
Farm in recent years.
Coach Tevfik SaduUah is having
his troubles picking his lirst string
men with such an array of frosh
talent. No definite schedule has
been arranged, but the Cal games
have been set for Nov. 18 and 25.
Practice tilts have been tentative
ly slated with San Mateo, Menlo,
and other nearby schools in order
to whip the outfit into shape for their
season-full of big games.
