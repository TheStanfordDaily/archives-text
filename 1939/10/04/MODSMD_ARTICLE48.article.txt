AFTER sitting demurely for many years on
page 1067 of Webster's International Dic
tionary, the word "ideology" recently has come
out of its shell and made its way to the top of
etymological society. Once a mere two-bit
word, it became, in the days preceding the
Second World War, one of the most important
and freguently used words in the English lan
guage—the universal cure-all, the excuse for
everything.
When the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact
was announced early in August, the same
thought ran through the staggering minds of
Europe's great ambassadors and the men who
sat at home reading the morning papers: "Why,
Russia and Germany have opposing ideologies.
It can't be possible."
But, it did happen, and it was possible.
Optimistically it has been stated that a na
tional ideology is an expression of the will of
the people. That may be true. But, the exis
tence of that will is no guarantee that the gov
ernment in power is going to be guided by it.
Popular ideologies in many cases have been
created by absolutist governments themselves,
and used for sedative injections on the people
they are exploiting. The drugs that Hitler and
Stalin have concocted look different only on
the outside of the package. Actually their
effects are identical.
Whether a dictator shouts the catch-phrases
of Communism or National Socialism, the single
aim he has in mind is the supremacy of the state
created at the expense of the individual.
In the abolition of personal liberty Soviet
Russia and Nazi Germany have found a com
mon ground. And this, they have decided, is
a more than sufficient basis for exposing their
ideologies for the shams they are, and joining
hands to conguer Europe.
