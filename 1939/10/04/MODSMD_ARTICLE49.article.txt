THE Palo Alto City Council could not have
voted a $500,000 appropriation to better ad
vantage for the Stanford student than it did at
its special meeting Monday night.
It voted, at last, to build an underpass leading
from. Palm Drive into University Avenue. The
day is at hand when the last long line of traffic
is held up while local train number 6X stops
for passengers, or the midnight freight slowly
rolls through, piling up extra lockout minutes.
The day is at hand, yes; but not quite here.
Monday night's meeting approved the plan.
Today or tomorrow the day for the submission
of contracts will be set; this date will probably
be around Nov. 1. And sometime next month
actual construction will begin.
Winter quarter will be blacker than usual this
year. Not only will there be the natural con
fusion at the sight of the actual construction
with traffic probably routed from the Farm by
way of Embarcadero, but much of University
Avenue itself will be closed off for a time.
However, the result will be a much smoother
spring quarter; a spring quarter free of traffic
tie-ups and irritating delays.
And next year's frosh will talk about the
slow, old-fashioned days when . . . —D. J.
