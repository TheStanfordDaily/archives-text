# Socrates at Stanford
## 
### 
WHEN Dr. D. Elton Trueblood arrived on the
campus three years ago, he brought with
him a number of seeds not native to the Farm.
Several of these he planted in the Stanford soil
to germinate, and at least one of them he has
nurtured to produce a brilliant blossom.
Luncheon Club meets at noon every Wed
nesday in the Nitery to bring together a group
of between 65 and 75 students for a non-profit,
25-cent lunch, new social contacts, and a chance
to hear an interesting talk by a worth-while
speaker. Considered from any aspect, this is
an undeniable bargain.
But, even so, of the thousands of people that
walk by the Union at 12 o'clock every Wed
nesday, only a few head for the Nitery.
Most of them feel that they do not need to

share in the advantages that Luncheon Club
offers. They have their houses, their eating
clubs, their dining halls, where social inter
course is a drug on the market —and intellectual
stimulus willingly is forgotten.
However, Dr. Trueblood's Luncheon Club is
not composed of a mere 65 or 75 faithful follow
ers. At one time or another it has embraced a
large, if unestimable, percentage of the Stanford
body corporate within its membership.
The group that has found the Club most valu
able is the so-called "Independents." Given the
opportunity to carry their ideas and their com
panionship outside the limiting walls of a class
room or a booth in the Union Cellar, they have
found that the Nitery air is thick with thought.
Indeed, with Dr. Trueblood as its Socrates,
Luncheon Club is rapidly becoming a second
School of Athens.
