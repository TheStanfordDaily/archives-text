### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THE GENTLEMAN CRIES PEACE
r FWENTY-TWO years ago a bellows-voiced, bushy
haired Senator from Wisconsin glared at his hostile,
war-bigoted enemies. Militantly a pacifist, old Robert
LaFollette refused to be socially or politically bludgeon
ed into signing a death-and-torture warrant for his
American brothers.
"Traitor!" shrieked the Senate.
And Bob LaFollette roared back. "The man who
calls me unpatriotic lies in his throat!"
Almost the only other man to stand by this veteran
humanitarian is now a semi-toothless, silver-haired
Senator from Nebraska. "You are coining into gold,"
George Norris told his colleagues, "the life-blood of
your countrymen." •
But all through the fight, where was Senator Wil
liam Borah?
To hear the worthy Idahoan, one would imagine his
voice was raised for pcace in 1917 as loudly as it is
raised for the embargo now. But it wasn't. And even
then our "one-man Maginot line" was skilled in the
deceiving art of rhetoric. Wild-Bill Borah lias never
been a violet.

4 ND so when Senator Borah screams about "war
mongers trying to repeal the embargo" one tends
to be a little wary, a little less enthusiastic over Bor
ah's speech than Borah is. I am not so sure that the
defenders of the arms embargo are the defenders of
American neutrality.
As Senator Borah's own case in 1917 proves, a los
ing Ally-cause generates pro-war sentiment in Amer
ica. That seems to be so whether we like it or not.
Hence, even in the interests of neutrality, it would be
better if England and France had arms—so long as
Europe's war must be. It would be different if Amer
ica's economy were so organized that absolute isola
tion could be achieved. But Borah and the other re
peal-foes are not fighting for that. It's all right to send
raw materials to wars, they say. Only keep our guns
at home.
But it may not be a question of keeping our guns at
home at all. It may be a question of who is going to
take our guns to Europe: English ships or American
soldiers. One thing that can be said against repeal
of the arms embargo is that any apparent concession
to neutrality is bad. But on such a delicate psycho
logical foundation it seems unreasonable to condemn a
wiser neutrality program.
It is too bad that political and economic questions
which affect millions of Jives must stupidly be based
on emotion and hysteria. But that's the way we blun
der along, Our emotions (and Senator Borah's) were
wrong in 1917. Let England use our guns to fight her
own battles, and let's hope that the war will never dis
suade our Senator Borahs from believing in American
peace.
