LOOKING THROUGH THE MIRROR

r EDITOR, SIR:
A University paper should have something of the
University spirit: it should have no editorial policy
but the quest of many-sided truth. The Daily offers at
present very able and very virulent propaganda: I use
the word without sinister implication, merely as a
synonym for partisanship. It presents the side of the
Isolationist - Pro-Nazi - Pacifist coalition. It would be
interesting to have, once in a while, a few words in
favor of world democracy, organized peace, and a
binding international law. The spirit of Norman An
gell in his prophetic book: "Peace with the Dictators?"
might be worth presenting. Thomas Mann ("self
styled German author" as he was called in San Fran
cisco Chronicle Monday morning) deserves a hearing.
So does Chester Rowell. And there are such move
ments as The New Commonwealth and Clarence Streit's
Union Now.
I do not apologize for meddling with what is strictly
students' business. We form a community of learners
and investigators, young middle-aged and elderly;
there should be no absolute line of cleavage between
us.

THE GLAMOUR GIRLS GROW UP

r EDITOR, SIR:
Bull Sessioner's article on "glamour girls" im
mediately brought to mind Pearl Buck's "America's
Gunpowder Women." (Harper's, July, 1939) I wish
here to relate simply the one to the other.
Author Buck was referring to the great majority of
American women who are so privileged that there is
no demand made upon them by the world, who, when
their children are gone, are left in the prime of life
t with the tragic feeling that there is no longer a need
for them—that there is nothing to do. They should
have begun to plan years before, yet they didn't. I
feel that the "glamour girls" are the type of our Stan
ford women who will later become the "gunpowder
women" of America.
We have Mellinkoff's definition of what they are now
at Stanford. Here is Pearl Buck's description of them
in mature womanhood; "Spoiled, petty, restless, idle,
they are our nation's greatest unused resource—good
brains going to waste in bridge and movies and lectures
and dull gossip, instead of constructively applied to
the nation's need of them."
Before it is too late, our women at Stanford should
turn their attention and initiative away from the idea
of "marriage competition." Our country is full of things
in vital need of the understanding and ability of
women—especially college graduates. They should find
their capabilities and plan and prepare while they still
have the opportunity and inspiration of an education.
Above all they should remember the message of Pearl
Buck, that: "Work is the one supreme privilege which
too many women in America with all their extraordi
nary unearned privileges never know. And yet it is
the one privilege which will make them free."
Sincerely yours,

the word without sinister implication, merely as a
synonym for partisanship. It presents the side of the
Isolationist - Pro-Nazi - Pacifist coalition. It would be
interesting to have, once in a while, a few words in
favor of world democracy, organized peace, and a
binding international law. The spirit of Norman An
gell in his prophetic book: "Peace with the Dictators?"
might be worth presenting. Thomas Mann ("self
styled German author" as he was called in San Fran
cisco Chronicle Monday morning) deserves a hearing.
So does Chester Rowell. And there are such move
ments as The New Commonwealth and Clarence Streit's
Union Now.
I do not apologize for meddling with what is strictly
students' business. We form a community of learners
and investigators, young middle-aged and elderly;
there should be no absolute line of cleavage between
us.

THE GLAMOUR GIRLS GROW UP

r EDITOR, SIR:
Bull Sessioner's article on "glamour girls" im
mediately brought to mind Pearl Buck's "America's
Gunpowder Women." (Harper's, July, 1939) I wish
here to relate simply the one to the other.
Author Buck was referring to the great majority of
American women who are so privileged that there is
no demand made upon them by the world, who, when
their children are gone, are left in the prime of life
t with the tragic feeling that there is no longer a need
for them—that there is nothing to do. They should
have begun to plan years before, yet they didn't. I
feel that the "glamour girls" are the type of our Stan
ford women who will later become the "gunpowder
women" of America.
We have Mellinkoff's definition of what they are now
at Stanford. Here is Pearl Buck's description of them
in mature womanhood; "Spoiled, petty, restless, idle,
they are our nation's greatest unused resource—good
brains going to waste in bridge and movies and lectures
and dull gossip, instead of constructively applied to
the nation's need of them."
Before it is too late, our women at Stanford should
turn their attention and initiative away from the idea
of "marriage competition." Our country is full of things
in vital need of the understanding and ability of
women—especially college graduates. They should find
their capabilities and plan and prepare while they still
have the opportunity and inspiration of an education.
Above all they should remember the message of Pearl
Buck, that: "Work is the one supreme privilege which
too many women in America with all their extraordi
nary unearned privileges never know. And yet it is
the one privilege which will make them free."
Sincerely yours,

A University paper should have something of the
University spirit: it should have no editorial policy
but the quest of many-sided truth. The Daily offers at
present very able and very virulent propaganda: I use
the word without sinister implication, merely as a
synonym for partisanship. It presents the side of the
Isolationist - Pro-Nazi - Pacifist coalition. It would be
interesting to have, once in a while, a few words in
favor of world democracy, organized peace, and a
