"POLAND, KEY TO EUROPE,"
by Raymond Leslie Bucll; Alfred
Knopf, 1939. On sale at the Stan
ford Bookstore.

Poland's rise as one of the great
powers of Europe during the later
Middle Ages, its partition and disap
pearance in the 18th century, its res
urrection at the end of the first
World War, and its engulfment by
German and Russian legions in
World War Number Two constitute
one of the strangest chapters of his
tory.
The opportunity to tell this tale
faithfully and readably has fallen to
Mr. Buell, who visited Poland in
1938 to write only a report for the
Foreign Policy Association and
ended by vyiting a 370-page discus
sion of "the fifth nation of Europe."
TRUCE VIOLATED
Poland, like so many countries,
has been confronted by two major
problems — security against foreign
aggression and security against in
ternal want. Until the Nazis me
chanically altered the death rate,
Poland had the most rapidly in
creasing population in Europe, yet
lacked the x - esources to insure a de
cent living'on the basis of self-suf
ficiency. At least a quarter of its
people, under normal peace-time
conditions, were living close to
starvation.
In 1934 Hitler signed a ten-year
truce with Poland which led some
Poles optimistically to believe that
Germany had abandoned the tradi
tion of the Teutonic Knights. They
found out. Buell analyzes the situa
tion quickly and brilliantly. "If
Hitler is to realize his ambition of
dominating Europe, he must reduce
Poland to a position of dependence
or wipe it out altogether. Germany
cannot be free to dominate Central
Europe so long as a strong military
power exists on its eastern border."
PROPHECY REALIZED
Buell explains, too, that "Poland
would be as vitally involved over
the conclusion of an alliance between
the two great totalitarian powers as
in a Russian-German war. Indeed,
it is not difficult to believe that an
alliance would be followed by a new
partition of Poland." All the world
knows how true these words have
become.
For a brilliant, informative study
of the nation that rocks on the racial
balance between German and Slav,
that stands (or rather stood) be
tween the two great imperialistic,
totalitarian powers. Buell's "Poland"
fills the bill.—Hutchinson

TRUCE VIOLATED
Poland, like so many countries,
has been confronted by two major
problems — security against foreign
aggression and security against in
ternal want. Until the Nazis me
chanically altered the death rate,
Poland had the most rapidly in
creasing population in Europe, yet
lacked the x - esources to insure a de
cent living'on the basis of self-suf
ficiency. At least a quarter of its
people, under normal peace-time
conditions, were living close to
starvation.
In 1934 Hitler signed a ten-year
truce with Poland which led some
Poles optimistically to believe that
Germany had abandoned the tradi
tion of the Teutonic Knights. They
found out. Buell analyzes the situa
tion quickly and brilliantly. "If
Hitler is to realize his ambition of
dominating Europe, he must reduce
Poland to a position of dependence
or wipe it out altogether. Germany
cannot be free to dominate Central
Europe so long as a strong military
power exists on its eastern border."
PROPHECY REALIZED
Buell explains, too, that "Poland
would be as vitally involved over
the conclusion of an alliance between
the two great totalitarian powers as
in a Russian-German war. Indeed,
it is not difficult to believe that an
alliance would be followed by a new
partition of Poland." All the world
knows how true these words have
become.
For a brilliant, informative study
of the nation that rocks on the racial
balance between German and Slav,
that stands (or rather stood) be
tween the two great imperialistic,
totalitarian powers. Buell's "Poland"
fills the bill.—Hutchinson

Poland's rise as one of the great
powers of Europe during the later
Middle Ages, its partition and disap
pearance in the 18th century, its res
urrection at the end of the first
World War, and its engulfment by
German and Russian legions in
World War Number Two constitute
one of the strangest chapters of his
tory.
The opportunity to tell this tale
faithfully and readably has fallen to
Mr. Buell, who visited Poland in
1938 to write only a report for the
