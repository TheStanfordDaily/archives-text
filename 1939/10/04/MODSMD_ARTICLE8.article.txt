## University Avenue Railroad Underpass To Be Constructed 
### 
Authorization to sign the con
struction contract for the University
Avenue railroad underpass was ap
proved by the Palo Alto City Coun
cil at an extraordinary session last
Monday night.
Work on the project is expected to
begin the last part of November, ac
cording to City Engineer J. F. Byx
bee.
Tentative plans for the develop
ment include moving the tracks
about 80 feet west of their present
position and raising them 5 feet.
The underpass is to have four ve
hicular lanes, each 12V2 feet wide,
with a 6-foot separation strip in the
middle.
• A road 45 feet wide is to be con
structed over Alma Street, and
"clover leaf" roadways, 22 feet wide
with separating islands, will connect
Alma Street with the subway below.
Parking areas are planned and Alma
Street will be widened between
Hamilton and Lytton Avenues.
For the development $300,000 has
been allocated, and this sum is now
being held by the Bureau of Public
Roads. The Southern Pacific Com
pany is preparing to spend more
than $100,000 on the construction of
a new station, and telephone cables
have already been rerouted at a cost
of approximately $75,000. Including
the incidental costs, which will fall
on the city of Palo Alto, the whole
venture is expected to create an ex
penditure of over $500,000.
Funds are not as yet available for
the proposed separation of grades at
University Avenue and the El Ca
mino Real, so this project will prob
ably not be undertaken until after
I the underpass is completed.
