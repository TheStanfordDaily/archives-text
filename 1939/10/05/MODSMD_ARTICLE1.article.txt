### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r PIIE august and distinguished
United States Senate, the trib
une of the people, and leading na
tional men's club, sat in hushed si
lence yesterday as two of its ablest
fighters battled over the Neutrality
Revision Bill to keep America out
of the European war.
The two men who spoke from the
floor agreed on one common point—
that this country will tolerate no ag
gression by foreign powers in the
Western Hemisphere, a modem re
iteration of an old policy that we
learned in our high school civics
classes.
♦ * *
The foemen were Senator Ar
thur H. Vandenberg of Michigan,
candidate for the 1940 Republican
presidential nomination, and Sen.
Tom Connally of Texas, member of
the foreign relations committee, co
author of the pending measure and
one of democracy's "elder states
men."
Republican Sen. Tobey of New
Hampshire thought he would expe
dite matters by urging that the bill
be recommitted to the foreign rela
tions committee with instructions to
separate the arms embargo provi
sion from the other protective de
vices.
$ * >|t
I jNDER the proposal, the credit
and-carry plan and other
safeguards would be considered
first and the embargo immediately
afterward. Naturally en. Tobey's
suggestion met with slightly less
approval than he anticipated. The
Administration forces were mar
shalled into immediate action to
over-ride the idea, believing that
it would seriously imperil the ma
jority which the President claims
now favors embargo repeal.
$ * *
Sen. Tobey, on the other hand, in
sisted that long debate over the em
bargo issue would ont be allowed to
delay enactment of legislation aimed
at conditions which "threaten to take
us into this new war." However, he
agreed to a suggestion by Senate
Majority Leader Alben Barkley to
delay a vote on his motion until
Monday.
Barkley told reporters later that
the Tobey motion probably would
l»e tabled. He claimed sufficient
support to sidetrack it. though lie
said he did not regard this vote as
the first test on the measure. It
will be, nevertheless, a fairly sig
nificant expression of Senatorial
opinion.
« * * 9
Barkley indicated that voting on
the actual amendments probably
would begin next week. Party lead
ers think that it may well require
an additional two weeks to get any
final vote.
# * *
ISOLATIONISTS were relinquish
ing no ground in the second day
of the fight, for Sen. Bennett Clark,
Democrat of Missouri, offered an
amendment which would place two
senators and two congressmen on
the highly important key committee,
the Munitions Control Board, cre
ated under the current neutrality
measure and slated for retention in
the new bill. The board is com
posed now of the Secretaries of
State, War, Navy, Treasury, and
Commerce.
No new arguments were intro
duced in the see-saw battle. Both
Vandenberg and Connally follow
ed the general line of arguments
fixed by spokesmen for the op
posing contingcnst in radio talks,
public speeches, and newspaper
statements. They both seem to
agree that repeal of the import
ant arms embargo is the crux of
the fight.
Masquerading behind the whole
Senatorial surface is the obvious de
sire of the Administration and a
substantial slice of the voting public
to aid the Allied cause, at least by
vital war supplies, food, and signifi
cant. moral backing. In the last two
weeks nearly everyone has discarded
the belief that the United States,
should it alter the Neutrality Act,
will, in reality, be anywhere near
neutral.
