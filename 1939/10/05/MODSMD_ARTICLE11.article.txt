# Cards Hit Oregon Trail; Farm to Give Gridmen Rally Send-off at Train
## Webfoot Game Offers Indians Come-back Trial 
### 
Tiny Thornhill will have a 35-man j
squad with him when he leaves for
Portland this afternoon to try and ;
put the Indian on the come-back j
trail.
Hugh Gallarneau and Jim Groves !
were out for practice last night for
the first time this week. Gallarneau,
who was out of last week's game
with an infected toe, said that he
was feeling fine and hoped to play
a lot of ball against the Oregon Web
leet Saturday.
Jim Groves took a bad physical
beating against Lon Stiner's Orange
men in the stadium, but, aided by a
few dozen yards of adhesive, ex
pects to see action in Portland.
ALBERT MAY START
Frankie Albert is carrying around
a bad charley-horse on his left leg,
but should be in shape to start Sat
urday.
Bill Willard and Dean Burford,
both on the injured list, will be left
behind to recuperate. Just, how bad
ly Willard's knee is banged up is
still not known. When he fell
warming up on the stadium turf, he
tore loose the lateral ligaments, but
whether or not the cartilage is in
jured cannot, yet be determined. If
it is, Willard will be through for the
year.
No starting line-up has been re
leased yet, but it's a good bet that
the same eleven will start that took
the field against the Ducks' cousins
from Corvallis, with the possible ex
ception of Bill Trout, who may lose
the tackle assignment to Swede
Johansen.
LISTS LINE-UPS
This team would have a line of
Andy Stojkovich and Stan Graff at
ends, Stan Andersen pairing with
Johansen at tackle, Hamp Pool and
Corky Donahue at guards and Jim
Verdiek at center.
The starting backfield would be
Frankie Albert at left half, Norm
Standlee at full, Gene Coldiron at
quarter, and Jim Groves at right
half.
Thornhill plans a more diversified
attack and a more aggressive type
of defensive line-play for Saturday's
game. Husky Hunt watched the
Webfeet in action when they ground
out a 7-7 tic against Southern Cali
fornia last, week, and brought back
some information on how they did it.
GRAYBEAL THREATENS
Big guns in the Oregon attack will
be Jay Graybeal, Buck Berry, and
Walt Emmons. Graybeal burned up
coast gridirons two years ago, but
was injured before the start of the
season last fall and stayed out to
preserve his last year of eligibility.
Emmons is a 215-pound line-crack
ing fullback who gave the Trojan
forward wall a lot to worry about.
Buck Berry is the newest edition
to Oliver's gridders, having trans- j
ferred from Compton Junior College I
this fall.
The men who will leave from the
Palo Alto station at 2:30 o'clock
follow.
