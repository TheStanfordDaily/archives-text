Sunday, they were not reported un

"Just looking for a friend," was
the explanation given questioning
fraternity men by the suspect be
lieved to have perpetrated all three
crimes, who had not yet been ap
prehended yesterday evening.
In a communication drafted yes

ternity houses to "be as careful
about admitting persons to the resi
dences as they would be in a private
home," and to confer with the con
troller's office on further steps.
Believed by police to have come
on the campus with the week-end's
transient football fans, the suspect
had more than 48 hours' head start
on authorities, who have been pro
vided with an excellent description
of the perpetrator. Stanford police

campaign to prevent the further
burglarizing of campus fraternities
has been launched.
