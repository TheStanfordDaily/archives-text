# Dr. Stuart Recommends Cash-and-Carry Policy
## Political Science Expert Blames Past U.S. Wars on Neutrality Laws 
### 
Crowded out of the West Memorial Library by unexpectedly heavy
attendance, the International Relations Club yesterday heard Dr. Graham
Stuart, political science professor, speak on "Can America Remain Neu
tral?" in one of, the larger classrooms. Spectators and participants in the j
discussion still crowded into the open door and peered through windows

from outside for the duration of the,
gathering.
Dr. Stuart opined that all-inclu
sive, rigid neutrality legislation of
any sort is not the means to keep
out of war, adding that efforts to
protect our neutral interests have
been at least partially responsible in
the past for our having been drawn
into war. He cited as examples the
War of 1812, the World War, and an
undeclared war with France in
1798.
STUART ILLUSTRATES
Illustrating that it is not always
possible to foresee effects of so
called neutrality legislation, he ex
plained that under recent acts cur
tailing arms shipment to Spain, in
surgents merely resorted to Germany
for supplies.
Belligerents are bound to obtain
war materials from one source or
another, Dr. Stuart feels, and it
might be safer for America all the
w;iy around if combatants call for
goods in their own ships on a cash
and carry basis than if American
.ships take oil and other materials
(as they can under the present act)
to warring nations on the basis of
deferred payment. The shipping of
lumber from San Francisco to Van
couver is illegal under present laws,
he added.
RECOMMENDS FLEXIBILITY
Recommending a flexible law giv
ing the president a certain amount
of discretion, Dr. Stuart concluded
that with the chief executive's pow
er to send battleships to any point
he desires, he possesses the ability

to plunge the nation into war in any j
case if he deems it necessary. Real
desire on the part of the whole na- j
tion to stay out of war is more im
portant than any amount of legisla- '
tion, he claimed.
Since future meetings of the In- 1
ternational Relations Club are to be i
by invitation only, those interested,
in joining should contact Julius j
Leetham, Irvin Marlar, or John
O'Neill, members of the present
executive committee, or leave names
and phone numbers at the political I
science department office.
