# Proposal for Inexpensive Big Game Night Offered At Cardinals Meeting
## Ken Cuthbertson Advances Plan For Big-name, Off-campus Dance At Approximately $5 Per Couple 
### 
(See page 4 for editorial comment.)
A plan for Stanford students to celebrate Big Game Night in an inex
pensive, yet completely satisfying way was proposed last night at Cardi
nals' meeting hy A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthhertson.
The idea, originally suggested by Daily Editor Larry Livingston, in
cludes a dance at a well-known Peninsula country club with the music

of a big-name orchestra at a charged
of approximately five dollars a
couple.
STUDENT REQUEST
"The students have been asking
for an inexpensive way to celebrate
Big Game Night for a long time,"
said Cuthbertson, "so the idea should
be popular." Ken Koch, Cardinals
chairman, expressed the willingness
of that group to canvass student
opinion and appointed Ned Pugh to
contact fraternities, eating clubs, and
halls to see how many men would
attend the dance. '
"Plans are still indefinite for the
celebration," said Koch, "but we will
need at least 200 couples to give the
right kind of a dance with either
a supper or breakfast served during
the evening. An off-campus dance
has been proposed because campus
affairs must close at 12 o'clock on
Saturday night."
NOT YET APPROVED
Although the plan has not yet been
approved by the Administration, last
year Dean Mary Yost and Dean
John Bunn were in favor of a dance
to celebrate the Cal game. Since
the game was at Berkeley the idea
was dropped.
"It is up to the students," Cuth
bertson stated, "whether they want
to celebrate that night at an inex
pensive but enjoyable dance or
spend a lot of money and drive
twice as far."
If the plan is endorsed by the
students, Cardinals and the A.S.S.U.
will co-operate to sponsor the dance
without profit, according to Koch
and Cuthbertson.
