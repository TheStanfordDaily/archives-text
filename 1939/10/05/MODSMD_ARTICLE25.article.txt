# Ninth Inning Score Gives Yankees Slim 2-1 Victory
## Bill Dickey's Single Wins First Came Ruffing, Derringer Hold Close Pitching Duel in Series Opener 
### 
YANKEE STADIUM. New York,
Oct. 4 (UP). —A lashing single off
the bat of big Bill Dickey in the
ninth inning enabled the New York
Yankees to defeat the Cincinnati
Reels, 2 to 1, today in the opening
contest of the 1939 World Series.
As Dickey's hit went screaming
into center field, scoring Charlie
Keller with the winning run, fate
snatched a glorious game from Paul
Derringer, Cincinnati right hander,
who had pitched brilliant, coura
geous baseball.
DERRINGER HOLDS YANKS
The game was without an error.
Inning after inning, Derringer's
big right arm rose and fell, sweeping
a curve across the plate that held in
check all the power in the Yankee
lineup.
But, matching him pitch for pitch,
was Rui'us the Red Ruffing, ace of
the Yankee staff, who stepped out
on the mound with a sore arm and
pitched a four-hit game.
Attendance was 58,541. Official
figures gave receipts at $219,041, with
the players' share $111,801.91, com
missioners' share $32,856.15, and
$74,473.94 left to the clubs.
YANKS ARE HOT
It might have been a different
story on this gloomy, chilly after
noon if the Yankee infield had not
played brilliant baseball behind
Ruffing. Time after time the double
play twins, Joe Gordon and Frankie
Crosetti, cut down rallies by the
Reds with fast, sparkling fielding.
The Reds were held in check by
Ruffing until the fourth inning.
GOODMAN WALKS
Ival Goodman walked on four
straight pitches and a sigh rippled
through the stands. Everybody
thought Ruffing's sore arm had
caught up with him at last and
robbed him of his control. Goodman
took a long lead off first, dancing
lightly along the base path, and
broke for second with the pitch.
Bill Dickey's right arm flashed
back and the ball went for second, 1
straight as a string. But it was too
low and Gordon barely was able to
stop it.
Goodman slid safely into second
and great cheers went up behind the
Reds' bench.
Frank McCormick, a brilliant ball
player on both offense and defense
this afternoon, then hit a single that
went past Red Rolfe at third base
like a rocket on the loose. Goodman
was off with the bang of the bat and
raced home with the first run of the
game.
The Yankees came back to tie it
up in the fifth.
Joe Gordon rammed a single past
third base, and up to the plate came
Babe Dahlgren, as near to being a
weak sister at the plate as the Yan
kees have.
He hit one down the left-field foul
line for a double and scored after
one of the neatest demonstrations of
base running ever seen in this or
any other ball park.
After that both pitchers settled
down and it was a great duel until
the ninth.
KELLER HITS TRIPLE
But Yankee power cannot be sup
pressed forever and in the ninth with
one out, the magic moment came
for Charlie Keller, a rookie playing
in his first World Series. He kit a
tremendous triple to right center and
the storm of cheers almost deafened
him as he stood on third.
Up at the plate, waving a yellow
bat, was the most dangerous clutch
hitter in baseball—big Bill Dickey.
Derringer threw his leg high in
the air and the ball came sweeping
in. Dickey took his lazy, graceful
cut and the ball shot out for a single,
sending Keller scampering home
with the winning run.

broke for second with the pitch.
Bill Dickey's right arm flashed
back and the ball went for second, 1
straight as a string. But it was too
low and Gordon barely was able to
stop it.
Goodman slid safely into second
and great cheers went up behind the
Reds' bench.
Frank McCormick, a brilliant ball
player on both offense and defense
this afternoon, then hit a single that
went past Red Rolfe at third base
like a rocket on the loose. Goodman
was off with the bang of the bat and
raced home with the first run of the
game.
The Yankees came back to tie it
up in the fifth.
Joe Gordon rammed a single past
third base, and up to the plate came
Babe Dahlgren, as near to being a
weak sister at the plate as the Yan
kees have.
He hit one down the left-field foul
line for a double and scored after
one of the neatest demonstrations of
base running ever seen in this or
any other ball park.
After that both pitchers settled
down and it was a great duel until
the ninth.
KELLER HITS TRIPLE
But Yankee power cannot be sup
pressed forever and in the ninth with
one out, the magic moment came
for Charlie Keller, a rookie playing
in his first World Series. He kit a
tremendous triple to right center and
the storm of cheers almost deafened
him as he stood on third.
Up at the plate, waving a yellow
bat, was the most dangerous clutch
hitter in baseball—big Bill Dickey.
Derringer threw his leg high in
the air and the ball came sweeping
in. Dickey took his lazy, graceful
cut and the ball shot out for a single,
sending Keller scampering home
with the winning run.
YANKEE STADIUM. New York,
Oct. 4 (UP). —A lashing single off
the bat of big Bill Dickey in the
ninth inning enabled the New York
Yankees to defeat the Cincinnati
Reels, 2 to 1, today in the opening
contest of the 1939 World Series.
As Dickey's hit went screaming
into center field, scoring Charlie
Keller with the winning run, fate
snatched a glorious game from Paul
Derringer, Cincinnati right hander,
who had pitched brilliant, coura
geous baseball.
DERRINGER HOLDS YANKS
The game was without an error.
Inning after inning, Derringer's
big right arm rose and fell, sweeping
a curve across the plate that held in
check all the power in the Yankee
lineup.
But, matching him pitch for pitch,
was Rui'us the Red Ruffing, ace of
the Yankee staff, who stepped out
on the mound with a sore arm and
pitched a four-hit game.
Attendance was 58,541. Official
figures gave receipts at $219,041, with
the players' share $111,801.91, com
missioners' share $32,856.15, and
$74,473.94 left to the clubs.
YANKS ARE HOT
It might have been a different
story on this gloomy, chilly after
noon if the Yankee infield had not
played brilliant baseball behind
Ruffing. Time after time the double
play twins, Joe Gordon and Frankie
Crosetti, cut down rallies by the
Reds with fast, sparkling fielding.
The Reds were held in check by
Ruffing until the fourth inning.
GOODMAN WALKS
Ival Goodman walked on four
straight pitches and a sigh rippled
through the stands. Everybody
thought Ruffing's sore arm had
caught up with him at last and

lightly along the base path, and
broke for second with the pitch.
