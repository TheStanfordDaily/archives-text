# Delta Chis Show Strength In First Mural Grid Battle
## 
### 
With Clem Richardson intercept
ing a pass and galloping 70 yards for
the only score of the game, Delta
Chi, defending intramural football
champions, knocked over the first
obstacle in their 1939 mural grid path
yesterday as they defeated Alpha
Sigma Phi, 6-0. Bob Worthington
turned in an outstanding game at
end for the Alpha Sigs in a hard
fought contest.
Another 6-0 score was turned in as
the Legal Eagles took a victory over
Kappa Alpha. Franich scored on an
end run from ten yards out after
Daba had intercepted a KA. pass.
F.l Toro, sparked by the brilliant
passing of Calderwood and Van
Acker, and the fine line play of
Rapp, ran away from Alpha Kappa
Lambda.
Kappa Sigma proved themselves
to be too much for Branner, and |
started their drive toward the chain- (
pionship playoffs with a 27 to 0 vic
tory. All of the Kappa Sig's touch
downs were made on passes.
Kenny Davidson, who is manag
ing football, has asked that as few
postponements as possible be made 1
since action of that kind plays havoc
with the schedule. Also, it be
hooves all teams to be on the field
on time for a team automatically 1
forfeits the game if they are more
than ten minutes late; and two for
feits mean withdrawal from the
league.
