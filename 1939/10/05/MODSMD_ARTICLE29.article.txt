# Papooses Open Aerial Practice For Placer Tilt
## Shipkey Loses Men; Squad Still Looks Good for Saturday 
### 
i Coach Harry Shipkey sent his j
; freshmen footballers through an in- (
• tensive pass scrimmage yesterday in i
I an effort to brush up on the frosh's
[ pitching and catching.
Very improved was the tossing of
I A1 Cole, who will have to take over
J this department of the game during
i Saturday's tilt because of Milt
j Vucinich's injured shoulder. The
! big full bruised his shoulder in the i
j Modesto game and despite the fact
j that he was able to throw a 45-yard |
j touchdown pass immediately after •
! being hurt, the arm has stiffened up ,
so much as to be useless next Sat
urday.
Mixing up short and long throws, 1
I the first string managed to score on |
| a long pitch from the hand of Cole
!to Phil Wolfe. The seconds were \
' kept pretty well hand-cuffed on of
! fense by a hard charging line led by I
! Bruno Banducci. However, the Don
I Selby-to-Bill Symes combination !
I managed to click for a couple of!
. gains over the first-string back- j
field.
Coach Harry Shipkey has had I
several bad breaks lately. First the !
injury to Hank Norberg, best end J
prospect on the squad, which at first j
threatened to keep him out for three
weeks. But now it seems certain
that Norberg will see no more action j
during the 1939 season. Next came |
the news that Pete Yarmoluk, beefy j
center, had decided to leave school, j
The loss through failure to pass the j
aptitude test of Aubrey Coldiron and <
Ralph Bockmier rounds out the list j
of men who have slipped through j
I Shipkey's fingers.
1 There will be more passing in to- j
! moiTow's practice and if the spirit
J of the squad continues to mount they |
! will tear Placer to pieces on Satur- |
day.
