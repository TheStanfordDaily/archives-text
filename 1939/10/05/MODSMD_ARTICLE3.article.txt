# Daily Gets Scoop On Fair Closing
## 
### 
At noon today, five hours after
The Daily had given its readers
the identical and exclusive story,
the rest of the world learned that
the Golden Gate International
Exposition would close its gates on
Oct. 29.
News agencies and metropolitan
papers throughout the country
were quick to flash the sudden an
nouncement to their public, but
the stories were mere repetition to
campus readers. The Daily was
also fully corroborated in predict
ing that the $1,500,000 needed to
extend the fair for another year
had not yet been raised. Late yes
terday afternoon, the United Press
declared that "more moral than
financial" help had been for
warded.
Decreasing attendance and pros
pects for wet and unattractive
weather during November were
two reasons given by Exposition
President Lcland Cutler for the
new closing date.
