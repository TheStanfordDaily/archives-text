### JERRY MAYER 
STANFORD FOR YOU—
BUT NOT FOR ME
Six either present or former Stan
ford football players have athletic
brothers either playing or headed for
other universities on the Coast. John
Tsoiitsouvas, who played a great
game at center for Oregon State
against Stanford last Saturday, is the
brother of Louis Tsoutsouvas, former
Card pivotman and present assistant
frosh coach.
Corky Donahue's brother, Ralph
is playing fine ball at quarter
back for Loyola at Los Angeles,
while Bernie Matthews, kin of
former Indian guard Bob Mat
thews. is beaded for the same
school. The younger Matthews is
reputed a great backfield prospect
off bis junior college record.
Bob Templeton, third-string In
dian quarter, has a brother playing
first string at Redlands University,
while starring in the Santa Clara
backfield is the brother of Leo
Ferko, another former Card guard.
Colin McClintoek, second-string
center, has a brother who coinci
dentally is second-string pivotman
at Washington.
STANFORD'S MYSTERY MAN
IT'S OLD MAYFIELI) IKE
Stanford can't possibly lose to
Oregon Saturday. It's in the bag,
an out-and-out lead-pipe cinch.
Take it from such an exalted au
thority as "Mayfield Ike."
"Oregon ain't no good," says Ike
through his sparse set of tobacco
colored teeth. "Dey didn't even
beat U.S.C."
No one knows very much about
old Ike. He's rumored to live in
an old shack somewhere around
Mayfield, but no one seems cer
tain about it. Rut Ike has been
coming around to Stanford prac
tice sessions as long as anyone
around here can remember.
Dressed in dirty dungarees, a
shabby brown coat, and a some
what worse-for-wear felt hat,
Mayfield Ike lounges along the
sidelines, gabbing with the play
ers, or standing by himself study
ing the situation.
He claims that he is one of Stan
ford's chief scouts, but. if you let
old Ike talk long enough, you will
be startled to discover that he may
have scouted three games in one

day that are as far removed as Los
Angeles, Berkeley, and Seattle.
Ike has probably secured more
good football players for Stanford
than any single person. One of his
finest proteges is Hank Norberg,
220-pound frosh end. although
May field Ike claims he made sev
eral hurried trips to Okmulgee,
Oklahoma, to land Jim Reynolds
for the Vowing Sophs' outfit.
Ike admits that story that one day
"Monk" Moscrip and Keith Topping,
ends on the Vowing Sophs, threw
him over the fence surrounding the
practice field.
"Naw," Mayfield Ike disclaims,
"didn't hurt me a-tall."
PICKING AT THE LOOSE
ENDS HERE AND THERE
A letter I got from the sports edi
tor of the Oregon Emerald picked
U.S.C. to finish first in the confer
ence and Oregon to end up in sixth
place. That was before the Web
foots' tie with the Trojans. Wonder
what the Oregonian thinks now . . .
When Stanford runs up against
Jack Robinson, the halfback sensa
tion at U.C.L.A., at least one of the
Indians will have had some expe
rience in trying to stop the capering
negro. Jim Verdieck, who trans
ferred here from San Bernardino
J. C.. played against Robinson's
Pasadena J. C. outfit. "He's as good
as he's cracked up to be," says Jim
... In case you're interested, the
roster of major sport senior man
agers this year reads as follows:
football. George McCoy; basketball.
Art McDermid; track, Frank Walt;
baseball, Bert Rosenfeld; tennis,
Rob Putnam .

STANFORD'S MYSTERY MAN
IT'S OLD MAYFIELI) IKE
Stanford can't possibly lose to
Oregon Saturday. It's in the bag,
an out-and-out lead-pipe cinch.
Take it from such an exalted au
thority as "Mayfield Ike."
"Oregon ain't no good," says Ike
through his sparse set of tobacco
colored teeth. "Dey didn't even
beat U.S.C."
No one knows very much about
old Ike. He's rumored to live in
an old shack somewhere around
Mayfield, but no one seems cer
tain about it. Rut Ike has been
coming around to Stanford prac
tice sessions as long as anyone
around here can remember.
Dressed in dirty dungarees, a
shabby brown coat, and a some
what worse-for-wear felt hat,
Mayfield Ike lounges along the
sidelines, gabbing with the play
ers, or standing by himself study
ing the situation.
He claims that he is one of Stan
ford's chief scouts, but. if you let
old Ike talk long enough, you will
be startled to discover that he may
have scouted three games in one

day that are as far removed as Los
Angeles, Berkeley, and Seattle.
Ike has probably secured more
good football players for Stanford
than any single person. One of his
finest proteges is Hank Norberg,
220-pound frosh end. although
May field Ike claims he made sev
eral hurried trips to Okmulgee,
Oklahoma, to land Jim Reynolds
for the Vowing Sophs' outfit.
Ike admits that story that one day
"Monk" Moscrip and Keith Topping,
ends on the Vowing Sophs, threw
him over the fence surrounding the
practice field.
"Naw," Mayfield Ike disclaims,
"didn't hurt me a-tall."
PICKING AT THE LOOSE

A letter I got from the sports edi
tor of the Oregon Emerald picked
U.S.C. to finish first in the confer
ence and Oregon to end up in sixth
place. That was before the Web
foots' tie with the Trojans. Wonder
what the Oregonian thinks now . . .
When Stanford runs up against
Jack Robinson, the halfback sensa
tion at U.C.L.A., at least one of the
Indians will have had some expe
rience in trying to stop the capering
negro. Jim Verdieck, who trans
ferred here from San Bernardino
J. C.. played against Robinson's
Pasadena J. C. outfit. "He's as good
as he's cracked up to be," says Jim
... In case you're interested, the
roster of major sport senior man
agers this year reads as follows:
football. George McCoy; basketball.
Art McDermid; track, Frank Walt;
baseball, Bert Rosenfeld; tennis,
Rob Putnam .
