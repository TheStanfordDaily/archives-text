# Waterdogs Seek Spartan Scalp
## Bleecker, Nottage Set To Start in Opener 
### 
Stanford's opening water polo
game of the season against San
Jose is slated to meet the public eyp
at 4:30 o'clock this afternoon in En
cina pool.
Coach Nort Thornton, who be
lieves he has solved the problem of
the missing forward, will shoot his
men at the same Spartan outfit
which the Cardinals licked twice 1
last year, 7 to 4 and 6 to 3. But that
should be an improved seven, be
cause of experience gained by the
Joseans since that 1938 meeting.
Final practice for the contest
yesterday was interrupted by an
Interfraternity Council meeting
which claimed key players. But the
improved performances of Bill
Bleeeker and Dave Nottage, slated
for the forward posts, continued,
much to the delight of Coach Thorn
ton.
If the pair works as well in actual
water battle, Coach Thornton should
have a complete all-star outfit, so to
speak. However, reports from the
University of California, both at
Berkeley and Los Angeles, and the :
University of Southern California '
tend to neutralize "Stanford's i
strongest." All schools boast of
"best teams" ever, without excep
tion.
Stanford's starting line-up tomor
row will put the following seven ;
into the nippy, blue Encina waters: .
Captain Bob Plate, sprint; Nottage ,
and Bleeeker, forwards; Bob Allen,
centerback; Dick Hoover and Ted i
Moreno, guards; and Frank Dowling. |
At last reports, Hadley Bacon, sub
all-arounder, and Bill Burns, goalie ■
out with a cold, are near the come
back list.
