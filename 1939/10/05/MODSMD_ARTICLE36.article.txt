# In Dubious Battle

### 
FOR several years the Administration has
been following an indefinitely stated, though
definitely formulated, policy of encouraging
students to seek their entertainment on the
Farm.
Nothing in the University regulations or their
interpretation possibly can be construed as
encouraging evenings in the City or week-ends
at Del Monte. And yet, although the necessity
of social activities is recognized, few satisfac
tory substitutes have been offered.
If the Administration wants to encourage the
student body to stay close to home, it must
offer amusements that can compete with out
side glamour-spots.
The most obvious blank on the Stanford social
calendar is Big Game Night, the night when
the entire campus wants to celebrate, when
3:30 late leaves are grantedâ€”and there really
is no place to go. Even those few students
who can afford Del Monte universally condemn
it as not worth the expense. San Francisco
hotels triple their prices and are as crowded
and airless as the Black Hole of Calcutta.
And Stanford offers no alternative.
Campus dances are ruled out by the Uni
versity regulation requiring them to end at
midnight on Saturdays. And yet, the idea of
an off-campus Stanford dance never had been
considered until it was presented to Cardinals
last night.
With the approval of the Administration, the
A.S.S.U. could sponsor a dance at one of the
many appropriate country clubs on the Penin
sula. A big-name orchestra, a $5-per-couple
charge for a table, an early-morning breakfast,
and a crowd of Stanford students would be the
sole components necessary for complete suc
cess.
At less than one-third of the cost of a date in
the City, at less than one-fifth the cost of a
week-end at Del Monte, Stanford could have its
own dance, complete with good music and
beautiful surroundings.
And for the first time in history Big Game
Night would not be a disappointment.
