# High-Pressure Send-Off
## 
### 
PROMOTION is a great thing.
A little natural comeliness, and a lot of
publicity, made Hollywood's Oomph-girl.
A concerted advertising campaign is even
now reverting a million women to the dark
ages of tightly-laced wasp waists.
And a sample of mass production will be
carried on this afternoon which will, if any
thing can, promote a Card victory over Ore
gon's webfooted squad this Saturday.
Today the Big Red Machine and Tiny Thorn
hill will pull out of Paly's S.P. station to travel
some 700 miles to Portland. There, far from
home support, they will take on the University
of Oregon in an attempt to administer ven
geance for last Saturday's defeat.
And they will be expected to do that with
out much support from the stands—they may
even be in for some comments from the oppo
sition, with no one there to answer for them.
So the only thing to do is to answer for them
now. Answer for them, and boost them on their
northern excursion with a send-off big enough
to last until they get home.
A Card victory this Saturday will have to be
promoted today. It will have to be a promotion
so big that the squad will not forget it before
the gun bangs on an expected victory.—J. B.
