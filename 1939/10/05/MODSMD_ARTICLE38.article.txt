LAST year, when Ex Committee decided to
present the University with a new Boat
house, it placed a $10,000 burden on the shoul
ders of the Associated Students. At that time
the problem of paying for the lake-side pleas
ure-dome tactfully was hushed-up with prom
ises of income from a Boathouse drive, reg
dances, and other remunerative projects.
Today the Boathouse stands lonely and de
serted, staring into the empty-lake—but it is
a happy sight compared with the mournful look
of the Student Manager as he contemplates the
unpaid debt of the A.S.S.U.
The first of the projected methods of reim
bursement, a drive for funds, was discarded
early in the game. With the Convalescent Home
Drive and spring quarter dances already drain
ing the students' pocket-books. Ex Committee
decided against an appeal for cash, in favor of
a non-profit opening celebration.
The second source of income was lost, at
least temporarily, when the year's most profi

table reg dance was granted to Scabbard and
Blade so that it might pay off the huge debt
that resulted from its winter quarter social
fiasco. The next registration dance probably
will be run by the A.S.S.U. —unless some de
serving organization that owes it money comes
along in the meantime.
Of the "other projects" that were supposed to
help pay for the Boathouse, the only one real
ized was the nickel phonograph in the Union
Cellar, which produced hard, cold cash at the
rate of $15 a week, after the owner's cut had
been deducted.
Complaints of bewildered student hashers
and faculty members, who charged that jive
was responsible for their indigestion, led to
the rule silencing the phonograph at meal
hours. And the school-teacher population of
Stanford's summer quarter successfully in
sisted that it be removed altogether.
Today the dreary, silent Cellar is longing
for the return of Benny Goodman, the Boathouse
still is unpaid for, and the pockets of the Asso
ciated Students are almost empty.
The Union Board of Governors has on hand
dozens of letters complaining about the ma
chine—and not a single demand for its return.
(They may be filed at the A.S.S.U. office.)
