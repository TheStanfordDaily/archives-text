# BULL SESSION

### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
{ \N THE northeast corner of the Inner Quad, where
the Philosophy Department holds sway, some of
you may have noticed from time to time little groups
of students surrounding a square-built man with more
energy than he can get rid of by talking. If you have
noticed one of those between-classes sidewalk-discus
sions, you probably saw students and professor laugh
ing and conversing vigorously—and you guessed wrong.
The students were not apple-polishing.
Dr. Reid is not a man who invites soft-soap, be
cause he never hands any out. When you first come
into his class, he impresses you as a mild-mannered,
sensitive professor, with eyes that are somehow more
embattled than his voice. He will talk along quietly,
interestingly—undermining with undressed logic the
baroque fallacies in Descartes or in common belief.
Then suddenly—it scares you the first time —he will
lean forward with an intent, defiant expression, glare
at the class, and make a sarcastically truthful, but very
funny, criticism of almost anything that is relevant —
human ignorance, war, or the absurdities in Bishop
Berkeley. The class will laugh; he won't. He will
throw his head back and give the Reid-roar. You get
to like Reid-roar. It is a signal outburst of buoyant
defiance —against all that is stuffy, anti-social, or just
plain word-trash. "Verbage,'" Dr. Reid calls it.
* * * *
the middle of the quarter you have got
ten the feeling that Reid is more than a sharp
wit and a clear thinker. You realize that he is nerv
ously sympathetic with humanity, that his skeptically
logical philosophy is only part of his attitude. The
rest is a keen sense of the world's injustices and a
desire, half-shaded with pessimism, to see a more civ
ilized and reasonable society.
And yet, behind these rich contributions to his stu
dents, he sometimes feels that he is "wasting his time."
He once planned to be a medical doctor, and every
once in a while he feels the urge to be in the flux of
life beyond the University. He wants to be doing con
structive, scientific things—in a practical, struggling
world. "But I guess I'm stuck," he will say, "a phi
losophy professor."
* * * *
But if Doctor Reid thinks he has no influence on
the practical world, he is wrong. His unimpeachable
logic has, for once, led him astray. Every student that
hears and is inspired by his lectures gets some of the
rebelliousness, some of the logic, some of the humani
tarianism to take with him. College minds aren't
closed yet, and Reid gives them things with which to
fight off prejudice a little longer. And some of the
minds open, or at least open wider, in a couple of those
little rooms in the Philosophy Department. That, it
seems to me, is as important a function of real educa
tion as can be found from the Chemistry Building to
the Lake.
Dr. Reid won't like this; it isn't skeptical enough.
But what can he expect after only one course?

ten the feeling that Reid is more than a sharp
wit and a clear thinker. You realize that he is nerv
ously sympathetic with humanity, that his skeptically
logical philosophy is only part of his attitude. The
rest is a keen sense of the world's injustices and a
desire, half-shaded with pessimism, to see a more civ
ilized and reasonable society.
And yet, behind these rich contributions to his stu
dents, he sometimes feels that he is "wasting his time."
He once planned to be a medical doctor, and every
once in a while he feels the urge to be in the flux of
life beyond the University. He wants to be doing con
structive, scientific things—in a practical, struggling
world. "But I guess I'm stuck," he will say, "a phi
losophy professor."
* * * *
But if Doctor Reid thinks he has no influence on
the practical world, he is wrong. His unimpeachable
logic has, for once, led him astray. Every student that
hears and is inspired by his lectures gets some of the
rebelliousness, some of the logic, some of the humani
tarianism to take with him. College minds aren't
closed yet, and Reid gives them things with which to
fight off prejudice a little longer. And some of the
minds open, or at least open wider, in a couple of those
little rooms in the Philosophy Department. That, it
seems to me, is as important a function of real educa
tion as can be found from the Chemistry Building to
the Lake.
Dr. Reid won't like this; it isn't skeptical enough.
But what can he expect after only one course?
BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD
{ \N THE northeast corner of the Inner Quad, where
the Philosophy Department holds sway, some of
you may have noticed from time to time little groups
of students surrounding a square-built man with more
energy than he can get rid of by talking. If you have
noticed one of those between-classes sidewalk-discus
sions, you probably saw students and professor laugh
ing and conversing vigorously—and you guessed wrong.
The students were not apple-polishing.
Dr. Reid is not a man who invites soft-soap, be
cause he never hands any out. When you first come
into his class, he impresses you as a mild-mannered,
sensitive professor, with eyes that are somehow more
embattled than his voice. He will talk along quietly,
interestingly—undermining with undressed logic the
baroque fallacies in Descartes or in common belief.
Then suddenly—it scares you the first time —he will
lean forward with an intent, defiant expression, glare
at the class, and make a sarcastically truthful, but very
funny, criticism of almost anything that is relevant —
human ignorance, war, or the absurdities in Bishop
Berkeley. The class will laugh; he won't. He will
throw his head back and give the Reid-roar. You get
to like Reid-roar. It is a signal outburst of buoyant
defiance —against all that is stuffy, anti-social, or just
plain word-trash. "Verbage,'" Dr. Reid calls it.
