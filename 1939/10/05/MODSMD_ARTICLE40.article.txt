## ORGANIZE FOR PEACE 
### 
HPHE EDITOR. SIR:
It seems to me that now is the time for the col
lege students of America to unite in an effort to keep
the United States from war. In my opinion, an ex
pression toward this end would greatly influence the
officials at Washington if it. were endorsed by the
various colleges and universities throughout the
country. I would suggest, therefore, that such an en
dorsement for peace take rise in Stanford and spread to
other universities by means of the various university
peace societies, or by contacting the offices of the Asso
ciated Students . . .
In my mind, America's best policy would be to let
the nations of Europe go to it if they want to, but
keep cle«r of it. When it is all over, victor and van
quished will be ruined economically and morally, and
not even Hitler will be able to attack our sacred shores,
as some propagandists would have us believe is his
intention.
I adhere firmly to Professor Bailey's famous adage,
"European distresses are America's successes," and I
think it will work here. Certainly at the conclusion of
as devastating and bloody a war as this one promises
to be, no nation will have the moral or financial
strength to attempt to destroy our democracy.
Strengthen it at home, I say, while Europe bleeds her
self to death and the result will be a stronger and
greater U. S. than if we enter and win the war for
the allies.
Now is the time for the Stanford Peace Society to
act. We have had speakers and war protests before,
but right now we need unified action, and I feel that
it can be obtained. Certainly the war polls taken at
various universities show that college men, the first
of the cannon fodder to go over, don't want war, and
I believe we can gain nation-wide co-operation. It
may sound like a big job, but when the machinery is
set in motion we will roll along to peace and security.
Now is the time for us to use the knowledge ,ve
have acquired in the course of education. We are sup
posed to be above the masses. Are we, then, to be
led along with them to be slaughtered without a pro
test? Are we to see our own national economy and per
haps our democracy ruined by the after-effects of a
great war? Let us, who are educated, co-operate na
tionally to prevent such horror.

Now is the time for us to use the knowledge ,ve
have acquired in the course of education. We are sup
posed to be above the masses. Are we, then, to be
led along with them to be slaughtered without a pro
test? Are we to see our own national economy and per
haps our democracy ruined by the after-effects of a
great war? Let us, who are educated, co-operate na
tionally to prevent such horror.

It seems to me that now is the time for the col
lege students of America to unite in an effort to keep
the United States from war. In my opinion, an ex
pression toward this end would greatly influence the
officials at Washington if it. were endorsed by the
various colleges and universities throughout the
country. I would suggest, therefore, that such an en
dorsement for peace take rise in Stanford and spread to
other universities by means of the various university
peace societies, or by contacting the offices of the Asso
ciated Students . . .
In my mind, America's best policy would be to let
the nations of Europe go to it if they want to, but
keep cle«r of it. When it is all over, victor and van
quished will be ruined economically and morally, and
not even Hitler will be able to attack our sacred shores,
as some propagandists would have us believe is his
intention.
I adhere firmly to Professor Bailey's famous adage,
"European distresses are America's successes," and I
think it will work here. Certainly at the conclusion of
as devastating and bloody a war as this one promises
to be, no nation will have the moral or financial
strength to attempt to destroy our democracy.
Strengthen it at home, I say, while Europe bleeds her
self to death and the result will be a stronger and
greater U. S. than if we enter and win the war for
the allies.
Now is the time for the Stanford Peace Society to
act. We have had speakers and war protests before,
but right now we need unified action, and I feel that
it can be obtained. Certainly the war polls taken at
various universities show that college men, the first
of the cannon fodder to go over, don't want war, and
I believe we can gain nation-wide co-operation. It
may sound like a big job, but when the machinery is
set in motion we will roll along to peace and security.
