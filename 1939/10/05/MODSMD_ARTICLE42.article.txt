# 'Four Feathers' Flaunts British 'Chin-Up' Ideal
## 
### 
"FOUR FEATHERS," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
The British have come through with another one of those "stilT-upper
lip, England-expects-every-man" movies about the army. Psychologically,
this one couldn't have come out at a better time, and it ought to buck up
the British Tommies no end, if they ever get a chance to see it.

As far as the United States is con-*
cerned, there can be no doubt that
the picture was designed to imbue
us with respect for the nobility of
our linguistic brothers across the sea.
However, it is quite possible that this
plan may fail since the hero seems
far more sensible when he is being
"a damned coward, sir," than when
he is tearing about Egypt trying to
redeem his honor.
Harry Faversham, played by John
Clements, would rather stay in Eng
land with his girl than go to Egypt
with Kitchener's army and get kill
ed. His friends and fiance just can't
understand his eminently sane atti
tude, and, from them, he receives
four white feathers—the badge of a
coward.
COWARD TURNS HERO
Whereupon he must remove the
stain of dishonor from the name of
Faversham, and to this end he ap
points himself an ex-officio spy for
the British army in Egypt. He
stoically endures torture, branding,
beatings, and hard labor, and mirac
ulously manages to be on hand to
save the lives of his friends. In the
end he makes the boys eat those
feathers, figuratively, of course.
The best performance is given by
Ralph Richardson, who plays a con
vincingly gallant subaltern in the
best Kiplingesque tradition. Clem
ents, too, does a good job, although
he hides behind a beard for most of
the play. He makes a very dishonest
looking Arab; they should have
suspected him of something sooner.
DESERT COLOR SHOWN
The late C. Aubrey Smith, in one
of his last roles, gives his usual ex
cellent perforcance. June Duprez
has little to do but weep and talk of
"duty" in the approved Victorian
manner.
Battles, blood and breath-taking
technicolor shots of the desert at
dawn and the Nile in the moonlight
add to the picture's value. If you
are propaganda-proof, go and have
a good time.—Hovey
Rutherford Bichard Hayes and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt are tied
as president of the United States
with the longest full names.

Rutherford Bichard Hayes and

with the longest full names.
"FOUR FEATHERS," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
The British have come through with another one of those "stilT-upper
lip, England-expects-every-man" movies about the army. Psychologically,
this one couldn't have come out at a better time, and it ought to buck up
the British Tommies no end, if they ever get a chance to see it.

As far as the United States is con-*
cerned, there can be no doubt that
the picture was designed to imbue
us with respect for the nobility of
our linguistic brothers across the sea.
However, it is quite possible that this
plan may fail since the hero seems
far more sensible when he is being
"a damned coward, sir," than when
he is tearing about Egypt trying to
redeem his honor.
Harry Faversham, played by John
Clements, would rather stay in Eng
land with his girl than go to Egypt
with Kitchener's army and get kill
ed. His friends and fiance just can't
understand his eminently sane atti
tude, and, from them, he receives
four white feathers—the badge of a
coward.
COWARD TURNS HERO
Whereupon he must remove the
stain of dishonor from the name of
Faversham, and to this end he ap
points himself an ex-officio spy for
the British army in Egypt. He
stoically endures torture, branding,
beatings, and hard labor, and mirac
ulously manages to be on hand to
save the lives of his friends. In the
end he makes the boys eat those
feathers, figuratively, of course.
The best performance is given by
Ralph Richardson, who plays a con
vincingly gallant subaltern in the
best Kiplingesque tradition. Clem
ents, too, does a good job, although
he hides behind a beard for most of
the play. He makes a very dishonest
looking Arab; they should have
suspected him of something sooner.
DESERT COLOR SHOWN
The late C. Aubrey Smith, in one
of his last roles, gives his usual ex
cellent perforcance. June Duprez
has little to do but weep and talk of
"duty" in the approved Victorian
manner.
