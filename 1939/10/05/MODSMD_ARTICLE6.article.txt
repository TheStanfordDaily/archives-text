# Germans Rush Troops, Planes To War Front
## Hitler Prepares For Offensive as Allies Reject Peace Pact 
### United Press 
Germany is rushing warplanes and
tens of thousands of additional
troops to the western front for a
desperate war to the finish that may
be unleashed in the wake of Adolf
Hitler's "last concrete peace pro
posal" before the Nazi Reichstag in
Berlin Friday noon.
Great Britain and France told
Hitler bluntly, almost on the eve of
his speech, that they are prepared
to reject both his promises and his
threats; that nothing which "the
present German government" can
offer will serve the Allies from their
determination to crush Hitler and
all he stands for.
TROOPS SENT UP
In view of this virtual advance re
jection of Hitler's peace maneuver,
all available German troops and war
planes were reported being rushed
to the western front, awaiting only
a word from Hitler to hurl against
the British fleet, allied naval centers
and vital industrial spots.
British Foreign Secretary Viscount
Halifax, who long nursed a hope of
Anglo-German friendship and visited
Hitler in search of it, told the House
of Lords Wednesday that, "if after
threats they (the German govern
ment) sought to satisfy us with as
surances, it is necessary to say that
assurances from the present German
government are not enough."

French Premier and War Minister
Edouard Daladier echoed Lord Hali
fax's announcement before the

Premier Benito Mussolini of Italy,
fearful that he may be drawn into
the war as Hitler's ally, still clutched
at hopes of peace but was wary of
attempting the role of peace-maker
in view of the adamant, allied stand.
Mussolini was disappointed when
Germany and Russia got together
and announced Poland would be
wiped out entirely and it was specu
lated the week-end visit to Berlin
of Italian Foreign Minister Count
Galeazzo Ciano might have helped
to influence Hitler's reported offer.
On the second day of debate in
the Senate on President Roosevelt's |
proposal to repeal the mandatory i
U. S. arms embargo two of the Sen
ate's ablest fighters — Senators Ar- \
thur H. Vandenberg of Michigan and j
Torn Connally of Texas—battled over j
the conflicting versions as to the best |
means of keeping America out of j
the war. Both Vandenberg, an iso- |
lationist, and Connally, strong Roo- j
sevelt supporter, conceded repeal of j
the arms embargo is the crux of the j
neutrality battle.

nounced, without giving names or i
details, a French submarine had !
captured a German merchant ship '
and had towed it into port.

Germany is rushing warplanes and
tens of thousands of additional
troops to the western front for a
desperate war to the finish that may
be unleashed in the wake of Adolf
Hitler's "last concrete peace pro
posal" before the Nazi Reichstag in
Berlin Friday noon.
Great Britain and France told
Hitler bluntly, almost on the eve of
his speech, that they are prepared
to reject both his promises and his
threats; that nothing which "the
present German government" can
offer will serve the Allies from their
determination to crush Hitler and
all he stands for.
TROOPS SENT UP
In view of this virtual advance re
jection of Hitler's peace maneuver,
all available German troops and war
planes were reported being rushed
to the western front, awaiting only
a word from Hitler to hurl against
the British fleet, allied naval centers
and vital industrial spots.
British Foreign Secretary Viscount
Halifax, who long nursed a hope of
Anglo-German friendship and visited
Hitler in search of it, told the House
of Lords Wednesday that, "if after
threats they (the German govern
ment) sought to satisfy us with as
surances, it is necessary to say that
assurances from the present German
government are not enough."
FRENCH ECHO HALIFAX
French Premier and War Minister
Edouard Daladier echoed Lord Hali
fax's announcement before the
Chamber of Deputies' foreign rela
tions committee.
Premier Benito Mussolini of Italy,
fearful that he may be drawn into
the war as Hitler's ally, still clutched
at hopes of peace but was wary of
attempting the role of peace-maker
in view of the adamant, allied stand.
Mussolini was disappointed when
Germany and Russia got together
and announced Poland would be
wiped out entirely and it was specu
lated the week-end visit to Berlin
of Italian Foreign Minister Count
Galeazzo Ciano might have helped
to influence Hitler's reported offer.
