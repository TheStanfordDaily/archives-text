# Stanford's Head Barbecuer Tells of Farm Earthquake
## 
### BUD AMES 
"Why, the ground shook and bent the eucalyptus trees right down lo the
ground. Yes sir, I certainly saw those pearly gates swing open to let me
in the night of the Stanford earthquake and I heard them playing "Hand
Me Down My Walking Cane."
The voice of Sam McDonald, negro superintendent of buildings and

grounds for the B.A.C. and unoffi-<
cial head barbecuing chef for the
campus, rang with a laugh through
his little field office. Sam spread his
long-boned arms to demonstrate
how the trees bent and in so doing
he nearly touched the ceiling. Sam
is tall, standing over G feet.
"Yes, I went through the '06
quake," he continued. "I came to
Stanford 'way back in 1903 and be
gan working on a campus construc
tion gang. I was a night watchman
at the time of the quake and had
just turned in when the ground
started shakin'. I guess the water
tap in my bathroom busted, but.
when I was joggled awake and saw
that water floating under the door,
I thought for sure that we had just
dropped off into the ocean."
VIVID PICTURE DRAWN
Alabama Scot, for so he has been
nicknamed, drew a vivid picture of
the situation by again demonstrat
ing his dash for the door. He showed
continuous great activity and ex
treme youthfulness although he
must be well on the way to 60—he
didn't say. He was just as quick to
pick up the conversation again when
questioned concerning his early
life.
"I was born in Chino, which is
down near Los Angeles," ho chatted
on. "But I went to school in Santa
Ana and then in Gilroy when my
folks moved up north here. They
told me that there were jobs up here
at Stanford for a worker and a per
son who likes horses like I do, so I
came up here and they put me to
work fixing roads and watching the
horses. I love horses."
