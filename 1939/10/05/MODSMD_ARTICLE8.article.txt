# Stanford's Head Barbecuer Tells of Farm Earthquake
## 
### BUD AMES 
"Why, the ground shook and bent the eucalyptus trees right down lo the
ground. Yes sir, I certainly saw those pearly gates swing open to let me
in the night of the Stanford earthquake and I heard them playing "Hand
Me Down My Walking Cane."
The voice of Sam McDonald, negro superintendent of buildings and

grounds for the B.A.C. and unoffi-<
cial head barbecuing chef for the
campus, rang with a laugh through
his little field office. Sam spread his
long-boned arms to demonstrate
how the trees bent and in so doing
he nearly touched the ceiling. Sam
is tall, standing over G feet.
"Yes, I went through the '06
quake," he continued. "I came to
Stanford 'way back in 1903 and be
gan working on a campus construc
tion gang. I was a night watchman
at the time of the quake and had
just turned in when the ground
started shakin'. I guess the water
tap in my bathroom busted, but.
when I was joggled awake and saw
that water floating under the door,
I thought for sure that we had just
dropped off into the ocean."
VIVID PICTURE DRAWN
Alabama Scot, for so he has been
nicknamed, drew a vivid picture of
the situation by again demonstrat
ing his dash for the door. He showed
continuous great activity and ex
treme youthfulness although he
must be well on the way to 60—he
didn't say. He was just as quick to
pick up the conversation again when
questioned concerning his early
life.
"I was born in Chino, which is
down near Los Angeles," ho chatted
on. "But I went to school in Santa
Ana and then in Gilroy when my
folks moved up north here. They
told me that there were jobs up here
at Stanford for a worker and a per
son who likes horses like I do, so I
came up here and they put me to
work fixing roads and watching the
horses. I love horses."
To substantiate his statement, Sam
pointed to a racing sulky standing
in the dust outside the office, men
tioning as he did that he had a race
horse which he trotted at times. The
sulky, he said, was one of the last
remnants of the famous Stanford
racing stables. As for the horse, well
he was named Capitola, and he was
a pretty fast horse even if he was
15 years old. Capitola, he gloated, |
had been clocked at 2:22 for the mile
trot, which was really pretty good.
He checked himself reluctantly and
began again to recall his early cam
pus years. "Well, sir, after that
shake, I did reconstruction work
and then in 1907 I was made ground
superintendent, and that's still my
job. At first I took care of the foot
ball field, track and tennis courts all
alone, but I sure was happy all the
time—just like I am when I'm work
ing on a barbecue."
Sam is known the campus over for
his barbecues which he will pre
pare upon the slightest provocation

—for the Frosh Barbecue, for the
Convalescent Home Drive, for any
body.
How did he happen to start barbe
cuing for Stanford gatherings? Sam
wasn't quite sure himself but he
guessed it all started when he used
to barbecue a little meat for his
Stanford friends, university instruc
toi's and fellow workers. Then
those friends began bringing their
lady friends. Sam was embarrassed.
He didn't want to cook in front of
ladies, but he finally took that awful
plunge ahd today "Sam McDonald
has become synonymous with every
"campus barbecue."
Again Sam was off on another
conversational tack. "No, I'm not
married. I haven't had the good for
tune to meet the right lady yet. I
just live alone on the second floor
of the track house over near the
'old track'—l mean Angell Field. I
haven't any relatives in the world.
But I have lots of friends, and I'm
veiy happy."

plunge ahd today "Sam McDonald
has become synonymous with every
"campus barbecue."
Again Sam was off on another
conversational tack. "No, I'm not
married. I haven't had the good for
tune to meet the right lady yet. I
just live alone on the second floor
of the track house over near the
'old track'—l mean Angell Field. I
haven't any relatives in the world.
But I have lots of friends, and I'm
veiy happy."
"Why, the ground shook and bent the eucalyptus trees right down lo the
ground. Yes sir, I certainly saw those pearly gates swing open to let me
in the night of the Stanford earthquake and I heard them playing "Hand
Me Down My Walking Cane."
The voice of Sam McDonald, negro superintendent of buildings and

grounds for the B.A.C. and unoffi-<
cial head barbecuing chef for the
campus, rang with a laugh through
his little field office. Sam spread his
long-boned arms to demonstrate
how the trees bent and in so doing
he nearly touched the ceiling. Sam
is tall, standing over G feet.
"Yes, I went through the '06
quake," he continued. "I came to
Stanford 'way back in 1903 and be
gan working on a campus construc
tion gang. I was a night watchman
at the time of the quake and had
just turned in when the ground
started shakin'. I guess the water
tap in my bathroom busted, but.
when I was joggled awake and saw
that water floating under the door,
I thought for sure that we had just
dropped off into the ocean."
VIVID PICTURE DRAWN
Alabama Scot, for so he has been
nicknamed, drew a vivid picture of
the situation by again demonstrat
ing his dash for the door. He showed
continuous great activity and ex
treme youthfulness although he
must be well on the way to 60—he
didn't say. He was just as quick to
pick up the conversation again when
questioned concerning his early
life.
"I was born in Chino, which is
down near Los Angeles," ho chatted
on. "But I went to school in Santa
Ana and then in Gilroy when my
folks moved up north here. They
told me that there were jobs up here
at Stanford for a worker and a per
son who likes horses like I do, so I
came up here and they put me to
work fixing roads and watching the
horses. I love horses."
To substantiate his statement, Sam
pointed to a racing sulky standing
in the dust outside the office, men
tioning as he did that he had a race
horse which he trotted at times. The
sulky, he said, was one of the last
remnants of the famous Stanford
racing stables. As for the horse, well
he was named Capitola, and he was
a pretty fast horse even if he was
15 years old. Capitola, he gloated, |
had been clocked at 2:22 for the mile
trot, which was really pretty good.
He checked himself reluctantly and
began again to recall his early cam
pus years. "Well, sir, after that
shake, I did reconstruction work
and then in 1907 I was made ground
superintendent, and that's still my
job. At first I took care of the foot
ball field, track and tennis courts all
alone, but I sure was happy all the
time—just like I am when I'm work
ing on a barbecue."
Sam is known the campus over for
his barbecues which he will pre
pare upon the slightest provocation

—for the Frosh Barbecue, for the
Convalescent Home Drive, for any
body.
How did he happen to start barbe
cuing for Stanford gatherings? Sam
wasn't quite sure himself but he
guessed it all started when he used
to barbecue a little meat for his
Stanford friends, university instruc
toi's and fellow workers. Then
those friends began bringing their
lady friends. Sam was embarrassed.
He didn't want to cook in front of
ladies, but he finally took that awful
plunge ahd today "Sam McDonald

How did he happen to start barbe
cuing for Stanford gatherings? Sam
wasn't quite sure himself but he
guessed it all started when he used
to barbecue a little meat for his
Stanford friends, university instruc
toi's and fellow workers. Then
those friends began bringing their
lady friends. Sam was embarrassed.
He didn't want to cook in front of
ladies, but he finally took that awful
plunge ahd today "Sam McDonald
has become synonymous with every
"campus barbecue."
Again Sam was off on another
conversational tack. "No, I'm not
married. I haven't had the good for
tune to meet the right lady yet. I
just live alone on the second floor
of the track house over near the
'old track'—l mean Angell Field. I
haven't any relatives in the world.
But I have lots of friends, and I'm
veiy happy."
