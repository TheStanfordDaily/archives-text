### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
IT was y triumphal parade in the
bomb - torn streets of Warsaw.
Fifteen thousand goose - stepping
troops tramped through the wreck
age of a great city.
But not a Pole was in sight. Not
one of the natives of Warsaw saw
the man who leveled their homes
and devastated 75 per cent of one
of the leading metropolises of Eu
rope. Sentries with fixed bayonets
kept every Pole at least a block from
the route of the two-hour parade
of conquest.
In hi.s flying visit to Warsaw, Hit
ler saw a once-proud and magnifi
cent city in ruins after a 20-day
.siege by the big guns and bombing
planes of the German war ma
chine.
* * $
It was a grim setting—this one
for Hitler's triumphal entry. Col
ored swastikas fluttered feebly
amid the wreckage in a futile at
tempt to provide a little pageantry.
Blank, gaping windows stared
down on the tramping storm
troopers.
Jouncing up and down over the
rutted streets, the Fuehrer, glorying
in the triumph of his three-weeks
"lightning war," rode in his slim,
black limousine from Okecie airport
through the center of the war-ridden
city.
company of honor guards was
lined up on the air field as Hit
ler's plane settled to earth. A band
struck up Deutschland ueber Alles
as Hitler walked slowly and sternly
down the line of honor guards, ac
companied by a group of high-rank
ing generals who directed the con
quest of Poland. On the lapels of
nearly every one of his aides was the
German Iron Cross.
* * *
Then began the ride through the
tortured skeleton of the great city.
The limousine moved past the
Bruehl Palace, the Polish foreign
ministry, the Hotel Europcjski,
and finally into the Avenue Uja
dowski. Silent, deserted embassy
after embassy, former seats of
nearly every world ministry with
diplomatic offices in the Polish
capital, looked out at the victory
procession that celebrated the
three-week conquest and subju
gation of a nation of nearly 40,-
000,000 people.
The "triumph" completed, Hitler
prepared to hurry back to Berlin to
make his Reichstag speech today.
Nazi quarters circulated apparently
inspired reports that he will pro
pose a "fair and generous" European
settlement involving disarmament,
trade and colonies as the alternative
to continuation of the war. Hitler's
hour-and-a-half speech early this
morning will settle once and for all
the truth of conflicting rumors that
have been filtering out of Europe for
the past week.
* * #
r jpHE Fuehrer is expected to offer
peace but will warn of a merci
less war to the finish in conformity
with his order of the day to Nazi
legions today telling them to "bind
the helmet tighter."
Binding the helmet any tighter
may mean strangling Germany, for
already England has more than
once stated her disinclination to
deal with the Nazi chicftain. Ger
many without Hitler, and forfeit
ing any claim to advantages gained
in Poland, might have a chance
with the Allied powers. But a
Germany with Hitler as its lead
er, dictating peace settlements to
England and France, will have
about as much luck as Scabbard
and Blade petitioning Student
Manager John C'obbs for another
"big-name" dance.

peace but will warn of a merci
less war to the finish in conformity
with his order of the day to Nazi
legions today telling them to "bind
the helmet tighter."
Binding the helmet any tighter
may mean strangling Germany, for
already England has more than
once stated her disinclination to
deal with the Nazi chicftain. Ger
many without Hitler, and forfeit
ing any claim to advantages gained
in Poland, might have a chance

Germany with Hitler as its lead

England and France, will have
about as much luck as Scabbard

Fifteen thousand goose - stepping

one of the natives of Warsaw saw
the man who leveled their homes
and devastated 75 per cent of one
of the leading metropolises of Eu

kept every Pole at least a block from
the route of the two-hour parade
