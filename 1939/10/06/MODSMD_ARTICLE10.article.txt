### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 5 (U1 J ). —Soviet Russia tonight extended her domina
tion over the inner Baltic by announcing the signing of a mutual assistance
pact with Latvia whereby Russia will wield strong influence over the Lat
vian army and will acquire important naval and air bases.
The pact with Latvia, which was under Russian rule from 1710 until
1918, is almost identical with Russia's new pact with Estonia, which

.became effective Wednesday night.
By submitting to Russia's terms
the Latvian government followed the
course of her northern neighbor, Es
tonia.
Russia obtained military domina
tion of the narrow strait of Irben
leading into the Bay of Riga by
getting Latvia's consent to fortify
the coast between Ventspils and Pi
traga.
By the terms of the accord with
Estonia put into effect last night
Russia obtained the right to fortify
the Estonia islands north of the
strait.
Russia will erect naval bases at
the Latvian ports of Leipaja (Libau)
and Ventspils (Windau) on the Bal
tic, under leases. The Latvian army
will be supplied and equipped by
Russia "on favorable terms."
A mutual assistance pact similar
to the ones to which Estonia and
Latvia agreed is under process of
negotiation with Lithuania, lying
along Latvia's southern border.
Thus, Russia is quickly throwing
up an armed barrier all the way
from Finland's Aaland Islands south
across the Baltic to German East
Prussia, giving her domination of
tlie Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of
Riga and the Baltic bloc of nations.
A communique tonight describing
the signing of the 10-ycar pact be
tween Russia and Latvia said that
representatives of both governments
"voiced their unanimous opinion
that the mutual confidence estab
lished in the course of many years
. . . forms the necessary factor for
successful realization of the mutual
assistance pact."

tiating with Russia under an "in
