# Pittman Defies Isolation Bloc, Flails Embargo
## 
### 
Son. Key Pittman, D., Nov., leader
of President Roosevelt's fight to re
peal the arms embargo section of the
Neutrality Act, today angrily chal
lenged his isolationist foes to add
cotton, oil and American-mined met
als to the embargo list to prove their
sincerity.
Describing the three commodities
as 'instruments of mass murder,"
Pittman said that the embargo as it
now stands has neither stopped nor
discouraged war.
His outburst, Ihe bitterest since be
ginning of neutrality revision debate
four days ago, came after Sen. John
H. Overton, D., La., an isolationist,
accused him of having reversed his
stand of three years ago, when he
favored the arms ban.
CHARGES INSINCERITY
Pittman, acting majority leader in
the absence of Sen. Alben W. Bark
ley, D., Ky., jumped to his feet, and
pacing down the center aisle, heat
edly described the Isolationists
themselves as insincere because of
their unwillingness to extend the
embargo to other commodities.
He pointed out nothing in the
present law prohibits shipments of
cotton, oil, gasoline and metals, and
added the belligerents "sink every
ship that carries cotton." Ovei~ton's
state is a cotton producer.
The arms embargo, Pittman con
tinued, has not "stopped the bru
tality of more murder. If there has
ever been murder by bombing of
civilian populations," he said, "it has
been going on in China."
JAPANESE WAR CITED
Japan, he observed, did not need
bombs to carry on her war against
China, but scrap-iron which Amer
ican dealers were able to supply her
even if Mr. Roosevelt had placed the
Neutrality Act in effect in the Far
Eastern conflict.
In reply to Overton's charge, he
said at. the time the original Neu
trality Act was passed "We didn't
realize it would discriminate against
the major sea powers"â€”Great Brit
ain and France.
He denied the repeal proposal had
been drafted because of any desire
by the Administration to aid in
"crushing Hitlerism." He added the
embargo elimination plan would
have been advanced whether Ger
many were a "democracy, or a Re
public, or an empire, or what."
Unlike the first two days of the
debate, there were many vacant
seats in the galleries. Few senators
remained on the floor for long, and
at one point a quorum call failed to
raise more than 44 members.
