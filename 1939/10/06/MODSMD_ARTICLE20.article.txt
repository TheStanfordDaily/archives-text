# President Wilbur Denies Band Manager s Request For Return of Majorette
## Stanford Musicians Told to Earn Popularity with Music; California Students Veto Similar Suggestion 
### 
Administrative thumbs were turned down yesterday on the question of
a majorette for Stanford's hand when President Ray Lyman Wilbur denied
a request presented hy Band-Manager Boh Strom (hat a girl he per
mitted to cavort at the head of the hand for the remainder of the fo<rf
hall season. "This University does not want that kind of publicity" Or.

Wilbur .said in issuing his denial.
Harriet Spieer, freshman student
from Santa Ana, who has had pre
vious experience as a majorette,
earlier this week expressed her
wililngness to accept the job, Strom
said.
ISSUE CLOSED
"The band wants a majorette,"
stated Strom. '"Die men arc all for
it, but I guess this closes the issue."
"Get out and earn your popular
ity by playing, not by a pair of
pretty legs," President Wilbur
commented in answering Strom's
request.
The band manager, representing
the band, petitioned the President a{.
noon yesterday.
NON-STUDENTS BARKED
Earlier this month, Dr. Wilbur, in
a letter tr> Strom, expressed the de
sire of the Administration that no
person who is not a member of the
student body, or closely connected
with the University, be permitted to
perform in the band.
At that time, it was thought that
a majorette who was a Stanford
woman would be acceptable. But
yesterday's denial indicated that
under no circumstances was a ma
jorette to lie employed.
The final refusal of permission for
a majorette brought to mind the
furore caused last year when jaunty
Maxine Turner, 17-year-old Saji
Leandro high school girl, appeared
as a surprise at the head of the
band.
Women's Conference and the ad
ministration immediately raised the
objection that Maxine was not a
member of the student body, and
therefore should not participate in
student functions.
CAL VETOES IDEA
However, Maxine was permitted
to strut for the band and the root
ing section during the remainder of
the football season.
Several letters to the Daily, and
the demand of the rooting section,
"Where's the majorette?" indicate
where the student body stands on
the question.
University of California students
voted 5-to-3 in a special election
Wednesday against the suggest ion
that a majorette march with the
band.
The Cal band itself unanimously
vetoed the idea, insisting that tJv
band was "the last stronghold of
masculinity on the coast" among
collcgiate bands.

the football season.
Several letters to the Daily, and
the demand of the rooting section,
"Where's the majorette?" indicate
where the student body stands on
the question.
University of California students
voted 5-to-3 in a special election
Wednesday against the suggest ion
that a majorette march with the
band.
The Cal band itself unanimously
vetoed the idea, insisting that tJv
band was "the last stronghold of
masculinity on the coast" among
collcgiate bands.
Administrative thumbs were turned down yesterday on the question of
a majorette for Stanford's hand when President Ray Lyman Wilbur denied
a request presented hy Band-Manager Boh Strom (hat a girl he per
mitted to cavort at the head of the hand for the remainder of the fo<rf
hall season. "This University does not want that kind of publicity" Or.

Wilbur .said in issuing his denial.
Harriet Spieer, freshman student
from Santa Ana, who has had pre
vious experience as a majorette,
earlier this week expressed her
wililngness to accept the job, Strom
said.
ISSUE CLOSED
"The band wants a majorette,"
stated Strom. '"Die men arc all for
it, but I guess this closes the issue."
"Get out and earn your popular
ity by playing, not by a pair of
pretty legs," President Wilbur
commented in answering Strom's
request.
The band manager, representing
the band, petitioned the President a{.
noon yesterday.
NON-STUDENTS BARKED
Earlier this month, Dr. Wilbur, in
a letter tr> Strom, expressed the de
sire of the Administration that no
person who is not a member of the
student body, or closely connected
with the University, be permitted to
perform in the band.
At that time, it was thought that
a majorette who was a Stanford
woman would be acceptable. But
yesterday's denial indicated that
under no circumstances was a ma
jorette to lie employed.
The final refusal of permission for
a majorette brought to mind the
furore caused last year when jaunty
Maxine Turner, 17-year-old Saji
Leandro high school girl, appeared
as a surprise at the head of the
band.
Women's Conference and the ad
ministration immediately raised the
objection that Maxine was not a
member of the student body, and
therefore should not participate in
student functions.
CAL VETOES IDEA
However, Maxine was permitted
to strut for the band and the root
ing section during the remainder of
the football season.
