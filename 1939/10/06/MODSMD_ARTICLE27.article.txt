# Graduate Returns to Alaska With Bride, Master's Degree
## 
### 
Clarence Rusch pulled up at
Stanford about a year ago and,after
frisking himself of icy reminders of
a three-year stay in Alaska, settled
down to work for a master's degree
in sociology. When he returned to
the icy northland early this week he
had with him not only the degree,
but a bride as well.
Mrs. R.usch, who is the former
Elinor Steventon, was graduated last
quarter from Stanford, where she
specialized in social service work.
The couple were married last month.
For three years before coming to
Stanford, Rusch was occupied in
the Indian village of Koyukuk as
teacher, recreation supervisor, law
yer, and midwife. When he accepted
the civil service appointment to
work in Alaska he did so "because
he liked things that were different."
Just how it was to be different he
did not find out until later.
After three years of it, Rusch
thought it about time to take that
master's degree he'd been wanting
since he graduated from Milwaukee
State Teachers' College. So he came
clown to Stanford and set out to do
it in a year, considered very good
time for such an enterprise.

to be cut out of the same pattern as
the first. He will be stationed at a
remote Indian Service School at
Nondalton on Lake Clark, 200 miles
northwest of Seward. He and his
wife will serve as teachers, coun
sellors, doctor, and nurse to a small
group of Indians on the lake's
shore.
Immediate objective of Rusch's
work is to teach the Indians, not lay
the law down to them. He'll prob
ably end up doing a lot more than
teaching. If his last performance in
Alaska is any indication, Rusch will
no doubt find himself doing general
housekeeping.
