# School Dentists Give Check-ups
## 
### 
As a courtesy to the Stanford
Health Service, the members of the
faculty of the School of Dentistry,
under the direction of Dr. Ernest
Sloman, are examining the teeth of
new students today at the Men's
Health Service offices in the B.A.C.
Each year, for the past seven
years, the School of Dentistry of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons
in San Francisco has volunteered
this service. This year, the Health
Service is returning the courtesy by
examining the new students of the
School of Dentistry.
A limited number of old students
may receive this examination upon
application at the Men's Health
Service.
