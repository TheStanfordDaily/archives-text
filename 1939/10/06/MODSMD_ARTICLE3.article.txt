# Reichstag Hears Hitler Early Today
## Germany Warns U.S. That Refugee Ship Will He Torpedoed 
### UNITED PRESS 
Adolf Hitler goes before his Reich
stag in Berlin Friday to offer what
Nazis said would be "fair and gen
erous" terms for calling off the war,
but the Allies already are prepared
to reject whatever he may say.
As puzzling as what Hitler is go
ing to say in his hour and one-half
speech at 6 a.m. E.S.T. was a warn
ing that came to the United States
government Thursday that the
American steamship Iroquois re
turning 584 American refugees from
Europe may be torpedoed and sunk.
The White House announced that
Grand Admiral Erich Raeder of the
German navy had delivered the
warnings to the U.S. naval attache
in Berlin, telling him the Iroquois
was to be sent to the bottom of
the Atlantic under circumstances
similar to the sinking of the British
liner Athenia on Sept. 3.
The Iroquois left Cobh Oct. 2 and
is due in New York Wednesday.
BRITISH SUSPECTED
Admiral Raeder's warning had its
significance in the fact that the Ger
mans have consistently charged the
Athenia was not sunk by a German
submarine—all eye-witness versions
to the contrary—but was sunk de
liberately "on the orders of Winston
Churchill," British First Lord of the
Admiralty.
The American government said it
placed little credence in the report
and refused to become alarmed, al
though several warships and a Coast
Guard vessel were sent out to meet
the Iroquois as a precautionary
measure.
The British government refused to
comment, regarding such an attitude
as the best indication of its reaction
to such an allegation.
As to Hitler's Reichstag speech,
there remained few clues as to what
he would say but Nazis in Berlin
circulated an apparently inspired
report that he would propose a
general European settlement involv
ing disarmament, trade, colonies, a
small Polish "national state" and
"more liberties" for Czechoslovaks.
DENIAL MEANS WAR
If the Allies reject this formula, it
was said, Hitler will unleash the full
might of his war machine against
them.
The "fair and generous" general
settlement which the Nazis talked of
—if it actually is Hitler's offer—
falls far short of what Britain and
France require for an end to the
month-old war.
The British and French Ambassa
dors in Rome told Premier Benito
Mussolini any peace proposals ad
vanced by Hitler are doomed to re
jection unless the Allies' war aims
are satisfied. These war aims in
clude the complete restoration of
Poland as a sovereign nation, the
"liberation" of the Czechs and an
end to Nazi methods of force and
threat of force.
Hitler won't go that far and the
Allies arc committed publicly to ac
cept no less.
While the world speculated on his
Friday speech Hitler flew to con
quered and shell-shattered Warsaw
Thursday and reviewed 15,000 of his
troops goose-stepping through the
ruins in a victory parade.
VICTORY GUARDED'
All Polish residents were kept at
least a block from the route of the
two-hour parade — behind barriers
of soldiers with fixed bayonets.
The war on the western front was
virtually at a standstill but French
forces continued methodically to
clear remnants of German patrols
from Warndt Forest, near the in
dustrial city of Saarbruecken.
Belgium was apprehensive lest her
neutrality be violated by a repeti
tion of the events of 1914 when the
German army strode through Bel
gium to strike at France. A Belga
news agency dispatch reported from
Berlin that "circumstances" might
cause Germany to renounce her neu
trality pledges to Belgium, but the
I German propaganda ministry immc
j diately denied the report and said
i Belgium's neutrality would be re
| spected.

If the Allies reject this formula, it

The "fair and generous" general
settlement which the Nazis talked of
—if it actually is Hitler's offer—
falls far short of what Britain and
France require for an end to the
month-old war.
The British and French Ambassa
dors in Rome told Premier Benito
Mussolini any peace proposals ad
vanced by Hitler are doomed to re
jection unless the Allies' war aims
are satisfied. These war aims in
clude the complete restoration of
Poland as a sovereign nation, the
"liberation" of the Czechs and an
end to Nazi methods of force and
threat of force.
Hitler won't go that far and the
Allies arc committed publicly to ac

While the world speculated on his
Friday speech Hitler flew to con

Thursday and reviewed 15,000 of his

All Polish residents were kept at

two-hour parade — behind barriers
of soldiers with fixed bayonets.
The war on the western front was
virtually at a standstill but French
forces continued methodically to
clear remnants of German patrols
from Warndt Forest, near the in

Belgium was apprehensive lest her
neutrality be violated by a repeti
tion of the events of 1914 when the
German army strode through Bel
gium to strike at France. A Belga
news agency dispatch reported from

Adolf Hitler goes before his Reich

As puzzling as what Hitler is go

speech at 6 a.m. E.S.T. was a warn
ing that came to the United States
government Thursday that the
American steamship Iroquois re
turning 584 American refugees from
Europe may be torpedoed and sunk.
The White House announced that
Grand Admiral Erich Raeder of the
German navy had delivered the
warnings to the U.S. naval attache
in Berlin, telling him the Iroquois
was to be sent to the bottom of
the Atlantic under circumstances
similar to the sinking of the British
liner Athenia on Sept. 3.
The Iroquois left Cobh Oct. 2 and
is due in New York Wednesday.
BRITISH SUSPECTED
Admiral Raeder's warning had its
significance in the fact that the Ger
mans have consistently charged the
Athenia was not sunk by a German
submarine—all eye-witness versions
to the contrary—but was sunk de
liberately "on the orders of Winston
Churchill," British First Lord of the
Admiralty.
The American government said it
placed little credence in the report
and refused to become alarmed, al

Guard vessel were sent out to meet
the Iroquois as a precautionary
measure.
