# Thornhill Duckhunters Hit Oregon Trail
## Cards Prepared to Meet Oregon with Aerial Came Right Halfback Trouble, Sawdust 'Feld' May Slow Indians Saturday 
### 
The second chapter in the saga of MM) Indian football will he written
on the sawdust gridiron ol Multnomah Stadium in Portland tomorrow when
lin> 1 hornhill s gridders battle Tex Oliver's giant-killing Oregon Webfcet.
.*>ciit on their way yesterday afternoon by a delegation of 500 student
rooters, complete with band and cheer-leaders, the team will reach Port-

land about noon tomorrow.
Thornhill put the squad through a
short, brisk workout on the prac
tice field an hour before train time.
Alter the drill, the Indian mentor
said that Jim Groves, first-string
rgiht halfback, might not be able to
play in the Oregon game. Groves
hasn't recovered yet from the phys
ical pounding he took against the
Oregon State Beavers in last week's
opener.
With Groves out, Hugh Gallarneau
will get the call at left half. Gal
larneau seems to have fully recov
ered from a four-day term in the
hospital with an infected toe.
BACKFIELD NAMED
Rounding out the Card first
string backfield will be Frankie Al
bert, left half, Gene Coldiron, quar
ter, and Norm Standlee, fullback.
Albert ran into a lot of troubles,
mostly yellow jersied ones, in his
clebut last Saturday, but he'll be in
there pitching again tomorrow.
Farm hopes will be pinned on his
left handed tosses.
Oregon stopped a highly touted
Southern California running attack
last week, holding such driving
backs as Amby Schindler, Bob Peo
ples, and Grenny Lansdell consist
ently for short gains. The Trojans
had to throw 35 passes to tie the
game late in the fourth quarter.
ATTACK BY AIR
Against a defense like that, the
Big Red Machine will have to throw
the ball around to gain yards. Be
sides Albert, Norm Standlee and
Hugh Gallarneau have been primed
to do some of the pitching. If he j
sees action, Jim Groves will also be
on the throwing end of some of the
pass plays that Thornhill has given |
the team in recent practices.
Standlee, Albert and Gallarneau
are all better than average kickers.
Albert got off a quick kick in the '
first quarter of Oregon State j
encounter that was good for about J
70 yards. Standlee made several
boots that were worth over 50 yards
from the line of scrimmage.
Several of Thornhill's untried men I
received valuable experience in the \
Beaver game, and are expected by [
the coaching staff to play sounder!
lootball after viewing their mistakes I
in movies shown the squad at train- \
ing table during the week.
INJURED WEBFEET
Oregon didn't come out of the j
Trojan game unscathed. Bob Blen- |
kinsop, starting end, came out of a |
pile-up with a broken arm. Either!
Bill Regner or Hymie Harris will get 1
the starting call, and both are prom- I
ising but green sophomores.
In .spite of the loss of Blenkinsop, I
the Ducks will go into the game a j
strong favorite, mainly because of a
starting backfield made up of Den- j
nis Donovan, Jay Graybeal, Buck 1
Berry, and Walt Emmons. Stand- '
outs in the line are Vic Reginato,
right end, and Cece Walden, right '
guard.
Tiny Thornhill isn't any too j
pleased at the prospect of playing I
on the sawdust-covered field in '
Multnomah Stadium, but said that j
he intends to request that the field
be watered and rolled before Satur- :
day's game.

INJURED WEBFEET
Oregon didn't come out of the j
Trojan game unscathed. Bob Blen- |
kinsop, starting end, came out of a |
pile-up with a broken arm. Either!
Bill Regner or Hymie Harris will get 1
the starting call, and both are prom- I
ising but green sophomores.
In .spite of the loss of Blenkinsop, I
the Ducks will go into the game a j
strong favorite, mainly because of a
starting backfield made up of Den- j
nis Donovan, Jay Graybeal, Buck 1
Berry, and Walt Emmons. Stand- '
outs in the line are Vic Reginato,
right end, and Cece Walden, right '
guard.
Tiny Thornhill isn't any too j
pleased at the prospect of playing I
on the sawdust-covered field in '
Multnomah Stadium, but said that j
he intends to request that the field
be watered and rolled before Satur- :
day's game.
The second chapter in the saga of MM) Indian football will he written
on the sawdust gridiron ol Multnomah Stadium in Portland tomorrow when
lin> 1 hornhill s gridders battle Tex Oliver's giant-killing Oregon Webfcet.
.*>ciit on their way yesterday afternoon by a delegation of 500 student
rooters, complete with band and cheer-leaders, the team will reach Port-

land about noon tomorrow.
Thornhill put the squad through a
short, brisk workout on the prac
tice field an hour before train time.
Alter the drill, the Indian mentor
said that Jim Groves, first-string
rgiht halfback, might not be able to
play in the Oregon game. Groves
hasn't recovered yet from the phys
ical pounding he took against the
Oregon State Beavers in last week's
opener.
With Groves out, Hugh Gallarneau
will get the call at left half. Gal
larneau seems to have fully recov
ered from a four-day term in the
hospital with an infected toe.
BACKFIELD NAMED
Rounding out the Card first
string backfield will be Frankie Al
bert, left half, Gene Coldiron, quar
ter, and Norm Standlee, fullback.
Albert ran into a lot of troubles,
mostly yellow jersied ones, in his
clebut last Saturday, but he'll be in
there pitching again tomorrow.
Farm hopes will be pinned on his
left handed tosses.
Oregon stopped a highly touted
Southern California running attack
last week, holding such driving
backs as Amby Schindler, Bob Peo
ples, and Grenny Lansdell consist
ently for short gains. The Trojans
had to throw 35 passes to tie the
game late in the fourth quarter.
ATTACK BY AIR
Against a defense like that, the
Big Red Machine will have to throw
the ball around to gain yards. Be
sides Albert, Norm Standlee and
Hugh Gallarneau have been primed
to do some of the pitching. If he j
sees action, Jim Groves will also be
on the throwing end of some of the
pass plays that Thornhill has given |
the team in recent practices.
Standlee, Albert and Gallarneau
are all better than average kickers.
Albert got off a quick kick in the '
first quarter of Oregon State j
encounter that was good for about J
70 yards. Standlee made several
boots that were worth over 50 yards
from the line of scrimmage.
Several of Thornhill's untried men I
