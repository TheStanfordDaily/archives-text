## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Pearson Baffles Reds, Yanks Take Second Series Game 4-0 Lanky California Hurler Hit Twice, Just Misses Taking World Record 
### 
\ ANKLE STADIUM. New York, Oct. 5 (UP). —A darting, dipping
•white pellet propelled by a tall, enigmatic Californian humiliated and
humbled the Cincinnati Beds almost beyond belief today rs the New York
Yankees swaggered on to their second straight triumph over the National
League champions. 4 to 0.

The lanky fellow throwing the*
; ball past the Reds with uncanny
precision which almost landed him
in the no-hit hall of fame, was
Marcellus Monte Pearson, who comes
up with a strange assortment of
I aches and pains along about this
time every year and then pitches a
World Series masterpiece.
lIURLS FOURTH WIN
Pearson outdid himself as he j
hurled his fourth straight World Se- '
ries triumph,-a two-hit masterpiece!
which reduced the Reds to a feeble, !
impotent group of ball players who '
never had a ghost of a chance.
With 59,971 looking on, Pearson !
cut down the Reds in monotonous
order—one by one and inning by !
inning, save for one base on balls j
in the fourth, until big, lumbering !
Ernie Lombardi came to bat in the I
eighth with one out.
But Lombardi, the big Cincinnati
catcher, broke Pearson's ghostly 1
spell over Bill McKechnie's charges j
when he slashed a clean line single j
to Pearson's left.
RECORD SPOILED
In the ninth the Yankee twirler i
erased Billy Myers on another of
those feeble taps in front of the i
plate and fanned pinch-hitter Lee i
Gamble. He had only one man to go j
to equal Ed Reulbach's 1-hitter for ,
the Cubs against the White Sox in'
190(5. But Billy Werber spoiled j
Pearson's chances to bracket his ;
name with Reulbach's by getting an- :
other clean single to left. A moment ;
later Frey forced Wenber at second, J
closing out a 2-hit classic for Pear- i
son.
Only seven men have pitched two- '
hit games in World Series annals!
before today. The last two to do it
were Burleigh Grimes of the Cardi
nals and George Earnshaw of the
Athletics in the St. Louis-Philadel
phia World Series of 1931.
