# Card Mermen Sink Spartans
## Waterdog Offensive Led by Plate. Allen 
### 
Stanford mermen whipped out a
6-2 win over the San Jose Spartans
in Encina Pool yesterday afternoon
in the opening game of the season.
The Indians had the Spartans on
the small end of the score from the
start of the game, leading them 3-1
at the end of the first half, and
chalking up three more goals in the
second half.
The first goal for Stanford was
scored when six-footer Bob Plate
tossed the ball 25 feet for the point.
The second score of the game was
made by Curran of the Spartan
squad, tieing the score 1-1.
From there on in, it was Stan
ford all the way with Bob Allen
scoring heavily to lead the home
team. San Jose scored once more
mid-way in the second half for their
final goal, while the Indian offense
clicked well and often.
Dick Hoover at defensive guard
was outstanding as was the combi
nation of Allen, Plate, and Bill
Bleecker in the front line.
