# Placer J.C. Next on Menu For Papooses
## Trick Mays Should Compensate Absence Of Norberg, Vucinich 
### 
Now equipped with such devices !
of deception as the spinner, double j
reverse, and shuttle pass, Stanford's j
freshman eleven enters Saturday's'
tilt against Placer Junior College a j
much more polished unit than the |
one which made its grid debut last !
week.
They'll be much more of a threat I
with these new tricks of offense but
are sure to feel the effect of two I
injuries sustained in last Saturday's
opener. First there is a fractured i
cheek bone which will keep the i
squad's most capable end, Hank
Norberg, on the bench, eating his ;
heart out for a chance to play.
The other is a shoulder bruise ;
which will keep Milt Vucinich from i
tossing any of those devastating j
passes that scored once and gained
many yards for the Papooses last |
week. The injury makes it impos- j
sible for Milt to raise his arm above
his head and puts the burden of the !
passing attack in the hands of little,
but effective, A1 Cole.
VUCINICH TO START
Vucinich, however, will start and
will call signals and will, along with
Eric Armstrong and Red Taylor,
handle the heavy running for the
yearlings. Milt won't do any more
work than actually necessary in or
der that he be in top shape for the
game with the U.S.C. frosh which is
next on the program. Bob Green- j
ing. varsity fullback Norm Stand- j
lee's cousin, will take over Vuci- J
nich's chores when Coach Harry I
Shipkey sees fit.
The invading Jaysee team is rath- ;
er an unknown quantity, playing I
only one game, a (i-G tie against
Marin Junior College. Yet if the
yearlings show the fire they do in
practice and click smoothly on those I
new plays they learned this week, j
they ought to run rough-shod over i
any Jaysee team in Northern Cali
fornia.
SYMES TAKES OVER
Lanky, blond Bill Symes will !
take over Norberg's place to team j
with Ed Stamm at the wing posts. I
The tackles will still be Bruno!
Banducci and George Robinson; the !
guards, Ed McCain and Dick Pal
mer; and the center, Bill Mannon.
The regular talented backfield of
Vucinich, Cole, Taylor, and Arm
strong will open the battle.

cheek bone which will keep the i
squad's most capable end, Hank
Norberg, on the bench, eating his ;
heart out for a chance to play.
The other is a shoulder bruise ;
which will keep Milt Vucinich from i
tossing any of those devastating j
passes that scored once and gained
many yards for the Papooses last |
week. The injury makes it impos- j
sible for Milt to raise his arm above
his head and puts the burden of the !
passing attack in the hands of little,
but effective, A1 Cole.
VUCINICH TO START
Vucinich, however, will start and
will call signals and will, along with
Eric Armstrong and Red Taylor,
handle the heavy running for the
yearlings. Milt won't do any more
work than actually necessary in or
der that he be in top shape for the
game with the U.S.C. frosh which is
next on the program. Bob Green- j
ing. varsity fullback Norm Stand- j
lee's cousin, will take over Vuci- J
nich's chores when Coach Harry I
Shipkey sees fit.
The invading Jaysee team is rath- ;
er an unknown quantity, playing I
only one game, a (i-G tie against
Marin Junior College. Yet if the
yearlings show the fire they do in
practice and click smoothly on those I
new plays they learned this week, j
they ought to run rough-shod over i
any Jaysee team in Northern Cali
fornia.
SYMES TAKES OVER
Lanky, blond Bill Symes will !
take over Norberg's place to team j
with Ed Stamm at the wing posts. I
The tackles will still be Bruno!
Banducci and George Robinson; the !
guards, Ed McCain and Dick Pal
mer; and the center, Bill Mannon.
The regular talented backfield of
Vucinich, Cole, Taylor, and Arm
strong will open the battle.
Now equipped with such devices !
of deception as the spinner, double j
reverse, and shuttle pass, Stanford's j
freshman eleven enters Saturday's'
tilt against Placer Junior College a j
much more polished unit than the |
one which made its grid debut last !
week.
They'll be much more of a threat I
with these new tricks of offense but
are sure to feel the effect of two I
injuries sustained in last Saturday's
opener. First there is a fractured i
cheek bone which will keep the i
squad's most capable end, Hank
Norberg, on the bench, eating his ;
heart out for a chance to play.
