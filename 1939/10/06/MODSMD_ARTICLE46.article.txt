# Foilsmen Battle First Opponents
## 
### 
Stanford foilsmen went up to San
Francisco last night to meet an ex
perienced team from Funke's Fenc
ing Academy. The meet came as a
surprise to the Cards since it was
believed that Stanford would be un
able to participate in the Heron Tro
phy matches this year. Arrange
ments have been made to play the
remainder of the schedule on the
Farm, however, making it possible
for Stanford to sign up for the
matches.
The line-up for the meet last
night included John Cooper, Dick
Myerhoff, Francis Bray, Dave Daly,
and Ed Cook. All except Daly are
experienced fencers from last year's

varsity, and were expected to make
as good a show as possible against
their powerful opponents.
