IF there is any doubt to be cast upon the ex
istence of Stanford democracy, let the icono
clasts retire to defend their fort.
Twenty-four hours after A.S.S.U. President
Ken Cuthbertson presented the proposal for an
off-campus Big Game dance to Cardinals, the
views of the Administration and every frater
nity and eating club on the campus had been
obtained. And considered from every aspect,
they appeared favorable.
Fully appreciating the problem of finding
suitable Big Game night entertainment, Presi
dent Wilbur, Dean Yost, and Dean Bunn wel
comed the idea, but naturally withheld final
approval until more definite plans have been
formulated.
With Rally Committee members canvassing
all men's living groups during meal times yes
terday, Cardinals was able to report last night
that approximately one-third of those contacted
stated that they would attend an A.S.S.U.-spon
sored dance. The total number who so com
mitted themselves was more than 250, a group
which easily could cover the expense of giv
ing the function.
Thus it has been proved that:
The outlook for administrative approval is
favorable.
The demand for such a dance exists.
The financial arrangements appear to be feas
ible.
However, the job does not end here. There
still remains the problem of selling Stanford
the idea that there is no correlation between
the amount of pleasure derived from a social
function and the sum of money invested. The
task is difficult, but not at all impossible.
Whether it dances in a barnyard or a ball
room is immaterial when Stanford makes up
its mind to enjoy itself.
And Big Game night is the time to do it.
