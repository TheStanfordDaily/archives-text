WHEN Dr. Wilbur vetoed the motion that
an attractive young woman student be al
lowed to lead the Stanford band this football
season, his action occasioned little surprise.
Undoubtedly he was remembering last year's
drum majorette controversy — the front - page
stories and pictures in San Francisco and Los
Angeles papers . . . the banner headlines in
Bloomington, 111. . . . the full-page spread in the
Swiss magazine, printed in German.
Already this week two University of Cali
fornia women have had their pictures splashed
on the pages of a great many of the nation's
newspapers because they were promoted as
baton-twirlers for the band. The U.C. bandsmen
were strongly opposed to any woman leading
them, and the project finally was snowed under
by a student-body vote.
The kind of publicity that results from having
an attractive young majorette, somewhat scan
tily clad, leading the trumpet-blowers onto the
gridiron is harmful to the University. Instead of
winning friends and supporters for Stanford,
it makes it appear foolish to the public—and
unworthy of its respect.
If football games were played before an
audience composed exclusively of students,
there would be no argument against having a
skilled majorette at the head of the band. But,
the rooting section occupies only a small part
of the Stadium, and outside customers are
bound to gape and guffaw at the female baton
twirler.
And their gaping and guffawing means pub
licity for Stanford—the kind of publicity that
makes the public laugh at us, not with us.
