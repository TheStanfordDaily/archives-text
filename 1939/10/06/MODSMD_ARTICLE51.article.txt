# The 						Road to Peace
## 
### 
IN yesterday's Daily there was a long Campus
Opinion signed by "A Pacifist and an Ameri
can" urging college students in general and
Stanford students in particular to do something
positive toward keeping this country out of
war.

It suggested, somewhat vaguely, that Stan
ford send an "endorsement for peace" to Wash
ington, and that this endorsement be sent to
other colleges in this country.
The letter is shot with pseudo-sententious
remarks such as: "Now is the time for the Stan
ford Peace Society to act"; "It may sound like
a big job, but when the machinery is set in
motion, we will roll along to peace and se
curity."
(How many things on this campus need only
the engine thrown in gear, the machinery oiled,
and they will roll to hell-and-gone! What this
campus needs is a good, first-rate mechanic.)
But boiling the letter down to its essence,
will that proposal, provided it is carried out,
do anything at all toward keeping this country
out of war?
At the University of California they carried
it a step farther this week. They circulated a
petition to which all signers pledged them
selves to refuse to fight should this country go
to war, and sent it along to Washington. But
would even that do anything toward keeping
America out of war?
Or are the forces which decide wars such
that they cannot be influenced by college boys
and girls signing petitions?
Do the wheels still need oiling?
