AND IT STILL COSTS FORTY CENTS
"YOU are sitting in this theater under the protec
tion of the greatest flag in the world!"
Clap and cheer for that flag, brother! How else do
you expect to work up good hysterical nationalism?
How else can you learn to hate other nations, to justify
mass-murder as nobility and glory? Marching, shoot
ing, bombing and dying are not occupations that a
chap can jump right into. A college education doesn't
fit you too well for the business of dismembering and
being dismembered. You've got to work yourself into
it. Come on. Join the mob. Feel that great shivery
thrill when you see Old Glory waving in the breezes.
Let the clap-trap music martial your blood and glands
and guts. Cheer! Clap and cheer! But don't, man—for
God's sake don't think! It's dangerous.
That the "Government of the people, by the people,
and for the people shall not perish from the earth!"
Hear the firm determination in those words "shall
not perish!" Thrills you, doesn't it? Well, let it thrill
you! Only don't ever stop to reason about those words.
If you do, you might find a logical way of preserving
freedom. You might remember that wars help civiliza
tion to perish from the earth — along with yourself
when you are a soldier. Just eat up this jingoistic
stuff. That's why we give it to you.
* J»t # *
I PLEDGE allegiance to the flag of the United States
of America ..."
That's the way to be patriotic. Just say those words
with a blind tremor of emotion in your voice. That
isn't following the herd; that's just being a good citizen.
Haven't you always been taught, ever since you were
in the first grade, that the flag is sacred? Well then,
the flag must always represent high, democratic ideals.
No, no, man! Unscrupulous and mercenary jingoists
never hide behind the flag. They never sell patriot
ism—or you either. There's the flag. That's all you
have to think about. "I pledge allegiance . . .
. . . and to the republic for which it stands, one
nation, indivisible ..."
That's it —indivisible! Don't do your own thinking.
Don't lift your voice above the crowd's. That's what
we mean by your pledge. That's the way we interpret
patriotism.
". . . with liberty and justice for all!"
And remember, soldier boy, when you're out. there
living with rats and lice, when you're out there shoot
ing at people with whom you were never angry, just
remember that you're fighting for liberty and justice!
You're not killing men, like yourselves. You're defend
ing freedom and your home!
Now sing "My Country 'Tis of Thee," and go home
to a Hearst editorial.
