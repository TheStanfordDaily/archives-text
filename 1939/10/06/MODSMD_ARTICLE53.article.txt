# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHERE IS MAXINE? 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
I felt very much at home in the stands of Stan
ford Stadium Saturday. The rooting section was there,
telegraphs clicked from the press box, kids were sell
ing programs and the rest of their wares.
There was a new clock on the scoreboard, kindly
donated by the Associated Oil Company (advt.), but
that didn't disrupt things too much.
Everything was fine until the band came on the
field. Then the shock. The football game became a sec
ondary issue. No Maxie. No drum-majorette of any
kind. This must not continue!
After a year of gloating while rival rooting sections
groaned with envy at sight of a beautiful gal in a dis
creetly short skirt cavorting in front of the musicians,
is Stanford going to flatly insult the constitutional
rights of the spectators and impede the progress toward
emancipation of universal womanhood by discontinuing
a practice so notably started?
J. B.
