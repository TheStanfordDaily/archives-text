# NEUTRALITY RAMPANT
## 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
Tlie editorial in the San Francisco Chronicle of
October 2 is a challenge to the Stanford student body
and the student body on every campus in the United
States. There is no doubt about it, if war comes, you
fellows in college are just the ones to go first. Is there
not an opportunity for you editors to organize the stu
dent bodies all over the land in a united front for
peace? Why not have every institution join on Armis
tice Day in a Peace Day or Neutrality Day celebration?
I'm afraid this attitude of refusing to go to war if
drafted is in error. Now is the time that all efforts
should be made to keep us out of the European prob
lem. Now, not later! Once the society of this nation has
committed itself to war. the time has passed when the
individual may choose. Otherwise, our country cannot
endure.
And our plea for peace should not be taken as one
against preparedness. Our ability for isolation depends
upon adequate preparedness. It is my belief that if
every advocate of immediate commitment was re
quired to subject himself to military training and to
call for immediate duty in case of war much of this
parlor-room belligerence would disappear.
Why doesn't Stanford lend in a movement for "Neu
traltiy Day"?
Perhaps President Wilbur would lie glad to sanc
tion nnd support your organization of this movement.
