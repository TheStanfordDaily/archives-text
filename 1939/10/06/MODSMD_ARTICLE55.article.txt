# Chapel Seating Plan Changed
## Chaplain Announces Opening of Balconies 
### 
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, chaplain
of the University, has announced
that next Sunday, "for the first time
in many years," the chapel bal
conies will be open for attendance
at the service.
That this change in policy has oc
curred is largely due to the very
favorable comments of those who, at
the matriculation services, were
forced to go to the balconies be
cause of the lack of room in the
main body of the chapel.
GIVES BETTER VIEW
Among the advantages expected to
arise out of the innovation, are a
better view of the chapel, especially
the mosaic-work, and convenience
to late-comers.
The chaplain welcomes any com
ments from students relating to the
change. If the general reaction
seems favorable, the balconies will
continue to remain open at services.
MUSIC PRESENTED
Dr. Trueblood will conduct Sun
day's services. The music will com
prise Martin's anthem, "Benedictus
es Domine"; and the prelude, "Hark,
a Voice Saith, 'All Are Mortal'," by
Bach.
Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, will present a recital. The pro
gram will include: Introduction to
"II Pomo d'Oro" by Cesti; Interlu
dium by Lovelock; Gavotta and
Variations, by Stanley; Sarabanda by
Zipoli; Minuet from "Bei'nice" by
Handel; and Andante and Finale,
Grand Symphonic Piece, by Franck.
