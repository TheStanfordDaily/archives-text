"ESCAPE," by Ethel Vance.
There is something about Nazi
Germany that seems to inspire our
fiction writers. It would be the un
usual author who did not see the
juicy opportunities for a timely and
lucrative book about innocent men
and women struggling against the
evil forces of National Socialism.
In the past year or two there have
been many such books, but only
two have been at all outstanding.
One of these was the now classic
"Address Unknown," and the other
is the new noVel, "Escape," by Ethel
Vance. The two books are hardly
comparable since they have dealt
with entirely different characters
and plots, but they have one feature
in common—understatement.
EMOTIONS EMPHASIZED
We are all rather well-informed
about the facts, blood purges, con
centration camps, persecution of
Jews. An author cannot surprise us
with the unusualness of his charac
ter's tribulations; and therein lies
the fault in most of these new novels
with the German setting.
What the authors of "Escape" and
"Address Unknown" have done is to
make the facts incidental. They are
there, but only by implication. It is
the emotions behind the facts that
get emphasis, and that is why both
books are such excellent examples
of their kind.
"Escape" concerns Emmy Ritter, a
great German actress, who has been
sentenced to death for attempting to
smuggle money out of Germany. Her
American-born son comes to Ger
many with no plarrTf*" r aGtion, but
with the desperate feeling that he
must bring about his mother's es
cape.
PLOT INCIDENTAL
The plot is involved, but quite
logical. But it is not the plot that
matters. It is the characters and
their philosophy which raise the
book so far above the level of the
melodramatic. Emmy Ritter, re
signed to death at the hands of her
countrymen who 20 years before
had idolized her as their greatest
actress; her son Mark, agonizingly
conscious of his inability to help
his mother; the American-born
countess, whose loyalties are divided
between her pompous Junker lover
and young, intense Mark.
All these characters are beauti
fully done, but the young doctor is
by far the best of the lot. Miss Vance
manages to make of him both a
symbol of the young Germany and
a believable and understandable
individual. Trained in the Nazi ideal
since youth, he finds that he cannot
reconcile the execution of Emmy
Ritter with his own code and, in the
end, it is his own and not the
Fuehrer's code which triumphs. —

in common—understatement.
EMOTIONS EMPHASIZED
We are all rather well-informed
about the facts, blood purges, con
centration camps, persecution of
Jews. An author cannot surprise us
with the unusualness of his charac
ter's tribulations; and therein lies
the fault in most of these new novels
with the German setting.
What the authors of "Escape" and
"Address Unknown" have done is to
make the facts incidental. They are
there, but only by implication. It is
the emotions behind the facts that
get emphasis, and that is why both
books are such excellent examples
of their kind.
"Escape" concerns Emmy Ritter, a
great German actress, who has been
sentenced to death for attempting to
smuggle money out of Germany. Her
American-born son comes to Ger
many with no plarrTf*" r aGtion, but
with the desperate feeling that he
must bring about his mother's es
cape.
PLOT INCIDENTAL
The plot is involved, but quite
logical. But it is not the plot that
matters. It is the characters and
their philosophy which raise the
book so far above the level of the
melodramatic. Emmy Ritter, re
signed to death at the hands of her
countrymen who 20 years before
had idolized her as their greatest
actress; her son Mark, agonizingly
conscious of his inability to help
his mother; the American-born
countess, whose loyalties are divided
between her pompous Junker lover
and young, intense Mark.
All these characters are beauti
fully done, but the young doctor is
by far the best of the lot. Miss Vance
manages to make of him both a
symbol of the young Germany and
a believable and understandable
individual. Trained in the Nazi ideal
since youth, he finds that he cannot
reconcile the execution of Emmy
Ritter with his own code and, in the
end, it is his own and not the
Fuehrer's code which triumphs. —

"ESCAPE," by Ethel Vance.
There is something about Nazi
Germany that seems to inspire our
fiction writers. It would be the un
usual author who did not see the
juicy opportunities for a timely and
lucrative book about innocent men
and women struggling against the
evil forces of National Socialism.
In the past year or two there have
been many such books, but only
two have been at all outstanding.
One of these was the now classic
"Address Unknown," and the other
is the new noVel, "Escape," by Ethel
Vance. The two books are hardly
comparable since they have dealt
with entirely different characters
and plots, but they have one feature
in common—understatement.
