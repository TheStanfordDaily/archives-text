# Wilbur, Dean Support Big Game Dance Project
## One-third of Men Students Pledge Support to Off-campus Affair 
### 
In a poll of campus living groups yesterday, one-third of Stanford's'
male population contacted said they would attend an inexpensive Big
Game night celebration. At the same time, I)r. Ray Lyman Wiluur, Dean
Mary Yost, and Dean John Bunn stated they were enthusiastically in favor
of an off-campus A.S.S.U.-sponsored dance following the Cal game.
Dean Yost and Dean Bunn agreed that offirial approval should he with
held until more definite plans are formulated as to the place, price, food

and policing. Dr. Wilbur expressed
his favor through the Deans' offices,
but also delayed official sanction.
"It is an excellent idea," said Miss
Yost, "but can only be regarded as
a special concession for Big Game
night." Dean Bunn said he believed
that students would have a better
time at an A.S.S.U. dance and that
people would attend who could not
afford to celebrate the game before.
The Dean of Men suggested that
any financial gain go toward the
boathouse fund or that the dance be
on a co-operative basis with profits
refunded to those attending.
CANVASS RESIDENCES
At the same time Ned Pugh, as
sisted by members of Cardinals and
Rally Committee, canvassed frater
nities and eating clubs to determine
student opinion. Out of 644 of the
840 Row residents contacted, 167 said
they would like an inexpensive
dance Big Game night. Twenty-five
per cent of the Row men favored
the idea, with some fraternities of
fering 50 per cent support.
In the eating clubs 40 per ccnt of
the men said they would attend the
proposed A.S.S.U. dance, 64 out of
150 contacted endorsing th». plan.
While Encina men interviewed were
in favor of the plan, Pugh said the
entire hall would be questioned to
day by Jack Alltucker. '
"There are still 900 hall men, in
cluding Encina, to be contacted,"
stated Pugh, "and since there is no
way to interview the independents,
it is assumed they arc of the same
opinion as the other hall men."

proposed A.S.S.U. dance, 64 out of
150 contacted endorsing th». plan.
While Encina men interviewed were
in favor of the plan, Pugh said the
entire hall would be questioned to
day by Jack Alltucker. '
"There are still 900 hall men, in
cluding Encina, to be contacted,"
stated Pugh, "and since there is no
way to interview the independents,
it is assumed they arc of the same
opinion as the other hall men."
LIVINGSTON'S IDEA
The idea of an off-campus Big
Game dance costing about five dol
lars a couple, to be held at some
Peninsula country club with break
fast or supper served, was brought
up at Cardinals' meeting Wednes
day night by Daily Editor Larry
Livingston through A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Ken Cuthbertson.
In a poll of campus living groups yesterday, one-third of Stanford's'
male population contacted said they would attend an inexpensive Big
Game night celebration. At the same time, I)r. Ray Lyman Wiluur, Dean
Mary Yost, and Dean John Bunn stated they were enthusiastically in favor
of an off-campus A.S.S.U.-sponsored dance following the Cal game.
Dean Yost and Dean Bunn agreed that offirial approval should he with
held until more definite plans are formulated as to the place, price, food

and policing. Dr. Wilbur expressed
his favor through the Deans' offices,
but also delayed official sanction.
"It is an excellent idea," said Miss
Yost, "but can only be regarded as
a special concession for Big Game
night." Dean Bunn said he believed
that students would have a better
time at an A.S.S.U. dance and that
people would attend who could not
afford to celebrate the game before.
The Dean of Men suggested that
any financial gain go toward the
boathouse fund or that the dance be
on a co-operative basis with profits
refunded to those attending.
CANVASS RESIDENCES
At the same time Ned Pugh, as
sisted by members of Cardinals and
Rally Committee, canvassed frater
nities and eating clubs to determine
student opinion. Out of 644 of the
840 Row residents contacted, 167 said
they would like an inexpensive
dance Big Game night. Twenty-five
per cent of the Row men favored
the idea, with some fraternities of
fering 50 per cent support.
In the eating clubs 40 per ccnt of
the men said they would attend the
proposed A.S.S.U. dance, 64 out of
150 contacted endorsing th». plan.
