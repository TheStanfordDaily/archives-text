### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
[VIAYBE it's just a rumor, one of
the thousands that have filtered
out of a tense, war-scared Europe.
Maybe it's just a straw that Nazi
chieftains hope to grasp in their at
tempt to ward off a long and disas
trous continental fight.
But yesterday reports were drift
ing around Berlin that some great
"neutral mediator" would step out
of the blue and settle the entire
struggle. The Hitler-men were con
temptuously dismissing the first
negative replies to the Fuehrer's
peace ultimatum with the further
allegation that London and Paris
governments are misrepresenting
the "real desires for peace" among
the British and French people.
A* »K *
There obviously could be only
one "great neutral mediator."
That would be President Roose
velt. And, although Roosevelt's
bands are full with the special
session of Congress and the local
political dog-fights over neutral
ity revision, the argument that he
might take a band in settling
World War II has sonic credence.
One consideration would preclude
all others, however. The President
would be certain, in his own mind
at least, that such meddling in the
affairs of the continent would in no
way embroil the United States in an
extra-territorial struggle.
* * *
the example of Roosevelt
the First to aim for, the Presi
dent might like to land a Nobel
Peace Prize. Teddy did it in 1906,
a year after the Treaty of Ports
mouth. On that occasion he invited
Russia and Japan to settle their dif
ferences in New Hampshire. He
didn't take an active part in the
peace proceedings. All he did was
furnish the site and send out the
invitations. The rest followed. And
so did the Nobel award.
* * *
It was as simple as all that. He
earned the respect of the civilized
world and the thanks of two em
battled nations. Of course the
conditions are infinitely different
today, but the idea of cinching his
claim to the title of Senior States
man might be attractive to Frank
lin Roosevelt. That's why there's
an outside chance that he may
take a hand in any peace pro
ceedings that may develop in the
next week—if lie can manage it
with no risk to the United States.
Probably, though, the rumors are
inspired by Nazi leaders, clinging to
the vanishing will-o'-the-wisp of a
European settlement. Hitler, how
ever, is willing to wait, ten days or
two weeks for diplomatic activity to
get under way on his plan for end
ing the five-week-old war. He seems
to expect "a clear answer because he
made a clear offer."
* * *
Even though they can't avoid
being somewhat chagrined at the
curt, deprecatory replies that the
Fuehrer's speech brought from
London and Paris, the Nazi offi
cials stressed the favorable re
action it received in friendly axis
capitals—namely Rome and Ma
drid. They sought to convey to
the German people the impression
that the whole neutral world is
solidly behind the Nazi offer.
Of course, Hitler still has made no
definite "cease-fighting" overtures,
though he's supposedly willing to
elaborate on his plans for an imme
diate armistice and international
conference.
The German newspapers have
made not a single mention of Roose
velt's role as a mediator. They're not
at all sure that, the Roosevelt sug
gestion will be received at all fa
vorably and they'd hate to risk a
public snubbing by any premature
publication at home of the pro
posals.
Just the same, constant hints are
being bandied around by influential
Nazis referring to the extreme de
sirability of the President's inter
vention.

It was as simple as all that. He
earned the respect of the civilized
world and the thanks of two em

conditions are infinitely different
today, but the idea of cinching his
claim to the title of Senior States
man might be attractive to Frank

an outside chance that he may
take a hand in any peace pro
ceedings that may develop in the
next week—if lie can manage it
with no risk to the United States.
Probably, though, the rumors are
inspired by Nazi leaders, clinging to
the vanishing will-o'-the-wisp of a
European settlement. Hitler, how
ever, is willing to wait, ten days or
two weeks for diplomatic activity to
get under way on his plan for end
ing the five-week-old war. He seems
to expect "a clear answer because he
made a clear offer."

Even though they can't avoid
being somewhat chagrined at the
curt, deprecatory replies that the
Fuehrer's speech brought from
London and Paris, the Nazi offi
cials stressed the favorable re
action it received in friendly axis
capitals—namely Rome and Ma
drid. They sought to convey to
the German people the impression
that the whole neutral world is
solidly behind the Nazi offer.
Of course, Hitler still has made no
definite "cease-fighting" overtures,
though he's supposedly willing to
elaborate on his plans for an imme
diate armistice and international
conference.
The German newspapers have
made not a single mention of Roose
velt's role as a mediator. They're not
at all sure that, the Roosevelt sug

publication at home of the pro

Just the same, constant hints are
being bandied around by influential
Nazis referring to the extreme de

[VIAYBE it's just a rumor, one of

Maybe it's just a straw that Nazi
chieftains hope to grasp in their at

But yesterday reports were drift
ing around Berlin that some great
"neutral mediator" would step out
of the blue and settle the entire
struggle. The Hitler-men were con

peace ultimatum with the further
allegation that London and Paris
governments are misrepresenting
the "real desires for peace" among
the British and French people.

There obviously could be only
one "great neutral mediator."
That would be President Roose

bands are full with the special
session of Congress and the local
political dog-fights over neutral
ity revision, the argument that he
might take a band in settling
World War II has sonic credence.
One consideration would preclude
all others, however. The President
