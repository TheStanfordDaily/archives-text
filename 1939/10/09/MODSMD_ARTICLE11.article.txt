# Fire Chief Fathers 14 'Station Boys'
## 
### BUD AMES 
"Am I married? Sure, I'm mar
ried; don't I look like it? Have I
got any children? You bet your
boots; 14 of them—all these boys
who live here in the station—and a
mascot."
Fire Chief Robert E. Dugan, step
father to Stanford's firehouse boys,
looked down at a cigarette case he
was flipping over and over in his
hand and smiled a smile as Irish
as his name.
"Yes, I've been father to the sta
tion boys since '23 when I first came
to the campus from the San Fran
cisco fire department. I fought fires
for 18 years up there, shifting from
company to company, working, in
particular, on the high pressure
water system. That system was in
stalled after the '06 earthquake and
fire which, incidentally, was the
worst blaze I ever went thi'ough."
CHIEF INTERRUPTED
Dugan was interrupted by his 14
foster children, each l-eminding him
of some story that he, the chief, had
told—often with his tongue in his
cheek — concerning his experiences
with the fire department. The chief
laughed again but balked when ask
ed to repeat these experiences for
publication. Well then, would he
admit any bad habits?
"My only bad habit is smoking
about 50 cigarettes a day," he ad
mitted obligingly, "and eating and
sleeping. But the boys here in the
station dgn't have any bad habits.
They've either got to be good or
get out. We won't stand for any
monkey business around here." For
the first time the chief's smile was
gone. His children ceased their
chattering and were silent, for a
moment.
NO OPINION EXPRESSED
His smile soon returned. "But
these lads in the station are a won
derful bunch. They work hard and
although they aren't up to the stand
ards of professional fire fighters they
are as efficient as can be expected.
And our scholastic average is very
high," he added with emphasis.
Did the chief wish to express any
opinion concerning the relative
merits of the Roble and Lagunita
women who passed before the fire
house doors every day? He did not
—he was married. And besides, the
rest of the lads were always stand
ing in the door looking themselves
so he couldn't see much. Did he
have any preference for any movie
actress? No, he thought they all
looked alike except that some were
worse than the rest.
What had he to say about the
activities of this. Fire Prevention
Week. "I only expect the co-opera
tion of the campus in getting rid of
all useless inflamamble materials
such as boxes and oily rags, which
may cause spontaneous combustion.
We must keep the campus fire pre
vention up to its present standard
of 95 per cent. That's it in a nut
shell."
When questioned as to which cam
pus fire, in his estimation, was the
most serious, he hesitated a moment,
then named the burning of the Sigma
Chi house.
"Have I ever been burned se
riously. Yes, lots of times. That's
how I got scalped." By way of ex
planation he raised his chief's hat
which he had been wearing up to
this time, and pointed to the bald
spot on his head.
It was the signal for his children
to begin chattering again, and they
were still talking as they moved
across the street to their new fire
truck to begin "hose drill."

across the street to their new fire
truck to begin "hose drill."
"Am I married? Sure, I'm mar
ried; don't I look like it? Have I
got any children? You bet your
boots; 14 of them—all these boys
who live here in the station—and a
mascot."
Fire Chief Robert E. Dugan, step
father to Stanford's firehouse boys,
looked down at a cigarette case he
was flipping over and over in his
hand and smiled a smile as Irish
as his name.
"Yes, I've been father to the sta
tion boys since '23 when I first came
to the campus from the San Fran
cisco fire department. I fought fires
for 18 years up there, shifting from
company to company, working, in
particular, on the high pressure
water system. That system was in
stalled after the '06 earthquake and
fire which, incidentally, was the
worst blaze I ever went thi'ough."
CHIEF INTERRUPTED
Dugan was interrupted by his 14
foster children, each l-eminding him
of some story that he, the chief, had
told—often with his tongue in his
cheek — concerning his experiences
with the fire department. The chief
laughed again but balked when ask
ed to repeat these experiences for
publication. Well then, would he
admit any bad habits?
"My only bad habit is smoking
about 50 cigarettes a day," he ad
mitted obligingly, "and eating and
sleeping. But the boys here in the
station dgn't have any bad habits.
They've either got to be good or
get out. We won't stand for any
monkey business around here." For
the first time the chief's smile was
gone. His children ceased their
chattering and were silent, for a
moment.
NO OPINION EXPRESSED
His smile soon returned. "But
these lads in the station are a won
derful bunch. They work hard and
although they aren't up to the stand
ards of professional fire fighters they
are as efficient as can be expected.
And our scholastic average is very
high," he added with emphasis.
Did the chief wish to express any
opinion concerning the relative
merits of the Roble and Lagunita
women who passed before the fire
house doors every day? He did not
—he was married. And besides, the
rest of the lads were always stand
ing in the door looking themselves
so he couldn't see much. Did he
have any preference for any movie
actress? No, he thought they all
looked alike except that some were
worse than the rest.
What had he to say about the
activities of this. Fire Prevention
Week. "I only expect the co-opera
tion of the campus in getting rid of
all useless inflamamble materials
such as boxes and oily rags, which
may cause spontaneous combustion.
We must keep the campus fire pre
vention up to its present standard
of 95 per cent. That's it in a nut
shell."
When questioned as to which cam
pus fire, in his estimation, was the
most serious, he hesitated a moment,
then named the burning of the Sigma
Chi house.
"Have I ever been burned se
riously. Yes, lots of times. That's
how I got scalped." By way of ex
planation he raised his chief's hat
which he had been wearing up to
this time, and pointed to the bald
spot on his head.
It was the signal for his children
to begin chattering again, and they
were still talking as they moved
across the street to their new fire
truck to begin "hose drill."
