# Neutral Nations Guard Against Speedy Invasion; Finns Reject Proposals
## Non-belligerent Powers Fearful Of Security as Hitler's 'Armistice' Is Apparently Doomed to Failure 
### United Press 
The neutral nations of Europe took far-reaching military measures'
today (Monday) to guard themselves against any lightning invasions or
domination by the great powers as fighting among the belligerents came
almost to a dead stop.
Neutrals from the Arctic to the Alps were fearful of their security as
they faced the prospects of a long war resulting from the apparent failure

of Adolf Hitler to put across his
final proposal for peaceâ€”an armi
stice, an international conference
and disarmament.
Finland held the spotlight among
the non-belligerent powers because
it appeared that after 10 days, during
which the small Baltic states capitu
lated to the military and economic
demands of Soviet Russia, the Finns
were standing up ruggedly, if not
defiantly, to Josef Stalin.
RUSSIA MAKES DEMANDS
Russia is understood to want Fin
land to agree to Soviet fortification
of three Finnish Islands near Rus
sia's Kronstadt naval base in the
Gulf of Finland. Russia also wants
the strategic Finnish port of Kotka,
it is reported.
From Moscow it was reported that
anouncement of a mutual assistance
treaty and trade agreement with
Lithuania may be made today,
bringing the last of the small Baltic
states under Soviet domination.
The growing danger to Europe's
neutrals was shown early Sunday
when the 6,800-ton Dutch freighter
Binnendikj, bound from New York
to Amsterdam, was sunk by an ex
plosion in the English Channel.
FUEHRER HOPES FOR PEACE
Hitler still hoped that his Friday
speech before the German Reichstag
offering a "long-range peace" would
end the war, although the reaction
of Britain and France remained
anything but hopeful.
Nazis contemptuously dismissed
the negative Allied reaction with the
allegation that the Anglo - French
governments were misrepresenting
the "real desire for peace" exist
ing among the British and French
people.
The Nazis hoped that President
Roosevelt would take up Hitler's
proposals and emerge as a neutral
mediator to bring about an armi
stice and international conference.
But the President showed no incli
nation to act on Hitler's bid.
QUIET ON WESTERN FRONT
So far as the war itself was con
cerned, there was a Sabbath lull
broken only by patrol skirmishes on
the western front in the Wanidt
Forest between Saarbruecken and
Saarlautern and a French push on
beyond the Borg Forest at the north
tip of the front near the Luxem
bourg border.
The British announced that a
squadron of their scouting planes
shot down a German seaplane in a
battle over the North Sea and then
directed a nearby ship to the rescue
of the German crew, clinging to the
floating wreckage of the Nazi craft.
The United States refugee liner
Iroquois, which the commander-in
chief of the German navy warned
would be sunk as it entered Ameri
can waters, was under escort, by a
flotilla of destroyers and a U.S.
Coast Guard boat, the Navy De
partment in Washington announced.
