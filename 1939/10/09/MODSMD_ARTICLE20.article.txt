# Senate Debate On Neutrality Nears Climax
## Administration Eager To Force Decision; Isolationists Strong 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 (UP).—The
Senate enters the second week of
debate on the neutrality revision
bill tomorrow with administration
leaders claiming G5 votes and eager
to force a final decision.
The vote on the motion by Sen.
Charles W. Tobey, R., N.H., to re
commit the bill with instructions to
the Foreign Relations Committee
to separate repeal of the arms em
bargo from other intended safe
guards, may indicate the compara
tive strength of the isolationist and
administration forces.
Leaders of these factions, how
ever, do not regard it as a test vote.
A better test, it is said, will come
on an attempt to strike from the bill
a provision empowering President
Roosevelt to authorize 90-day cred
its to foreign purchasers of Ameri
can arms, ammunition, war mate
rials and other products .
MOTION COMES UP
The Tobey motion is scheduled to
come up for a vote tomorrow under
a gentleman's agreement between
(he New Hampshire Republican and
Senate Majority Leader Alben W.
Barkley, D., Ky. It was reported
that Tobey had been importuned by
isolationist leaders, anxious to pre
vent a defeat at this stage of the de
bate because of its effect on back
home sympathizers on whom they
are counting heavily to sway doubt
ful senatox-s, to withdraw his pro
posal.
It is known that at least one top
flight isolationist pleaded in vain
with Tobey not to introduce it, and
that afterward 12 senators fighting
the administration's program dis
cussed whether they should support
the motion en bloc, but were unable
to agree.
TOBEY BROADCASTS
Tobey in an address over the Na
tional Broadcasting Company net
work appealed to listeners to bar
rage their senators with telegrams
and mail in support of his motion.
He argued that defeat of the motion
and subsequent lengthy debate on
the entire bill "may mean the dif
ference between our being forced
into the war or kept out of it."
The neutrality issue also comes
before the House tomorrow, with
the Administration bill being at
tacked by Rep. Hamilton Fish of
New York, ranking Republican
member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee, and defended by Rep.
Clifton Woodrum, D., Va., strong
man of the appropriations commit
tee. Woodrum said that if the meas
ure passes the Senate by a reason
ably heavy vote, it will be approved
by the House.

guards, may indicate the compara
tive strength of the isolationist and
administration forces.
Leaders of these factions, how
ever, do not regard it as a test vote.
A better test, it is said, will come
on an attempt to strike from the bill
a provision empowering President
Roosevelt to authorize 90-day cred
its to foreign purchasers of Ameri
can arms, ammunition, war mate
rials and other products .
MOTION COMES UP
The Tobey motion is scheduled to
come up for a vote tomorrow under
a gentleman's agreement between
(he New Hampshire Republican and
Senate Majority Leader Alben W.
Barkley, D., Ky. It was reported
that Tobey had been importuned by
isolationist leaders, anxious to pre
vent a defeat at this stage of the de
bate because of its effect on back
home sympathizers on whom they
are counting heavily to sway doubt
ful senatox-s, to withdraw his pro
posal.
It is known that at least one top
flight isolationist pleaded in vain
with Tobey not to introduce it, and
that afterward 12 senators fighting
the administration's program dis
cussed whether they should support
the motion en bloc, but were unable
to agree.
TOBEY BROADCASTS
Tobey in an address over the Na
tional Broadcasting Company net
work appealed to listeners to bar
rage their senators with telegrams
and mail in support of his motion.
He argued that defeat of the motion
and subsequent lengthy debate on
the entire bill "may mean the dif
ference between our being forced
into the war or kept out of it."
The neutrality issue also comes
before the House tomorrow, with
the Administration bill being at
tacked by Rep. Hamilton Fish of
New York, ranking Republican
member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee, and defended by Rep.
Clifton Woodrum, D., Va., strong
man of the appropriations commit
tee. Woodrum said that if the meas
ure passes the Senate by a reason
ably heavy vote, it will be approved
by the House.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 (UP).—The
Senate enters the second week of
debate on the neutrality revision
bill tomorrow with administration
leaders claiming G5 votes and eager
to force a final decision.
The vote on the motion by Sen.
Charles W. Tobey, R., N.H., to re
commit the bill with instructions to
the Foreign Relations Committee
to separate repeal of the arms em
bargo from other intended safe
guards, may indicate the compara
tive strength of the isolationist and
administration forces.
