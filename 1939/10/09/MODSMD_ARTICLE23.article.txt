# Crowds Reach Record Mark At Exposition
## 200,000 Visit Fair; Attempt Disclosed To Continue in 1940 
### 
TREASURE ISLAND, San Fran
cisco, Oct. 8 (UP). —All attendance
records at the Golden Gate Inter
national Exposition were eclipsed
today when nearly 200,000 visitors
got inside the turnstiles and no one
knows how many more were turned
away.
Exposition officials thought the
opening day crowd last February of
128,097 would be an all-time record.
They were totally unprepared for
the avalanche of humanity that tried
to see the fair today.
At 7:30 p.m. the total had reached
184,964 official admissions.
The fair knew it had a headache
in store when the enormous parking
lot was filled up at noon with more
than 17,000 cars. The toll gates had
passed 112,636 persons at 2 p.m. and
leaped to 130,276 by 2:30. The turn
si iles whirled dizzily, with 165,159
at 4 p.m. and thousands more being
turned away as they tried to drive
onto the San Francisco-Oakland
Bay bridge.
Hotelmen and business leaders
were being canvassed in the bay
area for financial support toward
opening of the fair next year. Pro
moters hoped that sufficient funds
could be subscribed in San Francisco
and Los Angeles to reopen Treasure
Island next year for several months.
