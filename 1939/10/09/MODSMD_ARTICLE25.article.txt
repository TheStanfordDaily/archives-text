### 
REMICII. Luxembourg, Oct. 8 (UP). —Entrenched German positions
were attacked tonight by French forces attempting to push on to Trier, be
lieved by the French general staff to he one of the weakest links in the
Siegfried Line.
The lighting, which began at 8 p.m., was a resumption of a battle which

ended at dawn. The skirmish eased,
after an hour of heavy fighting be
tween outposts.
There was a normal Sunday truce
this morning, with only a few ar
tillery bursts all day. This after
noon, as the Remich amateur football
team played on its field bordering
the Moselle River almost the entire
garrison of the village of Vies across
the stream turned out and watched
the game from the other bank, en
thusiastically applauding. The Lux
embourg crowd politely left the
river side of the field clear for the
German soldiers to watch.
RULES OBSERVED
Although the crowded soldiers ob
viously were visible to French bat
teries of 75's stationed atop Borg
Hill, the rules of the game were ob
served and there was no firing.
The battle resumed tonight at the
point where it was discontinued at
sunrise. From the gunfire flashes it
could be seen that the Flench were
pointing their forces in the direction
of Thorn, the village across the Mo
selle from Remich.
The silence of Friday and Satur
day ended last night at midnight as
heavily armed patrols clashed in the
Borg Forest and continued close
range fighting, in some cases hand
to hand, throughout the night.
USE DEADLY MORTARS
Artillery was not used, as the
troops were too close for safe firing,
but deadly trench mortars were
brought into play. Their thunderous
explosions punctured the intermit
tent battle of machine guns and
rifles.
From the flashes in the darkness
it appeared that French infantry,
operating from the cover of the Borg
Forest, had crept down through the
Wochern woods and attacked the
German trenches defending the
Nening-Tettingen road.
FIGIIT NEARS QUARRY
The fighting appeared to center
around the quarries behind Nennig,
which the Germans have fortified
heavily. From there they sent over
deadly trench mortar fire.
The French patrol, which appeared
to number about 100, maintained an
intense fire throughout the night,
with the Germans responding hotly.

it appeared that French infantry,
operating from the cover of the Borg
Forest, had crept down through the
Wochern woods and attacked the
German trenches defending the
Nening-Tettingen road.
FIGIIT NEARS QUARRY
The fighting appeared to center
around the quarries behind Nennig,
which the Germans have fortified
heavily. From there they sent over
deadly trench mortar fire.
The French patrol, which appeared
to number about 100, maintained an
intense fire throughout the night,
with the Germans responding hotly.
REMICII. Luxembourg, Oct. 8 (UP). —Entrenched German positions
were attacked tonight by French forces attempting to push on to Trier, be
lieved by the French general staff to he one of the weakest links in the
Siegfried Line.
The lighting, which began at 8 p.m., was a resumption of a battle which

ended at dawn. The skirmish eased,
after an hour of heavy fighting be
tween outposts.
There was a normal Sunday truce
this morning, with only a few ar
tillery bursts all day. This after
noon, as the Remich amateur football
team played on its field bordering
the Moselle River almost the entire
garrison of the village of Vies across
the stream turned out and watched
the game from the other bank, en
thusiastically applauding. The Lux
embourg crowd politely left the
river side of the field clear for the
German soldiers to watch.
RULES OBSERVED
Although the crowded soldiers ob
viously were visible to French bat
teries of 75's stationed atop Borg
Hill, the rules of the game were ob
served and there was no firing.
The battle resumed tonight at the
point where it was discontinued at
sunrise. From the gunfire flashes it
could be seen that the Flench were
pointing their forces in the direction
of Thorn, the village across the Mo
selle from Remich.
The silence of Friday and Satur
day ended last night at midnight as
heavily armed patrols clashed in the
Borg Forest and continued close
range fighting, in some cases hand
to hand, throughout the night.
USE DEADLY MORTARS
Artillery was not used, as the
troops were too close for safe firing,
but deadly trench mortars were
brought into play. Their thunderous
explosions punctured the intermit
tent battle of machine guns and
rifles.
From the flashes in the darkness
it appeared that French infantry,
operating from the cover of the Borg
