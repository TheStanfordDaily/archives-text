Following the tradition of after
game dances, the student body of
Westwood has been invited to the
dance to make it an inter-school
affair. Word from the south indi
cates that there will be many Bruin
students present, said Pugh.
Ozzie Seacrest, who played at the
U.C.L.A. dance two years ago, has
been signed by Cardinals to play
this Saturday. Bids for the dance,
which will last from 9 to 12 o'clock,
are on sale at the A.S.S.U. office for
$1 each.
CARDINALS HEAD DANCE
Cardinals has been given charge
of the dance by the A.S.S.U. with
Ned Pugh, chairman for all Cardinals
dances, assisted by Jack Alltucker
and Sue Hyman.
At the same time as the U.C.L.A.
dance was being scheduled, plans
were going ahead for the proposed
off-campus dance Big Game night.
After a canvass of opinion in En
cina, Jack Alltucker reported to
Cardinals that 50 per cent of the
men in the dining hall favored the
idea of a five-dollar celebration.
BIG GAME DANCE PLANS
Ken Koch, chairman of Cardinals,
said that the California Country
Club in Burlingame is being consid
ered for the dance and a committee
is considering the serving of a sup
per or breakfast. A big name band
will be contacted through the Mu
sicians Corporation of America, but
it is not known yet what orchestras
will be available then.
Dean Mary Yost and Dean John
Bunn, who were enthusiastically in
favor of the plan of an off-campus,
inexpensive celebration, have with
held their official approval until
more definite plans have been made
as to place, food, and policing.
"We will make our decision as
soon as we have the report from Ken
Cuthbertson and Coline Upshaw,"
Miss Yost said yesterday.
