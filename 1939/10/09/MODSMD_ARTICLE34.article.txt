# Aerial Attack Looms For Card-Bruin Battle
## Pass Defense Session on Tap For Card Gridders 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
There arc one or two consolations
after the 10-0 setback of our In
dians by Oregon.
The scores are going down, the
Q.C.L.A. should be ripe for Tiny
Thornhill's gridders, who ought to
be .so i red by next Saturday that
they 1! do some long-awaited pay
dirl ti adding themselves.
Sharing the Pacific Coast Confer
ence lead with Oregon State, the
Bruins meet Stanford here this
week-end in the conference head
liner. The Uclans polished off Jim
my Phelan's Washington outfit, 14-7,
with an aerial bombardment of
their own.
PASSES EMPHASIZED
With that in mind, Thornhill will
have to put the Indians through
some extra long sessions this week
if they are to be ready for the third
consecutive air-minded team they've
met.
Although Tex Oliver's slippery
backs rolled up 141 yards from
scrimmage—a good many of those
yards from that lake reverse over
the weak side and at Stanford's in
experienced tackles, the inabilty of
the Red backs to break up Oregon's
pass combination of Bob Smith to
•lay Craybeal proved devastating.
At the same time Stanford's own
passers were tied up, and for the sec
ond straight game the attack which
was supposed to help out in emer
gencies failed to pull through.
SUPPOSED WEAKNESS
Word that our Indians' pass de
fense is not quite what it should be
probably has already reached the
ears of "Babe" Horrell, Bruin coach,
who'll undoubtedly send his bullet
passer Ken Washington out to test
that weakness.
In the clutches Saturday Stan
ford's line held up exceptionally
well, especially the left side bul
warked by Acting - Captain Stan
Anderson and Hamp Pool. At right
tackle inexperience raised havoc as
Oregon's sucker plays punctured the
line continuously. Even at that, the
line play of Graff and Stojkovich,
Andersen, Pool, and Donahue and
the stubborn resistance of the two
right tackles, Johansen and Trout,
brought cheer to the coaching corps
with the 45 yards they caused Ore
gon to lose from scrimmage.

Stanford's own runing attack just
didn't have enough Norm Standlee
in the backfield. The "big chief"
packed the ball all over Multnomah
stadium lor 71 yards—more yardage
than the two leading Webfoot ball
packers. Graybeal and Stenstrom,
were able to run up—and he looked
all of the A-l line cracker everyone
said he'd be this year. On pass de
fense Standlee did some fancy work
to keep Bob Smith's pitches from
connecting when the Webfoots
threatened to score in the third pe
riod.
When the Uclans invade the sta
dium next Saturday, they'll be head
ed by Jackie Robinson and Kenny
Washington, Negro backs, who
streaked up and down the Husky
gridiron for an aggregate of nearly
200 yards. U.C.L.A. line play was
sure and especially hard to crack as
the Huskies made only 82 yards all
afternoon through Zarubica, Fraw
ley, Sommers and company lines
men. It sounds already as if it is go
ing to be tough for both teams' backs
to make much headway through the
lines. They're both tough, so maybe
it'll be an aerial circus on tap Sat
urday.

Sharing the Pacific Coast Confer

liner. The Uclans polished off Jim

with an aerial bombardment of
their own.
PASSES EMPHASIZED
With that in mind, Thornhill will
have to put the Indians through
some extra long sessions this week
if they are to be ready for the third
consecutive air-minded team they've
met.
Although Tex Oliver's slippery
backs rolled up 141 yards from
scrimmage—a good many of those
yards from that lake reverse over
the weak side and at Stanford's in
experienced tackles, the inabilty of
the Red backs to break up Oregon's
pass combination of Bob Smith to
•lay Craybeal proved devastating.
At the same time Stanford's own
passers were tied up, and for the sec
ond straight game the attack which
was supposed to help out in emer
gencies failed to pull through.
SUPPOSED WEAKNESS
Word that our Indians' pass de
fense is not quite what it should be
probably has already reached the
ears of "Babe" Horrell, Bruin coach,
who'll undoubtedly send his bullet
passer Ken Washington out to test
that weakness.
In the clutches Saturday Stan
ford's line held up exceptionally
well, especially the left side bul
warked by Acting - Captain Stan
Anderson and Hamp Pool. At right
tackle inexperience raised havoc as
Oregon's sucker plays punctured the
line continuously. Even at that, the
line play of Graff and Stojkovich,
Andersen, Pool, and Donahue and
the stubborn resistance of the two
right tackles, Johansen and Trout,
brought cheer to the coaching corps
with the 45 yards they caused Ore
gon to lose from scrimmage.

Stanford's own runing attack just
didn't have enough Norm Standlee
in the backfield. The "big chief"
packed the ball all over Multnomah
stadium lor 71 yards—more yardage
than the two leading Webfoot ball
packers. Graybeal and Stenstrom,
were able to run up—and he looked
all of the A-l line cracker everyone
said he'd be this year. On pass de
fense Standlee did some fancy work
to keep Bob Smith's pitches from
connecting when the Webfoots
threatened to score in the third pe
riod.
When the Uclans invade the sta
dium next Saturday, they'll be head
ed by Jackie Robinson and Kenny
Washington, Negro backs, who
streaked up and down the Husky
gridiron for an aggregate of nearly
200 yards. U.C.L.A. line play was
sure and especially hard to crack as
the Huskies made only 82 yards all
afternoon through Zarubica, Fraw
ley, Sommers and company lines
men. It sounds already as if it is go
ing to be tough for both teams' backs
to make much headway through the
lines. They're both tough, so maybe
it'll be an aerial circus on tap Sat
urday.
There arc one or two consolations
after the 10-0 setback of our In
dians by Oregon.
The scores are going down, the
Q.C.L.A. should be ripe for Tiny
Thornhill's gridders, who ought to
be .so i red by next Saturday that
they 1! do some long-awaited pay
