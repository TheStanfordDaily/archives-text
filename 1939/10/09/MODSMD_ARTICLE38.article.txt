# Yanks Dump Cincinnati 7-4, Win Fourth Straight Series
## 
### 
CROSLEY FIELD. CINCINNATI. ().. Oct. X (UP).—All the kings
horses and all the king's men couldn't halt the New York Yankees today
as they battered and broyybeat the Cincinnati Reds for the fourth straight
time to take their second consecutive world's championship in four

straight games.
Manager Bill McKechnie of the
Reds played every card at his dis
posal on this hot Sunday afternoon
; before another rabid hometown
j crowd of 32.794. but in the end the
Yankee juggernaut smashed the Na
tional League champions to smither
j eens in scoring a 7-4 triumph in .10
innings.
RALLIES PROVE FUTILE
The Reds were on the verge of
I triumph, but their spirited rallies in
the seventh and eighth eventually
| proved only futile challenges to the
powerful Yankee machine.
i The Yanks came with a wild rush
in the ninth to tie the score, 4-4.
and then broke through Cincinnati's
i line of defense in the 10th to push
| over three runs on one hit. In these
| two innings the Yanks made the
Reds look like a bunch of frightened
J ball players afraid to have to come
j back to face the murderous Ameri
can League champions any more.
In those last two nightmarish inn
ings, the Reds made four errors,
i committed a throw to the wrong
base, left the ball lying on the
I ground while a Yankee raced over
the plate and generally looked like
j the kind of ball players you'd expect
j to see in the annual game between
, the married men and the bachelors
at a Sunday school picnic, rather
I than champions of one of the major
i leagues.
YANKS SET RECORD
By winning today Ihe Yanks be
j came world's champions for the
| ninth time. Four of these cham
| pionships were won in the minimum
'of four straight games. Today's tri-
I umph also marked the Yanks 28th
1 victory in their last 31 World Series
! games since 1926, the last time they
lost one of these annual jousts.
' It also was the fourth consecutive

world's championship captured by
the Yanks—an all-time record.
The Yanks won today with three
of their second-line pitchers — Oral
Hildebrand, Steve Sundra, and John
ny Murphy. Hildebrand held the
Reds to two hits and no runs dur
ing his four-inning stretch, but re
tired at the end of the fourth be
cause of a pain in his side.
MURPHY WINS (iAME
When Hildebrand left the game,
the score was deadlocked. Steve
Sundra, big right-hander who won
11 straight, games during the Amer
ican League .season, replaced Hilde
brand at the slart of the fifth, but
was a victim of the biggest Red
rally of the series in the three-run
Cincinnati seventh and left the
game trailing 4-2.
His successor, Johnny Murphy,
who is the rescue fireman of the.
Yankee staff, became the winning
pitcher when his team-mates came
from behind to win in the last two
frames. He allowed one run and five
hits during his 3 1 j innings on the
mound.

CROSLEY FIELD. CINCINNATI. ().. Oct. X (UP).—All the kings
horses and all the king's men couldn't halt the New York Yankees today
as they battered and broyybeat the Cincinnati Reds for the fourth straight
time to take their second consecutive world's championship in four

straight games.
Manager Bill McKechnie of the
Reds played every card at his dis
posal on this hot Sunday afternoon
; before another rabid hometown
j crowd of 32.794. but in the end the
Yankee juggernaut smashed the Na
tional League champions to smither
j eens in scoring a 7-4 triumph in .10
innings.
RALLIES PROVE FUTILE
The Reds were on the verge of
I triumph, but their spirited rallies in
the seventh and eighth eventually
| proved only futile challenges to the
powerful Yankee machine.
i The Yanks came with a wild rush
in the ninth to tie the score, 4-4.
and then broke through Cincinnati's
i line of defense in the 10th to push
| over three runs on one hit. In these
| two innings the Yanks made the
Reds look like a bunch of frightened
J ball players afraid to have to come
j back to face the murderous Ameri
can League champions any more.
In those last two nightmarish inn
ings, the Reds made four errors,
i committed a throw to the wrong
base, left the ball lying on the
I ground while a Yankee raced over
the plate and generally looked like
j the kind of ball players you'd expect
j to see in the annual game between
, the married men and the bachelors
at a Sunday school picnic, rather
I than champions of one of the major
i leagues.
YANKS SET RECORD
