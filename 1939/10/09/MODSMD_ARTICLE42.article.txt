# Frosh Gridders Swamp Placer In 27-0 Fracas
## Papoose Offensive Clicks; Passes Start Pay Dirt Drives 
### 
Using only two main offensive;
weapons, the forward pass and the
drifter, Stanford's freshman eleven
swept through and over Placer Jim- ;
ior College, 27-0, in last Saturday's;
tilt.
The drifter assignment from the
tailback position was well handled
by either A1 Cole, Milt Vucinich, Bob
Greening, Don Selby or anyone who
happened to be on hand. Though
the backs, Vucinich and Cole in par
ticular, all did good jobs of running,
it was the linesmen that made these 1
drifters really go. Ed McCain, Dick
Palmer, Bruno Banducci, George I
Robinson, and Tony Medvord spent
most of the afternoon ripping gap- I
ing holes in the Jaysee line.
All Card scoring originated from
either a pass or a drifter. Alter a ;
fairly even first quarter, Red Robin
son gave the Papooses possession on
their own 47 on the return of a par
tially blocked Jaysee punt. Cole
drifted off right tackle for 3 and
then tossed to Robinson, who caught
the ball on the 20 and carried to the
invaders 10.
Coach Harry Shipkey's team was
hit by two injuries, neither of which
were very serious. Bill Mannon. !
starting center, sprained again an !
ankle which has been bothering him !
during the week. And Red Taylor
got a muscle cramp late in the game.
