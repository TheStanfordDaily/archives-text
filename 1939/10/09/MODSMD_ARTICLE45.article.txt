# With Faltering Hand

### 
THE war is in danger of becoming boring.
That statement, falling into a microphone
last week from the lips of a nameless news com
mentator, spelled more hope for the United
States than anything short of an impending
armistice. For an American public that is losing
interest in the war is not going to get excited
enough to want to fight in it.
Herr Hitler certainly has done his share to
ward putting on a good show. The announce
ment of the Nazi-Soviet pact made a more-than
rousing overture; the German army plunged
suddenly into the first act, ruthlessly and speed
ily conguered Poland, and was ready to ring
down the curtain on a brilliant performance
when the Fuehrer made his peace plea last
Friday.
Mr. Chamberlain is not a showman.
The only dramatic event that has taken place
west of Poland is the sinking of the Athenia,
for which Herr Hitler probably was responsible,
although some would give a wily British navy
the credit. The slow, apparently half-hearted
Allied drive on the Western Front scarcely de
serves to be mentioned in the same class with
such a thrilling exhibition.
Mr. Chamberlain is not a showman, the hope
ful claim, but he is carefully preparing Britain
for a strategically planned offensive that will
break the Nazi grip on the Continent.
Then why is he waiting until the German
army has completed the subjugation of Poland
and is able to turn its undivided attention to the
west? The hopeful are silent.
Is it possible that Mr. Chamberlain's heart is
not in this war?
There are those who will tell us that this is
the case.
Following the stop-gap Peace of Munich,
which protected an unprepared Britain at Cze
choslovakia's expense, the Prime Minister spent
months and millions trying to introduce his
appeasement policy to success. He made every
possible concession to Nazi Germany at this
time, but a few months later, when negotiations
for a London-Moscow pact were in progress, he
allowed every thinkable obstacle to fall in the
way.
Can it be true that Mr. Chamberlain, repre
senting as he does the conservative monied
aristocracy, stands in far greater fear of the
threat of Communism invading England than of
Fascism ruling Europe?
Some men claim that he is slow in attacking
the Reich because of his bank-account ideolo
gies; some like Simon Haxey, in his "Tory
M.P.," insist that he actually owns valuable in
terests in five large German factories.
Whether these charges be true or false,
whether his sympathies or his infirmities be the
seat of the trouble, it is certain that Neville
Chamberlain is faltering.
Already he has lost the sympathy and interest
of a great majority of the citizens of the United
3tates.
Americans still waste no love on Herr Hitler.
And they are losing confidence in Mr. Cham
berlain.
Can it be that we are turning neutral?
