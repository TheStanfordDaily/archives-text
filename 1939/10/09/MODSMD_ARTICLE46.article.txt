CARDINALS, energetically developing the
idea of a Big Game night dance, will this
week take enough time off to achieve, con
cretely and immediately, a dance following the
U.C.L.A. game this coming Saturday night.
An inexpensive, on-campus dance after a
Saturday afternoon football game in October
or early November is more or less customary.
Last year the dance came with the U.S.C. game
here; the year before, as this year, it rounded
out U.C.L.A.-game day.
Proceeds from this year's dance will be di
verted to the Boathouse fund, another driplet
in a gradually filling bucket. And, judging
from past years' attendance figures, proceeds
will not be inconsiderable.
The date has been approved, the band is en
gaged, and Cardinals has, no doubt, appointed
committees.
The only thing remaining in the nebulous
future is the actual dance.
And that will take care of itself, for it is really
a natural. The band will be good, the Women's
Gym is a convenient location, the SI per couple
entrance fee is eminently low.
The odds on a high attendance are far more
reasonable than the odds that the Varsity will
push U.C.L.A. out of the stadium.

About the only note of suspense that can be
hung on Saturday's post-game frolic is that, in
a way, the fate of the Big Game dance will de
pend upon a favorable student reception.
Cardinals is trying to boost both dances—
their success or failure in the first will be re
flected in the enthusiasm which they can whip
up for the second.
And if Saturday night's attendance is high,
the student body's chances of swinging around
at a Big- Game dance will be just that much
better.—J, B.
