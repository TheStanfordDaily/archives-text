WAYWAKI) WINDS OF FREEDOM
FATHER COUGHLIN probably has the nation's most
nauseating voice. Few radio announcers, extolling
the love-luring virtues of toothpaste, can even approach
this whip-tongued demagogue in generating disgust.
His voice whispers, pleads, thunders, roars, incites, and
then prays. Each word is uttered as though the orator
fervently believed his every syllable to be a Shake
spearean tragedy. And the hyper-dramatic, affected
result is really enough to disturb the normal digestive
processes of anyone who vainly mines the Father's
mass of words for a copper ounce of logic.
But nearly every owner of a radio has been gifted
by a foresighted Providence with moveable fingers,
and by radio manufacturers with a little dial, which,
when cunningly mastered, provides a means of turning
the radio off. Hence Father Coughlin's bilious voice
should not have been forced off the air on hygienic
grounds.
# $ # Hi
A ND on democratic grounds the move to silence all
"controversial speakers" was even less appropriate.
It is the theory of democratic government that when
all men have a free voice (except to slander) the rule
of the majority will be best achieved. But in times of
political and economic upheaval like our own, people
begin 1 to fear agitators that in times of peace and pros
perity were tolerated. They were tolerated because of
the Bill of Rights and American tradition. But now we
can see that they were also tolerated on the grounds
of political impotence.
When economic and political chaos threatens, when
there is dissatisfaction and unrest, more people will
listen to a demagogue, and more people will try to
silence him. And when the custom of stifling free
speech is established, sincerity may be squelched along
with chicanery. Unfortunately, the toothpaste sales
men alone will still be here to plague us.
All this was pointed out very vividly before the
French Revolution by that philosopher whose name is
near-unutterable because of its spelling! Le Baron
Pierre de Montesquieu. The laws are worthless, said
this French aristocrat, unless the spirit of the people
supports them.
And the world today illustrates his thesis. Where
there is hardship and uncertainty, there is fear. And
where there is fear, there is suppression of liberty.
Free speech does not depend on laws alone. The
groundwork of a lasting democracy must be the satis
faction of its people's wants.

speech is established, sincerity may be squelched along
with chicanery. Unfortunately, the toothpaste sales
men alone will still be here to plague us.
All this was pointed out very vividly before the
French Revolution by that philosopher whose name is
near-unutterable because of its spelling! Le Baron
Pierre de Montesquieu. The laws are worthless, said
this French aristocrat, unless the spirit of the people
supports them.
And the world today illustrates his thesis. Where
there is hardship and uncertainty, there is fear. And
where there is fear, there is suppression of liberty.
Free speech does not depend on laws alone. The
groundwork of a lasting democracy must be the satis
faction of its people's wants.

FATHER COUGHLIN probably has the nation's most
nauseating voice. Few radio announcers, extolling
the love-luring virtues of toothpaste, can even approach
this whip-tongued demagogue in generating disgust.
His voice whispers, pleads, thunders, roars, incites, and
then prays. Each word is uttered as though the orator
fervently believed his every syllable to be a Shake
spearean tragedy. And the hyper-dramatic, affected
result is really enough to disturb the normal digestive
processes of anyone who vainly mines the Father's
mass of words for a copper ounce of logic.
But nearly every owner of a radio has been gifted
by a foresighted Providence with moveable fingers,
and by radio manufacturers with a little dial, which,
when cunningly mastered, provides a means of turning
the radio off. Hence Father Coughlin's bilious voice
should not have been forced off the air on hygienic
grounds.

A ND on democratic grounds the move to silence all
"controversial speakers" was even less appropriate.
It is the theory of democratic government that when
all men have a free voice (except to slander) the rule
of the majority will be best achieved. But in times of
political and economic upheaval like our own, people
begin 1 to fear agitators that in times of peace and pros
perity were tolerated. They were tolerated because of
the Bill of Rights and American tradition. But now we
can see that they were also tolerated on the grounds
of political impotence.
When economic and political chaos threatens, when
there is dissatisfaction and unrest, more people will
listen to a demagogue, and more people will try to
silence him. And when the custom of stifling free
speech is established, sincerity may be squelched along
with chicanery. Unfortunately, the toothpaste sales
men alone will still be here to plague us.
