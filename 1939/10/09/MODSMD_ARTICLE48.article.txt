# CAMPUS OPINION
## "ISOLATIONIST-PRO-NAZI-PACIFIST" 
### 
"THE EDITOR, SIR:
The Daily was chastizcd in a recent letter for
giving less attention to "world democracy, organized
peace, and a binding international law" than to "the
Isolationist-pro-Nazi-Pacifist Coalition." Since the
only opinion on which the last three elements can by
any stretch of imagination or diction be said to have
formed a coalition is the advisability of not selling
arms and extending credit to Britain and France, and
since the opposing view has been fairly represented
in the Daily (for instance in Professor Stuart's article),
the conclusion may be drawn that this critic disagrees
(to put it mildly) with isolationism and pacifism as
separate entities. Otherwise he would not have used
the New York World's trick of gratuitously hooking on
"pro-Nazi" . . .
The Streits and the Manns, the Wells's and the 14-
point Wilsons are admirable as prophets and seers of
peace time; when they become the incredibly stupid
tools of hard-boiled militarists and empire men like
Clemenceau and Churchill they are pitiful and detest
ible—pitiful in their innocence and detestable because
their own carcasses not only become sacred but are
surer than any to remain inviolate . . .

1 ET the French government openly acknowledge that
their predecessors were moved at Versailles and
before by nothing but a spirit of low vengeance and
greed, let the British do the same; let both govern
ments openly and significantly renounce the policy of
oppression they have followed at home as well as
abroad—in the Manchester breadlines of 1914 as well
as among the Indians who "as yet are unable to govern
themselves"; in M. Daladier's "solution" of the labor
problem as well as in the bombing of Damascus and
the massacre of whole RifT populations in Morocco . . .
But possibly I have overshot my mark. The critic
of the Daily opened by advocating "the quest of many
sided truths." May I close by recommending as aids
in that quest Walter Millis; I. C. Willis (England's
Holy War); Arthur Ponsonby, Sidney Rogerson, and
Liddel-Hart on propaganda; any good history of the
secret treaties and Anglo-French diplomacy from 1906
to 1920; any good study of Lord Grey's foreign policy;
G. B. Shaw's "Common Sense about the War"; and as
a sort of anti-climax, any history of the War of 1812,
wherein it will be discovered that Chester Rowell,
whose viewpoint is so much admired by the Chronicle
reading-critic-of-the-Daily, has very ignorantly lifted
from Roosevelt's neutrality speech a pompous reference
to the embargo that is as inaccuarte as it is irrelevant.
Sincerely,
Willis Butler
