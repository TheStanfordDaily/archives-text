r PIIE EDITOR. SIR:
On behalf of the large number of students (be
side myself) who daily pass the site of the Hoover War
Library, I feel forced to write the following.
From time immemorial it has been the self-imposed
duty of passersby of large excavation and construction
works to .stop as near as possible, to gawk around for a
while, and then to proceed in carrying on ignorant
conversations with the other sheep standing nearby.
At least, such a situation does exist here on our own
campus.
Therefore, it seems to me that The Daily is not only
failing to keep its readers abreast of events, but is
also neglecting a fine opportunity to educate those of
us who are sufficiently interested to wonder "what
the heck is going on." Surely an occasional, short, and
authoritative article on the latest developments at this,
our newest and most unique building, would be of
considerable interest to all Daily readers (as well as to
myself).
Concernedly yours,
H. W.
