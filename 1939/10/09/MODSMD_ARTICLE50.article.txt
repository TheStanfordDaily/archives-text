playing at the Fox Stanford.
Junior, please go away, I want to
sleep. . . . You want a story? Well,
all right, if you promise to be good.
Well, in 1917, there were a lot of
German U-boats running around
American waters sinking American
merchant vessels. Wasn't that aw
ful?
In a small New England village
there lived two tugboat captains
that simply couldn't get along and
were always fighting and doing each
other dirt. . . .
SMART KID!
How did you know one had a
daughter? Well, one of them did.
He was the older one, and he
tricked the younger into joining the
submarine patrol. My, aren't I get
ting involved? Anyway, the Ger
mans sunk our older captain's boat,
and he joined the navy only to find
his bitter enemy in charge of the
fleet to which he had been ordered.
He did some awful things like
disobeying orders and losing a sub
marine and was demoted to a com
mon sailor on shore duty. He got
very anoyed and started to desert
but duty called and he . . . Why,
Junior, how do you know the end of
the story? You saw "Thunder
Afloat today? Well, for goodness
sake, why didn't you tell me? . . .
HE'LL LEARN
You thought Wallace Beery was
good? Well, you're young and some
day you'll understand . . . Yes, I
do think Chester Morris stuck out
that square jaw of his too much.
. . . Junior, you mustn't "refer to
Virginia Grey as blubbery. ... I
know she was, but you musn't say
such things about women. Junior,
don't you think that the German sub
officer was good looking? Wow!
Junior! such language. Irene Rich
can't help it if she only weighs as
much as she did when she was 16,
and I can't help it if you didn't like
her picture "Everybody's Hobby."
. . . You shouldn't wish that she
had been burned in the fire . . .
Junior, you stop using such
words . . . Junior, you keep quiet
or I'll wash your mouth with soap
. . . Junior!
