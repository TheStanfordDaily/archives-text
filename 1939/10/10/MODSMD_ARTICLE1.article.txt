### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
J JITLER said it meant that Ger
many has no imperialistic de
signs on other countries; Mussolini
said it means that the Nazis are sell
ing out to Russia.
And the Rome-Berlin axis
rocked and swayed under the se
vere strain of the Fuehrer's lat
est move in the game of war. The
event which occasioned the accu
sation that the fascists are giving
way l>eforc Communist advances
was the first repatriation of Ger
man minorities from Eastern Eu
rope.
* * *
Simultaneously as Russian troops
moved on Estonian soil, the first
German migrants arrived at the
conquered Polish port of Gdynia.
And the first shiploads of Germans
to be repatriated from Latvia, which
also has yielded to Russia's demands
for military and naval bases in the
Baltic, will start for Poland from
Latvian ports within 24 hours.
Although 25,000 Soviet troops
moved into Estonia last night and
others were poised to sweep into
Latvia shortly, German quarters in
sisted that Russia's military opera
tions had absolutely no connection
whatever with the German minority
migrations.

IVfUSSOLINI thought it was all
a lie. He frankly accused Hit
ler of whittling away the props of
the Rome-Berlin axis and retreat
ing before the wave of Commun
ism. Hitler, of course, pointed to
the repatriation as definite indica
tion that Germany has no impe
rialistic notions in the Baltic. And
things reached a neat deadlock,
with had feeling developing be
tween the two fascist, totalitarian
nations.

Josef Stalin was holding all the
high cards. His series of lightning
alliances that built a solid buffer
bloc along the Baltic outsmarted
Hitler so smoothly that Red Square
might well echo good Soviet laugh
ter.
Anyway, Mussolini grew increas
ingly uneasy over just what extent
concessions by Germany had reach
ed. "After seven centuxies of bat
tle agaixist Slav influence," Milan's
Cox Tier Delia Serra said, "the Ger
man minorities which acted as senti
