# Stanford Trophy Room Holds Famous Card Athletic Relics
## 
### BUD AMES 
Stanford has a crammed trophy room, you know. That is, you should
know unless you are a pail of the Farm's feminine fourth and never go
wandering around the Men's gymnasium.
Yes, Stanford has a trophy room with its approximate 1000 feet of
wall space practically completely covered with colorful sports photographs,

photographs of football players in
flowing mustaches, of football play
ers in lop-sided helmets, of baseball
players with scared faces, staring
pop-eyed at the "birdie" in the
camera.
CASES RIM ROOM
Rimming the room and looking
much like misplaced candy counters,
six waist-high glass cases bulge
with almost countless trophies and
immortalized knick-knacks. Here
rests a slightly dusty, cardinal and
black relay baton across whose top
is scribbled the names of Jim Kneu
buhl, Stan Hiserman, Ray Malott,
and Jack Weiershauser. This quar
tet were awarded the baton for es
tablishing a record 880 relay at the
West Coast Relays back in 1937.
Hei-e squats a still more dusty pa
per-mache white top-hat, across
whose top is painted the familiar
cardinal .'S."
CUPS TELL VICTORS
Cups—there must be half a hun
dred in those cases. Cups tell of
victories — and of losses as is the
case of the slender silver trophy
given by the Stanford track team in
memory of H. V. Aupperle, '17, "who
gave his life for others in the Bal
kans."
Above this cup rest, forever, a
row of sad, sunken-cheek footballs,
each telling a story of blood and
glory in a few names and numbers
inked crudely near the seams. This
football tells of 1924's glorious 20 to
20 tie between Stanford and Califor
nia despite the fact that Cal led
the Red machine 20 to 6 with only
5 minutes of the last quarter re
maining. This next saw punishing
action in the 1930 Big Game, the
year that (he same Red machine
tallied 41 points to California's 0.
FOOTBALLS BATTERED'
The footballs look slightly flat; two
dusty baseballs in the next case look
flatter. They are the two now-auto
graphed baseballs which the Farm's
immortal Ernie Ncvers pounded for
home runs in the California diamond
series way back in April of 1925.
And, oh yes, here is the first and
original block "S" with a little white
card which tells that it was pre
sented to W. L. McLaine of '96. Mc-
Laine, so the card says, made a
crucial put-out in a California base
ball series game while lying flat on
his back. Those were the good old
days.
And on top of the last case there
stands—but, why don't you go and
take a look around yourself? It's
free.

home runs in the California diamond
series way back in April of 1925.
And, oh yes, here is the first and
original block "S" with a little white
card which tells that it was pre
sented to W. L. McLaine of '96. Mc-
Laine, so the card says, made a
crucial put-out in a California base
ball series game while lying flat on
his back. Those were the good old
days.
And on top of the last case there
stands—but, why don't you go and
take a look around yourself? It's
free.
Stanford has a crammed trophy room, you know. That is, you should
know unless you are a pail of the Farm's feminine fourth and never go
wandering around the Men's gymnasium.
Yes, Stanford has a trophy room with its approximate 1000 feet of
wall space practically completely covered with colorful sports photographs,

photographs of football players in
flowing mustaches, of football play
ers in lop-sided helmets, of baseball
players with scared faces, staring
pop-eyed at the "birdie" in the
camera.
CASES RIM ROOM
Rimming the room and looking
much like misplaced candy counters,
six waist-high glass cases bulge
with almost countless trophies and
immortalized knick-knacks. Here
rests a slightly dusty, cardinal and
black relay baton across whose top
is scribbled the names of Jim Kneu
buhl, Stan Hiserman, Ray Malott,
and Jack Weiershauser. This quar
tet were awarded the baton for es
tablishing a record 880 relay at the
West Coast Relays back in 1937.
Hei-e squats a still more dusty pa
per-mache white top-hat, across
whose top is painted the familiar
cardinal .'S."
CUPS TELL VICTORS
Cups—there must be half a hun
dred in those cases. Cups tell of
victories — and of losses as is the
case of the slender silver trophy
given by the Stanford track team in
memory of H. V. Aupperle, '17, "who
gave his life for others in the Bal
kans."
Above this cup rest, forever, a
row of sad, sunken-cheek footballs,
each telling a story of blood and
glory in a few names and numbers
inked crudely near the seams. This
football tells of 1924's glorious 20 to
20 tie between Stanford and Califor
nia despite the fact that Cal led
the Red machine 20 to 6 with only
5 minutes of the last quarter re
maining. This next saw punishing
action in the 1930 Big Game, the
year that (he same Red machine
tallied 41 points to California's 0.
FOOTBALLS BATTERED'
The footballs look slightly flat; two
dusty baseballs in the next case look
flatter. They are the two now-auto
graphed baseballs which the Farm's
immortal Ernie Ncvers pounded for
home runs in the California diamond
series way back in April of 1925.
