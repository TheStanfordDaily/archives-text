# Warships, Planes Clash In North Sea; Answer To Nazis Still Unsettled
## Llovd George To Lead Fight For Armistice 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 9 (UP). —David
Lloyd George, World War Prime
Minister, was understood tonight to
be preparing to lead a campaign
against British advocates of "war at
any price."
The white-haired statesman who
last Tuesday surprised the House of
Commons with a demand that Brit
ain give careful consideration to any
peace proposals Fuehrer Adolf Hit
ler might make has summoned for
Thursday a private meeting of the
Council of Action for Peace, of
which he is chairman.
It was understood that he would
address delegates from all parts of
the British Isles and begin pressure
on the government to give more
than perfunctory attention to Hit
ler's proposal.
The course of the meeting prob
ably will be determined by the state
ment which Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain is expected to make to
Commons Wednesday. It is under
stood that he will state the British
government position on Hitler's
Reichstag speech.
CHAMBERLAIN OPPOSED
Chamberlain may not make a defi
nite reply and in any event is ex
pected to reject the proposals in their
present form. Some indication of
that was given today in his leply to
a question by Arthur Henderson,
Labor leader, in Commons.
"His Majesty's government and
the French government," Chamber
lain said, "are in complete accord
as to the purposes for which we en
tered the war. These purposes have
more than once been stated by the
governments.
"No doubt, as time goes on, both
governments will consider whether
their war aims should be stated in
more specific form. Mr. Henderson
may take it that any such statement
will only be made by agreement be
tween the two governments."
Henderson had asked if it were
the government s policy to publish
jointly with France a specific state
ment of their war aims based on
principles already enunciated.
AIMS LISTED
These aims have been expressed
as including restoration of the Polish
state, of Czechoslovak freedom and
an end to the Hitler technique of
expansion by the threat of force.
Political sources said today that
German peace proposals to Britain
should be made through the Ameri
can embassy in Berlin, which has
been representing British interests in
Germany since the war began.
At the same time they regarded
without enthusiasm British press re
ports from Washington to the effect
that President Roosevelt is contem
plating the advisability of a move
toward peace negotiations.
In these circles it was contended
that Hitler's Reichstag speech of
last week was not a formal peace
offer and that there has been no
positive indication of any develop
ment which would halt hostilities.
In his Commons speech last week
Lloyd George recognized the diffi
culty of accepting a Hitler state
ment in good faith but suggested
that the question of peace was not
"dependent on the word of Herr
Hitler."
U.S. FAVORED
Should a peace proposal come
from neutrals, such as Italy or Rus
sia, he said, "they will be just as
involved as we arc in seeing that
whatever terms come to arc imple
mented." Ho added that it would be
"a first-class mistake" to enter a
peace conference without including
the United States because "you have
there a great power whose interests
arc not European interests and
which has not been involved in any
of these disputes and quarrels."
Lloyd George's statement then
stirred much bitterness in Parlia
ment but won some support from
Lord Snell, leader of the Labor op
position, who said the government
should not refuse to listen to "a real
proposal for peace."

which he is chairman.
It was understood that he would
address delegates from all parts of
the British Isles and begin pressure
on the government to give more
than perfunctory attention to Hit
ler's proposal.
The course of the meeting prob
ably will be determined by the state
ment which Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain is expected to make to
Commons Wednesday. It is under
stood that he will state the British
government position on Hitler's
Reichstag speech.
CHAMBERLAIN OPPOSED
Chamberlain may not make a defi
nite reply and in any event is ex
pected to reject the proposals in their
present form. Some indication of
that was given today in his leply to
a question by Arthur Henderson,
Labor leader, in Commons.
"His Majesty's government and
the French government," Chamber
lain said, "are in complete accord
as to the purposes for which we en
tered the war. These purposes have
more than once been stated by the
governments.
"No doubt, as time goes on, both
governments will consider whether
their war aims should be stated in
more specific form. Mr. Henderson
may take it that any such statement
will only be made by agreement be
tween the two governments."
Henderson had asked if it were
the government s policy to publish
jointly with France a specific state
ment of their war aims based on
principles already enunciated.
AIMS LISTED
These aims have been expressed
as including restoration of the Polish
state, of Czechoslovak freedom and
an end to the Hitler technique of
expansion by the threat of force.
Political sources said today that
German peace proposals to Britain
should be made through the Ameri
can embassy in Berlin, which has
been representing British interests in
Germany since the war began.
At the same time they regarded
without enthusiasm British press re
ports from Washington to the effect
that President Roosevelt is contem
plating the advisability of a move
toward peace negotiations.
In these circles it was contended
that Hitler's Reichstag speech of
last week was not a formal peace
offer and that there has been no
positive indication of any develop
ment which would halt hostilities.
In his Commons speech last week
Lloyd George recognized the diffi
culty of accepting a Hitler state
ment in good faith but suggested
that the question of peace was not
"dependent on the word of Herr
Hitler."
U.S. FAVORED
Should a peace proposal come
from neutrals, such as Italy or Rus
sia, he said, "they will be just as
involved as we arc in seeing that
whatever terms come to arc imple
mented." Ho added that it would be
"a first-class mistake" to enter a
peace conference without including
the United States because "you have
there a great power whose interests
arc not European interests and
which has not been involved in any
of these disputes and quarrels."
Lloyd George's statement then
stirred much bitterness in Parlia
ment but won some support from
Lord Snell, leader of the Labor op
position, who said the government
should not refuse to listen to "a real
proposal for peace."
LONDON, Oct. 9 (UP). —David
Lloyd George, World War Prime
Minister, was understood tonight to
be preparing to lead a campaign

The white-haired statesman who
last Tuesday surprised the House of

peace proposals Fuehrer Adolf Hit

Thursday a private meeting of the
