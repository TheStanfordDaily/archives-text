# A.S.S.U. to Nominate Candidates for Excom, Wen's Council Position
## Leckie Announces Special Election On Oct. 17 to Fill Posts Vacated By Roberta Tuthill, Harlan Copsey 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Nominations for two vacant student body positions, graduate woman on
Ex Committee and one seat on Men's Council, will start this morning at
8 o'clock, according to Bill Leckie, election hoard chairman.
These vacancies occurred this quarter because Roberta Tuthill, grad
uate woman representatives on Ex Committee, and Harlan Copsey, mem-

ber of Men's Council, did not return,
to school. A special election will
take place Tuesday, Oct. 17, defi
nitely to fill these positions.
Candidates for the Ex Committee
job must have completed 180 units
while the Men's Council hopefuls
should have 120 units chalked up to
their credit, according to further an
nouncement by Leckie.
POLLS OPEN TODAY
Nomination polls will remain open
today and tomorrow on the Law
Steps from 8 to 6 o'clock. Victors in
the final elections will serve only
until February in view of the fact
that half their term has already been
fulfilled by last quarter's incumb
ents.
Off-hand speculation last night in
dicated that Marie (Putzie) Hin
richs, now assistant resident assist
ant at Roble, would be a nominee
for the graduate woman vacancy on
Ex Committee, but mention of the
Men's Council vacancy prompted no
concrete suggestions.
SIGNIFICANT VICTORY
When elected in spring elections,
Roberta Tuthill's victory carried with
it greater significance than the mere
selection of a representative on Ex
Committee. It involved the issue of
whether or not a permanent clause
should be inserted in the A.S.S.U.
Constitution specifying that graduate
members of Ex Committee should
be "one man and one woman."
That election questioned the
strength of the graduate women on
campus, that is, whether or not. their
number was sufficient to require
specific provision for representation
on the A.S.S.U. governing body. As
it turned out, the provision was in
serted in the '39 vex*sion of the Con
stitution.
