# British Report Cruisers Unhit; Planes Downed
## 
### UNITED PRESS 
British warships and German
bombing planes fought a series of
battles in the northeastern portion
of the North Sea Monday while tin
warring governments sparred cau
tiously on the question of what an
swer to make to Adolf Hitler's bid
for peace.
The British Admiralty announced
its cruisers and destroyers had es
caped unscathed after "repeated ac
tions" with German bombers near
Scandinavia, supposedly in a test of
the British fleet's blockade of the
Baltic.
Two or three German planes re
turning from a bombing attack on
British warships in the North Sea
were forced down on Danish terri
tory and a third was driven across
the German border by the fire of
Danish anti-aircraft guns near the
Apcnrade Fjord on the Baltic.
SUBMARINE ATTACKED'
The French high command an
nounced a French naval patrol had
"successfully attacked" a German
submarine, but did not reveal whe
ther the U-boat was sunk.
On the western front Germany's
heavy guns doubled the intensity
of their fire against French advance
positions on German soil and the
$500,000,000 French Maginot line of
sunken forts in what French military
leaders believed might be prepara
tion for a major Nazi attack.
Hitler did not agree that his peace
proposals of last Friday have col
lapsed, although Nazis at last aban
doned hopes that President Roose
velt might intervene in the role of
peacemaker and bring about an ar
mistice and later a general European
conference. To the Germans, hopes
now rest on whether Britain and
France will offer counter-proposals
or slam the door solidly shut on any
peace negotiations.
PEACEMAKER SOUGHT
Some Germans expressed a belief
that some small neutral such as Nor
way might assume the peace-maker
role which Berlin had hoped Mr.
Roosevelt might undertake.
Soviet Russia, fast spreading her
armed domination over the small
Baltic states, again threw her
weight behind Hitler's peace plan by
means of an editorial in the govern
ment newspaper, Izvestia, which said
that a war to "crush Hitlerism"
means to commit an act of "criminal
folly."
Germany cited the repatriations of
the German minorities — described
definitely by Hitler before the
Reichstag as part of Germany's plan
to eliminate the causes of war and
unrest—as proof that Germany has
no desire to dominate the smaller
nations of Eastern Ei#ope or inter
fere with their internal affairs.
Other nations, including Ger
many's military ally, Italy, took a far
j graver view of the German repatri
| ations and the resettling of the mi
i norities in conquered Poland.
The Fascist press viewed the ex
! odus, with "dismay" and said it por-
I tended the end of German influ-
I ence in the Baltics and showed that
Russia was moving westward while
' the Western nations were "in re
. treat."
French diplomats professed to sec
' a widening rift in the Russian-Ger
i man partnership and a weakening
jof the German position in Eastern
• Europe as a result of Stalin's light—
i ning-like gains in the Baltic.
