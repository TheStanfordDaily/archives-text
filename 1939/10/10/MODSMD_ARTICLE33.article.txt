## 
### 
WINTHROP, Wash., Oct. 9 (UP).
—The United States Forestry Serv
ice announced today it had con
ducted successful experiments for
the first time in parachuting men
from an airplane to battle forest
fires.
The jumps have been surprisingly
accurate, the forestry said, with one
jumper landing within 20 feet of a
specified mark.
The fire fighters wear suits made
of canvas and sponge rubber, re
inforced with leather, to protect
them in case they strike snags or
trees as they near the ground after
leaping out of the planes.
The experiments will continue
several weeks, supervised by David
P. Godwin, Washington, D.C., and
Otto Lindh, Portland, Ore. Win
throp was chosen as a testing
ground because of its varied terrain
and trees.

SEATTLE, Oct. 9 (UP).—Despite a
14-7 loss to the U.C.L.A. Bruins
here Saturday, the University of
Washington Huskies today were
tabbed as an "improved" football
club.
