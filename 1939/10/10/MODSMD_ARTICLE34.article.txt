# Prizes Offered For Best Book Collections
## Four Prize Winners Will Be Announced Last of Next April 
### 
I Undergraduate students interested i
in entering the library contest, \
sponsored by the Bookstore and ad- |
ministered by a faculty committee |
headed by John W. Dodds, associate |
professor of English, may still do so |
by filing application at the Bookstore ;
or with any department secretary.
Prizes to the value of $100 in
books will be awarded to the four i
winners at the close of the contest;
next April 30. The deadline for en- 1
tries is set for November 15.
Dodds stressed the fact that the j
judging would not be affected by j
the cost of the books collected but'
by their relative value as a nucleus,
for a permanent personal library.!
A well planned, integrated collection i
of which the owner can show his ac- i
quaintance and reasons for selection !
will be given preference over a mis- I
j cellaneous but expensive collection, j
Dodds also wished to express the j
I fact that the contest is not a com- I
mercial venture of the Bookstore, |
I and that where the books are pur- I
I chased will not affect the judging |
I in any way.
Details of the competition and
I entry blanks may be . had at the j
i general book department of the j
Bookstore, from any departmental j
j secretary, or from any member of i
I the facultv committee.
