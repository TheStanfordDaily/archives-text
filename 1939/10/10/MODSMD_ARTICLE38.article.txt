# Tiny Shuffles Cards for U.C.L.A. Tilt
## Pool Moves To Quarter In Shake-up Donahue Bolster Weak Tackle Spot; Bruins Look Strong 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Reorganization on the same large
scale program taken last year by
Tiny Thornhill about this time was
started yesterday afternoon on Stan
lord's gridiron eleven.
A year ago Hamp Pool, then a
hall back, and Corky Donahue, then
a tackle, figured most prominently in
the switches and as a result from
the time the two men had become
adjusted to their new posts the In
dians started rolling up momentum
even though they weren't winning.
Yesterday both Pool and Donahue
were once again given new assign
ments in desperate effort of the
Stanford coaching corps to develop a
faster charging line, a stronger right
side, and a more powerful backfield
unit.
POOL AT QUARTER
Pool, the 210-pound left guard,
worked out at quarterback in the
surprise move of the first session
since the Indians' 10-0 defeat by
Oregon. For the better part of the
day yesterday, the big blond stud
ied plays over for his new role. In
valuable in the line, Pool will take
over the duties of backing up the
line on defense along with Center
Jim Verdieek.
Thornhill figures that the addition
of Pool to the backfield, in spite of
his size, will add speed so that block
ing assignments from the quarter
back post will be carried out more
efficiently. Gene Coldiron, however,
still ranks as a capable quarter and
line-backer and undoubtedly will
have every opportunity to win back
the starting assignment.

When guards were weak last sea
son and tackles were stronger,
Thornhill changed Donahue over
into a right guard along with Pool.
The situation is reversed now.
Thornhill found that the inexpe
rience of his two right tackles,
Trout and Johansen, didn't work out
for the best, especially against Ore
gon's sucker plays.
Although not in suit yesterday, fa
voring a slight limp, Donahue will
be shifted back to tackle this after
noon.
LEFT GUARDS
At left guard will be John Ker
man, who played about a half
against the Webfoots and was par
ticularly strong on defense on the
left side of the line. Sophomore
Dave Patterson will be given his
chance to keep right guard in check.
Behind Kerman and Patterson are
Steve Keusefi and Chick Orme,
neither of whom has seen any ac
tion in either Oregon games but who
were capable subs last year.
The problem of finding a left
halfback who resembles something
like a triple-threater—kicker, run
ner, and passer—still has Thornhill
guessing. Albert is the kicker and
possibly the passer but isn't the run
ner that Kmetovic is. However,
Kmetovic can't pass. '"Moon" Mul
lin can't kick but can pass and run
fairly well.
PETERSON MAY START
Thornhill may have Thor Peter
son in there to» see what he can do.
That would leave it up to Johnny
Casey to spell Standlee at fullback.
Passing, kicking, and running
through plays constituted the greater
part of yesterday's drill. Tiny will
have third and fourth stringers
working on U.C.L.A. plays.

This modern age has brought
horses to replace trucks for haul
ing freight across the Mississippi
river in St. Louis.
