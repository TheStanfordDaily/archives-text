### JERRY MAYER 
THE QUICK
MR. JACK ROBINSON
"As quick as Jack Robinson" no
longer is a trite little descriptive
phrase—it's now an actual, definite
threat to Stanford's football team.
Of course, we're referring to
U.C.L.A.'s newest sensation, colored
Jackie Fiobinson, first-string right
halfback on what many experts
claim is the finest backfield on the
Coast.
For the sepia rambler of the
U.C.L.A. football team is more
than a sensational ball-packer
whose feats of wizardry drew
crowds of 50.000 persons weekly
last year while he was cavorting
for undefeated Pasadena J. C.; he
is equally profiieient in almost
every other sport. And the un
usual thing about it all is that
Robinson doesn't look like a great
athlete—in fact, he doesn't look
any kind of an athlete. Six feet
tall, and weighing - only !75 pounds.
Robinson reminds one of nothing
more than a thin stick waving in
the breeze.
BUT just take a look at his ac
complishments:
Track—Here the lithe jackrabbit
holds the national junior college
broad jump record at 25 feet, 6V2
inches, which is one of the longest
leaps ever registered by any man.
Basketball—High scorer for Pas
adena J. C.'s state championship
outfit last year. Scored 10 points
against the U.S.C. freshmen to al
most single-handedly break the
winning streak of 82 straight games
the Trohabes had run up.
Baseball—Ace shortstop of Pasa
dena's state amateur champion
horsehide club last summer. In the
final two-game series, he accepted
II chances without an error, and
stole seven bases.

Tennis—Reached the quarter-
I finals of the state negro net cham
pionship before bowing out to one
| of the finalists.
Golf—Borrowed a friend's clubs
I one day, then went out and shot a
; 99. That's the only time in his life
j he has ever played the game,
j Oh, well, he can only compete in
j one sport—at a time.
I HERE AGAIN. THERE
| AGAIN FINNEGAN
Last year Stanford's football team
j didn't start really moving until Tiny
i Thornhill shifted Hamp Pool and
i Corky Donahue from the backfield
j and tackle, respectively, to fill in the
I guard spots. It took Pool and Dona
| hue a little while to get used to their
| new assignments, but once they had
i mastered the new positions they
| made Stanford a splendid football
• machine.
But this week Thornhill in des
peration is moving each right
; back where he started from. Pool
■ goes to quarterback to install
j some more speed at that post,
I while Donahue moves over a cou
ple of yards to right tackle so that
| position can benefit by Corky's
! experience.
That means that John Kcrnian
and Dave Patterson, both playing
: their first year of varsity ball, get
! the starting call at the vacated
1 guard posts.
Last season it took Donahue and
Pool a couple or three games to get
| onto the hang of their new posi
tions. but once they did the Indians
rolled.
So let us waft a gentle prayer
upon the autumn winds that the
strategy of moving them back to
their old habitats will prove as suc
cessful as the original shift.
P.S.: And faster!
