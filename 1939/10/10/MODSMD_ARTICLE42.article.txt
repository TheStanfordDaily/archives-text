## 
### 
I CORVALLIS, Ore., Oct. 9 (UP).—
: The Oregon State College Beavers
! got no rest today. Coach Lon Stiner,
I dissatisfied with the Orangemen's
| performance against Idaho, drilled
j his charges for more than four
j hours, although this week's game—
! against the University of Portland—
i is considered a breather.
