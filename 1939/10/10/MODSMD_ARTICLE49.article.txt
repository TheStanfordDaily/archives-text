# Prometheus Unbound

### 
TONIGHT, when Ex Committee listens to the
report of one of its multitude of subcommit
tees, the campus will prick up its ears for the
first mention this season of the annual Big Game
bonfire.
Assigned to investigate possible new loca
tions for the blaze, Ken Koch and Molly West
tonight will state their findings with a purpose:
to overcome the Administration's objections to
the fire.
Last year's opposition, based on the fact that
the Golden Bear's funeral pyre kept too many
Encina men away from classes, was dealt with
by building it all in one day. This year the ob
jections come from another direction. During
Big Game week the Roble women see fit to
indulge in a wholesale cutting of classes- and
their scholastic average takes a noticeable
tumble.
"Bonfire hysteria"—they print neatly on the
little excuse slips that they file at the Dean
of Women's office.
Obliged to keep lower division students up
to the academic mark, the Administration feels
called upon to object to the Big Game bonfire
when they read these penciled scraps of non
sense. And in an effort to remove it from the
Lagunita lake-bed, from Roble's sphere of emo
tion, and from administrative disapproval, the
committee has spent this week hunting for a
new location.
However, this is not the only evidence that
has threatened to smother the blaze forever.
Each year, immediately after the Big Game,
the University receives a fistful of overesti
mated bills charging it for damages of more
than SlOO. Indiscreet freshmen have a habit of
seizing all types of. combustible property —
painted billboards and Ozark plumbing in par
ticular—to add to the brilliance of their pyre.
Such petty larcenies are not only embarrass
ing to the Administration, but are one of the
most effective means of prejudicing it against
the tradition.
If frosh women will drop the high-school
practice of cutting classes during Big Game
week, if frosh men will resist the temptation to
steal other people's lumber, no matter what its
shape or form, the official objections will be
punctured balloons.
One of Stanford's most spirited institutions
and the brightest day of the freshman year, the
celebration is a tradition that must not be al
lowed to die.
Roble must forget its affected hysteria. En
cina must sacrifice its taste for filching out
houses. So that the bonfire may blaze.

the University receives a fistful of overesti
mated bills charging it for damages of more
than SlOO. Indiscreet freshmen have a habit of
seizing all types of. combustible property —
painted billboards and Ozark plumbing in par
ticular—to add to the brilliance of their pyre.
Such petty larcenies are not only embarrass
ing to the Administration, but are one of the
most effective means of prejudicing it against
the tradition.
If frosh women will drop the high-school
practice of cutting classes during Big Game
week, if frosh men will resist the temptation to
steal other people's lumber, no matter what its
shape or form, the official objections will be
punctured balloons.
One of Stanford's most spirited institutions
and the brightest day of the freshman year, the
celebration is a tradition that must not be al
lowed to die.
Roble must forget its affected hysteria. En
cina must sacrifice its taste for filching out
houses. So that the bonfire may blaze.
TONIGHT, when Ex Committee listens to the
report of one of its multitude of subcommit
tees, the campus will prick up its ears for the
first mention this season of the annual Big Game
bonfire.
Assigned to investigate possible new loca
tions for the blaze, Ken Koch and Molly West
tonight will state their findings with a purpose:
to overcome the Administration's objections to
the fire.
Last year's opposition, based on the fact that
the Golden Bear's funeral pyre kept too many
Encina men away from classes, was dealt with
by building it all in one day. This year the ob
jections come from another direction. During
Big Game week the Roble women see fit to
indulge in a wholesale cutting of classes- and
their scholastic average takes a noticeable
tumble.
"Bonfire hysteria"—they print neatly on the
little excuse slips that they file at the Dean
of Women's office.
Obliged to keep lower division students up
to the academic mark, the Administration feels
called upon to object to the Big Game bonfire
when they read these penciled scraps of non
sense. And in an effort to remove it from the
Lagunita lake-bed, from Roble's sphere of emo
tion, and from administrative disapproval, the
committee has spent this week hunting for a
new location.
However, this is not the only evidence that
has threatened to smother the blaze forever.
