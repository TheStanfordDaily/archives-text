# Explanation for Chaos
## 
### 
THE Daily today, through the co-operation of
Time, introduces to the campus a practical
note amid the cries of pacifists who would have
the Stanford student body refuse to go to war,
and the sneers and catcalls of the cynics who
claim the pacifists are barking up the wrong
tree, or at least have picked one too high.
Curt, clear, concise is the "Background for
War" which this morning accompanied your
copy of The Daily, presenting as an explanation
for chaos the European scene upon which
Adolph Hitler made his Britain - shaking de
mands.
The world of the student in 1939 has always
been a post-war world. The sneaky quickness
with which it was transformed into a pre-war
world disrupted thought, made everyone's po
litical theories turn fancy nip-ups.
To obtain so soon a retrospective view of the
world since 1918, a view which will re-correlate
one's theories of power politics and furnish a
reason and, as the title suggests, a "background
for war," is a real convenience.
Time's pamphlet has been viewed by several
local professors and found free of propaganda.
Because of the magazine's convenient position
in current history, coverage seems to be as
complete as possible in a 30-page leaflet. The
literary style is convenient, colorful, and un
derstandable.
It can serve as a lineup of players and num
bers, giving you a key by which to follow, blow
by blow, the moves in this, the Second World
War.â€”J. B.
