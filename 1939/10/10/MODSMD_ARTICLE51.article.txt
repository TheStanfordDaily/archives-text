NOW is the time for all graduate women to
come to the aid of their party.
When this cry was sounded last spring, they !

came out in droves and, by adding an amend
ment to the A.S.S.U. constitution, won for them
selves a permanent position on Ex Committee.
Previously, graduate students held two port
folios, but men and women were eligible for
both of these spots. At present, the graduate
women having asserted themselves properly,
there are still two graduate positions on Ex
Committee; but the women automatically get
one of 4hem.
All that would scarcely be worth reviewing
if it weren't for the fact that the graduate women
have to get up early this morning to exercise
their franchise.
It is rather ironic. The graduate women
worked so hard for their recognition last spring,
and then their own officer did not come back to
school this year. And now, in the middle of
October, they have to nominate another can
didate, and go to the polls again. And after all
this, the new candidate's term will be over in
February.
But woman's place, by God, is not in the
home.
It is somewhat anti-climactic, but pertinent
nevertheless, to mention now that nominations
are also in order for a candidate to fill a va
cancy on Men's Council. One member here,
too, did not return this year. The man replacing
him also will be ousted in February.
Absolutely any man with 105 units is eli
gible.â€”D. J.
