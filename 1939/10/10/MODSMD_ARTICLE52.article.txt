### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
IT'S HERE AGAIN!

/YH GOD, you're here again, posted on the Ad Build
ing bulletin board in full view and full shame!
As welcome as the gentle small-pox comes the Bawl
out.
Daily writers have from Bawlouts immemorial lanc
ed the mournful numbers that spell public gossip on a
man's scholastic soul. It may be that the Bawlout is
maintained as a journalist's tackling dummy, designed
to maximize the ego of the critic by giving him easy
meat. I hope that is true. Because, besides its capacity
as a target, the Bawlout a is vestigial organ—as useful
to Stanford as feudalism is to New York or a one hun
dred and first leg to a centipede.
The Bawlout's undaunted vanguard claims that the
aborted little address book promotes scholastic achieve
ment, and that those who excel! in grades should be
given their proper credit. But hardly a creature inhab
its the Farm who is actually working for grades so
that he can gloat over the four or five digits after his
name in the Bawlout. If such archaic intellectual-
Neanderthals can be found, let them not be harbored
in a center of learning. Maybe the University of
Nineveh has a place for them.
# # * *
A ND the idea that the scholastically successful should
be given credit in this pamphlet is refuted by two
facts: the first is the existence of Phi Beta Kappa, and
the second is the near-unanimous .spurning of Bawl
out glory by those whose averages signify that they
were probably amazing children. There are some peo
ple at Stanford who are genuinely interested in learn
ing something, an activity which, after all, is not rep
rehensible. And those who are less interested in the
knowledge than in astounding their friends with "one
hundred plus two-hundred" do not belong in a Uni
versity. They belong in an aviary—with the parrots.
A Stanford professor, I am told, suggested that the
chief function of the Bawlout, in practice, is for Stan
ford cavaliers to find women with low averages. On
that ground, perhaps the Bawlout is functional. An
other possible employment is for the invidious use of
thwarted parents. But there the Bawlout's utility stops.
It is in vain to probe further. Like yesterday's funny
papers, like withered leaves or atrophied cocoons, like
salt-licks on the Sahara —the Bawlout is a washout. It
would take ten Petty cartoons even to lift it to the posi
tion of reading material for the bathroom.

thwarted parents. But there the Bawlout's utility stops.
It is in vain to probe further. Like yesterday's funny
papers, like withered leaves or atrophied cocoons, like
salt-licks on the Sahara —the Bawlout is a washout. It
would take ten Petty cartoons even to lift it to the posi
tion of reading material for the bathroom.
IT'S HERE AGAIN!

/YH GOD, you're here again, posted on the Ad Build
ing bulletin board in full view and full shame!
As welcome as the gentle small-pox comes the Bawl
out.
Daily writers have from Bawlouts immemorial lanc
ed the mournful numbers that spell public gossip on a
man's scholastic soul. It may be that the Bawlout is
maintained as a journalist's tackling dummy, designed
to maximize the ego of the critic by giving him easy
meat. I hope that is true. Because, besides its capacity
as a target, the Bawlout a is vestigial organ—as useful
to Stanford as feudalism is to New York or a one hun
dred and first leg to a centipede.
The Bawlout's undaunted vanguard claims that the
aborted little address book promotes scholastic achieve
ment, and that those who excel! in grades should be
given their proper credit. But hardly a creature inhab
its the Farm who is actually working for grades so
that he can gloat over the four or five digits after his
name in the Bawlout. If such archaic intellectual-
Neanderthals can be found, let them not be harbored
in a center of learning. Maybe the University of
Nineveh has a place for them.

A ND the idea that the scholastically successful should
be given credit in this pamphlet is refuted by two
facts: the first is the existence of Phi Beta Kappa, and
the second is the near-unanimous .spurning of Bawl
out glory by those whose averages signify that they
were probably amazing children. There are some peo
ple at Stanford who are genuinely interested in learn
ing something, an activity which, after all, is not rep
rehensible. And those who are less interested in the
knowledge than in astounding their friends with "one
hundred plus two-hundred" do not belong in a Uni
versity. They belong in an aviary—with the parrots.
A Stanford professor, I am told, suggested that the
chief function of the Bawlout, in practice, is for Stan
ford cavaliers to find women with low averages. On
that ground, perhaps the Bawlout is functional. An
other possible employment is for the invidious use of
thwarted parents. But there the Bawlout's utility stops.
