WHAT PRICK STUDENT GOVERNMENT?
THHE EDITOR, SIR:
I admired Mellinkoff's able spiel about Hearstian
flag-waving, and I'd like to see him dig below the sur
face of this majorette situation as effectively. Not be
cause the ogling male is being frustrated—Stanford
men pay more attention to pretty legs in the Cellar
lobby than they do at football games—but because we
have a question of saving democracy here on the cam
pus—if there is any left to save.
What drives the fact home is the complete contrast
between the solution of the majorette problem' at Cal
and the closing of the issue here. Your reporter shows
this contrast clearly by following the line, "... let
ters . . . rooting section . . . indicate where the
student body stands on the question" with the sen
tence, "University of California students voted 5-to-4
in a special election Wednesday ..."
* * * *
OLESSED with u more closely knit student body than
Cal and with equal intelligence per man (we all
hope), we still cannot be trusted by the Omnipotences
and Omnisciences to decide whether or not a well
swathed Roble woman marching with the band will
besmirch our proud escutcheon.
Like the rape of Poland, this local attack on democ
racy is far from a first offense. In fact, this disregard
of student government has become so complete that I
doubt if it ever occurred to the administration to sound
student opinion. Judging by their acts, these officials
don't appear to think in terms of student government.,
but of child management.
MellinkofT might as well lead us in a practice
match at saving democracy before we have to lunge at
the Huns. The lake bed might make a softer grave
than French mud anyway.

We respectfully call to your attention that in
Monday's article regarding the grade-point average of
various organizations, that the group receiving high
est rating (exclusive of the honorary fraternities) was
completely overlooked in favor of another organization
less worthy of the honor. It is hoped that this was
not an intentional mistake!

hope), we still cannot be trusted by the Omnipotences
and Omnisciences to decide whether or not a well
swathed Roble woman marching with the band will
besmirch our proud escutcheon.
Like the rape of Poland, this local attack on democ
racy is far from a first offense. In fact, this disregard
of student government has become so complete that I
doubt if it ever occurred to the administration to sound
student opinion. Judging by their acts, these officials
don't appear to think in terms of student government.,
but of child management.
MellinkofT might as well lead us in a practice
match at saving democracy before we have to lunge at
the Huns. The lake bed might make a softer grave
than French mud anyway.

WHERE HONOR IS DUE
r PHE EDITOR, Slit:
We respectfully call to your attention that in
Monday's article regarding the grade-point average of
various organizations, that the group receiving high
est rating (exclusive of the honorary fraternities) was
completely overlooked in favor of another organization
less worthy of the honor. It is hoped that this was
not an intentional mistake!

WHAT PRICK STUDENT GOVERNMENT?
THHE EDITOR, SIR:
I admired Mellinkoff's able spiel about Hearstian
flag-waving, and I'd like to see him dig below the sur
face of this majorette situation as effectively. Not be
cause the ogling male is being frustrated—Stanford
men pay more attention to pretty legs in the Cellar
lobby than they do at football games—but because we
have a question of saving democracy here on the cam
pus—if there is any left to save.
What drives the fact home is the complete contrast
between the solution of the majorette problem' at Cal
and the closing of the issue here. Your reporter shows
this contrast clearly by following the line, "... let
ters . . . rooting section . . . indicate where the
student body stands on the question" with the sen
tence, "University of California students voted 5-to-4
in a special election Wednesday ..."

OLESSED with u more closely knit student body than
Cal and with equal intelligence per man (we all
hope), we still cannot be trusted by the Omnipotences
and Omnisciences to decide whether or not a well
swathed Roble woman marching with the band will
besmirch our proud escutcheon.
