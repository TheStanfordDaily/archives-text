# 'Not Peace But a Sword' Portrays World in Chaos

"NOT PEACE HUT A SWORD" by Vincent Shecan.
If you go to London, you'll he told that the hest and cheapest way to
see the city is to take the 1!! bus, for in its mcamlcrings it covers most
of the sights of the city. But if you take that 13 bus ride once, or even
a dozen times, you'll never sec the things that Vincent Shecan saw.

He saw the River Ebro
red with the blood of Spain, wind
ing its sluggish way through the I
streets of London town, marking the j
boundary between English pride, !
English complacence, and the ruin
that war has brought to Spain.
The Ebro, scene of the Loyalist j
stand before Barcelona, symbolizes i
the Spanish war to Sheean, and the i
British symbolize all that is wrong j
with the world today; and he is in a |
position to have an opinion if any
man is, on just what is wrong with
the world.
"Not Peace But a Sword" Is a
"personal history" of the year be
tween March 1938 and 1939. During
that time Sheean shuttled back and
forth between Spain and Prague.
Most of the year, he spent in
Spain, and it is with Loyalist Spain
that he deals most. In the Spanish
conflict he found his only hope, for
there he saw men actually fighting
for their ideals against Fascism. The
typification of that ideal he found in
young Jim Lardner, the last volun
teer to enter the Abraham Lincoln j
Brigade, and the last man of that
brigade to be killed. His chapter on
Lardner is one of the most moving
in the book.
Like his fellow-newspaper man,
Pierre van Paassen, Sheean sees
little hope for the world as it stands,
and his book is a beautifully written
proof of his contention. He is pri
marily a reporter, but he is not an
objective reporter. He feels the
things he reports, and his emotion
colors every line of his book. For
this reason, it's a good book, but a
hopeless one.—Nowell

ing its sluggish way through the I
streets of London town, marking the j
boundary between English pride, !
English complacence, and the ruin
that war has brought to Spain.
The Ebro, scene of the Loyalist j
stand before Barcelona, symbolizes i
the Spanish war to Sheean, and the i
British symbolize all that is wrong j
with the world today; and he is in a |
position to have an opinion if any
man is, on just what is wrong with
the world.
"Not Peace But a Sword" Is a
"personal history" of the year be
tween March 1938 and 1939. During
that time Sheean shuttled back and
forth between Spain and Prague.
Most of the year, he spent in
Spain, and it is with Loyalist Spain
that he deals most. In the Spanish
conflict he found his only hope, for
there he saw men actually fighting
for their ideals against Fascism. The
typification of that ideal he found in
young Jim Lardner, the last volun
teer to enter the Abraham Lincoln j
Brigade, and the last man of that
brigade to be killed. His chapter on
Lardner is one of the most moving
in the book.
Like his fellow-newspaper man,
Pierre van Paassen, Sheean sees
little hope for the world as it stands,
and his book is a beautifully written
proof of his contention. He is pri
marily a reporter, but he is not an
objective reporter. He feels the
things he reports, and his emotion
colors every line of his book. For
this reason, it's a good book, but a
hopeless one.—Nowell
