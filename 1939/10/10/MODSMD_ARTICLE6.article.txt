# Excom to Deal With Big Game Dance, Bonfire
## Off-campus Dance Committee Reports At Tonight's Session 
### 
Although the Cal game still is a
month and a half away, the Big
Game bonfire will be a major con
cern of Ex Committee at its meeting
tonight at 7:15 o'clock in the Old
Union.
Proposals for a new site for the
bonfire have been considex-ed this
week by a special committee, con
sisting of Ken Koch and Mollie
West, which will make its x*eport
tonight.
Traditionall held in the dry bed
of Lake Lagunita, the bonfire i*an
into administrative disapproval last
yeai\ Chief objection was that it
was too close to Roble and caused
hysteria among the freshman
women.
ENCINA SITE BANNED
When the subject was discussed by
Ex Committee last year, Encina
spoixsox-s argued that a bonfire close
to Encina would have a similar ef
fect on the freshman men who, it
was felt, would spend the night be-
J fore the rally running in and out of
i the building looking for Cal raidei's.
Another objection to the lake bed
j site was the expense of clearing
| away the ashes and debx-is left over,
i At the same meeting, the commit
tee will hear a report on the off
campus dance pi'oposed for Big
Game night. Ken Koch, pi-esident
of Cardinals, will i'epoi~t progx*ess of
plans for the dance.
CAMPUS FAVORS DANCE
Campus sentiment is in favor of
such a dance, with its tentative top
price of $5 a couple, according to
Ned Pugh, dance chaii-man for
Cardinals. Assisted by Jack All
tucker and Sue Hyman, he has been
sampling opinion, reporting, for ex
ample, that 50 per cent of Encina
residents favor the dance.
Deans Bunn and Yost are with
holding their approval until plans ai-c
more definite, but they have voiced
enthusiasm for the pxoposal of an
inexpensive, off-campus celebration
after the game.
