### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
A LL most people know about Fin
land is that she pays her wax
debts and has planned to become
host to the 1940 Olympics.
Until last night that's all most
people needed to know. But the
fact that the Finnish fleet was mo
bilizing at a port on the Baltic in
quiet readiness to transport troops
and war supplies to the neighboring
Aaland islands if they're threatened
by Russia, popped the little north-
European power into the world's
headlines.
It is a futile gesture of defiance
to the Soviets, a brave but hopeless
stand against J. Stalin and V. Molo
tov's series of steel-ribbed buffer
alliances. Russia already has com
pleted her diplomatic conquest of
Latvia and Lithuania. The proce
dure was the same in both cases —
troops massed along the frontier,
provocation of an incident, such as
the sinking of a Soviet trading ves
sel by a Polish submarine that had
its base in a Baltic port, a summons
by Molotov to "come see me at
Moscow."
* * *
A ND, in the preceding cases, the
results have been the same—
Iho conference between foreign
chieftains of the brow-beaten na
tion and Soviet reaches a "satis
factory conclusion." That conclu
sion gives virtual protectorate
rights to the Russians.
It was inevitable that Finland
should be next on the list of the
Baltic line for the Soviet backfield.
Russia carries the ball and calls the
signals; the Baltics run interfer
ence.
Maybe Finland will fool the Rus
sians, though. The natives appeared
calm and resolute to defend their
neutrality if it's challenged. The
Finnish political delegation, instead
of rushing by airplane to Moscow as
did the representatives of the other
little countries, journeyed soberly
by train. They weren't hurrying;
they were taking their time as dele
gates from a free, neutral power.
Meanwhile, Helsingfors was
shrouded in darkness. It was the
first blackout in Finnish history.
Large-scale evacuation of the prin
cipal cities vulnerable from the air
was being carried out simply as a
"precautionary measure."
# *
IT WAS estimated that about
124,000 persons from the capital
would seek greater safety in the
country. Sixty-four thousand per
sons, comprising those under 16
years of age and all ill persons,
were ordered out by the authori
ties. There were an additional
60,000 who volunteered to leave the
capital in order to clear the city
and facilitate government activi
ties there.
Silently, systematically, six trains
moved through the night with their
packcd human cargoes, carrying
civilians from Helsingfors and Vi
borg to small, decentralized coun
try refuges.
It was an evacuation free from
hysteria, business-like, engineered
with assurance and dignity. There
was no hasty scrambling, no mobbed
streets and frenzied declarations.
But little Finland had crept, into
the spotlight of world attention
again.
And this time, by some quirk that
shifted the law of averages that make
nations first loved and then hated,
Finland is still a sympathetic sight.
She pays her war debts and pro
duces the world's best distance run
ners. And fights a hopeless battle
for an independence that can only
be shaped in Moscow.

was being carried out simply as a
"precautionary measure."

IT WAS estimated that about
124,000 persons from the capital
would seek greater safety in the
country. Sixty-four thousand per
sons, comprising those under 16
years of age and all ill persons,
were ordered out by the authori
ties. There were an additional
60,000 who volunteered to leave the
capital in order to clear the city
and facilitate government activi
ties there.
Silently, systematically, six trains
moved through the night with their
packcd human cargoes, carrying
civilians from Helsingfors and Vi
borg to small, decentralized coun
try refuges.
It was an evacuation free from
hysteria, business-like, engineered
with assurance and dignity. There
was no hasty scrambling, no mobbed
streets and frenzied declarations.
But little Finland had crept, into
the spotlight of world attention
again.
And this time, by some quirk that
shifted the law of averages that make
nations first loved and then hated,
Finland is still a sympathetic sight.
She pays her war debts and pro
duces the world's best distance run
ners. And fights a hopeless battle
for an independence that can only
be shaped in Moscow.
A LL most people know about Fin
land is that she pays her wax
debts and has planned to become
host to the 1940 Olympics.
Until last night that's all most
people needed to know. But the
fact that the Finnish fleet was mo
bilizing at a port on the Baltic in
quiet readiness to transport troops
and war supplies to the neighboring
Aaland islands if they're threatened
by Russia, popped the little north-
European power into the world's
headlines.
It is a futile gesture of defiance
to the Soviets, a brave but hopeless
stand against J. Stalin and V. Molo
tov's series of steel-ribbed buffer
alliances. Russia already has com
pleted her diplomatic conquest of
Latvia and Lithuania. The proce
dure was the same in both cases —
troops massed along the frontier,
provocation of an incident, such as
the sinking of a Soviet trading ves
sel by a Polish submarine that had
its base in a Baltic port, a summons
by Molotov to "come see me at
Moscow."
* * *
A ND, in the preceding cases, the
results have been the same—
Iho conference between foreign
chieftains of the brow-beaten na
tion and Soviet reaches a "satis
factory conclusion." That conclu
sion gives virtual protectorate
rights to the Russians.
It was inevitable that Finland
should be next on the list of the
Baltic line for the Soviet backfield.
Russia carries the ball and calls the
signals; the Baltics run interfer
ence.
Maybe Finland will fool the Rus
sians, though. The natives appeared
calm and resolute to defend their
neutrality if it's challenged. The
Finnish political delegation, instead
of rushing by airplane to Moscow as
did the representatives of the other
little countries, journeyed soberly
by train. They weren't hurrying;
they were taking their time as dele
gates from a free, neutral power.
Meanwhile, Helsingfors was
shrouded in darkness. It was the
first blackout in Finnish history.
Large-scale evacuation of the prin
cipal cities vulnerable from the air
was being carried out simply as a
"precautionary measure."
