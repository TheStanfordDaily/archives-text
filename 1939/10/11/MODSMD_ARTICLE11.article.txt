# Lake Bed Only Spot For Bonfire
## Ex Committee Rules Out Other Locales For Big Game Fete 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
The dry bed of Lake Lagunita is
the only possible place to hold the
Big Game bonfire.
That's what Ex Committee decid
ed at its meeting last night, after it
had heard the report of Ken Koch
and Mollie West, who have been in
vestigating the situation.
President Ken Cuthbertson re
minded members that Dr. Wilbur
was very much displeased by out
side complaints of hysteria occa
sioned by the bonfire last year.
PUBLICITY DISLIKED
Larry Livingston, Daily editor,
declared that what Dr. Wilbur really
disliked was outside publicity caused
by non-academic activities such as
the bonfire.
And Jane Greenwood reminded
members that the bonfire last year
"bothered Miss Yost clear down in
her house."
But there is no other possible site
for the traditional ceremony of the
night before Big Game, according
to the subcommittee's report.
KOCII REPORTS
Koch reported his investigation of
the field next to the Encina tennis
courts. According to Ernest Erwin,
assistant comptroller, whom Koch
interviewed, this site would involve
a fire hazard, since it would bring
the fire too close to the eating clubs
and the highly inflammable band
house. Besides, this field still has
stubble on it, he said.
Mollie West found another field
that looked satisfactory—wide, long,
and burned off—she reported. But.
Mr. Erwin told her it was out of
the question, since the field was be
ing prepared for fall ploughing, she
said.
Although President Cuthbertson
says he has heard indirectly of ad
ministrative disapproval of a lake
bed bonfire, he reported no direct
request on this subject. He said no
action need be taken until the atti
tudes of Miss Yost, and Dr. Wilbur
have been ascertained.

KOCII REPORTS
Koch reported his investigation of
the field next to the Encina tennis
courts. According to Ernest Erwin,
assistant comptroller, whom Koch
interviewed, this site would involve
a fire hazard, since it would bring
the fire too close to the eating clubs
and the highly inflammable band
house. Besides, this field still has
stubble on it, he said.
Mollie West found another field
that looked satisfactory—wide, long,
and burned off—she reported. But.
Mr. Erwin told her it was out of
the question, since the field was be
ing prepared for fall ploughing, she
said.
Although President Cuthbertson
says he has heard indirectly of ad

request on this subject. He said no
action need be taken until the atti
tudes of Miss Yost, and Dr. Wilbur
have been ascertained.
