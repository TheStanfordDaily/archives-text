Those walls, Ihose sinister walls.
Behind them child prodigies must
be building skyscrapers in the first
grade, running a newspaper in the
second, and discussing Freud in the
fifth. But no, Stanford's unit within
a unit, the Row grade school is just
plain school.
What does go on behind those
walls? Well, this past week the
children of the second grade have
been working out a dairy project,
even going so far as to make butter
and cottage cheese, and going still
farther by eating these products.
"They've made a model farm and
colored in pictures of four different
types of cows, and even gone so far
as to write poems about milk," a
pleasant teacher said.
From under a pile of blue and or
ange cows she produced a few
sheets of paper containing these po
ems, the best of which sounded
strangely like a product of Gertrude
Stein's grey matter and ran:
"Come butter come
Oh! such fun!
To see the butter tome
Come butter come."
Just as pleasant was Mr. A. W.
Beach, the school's principal, who
graduated from Stanford in 1030 and
returned to take over his present
position four years ago.
"This school first grew out of the
need for some place to educate the
children of Stanford's faculty mem

on to say that back in October of
1892 a kindergarten had been formed
in one of the Engineering Buildings
and taught by advanced students of
education.

Although the subjects studied are
considerably advanced, the 125 stu

have changed little. There is still
the little blond, banged boy who
writes with his head lying flat on the
desk, and the rough-and-tougher
who squashes little Charlie's clay
man as he walks down the aisle.
And there is still the little girl
who reads, her lips moving, with
popped eyes the story of how Tony
is giving Ned a wash, wash, wash;
and the little girl in the pink dress
who wiggles and squirms and is al

Although the subjects studied are
considerably advanced, the 125 stu
dents, who after all are the school,
have changed little. There is still
the little blond, banged boy who
writes with his head lying flat on the
desk, and the rough-and-tougher
who squashes little Charlie's clay
man as he walks down the aisle.
And there is still the little girl
who reads, her lips moving, with
popped eyes the story of how Tony
is giving Ned a wash, wash, wash;
and the little girl in the pink dress
who wiggles and squirms and is al
ways wandering around the room
hitching up her panties. No —things

Behind them child prodigies must
be building skyscrapers in the first
grade, running a newspaper in the
second, and discussing Freud in the
fifth. But no, Stanford's unit within
a unit, the Row grade school is just
plain school.
What does go on behind those
walls? Well, this past week the
children of the second grade have
been working out a dairy project,
even going so far as to make butter
and cottage cheese, and going still
farther by eating these products.
"They've made a model farm and
colored in pictures of four different
types of cows, and even gone so far
as to write poems about milk," a
pleasant teacher said.
From under a pile of blue and or
ange cows she produced a few
sheets of paper containing these po
ems, the best of which sounded
strangely like a product of Gertrude
Stein's grey matter and ran:
"Come butter come
Oh! such fun!
To see the butter tome
Come butter come."
Just as pleasant was Mr. A. W.
Beach, the school's principal, who
graduated from Stanford in 1030 and
returned to take over his present
position four years ago.
"This school first grew out of the
need for some place to educate the
children of Stanford's faculty mem
bers," he explained. He even went
on to say that back in October of
1892 a kindergarten had been formed
in one of the Engineering Buildings
