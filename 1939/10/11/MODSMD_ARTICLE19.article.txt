# Tex Byrd Turns Down Head Track Coach Post For Academic Career
## B.A.C. Officials Fail to Make Second Choice 
### ARCH JENKINS 
The big, black question mark that
has encircled Stanford's track and
field situation for more than a year
has not been erased.
Oliver E. (Tex) Byrd, who only a
week ago was announced by the
Board of Athletic Control as di
rector of track to succeed the ailing
Dink Templeton, disclosed late yes
terday afternoon that he would not
accept the one-year appointment.
The pressure of a promising aca
demic career was advanced by Byrd
as his reason for returning the con
tract.
At the same time, B.A.C. officials
would give out little information as
to a probable successor to the man
who was supposed to succeed the
veteran Templeton.
SURPRISE AT REFUSAL
While Byrd and a few intimates
had known of his inclination toward
a strict hygiene-instructing career
ever since the selection had been
made, most of them were still sur
prised when he finally announced—
first to the men he was to coach—
that he could not accept the Uni
versity's proposal.
"Dr. Wilbur and I feel," he told
The Daily, '"that my greatest future
lies in the academic field. Anything
I would accomplish in track and field
would necessarily damage that pur
suit."
•Byrd's future team members were
openly down-hearted at the dis
closure. There was nothing but "si
lence when he gathered them around
him at the start of daily practice to
tell of his decision.
CREATES OPTIMISM
He had apparently already begun
to create a new air of optimism and
good feeling toward Stanford track.
Byrd's training methods and his
ability to lead men had already been
noted in his years at the head of six
great San Mateo Junior College
teams. Stanford track candidates
and supporters were known to have
been counting on Byrd, young and
industrious, to maintain the high
level which Templeton had created
for countless Indian cinderpath
teams.
While Byrd will now confine his
efforts to class-room work and re
search, the other B.A.C. appoint
ments in track will remain as pre
viously announced. Bill Ellington is
to continue his long reign as fresh
man mentor while Jack A. Weiers
hauser, former national 220-yard
dash and low hurdle champion, will
begin his active career as varsity as
sistant to whomever the B.A.C. ap
points to succeed Byrd and Temple
ton.

ever since the selection had been
made, most of them were still sur
prised when he finally announced—
first to the men he was to coach—
that he could not accept the Uni
versity's proposal.
"Dr. Wilbur and I feel," he told
The Daily, '"that my greatest future
lies in the academic field. Anything
I would accomplish in track and field
would necessarily damage that pur
suit."
•Byrd's future team members were
openly down-hearted at the dis
closure. There was nothing but "si
lence when he gathered them around
him at the start of daily practice to
tell of his decision.
CREATES OPTIMISM
He had apparently already begun
to create a new air of optimism and
good feeling toward Stanford track.
Byrd's training methods and his
ability to lead men had already been
noted in his years at the head of six
great San Mateo Junior College
teams. Stanford track candidates
and supporters were known to have
been counting on Byrd, young and
industrious, to maintain the high
level which Templeton had created
for countless Indian cinderpath
teams.
While Byrd will now confine his
efforts to class-room work and re
search, the other B.A.C. appoint
ments in track will remain as pre
viously announced. Bill Ellington is
to continue his long reign as fresh
man mentor while Jack A. Weiers
hauser, former national 220-yard
dash and low hurdle champion, will
begin his active career as varsity as
sistant to whomever the B.A.C. ap
points to succeed Byrd and Temple
ton.
The big, black question mark that
has encircled Stanford's track and
field situation for more than a year
has not been erased.
Oliver E. (Tex) Byrd, who only a
week ago was announced by the
Board of Athletic Control as di
rector of track to succeed the ailing
Dink Templeton, disclosed late yes
terday afternoon that he would not
accept the one-year appointment.
The pressure of a promising aca
demic career was advanced by Byrd
as his reason for returning the con
tract.
At the same time, B.A.C. officials
would give out little information as
to a probable successor to the man
who was supposed to succeed the
veteran Templeton.
SURPRISE AT REFUSAL
While Byrd and a few intimates
had known of his inclination toward
a strict hygiene-instructing career
ever since the selection had been
made, most of them were still sur
prised when he finally announced—
first to the men he was to coach—
that he could not accept the Uni
versity's proposal.
