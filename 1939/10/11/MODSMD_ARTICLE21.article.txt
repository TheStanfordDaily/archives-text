# Petitions Still Circulating For Student Body Positions
## Struggle Looms as Grad Women Battle for Excom Recognition 
### 
As Stanford swings into its sec
ond day of nominating today for the
two vacant student body positions,
graduate representative on Ex Com
mittee and one seat on Men's Coun
cil, what was flaky rumor yesterday
has now crystallized into prophecy.
At least five petitions were circu
lated in Stanford's informal tribu
nal, the Cellar, yesterday, and by 3
o'clock signers were at a premium.
So well publicized was the gradu
ate women's campaign last spring
quarter for specifically designated
representation on Ex Committee that
election and student body officials
recalled only late yesterday that the
campaign had not been crowned
with victory. The constitutional
provision still calls for "two gradu

ates"; men, therefore, are eligible.
Student nominees whose names j
appeared on the petitions included [
Marie "Putzie" Hinrichs, Betty Ba
ker and Elster Haile for (he Ex Com- j
mittee representative job. The name j
of Lucille Casey, Delta Gamma, was j
also mentioned as having appeared
on a petition for this position.
The Men's Council seat drew down
less comment and supposedly fewer I
petitions. However, Bill Parrish and
Gordon Weber were two names }
mentioned on the long white sheet ,
dropped in the nominations boxes on 1
the Law Steps.
The nominations will continue to
day, according to Bill Leckie. elec- 1
tion board chairman, from 8 to G
o'clock.
