BOSTON, Oct. 11 (UP). — The
greatest Antarctic expedition in his
tory—both in numbers and acces-
I sories—is being assembled here for
| what may be a tortoise-like race
| with Nazi scientists for minerally
' rich South Polar areas.
A century after the first United
States Antarctic expedition, this
second government-financed group
will set out directed by Rear-Admi
| ral Richard E. Byrd, who twice in
I the last decade has led his own ex
j peditions into the land where nights
I are four months long.
The expedition hopes to leave by
I Nov. 1, reaching its destination
i when harbors are ice-free and if
possible ahead of parties reportedly
organizing in "Germany and other
countries."
