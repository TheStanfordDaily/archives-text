# Daladier Rejects German Proposal, Blasts Hitler's Chance for Quick Peace
## England Expected to Follow French Lead, Turn Down Nazi 'Victors' Terms in Public Answer Thursday 
### United Press 
French Premier Edouard Daladier has blasted Adolf Hitler's German
peace balloon, veteran American observers in Paris believed Tuesday
night.
The sole hope left for peace negotiations on a basis of the German
Chancellor's Reichstag speech, these observers said, rested with British

Prime Minister Neville
lain, who gives Britain's answer to
Germany on Thursday.
Considering the close relationship
of the foreign policies of Britain and
France during the past year, it ap
peared probable Chamberlain, like
Daladier, would give Hitler's "vic
tor's texms" an equally firm rejec
tion.
DALADIER ASKS SECURITY
Daladier said the Allies would ac
cept only a peace '"based on the se
curity of nations, guaranteed re
ciprocally, without the danger of
surprises."
Germany, where Hitler reiterated
his peace proposal and his threat to
wage destructive war if the Allies
prolong the conflict, took Daladier's
pronouncement calmly.
Daladier opened no doors to nego
tiation. He made no counter pro
posals beyond saying if Hitler really
wants peace it must be based on the
security of all nations, reciprocally
guaranteed.
REPORTS CONFLICT
There were, as usual, conflicting
claims regarding the fighting in the
North Sea between the British fleet
and the German air force. Germany
claimed six hits had been scored on
British warships during Nazi bomb
ing raids. Britain said no British
ship was hit. Neutral reports said
several German planes were forced
to land in neutral countries along
the coast, some of them badly shot
up.
Heavy artillery fire by both sides
continued on the Saar and Moselle
sectors of the western front.
FINNS TENSE
The tense situation between Rus
sia and Finland moved toward a cli
max. The first blackout in Helsing
fors' history and large-scale evacu
ation of Finnish cities vulnerable
from the air were undertaken as a
political delegation journeyed to
Moscow to learn what demands the
Soviet is making on Finland. Fin
land had the active support of Swe
den, where more reserves were
called up, and the complete sym
pathy of the other Scandinavian
countries as she entered what may
be a historic test.
Neutrality legislation still was the
all-important topic in Washington.
Former President Herbert Hoover,
answering "requests" for advice from
several Senators and Representa
tives, proposed an alternative course
to "lessen the dangers which the
present alternatives of repeal or no
repeal present." He favors the free
sale of pursuit planes, light obser
vation planes, anti-aircraft guns and
their ammunition and other instru
ments for defense against attack on
civilians. He proposed to prohibit
"the sale to anybody at any time of
weapons of attack on civilians."
