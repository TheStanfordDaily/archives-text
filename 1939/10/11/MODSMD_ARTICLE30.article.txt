nent faculty men will team with
student leaders in a contest of speed
and skill. Two years ago Dean John
Bunn and A.S.S.U. President Beebs

pions of the three-legged art, but
last year an as-yet-unsettled dispute
arose over the decision.
The Lee-Bunn combination again
crossed the line first but were dis
qualified for jumping the gun. The
next team, Jack Alltucker and Jack
Calderwood, was also disqualified
because of doubt as to Calderwood's
faculty status, and the decision went
to Professor Leland Chapin and
A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthbert

tling an old fight, and Dean Bunn is
rumored to be practicing with a
new partner.

baseball games, one between upper
classmen and the faculty of the edu
cation department, and the other the
traditional battle between the fresh
