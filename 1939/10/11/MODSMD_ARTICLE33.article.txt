# Farm's fourth Stringers Represent Bruin Team, Scrimmage with Varsity
## First Regular Scrimmage of Week Will lie Test Under Fire of Pool, Corky Donahue in New Positions 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
U.C.L.A.'s tool ball offense, nee Stanford's fourth stringers. made its de
luil against Tiny Thornhill's regulars in a dummy scrimmage yesterday.
Standius for Kenny Washington and Jackie Robinson, the two sepia
halfbacks who figure to give the Indians (lie time of their lives come
Saturday, ran oil Bruin plays given them by Husky Hunt, Card scout.

Whether the firsts, seconds, and
thirds will be able to stop Washing
ton and Robinson, in practice at
least, will be left until the week's
first hard scrimmage this afternoon.
It will then be Hamp Pool's first
test under fire from his new quar
terback position and Corky Dona
hue's initial appearance at right
tackle.
MULLIN REPLACES ALBERT
In the dummy drill "Moon" Mul
-lin replaced Frankie Albert at left
half and appears to be a probable
starter Saturday at that position un
less Tiny decides to work Thor Pet
erson at that job. Jim Groves and
Norm Standlee remained at their
usual assignments.
John Kerman and Dave Patterson
moved up to the first string with the
shifting of Pool and Donahue to new
duties. The ends were Stan Graff
and Andy Stojkovich with Stan An
dersen at his usual left tackle sta
tion.
Reports from the north following
the U.C.L.A. - Washington debacle
which the Southerners won, 14-7,
trickled into the Stanford camp to
the effect that the Bruin deception
of reverses and fake reverses to both
sides of the line is practically flaw
less. That means that the Stanford
flanks and tackles will be given a
thorough testing when they run
across "Babe" Horrell's outfit in the
stadium.
DONAHUE RIGHT TACKLE
Donahue's special job will be to
strengthen a department which has
been noticeably weak from the Ore
gon State game and which was
helped out not the least by the Ore
gon tilt last week. Pool's addition
to the backs is expected to put a
faster blocker in front of Standlee,
Groves, and Mullin, when they are
carrying the mail.
Although the fourth stringers
who run through U.C.L.A. plays
don't resemble in playing ability or
looks Washington or Robinson, the
varsity line and backs at least had a
pretty good look at what will be
thrown at them by the opposition
Saturday.
Both Negroes' greatest forte is
their broken field running, for it was
Robinson's spectacular return of a
Washington punt that put the Bruins
in position for one of their scores
last week.
