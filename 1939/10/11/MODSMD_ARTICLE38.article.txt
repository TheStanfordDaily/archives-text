### 
With all l)ii( one man a veteran of at least a year's varsity experience,
Harry Maloney's Card soccer eleven will take the field this afternoon to
open the season against a Men In Junior College team.

will he the only man in the Stanford starting line-up who has not won

i his Circle S at least once. Five,
j members of the first team have won
their varsity award twice.
Menlo, in spite of the handicap of
a small student body, always has a
strong soccer team. Last year they
gave the Indians a good tussle in
| both games played, and they expect
j to field a much more powerful out
fit this afternoon.
GOOD ACCOUNT EXPICCTED
Harry Maloney expects his Indian
booters to give a very good account
| of themselves in conference compe-
I tition this fall, as the 40-man squad
I is replete with capable, experienced
j players. He has been shifting his
j men around some in practice to make
! them used to playing several posi
i tions, anticipating possible injuries
at key posts.
The starting line-up, tentatively,
! will have Tito Sanz-Agero in the
j net, Captain Bill Hamilton at right
; back, Cam Pierce at left back, Wil
i son Clark at right half, Bill Ed
| wards at center half, Ken Cuthbert
: son at left half, Bill Arrasmith at
j outside right, George Dole at inside
! right, Francis Morgan at center
I forward, A1 Pellas at inside left, and
| Chris Sontum at outside left.
RESERVES TO SEE ACTION
Reserves whom Maloney thinks
! will see action include Goalie Rudy
; Munzer, backs Ned Pugh and Doug
Wilhoit, halves Grayson Bryan, Joe
! Coberly, Dave Mackenzie and Dick
I Macey, and forwards Roger Man
j waring, George LaNiceo, Lee Cham
' pion, Amilio De Jauregui and Teller
I Weinmann.
The game, which will start prompt
i ly at 4 o'clock, will bo played on
i the varsity soccer field back of the
! tennis courts. As usual, there will
j be no admission charge.
