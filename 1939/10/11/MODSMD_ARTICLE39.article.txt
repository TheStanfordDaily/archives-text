### 
The good news that Hank Nor
burg, injured first-string end, will
; be ready for the Little Big Game
| and word from Coach Harry Ship
i key that he was pleased with every
, player who performed last Satur
| day cast an atmosphere of optimism
, over the frosh field.
A total of 43 men, almost 4 full
teams, were in action against Placer.
| Shipkey says that all handled them
j selves well, but that there are still
a few things to iron out before per
j fection.
Other good news came from Milt
! Vucinich, who said that his arm is in
| good enough shape to pass again.
1 Shipkey will probably have Milt
! doing a lot of practice pitching this
week.
