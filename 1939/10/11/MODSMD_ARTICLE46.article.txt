TAKE it or leave it.
That was the essence, if not the wording,
of the report submitted to Ex Committee last
night, stating that the Lagunita lake bed is the
only available location for the Big Game bon
fire.
After inspecting all possible sites and con
ferring with the Comptroller's office on the
question, Ken Koch and Mollie West stated that
every place considered was put out of the run
ning either because it was leased to outside
interests or because of fire hazard.
These findings leave the student body with
no alternative. Either it is the lake bed or i\ is
nothing.
A great many traditions have filtered through
Stanford's fingers during its first 50 years. But
it will take more than administrative disap
proval or a campus vote to kill the spirit of
the Big Game.
There are a number of things to be gained
from four years in college besides what is
learned in classes and from taking part in stu
dent activities. The thrill of the week preced
ing the Cai game in Encina—building the bon
fire, guarding it, and watching it burn—is one
of these.
Stanford graduates remember it long after
they have forgotten everything they learned in
Biology 1.
Aside from Roble "hysteria" and the stealing
of combustible property, both of which can be
eliminated by student co-operation, the sole ad
ministrative objection to the pyre seems to be
the publicity given to it in outside newspapers
—"not the kind of publicity Stanford wants."
Thus the case rests: which would be more
valuable to the University and its students—the
bonfire, or the elimination of outside notoriety?
The possible damage to Stanford's reputation
that might be suffered due to newspaper stories
about a strictly usual and appropriate celebra
tion would be slight in comparison with the
effects of permanently smothering the bonfire.
Without it, there remains the game — but
minus the Big Game spirit.
Once born, that feeling does not die as soon
as the celebration is over. It is the glue that has
united more than one freshman class, a vital
element in the Stanford tradition of co-opera
tion and friendliness.
The Big Game bonfire must not be sacrificed
to the whims of San Francisco's city editors.
