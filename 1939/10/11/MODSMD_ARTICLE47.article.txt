# Slow Down—or Walk
## 
### 
THE very young man in the fast V-8 cruised
down the narrow street, waving at a few
friends. As he neared the corner he shifted
from high to second and, tires shrilling, muscled
his car around the right-angle turn. Then, curs
ing gently, he jabbed hard at the brake as a
group of students strolled out from behind a
parked car and scattered out of his path.
Tramping hard on the gas pedal he jerked
away from his temporary stop, swinging out
around a well-worn roadster. Grazing past the
ungraceful posteriors of two gay running-board
passengers, he was off again in an irresponsible
spray of gravel.
But he traveled only another block before
stopping again. This time he blandly pulled to
a halt in the middle of the street, turned off the
motor, and left his car to block traffic while he
ran off about his busy little affairs.
Paly High at noon hour?
No, just the University campus any time
around the Postoffice or Union Cellar.
Of course, our young man was very young,
only a freshman. No upperclassman would be
so cavalier about driving on the campus.
But if that is true, then Stanford has a hell of
a lot more freshmen on the campus than the
registrar has in his books.
This week Men's Council and Officer Gordy
Davis are starting a campus traffic safety drive.
They are the ones who know the situation. They
are the law-enforcing and judiciary agencies
who handle cases of traffic violations. Their
drive begins at an appropriate time—the start
of the year. It starts with the sincere best
wishes of The Daily.
There is no reason on earth why this campus
cannot be safe for pedestrians, free from acci
dents; why your own automobile need be
scraped or dented while it is on campus.
High-school habits in driving will not be al
lowed for long at this University, even among

freshmen. Careless driving is a nuisance and a
menace, and it can be stopped.
The campus possesses adequate laws, ade
quate policing. Since it is a community within
itself, law enforcement, and levying of penal
ties, can be made completely effective.
Careless driving need not be tolerated. If a
simple safety drive does not make Stanford
students see their responsibility, an order from
the Administration could. That order, which
might easily follow any too-serious accident,
would simply request students to leave their
automobiles at the campus gates.
Think about that the next time you walk from
the Stadium to the Row. —J. B.
