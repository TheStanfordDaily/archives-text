\7"ESTERDAY'S Campus Opinion decried the im
potence of student self-government. Today's Cam
pus Opinion shoves the wheels of democracy by re
stirring the student-decided issue of the Union's de
ceased nicolodeon. (May it rest in peace!)
The spokesman of the people who writes below is
no doubt a humanitarian and a sociologist of no mean
profundity. He pleads for the weary student, book
worn and haggard, who no doubt gets jarred into a
nice refreshing St. Vitus dance by Benny Goodman and
Artie Shaw. And with even more breadth of vision
this Doctor of Emotions points out that having swing
at the Union will keep Stanfordites away from the
sinks of sin tempting the public down the highway.
Personally, I cannot imagine what den of iniquity pro
motes degeneracy on such a large scale as to warrant
opposition at the expense of Stanford's collective
stomach. We can brave the dangers of the devil, but
that nicolodeon was absolutely unavoidable—like the
Martins and the Coys, deadly at 50 feet.
# * >ii *
of the ruthless record-player claim that
it made $15 a week profit for the student body,
and that it really did not drive hungry people out of
the Union. That people continued to eat at the Union
is true but lamentable. Euchred into eating at the
Union because of its on-campus monopoly (and inci
dentally overcharged), students were practically forced
to endure the tortures of the bilious—for the A.S.S.U.
treasury.
Of what avail is $15 a week if we lose our souls?
And what can our souls possibly amount to if we all
get indigestion? Look at J. P. Morgan's soul. Where
is it? Gone —gone with the appearance of his stomach
trouble. Are we, like Morgan, going to be eternally
damned with a good dose of ulcers? May the great
Cook in Heaven forbid it!
Of course, if the Student Body is set on a nicolodeon,
there are places for it somewhat farther removed from
meals than the Union. The Nitery, for instance. People
can buy their cokes and coffees and hie themselves
upstairs. That would discourage people from playing
the machine—true. But that really isn't so bad at all.
As a matter of fact it might be wise to put steeple
chase obstacles all the way up the stairs.
Eaters make the Union noisy enough. Lets not have
the west-end wiggle to contend with too. One thing
would lead to another. Pretty soon the R.O.T.C. would
be practicing gunnery in the lobby for a floor-show.

of the ruthless record-player claim that
it made $15 a week profit for the student body,
and that it really did not drive hungry people out of
the Union. That people continued to eat at the Union
is true but lamentable. Euchred into eating at the
Union because of its on-campus monopoly (and inci
dentally overcharged), students were practically forced
to endure the tortures of the bilious—for the A.S.S.U.
treasury.
Of what avail is $15 a week if we lose our souls?
And what can our souls possibly amount to if we all
get indigestion? Look at J. P. Morgan's soul. Where
is it? Gone —gone with the appearance of his stomach
trouble. Are we, like Morgan, going to be eternally
damned with a good dose of ulcers? May the great
Cook in Heaven forbid it!
Of course, if the Student Body is set on a nicolodeon,
there are places for it somewhat farther removed from
meals than the Union. The Nitery, for instance. People
can buy their cokes and coffees and hie themselves
upstairs. That would discourage people from playing
the machine—true. But that really isn't so bad at all.
As a matter of fact it might be wise to put steeple
chase obstacles all the way up the stairs.
Eaters make the Union noisy enough. Lets not have
the west-end wiggle to contend with too. One thing
would lead to another. Pretty soon the R.O.T.C. would
be practicing gunnery in the lobby for a floor-show.
MONEY, JIVE, ULCERS
\7"ESTERDAY'S Campus Opinion decried the im
potence of student self-government. Today's Cam
pus Opinion shoves the wheels of democracy by re
stirring the student-decided issue of the Union's de
ceased nicolodeon. (May it rest in peace!)
The spokesman of the people who writes below is
no doubt a humanitarian and a sociologist of no mean
profundity. He pleads for the weary student, book
worn and haggard, who no doubt gets jarred into a
nice refreshing St. Vitus dance by Benny Goodman and
Artie Shaw. And with even more breadth of vision
this Doctor of Emotions points out that having swing
at the Union will keep Stanfordites away from the
sinks of sin tempting the public down the highway.
Personally, I cannot imagine what den of iniquity pro
motes degeneracy on such a large scale as to warrant
opposition at the expense of Stanford's collective
stomach. We can brave the dangers of the devil, but
that nicolodeon was absolutely unavoidable—like the
Martins and the Coys, deadly at 50 feet.
