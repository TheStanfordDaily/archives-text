# CAMPUS OPINION
## GIVE US BACK OUR JIVE 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
It is with a soul full of nostalgia that I remember
those golden days when the nickelodeon filled the
Union rendezvous with the silken chords of "Well, All
Right" and "The Jumpin' Jive."
We students need some escape mechanism to "send
us" out of the sordid monotonous groove that study,
study, study of college life leads us. Therefore I raise
my voice in a prayer for the return of the record
player.
The Cellar is such a respectable place for college
"cats" to get that refreshing pause, but if they can't
get hepped on the campus they might even go down
the white line to one of those "places."
Yours for stellar Cellar swing,
One of the Boys
