# WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS . . .

### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I noticed in the "Campus Opinion" column the
other day a letter from a student who suggested that
the college students of the country get together and
issue a proclamation of some sort or other to the efTect
that they would refuse to go to war on foreign soil.
I naturally agree with the writer of that letter (hat
it would be a great mistake for America to join the
war abroad. However, I think it's about time that
some college student said something about these sup
posedly educated young people who want to tell the
congressmen and President how to run the country.
In the minds of many older people in the country
today, the college student is a spoiled "rah-rah" type
of youth who really knows very little, but who likes to
tell the world what little he docs know. And when I
see the way in which some of us act, I am inclined to
agree with them.
* * # *
'T'HE very idea of our issuing a proclamation for
peace! An act of this kind would make positively
no efTect on the decision of the congressmen, and
would serve only to lower the already-much-laughed
at college student in the eyes of the American public.
If we have any sense at all, we will attempt to study
the situation soberly and possibly even decide what
we would do if we were in the position of those who
will or will not put us into war. And then we'll keep
our mouths shut, at least until the time comes when
we are in a position to say something where it will
have a proper effect.
And let us not lose sight of the fact that our
Congressmen and Senators — yes, even Roosevelt —
know just a bit more about war and national policy
than we who have gotten our information on these
things out of a history or political science book!
There is another popular impression which I would
like to put an end to. In fact, in the very letter to
which I alluded earlier, college students were called
"they who will go first." Under the present mobilization
plans, the first men to go will be the National Guard,
to which very few college students belong.
The second group will consist of a combination of
the regular army and men included in the first draft,
which takes in men between the ages of 21 and 31.
And men under 21 won't be called until the fourth
draft! This information was gotten straight from a
high official on the mobilization committee in Wash
ington, so it is not idle talk.
In closing, may I say that we who have the great
privilege of living in a country such as ours, and at
tending a school such as this, should show our appre
ciation of that fact by looking at this thing a little j
more sensibly, and not by blowing off our mouths j
about how we won't fight to keep it!
Sincerely,
Vic Minahan j
