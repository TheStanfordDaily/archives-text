# Autumn 'Jive' Disc Releases Judged Good
## 
### 
It's an old and easily-proved the
ory that popular music comes in
bunches. That is, several key tunes
climb to popularity together and, al
most simultaneausly, drop out of
sight in the same general period.
After that they're the "memory
tunes" that crop up when the lights
are low and a reminiscent band
leader pulls out. your favorite med
ley. Freddie Martin did it last Fri
day night at the Mural Room.
Anyway, when a retrospective
Stanfordite looks back over autumn
quarter, 1939, there will be several
musical numbers that ought to tab
the time, the place, and the girl.
They're in the better popular re
leases of the day, the memory tunes
of tomorrow.
Goodman has a fairly commercial
rendition of "What's New" on the
new Columbia four-bit disk, num
ber 35211. Louise Tobm sings it in
a lively way and not too well.
LEONARD SINGS
If you share most people's ap
proval of T. Dorsey, you'll like Vic
tor 26339 with "Blue Orchids," the
usual Hoagy Carmichael special, on
one side and "Day In, Day Out," our
current favorite, on the reverse.
Jack Leonard, of course, sings them
both. The background in the second
number is standout stuff. Getting
into an old classic, Dorsey handles
"Tea for Two" (Victor 26321) in a
novel manner. Pee-wee Irwin and
Carmen Mastren do some nice work
on the sax and trumpet, respec
tively.
Freddie Martin's danceable groov
ing of "Running Through My Mind"
(Bluebird B10359) features vocals
by Bill Stoker. It's average Martin,
smooth and sweet.
PAINT SPOT SCORES
For Artie Shaw fans —there still
are some—Bluebird has issued
"When Winter Comes" (19307) with
an unpleasant vocal by Tony Pas
tor. On the back is "I Poured My
Heart into a Song." Slick stuff, with
the characteristic "bended figura
tions," is Shaw's "I Surrender Dear."
The piano, late in the record, is
swell. On the other side is "Lady
Be Good," with a third chorus that
is strictly Golden Bantam. It's Blue
bird 10430.
The old Rodgers and Hart melody,
"You Took Advantage of Me," comes
in for some neat interpretation by
Ziggy Elman (Bluebird 10413). Turn
it over and you have "I'm Yours,"
with a good piano and, naturally, su
perb trumpet work.

For Artie Shaw fans —there still
are some—Bluebird has issued
"When Winter Comes" (19307) with
an unpleasant vocal by Tony Pas
tor. On the back is "I Poured My
Heart into a Song." Slick stuff, with
the characteristic "bended figura
tions," is Shaw's "I Surrender Dear."
The piano, late in the record, is
swell. On the other side is "Lady
Be Good," with a third chorus that
is strictly Golden Bantam. It's Blue
bird 10430.
The old Rodgers and Hart melody,
"You Took Advantage of Me," comes
in for some neat interpretation by
Ziggy Elman (Bluebird 10413). Turn
it over and you have "I'm Yours,"
with a good piano and, naturally, su
perb trumpet work.

It's an old and easily-proved the
ory that popular music comes in
bunches. That is, several key tunes
climb to popularity together and, al
most simultaneausly, drop out of
sight in the same general period.
After that they're the "memory
tunes" that crop up when the lights
are low and a reminiscent band
leader pulls out. your favorite med

day night at the Mural Room.
Anyway, when a retrospective
Stanfordite looks back over autumn
quarter, 1939, there will be several
musical numbers that ought to tab
the time, the place, and the girl.
They're in the better popular re
leases of the day, the memory tunes
of tomorrow.
Goodman has a fairly commercial
rendition of "What's New" on the
new Columbia four-bit disk, num

a lively way and not too well.

If you share most people's ap
proval of T. Dorsey, you'll like Vic
tor 26339 with "Blue Orchids," the
usual Hoagy Carmichael special, on
one side and "Day In, Day Out," our
current favorite, on the reverse.
Jack Leonard, of course, sings them
both. The background in the second
number is standout stuff. Getting
into an old classic, Dorsey handles
"Tea for Two" (Victor 26321) in a
novel manner. Pee-wee Irwin and
Carmen Mastren do some nice work
on the sax and trumpet, respec
tively.
