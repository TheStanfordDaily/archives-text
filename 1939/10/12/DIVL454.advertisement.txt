J This is one you've just pot to have— j
unless you're a bookish fellow given j
to staying indoors. The "watch-case" top j
on this pipe keeps the wind from tearing |

Protects the briar (and that new tweed
tnirfit of yours) from burning.
The slotted grill controls the draft '
perfectly, and slides back sideways for !
filling and emptying. The whole pipe is
trim as a watch and tighr as a clam—
makes all other covered pipes look like
the Gay Nineties. It's the smartest thing
that's come through our doors in many
years—you'll agree as soon as you sec
one. Shown above, No. W
