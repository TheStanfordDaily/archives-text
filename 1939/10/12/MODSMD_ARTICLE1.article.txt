### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
SUNDOWN last night Europe
had slipped through another day
of tenseness, another battle in the
War of Nerves that has taken even
a greater toll than diving bombers
and pounding artillery.
Russian pressure on Finland vied
in importance with the pending fate
of Adolf Hitler's peace deal. And
the powers were tightening their
pressure on the United States, de
termined to draw the world's great
neutral nation into some concert that
would slow the Continent's whirl
pool dive into chaos.
Sweden, Norway, and threatened
little Finland suggested to the
United States a joint overture to
Russia against what they called
"immoderate dealings" with Finland.
Of course, the American state de
partment declined to say if this
country would join in a demarche to
Russia. At any rate, official Wash
ington was conscious that the min
isters of the Scandinavian countries
had called on Cordell Hull and the
President.
* * *
jpUROPE'S fate this winter seemed
to depend, last night, on the
British reply to Hitler's peace ulti
matum which Prime Minister Cham
berlain was expected to make before
Commons today. The toss-up be
tween guns and bombers or a pro
tracted period of diplomatic bar
gaining was the issue at stake.
If anyone were betting 011 the
Chamberlain talk, hardly a fit
matter of chance, they'd know that
the odds were strongly in favor
of guns and bombers. It is safe to
predict that Chamberlain will fol
low pretty closely the lines of
French Premier Edouard Dala
dier's speech earlier this week.
It was expected he'd definitely re
ject Hitler's olfer and probably
would make no counter-proposals.
He might invite Germany to offer
some other, more acceptable basis
for negotiations.
Even Berlin was pessimistic last
night over the chances of Der
Fuehrer's bid for a "victor's peace,"
but continued to fan the feeble
llame of dimming hope that some
thing might come of it. If Berlin
were holding out any really strong
hopes, she apparently did her best
to hide them, for two Berlin devel
opments loomed as possible threats
to the Allies. Threatening the Allies
is no way to persuade Chamberlain
to be kind in his Commons speech
today.

O n , e , of these events that tweaked
John Bull's nose was the an
nouncement that the Nazi air force
had been ordered to continue at
tacks on the British fleet. The other
was an unofficial but apparently in
spired report that high Nazi chief
tains expect to hold a Rome-Berlin-
Moscow conference on Friday or
Saturday to determine the Axis
powers' course of action, in the
event that Chamberlain rejects Hit
ler's peace deal. This very fact—the
planned meeting of the totalitarian
leaders — indicates rather definitely
that Hitler has abandoned serious
hope that his ultimatum will be con
sidered sympathetically.
Finland continued to take 110
chances. Her small navy was mo
bilized; evacuation of her prin
cipal cities continued; her army of
250.0(H) men was massed near the
border and anti-aircraft batteries
were manned.

Meantime, London heard the
news that a Russo-Turkish pact,
would be signed today. This indi
cated that Molotov had pulled an
other winning play out of the bag.
He aced the treaty through under
the noses of French and British
diplomats who had been cooling
their heels in Angora while the Rus
sians took precedence in dealings.
Britain, whistling by the grave
yard in the dark, assured the world
that, after all, she expected to sign
a treaty with Turkey almost any
day now. It would, however, she
murmured almost inaudibly, prob
ably exempt Turkey from taking up
arms against Russia.

Chamberlain talk, hardly a fit
matter of chance, they'd know that
the odds were strongly in favor
of guns and bombers. It is safe to
predict that Chamberlain will fol
low pretty closely the lines of
French Premier Edouard Dala
dier's speech earlier this week.
It was expected he'd definitely re
ject Hitler's olfer and probably
would make no counter-proposals.
He might invite Germany to offer
some other, more acceptable basis
for negotiations.
Even Berlin was pessimistic last
night over the chances of Der
Fuehrer's bid for a "victor's peace,"
but continued to fan the feeble
llame of dimming hope that some
thing might come of it. If Berlin
were holding out any really strong
hopes, she apparently did her best
to hide them, for two Berlin devel
opments loomed as possible threats
to the Allies. Threatening the Allies
is no way to persuade Chamberlain

O n , e , of these events that tweaked
John Bull's nose was the an
nouncement that the Nazi air force
had been ordered to continue at
tacks on the British fleet. The other
was an unofficial but apparently in
spired report that high Nazi chief
tains expect to hold a Rome-Berlin-
Moscow conference on Friday or
Saturday to determine the Axis
powers' course of action, in the
event that Chamberlain rejects Hit
ler's peace deal. This very fact—the
planned meeting of the totalitarian
leaders — indicates rather definitely
that Hitler has abandoned serious
hope that his ultimatum will be con
sidered sympathetically.
Finland continued to take 110
chances. Her small navy was mo
bilized; evacuation of her prin

250.0(H) men was massed near the
border and anti-aircraft batteries

Meantime, London heard the
news that a Russo-Turkish pact,
would be signed today. This indi

other winning play out of the bag.
He aced the treaty through under
the noses of French and British
diplomats who had been cooling
their heels in Angora while the Rus
sians took precedence in dealings.
Britain, whistling by the grave
yard in the dark, assured the world
that, after all, she expected to sign
a treaty with Turkey almost any
day now. It would, however, she
murmured almost inaudibly, prob
ably exempt Turkey from taking up
arms against Russia.
SUNDOWN last night Europe
had slipped through another day
of tenseness, another battle in the
War of Nerves that has taken even
a greater toll than diving bombers
and pounding artillery.
Russian pressure on Finland vied
in importance with the pending fate
of Adolf Hitler's peace deal. And
the powers were tightening their
pressure on the United States, de
termined to draw the world's great
neutral nation into some concert that
would slow the Continent's whirl
pool dive into chaos.
Sweden, Norway, and threatened
little Finland suggested to the
United States a joint overture to
Russia against what they called
"immoderate dealings" with Finland.
Of course, the American state de

country would join in a demarche to
