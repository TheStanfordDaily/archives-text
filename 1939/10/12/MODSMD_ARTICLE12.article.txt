# Leland Stanford's Hobby Aided Movie Development
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Senator Stanford's vocation was railroad*; his avocation was horses.
It was in pursuit of his avocation that he inadvertently stumbled upon
what was, twenty years later, to become Edison's motion picture.
At a party given at the Stanford home one evening in the late autumn
of 1879. the guests gathered in the library to sec the strange surprise the)

►Senator had promised them. Their
polite comments of curiosity changed
to gasps of wonder as they saw the
silhouette of a horse gallop across
the screen hung at the end of the
darkened room. The horse was
called Anderson, and these pictures
represented the successful comple
tion of Stanford's seven-year at
tempt to get photographs of an ani
mal in motion.
IT STARTKI) IN '72
It all started in 1 72 in Sacramento
when the Senator acquired a horse
called Occident. Though untrained,
Occidcnt seemed to have the stuff
that champion trotters are made of,
and the problem of training him
brought up the question of whether
a horse pulled himself by his fore
quarters or propelled himself by
his hind quarters and left the ground
| completely at one point in his stride.
A photographer, Eadweard J.
Muybridge, was brought from San
Francisco to try this first action
photo.
FAILURE AT FIRST
The first pictures failed utterly
| and it was not until 1877 that it was
| proved conclusively that a horse
| dues, al one point during its stride,
| have all four feet off the ground.
The matter hung fire for five years
