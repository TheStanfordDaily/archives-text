# Leland Stanford's Hobby Aided Movie Development
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Senator Stanford's vocation was railroad*; his avocation was horses.
It was in pursuit of his avocation that he inadvertently stumbled upon
what was, twenty years later, to become Edison's motion picture.
At a party given at the Stanford home one evening in the late autumn
of 1879. the guests gathered in the library to sec the strange surprise the)

►Senator had promised them. Their
polite comments of curiosity changed
to gasps of wonder as they saw the
silhouette of a horse gallop across
the screen hung at the end of the
darkened room. The horse was
called Anderson, and these pictures
represented the successful comple
tion of Stanford's seven-year at
tempt to get photographs of an ani
mal in motion.
IT STARTKI) IN '72
It all started in 1 72 in Sacramento
when the Senator acquired a horse
called Occident. Though untrained,
Occidcnt seemed to have the stuff
that champion trotters are made of,
and the problem of training him
brought up the question of whether
a horse pulled himself by his fore
quarters or propelled himself by
his hind quarters and left the ground
| completely at one point in his stride.
A photographer, Eadweard J.
Muybridge, was brought from San
Francisco to try this first action
photo.
FAILURE AT FIRST
The first pictures failed utterly
| and it was not until 1877 that it was
| proved conclusively that a horse
| dues, al one point during its stride,
| have all four feet off the ground.
The matter hung fire for five years

of Palo Alto to serve as a center of scientific research with complete facilities for the study of many mod

i the Palo Alto stock farm were not

was that Muybridge was not avail
able either. He had become involved
in domestic difficulties and was
forced to leave the state after being
acquitted of a murder charge.
In '77 the experiment was re
peated and was crowned with suc
cess, and Senator Stanford became
interested in the more involved task
of getting a series of pictures of the
horse in motion. He gave Muybridge
! carte blanche to experiment as he
pleased with sufficient funds to pur
chase equipment. With the help of
John D. Isaacs, mechanicaJ engineer
on the staff of the Southern Pacific
Company, he arranged a battery of
cameras spaced a foot apart. The
shutters were electrically controlled
l by wires which reacted to the touch
of the running horse's foot.
Muybridge then invented a pro-
I jection machine which he called the
I zoopraxiscope. The machine threw
! the pictures on a screen, syntheti
' cally reproducing the animal's move
j ments.

interested in the more involved task
of getting a series of pictures of the
horse in motion. He gave Muybridge
! carte blanche to experiment as he
pleased with sufficient funds to pur
chase equipment. With the help of
John D. Isaacs, mechanicaJ engineer
on the staff of the Southern Pacific
Company, he arranged a battery of
cameras spaced a foot apart. The
shutters were electrically controlled
l by wires which reacted to the touch
of the running horse's foot.
Muybridge then invented a pro-
I jection machine which he called the
I zoopraxiscope. The machine threw
! the pictures on a screen, syntheti

Senator Stanford's vocation was railroad*; his avocation was horses.
It was in pursuit of his avocation that he inadvertently stumbled upon
what was, twenty years later, to become Edison's motion picture.

polite comments of curiosity changed
to gasps of wonder as they saw the
silhouette of a horse gallop across

It all started in 1 72 in Sacramento
when the Senator acquired a horse
called Occident. Though untrained,
Occidcnt seemed to have the stuff
that champion trotters are made of,
and the problem of training him
brought up the question of whether
a horse pulled himself by his fore
quarters or propelled himself by
his hind quarters and left the ground
| completely at one point in his stride.
A photographer, Eadweard J.
Muybridge, was brought from San
Francisco to try this first action
photo.
FAILURE AT FIRST
The first pictures failed utterly
