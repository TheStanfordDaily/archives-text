# Card Rooters Stage RalJy
## 1300 Students Thornhill, Indians 
### 
Once again the rafters of the
Pavilion rang with the vibrant cheers
and songs of an enthusiastic gang of
Stanford rooters.
Last night's rally for the Bruin
| game Saturday, though only attract
! ing about 1,300, was evidence of the
; fact that Stanford students can let
I yo and yell and sing with vim and
| vigor.
Coach Tiny Thornhill made his
j first appearance before a large group
| of Farm, students this year asking
for their sincere support of the '39
i varsity grid team.
FRIENDLICH SPEAKS
Dick Friendlich, alumnus and
I sports writer on a San Francisco
paper, appeased the hearts of his
| listeners by saying that two breaks
| in last Saturday's Oregon tilt could
have put the Cards on the long end
of the score.
Advance guard of the 2,500 Bruin
rooters and 83-piece band to pour
| into Paly for Saturday's game was
| Fred Koebig, president of the asso
ciated students of U.C.L.A., who re
minded the Farm of the 1925 Card
-1 Bruin game which ended with the
; Southlanders on the short end of an
82-0 score. "That put u.s on our
feet," he said. Koebig was intro
duced by A.S.S.U. President Ken
Cuthbertson.
BUBB LEADS
Charles Bubb led a select swing
; unit of the Stanford Band which
, swung out on two well-played spe
cialty numbers, making people once
I again take notice of the Farm mu-
I sicians.
Johnny Seamans and his assistants
| led the rooters in a new clap yell
: which will be a welcome addition to
I the Farm throat repertoire.
Handling the rally were Jess Haz
lett and Bob Snoddy.
