# New Stern Research Laboratory To Be Formally Opened Today; Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur To Preside
## Glass, Concrete Structure Gift Of Mrs. Stern 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Tlie Ruth Lucic Stern Research
Building, newly completed unit of
the Stanford University School of
Medicine at San Francisco, will be
formally opened today with a re
ception honoring Mrs. Louis Stem,
the donor, and presided over by
President and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur.
Widely known for her interest in
the University, Mrs. Stern presented
Stanford with this modern labora
tory in the name of her daughter
earlier this year. The scientific
house of glass is to be devoted ex
clusively to research, especially in
certain branches of neurology in
which Mrs. Stern is interested.
The building itself, which ad
joins the Stanford School of Nurs
ing at 2330 Clay Street, rises three
stories, each having the maximum
exposure 1o light. This condition
was brought about through the use
of a unique cantilevered construc
tion by the architects, Birge M. and
David B. Clark of Palo Alto. In this
way, the outside wall space, now
filled with windows, is broken by
supports in only four places.
PARTITION REARRANGEMENT
The present division of space in
the laboratories may be changed at
any time by rearranging the parti
tions which now mark off the rooms.
Other features of this scientific cita
del are constant temperature and
dark rooms, sterilizing plants and
animal feeding chambers.
Mrs. Stern, who made an outright
gift of the building last February, is
the widow of Louis Stern, San Fran
cisco and New York manufacturer.
She has lived in Palo Alto for a
number of years and has aided the
city materially through her gifts,
which include the Community Cen
ter, the Children's Theater, and the
Palo Alto Boy Scouts' Fire Circle.
STANFORD ROOM
The high regard in which Mrs.
Stem holds the University is ade
quately demonstrated in her gift of
the new medical unit, her establish
ment of the Ruth Stern Loan Fund
for undergraduates, her gift, of a
fluoroscope for detection of tuber
culosis, but is symbolized even more
personally in her home.
There the visitor will see the
Stanford Room. Its four walls arc
covered with photographs and mo
mentos of prominent members of
I the faculty and student body. A rep
j lica of the Stanford Seal hangs on
j the door to the room.
| RESEARCH IN ALL FIELDS
Anticipating many types of inves
; tigation, the architects have provided
complete and extensive equipment
for work in cancer, tuberculosis, in
fantile paralysis, pediatrics, valley
fever, and many other diseases which
daily beset man and threaten hi.s
life.
According to Dr. Wilbur, it is only
through these gifts and contribu
tions that the tSanford medical units
are able to carry on their quest for
scientific knowledge.

Anticipating many types of inves
; tigation, the architects have provided
complete and extensive equipment
for work in cancer, tuberculosis, in
fantile paralysis, pediatrics, valley
fever, and many other diseases which
daily beset man and threaten hi.s
life.
According to Dr. Wilbur, it is only
through these gifts and contribu
tions that the tSanford medical units
are able to carry on their quest for
scientific knowledge.
Tlie Ruth Lucic Stern Research
Building, newly completed unit of
the Stanford University School of
Medicine at San Francisco, will be
formally opened today with a re
ception honoring Mrs. Louis Stem,
the donor, and presided over by
President and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur.
Widely known for her interest in
the University, Mrs. Stern presented
Stanford with this modern labora
tory in the name of her daughter
earlier this year. The scientific
house of glass is to be devoted ex
clusively to research, especially in
certain branches of neurology in
which Mrs. Stern is interested.
The building itself, which ad
joins the Stanford School of Nurs
ing at 2330 Clay Street, rises three
stories, each having the maximum
exposure 1o light. This condition
was brought about through the use
of a unique cantilevered construc
tion by the architects, Birge M. and
David B. Clark of Palo Alto. In this
way, the outside wall space, now
filled with windows, is broken by
supports in only four places.
PARTITION REARRANGEMENT
The present division of space in
the laboratories may be changed at
any time by rearranging the parti
tions which now mark off the rooms.
Other features of this scientific cita
del are constant temperature and
dark rooms, sterilizing plants and
animal feeding chambers.
Mrs. Stern, who made an outright
gift of the building last February, is
the widow of Louis Stern, San Fran
cisco and New York manufacturer.
She has lived in Palo Alto for a
number of years and has aided the
city materially through her gifts,
which include the Community Cen
ter, the Children's Theater, and the
Palo Alto Boy Scouts' Fire Circle.
