# S.S. Iroquois Docks Safely In New York
## U. S. Vessel Returns Unscathed Despite U-Boat Warnings 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 11 (UP).â€”The
Clyde-Mallory liner Iroquois which
was accompanied halfway across the
Atlantic ocean by U.S. destroyers
and Coast Guard cutters after a Ger
man warning was received that the
ship would be destroyed "like the
Athenia," docked tonight.
The vessel, chartered by the Uni
ted States Lines to bring back 577
war-stranded Americans from Eu
rope, docked at the United States
Lines pier in West Eighteenth Street
on the North River at 8:30 p.m.
The successful completion of the
voyage ended one of the strangest
incidents to date arising from the
European war.
The German warning, given to the
U.S. naval attache in Berlin by
Nazi Grand Admiral Erich Raeder,
was made public last Friday by the
United States government when the
Iroquois was well out in the At
lantic.
VESSEL CONVOYED
The government announcement
said destroyers and Coast Guard
vessels had been sent out to meet
the Iroquois at approximately the
half-way point and bring it into
port.
The government professed not to
take the warning too seriously, but
said it made the announcement to
allay fears which might arise from
rumors and the naval vessels had
been sent out "just in case."
In saying the Iroquois might meet
a fate similar to that of the Athenia,
Raeder apparently was following up
the German contention the sinking
of the British liner at the outbreak
of the war with the loss of more than
a hundred lives was engineered by
the British in order to attract Amer
ican sympathy. The British govern
ment attributed the sinking of the
Athenia to a German submarine's
torpedo and scores of those aboard
the Athenia reported that the ship
was attacked by a submarine.
CAPTAIN'S STATEMENT
Captain E. A. Chelton, commander
of the Iroquois, issued the following
statement;
"I received a warning at 8 a.m.
ship time last Thursday. I called to
gether the ship officers heading the
various departments and told them
about it.
"I instructed them not to talk
about it to the passengers. The news
of the warning didn't leak out to the
passengers. I was very well satis
fied by the way it was taken by the
officers.
"In accordance with the instruc
tions by the government to look for
explosives I had the baggage of pas
sengers searched and also had pri
vate radios taken down and tubes
taken out of the passengers' sets. Of
course the passengers knew that
something was up but they didn't
know what.
"We were about 2,000 miles from
New York when the warning was
received.
"Last Sunday the Coast Guard
cutter Campbell met us about noon.
Then I felt that I should tell the
passengers about the warning that
some other ships might be sunk in
the same circumstances as the Athe
nia was but I did not say that the
Iroquois was one of them.
EXPLAINS TO PASSENGERS
"When the cutter appeared the
passengers naturally wanted an ex
planation so I gave it to them.
"The following day two United
States destroyers (395 and 397) came
in sight and then I again told the
passengers what had happened.
"Personally I did not believe the
sinking would be done but I was
told and I had to believe it until it
was proved otherwise and now it
has proved otherwise."
