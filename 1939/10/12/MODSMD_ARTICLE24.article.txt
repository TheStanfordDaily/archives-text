# Syphilis Tests Reopened Here
## Positive Results In 9 Years": Shepard 
### 
"In my nine years' service at the
Men's Student Health Service, we
have never had a positive reaction
to a Wasserman test," stated Dr.
Charles E. Shepard yesterday, as
the Student Health Service planned
to reopen last year's tests for the
modem white plague, syphilis.
Co-operating once more with the
U. S. Public Health Service, under
Surgeon-General Thomas Parran,
and the California State Bureau of
Venereal Diseases, Stanford's Health
Services are attempting to ascertain
how many people give positive re
actions to the Wasserman blood test
who have not been exposed to syph
ilis, rather than merely trying to
check the amount of the disease on
the Farm, it was emphasized.
Twenty-five other universities, such
as California and Minnesota, have
made extensive studies, also.
LAW REQUIRES TEST
The program of Wasserman test
ing is made more helpful and timely
by the new California state law
which requires "that every man or
woman marrying on or after Sep
tember 19, 1939, must present to the
county clerk a certifiacte signed by
a physician before a marriage li
cense is issued." This certificate
will bear the result of the blood
test. Under the law, any physician
is qualified to make the test and is
sue the certificate.
At Stanford last year no positive
reaction was found in over 600 tests.
REACTION VARIES
Dr. Shepard pointed out that a
positive reaction to a Wasserman
test is not necessarily an indication
of exposure to syphilis, as certain
other conditions may cause a posi
tive reaction. For instance, vaccine
reaction may cause a positive Was
serman, which will turn negative
after the reaction period is over.
The Wasserman tests are being
given in colleges because of the
greater opportunity of selectivity
and because there are supposedly
fewer people there who have been
exposed to syphilis.
Students will be invited to call at
the Health Services for Wasserman
tests at times announced in the
Daily.
