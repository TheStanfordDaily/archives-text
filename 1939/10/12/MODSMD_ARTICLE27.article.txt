# Cards Stop Brain Plays In Heavy Scrimmage
## Tiny Shuffles Hack Defense For Saturday 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Numbers l.'J and 28 on U.C.L.A.'s
pseudo football team were pretty j
well spotted last night.
Numbers 13 and 28 are the jer- j
seys to be worn by the Bruins' I
highly touted Negro running backs, \
Kenny Washington and Lightning |
Jack Robinson, Saturday afternoon I
against our Indians.
So thoroughly did the Cardinal |
first stringers stymie the flashy j,
Bruin offensive at the start of the |
evening's scrimmage that Stanford I
enthusiasts were sincerely hoping
that the line and backs will be in j
the same mood two afternoons i
hence.
Of course the fourth-string imi- !
la tors of the two sepia flashes aren't j
the ball players the Bruin backs are i
â€” Washington and Robinson are two '
entirely different persons.
IJACKFIELI) CHANGES MADE
Tiny Thornhill made two backfield
defense changes yesterday in prac
tice.
Norm Standlee, who has been de
fending the left halfback area, was
moved up alongside of Hamp Pool
as a line backer. Center Jim Ver
dieck took over right half defensive
post, and Jim Groves was over at
Standlce's old job. "Moon" Mull in
was at safety.
The line had Stan Graff and Fred
Meyer at the flanks, and according
to the dope brought back from the
Bruin-Husky tilt, these men will
see plenty of two Ucla speed mer
chants.
TACKLES TIGHTENED
Corky Donahue and Stan Ander- i
sen were the tackles, with Dave Pat- j
terson and John Kerman at the j
guard posts. A no mean job awaits ]
these when Washington or any left i
half spins into the line on fake re- |
verses.
The Southerners' offense usually
starts with the line unbalanced to
the right with the tail-back or
Washington about five yards back.
Fullback Overlin is to his right and
a foot back. Quarterback Matthews
is stationed behind the two guards,
and Robinson at right half is the
wing-back.
In just about per cent of their,
plays, Robinson is the backfield man j
in motion, running to a position so j
that he just about periscopes the !
quarter and full as the ball is snap- 1
pcd and is in a position to take the j
ball on reverses.
Washington usually spins from his i
tail-back post so that he can give |
the ball to Robinson for a reverse i
to the weak side, or can give the j
mail to Overlin for a line buck, or |
spin completely and drive into the j
line himself. He can also pass from j
this same spin so that the Indian |
forwards and backs can expect any
of about a half a dozen things to
come out of one of those plays.
