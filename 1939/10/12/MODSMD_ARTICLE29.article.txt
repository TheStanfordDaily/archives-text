### JERRY MAYER 
LOSS OF BYRD
BLOW TO FARM
It is seldom that a coach can
make as profound an impression in I
a few short days as Tex Byrd did '
with the Stanford trackmen.
Consequently it comes as a dis- j
tinct disappointment that Byrd j
finally refused the position of direc- j
tor of track for Stanford. |
Tiny Thornhill, Everett Dean, |
Harry Wolter, and Byrd—no school |
could have boasted of a finer quar- j
tet of major sport coaches. Every
one of them men with the interests I
of their performers and the honor of J
the school first. None of this "Win
at any price, g d it" coach- |
ing.
Byrd made a tremendous im
pression on the trackmen at a j
meeting he called immediately |
after he was first named as Dink i
Tcmpleton's successor.
"If I tell you to do something, j
and can't give you a good reason j
for doing it. then go ahead and do i
whatever you want to do," he told :
his track candidates. The cinder- j
men took him to their hearts right
then. Here was a man who didn't j
believe in mandatory coercion—a ;
man who would lead them and yet '
entrust in them responsibilities j
that took them out of the class of
unthinking athletic machines.
It is almost in the nature of a
tragedy for Stanford that Byrd fi- j
nally decided that his future was j
in academics rather than athletics. \
But the loss could be more com- i
plete. At least Byrd. in his capacity !
of assistant professor in hygiene and
physical education, will continue at l
Stanford. •
So today Stanford has only !
Thornhill, Wolter, and Dean left.
The other man was lost, accord
ing to rumor, because of some j

finagling on the part of the om
nipotent Board of Athletic Con
trol.
But, hell. I'm only a student here.
Maybe the big-wigs knew what they
were doing when they allowed Byrd
to refuse the position.
I wonder.
SAY IT ISN'T
SO. HOWARD
The subject of athletic coaches
who believe more in the personal
angle of the game than winning, re
minds Slants of an excerpt we clip
ped from a southern California
paper. If it is true (and we have a
hunch it is), it presents a repre
hensible condition that Stanford is
absolutely free of.
The excerpt:
"Between coaching staff and
players at U.S.C.. those 'human
relations' contacts are kept at low
ebb and each man is more of a
machine and so handled. No dis
play of sentiment between player
and head coach is wanted nor is
it attempted after the playqr is
given a good coat of ice on his first
attempt to get chummy with the
boys in charge."
Maybe Tiny could get more out of
his players by resorting to the same
tactics. Perhaps Stanford could
have had winning elevens over the
past few years had Thornhill bull
dozed his players. But any Stan
ford student or alumnus that wants a
winning team under those circum
stances compares unfavorably with
that long-legged little animal that
hops through the swampy ooze —the
toad.
