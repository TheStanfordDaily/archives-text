# Frosh Waterdogs Lose to Paly Hi
## 
### 
Inexperience caused the 12-5 de
feat of the freshman water polo
team in its first game of the season
with Palo Alto High School last
night. The game, which began at
4:30, was held in the 20-by-10 ft.
regulation high school-sized pool at
the University.
The team, which has been playing
together for only two weeks, dem
onstrated poor teamwork and ball
handling. In the game with Sequoia
High School slated for next week,
the waterbabes should do better as a
result of the practice coming in the
intervening period, according to j
Coach Harvey Rothschild.
