## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Frosh Gridders Plan Air Raid Against Troy 'Best Ever"' Trobabes Hope for Revenge In Saturday's Tilt 
### 
Hoping to win their tenrti con
secutive and toughest game in a run
of victories beginning back in 1937,
Stanford's freshmen football team
prepared for Saturday's battle with
U.S.C.'s yearling team in the South.
Yesterday in a practice scrim
mage, the Papoose first and second
string stopped everything thrown at
them in the form of Trojan plays.
A bunch of fourth stringers attempt
ing to imitate the Trobabes' power
ful inside and outside of tackle
slashes failed to make much of an
impression on a couple of gentlemen
named Banducci and Robinson.
Today Coach Harry Shipkey will
send his men through a pass scrim
mage in order to have his best of
fensive weapon, the pitch and catch
act, in near perfection form.
S.C. IS 'BEST EVER'
The U.S.C. outfit is undoubtedly
one of the toughest teams the
Frosh have met since they started
their winning streak two years ago.
Coached by the smart and success
ful Jules Bescos, the Trobabes
romped through Los Angeles City
College's varsity 20-0 last week.
Surely Mr. Bescos hasn't forgotten
that decisive 20-6 victory registered
by Albert and Co. last year. And he
is bound to have something up his
sleeve for those invading Cards.
The cripple situation on the frosh
squad is definitely improved. Bill
Mannon's sprained ankle is in its
best shape in two weeks. It is a
rather temperamental joint, for it
may hold the whole game or might
go out on him on the first play. If
the latter happens there is depend
able Tony Medvord on hand with
plenty of experience to take over.
VUCINICH READY
Though "Red"Taylor. with that
muscle cramp in his leg and Milt
Vucinich with his bruised shoulder
took it rather easy yesterday, both
will be worked hard today and both
will be ready to shoot the works
come Saturday afternoon.
One of the strongest arguments in
favor of Shipkey's team. keeping its
string of victories unbroken this
week-end is the reserve strength it
boasts. Last week 43 men per
formed against Placer Junior Col
lege, and this week Shipkey sees fit
to send 32 players south.
Those traveling south include
Armstrong, Banducci, Brown, Chi
menti, Cole, Dotters, Gadd, Green
ing, Grey, Hammett, Hanlon, Hart,
Hoover, Laracou, Laverty, McCain,
McDonald, Mannon, Medvord, Mil
lington, Morrison, Palmer, G. Rob
inson, R. Robinson, Rubin, Selby,
Stamm, Symes, Taylor, Tellefsen,
Vucinich. and Wolfe.

VUCINICH READY
Though "Red"Taylor. with that
muscle cramp in his leg and Milt
Vucinich with his bruised shoulder
took it rather easy yesterday, both
will be worked hard today and both
will be ready to shoot the works
come Saturday afternoon.
One of the strongest arguments in
favor of Shipkey's team. keeping its
string of victories unbroken this
week-end is the reserve strength it
boasts. Last week 43 men per
formed against Placer Junior Col
lege, and this week Shipkey sees fit
to send 32 players south.
Those traveling south include
Armstrong, Banducci, Brown, Chi
menti, Cole, Dotters, Gadd, Green
ing, Grey, Hammett, Hanlon, Hart,
Hoover, Laracou, Laverty, McCain,
McDonald, Mannon, Medvord, Mil
lington, Morrison, Palmer, G. Rob
inson, R. Robinson, Rubin, Selby,
Stamm, Symes, Taylor, Tellefsen,
Vucinich. and Wolfe.
Hoping to win their tenrti con
secutive and toughest game in a run
of victories beginning back in 1937,
Stanford's freshmen football team
prepared for Saturday's battle with
U.S.C.'s yearling team in the South.
Yesterday in a practice scrim
mage, the Papoose first and second
string stopped everything thrown at
them in the form of Trojan plays.
A bunch of fourth stringers attempt
ing to imitate the Trobabes' power
ful inside and outside of tackle
slashes failed to make much of an
impression on a couple of gentlemen
named Banducci and Robinson.
Today Coach Harry Shipkey will
send his men through a pass scrim
mage in order to have his best of
fensive weapon, the pitch and catch
act, in near perfection form.
S.C. IS 'BEST EVER'
The U.S.C. outfit is undoubtedly
one of the toughest teams the
Frosh have met since they started
their winning streak two years ago.
Coached by the smart and success
ful Jules Bescos, the Trobabes
romped through Los Angeles City
College's varsity 20-0 last week.
Surely Mr. Bescos hasn't forgotten
that decisive 20-6 victory registered
by Albert and Co. last year. And he
is bound to have something up his
sleeve for those invading Cards.
The cripple situation on the frosh
squad is definitely improved. Bill
Mannon's sprained ankle is in its
best shape in two weeks. It is a
rather temperamental joint, for it
may hold the whole game or might
go out on him on the first play. If
the latter happens there is depend
able Tony Medvord on hand with
plenty of experience to take over.
