/ /"KTOTHING too much."
IN The Greeks said it, and it still holds
good.
And yesterday, when a joint meeting of stu
dent officers and administrative heads decided
to apply it to the Big Game bonfire, prospects
of continuing the disputed tradition suddenly
grew bright.
With each succeeding freshman class trying
to outdo its predecessor, no one can deny that
the pyre almost had become an end in itself.
Rather than the central spark for the biggest
rally of the year, it had become a colossal holo
caust which scattered the student body in an
awed and overheated ring instead of uniting
it for songs and yells.
Besides eliminating Roble "hysteria" as a
valid excuse for academic deficiencies among
the freshman women, moving the fire from the
Lagunita lake bed automatically will reduce its
size. Back to its old magnitude, perhaps it will
be able to recapture its original spirit and pur
pose.
At the same time the pledge of Cardinals
Chairman Ken Koch that work on the pyre will
not begin until six o'clock of the morning of
the Big Game rally should prove an effective
block to those Encina men who feel that they
should give up a week of studying in favor of
wood-gathering. And an egually useful answer
to parents who complain that their sons flunked
out of Stanford because they spent all their
time building bonfires.
This year the pyre is on trial. Twice before
the institution has been abolished temporarily
by student voteâ€”because it had grown too big
and meaningless and boring.
A blaze designed to bring the students to
gether instead of forcing them to retreat into
the shadows, with the additional attraction of
a spectacular fireworks display should be a
sensational success.
This year's bonfire must be planned with a
sense of proportion.
Otherwise it will consume itself.
