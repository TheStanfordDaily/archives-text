# It Is More Blessed . . .

THERE are in this world, the philosophers tell
us, a great many rich men who gladly would
contribute their wealth to worthy causes—if
they were sure that their neighbors knew that
they were doing it.
Dazzled by the prospect of personal honor,
too often philanthropists forget to consider first
the good their gift is capable of doing. The
man who erects a monumental edifice or a
statue to his own glory, ignoring the sick and
starving, is no fit subject for public gratitude.
Fortunate is Palo Alto to have Mrs. Louis
Stern as one of its citizens, and fortunate is
Stanford to have her interested in the Univer
sity. For she is one of those unusual people
who know how to give aid where it is needed
most.
Quietly and inconspicuously last February
she donated funds to finance the construction
of a new research laboratory for the Stanford
School of Medicine. Just as gracefully in times
past she had presented the Health Service with
a fluoroscope and had established the Ruth
Stern Loan Fund for undergraduates, as well as
giving a great number of scholarships.
People passing by the strictly utilitarian
building facing the Stanford Hospital in San
Francisco will have no thought of the woman
who built it. The work that will be carried on
in the laboratory will benefit thousands who
never will hear of Mrs. Stern.
And she never will know who they are.
Her name will not be graven across the fa
gade. No giant tower will break the skyline.
For Mrs. Louis Stern there may be only
oblivion.
But to the world she has given health.
