# At Least, Keep It Clean

### 
FOOTBALL games have been won or lost by
the enthusiasm or the lack of enthusiasm dis
played by rooters.
But when rooting is extended beyond the
limits of loyal team support, when it oversteps
normal good taste, it ceases to be an asset and

becomes instead an object of public ridicule
and a real detriment to a university.
Recently, President Sproul, of the University
of California, issued a reprimand to the student
body of that university, charging them with "un
sportsmanlike conduct" and use of profanity
in the rooting section.
The effect of such rooting on the general pub
lic, sitting within an aisle's-width of the rooting
section, is obvious.
President Sproul said, "The thoughtlessness
of the rooting section is creating a reputation
for the University which, if every member
would only think about it, he would regret as
much as I."
The football squad cannot get along without
student support. Enthusiasm from the stands
can keep them sparking even when their backs
are pushed up against the wrong end of the
field.
But unsportsmanlike rooting and objection
able use of profanity, at least to the public's
ears, is most dispensable.
