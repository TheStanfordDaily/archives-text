### SHERMAN MELUNKOFF 
MY DEAR MISS FIGGINS
Y"OUR letter in this morning's Campus Opinion has
made this hard sinner repent. Little did I suspect
that in condemning the Bawlout I was striking at the
purity of womanhood. In fact, I am even now not
convinced of my wickedness. But my native tendency
to be influenced by your sex and the heartfelt sin
cerity of your cause have made me yield in spite of
myself. Hortense, receive my contrite heart.
How stupid of me not to realize the world of in
formation that the Bawlout's tell-tale numbers reveal.
Of course they protect the innocent female blind-date,
by telling her "all" about her prospective escort.
Maybe I was thinking that blind dates are protected
by nature herself—protected with an aspect that is
really no temptation. But I was wrong. You are right.
Any female who ventures on a blind date has reason
to suspect her gentleman friend. And what better
means of protecting oneself than seeing just what a
man's intentions are by looking at his state of plus
ness? Why, that's even better than astrology. And so
much better than consulting a psychiatrist.
# >{t * *
ND when you point out that the Bawlout provides
a means for establishing a person's class standing
and his major, you are really touching divine heights
of logic. I could see Socrates' ghost fairly quivering on
the wings of your arguments. How can a Stanford
girl be expected to think up things to say without
having some little clue, like a person's major?
And can one reasonably expect a defenseless, naive
girl to go out with a freshman posing as a Junior?
Oh, how right you are! The fact is that the Bawlout
has actually been a knight-errant, a Galahad, pro
tecting the stainless grade-consciousness of Roble
women from the sullying attacks of masquerading
Freshmen. Out with the imposters! Long live ihe
Bawlout!
I am certainly glad, Hortense, that you and I were
able to see eye to eye on this matter. You have made
me come to my senses on two fronts: First, with re
spect to the Bawlout itself, as an instrument of date
investigation. And second, in regard to the chaste
state of ignorance from which girls are saved by the
great funds of information in the Bawlout's veritable
encyclopedia of numbers and abbreviations.
Ah, Hortense, accept this fragment of an ode as a
word of parting:
Let the Bawlout's pages e'er unfurl
To save from sin the Stanford girl!

To save from sin the Stanford girl!
MY DEAR MISS FIGGINS
Y"OUR letter in this morning's Campus Opinion has
made this hard sinner repent. Little did I suspect
that in condemning the Bawlout I was striking at the
purity of womanhood. In fact, I am even now not
convinced of my wickedness. But my native tendency
to be influenced by your sex and the heartfelt sin
cerity of your cause have made me yield in spite of
myself. Hortense, receive my contrite heart.
How stupid of me not to realize the world of in
formation that the Bawlout's tell-tale numbers reveal.
Of course they protect the innocent female blind-date,
by telling her "all" about her prospective escort.
Maybe I was thinking that blind dates are protected
by nature herself—protected with an aspect that is
really no temptation. But I was wrong. You are right.
Any female who ventures on a blind date has reason
to suspect her gentleman friend. And what better
means of protecting oneself than seeing just what a
man's intentions are by looking at his state of plus
ness? Why, that's even better than astrology. And so
much better than consulting a psychiatrist.

ND when you point out that the Bawlout provides
a means for establishing a person's class standing
and his major, you are really touching divine heights
of logic. I could see Socrates' ghost fairly quivering on
the wings of your arguments. How can a Stanford
girl be expected to think up things to say without
having some little clue, like a person's major?
And can one reasonably expect a defenseless, naive
girl to go out with a freshman posing as a Junior?
Oh, how right you are! The fact is that the Bawlout
has actually been a knight-errant, a Galahad, pro
tecting the stainless grade-consciousness of Roble
women from the sullying attacks of masquerading
Freshmen. Out with the imposters! Long live ihe
Bawlout!
I am certainly glad, Hortense, that you and I were
able to see eye to eye on this matter. You have made
me come to my senses on two fronts: First, with re
spect to the Bawlout itself, as an instrument of date
investigation. And second, in regard to the chaste
state of ignorance from which girls are saved by the
great funds of information in the Bawlout's veritable
encyclopedia of numbers and abbreviations.
Ah, Hortense, accept this fragment of an ode as a
word of parting:
Let the Bawlout's pages e'er unfurl
To save from sin the Stanford girl!
