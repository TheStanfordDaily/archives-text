# CAMPUS OPINION
## NOW. WE GIRLS THINK . . .

rpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Like most Stanford students, I have come to ac
cept The Daily as equally as important at breakfast
as toast. As a good many are wont to do, I x-ead over
the front page, turn to the back and peruse it for a
while. Under normal circumstances, I then proceed to
the middle pages, finish my breakfast, and go to classes.
This pleasant, if unoriginal, routine, was horribly shat
tered for me this morning.
I began Bull Session and my Wheaties at the same
time. For all I know, the breakfast food of champions
is standing there yet. My appetite left me, my eggs
grew cold, and I snapped bitterly at the hasher when
he made his usual pass at me. All because this self
centered male probably can't read his grade points
without blushing. Does he want to knock out from
under Stanford women one of the few remaining
props? Does he refuse to realize what the Bawlout
has meant to countless confused co-eds since the year
one? Imagine any nice young thing having to make a
decision on a blind date without the aid of this sheet?
It's fantastic, of course.

I 3 OBLE would become the haven of sewing circles,
or alternatively, Stanford Womanhood would be
dragged through the mire. How does he expect a
girl to appraise an unknown male seeking a date. She
has little hope of estimating his intentions not know
ing his grade point. Her margin of safety can only be
determined by this vital figure. Again, what about his
major? How can you possibly tell whether or not he
will be an utter bore without knowing this? A girl
wants something to talk about. Imagine me, a psy
chology major, getting stuck with a Latin whiz. And
he wants to cut out the Bawlout. Another thing, he
may well be a silly freshman, trying to pass off as a
junior. He could quite easily get away with it, too. if
there were no means of checking.
And lastly, what of the social aspect? Doesn't that
mean a thing in Shermie's eyes? Maybe not, but the
girls think differently. How are we to know from
which side of the tracks he comes? Just answer that,
you old roue. Abandon the Bawlout and you just get
that much farther from democracy around here. Where
would Stanford, or more particularly, Roble, be with
out the blind date? And where would the blind date
be without the Bawlout. The very idea just makes me
quiver.
In complete disgust, I remain,
Irritably yours,
Hortense Figgins
