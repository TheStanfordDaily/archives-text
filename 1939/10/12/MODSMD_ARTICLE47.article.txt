# Ginger Turns To Philosophy In New Film
## 
### 
"FIFTH AVENUE GIRL," now
playing at the Fox Stanford.
"It just goes to show," said the
wise old owl, "what Hollywood can
do when it really tries." The wise
old bird had been awakened by the
laughter that shook the rafters yes
terday at the first local showing of
Ginger Rogers' latest flicker called
"Fifth AvenLie Girl."
Although the picture as a whole
does not live up to the standard set
by "Bachelor Mother." the indivi
dual players turn in as good por
trayals as in the earlier picture.
GINGER STARS
Ginger Rogers is the star all the
way. Her philosophical speeches at
the beginning of the picture were
perfectly timed, and the writer de
serves special praise for capturing
the feelings of so many people
without lecturing or giving a soap
box speech.
Miss Rogers is the only actress on
the screen who does not overdo a
drunk scene. The fact was first es
tablished in "Stage Door" and is fur
ther proved in this movie when she
gets drunk with Walter Connelly.
LOVE-SICK CHAUFFEUR
Walter Connelly as the rich "vic
tim of the capitalistic system" mug
ged his way through his usual mis
understood-father part. But he was
good.
Topping the list of supporting
players by right of best perform
ance comes James Ellison. He plays
the part of a love-sick, Volga-boat
man-singing, proletariat chauffeur
of the madcap rich family.
Veree Teasdale returns to the
screen as the Reno-bound wife of
Walter Connelly. She "makes" her
part in the scene in which she fol
lows Connelly up the stairs after she
discovers he has tricked her.
DOUBLE BILL GOOD
It's a pity Tim Holt looks so young.
He really can act, but he gives the
impression of a young boy pre
tending.
The second feature is an English
one starring Clive Brook. It is per
fect in every respect, but it just
misses in a way that can hardly be
described. The story, a mystery, is
fool proof and will keep you guess
ing even after the picture is over.
It is, without a doubt, the best bill
that has hit the town in many
months.—Sprager

understood-father part. But he was
good.
Topping the list of supporting
players by right of best perform
ance comes James Ellison. He plays
the part of a love-sick, Volga-boat
man-singing, proletariat chauffeur
of the madcap rich family.
Veree Teasdale returns to the
screen as the Reno-bound wife of
Walter Connelly. She "makes" her
part in the scene in which she fol
lows Connelly up the stairs after she
discovers he has tricked her.
DOUBLE BILL GOOD
It's a pity Tim Holt looks so young.
He really can act, but he gives the
impression of a young boy pre
tending.
The second feature is an English
one starring Clive Brook. It is per
fect in every respect, but it just
misses in a way that can hardly be
described. The story, a mystery, is
fool proof and will keep you guess
ing even after the picture is over.
It is, without a doubt, the best bill
that has hit the town in many
months.—Sprager
"FIFTH AVENUE GIRL," now
playing at the Fox Stanford.
"It just goes to show," said the
wise old owl, "what Hollywood can
do when it really tries." The wise
old bird had been awakened by the
laughter that shook the rafters yes
terday at the first local showing of
Ginger Rogers' latest flicker called
"Fifth AvenLie Girl."
Although the picture as a whole
does not live up to the standard set
by "Bachelor Mother." the indivi
dual players turn in as good por
trayals as in the earlier picture.
GINGER STARS
Ginger Rogers is the star all the
way. Her philosophical speeches at
the beginning of the picture were
perfectly timed, and the writer de
serves special praise for capturing
the feelings of so many people
without lecturing or giving a soap
box speech.
Miss Rogers is the only actress on
the screen who does not overdo a
drunk scene. The fact was first es
tablished in "Stage Door" and is fur
ther proved in this movie when she
gets drunk with Walter Connelly.
LOVE-SICK CHAUFFEUR
Walter Connelly as the rich "vic
