# Lunchers Told Nazi Motives
## Buchinger Explains Background for War 
### 
Declaring that the European situa
tion should be "handwriting on the
wall" for Americans, Dr, Hans
Buchinger outlined a post war back
ground of current German motives
before a group of 75 at Luncheon
Club yesterday.
Although Dr. Buchinger spoke
with a slight accent, it proved an
adornment rather than an obstacle
to his speech. The young German,
who has taken his Ph.D. at the Uni
versity of Konigsberg, stated at the
outset of his talk that he would not
deal with current European events,
but rather with the background
which motivates them.
Starting with the abuses his
country suffered at the peace of
Versailles, Dr. Buchinger related the
feelings and tendencies of the Ger
man people up through the Czecho
slovakian putsch. He described Hit
ler's philosophy by quoting him:
"No one will get anything if he does
not ask for it." Said Dr. Buchinger:
"It's just like Mother Hubbard
standing before the cupboard with
hands folded."
Any brief which Dr. Buchinger
presented was, however, not one for
Hitlerism, but one for the German
people as a whole.
