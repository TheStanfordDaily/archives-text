# Bonfire Site Moved From Lake Bed
## Change to Eliminate Roble Disturbances, Says Chairman Koch 
### 
The Big Game bonfire will blaze
this year in the open field behind
Branner Hall and east, of the En
cina tennis courts, instead of in the
traditional Lagunita lake bed am
phitheater.
Announced by Cardinals Chair
man Ken Koch, following a meeting
of student and Administration rep
resentatives yesterday, the reason
for the change is to eliminate dis
turbances in Roble that were re
sponsible for a number of freshman
women flunking out of school last
year.
MASS MEETING HELD
"After promising not to start
building the fire until the morning
of the day it was to be burned, En
cina men held a mass meeting on
the lawn in front of Roble and ran
around the tin roof of the building
just before midnight," stated Dean
Yost, "and they started construction
at 12:02 a.m."
President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Dean John Bunn, Vice-President
Coline Upshaw, Senior Woman Mol
lie West, Daily Editor Larry Living
ston, Student Manager John Cobhs,
and Koch also were present at yes
terday's confab.
Meeting the administrative criti
cism that in the past the bonfire has
been responsible for too many
freshmen neglecting their studies,
Koch announced that this year work
on the pyre will not start until 6
o'clock on the morning of the Big
Game rally.
The problem of property being
stolen to swell the size of the fire
will be solved by having an upper
classman on each truck personally
responsible for all combustibles that
arc taken, and by having the bon
fire chairman okay them upon their
arrival at the site, he stated.
NEW SITE APPROVED
"There is no reason why we should
not. have a bonfire as long as it is
kept within reasonable limits," re
marked Dr. Wilbur in suggesting the
new site. The field has been ap
proved by Fire Chief Dugan, who
will regulate the size of the pyre so
that the neighboring fields and band
house will not be menaced.
It was also announced that in or
der to make the bonfire something
more than "a blaze so hot that no
body can approach it," elaborate
fireworks will be a feature of this
year's celebration.
Building the pyre in one day also
is designed to lessen the temptation
for marauders from the University
of California. "Because," stated Dr.
Wilbur, "if property on the campus
of either university is destroyed, the
Big Game will have to be called off."

Building the pyre in one day also
is designed to lessen the temptation
for marauders from the University
of California. "Because," stated Dr.
Wilbur, "if property on the campus
of either university is destroyed, the
Big Game will have to be called off."
The Big Game bonfire will blaze
this year in the open field behind
Branner Hall and east, of the En
cina tennis courts, instead of in the
traditional Lagunita lake bed am
phitheater.
Announced by Cardinals Chair
man Ken Koch, following a meeting
of student and Administration rep
resentatives yesterday, the reason
for the change is to eliminate dis
turbances in Roble that were re
sponsible for a number of freshman
women flunking out of school last
year.
MASS MEETING HELD
"After promising not to start
building the fire until the morning
of the day it was to be burned, En
cina men held a mass meeting on
the lawn in front of Roble and ran
around the tin roof of the building
just before midnight," stated Dean
Yost, "and they started construction
at 12:02 a.m."
President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Dean John Bunn, Vice-President
Coline Upshaw, Senior Woman Mol
lie West, Daily Editor Larry Living
ston, Student Manager John Cobhs,
and Koch also were present at yes
terday's confab.
Meeting the administrative criti
cism that in the past the bonfire has
been responsible for too many
freshmen neglecting their studies,
Koch announced that this year work
on the pyre will not start until 6
o'clock on the morning of the Big
Game rally.
The problem of property being
stolen to swell the size of the fire
will be solved by having an upper
classman on each truck personally
responsible for all combustibles that
arc taken, and by having the bon
fire chairman okay them upon their
arrival at the site, he stated.
NEW SITE APPROVED
"There is no reason why we should
not. have a bonfire as long as it is
kept within reasonable limits," re
marked Dr. Wilbur in suggesting the
new site. The field has been ap
proved by Fire Chief Dugan, who
will regulate the size of the pyre so
that the neighboring fields and band
house will not be menaced.
It was also announced that in or
der to make the bonfire something
more than "a blaze so hot that no
body can approach it," elaborate
fireworks will be a feature of this
year's celebration.
