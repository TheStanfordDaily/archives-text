### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r pHOUGH Neville Chamberlain
may have left the door to peace
slightly ajar in his speech to the
House of Commons yesterday, the
opening is not wide enough to per
mit Adolf Hitler, fresh from Polish
conquest, to squeeze through with
any face-saving proposals.
Chamberlain's bitter denunciation
of Hitlerism branded the Nazi peace
deal as "impossible." Britain could
not agree to negotiate on Hitler's
terms, he said, unless she was will
ing to "forfeit her honor and aban
don her claim that international dis
putes should be settled by discus
sion and not by force."
* i|t
The whole tone of Chamberlain's
reply—and the cheers that greeted
it-—definitely confirmed the belief
that he's as determined now to smash
Hitler as he was to appease the Ger
mans just a year ago. In violent
contrast to his usual unemotional
manner of speaking, Chamberlain
used biting sarcasm in striking out
at what he termed the "unsupported
word" of Hitler.
"The 40-day-old war can be stop
ped only if the Nazi leaders give
convincing proof of the sincerity of
their desire for peace by definite ac
tion and elTective guarantees," he
asserted.
* # *
IL'ST what he meant by definite
*" action is hard to imagine, but
he hammered at the determination
of France and England to achieve
I heir war aims. That would pos
sibly imply restoration of the in
dependence of Poland and Czech
oslovakia; establishment of a solid
peace which wouldn't rest on the
word of the Nazis; the laying of
the foundation for a better inter
national system obviating the
chances for war in every genera
tion and paving the way for dis
armament, improved trade, and
improved living standards.
This is a big order, but England,
convinced of her superior position,
felt free to make blunt demands.
Chamberlain was much more direct,
much less equivocal than Daladier.
He slammed the Nazis, battered at
them with the bludgeon of rhetoric.
"Surrender to wrong-doing would
spell extinction of all hope. Peace
conditions cannot be acceptable
when they begin by condoning ag
gression."
$ $ i|t
TTITLER'S peace bid. the 70-
year-old Prime Minister said,
called for recognition of "his con
quests and his right to do what he
pleases with the conquered."
Hitler spent the entire evening
going over the text of the speech
that seemed to mean guns and
bombs for Europe this winter. The
Germans considered the talk "a
shameless insult to the German
people" and their government's
policy.
Soviet Premier Viacheslav M.
Molotov was expected to dash to
Berlin some time later this month
for consultations over the future
acts of the totalitarian powers. It's a
cinch that Europe's cleverest states
man will find a way to bolster the
declining Nazi slock. Molotov,
Nazis were thinking, will know a
way out.
Meanwhile, Chamberlain will
probably broadcast on a world-wide
hook-up tomorrow, Canada and the
United States will hear the official
statement of Allied policy from the
man who seems to be formulating
most of it.

Meanwhile, Chamberlain will
probably broadcast on a world-wide
hook-up tomorrow, Canada and the
United States will hear the official
statement of Allied policy from the
man who seems to be formulating
most of it.
r pHOUGH Neville Chamberlain
may have left the door to peace
slightly ajar in his speech to the
House of Commons yesterday, the
opening is not wide enough to per
mit Adolf Hitler, fresh from Polish
conquest, to squeeze through with
any face-saving proposals.
Chamberlain's bitter denunciation
of Hitlerism branded the Nazi peace
deal as "impossible." Britain could
not agree to negotiate on Hitler's
terms, he said, unless she was will
ing to "forfeit her honor and aban
don her claim that international dis
putes should be settled by discus
sion and not by force."
* i|t
The whole tone of Chamberlain's
reply—and the cheers that greeted
it-—definitely confirmed the belief
that he's as determined now to smash
Hitler as he was to appease the Ger
mans just a year ago. In violent
contrast to his usual unemotional
manner of speaking, Chamberlain
used biting sarcasm in striking out
at what he termed the "unsupported
word" of Hitler.
"The 40-day-old war can be stop
ped only if the Nazi leaders give
convincing proof of the sincerity of
their desire for peace by definite ac
tion and elTective guarantees," he
asserted.
* # *
IL'ST what he meant by definite
*" action is hard to imagine, but
he hammered at the determination
of France and England to achieve
I heir war aims. That would pos
sibly imply restoration of the in
dependence of Poland and Czech
oslovakia; establishment of a solid
peace which wouldn't rest on the
word of the Nazis; the laying of
the foundation for a better inter
national system obviating the
chances for war in every genera
tion and paving the way for dis
armament, improved trade, and
improved living standards.
This is a big order, but England,
convinced of her superior position,
felt free to make blunt demands.
Chamberlain was much more direct,
much less equivocal than Daladier.
He slammed the Nazis, battered at
them with the bludgeon of rhetoric.
"Surrender to wrong-doing would
spell extinction of all hope. Peace
conditions cannot be acceptable
when they begin by condoning ag
gression."
$ $ i|t
TTITLER'S peace bid. the 70-
year-old Prime Minister said,
called for recognition of "his con
quests and his right to do what he
pleases with the conquered."
Hitler spent the entire evening
going over the text of the speech
that seemed to mean guns and
bombs for Europe this winter. The
Germans considered the talk "a
shameless insult to the German
people" and their government's
policy.
Soviet Premier Viacheslav M.
Molotov was expected to dash to
Berlin some time later this month
for consultations over the future
acts of the totalitarian powers. It's a
cinch that Europe's cleverest states
man will find a way to bolster the
declining Nazi slock. Molotov,
Nazis were thinking, will know a
way out.
