# Cossack Choir Takes Farm By Storm in Vivid Concert
## 
### HARVA SPRAGER 
The Russians invaded the Farm last nightâ€”and no resistance was of
fered. Instead, a tremendous ovation greeted General Platoff's Don Cossack
Choir in the Memorial Hall at the opening of the 1939-40 Concert Series.
A more picturesque group could not be found anywhere, nor a more
colorful one. Nicholas KostrukofT directed the choir and was almost as

interesting in himself as was the<
singers he directed. He seemed to
pull the songs from the men by the
sheer force and the movements of
his shoulders.
It is almost an axiom that a Rus
sian tenor is a good tenor. The Cos
sack Choir is no exception. Every
man in the tenor section was an in
dividual artist in himself. Their
voices were full yet high, and it
seems incredible that they are not
in opera because good opera tenors
are at a premium.
BARITONES SHOW RANGE
The baritone and bass sections
were just as good as the tenors.
The range of the baritones was end
less and they all had very pliable
voices.
The first group of songs were re
ligious and the choir effects were
well executed. The most effective
was "Those Evening Bells." The
tenor soloist, had a rich, tremendous
voice and soft lighting effects aided
the choir in setting the mood of the
song.
SING AVE MARIA'
An arrangement of A. Donizetti's
"Ave Maria" was well suited to the
choir and gave the tenor and bari
tone soloists an opportunity to ex
hibit the range of their voices. "Save
Thy People, O God," a traditional
hymn, had a beautiful bass solo,
and ended the first group of songs.
The second part of the program
was devoted to Mexican, Polish,
New Zealand, and Russian folk songs.
They sounded a bit foreign in all
but the Russian songs in this group.
The fiery Cossack Military Song,
"Glory to PlatofT, the Hero," was

"full of life and typical Russian
rhythms, and perhaps the best liked.
"Black Eyes," the popular Russian
Gypsy Tune was well done but suf
fered from a rather poor arrange
ment.
PRAY IN DUBINUSIIKA
A dagger dance by one of the
troup ended this group. The dance
was very picturesque and exciting,
and the skill of the dancer and his
ability to throw the knives from his
mouth was literally breathtaking.
The only song that really brought
out the pessimistic nature of the
Russians was "Dubinushka," which
is usually sung by Volga River
peasants. The rhythm is very slow
and dragging, and the song builds
up to a tremendous climax as the
singer prays for an inspiration for
his work.
"Sieny," a song usually sung at
weddings was lively and gay. It
was not hard to feel the spirit of
happiness that was the basis of the
song/
SINGERS ENJOY MALANIA
The singers seemed to enjoy the
song "Malania" the best. The tenor
soloist serenades the baritone who
answers him in a very exaggerated
falsetto voice that brought laughter
from the audience.
The concert ended with the na
tional dance of the Cossacks, the
"Kozatchok." The Kozatchok is very
popular and has been seen by ev
eryone. But the balance and skill
exhibited by these dancers kept, the
audience applauding throughout
the- whole dance.
