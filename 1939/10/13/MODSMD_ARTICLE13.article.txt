# SING THESE SATURDAY
## 
### 
HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL!
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Refrain
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring, and float away.
Hail, Stanford, Hail! Â»
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
HAIL ALMA MATER
Hail! Hail! Hail! Alma Mater, Hail!
Stanford, Hail!
Thy fame shall e'er prevail,
Thy sons thy glory shall acclaim,
And ever honor thy fair name,
So, hail! Hail! Hail!
Alma Mater, Hail!
