# Big Game Night Plans Near Completion
## McCurly Will Head Bonfire; Name Band Planned for Dance KEN KOCH 
### 
Plans for a Big Game night off
campus dance will be completed at
the end of this week, Cardinals
Chairman Ken Koch reported last
night at the meeting of that group.
The Bay Meadows clubhouse has
been tentatively set as the locale for
the celebration.
"A big name band will definitely
be signed for the dance," Koch said,
"and we will have the list of avail
able bands this week-end from the
Musicians' Corporation of America."
Plans now call for the orchestra to
be the main feature of the celebra
tion.
As soon as the orchestra and price
(which is expected to be about $5
a couple) are determined, a report

of the dance will be given to Dean
Mary Yost and Dean John Bunn for
their official approval. The deans
have already exprpssed their en
thusiasm for the dance.
While details of Big Game night
were not settled, definite work has
already begun on the pre-Big Game
activities with the appointment of
BiN McCurdy as chairman of the
bonfire. He will be assisted by
Dick Frank and Betty Moses. This
year the bonfire will be held on the
field west of Toyon to avoid the
"Roble hysteria" caused by the old
lake bed site.
' Emphasis will be on quality, not
quantity, this year," stated Koch,
because we have promised that no
building will take place before 6
o'clock ol the morning of the bon
fire." Encina sponsors will be asked
to co-operate in keeping freshman
men away from the site of the fire,
where in the past they have guarded
the empty framework.
The Shell Oil Company, which
gave fireworks last year, has donated
a large display again thi.s year to
accompany the burning of the pyre,
Carl Philips reported.
To handle other Big Game Week
activities, Frank Knowles was ap
pointed chairman of the jolly-up to
be held the day before the game, and
Carl Phillips and Virginia Sterry,
Rally Committee heads, will handle
the parade and rally before the
bonfire.
Mary Kay Horton was named to
head the Red Cross drive, while
high school programs will be under
the direction of Frank Knowles and
Jack Alltuckcr. The welcoming
committee will be Bob Beckham,
chairman, and Betty Moses.
