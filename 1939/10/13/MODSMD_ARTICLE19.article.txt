# Odds Against Cards Soar As Touted Uclans Dig In For Week-end Turf Grind
## Coach Horrell's 'Brown Bombers,' Kenny Washington, Robinson, Cause Betting to Favor Bruin Team 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
A( the rate tlie odds are growing against our Indians' winning tomor
row's gridiron ioust with U.C.L.A. in the Stadium at 2::>0 o'clock, it stands
to reason tliat Kenny Washington and Jackie Robinson have had their
share to do with it.
Betting which established the Bruin invaders 2-to-l favorites early in

ine wcck nas oeen upped lo
I—and all because of Coach Babe
Horrell's two ebony ball packers.
Already this week, Tiny Thorn
hill's men have met the "Bruin"
offense and two near replicas of the
Negro aces, and they came out of
the skirmish not quite so sure that,
they hadn't run up across the

"General" and his "aide." That
right there was reason enough for
the increase in odds.
But the best reason for all the
money on the Southerners is Wash
ington and Robinson themselves,
who are probably three times better
qualified to handle Bruin left and
right half positions than Stanford's
fourth stringers.
Against this double triple-threat
combination — which, by the way,
may not open the game as was Hor
rell's strategy in the Washington
Husky clash last, week—Tiny will
have only Norm Standlee, the near
est thing in a Stanford uniform to
look like a triple threater, to carry
our Indians' offensive attack. "The
Chief" was all the Cardinals' offen
sive last week at Portland against
Oregon. Without a no gain charged
against him in 19 cracks at the line,
Standlee rolled up 71 yards from
scrimmage.
Just how well the Indians' suc
cessor to Ernie Nevers' and Bobby
Grayson's jersey No. 22 will make
out against the beefy U.C.L.A. line
is problematical. He came back
from the Webfoot encounter with a
banged-up shoulder, but he should
be in fine fettle to take over his
share of the ball-toting duties to
morrow.
Left half, the key post in the War
ner system, will find last week's
third stringer filling the post. Moon
Mullin has the starting assignment
mainly because he is the best com
bination of a passer and running
threat Tiny can scrape up among all
his backs. However, the way Art j
Rasmussen handled Washington's j
job against the varsity this week may I
land him an opportunity to play left ;
half.
Hamp Pool will be making his
first quarterback start since Tiny I
shuffled the line-up after the Ore- 1
gon defeat. His job will he to speed j
tip the backfield so that blocking in
front of Standlee and Mullin will
be more effective than it was in the j
first two games.
The Indian line will have Andy j
Stojkovich and Stan Graff at the ■
flanks, Stan Andersen and Corky j
Donahue at the tackles, John Ker
man and Dave Patterson at the
guards, and Jim Verdieck at center. I
BRUIN LINEMEN
The Bruin line, averaging near the j
200-pound mark, according to Los
Angeles scales, will have Strode and
Macpherson at end, Hill and Zaru
bica at tackle, Sommers and Fraw
]ey at guard, and Matheson at cen
ter. Matthews or Kvitky will be at j
quarter, Fenenbock or Washington I
sit left half, Gilmore or Robinson at <
right half, and Overlin or Cantor at
full.
What has the experts guessing
most of the time during the game :
when the Bruins have control of the
ball is who has the ball. When the ;
play starts, "General Kenny" gets j
the ball but, after he gets through j
spinning and faking to any of two '
different men, sometimes the offi- |
cials—let alone the opposing team — j
don't even know.
HUSKIES WERE STYMIED
The Huskies were so buffaloed j
last week that most of the time they
had tackled ONE of the slippery |
backs but it usually turned out to j
be the wrong man.
"He went that way" may be what !
Bruin rooters will yell if Stanford's I
line and backs find themselves equal- j
Jy fooled by the Bruin trickery.
Husky Hunt, Card scout, with his |
diagrams of the fundamental Bruin J
plays, has given the Indians a good j
idea as to what they can expect run, j
thrown, or kicked at them tomorrow, j
Stanford doesn't believe that j
practices are any criterion anyway. |
