# Odds Against Cards Soar As Touted Uclans Dig In For Week-end Turf Grind
## Coach Horrell's 'Brown Bombers,' Kenny Washington, Robinson, Cause Betting to Favor Bruin Team 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
A( the rate tlie odds are growing against our Indians' winning tomor
row's gridiron ioust with U.C.L.A. in the Stadium at 2::>0 o'clock, it stands
to reason tliat Kenny Washington and Jackie Robinson have had their
share to do with it.
Betting which established the Bruin invaders 2-to-l favorites early in

ine wcck nas oeen upped lo
I—and all because of Coach Babe
Horrell's two ebony ball packers.
Already this week, Tiny Thorn
hill's men have met the "Bruin"
offense and two near replicas of the
Negro aces, and they came out of
the skirmish not quite so sure that,
they hadn't run up across the

"General" and his "aide." That
right there was reason enough for
the increase in odds.
But the best reason for all the
money on the Southerners is Wash
ington and Robinson themselves,
who are probably three times better
qualified to handle Bruin left and
right half positions than Stanford's
fourth stringers.
Against this double triple-threat
combination — which, by the way,
may not open the game as was Hor
rell's strategy in the Washington
Husky clash last, week—Tiny will
have only Norm Standlee, the near
est thing in a Stanford uniform to
look like a triple threater, to carry
our Indians' offensive attack. "The
Chief" was all the Cardinals' offen
sive last week at Portland against
Oregon. Without a no gain charged
against him in 19 cracks at the line,
Standlee rolled up 71 yards from
scrimmage.
Just how well the Indians' suc
cessor to Ernie Nevers' and Bobby
Grayson's jersey No. 22 will make
out against the beefy U.C.L.A. line
is problematical. He came back
from the Webfoot encounter with a
banged-up shoulder, but he should
be in fine fettle to take over his
share of the ball-toting duties to
morrow.
Left half, the key post in the War
ner system, will find last week's
third stringer filling the post. Moon
Mullin has the starting assignment
mainly because he is the best com
bination of a passer and running
threat Tiny can scrape up among all
