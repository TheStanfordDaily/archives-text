# Once Famed 'Stanford Inn,' Barracks to Be Demolished
## 
### CHARLES BULL 
Senility has finally caught up to a building which has been a part of
Stanford history for the past 40 years. The old R.O.T.C. barracks east of the
Encina Gym next week will be nothing but a pile of junk.
This buildng, once the famed Stanford Inn, has twice during its event
ful history been moved to escape being torn down. To the modern Farm
generation, the Stanford Inn is only a legend, known to some from the

tales of parents or older friends, but
to Stanfordites from the classes of
'00 to '22. <he Stanford Inn i.s an un
forgettable Farm institution.
$1,000 JUNK VALUE
The building which is now being
wrecked for its $1,000 junk value
has had a varied and poignant his
tory.
The Inn, as it was commonly
known, was first erected across from
the east side of the Quad between
what is now the Cubberly Building
and the Lbrary. The pressing need
for the Inn's construction was that
Encina Dining Hall — now Encina
Lobby—after numerous trials had
finally been discontinued, leaving
the Rough with no place to eat reg
ularly this side of Palo Alto. In ad
dition to serving the dispossessed
Encina men, the Inn was open to
the public.
TOUR STARTED IN 1917
In January 1917 the Inn started its
tour which will end next week in
the junk heap. Plans for the present
Library necessitated the removal of
the Inn, so rather than see it rele
gated to oblivion, authorization was
given to jack it up on wheels and
move it out of the way.
The Inn was advertised that day in
the Daily Palo Alto—predecessor of
the Stanford Daily—as "the only
traveling inn in captivity."
Then on June 30, 1922, Stanford
saw the Inn cease as an eating es
tablishment.
But it was not allowed to be torn
down.
It was at this time that the Inn
made the longest journey of its life,
down to its present location to be
come the R.O.T.C. headquarters and
later the barracks for U.S. Army en

listed men on the campus.
The Inn was operated by many
different people during its history.
For a period it was run as a student
co-operative enterprise with meals
for members priced at $3.75 per
week.
But by far the most famous inn
keeper and now legendary campus
character was Frank Tagawa, com
monly called by all, "The Count."
He and his wife, Mary, ran the inn
for amny eventful years until its
end in 1922.
According to Charles K. Field,
'95, such later famous people as Al
mon E. Roth, present head of the
San Francisco Employers Associa
tion, hashed at the inn. Mr. Field
also stated that ex-President Her
bert Hoover didn't need to hash
since he had a very profitable laun
dry agency.

down to its present location to be
come the R.O.T.C. headquarters and
later the barracks for U.S. Army en

listed men on the campus.
The Inn was operated by many
different people during its history.
For a period it was run as a student
co-operative enterprise with meals
for members priced at $3.75 per
week.
But by far the most famous inn
keeper and now legendary campus
character was Frank Tagawa, com
monly called by all, "The Count."
He and his wife, Mary, ran the inn
for amny eventful years until its
end in 1922.
According to Charles K. Field,
'95, such later famous people as Al
mon E. Roth, present head of the
San Francisco Employers Associa
tion, hashed at the inn. Mr. Field
also stated that ex-President Her
bert Hoover didn't need to hash
since he had a very profitable laun
dry agency.
Senility has finally caught up to a building which has been a part of
Stanford history for the past 40 years. The old R.O.T.C. barracks east of the
Encina Gym next week will be nothing but a pile of junk.
This buildng, once the famed Stanford Inn, has twice during its event
ful history been moved to escape being torn down. To the modern Farm
generation, the Stanford Inn is only a legend, known to some from the

tales of parents or older friends, but
to Stanfordites from the classes of
'00 to '22. <he Stanford Inn i.s an un
forgettable Farm institution.
$1,000 JUNK VALUE
The building which is now being
wrecked for its $1,000 junk value
has had a varied and poignant his
tory.
The Inn, as it was commonly
known, was first erected across from
the east side of the Quad between
what is now the Cubberly Building
and the Lbrary. The pressing need
for the Inn's construction was that
Encina Dining Hall — now Encina
Lobby—after numerous trials had
finally been discontinued, leaving
the Rough with no place to eat reg
ularly this side of Palo Alto. In ad
dition to serving the dispossessed
Encina men, the Inn was open to
the public.
TOUR STARTED IN 1917
In January 1917 the Inn started its
tour which will end next week in
the junk heap. Plans for the present
Library necessitated the removal of
the Inn, so rather than see it rele
gated to oblivion, authorization was
given to jack it up on wheels and
move it out of the way.
The Inn was advertised that day in
the Daily Palo Alto—predecessor of
the Stanford Daily—as "the only
traveling inn in captivity."
Then on June 30, 1922, Stanford
saw the Inn cease as an eating es
tablishment.
But it was not allowed to be torn
down.
It was at this time that the Inn
made the longest journey of its life,
down to its present location to be
come the R.O.T.C. headquarters and
later the barracks for U.S. Army en

listed men on the campus.
