# Transfer to Play 'Great Divide' Lead
## 
### 
Betty Howe, junior transfer from
j Mills, will make her debut in Stan
| ford productions next Friday night
j when she will play Ruth Jordan in
"The Great Divide."
The part of Ruth is considered a
j difficult one because it - calls for an
abrupt transition from a young and
j eager girl into a bitter woman who
I hates the man to whom she is mar
j ried. The part was originally cre
| ated by Margaret Anglin.
Sylvia Onesti has the role of Polly
j Jordan, Ruth's sister-in-law. Polly
I is a crisply cynical woman, whose
j lines do much to add humor to the
1 play.
