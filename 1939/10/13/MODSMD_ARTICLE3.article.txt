## chamberlain . . . . . Hitler Claims German War Machine Ready ‘To Fight in Earnest’ 
### United Press 
Germany announced Thursday
night "the war is now on in earn
est," with the Nazi war machine
ready to unleash its most terrific
blows, as result of Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain's sharp rejec
tion of Adolf Hitler's final terms for
peace.
Chamberlain, speaking before the
House of Commons in London
Thursday afternoon, rejected Hitler's
terms as "impossible" and said the
Allies are determined ot fight "with
the utmost of our strength" until Hit
lerism is smashed unless Hitler
should give convincing proof by acts
instead of words that he will agree
to a peace recognizing the honor
and freedom of all nations.
"It is for Germany to make her
choice," said Chamberlain.
GERMANY ACTS
Germany did —and quickly. Hitler
and his closest advisers spent the
evening in Berlin going over Cham
berlain's speech. They were angry
at the curtness of the British Prime
Minister's reply.
The Reich threatened immediate
consultation with Soviet Russia and
Italy as to the "necessary measures"
which must be taken now.
Moscow and Rome showed no in
clination to go to war because Hit
ler has been rebuffed.
The manner in which Germany
will start the war "in earnest" was
not described officially in Berlin but
it was to be assumed Field Marshal
Hermann W. Goering's air force
would strike the first major blows—
probably against the Birtish fleet
and perhaps against vital British
and French industrial centers.
HITLER MUST FIGHT
The general impressoin among
neutral observers was that, no mat
ter how ardently Hitler wants
peace now that he has conquered
Poland, there seems to be no face
saving way out for him after say
ing in his speech to the Reichstag
last Friday that his terms —the ones
Chamberlain, and French Premier
Edouard Daladier befoi'e him, re
jected—were his final ones.
The French high command be
lieved the stage might be being set
now for a full-force aNzi offensive
on the western front. Thursday's
official announcement of the French
War Office said there was "front line
fighting" along the 90-mile front be
tween the Rhine and the Moselle
Rivers in which the Germans ap
peared to be either trying to re
cover lost, ground for a major of
fensive or to prevent an Allied at
tack. It was the first announcement
of any fighting thus far in the war
of more than scattered patrol and
strategical operations.

The United tSates Thursday threw

rights in the Gulf of Finland.

Germany announced Thursday
night "the war is now on in earn
est," with the Nazi war machine
ready to unleash its most terrific
blows, as result of Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain's sharp rejec
tion of Adolf Hitler's final terms for
peace.
Chamberlain, speaking before the
House of Commons in London
Thursday afternoon, rejected Hitler's
terms as "impossible" and said the
Allies are determined ot fight "with
the utmost of our strength" until Hit
lerism is smashed unless Hitler
should give convincing proof by acts
instead of words that he will agree
to a peace recognizing the honor
and freedom of all nations.
"It is for Germany to make her
choice," said Chamberlain.
GERMANY ACTS
Germany did —and quickly. Hitler
and his closest advisers spent the
evening in Berlin going over Cham
berlain's speech. They were angry
at the curtness of the British Prime
Minister's reply.
The Reich threatened immediate
consultation with Soviet Russia and
Italy as to the "necessary measures"
which must be taken now.
Moscow and Rome showed no in
clination to go to war because Hit
ler has been rebuffed.
The manner in which Germany
will start the war "in earnest" was
not described officially in Berlin but
it was to be assumed Field Marshal
Hermann W. Goering's air force
would strike the first major blows—
probably against the Birtish fleet
and perhaps against vital British
and French industrial centers.
HITLER MUST FIGHT
The general impressoin among
neutral observers was that, no mat
ter how ardently Hitler wants
peace now that he has conquered
Poland, there seems to be no face
saving way out for him after say
ing in his speech to the Reichstag
last Friday that his terms —the ones
Chamberlain, and French Premier
Edouard Daladier befoi'e him, re
jected—were his final ones.
The French high command be
lieved the stage might be being set
now for a full-force aNzi offensive
on the western front. Thursday's
official announcement of the French
War Office said there was "front line
fighting" along the 90-mile front be

Rivers in which the Germans ap
peared to be either trying to re
cover lost, ground for a major of
fensive or to prevent an Allied at

of any fighting thus far in the war
of more than scattered patrol and
strategical operations.
