HELSINGFORS, Oct. 12 (UP).â€”
The government tonight ordered all
Finnish ships out of the Gulf of
Finland to prevent them from being
bottled up in any Soviet naval block
ade and spread 300,000 troops along
the eastern border where they faced
Russian soldiers, tanks and artillery.
Mines were planted along the
frontier to blow up strategic rail
road bridges, tunnels and highways
in event of any Russian invasion
should the Finnish-Soviet talks un
der way in Moscow break down.
The government decided to close
all ports along the Gulf of Finland,
reaching 325 miles eastward to Len
ingrad, as a precaution against any
possible Soviet blockade at the
mouth of the gulf.
All Finnish ships were ordered to
go to Abo (Turks), 110 miles east
of Helsingfors around the point of
liango and just east of the Aaland
Islands, or other ports on the Gulf

of Bothnia between Finland and
Sweden.
Tens of thousands of civilians were
in flight from Helsingfors and other
cities, by train, boat and plane,
while the government took cheer
from disclosure that the United
States Ambassador in Moscow had
intervened with the Soviet govern
ment on Finland's behalf.
