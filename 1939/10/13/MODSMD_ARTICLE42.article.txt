# C.I.O Ignores Roosevelt Plea
## Lewis Criticizes U.S. Labor Department 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 13 (UP).â€”
The Congress of Industrial Organi
zations sidetracked President Roo
sevelt's newest plea for labor peace
at its annual convention here today.
In the same session the organiza
tion headed by John L. Lewis ad
ministered a verbal spanking to one
of the President's executive depart
ments in a severe criticism of the ad
ministration of the Labor Depart
ment.
LEWIS TO HANDLE PEACE
Without referring directly to the
President s telegram asking resump
tion of A.F.L.-C.1.0. peace negotia
tions, the convention unanimously
adopted a resolutions committee rec
ommendation that the decision as to
any future negotiations for labor
peace be left in the hands of Lewis
and Vice-Presidents Phil Murray
and Sidney Hillman, the three-man
C.1.0. committee in previous nego
tiations.
And with that, the C.1.0., so far as
the delegates assembled here were
concerned, apparently closed the
book on the President's new move
to bring the warring factions to
gether.
F.D. REFUSES TO COMMENT
There was no comment from any
executive on the resolution or the
proposal.
There was lots of comment, how
ever, from the C.1.0. leaders on the
present status of the Federal De
partment of Labor after the reso
lutions committee called on the de
partment "to get back on the track."
The Labor Department, it charged,
had strayed far from its original pur
pose of benefitting the working man,
improving his welfare and advancing
his opportunities for employment.
