### JERRY MAYER 
IT CAN HAPPEN
HERE—WE HOPE
Before you toss Stanford's chances
against U.C.L.A. tomorrow over
board, it might be a pretty fair idea
to review a couple of Indian-Bruin
games of recent years.
For instance, look at the 1936
game, when Stanford quietly slip
ped into the Los Angeles Coliseum
on the short end of 3-1 odds—and
then not so quietly whacked the
daylights out of the Bruins by a 19-7
score.
"Not a chance," said the Los An
geles papers of Stanford's possi
bilities of victory that day, "it won't
even be close." They were right, it
wasn't close.
Then two >ears ago, when Ken
ny Washington was a sophomore,
the Bruins invaded the Farm un
der circumstances very similar to
tomorrow's conflict. The Uclans
were undefeated, Stanford was the
decided underdog in the betting
odds, and several thousand Bruin
rooters made an enthusiastic exo
dus to see their team grab a
glorious victory.
That time the score was 12-7 and
Stanford wasn't even pressed.
With just a couple of minutes
left in the game, the Cards were
leading 12-0 and were hitting for
another touchdown when a pass
backfired, some Bruin intercept
ing the aerial and romping over

90 yards for a touchdown. In
reality this game was no closer
than the '3(> slaughter.
History is supposed to repeat it
self. Perhaps the Indians, with the
odds greater than ever against
them, can turn the trick again de
spite this being undoubtedly the
best U.C.L.A. outfit of all time.
On the other hand I refuse to pick
the Bruins.
LUCKY LOUIE
HERE AGAIN
Lucky Louie crept stealthily into
the Daily Shack yesterday and grin
ned sheepishly at me.
"Get out," I growled, "you got me
in enough trouble last week."
"Besides," I shouted, "you picked
Stanford to beat Oregon and it
didn't."
"Oat's alright," replied oP L.L.
with a knowing look in his eye,
"I got U.C.L.A. pegged dis week, so
Stanford can't lose."
I couldn't l-esist the possibility that
he was right, so L.L. gets his space
again this week. At that he only
missed two and got one lie out of
last week's nine predictions for an
average of .722.

U.C.L.A. 3. Stanford 0
