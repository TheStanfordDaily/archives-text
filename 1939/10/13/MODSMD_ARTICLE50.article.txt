The same high school that sent
Stanford's "Blazin' Ben" Eastman a
few track seasons back is at work
for the farm again.
Another blazer, "Blazin' Blair"
Hyde, half and quarter miler de
luxe, more late of San Mateo Jun
ior College, has sent his check pay
able to Stanford University and is
enrolled as a junior transfer.
Like "Big Ben," Blair comes from
Burlingame High School, some 14
miles north on El Camino Real.
Presently he holds the world's
junior college half-mile record of
1:54.6 and has torn off a 440 well
under the :50 mark.
Potentially he is rated as good as
they come. He is even of the same
stature as Eastman, although not so
tall. He is not so modest that our
attempted interview with him might
be called a flop. In fact, it might
be called many things.
To the question, "Where were you

born?" he claimed that he was too
young to remember.
He evidently misunderstood the
inquiry about his idol, as we meant
it in a track way. At that, his in
spiration — Hedy Lamarr — might
qualify because of her good form
and nice pair of legs—track re
quirements.
The only record he plans on
breaking is the "Beer Barrel Polka."
In case you haven't already
guessed, "Blazing Blair" is the
brother of Gordy Hyde, who ran
| the quarter a couple years ago for
I the local institution.
But Blair already has a big head
j start on his brother.
