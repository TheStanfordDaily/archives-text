# Circle S Plans Boxing Tourney
## 
### 
At the first meeting of the quar
ter at which new members were
present, the Stanford Circle S So
ciety laid plans for a "bigger and
better" novice boxing tournament.
The initial meet was made at lunch
at the Beta house, with Dick
Hoover presiding.
The aim of the society this quar
ter, stated Hoover, is to go direct to
the students with tickets for the box
ing tournament. Every fraternity,
sorority, and living group will be
asked to aid in the drive, it was
pointed out. The funds obtained
will go toward the purchase of new
ropes for the boxing ring and new
show cases for the Stanford trophy
room.
The tournament this year will be
held on Nov. IG, Hoover said. Grad
uate Manager A1 Masters and Coach
Harry Maloney were guests this
noon, and each gave short pep talks
to put the members in the frame of
mind to get behind the drive, it
was stated.
