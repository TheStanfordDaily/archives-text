LOS ANGELES. Oct. 12 (UP). —
The U.C.L.A. Bruins' first string will
see little action against Stanford

nothing but limber up this week
while the second and third strings
held scrimmage. In the heaviest
workout tonight, Horrell sent the
first string in after runing 10 plays
and concentrated on improving
substitutes' offense.
