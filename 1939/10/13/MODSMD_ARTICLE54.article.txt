# Powerful Frosh Team to Meet Troy in Los Angeles
## Papooses' Win Streak Threatened Shipkey to Employ Psychology Against 'Best Ever' Team 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Psychology play.s an important
part in modern football and Fresh
man Coach Harry Shipkey is plan
ning to apply some of this class
room stuff when his team meets
U.S.C.'s rough and tough frosh ball
club tomorrow afternoon in Los An
geles.
Shipkey believes that players per
forming in their home town and
trying to impress the home-town
folks are apt to be red hot. For that
reason there may be a couple ol
new faces in the Papooses' starting
lineup lesting out their coach's
theory,
At left end Dill Symes may be
given the call over Jack Tellefsen
because (he former is a South Pasa
dena boy and will be playing near
bis old stamping grounds. Roger
Laverty, who hails from Beverly
Hills, may get the call at left guard
for the same reason.
CO-CAPTAINS CHOSEN
And in choosing his captains for
the game, Shipkey was again think
ing of the location of the game and
the effect it could have. He has
picked A1 Cole as captain and Bill
Mannon as line captain—both these
stars wont to Los Angeles High.
Leaving psychology and getting
down lo concrete facts: the Card
yearlings can beat that "best in
years" Trojan frosh outfit, if they can
stop the Trojan power plays off
tackle.
Offensively the two teams are
fairly evenly matched, and the pay
off may come to the team with the
sturdiest line on defense. The Tro
babes boast a backfield averaging
I'jO and their key plays take advan
tage of this weight, directing most of
the offensive thrusts inside or out
side of tackle.
TACKLES ARK STRONG
Bruno Eundueci, George Robin
son. and Bob Millington are three
tackles capable of stopping any sort
of power plays. I hey are all around
L'OO pounds and plenty rugged.
With guards Ed McCain at 183,
Laverty at 18fc>, and Dick Palmer at
195, Shipkey seems to have plenty
of weight to stop anything thrown
down tiie middle. Red Taylor and
Bill Mannon, each close to the 200-
mark, as line backers only add more
evidence to this argument.
For offense the Cards have a num
ber of tricks up their sleeve. For
power there are Milt Vucinieh on
his driiter plays toward either side
of the line and Red Taylor with
his crunching quarterback sneaks
through center.
AKRIAL ATTACK PLANNED
'Ihen there are the pitching arms
of both Vucinieh and little A1 Cole,
who have a couple of sticky-fingered
receivers in Symes and particularly
Ed Stamm, the other end.
1!< verses to Eric Armstrong and
end sweeps by Cole will utilize the
spe* d and deception talents of these
two boys. Either of the triple threat
men, Cole or Vucinieh, can handle
the punting assignments, while to
versatile A1 goes the job of running
back opponents' punts.
'Ihat about rounds out ihe duties
of the first string backfield but there
is another quartet of boys right be
hind these ready and capable to take
their places. Don Selby, Red Rob
inson. Bob Greening, and Bill Han
lon all have plenty of talent and ex
perience to their credit.
After a chalk talk and signal prac
tice on the plays that they plan to
use against U.S.C.'s floating line, the
team ol members will entrain at

■ S p.m. for (he south.
They have started out in cham
| pionship form so far this year, run
i ning up 47 points (o their Iwo oppo
j nents' 0. And if they are to be the
I unbeaten team that last year's frosh
club was, they will have to play
their best game tomorrow. Tomor
j row's game is their crucial test and
i the best of luck to them 400 miles
i from the Farm.
