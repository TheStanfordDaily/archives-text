# Booters to Meet Tough San Mateo Squad Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Indian soccer squad will open tomorrow's Farm sports schedule at
!() o'clock when thev take on the San Mateo Junior College eleven.
Fresh from a 4-0 triumph over Menlo Junior College, the Cards will
be facing tougher competition when they try for their second victory
of the season on their home field.

Coach Harry Maloney was fairly
well satisfied with hi.s team's show
ing against Menlo. They controlled
the ball most of the time, though it
took them quite a while to get a
scoring combination clicking. In
view of the fact that it was their
1 first game, however, the few mis
takes that were made can be ex
cused.
TEAM ESCAPES INJURY
The Farm booters came out of the
opening contest in good physical
condition. No serious injuries were
reported. With the squad intact,
Maloney will probably start the
same eleven tomorrow that faced
Menlo.
This team would have Tito Sanz-
should be in shape to play if he is
ilton at right back, Cam Pierce at
left back, Wilson Clark at right half,
Bill Edwards at center half, Ken
i Cuthbertson at left half. Bill Arra
smith at outside right, George Dole
at inside right, Francis Morgan at
center forward, Al Pellas at inside
left, and Chris Sontum at outside
left.
The entire squad looked very
good against Menlo. Ken Cuthbert
son and Bill Edwards turned in es
j pecially fine games. Edwards, cen
! ter half, was playing opposite Men
lo's principal offensive threat, a
tricky colored boy, and kept him
covered most of the game.
S.M.J.C. WILL BE STRONG
The San Mateo eleven is expected
to furnish more competition than
the inexperienced Menlo team could.
Several of the Menlo players had
never played soccer before practice
started this fall.
Lee Champion, second-string for
ward, was suffering from a cold
Wednesday, and was unable to see
action the opening game, but he
Phi Kaps hit touchdown territory
needed tomorrow.
Howard Hughes, sportsman-flier,
has requested permission of the
federal government to make a flight
from the United States to Paris at a
high altitude.
