# Card Polomen Start Serimmages
## 
### 
Card polomen thundered through
their first inter-team scrimmage
Wednesday, after spending weeks in
stick and ball practice. Wednesday's
workout marked the first of a se
ries of inter-squad scrimmages that
will lead to selection of the varsity
outfit.
The four active teams are graded
in order of skill, with the Reds top
ping the list. They'll battle the
Whites in the next inter-team
struggle this afternoon.
The Card horsemen have been
polishing new plays and formations
under the direction of Major Smith,
a newcomer to the coaching stuff.
Five returning veterans —Stan Glik
barg, Len Weisenberg, George Reid,
Dick Daley, Dick La Prade — are
slated for top posts on the pony
aggregation.
Current competition centers
around the traveling squad of five
that will be picked for the trek to
Arizona in the near future. Elim
inations, Major Smith said, will

continue during ensuing scrimmage
sessions until near-game-time.
