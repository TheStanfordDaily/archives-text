## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 13 (UP).â€”The
racing career of C S. Howard's Sor
teado ended today when the 840.000
Argentine colt snapped a ligament in
his right foreleg little more than two
weeks after running to a new North
American track record for a mile and
a half.
The accident came only two weeks
after Sorteado had run to the new
mark of 2-5 in the Manhattan
Handicap at Belmont Park in one
of the outstanding distance perform
ances of the year .
London's 145 hospitals have a daily
expenditure of $68,300; approximate
ly one-half of this amount is netted
from patients' payments and invest
ments.
