AND the World War continued from 1914
until 1949.
There was a long period of truce between
1918 and 1939, but it was destined from the
beginning to be of a temporary nature. Know
ing that it could not enslave the German people,
Britain imposed on them the strictest terms it
dared in the Treaty of Versailles—terms harsh
enough to stir up fresh hatred against England,
but not harsh enough to render the Reich too
weak to go back to war.
At first defeated Germany foundered hope
lessly, but early in the second decade of the
truce she found her leader in an untrained dem
agogue, with an uncanny sense of popular psy
chology, whose name was Adolf Hitler.
Two fortunate circumstances aided the Ger
mans in recommencing their struggle to domi
nate Europe: Wily Soviet Russia, anxious to
crush western capitalism and at the same time
fearful of an over-powerful Reich extending to
her western frontier through Poland, threw her
support in on the side of Dictator Hitler. The
government of the British Empire, completely
dominated by conservative business interests,
had as its leader the aging, incompetent Neville
Chamberlain.
The history of the latter part of the war is
much like that of the early years. With a super
efficient military force and a civilian population
willing to stand great privations, Germany took
the offensive and crushed the Allied forces in
battle after battle.
In 1943 France and England sent an emer
gency call for aid to the United States, but the
Americans, remembering how much they had
lost in the first part of the war, refused to enter
the conflict. In desperation the British navy
began sinking ships of the United States mer
chant marine and trying to lay the blame on
German submarines.
However, America recognized the ruse, and
would not go to war, even when several hun
dred of her citizens were killed. The Allies fu
tilely continued to battle the Nazi war machine,
but within a year they were forced to sue for
peace.
In 1951, when Germany and Soviet Russia
were dividing up the colonies that once formed
the British Empire, the diplomats could not come
to an agreement on the question of who was to
control the Suez Canal. Five conferences were
held to try to mediate the matter, but each one
failed. And finally Berlin and Moscow went to
war.
Everyone knows how feebly these war-weak
ened nations tried to batter down each other's
resistance. And how, when they both were
reduced to exhaustion, the President of the
United States sent to all the nations of Europe
messages demanding that they assemble at the
great Congress of Stockholm in 1954.
There it was that the great American execu
tive laid the plan for the present Federation of
European States, presenting the principles of
government by social democracy which were
accepted by every nation on the Continent.
And there it was that the world at last found
peace.

lessly, but early in the second decade of the
truce she found her leader in an untrained dem
agogue, with an uncanny sense of popular psy
chology, whose name was Adolf Hitler.
Two fortunate circumstances aided the Ger
mans in recommencing their struggle to domi
nate Europe: Wily Soviet Russia, anxious to
crush western capitalism and at the same time
fearful of an over-powerful Reich extending to
her western frontier through Poland, threw her
support in on the side of Dictator Hitler. The
government of the British Empire, completely
dominated by conservative business interests,
had as its leader the aging, incompetent Neville
Chamberlain.
The history of the latter part of the war is
much like that of the early years. With a super
efficient military force and a civilian population
willing to stand great privations, Germany took
the offensive and crushed the Allied forces in
battle after battle.
In 1943 France and England sent an emer
gency call for aid to the United States, but the
Americans, remembering how much they had
lost in the first part of the war, refused to enter
the conflict. In desperation the British navy
began sinking ships of the United States mer
chant marine and trying to lay the blame on
German submarines.
However, America recognized the ruse, and
would not go to war, even when several hun
dred of her citizens were killed. The Allies fu
tilely continued to battle the Nazi war machine,
but within a year they were forced to sue for
peace.
In 1951, when Germany and Soviet Russia
were dividing up the colonies that once formed
the British Empire, the diplomats could not come
to an agreement on the question of who was to
control the Suez Canal. Five conferences were
held to try to mediate the matter, but each one
failed. And finally Berlin and Moscow went to
war.
Everyone knows how feebly these war-weak
ened nations tried to batter down each other's
resistance. And how, when they both were
reduced to exhaustion, the President of the
United States sent to all the nations of Europe
messages demanding that they assemble at the
great Congress of Stockholm in 1954.
There it was that the great American execu
tive laid the plan for the present Federation of
European States, presenting the principles of
government by social democracy which were
accepted by every nation on the Continent.
And there it was that the world at last found
peace.
AND the World War continued from 1914
until 1949.
There was a long period of truce between
1918 and 1939, but it was destined from the
beginning to be of a temporary nature. Know
ing that it could not enslave the German people,
Britain imposed on them the strictest terms it
dared in the Treaty of Versailles—terms harsh
enough to stir up fresh hatred against England,
but not harsh enough to render the Reich too
weak to go back to war.
At first defeated Germany foundered hope
lessly, but early in the second decade of the
truce she found her leader in an untrained dem
agogue, with an uncanny sense of popular psy
chology, whose name was Adolf Hitler.
