# A 						Song for Stanford
## 
### 
IT was six o'clock last evening on the Row.
Sitting on the sleps of one of the fraternity
houses a visiting U.C.L.A. student was talking
to a Stanford man.
"Yes, you fellows have a pretty fine spirit up
here. The campus certainly is friendly and in
formal and all that. But your rooting section!
My God, man, we can't even hear it on our side
of the field. I've been coming north to the
games for a great many years now, and never
once have I heard the words to your hymn."
"Well, yeah . . was all the Stanford man
could answer.
Everyone knows the words to "Come Join the
Band" and "Sons of the Stanford Red," but the
hymn sung at the end of the game always is a
dismal failure. Today The Daily carries on its
front page the words to "Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
and also those of "Hail Alma Mater," which
henceforth will be sung at the half.
Both of them sound excellent when they are
well sung.
Is it too much to ask Stanford undergraduates
to learn the words a few years before they sing
them at their alumni reunions?
