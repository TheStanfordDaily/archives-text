# One at a Time

### 
STANFORD will not play a more important
game all season than the one with U.C.L.A.
tomorrow.
That statement not only sounds sententious;
it is sententious. Look at the facts:
Washington, Washington State, and Stanford
have been defeated in conference games this

year, while California, in spite of not having
played a conference game to date, has been
defeated twice. U.S.C. has been tied. That
leaves but Oregon State and U.C.L.A. unde
feated at even this early date.
Any way you look at it, that leaves U.C.L.A.,
Oregon State, and U.S.C. on top of the list. Ore
gon State to us on the Farm is a thing of the
past. The other two are very much with us.
So much with us that Stanford's football team
has to win that game tomorrow. It has to —if it
is going to make any difference whether it wins
any more games this season.
It is obvious that Stanford cannot lose again
and win the Coast Conference title. It is more
than possible that, should they win from here in,
they will end up on top. By beating U.C.L.A.
tomorrow, they will be taking two jumps toward
the title. (1) They will be winning, going up
the ladder. (2) They will be sending one of the
leaders down one rung.
Let's leave it at that. Let's not go on to the
other games, the U.S.C. and Cal games. Let's
take them one at a time.
And hope they win this first one.—D. J.
