lilt: LIKES OF FATHER COUGIILIN
4 iNE oi today's Campus Opinioners attacks our de-
fensc of Father Coughlin's right to disgust the air
waves. He agrees that the unholy Reverend is at best
a ham actor armed with powerful a sancti
monious disregard for truth, and a phony Canadian
accent. And (his morning's champion of American
liberties lauds the muzzling of Coughlin as a defense
of democracy. Eut the democracy which he defends
will necessarily be a democracy without free speech.
Who knows? Maybe it even will be a democracy with
out Campus Opinion.
Mr. Left wants '"the likes of Father Coughlin" si
lenced. But if the powerful are left to decide who is
"the likes," there will be a very unnatural unanimity
of opinion. We will all agree with the powerful. Or
else we won't say anything at all.
But Campus Opinioner misses the main tenet of
our comment on Radio Corporation's muzzling act: the
issue is less one of civil liberties and more one of
economic secux-ity. Admittedly it is rather difficult to
feel security of any kind when some rabble-rousing
demagogue is jamming emotion-coated political ca
thartics down your throat. But people have done it.
They have done it when they were prosperous, when
they were not afraid that something subversive was
going to wrench their fortunes from them.

IT IS only when I am losing at bridge—a circum
stance nearly as frequent as my playing bridge—
that I begin to be annoyed by the chap over my shoul
der who thinks his mother's womb was Ely Culbert
son's head. At such times, however, with the cards or
my ignorance impoverishing my wallet—or worse yet,
my pride—l will probably become peeved to no small
extent. And I will feel strongly inclined to support
any parlor-Fascist effort to shut the intruder up.
Our economic struggles are somewhat more intense
than most bridge games. The police use guns instead
of flower pots. But the added violence only exagger
ates bridge-game discourtesy into leftist-rightist strug
gles and the verbal distemper of Father Coughlin.
We think that we can legislate free speech. But
economic and political rumblings prove us wrong. We
imagine that we must protect our free speech by cen
soring the demagogue. Then, we feel, we have suc
cessfully defended democracy. But the same funda
mental shakings can prove us wrong again. The way
to disarm Father Coughlin is to arm his listeners with
security.
Few people will believe "the likes of Father Cough
lin" when they are satisfied with their lot. The dema
gogue's words will only turn a well-filled stomach.
