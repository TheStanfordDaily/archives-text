## SILENCING THE FATHER 
### 
Hp HE EDITOR. SIR:
Bull Sessioner's "Wayward Winds of Freedom"
was excellently written, of course, and the contemptu
ous disposal of Pappy Coughlin in its early paragraphs
was as skillful as it was just.
From then on, however, Mr. Mellinkoff seems to
fall into the terror incurred by so many modern lib
erals. He teeters backward to protect the Bill of Rights,
Civil Liberties, and American Principles.
But permitting propagandists to attack these rights,
liberties, and principles is no more sensible than buying
a billfold with one's last dollar. The one thing Amer
icans dare not tolerate is intolerance.
Allowing the likes of Father Coughlin to exploit
freedom of speech in assailing our other vital freedoms
is foolhardy. Any propagandist against American prin
ciples is automatically cutting himself off from Amer
ican liberties, and should be denied not only the free
dom of the air waves, but of the mails and of the soap
box.
Worshipping Civil Liberties for their own sake 'is
just as vacantly symbolical as saluting Old Glory in
technicolor.
