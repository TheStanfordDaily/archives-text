# POOR HORTENSE

### 
r |UIE EDITOR, SIR:
Poor Hortense seems to need a Bawlout average
to bolster her up, for it seems that Wheaties have not
helped her womanly characteristics any.
The Bawlout. Ugh. That thing is too impersonal
to be of any real practical use, except by lecture as
sistants who give you a grade in an exam that corre
sponds to your Bawlout average. Just as that friend
of the Stanford stjudent, Dean Culver once said, the
Bawlout does not show if a student is working his
way through school; it does not tell if the student has
been sick, if he has had family troubles, if he has
noisy room-mates or anything else except his name,
major, the hieroglyphic numbers and his address.

VL'HEN a student graduates, his Bawlout average is
forgotten; if he registers for grad work, it is not
put in any more. But the poor undergraduate has to
have his average there for friends to look at, for ene
mies to leer at, for instructors to judge by and for the
Stanford Press to live by.
I personally think the publication of the averages
is an insult to Stanford students, one of the many
that are piled up on vis as if we were babes in arms.
And, frankly, Hortense (if you are listening) and any
one else who likes the Bawlout, there are a few of vis
who are damned sick of that publication. Someone
ought to wise up. and I think it is the Administration.
Fifth Floor Grad
P.S.: Yeah. I know what you are thinking. If you
must know, I graduated with 181 plus lf>B.
