# Jumper Tunes Previewed For Jive Record Fans
## 
### 
And now for you hugs who like to get out of the Freddy Martin flop
house and grab a listen at the real stuir. we are dishing up a little
advanced dope on a few recordings.
Best recorded jump tune of this fall is "Woodchopper's Ball (Decca,
2440 A). In case you haven't heard this platter, it is an instrumentation,

featuring clean but not spectacular*
work in sax, trombone and trumpet
solo work. And listen for that bass
chorus near the end. It's one of the j
best ever cut. On the other side—
"Big Wig in the Wigwam," a torn
tommy stock arrangement with
worthless lyrics. But "Woodchop
per's" makes this disk worth your
35 cents.
'WIIAT'S NEW?'
As for the new Columbia-Benny
Goodman cut of "What's New?"—
well, don't bother much about it.
unless you love Goodman, because
that's all it is—plain old Goodman.!
Charlie Barnett, the- boy who lost j
his orchestrations in the Palomar
Ballroom fire, has recorded the best j
of "What's New?" (Bluebird, B- j
10361-B). Barnett really handles his !
sax section well in this number, and |
with a muted trumpet-backing rid- ;
ing up behind, the recording is a
killer.
On the other side—"For Tonight." j
Opening bars sound much like Tom :
Dorsey, with some very reaching!
sax work by Charlie. Vocal poor on
this side.
BASIE'S SAXES GOOD
For a real jumper, the nod goes to
Count Basic's "Every Tub." Opens
with a marvelous tenor sax riff by j
Lou Young, a fairly new man with j
the band, and then more sax chor
using with muted trumpets riding
up above. These boggies use a hard ,
sax reed, os watch them, hit flat and j
then slide up to the note. Plenty j
sweet. (Decca, 1728 A). On the other I
side—a shuffle tune, "Now Will You
Be Good," with a typical Jimmy j
Rushing vocal. It's a typical boggie j
bounce but the technique is good. j
Some of the good ones to get:
Charlie Barnett's "Cherokee,"
Glen Miller's "Blue Orchids," and
"Over the Rainbow." A future hit
tune will be Miller's "Wham Re
Bop Boom Bam," which is another
"Jumpin' Jive." And look for this
one. It hasn't been recorded yet, but
it's a cinch to be cut soon: "A Man
and His Drums" by Jimmie Dorsey.

sax reed, os watch them, hit flat and j
then slide up to the note. Plenty j
sweet. (Decca, 1728 A). On the other I
side—a shuffle tune, "Now Will You
Be Good," with a typical Jimmy j
Rushing vocal. It's a typical boggie j
bounce but the technique is good. j
Some of the good ones to get:
Charlie Barnett's "Cherokee,"
Glen Miller's "Blue Orchids," and
"Over the Rainbow." A future hit
tune will be Miller's "Wham Re
Bop Boom Bam," which is another
"Jumpin' Jive." And look for this
one. It hasn't been recorded yet, but
it's a cinch to be cut soon: "A Man
and His Drums" by Jimmie Dorsey.

And now for you hugs who like to get out of the Freddy Martin flop
house and grab a listen at the real stuir. we are dishing up a little
advanced dope on a few recordings.
Best recorded jump tune of this fall is "Woodchopper's Ball (Decca,
2440 A). In case you haven't heard this platter, it is an instrumentation,

featuring clean but not spectacular*
work in sax, trombone and trumpet
solo work. And listen for that bass
chorus near the end. It's one of the j
best ever cut. On the other side—
"Big Wig in the Wigwam," a torn
tommy stock arrangement with
worthless lyrics. But "Woodchop
per's" makes this disk worth your
35 cents.
'WIIAT'S NEW?'
As for the new Columbia-Benny
Goodman cut of "What's New?"—
well, don't bother much about it.
unless you love Goodman, because
that's all it is—plain old Goodman.!
Charlie Barnett, the- boy who lost j
his orchestrations in the Palomar
Ballroom fire, has recorded the best j
of "What's New?" (Bluebird, B- j
10361-B). Barnett really handles his !
sax section well in this number, and |
with a muted trumpet-backing rid- ;
ing up behind, the recording is a
killer.
On the other side—"For Tonight." j
Opening bars sound much like Tom :
Dorsey, with some very reaching!
sax work by Charlie. Vocal poor on
this side.
BASIE'S SAXES GOOD
For a real jumper, the nod goes to
Count Basic's "Every Tub." Opens
with a marvelous tenor sax riff by j
Lou Young, a fairly new man with j
the band, and then more sax chor
using with muted trumpets riding
up above. These boggies use a hard ,
sax reed, os watch them, hit flat and j
then slide up to the note. Plenty j
sweet. (Decca, 1728 A). On the other I
side—a shuffle tune, "Now Will You
Be Good," with a typical Jimmy j
Rushing vocal. It's a typical boggie j
