### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
t )NE of the objections to any strict
neutrality legislation that would
prevent shipment of goods on
American vessels is the obvious fact
that the United States merchant ma
rine would lie seriously damaged.
Even though the government has
subsidized and babied the merchant
marine, it's plain that any injury to
it would be infinitely preferable to
the entanglement of this country in
foreign controversies. The last war
taught us that sinking American
ships with American nationals on
board can cause a great amount of
trouble, especially when phrases
such as "freedom of the seas" and
"rights of neutrals" arc bandied
around none too intelligently by
propagandists.
* * *Jt
Nevertheless, Pacific Coast ship
ping interests seem to be getting a
slight nod from the Administration
with the romantic news that a "se
cret meeting" of the democratic
members of the Senate Foreign Re
lations committee will be held this
week to prepare an amendment re
laxing restrictions of the new Neu
trality Bill as applied to Pacific
commerce.
The aura of glamour that sur
rounds closed doors and hushed
committee sessions lends credence
to the fact that the revision of the
Administration's bill is actually a
compromise move to entice cer
tain Isolationists to the govern
ment camp. The Isolationists are
frankly and admittedly divided on
the issue.
Such a compromise would give the
President discretionary power to ex
empt areas remote from the Eu
ropean war from the shipping bans,
but would absolutely require him to
withdraw these exemptions when
ever seamen or ships were endan
gered. Under this plan, commerce
could be continued between the
United States and countries only
nominally at war such as Australia,
New Zealand, and the Union of
South Africa.
* * *
ADMINISTRATION leaders ap
parently have sounded out sen
timent and are reasonably confi
dent that such a revision would be
overwhelmingly approved by the
Senate. Of course, they're counting
on the support of several Pacific
Coast senators who are leading the
fight of the Isolationists.
' Senator Hiram Johnson, who
fought side by side with Borah to
keep the United States out of the
League of Nations, and Junior Sen
ator Sheridan Downey are under
stood to favor a change, but others
in the bloc, including Rush Holt of
West Virginia, oppose it. Holt said
last night that the only justification
for relaxation of prohibitions would
be that the danger to Pacific ship
ping might be less than the hazards
to Atlantic commerce.
* n *
HPHERE'S a chance, however,
(hat the proposed change
would seriously weaken the im
portant "title and carry" provision
of the bill. There are several sen
ators who pledged support of the
Administration's measure only
after they had been assured that
there would be an ironbound pro
vision requiring foreign purchas
ers of American materials to take
litlc to them and to transport
them in their own ships. This is a
point that has not been success
fully decided by arguers, pro and
con.
As debate over the new bill pro
ceeds, the Isolationists admit frank
ly, if privately, that they're playing
for time. Few of them believe that
they can win in the Senate, but
they're counting on back-home re
action to influence the House in
their favor.
There were plenty of reports this
week-end that the Administration
majority in the House is being
slowly but surely whittled and
Democratic Whip Pat Boland of
Pennsylvania is making a poll to
gauge the present comparative
strength of the Isolationists and the
Administration.

Democratic Whip Pat Boland of
Pennsylvania is making a poll to
gauge the present comparative
strength of the Isolationists and the
Administration.
t )NE of the objections to any strict
neutrality legislation that would
prevent shipment of goods on
American vessels is the obvious fact
that the United States merchant ma
rine would lie seriously damaged.
Even though the government has
subsidized and babied the merchant
marine, it's plain that any injury to
it would be infinitely preferable to
the entanglement of this country in
foreign controversies. The last war
taught us that sinking American
ships with American nationals on
board can cause a great amount of
trouble, especially when phrases
such as "freedom of the seas" and
"rights of neutrals" arc bandied
around none too intelligently by
propagandists.
* * *Jt
Nevertheless, Pacific Coast ship
ping interests seem to be getting a
slight nod from the Administration
with the romantic news that a "se
cret meeting" of the democratic
members of the Senate Foreign Re
lations committee will be held this
week to prepare an amendment re
laxing restrictions of the new Neu
trality Bill as applied to Pacific
commerce.
The aura of glamour that sur
rounds closed doors and hushed
committee sessions lends credence
to the fact that the revision of the
Administration's bill is actually a
compromise move to entice cer
tain Isolationists to the govern
ment camp. The Isolationists are
frankly and admittedly divided on
the issue.
Such a compromise would give the
President discretionary power to ex
empt areas remote from the Eu
ropean war from the shipping bans,
but would absolutely require him to
withdraw these exemptions when
ever seamen or ships were endan
gered. Under this plan, commerce
could be continued between the
United States and countries only
nominally at war such as Australia,
New Zealand, and the Union of
South Africa.
* * *
ADMINISTRATION leaders ap
parently have sounded out sen
timent and are reasonably confi
dent that such a revision would be
overwhelmingly approved by the
Senate. Of course, they're counting
on the support of several Pacific
Coast senators who are leading the
fight of the Isolationists.
' Senator Hiram Johnson, who
fought side by side with Borah to
keep the United States out of the
League of Nations, and Junior Sen
ator Sheridan Downey are under
stood to favor a change, but others
in the bloc, including Rush Holt of
West Virginia, oppose it. Holt said
last night that the only justification
for relaxation of prohibitions would
be that the danger to Pacific ship
ping might be less than the hazards
to Atlantic commerce.
* n *
HPHERE'S a chance, however,
(hat the proposed change
would seriously weaken the im
portant "title and carry" provision
of the bill. There are several sen
ators who pledged support of the
Administration's measure only
after they had been assured that
there would be an ironbound pro
vision requiring foreign purchas
ers of American materials to take
litlc to them and to transport
them in their own ships. This is a
point that has not been success
fully decided by arguers, pro and
con.
As debate over the new bill pro
ceeds, the Isolationists admit frank
ly, if privately, that they're playing
for time. Few of them believe that
they can win in the Senate, but
they're counting on back-home re
action to influence the House in
their favor.
