# Nazis Begin 'Relentless' Sub Attacks
## Three Liners Sunk In Answer to Allies' Refusal of Peace 
### United Press 
Germany appeared Sunday night
to be carrying out her threat of re
lentless submarine attacks which
Nazi leaders warned would be
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler's answer to the
Allies' rejection of his bid for peace
on his own terms.
In the U-boat attacks in the At
lantic on two French Line ships, one
of them the 10,108-ton passenger
vessel Bretagne, gunfire was directed
at the attacked vessels before they
were sunk. Women and children
aboard the Bretagne were reported
by survivors to have been wounded
when shells hit lifeboats being low
ered. Some of the 124 passengers
aboard the Bretagne were tossed
into the sea and shells shattered
lifeboats, it was reported.
In addition to the Bretagne and
the 6.903-ton French merchantman
Louisiane, Germany's "second
wave" of submarine attacks was re
vealed to have sunk the new and
speedy British merchant ship Loch
avon of the Royal Mail Line.
800 DOWN IN ROYAL OAK
The sinkings occurred Friday
night and Saturday, while attention
was being focused on the U-boat
torpedoing and sinking of the Royal
Oak, one of Britain's 12 battleships,
with a loss of about 800 lives.
For a week and a half—while Hit
ler sought to sell the world his pro
posals for ending the war—Ger
many's submarines withheld their
attacks. Then, on Friday, a British
freighter and a large French tanker,
the Emile Miguet, were torpedoed
and sent to the bottom. That was
after the Nazis announced that the
war was on "in earnest" because of
what they called the Allies' "insult
ing" rejection of Hitler's bid.
VICTIMS SHELLED
The sinkings of the Bretagne, the
Louisiane and the Lochavon appear
ed to have taken between 10 and 15
lives and among the 400 survivors
landed at Plymouth, England, by
British warships Sunday were 39
persons on stretchers.
The French captains complained
angrily that the German U-boat
commanders had "deliberately"
shelled their ships while crews and
passengers were scrambling into
lifeboats.
It appeared, however, that, the
submarines' shells which wrecked
the lifeboats and wounded men,
women and children were aimed
principally at the ships' wireless ap
paratus, seeking to put it out of
commission before Allied warships
could be summoned.
BRITISH PATROLS ATTACK
On the western front, bogged down
by rain and mud reminiscent of 1914-
18, some of the 160,000 or more Brit
ish troops in France went into ac
tion against the Germans on a small
scaie, jabbing at German advance
positions in patrol sorties, supported
by British artillery.
The French still professed to be
lieve that Hitler is preparing for a
major offensive on the western front,
but many military experts doubted
that the Fuehrer would undertake
such a costly move. To drive a
breach in France's $500,000,000
Maginot Line, according to these
experts, might cost the Germans
500,000 or 1,000,000,000 casualties.

ish troops in France went into ac
tion against the Germans on a small
scaie, jabbing at German advance
positions in patrol sorties, supported
by British artillery.
The French still professed to be
lieve that Hitler is preparing for a
major offensive on the western front,
but many military experts doubted
that the Fuehrer would undertake
such a costly move. To drive a
breach in France's $500,000,000
Maginot Line, according to these
experts, might cost the Germans
500,000 or 1,000,000,000 casualties.
Germany appeared Sunday night
to be carrying out her threat of re
lentless submarine attacks which
Nazi leaders warned would be
Fuehrer Adolf Hitler's answer to the
Allies' rejection of his bid for peace
on his own terms.
In the U-boat attacks in the At
lantic on two French Line ships, one
of them the 10,108-ton passenger
vessel Bretagne, gunfire was directed
at the attacked vessels before they
were sunk. Women and children
aboard the Bretagne were reported
by survivors to have been wounded
when shells hit lifeboats being low
ered. Some of the 124 passengers
aboard the Bretagne were tossed
into the sea and shells shattered
lifeboats, it was reported.
In addition to the Bretagne and
the 6.903-ton French merchantman
Louisiane, Germany's "second
wave" of submarine attacks was re
vealed to have sunk the new and
speedy British merchant ship Loch
avon of the Royal Mail Line.
800 DOWN IN ROYAL OAK
The sinkings occurred Friday
night and Saturday, while attention
was being focused on the U-boat
torpedoing and sinking of the Royal
Oak, one of Britain's 12 battleships,
with a loss of about 800 lives.
For a week and a half—while Hit
ler sought to sell the world his pro
posals for ending the war—Ger
many's submarines withheld their
attacks. Then, on Friday, a British
freighter and a large French tanker,
the Emile Miguet, were torpedoed
and sent to the bottom. That was
after the Nazis announced that the
war was on "in earnest" because of
what they called the Allies' "insult
ing" rejection of Hitler's bid.
VICTIMS SHELLED
The sinkings of the Bretagne, the
Louisiane and the Lochavon appear
ed to have taken between 10 and 15
lives and among the 400 survivors
landed at Plymouth, England, by
British warships Sunday were 39
persons on stretchers.
The French captains complained
angrily that the German U-boat
commanders had "deliberately"
shelled their ships while crews and
passengers were scrambling into
lifeboats.
It appeared, however, that, the
submarines' shells which wrecked
the lifeboats and wounded men,
women and children were aimed
principally at the ships' wireless ap
paratus, seeking to put it out of
commission before Allied warships
could be summoned.
BRITISH PATROLS ATTACK
On the western front, bogged down
by rain and mud reminiscent of 1914-
18, some of the 160,000 or more Brit
ish troops in France went into ac
