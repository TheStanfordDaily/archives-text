Approximately 1,000 students and
faculty members are expected to be
present at the student-faculty field
day slated for Wednesday afternoon
on the intramural field, it was an
nounced yesterday by Art Gore, co
chairman of the affair with Powers
Cameron.
Plans for the celebration are be
ing revamped to include the possi
bility of the largest crowd ever to
assemble for a student-faculty field
day, Gore said. Last year 900 cele
brants gathered for the occasion.
POLL TO BE TAKEN
A poll of all eating clubs, dormi
tories, and the Row will be held to
day in an attempt to ascertain the
approximate number of people who
will attend. Tickets for the dinner,
which will be served on the field at
5 o'clock, will be distributed at this
time.
"We are especially urging all Stan
ford women to attend the field day,"
Gore said.
Expected to be a featured contest
of the day will be the volleyball
game between a picked team of En
cina freshmen and a team composed
of their Western Civ professors. The
professors will be out for revenge,
having bowed to the frosh in two
field-day baseball games in the past.
TRICK RACES FEATURED
Another high-light of the occa
sion will be the three-legged race,
in which student leaders will team
with faculty members in an attempt
to wrest the crown now held by
A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthbert
son and Profesosr Leland Chapin.
Horseshoe pitching, several tables
of ping pong, and other contests will
pit students against their professors.
A buffet dinner will be served by
freshman women on the field.
