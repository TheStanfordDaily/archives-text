# Chaparral Sales Start Wednesday
## 
### 
Sporting a cover suitable for
framing and a new, more-readable
typo face, the Chaparral will make
its first appearance of the year on
Wednesday.
Editor Marco Thornc has an
nounced a new policy in the selec
tion of cartoons and the make-up
so that the magazine will last longer
than the usual ten-minute glance.
Unique features by new talent have
also been promised.
Ken Smith, circulation manager,
has called a meeting of all sales
girls today at 3 o'clock to receive
instructions.
