# B.A.C. Acts On Angell Field Stands
## Group Withholds Decision on New Head Track Coach 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Persistent rumors that Stanford's
Board of Athletic Control had lost
interest in the sport of track and
field were definitely quieted last
Friday night when that body adopted
a resolution approving consideration
for bleachers on Angell Field.
While the B.A.C. had previously
downed agitation on the proposed
stands as currently "unfeasible,"
their latest move toward quasi-com
pletion of the Pacific Coast's finest
track and field arena may possibly
end with the 1940 Stanford-Cali
fornia Big Meet being held on the
super-track.
The Board made it clear, however,
that it did not intend to award any
contracts for the entire project at
present. The problem of finance
would render immediate completion
impossible, they intimated.
WITHHOLDS ACTION
At the same time the Board with
held action on the selection of a new
track coach until a later date. A
staff committee was appointed to
canvass the field for the "most out
standing man" available.
In the meantime, Bill Ellington,
the incumbent freshman coach, and
Jack Weiershauser, recently ap
pointed varsity assistant, will su
pervise the fall workouts.
Any plans which the Board might
have for the Angell bleachers were
suspended pending the development
of a preliminary survey on several
types of construction. All these pre
liminary arrangements are expected
to be completed before the Decem
ber meeting.
NO APPROVAL
None of the members of the or
ganization was willing to approve
any financial arrangements although
several suggestions for handling the
bleacher payments were forwarded.
Most popular of these seemed to be
a plan whereby the present install
ment on Branner Hall would be
postponed for a year. Payments on
the hall are already three years in
advance of the original contract.
The investigating survey will not
call for completion of the entire plant
for the 1940 season, but should the
plans go forward without impedi
ment, it is entirely possible that the
BA.C. will put its official stamp on
the project at the December meet
ing. Deferring the Branner Hall
payment would leave the Board ap
proximately $15,000 as a working
fund.
Minor business of the Control
group included a grant for the Stan
ford band to go to Los Angeles for
the S.C. game, and a southern trip
for the varsity soccer squad.

types of construction. All these pre
liminary arrangements are expected
to be completed before the Decem
ber meeting.
NO APPROVAL
None of the members of the or
ganization was willing to approve
any financial arrangements although
several suggestions for handling the
bleacher payments were forwarded.
Most popular of these seemed to be
a plan whereby the present install
ment on Branner Hall would be
postponed for a year. Payments on
the hall are already three years in
advance of the original contract.
The investigating survey will not
call for completion of the entire plant
for the 1940 season, but should the
plans go forward without impedi
ment, it is entirely possible that the
BA.C. will put its official stamp on
the project at the December meet
ing. Deferring the Branner Hall
payment would leave the Board ap
proximately $15,000 as a working
fund.
Minor business of the Control
group included a grant for the Stan
ford band to go to Los Angeles for
the S.C. game, and a southern trip
for the varsity soccer squad.
Persistent rumors that Stanford's
Board of Athletic Control had lost
interest in the sport of track and
field were definitely quieted last
Friday night when that body adopted
a resolution approving consideration
for bleachers on Angell Field.
While the B.A.C. had previously
downed agitation on the proposed
stands as currently "unfeasible,"
their latest move toward quasi-com
pletion of the Pacific Coast's finest
track and field arena may possibly
end with the 1940 Stanford-Cali
fornia Big Meet being held on the
super-track.
The Board made it clear, however,
that it did not intend to award any
contracts for the entire project at
present. The problem of finance
would render immediate completion
impossible, they intimated.
WITHHOLDS ACTION
At the same time the Board with
held action on the selection of a new
track coach until a later date. A
staff committee was appointed to
canvass the field for the "most out
standing man" available.
In the meantime, Bill Ellington,
the incumbent freshman coach, and
Jack Weiershauser, recently ap
pointed varsity assistant, will su
pervise the fall workouts.
Any plans which the Board might
have for the Angell bleachers were
suspended pending the development
of a preliminary survey on several
types of construction. All these pre
liminary arrangements are expected
to be completed before the Decem
ber meeting.
