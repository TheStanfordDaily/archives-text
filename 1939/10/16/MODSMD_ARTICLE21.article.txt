# Standlee Leads Indians In Uclan Game as Cards Chalk Up 'Moral Victory'
## Rejuvenated Indians Score Upset Against Undefeated Bruins' Aerial Attack Results in Lead, Downfall 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Shades of Ernie Ncvers and Bobby Grayson cavorted on the Stanf»rd
gridiron in our Indians' 14-15 deadlock with U.C.L.A. Saturday.
Boom! It was Norm Standlee on a drifter over tackle. Boom! Chalk
up three more for Standlee on a centcr smash. Boom! There's seven
more yards for Standlee on an end sweep.

, There wasn't much the Bruins
could do about it, either. The Big
Chief was well respected as a line
plunger. But 218 pounds of a hu
man catapult who can pile up huge
yardage on tackle drifts as well as
Grayson and move around the
flanks like a truck isn't usually
found all in the same person.
TIED-UP CONFERENCE
While our Indians were making
their first dent into the scoring col
umn, the Coast Conference football
race was in a real dither. Three of
the four top undefeated teams have
tied a contest each. In other Sat
urday games, the Trojans cut down
the Illini, 26-0, while W.S.C. topped
the Washington Huskies, 6-0. Ore
gon smashed Cal, 6-0, for its second
conference win. Oregon State eked
out a two-score win over Portland.
To get back to Saturday's busi
ness. The starting line-up for Stan
ford had five changes from the ono
which opened last week against Ore
gon. It just wasn't supposed to be
in the cards that Tiny Thornhill held
to have his master strokes work to
such advantage.
They moved Corky Donahue to
tackle to bolster a gaping weak
ness. All he did was to slap down
just about everything thrown at
him, and he didn't have any sup
port from his right side because Tiny
had Stojkovich or Meyer knocking
Robinson down whether he had the
ball or not.
GUARDS SHINE
Kerman and Patterson were shov
ed into the two guard posts when
Pool and Donahue moved to new
jobs. Their vicious tackling was the
pride and joy of Tiny's team as
they turned back charge after
charge turned their way by Wash
ington, Cantor, Overlin, etc.
Both quarter and left half posi
tions were subject to abrupt changes
last week. But at the end of the
scoring match Coldiron and Albert
were back in there — better than
ever and pretty well established as
first-string threats even after a
week's demotion.
For the next two weeks Tiny's
gridders will be polished before
their newly found offense is tested
at Seattle against the Huskies. So
when the Indians come back three
weeks hencc against Santa Clara,
we ought to see one of the sturdiest
offensive and defensive teams on the
coast.
UCLAN RECOVERING
Chuck Fenenbock, U.C.L.A., who
was carried off the field with a
concussion, left last night for Los
Angeles recovered sufficiently to
make the trip. Stanford came
through without any serious re
minder of Washington's and Robin
son's running.
Albert's third-down decision to
fire a pass instead of protecting a
seven-point, lead drew no comment
of criticism from Tiny. The whoje
team wanted another score, and
Albert was not Ihe least satisfied
with the slim lead. That's the way
games are won anyway.

had Stojkovich or Meyer knocking
Robinson down whether he had the
ball or not.
GUARDS SHINE
Kerman and Patterson were shov
ed into the two guard posts when
Pool and Donahue moved to new
jobs. Their vicious tackling was the
pride and joy of Tiny's team as
they turned back charge after
charge turned their way by Wash
ington, Cantor, Overlin, etc.
Both quarter and left half posi
tions were subject to abrupt changes
last week. But at the end of the
scoring match Coldiron and Albert
were back in there — better than
ever and pretty well established as
first-string threats even after a
week's demotion.
For the next two weeks Tiny's
gridders will be polished before
their newly found offense is tested
at Seattle against the Huskies. So
when the Indians come back three
weeks hencc against Santa Clara,
we ought to see one of the sturdiest
offensive and defensive teams on the
coast.
UCLAN RECOVERING
Chuck Fenenbock, U.C.L.A., who
was carried off the field with a
concussion, left last night for Los
Angeles recovered sufficiently to
make the trip. Stanford came
through without any serious re
minder of Washington's and Robin
son's running.
Albert's third-down decision to
fire a pass instead of protecting a
seven-point, lead drew no comment
of criticism from Tiny. The whoje
team wanted another score, and
Albert was not Ihe least satisfied
with the slim lead. That's the way
games are won anyway.
Shades of Ernie Ncvers and Bobby Grayson cavorted on the Stanf»rd
gridiron in our Indians' 14-15 deadlock with U.C.L.A. Saturday.
Boom! It was Norm Standlee on a drifter over tackle. Boom! Chalk
up three more for Standlee on a centcr smash. Boom! There's seven
more yards for Standlee on an end sweep.

, There wasn't much the Bruins
could do about it, either. The Big
Chief was well respected as a line
plunger. But 218 pounds of a hu
man catapult who can pile up huge
yardage on tackle drifts as well as
Grayson and move around the
flanks like a truck isn't usually
found all in the same person.
TIED-UP CONFERENCE
While our Indians were making
their first dent into the scoring col
umn, the Coast Conference football
race was in a real dither. Three of
the four top undefeated teams have
tied a contest each. In other Sat
urday games, the Trojans cut down
the Illini, 26-0, while W.S.C. topped
the Washington Huskies, 6-0. Ore
gon smashed Cal, 6-0, for its second
conference win. Oregon State eked
out a two-score win over Portland.
To get back to Saturday's busi
ness. The starting line-up for Stan
ford had five changes from the ono
which opened last week against Ore
gon. It just wasn't supposed to be
in the cards that Tiny Thornhill held
to have his master strokes work to
such advantage.
They moved Corky Donahue to
tackle to bolster a gaping weak
ness. All he did was to slap down
just about everything thrown at
him, and he didn't have any sup
port from his right side because Tiny
had Stojkovich or Meyer knocking
Robinson down whether he had the
ball or not.
