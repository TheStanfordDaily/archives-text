# Chairmen List Bands Eligible For Cal Dance
## Basie, Greer, Arnheim May Play for Farm; Possible Site Named 
### 
Count Basie, Jimmy Greer, and
Gus Arnheim are the big - name
bands available on Nov. 25, date of
the Big Game night off- campus
dance, according to Co-chairmen
Kuth Ide and Goody Nicholl who
have been negotiating with the Mu
sic Corporation of America.
Tentative plans have been made
to hold the dance at the Bay Mead
ows clubhouse, since it is one of the
largest on the Peninsula, but details
will remain unsettled until the price
and name of the band have been
decided.
Arrangements for a supper or
breakfast during the evening will
be made when the orchestra has
been engaged, according to the com
mittee appointed by Cardinals Chair
man Ken Koch last week.
As soon as definite plans are made
for place, price, and policing of the
dance, a report will be submitted to
Deans Mary Yost and John Bunn
for official approval, according to
A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthbertson.
While plans were being made for
Big Game night, Ned Pugh, Cardi
nals dance chairman, reported that
the U.C.L.A. game dance Saturday
night was attended by about 275
couples. The $100 profit will go into
the Boathouse fund.
