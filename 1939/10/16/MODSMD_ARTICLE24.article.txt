# Plane Endurance Record Smashed
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 15 (UP). -
The light airplane endurance rec
ord changed with every tick of the
clock today as Clyde Schleiper and
Wes Carroll, Long Beach pilots,
continued in the air over Rosamond
Dry Lake.
Schleiper and Carroll have al
ready cracked the record of 343
hours held by the Moody brothers
of Springfield, 111., and were start
ing the 17th day of their flight in a
tiny seaplane, near 400 hours. They
said they hoped to beat the unlim
ited all-time record of 30 days.
Unimpressed by the success of
the Long Beach team, Troy Colboch
and Jerry Keeley, flying over Santa
Ana airport, reached their 11th day
in the air without event and re
ported to the ground, "We're going
strong."
