### 
TOKYO, Oct. 15 (UP).—Japan if,
determined to create a new central
government in China strong enough
to bear its full share of the task of
reorganizing East Asia, Premier
General Nobuyuki Abe said today
in an interview.

must be carried out by Japan and
; China alone, without the aid of out
side nations, the Premier said.

BOUND TO JAPAN
The Premier did not elaborate his
remarks, but it was assumed he
meant that the "new China" will be
bound to Japan by a military alli
ance, as is Manchukuo, thus creating
a Far East military block of three
nations with a combined total popu
lation of at least 300.000,000.
All diplomatic affairs of the empire
must be regarded in the light of
Japan's aim for an early termination
of the China conflict, the Premier
said.
OBSTACLES NO BAR
Japan intends to carry forward
j "against all obstacles" the reorgani
zation of East Asia, General Abe
I said. The new Chinese regime un
der Wang Chiang-wei will be her
partner.
The reorganization, however, will
be carried out on a "neutral" basis.
The rights of third powers will be
respected and an effort will be made
to convince the world of the "sin
cerity" of Japan's aims, which are
the preservation of peace in East
Asia, the establishment of prosper
ous conditions for all the people,
and co-operation with all nations for
international stability, the Premier
said.
DEEDS, NOT WORDS
] The Premier suggested that no
formal international negotiations
| will be necessary to achieve the
Japanese program, which will be
worked out slowly on a basis of
deeds rather than words.
The Domei news agency said that
Wang's secretary, F, H. Chou, is in
; conference with officials here re
: garding formation of the new China
; regime.
The new government will base its
! policy on the principles of the late
I Dr. Sun Yat-sen. founder of the
I modern Chinese state, and "will pur-
I sue a moderate social policy."

cerity" of Japan's aims, which are
the preservation of peace in East
Asia, the establishment of prosper
ous conditions for all the people,
and co-operation with all nations for
international stability, the Premier
said.

TOKYO, Oct. 15 (UP).—Japan if,
determined to create a new central
government in China strong enough
to bear its full share of the task of
reorganizing East Asia, Premier
General Nobuyuki Abe said today
in an interview.

must be carried out by Japan and
; China alone, without the aid of out
side nations, the Premier said.

ment, to be headed by former Chi
nese Premier Wang Ching-wei, will
be launched next month and natu
rally will be pledged to co-operation
with Japan.
BOUND TO JAPAN
The Premier did not elaborate his
remarks, but it was assumed he
meant that the "new China" will be
bound to Japan by a military alli
ance, as is Manchukuo, thus creating
a Far East military block of three
nations with a combined total popu
lation of at least 300.000,000.
All diplomatic affairs of the empire
must be regarded in the light of
Japan's aim for an early termination
of the China conflict, the Premier
said.

j "against all obstacles" the reorgani
zation of East Asia, General Abe
I said. The new Chinese regime un
der Wang Chiang-wei will be her
partner.
