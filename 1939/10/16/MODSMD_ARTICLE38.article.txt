# 'Divide' Faces Technical Woes
## Southwest Setting Has Unusual Scenes 
### 
The problem of squeezing a vast
southwestern mesa onto a stage the
size of a tennis court has been
troubling Waldemar Johansen, tech
nical director for the Division of
Speech and Drama production ol
the "Great Divide," which will be
presented on Friday and Saturday
nights.
Since the play tells the story of
early American problems in the
Southwest, it demands some device
to give it broad panoramic realism.
Johansen has achieved this end by
designing a plate projection which
throws the scene upon a specially
built cyclorama.
"The Great Divide's" three set
tings have usually made its produc
tion impossible in intimate the
aters. The Memorial Hall, because
of the size of its stage, is equipped
for a presentation of this scope. The
huge interior sets have been mount
ed on casters so that they may be
easily rolled into position.
All tickets are 50 cents and may be
obtained by telephoning P.A. 2201
or Mr. Barker in the Division of
Speech and Drama. Script books
containing tickets for six productions
may also be purchased from Mr.
Barker.
