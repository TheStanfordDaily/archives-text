# Frosh Drop 13-12 Tilt To Tough U.S.C. Squad
## Shipkey's Men Outgain Heavy Trojan Eleven 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Every week-end during the fall
football season some grid team re
alizes the value of those usually un
obtrusive tries for point after
touchdown, but few in such a heart
breaking manner as Stanford's
plucky freshman eleven did last Sat
urday.
Playing 400 miles from home in
weather that was close to 85 de
grees, the Card yearlings outfought
and outgained a heavier Trojan
team only to lose, 13-12, by that
precious one point.
U.S.C.'s freshmen were definitely
all that pre-game notices had said,
a rock and sock team that banked
heavily on its weight for power
plays off tackle and on their over
whelming number of reserves.
I'APOOSFS FIGHT
But the Papooses were a fighting
team and came with a rush in the
final minutes only to be denied.
They got first blood on a seven
yard pitch from A1 Cole to the arms
of little Johnny Chimenti in the
end zone. The try for the £xtra
point, was blocked. The Trobabes
came roaring back with a score in
the same period, the second quar
ter, on a series of line bucks by two
southern powerhouses, Bleeker and
Platz. Their attempt at conversion
was also blocked.
The second S.C. talley was set up
by a 20-yard pass and a 10-yard
smash by the persistent Bleeker.
This time the place kick for the de
ciding point was true.
Then, in the closing minutes, the
Cards rolled 80 yards to a touch
down only to have Dick Palmer's
try for point carrom off to one side.
The touchdown play was another
short pass from Cole to Bill Symes,
good for 8 yards.
COACHES PRAISE TEAM
The real story of the game, ac
cording to the words of praise freely
given by the coaches, was the way
the Card yearlings fought their
hearts out against weather, greater
weight, and greater numbers.
It concerns how well Chimenti
filled in for Eric Armstrong, who
was hurt after only 3 minutes of
play. Though Shipkey's team missed
Armstrong's speed, the chunky little
Chimenti played a whale of a game.
And how Dick Palmer, Bruno
Banducci, Ed McCain, Bill Mannon,
Rog Laverty, George Robinson all
literally played themselves to ex
haustion against those "best ever"
Trobabes.
COLE STANDS OUT
There was praise for A1 Cole, who
did a heady job of quarterbacking
besides tossing two touchdown pass
es. Milt Vucinich and Red Taylor
both did their share of ground gain
aing. Symes was shaxp on pass re
ceiving and Ed Stamm and Jack Tel
lefsen both "did time" in the Tro
jan backfield.
Though it was a rough and hard
fought. tussle with plenty of in
juries, no Papoose was hurt seriously
and Shipkey expects the squad to
be at full strength next Saturday.

Then, in the closing minutes, the
Cards rolled 80 yards to a touch
down only to have Dick Palmer's
try for point carrom off to one side.
The touchdown play was another
short pass from Cole to Bill Symes,
good for 8 yards.
COACHES PRAISE TEAM
The real story of the game, ac
cording to the words of praise freely
given by the coaches, was the way
the Card yearlings fought their
hearts out against weather, greater
weight, and greater numbers.
It concerns how well Chimenti
filled in for Eric Armstrong, who
was hurt after only 3 minutes of
play. Though Shipkey's team missed
Armstrong's speed, the chunky little
Chimenti played a whale of a game.
And how Dick Palmer, Bruno
Banducci, Ed McCain, Bill Mannon,
Rog Laverty, George Robinson all
literally played themselves to ex
haustion against those "best ever"
Trobabes.
COLE STANDS OUT
There was praise for A1 Cole, who
did a heady job of quarterbacking
besides tossing two touchdown pass
es. Milt Vucinich and Red Taylor
both did their share of ground gain
aing. Symes was shaxp on pass re
ceiving and Ed Stamm and Jack Tel
lefsen both "did time" in the Tro
jan backfield.
Though it was a rough and hard
fought. tussle with plenty of in
juries, no Papoose was hurt seriously
and Shipkey expects the squad to
be at full strength next Saturday.
Every week-end during the fall
football season some grid team re
alizes the value of those usually un
obtrusive tries for point after
touchdown, but few in such a heart
breaking manner as Stanford's
plucky freshman eleven did last Sat
urday.
Playing 400 miles from home in
weather that was close to 85 de
grees, the Card yearlings outfought
and outgained a heavier Trojan
team only to lose, 13-12, by that
precious one point.
U.S.C.'s freshmen were definitely
all that pre-game notices had said,
a rock and sock team that banked
heavily on its weight for power
plays off tackle and on their over
whelming number of reserves.
I'APOOSFS FIGHT
But the Papooses were a fighting
team and came with a rush in the
final minutes only to be denied.
They got first blood on a seven
yard pitch from A1 Cole to the arms
of little Johnny Chimenti in the
end zone. The try for the £xtra
point, was blocked. The Trobabes
came roaring back with a score in
the same period, the second quar
ter, on a series of line bucks by two
southern powerhouses, Bleeker and
Platz. Their attempt at conversion
was also blocked.
The second S.C. talley was set up
by a 20-yard pass and a 10-yard
smash by the persistent Bleeker.
This time the place kick for the de
ciding point was true.
Then, in the closing minutes, the
Cards rolled 80 yards to a touch
down only to have Dick Palmer's
try for point carrom off to one side.
