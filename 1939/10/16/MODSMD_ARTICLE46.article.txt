### JERRY MAYER 
HELLO. BOY. GLAD
TO SEE YOU-ALL
It's been printed already else
where, but the little story Tiny
Thornhill told the Indian gridders in
the dressing room before the U. C.
L. A. game bears repealing.
In the Texas Christian University
vs. U.C.L.A. game, one of the south
ern ball carriers took the ball from
center and headed off tackle. He
dodged one of the Bruins' numerous
colored players at the line of scrim
mage and tore through to the sec
ondary.
Another man missed him—again
a colored player. As the Texan
zig-/.aggcd down the field, two
more Bruins dived at him, hut
missed. Both were sepia-hued.
Finally there was only (he safety
man between the ball-carrier and
the goal-line. As the southerner
approached the U.C.L.A. safety
man he noticed that the latter was
a white boy.
Throwing down the football, the
T.C.U. player walked up to the Bruin
and, extending his hand, said:
"Dr. Livingstone, I presume."

REPORTS FROM NORTH
Slants feels well-rewarded, after
last week-end's game for being on
the Tiny Thornhill bandwagon. It
always was apparent to us that all
Stanford needed to get a winning
combination was for the line to
block and tackle the way the play
ers knew how, and for the backs to
complete their assignments as they
had been instructed.
It was obvious that Stanford's
troubles weren't the fault of the
coach. That was proved by the
fact that the Indians completely
outplayed U.C.L.A., the best team
they have met this year, while
they lost to two teams not so good
as the Bruins.
All the Cardinal gridders had to
do was find themselves. They
had the coaching.
And they knew it. They realized
that the team's shortcomings were
their own, not the coach's. They
were plugging for him all the way,
trying to make good for him while
the wolves howled their dirge of
discontent.
Watch them go now—they've
tasted blood.

the goal-line. As the southerner
approached the U.C.L.A. safety
man he noticed that the latter was
a white boy.
Throwing down the football, the
T.C.U. player walked up to the Bruin
and, extending his hand, said:
"Dr. Livingstone, I presume."
SPECIAL AGENT "X"
REPORTS FROM NORTH
Slants feels well-rewarded, after
last week-end's game for being on
the Tiny Thornhill bandwagon. It
always was apparent to us that all
Stanford needed to get a winning
combination was for the line to
block and tackle the way the play
ers knew how, and for the backs to
complete their assignments as they
had been instructed.
It was obvious that Stanford's
troubles weren't the fault of the
coach. That was proved by the
fact that the Indians completely
outplayed U.C.L.A., the best team
they have met this year, while
they lost to two teams not so good
as the Bruins.
All the Cardinal gridders had to
do was find themselves. They
had the coaching.
And they knew it. They realized
that the team's shortcomings were
their own, not the coach's. They
were plugging for him all the way,
trying to make good for him while
the wolves howled their dirge of
discontent.
Watch them go now—they've
tasted blood.
HELLO. BOY. GLAD
TO SEE YOU-ALL
It's been printed already else
where, but the little story Tiny
Thornhill told the Indian gridders in
the dressing room before the U. C.
L. A. game bears repealing.
In the Texas Christian University
vs. U.C.L.A. game, one of the south
ern ball carriers took the ball from
center and headed off tackle. He
dodged one of the Bruins' numerous
colored players at the line of scrim
mage and tore through to the sec
ondary.
Another man missed him—again
a colored player. As the Texan
zig-/.aggcd down the field, two
more Bruins dived at him, hut
missed. Both were sepia-hued.
Finally there was only (he safety
man between the ball-carrier and
the goal-line. As the southerner
approached the U.C.L.A. safety
man he noticed that the latter was
a white boy.
Throwing down the football, the
T.C.U. player walked up to the Bruin
and, extending his hand, said:
"Dr. Livingstone, I presume."
