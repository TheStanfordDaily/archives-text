# Theta Xi, Zetes To Clash Today
## Detls to Play Tigre In Mural Grid Tilt 
### 
Delta Tau Delta and Zeta P.si, two
of the better teams in the intra
mural football league, go to bat to
day in an attempt to knock out a
couple of base hits against El Tigre
and Theta Xi, respectively. If in
tramural teams follow the example
of the Pacific Coast Conference foot
ball, the Dolts and the Zetes are just
as likely as not to take a pair of
shellackings, and El Tigre and Theta
Xi are primed to deliver the upset
blows.
The featured game of tonight's
volleyball schedule brings together
Phi Kappa Sigma and Alpha Delta
Phi 11, a pair of very good teams.
