## 
### 
Card foilsmen took a 16-9 loss to
the Young Italian Club last Thurs
day night, but did better than the
j score indicates, according to Coach
Elwyn Bugge. Several of the bouts
I were very close, with fencers bat
-1 tling desperately for the deciding
| point.
John Cooper and Dick Myerhoff
were high-point men for the team,
| each scoring 3 out of a possible 5
j points. Francis Bray, Ed Cook and
Dave Daly each scored a point
| apiece. Next week the team will
j meet an independent squad from
! Cal.
