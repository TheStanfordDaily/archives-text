# Week-end Sees Two Upsets
## 
### 
With only two upsets taking place
to confuse the issue, the Pacific Coast
Conference straightened itself out
somewhat over the week-end.
In addition to Stanford's unex
pected tie with U.C.L.A.. Babe Hol
ingberry's Washington State Cou
gars fooled the experts by handing
the Washington Huskies a 6-0 lick
ing. The Cougars reached pay dirt
late in the first quarter and played
defensive football for the rest of the
game to gain their first conference
win since the end of the 1937 season.
Tex Oliver's surprising Oregon

! Webfeet climbed to the top of the
conference standings when they de
feated a stubborn but impotent Cali
fornia Bear, 6-0, in Berkeley.
The mighty U.S.C. Trojans, gath
ering steam after an uncertain start,
played host to Illinois in an inter
i sectional contest and smothered Bob
Zuppke's Fighting Illini under four
touchdowns, sending the visitors
back to the Midwest on the wrong
i end of a 26-0 score.
Tine Oregon State Beavers had to
I come from behind to defeat a lightly
i regarded Portland University team,
I 14-12.
