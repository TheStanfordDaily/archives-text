# S.M.J.C Soccer Squad Bows 5-0 On Card Field
## Farm Eleven Boots Way to Second Win; Teamwork Improves 
### 
Trouncing a strong San Mateo
Junior College team 5-0, the Card
soccer eleven copped their second J
victory of the season in a game
played on the local field Saturday
morning. j
Harry Maloney's squad looked
very powerful in beating a team I
that held the California Bears to a
2-1 score a week ago. With an uti- i
scorcd-on record to testify to their ;
defensive ability, the Indians have a ■
smooth working offense that over- j
whelmed the hard-working Bull
dogs.
Displaying more teamwork than !
in their opening game against Menlo |
last Wednesday, the Cards got off
to an early lead in the first quarter
when Francis Morgan and A1 Pellas
scored goals.
NEITHER SCORES
Neither team was able to score in
the second quarter of the game, al- j
though both elevens threatened
often. The Bulldogs took the ball
deep into Indian territory, but stellar
defensive play by Goalie Tito Sanz- ;
Agero and Fullbacks Bill Hamilton i
and Cameron Pierce thwarted all j
San Mateo scoring attempts.
The Indians went on a scoring i
spree in the second quarter. Goals |
by Wilson Clark and Chris Sontum ,
raised the count to and George !
Dole marked up the final tally with i
a beautiful 30-yard kick into the I
corner of the net just before the end I
of the period.
Maloney used his reserves almost |
entirely in the last quarter. They j
held the Bulldogs in check, but were j
unable to produce any scoring |
punch of their own.
MALONEY SATISFIED
Commenting on the game, Harry ;
Maloney said that he was very well j
satisfied with the team's showing. '
He was especially pleased by the j
improvement shown in the forward |
wall, although he expects to do
some experimenting in an effort to
find five men capable of working j
together.
Wilson Clark was moved up from
right half to center forward in the 1
second half of Saturday's game, and i
responded with a goal in the open- J
ing minutes of the period.

Maloney said that he was very well j
satisfied with the team's showing. '
He was especially pleased by the j
improvement shown in the forward |
wall, although he expects to do
some experimenting in an effort to
find five men capable of working j
together.
Wilson Clark was moved up from
right half to center forward in the 1
second half of Saturday's game, and i

Trouncing a strong San Mateo
Junior College team 5-0, the Card
soccer eleven copped their second J
victory of the season in a game
played on the local field Saturday
morning. j
Harry Maloney's squad looked
very powerful in beating a team I
that held the California Bears to a
2-1 score a week ago. With an uti- i
scorcd-on record to testify to their ;
defensive ability, the Indians have a ■
smooth working offense that over- j
whelmed the hard-working Bull
dogs.
Displaying more teamwork than !
in their opening game against Menlo |
last Wednesday, the Cards got off
to an early lead in the first quarter
when Francis Morgan and A1 Pellas
scored goals.
NEITHER SCORES
Neither team was able to score in
the second quarter of the game, al- j
though both elevens threatened
often. The Bulldogs took the ball
deep into Indian territory, but stellar
defensive play by Goalie Tito Sanz- ;
Agero and Fullbacks Bill Hamilton i
and Cameron Pierce thwarted all j
San Mateo scoring attempts.
