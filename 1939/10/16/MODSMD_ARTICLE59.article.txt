### 
TRACK at Stanford has been the subject of a
great many unpleasant rumors that have
been circulating in both local and national
circles during the past few months.
Probably originating with the Administra
tion's denial of the track team's request to at
tend the 1.C.4-A. meet last spring when it inter
fered with study schedules, the reports were
picked up and amplified by San Francisco and
Los Angeles newspapers and by a recent ar
ticle in Collier's magazine.
Firing no specific charges at the University,
the sports writers intimated, with all the sub
tlety that only a sports writer or an infuriated
truck driver can command, that track was all
washed up at Stanford.
The recent resignation of Dink Templeton had
the effect of pouring oil on the publicity bon
fire. And when Tex Byrd refused the job in
favor of an academic career, the dopesters were
willing to relegate Stanford's reign over the
cinderpath to the limbo of the glorious past.
Into this gloomy picture the B.A.C.'s proposal
to erect bleachers on Angell Field this year
burst like the rays of a gleaming sun. The
prophets of doom were left empty-handed.
Was this the university that had lost interest
in the sport, this Stanford that stood ready to
spend $15,000 on the first unit of the finest track
and field plant on the Pacific Coast?
Last year a student delegation complained
about holding meets in the Stadium wind-tunnel
and campaigned for the building of bleachers
at the super-fast Angell track. The B.A.C. re
fused to take action at that time because of an
unfavorable financial outlook and because no
major meets were scheduled for Stanford dur
ing the season.
This year at least one of those conditions no
longer exists. The Big Meet will be held on the
Farm, and there is a definite probability that we
will witness it from a new grandstand at Angell
Field.
And to make the picture perfect Stanford will
have an outstanding new coach —and perhaps
the greatest track team in its history.
