# Sour Notes in a Symphony
## 
### 
WHEN the campus' Sunday morning quarter
backs got together yesterday they had to
replay Saturday's game in whispers. Tiny and
his men put on the greatest show that Card
rooters have witnessed since the last Big Game,
and 60 solid minutes of delirium left the Farm
with a collective sore throat.
Remembering a supreme Saturday afternoon,
comment on a few adverse highlights seems
quite inept. After such wholehearted rooting,
who wants perfection?
But the comments are timely and may pre
vent repetition of error.
In the first place, mismanagement of the
section showed up noticeably at the time the
Alma Mater was sung and again at the end of
the game.
It seems the rooters did not want to sing the
Alma Mater while the game was in progress.
And they were right. The song should never
be sung while the team is on the field—that is
the time for yelling, not singing an anthem.
Apparently the song was forgotten at half-time,
and those in charge sandwiched it in when they
remembered it—just before the tragedy that
tied the game.
Incidentally, the Alma Mater is supposed to
be sung sitting down, with rooters' hats on. It
is the hymn only which demands the respect of
standing bareheaded.
At the end of the game, a request from the
yell leader that rooters remain in the stands
while the opponents sang their hymn would
have been the ultimate in courtesy compared
to what actually happened. As it was, U.C.L.A.'s
hymn was punctuated by martial strains from
the Stanford band, lost in the shuffle of Stanford
rooters as they started the crush for the gates.
Mismanagement was perhaps most glaring in
the hesitant performance of card stunts. Even
though they were the first stunts of the year,
the rooters were far ahead of the directors
every time. The effect of any entertainment is
marred by long pauses—the waits between
card stunts disintegrated the whole perform
ance.
Direction of the rooting section must be
speedy and precise if future between-halves
stunts are to be successful.—J. B.
