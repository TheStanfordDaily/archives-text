TWO hundred and seventy-five couples who
streamed into the U.C.L.A. dance last Satur
day night were eloquent evidence of Stanford's
interest in after the-qamc functions.

If that number of Cardinal and Bruin rooters
is willing to forego the glamour of San Fran
cisco's night - after - niteries for the somewhat
conventional attractions of the Women's Gym,
certainly a Big Game dance at a smart local
country club cannot fail to click.
Already arrangements are under way to en
gage an outstanding big-name orchestra, a ca
tering company to serve breakfast, and an ap
propriate building. Definite plans and prices
should be available by the end of the week.
Every cog in Cardinals' well-oiled machinery
is working hard to make Stanford's first off
campus Big Game dance a brilliant success.
In fact, last Saturday Messrs. Standlee, Al
bert and company, although they probably did
not realize it, added materially to the chances
for a perfect evening. For every gain they
made on the field brought Stanford closer to the
more-than-likely prospect that on Big Game
night it will be celebrating a victory.
