THE CONQUERING LEGIONS
A DOLF HITLER and Joseph Stalin seem far-re
moved from Washington. Europe's imperialistic
moves shock front pages every morning, but some of
us feel securely distant from Lithuanian temptations
and Russo-German power politics. Some of us feel
that American isolation is justified on the grounds that
here we can make democracy work, that we need not
offer American flesh to the Old World's military meat
grinder.
But very few of us feel that the hateful tragedy of
money and guns that is engaging the rest of the world
is a sign for the United States to turn conqueror. If
anyone held such an opinion he would probably be
endowed with sufficient craft to keep his tongue me
ticulously inactive. But if this advocate of an Ameri
can-Machiavellian grab-play had the indiscretion to
express his opinion, few people would credit him with
the bald-faced brass necessary to call himself a dove of
peace.

OUT AMERICA is the land of opoprtunity. We need
never despair of political freaks. Minnesota's
Senator Lundeen has had the incredible intestinal
fortitude to suggest that the United States seize Brit
ish possessions in the West Indies, while England is
thoroughly occupied on the Maginot Line. This so
called Farmer-Laborite has further strained the lim
its of an Edgar Rice Burroughs imagination by mask
ing as an advocate of strict American neutrality.
Don't repeal the arms-embargo, he warns; that would
be flagrant hostility. But by all means Stalinate Eng
land's West Indies. What can Britain do? Nazi sub
marines are keeping them busy.
Undoubtedly this ingenious little coup would re
ward us for bad war debts, as the astounding Senator
Lundeen shrewdly points out. Undoubtedly our con
quering marines would not shed a drop of blood on
their gay blue uniforms. But when our people are
straining every energy to stay clear of bomb-bursting
brawls, for an advocate of neutrality to ask our army
to commit an act of war must be just a little alarming
to the nation's psychiatrists. To imagine anyone stick
ing a knife so firmly in the back of his own brain
child, peace, requires the most wierd conception of
intellectual contortion.
That Europe is a mad fire of ruthlessness is de
plorable and menacing. But when a United States
Senator has the temerity to propose that the conquer
ing legions of force be hailed in America, the psychol
ogy of power and opportunistic injustice has festered
its way closer to our democracy than most of us
suspected.
Let's hope that Senator Lundeen has an innocent
inferiority complex, and was only trying to attract
attention.
