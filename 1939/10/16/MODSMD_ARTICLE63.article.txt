# CAMPUS OPINION
## WAIT FOR THE SLAUGHTER? 
### 
r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
A much informed campus opinion pen-orator
gave vent to his feelings Wednesday by suggesting that
the "rah-rah" boys of college would be foolish to sign
a declaration in which they refused to go to war on
foreign soil. He unhesitatingly assumes that such a
declaration would merely lower even farther in the
eyes of the "proletariat" the "already much laughed
at college student." He would have us keep our
mouths shut, "until we are in a position where it will
have some effect." Just where and when this position
may be realized he doesn't say or explain. Possibly
we should wait until our mouths are shut forever.
The fact that wc are the ones who will eventually
have to fight— not the President or Congress—fails to
give lis the right to express ourselves, according to this
serious-minded student of government. When we cry
at our representatives to keep us out of war, we bank
on the right to cry out on something far more funda
mental than a Poli Sci textbook. When our only right
to exist is jeopardized are wc to sit in the corner as
our orator would have us do? When wc seriously de
nounce the right of anyone to send us to Europe to
be killed for any reason at all we will not be laughed
at by the public of the United States.
Even if most of them dislike the "rah-rah" boys
they, nevertheless, have sons and daughters facing
the same problem of war. Further, it seems to me,
the only time to express ourselves is now—before we
have gone to war—while there is still the chance of
being heard. If we wait until mobilization begins we
won't be heard above the roar of the man-sorting
machinery.

jp'VEN granting that our President knows everything
about, national policy, as at least he himself is
convinced, it isn't going to make it easier for us to
get killed. We don't have to know anything about
international law to protest against our death at war.
No one has more right to decide whether he shall live
or die than the man who is going to live or die. It is
only little consolation that the man under 21 won't
be called until the fourth draft. Shall we die now
or two years from now by the grace of the "high
officials in the Mobilization Committee in Washington"?
In closing may I also say that "it is a great privi
lege to live in this country"—much greater than dying
in Europe. But we can best show our appreciation of
that privilege not by "keeping our mouths shut," but
by living our lives here as near to the Christian Ideal
as is possible and not by destroying our lives as sol
diers to enforce the Versailles Treaty. It is foolish to
assume that Hitler should ever try to dominate the
United States, but if the attempt is ever made, the
"rah-rah college student" of the pen-orator who wrote
in this column Wednesday will gladly take the first
line of defense.
Sincerely,
R. G. Carley
