# Man's World Gets Boost In All Feline The Women'
## 
### 
"THE WOMEN," Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's feline saga now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
Whoever said, "It's a man's world," might have seen "The Women"
before he made his momentous remark. The movie is two hours long and
there isn't a man in sight, yet every situation and almost every quip is
motivated by the wish to please^

some man. Also two hours of its un
adulterated femininity leaves one
longing for a man —any man.
Witty, malicious, and extravagant,
"The Women" is yet amusing and
entertaining. Too long, too vicious,
and overdone, the catting and elab
orate staging occasionally palls.
SHEARER SHINES
Norma Shearer gives her usual
faultless performance as the only
lady in the cast, but Rosalind Rus
sell as Sylvia, the cat, whose insa
tiable desire for gossip causes the,
slight excuse for a story, steals her
honors. The Russell dignity flies to
the winds, and the disintegration
becomes complete and beautiful in
a rough and tumble brawl in the
Nevada mountains where all the
central characters "Renovate" their
lives.
Paulette Goddard, as the chorus j
girl who knew what she wanted, how j
to get. it, and how to keep it, walks)
through the picture in a more or i
less natural manner displaying a
perfect figure to some advantage. I
Joan Crawford appeal's at a disad- 1
vantage as Crystal, the toughie who ;
came from behind Black's perfume j
counter to snatch Norma Shearer's!
spouse. Her coiffure is not flatter- j

ghastly. However, she gives an ex
ing, and her costumes are all pretty
cellent performance as the flippant,
avaricious nobody with a taste for
luxury. Her exit line would have
made an effective final shot for this
flicker.
PICTURE RATED
For good lines, good perform
ances, "The Women" is a four-bell
"flick," for an overdone representa
tion of the smart set and one of
those inevitable fashion shows, it de
serves two gongs. However, don't
miss it, even if only to be able to
pull the gags on ail your friends.—
Farrell.
