# European Unrest Affects Stanford Foreign Students
## 
### BUD AMES 
Kay Kitagawa, secretary of the A.S.S.U. International Committee, shoved
an unopened, brown envelope across the desk. He pointed first to the
postmark. "Berlin," and then to a little green sticker which read "Ab
gcreist, ohne Angabe der Adresse"—or, moved without leaving an address.
"Our club sent that letter to Gerhard Joffe, a German student who

planned to attend btantord this
year," Kitagawa explained. "He
never received it because, undoubt
edly, he has gone to the .front.
He then went on to explain that
the aim of the International Com
mittee was to make students from
foreign countries feel at home here,
and conscious of their importance as
members of the student body. The
eight active committee members,
headed by President Maygene Dun
bar, yearly write assisting and en
couraging letters to all foreign
would-be Stanford students.
After the arrival of these stu
dents on campus, the committee sets
busily about its Good-Samaritan
work, helping them to find lodgings,
to meet faculty members in their
homes, and to be invited to various
campus living groups. Probably ihe
biggest problem facing the eight
present members is the task of en
couraging these students to leave
their books and to enter into extra
curricular activities.
"As to the future, we have plan
ned, next fall, to publish a small
information pamphlet for our in
coming students which will be
much like the frosh bible to them."
Kitagawa continued. "In addition,
it is our distant hope that some day
we can establish an international
house where all of these students,
who at present use scattered lodg
ings, may live. At present the best
we can do is hold meetings and
about four parties every quarter."
Returning to the present, Kita
gawa produced from the club scrap
book several other letters recently
received from students who had
planned to attend Stanford. A letter
postmarked "Rome" read, "But, alas,
I will not be able to come to Stan
ford. Till now, we always hoped to
be able to get a visa, but, it will not
be possible."
Another letter from Holland
read. "I was informed that I have
to bring a guarantee that I can re
turn to a country after finishing my
studies in the U.S.A. Under the
present European circumstances no
country will give such a guarantee.
. . . If you are able to help me
please be so kind and do so." The
committee believes it can, but will
say no more.
All the letters revealed decided
traces of censorship in regard to
the war and the present European
situation.
"If anyone is interested in the
work our committee is doing," Kita
gawa added, "he or she is invited
to attend our get-acquainted party
for foreign and American students
next Sunday afternoon at the Kappa
house.

never received it because, undoubt
edly, he has gone to the .front.
He then went on to explain that
the aim of the International Com
mittee was to make students from
foreign countries feel at home here,
and conscious of their importance as
members of the student body. The
eight active committee members,
headed by President Maygene Dun
bar, yearly write assisting and en
couraging letters to all foreign
would-be Stanford students.
After the arrival of these stu
dents on campus, the committee sets
busily about its Good-Samaritan
work, helping them to find lodgings,
to meet faculty members in their
homes, and to be invited to various
campus living groups. Probably ihe
biggest problem facing the eight
present members is the task of en
couraging these students to leave
their books and to enter into extra
curricular activities.
"As to the future, we have plan
ned, next fall, to publish a small
information pamphlet for our in
coming students which will be
much like the frosh bible to them."
Kitagawa continued. "In addition,
it is our distant hope that some day
we can establish an international
house where all of these students,
who at present use scattered lodg
ings, may live. At present the best
we can do is hold meetings and
about four parties every quarter."
Returning to the present, Kita
gawa produced from the club scrap
book several other letters recently
received from students who had
planned to attend Stanford. A letter
postmarked "Rome" read, "But, alas,
I will not be able to come to Stan
ford. Till now, we always hoped to
be able to get a visa, but, it will not
be possible."
Another letter from Holland
read. "I was informed that I have
to bring a guarantee that I can re
turn to a country after finishing my
studies in the U.S.A. Under the
present European circumstances no
country will give such a guarantee.
. . . If you are able to help me
please be so kind and do so." The
committee believes it can, but will
say no more.
All the letters revealed decided
traces of censorship in regard to
the war and the present European
situation.
"If anyone is interested in the
work our committee is doing," Kita
gawa added, "he or she is invited
to attend our get-acquainted party
for foreign and American students
next Sunday afternoon at the Kappa
house.
Kay Kitagawa, secretary of the A.S.S.U. International Committee, shoved
an unopened, brown envelope across the desk. He pointed first to the
postmark. "Berlin," and then to a little green sticker which read "Ab

"Our club sent that letter to Gerhard Joffe, a German student who
