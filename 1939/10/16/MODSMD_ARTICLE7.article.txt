# European Unrest Affects Stanford Foreign Students

### BUD AMES 
Kay Kitagawa, secretary of the A.S.S.U. International Committee, shoved
an unopened, brown envelope across the desk. He pointed first to the
postmark. "Berlin," and then to a little green sticker which read "Ab
gcreist, ohne Angabe der Adresse"—or, moved without leaving an address.
"Our club sent that letter to Gerhard Joffe, a German student who

planned to attend btantord this
year," Kitagawa explained. "He
never received it because, undoubt

their books and to enter into extra
curricular activities.
"As to the future, we have plan
ned, next fall, to publish a small
information pamphlet for our in
coming students which will be
much like the frosh bible to them."

it is our distant hope that some day
we can establish an international

we can do is hold meetings and

Returning to the present, Kita
gawa produced from the club scrap

received from students who had
planned to attend Stanford. A letter
postmarked "Rome" read, "But, alas,
