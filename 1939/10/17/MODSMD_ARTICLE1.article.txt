### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
PLIGHTING instead of diplomatic
shadow-boxing dominated the
news for virtually the first time
since Europe's nations went to war
just 44 days ago.
Germany's gigantic war machine
struck heavy blows on land and in
the air, bombing British warships in
a daring daylight raid on Scotland
and launching an attack en the west
ern front that had the French re
treating to their own soil.

The surprise blows—Allied and
German accounts of their outcome
were naturally conflicting — fol
lowed a new wave of Nazi U-boat
terror over the week-end. The
whole crashing military drive in
dicated rather definitely that Adolf
Hitler has embarked on the "war
in earnest" that he promised would
follow the rejection of his "final"
peace proposition.
The Fuehrer warned Daladier and
Chamberlain that he'd unleash a
vicious "war to the finish" and he
seems to be living up to his threats.
And, apparently, it won't be a war
directed entirely at military objec
tives. The people of Edinburgh had
a small taste of the nature of the
offensive that may be brought to
civilian populations when a squad
ron of 12 or 14 swastika-marked
bombers swept in from the North
Sea and bombarded British war
ships in the Firth of Forth.

r |MIE Nazi bombers took the lives
of 15 officers and men aboard
the British warships and 12
wounded men were still in serious
condition late last night. The
cruiser "Southampton" was slight
ly damaged, and two small boats
were sunk before English planes
and anti-aircraft batteries drove
off the raiders in a two-hour bat-'
tie.
It began to look like real war
fare, with all the iltrise and excite
ment. But the Germans, despite a
magnificent show, really failed to do
any serious harm to their two mfljor
objectives — the important Rosyth
naval base and the famous Forth
bridge. If they'd been able to bomb
the bridge, they would have bot
tled a substantial number of Brit
ain's sea rovers.
* * *
poll about three weeks now the
French have been predicting a
strong, full-force Nazi drive on
the western front. With every lit
tle skirmish, they were sure the
Germans were "coming over."
For at least a time yesterday it
looked as if their prognostications
had finally materialized. German
legions pushed down the rugged
Moselle Valley along the border
of Luxembourg and drove the
French from German soil north of
the frontier outpost of Apach.
* * *
The British just, tabbed it as "an
other piece of Nazi propaganda,"
but Berlin insisted that the Nazis
had sunk the warship "Repulse,"
one of England's three huge battle
cruisers. They further boasted that
the same Nazi sub that torpedoed
the "Royal Oak" with a loss of 800
lives handled the job.
There were fairly definite indica
tions that a bitter naval battle might
be under way in the narrow bottle
neck of the Skagcrrak. If that
means anything to you, it's the en
trance to the Baltic from the North
Sea. The Germans are attempting
valiantly to break the choking grip
of a British blockade.
Cannon flashes and the red glow
of a burning ship were seen at dusk
off the coast and skies were criss
crossed by searchlights believed to
belong to patrolling battleships.
