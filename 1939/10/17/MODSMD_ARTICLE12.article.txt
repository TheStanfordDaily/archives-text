# New Stern Lab Hums With Research Activity

### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
Like a modern symphony of sharps and flats—only in this case it's sharp
corners and flat surfaces—the interior of the new Lucie Stern Research
Laboratory is beginning to hum with steady activity.
011 the first floor, the rats and mice scuttle about their wire cages and
drink from their water bottles; on the second floor the autoclave clucks

and hisses; and on the third floor,
boxes hum quietly. All this is really j

and Walter Schilling on cancer.
All three floors are still somewhat |

The building's new-type windows,
which stretch in an unbroken line
around the four sides of each floor, j
are almost too efficient, the occu
pants report. Many of the offices and
labs have too much light, especially
when the white walls of a near-by
building glare through their opaque
panes, so Venetian blinds are being
installed.
Every doctor and his secretary
have their separate offices and labs, j
the medical men having the privilege j
of locking themselves in when wres
tling with the intricacies of research
problems. Even the room tempera
tures can be controlled to a large
extent by wall thermostats, which
pump in warm or cool air at the
occupant's desire. Once set, the room
maintains the desired temperature
automatically.
Keynoting the adaptability of the
new laboratory, all the partitions can
be readily moved to almost any de
