# New Stern Lab Hums With Research Activity
## 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
Like a modern symphony of sharps and flats—only in this case it's sharp
corners and flat surfaces—the interior of the new Lucie Stern Research
Laboratory is beginning to hum with steady activity.
011 the first floor, the rats and mice scuttle about their wire cages and
drink from their water bottles; on the second floor the autoclave clucks

and hisses; and on the third floor,
boxes hum quietly. All this is really j
only the visible activity that stems j
from the research work of Drs. Har
old Faber on poliomyelitis; John
Miller on whooping cough; C. F.
Fluhmann on the endocrine glands; |
and Walter Schilling on cancer.
All three floors are still somewhat |
bare and severe, their uniform pis
tachio - green coloring forming a
strange contrast with the well-worn
golden oak desks and the stacks of
oft-thumbed books seemingly lean
ing against one another for comfort t
in the immense ceiling-high closets.
LIGHT OVERABUNDANT
The building's new-type windows,
which stretch in an unbroken line
around the four sides of each floor, j
are almost too efficient, the occu
pants report. Many of the offices and
labs have too much light, especially
when the white walls of a near-by
building glare through their opaque
panes, so Venetian blinds are being
installed.
Every doctor and his secretary
have their separate offices and labs, j
the medical men having the privilege j
of locking themselves in when wres
tling with the intricacies of research
problems. Even the room tempera
tures can be controlled to a large
extent by wall thermostats, which
pump in warm or cool air at the
occupant's desire. Once set, the room
maintains the desired temperature
automatically.
Keynoting the adaptability of the
new laboratory, all the partitions can
be readily moved to almost any de
sired position; thus, offices or labs
may be made smaller or larger, and
single rooms converted into suites
to suit the demands of the staff.
Heating and water pipes are all
readily accessible too. crisscrossing
near the ceilings or hugging the
walls like machine-age spider webs.
Perhaps the most bustle is to be
found on the first floor, where the
Department of Preventive Medicine,
under Dr. C. E. Smith, is seeking a
cui;e for the .strange "San Joaquin
Valley fever," thought to be trans
mitted by an alkali dust peculiar to
that location. The germ, which af
fects both men and animals, has been
isolated. Its symptoms are similar to
influenza combined with pleurisy,
and when the patient is given a skin
test, tuberculosis symptoms some
times appear.
RATS USED IN LAB
On this floor too are the animal
rooms, in which approximately a
thousand white rats and mice are
used for cancer research. The ro
dents are bred with others afflicted
with tumors, and after a short life
time are dissected and examined.
To the layman, the sharp, acrid
smell of these rooms is one of the
strongest memories of the place.
The .second floor, turned over to
the pediatrics department, is preg
nant with research problems, al
though some of its larger rooms have
not been assigned yet. This is also
true for the third floor, devoted to
obstetrics and gynecology.
The Daily's observer is immensely
indebted to several obliging depart
ment secretaries, especially Mrs.
Ruth and Mrs. Eileen Allred, both
of whom were liberal of their time
to show him through.

LIGHT OVERABUNDANT
The building's new-type windows,
which stretch in an unbroken line
around the four sides of each floor, j
are almost too efficient, the occu
pants report. Many of the offices and
labs have too much light, especially
when the white walls of a near-by
building glare through their opaque
panes, so Venetian blinds are being
installed.
Every doctor and his secretary
have their separate offices and labs, j
the medical men having the privilege j
of locking themselves in when wres
tling with the intricacies of research
problems. Even the room tempera
tures can be controlled to a large
extent by wall thermostats, which
pump in warm or cool air at the
occupant's desire. Once set, the room
maintains the desired temperature
automatically.
Keynoting the adaptability of the
new laboratory, all the partitions can
be readily moved to almost any de
sired position; thus, offices or labs
may be made smaller or larger, and
single rooms converted into suites
to suit the demands of the staff.
Heating and water pipes are all
readily accessible too. crisscrossing
near the ceilings or hugging the
walls like machine-age spider webs.
Perhaps the most bustle is to be
found on the first floor, where the
Department of Preventive Medicine,
under Dr. C. E. Smith, is seeking a
cui;e for the .strange "San Joaquin
Valley fever," thought to be trans
mitted by an alkali dust peculiar to
that location. The germ, which af
fects both men and animals, has been
isolated. Its symptoms are similar to
influenza combined with pleurisy,
and when the patient is given a skin
test, tuberculosis symptoms some
times appear.
RATS USED IN LAB
On this floor too are the animal
rooms, in which approximately a
thousand white rats and mice are
used for cancer research. The ro
dents are bred with others afflicted
with tumors, and after a short life
time are dissected and examined.
To the layman, the sharp, acrid
smell of these rooms is one of the
strongest memories of the place.
The .second floor, turned over to
the pediatrics department, is preg
nant with research problems, al
though some of its larger rooms have
not been assigned yet. This is also
true for the third floor, devoted to
obstetrics and gynecology.
The Daily's observer is immensely
indebted to several obliging depart
ment secretaries, especially Mrs.
Ruth and Mrs. Eileen Allred, both
of whom were liberal of their time
to show him through.
Like a modern symphony of sharps and flats—only in this case it's sharp
corners and flat surfaces—the interior of the new Lucie Stern Research
Laboratory is beginning to hum with steady activity.
011 the first floor, the rats and mice scuttle about their wire cages and
drink from their water bottles; on the second floor the autoclave clucks

and hisses; and on the third floor,
boxes hum quietly. All this is really j
only the visible activity that stems j
from the research work of Drs. Har
old Faber on poliomyelitis; John
Miller on whooping cough; C. F.
Fluhmann on the endocrine glands; |
and Walter Schilling on cancer.
All three floors are still somewhat |
bare and severe, their uniform pis
tachio - green coloring forming a
strange contrast with the well-worn
golden oak desks and the stacks of
oft-thumbed books seemingly lean
