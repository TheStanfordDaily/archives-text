"This year, the Chappie will give
the reader a full 15 cents worth of
entertainment, with novel covers,
new features, and most important of
all no 'cure-alls' of world evils,"
promises Old Boy Marco Thorne.
Tile Chappie will go on sale to
morrow and will be offered by the
usual bevy of Chappie salesgirls.
Subscriptions for the rest of the
year may be bought from the sales
girls. The price is $1.03 and will in
clude the first issue.
An entirely new sort of cover and
type face has also been promised by
Thorne.
