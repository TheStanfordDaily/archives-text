# Governor Olson Frees Billings
## Action Comes After Supreme Court O.K. 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16 (UP).â€”
Governor Culbert L. Olson late today
ordered immediate freedom for War
ren K. Billings, convicted of second
degree murder in the 15)16 Prepared
ness Day bombings.
The Governor commuted the
famed prisoner's life sentence to time
served, meaning Billings' term now
is at an end.
The Governor acted immediately
after being informed the California
Supreme Court had approved such a
move.
WARDEN HEARS NOTHING
At Folsom prison Warden Clyde
Plummer said he had not been in
formed officially of the Governor's
action, although he had "heard" the
Supreme Court had recommended
such action.
Plummer explained that it would
be practically impossible for Billings
to leave the prison tonight. He said
he could not release the prisoner
until he received the official papci's
in the case, which probably would
not be before tomorrow morning at
the earliest..
FOLLOWS MOONEY PARDON
The action came eight months after
Olson pardoned Thomas J. Mooney,
convicted in the same case.
The Governor, under the state
constitution, could not pardon Bil
lings without approval of the state
Supreme Court, as the Folsom prison
watchmaker was a "two-time loser."
Since his release from San Quen
tin prison in January, Mooney has
toured the country seeking to gain
support for the move to free Billings.
