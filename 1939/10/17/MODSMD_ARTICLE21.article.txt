### 
LONDON, Tuesday, Oct. 17 (UP). —(ierman war planes bombed British
warships in the Firth of Forth at Edinburgh, killing and wounding at leafct
52 men and slightly damaging the cruiser Southampton, in a bold daylight
raid yesterday. Nazi bombs fell on British soil for the first time since the
outbreak of the war.
After a furious battle in which at least four of the 12 or 11 (ierman
bombers were shot down along the Scottish coast the attackers were beaten

off by British planes and anti-air
craft guns.
(The German high command an
nounced in Berlin that two British
cruisers were hit by heavy bomlis
and that the German raiders and
the British air force each lost two
planes.)
The Air Ministry said the Royal
Air Force suffered no casualties.
Early today the Admiralty an
nounced that 15 men, three officers
and 12 ratings, were killed aboard
the attacked warships lying in the
Firth of Forth near the Rosyth navnl
base.
CIVILIANS INJURED
Thirty-five seamen were wounded,
12 of them seriously, it was stated.
Two civilians were injured by
machine-gun bullets of the battling
planes, a hou.se painter shot in the
side and another man wounded in
the leg.
It was understood that most of the
dead and wounded were those man
ning anti-aircraft guns on the decks
of the warships while the German
planes bombed and then swept down
as low as 300 feet and machine
gunned the decks.
BRITISH SHIPS SINK
The British Admiralty and Air
Ministry admitted casualties aboard
the 9,100 - ton Southampton, the
cruiser Edinburgh and Ihe destroyer
Mohawk, and said an admiral's barge
and a light tender were sunk by the
Nazi bombs.
Today's raid marked the first time
since the start of the war on Sept. 3
that German bombs had fallen on
British soil.
German reconnaissance planes
scouted the area twice before the
bombers came over and dive
bombed the famous Forth bridge and
the British warships lying not far
from it and then fought a bitter
aerial battle with British planes.
GERMAN PLANE SHOT
One of the British cruisers nar
rowly escaped when a German plane
dropped a bomb near it, then swept
down and machine-gunned the Brit
ish warship's decks from a height of
only 500 feet.
One of the four German planes was
shot down by the anti-aircraft guns
of a cruiser, an eye-witness said.
Another Nazi plane raked the
decks of the anchored cruisers with
machine-gun fire from 300 feet.
The communique of the Admiralty
and air ministry said that R.A.F.
planes intercepted the raiders off the
Isle of May at the entrance to the
Firth of Forth at 2:30 p.m. and that
two of the enemy planes, driven j
! down to within a few feet of the •
water's surface in dog-fighting, were j
| chased back out to sea.
Ten minutes later, it was said, an i
i enemy plane was shot down over
; Dalkeith and fell in flames into the
i sea. Within an hour another sharp
i combat was fought over Crail and
i another German plane fell into the
| sea. A third German plane was de
i stroyed by pursuing British planes.
Residents standing in the streets,
! thinking it was a "practice" session,
j realized first that an actual raid was
j under way when they saw white
j puffs of smoke burst around the
planes. Then they saw British flights
in hot pursuit of the Germans, ma
chine guns rattling.
NAZIS AIM AT BRIDGE
Watchers on both sides of the
' Forth saw the German bombers
I make desperate efforts to bomb the
bridge. The Forth bridge, one of
the largest in the world, is a mile
and a half long, 450 feet high and has
t two great center spans carrying a
; double-line railroad.
j "Driven off by heavy fire, the
I Germans returned time and again,
j but although their bombs caused
! huge spouts there was no damage
i done," one witness said.
"We saw three or four airplanes
| drop about 10 bombs but all of them 1
hit the water," another said.
"Bombs dropped near the bridge
but it was not hit, because we saw
! trains passing over it soon after-
I ward."
