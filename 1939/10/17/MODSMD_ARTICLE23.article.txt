# French Repulse New German Attack on Luxembourg Line
## Casualties Mount as Nazi Drive Hits French Soil for First Time 
### 
I'AKIS, Oct. Hi (UP). â€”German fortes attacked down the Moselle Val
ley near Luxembourg today, causing the French to retreat to their own
soil for a time, but, according to French sources, at a cost of 500 to 1,000
casualties and the loss of 20 German tanks blown up by mines.
The attack, along a four-mile front east of the Moselle River, was on
a salient protecting the Siegfried Line forts at Trier, which French military

experts have considered to be prob-,
ably the line's weakest point, since
portions of the Nazi defense works
there were uncompleted when the
war began. French positions have
been threatening the line there.
French sources said they had been
anticipating such an assault and
withdrew troops from certain ad
vanced positions, leaving behind a
great number of mines which they
blew up from surveillance points far
in the rear.
The mines were exploded as Ger
man tanks, followed by several hun
dred grenadiers and armored troops
carrying machine guns and wearing

steel vests and visors, advanced over
the area, according to French in
formants.
The French said scores of Ger
mans were killed by the mines and
many tanks were destroyed.
Then the French opened up a ter
rific barrage of 73-, 105- and 155-
millimeter field pieces, principally
from their Maginot Line fortresses
atop Kirscherberg Hill. This was
said to have "chopped the Germans
to pieces, wholly halting the attack
and forcing the Germans to flee in
disorder."
NAZIS HOLD LINES
Some sources said the Germans
retreated to the lines from which
they started, but the official French
army Communique No. 86 indicated
that the Germans had regained a
French salient four miles deep along
the Borg ridge, including the strate
gically important Borg Foiest, scene
of a French success in a recent battle
of tanks.
The Germans occupied, but were
driven from, Schneeberg Hill, 1,400-
foot prominence just within German
territory and towering above the
French village of Apach to which the
Germans had advanced before the
barrage.
