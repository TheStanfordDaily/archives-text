# Pittman Drops Credit Section In Embargo Bill
## Strict Cash-Carry Policy Is Accepted By Administration 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 (UP).—
Chairman Key Pittman of the Sen- >
ate Foreign Relations Committee to
day abandoned the fiO-day credit
provision of the neutrality revision 1
bill in favor of a strict cash-and
carry policy with regard to pur- !
chases of American products by Eu
ropean belligerents.
The credit clause was one of the
most disputed proposals in the bill.
It would have empowered President
Roosevelt to authorize short - term
credits under certain conditions.
Powerful groups in both parties op
posed it on the ground it would cir
cumvent the Johnson Act which bans
American loans to war-debt de
faulting nations and might involve
this country in the war.
SURRENDER ANNOUNCED
When the Senate began the third
week of general debate on the legis
lation, Pittman announced the Ad
ministration's surrender. He offered
an amendment eliminating the credit
section. In an accompanying state
ment he said he did so to "avoid any
confusion or misunderstanding."
It always was the intention of his
committee, he said, to require settle
ment in cash or its equivalent as
defined by Attorney General Frank
Murphy.
CLINCH ATTEMPTED
Observers saw in the move an at
tempt to clinch the votes of some
Senators who, while favoring repeal
of the embargo on arms and ammu
nition, demanded such action be ac
companied by adoption of a strong
cash-and-carry plan, and an effort
to eliminate as many controversial
proposals as possible in oi'der to
hasten a final vote.
Majority Leader Albcn W. Bark
ley, D., Ky., would like to conclude
general debate this week and start
voting on amendments next Mon
day. The isolationists said after a
meeting today, however, the talk
fest would continue for another 10
days or two weeks. They said they
were not filibustering and had no
intention of doing so unless the lead
! ership tries to "crack down."
