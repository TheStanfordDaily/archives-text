side dope on Stanford's future
football stars in today's Sideline
Slants.)

This year they are apprentices at
the trade of football playing under
the tutelage of Coach Harry Ship
key. Next season they are masters
of the trade, and definitely assets to
the Big Red Machine.
I'm speaking of none other than
Stanford's talented bunch of fresh
man gridsters. Here's a short sketch
of 11 of the most prominent mem
bers of the squad. Making any real
distinction between these and the
rest of the squad is impossible for
(he strongest link in this year's team
is its terrific wealth of material and
capable reserves.
HANK NORBURG was all-P.A.L.
end for three years, the best end
prospect to hit the school in years—
big, fast, willing, and capable—in
jured now, but will be ready for Cal.
ED STAMM was All-City end in
Portland—also star shot putter—tall
and lanky—a pass catcher and de
fensive giant.
BRUNO BANDUCCI, towering
tackle from Richmond-—whale of a
defensive man — hard charger and
dependable.
GEORGE ROBINSON. Banducci's
running mate at tackle—hails from
Taeoma, Wash.—best offensive line
man.
DICK PALMER, talented guard
from Oklahoma—natural ball play
er—favors tough going—best at
diagnosing plays on defense.
ED McCAIN is another "Okie"
guard — stocky, rugged — squad's
hardest worker—built for action.
BILL MANNON is the big center
fronvLos Angeles—bothered now by
weak ankles—when in top shape is
a crunching line backer and also
opens the holes when the Papooses
are on the march.
CHARLES TAYLOR is red head
ed quarterback from San Jose —
was all-P.A.L.—bone crunching ball
carrier—picks up those first downs
on quarterback sneaks — other line
backer.
AL COLE, left half from Los An
geles, is the team's most versatile
player — tricky runner — accurate
passer—fair weather punter and
safety man—cool under fire—small
package of dynamite—signal caller.
ERIC ARMSTRONG from Port
land is a mighty shifty right half—
sparkles on reverses and on the re
ceiving end of pass plays—fastest
man on squad.
MILT VUCINICH of Lowell High
in San Francisco—brightest star to
come out of the city in years—real
boomer on drifter plays.

the Big Red Machine.
I'm speaking of none other than
Stanford's talented bunch of fresh
man gridsters. Here's a short sketch
of 11 of the most prominent mem
bers of the squad. Making any real
distinction between these and the
rest of the squad is impossible for
(he strongest link in this year's team
is its terrific wealth of material and
capable reserves.
HANK NORBURG was all-P.A.L.
end for three years, the best end
prospect to hit the school in years—
big, fast, willing, and capable—in
jured now, but will be ready for Cal.
ED STAMM was All-City end in
Portland—also star shot putter—tall
and lanky—a pass catcher and de
fensive giant.
BRUNO BANDUCCI, towering
tackle from Richmond-—whale of a
defensive man — hard charger and
dependable.
GEORGE ROBINSON. Banducci's
running mate at tackle—hails from
Taeoma, Wash.—best offensive line
man.
DICK PALMER, talented guard
from Oklahoma—natural ball play
er—favors tough going—best at
diagnosing plays on defense.
ED McCAIN is another "Okie"
guard — stocky, rugged — squad's
hardest worker—built for action.
BILL MANNON is the big center
fronvLos Angeles—bothered now by
weak ankles—when in top shape is
a crunching line backer and also
opens the holes when the Papooses
are on the march.
CHARLES TAYLOR is red head
ed quarterback from San Jose —
was all-P.A.L.—bone crunching ball
carrier—picks up those first downs
on quarterback sneaks — other line
backer.
AL COLE, left half from Los An
geles, is the team's most versatile
player — tricky runner — accurate
passer—fair weather punter and
safety man—cool under fire—small
package of dynamite—signal caller.
ERIC ARMSTRONG from Port
land is a mighty shifty right half—
sparkles on reverses and on the re
ceiving end of pass plays—fastest
man on squad.
MILT VUCINICH of Lowell High
in San Francisco—brightest star to
come out of the city in years—real
boomer on drifter plays.
(Editor's Note. — Chuck Smith,
frosli grid reporter, gives the in
side dope on Stanford's future
football stars in today's Sideline
Slants.)

This year they are apprentices at
the trade of football playing under
the tutelage of Coach Harry Ship
key. Next season they are masters
of the trade, and definitely assets to
the Big Red Machine.
