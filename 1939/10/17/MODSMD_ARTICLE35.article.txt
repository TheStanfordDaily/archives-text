# Undefeated Card Waterdogs Paddle Alter Championship
## 
### 
Stanford seems headed straight for a conference championship. No,
not football, water polo.
Unlike the grid squad, the Indian mermen started off with a bang by
beating San Jose State to the tune of six to (wo. Last week-end the highly

California team fell before
] the Spartans six to four, which, ac
j cording to the cold dope, should
make the Cards just six goals better
; than the Golden Bears.
BEARS RATED TOUGH
Then last week the scalp of the
strong Athens Club was brought
I back to the Farm. With the Golden
Bears rated as the toughest squad
on the schedule, it looks like clear
swimming for the Indians from
now on.
Coach Nort Thornton is convinced
j that he has one of the best squads
in Stanford history. He claims that
Bill Bleeker is" as good as Johnny
Lamb, sensational star of last sea
son, who was a unanimous all-con
ference choice three years running.
DEFENSIVE SMOOTH
Moreover, this year's squad has an
outstanding offensive combination in
Captain Bob Plate, Bob Allen, Dave
Nottage, and Bleeker, as well as an
exceptionally smooth defensive line
up of Frank Dowling, Dick Hoover,
and Ted Moreno.
Next Saturday the team meets the
U.C.L.A. Bruins, who claim to have
the best team in their history. But
as Coach Thornton puts it, "We're
pretty good, too."
