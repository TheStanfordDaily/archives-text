# Basketball Men Drill Outdoors
## Squad Goes to Work For Big Year Ahead 
### 
Spending all their time on condi
tioning, Stanford's 40-odd basket
ball aspirants have been touring the !
soccer field three times a week for
the past two weeks. Coach Everett
Dean has sent his charges around the
field on an average of six times each
evening of practice.
The cage men run sprint laps, jog
laps, zig-zag laps and even play leap ,
frog while making the round. This
last method is a strenuous form of ;
exercise when done in such an ex- j
cess, especially good for developing j
the jumping muscles in the calf of ,
the leg.

However, yesterday, for the first |
time, the basketballs were hauled out j
and the cagemen went through some i
passing drills after their warmup !
around the soccer field.
There was lots of tipping and quick j
passing in order to get sensitive fin- ;
ger muscles back into shape.
TRIP IS INCENTIVE
Now that the Dean system of bas
ketball has had a year to establish
itself at Stanford, fans look forward i
to a banner year. With four return- j
ing lettermen, plenty of reserves I
from last year's squad and a wealth !
of junior college transfers, Dean will
have plenty of material to work i
with.
And with a 7,000-mile barnstorm
ing tour through the East during
Christmas time for 12 squad mem
bers as an incentive, the scramble j
for positions will be fast and furious. '
