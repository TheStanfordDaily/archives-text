## Monday No Longer Blue As Indians Alter Attack Thornhill Reinstates Frankie Albert In Only Change of Big Red Machine 
### JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor 
Monthly afternoon was spent a little differently yesterday.
Instead of five radical changes in line-up as happened one week ago,
Tiny Thornhill made only one—and that was a re-promotion for Frankie
! Albert to the first string.
Instead of working over and over again on old plays which had failed

,to click in the previous Saturday's :
games (Oregon State and Oregon
University), Tiny was trying some
thing new for his gridders in the
way of an offensive attack.
Instead of looking forward to an
other game on Saturday, Tiny's grid- |
ders were practicing for a game two
weeks hence—that with the Wash
ington Huskies at Seattle.
The U.C.L.A. game and its 14-14
tie left the Indians in their best
spirit, of the season. Only one grid- I
der was on the shelf over the week- j
end and that was Dave Patterson, j
who in his third game of varsity j
competition played GO minutes of j
get-up-and-go football against the ;
Bruins. The right guard appeared in !
sweat clothes favoring a bruised 1
shoulder, but lined up with the var- J
sity which ran through Tiny's new j
plays.
Hamp Pool and Gene Coldiron j
alternated at quarterback so that it j
appears that it'll be a close fight i
between the tv/o as to who will start
the rest of the games this season. J
Coldii'on's brilliant playing after re- j
placing the inexperienced Pool in j
the Uclan tilt highlighted the Cards'!
backfield defense.
