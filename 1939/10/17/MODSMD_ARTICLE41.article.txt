. . not more than 20 days and not less than
5 days before the first Tuesday after the first
Monday in November."
If he hasn't done it already, every Stanford
student who is a registered voter in his home
town should circle tomorrow's date, October 18,
on his calendar and should draw another ring
around November 2. For between these two
dates he must apply to the registrar of voters
in his community for an absentee ballot if he
is going to vote in the coming election.
In most years when there are no presidential
candidates on the ballot the first Tuesday in
November slides by with very few students tak
ing the trouble to cast their absentee votes.
Either the issues do not interest them, or they
are just too busy to bother.
However, this November 7 the people of
California are going to vote on an amendment
to their constitution which, if passed, will affect
directly all the members of the Stanford stu
dent body. For the "$3O Every Thursday" plan
carries with it the seeds of financial ruin for
their own families, their own university, and
their own state.
One of its provisions, the gross income tax,
would prove so vicious a burden and would
pyramid so high in certain cases that many of
California's leading concerns, firms that employ
thousands, would be forced out of business.
Another, the section creating an Administrator
for the plan, would set up a department com
pletely independent of the present state govern
ment â€”with powers so extensive that they
would be even more dangerous in practice than
they appear in the pages of a political science
text.
Success for the "$3O Every Thursday" would
result in California's economic secession from
the Union. Establishing a new monetary and
banking system, the amendment would force
local companies out of interstate commerce be
cause "Ham and Eggs" warrants would not be
accepted as legal tender outside of the state.
And there lies tlfe thread that will support
California's only hope in case the old age pen
sion bill goes through.
The government of the United States is one
of delegated powers, and one of the privileges
specifically denied the states is to make any
thing but federal coinage legal tender. It is
possible that the Supreme Court might judge
the amendment a violation of this provision if
the lack - wits and lame - brains that have mi
grated to Southern California succeed in selling
the state their favorite measure.
The fundamental fault of the "S3O Every
Thursday" bill is that it attempts to place in
the hands of the fumbling voter technical mat
ters that need the attention of experts. Those
who are supporting the measure are people who
have nothing to lose by a change, no matter
how disastrous it may be to the rest of the
population.
It is the responsibility of all intelligent, clear
sighted men and women to campaign actively
against "Ham and Eggs." Their sitting at home
and smugly thinking how foolish the idea is will
contribute nothing toward defeating the bill.
Stanford men and women of voting age are
credited with more-than-average intelligence.
Therefore, they share this responsibility of help
ing to crush the screw-ball amendment.
A three-cent stamp, an envelope, and a short
letter to the home-town registrar of voters is the
minimum requirement for any Stanford student
to prove he is a loyal citizen of California.
