IN spite of the fact that there will be no foot
ball game at Stanford this week, there will
be a little campus excitement for nine Farm
men and women and, presumably, five frater
nities, one sorority, one eating club, and a few
assorted Hall men and women.
From these nine persons (seven of them men,
two women), the campus today will choose a
graduate member on Ex Committee, and a mem
ber of Men's Council in a special election called
because holders of those two offices did not
return to school this quarter.
While the two original officers sifted through
carefully planned caucuses before reaching Ex
Committee and Men's Council positions, tomor
row's two victors will sneak in through the back
door, so to speak, for a four months' period of
helping to decide Stanford's legislative and
judiciary problems.
There is no Hall-Row dispute in this election.
There have been no Campus Opinions slander
ing any of the candidates. No one seems to be
telling anyone else how to vote. There are
simply six men up for the Men's Council job,
and two women and a man running for Ex Com
mittee.
So carry your student body cards to class
today.—D. J.
