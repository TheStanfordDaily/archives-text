NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN

'T'HREE news items astounding in their proper se
quence, have not appeared in the public prints:
(1) There is an election today. (2) The election has
not been preceded with campus-wide caucuses. (3)
The campus is Stanford University. But the reason for
our caucusless election allays fears that the Farm
is changing": Stanford political cliques do not con
sider today's special election important.
Having breathed a sigh of relief that our staunch
imitations of big-time cigar-chewers are not asleep on
the job, we might well utilize the lull to cast a critical
eye on that most be-stenched of political odors: the
caucus. Perhaps the outstanding thing about Stan
ford's caucus system is its singular lack of cham
pions, in spite of its apparent strength. There is a
real indictment of Stanford students: we don't even
have the normal, wholesome hypocrisy to believe in a
bad system when we don't have a good one.

TVfOST informed students know and admit that Stan
ford's caucuses are more corrupt than an I-hold
the-mortgage villain, and scarcely more subtle. And
yet there are few concerted moves to adopt a more
representative type of self-government. That is partly
because the politically ambitious often feel that they
must "play ball" with- "the boys" to get anywhere.
And partly it is because of the plain fact that we
are all lazy. We don't like to think much. We do not
worry ourselves into crossing our bridges before we
get to them—obviously. But further than that, we
usually let our bridges rot before we cross them.
But our inertia is not the last and binding word.
Most of us would like to do the right thing, "if people
would only let us." Most campus leaders would prob
ably welcome a change in our petty system of vote
trading and living-group coercion. But the road to
crooked political deals, like the traditional path to
hell, is paved with good intentions. In this case the
"bad intentions" aren't even very enjoyable.
The direct primary was substituted for the caucus
in national politics a long time ago. And while direct
primaries are certainly no haven for angels—espe
cially angels without cigars—it must be admitted that
the elimination of the caucus was an improvement.
Stanford is ahead of the rest of the country in many
ways. Babies, for instance, don't have to take the apti
tude test before they can be born. And there is no
reason for the Farm to lag behind in the evolution of
the caucus.
Stanford has a big election again in February. At that
time we could enact dii-ect primaries. But February
gives us so much time to think about it that we can
easily get started by March.
