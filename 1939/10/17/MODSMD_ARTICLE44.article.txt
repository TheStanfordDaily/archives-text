HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
According to a tradition at Stanford, we are ex
pected to remain standing with our hats off and with
out the band playing, while our opponents sing their
Alma Mater after a football game.
This small symbol of courtesy toward a visiting
school was sadly lacking Saturday. We sang our
Hymn, then left noisily while U.C.L.A. sang their Alma
Mater. It looked bad.
Perhaps it would help if Johnny Seamens were to
remind the rooters next time to wait an extra two or
three minutes, as a friendly gesture.
Sincerely,
Woody Miller

LITTLE MAN, SO WHAT?
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
How does anyone expect us short people to sec
any part of the bonfire if it is built on a level plain?
We'll probably go home with strained necks and sore
eyes from looking at people's suspenders. If the Roble
gals get hysteria over such trifles it's about time they
were found out before they go on to higher education.

FOR TRADITION'S SAKE
EDITOR, SIR:
What is Stanford coming to? Is there to be no
more tradition for Stanford men and women to live
up to? Where is the mud fight, where is the spirit
that once recaptured the Stanford Axe, and why must
Stanford submit to straight-laced emasculation of
our famous traditions?
Why not bequeath the historic Stanford bonfire to
California, a school which still retains some spark of
spirit and tradition. With this done away with, we can
discard what little remains of our traditions, and
settle down to a life of Toyon smokers, Roble teas,
Presidential receptions, and W.C.T.U. revival meetings.
Is it too radical for us to be known as the Stanford
REDS' What is to become of us if Stanford women. !

gals get hysteria over such trifles it's about time they
were found out before they go on to higher education.

FOR TRADITION'S SAKE
EDITOR, SIR:
What is Stanford coming to? Is there to be no
more tradition for Stanford men and women to live
up to? Where is the mud fight, where is the spirit
that once recaptured the Stanford Axe, and why must
Stanford submit to straight-laced emasculation of
our famous traditions?
Why not bequeath the historic Stanford bonfire to
California, a school which still retains some spark of
spirit and tradition. With this done away with, we can
discard what little remains of our traditions, and
settle down to a life of Toyon smokers, Roble teas,
Presidential receptions, and W.C.T.U. revival meetings.
Is it too radical for us to be known as the Stanford
REDS' What is to become of us if Stanford women. !
the future mothers of America, cannot stand a little
bonfire in their back yard, how can they be expected
to keep the home fires burning 0

STANFORD GENTLEMEN
HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
According to a tradition at Stanford, we are ex
pected to remain standing with our hats off and with
out the band playing, while our opponents sing their
Alma Mater after a football game.
This small symbol of courtesy toward a visiting
school was sadly lacking Saturday. We sang our
Hymn, then left noisily while U.C.L.A. sang their Alma
Mater. It looked bad.
Perhaps it would help if Johnny Seamens were to
remind the rooters next time to wait an extra two or
three minutes, as a friendly gesture.
Sincerely,
Woody Miller

LITTLE MAN, SO WHAT?
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
How does anyone expect us short people to sec
any part of the bonfire if it is built on a level plain?
We'll probably go home with strained necks and sore
eyes from looking at people's suspenders. If the Roble
gals get hysteria over such trifles it's about time they
were found out before they go on to higher education.
