# Gunther's 'Inside Asia' Termed Fine Reporting
## 
### 
"INSIDE ASIA," by John Gunther.
On the dedicatory page of "Inside Asia" is printed, "This book is for
Johnny, who suggested it." Just who "Johnny" is, is not clear, but he
certainly started something. For, in the book, John Gunther covers, and
covers completely, Japan, Manchukuo. Asiatic Russia. China, the Philip-

• pines, Malaya, Siam, India, Iran, I
Iraq, Ihe Middle East, the Nearj
East, and Palestine.
Obviously "Inside Asia" is a com- ■
j panion volume to Gunther's well
known "Inside Europe," and he has
followed the same method of ex
position in both books; that is, deal
ing with nations in relation to the j
i personalities who govern them. It is]
; natural that Gunther would follow
this plan of writing since he is a
j reporter, accustomed to dealing
. with particulars rather than gen- !
! eralities, the colorful fact rather
I than the nebulous theory.
Over half of "Inside Asia's" 575:
pages is devoted to Japan. But this I
| in no way affects the completeness I
of the chapters on the other coun- j
tries. Gunther, frankly, did not- like j
the Japanese. Perhaps he colored
j his writing unconsciously, because j
! of his dislike, but still he manages
jto explain the Japanese political)
j system, complicated by a strange j
combination of modern efficiency
, and age-old tradition, so that it is
| clear to the layman, a difficult task,
j In fact, he makes the whole of the
mysterious Eastern social structure
! as nearly comprehensible as it can I
jbe made to the literal - minded
i westerner.
1 "Inside Asia" is a magnificent job
J done by a man who is considered
j one of the best foreign reporters of
■ our time. That "Johnny" suggested
! his idea for a book to the right
i man.—Nowell
