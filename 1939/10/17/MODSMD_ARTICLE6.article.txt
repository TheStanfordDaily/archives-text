# Hand to Lead Mystery Nine On Field Day
## Professors Groom For Student-Faculty Contests Tomorrow 
### 
Shades of once - hopeful big
leaguers will drift across the intra
mural field tomorrow night when
the secretive "mystery" baseball
team crosses bats with a picked stu
dent nine in one of the featured bat
tles of the third Student - Faculty
Field Day.
With its identity kept a deep se
ci'et, the personnel of the team is
unknown even to Field Day Co
chairmen Powers Cameron and Art
Gore, except for the fact that the
team will be headed by Player-man
ager Dr. Harold C. Hand.
Rumor has it that the team will
be sparked by Dean of Men John
Bunn, who will head an impressive
list of faculty diamond experts.
THREE-LEGGED RACE
Opening whistle for the baseball
classic will blast shortly after the
opening of the Field Day at 3:30
o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Sharing top billing with the soft
ball game will be the three-legged
race in which A.S.S.U. President
Ken Cuthbertson will team with
Professor Leland Chapin in an at
tempt to hold the crown they
earned last year in a heated battle.
Dean Bunn is rumored to be
practicing in this event with a new
partner. Two years ago he finished
first in partnership with Beebs Lee.
The Lee - Bunn combination also
crossed the finish line first last year
but were disqualified for jumping
the gun.
POLL TAKEN
At a late hour last night results
of a poll taken of campus eating
clubs, dormitories and the Row re
vealed the approximate number of
people planning to attend the Field
Day.
The poll was held during the din
ner hour last night. Tickets for the
buffet supper to be served tomor
row evening at 5:30 o'clock werq
also distributed at that time.
Thirty freshman women, selected
by Anne Townsend, will serve the
dinner, Cameron said.
Other featured events on the pro
gram for tomorrow evening include
the traditional battle between the
Encina frosh and their Western Civ
professorsâ€”this time on the volley
ball court.
