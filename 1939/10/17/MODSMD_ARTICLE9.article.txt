# 'Divide' to Star Howe, Regnery
## Farm Production Will Open on Friday 
### 
"The Great Divide," which will be
presented on Friday and Saturday
nights in Memorial Hall, is a com
edy-drama built around the love of
two totally different people.
Ruth, played by Betty Howe, is a
cultured Eastern girl who is forced
into a marriage with Stephen Ghent,
played by Dave Regnery, an un
tamed man whose prime fear is that
he will become a slave to civiliza
tion. The conflict between these two,
who symbolize diametrically opposed
types of American life, makes up the
plot of William Vaughn Moody's fa
mous play.
The setting is laid on the great
Southwestern mesas, and this lo
cale gives an opportunity for the
presentation of picturesque minor
characters. Among these are Shorty,
a Mexican half-breed; Lon Ander
son, an aged miner; and Dutch, a
burly brutal Westerner. Contrast
ing the crude Western characters are
Winthrop Newberry, graduate of
an Eastern medical school; Polly
Jordan, Ruth's sharp-spoken sister
in-law; and Mrs. Jordan, a digni
fied New England matron.
Everett Glass, director of the play,
was a member of the famed "47"
Workshop at Harvard in 1914. He
directed plays for both Amherst
College and the University of Cali
fornia. Later he was director for
the Berkeley Playhouse, the San
Francisco Stage Guild, the Tamal
pais Mountain Plays, and the Ross
Valley Players. "The Great Divide''
is his first directorial assignment
here at Stanford.
