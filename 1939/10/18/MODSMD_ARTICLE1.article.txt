### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
POREIGN Commissar V. M. Molo
tov lost his first international
skirmish last night when news fil
tered out that Turkey was prepar
ing definitely to cast her lot with
the Allies in the political alignments
which have formed as result of
World War 11.
Negotiations in Moscow for a Rus
so-Turkish Black Sea pact have
failed and at the same time reports
were making the rounds that Turkey
will sign tentative pacts of mutual
asssitance with the British and
French governments.
This news must have jarred Soviet
officialdom, for Josef Stalin was
pinning all his hopes on Molotov's
negotiations. And his wily, glib
Foreign Commissar has done more
to insure Russian security than any
single Soviet sopkesman. When
Stalin jockeyed famed internation
alist and cosmopolite Maxim Litvi
nov out of the job of foreign chief,
the world thought he'd pulled an
other butch.

when Molotov took over
the position and moved Rus
sia into the key spot in the world
scene, the capital of eastern Eu
rope became Moscow and the un
certain balance of peace and war
tilted to the master touch of So
viet diplomats. With incisive
swiftness Molotov lined up his
buffer states along the Baltic
shores. Latvia and Lithuania suc
cumbed to the threat of Russian
troops along their borders. They
became virtual protectorates of
Russia, pawns in the new game
of power politics.
Molotov began dickering with
Turkish Foreign Minister Sukru
Saracoglu. Later he threatened lit
tle wur-debt-paying Finland, played
for another iron-bound alliance.
But Finland refused to be hustled
and, with the friendly but definite
note of disapproval from President
Roosevelt and Scandinavian foreign
leaders, the well-oiled chug-chug of
Russian statesmanship became a
sputter.
Things hadn't been going too well
with Turkey, either. Of course, un
der the Soviet - Turkish Treaty of
Friendship that had been signed, the
Turks were unable to enter into al
liances with the western powers
without Russia's consent. However,
Premier Refik Say dam said that
rather specific grounds had been es
tablished for strong Russo-Soviet
negotiations before the Turkish
Foreign Minister left for Moscow
last month.

VV HEN Saracoglu entered the
formal consideration, Molo
tov and Stalin presented him
with propositions that were ''ab
solutely different" from those or
iginally scheduled. The new So
viet demands were incompatible
with Turkey's pledges to Britain
and France, which Russia pre
viously had okayed, the premier
said.
The premier was considerate
enough to add, however, that "Turk
ish-Soviet relations still are based
on our usual friendship." The big
question among diplomats was,
though, whether Turkey will now
sign her pacts with Britain and
France at once, in defiance of Mos
cow and Berlin, and thereby risk
possible Soviet military pressure.
Last May Great Britain and
France began negotiations with
Turkey aimed at parallel alliances
protecting their mutual assistance
interests not only in the eastern
Mediterranean but in the Black Sea
and Balkans as well.

The negotiations resulted in an
accord and were to be followed by
a more far-reaching pact, provid
ed Russia agreed. And recently a
Turkish military mission went to
London to work out details of the
new pact. Now the signatures
above a gold seal arc all that ap
parently remain.
But Russia hasn't admitted com
plete defeat and Molotov is suspi
ciously silent. When word agair.
conies from Red Square, it may be
a declaration of compromise that
Turkey will remain neutral.
