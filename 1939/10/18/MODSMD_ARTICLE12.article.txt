# Clyde Jeffrey Tells Farm Own Story of Europe Crisis

### CLYDE JEFFREY 
(Today The Daily presents the first of two articles written by
Stanford's Clyde Jeffrey, the world's fastest human, describing bis
trip to Europe this summer with an Amateur Athletic Union-spon
sored team.—The Editor)

In company with a party of other American athletes including myself,
a coach, Mr. Weir of University of Nebraska, and a manager, Mr. Stollen
werck of Memphis, Tenn., we left New York July 2:} aboard the liner
Manhattan bound for Southampton.
The purpose of the trip was to tour Europe and to compete against

.athletes of the various countries
there; but little did we know of the
extraordinary excitement into which
we would run.
Our first view of military might
in France was a glimpse of the
Maginot Line along the railroad line
from Basle to Strassbourg. In Monte
Carlo, where we were coming to the
climax of a rather successful tour,
we heard the first rumors of war.
This was immediately after the
Russo-German non-aggression pact
was signed.
MEET CALLED OFF
Because of the situation, the
scheduled four-day track meet had
to be called off a day early because
the athletes of various threatened
and involved countries were called
up for service.
During the week preceding the
declaration of the war, signs were
plastered on walls in public places
stating that France was in a state of
general mobilization and that all
available private automobiles were
subject to requisition by the army.
Within a few days after the first
rumor most of the tourists had left
the town and incoming soldiers
moved in to take their places. The
famous gambling casinos closed down
for the first time in 17 years. We
were forced to move to another hotel
because nearly all of the help had
been mobilized.
SOLDIERS CROWD CITY
The day before the declaration of
the war every citizen was ordered
out of Monte Carlo to make room
for incoming soldiers who were
marching to protect the French-
Italian frontier. (Monte Carlo is |
only six miles from the frontier.) :
We were fortunate enough to get a ]
"bus." It was really more like a j
truck, being too old for army requi- |
sitioning. In thLs we were taken to j
a little hotel in Cannes. We had no |
sooner gotten settled when we j
heard that the worst had happened, j
TEAM WITHOUT FUNDS
Our team was practically without j
funds, so through the American con- j
sul we were able to get a wealthy !
American who lives in southern j
France to guarantee our meals until |
we received money from America, j
We found that passport identification !
was not enough.
In Cannes they seem to take the |
blackouts very seriously because
the streets at night are pitch black, j
One must actually feel his way j
about the streets.
Movement of troops to the Italian I
frontier continued; this action was j
confined entirely to nights. This is i
no exaggeration. The best way we !
could find the main street was by J
the sound of the soldiers and
horses marching. In the daytime the
men and horses rest under cover of
the wooded hills.
SIRENS SOUND
One night in Cannes, I'm sure
none of us will ever forget. A group
of the fellows were on the water
front when we were startled by the
weird sound of the air-raid siren in
the church steeple. We were really
frightened.
We ran to the sand on the beach
and lay there until the siren stopped.
Then, I'll never forget the silence.
Everybody, I suppose, was listening
for approaching planes.
With the least sound, such as an
automobile motor, the people would
stir about uneasily. After about 10
minutes we heard nothing and we
summed up enough courage to get
up to start back to our hotel.
It was pitch-dark and even inside :
the city lights had been turned off.
Later the siren sounded again, sig
naling that all was well and the
lights came on again.
SHIP OVERLOADED
Finally, on Sept. 23, after nearly
a month of waiting for a boat to go
home, we boarded the Manhattan j
at Bordeaux. There were 1800 per
sons aboard—more than 700 more \
than they had ever had before.
There were cots in the theater,
lounging room, and even in the gym.
Life-boat, drill was enforced the
first several days out. All night the
deck lights were kept on and huge
spotlights were focused on Ameri- j
can flags painted on the sides of the j
boat.
The highlight of the trip, I know, i
for all of the boys, was the sight ]
of the Statue of Liberty as we came ,
into the New York harbor.
