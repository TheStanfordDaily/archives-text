# Administration Vetoes Talk By Communist
## Public Exercises Head Says, 'Not Time For Pro-Red Speaker' 
### 
Members of the Stanford chapter
of the American Student Union were
refused permission to hold an open
meeting on the subject "Soviet Rus
sia's Recent Moves and Their Im
plications" at which the speakers
were to be Professor Harold H.
Fisher and William Schneidermann,
secretary of the state Communist
party, according to a statement made
by A.S.U. President Andries Dei
num yesterday.
Explaining why the request was
denied by the Committee on Public
Exercises, Professor Edgar E. Rob
inson said that the group had no
personal objection to Schneider
mann's speaking on the campus, but
that it felt that this was not the
proper time for the University to
present a pro-Communist speaker,
"especially when the group sponsor
ing him is in a state of disorganiza
tion."
CLOSED MEETS OKAYED
President Ray Lyman Wilbur
stated that open meetings ax-e the
"sounding board" of University
opinion to the outside world, and
that Stanford does not want to bear
the responsibility for what a pro-
Communist speaker may say at this
time. "However," he continued, "the
A.S.U. is privileged to hold as many
closed meetings with speaker's of
as many kinds as it wants."
Desiring to hold an open meeting
to gain members for and interest in
its organization, the executive com
mittee of the American Student Un
ion met yesterday afternoon and
determined to ask the Committee on
Public Exercises to reconsider its
decision.
LATER APPROVAL HINTED
Professor Robinson expressed his
belief that the committee may see
fit to approve a similar gathering
later in the year when the A.S.U. has
achieved a more definite organiza
tion. A date for a meeting at which
a representative of the Communist
party was to have been the speaker
was granted last year, but the sched
ule was changed when he was un
able to be present.
According to Deinum, the A.S.U.
has planned to sponsor a series of
discussions by authorities on con
troversial questions this quarter.
Meetings on Communism, Fascism,
and other topics arc on the program,
he said.
