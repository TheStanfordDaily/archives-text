### 
Fourteen hundred Stanford men and women—and Pierre the Pig—arr
planning to attend the Student-Faculty Field Day slated to begin tills
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock on the intramural field, it was revealed by an
official poll taken Monday night of campus dormitories, eating clubs,
and the Row.
Pierre the Pig's entry was received late yesterday afternoon throngh
Field Day Co-chairmen Powers

Cameron and Art. Gore immediately
after final tabulation of (he poll had
been made.
Replete in a brand new coat of
grease, Pierre the Pig will lead stu
dents this afternoon in a game of
bacon, bacon, who's got the bacon.
The first man to catch Pierre, and
hold him, will be rewarded with a
bid for the Sophomore Cotillion.
Pierre's entry moved him into the
Field Day featured event bracket,
along with the highly touted "mys
tery" baseball team, and the three
legged race in which student lead
ers will team with faculty members.
ROBLE WOMEN TO SERVE
Co-chairman Cameron emphasized
that campus women are especially
being urged to attend this after
noon's program to watch Pierre and
the student-faculty contests. Fresh
men and junior transfers are also
especially invited to attend.
A buffet dinner will be served at.
5:30 o'clock this afternoon on the
field by 30 frosh women, selected by
Ann Townsend. Students living off
campus may procure tickets to the
dinner at the A.S.S.U. office, Cam
eron said.
With no definite word yet re
ceived from the faculty baseball
camp, rumor has it that Player
manager Dr. Harold C. Hand has
been grooming his charges in the
intricacies of double plays and the
hidden-ball trick in an attempt to
put them on the field this afternoon
in the finest baseball condition pos
sible.
TRI-PED RACE SET
From the student baseball team
has come word that no quarter will
be given, and that blue books would
be used as bases to confuse the pro
fessors.
The three-legged race, which last
year proved to be the featured
event of the afternoon, finds student
and professor teams practicing in an
attempt to win the crown now held
by A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthbert
son and Professor Leland Chapin.
At the finish of last year's triped
race, the team of John Bunn and
H. B. Lee ended first only to be
disqualified for jumping the gun.
Jack Calderwood and John All
tucker finished second but were
disqualified because of a doubt as to
Calderwood's faculty status. Tin
third finishing team of Cuthbertsnn
and Chapin was awarded the vic
tory.
On the volleyball field the Encina
frosh will meet their Western Civ
professors in another variation of
the yearly battle. History correctors
will serve as scorers for the match,
Cameron said.
