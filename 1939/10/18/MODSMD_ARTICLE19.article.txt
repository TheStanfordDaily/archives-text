# Hitler's Threat Preceded War, Britain Says
## Henderson Told That 2,500,000 Nazi Troops Would Face Allies 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 17 (UP). —Fuehrer j
Adolf Hitler threatened, in the final
days of diplomatic exchanges before I
the outbreak of the war, to hurl j
about 2,500,000 troops against the I
Allies on the western front after |
conquering Poland in a lightning
campaign, a British government an- !
nouncernent said tonight.
Hitler's threat was said to have
been made to Sir Neville Hender
son, former British ambassador to j
Berlin, when he talked with the
Fuehrer shortly before the outbreak
of war. |
The disclosure was made in a I
"white paper" published tonight by j
the government, containing Sir Ne- i
ville's final detailed report on An- j
glo-German relations.
CONCENTRATE IN WEST
Henderson quoted Hitler as say- |
ing that Germany would be able to !
use 160 divisions of troops against I
Britain and France in the west as j
soon as Poland was subdued.
The former ambassador described
Hitler as eager for war and sur- '•
rounded by "mere yes men." He said j
Field Marshal Hermann Goering j
undoubtedly preferred peace but!
added that Goering once told him: j
"When a decision has been taken I
none of us count more than the i
stones on which we are standing. It j
is the Fuehrer who decides."
Chief among the "yes men" Hen
derson listed Joachim von Ribben- 1
trop, Nazi Foreign Minister, whom, i
lie said, Hitler regaided as a "man I
oi the world" who understood Eng- !
land.
Although it has been believed |
widely that the German army ex
ercised a moderating influence on
Hitler, Henderson expressed a con- I
trary opinion.
."MILITARISTS ADVISE
"If anything did count," Hender- j
son wrote, "it was the opinion of his [
(Hitler's) military advisers. I have j
always believed it was they who, in I
the interests of Germany's strategi- |
cal security, recommended estab- j
lishment of a protectorate over Bo- I
hernia.
"And again this August it was i
they, I fancy, who told Kerr Hitler i
that further delay would be fatal i
lest seasonal bad weather in Poland j
might upset their calculations for her j
swift overthrow.
"The army grudged him even the j
week between the 25!h of August I
and the first of September which his |
last attempt to secure British neu- j
Irality or at least good will cost it."
Henderson traced the sources of
the present conflict back to the purge
of German army leaders in Febru
ary, 1938, but indicated that the im
mediate source was the Polish note
to Berlin in August saying that any
further German intervention in Dan
zig to the detriment of Poland would
be considered an "act of aggression."
