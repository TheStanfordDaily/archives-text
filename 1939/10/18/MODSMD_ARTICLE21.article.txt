the health of Southern California residents.

The majority of the residents of
the lower San Joaquin Valley in
California, sooner or later become
infected with coccidioides fungus
and contract "desert rheumatism";
Dr. Smith said.
Dr. Smith described the endemic
disease as one of the principal
threats to the health of California
agricultural workers.
Newcomers to the San Joaquin
Valley are attacked by the cocci
dioides fungus "relatively soon"
after their arrival, and the result
ing disease which was described as
an "influential illness of varying de
grees of severity" is more common
among females.
The infection, for reasons which
Dr. Smith said are not well under
stood, occurs mainly in the San
Joaquin Valley, although it has been
recognized in Arizona and other
scattered areas.
'The dust borne spores of the fun
gus are inhaled, with the result that
the disease reaches its peak inci
dence in dry, hot weather and its
ebb in wet weather," Dr. Smith said.
In addition to the mild influenzal
type of disease, which always re
sults in complete recovery, the coc
cidioides fungus are responsible for
the dread coccidioidal granuloma, an
active, self-progressive disease.
