# 'Great Divide' Sets Finished
## Director Overcomes Budget Handicaps 
### 
"The Great Divide" would be an
easy play to stage if unlimited
amounts of money were available,
according to Waldemar Johansen,
! technical director.
I However, the budget allows only
i $50 for the three sets, and one of
I these is a huge outdoor scene laid
I on the rim of a Southwestern can
! yon. Johansen has met this prob
j lem by arranging for the background
| to be projected on a specially de
| signed cyclorama.
' The projection is taken from a
water color of the Grand Canyon of
I the Yellowstone done by Johansen
• while he was on a trip through that
! country a few years ago He has
exhibited his water-colors in shows
! all over the United States.
The sets carry out the theme of
! the play, in that the first two. those
laid in the Southwest, project the
free, individualistic spirit of the men
of that country. In contrast, the last
scene, laid in New England, has the
i tight, meticulous air typical of the
! region.
Costumes have all been planned
j and executed on a budget of $25,
, and the whole play, including roy
| alties, will cost just $200. However,
Johansen says this wi.ll not cut down
I the merit of the production.
