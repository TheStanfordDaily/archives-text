sports situation.)

THE SPORTS
WHIRLIGIG
Figures can show very neatly the j
popularity of intercollegiate sports :
among the rank and file of Stanford i
would-be athletic greats. Every
quarter there's more than a three- j
ring athletic circus going on on the j
B.A.C. athletic terrain. On an aver- '
age, more than 400 men per quar
ter compete in team sports, both
varsity and freshman.
So far this quarter with nine
sports going full blast, just over 1
300 athletes are competing for j
numerals. At the same time five i
major and minor sports are in the
midst of fall practice, preparing
for seasons (o open in winter and
spring. Right there, there are
about 2f>o aspirants of known and J
unknown athletic ability.
Besides those who go out for!
Stanford team sports, a good per
centage of non-athletes compete in
intramural football, volley-ball, and
horseshoe matches now in progress. ■
In every case there must be some j
leeway allowed for duplication. But ]
in the end just about every male j
will have gone to the post for some j
team and in some sport.
Tiny Thornhill has 42 out for
varsity grid practice. Harry Ship- |
key has 45 on his frosh roster.
Everett Dean and Beeb Lee are
coaching 45 varsity and 27 frosh
basketball candidates. Harry Ma- I
loney has t»2 on his two soccer i
squads, while Nort Thornton's j
water polo teams have attracted
45 candidates. Cross country and
fencing teams have 10 men each.
First call for men in track, though
five months before the official sea- \
son, has resulted in about 70 varsity |
and frosh runners. Clayton Frye has j
!)0 aspirants from which to choose |
20 men who will make up his box- j
ing squad for winter quarter. Harry '
Wolter's baseball school numbers'
between 40 and 50 embryos. Tennis !
and golf teams number more than I
75 together.
All of these winter sports will be
augmented in numbers when foot- j
ball, soccer, etc., move off the sports j
field.
No sir, you "can't say that the |
Stanford man isn't sports-minded j
some time during the year. And if i
he isn't out for a sport you can bank
on it that he's as good a Monday j
morning quarterback or a grandstand
coach as the next person.
BLACK CAT HELPED
CARDS LAST SATURDAY
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. publicity i
expert, probably wasn't sure that the '
combination of Friday the 13th and i
a black cat would bring luck until '
Stanford tied U.C.L.A. 14-14, Now j
he Ls sure and will probably make I
every effort possible henceforth to,
nab a black cat on every Friday the '
13th, especially when Card teams |
have tough competition the next day.
The story is that Don found a j
black cat in his yard last Friday, j
fed the animal and kept it in his
garage for the night to test its luck.
For a stable mate, Don also found a j
white cat but figures that it was the
black one which brought the Indians I
luck.
Don named the black one Kenny;
the white one, Jackie.

THE SPORTS
WHIRLIGIG
Figures can show very neatly the j
popularity of intercollegiate sports :
among the rank and file of Stanford i
would-be athletic greats. Every
quarter there's more than a three- j
ring athletic circus going on on the j
B.A.C. athletic terrain. On an aver- '
age, more than 400 men per quar
ter compete in team sports, both
varsity and freshman.
So far this quarter with nine
sports going full blast, just over 1
300 athletes are competing for j
numerals. At the same time five i
major and minor sports are in the
midst of fall practice, preparing
for seasons (o open in winter and
spring. Right there, there are
about 2f>o aspirants of known and J
unknown athletic ability.
Besides those who go out for!
Stanford team sports, a good per
centage of non-athletes compete in
intramural football, volley-ball, and
horseshoe matches now in progress. ■
In every case there must be some j
leeway allowed for duplication. But ]
in the end just about every male j
will have gone to the post for some j
team and in some sport.
Tiny Thornhill has 42 out for
varsity grid practice. Harry Ship- |
key has 45 on his frosh roster.
Everett Dean and Beeb Lee are
coaching 45 varsity and 27 frosh
basketball candidates. Harry Ma- I
loney has t»2 on his two soccer i
squads, while Nort Thornton's j
water polo teams have attracted
45 candidates. Cross country and
fencing teams have 10 men each.
First call for men in track, though
five months before the official sea- \
son, has resulted in about 70 varsity |
and frosh runners. Clayton Frye has j
!)0 aspirants from which to choose |
20 men who will make up his box- j
ing squad for winter quarter. Harry '
Wolter's baseball school numbers'
between 40 and 50 embryos. Tennis !
and golf teams number more than I
75 together.
All of these winter sports will be
augmented in numbers when foot- j
ball, soccer, etc., move off the sports j
field.
No sir, you "can't say that the |
Stanford man isn't sports-minded j
some time during the year. And if i
he isn't out for a sport you can bank
on it that he's as good a Monday j
morning quarterback or a grandstand
coach as the next person.
BLACK CAT HELPED
CARDS LAST SATURDAY
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. publicity i
expert, probably wasn't sure that the '
combination of Friday the 13th and i
a black cat would bring luck until '
Stanford tied U.C.L.A. 14-14, Now j
he Ls sure and will probably make I
every effort possible henceforth to,
nab a black cat on every Friday the '
13th, especially when Card teams |
have tough competition the next day.
The story is that Don found a j
black cat in his yard last Friday, j
fed the animal and kept it in his
garage for the night to test its luck.
For a stable mate, Don also found a j
white cat but figures that it was the
black one which brought the Indians I
luck.
Don named the black one Kenny;
the white one, Jackie.
