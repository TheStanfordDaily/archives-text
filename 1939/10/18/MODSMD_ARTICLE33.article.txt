# Papooses Take to Warpath As Fullerton Game Looms
## 
### 
Refreshed after a day of rest from practice, Stanford's freshman squad
buckled down to work again yesterday in preparation for a tough Fuller
ton Junior College next Saturday.
While the varsity takes a vacation, spending Saturday afternoon watch
ing Cal and Washington State play in Berkeley, the frosh will take the

grid spotlight in the stadium. And,
they are playing a mighty tough
eleven from down South.
Though the players received plen
ty of bruises against U.S.C.'s frosh
team, nobody was hurt seriously,
and the Papooses will be in top
strength against Fullerton.
That is all except, of course, Hank
Norberg. the promising end who
played about 5 minutes of football
at the start of the season, only to
receive a fractured cheek bone and
be put out of commission for a
while. But there is good news about
Hank, for he is expected to turn
out late this week and do some run
ning in order to get his legs in
shape. He will definitely be ready
to meet Cal's frosh.
Coach Harry Shipkey is shifting
Roger Laverty from guard to tackle.
After his brilliant game down south
he rates a better chance to play at
tackle, where more substitutions are
made. Shipkey seems to feel that
with such guards as Palmer and
McCain on hand there is little to
worry about at the center of the
line.
Though the Papoose pass attack
rolled up plenty of yards against the
Trojans, Coach Shipkey still feels it
can use some more polish. With the
freshmen doing their share, Stan
ford football teams scored all four
of their touchdowns last week-end
on passing plays.
