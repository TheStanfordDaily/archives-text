## Tiny to Leave Varsity Line-up Unchanged Until Husky Game at Seattle Hope Pervades Football Squad That 60-minute Men Will Last To End of Season Without Injury 
### JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor 
Everything would be "jake" with |
Tiny Thornhill these days if he
could be assured that his three or !
four "60-minute" men would survive I
the grid season without injury.
In that case the Head Man of I
Stanford's football fortunes wouldn't I
have to worry about a few perplex- j
ing line and backfield problems !
which are still there after a month i
of practice and three conference I
games.
Until the Washington Husky game j
at Seattle two weeks hence, Tiny '
will make no lineup changes from I
the one which was nominated as the
varsity yesterday because of ster
ling play against U.C.L.A. Though
the first string is well taken care of
the seconds and thirds are still Tiny's
problem.
DREADS STANDLEE INJURY
Above all, Tiny dreads the day
when "the Chief" of the Card back
field. Norm Standlee, may be laid up
with a bad ankle or twisted knee
such that Thornhill will have to find i
someone who can replace him and !
give a like standout performance. !
Standlee played about 55 minutes of 1
football last Saturday.
Even though Frankie Albert is I
back at left half, Tiny still plans to 1
groom Thor Peterson at that posi- I
tion in order to make for a reliable
replacement in the event Mullin and '
Kmetovic should be hurt.
On the line both Andersen and
Patterson played 60 minutes against |
the Bruins and Donahue was in!
there for 5G minutes. Jones can spell !
Andersen satisfactorily, and Orme or
Braheny are suitable for Patterson
at guard, but neither has had any
experience yet on the forward wall. '
RIGHT TACKLE WEAK
Subs for Donahue at right tackle j
will get as much attention as Tiny |
gave them a week ago, but that is ;
still the weak link in the Indian re- j
serves.
Yesterday Thornhill continued to j
work out old wrinkles and had three i
teams running through his new of- |
fensive attack which will be sprung

on the Huskies Oct. 28, and Santa
Clara in the next game at the Sta
dium, Nov. 5.
There will be no contact work un
til tomorrow when the teams will
scrimmage on the practice field. Fri
day also may be heavy work to take
the place of the bye date on Sat
urday.
