# Stanford Review Gives Grads Test
## 
### 
A quiz on Stanford buildings and
j their respective uses is one of the
j many features of the Stanford II-
I lustrated Review for October. Num
| bered bird's-eye views of quad
j structures accompanied by appro
j priate rhymes give the graduate a
| chance to test his memory of differ-
I ent campus points.
) Pre-registration activities of the
I Class of '43 and the antics of En
j cinamen of earlier days are de
| scribed. Among the interesting frosh
j of the past described is President
Hay Lyman Wilbur, whose college
I days were apparently not reserved
! for study only. This publication,
distributed monthly to Stanford
I alumni, is edited this year by Les
| lie A. Squires.
