# Fire House Boys Douse Phi Delts; Toro Gores Fiji; Theta Delts Win
## 
### 
Led by the Pi'yl brothel's and
MeCloud, the Fire House turned
back Phi Delta Theta 13 t<> 0 in one
of the top games on yesterday's in
tramural football schedule. All the
"F ire Boys' scoring was done
through the air lanes with MeCloud
passing to Collins and Frank Pi'yl
tossing to Monte Pfy! for 12 points.
M. Pfyl converted the last touch
down.
A pair of top-notch basketballers
turned into gridiron satellites yes
terday when Jack Calderwood
flipped a pass to Bill Rapp for the
score which gave El Toro a 6-0 vic
tory over Phi Gamma Delta.
With Brawn passing to McLaren
from four yards out for the only
score, Theta Delta Chi upset Alpha
Delta Phi, 7-0.
Because of Student-Faculty Field
Day, there will be no football game
today. Instead there will probably
be games on Friday.
Forfeiture of games is still all too
common among the Encina teams,
and although a few teams do show
up now and then, they never seem
to get together.
Intramural Manager Andy Stoj
kovich has announced that the golf

bracket has been posted on the in
tramural bulletin board in Encina
Gym, and that the teams in the first
bracket must play their matches by
the end of this week. The schedule
of the horseshoe matches is also
posted on the same bulletin board
and the second round must be com
pleted this week.
