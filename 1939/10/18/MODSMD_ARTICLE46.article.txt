WHEN the Committee on Public Exercises
turned down the American Student Un
ion's request for an open meeting to hear the
pros and cons of current Soviet policy, wrath
ful A.S.U. members left the Administration
Building feeling that they had been denied the
right of freedom of speech.
It is true that on the surface the Committee
seemed to be exercising the gag rule in order
to silence the voice of Communist Party Secre
tary William Schneidermann defending the
U.S.S.R. on the Stanford campus. It appeared
that the University was not allowing both sides
of the question to be presented.
Actually, the A.S.U. has lost only the privi
lege of holding a meeting open to the off-cam
pus public, and it still is authorized to hold any
private student meeting it desires with any
speaker it cares to invite.
The reasons of the Committee on Public Ex
ercises for not granting the date are easy to
understand. When it schedules a meeting on
the University Calendar, Stanford is sponsor
ing the propagation of the views that are ex
pressed there. And at this particular time the
University does not want to foster an organ for
the spread of pro-Soviet doctrine.
The Administration is not trying to deny the
student body an opportunity to hear the Com
munist side of the current Russian story; in
fact it is willing to sanction a closed student
meeting for just that purpose. It simply feels
that it would be unwise to spread such ideas
beyond the bounds of the University—bearing
what many people would consider the seal of
Stanford approval.
Evidently the ire of the American Student
Union can be traced mainly to its disappoint
ment at not being allowed to start off the year
with a highly sensational, open meeting calcu
lated to win new members.
Actually the A.S.U. has but one legitimate
complaint against the University. Arrangements
to bring William Schneidermann to the campus
were made with full knowledge of the heads
of the Public Exercises Committee. Those who
did the inviting could have escaped the em
barrassment of being forced to inform him that
he cannot appear at a public meeting if the
Committee had acted more promptly.
And if that had been done, all the current
sound and fury would have been avoided.

he cannot appear at a public meeting if the
Committee had acted more promptly.
And if that had been done, all the current
sound and fury would have been avoided.
WHEN the Committee on Public Exercises
turned down the American Student Un
ion's request for an open meeting to hear the
pros and cons of current Soviet policy, wrath
ful A.S.U. members left the Administration
Building feeling that they had been denied the
right of freedom of speech.
It is true that on the surface the Committee
seemed to be exercising the gag rule in order
to silence the voice of Communist Party Secre
tary William Schneidermann defending the
U.S.S.R. on the Stanford campus. It appeared
that the University was not allowing both sides
of the question to be presented.
Actually, the A.S.U. has lost only the privi
lege of holding a meeting open to the off-cam
pus public, and it still is authorized to hold any
private student meeting it desires with any
speaker it cares to invite.
The reasons of the Committee on Public Ex
ercises for not granting the date are easy to
understand. When it schedules a meeting on
the University Calendar, Stanford is sponsor
ing the propagation of the views that are ex
pressed there. And at this particular time the
University does not want to foster an organ for
the spread of pro-Soviet doctrine.
The Administration is not trying to deny the
student body an opportunity to hear the Com
munist side of the current Russian story; in
fact it is willing to sanction a closed student
meeting for just that purpose. It simply feels
that it would be unwise to spread such ideas
beyond the bounds of the University—bearing
what many people would consider the seal of
Stanford approval.
Evidently the ire of the American Student
Union can be traced mainly to its disappoint
ment at not being allowed to start off the year
with a highly sensational, open meeting calcu
lated to win new members.
Actually the A.S.U. has but one legitimate
complaint against the University. Arrangements
to bring William Schneidermann to the campus
were made with full knowledge of the heads
of the Public Exercises Committee. Those who
did the inviting could have escaped the em
barrassment of being forced to inform him that
he cannot appear at a public meeting if the
Committee had acted more promptly.
And if that had been done, all the current
sound and fury would have been avoided.
