THE prime advantage of attending a univer
sity with a comparatively small student body
is supposed to be the opportunity for contact
between students and their professors.
Despite the mere 3,200 undergraduates at
Stanford, most students have nothing more than
a casual acguaintance with one or two faculty
members. Relations in small classes and inde
pendent study periods are more or less on a
business basis, and student-faculty social con
tacts are distressingly rare.
Today this situation must be remedied. Logi
cally enough Axe Society has moved its annual
Field Day out of an over-crowded spring guar
ter and back to the beginning of the year so that
student-professor friendships that begin at that
time will have a chance to develop.
After an informal day of volleyball, baseball,
comic races, and bull sessions-*-and with a bar
becue dinner under their belts—professors and
undergraduates will find future social contact
more than natural.
Today the Stanford student will see his prof,
not to find out whether he is going to pass a
course, but to find out what a good guy he
really is.
