# Who Laughs at Last
## 
### 
PERHAPS the first essential in a college hu
mor magazine is that it be funny.
Editors of university magazines during the
past few years seem to have forgotten this. In
stead of being funny they have chosen to be
socially conscious. They have reiterated that
war is abominable, that the poor are starving
unbathed.
They have even played at being literary, if
you aren't too sophisticated in your conception
of what is literary.
But they have forgotten to be funny.
Someone laughed when Chaparral appeared
on the Quad this morning. This didn't prove
that the magazine was funny, because they
laughed before they opened the book.
Perhaps they remembered last year's Chap- j

pie. And if you think they were laughing at
something in last year's Chappie that was
funny, then you don't remember.
This morning they laughed when it sat down
to play.
But this morning, unlike the same morning
last year, they went right on laughing when
they opened the pages, instead of throwing
the nearest tomato.
Because Chaparral, the campus humor maga
zine, was funny today.
They still call him the Ancient One and the
Old Boy up in the Chappie offices. He still sits
in the same chair.
But he put out a magazine which Stanford
can enjoy today, and take home and enjoy to
morrow. He brought humor back to the cam
pus, leaving the wars and the starving poor to
languish at the end of Palm Drive.â€”J. B.
