HORTENSE, HORTENSE!
r PHE frigidity of Stanford womanhood is almost un
believable. In some cases, in fact, it actually is
unbelievable. This acme of incredibility, I feel, ap
plies to you, dear Hortense, as evidenced in your cam
pus opinion below. After I poured my heart out to
you. humbly apologized, and wrote you an ode—all in
a public newspaper—you have not the compassion to
forgive. Ah cruelty, thy name is Figgins!
You do not answer my plea directly, addressing
your remarks to my boss. You know my sincerity.
And you keep saying, "Ask any of the girls," when
obviously the only person we want to ask is you. But
of course you do subtly flatter me by changing the
subject. That's a woman's way of admitting defeat.
I will say, Horty girl, that your new choice of sub
ject, the deceased nickelodeon and its profound influ
ence on yourself, is a very pregnant one. The nickel
odeon reminds me of you a little: it has such sweet
notes and just keeps going around and around—in
circles of ever-diminishing size, until finally it gets
oil the track.
But you are somewhat more plaintive than a mere
metallic record machine, and I can well imagine that
you outdo that musical stomach pump in sex appeal,
of course. The heart-rending account that you pull
from your soul has once again wrenched the very
tears from my eyes: A world without a nickelodeon
must certainly be a vacuous place for you women.
But remember, you still have the Bawlout as a re
search book on males to comfort you; that should
ease the pain of a swingless Cellar.

d |F COURSE you are so very sensitive —like those
genteel guards at San Quentin. Stanford i-oughs
really ought to look out for your feelings, and for your
eyes. From clear across the Cellar counter you could
see in one man that he was looking at you, that
he was rhythmical, that he was a junior transfer, and
that he would have asked you to dance if the oppor
tunity had presented itself. That is a little more than
typically feminine. It combines the qualities of imag
ination and insight so necessary to every fiction writer.
I am glad you agree with me on letting the Nitery
replace the cellar as the jive-dive. In deference to
your sensitivity about running steeplechase races with
your rivals, we might leave the road to the Nitery, the
new haven for the predatory female, unobstructed and
free. That should make your music-balm complete,
and your defense from masculine slyness a sturdy bul
wark of feminine liberty.
Hence, Hortense, my little essence of sauerkraut
juice, my plum of feminine logic, everything is going
to be all right—just because of your one fearless
voice. What a job you would be before the fire on a
quiet winter evening! May the Great Conductor in
Heaven bring the nickelodeon to your very door, and
may you never let another rhythmical junior transfer
escape!
Let jive sound out above the Cellar;
'Cause Hortense-babe is quite the heller!
