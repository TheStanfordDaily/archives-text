"ASK ANY OF TIIE GIRLS"

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Your head for my recent letter, "Now We Girls
Think . . ." has really raised my opinion of you
immeasurably. Were it not for that worm in snake's
clothing that you allow on your back page I could
really get enthusiastic, just ask any of the girls. Your
willingness to present in The Daily the female point of
view, at long last, is gratifying.
Some word in defense of our sex is constantly nec
essary to counteract the meaningless masculine mus
ings of that crock of sour grape juice. The way he
shoots off his face about things that are just none of
his business, simply makes me boil; ask any of the
girls. All that, drivel about the nickelodeon; oh, I
could just scream. He, in his selfish way, thinks the
only loss to the students is a paltry $15 a week. Why
we girls of Roble and Lagunita and other places would
give twice that amount to have it back. He of course
would never realize how its absence simply makes a
girl's chances dwindle. I will give you a poignant
example.

r |" , HE other day I was sitting at. the cellar counter,
somewhat alone, and drinking a coke. I really
don't like Ihe stuff, but the girls claim it gives one
poise. Anyway, across the corner of the counter was a
rather handsome fellow, alone. He kept giving me
nice glances, and I'll just bet he was one of those glam
orous new junior transfers. Anyway, I could tell he
was rhythmical by the way he tapped his check on the
counter. What I am driving at is this: had there been
Ihe nickelodeon there, I could have nonchalantly gone
over to it to play a number, and the chances are ten
to one that he would have joined me and we could have
met in the most jolly manner. We could have been
fast friends by now, just as easy as that.
When I think of what I missed just because a lot
of old stick-in-the-mud males like that page four
clam-face, I get so darn mad. Ask any of the girls.
He might have asked me to dance or anything, par
ticularly if there were an extension to the Nitery
(which is the only sensible thing that Meltingsoft has
ever suggested). That silly nonsense of his about put
ting hurdles on the Union stairs is absurd. He prob
ably only suggested it because he delights in seeing
girls' legs.
Feeling that you, Mr. Editor, have styled yourself
the protector of women's rights, I appeal to you, as
do all the girls, I am sure, if not in words at least in
their hearts, to keep this campus livable for the
woman student, and to save us from the cupidity of
lecherous creatures such as frequent your back pages.
Incidentally, although he apologized, as he well
ought to have, I have a feelintj that he was not en
tirely sincere. However, placing my trust in you, I
remain.
Steadfastly,
Hortense Figgins
