# Allies Fight Nazi Raiders On Sea, Air
## Germans Push Troops Out of French Areas; Punch at Blockade 
### United Press 
Great Britain and France were
on the defensive Tuesday, beating
off German blows on land and sea
and in the air as Adolf Hitler ap
parently sought to give them a taste
of his "blitzkrieg" tactics that ran
roughshod over Poland.
Germany's heaviest blows were
rained on the British fleet because
the Nazis believe the best way to
bring the war to a whirlwind finish
is to shatter Britain's centuries-old
mastery of the seas and break the
Allies' blockade. Time is an ally of
Britain and France.
German bombing planes made two
raids—on Britain's vital naval base
attacks Tuesday — actually three
at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands
off the northern end of Scotland.
The "retired" world war battleship
Iron Duke, flagship of Admiral Lord
Jellicoe in his Jutland battle with
the German imperial fleet, was dam
aged as the Nazi fliers unloaded big
bombs upon warships lying in the
heavily fortified base.
THE WESTERN FRONT
On the western front the Germans,
using more than 90,000 men, pushed
the fighting close to the French bor
der and even penetrated to French
soil at one point but the French
lines stiffened and the war there ap
peared to have settled back into the
status of a sparring match.
The surprise German thrusts,
down the Moselle Valley near Lux
embourg and south of Zwierbrueek
en, seemingly were not the fore
runner of a big German offensive
but result of a Nazi high command
decision it was time to push the Al
lied advance positions back at points
where they menaced the Siegfried
Line.
It was a day in which the war
was brought to Britain. Ever since
the World War military experts
have pictured a war of tomorrow in
which fleets of 200, 300 and 400
bombing planes would sweep upon
enemy cities, industrial centers and
naval bases.
Bombers are Hitler's strongest
weapon, just as the navy is the
backbone of British defense.
BRITISH DOWN PLANES
The British announced five or six
German planes were downed in the
Nazi air force's invasions Tuesday
and half of the 12 or 14 planes which
raided the Firth of Foi'th probably
never reached home.
The most that Winston Churchill,
First Lord of the British Admiralty,
was able to say to offset the German
blows was that at least 20 U-boats—
one-third of Germany's undersea
fleet—have been sunk or crippled
since the start of the war.
The most amazing news of war
ring Europe Tuesday was disclo
sure that a German submarine in
the darkness of early morning last
Saturday crept into Scapa Flow and
sank the battleship Royal Oak with
a loss of more than 800 lives.
SPY SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
Undoubtedly the Nazi espionage
system can claim a share of the
glory of the destruction of the Royal
Oak, for without a thorough knowl
edge of Scapa Flow the submarine
would have been unable to dodge
the mines, nets and sunken hulks
infesting the two narrow approaches
to the 15-mile stretch of water.

THE WESTERN FRONT
On the western front the Germans,
using more than 90,000 men, pushed
the fighting close to the French bor
der and even penetrated to French
soil at one point but the French
lines stiffened and the war there ap
peared to have settled back into the
status of a sparring match.
The surprise German thrusts,
down the Moselle Valley near Lux
embourg and south of Zwierbrueek
en, seemingly were not the fore
runner of a big German offensive
but result of a Nazi high command
decision it was time to push the Al
lied advance positions back at points
where they menaced the Siegfried
Line.
It was a day in which the war
was brought to Britain. Ever since
the World War military experts
have pictured a war of tomorrow in
which fleets of 200, 300 and 400
bombing planes would sweep upon
enemy cities, industrial centers and
naval bases.
Bombers are Hitler's strongest
weapon, just as the navy is the
backbone of British defense.
BRITISH DOWN PLANES
The British announced five or six
German planes were downed in the
Nazi air force's invasions Tuesday
and half of the 12 or 14 planes which
raided the Firth of Foi'th probably
never reached home.
The most that Winston Churchill,
First Lord of the British Admiralty,
was able to say to offset the German
blows was that at least 20 U-boats—
one-third of Germany's undersea
fleet—have been sunk or crippled
since the start of the war.
The most amazing news of war
ring Europe Tuesday was disclo
sure that a German submarine in
the darkness of early morning last
Saturday crept into Scapa Flow and
sank the battleship Royal Oak with
a loss of more than 800 lives.
SPY SYSTEM FUNCTIONS
Undoubtedly the Nazi espionage
system can claim a share of the
glory of the destruction of the Royal
Oak, for without a thorough knowl
edge of Scapa Flow the submarine
would have been unable to dodge
the mines, nets and sunken hulks
infesting the two narrow approaches
to the 15-mile stretch of water.
Great Britain and France were
on the defensive Tuesday, beating
off German blows on land and sea
and in the air as Adolf Hitler ap
parently sought to give them a taste
of his "blitzkrieg" tactics that ran
roughshod over Poland.
Germany's heaviest blows were
rained on the British fleet because
the Nazis believe the best way to
bring the war to a whirlwind finish
is to shatter Britain's centuries-old
mastery of the seas and break the
Allies' blockade. Time is an ally of
Britain and France.
German bombing planes made two
raids—on Britain's vital naval base
attacks Tuesday — actually three
at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands
off the northern end of Scotland.
The "retired" world war battleship
Iron Duke, flagship of Admiral Lord
Jellicoe in his Jutland battle with
the German imperial fleet, was dam
aged as the Nazi fliers unloaded big
bombs upon warships lying in the
heavily fortified base.
