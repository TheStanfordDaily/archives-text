# Chappie Bows To Farm Today
## 
### 
Dedicated to the Roble woman, the
first issue of the 41st volume of the
Chaparral will make its formal bow
to the student body today. On all j
corners of the quad, a host of pretty I
girls will offer the magazine for
sale.
Besides the new policy regarding j
frameable covers, and new type j
face, the Chappie is full of new fea- j
tures, new cartoons, and new jokes, j
Bud Ames, sophomore funny man, I
has donated some of his talents to |
describe the formal opening of the j
War Libe. Jack Dixon and Bert |
Rosenfeld in cartoon and verse J
graphically describe some typical j
Roble types.
William Van Dorn has produced a ;
crossword puzzle appropriately I
called "The Pause That Exhausts." j
A helpful hint to the Dean's office j
in the form of a roommate test is !
also included.
The make-up is different this year, '
in that the cartoons are not con- j
centrated in one place but are j
spread throughout the whole maga- j
zine.
