KAYWOODI^
ffou knew ilia
flavor?
Some pipes are "in a hurry"—fast and
furious —consume tobacco like a four
alarm fire racing through a hay-mow.
Kaywoodie takes it easy, as a good pipe
should. Coaxes out the flavor of your
favorite leaf. Makes it mellow. Smooth
... Just for fun, we tried to measure this
famous but elusive Kaywoodie Flavor in
a good tough laboratory exam,and found
(1) Kaywoodie's smoke is actually cooler
than other pipes, cooler than month tem
perature! never hot or irritating (2) the
smoke is what the French call sec—dry
and free from bitter juices. So pet to
know the Kayuoodie flavor — now!
Shown above, No. 7f>B.
