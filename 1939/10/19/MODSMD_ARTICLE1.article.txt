IT pays to live light.
Anyway, the Scandinavian coun
tries should think so. They've sup
ported President Roosevelt's credo
of neutrality, law and order, have
lived in peace, been kind to their
mothers and children, and scrupu
lously discharged their financial ob
ligations in this country.
And now it pays. If they ever
doubted that when Russia massed
her Soviet legions along their bor
ders, they had good reason last
night to discard their worries, be
cause they had the largest and most
important neutral nation in the
world going to bat for them.
President Roosevelt tossed up
another "moral" barrier between
the Nordic powers and Russian ex
pansion when he joined all the
American nations in supporting
King Gustav's neutrality parley in
Stockholm yesterday.
Roosevelt's move simply re-em
phasized his recent appeal to Presi
dent Mikhail Kalinin to use mod
eration in its negotiations with Fin
land. "Under the circumstances
which exist, this government joins
with the governments of the other
American republics in expressing its
support of the principles of neu
trality and order under law for
which the nations represented at the
Stockholm conference have, through
out their history, taken a consist
ent stand," Roosevelt's note said.

Sweden, Denmark,
and Finland would probably
prefer barriers of steel and con
crete to moral barriers about now,
but the significance of America's
stand in their support is some
thing they can hardly escape. It's
another fly in Molotov's borsch.
And, no matter how he looks at
it, Roosevelt is placed in a peculiar
position, too. He's issuing requests
to a neutral nation, for, even though
her neutrality is a militant one, Rus
sia is still technically a neutral
power. And when one neutral be
gins to criticize the acts of another
"neutral," the situation becomes
highly confusing. And when one
"neutral" has employed definite
military action, combined with high
pressure coercion, to shape the ac
tivities of other neutrals, the situa
tion is even more complex.
It's one for the international law
yers to straighten out.

|>OOSEVELT dominated the
Washingotn spotlight complete
ly yesterday. He issued a strict gov
ernment order banning all bellig
erent submarines from territorial
waters or ports of the United States.
Unprecedented in United States his
tory, the restriction was continued
in a proclamation issued under the
Neutrality Act. It's designed, offi
cially, "to maintain the peace" be
tween the United States, as a neu
tral, and the warring nations.
There have been persistent,
though unsubstantiated, reports
that belligerent subs have been
seen off the Florida, Maine, and
Alaskan coasts. The effect of the
proclamation, according to veter
an naval officers, establishes still
another precedent by placing sub
marines in a special category, in
stead of lumping them with all
types of warships as was done un
der the President's recent neu
trality proclamation.
The ultimatum will prevent sub
mersibles even from coming into
port for provisioning or refueling, a
privilege accorded all other war
ships, but with specified time lim
itations.
During the last war Germany
flouted the might of the British
navy by sending a commercial sub
marine to the United States. The
U-boat calmly loaded in Boston and
departed, arming Germany with
potent propaganda on the "ineffec
tiveness" of the British fleet.
Roosevelt is obviously out to pre
vent the United States being used
again as a propaganda catspaw.
Then, too, the President may have
had in mind the opposition of the
British to the 300-mile "safety belt"
fixed by the conference of American
republics.

|>OOSEVELT dominated the
Washingotn spotlight complete
ly yesterday. He issued a strict gov
ernment order banning all bellig
erent submarines from territorial
waters or ports of the United States.
Unprecedented in United States his
tory, the restriction was continued
in a proclamation issued under the
Neutrality Act. It's designed, offi
cially, "to maintain the peace" be
tween the United States, as a neu
tral, and the warring nations.
There have been persistent,
though unsubstantiated, reports
that belligerent subs have been
seen off the Florida, Maine, and
Alaskan coasts. The effect of the
proclamation, according to veter
an naval officers, establishes still
another precedent by placing sub
marines in a special category, in
stead of lumping them with all
types of warships as was done un
der the President's recent neu
trality proclamation.
The ultimatum will prevent sub
mersibles even from coming into
port for provisioning or refueling, a
privilege accorded all other war
ships, but with specified time lim
itations.
During the last war Germany
flouted the might of the British
navy by sending a commercial sub
marine to the United States. The
U-boat calmly loaded in Boston and
departed, arming Germany with
potent propaganda on the "ineffec
tiveness" of the British fleet.
Roosevelt is obviously out to pre
vent the United States being used
again as a propaganda catspaw.
Then, too, the President may have
had in mind the opposition of the
British to the 300-mile "safety belt"
fixed by the conference of American
republics.
IT pays to live light.
Anyway, the Scandinavian coun
tries should think so. They've sup
ported President Roosevelt's credo
of neutrality, law and order, have
lived in peace, been kind to their
mothers and children, and scrupu
lously discharged their financial ob
ligations in this country.
And now it pays. If they ever
doubted that when Russia massed
her Soviet legions along their bor
ders, they had good reason last
night to discard their worries, be
cause they had the largest and most
important neutral nation in the
world going to bat for them.
President Roosevelt tossed up
another "moral" barrier between
the Nordic powers and Russian ex
pansion when he joined all the
American nations in supporting
King Gustav's neutrality parley in
Stockholm yesterday.
Roosevelt's move simply re-em
phasized his recent appeal to Presi
dent Mikhail Kalinin to use mod
eration in its negotiations with Fin
land. "Under the circumstances
which exist, this government joins
with the governments of the other
American republics in expressing its
support of the principles of neu
trality and order under law for
which the nations represented at the
Stockholm conference have, through
