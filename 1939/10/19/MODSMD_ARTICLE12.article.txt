# Drama to Open Tomorrow at 8
## 'The Great Divide' Features Newcomers 
### 
When Farm audiences gather in
Memorial Hall tomorrow night at
8:15 o'clock to see the Division of
Speech and Drama's production of
"The Great Divide," they will see
what was once considered the "great
American drama."
"The Great Divide" was chosen as
the department's first offering by
Hubert Heffner, new drama head,
who hopes to build the Stanford
theater into a testing ground for new
American plays. Thus his choice of
the first really popular American
play was a natural one.
Essentially a problem story, the
play shows a sheltered New Eng
land girl who wants to break away
from the staid traditions of her up
bringing, but. she cannot quite make
up her mind to being bought West
ern-fashion like a squaw, even
though she finds she does love her
husband.
The two leads are being piayed by
students both of whom are new to
the Memorial Theater stage. Betty
Howe, a transfer from Mills, has
never taken part in a Stanford pro
duction. David Regnery last ap
peared in campus dramatics in "An
gry Mountain," one of the group of
one-act. plays presented by Stagers
last winter quarter.
The Moody play was a smash hit
on the campus in 1916. In that pro
duction William Owens, now pro
fessor in the Law School, played the
lead part of Stephen Ghent.
