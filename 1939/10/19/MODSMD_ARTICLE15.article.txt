tour.—The Editor

By CLYDE JEFFREY

The first article dealt with our ex
perience in Europe during war time.
Although those incidents were the
unexpected highlights of the trip, I
do faintly recall competing in a few
track meets before things began to
pop internationally.
Our team consisted of ten men:
namely, Joe Batiste, a hurdler and
high jumper from Tucson; Roy
Cochran, a quarter-mile hurdler
from Indiana University; Charles
Beetham, a half-miler from Ohio
State; Erwin Miller, quarter-miler
from U.S.C.; Bill Watson in the shot
put, discus, and broad jump; and
Ralph Schwarzkopf, a two-miler,
both from Michigan University;
Blaine Rideout, a miler from a teach
ers college in Texas; George VarolT,
pole-vaulter from Oregon U.; Les
Steers, a home town high jumper
from Palo Alto; and myself. Our
coach was Ed Weir from Nebraska
University.
TRAVEL IN 'FLYING SCOT'
When he landed in London we
found that we were to take a trip
up to Glasgow to compete in a meet.
We took the Flying Scot. Boy! that
train really clicks over the rails.
The crowd at the meet was tre
mendous. There were between 65,-
000 and 75,000 people at that meet.
We all competed against some pretty
steep handicaps; so steep, in fact,
that only one American won his
event;.
In London we were to compete in
an international track meeting.
There were 16 countries represented
and our ten men won eight first
places, so we felt that we were quite
successful. All during 4.he meet it
was raining, so the athletes had a
splashing good time in their events.
While in London we did much
sight-seeing, visiting Hampton
Court, the Parliament buildings,
Scotland Yard, Westminster Abbey,
and other points of interest in and
around London.
AMERICANS DEFEAT SWISS
A week later we were competing
I in Basle, Switzerland, and two days
1 later in Zurich. In both places the
Americans were again very success
ful. In Zurich their national exhi
bition was in progress and it was
very beautiful—at least as much 5s
we got to see of it. We had to go
to bed early because we were to
have a long train ride and a track
meet, in a single day on the morrow.
This meet was in Strasbourg,
France. After it was over we were
really fatigued, for we had competed
in three track meets in four days
and many of us doubled in several
events. If you'll pardon the per
sonal reference, I ran 11 races in
those three days.
We welcomed a week's rest in
Paris, and during this time we all
made sure that we saw all the sights
for which Paris is famous. The Pal
ace of Versailles impressed me be
cause of its place in current and past
history, as did the beautiful grounds
and fountains that surround the
palace.
The high-light of the meet in
Paris was the four-man 800-meter
relay, where a hurdler (Cochran), a
miler (Hideout), a two-miler
(Schwarzkopf), and our regular
half-miler (Beetham) teamed to
gether to break the existing world
record for that distance. This was
one of the most unusual, thrilling
races I have ever seen.
We then moved to Monte Carlo,
where we entered in the Internation
al Students Games. These are held
every other year and representatives
from all over the world compete in
them. Besides track there is com
petition in fencing, volleyball, ten
nis, baseball, swimming, diving, and
water polo.
MEETS CANCELLED
It was here that rumors of the
soon-to-come war were heard and
many of the boys were called up
for service before the games were
over. Because of the lack of com
petitors the games were closed
without ceremony a day earlier
than the scheduled time. It was
these rumors that caused the can
cellation of the scheduled meets in
Greece and Italy.
From the time of our last compe
tition until the time we sailed for

America, we .spent near!y a month
(Aug. 25 to Sept. 23) "searching"
for food and lodging and finally
booking passage home aboard the
Manhattan.
