# Actual Erection Of Libe Starts
## Nine Weeks Needed To Complete Frame 
### 
"She's a-gonna be one fine build
in' once she's up!"
So said one of the 20-odd work
men busy on the erection of the
Hoover War Library, Work since
early this week has taken on the
proportions of a giant pile of jack
straws with steel columns and beams
for the first and second floors set
in orderly disarray on the concrete
foundation of the building.
STEEL BEAMS STARTED
With work on the actual erection
of the building at last under way,
an aggregate of some 245,000 pounds
of steel, amounting to nearly 125
tons, is ready to be incorporated in
the building.
"That's not so much steel," com
mented John R. Leavers, superin
tendent of the construction job. "We
expect to have used 800 tons of it
before the job is through."
Leavers estimated nine weeks of
steady work before the steel frame
work nears completion. After the
first three or four stories of the 210-
foot structure are up workmen will
begin work on the wall forms, he
said.
TWO COLUMNS SET
Two of the four front columns are
already set, Leavers said. The tops
of these columns will be left with
out beams in order to enable imi
tation marble columns to be placed
upon them.
Approximately 2,580,000 pounds of
concrete go into the finished founda
tion, with a total of SGOO sacks of
cement already poured.
And while workmen busy them
selves on the actual erection of the
gigantic structure, Stanford students
pause to look and wonder, and then
go on to classes.
