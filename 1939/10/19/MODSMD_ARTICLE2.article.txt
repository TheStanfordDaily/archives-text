# Allies Fear Nazi Land, Air Attack
## British Prepare For Raid as Planes Fight Above Naval Station 
### United Press 
The Allies prepared Thursday to
resist big-scale German attacks on
land and in the air—shattering air
raids on the British Isles and per
haps a fresh onslaught along a 90-
mile sector of the western front.
British and German planes battled
again Wednesday over the British
naval base at Scapa Flow, rendez
vous of the fleet off the tip of Scot
land where a Nazi U-boat sneaked
in last Saturday and sank the battle
ship Royal Oak and where raiding
bombers damaged the world war
battleship Iron Duke Tuesday.
British defense planes were bat
tling the Nazi aircraft off the Scot
tish coast, Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain was warning the Brit
ish people that the war that has
been brought to them by air and sea
dui'ing the last few days may be
only a taste of what is to come.
ALLIES FEAR ATTACK
On the western front German pa
trols felt out the Allied Lines be
tween the Moselle and Saar Rivers,
near Luxembourg. British and
French military leaders believed
that Nazi blows might be unleashed
again in the sectors where a light
ning attack drove the French back
to their own frontier Monday."
The Allied command quickly shift
ed its reserves and massed guns in
an effort to match the Nazi high
command's supposed maneuverings
for a major attack with segments
of 800,000 troops concentrated along
and immediately behind the west
wall fortifications.
The Allies have no intention of
launching an offensive themselves
on the western front, at least not
this winter, and will wait for the
Germans to make the first move.
RAID ALARMS SOUND
Air raid alarms sounded along the
Scottish coasts and in such large
northern French cities and ports as
Lille, Boulogne and Havre, indicat
ing that Germany's scouting planes
were intensely active Wednesday in
preparing for what the Allies fear
will be smashing air attacks.
The amazing feat of the Nazi Ü
boat in penetrating the defenses of
Scapa Flow and sinking the battle
ship Royal Oak, with a loss of 810
lives, found angry reaction in some
sections of the British Press and
brought the British government un

mons for its manner of conducting
the war.
The United States took steps to
keep submarines out. of American
waters. President Roosevelt issued
a proclamation banning the U-boats
of all warring nations including so

U. S. ports or territorial waters —
normally three miles out—except
when the submersibles are driven to
shelter by storm, epidemic or other
natural causes.
