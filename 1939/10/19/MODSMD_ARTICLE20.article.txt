sor Ernest Hilgard emerged winners
of the triped race yesterday before
1,000 spectators at the third Student-

finished last in a field of seven con
testing teams.

Pierre, led a strong field in a four

"No, I'm not taking Pierrette to
the Cotillion," he protested after the
race.

team turned on the heat in the first
half of their encounter with a picked
student nine, but succumbed to a
barrage of hits in the final innings
to lose by the narrow score of 14-13.
Led by Dr. Harold C. Hand, the
faculty ball-tossers showed the cam
pus they were as versatile on tho
ball-field as in the class rooms, with
a sparkling, if slightly unorthodox,
brand of baseball.
Chief Umpire A1 Masters, B.A.C.
graduate manager, was hard put to
call decisions on plays that found
the faculty infield tackling the stu
dent base-runners and delivering
class room lectures to them until
tagged out.
Dean of Men John Bunn at third
base, Everett Dean at first, and Max
Savelle at shortstop turned out to be
the spark-plugs of the faculty de
fense.

Thirty of Roble's fairest served
a buffet, dinner to a surging crowd
of hungry spectators and contestants
at 5:45 o'clock.
And as one of the spectators left,

Highlight of the race, however,
was the fact that Stanford's ace
sprinter Clyde Jeffrey and Profes
sor Tex Byrd, who recently declined
the position of Farm .track coach,
finished last in a field of seven con
testing teams.

Pierre, led a strong field in a four
legged race until finally cornered
and stopped by Russ Vail, freshman

the Cotillion," he protested after the
race.

STUDENT NINE WIN
The faculty "mystery" baseball
team turned on the heat in the first
half of their encounter with a picked
student nine, but succumbed to a
barrage of hits in the final innings
to lose by the narrow score of 14-13.
Led by Dr. Harold C. Hand, the
faculty ball-tossers showed the cam
pus they were as versatile on tho
ball-field as in the class rooms, with
a sparkling, if slightly unorthodox,
brand of baseball.
Chief Umpire A1 Masters, B.A.C.
graduate manager, was hard put to
call decisions on plays that found
the faculty infield tackling the stu
dent base-runners and delivering
class room lectures to them until
tagged out.
Dean of Men John Bunn at third
base, Everett Dean at first, and Max
Savelle at shortstop turned out to be
the spark-plugs of the faculty de
fense.
