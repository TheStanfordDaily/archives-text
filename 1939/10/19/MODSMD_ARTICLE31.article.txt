LP AND DOWN [
Till? SPORTS RI ALTO
The rule has been that few junior |
transfers ever meet the requirements
of university football. Jim Verdieck, j
all-Southern California Junior Col- |
lege center last year at San Ber- i
nardino, is the exception to the rule. !
however.
Last spring when Tiny Thornhill |
was running through spring prac- 1
tice, he had Colin McClintock, the |
lrosh, at center, who was giving an I
admirable performance day after !
day. As fhr back as then, Thorn- j
hill was figuring on Verdieck's j
transferring to Stanford. But a good
Southern California footballer, who
considers enrolling here, is usu
ally never counted upon, what with
the Trojans eyeing every prospect, I
until registration is complete.
If the time should ever come J
when the Indians have no place
ment kicker in the line-up after a
score, you can expect to see Ver- (
dieck make a try for the extra
point. At San Berdoo, he con
veiled better than 90 per cent of !
liis attempted points after touch
downs in his two years—and he
was with a high-scoring team, too 1
Three other jaysee transfers —but
of one-year experience on the bench
here—are flirting with first-string
jobs. John Casey from Pomona Jay
see plays behind Standlee and Pet
erson at full. "Moon' Mullin of
Marin Jaysee is alternating with Al
bert and Kmetovic at left half.
TRACK, BASKETBALL
TRANSFERS EXCEPTIONS
While Tiny can never figure on j
more than one transfer a year to j
make the grade, Everett Dean and |
Bill Ellington, the track and bas- I
ketball coaches, this year are ex- i
pecting great things from some jun- I
iors.
Three distance men from San Ma
teo Jaysee head the track list. Blair
Hyde has a 1:53 880 under his belt
and can run under 49 seconds in
the quarter. Jack Moore has times
of 1:58, 4:25, and 9:38 in the half,
mile, and two mile. Burman Skrable
has negotiated the half and mile in
1:54.8 and 4:24. Along with Mush
Girard and Paul Moore, Stanford
should be able to find a winning
medley and two-mile relay com
binations.
One sprinter is already enrolled j
and two others are awaiting win- J
ter quarter delivery. With Clyde I
Jeffrey as a nucleus, championship
140 and 880-yard relay teams j
should he formed. Roy Bursch i
with 10 and 22 seconds to his !
credit is from Sacramento. San !
Mateo and Santa Rosa will ship
the other two.
Dean has two Modesto Jaysee
basketballers who are top-notch
players. Besides, Stanford lost three
sharp-shooting Southland jaysee
men who couldn't make the schol
astic grade, although Dean admitted
that they possibly could have made
his team easily enough.
SHIN SPLINTS:
HEARD OF 'EM?
Wiseacres on the Indian track
team tell this one on an embryo
soph manager.
Tuesday afternoon the soph was !
sent to the equipment room for shin
splints. From there he was sent
back to the track to find out which
ieg the shin splints were lor. Back
to the gym, he was sent on his in
nocent way to Jake Irwin, who sent
him to the construction yard, who I
sent him to ... .
A kindly .soul told him that shin
splints aren't made of wood, and
aren't for legs, but are bone splin
ters in legs sometimes the result of
too much hard practice early in the
season.

ADDED ATTRACTION
TO WATER POLO
Between acts of Saturday's water
polo double-header in Enema Pool,
Coach Nort Thornton has decided to
put Howard Adams on exhibition on
the diving board. Then next week
end Helen Crelenkovich, the West's
most outstanding woman diver, will
go through her act. Within a week,
Stanford swim enthusiasts can see
and compare the diving of one of
the best college men divers on the
coast and the queen of intercolle
giate diving and national women's
high diving titlist.
