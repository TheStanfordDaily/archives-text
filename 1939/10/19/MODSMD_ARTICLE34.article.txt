the Student-Faculty Field Day, but
today they'll go at it again with all
the fury of Ferdinand in a flower
garden.
Sigma Chi goes to the post in an
other attempt to show heels to the
rest of the field and, unless the dope
bucket is all wet, they stand a bet
ter than even chance to do just
that. It's El Cuadro who will put
the pressure on the Sigma Chis in
one of today's top games.
Two Encina games are scheduled
for this afternoon, and if all the
teams show up it looks as if the com
petition will be hot for the Encina
intramural football trophy.

way, and Eddie Twiggs, varsity golf
coach, who is handling the tourna
ment, has asked that all first-round
matches be played off before the
week is out. The schedule for the
matches is posted in Twiggs' office
in the golf course clubhouse.
