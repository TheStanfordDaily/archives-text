# Indians Stage Scrimmage, Prepare for Huskies
## 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Two vigorous intersquad scrimmages, to lake the place of the open
date the Indians have this Saturday, have been called for by Tiny
Thornhill for this afternoon and tomorrow on the practice field.
Drilling the first three days of the week on new plays, which will get
actual! first degree testing against the Huskies at Seattle, Oct. 23, the

Indians will divide into two camps<
and see what each can do about fool
ing the other.
Saturday the gridders will take in
a mass scouting tour of the W.S.C.-
Cal grid tilt in Berkeley, while Tiny
will probably do some scouting on
his own hook in Corvallis, where
the Huskies and Oregon State
clash. Monday will begin the se
rious work of preparing a defense
for Washington power plays and
finding additional means to make
their own attack work.
No special line-ups will be called
into play this afternoon, although
there is hardly any doubt but what
the team which opened against the
Bruins will be on the offensive first
with Albert at the helm.
During the three practices this
week, the team has supplanted grim
determination which characterized
their workouts following two suc
cessive defeats with a bit of good
natured kidding on all sides and
general "horsing around." However,
it'll be all work and no play this
week-end and all of next week.
In spite of their antics, which
have enlivened all practices, the
gridders have taken well to the
new offensive which Tiny has out
lined for them.
With the two weeks allotted them
between the Bruin and Husky
games, the coaches have taken ev
ery advantage to brush up the men
on blocking and tackling, two de
partments which can still be im
proved upon.
