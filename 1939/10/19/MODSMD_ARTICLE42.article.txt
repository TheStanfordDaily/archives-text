# Card Mermen Face Uclans
## 'Best Ever' Indians Set for Invaders 
### 
What will happen when "best";
water polo teams from Stanford and
U.C.L.A. clash will be decided Sat
urday at 1:15 o'clock when Coach i
Nort Thornton presents his "water
carnival" at Encina pool.
Just when Coach Thornton was
shouting the loudest over his In
dians, reports rolled up from Los
Angeles which tend to de-empha
size local rumblings.
An out lit which whacked its first
opponent. 17 to 2 —Compton Junior
College—and then trounced L.A.C.C., i
15 to 2, gives Coach Don Parks
something to yell about.
The U.C.L.A. claim points out that |
University of Southern California, |
bolstered by the reported return of
Paul Wolf, all-conference sprint, is,
bragging about the best Trojan j
seven ever to hit the waters.
The Southern outfit could only j
beat Compton J. C. 9 to 0. By com
parative score that would give
U.C.L.A. an 8-point advantage over;
the "best" defending champions.
Twelve special students have been ;
I selected to take every course ottered !
i>t Oglethorpe University. It'll take ,
each one six years to complete the j
task.
