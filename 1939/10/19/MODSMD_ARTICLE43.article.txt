## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Freshmen Lose Armstrong, Await Fullerton Invasion 
### 
News (hat Eric Armstrong, hustling litilo right halfback on Harry Ship
key's powerful frosh grid eleven, is definitely out of Saturday's game with
Fullerton and a doubtful starter against U.C.L.A.'s freshmen tiie follow
ing week has caused several shifts in the frosh line-up.
To offset tlie loss of Armstrong, who was a constant break-away threat.

Shipkey has shifted Red Robinson
from left half over to right to help
John Chimenti fill in for the in
jured back. This weakened the left
half situation so Shipkey has hefty
Milt Vucinich working assignments
both there and at halfback.
Armstrong is suffering from a
pinched nerve in his knee and
wrenched muscles on the inside of
his leg. He was laid low by a fly
ing block early in the game against
U.S.C.
But to balance Armstrong's ab
sence there was a familiar figure
galloping about the field yesterday
at practice. It was none other thai
Hank Norberg, limbering up his leg
muscles after a three-weeks layoff.
And when Norberg goes into ac
tion against Cal's freshman team as
Shipkey hopes him to, he will b<
wearing a full face mask gruesomt

enough to scare the hardiest op
posing tackle to protect his cheek.
Shipkey sent his charges through
dummy practice yesterday, drilling
especially on short passes and drift
ers off tackle. Roger Laverty and
Jack Tellefsen filled in at tackle and
end on the first string.

traced by name back beyond the

3400 B!C.
