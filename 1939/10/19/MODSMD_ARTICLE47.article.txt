# Thinking It Over

### 
YOUTHFUL enthusiasm is a wonderful thing.
Unfortunately it has one drawback: it some
times prevents the enthusiastic ones from stop
ping to give a matter careful consideration be
fore they act on it.
That is exactly what it did to the members of
the American Student Union executive com
mittee during the past two days. Stirred with a
desire to increase its membership and win the
interest of the campus, the A.S.U. determined
to hold an open meeting at which a Stanford
professor and a representative of the Com
munist party were to discuss the pro and con
oi present Soviet policy.
Unhappily these enthusiastic young people
failed to observe a rule of the University in not
waiting until they had obtained the approval
of the Committee on Public Exercises before
they invited their outside speaker.
When their application to hold an open meet
ing was denied, their youthful enthusiasm was
punctured; it popped like a toy balloon. And
the noise of the explosion sounded loud on the
campus.
Claiming that they were losing the right of
free speech, the A.S.U. members determined to
present their petition again to the Public Exer
cises Committee. Bitterly they pondered on the
embarrassment of having to inform their Com
munist speaker that he would not be allowed
to appear, and they nursed their wounded ego
with the thought that even a member of the
Stanford faculty had been refused permission to
express his views at an open meeting.
Yesterday, having had a chance to think the
situation over carefully and to talk to the Com
mittee again, the Student Union members found
that they were wrong. And they admitted it.
The awkward situation with regard to the
outside speaker arose through their own fault
in failing to wait for official approval before
inviting him. The professor in question had not
been refused the right to talk. In fact, no appli
cation that he be the only speaker at the meet
ing ever was submitted; but if it had been, it
is easy to judge that it would have been ap
proved: the Committee on Public Exercises
never has denied a faculty member the right to
express his opinions at an open meeting.
And yet late yesterday afternoon as the storm
clouds blew away, A.S.U. President Deinum
was heard to say that he will keep on fighting
lor approval of the meeting until the Committee
on Public Exercises sees fit to grant it.
Thus ever, youthful enthusiasm.
