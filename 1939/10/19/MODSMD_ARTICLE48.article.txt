OF all the curses that God and man have in
flicted on the Stanford driver, perhaps the
most trying has been the mountainous bump in
the road on Pine avenue just west of Galvez
street â€”that hulking obstacle that one meets
after cutting left off Palm Drive and heading
for the Encina Gym.
There more differentials have scraped the
ground, more heads have hit the ceiling, and
more vile epithets have been uttered than on
any other spot on the campus.
The insidious hump also can boast one of the
highest accident records on the Farm. The last
serious Stanford smash-up took place there
when two faculty cars collided on Registration
Day of last spring guarter.
But all things come to us who wait. Today
Pine avenue just west of Galvez is closed to
traffic, and workmen are busy removing the
Mt. Everest of the Stanford roads.
It is difficult to imagine why the Department
of Buildings and Grounds decided to repair the
road at this particular time. Perhaps it became
embarrassed last week-end when U.C.L.A. visi
tors drove over it again and again just for the
thrill.
If such is the case, perhaps we had better in
vite the Bruins to come back soon. We have
a lot of other roads that may amuse them.
