# Yes, We'll Have Rest

### 
WHEN there is so much United Press news
in The Daily these mornings, it proves a
thing or two:
(1) There is a war or something of the sort
going on in the world.
(2) Stanford has become very quiet.
The only really big complaint, relatively
speaking, that The Daily has had all quarter is
that no papers are being left at the Bookstore.
No one on the campus is mad about any
thing, mad enough to make any noise about it,
except the A.S.U.
The only one who is at all excited is Hortense.
The football team is resting, for the time
beincr. on its laurels.

The Rally Committee is resting, for the time
being, on the laurels of the football team.
The faculty is resting, nursing a sore muscle
or two, perhaps.
Memorial Hall is being quietly swept out so
that the audience will have a clean place to
light when it is knocked into the aisles tomor
row and Saturday nights. But at present the
quiet sweeping is going on.
Chaparral is out for another month. Chapar
ral's small blondes are back on the shelf for
another month.
There isn't a jolly-up in sight.
There is one dance in sight—if you have your
field glasses with you.
As a matter of fact, the stillness here on the
Farm would be deadly if it weren't for the
racket attached to building the Hoover War
Library—and the only place you can hear that
is in the Libe.—D. J.
