### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
OUR SECOND LIEUTENANTS
A STORY is told about General Pershing which,
true or not, might well have been written for
Hell-week. The commander himself was walking
around the trenches one night, all bundled up in a
trench coat. He passed two dough-boys who needed
matches for their cigarettes. One of the privates, more
enterprising but less cautious than his pal, Irippcd up
to Pershing, clapped him on the shoulder, and asked
cheerily, "Hey, buddy! Ya got a light?"
As the General obliged him by striking a match
and offering it to him with cupped hands the soldier
saw who "buddy" happened to be. He coughed, sput
tered and saluted.
"Beg pardon, sir!"
"It's all right, son," Pershing told him, "but be
more careful; next time it might be a second lieuten
ant."
Lots of sophomores are finding out through ini
tiations this week that almost every house has its
second lieutenants. More captains, but just a few
generals.
Stanford is unique among universities for its lack
of freshman-hazing. But the happy freshman who
joins a fraternity tastes bitter-alum for a week, be
fore he really becomes "one of the brothers." There are
a number of facets to this diamond of fraternal com
radeship.
*t« * * *
staunch Hell-week man claims that it is only
by paddling the backs of the pledges' laps, mak
ing them build fires with their mouths, dumping them
12 miles east of Livermore at two in the morning, and
generally putting them on the defensive that the
upper-classmen can get to know their new brothers—
and vice-versa, especially vice-versa. Some of the
wiser seniors and juniors think the tough stuff is
unnecessary, even a little silly. They look contemptu
ously at the few chaps who were so frightened by
their own sophomore ordeals that they feel obliged to
over-exercise their new-found authority. But the lieu
tenants are omnipresent, as many a sophomore will col
orfully testify when no one is listening.
He who is paddled and ordered may really learn
things about human nature: that it tends to remain
very youthful, for instance. But he who paddles as
though he meant it, and orders as though he were the
sole executor of the law of gravity, can hardly profit
from the ritual. I wonder if the officious initiator
knows he is being sincerely and expertly cursed for
his pains.
Probably he does. But what does that matter to a
second lieutenant? Isn't it really "good for them,"
after all?
There are some schools of psychology who think
that the swaggering paddlcr will never rise above a
captainship. And most of us are fairly sure that the
grown man who finds sincere reasons for a vindictive
swat, will never be a general.
