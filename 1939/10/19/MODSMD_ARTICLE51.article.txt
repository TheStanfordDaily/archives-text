# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						WINDS OF FREEDOM 
### 
HP HE EDITOR, SIR:
As a member of the executive committee of the
American Student Union, I confess I was somewhat
astonished at the treatment the Daily gave the denial
by the Public Exercises Committee of our request for
an open meeting on the Russo-German non-aggression
pact. It is true that we were denied the right to pre
sent Dr. Harold Fisher, of our history department, a
critic of the pact, and William Schneidermann, com
munist proponent of the pact, at an open meeting.
But the amazing fact that the Daily story and edi
torial overlooked was that the A.S.U. was advised thcit
the committee looked with disfavor upon a presenta
tion by Dr. Fisher alone. The committee felt that the
issue was too controversial for discussion in any fash
ion on the Stanford campus.

J OGICALLY, this policy means, in other words, that
we cannot discuss in an open meeting such topics
as revision of the embargo, Ham and Eggs, the Dies
Committee investigations, the LaFollette probe," or any
phase of the war in Europe, for these are all contro
versial issues.
Even if the Committee could find grounds on which
to exclude a Communist speaker from the campus, on
what reasonable grounds could the Committee prevent
the discussion of the issue by one of its own faculty
members?
Surely there is nothing more fundamental in our
democratic society than the free discussion of contro
versial issues.
