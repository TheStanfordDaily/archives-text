r pilE EDITOR, SIR:
We fellahs read in the Dippy this morning that
you fellas got some plan to burn something up in our
calf pasture.
Don't mind havin' a little bar jerkin' party at no
time specially when we kin set on our balconey and
kinda toast our toes at the same time. So you've got
our ducats already.
However, our roof here at Kappa Kappa Toyon is
tile, and plenty clanky. Goldamedest thing about that
roof, too- ever since you printed about this here
weenie roast, all night long we hear foot-tracks, foot
tracks, creeping up and down the gables. Downright
weird. Can't be up to no good.
Could probably stand that all right but've had
quite a bit on my mind lately—T.B. examination
showed positive, and the old heart's got a new clank
in 'er that wasn't put there by no Roble gal. Well,
don't wanta trouble you with no more details, but if
these fellahs around here don't quite throwin' cryin'
spells and fits all up and down the halls, I'll just have
to go home.
Pleased to thank you for any consideration. Mr.
