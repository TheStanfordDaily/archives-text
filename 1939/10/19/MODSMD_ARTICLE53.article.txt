# Farm Writer Praises Opera 'Die Walkure'
## 
### 
With magnificent voices, spec
tacular staging, and a conductor who
really knows his stuff, the San Fran
cisco Opera Company has done it
again. The audience, with no few
er orchids and just as many ermine
wraps as Manon's first-night assem
blage, let themselves go with en
thusiasm at Tuesday night's produc
tion of "Die Waikure. - '
Nothing need be said about Wag
ner's opera, long established among
the world's favorites, and very little
about the cast, possibly the most
star-studded of this or any other
San Francisco season.
lilt; NAMES ON PROGRAM
The big names on the program,
Marjorie Lawrence, Kirsten Flag
stad, and Lauritz Melchior, turned
in performances that came as near
perfection as any that an American
audience has ever been treated to.
But. the real bouquets go to the rest
of the cast, who matched them aria
for aria and gesture for gesture to
produce a perfectly uniform pro
duction.
Kathryn Meisle and Norman Cor
don, long-time favorites of San
Francisco music lovers, made com
paratively minor roles stand out,
but Julius Huehn as the fiery Wotan
stole the applause after the final
curtain.
LEINSDORF IS PRAISED
Special bouquets go to Conduc
tor Eritfh Leinsdorf and the orches
tra to whom no small credit for the
unity and power of the perform
ance is due. The fire music of the
third act was breath-taking in its ef
fect without threatening to drown
out the singers as it has often done.
Scenery and staging were well up
to the standard of the rest of the
performance, although the size of
the first act hut would have dwarfed
any but the most talented actors.
The fog effects during the Valkyrie
scene and the fire which surrounds
the sleeping Brunnhilde were real
istic enough to please even John
Steinbeck.
STARS TRADE ROLES
It seems hardly necessary to men
tion the fact that the physical char
acteristics of some of the cast were
not too well suited to the roles of
young lovers, but that situation has
never been considered a drawback
to grand opera.
Flagstad and Lawrence trade roles
for the repeat performance of "Die
Waikure" scheduled for next Tues
day night, but the casts remain es
sentially the same. â€”Pat Smith
