# Cardinals Remain Undecided On Location, Band for Dance
## 
### 
Decision by Cardinals on the Big Game Dance was withheld at last
night's meeting because of the absence of information on name bands and
a hall large enough to accommodate the number of students who have
signified their interest in the affair.
Gordy Nicoll, who has been investigating bands and halls, yesterday
received a letter from the Bay#

'Meadows board of directors that the
clubhouse would not be available
because of certain work which is be
ing done on the dance floor and
other repairs which will be under
way at that time.
DECISION NEXT WEEK
Final decision on the dance will
probably be released next Monday
following further investigation by
Nicoll of other suitable locations on
the Peninsula.
To the possible orchestras already
announced, Count Basie, Jimmy
Grier, Gus Arnheim, has been added
the name of Charley Barnet.
All information gathered will be
presented to Excom next Tuesday,
at which time the dance will be
definitely scheduled or cancelled.
HOMECOMING SUGGESTEI)
Other business taken up by the
group included a suggestion to make
Big Game Day a homecoming day
for alumni as is generally done by
several other coast colleges during
the grid season. If approved the
fplans put forward by Cardinals
would include having all living
groups open for the entire day with
a homecoming meeting some time
during the morning for all return
ing alumni.

The Cellar trophy case will be'
changed each week to include many I
old historic trophies won by Farm \
athletic teams ol' the past, it was i
decided.
