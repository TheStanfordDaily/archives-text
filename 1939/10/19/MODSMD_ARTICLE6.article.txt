# Roosevelt Bans Subs from U.S. Waters, Ports
## Damaged U-boats, Armed Merchantmen Are Not Restricted 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 (UP). —
President Roosevelt today issued a
proclamation banning belligei'ent
submarines from territorial waters
and ports of the United States.
The proclamation, issued under
the Neutrality Act, permits entry
only by submarines "which are
forced into such ports" or terri
torial waters by "force majeure"—
the latter being a diplomatic term for
accidents or "major force."
Even then, the proclamation speci
fies that submarines may enter only
"while running on the surface with
the conning tower and super-strucr
ture above water and flying the flag
of the belligerent state which it rep
resents."
SUBMARINES REPORTED
There have been repeated reports,
some of which Mr. Roosevelt con
finned, that submarines have been
seen off the coasts of Florida, Key
west, Maine and Alaska.
The proclamation did not apply to
armed merchant vessels.
It named France, Germany, the
United Kingdom, India, Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, the Union of
South Africa and Poland as the bel
ligerents.
Poland was included because this
government has not recognized di
vision of the republic by Germany
and Russia.
LAW LIMITS BOUNDARY
The proclamation used the phrase
"territorial waters" without amplifi
cation of the exact area to which it
applied. However, under interna
tional law the territorial waters of
a nation are defined as those within
a three-mile limit of its coast.
There was no indication that the
ban was designed to apply to any
more widespread area such as the
300-mile offshore neutral limit set
by American republics in the dec
laration of Panama.
The pi'oclamation does not apply
to the Canal Zone, where special reg
ulation are in force.
