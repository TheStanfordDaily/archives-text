# Committee Again Denies ASU Appeal
## Robinson Reaffirms Previous Decision To Ban Red Speaker 
### 
Stanford's Committee on Public
Exercises, through Professor Edgar
E. Robinson, late yesterday after
noon again refused to sanction an
open meeting of the local chapter of
the American Student Union, in
which the A.S.U. had hoped to pre
sent discussions by Professor Harold
H. Fisher of the Farm faculty and
William Schneidermann, secretary of
the California Communist party.
Following the Administration's re
assertion of a previous stand on the
controversial issue, Andries Deinum,
president of the Stanford A.S.U.,
announced that his organization still
had high hopes of presenting open
programs with authorities on Com
munism, Fascism, and other -isms
as the guest speakers.
Professor Robinson, in clarifying
the position of his committee and
the University, insisted that no vio
lation of student rights was ever in
tended.
CHAPTER DISRUPTED
He further declared that the Stan
ford chapter of the Union was at
present largely disorganized and di
vulged that only two men of a six
man executive committee were able
to keep an appointment with him.
"In a few months," he told The
Daily, "when the relationship of the
California Communist party to Rus
sia is clear, we may approve such an
open meeting. A talk by Professor
Fisher alone would be acceptable to
us at any time."
Several members of the A.S.U.,
when informed of the attending cir
cumstances, indicated a leaning to
ward accepting the administration's
decree without further complaint,
but Deinum hinted last night that his
efforts to present controversial sub
jects and speakers would go on un
abated. '
WILBUR STATES STAND
President Ray Lyman Wilbur
stated Tuesday that open meetings
were not forbidden in any sense of
the word but that such gatherings
were a "sounding board" of Uni
versity opinion to the outside world.
He also intimated that the A.S.U. —
or any other organization — could
hold closed meetings with speakei-s
of their own choosing, without Uni
versity interference.
The Committee on Public Exer
cises granted a date for such a Com
munist guest speaker last year when
the A.S.U. membership was larger
and more strongly knit. However,
that meeting was canceled when the
head-line attraction was unable to
be present.
