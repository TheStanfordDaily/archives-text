is up to it again.
Cast in the mold of Munich
comes the news that Britain and
the new Polish government in exile
have agreed that if and when Allied
war aims are achieved and Poland is
reconstituted, Poland will not claim
that portion of the country seized by
the Soviet Union.
It's getting to be a commonplace
tiling, the way these English dip
lomats hand out European real es
tate that doesn't belong to them.
There must he an art to saying,
casually, "You can have this little
parcel. Of course it's not much
—just a small section of Poland
(or Czechoslovakia). But maybe
you can fit it in somewhere. We
•lon't really care. Just take it
along."
This case may be slightly differ
ent from England's earlier spree of
genei'osity. At any rate, the exiled
Polish government indicated that it
was all right with them. At least,
they formally recorded tHeir appro
bation. It's inconceivable that they
could actually sanction the loss of a
third of their territory, especially
when it's their greatest enemy, Rus
sia, who wins the ground.
»Jt * *
generations the Poles and the
Slavs have been bitter enemies.
Pierre Poland, the middleman of
Europe, has despised Russia far
more than she has feared Germany.
Since the eighteenth century when
the Russian Bear engineered the
first partition of Poland, relations
between the two nations have never
been chummy. It must be a par
ticularly bleak defeat, to have the
great power from across the chan
nel, the saviour of the Polish people,
their champion in time of distress,
finally agree to a slashing, radical
partition of the land they vowed to
support.
Of course. Chamberlain and
Viscount Halifax, British foreign
trouble-shooter, had a tech
nicality to hide behind. Richard
Austen Butler, parliamentary un
dersecretary for foreign affairs,
told the House yesterday that the
Anglo-Polish military alliance
signed just before the outbreak of
the war, contained no provision re
quiring Britain to defend the
Poles against invasion by the So
viet Union.
Underneath the surface, though,
England is plainly afraid of Russia.
She'd hate to antagonize the Soviets
any further, and she's in favor of
any deal that will help to retain
Russian good will for the English.

(JOT, last night while England gave
away part of Poland, she signed
a strategic treaty with Turkey,
guardian of the Dardanelles. And,
moving with quick certainty, Ger
many tonight delivered an implied
warning to Turkey after the latter's
signing the tri-power pact. Strategic
ally of Germany during the World
War, Turkey has swerved away
from her professed desire for neu
trality. And it may mean severe re
percussions in the Balkans.
The foreign minister of Ruma

agreement with England and

an obvious interest in preserving
Rumanian neutrality, and Russia
has given assurances regarding the
country's territorial integrity.

that Germany and Russia will en

co-operation "in all fields" — an
