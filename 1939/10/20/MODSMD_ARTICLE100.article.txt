# Breakers Win Over Theta Xi
## 
### 
Once again defaults reigned su
preme in the intramural grid pic
ture as only two out of six sched
uled contests were played.
With Gallegher in the starring
role, Breakers rode rough-shod
over a hapless Theta Xi outfit to
bring home the bacon by a 3 to 0
score. In the only other game play
ed, the high-riding Sigma Chis turn
ed on the heat and ran away from
El Cuadro, 32-0.
Last night's volleyball games were
postponed because of a mistake in
the schedule. The postponed games
will be played next week.
