# Bruin, Indian Water Poloists Vie Tomorrow
## Frosh Tilt, Diving Exhibition to Share Encina Pool Slate 
### 
A black question mark loomed out
of the brightness of a sky painted
confident - blue by Coach Nort
Thornton yesterday when Bill
Bleecker and Davo Nottage, first -
string forwards on the Stanford wa
ter polo team, were absent from
practice.
Although Bleecker's absence was
believed to be "just one of those
things," Thornton fears Nottage may
be suffering from a pulled tendon in
his thigh. Possibilities of the losses
loomed before the U.C.L.A. game to
morrow at 1:15 o'clock when Thorn
ton presents a "water carnival"
which will consist of exhibition div
ing by Howie Adams and a freshman
game against the Central Y.M.CA.
of San Francisco.
SAME LINEUP DUE
Unless something serious proves
to be the reason for the stars'- ab
sence, the same siring will be shot
at U.C.L.A. tomorow as was vic
torious against San Jose State and
the Athens Club.
That will include Captain Bob
Plate, sprint; Bleecker and Nottage,
forwards; Bob Allen, center back;
Dick Hoover and Ted Moreno,
guards; and either Frank Dowling or
Bill Burns, goalie. In the latter pair
of goal guards, Thornton has the
best two on the coast, he believes. It
makes it especially tough to choose
the starter and Thornton is with
holding his answer until game time.
BRUINS ALSO STRONG
The Bruins will also throw an all
star outfit into the Encina waters.
John (Red) Siegel and John Mitchell
will be the forwards; Revere Chris
tianson, sprint; Frank Kelsey, cen
ter back; Captain Paul Crawley and
Bob Lawhead, guards; and Bob Orr,
goalie.
The game will be over in time so
that sport followers will be able to
watch the frosh football game as
well as the "water carnival."
