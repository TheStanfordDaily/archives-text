## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 19 (UP).â€”Presi
dent Sam Breadon of the Cardinals
said today that outfielder Joe Med
wick, highest paid player on the
roster of the resurgent Gas House
Gang, is definitely on the trading
block.
Breadon, who heretofore has
maintained strict silence on nu
merous reports his star outfielder
and hitting ace would be playing
for some other National League club
next season, said he would be glad
to make a deal with Medwick as
bait.
