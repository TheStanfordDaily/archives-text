# Ascent of the Damned

### 
STANFORD prides* itself on being civilized.
There are times when its degree of civili
zation reaches such heights that it lapses into
mere bored disinterestednessâ€”when only 575
out of a student body of 4,200 vote in an elec
tion, for instance.
However, despite such slips toward decadent
ennui, and belying the somewhat uncultivated
terrain on which it is located, Stanford has de
veloped a far more mature, cultured point of
view than most universities.
The most uncivilized aspect of American un
dergraduate life is, and always has been, the
tradition of hazing in all of its varied aspects.
Physical abuse of freshmen, class battles, and
initiations into honor societies all have been
discarded at Stanford. And only the fraternity
initiation period lives on.
Perhaps the chief reason for the perpetuation
of this institution is the fact the houses are
connected with national organizations which
insist on Hell-week's being continued. Perhaps
it is because those who received the beatings
the year before never will be satisfied until they
have had their turn to beat.
At any rate, Hell-week at Stanford is not
what it used to be.
To protect itself from University criticism
of the falling grades of sophomore fraternity
members and the rising number of cases at the
Men's Health Service, Interfraternity Council
has established a series of regulations for the
pre-initiation period that the houses are pledged
to observe.
Activities outside of the houses and off cam
pus have been reduced to a minimum, being
allowed only where they are required by fra
ternity rulings. The "week" now runs only
from Thursday through Sunday. And the primi
tive ordeals that sophomores had to face a few
years ago have been abolished.
Proponents of the fraternity initiation claim
that it is the only effective means of uniting
the pledges with the indivisible brotherhood.
Critics consider it an infantile, awkward bow to
some of man's less admirable instincts.
Despite these arguments, this week-end is the
pre-initiation period for Stanford fraternities.
But Hell is beginning to look more like Pur
gatory.
