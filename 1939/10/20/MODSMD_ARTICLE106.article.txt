DID you ever notice the Library steps at five
o'clock?
Probably not. Nobody goes into the building
at that time, and everyone who hurries out is
thinking too intently about dinner to look
around him.
A person who happened to glance at the
steps at the end of the day might be slightly
surprised, even a little disgusted. They are
covered with a carpet of cigarette butts—hardly
an appetizing sight.
The situation might be rectified by having a
corps of janitors sweep the Library steps at
regular intervals throughout the day.
But, perhaps it would be more convenient for
everyone concerned if a number of stone ash
receptacles, filled with sand, were placed in
front of the building.
With these as gentle, but effective reminders
that students should take pride in keeping their
campus clean, the Library steps need no longer
be cause for the casual observer to wonder
when the can-can girls go into their dance.
