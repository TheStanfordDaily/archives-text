SOMEHOW, Stanford's reputation in drama
does not come up to the size of Memorial
Hall.
The drama department has disclosed from
time to time that this University possesses, in
the way of buildings and equipment, the big
gest college drama plant in the country.
Publicity releases on tonight's "Great Divide"
have observed that the Memorial Theater stage
is one of the few in the United States that are
adequate for staging such a sweeping drama
of the West as will be offered tonight.
The plant seems to be here—but where is
the drama to go with it?
Surely the human material must be present in
a university of the size and reputation of Stan
ford. Out of a student body of over 4,000 it
seems reasonable to expect that there will be
enough competent actors and stage artisans to
make any production effective.
Since the theater is built, and since it must
be paid for, the best course is obviously for the
University to use its equipment in the best pos

sible manner. It is a case of putting effort into
fine dramatic production, or admitting that the
theater should never have been built at all.
The Stanford drama season for 1939-40 will
start tonight. It will start under new manage
ment.
The opening will be an attempt to demon
strate that Stanford can do fine things in drama;
things fine enough to justify the enormous
plant. There is no reason why this University
cannot some day lead the nation's colleges in
the dramatic arts.
That is, if it is remembered by those in charge
that red plush seats and velvet drapes do not
make a theater.-»-J. B.
