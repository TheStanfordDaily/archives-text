### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
MY DEAR, IT'S STRAIGHT FROM PAKIS
clothing manufacturers change the styles
every year to make sure that people buy clothes
oftener than they need them. But I am convinced
that if the merchants didn't change our minds about
fashions, we would do it ourselves. It's such fun! Es
pecially for the women.
Today's fashion edition of The Daily has caused
quite a stir, believe me. After all, one simply must be
up on "what they're wearing." Otherwise, one is just
out of things, isn't one?
Well now, you really ought to see the new crea
tions this fall. They are just divine! Do you know the
fashion editor told me just this morning that evening
gowns are coming in an exciting new color —danger-
red, they call it. Danger red, for those of you who
aren't up on your Vogue, is midway between stop-red
and cardinal. Isn't that thrilling?
$ # *
A ND oh, the jewelry! Back to the gold standard, you
know. And sort of large, too. It harmonizes so
well with this year's "covered girl." (Evening gowns
will not be revealing.) And of course the coiflures will
fit it with all that just too too well. Straight-combed
high affairs, giving the 1929 girl—guess what? Glam
our! Yes glamour is the thing this year The flapper
type will be very much in the eclipse. And you know,
those classic glamour girls are really lovely. I always
did say they'd go back to conservative, really beau
tiful ensembles. It's all so aristocratic.
Of course there is just one thing I don't like about
these changes. I used to just love those organdy af
fairs in that restrained color, sea-spray. But then, how
can a girl be glamorous in sea-spray? Well, I'll tell you
I just don't know. That's another thing about fashions.
They are so complex. Why, it takes half a person's
waking hours to really know what's what. But it
does give one something to talk about at luncheons.
Danger-red superseding sea-spray. There's a nice
harmonious topic to go with tea and dainty cakes.
All in all in fact, it must be confessed that the
fashion edition of The Daily is doing its part in a
great social movement. Fashions are more useful than
most of us think. They bring prosperity to the cloth
ing stores; they give us lots to talk about at teas,
and conversation at teas can really be a big problem,
even if you are never so socially graceful. And be
sides all that, doesn't it really take elegance in clothes
to capture the natural loveliness of a glamour girl?
Thank Heaven gentlemen still prefer cords!

and conversation at teas can really be a big problem,
even if you are never so socially graceful. And be
sides all that, doesn't it really take elegance in clothes
to capture the natural loveliness of a glamour girl?
Thank Heaven gentlemen still prefer cords!
MY DEAR, IT'S STRAIGHT FROM PAKIS
clothing manufacturers change the styles
every year to make sure that people buy clothes
oftener than they need them. But I am convinced
that if the merchants didn't change our minds about
fashions, we would do it ourselves. It's such fun! Es
pecially for the women.
Today's fashion edition of The Daily has caused
quite a stir, believe me. After all, one simply must be
up on "what they're wearing." Otherwise, one is just
out of things, isn't one?
Well now, you really ought to see the new crea
tions this fall. They are just divine! Do you know the
fashion editor told me just this morning that evening
gowns are coming in an exciting new color —danger-
red, they call it. Danger red, for those of you who
aren't up on your Vogue, is midway between stop-red
and cardinal. Isn't that thrilling?

A ND oh, the jewelry! Back to the gold standard, you
know. And sort of large, too. It harmonizes so
well with this year's "covered girl." (Evening gowns
will not be revealing.) And of course the coiflures will
fit it with all that just too too well. Straight-combed
high affairs, giving the 1929 girl—guess what? Glam
our! Yes glamour is the thing this year The flapper
type will be very much in the eclipse. And you know,
those classic glamour girls are really lovely. I always
did say they'd go back to conservative, really beau
tiful ensembles. It's all so aristocratic.
Of course there is just one thing I don't like about
these changes. I used to just love those organdy af
fairs in that restrained color, sea-spray. But then, how
can a girl be glamorous in sea-spray? Well, I'll tell you
I just don't know. That's another thing about fashions.
They are so complex. Why, it takes half a person's
waking hours to really know what's what. But it
does give one something to talk about at luncheons.
Danger-red superseding sea-spray. There's a nice
harmonious topic to go with tea and dainty cakes.
All in all in fact, it must be confessed that the
fashion edition of The Daily is doing its part in a
great social movement. Fashions are more useful than
most of us think. They bring prosperity to the cloth
ing stores; they give us lots to talk about at teas,
and conversation at teas can really be a big problem,
even if you are never so socially graceful. And be
sides all that, doesn't it really take elegance in clothes
to capture the natural loveliness of a glamour girl?
