# CAMPUS OPINION
## QUITE DISPASSIONATELY 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
Now that the disputed meeting of the A.S.U.
has finally been cancelled, we should like to take this
opportunity to state, quite dispassionately, some of the
facts of the case which, apparently, are not yet clear
to the staff of The Daily and to the student body.
The motives of the A.S.U. in its attempt to present
forum discussions, now and in the past, do not seem
to have been appreciated. In this attempt we have
thought to further the cause of university education,
giving to those who attend the meetings the chance
to hear current issues discussed by conflicting au
thorities and to demand information from the speakers.
The charge of sensationalism which has been
brought against the A.S.U. is justified only inasmuch
as the current issues of today have, in themselves, a
quality of sensationalism for those who seek it.
When The Daily declares that the meeting proposed
for this week had as its aim only an increase of mem
bership for the A.S.U., it grossly overemphasizes a
minor consideration in our plans.
* * * *
pROFESSOR ROBINSON has been quoted in The
Daily as saying that the Stanford A.S.U. is largely
disorganized; he is said to have "divulged" the fact
that only two men of a six-man executive committee
were able to keep an appointment with him. The
A.S.U., we feel, is disorganized only to the extent that
many of last year's members have graduated from
school. Its organization, in practice, has been highly
active and efficient in its work with the A.S.U. Book
Exchange and in planning its program for the year.
Only two members of the Executive Committee of the
A.S.U. kept the appointment with Dr. Robinson be
cause only thi-ee members had made the appointment
in the first place and the health service will certify
that one of them was ill.
Now to discuss the obscure details of the contro
versy:
The Daily implies with great vehemence that the
members of the A.S.U. do not support the actions of
the executive committee. The Daily has been unable
to give us the names of those members, and they,
themselves, have not yet complained.
# * * #
AS TO the actual request which the A.S.U. made to
the Committee on Public Exercises, its has not
been clearly interpreted by The Daily. In Wednesday's
issue was this statement: "The A.S.U. has lost only the
privilege of holding a meeting open to the off-campus
public." The A.S.U. would like to disclaim, here and
now, any desire for the interest of the oIT-campus
public. What we did ask and what, we were finally
denied was the privilege of holding a meeting open to
the entire student body.
When that privilege was denied, we were not in the
"awkward situation" which The Daily describes with
so much pathos. We were not embarrassed by the
need of breaking the news (o Mr. •Schneiderman, who
had accepted our invitation, because Mr. Schneider
man knew in advance that his appearance here was
subject to the approval of the University.
We regret that the University did not see fit to
grant our request for this meeting; we are planning
further meetings on other vital issues. And we hope
that the student body of Stanford will have the oppor
tunity to hear these future discussions.

disorganized; he is said to have "divulged" the fact
that only two men of a six-man executive committee
were able to keep an appointment with him. The
A.S.U., we feel, is disorganized only to the extent that
many of last year's members have graduated from
school. Its organization, in practice, has been highly
active and efficient in its work with the A.S.U. Book
Exchange and in planning its program for the year.
Only two members of the Executive Committee of the
A.S.U. kept the appointment with Dr. Robinson be
cause only thi-ee members had made the appointment
in the first place and the health service will certify
that one of them was ill.
Now to discuss the obscure details of the contro
versy:
The Daily implies with great vehemence that the
members of the A.S.U. do not support the actions of
the executive committee. The Daily has been unable
to give us the names of those members, and they,
themselves, have not yet complained.
# * * #
AS TO the actual request which the A.S.U. made to
the Committee on Public Exercises, its has not
been clearly interpreted by The Daily. In Wednesday's
issue was this statement: "The A.S.U. has lost only the
privilege of holding a meeting open to the off-campus
public." The A.S.U. would like to disclaim, here and
now, any desire for the interest of the oIT-campus
public. What we did ask and what, we were finally
denied was the privilege of holding a meeting open to
the entire student body.
When that privilege was denied, we were not in the
"awkward situation" which The Daily describes with
so much pathos. We were not embarrassed by the
need of breaking the news (o Mr. •Schneiderman, who
had accepted our invitation, because Mr. Schneider
man knew in advance that his appearance here was
subject to the approval of the University.
We regret that the University did not see fit to
grant our request for this meeting; we are planning
further meetings on other vital issues. And we hope
that the student body of Stanford will have the oppor
tunity to hear these future discussions.

EDITOR, SIR:
Now that the disputed meeting of the A.S.U.
has finally been cancelled, we should like to take this
opportunity to state, quite dispassionately, some of the
facts of the case which, apparently, are not yet clear
to the staff of The Daily and to the student body.
The motives of the A.S.U. in its attempt to present
forum discussions, now and in the past, do not seem
to have been appreciated. In this attempt we have
thought to further the cause of university education,
giving to those who attend the meetings the chance
to hear current issues discussed by conflicting au
thorities and to demand information from the speakers.
The charge of sensationalism which has been
brought against the A.S.U. is justified only inasmuch
as the current issues of today have, in themselves, a
quality of sensationalism for those who seek it.
When The Daily declares that the meeting proposed
for this week had as its aim only an increase of mem
bership for the A.S.U., it grossly overemphasizes a
minor consideration in our plans.
