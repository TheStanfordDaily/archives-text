# Happy End Ruins Movie Version of 'Golden Boy'

"GOLDEN BOY," now showing at the Stanford Theater.
The Reviewer thumbed through his pocket copy of "How to Review a
Moving Picture" until he came to "Plots—Transferred to Screen from
Stage."
"Very often," it said, "plays that have had tremendous success on the
New York stage suffer in transit when placed on the silver screen."
That, in a nutshell, is what is the matter with one of the season's most
touted pictures. When Odets wrote the original, the fighter Joe Bonaparte
A.took his girl, car, and musical ambi-

tions, reduced them all to one com
mon denominator by hitting a tree.
Not so with Columbia Pictures mo
guls; they pressed button A, and pro
duced the formula "papa-I've-come
home" ending that's bound to let you
down.
The new star, William Holden, who
plays the title role, suffers from poor
lighting and general awkwardness
but is very ably supported by vet
erans Barbara Stanwyck and
Adolphe Menjou. Miss Stanwyck is
her usual smooth self as the gal from
Newark, and the minor roles are
capably filled by William Strauss as
Joe's father, and the sinister Joseph
Calleia as Fresillo the gangster.
YOUNG FIGHTER
The story in brief concerns a
young fighter who gives up his first
love, the violin, for the brighter
lights and better pay of the ring.
Against his father's wishes and fi
nally those of his manager's girl, he
climbs from the tank-town circuits
to the Garden, only to kill a man in
the ring. With a broken hand, he
finds his carefully planned world
broken at his feet.
Also on the program .is a Joe E.
Brown and Martha Raye picture, for
those who like Joe E. Brown and
Martha Raye pictures.—Littleboy
