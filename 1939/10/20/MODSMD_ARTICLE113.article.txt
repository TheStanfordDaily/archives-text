### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19 (UP).â€”
Clyde Schleiper and Wes Carroll,
Long Beach pilots, said tonight they
feel like flying "indefinitely" in their
tiny seaplane above Rosamond Dry
Lake, near Lancaster.
The flyers were nearing 500 hours
in the air in an endurance attempt
which already was well past the 343-
hour record for previous light planes.
Almost 21 days aloft, they hoped to
break the heavy plane record of 30
days set by Fred and A1 Key of
Meridian, Miss., in 1935.
