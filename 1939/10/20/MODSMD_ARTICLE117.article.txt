### 
SAN DIEGO, Oct. I<J (UP).—Two
Navy dive bombers flew into a fog
bank over Black Mountain today
and, apparently losing their place in
formation, collided killing their four
occupants. The planes were engaged
in routine training maneuvers in a
squadron of 12, all carrying practice
bombs.
A construction company crew
working in the remote area said the
bombers were flying unusually low
this morning between EI Cajon and
Mission Valley, and that as they
disappeared in the fog the two planes
crashed together. The workers said
they heard an explosion and then
saw flames illuminating the sky.
The dead were identified by naval
officers as Ensign Theodore Smith,
24, of Kansas City, Mo.; Ensign Har
old R. Pence, 22, of Hillsboro, 111.;
Aviation Chief Ordnanceman Ed
ward Eakins, 22, of San Bernardino,
and Radioman Leland E. Hall, 23, of
San Diego.
