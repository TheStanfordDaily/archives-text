# Row to Initiate New Members Over Week-end
## Formal Ceremonies To Be Completed On Sunday Evening 
### 
Approximately 350 pledges of
Stanford's 24 fraternities will be
initiated into their organizations
this week-end, Interfraternity Coun
cil disclosed yesterday.
Until a year ago, individual fra
ternities held their own initiations
at their convenience. But, in order
to co-operate with the University
administration in its drive for higher
scholarship along the Row, Inter
fraternity Council last year set aside
a certain date for all fraternity ini
tiations and established uniform reg
ulations.
Pre-initiation period started yes
terday morning in all the houses and
formal initiation ceremonies will be
concluded by Sunday evening, it was
learned.
An innovation this year is the offi
cial report each house president
mast make to Interfraternity Board
concerning the pre-initiation pro
gram of his group.
Bob Moulton, Council president,
has announced that all activities of
the period should be confined to the
inside of or in close proximity to
the individual houses, "as far as
possible." Moulton's suggestion is in
keeping with the recommendation of
last year's pre-initiation committee.
