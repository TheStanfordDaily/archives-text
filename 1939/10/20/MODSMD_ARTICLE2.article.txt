door or by telephoning Chester
Barker, secretary of the Division of
Speech and Drama. All seats are
50 cents, reserved. The play will be
given again tomorrow night.
Stanford's Division of Speech and
Drama will open its 1939-40 season
tonight at 8:15 o'clock in Memorial
Hall when William Vaughn Moody's
"The Great Divide" will be pre
sented for the first time on the
campus since 1916.
Famed in the annals of American
drama, the play was first produced
in 190(5 under the title of "The Sa
bine Woman." Later in the same
year, Moody rewrote the play and
titled it "The Great Divide." In the
original cast were Henry Miller as
Stephen Ghent, Margaret Anglin as
Ruth Jordan, and Laura Hope
Crewes as Polly Jordan.
REGNERY TO PLAY GHENT
David Regnery, who will play
the Ghent part in the Farm version
of the play, has never appeared on
the Memorial Hall stage. His last
appearance in a Stanford production
was as the young poet in "This Side
Idolatry," which had its American
premier in the old theater.
The Margaret Anglin role is to be
played by Betty Howe, a transfer
from Mills College. Sylvia Onesti,
well known for her work on the
technical side of Memorial Hall
plays, is to be Polly Jordan.
Others in the cast include: Clifford
Hamar as Philip Jordan, Norman
Ross as Winthrop Newbury, John
High as Dr. Newbury, Merle Mea
cham as Lon Anderson, Aubrey Aus
tin as Dutch, Robert O'Neill as
Shorty, David Jackman as Burt Wil
liams, Tom O'Leary as the architect,
Edward Arnold as the contractor,
Robert Preble as the boy, and Flor
ence Haslett as Mrs. Jordan.
OUTSTANDING SET
The play has three sets, the most
outstanding of which is an outdoor
scene on the rim of a canyon in the
Southwest. Everett Glass, formerly
of the University of California, is
directing the performance. It will
mark his initial production here at
Stanford.
Tickets may be secured at the
door or by telephoning Chester
Barker, secretary of the Division of
Speech and Drama. All seats are
50 cents, reserved. The play will be
given again tomorrow night.
