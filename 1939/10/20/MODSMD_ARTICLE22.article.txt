# Allies Sign Turkey, Drive First Real Political Blow At Soviet-German Front
## Mutual Assistance Pact Will Run 15 Years, Give Allies Privileges in Dardanelles; Italy Loses in Deal 
### United Press 
Great Itrilain and France achieved their first real diplomatic victory of
the war Thursday by snatching strategically situated Turkey away from
Germany and Soviet Russia.
The Allies made their first dent in the armor of the Nazi-Soviet work
ing arrangement by signing a limite/ pact of mutual assistance with the

Turks, who were a vital ally of
Germany in the World War and are
guardians of the fortified Darda
nelles.
The signing of the pact, which is
to run for 15 years, was a sharp blow
for Moscow and Berlin and the Nazi
reaction was angry and threatening
toward the Turks.
It was significant Turkey obtained
a loophole whereby she cannot be
compelled to go to war against Rus
sia regardless of whether the war
spreads to Eastern Europe.
The British and French pact with
Turkey does not affect the war in
its present form. But if Britain and
France fought to defend Rumania or
Greece against aggression — except,
by Russia- the Turks would be
brought into the war.
AIMED AGAINST ITALY
The new alliance is aimed against
still-neutral Italy more than any
other single power and sets up a
means for mutual defense in the
eastern Mediterranean.
The tii-power pact appeared to
have shattered efforts of Josef V.
Stalin and Germany to close the
Dardanelles and the Black Sea to
Allied warships. British and French
warships in the Black Sea might cuL
the new Soviet-German trade route
and prevent such war materials as
oil and manganese from reaching
Adolf Hitler's armies.
At the same time, Soviet Premier
and Foreign Commissar Viacheslav
M. Molotov exchanged assurances
with Turkey's Foreign Minister Su
kru Saracoglu of the "unvarying
friendship" which each of the Black
Sea nations holds for the other.
GERMAN-SOVIET WEDGE
There seemed to he ample reason
fo believe Britain and France would
use their new pact with Turkey as a
wedge in efforts to split the German-
Soviet combination. Britain never
showed any real anger at Russia's
invasion of eastern Poland.
It was understood furthermore
that the new Polish government es
tablished in France has agreed that,
when the Allied "war aims" are
achieved and Poland is resurrected
as a sovereign nation there will be
no demand for the Polish territories
seized by Russia.
Italy was uncertain whether to
cheer or groan as a result of the
Anglo - French - Turkish pact. The
Italians were pleased at the pros
pect. of a barrier being thrown up
against communism in the Balkans
but they recognized that a potential
war bloc was being erected against,
Italy in her own eastern Mediter
ranean domain.
On the western front the French
were said to have abandoned Ger
man soil and fallen back to their own
without a major battJe. The Ger
man high command indicated it has
no intention of pushing the war onto
French territory.
The P rench high command re
ported that, German patrols were ac
tive in the Warndt Forest near Saar
bruecken, moving through driving
rain and stiff wind in an effort to
complete flic banishment, of the
French from German soil.
The traditionally neutral nations
of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and
Finland concluded a two-day con
ference at Stockholm with a reaffir
mation of their strict neutrality and
support for Finland's stubborn bar
gaining with Soviet Russia oti the
latter's demands.

invasion of eastern Poland.
It was understood furthermore
that the new Polish government es
tablished in France has agreed that,
when the Allied "war aims" are
achieved and Poland is resurrected
as a sovereign nation there will be
no demand for the Polish territories
seized by Russia.
Italy was uncertain whether to
cheer or groan as a result of the
Anglo - French - Turkish pact. The
Italians were pleased at the pros
pect. of a barrier being thrown up
against communism in the Balkans
but they recognized that a potential
war bloc was being erected against,
Italy in her own eastern Mediter
ranean domain.
On the western front the French
were said to have abandoned Ger
man soil and fallen back to their own
without a major battJe. The Ger
man high command indicated it has
no intention of pushing the war onto
French territory.
The P rench high command re
ported that, German patrols were ac
tive in the Warndt Forest near Saar
bruecken, moving through driving
rain and stiff wind in an effort to
complete flic banishment, of the
French from German soil.
The traditionally neutral nations
of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and
Finland concluded a two-day con
ference at Stockholm with a reaffir
mation of their strict neutrality and
support for Finland's stubborn bar
gaining with Soviet Russia oti the
latter's demands.
Great Itrilain and France achieved their first real diplomatic victory of
the war Thursday by snatching strategically situated Turkey away from
Germany and Soviet Russia.
The Allies made their first dent in the armor of the Nazi-Soviet work
ing arrangement by signing a limite/ pact of mutual assistance with the

Turks, who were a vital ally of
Germany in the World War and are
guardians of the fortified Darda
nelles.
The signing of the pact, which is
to run for 15 years, was a sharp blow
for Moscow and Berlin and the Nazi
reaction was angry and threatening
toward the Turks.
It was significant Turkey obtained
a loophole whereby she cannot be
compelled to go to war against Rus
sia regardless of whether the war
spreads to Eastern Europe.
The British and French pact with
Turkey does not affect the war in
its present form. But if Britain and
France fought to defend Rumania or
Greece against aggression — except,
by Russia- the Turks would be
brought into the war.
AIMED AGAINST ITALY
The new alliance is aimed against
still-neutral Italy more than any
other single power and sets up a
means for mutual defense in the
eastern Mediterranean.
The tii-power pact appeared to
have shattered efforts of Josef V.
Stalin and Germany to close the
Dardanelles and the Black Sea to
Allied warships. British and French
warships in the Black Sea might cuL
the new Soviet-German trade route
and prevent such war materials as
oil and manganese from reaching
Adolf Hitler's armies.
At the same time, Soviet Premier
and Foreign Commissar Viacheslav
M. Molotov exchanged assurances
with Turkey's Foreign Minister Su
kru Saracoglu of the "unvarying
friendship" which each of the Black
Sea nations holds for the other.
GERMAN-SOVIET WEDGE
There seemed to he ample reason
fo believe Britain and France would
use their new pact with Turkey as a
wedge in efforts to split the German-
Soviet combination. Britain never
showed any real anger at Russia's
invasion of eastern Poland.
