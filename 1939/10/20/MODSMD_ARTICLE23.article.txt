# Coeds Spurn Decollete For Formals
## New Cover-up Trend Achieved by Jackets, Evening Sweaters 
### 
Clothes don't make the co-ed—
bin they make a big difference in
the way she looks. And though she
trudges around the Quad looking
like a proverbial "drip" on week
days, there isn't a Stanford woman
who doesn't want to look her best on
a Saturday night.
For real dressed-up and formal
occasions, there's plenty of oppor
tunity. Heavy satins, regal bro
cades, flowing chiffons and draped
jerseys in the stores this fall take one j
back to the days when it was fun
to "doll-up and parade around like I
mother."
The college girl has grasped with
glee the new bustle styles—because,
after all, when you're dancing, most
people see you from the back. In
fact the back-interest trend is the |
main innovation this fall, and many j
•of the frocks look like last year's
pre ttiest formal with a rear-bow or
gadget.
ADD 1!)40 INFLUENCE
That should give budget-pinching
lassies an idea. One of those simple, ;
basic formal dresses which was
worn last year with a bolero, looks
quite 1940 when perked up with an
embroidered evening sweater or a
little brocade or taffeta jacket which
swoops down in back with a well- j
placed ruffle or a bow. You 11 see
them in Paly shop windows. And
there's a wonderful matletex, or
lastex - shirred long - sleeved velvet
number that zips up the front and
fits like a bathing suit.
Don't worry about your formal not
being decollete—because the "cov
ered woman" is the rage. The idea
this year is to be subtle, with discreet
draped or fitted dresses suggesting,
rather than ob"iously flaunting,
feminine charms.
GADGETS, ETC.
There's a little evening gadget at
one of the San Francisco stores 1
which practically no one is going to j
be able to resist. It's a bracelet and
necklace set, which at first looks
like simple crystal-colored celluloid
chains. But there's a little cluster of
tiny silver clips or tongs at the neck
and wrist, and into each of these fits
a fresh blossom. There's nothing
more flattering than such a lei of
natural flowers, and white, lavender,
pink, or blue can be varied to suit
the mood of the evening. This set
can be worn with either a low-cut
or high-necked dress to equal ad
vantage.
Separate evening skirts are in
expensive, and they come in many
kinds of crepe, jersey, or even velvet.
Some styles fit-like-a-glove at the
waist through the use of the increas
ingly popular matletex shirring.
High-necked jersey blouses come
with long or short sleeves, in every
color, and can be varied with any
sort of costume jewelry. These
blouses are so simple that they can
be worn with everything from a
matching or contrasting evening skirt
to a street-length wool or jei'sey
.skirt or even slacks or tennis shorts.
Hoopskirts and straplesses are still
being shown in some stores for those
who cling to last year's favorite.
Front fullness, with perhaps a "dutch
boy" effect with front pockets, makes
an attractive and acceptable varia
tion from the almost over-common
bustle.
Striking and "different" is a wool
jersey sweater-top with a plaid wool
bustle - backed skirt in evening
length. Stanford women, however,
will probably prefer more feminine
styles in the evening, and it is quite
possible that the men have quite
enough of the classic sweater-and
skirt combine on the Quad.
