# Practical Ski Togs Lead This Season
## 
### 
When a Stanford woman joins the
Ski Club cavalcade to Yosemite on
winter week-ends, clothes to suit
the occasion will be her most vital
concern. Whether she's an expert
on the slalom runs or just attempt
ing her first snow plows, this year
she'll be dressing for practicality.
The fancy weaves and "pretty" ac
cessories used when skiing was new
to college students are definitely out.
Clothing for warmth is being stress
ed and smartness is added through
line and cut.
The feminine skier's togs will
approach men's styles as nearly as
possible, and uniform colors will
prevent the novice from being dis
tinguished by her dress.
