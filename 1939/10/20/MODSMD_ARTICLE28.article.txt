# Dressy Suit Usurps Dress In New Campus Wardrobe
## 
### 
II used to be that "indispensable black dress" but now it's that "indis
pensable dressy suit.' This year the dressy suit is the basis of a college
wardrobe.
r lhe most popular fabrics for these outfits seem to be velveteen and
light - weight w 001. The faverita color is black; but there are also some

good looking checked materials that<
are now popular. i
The bustle has greatly influenced
.suits only so far as to create the
proper silhouette. The coats are
drawn sharply in at the waist and
i then flair out into a sort of ruffle.
COLLARS NOT SHOWN
The necks of the suits are for the
1 most, round, with or without collars.
Few suits with open necks are being
! shown.
Variety is achieved by buttons.
Unusual effects can be created with
| the use of odd buttons of metal or
leather replacing the usual cloth
i bound ones.
Skirts are wide and flaring but
tight at the waist, so that the cur-
I rently popular hourglass effect is
I achieved.
SKIRTS ARE FLARED
The smarter woolen .suits have just
j the plain full skirt with a tight
bodiced jacket and without the
i bustle effect. Some of the smart ones
i also have a loose box coat buttoning
j up the front.
j The whole outfit can be made to
look entirely different by adding a
| fluffy lingerie collar of lace or linen.
They can also be worn with delicate
j blouses and jewelry.
Quad suits run mostly to plaids
i and tweeds in all colors, doting on
I brown and green.

light - weight w 001. The faverita color is black; but there are also some

good looking checked materials that<
are now popular. i
The bustle has greatly influenced
.suits only so far as to create the
proper silhouette. The coats are
drawn sharply in at the waist and
i then flair out into a sort of ruffle.
COLLARS NOT SHOWN
The necks of the suits are for the
1 most, round, with or without collars.
Few suits with open necks are being
! shown.
Variety is achieved by buttons.
Unusual effects can be created with
| the use of odd buttons of metal or
leather replacing the usual cloth
i bound ones.
Skirts are wide and flaring but
tight at the waist, so that the cur-
I rently popular hourglass effect is
I achieved.
SKIRTS ARE FLARED
The smarter woolen .suits have just
j the plain full skirt with a tight
bodiced jacket and without the
i bustle effect. Some of the smart ones
i also have a loose box coat buttoning
j up the front.
j The whole outfit can be made to
look entirely different by adding a
| fluffy lingerie collar of lace or linen.
They can also be worn with delicate
j blouses and jewelry.
Quad suits run mostly to plaids
i and tweeds in all colors, doting on
I brown and green.
BUTTON S FEA TU RE!>
i Sport suits that feature jackets
| buttoning all the way up. have made
I a particular hit. Tailored jackets are
j still holding their own.
I Wonderful effects are made with
I striped and plaid wools with short
| box jackets. These jackets are par
| ticularly good when they are open a
I little way from the top.
It is also considered smart to mix
I suits of the same colors, wearing the
plain skirt with the plaid jacket and
vice versa.
