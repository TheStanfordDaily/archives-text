Fashion this season has drawn no
lines on possible fabrics—anything '
goes so long as it lends itself to the I
tight waist, the bustle, and the gen
era! effect of charming femininity.
Style magazines will tell you that
this i.s a velvet year, but heavy faille
and several rayon fabrics are equally
important. For evening and after
| noon wear they adapt themselves
beautifully to the hour-glas: silhou
ette.
But the list doesn't end here. At
dressy occasions both on and off
campus there will be plenty of in
terest in taffeta, brocade, lame, satin,
velveteen, and even wool. Some of
, the loveliest evening wraps, party
dresses, and afternoon dresses are
being made of flannel and jersey.
Street clothes are utilizing many
of these same fabrics, with the em
i phasis, of course, on wools and flan
' nels. Crepe of both rayon and silk
and any number of interesting rayon
novelty fabrics are extremely im
portant.
Sports clothes are stressing wool,
flannel, and broadcolth with these
i same materials starring in the field
of the "little suit." Winter coats are
! chiefly of heavy wool with several
interesting weaves making an ap
pearance. Herringbone worsted is
coming into some prominence as a
material for both suits anu coats.
