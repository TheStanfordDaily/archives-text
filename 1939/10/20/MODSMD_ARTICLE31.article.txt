# Hairbows Supplant Hats for Campus
## 
### 
In the main the Stanford lass con
lines her campus headgear to bobbie
pins and hairbows; an occasional
bonnet is evidenced at teas or in
formal dances, but otherwise they
are conspicuous in their absence from
L'Omelette to the movie in Red-
I wood City.
But the city â€” there's a different
story. You may take it off after the
first dance, but four times out of
i five you'll be wearing a hat to com
plete your outfit wljen you start for
i the Fairmont or the "Frantic." And
your date may laugh, but with the
; new bustle-trend in hats, at least
, they won't be sticking in his eye this
I year!
