# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
There's nothing fashionable about Farm factions; last year I'aris an
nounced the upswept coiffure, but Farm women didn't hear because their
hair was covering their ears.
This year Vogue's pages have bristled with bustles, but Farm women
read their weather reports and are still emphasizing the W.A.A. figure.

Try as the fashion experts do
sell us "the newest thing for cam
pus wear," women come on the!
Stanford campus only to find prac
ticality a traditional fad. And tra
dition, well . . .
Stanford conforms to fashion as
long as fashion will string along
with Stanford. Here ski Its go from,
long to short, and full to slim with
the swing of fashion's pendulum;
but Braemer and Brooks go on
iorever.
Newcomers who arrived with
trunks stuffed to department store
window specifications have already
relegated knee-length socks and
such to the bottom bureau drawer
along with the galoshes their moth
ers made them bring. They have ac
cepted Quad classics along with the
Cellar and the Stanford rough.
Nonconformists can't wear high
heels and classroom glamour with
the smile bravely held for Mademoi
selle photographers. So they must
leave their glamour to the evening
hours and concentrate on native
charm in Quad clothes.
For these reasons, this issue, de
voted to fashion, will concentrate

not on what Paris dictates, but on!
what Farm women are actually
wearing. After all, there is no use
in knowing what you should be'
wearing according to the authorities,
if you just don't wear it.
