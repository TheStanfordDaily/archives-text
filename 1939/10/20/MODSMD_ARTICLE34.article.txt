# Kleenex Outmodes Old Style Hankie
## 
### 
With the advent of Kleenex, hand
kerchiefs have become almost a lost
commodity and a drag on the market.
Some of these obsolete articles are
still in use, however. During a re
cent survey it was found that most
college women use the sort that are
given them on birthdays or at
Christmas.
Piain white with embroidered
dogs, flowers, or monograms are the
general favorites for daytime wear.
Some girls prefer men's large white
handkerchiefs. Large gaudy ones
are favored by a large percentage of
the 1200. Lace-edged white or sour
cream color ones are often carried
in a dress purse and never seen
from one Friday night till the next.
