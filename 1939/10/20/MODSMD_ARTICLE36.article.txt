# Class of '43 Will Wear Quad Clothes at First Rush Teas
## Frosh to Don Informal Garb For Row Trek Pam-Hell Innovations Include Dessert Parties, Name Tags 
### 
Sweaters and skirts, along with
name tags, are the proper apparel
for the' teas which open the 3939
l ushing I season. They are to be
given Frliday, Nov. 17 .through Sun
day, Nov. 19, according to Jeanne
Cutler, 'president of Pan-Hellenic
council.
In line with the informality to be
emphasized during rushing this year,
name tags will be? worn at the teas
for the first time, she explained.
So that women may attend the
Washington State football game Sat
urday afternoon, Nov. 18, another
change has also been planned. Des
sert will be served at the sororities
that evening from 7 to 9:30 o'clock,
supplanting the second tea, since
the teas are scheduled from 3 to 5:30
o'clock in the afternoon.
DESSERT SERVED ON ROW
No dessert will be served at Roble
at Saturday dinner, and every fresh
man woman will receive an invita
tion to finish the meal up the Row
instead.
Quad clothes will prevail through
out, at the evening dessert parties
as well as the teas. Tailored or
sporty wool suits, simple shirt
maker dresses, and of course the in
evitable sweater-and-skirt combina
tions will be worn. Spectator spoils
pumps will be acceptable, P»liss Cut
ler declared, but "gummies" or
saddle shoes will be quite appro
priate. Hats, as usual on the cam
pus, will not be in evidence.
. Sorority women will dress in the
same manner as their guests; a
strand of pearls, scarf, or a tailored
shirt worn under a sweater will be
most often seen, with ostentatious
jewelry, make-up, or accessories as
taboo as they would be in a class
room.
Gloves, furs, and fancy furbelows,
along with hats, for this first in
formal series of affairs are relegated
to the list of "don'ts."
DRESS FOR DINNER
For formal rushing — which will
take place early winter quarter— (
dressing is quite another matter.
Quad clothes will still be worn to |
the first luncheons, since women i
will attend straight from classes. But :
silk dresses and hats if desired will
be seen at dinners, with long j
dresses making their appearance on I
the occasions of the all-important :
"preference nights."
But in order to make the week
of Row-and-Roble contact as sim
ple and natural as possible, gaudi
ness and showiness in costume will
be considered as out of place in a
sorority dining room as they would
at the "Mark" or the "Frantic."
"Dress as you would if you were
going to the City," Miss Cutler sug
gested. "After all, things are pretty
conservative up there."
Black or dark colored dresses,
with a piece or two of neat costume
jewelry, simple hat and gloves, and
either cloth or fur coat are usually
donned by farm women for dates in
San Francisco.
PREFERENCE NIGHT FORMAL
Rushees can go the limit with
high heels and formal frocks for the,
final set of preference dinners, but
here as at any time, caution is the
catchword when it comes to fussi
ncss in clothes, make-up, or hair
do. An overdose of eye-goo will be i

frowned on by a sorority member
even as it would be by your best
beau!
Invitations for the opening "Cour
tesy Teas" and dessert parties will
be issued through sponsors to fresh
man and transfer women; each
woman will make out her own
name tag in her living group. Dates
for formal rushing next quarter will
be announced later.

dresses making their appearance on I
the occasions of the all-important :
"preference nights."
But in order to make the week
of Row-and-Roble contact as sim
ple and natural as possible, gaudi
ness and showiness in costume will
be considered as out of place in a
sorority dining room as they would
at the "Mark" or the "Frantic."
"Dress as you would if you were
going to the City," Miss Cutler sug
gested. "After all, things are pretty
conservative up there."
Black or dark colored dresses,
with a piece or two of neat costume
jewelry, simple hat and gloves, and
either cloth or fur coat are usually
donned by farm women for dates in
San Francisco.
PREFERENCE NIGHT FORMAL
Rushees can go the limit with
high heels and formal frocks for the,
final set of preference dinners, but
here as at any time, caution is the
catchword when it comes to fussi
ncss in clothes, make-up, or hair
do. An overdose of eye-goo will be i

frowned on by a sorority member
even as it would be by your best
beau!
Invitations for the opening "Cour
tesy Teas" and dessert parties will
be issued through sponsors to fresh
man and transfer women; each
woman will make out her own
name tag in her living group. Dates
for formal rushing next quarter will
be announced later.
Sweaters and skirts, along with
name tags, are the proper apparel
for the' teas which open the 3939
l ushing I season. They are to be
given Frliday, Nov. 17 .through Sun
day, Nov. 19, according to Jeanne
Cutler, 'president of Pan-Hellenic
council.
In line with the informality to be
emphasized during rushing this year,
name tags will be? worn at the teas
for the first time, she explained.
So that women may attend the
Washington State football game Sat
urday afternoon, Nov. 18, another
change has also been planned. Des
sert will be served at the sororities
that evening from 7 to 9:30 o'clock,
supplanting the second tea, since
the teas are scheduled from 3 to 5:30
o'clock in the afternoon.
DESSERT SERVED ON ROW
No dessert will be served at Roble
at Saturday dinner, and every fresh
man woman will receive an invita
tion to finish the meal up the Row
instead.
Quad clothes will prevail through
out, at the evening dessert parties
as well as the teas. Tailored or
sporty wool suits, simple shirt
maker dresses, and of course the in
evitable sweater-and-skirt combina
tions will be worn. Spectator spoils
pumps will be acceptable, P»liss Cut
ler declared, but "gummies" or
saddle shoes will be quite appro
priate. Hats, as usual on the cam
pus, will not be in evidence.
. Sorority women will dress in the
same manner as their guests; a
strand of pearls, scarf, or a tailored
shirt worn under a sweater will be
most often seen, with ostentatious
jewelry, make-up, or accessories as
taboo as they would be in a class
room.
Gloves, furs, and fancy furbelows,
along with hats, for this first in
formal series of affairs are relegated
to the list of "don'ts."
DRESS FOR DINNER
For formal rushing — which will
take place early winter quarter— (
dressing is quite another matter.
Quad clothes will still be worn to |
the first luncheons, since women i
will attend straight from classes. But :
silk dresses and hats if desired will
be seen at dinners, with long j
dresses making their appearance on I
the occasions of the all-important :
