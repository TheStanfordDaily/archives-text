# Sloppy Cardigans Styled in Cashmeres, Shetlands
## 
### 
As you may have noticed already, sweaters are big and baggy this year.
Size :J2's are wearing size 40's to make sure that the sweater reaches below
their hips and is big enough to go around two people.
It all started last spring when modified Brooks came into favor, and
they've been getting larger and baggier ever since. A Brooks looks con-

servative now. Sbme girls are even<
buying men's sweaters to get them
large enough.
Cardigans will always be favorites
of Stanford women because they can
be worn so many ways, but this year
slip-overs are getting more attention
than before.
Angora has nearly disappeared in
sweaters; you can't be bothered
brushing your skirts and jackets
every five minutes. Cashmere and
Shetland are much more practical
yarns and wear better.
Suede and corduroy are being
combined with knitted materials but
they aren't guaranteed to look the
same after they've been worn a
while. Cardigans have had their
faces lifted with new plaid trimming
down the front instead of the con
ventional grosgrain ribbon.
Twin sweater suits are enjoying a

revival this year. They hive always
been popular but it's hard to match
colors and materials in sweaters,
which explains their recent disap
pearance.
Moss - green and grape are the
latest colors for sweaters, and the
varied shades of these two funda
mental hues make good combina
tions. An attractive finishing touch
to your sweater is a necklace of
suede or of a combination suede and
metal.
A suggestion for fall — striped
tweed, the blurred, multi-colored
pattern going up and down in the
broad - shouldered, reefer-buttoned
jacket, and chevron-wise in the
flared, bias-cut skirt.
