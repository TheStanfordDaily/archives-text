# Classic Sweaters, Skirts Remain Top Quad Styles
## 
### 
What's new in Quad clothes? This perennial question has a perennial
answer: "The classic styles in sweaters and skirts are still the newest things
in the Stanford fashion world." Of course there are a few fads such as
hooded coats and jackets and spectator sports dresses featuring the bishop
sleeve, but as a general rule, such innovations soon disappear from the

scene, as did last year's craze for,
Dutch sabots.
A canvass of Palo Alto stores re
veals that the most popular items in
the Stanford woman's school ward
robe are the old standbys, Brooks
and Braemar sweaters, and plaid or
plain-color skirts. This rule is var
ied by the spectator sports dress,
made in the shirt-maker style, with
wrist-length sleeves.
The Shetland weave is the most
popular in sweaters this season, al
though angora and cashmere are also
being shown. "Sloppy Joe" sweaters
in Danger red are favorites, with
beige, grape and champagne fea
tured for the more conservative.
Liberty scarves, classics in any sports
wardrobe, are still used as belts,
peasant babushkas, or, strangely
enough, as scarves.
SWING SKIRTS POPULAR
The skirt styles are much the same,
with the "Swing" type prevailing,
although plaited skirts are also popu
lar. Plaids, in all sizes and colors,
are favorites for skirts, and a varia
tion on the basic sweater and skirt
combination is a plaid skirt worn
with a plain sweater bound in match
ing plaid ribbon. Another new idea
is a combination of a plain-color
sweater and matching skirt, with
plaid ribbon-binding down the front
of both.
Saddle oxfords, another college
tradition, are still popular, although
dark suede "gummies" and suede
spectator pumps are also favored.
The moccasin-knee-length-stockings
vogue, introduced in Eastern col
leges, has not yet penetrated the
Stanford campus, and due to the tra
dition of "silk-stockings-on-Quad"
is probably doomed to neglect on the
Farm.
HOODED COATS NEW
Though the weather may seem to
defy the calendar-makers, when the
rains come, and the thermometer
registers something below 70 degrees,
hooded coats and jackets will make
their appearance, as another of this
season's innovations. These "jac
koats" are usually plain on the out
side, and lined with brilliant plaid.
The hood is detachable, and when
not in use as a protection from the

rain, will probably be used to carry
books, according to fashion experts
who have found that the average
college girl prefers to find new and
original uses for even the most prac
tical, utilitarian things.
As usual, "junk" jewelry is still
being sold in great quantities, with
the brassy, jingling, necklaces and
bracelets taking precedence over all
others. This year's addition to the
jewelry clan is a silver chain strung
with irridescent or colored glass bub
ble balls, in all sizes, and the tradi- |
tional pearls are still good.
NOVELTY COLOR NAMES
Colors that have made their first
appearance under a new name are:
Viking blue, moss green, duck blue,
champagne, and hacienda green.
In spite of everything, in a college
wardrobe the styles that were good
last year are apt to be even better
this year, provided they were not
merely fads. However, off-Quad the
ideal of sloppiness does not prevail,
as it does in many colleges. The
Eastern girl who remarked that her
Brooks and tweed skirt were good
enough for the Waldorf had never
heard of Stanford.
Dicattorships are as unpopular in
fashion as they are in politics.
Edicts, even as ot elegance, are not
tolerated. Paris has flicked the
pages of history, re-rendered old
masters. She gives you a world of
ideas — and all the leeway in the
world. This is a year to dress ac
cording to your type, and glory in it.

veals that the most popular items in
the Stanford woman's school ward
robe are the old standbys, Brooks
and Braemar sweaters, and plaid or
plain-color skirts. This rule is var
ied by the spectator sports dress,
made in the shirt-maker style, with
wrist-length sleeves.
The Shetland weave is the most
popular in sweaters this season, al
though angora and cashmere are also
being shown. "Sloppy Joe" sweaters
in Danger red are favorites, with
beige, grape and champagne fea
tured for the more conservative.
Liberty scarves, classics in any sports
wardrobe, are still used as belts,
peasant babushkas, or, strangely
enough, as scarves.
SWING SKIRTS POPULAR
The skirt styles are much the same,
with the "Swing" type prevailing,
although plaited skirts are also popu
lar. Plaids, in all sizes and colors,
are favorites for skirts, and a varia
tion on the basic sweater and skirt
combination is a plaid skirt worn
with a plain sweater bound in match
ing plaid ribbon. Another new idea
is a combination of a plain-color
sweater and matching skirt, with
plaid ribbon-binding down the front
of both.
Saddle oxfords, another college
tradition, are still popular, although
dark suede "gummies" and suede
spectator pumps are also favored.
The moccasin-knee-length-stockings
vogue, introduced in Eastern col
leges, has not yet penetrated the
Stanford campus, and due to the tra
dition of "silk-stockings-on-Quad"
is probably doomed to neglect on the
Farm.
HOODED COATS NEW
Though the weather may seem to
defy the calendar-makers, when the
rains come, and the thermometer
registers something below 70 degrees,
hooded coats and jackets will make
their appearance, as another of this
season's innovations. These "jac
koats" are usually plain on the out
side, and lined with brilliant plaid.
The hood is detachable, and when
not in use as a protection from the

rain, will probably be used to carry
books, according to fashion experts
who have found that the average
college girl prefers to find new and
original uses for even the most prac
tical, utilitarian things.
As usual, "junk" jewelry is still
being sold in great quantities, with
the brassy, jingling, necklaces and
bracelets taking precedence over all
others. This year's addition to the
jewelry clan is a silver chain strung
with irridescent or colored glass bub
ble balls, in all sizes, and the tradi- |
tional pearls are still good.
NOVELTY COLOR NAMES
Colors that have made their first
appearance under a new name are:
Viking blue, moss green, duck blue,
champagne, and hacienda green.
In spite of everything, in a college
wardrobe the styles that were good
last year are apt to be even better
this year, provided they were not
merely fads. However, off-Quad the
ideal of sloppiness does not prevail,
as it does in many colleges. The
Eastern girl who remarked that her
Brooks and tweed skirt were good
enough for the Waldorf had never
heard of Stanford.
Dicattorships are as unpopular in
fashion as they are in politics.
Edicts, even as ot elegance, are not
tolerated. Paris has flicked the
pages of history, re-rendered old
masters. She gives you a world of
ideas — and all the leeway in the
world. This is a year to dress ac
cording to your type, and glory in it.
What's new in Quad clothes? This perennial question has a perennial
answer: "The classic styles in sweaters and skirts are still the newest things
in the Stanford fashion world." Of course there are a few fads such as
hooded coats and jackets and spectator sports dresses featuring the bishop
sleeve, but as a general rule, such innovations soon disappear from the

scene, as did last year's craze for,
Dutch sabots.
