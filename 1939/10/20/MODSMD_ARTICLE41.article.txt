# 'Up' Hair Do, Baby Bob Bow To New Style
## 
### 
The only constant thing about
: women's hair styles is that they
[ change about every six months.
Last year the "up" hair-do was
the thing. That style gave way to
the baby bob. This year both are
considered passe.
The keynote of the latest fashions
is a relatively long cut in back and
short curls in front. It has no par
ticular name.
Rolls, high waves, and curls will
give the general hair do a high look.
People with long faces will be ad
vised to concentrate the curls on
the side of the face and keep the
top fiat.
A cluster of curls lying low on the
nape of the neck and caught by a
bow is one of the newer evening
hairdresses. The top would be a
series of soft rather large curls.
The page boy bob is back in a
modified form. It will be used main
ly to dress the back of the hair, for
sport occasions.
I'or the quad, the hair is not fussy
or formal for purely convenient
reasons. Although with the trend of
femininity in clothes of all sorts,
the hair should complete the illu
sion. A softness around the face
can be achieved without using elab
orate curl arrangements.
The greatest single factor in the
latest hair styles, is the bustle. When
the hair is combed down smooth in
back and ends in a group of curls, it
looks vaguely like the bustle sil
houette .
No matter what the authorities on
the correct hair styles say, most girls
have enough common sense and van
ity to fix their hair to suit the situa
tion, and flatter their personalities.
