# Clever Wardrobes Disguise Economy

The co-ed whose ensemble always
looks "right," whose costume always
matches probably spends lots less
on her clothes thafi the girl whose
accessories just never seem to
match!
She knows she looks well in one
basic color—it may be black, brown,
navy, or dark green, but she sticks
to it, with different combinations
and blends.
Suppose she's a "blue girl." She
may have only one coat, but it's
navy, and so are her hat, shoes,
purse, and gloves. That means she
can wear them with all her dresses—
as long as she sticks to dubonnots,
teals, rose, stop red, or shades of
blue. But that offers a pretty wide
possibility of combination.
