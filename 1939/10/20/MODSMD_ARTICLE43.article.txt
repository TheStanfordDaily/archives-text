# Fashion Decrees 'Jewelry Back On The Gold Standard'
## Styles Stress Old Metals In Settings Platinum White Gold No Longer Favored For Rings, Bracelets 
### 
Jewelry is back on the "gold stand- j
ard." If you don't believe it, look ■
around you—gold on the wrist, gold |
at the neck, gold on the lapels, gold |
on the shop windows!
Although the standard "diamond j
watches" and rings with many dia- i
monds are still being set in plati
num, all other types of watches, !
rings, necklaces, bracelets, and
pendants are more and more likely
to be made of yellow gold in place
of the white gold and platinum which '
have been so universal in recent
years.
Nowhere is this more evident
than in the costume jewels. About
SO per cent of all the displays to be
seen in the stores, and of the jew
els which girls are wearing, are
either completely or basically made
of gold. One very stunning new in
terpretation of the times is the gold
"Polish Lancer with a Shield." The
shield comes in amethyst, coral, or
emerald shades; and the pin makes
an extremely striking lapel orna
ment.
VELVET, GOLD COMBINED
Carmen Miranda, the new Broad
way dancing sensation, boosted this
fashion of gold costume jewelry by
appearing in an interesting three
strand gold necklace which is held
together at each end by loops, and
tied around the throat by a velvet
ribbon, either loosely, or with a
choker effect.
Among the many all-gold brace
lets. two are unusually outstanding.
One of these is an intriguing pair of
wide, shiny handcuffs, linked to
each other by a short chain. The
other is a flat disk the size of a
silver dollar, hung from a heavy
gold chain; the disk makes a very
good contrasting background for
engraved initials or names.
A lovely adaptation of the new j
style is the use of genuine sea j
shells, gilded, fastened together and |
worn on lapels. The gilding of these I
shells results in a surprisingly deli- j
cate efTect.
PEARLS GAIN FAVOR
A very popular way of using gold
is to combine it with pearls. There
are many ways of doing it, but one
of the most effective examples to be
seen is the "Calla Lily" bracelet. It j
has a small gold chain, gold leaves, i
and mother-of-pearl calla lilies with ;
gold centers.
Another of these combinations is j
the necklace of gold leaves with j
four very tiny pearls on each leaf. 1
A necklace for fisherwomen, or any- j
one just looking for a cute idea, is i
a gold chain with lots of small, gold i
fish hanging onto the bottom by
their teeth. And of course there arc
the charms. There are some darling
ones around; one has a shower,
panties, stocking, shoe, and lipstick;
others have kitchen utensils, circus
features, and Wild West themes.
But in spite ol the general trend
toward gold, a great many other j
materials are still being worn. The j
increasingly popular plastics arc
very much in 'favor. A particularly I
attractive necklace is a plastic in;
the new color "Chili Bean." It. is a j
triple row of plain links, all in this j
fashionable shade ,or else in a very
deep emerald.
BRIGHT COLORS STRESSED
For bright color the "Trade
Winds" necklaces arc appearing ev
erywhere. They are multiple strands j
of tiny glass beads in strands of the 1
same color, braided with strands of j
contrasting colors, to form a heavy,
colorful decoration for a sweater or i
a plain neckline.

dress.

PEARLS GAIN FAVOR
A very popular way of using gold
is to combine it with pearls. There
are many ways of doing it, but one
of the most effective examples to be
seen is the "Calla Lily" bracelet. It j
has a small gold chain, gold leaves, i
and mother-of-pearl calla lilies with ;
gold centers.
Another of these combinations is j
the necklace of gold leaves with j
four very tiny pearls on each leaf. 1
A necklace for fisherwomen, or any- j
one just looking for a cute idea, is i
a gold chain with lots of small, gold i
fish hanging onto the bottom by
their teeth. And of course there arc
the charms. There are some darling
ones around; one has a shower,
panties, stocking, shoe, and lipstick;
others have kitchen utensils, circus
features, and Wild West themes.
But in spite ol the general trend
toward gold, a great many other j
materials are still being worn. The j
increasingly popular plastics arc
very much in 'favor. A particularly I
attractive necklace is a plastic in;
the new color "Chili Bean." It. is a j
triple row of plain links, all in this j
fashionable shade ,or else in a very
deep emerald.
BRIGHT COLORS STRESSED
For bright color the "Trade
Winds" necklaces arc appearing ev
erywhere. They are multiple strands j
of tiny glass beads in strands of the 1
same color, braided with strands of j
contrasting colors, to form a heavy,
colorful decoration for a sweater or i
a plain neckline.
The old favorite, rhinestonc, ap- j
pears in a charming, three-dimen- j
sional organ grinder with his monkey i
on a chain. More rhinestonc is the I
pretty striped zebra which can be
worn either on the lapel or on a
dress.
Jewelry is back on the "gold stand- j
ard." If you don't believe it, look ■
around you—gold on the wrist, gold |
at the neck, gold on the lapels, gold |
on the shop windows!
Although the standard "diamond j
watches" and rings with many dia- i
monds are still being set in plati
num, all other types of watches, !
rings, necklaces, bracelets, and
pendants are more and more likely
to be made of yellow gold in place
of the white gold and platinum which '
have been so universal in recent
years.
Nowhere is this more evident
than in the costume jewels. About
SO per cent of all the displays to be
seen in the stores, and of the jew
els which girls are wearing, are
either completely or basically made
of gold. One very stunning new in
terpretation of the times is the gold
"Polish Lancer with a Shield." The
shield comes in amethyst, coral, or
emerald shades; and the pin makes
an extremely striking lapel orna
ment.
VELVET, GOLD COMBINED
Carmen Miranda, the new Broad
way dancing sensation, boosted this
fashion of gold costume jewelry by
appearing in an interesting three
strand gold necklace which is held
together at each end by loops, and
tied around the throat by a velvet
ribbon, either loosely, or with a
choker effect.
Among the many all-gold brace
lets. two are unusually outstanding.
One of these is an intriguing pair of
wide, shiny handcuffs, linked to
each other by a short chain. The
other is a flat disk the size of a
silver dollar, hung from a heavy
gold chain; the disk makes a very
good contrasting background for
engraved initials or names.
A lovely adaptation of the new j
style is the use of genuine sea j
shells, gilded, fastened together and |
worn on lapels. The gilding of these I
shells results in a surprisingly deli- j
cate efTect.
