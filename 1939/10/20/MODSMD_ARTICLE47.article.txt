# Flashy Perfume Names Follow Fall's Vivid Mood
## 
### 
News about perfumes this season seems to center on their names.
"Danger," by Ciro. for instance. What woman could resist wanting at
least to sniff the stuff? Then we have Lelong's "Carefree"—there arc times
when any woman would invest in a scent designed to make her look, feel

or smell carcfrcc. It is best described <
as a wholesome perfume.
Chanel, and Chanel alone, has had
the courage to plod along merely
numbering his perfumes and he is
doing very well. He is up to 22 now
and still going strong.
Ciro's reputation as a perfumer
was originally established with his
series of scents of which the spicy
"Chevalier de la Nuit" was probably
the most successful. The title, too,
was of the old, romantic school. Re
cently Ciro put out another perfume.

►
Nothing old, romantic, or subtle
about this one. He called it "Dan
ger." Titles aside for the moment,
it is a scent in the best Ciro tradi
tion. Nothing .too sharp, it is a
"smooth" perfume.
Back to exterior qualities for the
moment, no one 'can have escaped
noticing the ads for that triumvirate
put out by Bourjois. He features his
old blue-bottled "Evening in Paris"
and adds two more: "Mais Oui" and
"Kobaka."
