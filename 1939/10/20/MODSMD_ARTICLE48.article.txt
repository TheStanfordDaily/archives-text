# Glamour Sales Ballyhoo Ends Little Girl Era
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Giair.mir is a word that's being bandied about a good deal (liese days
by those who sell women's clothes. Last year the "little Kir''' was a!i the
vogue; this year glamour is in and the little girls will either have to grow
up or go into retirement.
Just exactly what "glamour" is is a moot question. It's one of those
things women either have or don't have according to male opinion: but the

men simply cannot describe it.
do agree, however, that a woman is |
far more apt to have glamour in
evening clothes than she is in Quad j
clothes.
The couturiers got together last .
spring, and decided that this season '
women without glamour were, per
force, going to get it, and women
with glamour were going to get, a j
chance to show it. To this end. their i
designs began to take the "glamour" |
trend.
FARM LAUGHS AT BUSTLE
Now what a Paris designer thinks
will make a woman glamorous is not j
always apt to be what will. For in- j
stance, the Mainbocher corset has '
only succeeded in making Farm i
women laugh. It seems that they i
prefer ordinary breathing to laced-in :
glamour in ihis case. i
The bu: tie, too, has come in for |
its share of humorous comment. !
However, these are far more practi- |
cal than a corset which requires the |
help oI two roommates and a pair of |
pliers to get into.
CORSETS ADD GLAMOUR IF—
Bustles, the right kind on the j
right dress, are flattering. American j
women, on the whole, will wear any- j
thing they think makes them more j
attractive, but they draw the line at j
impracticability. Witness what hap- j
pened to the up-hair-do.
Mainbochcr designed his corset to i
go with dresses which emphasize the I
sculptured silhouette. And this is!
definitely in. Soft flattering fabrics j
which mold the figure are popular, !
and they do add glamour—if you I
have the figure. i
STANFORD WON'T CHANGE
Spangles, sequins, and delicate
gold-traced embroidery add much to j
the charm of both the afternoon and j
evening dresses. Massive jewelry j
adds to what the sales girls call the j
"glamour effect."
However, while the glamour girls I
are getting their innings this season, j
it's a sure thing that Paris will de- 1
cree something else next year. Pos- j
sibly that "front-line-trench-look." j
And, as u.sual, Farm women will un- i
doubtedly continue to look just as !
they always have.
