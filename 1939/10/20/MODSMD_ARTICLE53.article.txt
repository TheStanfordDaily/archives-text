# Quad Clothes Feature New 'Stop Red'
## Bright Color Skirts And Plaid Dresses Lead Style Parade 
### 
"It's no year for the timid," say
the sales people in the Paly shops
sis they show you stop red jersey
shirts and brilliant plaid skirts,
while actual campus clothes bear
them out.
A sample survey of the quad's
best-dressed brought the following
high-fashion items to light: a natural
cashmere dress with ribbon binding
all the way down the front, a plaid
suit in autumn greens and browns
with pleated swing skirt, a slate
blue corduroy jacket and swing
skirt, a loud horse-blanket plaid
skill in red and green and a Dan
ger red long sleeved jersey blouse
with a gray jersey skirt.
SWEATERS AND SKIRTS
Sweaters and skirts are perennial
—nothing will ever replace Shetland
Brooks or cashmeres. Pleated skirts,
belted swing skirts, etc., are also
always good, but some powerful
newcomers are the popular inverted
pleats fore and aft and hounds-tooth
checks in black and white.
Sports accessories make a story
an themselves, but Liberty scarves,
jangly necklaces, and pearls in all
sizes and degrees of quality and
quantity are ever-popular.
BISIIOP SLEEVES
Roble can boast of the two smart
young things who wear the skirt
and shirt with bishop sleeves en
semble in slate blue. Seen on the
row was one of the best looking of
simple wools in an olive gre«_n with
pleated skirt. Stitched leather but
tons lent interest to the waist.
Despite the California Chamber
of Commerce, a wool or eamel's
hair campus coat feels rather won
derful when you dash through 8
o'clock fog on your way to class.
A fitted tweed reefer, a loose tweed
top coat with a zippered plaid lin
ing, and the beloved camel's hair
polo coat are favorites.
The white lamb's wool jacket and
hood, lined with red and white fig
ured print and Tyrolean silver coin
buttons would be very "swish" lor
the colder football games the school
color with the "ne plus ultra" in
style. And one of the local stores
is featuring camel's hair top coats
with detachable hoods lined in Stop
red or Go green.
GUARDSMEN COATS
Guardsmen coats, that is, the fit
ted coat with bell-hop buttons slant
ing down from a plain round neck,
also cause heads to turn when they
trot up the steps of the Libe. Light
tv/eeds rival their darker sisters in
popularity and will always be right
when fashioned into a tailored top
coat.
There used to be a recipe for cam
pus clothes; to-wit, mix one good
tweed jacket with skirt in contrast
ing color, a cashmere or jersey pull
over, pearls, and a campus queen
result was guaranteed. This recipe
still goes, only this year's tweed
jackets are longer than last year's.
However, plaid dresses in the bright
or softer shadow plaids, the new nat
ural-waist. soft wool dresses in blue,
pink, or creme will bring the same
result. And a little ingenuity in
mixing your sweaters and skirts goes
a long way—for example a black
cashmere pullover with a yellow and
green plaid skirt will cause as much
head turning as smoking on quad.

green plaid skirt will cause as much
head turning as smoking on quad.
"It's no year for the timid," say
the sales people in the Paly shops
sis they show you stop red jersey
shirts and brilliant plaid skirts,
while actual campus clothes bear
them out.
A sample survey of the quad's
best-dressed brought the following
high-fashion items to light: a natural
cashmere dress with ribbon binding
all the way down the front, a plaid
suit in autumn greens and browns
with pleated swing skirt, a slate
blue corduroy jacket and swing
skirt, a loud horse-blanket plaid
skill in red and green and a Dan
ger red long sleeved jersey blouse
with a gray jersey skirt.
SWEATERS AND SKIRTS
Sweaters and skirts are perennial
—nothing will ever replace Shetland
Brooks or cashmeres. Pleated skirts,
belted swing skirts, etc., are also
always good, but some powerful
newcomers are the popular inverted
pleats fore and aft and hounds-tooth
checks in black and white.
Sports accessories make a story
an themselves, but Liberty scarves,
jangly necklaces, and pearls in all
sizes and degrees of quality and
quantity are ever-popular.
BISIIOP SLEEVES
Roble can boast of the two smart
young things who wear the skirt
and shirt with bishop sleeves en
semble in slate blue. Seen on the
row was one of the best looking of
simple wools in an olive gre«_n with
pleated skirt. Stitched leather but
tons lent interest to the waist.
Despite the California Chamber
of Commerce, a wool or eamel's
hair campus coat feels rather won
derful when you dash through 8
o'clock fog on your way to class.
A fitted tweed reefer, a loose tweed
top coat with a zippered plaid lin
ing, and the beloved camel's hair
polo coat are favorites.
The white lamb's wool jacket and
hood, lined with red and white fig
ured print and Tyrolean silver coin
buttons would be very "swish" lor
the colder football games the school
color with the "ne plus ultra" in
style. And one of the local stores
is featuring camel's hair top coats
with detachable hoods lined in Stop
red or Go green.
GUARDSMEN COATS
Guardsmen coats, that is, the fit
ted coat with bell-hop buttons slant
ing down from a plain round neck,
also cause heads to turn when they
trot up the steps of the Libe. Light
tv/eeds rival their darker sisters in
popularity and will always be right
when fashioned into a tailored top
coat.
There used to be a recipe for cam
pus clothes; to-wit, mix one good
tweed jacket with skirt in contrast
ing color, a cashmere or jersey pull
over, pearls, and a campus queen
result was guaranteed. This recipe
still goes, only this year's tweed
jackets are longer than last year's.
However, plaid dresses in the bright
or softer shadow plaids, the new nat
ural-waist. soft wool dresses in blue,
pink, or creme will bring the same
result. And a little ingenuity in
mixing your sweaters and skirts goes
a long way—for example a black
cashmere pullover with a yellow and
green plaid skirt will cause as much
head turning as smoking on quad.
