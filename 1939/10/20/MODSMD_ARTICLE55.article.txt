# College Bedroom Styles Swing To Gaudy Colors
## 
### 
Kaleidoscopic red and blue and yellow pillows, herds of tiny animals,
photographs of handsome men and smiling girls, drapes and bedspreads
blending perfectly, battered textbooks, shoes, noise, laughter—these are the
fashion for college bedrooms whether of frosh or graduate, hall or row,
Presented with the cubic feet of spate between four walls, a floor,

and a ceiling one can,
permitting, fill that space with al
most anything. And quite often one
does.
There is for instance, the "Glo
rious"—(because Gloria and Laurie
live in it) —"Gym"—(because the
center of the floor is cleared for do
ing slimming' exercises).
Here are collected only gaudy ob
jects — fight posters, hand - painted
pillows, an enormous Pepsin carton,
and a revolting fuschia bulldog.
FORGOTTEN POSSESSIONS
One hostess, driven to despair and
then to firm steps, has reserved a
corner for a pile of forgotten pos
sessions. Now friends who drop in
to copy her English notes (and de
part an hour later with the details
of Janie's new formal) can scoot
in and reclaim the Barnes without
fuss.
Fortunate indeed is the interior
decorator whose walls have nail

►
holes. A list, of things that can't be
used to support pictures includes
nails, thumb tacks, tacks, pins, li
brary paste, glue, mucillage, gum
med tape, and adhesive tape. "These
regulations are absolute, and a fine
of $1 will be imposed for each vio
lation," authority adds firmly.
ARTISTIC RANGE VARIES
If only someone else has paid
the dollar per, the new tenant may
be grateful. Artistic taste ranges
from Stanford banners to Van Gogh
! sunflowers (which can be rented by
| the quarter) and includes kites and
; deer horns.
If the drapes match the candle
i wick spread and arm chair, cloth
I animals sit on the bed, t there is a
: Numdah or fur rug, and ivy grows
i in an earthenware pot, then it is the
| knick-knacks which give indivi
; duality.
