# Golf, Tennis Clothes Stick To Practicality
## 
### 
Fashion designers and style magazines may continue to think up new
designs, lancy fabrics, and silly accessories for active sports, but the Stan
lord woman seems to go riyht on playing her tennis and Â«;olf in the same
old sensible, conservative clothes.
On the tennis court, where shorts are permitted, they continue to be
the favorite outfit. Most of them are fairly shoit and riain. In fact they are.

as often as not, the regulation
gabardine ones approved by the gym
department.
A few short dresses of cotton or
the light wools are seen. These are
sometimes made in jumper dress
styles but are always designed with
plenty of room for action, and the
accent on comfort arid utility.
Slacks and culottes are still oc
casionally worn on golf courses
where the rules allow, but on the
Stanford course and elsewhere the
skirt and blouse or sweater (in cold
weather both) continue to dominate
the scene. Skirts are short and full,
and blouses are made with action
backs for plenty of room.
One-piece wool, jersey, and flan
nel dresses in bright colors are an
attractive variation. They should
have short, full skirts and plenty
of freedom for back and shoulder
action.
