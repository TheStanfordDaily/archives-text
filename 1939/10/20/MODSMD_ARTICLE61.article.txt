# Velveteens, Plaids Combine for Casuals
## 
### 
Plaids are the definite favorites
this year for casual dresses. One of
the cutest combinations shown is a
two-piece outfit with a plaid skirt
and velveteen jacket.
The jacket features a collar and
big buttons of the same material as
the skirt. A tiny pill-box tilted over
one eye completes the costume.
