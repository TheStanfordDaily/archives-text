# Spring Colors Are Revived In Heat Wave
## 
### 
Stanford women would be a lot
happier light now if the old adage
I "Spring has sprung" had been ap
i plieable this year.
Spring did not spring. Spring took
! a prolonged pole vault and hasn't
j come down on autumn's damp
| ground yet.
In the natural course of events and
weather, women on the campus
would be well into their dark tweeds
by now, but are they? No, pastel
skirts, white sweaters, spectator
i pumps and all those other signs of
spring are still seen on the Quad.
And this, mind you, is October.
For the first week of school,
women were just a little annoyed;
here ihey d come down armed to the
teeth with luscious heavy tweeds,
wool dresses in varied autumnal
hues and "good sensible'' brown
shoes. And the weather was con
sistently calling for light dresses,
white shoes and hair ribbons.
After this went on for a few weeks,
furious S.O.S. bulletins reached par
ents homes and large boxes contain
ing light blue and white skirts, that
■ white angora sweater that was be
ing saved for next spring, and-other
trappings were desperately dis
patched.
Every once in a while one of
those San Francisco fogs blows down
this way and Stanford women hope
iully consult weather reports and
dust off natty mufflers. And come
dawn's early light that hangover
i from spring still glares down on the
earth and Stanford women resign
edly shake out the ole white angora
job.
"How long, oh Lord, how long?"
A warm burnished copper tone in
make-up is the exciting link between
the new autumn eoolrs and you. It
should be worn with the browns,
slate-blues, taupes, and high-fash
ion beiges.
