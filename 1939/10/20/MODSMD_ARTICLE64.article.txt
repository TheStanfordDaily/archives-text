# Men Follow New Styles On the Sly
## Physique Governs Choice of Suitable Materials, Designs 
### 
There are two gags connccted with
men's fashions:
(1) Men don't follow fashions.
(2) All Stanford men are tall and
well built, ;:nd should buy clothes
to go with above build (not what is
the fashion, mind you, but clothes
in general).
All right. If he thinks he is tall
and muscular and wants to dress
this build up, he should wrap it in
a double-breasted suit. He should
wear a single-breasted suit with
nothing but discretion. This is card
inal rule number one.
Cardinal rule number two is, stay
away l rom large patterns and stripes.
They went out with Steve Brodie,
came back for a brief flourish on
the heels of Repeal, and died an
abortive death.
Cardinal rule number three is,
beware of wide trousers and slacks.
Stripes, however, if not too promi
nent, are good stuff.
In the fashion magazines it says
the reason for all this is to "keep
the man's height, and add the illu
sion of slimness." Yeah, fashion
magazines.
But for the realists:
(1) The tall man who is slim and
knows he is slim. For him, solid
colors, plaids, and checks are the
stud. But beware of stripes. Double
breasted suits are better, of course;
padded shoulders don't hurt, but
keep it quiet.
(2) The medium-sized man (not
to be confused with Goldilocks and
the Three Bears) who has no delu
sions of grandeur. He can shoot the
works; or, as the fashion magazines
put it, run the gamut of cuts, pat
tern, and color.
(3) The short man, the man who
dances cheek-to-cheek without
stooping. Stripes, plain fabrics, quiet
colors, single-breasted suits, (and a
car) will get him that date in the
first place. Double-breasted suits
are inclined to give him that step
ped-on look.
The short, stocky man should be
above all conservative in his clothes.
He also might try a few stiff exer
cises. His suits should be plain and
single-breasted; they should never
be made of rough or heavy stuff.
But don't try any of this stuff on
the Quad.

above all conservative in his clothes.
He also might try a few stiff exer
cises. His suits should be plain and
single-breasted; they should never
be made of rough or heavy stuff.
But don't try any of this stuff on
the Quad.
There are two gags connccted with
men's fashions:
(1) Men don't follow fashions.
(2) All Stanford men are tall and
well built, ;:nd should buy clothes
to go with above build (not what is
the fashion, mind you, but clothes
in general).
All right. If he thinks he is tall
and muscular and wants to dress
this build up, he should wrap it in
a double-breasted suit. He should
wear a single-breasted suit with
nothing but discretion. This is card
inal rule number one.
Cardinal rule number two is, stay
away l rom large patterns and stripes.
They went out with Steve Brodie,
came back for a brief flourish on
the heels of Repeal, and died an
abortive death.
Cardinal rule number three is,
beware of wide trousers and slacks.
Stripes, however, if not too promi
nent, are good stuff.
In the fashion magazines it says
the reason for all this is to "keep
the man's height, and add the illu
sion of slimness." Yeah, fashion
magazines.
But for the realists:
(1) The tall man who is slim and
knows he is slim. For him, solid
colors, plaids, and checks are the
stud. But beware of stripes. Double
breasted suits are better, of course;
padded shoulders don't hurt, but
keep it quiet.
(2) The medium-sized man (not
to be confused with Goldilocks and
the Three Bears) who has no delu
sions of grandeur. He can shoot the
works; or, as the fashion magazines
put it, run the gamut of cuts, pat
tern, and color.
(3) The short man, the man who
dances cheek-to-cheek without
stooping. Stripes, plain fabrics, quiet
colors, single-breasted suits, (and a
car) will get him that date in the
first place. Double-breasted suits
are inclined to give him that step
ped-on look.
The short, stocky man should be
above all conservative in his clothes.
He also might try a few stiff exer
cises. His suits should be plain and
single-breasted; they should never
be made of rough or heavy stuff.
