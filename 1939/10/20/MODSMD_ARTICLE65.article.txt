# Powder Turns Pink, Blends with Lips
## 
### 
Powders have abandoned tan and
gold shades following summer, ol'
course, and now in keeping with
clear red lip tones they feature
pinks that promise to make com
plexions rosy: Angel Pink and Glo-
Rachel shades, for instance.
If powder won't bring out enough
rosy glow, a new idea in rouge will
give you pink cheeks in your own
natural shade. A new skin stimu
lant professes to bring color to your
skin, and it is not a liquid rouge.
