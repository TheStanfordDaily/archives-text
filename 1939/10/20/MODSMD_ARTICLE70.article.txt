# Pullovers, Slacks Still Tops For Immovable Stanford Man
## 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
In this too utterly mad whirl of feminine Cushions, (lie male in general
aiul the Stanford Rough in particular is slill holding his conservative own.
Nothing louuer llian tl»c» bang of a popgun is heard along the men's wear
front.
For campus wear, pullover sweaters and slacks still hold the number 1
spot, the former showing up in the popular camel tan, green, blue and

maroon colors, blacks material is
still either Bedford cord, cav
alry twill, or a hard finished
worsted in green brown, and steel
gray. More hardy and practical
souls on the Quad will still bo found
with a good supply of bluejeans and
T-shirts on hand, for the general run
of campus furniture is kind of hard
on even the best slack material.
Something novel in sweater
weaves is a new English rib, avail
ale in all colors and at a quite rea
sonable price.
MOKE SPORTS STYLES
Other informal occasions, if any,
call for the loafer coat of spun rayon,
with saddle-stitch pockets. This was
introduced last fall with success, but
from appearances is going to make a
better showing this season. It comes
in camel or luggage tan and teal
blue. A new twist is the sail cloth
sport shirt, treated with a new
chemical process called Zelan from
the Messrs. Dupont, which makes
the garment spot- and waterproof.
Sport coats are still three-button
and plain back, and the materials
are tweeds and herringbones in
heather mixtures. Colors are a little
more subdued, with darker browns,
greens and blues predominating, but
there are still some around that look
like a circus har.d sounds.
ROUGH GOES SMOOTH
Edging over toward the smoother
side, double-breasted suits in grey
ish blue will be the thing this fall,
with oxford gray and dark brown
shouldering each other out for sec
ond place. Whatever the color,
there'll probably be faint stripes or
an invisible herringbone in it,
though. And, speaking of shoulders,
they'll be wide, with an English
drape and a suppressed waist.
Trousers v/ill be high rise, with
zipper fronts and a full-length taper
to the cuff. Single-breasted suits are
being shown in Harris tweed pat
terns, herringbones, and diagonals,
with the good old three-button, plain
back style still in there pitching.
lOPCOAT STYLES
British propaganda of the nicer
sort shows up in the new styles for
topcoats. They're mostly all single
breasted, with Balmaccan collars,
loose fitting and beltless. Designs
are plaids and tweeds, and the colors
are teal blue, grey, brown, and green.
Raincoats follow the topcoats in gen
eral outline.
Tuxes are standing fast, with the
double-breasted midnight blue the
most popular. Next to borrowing
your roommate's, the swank matched
jewelry sets are best, and collars are
predominantly turn-down.
FOR COLD WEATHER
For the last-but-not-least item,
there's a really terrific cold-weather
jacket that can be used for skiing or
what have you, and looks as though

it would keep out the dean's coldest
glance. It's '.ned with lamb's wool,
gabardine trimmed with leather out
side. fur collar, slash pockets, and
even has sweater cuffs concealed in
the sleeves. Costs $17.50, and well
worth it.
Prices in general are better than ,
last year, and are what the boys in
the trade call a "buyer's market." '■
They'll hold until present stocks of j
imported and raw materials are used ;
up. Then, on account of the Euro
pean fracas and precai iousness of
shipping, prices will probably hitch
skyward a trifle. However, the tariff
is down on imports at present, which ;
makes such things as genuine Argyle
plaid socks much cheaper than last
year. Well, you know the answer to
that—buy now and save.
