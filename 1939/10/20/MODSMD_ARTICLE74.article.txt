# Muffs, Hoods Lead 1939's Amusing Accessory Parade
## Fur Ornaments Used to Adorn Gloves, Shoes Stubby-toed Shoes, Envelope Purses Made from Alligator 
### 
Muffs are in. The old-fashioned
accessory to street and formal wear
is again in vogue.
What of it in sunny California?
For days in San Francisco, smail
ness will go literally hand in hand
with comiort when this season's
best dresser steps out with a fur or
fabric muff to brighten up the coat
scene.
And what of evenings in the City?
A velvet or light fur muff will be
smart with any formal ensemble,
besides being oh so comfortable to
poke your paws into when the Bay
fogs start to creep in.
For evening, muff-purses arc more |
than handy to solve the problem of |
where to put all those cosmetics j
necessary for hurry -up repairs.
Convenient too is the custom of
pinning corsages onto muffs; saves
wear and tear on the flowers, besides
being smart. For variety on a muff,
splashy costume jewelry pinned
onto the fur or fabric is news in j
today's accessory fashions. For day- i
time, pin on lapel knickknacks.
CLOVES HIGHLIGHTED
Along with muffs as trimming for |
simple coats, gloves have also been j
highlighted. Elbow - length full
gloves trimmed in fur matching hat
and either purse or muff, will dress
up any plain coat or street ensemble.
Gloves are still being featured to
liven up a dark dress with color.
Elbow length ones over long sleeved
i*owns arc proving most effective.
Or if you are one of those who dis
likes fuss at the wrists, short gloves
in embroidered fabric or leather
hav:> been designed for you. and they
are awfully, awfully smart, since
they arc revivals.
The matching glove - purse - shoe
combination also includes hats this
ycai, especially if a fur trim is the
keynote on each of them. Seal bows,
lapin pompons, and black lamb cuffs
are particularly adaptable to shoes.
ALI IGATOI? BOOMED
For simple shoe and purse
matches, alligator has had a big boom
this year. Fashionable stubby shoe
toes are most effective in alligator,
and both footwear and purse of this
leather will wear and wear and wear.
Purses this year range from huge
sizes to the smallest possible. Zip
around envelopes still hold top place
in campus popularity, with the
carry-all type running a close sec
ond. Rawhide and alligator pocket
books are proving most desirable
for sport and campus wear—and that
means wear.
For dressier purses, quilted leather
and fabric pouches are still going
strong, with the new Corde fabric
superseding suede. Corde looks like
fine silking braiding wound around
in mat form, and it positively will
not rub off.
CAMPUS ACCESSORIES
For campus accessories, the peren
nial scarf, Liberty or otherwise, still
triumphs. In tunc with the times, the
international motif is cleverly em
phasized. France seems to be the
popular country this year following
England's popularity with the coro
nation, royalty visits. France's do
minion. her provinces, and depart
ment shields are splashed in gay
colors across large squares of Sur
rah silk to touch up any sweater set.
Also designed to brighten sweaters
are novelty belts. Despite sloppy
hip-length sweater fashions, belts
are very smart, and are sure to vary
a monotonous wardrobe. Narrow
and wide types are equally smart,
and the goofier the better.
The charm bracelet craze for din
gle-dangles has spread to belts. Coin
purses and monogrammcd tabs arc
among the newest ideas. Following
the bustle angle, some of the belt
gadgets are designed to hang be
hind, but this is more for dress-up
clothes.
KELTS PRACTICAL
Knacky fastenings on belts in
clude a practical zip fastener on a
smart new pigskin strap, and for the
horse-fancier a stirrup strap buckle
is (he latest. Ski fans will find the
belt with the ski pole clasp as handy
as the more severe and sporty pig
skin variety.
Wide belts are still popular in mul
ticolor ribbon or French kid in four
tones, while narrow belts now have
matching wristlets of colored leather
to smarten sports wear.
To keep up with the season's gay
and dashing styles, accessories will
be Godsends to limited wardrobes,
to liven simple clothes and to add
cheerful accents to everyday wear,

For simple shoe and purse
matches, alligator has had a big boom
this year. Fashionable stubby shoe
toes are most effective in alligator,
and both footwear and purse of this
leather will wear and wear and wear.
Purses this year range from huge
sizes to the smallest possible. Zip
around envelopes still hold top place
in campus popularity, with the
carry-all type running a close sec
ond. Rawhide and alligator pocket
books are proving most desirable
for sport and campus wear—and that
means wear.
For dressier purses, quilted leather
and fabric pouches are still going
strong, with the new Corde fabric
superseding suede. Corde looks like
fine silking braiding wound around
in mat form, and it positively will
not rub off.
CAMPUS ACCESSORIES
For campus accessories, the peren
nial scarf, Liberty or otherwise, still
triumphs. In tunc with the times, the
international motif is cleverly em
phasized. France seems to be the
popular country this year following
England's popularity with the coro
nation, royalty visits. France's do
minion. her provinces, and depart
ment shields are splashed in gay
colors across large squares of Sur
rah silk to touch up any sweater set.
Also designed to brighten sweaters
are novelty belts. Despite sloppy
hip-length sweater fashions, belts
are very smart, and are sure to vary
a monotonous wardrobe. Narrow
and wide types are equally smart,
and the goofier the better.
The charm bracelet craze for din
gle-dangles has spread to belts. Coin
purses and monogrammcd tabs arc
among the newest ideas. Following
the bustle angle, some of the belt
gadgets are designed to hang be
hind, but this is more for dress-up
clothes.
KELTS PRACTICAL
Knacky fastenings on belts in
clude a practical zip fastener on a
smart new pigskin strap, and for the
horse-fancier a stirrup strap buckle
is (he latest. Ski fans will find the
belt with the ski pole clasp as handy
as the more severe and sporty pig
skin variety.
Wide belts are still popular in mul
ticolor ribbon or French kid in four
tones, while narrow belts now have
matching wristlets of colored leather
to smarten sports wear.
To keep up with the season's gay
and dashing styles, accessories will
be Godsends to limited wardrobes,
to liven simple clothes and to add
cheerful accents to everyday wear,
Muffs are in. The old-fashioned
accessory to street and formal wear
is again in vogue.
What of it in sunny California?
For days in San Francisco, smail
ness will go literally hand in hand
with comiort when this season's
best dresser steps out with a fur or
fabric muff to brighten up the coat
scene.
And what of evenings in the City?
A velvet or light fur muff will be
smart with any formal ensemble,
besides being oh so comfortable to
poke your paws into when the Bay
fogs start to creep in.
For evening, muff-purses arc more |
than handy to solve the problem of |
where to put all those cosmetics j
necessary for hurry -up repairs.
Convenient too is the custom of
pinning corsages onto muffs; saves
wear and tear on the flowers, besides
being smart. For variety on a muff,
splashy costume jewelry pinned
onto the fur or fabric is news in j
today's accessory fashions. For day- i
time, pin on lapel knickknacks.
CLOVES HIGHLIGHTED
Along with muffs as trimming for |
simple coats, gloves have also been j
highlighted. Elbow - length full
gloves trimmed in fur matching hat
and either purse or muff, will dress
up any plain coat or street ensemble.
Gloves are still being featured to
liven up a dark dress with color.
Elbow length ones over long sleeved
i*owns arc proving most effective.
Or if you are one of those who dis

Muffs are in. The old-fashioned
accessory to street and formal wear
is again in vogue.
What of it in sunny California?
For days in San Francisco, smail
ness will go literally hand in hand
with comiort when this season's
best dresser steps out with a fur or
fabric muff to brighten up the coat
scene.
And what of evenings in the City?
A velvet or light fur muff will be
smart with any formal ensemble,
besides being oh so comfortable to
poke your paws into when the Bay
fogs start to creep in.
For evening, muff-purses arc more |
than handy to solve the problem of |
where to put all those cosmetics j
necessary for hurry -up repairs.
Convenient too is the custom of
pinning corsages onto muffs; saves
wear and tear on the flowers, besides
being smart. For variety on a muff,
splashy costume jewelry pinned
onto the fur or fabric is news in j
today's accessory fashions. For day- i
time, pin on lapel knickknacks.
CLOVES HIGHLIGHTED
Along with muffs as trimming for |
simple coats, gloves have also been j
highlighted. Elbow - length full
gloves trimmed in fur matching hat
and either purse or muff, will dress
up any plain coat or street ensemble.
Gloves are still being featured to
liven up a dark dress with color.
Elbow length ones over long sleeved
i*owns arc proving most effective.
Or if you are one of those who dis
likes fuss at the wrists, short gloves
in embroidered fabric or leather
hav:> been designed for you. and they
are awfully, awfully smart, since
they arc revivals.
The matching glove - purse - shoe
combination also includes hats this
ycai, especially if a fur trim is the
keynote on each of them. Seal bows,
lapin pompons, and black lamb cuffs
are particularly adaptable to shoes.
ALI IGATOI? BOOMED
For simple shoe and purse
matches, alligator has had a big boom
this year. Fashionable stubby shoe
toes are most effective in alligator,
and both footwear and purse of this
leather will wear and wear and wear.
Purses this year range from huge
sizes to the smallest possible. Zip
around envelopes still hold top place
in campus popularity, with the
carry-all type running a close sec
ond. Rawhide and alligator pocket
books are proving most desirable
for sport and campus wear—and that
means wear.
For dressier purses, quilted leather
and fabric pouches are still going
strong, with the new Corde fabric
superseding suede. Corde looks like
fine silking braiding wound around
in mat form, and it positively will
not rub off.
CAMPUS ACCESSORIES
For campus accessories, the peren
nial scarf, Liberty or otherwise, still
triumphs. In tunc with the times, the
international motif is cleverly em
phasized. France seems to be the
popular country this year following
England's popularity with the coro
nation, royalty visits. France's do
minion. her provinces, and depart
ment shields are splashed in gay
colors across large squares of Sur
rah silk to touch up any sweater set.
Also designed to brighten sweaters
are novelty belts. Despite sloppy
hip-length sweater fashions, belts
are very smart, and are sure to vary
a monotonous wardrobe. Narrow
and wide types are equally smart,
and the goofier the better.
The charm bracelet craze for din
gle-dangles has spread to belts. Coin
purses and monogrammcd tabs arc
among the newest ideas. Following
the bustle angle, some of the belt
gadgets are designed to hang be
hind, but this is more for dress-up
clothes.
