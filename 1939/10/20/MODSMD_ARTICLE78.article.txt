# Fashion Vendors Again Change Names of Colors
## 
### 
Every year the fashion vendors]
re-name their colors. It's really as
tonishing what they can do with
three primary and three secondary
shades. Black, however, is still
black, though salesgirls have made
a half-hearted attempt at terming i1 j
"midnight" black.
Whatever it's being called, it is
still as good as ever, though it will
not be worn to quite the extent that
it was when the whole world was
in mourning for Gabriclle Chan
ell's dead lover.
For a basic color this season, brown
is being pushed by those in the
know, because it will tie in with
the new greens—moss, bronze, and
sage — and with Congo wine and
Como blue.
These greens are all pretty much
the same, dull soft shades, which
will make the red-heads purr with
pleasure. Como blue comes in the
winter pastel category, a grade
down. Last year it was Boy blue.
Wine started out a few years ago
as wine. Now it has progressed up
through Burgundy and Dubonnet to
this season's name, Congo wine. It's

still the same color, and it's still an
excellent fall shade.
Combinations have become more
startling. Formals are now being
shown in, of all things, bottle green,
and stop red. Not for the shrinking
violet, it does manage to be down
right pleasing in a gay, uninhib
ited way.
Stop red is the thing for accessor
ies. It might as well be called bright
red or vivid red, but it seems to
have caught on as "stop," so we
shall wear it as stop red. Nail pol
ish and lipsticks are being made to
match.
For tangy autumn days. Anaconda
copper fit,; in nicely. It has a warm
tone which fits in with football
i games and burning leaves. Evening
clothes are using a lot of flame with
gold accents worked into the field,
either in embroidery or in beads.
Honey bear, or burnt sugar, has
| been worked into satin evening
! gowns with breath-taking cffcct.
j This color is like thick honey, and
j some man will undoubtedly get off
i the "good enough to eat" crack
I when you're wearing it.

ell's dead lover.
For a basic color this season, brown
is being pushed by those in the
know, because it will tie in with
the new greens—moss, bronze, and
sage — and with Congo wine and
Como blue.
These greens are all pretty much
the same, dull soft shades, which
will make the red-heads purr with
pleasure. Como blue comes in the
winter pastel category, a grade
down. Last year it was Boy blue.
Wine started out a few years ago
as wine. Now it has progressed up
through Burgundy and Dubonnet to
this season's name, Congo wine. It's

still the same color, and it's still an
excellent fall shade.
Combinations have become more
startling. Formals are now being
shown in, of all things, bottle green,
and stop red. Not for the shrinking
violet, it does manage to be down
right pleasing in a gay, uninhib
ited way.
Stop red is the thing for accessor
ies. It might as well be called bright
red or vivid red, but it seems to
have caught on as "stop," so we
shall wear it as stop red. Nail pol
ish and lipsticks are being made to
match.
For tangy autumn days. Anaconda
copper fit,; in nicely. It has a warm
tone which fits in with football
i games and burning leaves. Evening
clothes are using a lot of flame with
gold accents worked into the field,
either in embroidery or in beads.
Honey bear, or burnt sugar, has
| been worked into satin evening
! gowns with breath-taking cffcct.
j This color is like thick honey, and
j some man will undoubtedly get off
i the "good enough to eat" crack
I when you're wearing it.
Every year the fashion vendors]
re-name their colors. It's really as
tonishing what they can do with
three primary and three secondary
shades. Black, however, is still
black, though salesgirls have made
a half-hearted attempt at terming i1 j
"midnight" black.
Whatever it's being called, it is
still as good as ever, though it will
not be worn to quite the extent that
it was when the whole world was
in mourning for Gabriclle Chan
ell's dead lover.
