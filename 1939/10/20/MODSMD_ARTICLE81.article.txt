# Puritan Bows Crown New Hair Styles

Whether it's a perky bow perched 1
atop the head like a gay butterfly or j
a chaste ribbon demurely holding a
cluster of curls at the nape of the
neck, whether it's an eight o'clock
class or dinner dancing in the City,
a ribbon in the hair is inevitable.
Where a year ago of us con
tented ourselves with barrette type
bows worn more or less uniformly
in pairs at either side, we are now
putting them in back or on top—
wherever fancy may dictate.
One style gracing the Quad this
year for the first time is fashioned
of narrow velvet or satin and ties
on the crown, leaving two long
streamers to dangle coquettishly in
back. For that matter, velvet in any
style is a distinct addition to the
satin, grosgrain, and taffeta of for
mer years.
Historians would hardly call
George Washington the predecessor
of a twentieth century coiffure, but
it cannot be denied that soft lustrous
hair swept up on the sides but gath
ered smoothly in back with almost
puritanical severity and the incor
rigible end curls tied modishly with
a velvet ribbon combines the old and
new most becomingly.
The larger bow comes into its own
for evening wear especially where
it is running the traditional flower
and newer ostrich plume stiff com
petition. A rhinestone clip in the
center adds a sparkling note.
Made in all this season's lustrous
! colors, the new bows cannot fail to
add a gay note to one's costume,
; whether worn to match or to offer
i piquant contrast. An interesting note
is the plaid bow of the same taffeta
ribbon as the binding on a plain
color sweater.
This fall, when so many important
1 colors arc dark off-blacks, a lumi
■ nous skin is almost essential.
