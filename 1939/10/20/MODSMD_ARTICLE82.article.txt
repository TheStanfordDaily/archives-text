# Fall Footwear Covers Up'
## 
### 
"Covcred-up" sl.oes for dress are
in again; open heels are out. Open
toes are still good but with smaller
openings for winter. The gaiter type
is most popular for dress shoes and
although suede is best for fall, kid
will always do.
Brown, blaek .and wine are the
most prominent colors and the new
port brown, a warm brown touch
i ing on wine, is very popular.
CLUMSY' SHOES
For quad wear, heavier sport
I shoes are in evidence and men's
J styles are influencing feminine foot
wear. In fact, one shoe shown by
I Paly merchants is difficult to dis—
; tinguish from *that of a Stanford
! rough, except, in some cases, by
I size.
Added to the foreign influence of
: the English brogue are the peasant
shoes of the Continent. These are
still being shown but with platform
crepe soles in place of the wooden
sabots. Still a favorite, however, is
the saddle shoe standby in brown
and white.

J toes are still shown and gold and

"Covcred-up" sl.oes for dress are
in again; open heels are out. Open
toes are still good but with smaller
openings for winter. The gaiter type
is most popular for dress shoes and
although suede is best for fall, kid
will always do.
Brown, blaek .and wine are the
most prominent colors and the new
port brown, a warm brown touch
i ing on wine, is very popular.
CLUMSY' SHOES
For quad wear, heavier sport
I shoes are in evidence and men's
J styles are influencing feminine foot
wear. In fact, one shoe shown by
I Paly merchants is difficult to dis—
; tinguish from *that of a Stanford
! rough, except, in some cases, by
I size.
Added to the foreign influence of
: the English brogue are the peasant
shoes of the Continent. These are
still being shown but with platform
crepe soles in place of the wooden
sabots. Still a favorite, however, is
the saddle shoe standby in brown
and white.
| For evening wear open heels and
J toes are still shown and gold and
J silver kid remain in first, place. And
| after that prom, for tired feet. Joyce
I has fashioned Capers, of soft kid
lined with plaid. Those fuzzy slip—
! ons, bunny scuds, ocntinue in the
| Stanford woman's lounging wear.
HOSIERY SHADES
Hosiery, this season, has left
| bright colors and gone over to the
' more blending shades. Flesh tones
j are all good. Mauve, a new greyed
| pui pie, blends nicely with wine,
; navy, and black footwear; brown
! beige, a dull brown ,is good for
i brown shoes; and a spicy, golden
| brown will go with anything.
Plain weaves arc best with a few
fancy toes and heels for evening. A
new shadow weave has been per
: fected for a sandal stocking as a
protection against the wear gained
in those 2:30 evenings of dancing,
j Mesh is no longer in favor.
