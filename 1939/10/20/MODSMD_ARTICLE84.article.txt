# Savelle Foresees Quick End To Second World Conflict
## Professor Argues Against Revision Of Present U.S. Neutrality Law 
### BETTY KLINE 
Asking that his remarks he considered merely tentative ones, and ex
plaining that "your guesswork is as good as mine," Max Savelle, associate
professor of history, told the International Relations Club yesterday after
noon that he did not expect the present war to be a long one.
Because of unexpectedly heavy attendance at the club's previous meet
ing this quarter in the Political Science Building, the group gathered in
the Women's Clubhouse for discus-^

sion.
NO FIGHT DESIRED
Nobody wanted to fight in the first
place, Savelle declared, adding that
he believed both sides were bluffing
and that it would be to the advan
tage of all belligerents if present ne
gotiations could be brought to a
peaceful conclusion.
Presenting a point of view some
what contrary to the one outlined by
Political Science Professor Graham
Stuart at the club meeting two weeks
ago, Savelle argued against revisions
of the neutrality act now under con
sideration in Washington.
ICKVISIONS ARE UNNEUTRAL
That proposed revisions are ''un
neutral" is his opinion, since Britain
;ind France with their extensive
.shipping interests would obviously
be in the position to benefit most
from a cash-and-carry trading op
portunity.
Economic intercourse with those
countries would serve to align Amer
ican sympathies even more on the
side of the Allies, he thinks, en
hancing the possibility of the United
States' being drawn into combat in
I heir defense.
The advantages of the artificial
prosperity through industrial ex
pansion to meet the war market
would be more than offset by busi
ness deflation that would follow with
ultimate peace, he feels.
NAZIS REACHING LIMITS
That Germany has almost reached
the natural limits of her expansion
is another of his ideas, since fur
ther encroachments on neighboring
territory would be blocked quite ef
fectively by Russian or Italian in
terests—and the Maginot Line.
Savelle's answer to the "Russian
riddle" is that the Soviets have no
immediate aggressive desires, are
merely playing a "smart game," and
will not allow Germany to become
too strong.
PEACE CONDITIONS NEEDED
Given peaceful conditions and a
few years to develop, Germany
would be able to establish one of the
most prosperous hegemonies in the
world, Savel'.e believes, since her
present enlarged territory will pro
vide her with virtual industrial and
agricultural self - sufficiency. Hs
added the viewpoint that future gen
erations living along the Danube
may forget the methods by which
their prosperity was obtained, re
taining merely thanks and reverence
for the man responsible for it.
Since controversial issues will be
disccussed at several future club
meetings, the gatherings will neces
sarily be closed ones; students wish
ing to join the International Rela
tions group should contact Julius
Leatham, Irvin Marlar, John O'Neill,
or Junius Cary.

That proposed revisions are ''un
neutral" is his opinion, since Britain
;ind France with their extensive
.shipping interests would obviously
be in the position to benefit most
from a cash-and-carry trading op
portunity.
Economic intercourse with those
countries would serve to align Amer
ican sympathies even more on the
side of the Allies, he thinks, en
hancing the possibility of the United
States' being drawn into combat in
I heir defense.
The advantages of the artificial
prosperity through industrial ex
pansion to meet the war market
would be more than offset by busi
ness deflation that would follow with
ultimate peace, he feels.
NAZIS REACHING LIMITS
That Germany has almost reached
the natural limits of her expansion
is another of his ideas, since fur
ther encroachments on neighboring
territory would be blocked quite ef
fectively by Russian or Italian in
terests—and the Maginot Line.
Savelle's answer to the "Russian
riddle" is that the Soviets have no
immediate aggressive desires, are
merely playing a "smart game," and
will not allow Germany to become
too strong.
PEACE CONDITIONS NEEDED
Given peaceful conditions and a
few years to develop, Germany
would be able to establish one of the
most prosperous hegemonies in the
world, Savel'.e believes, since her
present enlarged territory will pro
vide her with virtual industrial and
agricultural self - sufficiency. Hs
added the viewpoint that future gen
erations living along the Danube
may forget the methods by which
their prosperity was obtained, re
taining merely thanks and reverence
for the man responsible for it.
Since controversial issues will be
disccussed at several future club
meetings, the gatherings will neces
sarily be closed ones; students wish
ing to join the International Rela
tions group should contact Julius
Leatham, Irvin Marlar, John O'Neill,
or Junius Cary.
Asking that his remarks he considered merely tentative ones, and ex
plaining that "your guesswork is as good as mine," Max Savelle, associate
professor of history, told the International Relations Club yesterday after
noon that he did not expect the present war to be a long one.
Because of unexpectedly heavy attendance at the club's previous meet
ing this quarter in the Political Science Building, the group gathered in
the Women's Clubhouse for discus-^

sion.
NO FIGHT DESIRED
Nobody wanted to fight in the first
place, Savelle declared, adding that
he believed both sides were bluffing
and that it would be to the advan
tage of all belligerents if present ne
gotiations could be brought to a
peaceful conclusion.
Presenting a point of view some
what contrary to the one outlined by
Political Science Professor Graham
Stuart at the club meeting two weeks
ago, Savelle argued against revisions
of the neutrality act now under con
sideration in Washington.
