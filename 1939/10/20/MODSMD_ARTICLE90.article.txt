# Cottrell Offers Utility Theory for City Costs
## 
### 
Professor Edwin A. Cottrell, head
of the political science department,
supported the plan for using reve
nues from municipally owned utility
plants to defray the cost of city gov
ernment in an address given before
the tax convention at the Palace
Hotel in San Francisco yesterday.
Speaking before the joint session
of the Municipal Finance Officers'
Association and the National Tax
Association, Professor Cottrell dis
cussed "Experience of Selected Cities
in Supporting Government by the
Earnings of Utility Enterprises," us
ing Palo Alto, where he was formerly
councilman, as an example.
Professor Cottrell stated that in
Palo Alto, revenues from taxes have

always been far less than those from
utilities.
"Utility rates," snid Professor Cot
trell, "are lower than those of the
private utilities in the vicinity, and
yet are high enough to more than
cover the costs of plant operation.
The excess earnings are used to pay
general running expenses of the
municipality."
Increased city iftcome. according
to Professor Cottrell, has resulted in
the general improvement of the com
munity through the development and
operation of community centers,
public libraries, recreation areas,
harbor and airport improvement,
improved health service and in
creased fire and police protection.

Other cities which use this plan
are Wyandotte, Mich.; Ames, Iowa;
Tacoma, Wash., and Jacksonville,
Fla.
Six hundred delegates from the
joint convention held a meeting here
at the Memorial Theater Wednesday
morning.
