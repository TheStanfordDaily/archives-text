# Papooses to Tackle Fullerton Jaysee
## Shipkeymen Plan Strong Air Attack Backfill Will Lose Armstrong; Chimenti Tabbed to Fill Post 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Evidence that Coach Harry Ship
key expects his freshman eleven to
use the forward pass as their chief ,
weapon of destruction against Ful
lerton's invading gridmen tomorrow
was shown by the intensive pass
scrimmage that the Papooses went
through yesterday.
With the varsity resting this week
end, the frosh will take the grid
spotlight when they tangle with
Fullerton's heavy outfit at 2:30 to
morrow afternoon in the stadium.
ARMSTRONG MISSING
Even though they are minus the
services of their speedy and shifty
regular right halfback Eric Arm
strong, the Papooses, with their
highly developed passing attack, will
reign favorites against a team which
is renowned for its weak pass de
fense.
And in the key role, that of the
pass tosser, will be little A1 Cole.
Cole was passing so well yesterday
against the second stiing that it is
possible that he will take over the
tailback position while hefty Milt
Vuciriich moves from there over to
left halfback.
CHIMENTI TO PLAY
Starting in place of the injured
Armstrong will be stocky Johnny
Chimenti, who performed so well in
that capacity against U.S.C.'s frosh
last week. Closely pressing Chi
menti for that starting post is Red
Robinson, capable speed merchant j
from Pasadena.
Rounding out the backfield will
loe dependable Red Taylor, whose
line smashing on offense and line
backing on defense have been well
nigh flawless.
Also on hand for heavy duty in
the backfield will be Don Selby,
whose pitching arm sent; the second
string to a touchdown against the
first string last night, and Bob
Greening, a rawboned fullback who
has bowed many a good line.
STRONG WINGS
At the wing posts Shipkey has a
couple of lanky blond pass snag
gers in Bill Symes and Ed Stamm
plus Jack Tellefsen, a powerful
blocker, who may win the right to
start away from Symes.
The regular tackles, Bruno Ban
ducci and George Robinson, are well
backed up by Bob Millington, who
can play either tackle position, and
Roger Laverty, who plays at either
guard or tackle.
Starting at center will be Bill
Mannon, with Tony Medved, who
has plenty of experience, standing
ready to take over if Mannon's weak
ankle folds.

that capacity against U.S.C.'s frosh
last week. Closely pressing Chi
menti for that starting post is Red
Robinson, capable speed merchant j
from Pasadena.
Rounding out the backfield will
loe dependable Red Taylor, whose
line smashing on offense and line
backing on defense have been well
nigh flawless.
Also on hand for heavy duty in
the backfield will be Don Selby,
whose pitching arm sent; the second
string to a touchdown against the
first string last night, and Bob
Greening, a rawboned fullback who
has bowed many a good line.
STRONG WINGS
At the wing posts Shipkey has a
couple of lanky blond pass snag
gers in Bill Symes and Ed Stamm
plus Jack Tellefsen, a powerful
blocker, who may win the right to
start away from Symes.
The regular tackles, Bruno Ban
ducci and George Robinson, are well
backed up by Bob Millington, who
can play either tackle position, and
Roger Laverty, who plays at either
guard or tackle.
Starting at center will be Bill
Mannon, with Tony Medved, who
has plenty of experience, standing
ready to take over if Mannon's weak
ankle folds.
Evidence that Coach Harry Ship
key expects his freshman eleven to
use the forward pass as their chief ,
weapon of destruction against Ful
lerton's invading gridmen tomorrow
was shown by the intensive pass
scrimmage that the Papooses went
through yesterday.
With the varsity resting this week
end, the frosh will take the grid
spotlight when they tangle with
Fullerton's heavy outfit at 2:30 to
morrow afternoon in the stadium.
ARMSTRONG MISSING
Even though they are minus the
services of their speedy and shifty
regular right halfback Eric Arm
strong, the Papooses, with their
highly developed passing attack, will
reign favorites against a team which
is renowned for its weak pass de
fense.
And in the key role, that of the
pass tosser, will be little A1 Cole.
Cole was passing so well yesterday
against the second stiing that it is
possible that he will take over the
tailback position while hefty Milt
Vuciriich moves from there over to
left halfback.
CHIMENTI TO PLAY
Starting in place of the injured
Armstrong will be stocky Johnny
Chimenti, who performed so well in
that capacity against U.S.C.'s frosh
last week. Closely pressing Chi
