## Warner's Spartans Favored Over Tigers 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 19 (UP).—
| Football's '"duel of the deans" was a
| complete sell-out tonight, 24 hours
j before Amos Alonzo Stagg and Pop
j Warner, the game's "grand old men,"
1 pit their coaching genius against
| each other for the first time in 32
! years.
Stagg, now in his 50th year of
; coaching, leads his College of Pacific
i eleven against the San Jose State
i team on which Warner, whose
coaching covers 44 years, is advisory
coach in an annual "little school"
classic at Stockton tomorrow night.
The two coaches met only once
before on the football field. That
was in 1907 when Stagg was "tops"
in the Midwest with his University
of Chicago team, and Warner was
just coming up into prominence as
tutor of the Carlisle Indians.
Stagg. the favorite, suffered a sur
prising setback as the Indians, show
ing an amazingly deceptive attack
taught them by Warner, ran all over
the haughty Maroons for an 18-4
victory.
Tomorrow night Stagg is the un
derdog, for the odds are 2 to 1 San
Jose beats his Pacific Tigers before
a crowd of 12..000, all Baxter Stadium
at Stockton can hold.
