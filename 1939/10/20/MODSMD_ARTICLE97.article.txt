# Indians to Test New Plays As Husky Game Draws Near
## 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Just how well the Indian first string will execute Tiny Thornhill's new
plays under actual playing conditions will he determined this afternoon
on the practice field.
It will be the second consecutive scrimmage of the week, as the second
and third teams and a few subs saw action in yesterday's workout. The

i practice session was none too
I pressive when it came to any one |
team's putting on an offensive show.
However, both lines were tough to i
! push through when on defense,!
I mainly because of poor timing and j
undoubtedly because of the hick of j
| any great amount of intensive con- I
j centration during the week.
I As it was the backfield which first
1 went on the offensive—Mullin, Gal
larneau, Templeton, and Pool—had
! its troubles in getting started as the j
defense continually sifted through;
to stop the plays behind scrimmage, j
Doug Stahle, third string center!
backing up the line, was particularly ,
outstanding in stopping the attack, j
The offense scored after 20 minutes j
j of work on A pass from Mullin who j
j sparked the drive with two earlier \
bullet tosses which accounted for j
j most of the yardage. Pool at his new |
quarterback job looked impressive \
| but can stand another week of prac- j
lice. The only other regular to play
| was Andy Stojkovich at end, the
i others going to the showers early j
' after all hands had run through a '
; dummy workout for the better part I
i of the afternoon.
Monday through next Thursday, i
when the team entrains for Seattle I
Jto meet Washington, the coaching j
corps will have the gridders work- I
; ing on Husky defense measures and
! working out the Indians' own of-
I fensive to hit at Husky weaknesses.
