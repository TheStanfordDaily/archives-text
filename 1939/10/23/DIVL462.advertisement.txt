T\dciy there are about 1,000,000
cigar stores, drug stores, country and grocery stores where
you can buy cigarettes in the United States. These re
tailers, and the jobbers who serve them, have built up
a service of courtesy and convenience unmatched by any other
industry catering to the American public's pleasure.
There are another million people who
are engaged directly or indirectly in the transportation of
cigarettes to every town, hamlet and crossroads.
It IS ESTIMATED that there are 1,602,000
tobacco farmers raising tobacco in 20 out of the 4S
states. Good tobacco is one of the hardest crops to
raise and bring to market, requiring great skill and
patience from seed-bed planting to harvesting and cur
ing. The modern tobacco farmer has done well the job
of constantly improving the quality of his product.
XhE AVERAGE LENGTH of service of the 13,230
people working in the Chesterfield factories, storage
houses, leaf-handling and redrying plants is over 10
years. This means that every step in the making of
Chesterfields, regardless of how small, is handled by peo
ple who have had 10 years of experience and ability in
knowing their jobs.
Truly tobacco opens doors to fields where
people live, work and achieve, and Chesterfield lakes
pride in its ever increasing part in this great industry that
is devoted entirely to the pleasure of the American public.
To SMOKERS, Chesterfield Cigarettes have
always said, and now repeat, that in no other cigarette
made can you find the same degree ofreal mildnessand
good taste, or the same high quality of properly cured
and aged tobaccos. Chesterfield Cigarettes arc made
with one purpose 0n1y... to give smokers everywhere
the MILDER, BETTER-TASTING SMOKING VIE.A
SURE they want. You can't buy a better cigarette.
