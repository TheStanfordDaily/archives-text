### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
I lISTORY is made of little things.
The world can't totter on the
brink every night, hopping to the
master touch of a Stalin or Roose
velt or Hitler. The broad, cold, un
even path of foreign diplomacy may
provide the headlines, but the small
er yarns, slipping in with smooth
regularity every night on the Daily's
pounding teletype, make up the pat
tern of history's fabric.
In Sausalito Mrs. Eugene Zeitler
and Mrs. P. Best of the Parent-
Teachers Association were counting
the money of a P.TA. cake sale in
a vacant store when an automobile

crashed on through the opposite
wall. Neither Mrs. Best, Mrs. Zeit
ler, nor Wayne Renhard, the driver
of the car, was hurt.

wife and mother in the family
pew at St. James Episcopal Church

Nearly 200 persons stood in the
autumn sunshine outside the church
as the pastor read the prayer; the
small church was crowded to the
doors, and a lot of the parishioners
were unable to crowd inside to oc
cupy their family pews.
