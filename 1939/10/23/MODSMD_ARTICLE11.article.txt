# Hell-Week Tortures, Quests End as Houses Initiate 350
## 
### BUD AMES 
Campus fraternity men. both pledges and pounders, yesterday expressed
favor for the recently instituted three-day "hell week" period, during
which :i54) pledges became full-fledged Row men.
"We had a good hell-week. It was short, but it was plenty concen
trated and, of necessity, had to be well organized," said John West, D.U.

His statement was practically the
same, word for word, as those given
in other fraternity houses.
Don Kennedy, Zete senior, went a
step farther. "Our house and other
houses in general are in favor of
this new hell-week system because
we can get it out of the way before
rushing and before examinations,"
he said.
OTHERS AGREE
The Phi Kaps, the S.A.E.'s, the Phi
Delts, and the A.K.L.'s said much
the same things.
What did the pledges of last week
think concerning hell-week? The
pledges, very tired and still over
lorded by glaring uppcrclassmen,
thought that hell-week was "swell—
just, swell." A former pledge hit
the proverbial nail when he stated
that hell-week was like hitting your
self with a hammer because it was
so good when you stopped.
VARIOUS TORTURES
And torture. Everywhere there
was torture. Each house reported
its own special, not-too-practical
but very much favored joke. The
Phi Delts favored the clothes scram
ble, in which they made their
pledges, stripped and blindfolded,
scramble for their own articles of
clothes.
Phi Kap leaders liked best the
old-fashioned lire alarm. This alarm
was turned in for a fire in the fire
place which the pledges put out by
crawling to the third floor on their
hands and knees, getting a mouth
ful of alum-filled water and then
crawling downstairs again to spit the
water on the fire.
CHAIN GANG USED
The D.U.'s favored their chain
ing their pledges together and mak
ing them sleep thus in a small room.
The A.K.L.'s voted their all-night
campus quests as their favorite form
of torture.
Certainly most apropos torture of
the week was the air raid, whose
originators requested that their
name be withheld. In this game, the
pledges lay on their backs at the
bottom of the stairway well. They
were then bombarded with eggs by
upperclassmen from the third floor.
MEN ENJOYED IT
Yes, fraternity men enjoyed hell
week. But the sorority women ex
pressed rather hesitant appreciation.
"We didn't like being kept awake by
the noise, but we certainly enjoyed
having our cars washed by the
pledges of neighboring houses. At
least it's constructive," said a Dee
gee.
Most logical statement made con
cerning the last four days was made
by Verne Bassi, house manager for
the Phi Kaps. "It sure cuts down
house bills not feeding these
pledges," he laughed.

"We didn't like being kept awake by
the noise, but we certainly enjoyed
having our cars washed by the
pledges of neighboring houses. At
least it's constructive," said a Dee
gee.
Most logical statement made con
cerning the last four days was made
by Verne Bassi, house manager for
the Phi Kaps. "It sure cuts down
house bills not feeding these
pledges," he laughed.
Campus fraternity men. both pledges and pounders, yesterday expressed
favor for the recently instituted three-day "hell week" period, during
which :i54) pledges became full-fledged Row men.
"We had a good hell-week. It was short, but it was plenty concen
trated and, of necessity, had to be well organized," said John West, D.U.

His statement was practically the
same, word for word, as those given
in other fraternity houses.
Don Kennedy, Zete senior, went a
step farther. "Our house and other
houses in general are in favor of
this new hell-week system because
we can get it out of the way before
rushing and before examinations,"
he said.
OTHERS AGREE
The Phi Kaps, the S.A.E.'s, the Phi
Delts, and the A.K.L.'s said much
the same things.
What did the pledges of last week
think concerning hell-week? The
pledges, very tired and still over
lorded by glaring uppcrclassmen,
thought that hell-week was "swell—
just, swell." A former pledge hit
the proverbial nail when he stated
that hell-week was like hitting your
self with a hammer because it was
so good when you stopped.
VARIOUS TORTURES
And torture. Everywhere there
was torture. Each house reported
its own special, not-too-practical
but very much favored joke. The
Phi Delts favored the clothes scram
ble, in which they made their
pledges, stripped and blindfolded,
scramble for their own articles of
clothes.
Phi Kap leaders liked best the
old-fashioned lire alarm. This alarm
was turned in for a fire in the fire
place which the pledges put out by
crawling to the third floor on their
hands and knees, getting a mouth
ful of alum-filled water and then
crawling downstairs again to spit the
water on the fire.
CHAIN GANG USED
The D.U.'s favored their chain
ing their pledges together and mak
ing them sleep thus in a small room.
The A.K.L.'s voted their all-night
campus quests as their favorite form
of torture.
Certainly most apropos torture of
the week was the air raid, whose
originators requested that their
name be withheld. In this game, the
pledges lay on their backs at the
bottom of the stairway well. They
were then bombarded with eggs by
upperclassmen from the third floor.
MEN ENJOYED IT
Yes, fraternity men enjoyed hell
week. But the sorority women ex
pressed rather hesitant appreciation.
