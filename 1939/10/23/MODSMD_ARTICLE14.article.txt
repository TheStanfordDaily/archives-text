# Stalin Declares Russia Refuses to Fight Allies; Finland Solution Near
## Scandinavians Seek Trade Security Pact 
### United Press 
A peaceful solution of Soviet Rus
sia's demands on Finland appeared
in prospect Monday as negotiators
of the two nations prepared to get
together again behind the pink-stone
walls of the Kremlin in Moscow for
a give-and-take talk.
If Finland, with 000,000 troops
massed along the Russian frontier,

islands in the Gulf of Finland, to be

grad and Kronstadt. The islands are
of little use to Finland, but of enor
mous importance to Stalin.
Shrewdly, the Finns are refraining
from any boasts of their resistance to
more severe Soviet demands. They
say they are ready to meet the So
viets half-way.
GUNS QUIET
About the only action Sunday was
over the English and Scottish coasts
where German raiding and scouting
planes battled British planes and
anti-aircraft batteries. Air raid
' alarms shrieked again in Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire. The Air Ministry
anounced a German plane was shot
down off the southeast coast of Ire
land. The British claim to have shot
down eight German planes along
their coasts during the past week.
The war on the western front re
mained a "lace-cuff" affair, with only
