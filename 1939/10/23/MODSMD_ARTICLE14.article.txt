# Stalin Declares Russia Refuses to Fight Allies; Finland Solution Near
## Scandinavians Seek Trade Security Pact 
### United Press 
A peaceful solution of Soviet Rus
sia's demands on Finland appeared
in prospect Monday as negotiators
of the two nations prepared to get
together again behind the pink-stone
walls of the Kremlin in Moscow for
a give-and-take talk.
If Finland, with 000,000 troops
massed along the Russian frontier,
emerges from the Moscow talks
without having made the military
concessions to Josef V. Stalin which
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania made,
it may be regarded as somewhat of a
victory for the brand of collective
security.
The Scandinavians' collective se
curity is one without military pacts,
based solely on the moral justice of
long-standing neutrality and friend
ly relations with all powers. Den
mark, Norway and Sweden, having
watched the military pacts among
European nations become invitations
to war, gave prompt moral support
to Finland. The United States and
the other American republics like
wise gave support to Finland's atti
tude.
POWERS SUPPORT FINNS
Dispatches from Moscow today in
dicated that the foreign powers' sup
port. for the Finns had impressed
Stalin and that he is willing to fore
go any claims for a military alliance
and for defense bases on the Finnish
mainland. The Soviets probably will
be satisfied with three small Finnish
islands in the Gulf of Finland, to be
fortified for the defense of Lenin
grad and Kronstadt. The islands are
of little use to Finland, but of enor
mous importance to Stalin.
Shrewdly, the Finns are refraining
from any boasts of their resistance to
more severe Soviet demands. They
say they are ready to meet the So
viets half-way.
GUNS QUIET
About the only action Sunday was
over the English and Scottish coasts
where German raiding and scouting
planes battled British planes and
anti-aircraft batteries. Air raid
' alarms shrieked again in Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire. The Air Ministry
anounced a German plane was shot
down off the southeast coast of Ire
land. The British claim to have shot
down eight German planes along
their coasts during the past week.
The war on the western front re
mained a "lace-cuff" affair, with only
wary patrol and artillery action by
both Allies and Germans. German
troops dug into new positions in the
Warndt Forest near Saarbruecken.
The French press believed Adolf
Hitler is partly reluctant to open any
lull-force offensive on the western
front because he isn't getting far
with his new partner, Soviet Rus
sia. Paris newspapers contended that
Stalin has advised Hitler of Russia's
refusal to pledge any military aid
against Britain and France and that
the Fuehrer is in "somewhat of a
dilemma" because of uncertainty
over the positions of Russia and Italy.
ATHENIAN QUESTION FLAKES
The sinking of the British liner
Athenia continued to be the sub
ject of a "Who killed Cock Robin?"
game between Britain and Germany.
Survivors, both British and Amer
ican, have described how a German
U-boat torpedoed the liner.
The Germans contend that Win
ston Churchill, British First Lord
of the Admiralty, ordered it sunk.
Nazi Propaganda Minister Paul
Joseph Goebbels Sunday night in a
35-minute speech broadcast through
out the world accused Churchill of
ordering the Athenia sunk "in an
attempt to drag the United States
into the war."
At Hyde Park, N.Y., President
Roosevelt and his family sat in their
pew at St. James Episcopal Church
and heard the Rev. Frank R. Wilson
deliver a prayer from a Canadian
prayer book asking God to give
King George VI of Great Britain
strength to "overcome all of his en
emies."

game between Britain and Germany.
Survivors, both British and Amer
ican, have described how a German
U-boat torpedoed the liner.
The Germans contend that Win
ston Churchill, British First Lord
of the Admiralty, ordered it sunk.
Nazi Propaganda Minister Paul
Joseph Goebbels Sunday night in a
35-minute speech broadcast through
out the world accused Churchill of
ordering the Athenia sunk "in an
attempt to drag the United States
into the war."
At Hyde Park, N.Y., President
Roosevelt and his family sat in their
pew at St. James Episcopal Church
and heard the Rev. Frank R. Wilson
deliver a prayer from a Canadian
prayer book asking God to give
King George VI of Great Britain
strength to "overcome all of his en
emies."
A peaceful solution of Soviet Rus
sia's demands on Finland appeared
in prospect Monday as negotiators
of the two nations prepared to get
together again behind the pink-stone
walls of the Kremlin in Moscow for
a give-and-take talk.
If Finland, with 000,000 troops
massed along the Russian frontier,
emerges from the Moscow talks
without having made the military
concessions to Josef V. Stalin which
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania made,
it may be regarded as somewhat of a
victory for the brand of collective
security.
The Scandinavians' collective se
curity is one without military pacts,
based solely on the moral justice of
long-standing neutrality and friend
ly relations with all powers. Den
mark, Norway and Sweden, having
watched the military pacts among
European nations become invitations
to war, gave prompt moral support
to Finland. The United States and
the other American republics like
wise gave support to Finland's atti
tude.
POWERS SUPPORT FINNS
Dispatches from Moscow today in
dicated that the foreign powers' sup
port. for the Finns had impressed
Stalin and that he is willing to fore
go any claims for a military alliance
and for defense bases on the Finnish
mainland. The Soviets probably will
be satisfied with three small Finnish
islands in the Gulf of Finland, to be
fortified for the defense of Lenin
grad and Kronstadt. The islands are
of little use to Finland, but of enor
mous importance to Stalin.
Shrewdly, the Finns are refraining
from any boasts of their resistance to
more severe Soviet demands. They
say they are ready to meet the So
viets half-way.
GUNS QUIET
About the only action Sunday was
over the English and Scottish coasts
where German raiding and scouting
planes battled British planes and
anti-aircraft batteries. Air raid
' alarms shrieked again in Yorkshire
and Lincolnshire. The Air Ministry
anounced a German plane was shot
down off the southeast coast of Ire
land. The British claim to have shot
down eight German planes along
their coasts during the past week.
The war on the western front re
mained a "lace-cuff" affair, with only
wary patrol and artillery action by
both Allies and Germans. German
troops dug into new positions in the
Warndt Forest near Saarbruecken.
The French press believed Adolf
Hitler is partly reluctant to open any
lull-force offensive on the western
front because he isn't getting far
with his new partner, Soviet Rus
sia. Paris newspapers contended that
Stalin has advised Hitler of Russia's
refusal to pledge any military aid
against Britain and France and that
the Fuehrer is in "somewhat of a
dilemma" because of uncertainty
over the positions of Russia and Italy.
