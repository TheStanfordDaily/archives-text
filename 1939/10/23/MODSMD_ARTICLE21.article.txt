# Soviet Leader Sends Decision To Der Fuehrer
## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 22 (UP).—Josef V.
Stalin was reported by the French
press tonight to have .sent a message
to Chancellor Adolf Hitler containing
Soviet Russia's categorical refusal to
commit herself to any military action
against Great Britain and France.
Stalin's message, in reply to an
appeal from Hitler delivered by h
personal emissary last week-end,
was reported here to have rejected
the Fuehrer's bid for Soviet military
aid on land and in the air.
REFUSES FULL SUPPORT
According to the French version
of Stalin's answer, the Soviet leader
consented to participate in a com
mon German-Soviet declaration on
the present political situation—prob
ably much along the lines of yester
day's government statement in Jz
vestia—but refused to inform the
world that Russia is ready to support
the Reich on all points and decisions.
The Kremlin, it was said, was care
ful to avoid committments on any
formula which would engage Soviet
Russia to an extent more binding
than her present obligations, as
sumed by Stalin in the recent Mos
cow talks with German Foreign Min
ister Joachim von Ribbentrop.
STALIN TO All) HITLER
Stalin is expected in French cir
cles to keep his promise to Hitler to
work for the improvement of Ger
man-Russian relations, as was re
vealed by Saturday's disclosure of
the release of 3,000 Germans from
Russian prisons and today's an
nouncement of the extension of trade
relations between Berlin and Mn«-
cow.
French quarters said, however,
they were convinced that Russia
will refuse to enter the war—on
either side—at any price.
Russia's material aid to Germany
also will he limited, it was con
tended by French political writers,
because the Soviets are demanding
payment in gold for all cereals, min
erals, and oils delivered to Germany.
