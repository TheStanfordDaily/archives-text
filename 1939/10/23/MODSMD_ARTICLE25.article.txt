MADERA, Oct. 22 (UP).—An aug- !
men ted police force patrolled this |
strike-troubled city today to pre- I
vent a recurrence of outbreaks be- i
tween cot lon farmers and striking
cotton pickers.
Several hundred farmers, taking j
matters into their own hands,
"purged" the county park of 400
strikers in a brief foray of hand
to-hand fighting, driving the strik
ers before them.
Today many farmers, reporting
they had been threatened with "ar- .
son and sabotage" as a retaliatory j
measure, armed themselves with
shotguns and patrolled their ranches.
CROWD GATHERS
Three hundred farmers gathered
at a Chowchilla gin on the report
that it whs to be burned, but nothing
happened.
The sheriff's office reported many j
strikers apparently had left the |
county as the result of Saturday's j
fracas and the unrelenting attitude j
of the farmers toward the strike. ;
Authorities also reported several
strikers had been evicted from
houses on cotton farms because they
"refused to work."
The strike was called by the C.1.0.
United Cannery, Agricultural, Pack- j
mg and Allied Workers of America j
in a demand for a wage increase over |
the 80-90 cent wage scale.

reported on local farms, and cotton |
picking was going ahead with non- |
striking employees.
With 20 of their leaders in jail and |
their Madera meeting place closed
to them, many strikers gathered at
the West ranch a mile and a half j
out of town and pitched tents for •
temporary shelter.
In the city police refused to let )
persons congregate on the street or j
in the county park.
