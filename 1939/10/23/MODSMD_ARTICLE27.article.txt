### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 21 (UP).
â€”The Golden Gate International Ex
position today played to its last
scheduled week-end throng as
thousands hurried to get a last sight
of the show, which will close, pos
sibly forever, one week from today.
The exposition will close Oct. 29. a
month earlier than originally
planned.
At 3:20 p.m. today, 109,220 per
sons had swarmed through the
turnstiles. The figure was about
13,000 less for the hour than for last
Sunday. A new week-end attend
ance record, exceeding the 250,000
average for the last two week-ends,
was apparently assured.
