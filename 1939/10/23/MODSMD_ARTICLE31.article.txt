### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22 (UP). —Speakers for the Senate isolationist
bloc attacked the Administration's neutrality revision bill tonight and lead
ers of both factions forecast a final vote in the upper house this week.
Senators William E. Borah. R., Idaho, and Gerald P. Nye, R., N.1).,
.spoke over National Broadcasting Company networks. Both contended

that repeal of the arms embargo
crux of the controversy which en- j
ters its fourth week in the Senate
tomorrow —would be the first step j
toward involving America in the Eu- >
ropean war.
Neither conceded defeat for the I
isolationists, but all polls indicated j
that only a major upset can deny an j
Administration triumph. The Ad- I
ministration when Senate leaders.
were less certain. Surveys by Demo- j
cratic leaders and reports to Senate
isolationists indicated that repeal
ists had a majority of only 15 votes.
ABANDON CREDIT CLAUSE
That margin was expected to be
increased or reduced by the form in j
which the legislation passes the Sen- j
ate. Some doubtful votes in both !
chambers were won over to the Ad- j
miristration when Senate leaders I
abandoned the 90-day credit provi- j
sion concerning purchases of Ameri- j
can products by belligerents, and j
agreed to relax strict shipping re- j
striclions.
The possibility remained that j
some compromise proposal for a !
limited aims embargo coupled with !
a strict cash-and-carry plan might j
attract sufficient votes to overrun j
the Administration's apple cart, j
Some saw such a threat in an j
amendment offered by Senator Sher- j
idan Downey, D., Calif., which;
would embargo sale of munitions to \
all but American nations fighting a j
war against non-American nations. ;
BRITISH FAVOR BILL
Borah coupled the cause of the j
isolationists tonight with a sharp at- j
tack upon Lord Lothian, Birtish am- !
bassador to the United States, for a I
statement in which lie "boldly de- ;
nounced" the present: neutrality law. '
Declaring that the British opposed i
the embargo from the outset and '
were engaged in seeking to scrap it. i
Borah quoted Lothian as saying that j
the house of cards created by the
neutrality law "was fatally under- j
mined during the last week of Sep
tember.
"With some degree of pride he '
must look down from the Senate j
gallery, if he deigns to visit that
humble scene, and note the progress '
toward repeal of the law he so early
and boldly denounced," he said.
