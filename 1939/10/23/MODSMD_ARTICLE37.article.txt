# Papooses Scalp Fullerton Jaysee, 39-0
## Frosh Team Hurls Way To Victory Yearlings Stage Big Air Circus; Cole's Passing Paves Way 
### 
Turning perfect passes from the
pitching arm of little A1 Cole and
stray tosses from the arms of then
opponents into points, Stanford's
freshman football eleven trampled
Fullerton Junior College, 39-0, here
on last Saturday afternoon.
Though the dependable players
came through as was expected and
several new stars were uncovered,
the boy that brought the frosh bench
to its feet with a roar of approval
was Hank Norberg, who, though in
jured, went in to convert the fourth
try for point.
The first quarter was mainly a
punting duel with Cole matching
lofty boots with Walker of the Jay
see team. However, on the first play
<>l the second quarter, Cole toured
end for 10 yards and the first first
down of the game. This seemed to
be the signal for the avalanche of
Card touchdowns.
The first score: Early in the second
quarter Red Taylor intercepted a
Fullerton pass on the Jaysees' 18-
yard line and rambled the whole
distance to a touchdown. The try
for point was blocked.
The second score: About three
minutes later the yearlings pene
trated to the opposition's 12-yard
line only to have their drive ap
parently ended by a holding pen
alty which set them back to the 27.
Then Cole faded way back to about
the 40, took plenty of time, and
pitched a perfect strike into the
arms of Ed Eta mm, who was but
two strides from pay dirt. This time
the conversion was short.
The third score: In the third quar
ter, after stopping a Fullerton drive
on the four-yard line, the Cards took
over on their own 20 and rolled
80 yards to score finally on a four
yard smash at tackle by Vucinich.
The fourth score: Again in the
fhird quarter, as a result of a slug
ging penalty, a holding penalty, and
a 15-yard pass, Don Selby to Bill
Hanlon, the frosh moved to Fuller
ton's 3. On the third attempt, Selby
went over for a touchdown. This
time Norberg converted.
The fifth score: In the final
quarter. Hanlon, sub quarterback
who was all over the place last Sat
urday, hauled down a frantic Jay
see pass, again on the Jaysee's 18,
and toured the distance into the end
zone. Hanlon added the extra point.
The sixth score: Cole threw an
other touchdown pass, this one good
for 27 yards, to Peter Gadd on the
four-yard line about 4 minutes be
fore the final gun. Cole made the
try for extra point good.
