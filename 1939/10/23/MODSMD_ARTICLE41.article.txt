# U.C.L.A. Licks Card Splashers
## Championship Hopes Not Dashed by Loss 
### 
A close game with Stanford on the
i short end of the score placed Indian
hopes for a conference water polo
championship back a peg last Sat
| urda'y when the locals lost to U. C.
L. A., 5 to 3, at Encina pool.
Alter quelling a first period spree
j by the visitors, the Cardinals were
: always within one goal of the South
i em seven until the closing minutes.
Bad passing ruined the offensive ef
forts of the Indians who went to
pieces in evident desperation at be
ing behind and playing a losing game
to the clock.
OFFENSE LEADERS
Don Mitchell, U.C.L.A. forward,
| with three goals; Christy Christian
j son and Red Siegel with one each led
i the offensive attack for ihe winning
seven.
Mitchell was the main cog of the
! Bruin attack, flipping passes to po
i tential scorers when he himself did
| not counter.
Captain Bob Plate, Dick Hoover
I and Bill Bleecker rang the net for
j Stanford scores.
The unexpected loss does not
i shove Stanford out of the title pic
, ture, however, and it may* be that
j next Saturday's non-conference tilt
, with the Olympic Club will decide
I the strongest team in the nation.
