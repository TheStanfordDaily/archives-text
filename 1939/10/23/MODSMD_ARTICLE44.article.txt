# SIDELINE SLANTS
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
NO. NO. SAY
IT ISN'T SO
It feels good to be pounding the
tripewriter (advisedly used) again
after a sojourn in the Rest Home
during which Frank Guthrie, as- ,
sistant sports editor, graciously took
over Slants.
But, on second thought, maybe I
should relinquish Slants again and ;
head back up Alvarado Avenue. Be- ,
cause I have come to the conclusion i
that seventh-place Stanford is prob
ably the third — maybe second —
strongest team in the Pacific Coast 1
Conference. Such a conclusion is
the result of a fevered brow; no ab- J
solutely sane person could ever ut
ter such a statement.
Tsk, tsk. here Stanford loses two
conference games and ties another,
and this guy claims its the third best
team in the conference. What gall,
iX'hat nerve!
But, just the same, take a look at
the conference teams as they stand
now, and at the same time remem
ber Stanford off its U.C.L.A. per
formance and the probable improve- |
ment after working on plays for the
two weeks:
U.S.C.—Undoubtedly the best in
the conference on paper. Could
possibly beat any team in the !
country—again on paper.
U.C.L.A. — It's about a dead
heat in our mind which is best
between the Bruins and the Cards.
If the Bruins have any edge at
all. it's because of their "black- i
field" (non-original).
Oregon State — After looking
like world beaters against Indians
in the season-opener, the Beavers
have bogged down, although they
siill haven't been defeated. Beat
"powerful*' Idaho by one point,
"mighty" Portland U. by two
points, and were outplayed by low
ly Washington last Saturday, even
in victory. It looks like maybe
that big Beaver line is softening
up.
Oregon—That upset by Gonzaga
really doesn't prove much, as the
Webfoots were in for a natural let
down after three hard conference
games. However, the Oregonians
haven't really improved much since
the season started, and most of the
other teams have. Of course, it can
always be said that the Webfoots
didn't need to improve nearly as
! much as the other outfits.
California—After a weak start
\ this season the Bears are looking
better, but there is a decided lack
. of talent over at Berkeley this year.

Artoe in the line, and Hatcher in
the backfield about complete the
Bears' honor roll, now that Louie
Smith is injured. But you know
just how much the Big Game de
pends upon previous showings. Darn
little.
Washington State — Mere child's
play.
Washington — Stanford certainly
figures better than the Huskies
but Slants privately thinks that
Washington is a lot tougher outfit
than its record of three conference
defeats indicates.
So-o-o, our fevered head figures
that actually Stanford is the third
best team —maybe second in the
conference at present.
Of course, they still pay off on
the basis of conference standings, we
hear. Silly iradition.

ably the third — maybe second —
strongest team in the Pacific Coast 1
Conference. Such a conclusion is
the result of a fevered brow; no ab- J
solutely sane person could ever ut
ter such a statement.
Tsk, tsk. here Stanford loses two
conference games and ties another,
and this guy claims its the third best
team in the conference. What gall,
iX'hat nerve!
But, just the same, take a look at
the conference teams as they stand
now, and at the same time remem
ber Stanford off its U.C.L.A. per
formance and the probable improve- |
ment after working on plays for the
two weeks:
U.S.C.—Undoubtedly the best in
the conference on paper. Could
possibly beat any team in the !
country—again on paper.
U.C.L.A. — It's about a dead
heat in our mind which is best
between the Bruins and the Cards.
If the Bruins have any edge at
all. it's because of their "black- i
field" (non-original).
Oregon State — After looking
like world beaters against Indians
in the season-opener, the Beavers
have bogged down, although they
siill haven't been defeated. Beat
"powerful*' Idaho by one point,
"mighty" Portland U. by two
points, and were outplayed by low
ly Washington last Saturday, even
in victory. It looks like maybe
that big Beaver line is softening
up.
Oregon—That upset by Gonzaga
really doesn't prove much, as the
Webfoots were in for a natural let
down after three hard conference
games. However, the Oregonians
haven't really improved much since
the season started, and most of the
other teams have. Of course, it can
always be said that the Webfoots
didn't need to improve nearly as
! much as the other outfits.
California—After a weak start
\ this season the Bears are looking
better, but there is a decided lack
. of talent over at Berkeley this year.

Artoe in the line, and Hatcher in
the backfield about complete the
Bears' honor roll, now that Louie
Smith is injured. But you know
just how much the Big Game de
pends upon previous showings. Darn
little.
Washington State — Mere child's
play.
Washington — Stanford certainly
figures better than the Huskies
but Slants privately thinks that
Washington is a lot tougher outfit
than its record of three conference
defeats indicates.
So-o-o, our fevered head figures
that actually Stanford is the third
best team —maybe second in the
conference at present.
Of course, they still pay off on
the basis of conference standings, we
hear. Silly iradition.

It feels good to be pounding the
tripewriter (advisedly used) again
after a sojourn in the Rest Home

over Slants.
But, on second thought, maybe I
