# Embarrassing Moment

THE man behind the newspaper is sitting
warm and satisfied, drinking his morning
coffee. He is pleased with himself, and with
the world, because luck has allowed him to
guess right again.
"I knew this would happen. As sure as I'm
sitting here, I knew it," fifty million Americans
are saying today as they read the report from
Paris that Josef Stalin has refused Hitler mili
tary aid against England.
There is nothing remarkable about their prog
nostications; the entire world knows that Soviet
Russia is out to wring all it can from the rest
of Europe in the current war. Stalin actually is
no more sympathetic toward Hitler than he is
toward Chamberlain.
Moving troops into Poland after the German
invasion not only won a large slice of contigu
ous territory for the U.S.S.R., but it kept the
Nazis from becoming a menace to the sanctity
of the Russian border. And in those early days
of the war the soldiers of the Red Army and
the brown-shirted troops were buddies.
But, now that Mr. Chamberlain has hood
winked Poland into giving up all claims to the
territory snatched from her by Russia, and Herr
Hitler is ready to concentrate his attention on
the Western Front, Comrade Stalin is going
to put away his guns. After all, the Soviet has
nothing to gain by sacrificing men to the con
quest of a western power.
And so, with the war only a little more than
seven weeks old, it appears that very soon the
Nazis may be left to face the Allies alone.
To some people the prospect is very amus
ingâ€”but not to Adolf Hitler.
