# What Are the Odds?

EVERYONE is getting a little tired of wonder
ing whether or not the A.S.S.U. is going to
sponsor an after-the-Big Game dance.
Each day a fresh crop of reports and rumors
about available bands and country clubs is un
leased, but there never is any word definite
enough to justify a man's getting' a date or a
girl's accepting one. The whole thing is a
mystery, but not a particularly fascinating one.
However, tomorrow night the mystery will
be solved. After considering Cardinals' pros
pects for putting on a successful dance, the
members of Ex Committee will vote to deter
mine whether the Associated Students will
sponsor one or not.
This decision should have been made sooner,
but several obstacles have been standing in
the way. It is difficult to obtain the use of a
country club on Big Game night because most
of those on the Peninsula are giving dances for
their own members. Big name bands do not
come a dime a dozen in Northern Californiaâ€”
in fact they often are very hard to find.
However, the game is still a month away.
And tomorrow night Cardinals will be able to
submit four eligible dance orchestras and one
appropriate country club for the approval of
Ex Committee.
Unquestionably a demand for such a func
tion exists on the campus, and unless some
major obstacle, such as unreasonable financial
risk, presents itself, the student representatives
are morally bound to vote in favor of it.
In fact, Lloyds is quoting three to one that
Stanford will have a Big Game dance.
