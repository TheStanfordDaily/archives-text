# Soliloquy

### 
EVERY year at this time The Daily, a trifle
self-consciously perhaps, chooses a new
crop of freshmen and junior transfers to add
to its editorial staff; self-consciously, because it
can't quite escape the feeling that it is com
peting just a little with the University for the
students' efforts, energy, and even education.
It would seem obvious that for every hour a
staff member spends working on The Daily, he
loses an hour's worth of education. Actually
that is poppycock. In most cases the hour spent
on The Daily working is an hour which would

have been used loafing. The hitch is, how con
structive is the work?
Now some will say that hour of work has
utilitarian value, because who the hell are you
after all if you aren't out for some activity?
Others will take it from another angle: an
activity as comprehensive as The Daily, say,
will be remembered longer and much more
vividly than any other side of college life. So.
It is more important.
This is very close to cynicism. It implies that
a university is at best a trade school, something
which teaches you how to get a job, teaches
you some good redeemable facts, and little else.
It implies that learning and culture went out
with the Middle Ages. As perhaps they did.
Perhaps it is some old archaic, medieval ghost
who gently haunts the Shack on the day of
appointments and makes it feel, almost uncon
sciously, that it would be rather nice if everyone
majored in history and traded four years of
college for an education.
But perhaps it is merely some decadent, di
lettante ghost who whispers this.â€”D. J.
