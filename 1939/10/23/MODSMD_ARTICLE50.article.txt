### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CURTAIN
IT IS a great tribute to the human mind that almost
any person at all, without training, is such a will
ing authority on such a variety of subjects. How pro
found an insight into twentieth century problems the
Almighty must have had as long ago as Adam's and
Eve's birth! Here we are, each with the innate ability
to diagnose football games, colds, headaches, politics,
and plays. Just ask us.
The Stanford campus seems to be particularly
blessed with natural dramatists, able to criticize our
theater program on the basis of remarkably limited
knowledge. "Why doesn't the department put on
plays that students like to see?" they will ask, with
out the slightest conception of what plays they are
talking about. "Something's wrong with that theater,"
they will quote someone as saying, without bothering
to acknowledge that Ihe information is second-hand.
"Can't understand it," is usually the climactic argu
ment. And this pinnacle of criticism is generally fol
lowed with the words of wonder: "Big, beautiful the
ater building; lots of equipment; plenty of students;
I wonder what's the matter?"
I>EFORE we accept the testimony of hearsay-experts,
it might be well to do some independent thinking
for ourselves. Stanford has a beautiful theater and
good equipment—that much we can all see is true.
Furthermore, the managerial outlook for 1939 is good,
or at least it can be good with student support. As a
matter of fact, this latter factor—student support—has
in many cases been the only thing lacking for success
ful performances. But that usually does not occur to
student critics.
Even a few of the men and women actually work
ing in the theater do not apparently realize the in
valuable importance of wholehearted, unprejudiced
student co-operation. Bull Session would be the last
voice raised against justified and intelligent criticism.
Even Hortense knows us to be anything but saccha
rine. Daily reviewers, for instance, have a perfect
right to do honest reviewing. It is not against them
that this criticism of criticism is aimed.
But the person who nags is not a critic. If Stan
ford's drama is to achieve the excellence that we all
demand of it, we must'take pride in supporting it with
our interest and with thoughtful comment. If this
intelligent interest is maintained, Stanford shall have
gone a long way toward improving its drama by the
end of this year.
Let's abandon intuitive criticism, predicated on gos
sip, and help build the theater we all want. Person
ally, I am willing to bet my car and my roommate's
bike, against two scats in eighth row center, that Me
morial Theater will see some of Stanford's best pro
ductions in 1939.

ally, I am willing to bet my car and my roommate's
bike, against two scats in eighth row center, that Me
morial Theater will see some of Stanford's best pro
ductions in 1939.
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CURTAIN
IT IS a great tribute to the human mind that almost
any person at all, without training, is such a will
ing authority on such a variety of subjects. How pro
found an insight into twentieth century problems the
Almighty must have had as long ago as Adam's and
Eve's birth! Here we are, each with the innate ability
to diagnose football games, colds, headaches, politics,
and plays. Just ask us.
The Stanford campus seems to be particularly
blessed with natural dramatists, able to criticize our
theater program on the basis of remarkably limited
knowledge. "Why doesn't the department put on
plays that students like to see?" they will ask, with
out the slightest conception of what plays they are
talking about. "Something's wrong with that theater,"
they will quote someone as saying, without bothering
to acknowledge that Ihe information is second-hand.
"Can't understand it," is usually the climactic argu
ment. And this pinnacle of criticism is generally fol
lowed with the words of wonder: "Big, beautiful the
ater building; lots of equipment; plenty of students;
I wonder what's the matter?"
I>EFORE we accept the testimony of hearsay-experts,
it might be well to do some independent thinking
for ourselves. Stanford has a beautiful theater and
good equipment—that much we can all see is true.
Furthermore, the managerial outlook for 1939 is good,
or at least it can be good with student support. As a
matter of fact, this latter factor—student support—has
in many cases been the only thing lacking for success
ful performances. But that usually does not occur to
student critics.
Even a few of the men and women actually work
ing in the theater do not apparently realize the in
valuable importance of wholehearted, unprejudiced
student co-operation. Bull Session would be the last
voice raised against justified and intelligent criticism.
Even Hortense knows us to be anything but saccha
rine. Daily reviewers, for instance, have a perfect
right to do honest reviewing. It is not against them
that this criticism of criticism is aimed.
But the person who nags is not a critic. If Stan
ford's drama is to achieve the excellence that we all
demand of it, we must'take pride in supporting it with
our interest and with thoughtful comment. If this
intelligent interest is maintained, Stanford shall have
gone a long way toward improving its drama by the
end of this year.
Let's abandon intuitive criticism, predicated on gos
sip, and help build the theater we all want. Person
ally, I am willing to bet my car and my roommate's
bike, against two scats in eighth row center, that Me
morial Theater will see some of Stanford's best pro
ductions in 1939.
