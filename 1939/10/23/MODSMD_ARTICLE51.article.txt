'REPRESENTATIVES OF TIIE VESTED INTERESTS'

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I'd like to know how the Committee on Public
Exercises defines students' rights, and whether they
consider it advisable to pay more attention to our
capitalistic backing than the development of indi
viduals with powers or judgment, not restricted to the
ivory tower but rather practiced on the situations
existing in the world. Also, what does President Wil
bur call a closed meeting?
It may be that, as students of Stanford University,
we entei'ed into a contract with the Administration,
legally binding us to hold no public meetings not sanc
tioned by the University. It may be that the Univer
sity chooses to coerce us, with its strategic position
into forfeiting what rights we may have by threaten
ing us with expellation, or mulcting, or work on the
wood pile: I prefer some fairly clear statement of
principle, made by those in authority, so that we
will know which of our intended actions are al
lowed . . .
President Wilbur's comment on the recently pro
posed gathering of the A.S.U. to have authorities rep
resentative of both sides discuss the controversial issue
of the Russo-German pact was that such a gathei'ing
would be taken as a "sounding board" of University
opinion by outside interests, or the "outside world . . ."
* * * *
A RE we to be protected from controversial issues
till we gradually and safely become representa
tives of the vested interests, with no eye to, or devel
oped critical capacity for, the advisability of change?
Ls that the purpose of the Committee on Public Exer
cises which seems to seek to prevent discussion of
certain topics, not because of the manner of the discus
sion but because of the topics themselves?
President Wilbur, in the comment referred to above,
said that "students could hold closed meetings with
speakers of their own choosing, without University
interference." What does President Wilbur call a
closed meeting? Does it mean that only the students
present at the time of the proposal of the meeting can
attend, that only the students belonging to the organi
zation sponsoring the meeting can attend, that only
the students belonging to the organization and profes
sors can attend, that only the students who received
news of the meeting from the University Administra
tion can attend, or—something else?
I'd like to have these questions answered by those
in authority and capable of answering; I think both
the answers and the questions should be published in
the University "sounding board," The Daily. I think
that the answers, if properly stated, will clear up much
that has been muddled in Stanford University for a
long time . . .
Sincerely yours,
David Richard Maxwell

into forfeiting what rights we may have by threaten
ing us with expellation, or mulcting, or work on the
wood pile: I prefer some fairly clear statement of
principle, made by those in authority, so that we
will know which of our intended actions are al
lowed . . .
President Wilbur's comment on the recently pro
posed gathering of the A.S.U. to have authorities rep
resentative of both sides discuss the controversial issue
of the Russo-German pact was that such a gathei'ing
would be taken as a "sounding board" of University
opinion by outside interests, or the "outside world . . ."
* * * *
A RE we to be protected from controversial issues
till we gradually and safely become representa
tives of the vested interests, with no eye to, or devel
oped critical capacity for, the advisability of change?
Ls that the purpose of the Committee on Public Exer
cises which seems to seek to prevent discussion of
certain topics, not because of the manner of the discus
sion but because of the topics themselves?
President Wilbur, in the comment referred to above,
said that "students could hold closed meetings with
speakers of their own choosing, without University
interference." What does President Wilbur call a
closed meeting? Does it mean that only the students
present at the time of the proposal of the meeting can
attend, that only the students belonging to the organi
zation sponsoring the meeting can attend, that only
the students belonging to the organization and profes
sors can attend, that only the students who received
news of the meeting from the University Administra
tion can attend, or—something else?
I'd like to have these questions answered by those
in authority and capable of answering; I think both
the answers and the questions should be published in
the University "sounding board," The Daily. I think
that the answers, if properly stated, will clear up much
that has been muddled in Stanford University for a
long time . . .

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I'd like to know how the Committee on Public
Exercises defines students' rights, and whether they
consider it advisable to pay more attention to our
capitalistic backing than the development of indi
viduals with powers or judgment, not restricted to the
ivory tower but rather practiced on the situations
existing in the world. Also, what does President Wil
bur call a closed meeting?
It may be that, as students of Stanford University,
we entei'ed into a contract with the Administration,
legally binding us to hold no public meetings not sanc
tioned by the University. It may be that the Univer
sity chooses to coerce us, with its strategic position
into forfeiting what rights we may have by threaten
ing us with expellation, or mulcting, or work on the
wood pile: I prefer some fairly clear statement of
principle, made by those in authority, so that we
