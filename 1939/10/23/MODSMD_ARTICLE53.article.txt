# San Franciscans Applaud Flagstad in Greatest Role
## 
### 
As long as their art forms have been known to man, the poet, the painter,
and the musician, each in his own medium have been striving to repro
duce the rapture of love. No one lias captured the combined essences of
jthe physical and the spiritual as successfully as did Richard Wagner
when he wrote his music drama, "Tristan und Isolde."

Last Friday night, Kirsten Flag-<
stad, unquestionably the world's
greatest Isolde, >ang the role before
a packed house in San Francisco's
War Memorial Opera House. Flag
stad had said, two years ago, that
she would never return to San Fran
cisco in opera again. The grateful
city was overjoyed to see her back
in this favorite role and it wel
comed her accordingly.
"Tristan" because of its unearthly
beauty of music, both orchestral
and vocal, demands that the cast be
near perfect. Friday night's cast was
all that the purist could ask. Of
course, Melchior ranks with Flag
stad as one of the greatest living
interpreters of Wagner. There's no
other man living who could sing
Tristan as he does, and the team
work between these two operatic
titans is superb.
Surprises of the evening came in
the performance of Alexander Kip
nis, who made his San Francisco
debut as King Mark. Kipnis' bass
is as deep as Ihey come, yet his
every note is clear and distinct, and
his whole performance was rem
iniscent of the unforgettable Chal
iapin.
As Kurvenal, Julius Huehn was at
his very best, as he always is in this
part. Kathryn Meisle, in the familiar
Brangane role, was capable, as usual.
Melchior and Flagstad sang the

"Leibesnacht" duet with all the in
tensity of passion and clarity of tone
that they, and only they, can com
mand, and the curtains parted again
as the audience cheered wildly.
Edwin McArthur, who conducted
at Flagstad's request, did a work
manlike and mechanical job. Had
the orchestra not played so loud,
co-operation between it and the
singers could have been better.â€”
