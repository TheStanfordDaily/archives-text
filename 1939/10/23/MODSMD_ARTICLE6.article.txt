# 'Great Divide' Opens Season
## Players, Director Gel 'A' for Effort 
### JEAN NOWELL 
The newly formed Stanford Play
ers deserve an "A" for effort on their
production of "The Great Divide,"
which opened Stanford's dramatic
season last Friday and Saturday
nights in Memorial Hall.
Sensitive direction by Everett
Glass, lecturer in dramatics, and
magnificent sets combined with a
number of excellent performances,
however, were not enough to hide
the fact that, while "The Great Di
vide" had a good theme, that theme's
method of presentation was dated.
"Man must do penance before
God for his sins," says the God
fearing New Englander. "Never mind
how you get something, if it's right
that you have it, and are happy
with it," says the free and easy
westerner.
The conflict between these ideas
is the theme of "The Great Divide,"
and it would be a good problem play
handled in a modern manner.
But Moody's play is filled with
such unbelievable situations and
stilted lines that today's actor will
find his audience laughing during
the most tense scene, if he makes
the slightest mistake in word-em
phasis or gesture.
Several of the actors in "The Great
Divide" had that trouble but, two
especially, overcame it so well that
the production was worth while for
their performance alone. As Polly
Jordan, Sylvia Oncsti caught and
held her audience from her first
entrance. She delivered her salty
lines with a bite that made each one
tell, and got a hand all for herself
with her exit speech in the second
act.
David Regnery, who played Ste
phen Ghent, got his effects, and got
| them well, by thinking through his
lines so that they became a real
! part of his character, rather than j
the hackneyed phrases of a stock
1 western strong man who "shields a ,
i heart of gold beneath a rough ex- !
i terior."
Unfortunately Betty Howe, as i
I Ruth, was unable to complement i
; Regnery's performance. Perhaps be- j
I cause of lack of experience, she i
| never, at any time, made her part !
real, and too much of the play de
i ponded on her. Thus Regnery's care- i
i fully built up moods were lost many !
j times because of her lapses into j
| melodrama. Clifford Hamar, as I
I Ruth's brother, had the same difTi-
I culty.
Florence Haslett, in her one ap- j
! pearance, played an old lady with a
i sureness of technique and attention !
to detail that left little to be de
sired; but no one could have said, J
"You should have died first," at that j
i point in the play without getting a :
laugh. David Jackman gets a spe- i
cial note for the way he waved a '
' bandanaâ€”an excellent bit of busi- ;
ness. And Aubrey Austin managed
to make himself most enjoyably
loathsome.
As for costuming and staging, they j
j could not have been better. Both |
j were vivid, imaginative, and su- !
j perbly executed.
