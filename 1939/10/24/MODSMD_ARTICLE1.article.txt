### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
DOLF HITLER isn't going to call
another of his "ja" elections, but
he will start sounding out opinion
among the German people to learn
whether or not they would support
a smashing offensive on the western
front.
The fact that the Fuehrer sees the
need of consulting his people, those
who will eventually bear the brunt
of a strong drive, costly in human
lives, indicates that Hitler's posi
tion may not be as secure as it was
six months ago. A seven-weeks
taste of wai'fare. even though that
warfare hasn't been severe, gruel
ing fighting, may have jarred Ger
man confidence in Naziism to some
extent.

These soundings that Hitler'll
make, the French are saying, were
the chief topic of the week-end
gathering in Berlin of Nazi party
district leaders from throughout, the
Reich and their conferences with
Hitler, Field Marshall Hermann
Goering and Deputy Party Leader
Rudolph Hess.

kF COURSE there was no defi
nite confirmation for these
supposedly "semi-official" ac
counts. They represent a surmise
of what was transpiring among the
Nazi hierarchy. At any rate, the
French said they expected Hitler to
make some sort of a decision this
week. Probably he'll wait until
he hears the outcome of the So
viet-Finnish negotiations in Mos
cow. And it would be infinitely
easier for him if he knew how
much he could count on Russian
and Italian support. Actually, lie
may almost disregard Mussolini,
because II Duce has shown tre
mendous reluctance to commit
himself in regard to the axis ar
rangements.
If Hitler decides to open a full
force offensive against the Allies, he
may very likely follow a three-point
program of strategy that would en
tail a virtual blockade of the British
Isles by submarine and air attacks in
an effort to cut off incoming ship
ping.

11 ITLER has had an idea that
Germany's big guns can pound
a breach in the French fortifications,
if only they're given a chance. So
he'd probably unleash a terrific
aerial and artillery bombardment of
the Maginot line.
Then Der Fuehrer would prob
ably apply that well known "moral
pressure" against the neutral Eu
ropean nations in an effort to
make them cease all commerce
and other relations with the Al
lies. This would, of course, be
impossible if Russia and Italy
can't be persuaded to give at least
diplomatic support to Germany.
Another snag may halt the suc
cess of this "moral pressure." The
Allied diplomacy has been extreme
ly active in the Balkans lately. Un
til recently Hitler has been the Bal
kans' best customer. More than half
of Hungary's exports went to Ger
many, while only 10 per cent went
to the Allies.
* * 1,1
Jugoslavia sent half of its sur
plus to Germany and 11 per cent to
France and Britain. Germany's 65
per cent of Bulgaria's exports and
36 per cent of Rumania's; 42 per
cent of Greece's.
But the catch is that most of
Germany's recent purchases have
been by barter—or on the cuff.
And German deliveries of manu
factured goods virtually ceased
when the war broke out. Ger
many now is debtor to those small
states which need cash more than
anything else. Who has the cash?
The Allies, of course.
And, logically, the Allies are doing
their best to divert the Balkan sur
pluses to non-German markets. If
they holds out fat promises of loans
and financial assistance to these
states, Hitler will be about as popu
lar with the Balkans as a jitterbug in
the Mark on a Friday night.
