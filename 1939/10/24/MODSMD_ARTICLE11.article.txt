# HARDY SNAPS 'VOODOO LEER'
## 
### BUD AMES 
First photographs of a complete
Voodoo ceremony, drums, drunks,
and all, were made by a Stanford
man.
| Rex Hardy, Jr., who left the Farm
in 1936, in order to join the photo
graphic staff of the then-adolescent
Life Magazine, bribed a pop-eyed
Haiti priest, and then spent an en
tire evening photographing the
drinking, dancing, sacrificing and
general hysteria of the island's ig
norant and Voodoo loving natives.
"I just slipped the priest five
bucks, which he used to buy a live
chicken for the ceremonial sacri
fice," Hardy explained. "A live sac
rifice is big stuff in Haiti because
all the negroes are so poor. All I
had to do then was start snapping.
I used almost a hundred flash bulbs,
which, incidentally, were tough to
get past the Haiti customs because
they never had seen anything like
them on the island before."
The dancing negroes, swaying to
the drum beats, were at first very
conscious of the popping flash bulbs,
but after a few drinks of a native
beverage, which is raw, first-distilled
sugar cane rum. they soon became
I totally oblivious to the sudden
i flashes of light. High point of the
| evening was the sipping of the chick-
I en's blood by the participating na
tives.
"The drum music was marvelous,"
Hardy went on. "In fact, I was
' pretty lucky to be able to photo
graph the whole business. I had

originally been sent to Haiti by Life
Magazine to get pictures of an un
authenticated border war between
the Negro and Spanish natives who
! live in different republics on the
I island. And when the Haiti gov
j ernment heard I was taking photo
graphs of this Voodoo business I
thought it was about time I left the
island."
When Hardy spoke of marvelous
; drumming, he knew of what he
| was talking. It was he who did the
"Life Goes to a Benny Goodman
I Dance" article about a year ago.
"Life" was his monetary mother
from 1936 until last spring when he
decided that he and New York City
did not agree and that free lancing
was the thing. So Hardy and his
wife, a Stanford graduate, moved
to Palo Altoâ€”for life they hope.
Much like the photographer heroes
in the movies, Hardy has done pho
tographic work for Fortune, Life,
I Collier's, Time, and many other
| magazines, in addition to his por
trait work. He has gone a long
way from the Leica which he used
around the Alpha Delt house in
1936 to his $2500 stock of equipment
today.
