# Farm Faculty Members Join Ham, Eggs Ban
## Professors of Ten Universities Unite In Voicing Disapproval 
### 
Dealing what may prove to be one
of the severest blows yet adminis
tered in the anti-"Ham and Eggs"
campaign, the entire group of econ
omists, totaling 134, on the faculties
of ten leading universities and col
leges in California* including Stan
ford, have unanimously signed a
statement disapproving of the pro
posal to be voted upon November 7.
This action is completely without
precedent, since at no previous time
have all the economists on the regu
lar staffs of these institutions united
in a public expression. The state
ment includes signatures of econ
omists representing all shades of
opinion.
TWENTY-ONE SIGNED
Signatures of 21 members of the
Stanford Department of Economics
and 13 professors of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business are in
cluded on the statement along with
Iho.se of many well known scholars
from the University of California,
the University of California at Los
Angeles, California Institute of
Technology, Mills College, Pomona
College, Redlands University, Uni
versity of Southern California, and
Whittier College.
The statement is as follows:
"The undersigned, while heartily
approving the desire to improve con
ditions of older people and to obtain
security for all, nevertheless disap
prove of the proposed retirement
pension plan (so-called Ham and
Eggs) for the following reasons:
1. The plan will result in a dan
gerous form of inflation.
2. It is unworkable and would
soon collapse, thus failing to help
those whom it is intended to
benefit.
3. The measure would impair the
credit of State, County, and Munici- |
pal governments to the point of
bankruptcy.
4. Powers of a dictatorial nature
would be delegated to the adminis- j
trators of the proposed measure.
For these reasons we believe that I
the project is highly undesirable for j
the people of California."
