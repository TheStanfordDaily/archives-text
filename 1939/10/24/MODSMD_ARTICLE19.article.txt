# Excom Promises Definite Plan Regarding Big Game Dance Question Tonight
## A.S.S.U. Officers Gather Facts For Presentation at Meeting; Koch To Report on Probable Attendance 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Ex Committee will reach its long-awaited decision on the question of a
Big Game dance at its meeting tonight, according to A.S.S.I). President
Ken Cutlibcrtson.
The proposal has heen held out to students as a possibility of having a
(good time Big Game night without paying the increased prices to he

ifound that night in San Francisco
and the various resorts.
All planning on the dance has been
tentative so far, but it has been as
sumed the aflair would be held off
campus, that a "big name" orchestra
would be hired, and that bids would
sell for not more than $5.
OFFICERS GET FACTS
Meanwhile, various student offi
cers have been scurrying around,
gathering pertinent facts for pres
entation at the meeting tonight.
Gordy Nicoll, Cardinals' dance
chairman, reports four major bands
are available for Big Game night
Jimmy Grier, Gus Arnhcim, Count
Basie, and Charlie Barnett.
Hie Millbrae Country Club will
be available for the dance, Nicoll
reports, and the floor there can ac
commodate 700 dancers.
ATTENDANCE REPORT
Ken Koch, president of Cardinals,
is expected to report what will be
the probable attendance if the dance
is held. Some indication of the
probability has been given by
Cardinals' canvass of living groups
and eating clubs.
Since financial considerations will
be in the hands of the A.S.S.U., Stu
dent Manager John Cobbs has been
attempting to gather data on pre
vious dances for presentation at to
night's meeting.
He complains that few comparable
dances have been held at Stanford
and that cost of food and decora
tions is about all he can determine
from these. Attendance at the pro
jected Big Game dance cannot be
judged on the basis of previous
dances, he says.
OFFICIAL APPROVAL
The proposal of a cheap, ofT
campus dance on Big Game night
has received enthusiastic approval
from President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Dean Mary Yost, and Dean John
Bunn, although they have withheld
final approval until formulation of
plans has been completed.
Miss Yost termed the plan "an
excellent idea,'' insisting, however,
that it could be regarded only as a
special concession for Big Game
night.
Dean Bunn said he thought stu
dents would have a better time at
an A.S.S.U. dance than elsewhere
and that persons would attend who
have not been able to afford a game
celebration in previous years.
