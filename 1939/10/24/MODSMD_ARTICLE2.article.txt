# U.S. Freighter Captured By Nazi Cruiser, Sailed By Germans to Kola Bay
## 5000-ton City of Flint Asserted Carrying Contraband; Russians Intern German Crew, Detain Vessel 
### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 23 (UP). —A report from Murmansk released tonight by
the official Soviet news agency said that the American 5,000-ton steamship
City of Flint had hcen captured at sea by a German cruiser and \va>)
brought to Kola liay, north of Murmansk, by a German crew.
The City of Flint is operated by the United States Maritime Commis
sion. She was one of the vessels which took off refugees from the tor-

pedoed liner Athenia. They were<
landed at Halifax.
The Murmansk report distributed
by the Tass agency said a freighter
flying a German flag arrived at Kola
Bay without a Soviet pilot and that
"inspection revealed it to be the
American steamer City of Flint" of
5,000 tons displacement, sailing from
New York to Manchester (England)
and detained by a German cruiser.
A German crew of 18 men brought
the City of Flint to Murmansk, the
repcyt said. It did not reveal whe
ther the American crew was still on
board or had been taken off.
The dispatch said the German crew
regarded the cargo of the American
ship as contraband. It comprised
tractors, grain, fruit, leather and wax,
and totaled 3,700 tons.
Murmansk (Russian) authorities
for the time being detained the ship
and interned the German crew, Tass
reported.
MARITIME COMMISSION
CHECKS ON REPORT
WASHINGTON. Oct. 23 (UP).—
The U.S. Maritime Commission to
night announced receipt of a report
from "authentic sources" that the
5,000-ton American freighter City of
Flint was captured on Saturday by a
German cruiser and taken to Trom
soe, Norway, from whence it was
sailed for an unknown destination.
Commission officials said they were
"checking further" before deciding
on a course of action.
They declined to reveal the source
of their report.
They said the City of Flint was en
route from New York to Liverpool
and Glasgow carrying general cargo
which the commander of the Nazi
cruiser apparently classed as contra
band.
The position of the vessel when
she was intercepted was not known
here. On the basis of the Moscow
report, however, it was judged she
was pursuing a course well north
in the North Atlantic off the regular
shipping lanes.
A Commission spokesman said the
City of Flint normally carries a crew
of 38 and it is assumed that number
were aboard.
The skipper is Capt. J. A. Gainer,
who won renown at the outbreak of
the current war when he directed
the rescue of 219 survivors of the
British liner Athenia which was
sunk off the Hebrides Islands.

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 23 (UP).— '
Germany was within her rights un
der international law in seizing the
American steamer City of Flint if
the ship carried contraband, as stated
by the Maritime Commission in
Washington, Dr. Edward S. Corwin,
McCormick professor of jurispru
dence at Princeton University, said
tonight.
The international law expert
thought that one of the most inter
esting developments as a result of
the seizure and the taking of the
ship into a Russian port will be to
clarify Russia's real relations with
Germany.
"The point at issue," he said, "is
the taking of the boat into the sup
posedly neutral Soviet port of Mur
mansk. This is an issue to be settled
among the United States, Russia and |
Germany."

MOSCOW, Oct. 23 (UP). —A report from Murmansk released tonight by
the official Soviet news agency said that the American 5,000-ton steamship
City of Flint had hcen captured at sea by a German cruiser and \va>)
brought to Kola liay, north of Murmansk, by a German crew.
The City of Flint is operated by the United States Maritime Commis
sion. She was one of the vessels which took off refugees from the tor-

pedoed liner Athenia. They were<
landed at Halifax.
The Murmansk report distributed
by the Tass agency said a freighter
flying a German flag arrived at Kola
Bay without a Soviet pilot and that
"inspection revealed it to be the
American steamer City of Flint" of
5,000 tons displacement, sailing from
New York to Manchester (England)
and detained by a German cruiser.
A German crew of 18 men brought
the City of Flint to Murmansk, the
repcyt said. It did not reveal whe
ther the American crew was still on
board or had been taken off.
The dispatch said the German crew
regarded the cargo of the American
ship as contraband. It comprised
tractors, grain, fruit, leather and wax,
and totaled 3,700 tons.
Murmansk (Russian) authorities
for the time being detained the ship
and interned the German crew, Tass
reported.
MARITIME COMMISSION
CHECKS ON REPORT
WASHINGTON. Oct. 23 (UP).—
The U.S. Maritime Commission to
night announced receipt of a report
from "authentic sources" that the
5,000-ton American freighter City of
Flint was captured on Saturday by a
German cruiser and taken to Trom
soe, Norway, from whence it was
sailed for an unknown destination.
Commission officials said they were
"checking further" before deciding
on a course of action.
They declined to reveal the source
of their report.
They said the City of Flint was en
route from New York to Liverpool
and Glasgow carrying general cargo
which the commander of the Nazi
cruiser apparently classed as contra
band.
The position of the vessel when
she was intercepted was not known
here. On the basis of the Moscow
report, however, it was judged she
was pursuing a course well north
in the North Atlantic off the regular
shipping lanes.
A Commission spokesman said the
City of Flint normally carries a crew
of 38 and it is assumed that number
were aboard.
The skipper is Capt. J. A. Gainer,
who won renown at the outbreak of
the current war when he directed
the rescue of 219 survivors of the
British liner Athenia which was
sunk off the Hebrides Islands.
'GERMANY IS WITHIN

PRINCETON, N.J., Oct. 23 (UP).— '
Germany was within her rights un
der international law in seizing the
American steamer City of Flint if
the ship carried contraband, as stated
by the Maritime Commission in
Washington, Dr. Edward S. Corwin,
McCormick professor of jurispru
dence at Princeton University, said
tonight.
The international law expert
thought that one of the most inter
esting developments as a result of
the seizure and the taking of the
ship into a Russian port will be to
clarify Russia's real relations with
Germany.
"The point at issue," he said, "is
the taking of the boat into the sup
posedly neutral Soviet port of Mur
mansk. This is an issue to be settled
among the United States, Russia and |
Germany."
