# Zane Grey Dies At Sixty-four
## Author Succumbs To Heart Ailment 
### 
PASADENA. Oct. 23 (UP),â€”Zane
Grey, famous author whose western
thrillers amused millions of persons
in books, magazines and the movies,
died at his suburban Altadena home
today of a heart attack. He was 64.
Grey started out to be a dentist,
but was more adept at teliing stories
to his patients than pulling teeth.
That started his writing career.
For 35 years he blended the color
and drama of desert and range life
in Arizona, California and Neveda
into 40-odd books, all successes on
the literary market. Cowboys were
his favorite subjects.
Doctors said Grey had been suf
fering from coronary thrombosis, a
heart ailment, and succumbed to a
sudden attack at breakfast this
morning. His wife, the former Lina
Elise Roth, whom he married in
New York in 1905, was at his side,
but he never regained conscious
ness.
His two sons, Romer and Loren,
and a daughter, Betty, were sum
moned for funeral services, which
will be held privately Wednesday
afternoon.
The noted writer was almost
equally famed for his ability as a
huntsman and fisherman.
Grey had spent the last few days
autographing his latest edition, a
book called "Western Union," a his
tory of the telegraph company. It
was one of a series of historical
works he brought out every year
or two, interspersing them with his
novels. Since Gray started writing
in 1904 more than 17,000.000 copies
of his books have sold throughout
the world.
The movies picked up the most
thrilling works and dramatized them
in films.
