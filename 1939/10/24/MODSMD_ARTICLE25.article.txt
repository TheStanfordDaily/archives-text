# Beard Reveals Typhoid Facts
## Stanford Professor Shows Germ Habits 
### 
Typhoid germs may live as long
as two years without food, Dr. Paul
J. Beard, associate professor of
Sanitary Science at Stanford told
the American Public Health Asso
ciation at a recent meeting in Pitts
burgh.
Dr. Beard exposed typhoid germs
to various weather conditions and
to incubation and refrigeration to
test their resistance. They were
shown to be extremely vigorous in
resisting extreme heat, cold, and
water conditions.
Fifty per cent of them usually died
within two days, Dr. Beard ex
plained. but the rest clung to life for
as long as two years and were still
capable of infecting human beings
with typhoid fever.
For this reason the disease is still
a constant menace in this country,
he concluded, since studies show that
infestation of the soil on slopes from
which water runs down into reser
voirs for water supplies forms a real
hazard, and may cause typhoid epi
demics months or years later.
Rainy weather is particularly
conducive to the survival of the re
sistant bugs, Dr. Beard discovered,
and although thoy are quickly killed
by sunlight, this is true only on the
surface of the ground.
President Roosevelt, a Harvard
graduate, once called the Jay hawk
yell the greatest college yell ever
devised.
