## Tiny Stresses Pass Defense As Game Nears 
### 
There'll be a lot of razzle-dazzle
lo itball in the state of Washington
Saturday when the Indian grid ma
chine takes on Jimmy Phelan's Hus
kies.
Tiny Thornhill ran hi.s first three
strings through dummy scrimmage
in practice yesterday, and had the
boys running through some new
plays that might have been taken
from the repertoire of some of the
flashier professional teams.
The handwriting was on the wall
in the U.C.L.A. game when the Cards
worked a couple of laterals for good
gains.

Phelun, with a club that has lost
iour games and has displayed little
in the way of a power attack, will
reach down into his own bag of
tricks to try and find something that
can put his team back into the coast
picture.
Thornhill wound up practice under
the lights last night with the first of
three scrub sessions that are slated
lor the Cards before they leave for
Seattle Thursday.
Thor Peterson, high-stepping sec
ond-string fullback who injured his
back in practice last Friday, is not
expected to be in shape to make the
trip. Stan Andersen, mainstay of the
line at left tackle, missed practice
yesterday also. Big Andy is in the
rest home with a bad cold.
LINEUP GIVEN
Swede Johansen worked in An
dersen's place on the first string in
the defensive scrimmage against the
third team. With Johansen in the
lirst string line were Stojkovich and
Graf! at ends, Donahue at tackle,
Kerman and Orme it guards, and
Verdiek at center.
Gene Coldiron still has the first
string quarter spot, although Hamp
Pool ; s rapidly getting back into the
.swing of backfield work. The rest of
the first string quartet remained un
changed iron l : week, with Norm
Standlec at lull and Frankie Albert
and Jim Groves at halves.
PASS DEFENSE
Present plans will see the Indians
scrimmaging both tonight and to
morrow night. Thornhill intends to
.spend a lot of time on pass defense
in anticipation of an aerial battle at
Seattle.
The Huskies will be playing to a
homecoming crowd on their own
field Saturday, and Phelan is sure to
shoot the works in an effort to quiet
the wolves that have been on his
trail since (he season opened.

scrimmaging both tonight and to
morrow night. Thornhill intends to
.spend a lot of time on pass defense
in anticipation of an aerial battle at
Seattle.
The Huskies will be playing to a
homecoming crowd on their own
field Saturday, and Phelan is sure to
shoot the works in an effort to quiet
the wolves that have been on his
trail since (he season opened.
There'll be a lot of razzle-dazzle
lo itball in the state of Washington
Saturday when the Indian grid ma
chine takes on Jimmy Phelan's Hus
kies.
Tiny Thornhill ran hi.s first three
strings through dummy scrimmage
in practice yesterday, and had the
boys running through some new
plays that might have been taken
from the repertoire of some of the
flashier professional teams.
The handwriting was on the wall
in the U.C.L.A. game when the Cards
worked a couple of laterals for good
gains.

Phelun, with a club that has lost
iour games and has displayed little
in the way of a power attack, will
reach down into his own bag of
tricks to try and find something that
can put his team back into the coast
picture.
Thornhill wound up practice under
the lights last night with the first of
three scrub sessions that are slated
lor the Cards before they leave for
Seattle Thursday.
Thor Peterson, high-stepping sec
ond-string fullback who injured his
back in practice last Friday, is not
expected to be in shape to make the
trip. Stan Andersen, mainstay of the
line at left tackle, missed practice
yesterday also. Big Andy is in the
rest home with a bad cold.
LINEUP GIVEN
Swede Johansen worked in An
dersen's place on the first string in
the defensive scrimmage against the
third team. With Johansen in the
lirst string line were Stojkovich and
Graf! at ends, Donahue at tackle,
Kerman and Orme it guards, and
Verdiek at center.
Gene Coldiron still has the first
string quarter spot, although Hamp
Pool ; s rapidly getting back into the
.swing of backfield work. The rest of
the first string quartet remained un
changed iron l : week, with Norm
Standlec at lull and Frankie Albert
and Jim Groves at halves.
