i WHAT IS WHAT DOWN
I SAN JOSE STATE WAV
It goes under the realm of pure
J speculation, but a picture published
| in one of the San Francisco dailies
i in conjunction with the San Jose
| State-College of Pacific game last
■ week-end has caused considerable
i eyebrow-raising.
The picture in question was a shot
; of the San Jose State bench during
| a tense moment in the game, which
j the Spartans won by a 13-3 score.
I The occupants of the illustration
I W ere "Pop" Warner, who holds the
j position of so-called "advisory of
i fensive coach" for San Jose, Head
| Coach Dud DeGroot, and Ben Win
| kelman, Stanford line mentor who is
' now on a leave of absence.
Just what is Winkelman's offi
cial status at San Jose is not
known by Slants, but the mere fact
that he was sitting 011 the San
i Jose liench during one of its cru
cial games can be considered fair
: ly significant.
Is Warner moving in on DeGroot?
|is what the eyebrow-raisers are
I wondering.
Officially DeGroot, former Stan
' ford athlete, is the head coach down
j there, with Warner merely serving
jas an adviser on offensive tactics.
But for all practical purposes you
would never know that DeGroot ex
isted. In all the write-ups of the
San Jose-Pacific gamy. Warner's
j name was mentioned with promi
! nence to the absolute exclusion of
j DeGroot.

It lias been that way all season.
Unless one happens to know the
official set-up, he would think
that Warner is the big man down
San Jose way from the write-ups
in the papers. In fact, you might
never have heard of Dud DeGroot
if your entire information came
from the city papers or the na
tional press services.
Now Warner's man Friday —
Winkelman—is pictured sitting on
the Spartan bench during one of
San Jose's biggest games of the
season. It begins to look as if per
haps DeGroot is slowly being
edged out there.
It. might be a good idea for San
Jose to remember that they were
doing all right under DeGroot long
before Warner appeared on the
scene. It was DeGroot who single
handedly brought the Spartans up
from a fifth-rate gridiron power to
the top of the heap.
DeGroot did the work, Warner is
merely furnishing the trimmings.
