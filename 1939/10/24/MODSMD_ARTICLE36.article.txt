### 
Coach Ifarry Shipkey sent his freshman gridders through an intensive
scrimmage yesterday and plans the same program for today's practice.
Big Milt Yucinich hit the comeback trail yesterday and Hashed some <>f his
< Id form as ihe yearlings propped for the U.C.L.A. freshmen who will in
vade the Farm next Saturday.
The Ucla team was leading California's powerful frosh out (it 14-13 at
half time in last-week's game between the two teams, hut collapsed in the

second half to be overwhelmed 41-14
! PASS ATTACK STRONG
With the puss attack well under
control as exhibited by the Cards' j
|39 - 0 victory over Fullerton last
week-end, Shipkey is now concen
| trating on the running plays. His
| strategy is to choose 8 or 10 decep-
I live plays and spend this week in
; drilling two teams on these plays.
I Hence the intensive scrimmages.
' To get back to Vucinich, the big
] fullback, hampered by a badly
I bruised shoulder, has failed to live
J up to his early-season performance
! in the last few games, but now he
j seems back in shape and ready to
j boom.
j GREENING TO SEE ACTION
Bob Greening, due to his antics in
j the Fullerton game, is being drilled
j at left halfback and will probably
j see lots of action, filling in for either
j A1 Cole or Vucinich.
Shipkey stated that last Saturday's
game in which the whole, squad of
41 players performed â€¢ was more or
'less of a testing ground from which
to choose a first and second string on
which to concentrate for the coming
Ucla game and the ever-important '
Cal tussle.
Bill Hanlon at quarterback, Peter
Gadd at end, Bud Sherman at left
half, all took advantage of the op
portunity to perform and flashed lots
of possibilities.
The question of Hank Norberg is
still undecided. It it. certain that he
will be set for the Cal game but
j whether or not he will get a crack at
those Bruins remains doubtful.
