FIFTY years ago, when Stanford was a tuition
free school isolated in the middle of a wheat
field, it was a thoroughly democratic institu
tion. Since that time the introduction of the
$115 per quarter and the horseless carriage has
deprived the Farm of all but the spiritual as
pects of democracy.
In fact, some people refer to Stanford as a
school for rich men's sons.
The important element in this situation is not
the size of the average Stanford father's income,
but the fact that in some instances, at least, the
flashy cars and the well-tailored sport coats
have penetrated more than skin deep.
In a student body that once found its fun
at campus functions, there now are hundreds
who sneer at barbecues and jolly-ups. There
actually are women students here who will not
accept week-end dates unless they are sure that
they will be taken to the City.
The idea that it is impossible to have a good
time without spending a great deal of money
seems to have taken firm root at Stanford.
Tonight we are going to see whether Ex
Committee can disprove it.
The A.S.S.U. will sponsor an off - campus
dance after the Big Game—provided that the
student representatives are convinced that it
will be a success. The fear of financial loss is
all that stands in the way of unanimous Ex Com
mittee vote of approval.
Cardinals' canvass of campus opinion two
weeks ago proved that potential patronage for
the affair exists. And the student body certainly
can produce chairmen and committee men
capable of selling the dance. Admitting that it
will not be a financial success means admitting
that Stanford lacks enthusiasm and ability.
If they are going to represent their con
stituents fairly tonight, the members of Ex
Committee will vote in favor of the Big Game
dance. If they vote against it, one of these state
ments must be true:
Stanford students haven't brains enough to
put on a successful dance.
Democratic student government does not
work at Stanford.
Or Stanford students are a bunch of snobs.
