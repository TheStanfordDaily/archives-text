UNIVERSITIES, to the average adult outside
of universities, connote a vague sort of
relationship between traditionally irresponsible
students and bearded sages, housed in unusu
ally large buildings. Universities mean football,
or a place to send Junior his allowance.
They do not often appear to the man on the
street as having any particular value for him.
He respects their opinions, probably because he
doesn't understand them; he notes now and
again that white-coated laboratory workers de
velop a new serum, get their pictures in Time,
and save a lot of lives.
But he doesn't see that universities are a prac
tical consideration for him.
The action last week of ten California univer
sities in banding together and presenting a
united front to the voters of California in oppo
sition to "Ham and Eggs" is a step in the esti
mable direction of making the public "univer
sity conscious."
One hundred and thirty-four experts in eco
nomics, representing the ten colleges, signed
the denunciation—-34 of them are from Stanford.
Concerted action from such a huge group will
not be overlooked, even by the man in the
street, the man who will be voting "yes" on
Nov. 7. "Ham and Eggs" is very much in the
public mind; published opinion of 134 econo
mists working as a body will at least show the
people of the state that its colleges are on their
toes. The public will benefit, even if the action
does not defeat California's latest gilt-edged
brainstorm.
The opinion of a university professor is apt
to be more logical, more nearly correct, than
the opinion of almost anyone else. Yet that
expert opinion is seldom given much publicity.
A university is fine for its students; but aside
from the men and women it builds, what good
is it to the outside world? Administrations are
fabulously slow in stating their stands, espe
cially on controversial matters — something
about "public relations," or "let's avoid pub
licity on this."
That attitude is wrong. The best thing that

universities can do is to tell laymen what ex
perts think—to recommend to citizens that they
believe the same thing.
Stanford has lots of experts —maybe Cal has
a few—these are not the times to muffle them.

and save a lot of lives.
But he doesn't see that universities are a prac
tical consideration for him.
The action last week of ten California univer
sities in banding together and presenting a
united front to the voters of California in oppo
sition to "Ham and Eggs" is a step in the esti
mable direction of making the public "univer
sity conscious."
One hundred and thirty-four experts in eco
nomics, representing the ten colleges, signed
the denunciation—-34 of them are from Stanford.
Concerted action from such a huge group will
not be overlooked, even by the man in the
street, the man who will be voting "yes" on
Nov. 7. "Ham and Eggs" is very much in the
public mind; published opinion of 134 econo
mists working as a body will at least show the
people of the state that its colleges are on their
toes. The public will benefit, even if the action
does not defeat California's latest gilt-edged
brainstorm.
The opinion of a university professor is apt
to be more logical, more nearly correct, than
the opinion of almost anyone else. Yet that
expert opinion is seldom given much publicity.
A university is fine for its students; but aside
from the men and women it builds, what good
is it to the outside world? Administrations are
fabulously slow in stating their stands, espe
cially on controversial matters — something
about "public relations," or "let's avoid pub
licity on this."
That attitude is wrong. The best thing that

universities can do is to tell laymen what ex
perts think—to recommend to citizens that they
believe the same thing.
Stanford has lots of experts —maybe Cal has
a few—these are not the times to muffle them.

UNIVERSITIES, to the average adult outside
of universities, connote a vague sort of
relationship between traditionally irresponsible
students and bearded sages, housed in unusu
ally large buildings. Universities mean football,
or a place to send Junior his allowance.
They do not often appear to the man on the
street as having any particular value for him.
He respects their opinions, probably because he
doesn't understand them; he notes now and
again that white-coated laboratory workers de
velop a new serum, get their pictures in Time,
and save a lot of lives.
But he doesn't see that universities are a prac
tical consideration for him.
