THOU SHALT NOT KILL
/ 'OMMON usage has made the word "idiot" synony
raous with "fool." Anyone capable of generating
intellectual disgust we call an idiot. We have become
verbally dulled to the word's real meaning, until very
few of us are vividly aware that the United States
spends thousands of dollars every year to support
grown men and women with the mental ability of one,
two, and three-year-old children.
Across the Golden Gate bridge, not far from So
noma, there is a state home for the feeble-minded
where forty-two genuine idiots are housed, fed and
dressed like infants, cured of disease, and sometimes
diapered. Not one of them is as able to take care of
himself as a field mouse. Chimpanzees far outstrip
them in ability to learn, and low-grade white rats have
much better memories than most of them.
Joe, one of Sonoma's idiots, is a man of 41 with
an estimated Intelligence Quotient of four. If the psy
chiatrist holds a loliypop in front of him he will look
at it absently, babble and gurgle like an infant, and
grin with an ape-like expression. If the loliypop is
put in his mouth, his primitive reflexes will help him
out: he will slobber over it and suck. If the doctor
puts the loliypop in his hand he will not have suffi
cient mentality to raise the candy to his mouth, despite
the fact that he has been eating food for 41 years.

COME of the idiots are special freaks: with heads as
large as three pumpkins or as small as three base
balls, or with tumorous lumps of flesh all over their
bodies. Many of them are physically misshapen and
paralytic. Some of them have webbed fingers or
twitching eyes or tremors in arms and legs. Their clay
has been hopelessly distorted by nature. They are
ugly, abortive creations that are total and permanent
losses to themselves and to society.
And yet we keep them alive. We give them medical
care that many normal people do not get. We nurture
these twisted weeds as hot-house flowers, and we out
law what would be their merciful deaths.
Medieval ignorance and prejudice is so deeply rooted
in an age of airplanes that our society maladaptively
protects its idiots. One begins to wonder how smart
the rest of us are. Our conceptions of the sanctity of
human life can certainly assume wry proportions! We
kill intelligent people because they were angry enough
to murder. We leave whole sections of our country
without minimum requirements of medicine and sani
tation. But idiots we refuse to kill. Idiots we feed
and medicate. Idiots the state supports.
We don't think about, but just memorize the
phrase: "Thou shalt not kill!"
