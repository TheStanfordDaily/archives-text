## PRACTICAL GUIDE TO PEACE 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
The recommendation made the other night by
Benjamin Marsh of the people's lobby, that before this
country should go into any war there should be three
basic changes made in home conditions, was extremely
sensible, even if a bit facetious.
Mr. Marsh said that we should place our big indus
tries, our public utilities, and our banks in the hands
of the government. This would break the power of
the money barons to make war.
Second, we should furnish gainful employment to
all our employables. This would stop the rush into
the army and navy of men in desperate need of the
means of subsistence.
Third, we should give to the people a vote on war,
except in case of invasion. This would give absolute
assurance of keeping out of war, since the mass of
the people of this country—of any country—never do
want war, and the danger of our being invaded is less
than nothing.
I would add one more suggestion: that the age of
service should be advanced to 35 to 50 or to (30. This
would put the matter up to men of mature age—the
men who fall for war—and leave the young men a
chance to grow up and enjoy something of life.
Do you recall this story? Many years ago when
war threatened between Norway and Sweden, the army
officers were warned by letter that if there were war
they would be shot? And there was no war.
Let us handle our Congressmen the same way. Tell
them if there's a war they will not be re-elected! This
will be quite enough to put them on the peace side.
No need to shoot them!
M. S. A.
