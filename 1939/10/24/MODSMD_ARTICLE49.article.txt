# THE 						MOSCOW LETTER

### 
HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
Congratulations on your editorial of Thursday,
Oct. 19, regarding that fool A.S.U. idea. What America
needs today, Mr. Editor, is more men like yourself,
who can stop and think before acting, instead of being
carried away by "youthful enthusiasm." You certainly
told those young whippersnappers, Mr. Editor. That's
the trouble with our colleges today. Why, we send
our boys down there, and they get all sorts of darn
fool ideas. What we need is more Americanism, and
less of these foreign "isms."
Of course, you and I know, Mr. Editor, that if it
came to a real showdown we'd take Fascism to Com
munism because, after all, private property is the
foundation of civilization, but that really doesn't mat
ter. does it? Give 'em plenty of good old American
tradition, and we'll beat all the rest of them.
Our sacred liberties, free speech, free press, free re
ligion, that's what we want; and if any of those dirty
communists come butting into our free speech, why,
kill 'em first, I say. Isn't that right, Mr. Editor? Of
course, you and I know that all this red stuff is just,
well, "youthful enthusiasm." These kids'll all come
around as soon as they find which side their bread is
buttered on. Eh, Mr. Editor?

jk ND your Dr. Robinson. What a fine man. Exempli
fies everything best in the American tradition, I
tell you. He knows we can't let these fool Communists
go around shooting off their mouths. Why, it isn't
safe for our sacred liberties, or our investments, or our
chlidren. Yes, sir. when I invest a lot of money in
my boy for a college education, I want him and my
investment to be safe. I'd put him in Dr. Robinson's
hands, where he'd learn just what was good for him,
and nothing more. I'd even hope he'd meet a fine
fellow like yourself, with such keen psychological in
sighf into young people.
You're what we need, Mr. Editor, more men who
can sit around and say "ah, youthful enthusiasm!"
Your Stanford must be a fine place, all right, with your
self and Dr. Robinson and Mr. Hoover all there at
once to help us poor investment bankers and Associated
Farmers. We look to Stanford, you know, as one pro
tection and safeguard of our sacred liberties.
Yours for Hoover in '40,
J. J. Jay
