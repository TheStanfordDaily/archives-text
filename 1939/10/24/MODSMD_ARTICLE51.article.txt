# Honeymoon in Bali' Proves Gay Contrast to Newsreels
## 
### 
"HONEYMOON IN BALI," currently unreeling at (lie Stanford.
Even if .you wake up with a nasty shock when the newsreel comes on
to show the grim picture of what goes on in Europe, it's nice to think for
a while that after al! what's really important in life arc things like wise
cracking and helping Cupid pair up the right people.

With "Honeymoon in Bali," cru
saders Fred Mac Murray and Made
leine Carroll are still winning con
verts to the higher life; and thoy
would have, even if producer* had
n't changed the original name from
"My Love lor Yours."
In spite of Noel, from Bali, who
has stopped trying to commit suicide
because she loves Bill, Madeleine's
deception that she prefers her inde
pendent life as a Fifth Avenue de
partment store executive, to any
other, she lands where the audience
and the leading man would like to
have her.
Four-year-old Carolyn Lee, who
plays Rosie, is almost as great as
the movie magazines claim, but for
different reasons. She's good because
she acts like a charming four-year
old, and not like Shirley Temple or a
child wonder. Or maybe she's a
wonder because Edward H. Griffith
is a first rate director?
Katharine Brush wrote the part
of a window-washer into the story,
and Akim TamirofT did as much
with it for the show, as he did for
Madeleine Carroll when he told her
that what she needed for a husband
was a "guy" — somebody just that
much better than a gentleman.
And best about the picture—if you
breathe deeply while watching the
Bali beach scenes, you're a cinch to
last till Thanksgiving vacation, —
