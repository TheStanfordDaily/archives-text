# Durand to Talk At Convention
## Engineers to Meet At Cornell Conclave 
### 
Dr. W. F. Durand of Stanford
University has been chosen to rep
resent the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers and the
American Philosophical Society at
Cornell, according to information
received here. â€¢
His appearance as speaker on the
program, to be held Wednesday
afternoon, will be Dr. Durand's part
in the celebration marking the 100 th
anniversary of the birth of Robert
Henry Thurston, famous mechanical
engineer.
The presence of the Stanford pro
fessor emeritus is particularly not
able, as he was professor of Marine
Engineering at Cornell from 1891 to
1904, and Thurston's biographer.
Other notable speakers will be
Dr. James P. Adams, vice-president
of Brown University, Admiral Wil
son Brown, superintendent of the
U. S. Naval Academy, and Dr. Har
vey N. Davis, president of Stevens
Institute of Technology.
