### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
Germany and the United
States were playing a game of
international "button, button, who's
got the button" last night with a
4900-ton steamer and a crew of 41
starred as the button.
When news that the City of Flint,
American ship, and her crew, had
been captured by a sea-raiding Ger
man warship in the Atlantic and tak
en to a Russian port in the Arctic-
Sea reached Washington, President
Roosevelt and Cordell Hull began to
make the European cable hum.
Roosevelt indicated that his
primary concern in the whole mat
ter is to determine the where
abouts and safety of the 11 officers
and men. Last night they were
still missing.
Russia had the ship, according to
a Tass report that was released early
yesterday, but the crew was no
where to be found. And Germany
said, "We don't know a thing about
it."
Dispatches from Norway indicat
ed it was the German pocket bat
tleship Deutschland and the German
cruiser Emden that seized the City
of Flint, as a carrier of contraband.
The United States took the attitude
that, although the vessel might have
been carrying contraband to British
ports, Germany had no right under
international law to send the ship
into a neutral port.
* * *
this is a slight and
k very shaky peg upon which
to hang strong notes to Hitler.
Under all the abstract rules of in
ternational law, the Germans were
justified in capturing the vessel.
Logically, the United States has
n't a leg to stand 011.
The incident provokes a much
larger consideration of just what
things are, actually, articles of war.
The City of Flint, which sailed from
New York Oct. 3 for Manchester,
had a cargo of tractors, grain, fruit,
cereals, plows, and wax. None of
these are, in the strictest sense, mu
nitions or articles of war. On the
other hand, to a nation openly at
war, they can very reasonably be
considered facilities in maintaining
lighting forces.
American authorities are broad
minded enough to admit that the
City of Flint carried merchandise
listed as contraband—by the Ger
mans. But they had an ace in the
hole. They were counting on Rus
sia, as a neutral, to return the vessel
to the United States Maritime Com
mission, which had chartered it to
the U. S. Lines.

£N LONDON, sources close to the
British Admiralty said it was dif
ficult to see how the Germans could
be accused of violating international
ethics inasmuch as the ship appeai*ed
to be carrying contraband destined
for Great Britain.
Roosevelt grabbed the opportu
nity to put in a plug for the cur
rent Neutrality Revision Act, Ad
ministration - sponsored. He said
that, if Congress authorizes the al
terations, the act will bar Ameri
can merchant vessels from travel
ing in European war areas and will
prevent a repetition of the inci
dent. He said, though, somewhat
vaguely, that, as far as he knew,
110 existing American statutes gave
him power to prohibit such voy
ages.
Senator Robert Taft, though, in
sisted that the Maritime Commission
should never have permitted the
boat to sail for England.

The question of force arose to
plague international lawyers, because
the Nazi naval raider installed a
prize crew and hoisted the German
flag over the ship. It was unusual,
too, for a belligerent to take a prize
to a neutral port.
At any rate, the concensus seems
to hold that German action was ab
solutely justified if the vessel car
ried more than 51 per cent of abso
lute contraband.
But the United "States was still
trying to track down the missing
crew of 41. Apparently they're still
floating around Europe somewhere.
