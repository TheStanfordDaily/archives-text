# Railroad Underpass to Create Another 'Vanishing American'
## 
### 
Charles Beheyt—you probably haven't heard the name but you all have
met him sometime, rather informally—Charles Beheyt is the thin, mus
tached man who runs the safety gates at the Southern Pacific University
Avenue railroad crossing.
And Charles is a vanishing American. As soon as the proposed undcr-

,pass is constructed at his crossing
•there will no longer be any need
for safety gates, which means that
he won't have any to tend.
Beheyt is 43, wears a slouch hat
when he works, and smokes a pack
of cigarettes a day "when theie isn't
much to do. I work in this five-by
five foot booth from 3 o'clock in the
the afternoon until 11 o'clock at
night, seven days a week," he ex
plained. "And I'm not allowed to
read while on duty. Yes sir, I'm on
my toes all the time," he laughed.
As for his love for the railroading
business, well, Charlie likes the busi
ness all right, but he likes fishing
better. But railroading is a lot bet
ter than being in the army.
"I went ovei'seas with the 27th
Division in the Motor Transport
Corps when I was about 20 years old.
I drove all over France but I never
got to the front. After the war I
just fell naturally into the marine
corps, and stayed there for 12 years.
Trouble is, I was a sergeant, and
I'm subject, to service at the first,
national emergency."
