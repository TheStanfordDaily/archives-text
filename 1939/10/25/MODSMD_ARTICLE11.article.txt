# Railroad Underpass to Create Another 'Vanishing American'
## 
### 
Charles Beheyt—you probably haven't heard the name but you all have
met him sometime, rather informally—Charles Beheyt is the thin, mus
tached man who runs the safety gates at the Southern Pacific University
Avenue railroad crossing.
And Charles is a vanishing American. As soon as the proposed undcr-

,pass is constructed at his crossing
•there will no longer be any need
for safety gates, which means that
he won't have any to tend.
Beheyt is 43, wears a slouch hat
when he works, and smokes a pack
of cigarettes a day "when theie isn't
much to do. I work in this five-by
five foot booth from 3 o'clock in the
the afternoon until 11 o'clock at
night, seven days a week," he ex
plained. "And I'm not allowed to
read while on duty. Yes sir, I'm on
my toes all the time," he laughed.
As for his love for the railroading
business, well, Charlie likes the busi
ness all right, but he likes fishing
better. But railroading is a lot bet
ter than being in the army.
"I went ovei'seas with the 27th
Division in the Motor Transport
Corps when I was about 20 years old.
I drove all over France but I never
got to the front. After the war I
just fell naturally into the marine
corps, and stayed there for 12 years.
Trouble is, I was a sergeant, and
I'm subject, to service at the first,
national emergency."
llad lie clone any other sort of
work? Well, yes, he had driven a
Fifth Avenue bus in New York City
for about three years light after the
war. He then got "itchy feet" so he
got back into the marine . Charlie
was one of those men who hauled
in the Macon dirigible the day it
had risen suddenly and dropped a
man (iOO feet off of its ground lines.
Charlie lit another cigarette and
peered, half with longing and half
with drudgery, down the tracks.
"Here conies anothei one," he stated
dryly, and then moved leisurely to
his little gadgets which lowered I he'
gate. The train passed and Charlie
began tei describe the uad.'ots in his
domain.
"These two handles open the
valves on the compressed air tank,"
he explained. "Then when 1 pump
this handle I build up pressure and
the gates go down then up when
I pump again. And these are the
"enunciator.-." When a train comes
down the track, these
ring a bell and then flash on a red
light to let me> know the train is
coming. But 1 always know when
a train is coming. I've' been doing
this for three years."
The mention of years started
Charlie off on his reminiscing again.

He mentioned his wife, and spoke
tor five minutes on his 40 canaries
his hobby. He is a ureal philoso
pher.
"Well, here comes another," ht
broke in. He pumped but the gates
wouldn't go down, "Boy, you've jus
seen something. I've been hen
three years and this is the first time
the gate hasn't gone down. The
wind is so strong out there, the com
pressed air won't pull it down. Well
I'll be doggoned."
