## Busses to Transport Skaters; Wilson's To Serve Rink Meal 
### 
"Roll with the Class of '40."
Not an invitation to academic
disaster, but an invitation extended
to all seniors from class president
Bob Livingston to attend the senior
skating party scheduled Saturday,
Oct. 28, at a peninsula skating rink.
Planned by the same class that
inaugurated beach picnics for class
parties, the skating party from all
advance indications promises to be
one of the best of the year, Living
ston said.
BUSSES LEAVE AT 3
Co-chairmen of the affair are Bob
bie Rankin, Theta, and Bill Jess,
Delt.
The afternoon will begin when
busses leave from the Education
Library parking lot at 3 o'clock. Sen
iors will be taken to the skating
rink which will be reserved for their
exclusive use from their arrival un
til 5:30 o'clock.
"We are planning to accommodate
as many seniors in the busses as
possible," Livingston said. "It will be
lots more fun that way."
WILSON'S SERVE MEAL
Dinner will be served the seniors
at the skating rink at 6 o'clock.
Wilson's of Palo Alto will provide
the meal.
During the afternoon, score by
quarters of the Stanford-University
of Washington game will be an
nounced. In this way grid-minded
seniors will be kept in touch with
the game.
Busses will return to the campus
from the rink by 7 or 7:30 o'clock.
"111 time for Saturday night dates,"
Livingston said.
Entire cost of the afternoon will be
50 cents per person. A sum equal to
the entire amount taken in will be
taken from the class treasury to de
