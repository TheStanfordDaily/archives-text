# Mystery Surrounds Nazi Capture of U.S. Vessel Reported in Russian Port
## Von Ribbentrop Bids for American Friendship, Charges British With Secret Plotting in Danzig Speech 
### United Press 
The United States' relations with Germany were pushed to the fore
front of the European war Tuesday night by the mystery of the Nazi cap
lure of the American freighter City of Flint and an open hid for American
friendship by Germany's foreign minister.
Details of the capture of the 4,963-ton American vessel by a Nazi sea-

raider in the Atlantic were
by a maze of conflicting reports. The
vessel was known to have been taken
to a Soviet Russian port on Kola
Bay in the arctic, with the Nazi
swastika flying from her mast, but
the whereabouts of Capt. Joseph L.
Gainard and the 40 members of his
crew remained a mystery.
The Soviet government, indicating
the City of Flint would be released
shortly, promised the United States
government its fullest co-operation.
Germany said she knew nothing
about the vessel.
NAZIS ASK U.S. FRIENDSHIP
The bid for American friendship
was made by German Foreign Min
ister Joachim von Ribbentrop in a
speech at Danzig during which he
accused Great Britain of secretly
plotting Europe's new war for years
and dragging the French into it.
against their will. He went out of
his way to assert that war between
the United States was "impossible"
and that only a "sick mind" could
see any reason for dissension be
tween America and Germany.
The Germans are anxious for de
feat of President. Roosevelt's pro
posal to modify the law and permit
cash-and-carry arms shipments to
Europe's warring powers. Such a
modification, the Germans say, would
benefit the Allies.
Meanwhile President Roosevelt,
was telling newspapermen in Wash
ington that his neutrality law revi
sion program would prevent repe
tition of another City of Flint inci
dent because American merchant
vessels would be barred from the
war zones.
HULL STATEMENT
U. S. Secretary of State Cordell
Hull, in contrast with Ribbentrop's
statement about German-American
friendship, said that capture of the
City of Flint involved a question of
force and that, even though the ship
was carrying German-designated
contraband to British ports, it was a
most unusual procedure for a bel
ligerent to take a prize ship into a
neutral port such as the Bay of Kola.
But the government's most imme
diate concern was to leam without
delay what had become of Captain
Gainard and his crew.
The British said it was difficult, to
see how the United States could ac
cuse Germany of violating interna
tional law since the City of Flint
appeared to be carrying contraband
to Britain.
The French believed that the seiz
ure of the American vessel would
compel a clarification of German-
Soviet relations, forcing Russia to
reveal immediately whether she is
whole-heartedly neutral.
THREE SHIPS SUNK
Three more merchant ships, two
of them British, were reported to
have been sunk in Germany's naval
onslaught against, the British block
ade of the Reich. A fourth ship was
reported fired upon.
Whether it was mere propaganda
or not, Ribbentrop's speech seemed
to have slammed the door on any
further mediation efforts to end the
war for the time being.
The French were furious at. what
they callcd Ribbentrop's "specious
attempts" to drive a wedge between
Britain and France. They suspected
that Germany might still be trying
to prepare the way for an offer of a
separate peace to Franceâ€”an offer
which all neutral observers agree
would be doomed to failure.
"Hie war will go 011 until Hitler
ism is crushed," said French officials.
But so far as that "war to the fin
ish" was concerned on the western
front it remained a mild affair, with
scant prospects of a smashing blow
by either Germans or Allies. Patrol
skirmishes and ambushes were the
only action reported by the French
high command.
