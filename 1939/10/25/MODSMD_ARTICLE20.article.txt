# Excom Okays Big Game Dance; Allows 48 Hours For Signing Name Band
## Bids to Be $5; Millbrae Club Picked as Place 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Stanford's own Big Game cele
bration was assured last night, as
Ex Committee approved the off
campus dance proposed for the night
of the Stanford-Cal game.
Specifications include bids at $a
a couple; a $500 band, name to be
announced within two days; the
dance to be held at the Millbrae
Country Club in San Bruno.
Although both Dean John Bunn
and Dean Mary Yost have given
their tentative approval of the
dance, tonight's decision is subject
to their final sanction.
PINKY TOM UN JTAYORED
Pinky Tomlin was selected a.s the
committee's first choice of the avail
able bands in the middle price range,
other possibilities being Del Court
ney, Archie Blcyer, Bob Zurke,
Charlie Barnett, Jimmy Grier, Gus
Arnheim, and perhaps Ray Noble.
Ken Cuthbertson, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, one of the chief supporters of
the whole plan, urged members of
Ex Committee to work together to
promote the dance and make it an
annual Stanford institution.
ROLL CALL ASKED
Since an hour's hot debate pre
ceded the committee's action in ap
proving the dance, a roll call vote
was requested. The results follow:
For: Coline U pshaw, Barney
Ferguson, Mary June Montgom
ery, Jack Harris, and Ken Koch.
Against: John Partridge, Ann
Townsend, Bill Kapp.
Mollie West and Bill Janss were
absent.
COBBS ASKS ECONOMY
Soft-voiced John Cobbs, student
manager, was chief critic of the
proposal, opposing the dance on
grounds of economy.
"We are in no position to be
throwing money around," he de
clared. "Remember, we still have
a boathouse to pay for. We are in
no position to be pouring money
down the drain.''
Predicting a loss of $200 to $800,
Cobbs called that an expensive price
to pay for the information as to
whether or not Stanford would sup
port a dance on Big Game night.
"Why, you-all can get a Gallup
poll made for that," he said.
CLARK OPPOSES DANCE
Annabelle Clark, president of
Women's Conference, opposed the
dance throughout the discussion.
She had no vote, however, bring an
ex-ofTicio member of Ex Committee.
Complaining that there had been
too many delays in deciding on the
project, she suggested all the data
that has been assembled on bands
and ball rooms be filed away until
next year and the whole idea of a
dance dropped for the present.
"I think you're being awfully al
truistic about this thing," she said.
"I don't think anyone cares about
this announcement that we approve
the dance. It looks sloppy not to tell
what band will play. No, I haven't
anything else to offer, but can't you
see the effects on the students of a
vague announcement?"
Coline Upshaw replied, "If they
have any brains, they'll see that you
have to decide on the dance before
you can sign the band."
"Well, maybe they don't have any
brains," Miss Clark answered.
Discussing the length of time it
has taken to reach a decision on the
dance, Cuthbertson pointed out that
members of Cardinals have been
I working continuously lo gather data
j necessary for this decision.
Livingston declared lh;:t putting;
i oil Stanford's first Big Game dance
j until next year would be no atlvan
| tage.
j "There is a certain number of
I people to see and letters to write in
j arranging a big dance of this sort, i
! and it would take just as long next
| year to start things moving," Living
ston said.
OPINIONS GIVFN
j In brief, opinions of .some other i
committeemen active in the discus-j
l sion follow:
Barney Ferguson: "You won't
meet much competition from the
City, where the evening would cost
I $15 a couple."
Bill Rapp: "The frosh are enthus
iasticâ€”-many of them already have
| their dates."
Jack Harris: "Most of the fellows
tare against the dance."
Mary June Montgomery: "Roble
likes the idea."
Bob Putnam: "You won't sell 1
enough bids to pay for expenses."
John Partridge: "We're going lur- i
j ther and further into debt money ]
j doesn't grow on trees, you know."
Ann Townsend: "We have waited
too long to decide. I'm afraid it 1
wouldn't go over this year."
i John Cobbs: "I wouldn't pay $5 to \
j go to the dance."
The question of the Big Game '
dance occupied most of the meeting,
but the following other subjects were
j considered:
INTERNATIONAL CLUIi: Char
| ter of the club was approved, after
j Ann Townsend had reported that it
contained "only a few little bitty
' errors."
QUAD: Barney Ferguson, reported
| favorably on an amendment, pro
-1 posed by Quad Manager Jim Will,
that books sold after March 1 not f
| be used as a basis for cutting Quad j
! profits, as would be th<? case under
I an amendment passed last year.
GOLF AWARDS: The following
I varsity golfers were granted block
S for participating on a national
j championship team: Warren
| Charles Finger, Don Kennedy, Dick
; Wright, and Art Doering.
The awards were approved on rec- j
ommendation of Alfred R. Masters, j
! general manager of the Board of,
Athletic Control, and Coach Eddie
Twiggs.
