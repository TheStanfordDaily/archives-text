### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Stanford's own Big Game cele
bration was assured last night, as
Ex Committee approved the off
campus dance proposed for the night
of the Stanford-Cal game.
Specifications include bids at $a
a couple; a $500 band, name to be
announced within two days; the
dance to be held at the Millbrae
Country Club in San Bruno.
Although both Dean John Bunn
and Dean Mary Yost have given
their tentative approval of the
dance, tonight's decision is subject
to their final sanction.
PINKY TOM UN JTAYORED
Pinky Tomlin was selected a.s the
committee's first choice of the avail
able bands in the middle price range,
other possibilities being Del Court
ney, Archie Blcyer, Bob Zurke,
Charlie Barnett, Jimmy Grier, Gus
Arnheim, and perhaps Ray Noble.
Ken Cuthbertson, A.S.S.U. presi
dent, one of the chief supporters of
the whole plan, urged members of
Ex Committee to work together to
promote the dance and make it an
annual Stanford institution.
ROLL CALL ASKED
Since an hour's hot debate pre
ceded the committee's action in ap
proving the dance, a roll call vote
was requested. The results follow:
For: Coline U pshaw, Barney
Ferguson, Mary June Montgom
ery, Jack Harris, and Ken Koch.
Against: John Partridge, Ann
Townsend, Bill Kapp.
Mollie West and Bill Janss were
absent.
COBBS ASKS ECONOMY
Soft-voiced John Cobbs, student
manager, was chief critic of the
proposal, opposing the dance on
grounds of economy.
"We are in no position to be
throwing money around," he de
clared. "Remember, we still have
a boathouse to pay for. We are in
no position to be pouring money
down the drain.''
Predicting a loss of $200 to $800,
Cobbs called that an expensive price
to pay for the information as to
whether or not Stanford would sup
port a dance on Big Game night.
"Why, you-all can get a Gallup
poll made for that," he said.
CLARK OPPOSES DANCE
Annabelle Clark, president of
Women's Conference, opposed the
dance throughout the discussion.
She had no vote, however, bring an
ex-ofTicio member of Ex Committee.
Complaining that there had been
too many delays in deciding on the
project, she suggested all the data
that has been assembled on bands
and ball rooms be filed away until
next year and the whole idea of a
dance dropped for the present.
"I think you're being awfully al
truistic about this thing," she said.
"I don't think anyone cares about
this announcement that we approve
the dance. It looks sloppy not to tell
what band will play. No, I haven't
anything else to offer, but can't you
see the effects on the students of a
vague announcement?"
Coline Upshaw replied, "If they
have any brains, they'll see that you
have to decide on the dance before
you can sign the band."
"Well, maybe they don't have any
brains," Miss Clark answered.
Discussing the length of time it
has taken to reach a decision on the
dance, Cuthbertson pointed out that
members of Cardinals have been
