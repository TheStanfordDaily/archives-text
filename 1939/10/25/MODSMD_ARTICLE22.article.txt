# Hoover Urges Peace for U.S.
## Post Article Recounts World War Disaster 
### 
NEW YORK Oct. 24 (UP).—For
mer President Herbert Hoover, in
an article in this week's issue of the
Saturday Evening Post, traced brief
ly the history of Europe's wars and
their causes and summed up with a
warning "America must keep out of
these wars."
Mr. Hoover recounted America's
experiences in the last war and the
post-war years, and reviewed the
reasons which dragged the United
States into the last conflict and
which are showing their heads again.
The former President said, in part:
"First: We can strengthen our
army and navy to a point where no
soldier dare land on the Western
Hemisphere irrespective of who wins
the war in Europe.
"Second: We can put our own
house in order. We can demonstrate
that self-governing, free people can
solve the problems imposed by the
industrial revolution.
"Third: We can thus make a,
demonstration on this continent that
true liberalism is not dead. We can
hold a light to a crumbling world
the lamp of liberty as a guide to re
generation.
"We cannot solve the problems of,
or keep the peace in, Europe. Self
determination by many peoples is
impo sible because of boundaries or
economic life. America cannot, by
the words oi a contract, substitute
the processes of justice for hate and
fear; we can make war in Europe
but we cannot make an enduring
peace.
"We cannot create liberty and
sell-government in Europe. We can
not reconstruct Europe. The social
regeneration of nations must come
from within; it cannot come from
wit hout.
