# Farm Soccer Club Meets Undefeated Spartan Team On Varsity Field Today
## Cards' Powerful Attack, Defense To Meet Season's Severest Test Against Favored San Jose Hooters 
### 
Boasting a powerful offensive antl an equally strong defensive, the
Farm's soccer club gets its severest test of the season this afternoon at
â€¢1 o'clock on the varsity field against Sjiii Jose State's nndefcated but
tied Spartans.
In three games the Cards have produced a sti::'iHating and well organ-

ized attack that has cashed in on
every scoring opportunity. However,
against the invaders the team will
for the first time this season in con
ference play be up against an eleven
which ranks as a title favorite.
Coach Harry Maloney frankly ad
mits that this is just about his best
soccer club ever, but realizes that
the San Jose outfit is probably one
of its best and that a lively match
should result. What makes the
Spartan varsity so feared is their
recent 1-1 deadlock with the Berke
ley Bears, which itself has already
run amuck through five other op
ponents.
In defeating San Francisco Jaysee,
5-1, last Saturday the Indians were
scored upon for the first time in
three games. Both San Mateo and
Menlo Jay.sees had been whitewash
ed in the two previous encounters
while the Stanford offensive was
good for nine points.
Chris Sontum topped the scorers
in the S.F.J.C. tilt with four goals,
while George Dole took care of the
other point. Sontum is one of Ma
loney's most valuable players, be
ing capable of playing any of three
forward posts.
While the varsity tangles with San
Jose on the varsity field just east of
the varsity tennis courts, the second
team will play the Spartan seconds
on the frosh field at 4 o'clock.
Coach Maloney said his probable
line-up would be Tito Sanz-Agero
at goal, Bill Hamilton at right back,
Cam Pierce at left back, Grayson
Bryan at right half, Wilson Clark at
center, Ken Cuthbertson at left half,
Bill Arrasmith at outside right,
George Dole at inside right, Ed Rog
ers at center forward, Al Pellas at
inside left, and Chris Sontum at out
side left.
Rudy Munzer, Dave MacKenzie,
George LaNicca, Teller Weinman,
Ned Pugh, and Joe Coberly will
probably see substitute duty.
