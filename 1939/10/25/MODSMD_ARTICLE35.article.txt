### JERRY MAYER 
Several centuries ago, according
to the Bible, Joseph gained the Pha
raoh's favor by rightly interpreting
one of the latter's dreams as mean
ing that seven years of famine will
follow seven years of plenty.
Today the best Stanford soccer
team since 1932 will attempt to win
a crucial game against San Jose
State. If the Indians hurdle the
Spartans their chances of annexing
the championship will be bright,
says Coach Harry Maloney.
Reversing the biblical cycle,
Stanford has had seven long years
of famine. Today it has a chance
to initiate an equal period of
plenty, or at least bring the fam
ine to an end.
For this year's team has already, ♦
in three games, scored more goals
than last year's outfit did in an en
tire season — and the season is
young yet.
The Cards will field a team of
practically all seniors today. After
four years of working together,
they have finally been molded into
a close unit. Starting as freshmen,
practically none of these men had
ever kicked a soccer ball in his
life.
But one man—Harry Maloney—
took this raw, inexperienced mate
rial. and worked it into the best
team Stanford has had for seven
years—a team that may go on to a
championship, if it gets over to
day's obstacle.
On the entire team there are only
three men who had ever touched a
soccer ball before coming to Stan
ford—Tito Sanz-Agero, who played
in Spain and is an outstanding
goalie; A1 Pellas, who got some ex
perience in South America; and
Chris Sontum, who hails from Nor
way.
Contrast this with the California
team, and the result is amazing. The
list of men on the Cal team who
have had experience in foreign
lands is staggering. In fact, it's dif
ficult to even find an Anglo-Saxon
name on the entire Cal roster.
Maloney claims that the aver
age American youth who takes up
soccer has one good year in him—
his senior year. After three years
of apprenticeship he then becomes
a master. Ilis last year is a cul
mination of three seasons of learn
ing details, picking up experience,
and developing technique.
Maloney uses as many men as pos
sible in a game in order to allow
the men to apply what they are
learning. That way, if they stay to
gether, they "arrive" in their last
year.
Stanford's senior soccer players
stuck it out, today they have a
chance to reap the reward for their
persistence. Let's drop out and take
a look at the boys today, huh!

team since 1932 will attempt to win
a crucial game against San Jose
State. If the Indians hurdle the
Spartans their chances of annexing
the championship will be bright,
says Coach Harry Maloney.
Reversing the biblical cycle,
Stanford has had seven long years
of famine. Today it has a chance
to initiate an equal period of
plenty, or at least bring the fam
ine to an end.
For this year's team has already, ♦
in three games, scored more goals
than last year's outfit did in an en
tire season — and the season is
young yet.
The Cards will field a team of
practically all seniors today. After
four years of working together,
they have finally been molded into
a close unit. Starting as freshmen,
practically none of these men had
ever kicked a soccer ball in his
life.
But one man—Harry Maloney—
took this raw, inexperienced mate
rial. and worked it into the best
team Stanford has had for seven
years—a team that may go on to a
championship, if it gets over to
day's obstacle.
On the entire team there are only
three men who had ever touched a
soccer ball before coming to Stan
ford—Tito Sanz-Agero, who played
in Spain and is an outstanding
goalie; A1 Pellas, who got some ex
perience in South America; and
Chris Sontum, who hails from Nor
way.
Contrast this with the California
team, and the result is amazing. The
list of men on the Cal team who
have had experience in foreign
lands is staggering. In fact, it's dif
ficult to even find an Anglo-Saxon
name on the entire Cal roster.
Maloney claims that the aver
age American youth who takes up
soccer has one good year in him—
his senior year. After three years
of apprenticeship he then becomes
a master. Ilis last year is a cul
mination of three seasons of learn
ing details, picking up experience,
and developing technique.
Maloney uses as many men as pos
sible in a game in order to allow
the men to apply what they are
learning. That way, if they stay to
gether, they "arrive" in their last
year.
Stanford's senior soccer players
stuck it out, today they have a
chance to reap the reward for their
persistence. Let's drop out and take
a look at the boys today, huh!
Several centuries ago, according
to the Bible, Joseph gained the Pha
raoh's favor by rightly interpreting
one of the latter's dreams as mean
ing that seven years of famine will
follow seven years of plenty.
