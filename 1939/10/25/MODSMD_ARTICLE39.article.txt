j Defying the wintry blasts that
J swept yesterday's practice field,
| Stanford's freshman football squad
. went through a heavy scrimmage,
i polishing up for their coming tilt
with the U.C.L.A. frosh.
Carrying out his program of work
| ing to perfection 8 or 10 plays by
the first and second strings, Coach
| Harry Shipkey had his best two
j elevens working against Ihe re
! serves. Both Milt. Vucinich and Red
I Robinson showed some fancy run
ning as they knifed through the op
position for many yards.
It is very doubtful that Eric Arm
strong, hustling little halfback out
1 with an injured knee since the Tro
| jan game, will be in suit for Satur
| day's tilt. And the doctor's decision
I that \vill allow Hank Norberg to get
| into real action against the Bruins
j is still hanging in the balance. How
ever, if Hank can not see any heavy
action, his trusty toe will be on
hand to kick conversions.
Damage mounted into hundreds
j of thousands of dollars by a severe
j drought in New England and the
Atlantic Seaboard.
