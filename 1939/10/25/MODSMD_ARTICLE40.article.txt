# Washington Pass Plays Click Against First String Backs
## 
### 
Moon Mullin, working from Washington formations, spiralled the ball
over and around Tiny Thornhill's first string as the Indian coach sent his
gridders through their second straight scrum under the lights last night.
Impersonating Dean MeAdams, triple-threat Husky halfback, Mullin
connected with a good percentage of his tosses to Johnny Sturgeon on plays

.brought back from scouting journeys j
by Husky Hunt.
After practice Thornhill said (hat i
he would scrimmage the squad ear- ]
lier loday, as the lighting last night I
evidently hindered the first team !
backfield of Groves, Coldiron, Albert S
and Standlee in spotting passes.
Swede Johansen took Stan Ander
sen's place at left tackle again and
played some good defensive foot- i
ball.
Dave Patterson, who was held
out of Monday's scrimmage because I
of a bad shoulder, took over his reg- j
ular right guard spot again last j
night. Johnny Kerman. the other |
guard, was held out, however, and i
Steve Keussef moved up from the j
second string.
Thor Peterson will definitely not |
see action Saturday. John Casey, a |
dash man on the track squad, has i
taken over his position as under- \
study to Norm Standlee.
A chill wind blowing across the j
practice field had all the players l
showing more pep than has been
evident since the U.C.L.A. game ten i
days ago.
A 1939 survey indicated the larg- |
est supply of feed grains and hay j
per animal in the United States in !
more than ten years.
