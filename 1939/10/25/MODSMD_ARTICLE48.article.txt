STANFORD wants a Big Game dance.
That was proved last night when, after
long argument and careful consideration, the
members of Ex Committee voted in favor of the
A.S.S.U. sponsoring the off-campus celebration.
The yeas and nays that were voiced were
backed not only by the judgment of the repre
sentatives present, but by campus sentiment
as it had been sounded by them.
Naturally a great many people will be totally
unaffected by the decision. They had made up
their minds to go to Del Monte or to the City
long before Ex Committee ever considered giv
ing an after-the-game dance.
But Stanford's student government operates
on democratic principles. The celebration that
it is sponsoring is not designed for the chosen
few who can withstand the cost of a week-end
at Del Monte or the jacked-up couvert charges
at San Francisco hotels. It has been arranged so
that every Stanford student who wants to can
afford to attend.
And it is going to be a damn good party.
The orchestra, which will be announced
within the next 48 hours according to Ex Com
mittee's stipulation, will be chosen from a list
of outstanding big names. The Millbrae Country
Club, with two large ballrooms and a moonlit
patio, is a perfect location.
But, best of all, this is going to be Stanford's
own dance. Students no longer will have to
compete for a place on the dance floor with the
corpulent, intoxicated Cal grad of the class of
'09. Nor will they have to shove through the
bone-crushing crowd in the airless Bali base
ment. Every feature of the dance will be de
signed for A.S.S.U. consumption.
But, this is not all that Ex Committee had in
mind when it voted its approval last night.
Its members knew that they were giving the
student body a much-needed social service by
solving the after-the-Big Game entertainment
problem. They knew that if this first dance is
a success, such a celebration probably will
become an annual institution.
The members of Ex Committee have done
their part.
Now it is up to the student body to make the
Big Game dance a success.

Big Game dance a success.
STANFORD wants a Big Game dance.
That was proved last night when, after
long argument and careful consideration, the
members of Ex Committee voted in favor of the
A.S.S.U. sponsoring the off-campus celebration.
The yeas and nays that were voiced were
backed not only by the judgment of the repre
sentatives present, but by campus sentiment
as it had been sounded by them.
Naturally a great many people will be totally
unaffected by the decision. They had made up
their minds to go to Del Monte or to the City
long before Ex Committee ever considered giv
ing an after-the-game dance.
But Stanford's student government operates
on democratic principles. The celebration that
it is sponsoring is not designed for the chosen
few who can withstand the cost of a week-end
at Del Monte or the jacked-up couvert charges
at San Francisco hotels. It has been arranged so
that every Stanford student who wants to can
afford to attend.
And it is going to be a damn good party.
The orchestra, which will be announced
within the next 48 hours according to Ex Com
mittee's stipulation, will be chosen from a list
of outstanding big names. The Millbrae Country
Club, with two large ballrooms and a moonlit
patio, is a perfect location.
But, best of all, this is going to be Stanford's
own dance. Students no longer will have to
compete for a place on the dance floor with the
corpulent, intoxicated Cal grad of the class of
'09. Nor will they have to shove through the
bone-crushing crowd in the airless Bali base
ment. Every feature of the dance will be de
signed for A.S.S.U. consumption.
But, this is not all that Ex Committee had in
mind when it voted its approval last night.
Its members knew that they were giving the
student body a much-needed social service by
solving the after-the-Big Game entertainment
problem. They knew that if this first dance is
a success, such a celebration probably will
become an annual institution.
The members of Ex Committee have done
their part.
Now it is up to the student body to make the
Big Game dance a success.
