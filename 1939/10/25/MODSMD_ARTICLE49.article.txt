AT Oxford, at Cambridge, and at Yale hun
dreds of students meet every two weeks
to take part in a lively open debate on a cur
rent controversial issue. At Stanford hundreds
of students have the same opportunity, but usu
ally only 35 take advantage of it.
Divided into three political parties, labor, lib
eral, and conservative, the Stanford Political
Union is potentially the most interesting or
ganization on the campus. Its monthly meetings
could be packed with valuable opinions and
brilliant repartee —if the student body would
overcome its customary inertia long enough to
attend them.
For a long time critics have condemned Stan
ford for being indifferent to everything outside
of its snug private world. But with the menace
of the European situation hanging over our
heads, and the thought of going to war lying in
the back of every man's mind, no one can claim
that students are not conscious of national and
international events.
Tonight the reorganized Political Union will
debate on the subject, "Resolved: that the Uni
ted States should aid England and France in the
event of their threatened defeat at the hands of
Germany." Certainly no topic is more vital to
those who may be the doughboys of the Second
World War.
This year the meetings of the S.P.U. should
be jammed to the doors.
Because the age of indifference is over.
