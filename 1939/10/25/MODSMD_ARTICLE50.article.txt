# The Dear Girls

### 
SOME people still remember when everyone
said and believed, "The woman's place is
in the home." And some still say it but none

of them say that axiom exists in fact.
They can't. They have heard, at least, that
women work in factories; they know of v/omen
doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers, and mer
chants—not to mention teachers, professors,
stenographers, telephone operators, and sales
women. And movie stars. And star reporters.
When this masculine world reflects on that, it
seems a trifle disquieting: and when the aver
age Stanford man first learns precisely what the
Stanford vocational committee is, he may find
it downright sinister.
You see, this vocational guidance committee
is a cabal of women trying to get themselves,
and all Stanford women, jobs.
Actually, the eight women who compose this
committee are among the most enterprising and
most to-be-commended females on the Farm.
They are among the few who realize that life
isn't exactly a glorious cycle of song, the few
who are taking advantage of the American uni
versity as it is today: a vocational training
school.
Along with their academic courses which
give them a certain amount of sundry infor
mation which will be practical to them during
life after college, these eight women are making
it possible for Farm women to actually learn
precisely what is needed in the world of busi
ness, and to establish necessary connections.
And more, they are trying to help these
women to decide just what vocations they are
going to follow. They are doing this by devel
oping an informational library of letters, school
folders, and books on business fields; and by
inviting qualified speakers to comment on their
professions and the opportunities for women in
them.
It is a thing worth doing- The only hitch is
getting people to use this library and take ad
vantage of the talks by the speakers.
So maybe them college women won't get all
the jobs, after all.—D. J.
