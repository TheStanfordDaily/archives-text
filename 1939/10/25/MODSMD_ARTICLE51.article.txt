TIIE VANISHING PRINCETONIAN
JOHN J. OSBOKN, Princeton, '39, has made an in
tensive study of fertility among graduates of his
Alma Mater. His senior thesis reveals the rather
alarming fact that alumni of Old Nassau are failing "to
reproduce themselves." The average Princeton man
does not. marry until he is nearly 30. And then he
only sires 1.0 children, while 2.3 offspring per man are
necessary to keep the sons and daughters of Princeton
grads from perishing from the earth.
This frank admission on the part of a great eastern
university will doubtless initiate considerable self
appraisal on the part of Stanford men. Who knows?
Perhaps we too are failing to maintain our statistical
average.
At any rate parlors and discussion groups are alive
these days with that machine-age problem: Are the
intellectual upper-classes (as represented by college
men) perishing? Is their rate of propagation giving
way to the bountiful reproduction of the uneducated?
* * * *
r |' , HE Princeton survey and others seem to indicate
that the intelligentsia are slowly dying out. Fur
ther than that, the Princeton survey finds a reason:
Princeton men feel that they cannot afford to have
too many children because of limited financial means.
And added to this is the general atmosphere of uncer
tainty that pervades the country and the whole world.
Most educated parents like to feel that their children
will have an opportunity to live securely and happily.
And the prospect of security and happiness is not made
very definite by economic distress and international
war.
Perhaps it is true "that intelligent people should
have bigger families." But in some respects that is a
misstatement of the issue. It is certainly not a con
demnable cowardice that makes enlightened people
hesitate before risking suffering for their children. But
it is a condemnable cowardice that makes the enlight
ened person sit back and decline to help make the
world a better place for his children to live in.
Prudence and biological conservatism will continue
to influence the educated to have small families just
as long as social upheaval makes life uncertain. It is
more the duty of the intelligent to work for social
betterment than it is to procreate, although perhaps
not quite so easy.

TIIE VANISHING PRINCETONIAN
JOHN J. OSBOKN, Princeton, '39, has made an in
tensive study of fertility among graduates of his
Alma Mater. His senior thesis reveals the rather
alarming fact that alumni of Old Nassau are failing "to
reproduce themselves." The average Princeton man
does not. marry until he is nearly 30. And then he
only sires 1.0 children, while 2.3 offspring per man are
necessary to keep the sons and daughters of Princeton
grads from perishing from the earth.
This frank admission on the part of a great eastern
university will doubtless initiate considerable self
appraisal on the part of Stanford men. Who knows?
Perhaps we too are failing to maintain our statistical
average.
At any rate parlors and discussion groups are alive
these days with that machine-age problem: Are the
intellectual upper-classes (as represented by college
men) perishing? Is their rate of propagation giving
way to the bountiful reproduction of the uneducated?

r |' , HE Princeton survey and others seem to indicate
that the intelligentsia are slowly dying out. Fur
ther than that, the Princeton survey finds a reason:
Princeton men feel that they cannot afford to have
too many children because of limited financial means.
And added to this is the general atmosphere of uncer
tainty that pervades the country and the whole world.
Most educated parents like to feel that their children
will have an opportunity to live securely and happily.
And the prospect of security and happiness is not made
very definite by economic distress and international
war.
Perhaps it is true "that intelligent people should
have bigger families." But in some respects that is a
misstatement of the issue. It is certainly not a con
demnable cowardice that makes enlightened people
hesitate before risking suffering for their children. But
it is a condemnable cowardice that makes the enlight
ened person sit back and decline to help make the
world a better place for his children to live in.
Prudence and biological conservatism will continue
to influence the educated to have small families just
as long as social upheaval makes life uncertain. It is
more the duty of the intelligent to work for social
betterment than it is to procreate, although perhaps
not quite so easy.
