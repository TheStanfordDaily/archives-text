# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						PEOPLE—NO! 
### 
THE EDITOR, SIR:
I would like to contest one step in M.S.A.'s prac
tical guide to peace, namely his fourth paragraph,
calling for a national referendum in the United States
giving the voters ihe choice of saying "Yes" or "No"
to the question, "Should America enter the war?"
There have been many such attempts to amend the
Constitution to this effect. All have quietly been drop
ped and have died their deserved deaths.
Would you, M.S.A., put the momentous question of
this country's entrance into war up to 80 million people
who are open to all the insidious forces of propaganda
and militaristic patriotism, whose opinions can be
swayed at such a critical time by the forces of news
paper, radio, and motion picture? Would you have this,
or would you put the question of the declaration of
war where it rightly belongs, in the hands of the Con
gress, whose representatives have the opportunity to
debate such a question, not with a completely open
mind, but with a mind that is not so easily swayed by
brass bands and yellow journalism?
♦ * m ♦
r phrase "Remember the Maine" in 1808 swept
the people of this country into a frenzy of hatred
for the Spanish and nationalism for America, to a
great degree responsible for our entrance into the
Spanish-American War. Despite all the claims that
this country has become propaganda conscious, such
a well-intentioned program has not yet become con
centrated enough to keep the majority of American
voters from disregarding propaganda in case they were
given the vote following another Lusitania incident or
similar loss of American lives due to the ravages of
enemy forces.
In addition, do you think the Congress will uive up
its Constitutional light to have the sole power to de
clare war to the extent of passing any such amend
ment by a two-thirds majority?
For peace and for keeping a war vote nut of the
hands of the people.
C. E. R.
