James Lyons, assisted by Emita de
Sosa, danced a program last night in
Memorial Hall as a part of the Tues
day Evening Series.
Judging from the audience reac
tion it would have been much bet
ter if Mr. Lyons had assisted Seno
rita de Sosa, or, better still, if he
hadn't been there at all.
Perhaps this unfortunate fact is
due to the lack of understanding of
modern dance still prevalent in un
informed circles. But maybe it was
because Senorita de Sosa is a very
pretty girl, with an infectious
smile, who does Spanish dances in a
far more than satisfactory fashion;
and because Mr. Lyons is so pain
fully artistic.
in two dances, however, he forgot
the modern dance and really showed
what he could do with fundamental
dance rhythms. The Rhumba, danc
ed in an eerie green light with
drum accompaniment, had a wild,
primitive quality, and the Dance of
the Pulque, done in Aztec costume,
was exciting and understandable.
"Theme and Variations" and
"Dance of Spirituality" may have
been on higher plane,' as far as the
dance goes, but they were so< ab
stract and athletic that the audience
got tired just watching them.
Senorita de Sosa did her bit toward
lightening the evening, but she had
only two solos. Mr. Lyons wore a
false mustache during the last
dances, which he apparently don
ned to add to the Spanish atmos
phere of the dances. He looked very
villainous.—No well
