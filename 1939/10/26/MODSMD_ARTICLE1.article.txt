Chamberlain and Ribbentrop were
still trading verbal bombshells in
Europe's "war of nerves." It may not
long be a war of nerves.
"The moment has come," the Nazi
press said yesterday," for merciless
bombardment of the British Isles
now that Foreign Minister von Rib
bentrop has publicly accepted Cham
berlain's challenge of a war to the
finish."
It was Germany's declaration of
war against Great Britain and a
complete shattering of any pros
pects of another Nazi peace offer.
Apparently, then, the German in
vasions of the English and Scottish
coasts, including the recent bomb
ings of British warships at Scapa
Flow and the Firth of Forth, were
nothing but preliminary gestures,
mere military "feelers," compared
with the destruction and havoc that
Goering's air force — really the
Reich's strongest weapon —is capable
of inflicting.

iiWEAI'ONS must speak," said
Goering's Essen newspaper,
adding' that Ribbcntrop's speech
signalled the moment when the
German attack must lx> launched.
Thus far Germany never has de- j
clared war formally on Britain and
France, though the latter two
made declarations against Hitler
on Sept. :i.
This bitter, insistent attack by the
Nazi press followed intensification of
Nazi naval pressure on the Allied
blockade. Then, too, there were re
ports floating around Europe that
Germany might be contemplating a
major blow on the western front.

There's really little basis for such
a rumor, because, with winter ap
proaching, it's doubtful that either
side will begin any offensive in the
West. It's more likely, though, that
Goering will turn loose his aerial
attack or, perhaps, increase naval
action against the English blockade.
At any rate, this intensified aerial
and naval action was presumed to
have been discussed in detail at a
military conference between Hitler
and his key generals yesterday.
While the newspapers were whipping
up anger against the French and
English, Nazis were careful to em
phasize their friendship for the
United States.

d 4N the eve of the Senate's vote
on revision of the Neutrality
Law, Germany isn't going to an
tagonize the world's greatest neu
tral power. Over and over again
they insist that, in the words of
Ribbentrop, war between the two
countries is "impossible."
Germany is fighting only because
"England is threatening our exist
ence," the Nazis are saying.
Meanwhile, the London News
Chronicle reported yesterday, with
out any confirmation, that Germany's
axis friend, Soviet Russia, is pre
paring to send an ultimatum to
Sweden demanding the Swedish
ports of Gothenburg and Karls
krona.
Both ports, Gothenburg opposite
the tip of Denmark and Karlskropa
in southern Sweden on the Baltic,
arc of tremendous strategic value
in controlling shipping between
(be North Sea and (he Baltic. The
News Chronicle said that the
Kremlin hadn't decided yet when
(o send the ultimatum, hut that it
probably would be dispatched
within a few days.
Anyway, Madame Alexandra Kol
lantay, Soviet Minister to Sweden,
has flown to Moscow in response to
a government summons. The News
Chronicle wasn't sparing with its
sensational exposes, either, because
it predicted that the Soviets may
act first on a proposal for the parti
tioning of Rumania before going on
with the Scandinavian grab.
