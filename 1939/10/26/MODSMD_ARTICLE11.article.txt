# Card Football Men Complete First Tuberculin Skin Test
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
They may not look tuberculous but Stanford's entire football squad is
undergoing examination by (he Men's Health Service for signs of the
disease, according to Dr. Charles E. Shcpard, director.
Started at the first of the year, testing has progressed so rapidly that
all members of the football squad, which leaves today to meet (he Huskies

at Seattle, have been given the first
step in the examination, the tuber
culin test.
TEST SHOWS EXPOSURE
This consists of an intracutaneous
(within the skin) hypodermic injec
tion, which shows previous exposure
to the tubercle bacillus. A positive
reaction indicates that the individual
(1) has tuberculosis, (2) has re
covered from tuberculosis, or (3)
has been exposed without contract
ing the disease.
Persons showing a positive reac
tion are examined under the fluoro
scope for signs of tuberculosis of the
lungs â€” the real object of all this
searching.
FLUOROSCOPE VALUABLE
The fluoroscope, a relatively recent
addition to Health Service equip
ment, operates on the same principle
as X-ray photography, except that
the rays are thrown upon a fluoro
scopic screen instead of upon a pho
tographic film.
In this way, an X-i - ay view of a
patient can be studied without go
ing to the expense of taking photo
graphs. Already the instrument has
saved students thousands of dollars,
says Dr. Shepard, and has made
possible routine examinations of this
sort.
Acquired last December, the in
strument was a Christmas present
from Mrs. Louis Stern of Palo Alto,
who also is Ihe donor of the Palo
Alto community center and has
helped many needy Stanford stu
dents.
ATHLETES TESTED
Not only the members of the
football squad, but all other varsity
athletes are being given the exam
ination as a matter of routine. Track,
soccer, and basketball men are being
tested, as well as all candidates in
the School of Education for teaching
credentials and advanced degrees.
Although the examinations arc
given as a matter of routine only to
certain groups, any student will be
examined on request, according to
Dr. Shepard.
Over 500 of the tuberculin tests
have been completed already this
year, he reports, and fluoroscopic ex
aminations are progressing as rap
idly as students are able to report.
