# Farm Turns Out Today For Parade, Train Rally As Grid Squad Departs
## In Favorite's Role for First Time, Cards Set 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Pre-game favorites for the first
time this year, 36 members of the
Indian grid squad will entrain this
afternoon for their game against
Washington Saturday in Seattle.
The Card gridders will probably
enter the game slight favorites be
cause of their surprise 14-14 tie with
U.C.L.A. two weeks ago.
Tiny Thornhill sent the squad
through a stiff scrimmage in their
last practice last night. The first
two teams practiced against Husky
plays run by the Grays for over half
an hour.
ARC LIGHT PRACTICE
Later in the evening, under the arc
lights, the first eleven look the ball
and ran plays against a pick-up de
fensive outfit.
Stan Andersen took over his right,
tackle birth in the scrum after
spending the first two practices of
the week in the rest home with a
bad cold. With the workout under
his belt, Andersen is expected to be
in shape to start Saturday.
Johnny Kerman, first-string guard,
stayed out of the contact work be
cause of a sore shoulder, and Steve
Keusseff took his place teaming
with Dave Patterson.
STURGEON SHINES
The work of Johnny Sturgeon was
a highlight of the practice. Ranking
as third team right halfback, Stur
geon tore off good gains carrying the
ball against the first team from
Washington formations, and was on
the receiving end of what passes the
grays completed.
On defense Sturgeon and Jake
Levin gave the first-string backfield
plenty of trouble. Levin, a sopho
more, played the right guard spot.
Norm Standlee was in his usual
form carrying the ball, tearing off
some large chunks of yardage.
Frankie Albert was at the left half
spot, and pitched some nice passes
to Graff, Groves, and Coldiron.
DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT
The team as a whole showed defi
nite improvement over the night
before against the Husky plays,
breaking up most of the passes and
bottling up the running attack.
Moon Mullin impersonated Dean
McAdams again, but was unable to
connect with the passes that clicked
Tuesday. The Indian line was
rushing him off his feet consistently.
McAdams is the chief threat of
the Husky backfield. The sparkplug
of the team, however, is Bill Glea
son, 160-pound left half. Gleasoti,
while not the triple threat man that.
McAdams is, is a good passer and a
tricky runner. Playing safety on de
fense, he is a definite threat run
ning back punts.
Gleason is no stranger to the
Thornhillmen, as he played a prom
inent part in the Huskies' 10-7 win
last year. Rudy Mucha, 210-pound,
6-foot center, is the key to the
Washington defense. Picked on many
all-coast teams last year, Mucha is
rated the best man on the coast in
his position and a threat for All-
American.
SOPHOMORE STAR
Playing next to Mucha in last
week's Oregon State game and a
probable starter aSturday is Ray
Frankowski, outstanding sopho
more on Jimmy Phelan's squad.
Husky Hunt, after seeing Wash
(Continued from page I)
ington in action twice, said that the 1
Huskies are a better team than their
record shows. They haven't come
out on the top side of the score in
four games, but they gave Oregon
State a battle before losing,
last week. Against Washington
1 State, the Huskies ran up a goodly
! total of yards gained, but were un
able to score.
