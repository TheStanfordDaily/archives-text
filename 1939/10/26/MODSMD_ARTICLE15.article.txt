# Nicoll to Name Band for Dance At Noon Today
## Cardinals Lay Plans To Hold Game Ball At Local Golf Club 
### 
At a late hour last night selection
of a well-known band for the Big
Game Dance had not yet been an
nounced, although consideration had
narrowed to either Pinky Tomlin
or Jimmy Grier, and a definite deci
sion is expected by noon today.
Pending last-minute word from
Dance Chairman Gordy Nicoll, who
spent most of yesterday and last eve

with Los Angeles and San Francisco
agents, Cardinals laid definite plans
for the dance at a meeting early in
the evening.
Cardinals, who have been placed
in charge of arrangements for the
affair following approval by Execu

setting the hours from 10 to 2 o'clock
for the dance, which will definitely
be held at the Millbrae Country
Club in San Bruno.
No decision was made as to whe
ther the dance would be formal or
semi-formal. "Cal students will be
welcomed at the dance if escorted
or accompanied by a Stanford stu
dent, but otherwise they will not be
allowed," stated Ken Koch, Cardi
nals chairman.
One of the few A.S.S.U. dances
ever allowed to be held off-campus,
the aim of students in charge of the
affair is "to establish a tradition to
be carried from year to year; and
we figure this is as good a year as
any to start it," added Koch. Origi
nal purpose of the dance, suggested
by Daily Editor Larry Livingston,
was to provide entertainment for
Stanford students exclusively, who
don't want the expense of going to
the City on Big Game night.
Bids will be placed on sale at an
early date both in the A.S.S.U. of
fice and by representatives in living
groups and eating clubs. Results of
polls in these places found .students
favoring the idea to the extent of
approximately 30 per cent on the
