# Valley Cotton Farmers Battle Strike Pickets, Autumn Rains
## Growers Unwilling to Recognize Union as Wage War Continues 
### 
FRESNO, Oct. 25 (UP). â€”California cotton farmers, battling against
strike pickets and autumn rains in cllorts to get their crops harvested
on time, indicated tonight they would not compromise with the strikers
at $1 a hundredweight wage scale for cotton picking.
The $1 rate, suggested by Luke Ilinman, Bakersfield, state field director

of the CIO United Cannery, Agri-,
cultural, Packing and Allied Work
ers of America in the six-county
strike, was about midway between
the $1.25 scale asked by the
UCAPAWA and the 80-85-00 cent
rate paid by the farmers.
The first reaction to the Ilinman
proposal came from Madera County,
center of frequent disturbances, ar
rests and fights last week, and the
answer to the informal proposal
was "no."
It was not an offer made in col
lective bargaining for the farmers
thus far have refused to recognize
the UCAPAWA in the situation.
The entire area was quiet as pick
ing by field workers and picketing
by the strikers, many of them over
all-clad "Okies" from the Midwest
dust bowl, resumed at noon. An
earlier start was impossible because
of moisture in the fields. Farmers
wait until the cotton has dried out
because they pay by the pound and
dew - laden cotton pushes the
weighing scales far down.
