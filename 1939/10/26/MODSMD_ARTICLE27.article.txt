# Hulme Draws Record Crowd At Lunch Club
## 
### 
Over 100 guests crowded the Ni- [
tery yesterday when Dr. Edward !
Maslin Hulme, professor emeritus of j
history, addressed Luncheon Club;
on "Are We Moving into Another j
Middle Ages?"
Dr. Hulme reached the conclusion j
that civilization is moving away j
from the Middle Ages, rather than ,
back to them, after reviewing the j
many differences between life then j
and now. He cited the differences in j
transportation, asking, "Can you i
imagine a Stanford student going up '
and down Palm Drive in an ox j
cart?"
He continued: "Tomorrow, what J
will it be? A repetition of the Mid
dle Ages? No, 1 think it will be a
glorious tomorrow. The tomorrow |
we make it. A tomorrow of free
dom, of justice, here and now in ]
this life."
After Dr. Hulme concluded his!
speech there was reminiscing among j
students who had taken his history
courses and who recalled the bril- i
liance of his lectures. Those newer j
to Stanford voiced their regret that !
he is no longer an active member of i
the faculty.
As one departing guest put it, |
"Gosh, I wish he were still teach- J
ing!"
