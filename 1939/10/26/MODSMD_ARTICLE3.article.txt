## Release of German Sailors Spurs Demand Vessel Be Returned 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 (CP). —
The Slate Department announced
tonight that the Soviet Foreign
Office lias assured Ambassador
Lawrence Steinhardt that the 41
officers and crew members of the
captured freighter City of Flint
arc safe at Murmansk, near the
Bay of Kola.
The City of Flint's crew is
aboard the vessel, the American
envoy was told by a foreign of -
fice spokesman.
The State Department said no
further word had been heard from
Steinhardt regarding the crew.
MOSCOW, Thursday, Oct. 26 (UP).
—The Soviet government announced
early today that the American
freighter City of Flint, captured by
a German warship and brought into
the Russian port of Murmansk, is
being held "for the time-being" un
til her cargo is thoroughly examined.
The announcement said that the
German prize crew of 18* men,
which brought, the captured vessel
into Murmansk with the Nazi swas
tika flying from her mast, had been
released from internment by port
authorities.
There was no disclosure, however,
regarding Capt. Joseph L. Gainard
and his American crew of 40 men
from whom the 4,963-ton ship was
seized as a contraband carrier in the
Atlantic last week by a German
warship.
GERMANS RELEASE
It was announced that the German
crew was released—supposedly after
representations by the German gov
ernment —because it was found that
the Germans merely had brought the
American merchantman into a Rus
sian port for repairs to her ma
chinery.
The United States embassy had
received no reply of any kind early
today to its inquiries as to the
whereabouts of Captain Gainard and
his crew.
It was reported without confirma
tion that they still were aboard the
City of Flint, interned by Soviet
port authorities as the German prize
crew had been.
The official Tass Agency said that
"for the time being the steamer re
mains at Murmansk for precise veri
fication as to the composition of her
cargo."
This indicated that the Russian
government, a neutral nation but in
close collaboration with Germany,
was uncertain as to what disposi
tion should be made of the City of
Flint's cargo, held by the Germans
to be contraband of war destined for
British ports.
VESSEL TO BE FREED
American quarters in Moscow
were convinced that the vessel and
its American crew would be re
leased shortly.
The City of Flint was taken to
Murmansk, big Russian port on Kola
Bay in the arctic, from Tromsoe,
Norway, after being seized in the
Atlantic by a Nazi warship variously
identified as the cruiser Emden and
the pocket battleship Deutschland.
"According to a report from Mur
mansk," said the Tass announce
ment, "the internment of the Ger
man crew of the City of Flint, has
been cancelled by marine authorities
at Murmansk since it. has been as
certained that the steamer was
brought into the port for repairs to
I her machines. For the time being
the steamer remains at Murmansk
for percise verification as to the com
position of her cargo."
It was assumed that the German
government, in negotiations with the
Soviet government, had objected to
any release of the City of Flint's
cargo.
All efforts to reach Murmansk by
telephone were unavailing. Port au
thorities there refused to accept
calls except official messages from
Moscow.
Murmansk is inside the forbidden
northern frontier zone, in which
travel by foreigners is banned. As
a result, it was not believed here
that any information regarding the
City of Flint's crew would be ob
tainable until after they are re
| leased.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 (CP). —
The Slate Department announced
tonight that the Soviet Foreign
Office lias assured Ambassador
Lawrence Steinhardt that the 41
officers and crew members of the
captured freighter City of Flint
arc safe at Murmansk, near the
Bay of Kola.
The City of Flint's crew is
aboard the vessel, the American
envoy was told by a foreign of -

The State Department said no
further word had been heard from
Steinhardt regarding the crew.
MOSCOW, Thursday, Oct. 26 (UP).
—The Soviet government announced
early today that the American
freighter City of Flint, captured by
a German warship and brought into
the Russian port of Murmansk, is
being held "for the time-being" un
til her cargo is thoroughly examined.
The announcement said that the
German prize crew of 18* men,
which brought, the captured vessel
into Murmansk with the Nazi swas
tika flying from her mast, had been
released from internment by port
authorities.
There was no disclosure, however,
regarding Capt. Joseph L. Gainard
and his American crew of 40 men
from whom the 4,963-ton ship was
seized as a contraband carrier in the
Atlantic last week by a German
warship.
GERMANS RELEASE
It was announced that the German
crew was released—supposedly after
representations by the German gov
ernment —because it was found that
the Germans merely had brought the
American merchantman into a Rus
sian port for repairs to her ma
chinery.
The United States embassy had
received no reply of any kind early
today to its inquiries as to the
whereabouts of Captain Gainard and
his crew.
It was reported without confirma
tion that they still were aboard the
City of Flint, interned by Soviet
port authorities as the German prize
crew had been.
The official Tass Agency said that
"for the time being the steamer re
mains at Murmansk for precise veri
fication as to the composition of her
cargo."
