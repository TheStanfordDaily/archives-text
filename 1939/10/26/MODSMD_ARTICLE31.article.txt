announced her escape when it was '
reported surprised attendants at the
asylum shook the "dummy" in Mrs. i
Judd's bed and found she was gone. |

trolmen were informed of the escape j
of Arizona's most famous prisoner |

and desert roads. State border sta- |
tions were especially warned to look '
for the murderess.
