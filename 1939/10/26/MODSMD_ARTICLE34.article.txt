## San Jose State Nips Card Soccermen, 2-1, In Last-minute Score Indian forwards Fail to Cash In On Dozen Scoring Opportunities; Chris Sontum Makes Lone Tally 
### JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor 
Bearing the brunt of the attack, the
defensive backs held off numerous
Spartan attacks and fed well to their
forwards.
After Stanford had knotted the
count 1-1 in the fourth quarter, the
Staters came back with less than
two minutes of play and in almost
total darkness to slip a shot past
Goalie Tito Sanz-Agero, who had
warded off several sure-points with
his heads-up playing.
BRILLIANT SCORE
San Jose scored first in the open
ing period when a corner kick from
the sidelines parallel with the goal
line was headed into the net on a
brilliant diving attempt by Rochi
who butted the ball with his head.
Before the Spartans scored, however,
the lack of cohesion on the part of
the Indian forwards cost them four
or five goals.
Inspired play in the fourth quarter
put the Cards back in the ball game
when Chris Contum kicked an easy
one into the net. Then a short rush
downfield by San Jose in the last
minutes defeated the club.
CARDS OUTPLAYED
The game was a complete reversal
of form by Stanford's forwards who
were beaten to the ball continually
by the flashy state defense. At the
same time instead of the smart pass
ing they showed in their past
three games, the forwards were
caught time and again with the ball
and thus would subsequently lose
control.
Play of Ken Cuthbertson, Captain
Bill Hamilton, Goalie Sanz-Agero,
Grayson Bryan, and Wilson Clark
on defense was outstanding. How
ever, Bill Edwards, who saw the
game from the sidelines because of
a cold, was missed in the line-up.
MISS PENALTY KICK
Twice the Indians had chances to
put in penalty kicks from 15 yards
out and directly in front of the goal
net, but the pressure was too great
and both boots by Cuthbertson and
Rogers were off.
Coach Harry Maloney has a week
to get the team back into working
order before resuming conference
play. The club may meet U.C.L.A.
Saturday afternoon here, provided
Coach Maloney hears from the
Southerners soon. Otherwise it will
be a quiet week-end. The next
game will be with U.S.F. on Nov. 4.

Any idea Stanford's varsity soccer club may have had of going through
the season undefeated went the way of all dreams yesterday when San
Jose State's eleven nosed out the Cards, 2 to 1.
Outplayed on the front line where they had been exceptionally domi
nant in past games, the Indians lost no less than a do/en chances to score.
