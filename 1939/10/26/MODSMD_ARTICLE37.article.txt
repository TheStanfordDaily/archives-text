CORRESPONDENCE FROM
NORTHERN AGENT "X"
Slants received a letter recently
from Seattle, in which was enclosed
j a clipping of an article written for
the Seattle Times by George Var
nell, associate editor of that paper
and one of the leading football offi
i cials in the country.
Mr. Bill McClintock, the sender
i ol the clipping, says that "it is a
| sincere tribute an done (hat 1 have
not seen many of. I saw the game
and certainly endorse the article."
I Said the article:
"The wolves may be on Tiny
| Thornhill, Stanford football coach,
' but from what your correspondent
i saw on the field of action last Satur
i day in Portland during the Stanford
! Oregon football game, the players of
j the Indian squad are very much FOR
j their coach.
"In my capacity as an official in
I that game it was necessary, time
after time, to conie in close con
tact with the Stanford players on
, the field and, if ever I saw play
j ers fighting to bring the bacon
home for thcii* coach, the Stanford
players were doing just that.
"The spirit of the team was ex
! cellent and the morale apparently
! high. Conditions are not that way
{ when coach and players are not
j thinking and working along the
I same line."
HUSKIES NOT SO HAD
AS CRACKED UP TO HE
Washington's Huskies have lost
I four straight football games. They've
! played only four games. On the
, face of things Stanford should cut
! down the northerners Saturday like
| a harvester going through a grain
: field.
But. we're secretly a leetle bit
a-feared of them thar Huskies.
Slants thinks Stanford will win;
that the Indians should win. Rut
tnose Washingtonians arc coining
! fast.
Take a look at their conference
record. U.C.L.A. beat them 14-7,
but had to overcome a 7-0 lead to
do it. And even then the Bruins
might never have made the grade
; if it hadn't been for a sensational
| 64-j ard runback of a punt by
Jackie Robinson which put the
U C.L.A. team in position to score
its winning touchdown.
The following week the Huskies
marched up and down the held
j against Washington State, only to
I lose 6-0 on a quick scoring thrust
I by the Cougars.
Then last week Washington
completely outplayed Oregon State,
lie only undefeated and untied
team left in the Coast Conference,
but finally lost
j Ofi the records Ihe Huskies look

Take a look at their conference

do it. And even then the Bruins
might never have made the grade

Jackie Robinson which put the
U C.L.A. team in position to score
its winning touchdown.
The following week the Huskies
marched up and down the held

Then last week Washington
completely outplayed Oregon State,

team left in the Coast Conference,

not seen many of. I saw the game
and certainly endorse the article."
I Said the article:
"The wolves may be on Tiny
