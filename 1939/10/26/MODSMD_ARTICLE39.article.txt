CORVALLIS. Ore., Oct. 25 (UP).—
Place kicking drills featured today's
practice session in the Oregon State
College grid camp as Coach Lon
Stiner moved to prevent the possi
bility of a one-point loss in the
Beaver's game Saturday with Wash
ington State.
Stiner indicated he planned no new
plays for the tilt, which the Orange
is expected to take in stride—and
hoped to gain victory through pass
ing rather than power.
