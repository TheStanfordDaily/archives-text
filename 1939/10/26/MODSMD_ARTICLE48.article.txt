A severe blow will bo dealt to
Coach Harry Shipkey's freshman
football team's offense il the ankle
that little A1 Cole twisted in yes
terday's practice scrimmage keeps
him from Saturday's contest with
U.C.L.A.'s frosh.
Little A1 is a real triple* threat for
the Papooses and operated either
from fullback or half. However, it
is still doubtful whether Cole will
be able to perform Saturday or not
and the decision depends on the
soreness of the turned joint today.
If Cole is not able to play, the
yearlings will be only a shadow of
the team that started the season, for
Eric Armstrong, the other first
string half will also be on the bench.
In the ease both boys are unable to
play, Bob Greening, who flashed
against Fullerton, will take over the
left half post and Red Robinson will
run from the right half spot.
Yesterday the frosh scrimmaged
against Ucla's running and pass plays
and also unlimbered some of its own
offensive weapons. With Cole on
the shelf, Milt Vucinich took over
the passing assignments.
