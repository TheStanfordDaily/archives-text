# The 						Least We Can Do ...

T NTERVIEWED early this quarter, Professor
1 Bernard F. Haley of the economics depart
ment, one of the three outstanding authorities
on the subject, regretfully predicted that the
"Ham and Eggs" plan will pass in the Nov. 7
election.
However, since the day he made that state
ment a great many votes have flowed under the
bridge.
Opposition to the "S3O Every Thursday" at
that time was sufficiently intelligent, but not at
all active enough. Thinking citizens knew that
the proposal meant economic disaster to the
state, but they seemed to lack the ambition to
do anything about it.
Either because they were slow in overcoming
personal inertia or because they were using the
strategy of the delayed attack, the anti-"Ham
and Eggs" forces did not swing into action until
about three weeks ago. But once under way,
their campaign has been an effective one.
Citizens' committees and chambers of com
merce have plastered the state with posters and
handbills opposing the Retirement Life Pay
ments Amendment. Prestige groups like the
Commonwealth Club of California and the eco
nomics faculties of the ten leading universities
of the state, including Stanford, have issued
statements condemning the measure. And
newspaper and magazine publishers are* con
ducting a powerful crusade.
Right here on the Stanford campus the Book
store is distributing form letters which can be
used conveniently by students to apply for ab
sentee ballots. And all Palo Alto notaries public
have volunteered to place their seals on these
votes free of charge.
With all these forces throughout the state de
voting their energies to the campaign, the very
least that the Stanford student who has reached
his majority can do is to cast his vote against
"Ham and Eggs" in the coming election.
If he is registered in Palo Alto, it is simply a
question of dropping in at the proper precinct
poll on Nov. 7. If the student is registered in
his home town, the procedure is only slightly
more complicated:
(1) On or before Thursday, Nov. 2, he must
pick up an application form at the Bookstore or
write his own letter to the Registrar or County
Clerk of the locality in which he is registered,
applying for an absentee ballot.
(2) On or before Tuesday, Nov. 7, he must
cast his vote on this ballot, have it notarized free
of charge in Palo Alto, and return it to the
Registrar or County Clerk.
That's all there is to it.
Considering the disastrous effects that the
.vuccess of "S3O Every Thursday" would have
on the University, as well as his own family
<?nd the entire state, this does not seem too
much to ask of any Stanford student.
