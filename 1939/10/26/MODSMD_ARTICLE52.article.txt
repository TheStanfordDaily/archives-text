# Licking Their Chops
## 
### 
THE Farm rocters are hungry for blood. Since
Tiny and his men showed what they could do
for Stanford in the U.C.L.A. game of two long
weeks ago, the students have been thirsty
But the lean week-end last week, and the va
garies of the Pacific Coast Conference al
mighties, will keep rooters hungry until the first

Saturday in November, for this week's game
again is to be held on foreign turf.
The only opportunity rooters will have to
stave off their appetite will be at a send-off rally
this afternoon at 3 o'clock when the teim en
trains for Seattle. It is going to take on some
mis-named Huskies up north; a poor substitute
for a full meal, but still better than nothing.
Perhaps if the send-off is big enough, the
squad will bring back a few leftovers for us to
gnaw on.
Anyway, for the second time this year we've
got to make so much noise as the train pulls
out that the football squad will not be able to
forget what university they're from and who
they're really working for.
The rally this time will start way up the Row
and will parade in automobiles down to the
station, giving plenty of time to work up lots
of blood and thunder spirit before the varsity
shows up.
The band will be there, and yell leaders, and
rooters' caps—it will be almost like a game,
almost.
So, take your car up by the Fiji house this
afternoon before 2:3o—and drive carefully.—
