### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
ALL THIS AND GUM-CHEWERS TOO
IT DOES not take a Dies Committee to realize that
the world is wracked with social upheaval. And
perhaps it is a little incongruous, while French seventy
fives shell the Siegfried Line, to mention one of the
nation's ills merely involving the jaw muscles, chew
ing gum, standards of aesthetics, the ears, and the nerv
ous system. But gum-chewing can really be a major
psychological crisis to anyone who has sat next, to
some sweet young thing who chews with a vigor that
puts to shame rivet machines and steam-driven jack
hammers.
Few people object to the biologically-wasteful
mastication of gum in itself. Chewing movements may
not be particularly beautiful, but they are appropriate
at certain times. A cow, for instance, must chew her
cud as a matter of digestion. Forest rangers chew to
bacco because they can't risk starting a fire by smok
ing. And in the wide open spaces, or even just in the
open air, conservative gum-chewing is not really a
socially menace.
But the imitation of cows and forest rangers in
direct competition with a lecture can hardly be called
the essence of delicacy. After all, the person whose
eyes and ears are being offended by the chewer is
trapped at a lecture. There he sits, as helpless as a
ly in his torturer's web. The same may be said of
theaters, dances, and any number of public places—
none of which are sacred to an audacious lady with
a swivel-jaw.
* * * #
|>EKHAPS it is old-fashioned and illusory to think
of women as having refinement. But to the out
ward signs of refinement, at least, the male mind
should permitted to cling. And what can spoil the
veneer of good manners faster than being unable to
escape from those powerful, half-circular, open-mouth
ed, crackly motions that characterize the Wrigley
wrigglers? One can turn his eyes away. But the
ears are as inescapably attuned to the custion pump
style of chewing as they are to cement-mixers. A cow
pulling its foot out of the mud sixty times a minute
has nothing on the more athletic jaw-gymnasts. And
everyone knows that sensible cows do not aggravate
their listeners to such gargantuan extents.
There will probably not. be a campus crusade against
raucus gum-chewing. No modern Carrie Nation will
30 around snatching gum out of people's mouths and
pockets. The lack of such fanatical campaigning may
tx? a tribute to democracy, but it is certainly a sad
commentary on the future of the non-chewing public's
nerves. As though our noisy, urban, machine age is
not enough, fate has to send gum-cliewers to raise the
;wentieth century's percentage of neurotics! Oh lock
jaw, where is thy sting?

veneer of good manners faster than being unable to
escape from those powerful, half-circular, open-mouth
ed, crackly motions that characterize the Wrigley
wrigglers? One can turn his eyes away. But the
ears are as inescapably attuned to the custion pump
style of chewing as they are to cement-mixers. A cow
pulling its foot out of the mud sixty times a minute
has nothing on the more athletic jaw-gymnasts. And
everyone knows that sensible cows do not aggravate
their listeners to such gargantuan extents.
There will probably not. be a campus crusade against
raucus gum-chewing. No modern Carrie Nation will
30 around snatching gum out of people's mouths and
pockets. The lack of such fanatical campaigning may
tx? a tribute to democracy, but it is certainly a sad
commentary on the future of the non-chewing public's
nerves. As though our noisy, urban, machine age is
not enough, fate has to send gum-cliewers to raise the
;wentieth century's percentage of neurotics! Oh lock
jaw, where is thy sting?
ALL THIS AND GUM-CHEWERS TOO
IT DOES not take a Dies Committee to realize that
the world is wracked with social upheaval. And
perhaps it is a little incongruous, while French seventy
fives shell the Siegfried Line, to mention one of the
nation's ills merely involving the jaw muscles, chew
ing gum, standards of aesthetics, the ears, and the nerv
ous system. But gum-chewing can really be a major
psychological crisis to anyone who has sat next, to
some sweet young thing who chews with a vigor that
puts to shame rivet machines and steam-driven jack
hammers.
Few people object to the biologically-wasteful
mastication of gum in itself. Chewing movements may
not be particularly beautiful, but they are appropriate
at certain times. A cow, for instance, must chew her
cud as a matter of digestion. Forest rangers chew to
bacco because they can't risk starting a fire by smok
ing. And in the wide open spaces, or even just in the
open air, conservative gum-chewing is not really a
socially menace.
But the imitation of cows and forest rangers in
direct competition with a lecture can hardly be called
the essence of delicacy. After all, the person whose
eyes and ears are being offended by the chewer is
trapped at a lecture. There he sits, as helpless as a
ly in his torturer's web. The same may be said of
theaters, dances, and any number of public places—
none of which are sacred to an audacious lady with
a swivel-jaw.
