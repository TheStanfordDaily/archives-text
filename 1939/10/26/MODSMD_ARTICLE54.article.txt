DEMOCRACY IN LIMBO

r JpHE EDITOR, SIR:
During the last few weeks, I have noticed several
news items which seem to me to be of great import
ance. The speech of Senator Bob LaFollette to the
Senate is one of these. Parts of it are as follows:
"Not in Manchuria, nor Ethiopia, nor Spain, did the
British or French governments, whose democracy we
are expected to support, show the slightest intent to
carry out the tenets of democracy. Then came Munich.
Democratic Czechoslovakia pledged protection by
France, was betrayed by them into Hitler's clutches.
"And what of Spain? The British and French hid
behind the futile non-intervention committee sitting
in London, while Germany and Italy openly supplied
arms and men to Franco.
"Suppose England and France decide they want
to strengthen Germany at Russia's expense; is it so
necessary for us to have the British Empire preserved
that we must be willing to defend it whenever and
on whatever terms it chooses to fight?

"HPHE Indian National Congress made the following
demands on the British Empire:
"1. That India's resources be not used by the im
perialists for this war.
"2. That India be given its freedom.
"3. That Britain grant democracy to India's op
pressed .150.000.000.
"4. That India be given self-determination.
"5. That India be given a constituent assembly,
with policy to be determined by the Indian people.
"6. That the British imperialists PUBLISH THEIR
WAR AIMS." (emphasis mine)
These legitimate demands were rejected.
Jewarharl Nehru, leader of the Indian National Con
gress, answered: "They have spurned the hand we
stretched out. They have made it clear that they fight
to preserve and entrench the empire and imperialism.
IF THIS IS THE BRITISH EMPIRE'S WAR AIM
INDIA CAN BE NO PARTY TO KEEP HERSELF
AND OTHERS IN BONDAGE." (emphasis mine)
I also noticed that at the AFL convention in Cin
cinnatti, Mayor LaGuardia told the convention that
the people were not consulted about, the start of the
war and would not be consulted about its end.
I am writing thus because I did not see these
statements in ANY big newspaper. I hope that I am
wrong, because if not it certainly would seem as if t
someone was trying to drag us into war.
Yours, for Peace and Democracy,
Dick Cecil
