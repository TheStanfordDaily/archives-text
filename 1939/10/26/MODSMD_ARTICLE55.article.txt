# 'Quiet on Western Front' Still Makes Peace Appeal
## 
### 
"All Quiet on the Western Front"
is not dated. The brutal, stomach
paralyzing facts of the last World
War are as timely now as they were
when Erich Remarque wrote his
bloody indictment of mass-murder.
Some of the scenes were badly di
rected; it is an old picture. Some of
the scenes miss fire because they
are too obviously sentimental. But
the great nerve-message of the pic
ture carries.
In fact, the picture itself, despite
its flaws, is so powerful that the
revival producers only succeeded in
dulling its effects by dubbing in the
March-of-Time-like voice that in
sulted the audience's intelligence by
constantly reminding it that the
world is beginning a mad repetition
of 1914.
NEWSREEL SHOTS ADDED
More than that, the commentator
and the newsreel shots, which show
ed Adolph Hitler and modern armies,
partially turned the attention of the
audience from the theme of peace.
Pail of the resentment against wax
was turned against Hitler.
All that the producers succeeded in
doing by their additions to the orig
inal was to make their offering
"timely." The Western Front in
1914 was timely enough. That got
across the emotional appeal for
peace. The Hollywood gew-gaws
only detracted.
AYRES SENTIMENTAL
Lew Ayres, as the epitome of
youth's sacrifice to shells, played
his part sentimentally, but in situa
tions that made any honest person
admit to himself that he telt, like cry
ing anyhow.
Louis Wolheim, an actor no longer
seen on the screen, was the standout.
He and his ''pug nose" made the
role of tough-good-hearted corporal
intensely emotional, but again in a
way that drove home the point.
John Wray, as the officious, cruel
training officer, looked a little like
a melodrama villain, but even he
succeeded in thoroughly engender
ing hate for war. "Slim" Summer

ville played his usual half-humor
ous, half-sentimental part well.
From an abstract standard of
drama all kinds of criticisms can be
leveled at the story and at the act
ors. But "All Quiet on the Western
Front" cannot be judged on its ab
stract dramatic worth. It is plainly
propaganda, but propaganda which
is against war. And hence its worth
must be judged upon its effective
ness. On that score, it was when it
came out and still is a magnificent
work. Only the announcer was a
drawback, along with his "timely"
newsreels.
We can talk against war, and read
against it. But seeing it is more ef
fective. Next to seeing war itself is
"All Quiet on the Western Front."
Everyone should see it, with a view
to ignoring the newsreels. â€” Mellin
