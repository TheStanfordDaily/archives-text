ITOOD-COAT IDEA THAT
IS ONE FOR Tl IE BOOKS!
'I hanks, "Life Magazine"! It's a hum
dinger of an idea . . . bagging books in
the hood of a coat! The coat's a love
too! Natural camel's hair-and-wool with
a gay-flannel lined hood that zips off in
a jiffy turning it into a classic ... leather
buttoned up under your chin! 9 to 17.
