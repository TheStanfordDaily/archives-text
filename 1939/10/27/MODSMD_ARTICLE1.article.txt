### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
SOMETHING Joachim Von Rib-
K / 11
bentrop said in 1930 came back
yesterday to plague him.
When he first was named German
ambassador to England he described
Communism as "this most terrible of
all diseases, terrible because people
generally seem to realize its danger
only when too late."
And it was Neville Chamberlain
who, with cutting sarcasm that drew
shouts of laughter from the House
of Commons, called Ribbentrop's dia
tribe to the attention of the world.
Contrasting his 1936 beliefs with
his 1939 Danzig speech, Chamber
lain said, "lie desires Communism
and seems to invite the Soviet Un
ion to join a crusade against the
British Empire. What a change is
here."
s»t
"What a change" is right.
But last night Ribbentrop perhaps
didn't realize how true his 1936
statement is, in regard to current
Russo-German relations. With amaz
ing subtlety, with deft skill, the So
viet chieftains nuzzled their nation
into the key spot in a continent gone
war-mad. The lightning trade treaty
with Germany, concluded under the
astonished noses of France and Eng
land, and the equally swift non-ag
gression, mutual-consultation pact
I hat followed a week later, left Mos
cow the capital of the world.

To the Kremlin, at Stalin's bid
ding, came the foreign ministers
and delegates of little Lithuania, Lat
via, Estonia and, more recently, Fin
land. Air-tight, solid buffer mutual
assistance deals threw up an im
penetrable wall between Russia and
her supposed ally, Germany.

And, this week, the London
News Chronicle intimated that
Russia may be considering an ul
timatum to Rumania, a new land
grab in Sweden. If Molotov can
finesse these latest deals, Russia
will be protected from all aggres
sor nations. And Molotov's only
defeat, to date, is Turkey's swing
to the Allied cause. Her south
ern border and the vital Darda
nelles are the only points that ag
gressors can strike at (he Russian
Rear. Otherwise the Soviets are
invulnerable.
And Germany is out on the pro
verbial limb. Russia can saw off
that limb if she wants to.
Communism is terrible, Ribben
trop said, "because people generally
seem to realize its danger only when
too late."

jVfEANWHILE, the British Parlia
ment saw both Viscount Hali
fax and Chamberlain extend friend
ly gestures toward the Soviets, par
ticularly in justification of their in
vasion of Poland, the primary Rus
sian move to insure its own security.
Halifax, describing the Soviet seiz
ure of Polish territory as a defens
ive measure against German expan
sion, told the House of Lords that
Britain is studying the possibility of
increasing Anglo-Soviet trade on a
barter basis.
<■ * *
Churchill simply reiterated Hali
fax's statements, adding that the
Russians had no other choice than
to protect themselves against the
Nazis.
And Hitler sat in Berlin and wor
ried.
Chamberlain's summation of the
war's progress included a quick
reference to the "growing lawless
ness'' of the U-boat campaign. He
said the enemy lost 33,000 tons of
merchant shipping last week as com
pared to the loss of five British ships
with a total tonnage of 22,715. Chalk
up a 10,285-ton margin for the Eng
lish.
Terming the Allies' treaty with
Turkey the "outstanding event in
ioreign affairs since my last state
ment to the House," he called the al
liance "a purely defensive instru
ment, threatening no one and de
signed only to oppose resistance to
j. agression."
