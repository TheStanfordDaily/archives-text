# Last Minute Deal Signs Jimmy Grier Orchestra For Big Game Dance
## Confirmation at 10 o'clock Makes Final Attempt to Secure Name Band by Cardinals Successful 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Dramatic confirmation that Jimmy Grier's orchestra will play for Stan
ford's Biff Game Dance came through last night in an cleventh-honr
attempt to heal the 48-hour deadline set hy Ex Committee to obtain u
well known hand.
Just when chances of signing such an orchestra had been surrendered

>to a disappointing negative result,
i a last-minute telephone call came
through at 10 o'clock to Cardinals
Chairman pro-tern Gordy Nicoll
from Crier's San Francisco
Ames Bishop, to the effect that
Grier would play, making the widely
publicized dance a reality.
Climaxing frantic efforts on the
part of Nicoll and A.S.S.U. President
Ken Cuthbertson, the announcement
concluded negotiations in which the
two spent the better part of yester
day sending telegrams and making
telephone calls all over the West.
SIGNS AT PRICE LIMIT
Agents for Grier had demanded n
price in excess of the top price of
$500, stipulated by Ex Committee,
and held out for the higher price
during bickerings which lasted from
11 a.m. to 10 p.m. He was finally
signed at the stipulated price.
A total of 12 telegrams were sent
from the campus, two telephone
calls were made to British Colum
bia, where Grier is now playing,
and innumerable calls were made to
San Francisco and Los Angeles
agents during negotiations.
Hopes had been held high during
the day that Skinnay Ennis' band
could be secured, but the outfit is
going on tour in two or three
months, and the expense of a trip to
the Buy region for a one-night stand
was considered too great. Other
alternatives were the orchestras of
Pinky Tomlin or Ray Noble, but. it,
was found that both are signed to
play steady engagements in the
Southland.
ALMOST MISSEI)
At 5 o'clock yesterday, when
choice had narrowed to either Grier
or Ennis, Cuthbertson stated, "We
either have the dance with Grier or
Ennis or we don't have it." When
the 10 o'clock deadline had been
I reached and no agreement was yet
consummated, Cuthbertson and Stu
dent. Manager John Cobbs left Cuth
bertson's office, center of the activ
ity, and a few minutes later the call
came through to the effect that Grier
would play the dance, just in lime
to catch Nicoll and beat the deadline.
The dance, which it is hoped will
become an annual tradition, will be
held at the Millbrae Country Club
in San Bruno. Bids at $5 will go on
sale immediately in the A.S.S.U.
office, and by representatives on the
Kow, in living groups, and in eating
clubs. Arrangements for Millbrae
were made by Nicoll and Ruth Ide.
When contacted last night following
announcement that Grier had been
secured, Nicoll could only say, "My
fingernails are worn down to my
knuckles."
COUNTRY CLUB ADEQUATE
Price of the bid will include danc
ing, favors, decorations, and possibly
breakfast. Facilities at. Millbrae in
clude large banquet tables, dining
room, and two big rooms and a
patio for dancing. The largest club
on the Peninsula, Millbrae can ac
commodate 700 dancers. Hie dance
will be held from 10 to 2 o'clock,
and whether it will be formal or
semi-formal has not been decided.
The affair will be one of the few
A.S.S.U. dances ever held off
campus.

on the Peninsula, Millbrae can ac
commodate 700 dancers. Hie dance
will be held from 10 to 2 o'clock,
and whether it will be formal or
semi-formal has not been decided.
The affair will be one of the few
A.S.S.U. dances ever held off
campus.
Dramatic confirmation that Jimmy Grier's orchestra will play for Stan
ford's Biff Game Dance came through last night in an cleventh-honr
attempt to heal the 48-hour deadline set hy Ex Committee to obtain u
well known hand.
Just when chances of signing such an orchestra had been surrendered

>to a disappointing negative result,
i a last-minute telephone call came
through at 10 o'clock to Cardinals
Chairman pro-tern Gordy Nicoll
from Crier's San Francisco
Ames Bishop, to the effect that
Grier would play, making the widely
publicized dance a reality.
Climaxing frantic efforts on the
part of Nicoll and A.S.S.U. President
Ken Cuthbertson, the announcement
concluded negotiations in which the
two spent the better part of yester
day sending telegrams and making
telephone calls all over the West.
SIGNS AT PRICE LIMIT
Agents for Grier had demanded n
price in excess of the top price of
$500, stipulated by Ex Committee,
and held out for the higher price
during bickerings which lasted from
11 a.m. to 10 p.m. He was finally
signed at the stipulated price.
A total of 12 telegrams were sent
from the campus, two telephone
calls were made to British Colum
bia, where Grier is now playing,
and innumerable calls were made to
San Francisco and Los Angeles
agents during negotiations.
Hopes had been held high during
the day that Skinnay Ennis' band
could be secured, but the outfit is
going on tour in two or three
months, and the expense of a trip to
the Buy region for a one-night stand
was considered too great. Other
alternatives were the orchestras of
Pinky Tomlin or Ray Noble, but. it,
was found that both are signed to
play steady engagements in the
Southland.
ALMOST MISSEI)
At 5 o'clock yesterday, when
choice had narrowed to either Grier
or Ennis, Cuthbertson stated, "We
either have the dance with Grier or
Ennis or we don't have it." When
the 10 o'clock deadline had been
I reached and no agreement was yet
consummated, Cuthbertson and Stu
dent. Manager John Cobbs left Cuth
bertson's office, center of the activ
ity, and a few minutes later the call
came through to the effect that Grier
would play the dance, just in lime
to catch Nicoll and beat the deadline.
The dance, which it is hoped will
become an annual tradition, will be
held at the Millbrae Country Club
in San Bruno. Bids at $5 will go on
sale immediately in the A.S.S.U.
office, and by representatives on the
Kow, in living groups, and in eating
clubs. Arrangements for Millbrae
were made by Nicoll and Ruth Ide.
When contacted last night following
announcement that Grier had been
secured, Nicoll could only say, "My
fingernails are worn down to my
knuckles."
