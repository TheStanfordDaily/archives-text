# Captive Ship Ordered Off To Nazi Port
## Soviet Puts Steamer In Hands of Germans, Drops Responsibility 
### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 26 (UP).—Soviet
Russia tonight sought to sidestep a
controversy with the United States
by ordering the American steamer
City of Flint to sail "immediately"
from the port of Murmansk, re
portedly in charge of a German prize
crew which wil ltake it into a Nazi
port.
Soviet and American quarters de
nied flatly they had received any
information indicating that the
steamer already had sailed from
Murmansk under the American flag,
as reported abroad.
U.S. Ambassador Laurence A.
Steinhardt and members of his staff
waited far into the night for official
word from Soviet authorities but
none was forthcoming and the
whereabouts of the American crew
of the ship remained as obscure as
ever.
Germans in Moscow insisted, how
ever, that the ship had sailed al
ready—under ihe German flag.
SOVIETS DROP RESPONSIBILITY
The Soviets take the view that,
with release of the ship and orders
for it to leave Russian territorial
waters without delay, any further
protests must be adjudicated be
tween the United States and Ger
many.
The Sdviet government's order
for the immediate release of the
City of Flint, announced by radio
shortly before 10 p.m., did not re
veal the whereabouts of Capt. Jo
seph A. Gainard and his American
crew of 40 men.
German quarters in Moscow
said that the vessel would be handed
over to Germany—if it has not al
ready been given to her—despite a
formal demand by U.S. Secretary of
State Cordcll Hull that the Soviets
immediately restore the vessel to its
American owners and release Cap
tain Gainard and his crew.
AMERICANS SAFE
U.S. Ambassador Laurence A.
Steinhardt was assured by the So
viet Foreign Office that the Ameri
cans were "safe."
The Soviet announcement did not
reveal whether the vessel was sail
ing from Murmansk under the
American or the German flag, and
there was no means of obtaining
direct information from Murmansk,
a prohibited military zone.
Nor was it revealed whether the
German prize crew of 18 men, re
leased from internment yesterday by
the Soviets, would take along the
American crew.
SHIP TO DODGE ATTACK
German quarters in Moscow said
the City of Flint, under command of
the Germans, was expected to sail
to Germany through Norwegian and
Swedish territorial waters so far as
was possible, probably in an effort
to escape being attacked by British
warships.
A Soviet expert on international
law explained tonight that the City
of Flint incident is in no way con
trary to Russia's protest and chal
lenge of the British naval blockade,
announced last night, and that the
Soviet conception of proper contra
band blockade applies to Germany
as well as Britain.
The City of F lint, he explained,
was brought into Murmansk Mon
day by a German prize crew, with
the Nazi swastika flying from her
mast, as a German prize.
The Soviet Union, it was explain
ed, was not obliged to examine the
legality of Germany's seizure of the
ship but was bound to admit the
ship in Murmansk because she was
unseaworthy and required engine
repairs.
