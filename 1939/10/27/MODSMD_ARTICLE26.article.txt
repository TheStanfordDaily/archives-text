The year-long project has been
underwritten by 12 Pacific Coast
corporations. Initial contributions
amounting to $13,000 and pledges
sufficient to make up the $40,000
total have been announced by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Specific objectives of the research
are: to analyze the policy-forming
and administrative set-up of large
corporations, means of co-ordination
between departments, extent of
delegation of management authority,
means and methods of effecting con
trol and gauging results. They will
also determine organization and
effectiveness of staff functions, con
trol over the extent and cost of staff
and service department efforts, size
of the management organization, and
matters relating to the organization,
policies, and functions of the direc
tors, chief executive officers, and
management committees.

"This is one of the most worth
while research projects that has
ever been undertaken in the busi
ness field." Dean Jackson stated. "A
great deal of time has been given to
the analysis and study of the func
tions atid duties of line executives,
but little attention has been given
to the organization and responsi
bilities of the policy-forming and
top - administrative group in our
business organizations."
A confidential report on the find
ings of the investigation is to be
given to each of the score of lead
in; American corporations co-oper
ating in the study. A final report of
the research will probably be pub
lished.
