# Schleiper and Carroll Smash All-time Endurance Records
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20 (UP).â€” !
Clyde Schleiper and Wes Carroll ;
flew their tiny seaplane in circles {
above Rosamond Dry Lake tonight j
happy because:
At 2:42 p.m. today they broke the I
all-time endurance record for all J
types of airplanes.
With the record in their hands, j
they can come down next Sunday i
and end the weary flight.
Schleiper and Carroll took off 28
days ago from Marine Stadium at i
Long Beach and haven't touched the j
ground since. They spelled each j
other at the grind of piloting the j
light-model plane and slept in j
cramped quarters inside the fusilage. |
Several times daily they pulled up
gasoline on a rope from an auto- j
mobile speeding along on the dry |
lake bed beneath them.

Profits were sliin until today when
they broke the record, but now they J
will get $100 a day each from a ;
jewelry firm.
The flyers said they planned to '
come down again Sunday at 3 p.m. |
at Long Beach.
