# Grid Squad Guns for Huskies
## Card Eleven Seeks First Season Win Phelan's Men Booted To Conference Cellar In Three Disasters 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Determined to chalk up their first
Win of the season, 35 Indian gridders
will arrive in Seattle thia afternoon
for their game tomorrow against
Jimmy Phelan's Washington Hus
kies.
Cheered by a thousand Farm root
ers, the Indians left Palo Alto at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon. Thor
Peterson, second string fullback, was
left behind in the hospital with a
back injury that prevented him from
making the trip with the team.
Tiny Thornhill sent, the squad
through a light workout in sweat
clothes for over an hour earlier in
the afternoon. The session was de
voted to running through plays and
shaking out the kinks from Wed
nesday's scrimmage.
HUSKIES IN CELLAR
Phelan's battered Huskies are in I
the conference cellar because of
three defeats by coast teams. The !
Washington squad will also be gun- J
nine; for their first win of the year j
Saturday, and will have the advan- \
tage of playing on their own field j
before a homecoming crowd.
Opening their season on the wrong j
end of a 27-G score at the hands of |
Pitt's de-emphasized Panthers, the |
Huskies dropped decisions to U.C.- [
L.A., 14-7; to Washington State, 6-0.
and to Oregon State, 13-7.
At game time tomorrow afternoon
the Indians will probably be favored
by odds of at least 10-7. If rain 1
comes in Seattle, the odds against
Washington will be-even longer, as 1
the Huskies have planned to meet
the Indians with a passing attack.
A wet ball would forestall that and
} ive Stanford, with line-plunging
Norm Standlee, a definite advantage.
INJURIES HAUNT PIIELAN
The Huskies have been suffering
from an injury jinx similar to the
one that haunted the Farm last year.
Latest victim in the northern camp
is Walt Yonker, 220-pound first
string tackle, Yonker suffered a re
currence of an old knee injury yes
terday, and was declared out of the
game.
Taking Yonker's place at left
tackle will be Glen Conley, a sopho
more. Conley and Byng Nixon, first
.string right tackle, form what Phe- 1
lan has dubbed his "bird cage |
tackles." Both wear .special helmets i
to protect their glasses.
The Washington starting backfield [
will have Don Means at quarter,
triple-threat Dean McAdams at right
half, tricky-running Bill Gleason at
left half, and Don Jones at fullback.
TWO SOPHS TO START
Two members of the Washington
starting eleven will be sophomores: I
Ray Frankowski, left guard, who has j
been praised highly for his work i
so far this year, and Glen Conley at j
the vital left tackle spot.
Facing Frankowski at right guard I
in the Cardinal line will be Dave i
Patterson, also a sophomore. The
starting left half assignment in
Thornhill's backfield will go to either !
Frankie Albert or Pete Krnetovic,
both playing their first year of var- 1
sity ball.
Experts have forecast a passing j
duel, with Dean McAdams and j
Frankie Albert doing the chucking j
for their opposing teams. Albert
snapped out of a slump two weeks I
ago to fire two touchdown passes!
against the Bruins.
Before leaving Thornhill named I
Gene Coldiron, starting quarter, act- I
ing captain.

Tiny Thornhill sent, the squad
through a light workout in sweat
clothes for over an hour earlier in
the afternoon. The session was de
voted to running through plays and
shaking out the kinks from Wed
nesday's scrimmage.
HUSKIES IN CELLAR
Phelan's battered Huskies are in I
the conference cellar because of
three defeats by coast teams. The !
Washington squad will also be gun- J
nine; for their first win of the year j
Saturday, and will have the advan- \
tage of playing on their own field j
before a homecoming crowd.
Opening their season on the wrong j
end of a 27-G score at the hands of |
Pitt's de-emphasized Panthers, the |
Huskies dropped decisions to U.C.- [
L.A., 14-7; to Washington State, 6-0.
and to Oregon State, 13-7.
At game time tomorrow afternoon
the Indians will probably be favored
by odds of at least 10-7. If rain 1
comes in Seattle, the odds against
Washington will be-even longer, as 1
the Huskies have planned to meet
the Indians with a passing attack.
A wet ball would forestall that and
} ive Stanford, with line-plunging
Norm Standlee, a definite advantage.
INJURIES HAUNT PIIELAN
The Huskies have been suffering
from an injury jinx similar to the
one that haunted the Farm last year.
Latest victim in the northern camp
is Walt Yonker, 220-pound first
string tackle, Yonker suffered a re
currence of an old knee injury yes
terday, and was declared out of the
game.
Taking Yonker's place at left
tackle will be Glen Conley, a sopho
more. Conley and Byng Nixon, first
.string right tackle, form what Phe- 1
lan has dubbed his "bird cage |
tackles." Both wear .special helmets i
to protect their glasses.
The Washington starting backfield [
will have Don Means at quarter,
triple-threat Dean McAdams at right
half, tricky-running Bill Gleason at
left half, and Don Jones at fullback.
TWO SOPHS TO START
Two members of the Washington
starting eleven will be sophomores: I
Ray Frankowski, left guard, who has j
been praised highly for his work i
so far this year, and Glen Conley at j
the vital left tackle spot.
Facing Frankowski at right guard I
in the Cardinal line will be Dave i
Patterson, also a sophomore. The
starting left half assignment in
Thornhill's backfield will go to either !
Frankie Albert or Pete Krnetovic,
both playing their first year of var- 1
sity ball.
Experts have forecast a passing j
duel, with Dean McAdams and j
Frankie Albert doing the chucking j
for their opposing teams. Albert
snapped out of a slump two weeks I
ago to fire two touchdown passes!
against the Bruins.
Before leaving Thornhill named I
Gene Coldiron, starting quarter, act- I
ing captain.
Determined to chalk up their first
Win of the season, 35 Indian gridders
will arrive in Seattle thia afternoon
for their game tomorrow against
Jimmy Phelan's Washington Hus
kies.
Cheered by a thousand Farm root
ers, the Indians left Palo Alto at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon. Thor
Peterson, second string fullback, was
left behind in the hospital with a
back injury that prevented him from
making the trip with the team.
