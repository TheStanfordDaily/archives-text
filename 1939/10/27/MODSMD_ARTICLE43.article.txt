### JERRY MAYER 
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST—
BUT, ALAS, NO BEAUTY
Stanford's water poloists were
supposed to entertain both brawn
and beauty today in the Encina
tank, but at the last minute yester
day Coach Nort Thornton was in
formed that beauty would not be
able to appear.
Miss Helen Crlenkovich, just
about the nation's leading woman
diver, who was scheduled to give
an exhibition performance today to
augment the Stanford-U.S.C. water
polo game, is suffering from a cold
that, will keep her out of action.
That's a tough break for all
those handsome (that will he a
dime, please) water polo men who
were undoubtedly fighting it out
to see who would hold Miss Crlen
kovich's wrap while she was per
forming. In fact, I sort of thought
about it myself.
However, brawn will still be there.
Of course, we all would trade five
(maybe six) water polo teams for
the privilege of seeing the beauteous
Miss Crlenkovich perform her sym
phony of motion off the bounding
board, but just the same a sports
enthusiast hasn't really lived until
he's seen a water polo contest.
They are really exciting, and sup
porters of the aqua sport insist that
for roughness it makes la crosse or
football look like sissy sports. The
boys really play for keeps, and any
thing goes.
It's quite an experience to see
a water poloist ride an opponent
to the bottom of the pool—espe
cially if it's a Stanford man duck
ing a U.S.C. player. It really pro
vides quite an aesthetic pleasure
for us who like the better things
in life.
There isn't any reason why there
shouldn't be a capacity crowd today.
The men should glory in the action
of a typical water polo tilt, and the
women should glory in those gor
geous physiques the players propel
through the water.
As an added attraction, the men
patrons can ogle the women.

OI OLD LUCKY LOUIE
Lucky Louie came skating into
the Daily Shack yesterday on a cake
of soap, and immediately confused,
confounded, and mixed me up by
handing out his latest absolutely ex
clusive predictions on this week
end's football games.
"Look here, Louie," I glared, "you
picked Stanford to win. You know
darn well they never do when you
pick them."
Old L.L. gave me a knowing, sly
look.
"It's okay, boss. I made up for
that by betting on the Huskies.
The only time Stanford ever wins
is when you bet on (he other team
and give 10-1 odds. I made double

! sure we'd win—l gave 20-1 odds.''
L.L. pulled Stanford to a tie by !

lead the Indians to a victory by his I
j latest "blitzkrieg" maneuver. L.L. j

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST—
BUT, ALAS, NO BEAUTY
Stanford's water poloists were
supposed to entertain both brawn
and beauty today in the Encina
tank, but at the last minute yester
day Coach Nort Thornton was in
formed that beauty would not be
able to appear.
Miss Helen Crlenkovich, just
about the nation's leading woman
diver, who was scheduled to give
an exhibition performance today to
augment the Stanford-U.S.C. water
polo game, is suffering from a cold
that, will keep her out of action.
That's a tough break for all
those handsome (that will he a
dime, please) water polo men who
were undoubtedly fighting it out
to see who would hold Miss Crlen
kovich's wrap while she was per
forming. In fact, I sort of thought
about it myself.
However, brawn will still be there.
Of course, we all would trade five
(maybe six) water polo teams for
the privilege of seeing the beauteous
Miss Crlenkovich perform her sym
phony of motion off the bounding
board, but just the same a sports
enthusiast hasn't really lived until
he's seen a water polo contest.
They are really exciting, and sup
porters of the aqua sport insist that
for roughness it makes la crosse or
football look like sissy sports. The
boys really play for keeps, and any
thing goes.
It's quite an experience to see
a water poloist ride an opponent
to the bottom of the pool—espe
cially if it's a Stanford man duck
ing a U.S.C. player. It really pro
vides quite an aesthetic pleasure
for us who like the better things
in life.
There isn't any reason why there
shouldn't be a capacity crowd today.
The men should glory in the action
of a typical water polo tilt, and the
women should glory in those gor
geous physiques the players propel
through the water.
As an added attraction, the men
patrons can ogle the women.
