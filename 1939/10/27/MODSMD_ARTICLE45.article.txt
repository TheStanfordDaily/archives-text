### 
The weather man predicted rain
for tomorrow's Indian - l-ftisky
game in Seattle. A report from
Pullman, in the eastern section
of Washington, stated that the
Washington State Cougars had
been unable to practice yesterday
because of a snowstorm.
\ wet field would hinder the
cxpectcd Washington passing at
tack and increase the chances of
Tiny Tliornhill's Cardinal grid
ders to win their lirst game of
the season.
