# Loss of Backfield Aces Weakens Frosh Attack
## Papooses Still Expect Victory In Bruin Tilt 
### 
Stanford's freshman football team
should roll through U.C.L.A.'s in
vading Cubs in tomorrow's prelimi
nary, and if they do, two unknown
quantities must be realized to con
tribute to a Cardinal victory. Game
time is 2:15 tomorrow, and there is
no admission charge.
The first unknown quantity is
the effectiveness of the Papooses'
offense without the presence of either
Al Cole or Eric Armstrong. Cole's
injury of Wednesday turned out to
be a pulled tendon and has crippled
up the versatile little halfback pretty
badly. Though he may be able to
toss a few passes, Cole will not be
very effective.
Armstrong is still nursing the bat
tered knee he received against U.S.C.
Coach Harry Shipkey has given the
call to Red Robinson to take over
Cole's position at left half and this
means that Red must also take over
Cole's punt returning duties. At the
other halfback John Chimenti will
fill in for Armstrong . The chunky
little Italian really rolled from the
right half post against U.S.C.'s fresh
men and can be counted on for a
steady game tomorrow.
COLE WAS PASSER
Still Shipkey's backfield is bound
to miss the speed and deception of
these two injured stars, not to men
tion Cole's passing arm which has
thrown two touchdown passes in
each game this year.
This means that the main burden
of ground gaining will rest 011 the
husky shoulders of Mill Vucinich.
For Milt will do the passing for the
Frosh outfit, and, with the threat of
reverses ot speedy halfbacks greatly
handicapped, will probably do a lot
of ball carrying down the middle.
The other unknown quantity is the
ability of the Papoose pass defense to
choke the vaunted Cub air attack.
Against Cal's "dream" frosh team,
the Cubs from down south scored
through the air twice in about five
minutes. They have a dead-eyed
passer in little Joe Santana and have
plenty of pass plays* built around his
throwing arm.
NORBERG IS BACK
That long-awaited doctor's deci
sion concerning whether or not Hank
Norberg can play tomorrow finally
arrived and was in the affirmative.
Still, with three weeks of compara
tive inactivity behind him. Hank will
not be started and probably he and
his "iron mask" will see little action.
With Coach Bill Paulman perform
ing as the aforementioned Santana,
the lrosh got a big dose of Bruin
pass plays. And if the Bruin backs
pass with near the accuracy that
Paulman showed yesterday, then the
Cards are in for a rough afternoon.
A shift in the usual starting tackles
finds Roger Laverty getting the call
over hefty George Robinson. Laver
ty has been a comer all season with
his fine offensive play and has finally
beaten out the poorly conditioned
Robinson.
AIR CIRCUS EXPECTED
Tomorrow's game is sure to de
velop into a wild air circus for it is
the best means of attack for both
teams. But with a finer offensive
line, which enables the Cards to
throw in a few running plays, Stan
ford's freshmen should turn back the
invasion from the Southland.
The starting lineup as announced
by Coach Shipkey yesterday after
noon and subject to change is: Symes
and Stamm at ends; Laverty and
Bandueei at tackles; McCain and
Palmer at guards; Mannon at center;
Tayloi at quarterback; Chimenti and
Robinson at the halfback posts, and
Vucinich at fullback.
