## JERRY MAYER. Sports Editor Crack Trojan Waterpoloists To Invade Farm Pools Today Mormon to Clash in Encina Pools At 3:30; Crlenkovich Withdraws 
### 
i Touted as one of the finest Trojan teams of recent years, the University
of Southern California water paloi.-ts will invade the Farm today to battle
Coach Noi l Thornton's Indian hall tossers.
Game time is 3:3') o'clock, with a post-preliminary between the Stan
; ford iunior varsity and Fullerton J. C. slated to follow immediately.

► A last-minute telegram received
1 late yesterday by Thornton carried
. the information that Helen Crlen
kovich, national women's low board
diving champion, will be unable to
appear for her scheduled exhibition.
Miss Crlenkovich is suffering from
| a bad chest cold.
ALLEN PROBABLY OUT
The Cardinal mermen will enter
today's game against the Trojans
without the services of Bob Allen,
first-string centerback, unless a last
minute doctor's okay comes through.
He will be replaced by Duncan
Patty.
; Coach Thornton will otherwise
start his regular line-up of Capt.
Bob Plate, sprint; Bill Bleecker and
Dave Nottage, forwards; Ted More
no and Dick Hoover, guards; and
Frank Dowling, goalie.
The Indians enter the game with
! one conference defeat to no wins,
i both their victories having been
hung up in practice tilts. U.C.L.A.
conquered the Indians last Saturday,
5-3, in a close game which saw the
locals mess up their passing in a
desperate second period attempt to
| knot, the count.
; MERMEN OUTSTANDING
The defensive game displayed by
; the Indians—especially the work of
Goal Guard Dowling—was consider
-1 ed outstanding, but the Bruin guard
, staff tied up the offensive charges
| of the Stanford forwards.
U.S.C., usually strong in water
' polo circles, is not as good as
U.C.L.A. by comparative scores in
1 practice games, but claim they have
a "best team ever." The Trojans are
led by Paul Wolf, all-conference
sprint.

Today's program is one of two
1 week-end entertainments to be of
-1 fered at Encina Pool by Coach
