# Troy-Cal Clash Will Head Heavy Coast Grid Slate
## Conference reams Face Crucial Tests: Santa Clara Meets Purdue 
### 
ll's the Pacific Coast's first football jackpot of the season.
Two issues at the top and the bottom of the Coast Conference
one of this section's major gridiron rivalries and an intersectional
clash—that's the grid set-up to be settled tomorrow.

It will be the Coast's first
week-end. These games of major i
proportions will focus attention to
four fronts from Seattle to Los An
geles.
Here at the Farm, the cellar issue
al Seat'tle between our Indians and
Jimmy Phelan's Huskies will hold
the spotlight. Tiny Thornhill's im
proved Indians are twice defeated
but boast one tie. Washington,
though definitely proving that it ac
tually is one of the conference's
most dangerous teams, is still on the
red side of the ledger wtih four suc
cessive trimmings—the last two be
ing ol the heart-breaking variety.
TROJANS I ICiIT JINX
California's sophomores and its
"rocker shift" will be tested in the
real "major" encounter at Berkeley.
The once-tied Men of Troy have
roared ahead cilice the tie with Ore
gon and have defeated one confer
ence victim and an intersectional foe
since. Cal's oft-changing line-up
especial ly the backfield—will have
the advantage of the Memorial Sta
dium jinx that seems to haunt U.S.C.
— if that is to help them any.
Sharing the Bay spotlight will be
the Santa Clara - Purdue intersec
tional clash at Kezar Stadium. The
Boilermakers are one of the Big
Ten's best exponents of sound foot
ball, whereas the Broncos under
"Buck" Shaw are a very respected
grid team.
WLIiFEET PLAY IN L A.
While the Trojans are away from
the Coliseum, the Bruins will play
in Los Angeles. But it will probably
turn out to be hard work. "Tex"
Oliver's Oregon Webfoots are their
opponent j. Both are undefeated but
have ties to mar their conference
record.
Oregon lost a non-conference bat
tle last week to little Gonzaga but
its best forte is the 7-7 count at
Los Angeles a month ago against
S.C. The Uclans claim two major
conference victories and a non
conference rout of Montana.
BIG CROUDS PREDICTED
At least 150.000 fans are expected
to see these games, with the largest
crowd at Los Angeles, although the
two games in the Bay area will draw
around 75,000 altogether.
Oregon State, the only undefeated
and untied eleven on the Coast, has
Washington State to contend with at
Corvaliis. Outside the conference.
Santa Barbara State meets the Duel
DeGroot - Pop Warner San Jose
St-tte team. St. Mary's Galloping
Gaels test Portland at Kezar Sunday,

and U.S.F. has a breather against
Fresno State.
Best bets: Stanford, Southern Cal
ifornia, Santa Clara, Oregon, and
Oregon State,
