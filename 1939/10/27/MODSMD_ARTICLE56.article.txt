# Hostak Knocks Out Coates in Third
## 
### 
â– 
Al Hostak of Seattle, recognized as |
world's middleweight champion by j
the National Boxing Association, to- |
night knocked out Charlie "Killer"
Coates of Los Angeles in the third I
round of their scheduled 10-round |
non-title bout. It was Hostak's first j
appearance since he regained the |
title from Solly Krieger of Brooklyn |
last June.
The knockout came after two min- j
utes and 15 seconds of the third
round. Hostak weighed 160, Coates
IG6. The blow which polished off the
Los Angeles fighter was a right to
the jaw, but earlier pounding in the
second and third rounds had softened
Coates as Hostak drove him to the
ropes.
