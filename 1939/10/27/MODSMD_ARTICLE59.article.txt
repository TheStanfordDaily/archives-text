# It Can't Happen Here

IN spite of all that has been said on both sides
of the fence, there are still a few Stanford
ites who read Mr. Hearst's morning paper. And
those who do received a jolt along with their
orange juice yesterday when their eyes struck
a front page article telling of a sex expose that
was rocking the University of California cam
pus.
Shielded by anonymity, a group of mud
slinging Berkeley students published a pamph
let called the "Razzberry" packed with sensa
tional generalizations on the scandalous state
of campus morality and citing several specific
cases. The charges were obviously those of
smut-loving, adolescent minds, and many of
them were merely localized versions of thread
bare off-color jokes.
Reacting immediately, student leaders con
demned the yellow sheet as a disgrace, and the
Administration expressed its intention of ex
pelling the offenders if they could be caught.
But the damage was done.
Early yesterday morning the news was on
the wires, and in the afternoon editions even
the most conservative newspapers all over the
country carried stories on the scandal. The
University of California was wearing a particu
larly messy looking black eye.
Although a trifle shocked, Stanford students
generally feel guite unconcerned with the Ber
keley sensation. They think, and rightly too,
that such a thing ever happening here is highly
improbable.
And yet, the incident affords food for a little
thought.
Any student who acts publicly without care
fully considering whether he is helping or
harming his school is guilty of the grossest
type of disloyalty. Whether the situation be
one as flagrantly in bad taste or as ill-inten
tioned as the "Razzberry" or not is beside the
guestion.
Any man (or woman) who represents a uni
versity is morally bound to act io further its
best interests, no matter what his personal opin
ions and prejudices may be.
There are a few people at Stanford who need
to remember that.
