THE tumult and the shouting die, the captains
and the kings depart—
And Stanford is going to have a Big Game
dance.
After spending all day on the telephone dick
ering with agencies, which are the world's most
unbusinesslike organizations with the possible
exception of theatrical producers, Chairman
pro tem Gordy Nicoll finally was able to sign
an orchestra at the price and within the time
limit stipulated by Ex Committee.
When the A.S.S.U. signs the contracts for the
band and the clubhouse, it is making an in
vestment of over SI,OOO in the students. And
it is up to them to pay dividends.
Already knee-deep in debt because of the
Boathouse, and still standing in the shadow of
Memorial Hall, the Associated Students cannot
afford to take much of a chance. Ex Committee
decided to sponsor the dance because it thought
that the student body wanted it and was willing
to support it.
In addition to its being a real party for those
who attend it, it will be a real problem for those
who put it on. They must sell the dance to
Stanford—or the A.S.S.U. will suffer a terrific
loss.
There is no reason to think that the student
body will not flock to the affair. A beautiful
country club, a first-class orchestra, refresh
ments, and a reasonable price are all that any
one could ask.
It is up to the students to prove to Ex Com
mittee that it put its money on the right horse.
