# On a Human Plane

TO many Stanford people the freshman
course on the history of Western civilization
is quite a shock, religiously speaking. Many
from every year's freshman class have ideas
they have learned and believed from childhood
attacked and, some of them feel, completely
shattered.
Some of these freshmen are rather relieved,
and like to feel free to bat around for a while
as agnostics. Others become atheists: losing
one belief causes them passionately to adopt
another. But most of them remain Christians.
They find when they are sophomores that it
is no longer fashionable to talk about religion.
And little by little they get back into their rou
tine of going to church once a week, or how

ever often their conscience dictates.
But there are some who like to get away from
the stained-glass atmosphere which surrounds,
and has surrounded, religion since the Middle
Ages. They like to make their religion a little
more simple, perhaps more human.
It is for these people that eight Palo Alto
churches have established fellowship groups
for the benefit of Stanford students.
Until last spring, these eight groups were
entirely separate and worked independently of
each other. But at the end of last spring they
banded together into what they call "The Inter-
Faith Council." Closer fellowship is their aim.
Individually, these groups meet on Sundays.
They are student organized and student run.
Theii purpose, according to a directory which
they have issued, is to "offer opportunities for
worship, fellowship, firesides, sings, retreats,
recreation, discussion groups, social action, and
so forth."
They welcome all students of all faiths. And
for students who are interested, information can
be had from: the Christian Endeavor Society,
the Christian Science Organization, the Deseret
Club, the Lutheran Student Association, the
Roger Williams Club, the Stanford Episcopal
Club, the Wesley Foundation, and the West
minster Club.—D. J.
