## TIME GOOSE-STEPS ON 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
AS the United Press would have it: Joe Doe, Kala
mazoo physician, walked across the street today in
order to reach the other side.
As the nation's leading news magazine would "im
partially give color to the news":
This week, as it must to all men, the desire to
cross the street welled in the breast of John Billings
Doe, aged forty-five. A physician of white-rat research
fame, Kalamazooan Doe set out for the west side of
Main Street at 12 o'clock, Eastern Standard Time.
Trimly dressed, sports-coated, middle-aged Doe
reached his destination three minutes later, unharried
by a humid two-mile an hour breeze blowing from
the southeast. (Editor's note: For the wind routes of
the prevailing easterlies, TIME, September 23, 1933)
A thoroughfare of long standing, Kalamazoo's Main
Street provides no mean challenge to the average
crosser. Built in 1890 by the first mayor of Kalamazoo,
puffy-faced, gooseberry-eating Paul Pry Pudges, the
city's leading patriarch, Main Street has been trod
upon by eighty-five and one-halt per cent of Kalama
zoo's citizenry in its 49 turbulent years. Now a main
artery for Kalamazoo automobiles, trucks, street cars,
and push-carts, Main Street is colorful, busy, a chal
lenge.

Doe remarked before assailing his venture, "I
have nothing to lose but my life, of which I wish
there were more to give to my city!" Smiling and
waving to assembled potentates after his success, Doe
was happy, cheerful, modest.
Doe's feat calls to mind similar experiences of three
hundred thousand Main Street-crossers in 1939. But
unique in the history of street-crossing was Doe's
purpose. Motivated by a strong desire to reach the
west side of Main Street. Doe was apparently obliv
ious to other possible reasons for crossing the boule
vard. (For statistical analysis of street-crossing rea
sons, Fortune Survey, FORTUNE, December, 1936)
But an optimistic prospective for future street
crossing motives was held by Kalamazoo's leading
banker, Septegenarian WilHam Wuilz Winks, one
time President of the Kiwanis Club. Said Banker
Winks, "There is no reason for alarm."
As Time's caption writer would have it: "John Bill
ings, M.D.â€”no legless creature he."
Isn't scientific newsrwriting wonderful!
