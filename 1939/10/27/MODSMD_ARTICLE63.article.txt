# CAMPUS OPINION
## CRACKS IN THE EGGS 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
Apropos of your editorial on the "30 Every
Thursday" plan, it seems to me that a more thorough
going economic analysis would be illuminating. Per
haps it has escaped my attention, but I have seen no
discussion in the Daily of the economic weaknesses of
the plan itself. Even a cursory reading of the pro
visions of the act reveals some startling flaws. But
since in the large, the student body will not take the
trouble to read or analyze the plan, I think an analysis
in the Daily of one or two of tffe major points would
be welcome.
As a suggestion along this line, I should like to
point out just a few of the weaknesses which caught
my attention.
1. Introduction of such a large amount of new cur
rency into circulation inevitably will result in the rap
idly rising prices of an inflationary movement. The
danger of inflation is obvious. As regards higher prices
for consumers' goods, it is axiomatic that the wage
earner and ordinary citizen will be faced with a rapid
increase in the cost of living, wages, and salaries al
ways lag behind price increases.
2. The wide banking and executive powers granted
to the proposed administrator and his board seem to
me to be inviting abuses. Apparently there are few
safeguai ds to prevent misuse of funds from personal
motives.
3. Ihe credit of the state of California will be se
iiously damaged if the state must accept warrants,
probably depreciated in value, in lieu of taxes.
4. California will attract the aged from other states
who have only to establish residence for five years to
qualify for benefits. Granted that many of the aged
need and deserve government aid, it is unreasonable
to assume that California should take on itself the
burden for the whole country.
# * m #
r piIERE are many other points in the act which de
serve consideration. However, in summation, I
would like to add one sad fact about the scheme which
is often overlooked. The plan, no matter how unsound,
is symptomatic of a real need. I hope that the agitation
around such panaceas as "$3O Every Thursday" and
the "Townsend Security Plan" will aid in developing
a more adequate old age security plan than we have
at present. You cannot completely destrojfmeasures like
"$3O Every Thursday" by invective or by ballot. There
will be some new equally unsound plan next year.
To get at the causes of such panaceas, the basic needs
of the people must be met.

Apropos of your editorial on the "30 Every
Thursday" plan, it seems to me that a more thorough
going economic analysis would be illuminating. Per
haps it has escaped my attention, but I have seen no
discussion in the Daily of the economic weaknesses of
the plan itself. Even a cursory reading of the pro
visions of the act reveals some startling flaws. But
since in the large, the student body will not take the
trouble to read or analyze the plan, I think an analysis
in the Daily of one or two of tffe major points would
be welcome.
As a suggestion along this line, I should like to
point out just a few of the weaknesses which caught
my attention.
1. Introduction of such a large amount of new cur
rency into circulation inevitably will result in the rap
idly rising prices of an inflationary movement. The
danger of inflation is obvious. As regards higher prices
for consumers' goods, it is axiomatic that the wage
earner and ordinary citizen will be faced with a rapid
increase in the cost of living, wages, and salaries al
ways lag behind price increases.
2. The wide banking and executive powers granted
to the proposed administrator and his board seem to
me to be inviting abuses. Apparently there are few
safeguai ds to prevent misuse of funds from personal
motives.
3. Ihe credit of the state of California will be se
iiously damaged if the state must accept warrants,
probably depreciated in value, in lieu of taxes.
4. California will attract the aged from other states
who have only to establish residence for five years to
qualify for benefits. Granted that many of the aged
need and deserve government aid, it is unreasonable
to assume that California should take on itself the
burden for the whole country.
# * m #
r piIERE are many other points in the act which de
serve consideration. However, in summation, I
would like to add one sad fact about the scheme which
is often overlooked. The plan, no matter how unsound,
is symptomatic of a real need. I hope that the agitation
around such panaceas as "$3O Every Thursday" and
the "Townsend Security Plan" will aid in developing
a more adequate old age security plan than we have
at present. You cannot completely destrojfmeasures like
"$3O Every Thursday" by invective or by ballot. There
will be some new equally unsound plan next year.
To get at the causes of such panaceas, the basic needs
of the people must be met.
