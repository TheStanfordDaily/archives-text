# 'Children of God' Presents' Mormon Migration Story
## 
### 
Vardis Fisher's "Children of God" is an cxciting and tremendous book.
Dealing with one of America's greatest mass migrations, with the establish
ment of a powerful church based on revelations vouchsafed to an obscure
New York farm boy who was. to say the least, "impressionable." the book
is 7(i!) pages of absorbing interest. Termed fiction, it often turns into bis-

jtory and is exceedingly wordy and
repetitious, but its faults are mini
mized by the excellent presentation
which is straightforward and unsen
timental.
Of a staunch Mormon family him
self, Fisher has been collecting ma
terial for this tome for nearly twelve
years. He knows and tells every
thing about this amazing story which
began when young Joseph Smith de
clared to the astonished' citizens of
Palmyra, New York, that Cod had
appointed him prophet of a new
church, and described the proceed
ings in detail.
NEW ERA COMES
The chronicle pursues the story of
the Mormons till three-quarters of a
century later when, after withstand
ing persecution and ridicule of the
most violent sort, it succumbs to the
capitalism and morality of a new
era to become merely another sect.
The figures of Joseph Smith and
Brigham Young achieve heroic pro
portions. Brigham Young, a man of
incredible fortitude, shrewdness, and
foresight, ranks as one of America's
great men. The prophet Joe Smith,
who espoused the doctrine of celes
tial marriage (plurality of wives) to
satisfy the insistence of his flesh and
his conscience at the same time, who
was responsible for one of ihe
strangest experiments in socialized
culture the New World has yet seen,
becomes a gentle mystic zealous for
a better life for his followers. How
ever, the book is more than a recital
of the lives of these two men. The
whole pageant of American history
sweeps across the pages.
MIXTURE OF BELIEFS
The paradox of the growth of a
constructive achievement from the
odd mixture of beliefs held by the
Mormons doesn't make good sense,
but what they accomplished does.
Wierdly enough, in the same state
in which Joseph Smith advanced his
visions to a skeptical world, another
prophet is preaching a new gospel
and gaining cohorts much as he did.
There's no point in running out of
adjectives, but the book is truly
what its author has termed it, an
"American epic."â€”Farrell
