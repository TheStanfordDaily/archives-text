# Seriate Rushes Neutrality Bill
## Leaders Hope to End Argument Tomorrow 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 26 (UP).
The Senate tonight agreed to limit I
drastically further debate on revi- :
sion of the Neutrality Act and re
peal of the arms embargo in an ef- !
fort to reach a final vote tomorrow, j
Senate Democratic Leader Alben I
W. Barkley, of Kentucky, obtained
unanimous consent to the limita- (
tion shortly after the administration j
defeated, 55 to 27, an effort by Sen. i
Sheridan Downey, D., Calif., to in- '
sert an arms embargo provision in j
the new measure. The vote was con- !
sidered a major test of administra
tion strength.
Barkley agreed to resort to de
bate limitation only when he had
failed to obtain consent for the tak
ing of a final vote at a specific hour.
Under the agreement a senator will
be permitted to speak only 20 min
i utes on the bill and not more than
the same period on each amendment
pending or offered.
An exception was made for the !
amendment introduced by Sen. Ben- |
nett C. Clark, D., Mo., leader of the I
embargo-retention bloc, to prohibit j
armed merchant ships of belligerent |
nations from entering U. S. polls or
territorial waters. Forty minutes
will be allocated evenly to propo
nents and opponents of the proposal.
The agreement cut short an over- :
time session which lasted until 7:15!
p.m.

higher learning contain more than
