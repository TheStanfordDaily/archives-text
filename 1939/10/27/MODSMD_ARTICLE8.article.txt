# 'Andy' Pampers Half Million Gallons of Water Each Day
## 
### BUD AMES 
The water's too hot. The water's too cold. Everybody complains. But
Alfred Ilenry Anderson—Andy to everybody—just laughs and kids hack.
He is the white-haired engineer who runs the filters and water warmers
at the Encina pools.
Andy, who became the pool engineer 10 years ago, must pamper almost

a million gallons of water every
| day—a lot of water in all those
i years. He comes on duty about 7:30
every morning, quits about 4 o'clock
j in the afternoon, and, incidentally,
he has missed only three days' work
j since he took the job back in '29.
As Nort Thornton, the swimming
I coach, says, "Andy is the grand old
j man of the Encina pools. He is con
j stantly being ribbed by swimmers
} about the water conditions. And he
j knows how to rib back and keep an
| even temper at all times. And he's
j so essential that when he was ill for
! three days nobody could run the fil
ters."
liORN IN TAHITI
Historically speaking, Alfred Hen
ry was born of Scotch-Irish parents
in Papeete on the island of Tahiti.
He won't tell his age but admits that
he is in his early sixties. He looks
50 and acts like 40.
He came to San Francisco when
very young, and started to work at
14, after completing grammar school.
He is a machinist by trade, and got
into the business first as a marine
and later as a stationary engineer.
He engineered at the Base Hospital
in Palo Alto and the San Mateo
High School, and then took over
the Encina pools. During the war,
he was a machinist, first rate, in Ihe
navy yard at Marc Island.
! FILTER EXPLAINED
Exactly what does Andy do? Well,
his job is to keep the filters and
j temperature regulators running and
—do every kind of work around Ihe
i pool, as Andy puts it. Those filters
j are large tanks about a third filled
; with sand and gravel. The water is
| forced through this muck, and Ihe
1 impurities are removed.
As a personality, Andy is the pro
verbial one in the million. Laugh
ing is one of his worst habits, and
