# 'Andy' Pampers Half Million Gallons of Water Each Day
## 
### BUD AMES 
The water's too hot. The water's too cold. Everybody complains. But
Alfred Ilenry Anderson—Andy to everybody—just laughs and kids hack.
He is the white-haired engineer who runs the filters and water warmers
at the Encina pools.
Andy, who became the pool engineer 10 years ago, must pamper almost

a million gallons of water every
| day—a lot of water in all those
i years. He comes on duty about 7:30
every morning, quits about 4 o'clock
j in the afternoon, and, incidentally,
he has missed only three days' work
j since he took the job back in '29.
As Nort Thornton, the swimming
I coach, says, "Andy is the grand old
j man of the Encina pools. He is con
j stantly being ribbed by swimmers
} about the water conditions. And he
j knows how to rib back and keep an
| even temper at all times. And he's
j so essential that when he was ill for
! three days nobody could run the fil
ters."
liORN IN TAHITI
Historically speaking, Alfred Hen
ry was born of Scotch-Irish parents
in Papeete on the island of Tahiti.
He won't tell his age but admits that
he is in his early sixties. He looks
50 and acts like 40.
He came to San Francisco when
very young, and started to work at
14, after completing grammar school.
He is a machinist by trade, and got
into the business first as a marine
and later as a stationary engineer.
He engineered at the Base Hospital
in Palo Alto and the San Mateo
High School, and then took over
the Encina pools. During the war,
he was a machinist, first rate, in Ihe
navy yard at Marc Island.
! FILTER EXPLAINED
Exactly what does Andy do? Well,
his job is to keep the filters and
j temperature regulators running and
—do every kind of work around Ihe
i pool, as Andy puts it. Those filters
j are large tanks about a third filled
; with sand and gravel. The water is
| forced through this muck, and Ihe
1 impurities are removed.
As a personality, Andy is the pro
verbial one in the million. Laugh
ing is one of his worst habits, and
each laugh reveals firm strong
teeth—all his own though he is over
GO.
Physically, Andy stands about 5
feet 6 and he weighs 175. The
| slouchy black engineer's cap which
; is ever on his head covers a bald
i spot which he, ever sensitive about
1 his age, half hides from his friends.
The war. Andy thinks that it is
i definitely unjustified, because he
| doesn't see where they're working
j to. They are just playing around,
i In the long run Germany will be
. bottled up, he feels, and then the
! people will be starved into submis
-1 sion.
FAVORS lIAM AND EGGS
His ideas on the Ham and Egg
question are just as definite. Andy
knows how the University feels
about the question. He still wants
| the Ham and Eggs to go through
| and he thinks it has a good chance.
I The plan isn't perfect, Andy admits,
j but at least it is an attempt to do
; something for all the unemployed
i and aging people.
lIAS THREE CHILDREN
Yes, he is married, and he has two
j sons and a daughter, all of whom
i are married now. He smokes a pipe,
; likes to read Digest and Popular
| Mechanics. He hasn't a hobby —
| never considered one. But he does
j like ocean fishing. In fact, he likes
i everything to do with the water.

Exactly what does Andy do? Well,
his job is to keep the filters and
j temperature regulators running and
—do every kind of work around Ihe
i pool, as Andy puts it. Those filters
j are large tanks about a third filled
; with sand and gravel. The water is
| forced through this muck, and Ihe

verbial one in the million. Laugh
ing is one of his worst habits, and

teeth—all his own though he is over

The water's too hot. The water's too cold. Everybody complains. But
Alfred Ilenry Anderson—Andy to everybody—just laughs and kids hack.

Andy, who became the pool engineer 10 years ago, must pamper almost

a million gallons of water every
| day—a lot of water in all those
i years. He comes on duty about 7:30
every morning, quits about 4 o'clock
j in the afternoon, and, incidentally,
he has missed only three days' work
j since he took the job back in '29.
