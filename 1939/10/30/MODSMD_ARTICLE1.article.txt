### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
IN "the old days"—the days that
people talk about so often and so
seldom define — Congressmen used
the government printing office and
the franking privilege to send their
constituents copies of speeches that
established their views on national
problems.
Today Signor Marconi's invention
has simplified things considerably.
Senators and Representatives, in the
hushed silence of glass-enclosed
broadcasting studios, appeal to their
constituents in a very different way.
Their words, spoken quietly on the
eve of an important national move,
are tossed over the 3000-miles of
the American continent to those who
await wold of tt.eir representatives'
stand.
The streamlined \heels of de
mocracy spun yesterday with amaz
ing swiftness as administration lead
ers began a drive to dispose of the
embattled Neutrality Revision Bill,
which the Senate approved 63 to
30, when it comes before the Kiuse
on Tuesday.
* <1 * \
'|M IE opposition began a last
ditch fight. Republican Rep
resentative Bruce Barton, in a ra
dio speech, branded repeal of the
arms embargo as a step which
may be construed as un-neutral.
"I say let us pass that part of the
bill which lias to do with neutral
ity, and keep that part which has
to do with un-neutrality—the lift
ing of the embargo — suspended
like a sword over the belliger
ents' heads," he said.
'"The longer they hesitate the more
their people will be asking, 'What
is the purpose of this war? What
are its objectives?'" He insisted
that if America has any role in Eu
rope it must be the role of "be
loved friend, the friend of all peo
ples, the friend who makes peace."

ANSWERING Barton, Luther
Johnson of Texas also spoke on
a nation-wide hook-up, asserting
that early action on the administra
tion measure in the lower chamber
is "imperative" to protect American
neutrality. Newspaper columnists,
men who are intimately in touch
with both sides of the Neutrality
Bill fight, took to the airlanes yes
terday, too. Jay Franklin defended
the President's policies and Ernest K.
Lindley said he thought it "prefer
able but not necessary" that Great
Britain and France triumph in the
current struggle.
"The sound policy for us," Frank
lin said, "is to give the British and
their allies the 'breaks' but not in
such a way as to commit us to their
cause."

Boake Carter, strongly opinion
ated always, warned that unequal
application of neutrality laws is
"plainly and simply intervention."
Striking at the popular theory that
if the United States docs not help
the Allies "it will be our turn
next," Carter said, "That is bosh
and propaganda that does not
square with the facts."
So, with a widely divergent cross
section of viewpoints flooding the
United States, Mr. and Mrs. J. Q.
Public will keep an eagle eye cocked
on Washington as the Administra
tionites and the Isolationists decide
America's fate in the world scene
this week.
Isolationists admit privately that
Jieir only hope of defeating the
legislation lies in the number of
colleagues who can be swayed by
pressure from back home, if that
pressure is great. And the Admin
istration predicts an easy, ,'JO-voto
margin victory.
