# Success (downs Sophomore's 'Auld Lang Syne' Luncheons
## 
### 
Women of the Class of '42 have succeeded in keeping in contact
with one another, though plan after plan, advancing ideas for a compli
cated system of exchange meals between sororities and halls, were
scotched as impractical.
Under the leadership of Charrie Rush, a series of bi-monthly luncheons

been arranged where last year's
Robleites meet to dine together and
talk it over. The group has no axes
to grind, unless keeping up old
friendships comes under that head
ing. These meetings are held in the
basement of the Women's Club
house.
No particular committees have
been appointed, and the group
I which handles the affair changes
from week to week, though the
original idea belongs to Charrie
Rush, and she is in nominal charge
of arrangements. Helping her from
time to time have been Mary and
Charlotte Rodenbaugh, Eleana Madi
? son, Irma Hannibal, Eleanor Hall,
! Donna Goodheart, B. J. Ward, Syl
via Berry, Alistair Mac Donald, Mag
gie Harper, Norma Mackenzie, and
Mary Bills.
Putzie Hinrichs, head sponsor at
! Roble last year, commenting on the
| luncheons, said, "The idea is a good
j one, and I know it will continue.
I There is certainly no reason why it
shouldn't."
Last year, during the spring elec
: tions, Roble women bolted the Hall
I and Row caucuses to nominate their
| own candidate for the position of
j sophomore secretary-treasurer. Pat
j Adams was nominated and all other
I candidates for the office voluntarily
! withdrew their names.
