# 'Exposition Reopening Impossible'
## Official Slates Less Than Half Required $1,650,000 Raised 
### 
(Exclusive to The Daily)
| San Francisco's $55,000,000 ex
j travaganza on Treasure Island,
| which closed with taps and "lights
: out" at midnight last night, will not
l re-open in 1940, a reliable source
| informed The Daily last night.
The information came from the
[ same source which three weeks ago
! on Oct. 3 informed The Daily, 18
| hours ahead of any other newspaper
i in the country, that the Fair would
) close its gates Oct. 29 instead of
I Dec. 2 as originally planned.
i "The Exposition will not re-open,"
he stated. "Dan London's committee
I has raised less than half of the $1,-
i 650,000 required for a 1940 opening,
j Of the $750,000 raised, only about
| $350,000 is in cash."
1 CAMPAIGNING FAILS
j London, a San Francisco hotel
| man, has labored feverishly since
; announcement of the advanced clos
j ing date to raise the money for a
re-opening. His "1946 Exposition,
] Inc." has campaigned over the en
tire Bay Area for contributions.
Demolition bulletins, according to
The Daily's source, who is an Expo
sition official, were issued to exhibi
tors Friday, indicating that exhibits
will start moving out Monday morn
! ing (today).
1 "Once the exhibits have started
! moving out," he said, "there is no
j chance that the Fair will re-open."
AID UNCERTAIN
Several offers of financial aid were
considered by the source as too
nebulous for consideration. Mayor
Rossi has pledged himself to en
deavor to raise $250,000 from city
funds at his disposal (presumably
publicity funds) if he is re-elected.
"But he is not elected yet," the
source commented. "And if he were,
$250,000 is still far short of making
up the deficit.
Los Angeles pledges of $350,000
were revealed at the same time, but
three successive efforts of San Fran
ciscans to collect the offered sum
were unsuccessful. "It has been re
ported as collected, but the money
does not exist," the source said.
STRUB WON'T COME BACK
Also revealed was the fact that
Dr. Charles Strub would not con
sider returning to the Exposition as
managing director next year, even if
funds for a re-opening were at hand.
Meanwhile, it was announced that
the Fair's Board of Management
might meet in the near future if any
possibility of a re-opening showed
up.
At 6 o'clock last night, 126,267 per
sons had passed through the Expo
sition gates to attend the final cere
monies. The crowd was about 50,000
short of the record attendance for
any single day.
