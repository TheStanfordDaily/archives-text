# Deans Approve Game Dance
## Cardinals to Start Bid Sale This Week 
### 
Stanford's widely publicized Big
Game Dance which will feature the
danceable rhythms of Jimmy Grier
and his orchestra, became a reality
last night with the official approval
of Dean of Women Mary Yost and
Dean of Men John Bunn.
"The deans are completely behind
the dance, and have given their
sanction pending the securing of
chaperones," stated A.S.S.U. Vice-
President Coline Upshaw, following
an interview with Dean Yost. "This
is purely a matter of form, and will
be handled immediately," she added.
ATTENDANCE URGED
With the removal of the last major
obstacle in preparations for the
affair, Cardinals' Chairman Ken Koch
announced that bids will go on sale
in the A.S.S.U. office the latter part
of the week, at $5 per couple. Price
of the bids will include privileges
of the Millbrae Country Club in San
Bruno, dancing to Grier's popular
band, appropriate decorations, and
refreshments.
Urging participation of the gen
eral student body in the Big Game
Dance project, A.S.S.U. President
Ken Cuthbertson stated, "I hope that
students will really get behind this
dance, not only because it affords
an inexpensive evening, but also for
the reason that this will be one of
the few places students will be able
to see most of their friends Big Game
night. The officers feel that a large
attendance should assure the pos
sibility of making the Big Game
Dance an annual tradition."
JIMMY GRIER SIGNED
The signing of Grier's orchestra by
Cardinals' dance chairman Gordy
Nicoll Thursday night climaxed two
days of hurried negotiations to se
cure a big name band on the part
of Nicoll and Cuthbertson.
The affair, which will be one of
the few A.S.S.U. dances ever held
off campus, will last from 10 to 2
o'clock. Bids will also be sold by
representatives on the Row, in living
groups, and in eating clubs.
Grier, who is now playing an en
gagement. in British Columbia, was
contacted by his San Francisco
agent, Ames Bishop, and will come
South for the Stanford dance fol
lowing the conclusion of his north
ern assignment.
