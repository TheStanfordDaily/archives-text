# Memorial Hall Sees 28 Plays In Two Years
## Checkered History Of Theater Begins With 'Twelfth Night'' 
### 
A mammoth production of William
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," Aug.
19, 1937, was the first play to be pre
sented in Stanford's new Memorial
Theater. Since that time 28 plays,
12 in the main theater and 16 in the
little theater, have been presented to
Stanford audiences under the aus
pices of the Division of Speech and
Drama.
'"Twelfth Night" was directed by
Hubert IlefTner, present head of the
Division of Speech and Drama, who
was here on his first visit. Done on
an enormous scale, with sets 30 and
40 feet high, the Shakespearean com
edy was a successful opener.
The following season saw one of
the best liked plays ever presented
on tne boards of the main theater.
"Kind Lady," starring J. P. Cahn,
Hal Kohn, and Kay Campbell, was
repeated because of popular demand.
FLAY TRIAL BY JURY'
"Murder in the Cathedral" com
bined music, drama, and the dance
in a highly artistic production, but
the Farm didn't like it. Presented
with "Murder in the Cathedral"
was the only Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta yet seen in Memorial Hall,
"Trial by Jury."
Also seen in 1937-38 were "John
ny Johnson" and Maxwell Ander
son's "Star Wagon" which was pre
sented by the Alumni Association.
"Blue Jeans," by Martin Flavin, re
ceived its world premiere, but it is
better to remember only that the
production was noteworthy because
of the post-performance dance held
on the stage. In the Little Theater
Moliere's "Don Juan," "A Winter's
Tale," and Chiarelli's "Mask and the
Face" found receptive audiences.
LITTLE THEATER USED
During the 1938-39 season "To
bias and the Angel" and Ernest Tol
ler's "No More Peace" were pre
sented on the main stage. However,
it was a busy year in the "Little
Theater." Ibsen's "The Vikings,"
"All's Well That Ends Well," "Hip
polytus" and an experimental mod
ern dress presentation of "Shoe
maker's Holiday" were given in
rapid succession.
A standout among Little Theater
productions was Maxim Gorki's "A
Night's Lodging," both from the
staging and acting angles. Also out
standing from another viewpoint was
the seven-day run of '"Hie Gover
nors Wile,' which hit a new low
in Farm drama. It was said that
even the actors were bored.
AND THIS YEARâ€”
The 1939-40 season is hardly under
way; William Vaughn Moody's "The
Great Divide"' was not an auspicious
opener, but Paul Vincent Carroll's
"Shadow and Substance" was a tre
mendous Broadway success last,
year, and in the past Broadway suc
cesses have been popular with Farm
theater-goers. Mr. HefTner's evident
anxiety to co-operate with students
in allowing them to have a voice in
selecting plays for their theater, as
evidenced in the student poll for
play choices, speaks well for the re
mainder of the year.
