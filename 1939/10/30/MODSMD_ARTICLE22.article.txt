VANCOUVER, 8.C., Oct. 29 (UP).
â€”Tlirco American fliers marooned
at Teslin Lake since their plane
crashed on the narrow beach on
Oct.. 8 will probably stay until the
lake freezes over, permitting ski
equipped planes to land. Complete
freeze-over of the lake will take at
least two weeks.
Meanwhile the three men, C. O.
Galbraith, pilot, formerly of Bel
hnehj.m. Richard King of Seattle,
and Herbert Gisher of Blaine, are
believed to be comfortable and well
fed at the border outpost of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
