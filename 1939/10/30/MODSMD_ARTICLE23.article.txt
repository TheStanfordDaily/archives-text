TO PLEASE STANFORD
Professor Heffner, who came to
Stanford from Northwestern because
he feels that Stanford is to become
the leading school of drama in the
country, hopes that this poll will do
much to increase student interest in
the theater, which "was, after all,
meant to be primarily a source of
entertainment."
Commenting on the criticism
which has been leveled against
Stanford productions in the past,
Heffner added, "An academic the
ater is not a living theater. If Stan
ford picks its own plays, it should
enjoy them, for nothing that the
public wants to see is dead."

TO PLEASE STANFORD
Professor Heffner, who came to
Stanford from Northwestern because
he feels that Stanford is to become
the leading school of drama in the
country, hopes that this poll will do
much to increase student interest in
the theater, which "was, after all,
meant to be primarily a source of
entertainment."
Commenting on the criticism
which has been leveled against
Stanford productions in the past,
Heffner added, "An academic the
ater is not a living theater. If Stan
ford picks its own plays, it should
enjoy them, for nothing that the
public wants to see is dead."
What plays do yon want to see presented in Memorial Mali?
The Division of Speech and Drama wants to know the answer to tlii.s
question, and it is taking steps to find out.
"The students have a right to see what they like in their own theater,"
says Hubert HefTner, new head of (lie division, "and we will give them

just what tlicy want."
To this end, the Stanford Daily
will conduct a poll of student opin
ion on popular plays throughout this
week and, on Friday, students will
vote on their favorites.
VOTES TO BE PHONED
The winning play will be given
as the first presentation of winter
quarter and, according to Heffner,
will be given the "best possible
production."
Suggestions for plays may be tele
phoned to the Daily office, P.A.
22166, or to Chester Barker, secre
tary of the Division of Speech and
Drama, P.A. 9411, Local 591.
All plays will then be checked
from the royalty, production, and
directorial standpoints, as well as to
see whether they have already been
produced here at Stanford or at the
Palo Alto Community Theater, with
which the Division of Speech and
Drama has a nonduplication agree
ment.
