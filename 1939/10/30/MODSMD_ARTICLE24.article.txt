# Frosh Tour Row, Serenade Roble
## 
### 
About. 100 freshman men, some in
bathrobes and pajamas, drove up to
Roble late lust night, to parade
around the women's hail wailing,
"Poor Roble, poor Roble." A cam
pus officer drove up and cooled off
the mild riot.
It all started when members of
the Class of '42 created a disturb
ance outside of Encina earlier in the
evening. They dared the freshmen
to come out, and when the latter
did so retired up the How. The
frosh showed up at Roble after fol
lowing the sophomores up the Row.
