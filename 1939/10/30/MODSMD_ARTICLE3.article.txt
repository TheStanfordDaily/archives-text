### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 29 (UP).—Soviet
secrecy regarding the American
steamship City of Flint was lifted a
trifle today when the official Soviet
news agency, Tass, was permitted to
announce that the vessel had left
Murmansk yesterday.
The vessels' destination and the
fate of its 41 American crew mem
bers went unmentioned in the terse
announcement.
The presumption among Moscow
observers was that it was sailed by
the German prize crew which
brought it into the arctic port of
neutral friend as a car-
of contraband. The Americans
were believed to be prisoners. Its
destination was believed to be a Ger
man part, perhaps Hamburg.

the City of Flint case, it was indi

nation of Russia's role in the inci
dent which has raised vital questions
of neutral rights in the European
war.
American diplomatic activity
abroad in connection with the seiz
ure of the U.S. freighter by a Nazi
prize crew is expected to center in
Berlin during the week because of
apparently authentic reports that
Russia has permitted the ship to

VERSIONS CONFUSED
In an official statement, or "white
paper," issued by the State Depart
ment last night, the chronology of
known and reported events regard
ing the City of Flint's capture were
recited to show confusion in Soviet-
Nazi versions of the affair. The
paper also criticized Russia's lack of
co-operation with this country in
the matter.
There were strong indications that
the paper was only a prelude to more
vigorous diplomatic action against
both Russia and Germany, a minor
phase of which may be the turning
of a cold shoulder to the Soviet
Union's returning ambassador to this
country.
