## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 29 (UP).â€”Alice i
j Brady, who could portray a scatter
brain woman on the screen as sue- [
: cessfully as she could the most tragic 1
; character in an O'Neill drama, died j
I last night after a lingering illness.
The 46-year-old Broadway and
I Hollywood star entered a private
i sanitarium here about three weeks
ago. She was registered as Mrs.
Crane. Her presence there, was j
! known only to a few close friends :
i until her death was revealed late i
today.
She is survived by a son, Donald,
j who is in California. She divorced
I his father, James Lyon Crane, in
1922. Private funeral services will
be held tomorrow, followed by bur- j
ial in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.
PREVIOUS ILLNESS
In recent years she has suffered ;
several attacks of illness. She was I
stricken with influenza in Holly- j
wood last year while making "Good- [
bye Broadway," and before that had j
broken her ankle.
Her most outstanding recent sue- !
I cess in Hollywood was her charac- !
I terization of Mrs. O'Leary in "In i
j Old Chicago.'' It was the first dra- ;
matic role she had played in the i
I movies in many years and for her !
j performance she received the Acad- '
|emy Award.
Her greatest stage role perhaps J
I was as the Electra-like daughter in j

Eugene O'Neill's drama, "Mourning I
Becomes Electra."
Miss Brady, daughter of William A.
Brady, famous theatrical producer,
and Ruse Bene, a French singer, was I
born to the theater. She wanted to !
be an actress but her father per- j
suaded her at first to become a |
singer. After studying at the Boston
Conservatory of Music she made
her stage debut in 1911 under the
name of Mary Rose in the operetta
"The Balkan Princess." She was then
19. When the show came to New
York a short time later she played
under her own name.
In the 28 years she appeared in \
the theater, Miss Brady was starred !
in more than 50 plays, including sev- j
eral of the Gilbert and Sullivan op- !
erettas.
RETURNED TO STAGE
In 1918 she returned to the stage,
after a series of 18 silent pictures,
and appeared in "Forever After,"
which was her most successful play
and ran for two years in New York.
She returned to the films in 1921
and her career alternated between
films and the stage for the rest of
her life. Her last stage appearance
was in 1934 but her father had hoped 1
to present her in a new play this '
season.
