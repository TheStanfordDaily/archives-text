# Outplayed Huskies Beat Fighting Card Team, 8-5; Statistics Favor Indians
## Standlee Leads Ground Gainers As Washington Forward Line Holds Stanford Attack; Kerman Injured 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
II may sound like a baseball score, hut that 8-5 licking the Indian var
sity look in Seattle Saturday dropped them into the cellar of the coast
football conference.
Tinj 'Ihornhill's gridders outplayed Washington, statistically speaking,
hu( were unable to cope with a scrapping Husky forward line when the
Phelanmen hud their backs to

Willi.
The Indians gained a total of 215
yards against 184 for the Huskies.
Both teams completed eight passes,
but the Stanford punters outkicked
their opponents, averaging 38 yards
per boot against a 31-yard aver
age for Dean McAdams, Washington
kicker.
MUCIIA STOPS STANDEES
The deciding factor of the game
was the Cards' inability to cash in
on what few breaks did come their
way. The Husky line, led by Rudy
Mucha, stopped Norm Standlee and
the rest of the Indian ball-packers j
in their tracks when the Big Red
Machine threatened to score.
Standlee was the leading ground
gainer on the field,'accounting for l
8!) yards. Pete Kmetovic, who was j
a surprise starter at left half, car- j
l ied the ball only twice, but had the j
highest average of the backs, gain- |
ing 17 yards on two iaunts around '
the Washington ends early in the I
name for a 95-yard average.
MULLIN I IRES PASSES
Jack Mullin and Hugh Gallameau ]
put on a fourth-quarter aerial ex- !
hibition that very nearly saved the I
game for the Cards.
Mullin fired four passes to Gallar
neau that connected, the longest |
good for a 45-yard gain. Stan Graft" j
was also on the receiving end of a I
few of Mullin's heaves.
KERMAN INJURED
Jim Groves accounted for three j
of the Stanford points with a second '
quarter field goal from the Husky j
10-yard line. The score was set up!
when Norm Standlee went over his j
own right tackle for 25 yards after I
an Indian recovery of a Husky j
fumble.
Johnny Kerman, first-string left J
guard, came up with a ligament in- [
jury in his knee and may not be ;
ready for the Santa Clara game in
the stadium next Saturday.
TEAM RETURNS TODAY
Corky Donahue, right tackle, was j
kicked in the ribs, but is expected
to ,be ready to go against the j
Broncs.
The team is scheduled to arrive J
from the North this morning, and j
any line-up changes that may be
made will show in practice this
afternoon.
