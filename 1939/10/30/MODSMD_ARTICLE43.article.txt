# Frosh Gridders Smash Weak U.C.L.A. Team
## Flashy Cards Score 33 Points in First Half of Easy Game 
### 
Every man on the Cardinal bench
saw action as Stanford's high Hying
freshman eleven rolled through an
impotent U.C.L.A. frosh outfit 40-0.
Coach Harry Shipkey's team never
was pressed in the least, being able
to score 33 points in the first half
and then coast home during the J
second half mainly on the perform- j
ances of third and fourth stringers. !
Even without the services of little j
Eric Armstrong and only about five
minutes of action on the part of |
flashy AI Cole, the Papooses domi
nated the Bruins in every part of
the game in a disgustingly one
sided contest.
Though Shipkey's team lacked the
passing threat that would have been
present if Cole had played, they did
not lack any of the tricky running
the little halfback could have sup
plied; for Red Robinson was oh hand.
Red scored the first touchdown of
the game when he took Vucinich's
5-yard pass on the Cubs' 20-yard
line and whirled his way into the
end zone.
RED' SCORES AGAIN
And it was Red again who scored
the second touchdown, taking a
double reverse from Bob Greening
and picking his way through the
Bruin backfield 46 yards to a touch
down. Red also handled the Bruin
punts from the safety position well
and did some fine punting on his
own hook.
As was expected, with Cole and
Armstrong on the sidelines, big Milt
Vucinich carried the burden on the
offensive. Milt rolled up the yard
age on delayed bucks off tackle,
tossed one touchdown pass, and
rolled around right end for another
6 points.
NORBERG STARS
"Hefty Hank" Norberg saw plenty
of action and the fans loved it. Nor
berg certainly did what was expected
of him, smashing down Bruin plays
before they were even conceived,
kicking a couple of conversions, and
just generally getting in the 1 oppo
sition's hair.
The defensive show of strength by
the Card line was superb. The in
vaders couldn't have made more
than 25 yards through the yearlings'
forward wall and porbably lost more
than that. Bruno Banducci, Dick
Palmer, and Bob Millington were
constantly rearing up to throw the
Brains' ball carriers for losses. Ed
McCain, Bill Symes, Ed Stamm, and
Roger Laverty were both sharp, es
pecially on punt coverage.
HANLON SCORES TWICE
Just behind that forward li.ie, do
ing a fine job of line-backing, were
at first Chuck Taylor and Bill Man
non; and later Tony Medved and Bill
Hanlon. Each of the quarterbacks,
Hanlon and Taylor, 'ntercepted Cub
passes for touchdowns. Hanlon tal
lied the third touchdown of the
gnme when he barged Ihrough cen
ter on a spin play from the 10-
yard line.
Bob Greening, the only casualty
of the game, sustained a painful back
injury in the second quarter when
he downed Santana, Bruin back, on
a ku-k-off run back.
I KOSII LOOK AHEAD
The Cardinal yearlings viewed
with interest the 7-7 tie which Cali
fornia and U.S.C. "best ever" fresh
men teams played in Berkeley last
Saturday.
Fully aware of the power of the
Trojans, the Cards realize that they
are in for a tough battle with Cal's
frosh when the two teams meet on
Nov. 11, two weeks from now. Coach
Shipkey has lots of time to whip
his team up to the fine point of effi
ciency he is seeking for the Cal tilt.

McCain, Bill Symes, Ed Stamm, and
Roger Laverty were both sharp, es
pecially on punt coverage.
HANLON SCORES TWICE
Just behind that forward li.ie, do
ing a fine job of line-backing, were
at first Chuck Taylor and Bill Man
non; and later Tony Medved and Bill
Hanlon. Each of the quarterbacks,
Hanlon and Taylor, 'ntercepted Cub
passes for touchdowns. Hanlon tal
lied the third touchdown of the
gnme when he barged Ihrough cen
ter on a spin play from the 10-
yard line.
Bob Greening, the only casualty
of the game, sustained a painful back
injury in the second quarter when
he downed Santana, Bruin back, on
a ku-k-off run back.
I KOSII LOOK AHEAD
The Cardinal yearlings viewed
with interest the 7-7 tie which Cali
fornia and U.S.C. "best ever" fresh
men teams played in Berkeley last
Saturday.
Fully aware of the power of the
Trojans, the Cards realize that they
are in for a tough battle with Cal's
frosh when the two teams meet on
Nov. 11, two weeks from now. Coach
Shipkey has lots of time to whip
his team up to the fine point of effi
ciency he is seeking for the Cal tilt.
Every man on the Cardinal bench
saw action as Stanford's high Hying
freshman eleven rolled through an
impotent U.C.L.A. frosh outfit 40-0.
Coach Harry Shipkey's team never
was pressed in the least, being able
to score 33 points in the first half
and then coast home during the J
second half mainly on the perform- j
ances of third and fourth stringers. !
Even without the services of little j
Eric Armstrong and only about five
minutes of action on the part of |
flashy AI Cole, the Papooses domi
nated the Bruins in every part of
the game in a disgustingly one
sided contest.
Though Shipkey's team lacked the
passing threat that would have been
present if Cole had played, they did
not lack any of the tricky running
the little halfback could have sup
plied; for Red Robinson was oh hand.
Red scored the first touchdown of
the game when he took Vucinich's
5-yard pass on the Cubs' 20-yard
line and whirled his way into the
end zone.
RED' SCORES AGAIN
And it was Red again who scored
the second touchdown, taking a
double reverse from Bob Greening
and picking his way through the
Bruin backfield 46 yards to a touch
down. Red also handled the Bruin
punts from the safety position well
and did some fine punting on his
own hook.
As was expected, with Cole and
Armstrong on the sidelines, big Milt
Vucinich carried the burden on the
offensive. Milt rolled up the yard
age on delayed bucks off tackle,
tossed one touchdown pass, and
rolled around right end for another
6 points.
NORBERG STARS
"Hefty Hank" Norberg saw plenty
of action and the fans loved it. Nor
berg certainly did what was expected
of him, smashing down Bruin plays
before they were even conceived,
kicking a couple of conversions, and
just generally getting in the 1 oppo
sition's hair.
The defensive show of strength by
the Card line was superb. The in
vaders couldn't have made more
than 25 yards through the yearlings'
forward wall and porbably lost more
than that. Bruno Banducci, Dick
Palmer, and Bob Millington were
constantly rearing up to throw the
Brains' ball carriers for losses. Ed
McCain, Bill Symes, Ed Stamm, and
Roger Laverty were both sharp, es
pecially on punt coverage.
