# Week-end Football Scores Grieve Rose Bowl Dopesters
## 
### 
Excluding Cal's second-half head
ache with a powerful Southern Cali
fornia grid juggernaut, the Pacific-
Coast Conference turned in some
very respectable scores over the
week-end but did little about set
tling the Rose Bowl question.
About this tipie every football
season, the experts and prognostica
tors are usually lined up behind one
candidate for exploitation on New
Year's Day. Of course they have the
proviso that in the case of an upset
the "favorite son" might be scrapped
in favor of another.
So far this season, the Conference
teams haven't done much about
helping the experts to settle the
matter prematurely, so that there are
still three teams boasting Rose Bowl
intentions.
The University of Oregon was
definitely removed from the above
picture by U.C.L.A., which remains
in the running with Oregon State and
the afore-mentioned Trojans. Of
the three only the Beavers are un
defeated and untied.
After the 26-0 rout by the Thun
dering Herd of Southern Cal, most
experts will string along with U.S.C.
to waltz to its second straight Bowl
game. But the Trojans have yet to
hear from their two most dangerous
pretenders for the crown, the Bruins
and Beavers.
The Beaver myth wiil be tested
at Corvallis far from the Trojan
stamping grounds and Oregon State's
home lot. If Brother Bruin can go
through four more games unde
feated. and assuming that the Men
of Troy likewise are successful. Los
Angeles should be in quite a dither
over the Bruins' meeting their cross
town rivals for the Bowl invitation.
It needs only mentioning, since

! another column covers it rather well,
I that Stanford lost a football game to
! Washington, 8-5.
The Berkeley Bears brought de-
I feat upon themselves when they
| forced the steaming, stamping Thun
! dering Herd to a sta'nd-off in the
j first half and then crumbled before
j a merciless second-half attack.
Next week, Brother Bear faces a
vicious Brother Bruin in Los An
geles.
O.S.C. stymied the W.S.C. Cou
gars, 13-0. U.C.L.A., although out
i gained and out-downed, pulled
| through with a 1&-6 victory over
i Oregon.
Stanford's rival next week, Santa
! Clara, definitely put Coast football
' on a superior plane to that of the
I Big Ten by whipping Purdue, 13-6.
