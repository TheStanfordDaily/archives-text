# Frosh Lose 4-0 To Polytech High
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman soccer team
! dropped a 4-0 decision to Polytech
' nic High of San Francisco Saturday
[on the varsity field here. The frosh
I showed inexperience throughout
l and special weaknesses at fullback
I and forward spots. In contrast, the
i Poly eleven was faster and more
j alert..
The Papooses, behind 3-0 at the
! end of the first half, showed a few
i flashes of form in the last half but
| lost several scoring opportunities.
The play of A1 Berry and Warren
HofTer at halves and Gabe Davalos
j and Tommy Trent at forwards was
| encouraging.
