# Indians Win water Tilt, 3-2, As Rough Play Marks Game
## 
### 
Stanford look the rough way back into the conference water polo pic
ture Saturday with a 3 to 2 win over the C.S.C. Trojans in Encina pool.
The southern seven's knock 'em down and drag 'em out method of pla>
spelled its downfall in the Sinai two minutes of play when Cuptain Bob»
Plate scored the winning tally. Tom Call. Trojan forward, sent the visi-

tors into a one-goal lead in the first 4
half and the middle-way gun found
the Trojans out in front, 1 to 0
The roughest play seen during the '
game found Mickey Frary, U.S.C. |
forward, tossed from the game by
Referee Jim Smith early in the sec
ond half and Stanford knotted the
count at 2-2 on goals by Dave
Nottage and Plate.
Frary continued to entertain shady
methods on his man, Nottage, when- j
ever the referee's attention was di- !
rected the other way. He finally
caused the game to be held up, and
during the course of the time out, !
Jim Sellers of U.S.C., irritated by |
what he thought was drifting on the j
part of Plate, slugged the Stanford
captain. Called from the game, Sel- |
lers left Plate unguarded and the 1
latter scored. j
Play was rough all the way, and it
contrasted to a fine bit of sportsman
ship employed by Bill Sutton of
Fullerton J.C. in the preliminary,
won by the Stanford junior varsity.
4 to 3.
The game went into - an extra 1
three-minute period with the count
at three-all. Bruce Jessup of Stan- 1
ford was called from the game when
Referee Harvey Rothschild thought
he was drifting intentionally. The
ruling was obviously an error and
Sutton asked Rothschild to let Jes
sup stay in the game, which was
allowed.
Thus tossing almost certain vic
tory to the winds, the Fullerton out
fit was beaten a minute later by Bill
Weedin's goal.
Any Farm hopes for the launching
of a new winning streak were rudely
nipped in the bud Saturday by the
Olympic Club's powerful sevens at
Encina Pool. The national junior
champions took the measure of the
Card varsity by a 5-3 count after
the Olympic second team had han
dily blanked the Indian jayvees 5 to
0. Comic relief to an otherwise sad
day for Stanford was supplied by
the performance of the two comic
divers Clyde Diaz and Norman Han
dly between the games.

ruling was obviously an error and
Sutton asked Rothschild to let Jes
sup stay in the game, which was
allowed.
Thus tossing almost certain vic
tory to the winds, the Fullerton out
fit was beaten a minute later by Bill
Weedin's goal.
Any Farm hopes for the launching
of a new winning streak were rudely
nipped in the bud Saturday by the
Olympic Club's powerful sevens at
Encina Pool. The national junior
champions took the measure of the
Card varsity by a 5-3 count after
the Olympic second team had han
dily blanked the Indian jayvees 5 to
0. Comic relief to an otherwise sad
day for Stanford was supplied by
the performance of the two comic
divers Clyde Diaz and Norman Han
dly between the games.
Stanford look the rough way back into the conference water polo pic
ture Saturday with a 3 to 2 win over the C.S.C. Trojans in Encina pool.
The southern seven's knock 'em down and drag 'em out method of pla>
spelled its downfall in the Sinai two minutes of play when Cuptain Bob»
Plate scored the winning tally. Tom Call. Trojan forward, sent the visi-

tors into a one-goal lead in the first 4
half and the middle-way gun found
the Trojans out in front, 1 to 0
The roughest play seen during the '
game found Mickey Frary, U.S.C. |
forward, tossed from the game by
Referee Jim Smith early in the sec
ond half and Stanford knotted the
count at 2-2 on goals by Dave
Nottage and Plate.
Frary continued to entertain shady
methods on his man, Nottage, when- j
ever the referee's attention was di- !
rected the other way. He finally
caused the game to be held up, and
during the course of the time out, !
Jim Sellers of U.S.C., irritated by |
what he thought was drifting on the j
part of Plate, slugged the Stanford
captain. Called from the game, Sel- |
lers left Plate unguarded and the 1
latter scored. j
Play was rough all the way, and it
contrasted to a fine bit of sportsman
ship employed by Bill Sutton of
Fullerton J.C. in the preliminary,
won by the Stanford junior varsity.

The game went into - an extra 1
three-minute period with the count
at three-all. Bruce Jessup of Stan- 1
ford was called from the game when
