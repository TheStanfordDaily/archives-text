### 
PHOENIX. Ariz., Oct. 29 (UP).—
Governor Robert T. Junes abandoned
his plans for a vacation in Oregon
tonight and headed home to press
his inquiry into the increasingly
mysterious disappearance of Winnie
Ruin Judd.
The Governor, who had been in
Sim Francisco attending a confer
ence, authorized a $100 reward for
information leading to her capture
and said he still believed she had
not gone far—despite the fact she
fled the state insane asylum here last
Tuesday night.
