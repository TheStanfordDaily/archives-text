KEZAR STADIUM, San Francisco,
Oct. 29 (UP). â€”University of Port
land, a team on which you could
have got odds of 10 to 1 a few hours
ago, walloped proud St. Mary's 14-12
today in their annual football game
before a sparse handful of 3.000 fans.
To St. Mary's, a team which had
national championship aspirations up
to a few weeks ago, it was like the
New York Yankees losing in the
Western International League.
The oldest Spanish university is
that of Salamanca.
