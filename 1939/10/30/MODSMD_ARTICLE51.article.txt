### 
! CHICAGO, Oct. 2!) (UP). â€” De
troit's Lions crushed virtually the
I last hope of the Chicago Bears for a
berth in the National Professional
1 Football League play-offs today with
| a 10 to 0 victory on the soggy turf
at Wrigley Field.
For GO minutes the ulcrt Lions de
| fcnse kept the high-scoring Bears
j throttled so completely their only
i defensive thrust was a feeble field
I goal attempt by Jack Manders in
the closing seconds of the first half.
A crowd of 35,000 huddled in the
cold and rain to see the Bears held
I scoreless for the first, time this sea
i son. Victory for the Lions kept
; them in a first place tie with the
Green Bay Packers in the western
i division standings wiih five victories
and one defeat. It was the third loss
j of the year for the Bears.
