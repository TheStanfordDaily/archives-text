# Democracy Downstage

STANFORD was sick and tired of the old
Assembly Hall. It wanted a new theater.
It was back in 1929 that 20 members of the
local chapter of Hammer and Coffin got together
and contributed five dollars each to start a drive
to build one. By the close of that unforgettable
year $3,684 had been collected, chiefly from
student sources.
This was a small beginning. But at the same
time the University had gathered $162,555 in
a fund for building a World War memorial, and
it was decided that the two projects should be
combined.
By the dark, depression days of 1933 the stu
dents realized that if they ever were going to
have a theater, they would have to finance it
themselves. In a special A.S.S.U. election they
voted to pay for the structure by adding one
dollar to the then $114 tuition and community
fee.
Memorial Hall was ready for use in the sum
mer of 1937. Undaunted by the thought that
they would be paying for it until 1960 provided
registration and Union profits kept up to par,
students flocked to the theater to see the first
fall guarter production.
And they came away disgusted.
Yes, the ultramodern building was fitted with
the finest eguipment. Yes, the performance was
a masterpiece of artistic lighting and staging.
But the play itself, "Murder in the Cathedral,"
was a terrific bore.
The Gilbert and Sullivan curtainraiser seemed
only an excuse for the lengthy verse drama
which had everyone who was awake sguirming
in his seat.
"Is this what we worked so hard to get?" the
students asked.
But they kept on payingâ€”and the Division of
Speech and Drama continued to present its
plays with little or no regard for their audience
appeal. And most of the students did not come
to see them.
The problem was an acute one at the begin
ning of this quarter when Professor Hubert
Heffner arrived at Stanford to take charge of the
Division. Sensing the trouble, he decided to
remedy it by the most effective means possible
letting the student body select its own plays.
Throughout this week the Speech and Drama
office will be open for suggestions. Those that
do not present insurmountable technical or
financial difficulties will be listed in The Daily,
and a vote will be taken next Friday.
Nothing could be more practical, nothing
more just.
Now the students can get entertainment which
they feel will compensate for the extra dollar
every Reg Day and the high prices of Union
meals.
