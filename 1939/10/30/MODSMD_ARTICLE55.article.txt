# Peace — It's Wonderful
## 
### 
THERE was a time when pacifists and con
scientious objectors were placed in the same
category with anarchists and nihilists — and
were dismissed with sneers or packed off to
prison. That was 22 years and more ago.
Today sentiment on the subject is slightly
different. Most Americans of fighting age either
remember the last war or have spent most of
their years with people who lived through it.
Europe is engaged in another struggle, and on
this side of the Atlantic the feeling against going
to war is extremely strong, especially among
young people.
A group of students at experimental, pro
gressive Antioch College are attempting to or
ganize a national mobilization for peace, an
army of young men of draft age which, in
case of emergency, would protest to Congress
against declaring war, and if it were ignored,
would refuse to support it.
The prospectus of the group includes actual
plans for organizing local, regional, and na
tional units of such an army and for mobilizing
it in state capitals and in Washington, D.C., in
case of need.
The plan is radical and visionary, to say the

least. But it indicates an important change in
the American attitude, a change which may
help to keep us out of the present war.
Such an organization as the peace army
would have been unthinkable in 1917.
But today, in 1939, it is on the point of being.
