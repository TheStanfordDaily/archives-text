ONE way that a university can achieve prac
ticality in public life, one that it may
make itself felt by the common citizen, is to
conduct a research into an important phase of
national life, such as big business, politics, or
farming.
Results of such searching analysis, made with
all the facilities at the disposal of a university,
are bound to have value.
And when such a research project is actually
underwritten by the subjects of the analysis,
then it appears that the university, as a public
adviser, has come into its own.
Last week, 12 Pacific Coast corporations were
announced as underwriters of a $40,000 search
into American corporate methods, to be con
ducted by professors of the Stanford School of
Business. On the assumption that corporations
do not throw away money, this means that the
companies involved expect to get $40,000 worth
of information out of the year-long project.
It is significant that, expecting these results,
they support a university project instead of hir
ing their own experts.
The research will be national in scope, the
deans conferring with executives in Mid-West,
Eastern, and Western cities. Conclusions of
the survey will therefore be important to cor
porations throughout the nation as well as to
the local sponsors.
To the companies which co-operate in the
survey will go confidential reports of the find
ings—to the public-at-large will accrue the bene
fits through more efficient management of in
dustry.—J. B.
