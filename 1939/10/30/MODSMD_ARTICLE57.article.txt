'"THIS morning's front page heralds a long-sought
move in Stanford dramatics. The campus-wide
poll to find out what, the Farm wants its theater to
produce foretells two things: first, increased popu
larity of the Stanford Players, and second, a vigorous,
progressive spirit in the new drama department that
may well make Memorial Hall one of the nation's
leading dramatic centers.
This spirited attitude is being encouraged by an
energetic, personable executive whom Stanford is learn
ing to respect. Hubert Heffner, new head of the De
partment of Speech and Drama, is genuinely anxious
to give Stanford what it has been asking for: "dra
matics to match Memorial Hall." And anyone who
has ever talked to Heffner, knows that he will.
He is a pleasant-voiced, courteous man, with the
suggestion of a southern drawl. But under.the polish
is energy and activity. The unusual combination—ac
tive brains and smooth diplomacy—makes an admin
istrator. And that's what Stanford drama needs.

IITEFFNER has a rich background in dramatics, from
both the technical and artistic view. He is well
equipped to make the Stanford Players successful, as
he made Northwestern's drama department nationally
outstanding before coining here.
Naturally, the building program that Stanford con
templates will take time. That Rome wasn't built in a
day is rather acutely a matter of general information.
That trite platitude always sandpapers a person's skin
when no building is being done at all. One even hates
to hear someone say, "I will do my best." That, after
all, is what, every political failure boasts, even though
he is usually right.
But the building of Stanford's drama department
has already begun. Professor Heffner's "best" is ap
parently well worth while. It may take a long time to
achieve the acme. But good entertainment will be
coming all the time. And Stanford will be working
toward nation-wide excellence.
Heffner and the campus can build Stanford's Rome.
