# CAMPUS OPINION
## SHALT THOU KILL? 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIK:
With reference to Mr. MellinkofT's article in Oc
tober 24th. "Thou Shalt Not Kill." I do not question
the sincerity of his contentions, however, I am certain
and at the same time grateful that it is not the opinion
of all the people in this country that the state has
the absolute right to take the life of one of its members
without iust cause.
But there are certain just causes which do exist;
such as taking the life of an individual who has been
found guilty of murder following a trial by jury. The
taking of this individual's life by the state is accom
plished to establish justice and also as a measure in
defense of society.
It is easily recognizable that the idiots to which
Mr. Mellinkoff refers have committed no act against
society which would warrant taking their life as in
the case of a criminal.
♦ * ♦ *
r |"MIE commandment which was given by God, "Thou
shalt not kill," goes back long before Medieval days
(a fact of which Mr. Mellinkoff should be fully aware);
and the same God also commanded, "Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself." We are therefore obligated
to care for these individuals as we are those indi
viduals lacking the necessities of life throughout our
country. Through various charitable agencies, more
and more families are being cared for in the United
States.
The contention that these idiots should be exter
minated is not the representative of American thought,
but rather of Communistic and Fascistic principles
which maintain the doctrine that the state exercises
absolute right over the life of individuals. Unques
tionably we would have a better world in which to live
if we thought more deeply about the commandment,
"Thou shalt not kill," and its full implications.
It would seem but reasonable that God allows these
so-called idiots to exist so that we might b" given an
opportunity to exercise our charity and in doing this,
attempt to fulfill the equally imporant commandment,
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
Sincerely yours,
A. M. D. G.
