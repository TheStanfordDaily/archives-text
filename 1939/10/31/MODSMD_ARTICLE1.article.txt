### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
Congress pondered meth
ods of keeping America out of
war, the nations of Europe were
angling just as surely to involve the
United States in war.
Independent little Finland, after
stalling negotiations with Russia for
more than two weeks, is finally
ready to send its final answer to
Moscow today. And, side by side
with the reply to Mr. V. Molotov is
the persistent rumor that Finland is
definitely preparing for the possibil
ity of United States participation in
an arbitration move if a direct set
tlement is impossible.
This statement, in itself, indicates
that small Finland's agreement with
big Russia may not be the mere
routine approval of an underling at
the command of a domineering boss.
After refusing to play ball with
Stalin when he demanded an iron
bound non-aggression and mutual
assistance pact, fortification of stra
tegic islands by the Soviet army, and
virtual protectorate control of the
country, Finland's reply should star
tle Europe today.
$ * *
the other hand, Finland may
be sufficiently intimidated to
acquiesce to Russian ultimatums.
Since she's capitalizing on the
United States' interest in the little,
war-debt-paying power by subtly
suggesting that America will go to
bat for her "if a direct settlement is
impossible," the odds are pretty
strong that Finland will see to it
that a direct settlement is impos
sible.
The Finnish government an
nounced that it had obtained com
plete parliamentary approval of
the answer to Russia—whatever it
may be. The Finnish answer will
be carried back to Moscow by
former Premier Juhu K. I'aasi
kivi. And the long, stubborn ne
gotiations will reach their climax
when Stalin and Molotov, in their
Kremlin sanctum, break the wax
seal on the court* official docu
ment that Paasikivi will hand
them today.
Because President Roosevelt, in
his recent note of moral support of
Finland and in his approval of the
Stockholm conference of Baltic pow
ers, asked to be kept abreast of the
negotiations, it seems certain that if
the Moscow talks approach a crisis
an arbitration commission will be
set up. And, in that event, the
United States embassy will be con
sulted immediately.
* Hi *
yY T tlu ' same time, Finland, like
a minor Stanford committee
hovering around a somewhat be
nevolent but easily aroused Ex
com, will be exquisitely careful
not to irritate Stalin and Molotov
needlessly. Therefore, any direct
efforts to communicate with Roo
sevelt from Helsingfors or Moscow
will be promptly stifled.
In connection with the specula
tion as to possible arbitration that
has flared like heat-lightning over
rumor-ridden Europe, Finland's re
ply, European observers believe,
will stress a certain provision of the
1932 Finnish-Soviet non-aggression
pact . Those were the days when Fin
land and Russia were good pals.
Russia didn't "covet, her neighbors'
land and Finland, though never
very trusting, looked up to big
brother Russia for a reasonably
square deal. Under clause 5 of their
mutual good will pact, they included
a provision for an arbitration com
mission in case disputes should
arise.
* * *
This is what Finland will point to.
She'll say, "Remember clause 5."
And, looking hopefully toward her
friend across the ocean, the greatest
neutral nation of a world where so
called neutral nations are plentiful,
she'll try very diligently to convince
President Roosevelt that it's high
time he helped Baltic powers settle
their differences with the Soviets.
And Congress, sitting in special
session in Washington, will try
very diligently to make a famous
phrase of Wilson's become polit
ical actuality.

friend across the ocean, the greatest
neutral nation of a world where so
called neutral nations are plentiful,
she'll try very diligently to convince
President Roosevelt that it's high

Independent little Finland, after
stalling negotiations with Russia for
more than two weeks, is finally

Moscow today. And, side by side
with the reply to Mr. V. Molotov is
the persistent rumor that Finland is
definitely preparing for the possibil
ity of United States participation in
an arbitration move if a direct set
tlement is impossible.
This statement, in itself, indicates
that small Finland's agreement with
big Russia may not be the mere
routine approval of an underling at
the command of a domineering boss.
After refusing to play ball with
Stalin when he demanded an iron
bound non-aggression and mutual
assistance pact, fortification of stra

virtual protectorate control of the
country, Finland's reply should star

acquiesce to Russian ultimatums.
Since she's capitalizing on the

war-debt-paying power by subtly
suggesting that America will go to
bat for her "if a direct settlement is
impossible," the odds are pretty
strong that Finland will see to it
that a direct settlement is impos
sible.
The Finnish government an
nounced that it had obtained com
plete parliamentary approval of
the answer to Russia—whatever it
may be. The Finnish answer will
be carried back to Moscow by

gotiations will reach their climax
when Stalin and Molotov, in their
Kremlin sanctum, break the wax
