# Excom to Vote On Dance Plans
## Dress Style to Be Major Consideration 
### 
Boiled shirts vs. dark suits for the
Big Game dance is Ex Conmittee's
most important decision at tonight's
meeting, according to President Ken
Cuthbertson.
Although Cardinals, a subcommit
tee of the executive body, makes
routine arrangements for all A.S.S.U.
dances, Cuthbertson said yesterday
he thought this was a matter in
which Ex Committee ought to have
something to say.
He said several students had spo
ken to him during the last few days
advocating a formal dance. On the
other hand, he said, mandatory tuxes
would be likely to discourage at
tendance at the dance.
Other business tonight will in
clude an appointment to Speakers'
Bureau. A new manager for the
men's activity card file also will be
appointed. Lyle Cook, present man
ager, is too busy academically to
handle the job, according to Cuth
bertson.
