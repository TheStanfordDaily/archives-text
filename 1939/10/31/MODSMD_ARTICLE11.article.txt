# House to Consider Neutrality Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30 (UP). â€”
The House begins consideration of
the administration's Neutrality Re
vision Bill tomorrow under a rule
which does not fix the length of de
bate but which would deny mem
bers the right to amend the legisla
tion as approved last week by the
Senate.
The rule, approved by a strict par
tisan vote of 8 to 4 by the Rules
Committee, was assailed by Repub
licans as the "most vicious gag in
history" and as making "puppets" of
the congressmen.
