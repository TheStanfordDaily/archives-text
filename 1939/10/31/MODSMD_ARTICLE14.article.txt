# 'Independent' Study Spurs Wider Culture
## 
### BUD AMES 
Cultivation of writing and reading
ability; development of the ability
to converse intelligently on subjects
of interest to the college man; co
operation between the student and
the faculty—Stanford's Independent
Study Plan has sought these funda
mentals—successfully—for fourteen
years.
According to Edgar E. Robinson,
head of the plan, independent study
is not a free-for-all as was the im
pression a few years ago. In reality,
the independent student is held on a
stricter, broader level of study—but
he is freer to develop his mind. The
plan is seeking and finding Stan
ford's superior students.
RESEMBLES TUTORING
The plan came into being back in
1925 during an era of honor plans,
centering on comprehensive exami
nations. These honor plans, insti
tuted in the East, resembled basically
a type cf tutoring system. Stanford's
system goes a step farther, is unique,
in that it emphasizes more an indi
vidual plan of study for each student.
Who founded the Farm's inde
pendent study plan? A committee of
faculty members seeking a way in
which to arou.se the intellectual in
terests of the superior student, who,
incidentally, is not selected for his
grades alone.
ABILITY RECOGNIZED
Arid these committee members
represent several and well-diversi
fied fields of study. As such, the
committee is well able to recognize
the over-all intellectual ability of
the student seeking or doing inde
j pendent work. Fourteen depart -
j ments of the University have ac
j cepted the plan.
Numerically, 2.200 Stanford stu
| dents have had some form of inde-
I pendent; study during the last eight
years. Every year approximately
250 or 300 carry some independent
j work, the majority of this number
j being in the lower division.
In essence these 300 are divided
up among the,three basic types of
I independent study: (1) Individual
i projects in the upper division, with
I a comprehensive, oral final exami
nation. (2) Study within a depart
ment in the upper division, consist
ing mostly of reading. (3) Lower
division work within courses; spe
j cial groups doing a good deal of
I writing and discussion.
j The question will naturally arise
J as to just how to get on independent
I study. Such can be done either by
j referring to an instructor in a given
! course, or by applying to the Inde
i pendent Study Committee.
And the committee sincerely hopes
I to expand. If the University had the
! facilities, this advanced type of work
j could be extended to twice the pres-
I ent number. It is the hope of the
! committee that in the future they
will be able to offer the expanded
advantages of independent study to
many more.

RESEMBLES TUTORING
The plan came into being back in
1925 during an era of honor plans,
centering on comprehensive exami
nations. These honor plans, insti
tuted in the East, resembled basically
a type cf tutoring system. Stanford's
system goes a step farther, is unique,
in that it emphasizes more an indi
vidual plan of study for each student.
Who founded the Farm's inde
pendent study plan? A committee of
faculty members seeking a way in
which to arou.se the intellectual in
terests of the superior student, who,
incidentally, is not selected for his
grades alone.
ABILITY RECOGNIZED
Arid these committee members
represent several and well-diversi
fied fields of study. As such, the
committee is well able to recognize
the over-all intellectual ability of
the student seeking or doing inde
j pendent work. Fourteen depart -
j ments of the University have ac
j cepted the plan.
Numerically, 2.200 Stanford stu
| dents have had some form of inde-
I pendent; study during the last eight
years. Every year approximately
250 or 300 carry some independent
j work, the majority of this number
j being in the lower division.
In essence these 300 are divided
up among the,three basic types of
I independent study: (1) Individual
i projects in the upper division, with
I a comprehensive, oral final exami
nation. (2) Study within a depart
ment in the upper division, consist
ing mostly of reading. (3) Lower
division work within courses; spe
j cial groups doing a good deal of
I writing and discussion.
j The question will naturally arise
J as to just how to get on independent
I study. Such can be done either by
j referring to an instructor in a given
! course, or by applying to the Inde
i pendent Study Committee.
And the committee sincerely hopes
I to expand. If the University had the
! facilities, this advanced type of work
j could be extended to twice the pres-
I ent number. It is the hope of the
! committee that in the future they
will be able to offer the expanded
advantages of independent study to
many more.
Cultivation of writing and reading
ability; development of the ability
to converse intelligently on subjects
of interest to the college man; co
operation between the student and
the faculty—Stanford's Independent
Study Plan has sought these funda
mentals—successfully—for fourteen
years.
According to Edgar E. Robinson,
head of the plan, independent study
is not a free-for-all as was the im
pression a few years ago. In reality,
the independent student is held on a
stricter, broader level of study—but
he is freer to develop his mind. The
plan is seeking and finding Stan
ford's superior students.
