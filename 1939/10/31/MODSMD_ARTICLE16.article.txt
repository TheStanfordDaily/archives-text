# S.C. Rail Ducat Sales Continue
## A.S.S.U. Sells 106 Fares on First Day 
### 
One hundred and six of the spe
cially-priced rail tickets for students
planning to attend the U.S.C.-Stan
ford game were sold yesterday at
the A.S.S.U. office, according to Miss
Inez Stevens, A.S.S.U. secretary. The
sale will continue until noon of Fri
day. Nov. 10, the day before the
game.
If more than the regular allow
ance of 308 students, including the
band, wish to purchase tickets, the
train will be run in two sections,
according to Mr. John Hankinson,
Southern Pacific agent.
Those purchasing tickets first will
be assigned to the first section; any
one who especially wishes to be on
the first train should get his tickets
this morning, said Miss Stevens.
The special trains have proved
very popular with Farm students
ever since they were first used to
take rooters to Los Angeles games.
Last year 198 took advantage of the
offer for the U.C.L.A. game, and the
year before, when the Cards invaded
the Trojan home ground, more than
600 were served, according to Mr.
Hankinson.
