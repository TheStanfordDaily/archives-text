COPENHAGEN. Denmark, Oct. 30
(UP) —The captured American
freighter City of Flint, with the Nazi
swastika flying from her mast,
steamed out of the Norwegian port
of Tromsoe late today and headed
toward a German port through the
perils of Great Britain's naval
blockade.
Captain Joseph A. Gainard and his
American crew of 40 men were
prisoners aboard their ship as it set
out to run the gauntlet of British
warships in the North Sea with a
German prize crew in command,
Tromsoe dispatches said.
HEADS FOR STORM
The City of Flint put out into a
rainy and heavy sea at 4 p.m., sup
posedly heading down the Skagerrak
into the mine-infested waters of
the Danish Straits.
The City of Flint, captured in the
Atlantic on Oct. 9 by the sea-raid
ing German pocket battleship
Deutschland. arrived in Tromsoe
shortly after noon today from the
Russian port of Murmansk on the
Arctic Sea, where it was interned
temporarily until Soviet authorities
turned it back to the German prize
crew.
The American ship, putting in a
second appearance at Tromsoe since
its capture, came into the Norwe
gian northern port under the Nazi
flag and asked Norwegian authorities
to notify the German consul supplies
were needed.
CREW FOUND ON BOARD
The consul, Henrik Jebens, went
aboard the vessel, found the Ameri
can crew on board, and talked with
the Germans.
Norwegian authorities, reluctant
to become involved in a situation
which already has stirred up Amer
ican indignation against both Ger
many and Russia, ordered the vessel
to be taken out of the Tromsoe roads
without delay.
The City of Flint sailed—without
taking on supplies of any kind—at
4 p.m., Consul Jebens said, with a
Norwegian warship escorting the
ship out of territorial waters.
