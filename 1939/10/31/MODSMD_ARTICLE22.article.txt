NEW YORK, Oct. 30 (UP).â€”Tin
stock market entered its seventh
week of stalemate today with an
other dull and unimpressive per
formance that left final prices about
unchanged from Saturday's closing
levels.
Sales dwindled to 640.000 shares,
smallest in nearly two weeks, from
1,000,000 in the last full session on
Friday.
