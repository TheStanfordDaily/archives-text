# Art of Deception to Be Topic of Lecture Tonight
## Tuesday Evening Series Presents Benedict's Magical Demonstrations 
### 
"Science and the Art of Deception," illustrated with special magical ef
fects, will l>e the subject of the lecture by Dr. Francis Benedict tonight in
Memorial Hall. The lecture, wbicb has been given by Dr. Benedict in
many European cities and several American universities, was given at
the University of California last night.

Dr. Benedict will expose the false<
security placed in so-called magical
controls, whose frailties have been
demonstrated by repeated experi
ments, and show how the attention
of observers is misdirected.
OUTLINE GIVEN
The detailed outline of the lecture
as published by the Committee on
Public Exercises is ds follows:
1. The significance of surprise in
magic as paralleling the sudden ap
pearance of phenomena in scientific
research.
2. The role of misdirection as
bearing on the psychology of ob
servations.
STRONG LIGHT USED
3. The accomplishment of the
seemingly impossible by means not
involving elaborate stage settings,
special cabinets, colored and figured
backdrops, miscellaneous parapher
nalia. In this topic all action takes
place in strongest light and under
close observation of "audience rep
resentatives."
4. The repetition (four times) in a
form ever-increasing in complexity,
of a seeming violation of a natural
law with the same basic results, i
This sequence is presented to favor
the observer by removing the ele- |
inent of confusion in following the j
usual rapid-fire program of magic. |
5. Finally, several original effects i
to stress the uncertainty of relying
on conventional "controls" no mat- |
tor how rigidly they are seemingly j
applied.

degree in 185)4. The following year
he went abroad and received his 1

WINSLOW, Ariz., Oct. 30 (UP).—
Five persons from Long Beach, Cal.,
driving east on a vacation, were
killed today when their automobile
hit a bridge five miles from Winslow

"Science and the Art of Deception," illustrated with special magical ef

Memorial Hall. The lecture, wbicb has been given by Dr. Benedict in
many European cities and several American universities, was given at

of observers is misdirected.
