graduate and undergraduate NYA
workers to sign their monthly re
lease cards, Mrs. Irene Coveriey of
the Student Employment Office an
nounced in a final warning.
Because NYA work for this year is
not yet adjusted, the time limit for
this month's cards has been ex
tended until today. Hereafter fail
ure to sign between the 24th and
27th of each month will eliminate
students from the payroll, as these
cards are the only record.
One call for a four or five-piece
orchestra to play from 9 to 1 o'clock
tonight is still unfilled, as well as
two jobs for a six-piece band for
Big Game night from 8 to 3 o'clock.
Orchestra managers interested in
these calls are asked to notify Mrs.
Coveriey promptly.
A campus representative position
for the spoils section of a San Fran
cisco department store is open to
girls with merchandising interests
who are free to work in the store
on Saturdays. Completing the lists
of calls are four hashing jobs.
