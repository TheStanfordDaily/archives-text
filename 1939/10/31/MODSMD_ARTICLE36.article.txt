# Farm Battles Riveting Din As War Libe Rises
## Workmen Promise Lessening of Noise Within Two Weeks 
### WAYNE WILSON 
Symbolic of the document's which
the Hoover War Library will house,
workmen are waging a battle of
construction as the machine-gun din
of riveting sounds over the campus.
The noise is a constant reminder
to those attempting study in the
Stanford Library of the 274-foot
peace monument that will rise above
the campus next year.
Although students in west Encina
rooms and the Stanford Library can
not expect peaceful studying for
several months, workmen promise
that the noise will lessen during the
next two weeks as the workers move
higher above the ground.
As the riveters work on the first
level, steel workers are bolting the
girders together on the fourth level
of the structure.
The $000,000 building when com
pleted will be the only one of its
kind in the world and will house
the famed collection of photographs,
maps, books, and papers compiled by
Ex-President Herbert Hoover.
The five million documents will
include the Ray Lyman Wilbur col
lection on social problems, the Hoo
ver personal archives, the collections
of the Russian Revolution Institute,
and the German Revolution Insti
tute.
The Hoover collection was started
after the Armistice when Mr. Hoo
ver received the library of Great
Britain's Ministry of Information.
