# Injury Puts Kerman Out For Season
## Tiny Predicts Line-up Changes; Scrimmages To Be Held Secretly 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Johnny Kerman probably will not
play again this season.
Tiny Thornhill said yesterday that I
the junior left guard, who fell heir
to the first-string post when Hanip
Pool moved to quarter, injured his j
knee in the Washington game, and
is not likely to see action again this i
year.
Candidates for Kerman's position 1
are Steve Keussel and Bill Braheny. j
Both are one-year lettermen, but j
neither has played regularly.
BHore practice yesterday Tiny said
that he also expected to give Claude j
Purkitt a crack at the job. Purkitt, i

wlio weighs around 230 and is fast i
for his size, has been working at J
fourth' string tackle most of the I
year.
fhor Peterson is the only other j
Indian not expected to be ready to
lace Santa Clara Saturday. Peter
son was out watching practice yes- j
terday, but is still hampered by rib 1
injuries received in scrimmage 10 1
days ago.
For the first time this season, the |
gates ol the practice field will be I
barred this week, and the Cards will '
have secret practice. Light workouts -
are on tap until Wednesday, when a '
scrimmage is tentatively scheduled. I
In practice yesterday the line-up, |
with the exception of Kerman and j
Donahue, was the same as the one i
that opened against the Huskies. !
Tiny intimated, however, that some '
changes might be made before his '
team meets the Broncos.
