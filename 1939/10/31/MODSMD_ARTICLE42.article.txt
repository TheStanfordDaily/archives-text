### JERRY MAYER 
Slants thinks that the following
letter received by Jack Gillean,
sports editor of the Southern Cali
fornia Daily Trojan, and published
in his column, will be of interest to
Stanfordites. The letter reads as
follows, with one unimportant para
graph omitted:
Sir:
This is intended as a notice that
a lengthy resolution is being cir
culated among the various alumni
of the Pacific Coast Conference
schools, with the exception of the
University of Southern California,
and which, when completed, will
be presented to the conference
urging them to request the with
drawal of the University of South
ern California from the confer
ence.
We are a group of 24 alumni
representing four of the coast
schools, and are working entirely
upon our own responsibility. We
have secured almost 300 signa
tures in the Los Angeles area, and
a petition is now in circulation in
San Francisco and Oakland. We
hope to have workers in Portland
and Seattle within a week.
Our reasons for the request in
clude: (1) It is our contention that
the Trojan team no longer is in
tlje same classification with other
amateur teams representing the
other schools. We are of the
opinion that they should make
their own independent schedule,
possibly including games with
some of the professional teams.
(2) We criticize methods used in
several games. We have evidence
supporting this contention which
we do not feel free to make pub
lic now. including the penalties so
far secured by the Trojans in
comparison with their opponents.
We refer to more serious penal
ties than "off-side" ones. (3) We
object to the custom of Troy of
"pouring it on" as exemplified by
the 74-0 against California, high
scores in the past against Oregon.
Pittsburgh, and other teams. We
feel there is no justification or
sportsmanship in such tactics.
We hope to be able to complete
this before the Rose Bowl team is
chosen.

comments: "The only thing on
which 1 do agree with B.J. is the
fact that the Trojan team no longer
is in the same class with other ama
teur teams."
As we see it, the Trojans are only
doing for their athletes what all the
other schools would like to be able
to do.

far secured by the Trojans in
comparison with their opponents.
We refer to more serious penal
ties than "off-side" ones. (3) We
object to the custom of Troy of
"pouring it on" as exemplified by
the 74-0 against California, high
scores in the past against Oregon.
Pittsburgh, and other teams. We
feel there is no justification or
sportsmanship in such tactics.
We hope to be able to complete
this before the Rose Bowl team is
chosen.

comments: "The only thing on
which 1 do agree with B.J. is the
fact that the Trojan team no longer
is in the same class with other ama
teur teams."
As we see it, the Trojans are only
doing for their athletes what all the
other schools would like to be able
to do.
Slants thinks that the following
letter received by Jack Gillean,
sports editor of the Southern Cali
fornia Daily Trojan, and published
in his column, will be of interest to
Stanfordites. The letter reads as
follows, with one unimportant para
graph omitted:
Sir:
This is intended as a notice that
a lengthy resolution is being cir
culated among the various alumni
of the Pacific Coast Conference
schools, with the exception of the
University of Southern California,
and which, when completed, will
be presented to the conference
urging them to request the with
drawal of the University of South
ern California from the confer
ence.
We are a group of 24 alumni
representing four of the coast
schools, and are working entirely
upon our own responsibility. We
have secured almost 300 signa
tures in the Los Angeles area, and
a petition is now in circulation in
San Francisco and Oakland. We
hope to have workers in Portland
and Seattle within a week.
Our reasons for the request in
clude: (1) It is our contention that
the Trojan team no longer is in
tlje same classification with other
amateur teams representing the
other schools. We are of the
opinion that they should make
their own independent schedule,
possibly including games with
some of the professional teams.
(2) We criticize methods used in
several games. We have evidence
supporting this contention which
we do not feel free to make pub
lic now. including the penalties so
far secured by the Trojans in
comparison with their opponents.
