# Varsity, Frosh Water Dogs Point for Dual Wins Friday
## Double-header to Feature Tussle With San Jose; Bob Allen Still Out 
### 
VVitli bolstered prestige in the conference, Stanford's varsity water
polo seven teams off with San Jose Slate tomorrow night in the Spartan
pool. The frosh will make it a double-header.
The game will he a warm-up for a return match with the Olympic
Club Friday night in San FrancUco. At least, it should be a warm-up

according to the score of the first <
meeting of the two teams, but a new j
problem will present itself to the!
Indians at the number two get- i
together.
PLUNGE IS SHALLOW
The Cardinals' 6 to 2 victory three
weeks ago happened in Encina pool. I
The local water hole is deep from '
one end to the other, but State's;
plunge is shallow at one extreme.
It is a foul to touch the bottom of ,
the pool, and to players not used to |
such a set-up it is sometimes difli- '
cult to keep from doing this. The
20-yard length of the course creates '
a new shooting problem for the In- :
dians.
To aid in solving the problem Nort J
Thornton is working his men out in j
the diving pool, which is 5 yards
shorter than the regular pool.
JUNIOR GAME SLATED
Friday night's contest, which will
also have a junior varsity game on
the bill, offers a chance for a Stan
ford comeback. Thornton's charges
lost a 5 to 3 decision to the O. C.
mermen last Saturday. For three
seasons such has been the case in
the first meeting of the teams. But
the Cards always come back in the
Winged "O" pool—at least they have
every time thus far.
In the meantime Thornton an
nounced that although Centerback
Bob Allen is still out, he was more
than pleased with Duncan Patty's
play against U.S.C. when Stanford
came back into the title picture with
a 3 to 2 win.
