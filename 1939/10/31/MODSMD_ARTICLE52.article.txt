WHEN a person comes to Stanford, he be
comes more than a registered student.
He becomes, in effect, a citizen of the Univer
sity. And when he accepts his citizenship, he
assumes certain unescapable obligations along
with it.
As a member of the community, he is also a
representative of it. And whether he likes it
or not, Stanford is going to be judged by the
way he acts.
Situated on 9,000 acres of its own property,
one mile from the nearest town, the University
does not often have to listen to the local citi
zenry protest against the actions of its student
body.
Several years ago the University of Califor
nia was forced to abandon its traditional Big
Game rally because over-enthusiastic students
insisted on letting off steam by wrecking Berke
ley property. The police force was unable to
meet the situation, the taxpayers clamored for
justice, and the Cal men were left hanging on
to the short end of the deal.
As long as Stanford keeps within its gates, it
does not have to worry about the Palo Alto
citizens. But it must consider the large number
of private families, faculty and otherwise, that
make their homes on the campus.
Undergraduate disturbances are annoying to
them—and at the same time they are harmful
to the University. They create the impression
that student government is incapable of main
taining law and order.
Should such discord arise, and should the
outside world get word of it, Stanford would
become a laughing-stock—just as Cal was when
its "Razzberry Press" hit the headlines.
With football season and Hell Week occur
ring in the same quarter, the danger of public
disturbance is greater now than at any other
time. And the newspapers are that much more
anxious to get hold of stories about "those crazy
college kids."
Let the man who starts a campus riot remem
ber this:
He is stabbing Stanford in the back.
