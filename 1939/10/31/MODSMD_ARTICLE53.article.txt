THREE years ago when Gordon C. Lange was
directing plays in the old Assembly Hall and
putting on things like the American premiere of
"This Side Idolatry," and then the next year
when "Murder in the Cathedral" opened Memo
rial Hall, people were beginning to say that
Stanford was the Yale of the West.
Now always before that Stanford had been
perfectly content to be known as the Harvard
of the West. There were some who did not
like this new conversion. And there were a
great many people who did not like the uncom
fortable feeling that they should be dressed
either in full dress or a beret to properly enjoy
the plays.
And it is a little unfair, but reasonably typical
of last year's dramatic program, to mention the
man in the fourth row at "A Night's Lodging."
It was between scenes, and he was worn out
with the heaviness of the drama (in other plays
last year it might have been with dullness). He
said, "I don't care what Mr. Bunn says. When
this is over I'm going to get a glass of beer."
But this year drama at Stanford is going to
be as it should be; it is going to fulfill the one

requirement worthy of its existence at all: it is
going to be entertaining.
It is, if yesterday is any indication. Acting on
his announced program, Professor Hubert Heff
ner and the entire staff of the Division of Speech
and Drama collected and carefully investigated
the list of 87 plays contributed by the campus
at large. Then looking up the royalties on them,
the number of sets needed to produce them,
and the number of characters included in the
cast, they boiled these down to 17 plays which
could be successfully put on in Memorial Hall.
Eighty-seven plays narrowed down to 17 in
one day is a good day's work for any staff. But
Professor Heffner would like to have at least 25
plays on the ballot in The Daily Friday—out of
25 plays the campus should be able to find at
least one it would like to see.
But to get 25 plays on that ballot means one
thing: the campus has to turn in to the dramatics
office a list of more plays, plays it knows and
likes.
And then Friday, to keep this year's drama
season from merely fluctuating a little above
and a little below mediocrity, it has to vote on
the one play it wants. More than one-tenth of
the campus has to vote, that is.
Seeing the play will come later. Only it will
call for no editorial urging the campus to at
tend. It will be a pleasure—for a change—not
a duty.—D. J.
