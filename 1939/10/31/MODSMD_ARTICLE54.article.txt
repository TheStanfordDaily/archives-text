LOVE THY NEIGHBOR
jyiERCY-KILLINGS involve a highly controversial
subject, packed with emotion and argument. A
case for the affirmative was presented by this column
last week, advocating that permanently hopeless and
helpless idiots, doomed at birth to a mis-shapen life
below the mental level of animals, should be pain
lessly ended. There are reasons that people advance
against such ideas. Among them are the practicality
of the program, the question as to who will decide
who should be killed, and religious conviction.
But the arguments employed by yesterday's Cam
pus Opinioner, it seems to me, only strengthened the
conviction that it is more humane to end the useless
existence of nature's distorted batter. Our critic be
gins by saying that it is perfectly all right for the
state to take the lives of murderers. She justifies exe
cution on the grounds that "the criminal has com
mitted an act against society," thereby implying that
human beings are capable of deciding who should die
and who should not. She claims this is "justice," and
yet she must be aware that justice is just a word
which we define according to our own beliefs.

jy/lURDERERS, just like idiots and all of us. are prod
ucts of their heredity and their environment. But
Campus Opinioner seems to think that there is some
fundamental reason why men are authorities on who
should die in cases where normal, redeemable men
have erred, but that mortals are not' morally entitled
to end the un-redeemable lives of idiot. There are
only two differences in the two cases. The first is that
execution is dii'ected at whole, healthy minds and
bodies who have transgressed a great law, and that
mercy-killing is directed against hopeless mental
ciphers. The second difference is that mercy-killing
is a relatively new idea, whereas execution is a mod
ern inheritance from primitive times.
Campus Opinioner's accusation that humane killing
is CommunLstc or FascLstic is as relevant as is the city
hall of Timbuctoo. As far as we know, neither Hitler
nor Stalin originated the concept of killing idiots. The
habit of calling every thing we don't agree with a
message from Berlin or Moscow is much more un-
American than is mercy-killing.
Finally, Campus Opinioner lakes refuge in the self
purifying thought that God has sent idiots on the
earth so that we can practice charity. From this it fol
lows, too, that God has sent two-headed monsters,
tortured paralytics, cancerous hearts, war, and bubonic
pague to the earth so that we can "exercise our char
ity" on the victims.
This sort of rationalization of the word's suffering
is a peculiar way for us to follow Campus Opinioner's
quoted suggestion—Love thy neighbor.
