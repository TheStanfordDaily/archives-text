# CAMPUS OPINION
## THEY TOOK THE AXE

r EDITOR, SIR:
Is there nothing sacred? Are there no copy
right laws? Today I was listening to two football
games, viz., Stanford vs. Washington and California vs.
U.S.C. In both games, Stanford's songs and yells were
used by unauthorized agents.
This is probably only one of many letters com
plaining against this plagiarism, but something ought
to be done. Why in all heaven should Washington use
an axe yell? And why, in the same spirit, should U.S.C.
use "Come Join the Band" after they made one of
their many scores against the university in the shadow
of the Berkeley war library?
It. is true we copied the Campanile, but we're pay
ing for it. If something can't be done to stop this un
warranted usage of Stanford songs and yells, why don't
we adopt just one song for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence—The Internationale?
