r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
The Chem 10 lecture room "stinks," and is any
thing but confidential about it. The ventilation condi
tions in said room make the Black Hole of Calcutta
seem an ideal situation, fragrantly aromatic in com
parison.
Professor Leighton had better be careful the next
time lie lights a match, or that dark brown smell
composed of a hundred variations of halitosis will
explode with the most terrific detonation Stanford
has ever heard!
Let's have more fresh air and less hot air in there
(No offense meant to Professor Leighton). Psycho
path! c cases like me get "carbon dioxidophobia" every
time we enter the room. And if nothing is done to bet
ter existing conditions, I shall feel morally obliged to
air-condition the place on my own by neatly per
forating the windows with my trusty B-B gun (which
is purely hypothetical at this juncture—but it's a
threat!).
In the event that this target-practice proves futile
I shall, as a la.st altruistic gesture, light a match my
self and blow the lid ofT that insufferable hole.
Yours,
A Caiman
