# Ameche Cops Top Acting Laurels in 'Cavalcade'
## 
### 
"HOLLYWOOD CAVALCADE," now playing at the Fox Stanford.
Lights! Camera! Action! And Hollywood turns out another "epic,"
this time, however, starring—you've jjuessed it—Hollywood. "Hollywood
Cavalcade" is the history of the birth, growth, and the maturity of that
glamorous industry, the cinema.

Even a hackneyed story
offset the beautiful direction, acting,
and technicolor which makes the pic
ture worth the movie fan's time and
money.
Radio's gift to motion pictures,
Don Ameche, takes top honors in
acting. He is the only actor in pic
tures today who can cry and still
retain his manly dignity. The anni
versary scene at the Cocoanut Grove j
when Ameche cries as he watches the i
proceedings is fine acting and could I
stand up to an academy award per
formance any time.
Alice Faye's transition from a
platinum blonde "song-bird" to an
actress of note is climaxed by her
performance as the old time "flicker"
star. The slapstick, pie-throwing,
and Keystone Cop sequences are
hilarious.
In the supporting cast the names
of J. Edward Brombery, Alan Cur
tis, and Buster Keaton are the most
prominent, both for acting and
laugh-getting. Stuart Erwin deserves
praise for his delivery of the line,
"long time no see." The technicolor
is the best to date and Irving Cum
mings' direction is excellent. —
