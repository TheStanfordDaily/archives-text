# Insane Slayer Surrenders To Authorities
## Winnie Ruth Judd Walks into Hospital, Ends Six-day Hunt 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz., Oct. 30 (UP).—
Winnie Ruth Judd, the trunk mur
deress, walked into the state hospi
tal for the insane tonight, six days
after she escaped.
Gov. R. T. Jones announced that
the insane killer surrendered alone,
apparently in response to his plead
ings by newspaper announcements.
"She was in bad condition," the
governor said. "But we will give
her the best of care and we do not
believe she will be any the worse
for her experience,"
NEAR EXHAUSTION
The trunk murderess, who ap
parently had nearly starved to death
in an orange grove for almost a
week after her escape, was near ex
haustion when she banged on the
hospital door.
Surprised nurses helped her in
side to the office of Dr. Louis Saxe,
who was on vacation in Los Angeles
when she made a dummy, tucked it
in her bed, and walked away from
the institution. The amazed Dr.
Saxe put his arm around the blonde
killer, congratulated her upon her
judgment in returning of her own
accord, and ordered a light meal pre
pared, such as would be given a
person coming from a long fast.
JUDD BEDRAGGLED
Winnie Ruth, who had been re
ported wandering the streets near
the asylum armed with a knife
while she argued with herself on
whether to return, was bedraggled,
dirty, and scratched about the hands
and face.
The maniacal mood in which she
had been reported earlier by friends
upon whom she had burst, appar
ently had disappeared and the tiger
woman was as meek and polite as
she had been when she was known
as the "duchess" of the hospital's
beauty parlor.
Dr. Saxe said he would give his
returned guest the finest of medical
care, the greatest kindliness and the
most thorough sympathy. He said
that while her mental condition had
gone from bad to worse he believed
that the proper physical and psy
chological care for the blonde slayer
might do wonders.
ELUDES DEPUTIES
The trunk murderess, who gained
the reputation as the tiger woman
with her outbursts of insane fury
during her trial for slaying her two
girl friends eight years ago, embar
rassed Sheriff Lon Jordan and his
dozens of deputies by eluding them
throughout her stay outside asylum
walls.
The two-gun sheriff, who had
announced his belief daily since her
escape that she had gone to Los
Angeles, admitted that he was flab
bergasted.
Jordan and his chief deputies got
some satisfaction from the fact that
Winnie Ruth reported she had sur
rendered because she was convinced
the officers were converging in upon
her, prepared to blow her head off.

The two-gun sheriff, who had
announced his belief daily since her
escape that she had gone to Los
Angeles, admitted that he was flab
bergasted.
Jordan and his chief deputies got
some satisfaction from the fact that
Winnie Ruth reported she had sur
rendered because she was convinced
the officers were converging in upon
her, prepared to blow her head off.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Oct. 30 (UP).—
Winnie Ruth Judd, the trunk mur
deress, walked into the state hospi
tal for the insane tonight, six days
after she escaped.
Gov. R. T. Jones announced that
the insane killer surrendered alone,
apparently in response to his plead
ings by newspaper announcements.
"She was in bad condition," the
governor said. "But we will give
her the best of care and we do not
believe she will be any the worse
for her experience,"
NEAR EXHAUSTION
The trunk murderess, who ap
parently had nearly starved to death
in an orange grove for almost a
week after her escape, was near ex
haustion when she banged on the
hospital door.
Surprised nurses helped her in
side to the office of Dr. Louis Saxe,
who was on vacation in Los Angeles
when she made a dummy, tucked it
in her bed, and walked away from
the institution. The amazed Dr.
Saxe put his arm around the blonde
killer, congratulated her upon her
judgment in returning of her own
accord, and ordered a light meal pre
pared, such as would be given a
person coming from a long fast.
JUDD BEDRAGGLED
Winnie Ruth, who had been re
ported wandering the streets near
the asylum armed with a knife
while she argued with herself on
whether to return, was bedraggled,
dirty, and scratched about the hands
and face.
The maniacal mood in which she
had been reported earlier by friends
upon whom she had burst, appar
ently had disappeared and the tiger
woman was as meek and polite as
she had been when she was known
as the "duchess" of the hospital's
beauty parlor.
Dr. Saxe said he would give his
returned guest the finest of medical
care, the greatest kindliness and the
most thorough sympathy. He said
that while her mental condition had
gone from bad to worse he believed
that the proper physical and psy
chological care for the blonde slayer
might do wonders.
ELUDES DEPUTIES
The trunk murderess, who gained
the reputation as the tiger woman
with her outbursts of insane fury
during her trial for slaying her two
girl friends eight years ago, embar
rassed Sheriff Lon Jordan and his
dozens of deputies by eluding them
throughout her stay outside asylum
walls.
