r FHE ghosts of Russia's czars stalk
ed through the medieval corri
dors of the Kremlin yesterday. They
paused outside the doors of Saint
Andrew's Hall, massive throne room
of their dynasty.
The scene inside the closed doors
was unfamiliar. Here sat 1000 depu
ties of the Soviet Parliament, dele
gates from the "workers," repre
sentatives of the proletariat. They
were listening to the words of a
small, studious man who spoke rap
idly, gesturing abruptly to accent
each nuance of the tale he told. The
story was strange to their autocratic
cars, these apparitions who gathered
thus silently on the threshold of
their imperial throne room.
The man whose voice reached
them, hushed and blurred across
the years, was Soviet-Premier and
Foreign Minister Viacheslav M.
Molotov. Had they been able to
hear each word he spoke, they
would have learned of Russia's
working agreement with Ger
many, the occupation of eastern
Poland, and the spread of Soviet
domination across the Baltic
states. They would have followed
Molotov through the tangled web
of Soviet diplomacy, would have
heard his explanation of the odd,
twisted path of European power
politics.
* * *
W/ARNING Finland of "serious
consequences" if she continues
to resist Russia's big-brother pro
posals, Molotov struck vehemently at
President Roosevelt for meddling in
the delicate Soviet-Finnish negotia
tions. He lashed out again at the
United States arms embargo, in
sisting that lifting the U.S. arms ban
would "prolong and complicate the
war" to the profit of American mu
nitions makers.
Molotov announced Finland had
rejected Russia's proposal for a mu
tual assistance pact, though in re
ality the Finnish delegates were still
hurtling across the continent toward
Moscow with their answer as the
Soviet premier spoke. At least they
were heading for "further talks"
with Stalin and his ace trouble
shooter.
Violating every agreement that
bound his diplomatic procedure,
Molotov revealed the extent of So
viet demands on Finland. Russia
had asked, he said, for an eastern
shifting of the frontier away from
Leningrad, leasing of territory on
the Finnish mainland to Russia for
a naval base, disarmament of Finn
ish fortified zones all along the bor
der and "additional mutual guar
antees to reinforce the existing So
viet-Finnish pact of non-aggres
sion."
* ij: *
| 4NCE and for all Soviet policy
was laid down by Molotov as
consisting of a free hand in inter
national affairs; a continuation of
neutrality, whatever that may now
mean to the Russians; and, in
consistently, a determination "not
to help spread the war" in co-op
eration with Germany.
He branded Britain and France as
aggressors, said Russia is standing
with Germany in striving for peace,
and warned the European war is
only in its first phase and will be
come a conflict of "even greater di
mension fraught with ever greater
dangers for the people of Europe
and the whole world."
* # #
And, while former Foreign Com
missar Maxim LitvinofT sat in the
crowd of representatives who heard
him speak, Molotov held open the
door to Japan for a new accord,
turned a bitter diatribe against the
Turks who signed a deal with the
Allies last week.
The Allies are fighting a "sense
less" war, he said, that will bring
only bloody sacrifices and hard
ships to the working classes of
the world. The fear of Germany's
claims for restoration of her colo
nies "is at the bottom of the war"
and it isn't a war for democracy
"but in their (England and
France) profoundly material in
terest as mighty colonial powers."
