# Row Revises Rushing Code
## Sale of Second Bids To Begin Tomorrow 
### 
Fraternity rushing rules for the
season of 1939-40, as newly inter
preted by the Interfraternity Coun
cil Rushing Rules Committee, were
adopted by the Council last night at
its third dinner conclave of the quar
ter at the Zete house.
Council President Bob Moulton,
who presided at the meeting, stated
that rushing cards for the rush pe
riod next week, Wednesday and
Thursday, Nov. 8 and 9, will be on
sale in the A.S.S.U. office starting
this Thursday morning. The rush
period will be in the form of lunches
and dinners at the houses. Rush
cards for the first rush period, this
Friday and Saturday, are still on
sale.
Former rushing regulations, as
presented with ne\v interpretations
to the Council by Beta President
Jack Ahern, and as subsequently
adopted, are as follows:
1. There shall be no off-campus
rushing, except during vacations,
as designated in the University
Calendar. Note, S.C. game and
Big Game week-ends arc not va
cations, therefore there Is to be
no ofT-campus rashing at these
times.
2. No fraternity man shall enter
Encina except with the pel mis
sion of a sponsor, not of his own
house. Freshmen must keep out
of fraternity houses except during
regular rush periods. Note, fra
ternity houses are not to be open
to freshmen, nor Encina to fra
ternity men, during vacations
(Thanksgiving and Christmas).
3. Contact of an informal nature
between new lower division men
and fraternity men shall be per
mitted. Fraternity men may meet
rushces informally on the cam
pus, but there arc to be no more
than eight in a group and not more
than four fraternity men; if there
are less fraternity men, the bal
ance can be freshmen.
4. No pledge is binding until
formal pledge day.
5. No house may pledge more
than 14 freshmen.
(>. Any contact between frater
nity men and rushces is strictly
prohibited in the period following
preference dinner through formal
pledging.
An interpretation of rule 1 states
that "There is to be no unnecessary
contact or companionship with fresh
men of! campus (vacations ex
cepted), it being at the discretion of
the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol as to the 'mental intent' of
parties involved in negligence of
this ruling."
Regulations' enforcement is in
sured by the statement, "For viola
tion of the above rules, fraternity
houses and rushees are equally sub
ject to the jurisdiction of the Intcr
fralernity Board of Control."
A report of the pre-initiation pe
riod was read by Moulton, and
among others things his report rec
ommends establishment of continuity
in fraternity government. In this
respect the secretary of the Coun
cil would be required to be a junior,
and fraternity vice-presidents would
bo juniors. This is designed to give
new presidents previous governing
experience.
