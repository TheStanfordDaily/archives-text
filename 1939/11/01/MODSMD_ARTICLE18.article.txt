# Excom Acts To Prevent Ticket Tieup
## Request to B.A.C. Urges Abolishment Of U.S.C. [illegible] Check-up 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Ex Committee took steps last
night to prevent a ticket validation
tie-up at the U.S.C. football game
Nov. 11.
It was pointed out that clumsy
procedure in validating tickets at
the U.C.L.A. game last year kept
one-third of Stanford's rooters from
seeing the first quarter of the game.
Recommending to the Board of
Athletic Control that no check-up
be used at the southern game this
year, Ex Committee asked that, if a
check-up be found necessary, no
ticket-holder bo forced to miss any
part of the game.
If a ticket-holder reaches the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum at least
a half-hour before the game, ac
cording to the recommendation, no
form of ticket validation shall pre
vent him from entering the gate too
late for the kick-off.
President Ken Cuthbertson said
he will confer with Alfred R. Mas
ters, general manager of the 8.A.C.,
to see that checking methods this
year do not work a hardship on
students by making them stand in
line and "answer foolish questions."
Members of the committee com
plained that gate guards last; year
turned students away when they
could not give the name of the'cap
tain of Stanford's baseball team,
the number of theaters in Palo
Alto, or what street a given "Palo
Alto creamery was on.
Alternative suggestions were that
photographs be placed on the, back
of student body cards in future
years and that students be required
to sign their names before being ad
mitted to the game, signatures ,io be
compared with those on the cards.
Consensus, however, was in favor
of trusting students and foregoing
any form of check-up.
Other Ex Committee business
follows:
OPTIONAL BOILED SHIRTS:
On grounds that mandatory tuxes
would work against the democratic
angle of the Big Game dance, Ex
Committee voted that dress will be
semi-formal — formals for women,
tuxedos or dark suits for men.
Gordy Nicoll was approved unani
mously as chairman of the dance.
SPEAKERS' BUREAU: Hugh
O'Donnell was appointed chairman
of the bureau for the remainder of
the academic year to fill a vacancy
caused by the resignation of Oliver
Wyman.
ACTIVITY FILES: Lyle Cook
having resigned as chairman of the
men's activity file, Ed Collom was
appointed to the position, the ac
tion being approved by Ex Commit
tee.
NEW SPEED TRAP: John Part
ridge told of complaints that motor
ists drive past the east end of En
cina during the 6 o'clock rush fast
enough to constitute a safety haz
ard. Cuthbertson said he would
transmit the complaints to campus
police officers.
ATHLETIC CONTROL: Although
no official action was taken, the
committeemen discussed what they
considered a regrettable situation —
lack of response of the B.A.C. to
student interests.
Cuthbertson suggested that mych
student dissatisfaction may be
blamed on the fact that "fewer than
one-tenth know that students are
| represented on the board."
