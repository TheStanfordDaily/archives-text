# Russ Speech Jeopardizes Finnish Pact
## Demand for Military Concessions Angers Helsingfors Cabinet 
### 
HELSINGFORS. Wed., Nov. 1
(UP). —The Finnish government an
nounced today that last night's
speech of Soviet Premier Viacheslav
Molotov had gravely jeopardized the
chances of a compromise settlement
on Russia's demands on Finland.
The cabinet, after a midnight ses
sion devoted to a study of the
speech, informed the Finnish gen
eral staff that the situation had sud
denly become "most serious" because
of revelation of Soviet demands for
military concessions from the Finns. J
Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko is- j
sued a statement saying that a "real
danger" had been created by Molo
tov's allegedly premature disclo
sure of the extent of the Russian
demands.
SEEK COMMISSION
There was a hint, in Erkko's
statement that Finland, having ob
tained moral support from the Unit
ed States, Sweden, Norway and Den
mark, might seek to have an arbi
tration commission established un
der provisions of the 1932 non-ag
gression pact with Russia in an ef
fort to find a settlement.
"Until now Finland has been con
fident of her ability to find a solu
tion without pressure from abroad,"
Erkko said.
There was considerable talk of
breaking off the talks and calling
back the Finnish mission, headed by
Juhu K. Paasikivi, which is en route
to Moscow, until a study of Molo
tov's speech revealed that his de
mands actually were less severe than
those put to the Finnish negotiators
by Josef V. Stalin. It was decided
that the mission should continue to
Moscow and attempt to iron out
matters.
SURPRISES FINNS
Although the Finnish government
knew, of course, of Russia's demand
Molotov's announcement that Rus
sia sought a mutual aid pact, mili
tary and naval bases and territorial
concessions came as a surprise to
the Finnish people.
Molotov, according to Erkko, cre
ated a new and difficult situation by
announcing the demands while the
Finnish delegation was en route to
Moscow.
Informed quarters said that the
major menace now is that the Rus
sians will regard their prestige as
being at stake, in view of Molo
tov's statement, and will refuse to
be conciliatory.
CLAIM ACCORD VIOLATED
The Finns complained that Molo
tov violated an agreement whereby
neither government would reveal
any details of the pending talks, at
least not before the arrival of the
Finnish delegation in Moscow
Thursday.
The Finns were particularly an
gered and chagrined because Molo
tov asserted that Russia had asked
a mutual assistance pact with Fin
land—along the lines of the pacts
whereby Estonia, Latvia and Lith
uania surrendered military bases
and rights to the Russians—but that
Finland had rejected the proposal.
It was understood that the Paasi
kivi mission was carrying to Moscow
a sharp rejection of the demand for
a mutual aid pact.

uania surrendered military bases
and rights to the Russians—but that
Finland had rejected the proposal.
It was understood that the Paasi
kivi mission was carrying to Moscow
a sharp rejection of the demand for
a mutual aid pact.
HELSINGFORS. Wed., Nov. 1
(UP). —The Finnish government an
nounced today that last night's
speech of Soviet Premier Viacheslav
Molotov had gravely jeopardized the
chances of a compromise settlement
on Russia's demands on Finland.
The cabinet, after a midnight ses
sion devoted to a study of the
speech, informed the Finnish gen
eral staff that the situation had sud
denly become "most serious" because
of revelation of Soviet demands for
military concessions from the Finns. J
Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko is- j
sued a statement saying that a "real
danger" had been created by Molo
tov's allegedly premature disclo
sure of the extent of the Russian
demands.
SEEK COMMISSION
There was a hint, in Erkko's
statement that Finland, having ob
tained moral support from the Unit
ed States, Sweden, Norway and Den
mark, might seek to have an arbi
tration commission established un
der provisions of the 1932 non-ag
gression pact with Russia in an ef
fort to find a settlement.
"Until now Finland has been con
fident of her ability to find a solu
tion without pressure from abroad,"
Erkko said.
There was considerable talk of
breaking off the talks and calling
back the Finnish mission, headed by
Juhu K. Paasikivi, which is en route
to Moscow, until a study of Molo
tov's speech revealed that his de
mands actually were less severe than
those put to the Finnish negotiators
by Josef V. Stalin. It was decided
that the mission should continue to
Moscow and attempt to iron out
matters.
SURPRISES FINNS
Although the Finnish government
knew, of course, of Russia's demand
Molotov's announcement that Rus
sia sought a mutual aid pact, mili
tary and naval bases and territorial
concessions came as a surprise to
the Finnish people.
Molotov, according to Erkko, cre
ated a new and difficult situation by
announcing the demands while the
Finnish delegation was en route to
Moscow.
Informed quarters said that the
major menace now is that the Rus
sians will regard their prestige as
being at stake, in view of Molo
tov's statement, and will refuse to
be conciliatory.
CLAIM ACCORD VIOLATED
The Finns complained that Molo
tov violated an agreement whereby
neither government would reveal
any details of the pending talks, at
least not before the arrival of the
Finnish delegation in Moscow
Thursday.
The Finns were particularly an
gered and chagrined because Molo
tov asserted that Russia had asked
a mutual assistance pact with Fin
land—along the lines of the pacts
whereby Estonia, Latvia and Lith
uania surrendered military bases
and rights to the Russians—but that
Finland had rejected the proposal.
