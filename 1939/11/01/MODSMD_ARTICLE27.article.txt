# Benedict Uses Magic to Prove Scientific Point
## Lecturer's Trickery Demonstrates Need Of Close Observation 
### 
Completely destroying, then re
generating, a dollar bill was only
one method employed by Dr. Francis
G. Benedict to prove that "Obser
vation and more observation is im
portant before accepting a new con
cept," at the Tuesday evening lec
ture at the Memorial Theater last
night.
Although magic and science are
obviously widely separated, said Dr.
Benedict, this element of observa
tion binds them together. Dr. Bene
dict is a scientist as well as a magi
cian, having conducted much re
search on the basal metabolisim of
animals as director of the nutrition
laboratory of Carnegie Institute at
Washington, D.C.
COLLEGE MAN KEENER
"Although the college man is
keener than the man on the street,
he is also more easily deceived,"
said Dr. Benedict. He illustrated his
point by conducting four experi
ments which started with a simple
concept and worked up successively
to the apparently improbable one of
cutting a piece of rope and joining
it together again with knots which
then disappeared completely.
Moderns are most interested in
magic from a single point of view,
according to Dr. Benedict. Psycholo
gists, for instance, believe misdirec
tion to be the most important factor
in successful magic. Dr. t Benedict
cited as an example the trick of Her
mann the Elder who used to roll his
eyes to the ceiling on his first ap
pearance on the stage, thus diverting
the attention of his audience so that
he could go on with preparations for
the tricks which followed.
DEMONSTRATES PRINCIPLE
Magicians are most interested in
tricks involving the seeming viola
tion of actual physical laws, accord
ing to Dr. Benedict. He illustrated
this principle by tearing a folded
nev/spaper into small pieces, and
then opening it into a complete
newspaper.
"Every university should have a
professor of conjuring, to teach stu
dents to refrain from making fools of
themselves," said Dr. Benedict.
