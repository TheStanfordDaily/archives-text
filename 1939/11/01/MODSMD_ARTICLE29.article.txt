# SIDELINE SLANTS

### JERRY MAYER 
It seems that the letter published j
in Slants yesterday has created
somewhat of a minor flurry on the
F;:rm. II you recall, it was sent to
Jack Gillean, sports editor of the
Southern California Daily Trojan,
and was published by him in his
column, from where Slants picked
it up.
The letter described a movement
sponsored by a group of 24 alumni
representing four coast schools
which intended to force U.S.C.'s
withdrawal from the Pacific Coast
Conference for three alleged rea
sons, briefly: (1) The Trojans are
practically a professional team. (2)
Troy is getting a better break in
the matter of penalties inflicted
than the law of averages should
allow them. This intimates that the
officials are giving the Trojans the
"breaks." (3) Criticism was leveled
at the Trojans for tremendous scores
that they have run up in the past,
including the 74-0 massacre over
California.

The letter further claims that a
p< lilion is at present being circu
lated in San Francisco and Oak
land which demands U.S.C.'s
withdrawal from the conference.
However, Don Licbendorfer, Stan
ford's director of publicity, says he
knows of no such petition.
As Slants looks at it, this let
ter is Ihe work of either a "crank"
or a hypocrite—probably a com
bination of both. It is well to re
member that even the Trojans
have had their ups and downs.
From 1933 through 1937 U.S.C. was
in the doldrums and the alumni
were howling lor Howard Jones'
scalp. It is significant that no reso
lution was circulated while the Tro
jans were down, and yet it is un
reasonable to assume that U.S.C.
wasn't making just as great an ef
fort to land outstanding players
during its famine as it is now.
When Stanford's great Vow Boys
were cleaning up the coast no one
ever publicly suggested that the In
dians be thrown out of the confer
ence. Cal had a wonderful outfit
two years ago, slaughtering the Tro
jans and winning easily over Ala
bama in the Rose Bowl, but it was
n't brought to my attention that the
Bears were in danger of being tossed
out of the conference.
So why all this disturbance
about U.S.C. just because they are
at the top of the football ladder
once more? Before we make cate
gorical answers to each of the
(hrce reasons advanced it would
be a good idea to ponder what

would happen to the prestige of j
Pacific Coast Conlevence football
if U.S.C. ever withdrew from the i
Conference.
There isn't another school on the '
coast that schedules as many out
standing intersectional games as Ihe
Trojans do, and they keep the
West's reputation for good teams high
by winning most of these conflicts.

Another thing to consider is the
financial angle. The smaller schools
in the conference — Washington
State, Oregon, Oregon State, and 1
even Stanford to a certain extent —
draw tremendous crowds when !
they play the Trojans in Los An- j
geles. The receipts from their games
with U.S.C. are the only things that
have kept some of the smaller |
schools solvent in an athletic sense \
during the past few years.
Answering each of the three points
advanced as reasons why Troy
should be forced from the confer
ence:
(1) U.S.C. is a professional
team. This is absolutely a foolish
statement, considering all that it
implies. If you think that it's any
easier for a football player to ful
fill entrance requirements at U.S.C.
than some of the northern confer
ence schools, you may easily rem
edy that mistake by taking a look
at an Oregon or Oregon State cata- j
logue.
And as for fobs for athletes, it j
just happens that U.S.C. is in a i
position to get them. All these j
schools with "holier-than-thou"
attitudes toward the Trojan ath
letic set-up are merely hypocrites \
wishing that they could use the 1
same method of persuasion to nab !
athletes for their schools.
(2) Penalties. We won't even in- j
suit our readers' intelligence by dis- i
cussing this point.
(3) High scores. There is only
slight justification for this point. It !
is very seldom that, a coach can avert :
a high score, especially if the other j
team is very weak. Putting in your '
inexperienced men won't turn the 1
trick, because these men are fighting
for higher ranking and most likely
will be playing harder than the reg
ulars. And you can't tell your men j
to lay down on the job.
Slants has no love for U.S.C., but |
we hate any kind of hypocrisy—and !
the letter published yesterday !
smacked of nothing else.
(The question can be raised, ;
What is Stanford's place in this 1
general set-up? But that is another j
column in itself, and will come later l
in the year.)
