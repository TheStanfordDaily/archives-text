# Breakers Keep Record Intact
## 
### 
Intramural football continued its j
drive down the home stretch yester- j
day with a program that featured j
walk-aways and forfeits.
In the only close game of the day j
Encina 1W knocked over Eneina 3W, j
13 to 6. Boyer passed to Hughey!
twice, once from his own 10 and j
again from his opponents' 30, and j
Encina 1W had two touchdowns and
a victory.
The Firehouse and the Breakers J
both kept their winning streaks in- i
tact yesterday with overwhelming j
victories over Sigma Nu and Phi
Sigma Kappa, respectively.
