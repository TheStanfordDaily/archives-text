# Farm Booters To Meet Menlo
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney will have
his first team primed for Stanford's ,
varsity soccer match with Menlo |
Jaysee at 4 o'clock at Menlo this |
afternoon.
Although the varsity's 2-1 defeat !
by San Jose State College a week j
ago was not termed an upset, it did !
turn out to be a severe blow to the <
Cards, who had high hopes of hav
ing an undefeated year.
GAME IS REMEET
This afternoon's game will be the j
second with the Menlo outfit, which '
bowed in the season's opener, 5-0. j
The surprising factor in the Farm's |
defeat by San Jose was the team's 1
lack of cohesion.
Nullifying the fine play of the j
backs, Stanford forwards were con- |
tinually beaten to the ball and thus I
had many scoring plays stopped in [
midfield.
These faults have been corrected
since last Wednesday and a much
better brand of ball is expected of
the entire eleven this afternoon.
BILL EDWARDS OUT
Bill Edwards, who was on the j
sidelines last week with a cold, will
be in uniform but will not be on j
the starting line-up. Tito Sanz- |
Agero, tall goalie, hurt his shoulder
in practice Monday afternoon and
will be unable to start. Rudy Mun
zer will take over with Burns in j
the sub role.
The starters will include: Munzer,
Hamilton, Harmon, Bryan, Clark.
Cuthbertsoti, Arrasmith, Dole, Rog
ers, Pellas, and Sontum.
