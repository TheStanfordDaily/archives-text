# Tiny Dreams Up Trickery To Baffle Bronco Gridders
## 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
There'll be some changes made.
That's the theme song Tiny Thornhill is drilling his Indian gridders on
in preparation for Saturday's encounter with Santa Clara.
Working behind locked gates this week, the Indian baton wielder is
dreaming up some brand new arrangements calculated to baffle Buck

Shaw's high flying Broncos.
new plays that are radical depar-1
tures from the Cards' offensive tac- !
tics so far this season will be re- i
vealed in the Stadium this week- j
end.
STARTERS IN DOUBT
After returning from Seattle, j
Tiny announced that his starting :
line-up won't be known until the \
kick-off Saturday. The main ques- j
tion marks will be at the left hall
and left guard posts, with three pos- j
sible starters in each spot.
Frankie Albert. Pete Kmetovic, j
and Moon Mullin have been battling
for the left half spot since the open
ing game. Kmetovic, the sophomore j
speedster from San Jose, was a sur
prise starter against Washington,
but has been working in the second
string backfield in practice this
week. Mullin sparked a fourth
quarter Indian attack against the
Huskies with his passing. Albert
also saw action in the north.
IK.IIT FOR GUARD POST
Steve Keussef, Bill Braheny, and
Claude Purkitt. are scrapping over
the left guard position vacated by the
injured Johnny Kerman.
Keussef would appear to have the
edge because of experience, but
either Braheny or Purkitt may get
the call, and both are likely to see
action.
UNVEIL NEW PANTS
In practice last night Thornhill
had the team working out on the
dummies, perfecting new plays.
After the session Tiny said that the
squad would get its first contact
work of the week this afternoon in
a scrimmage. The main purpose of
the scrum will be to polish the new
offense.
Another radical change will greet
the eyes of Farm rooters Saturday
when the Indians wear the new sil
ver football pants for the first time.
Tried out in spring practice, they
are made of special light-weight
material.
