# Injuries Hamper Frosh Gridders
## 
### 
With two full weeks in which to
i prepare for that all important bat
tle with California's freshmen, Coach
I Harry Shipkey is. at present, only
j leisurely putting his Cardinal year-
I lings through their practice ses-
J sions. However, the pace will quicken
I toward the end of this week, cliâ€”
I maxed by an intersquad scrimmage
j on Friday.
Bob Greening, victim of a bruised
vertebra, much the same as varsity
fullback Thor Peterson, is expected
j to be in a suit for the Cal contest.
Eric Armstrong, sensational half
back, is still having trouble wilh
j that knee he wrenched during the
U.S.C. game. And the essential A1
j Cole is also still favoring a bad
' knee.
Yet these injured men have
plenty of time to recuperate before
their big game. So it appears, with
Hank Norberg performing regularly
again, that the Papooses will be at
top strength for those Cubs from
Berkeley.
