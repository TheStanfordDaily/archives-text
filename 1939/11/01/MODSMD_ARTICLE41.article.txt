### 
Water polo as played in San Jose i
State's pool will be on tap tonight j
when Stanford and Spartan varsity!
j teams mix it. Proceedings start at i
1 8 o'clock.
The Indians, used to battling in a 1
| pool deep at both ends, will be up j
against a new problem in the waist j
j deep water at one extreme of Stale's '
plunge.
TROUBLE AHEAD
Because it is a toul to touch the I
bottom of the pool. Stanford play-'
ers may find themselves penalized j
to such an extent as to make up for |
■ the apparent man for man advan- I
; tage they possessed against the'
I Spartans in the first meet, won by
j the locals, 6 to 2.
! Playing under the same conditions
! in the Southerner's pool, San Jose j
j recently upset the University of
i California.'
POOL SHORT
The game will be played in a 20- ■■
yard pool. 15 feet shorter than Stan- j
ford -usually uses. In an attempt to [
i remedy resulting faulty shooting, I
; Coach Noil Thornton has been i
j working his sevens out in the short- I
j er Erg_'ina diving pool.

| bill will be Capt. Bob Plate, sprint; j
