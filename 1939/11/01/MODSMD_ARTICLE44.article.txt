# Canzoneri Battles Davis in Comeback
## 
### 
NEW YOKK, Oct. 31 (UP). More
than 10.000 admirers will stream into
Madison Square Garden tomorrow
night to witness the complete ring
resurrection of little Tony Can
zoneri, or to see him battered back
to the bottom again.
When Canzoneri crawls through
the ropes he again can become
challenger for a world's champion
ship by beating, in 10 rounds or
less, A1 Davis of Brooklyn, out
standing young contender for the
welterweight title â€” or he can be
sent back into retirement.
