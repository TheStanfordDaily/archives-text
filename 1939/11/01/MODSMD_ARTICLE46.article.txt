//r-pHE school has run pretty well this far on
JL the Honor Code."
That was the theme of Ex Committee's song
last night when it recommended to the B.A.C.
that no form of student body card validation be
used before admitting rooters to the U.S.C.
game in Los Angeles.
A summary check-up carried out at the
U.C.L.A. game last year resulted disastrously
for 87 people who were refused admission and
an equal number of Stanford students who had
to pay two dollars to redeem their cards the next
week at the B.A.C.
But, more important, it prevented over one
third of the rooting section, holding its own
cards, from entering the stadium until after the
first quarter was over. Having traveled to Los
Angeles to support their team, these students
were not permitted to see the game until they
had satisfied B.A.C. checkers as to their hon
esty.
However, neither the inconvenience suffered
by these men and women nor the unfavorable
impression of Stanford gained by U.C.L.A. stu
dents and Southern California football fans was
the most regrettable aspect of the situation.
The trouble was that the Honor Code had
been forgotten. The fundamental standard that
governs Stanford life was ignored by the offi
cials of the Board of Athletic Control.
The Code has worked long and successfully
with regard to taking examinations, the use of
the Library, and lock-outs.
Perhaps if the B.A.C. would apply it to the
lending of student body cards, it would be more
effective than amateur detective tactics.
