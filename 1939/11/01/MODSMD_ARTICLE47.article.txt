# Impure Competition

### 
COMPETITION between the Row and eating
clubs for acceptable paying members has
been cut-throat at times past. Potentially it is
a menace to the whole Stanford club and fra
ternity system. Like most social warfare, it is a
perfect medium for hard feelings and petty
scandals.
Interfraternity Council met at dinner last
night to do what it could about coding sugges
tions for alleviating the situation. Their con
clusions, which will be submitted soon to Inter
fraternity Board of Control, seem to be about
what is needed.
Briefly, the new rules are designed to pre
vent the shock which eating clubs have felt in
the past upon picking up The Daily and dis
covering that one or two prize members have
left for the Row.
To accomplish this end, Interfraternity Coun
cil suggests requiring fraternities to notify an
eating club before rushing any men belonging
to that club. Not until 30 days after this notifi
cation is given can a fraternity pledge a former
club man. Responsibility for determining whe
ther a man belongs to a club or not is left to
the individual fraternity.
To avoid conflicts and arguments, such for
malized social life as joining a fraternity or eat
ing club must be regulated. That the rules work
for the benefit of the organizations is apparent
in the fact that fraternity presidents have uni
versally endorsed their Council's recommenda
tions, and have signed a pledge upholding
them.—J. B.
