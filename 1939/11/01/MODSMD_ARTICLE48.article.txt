# Tower of Learning

WHEN plans for building the new Hoover
Library on War, Revolution, and Peace first
were announced from many parts of the cam
pus there arose a chorus of grumbling and
groaning. Every second man wa6 ready to sug
gest some way in which the University could
better use the money.
These omnipresent critics failed to take two
vital factors into consideration: (1) The building
was presented as an unsolicited gift. (2) From
the academic point of view, it will be one of
Stanford's outstanding features.
Containing complete official records, govern
ment documents, motion picture films, propa
ganda in all forms, and even secret papers that

cannot be opened for a number of years, the
Hoover collection is unexcelled in the world.
Certainly it deserves an appropriate building.
For many years part of this material has been
kept in the stacks of the main Library and in
one small reading room tucked away in the
corner of the first floor. Because of lack of room
the rest of it never has been filed or catalogued
â€”or, in fact, removed from the packing cases in
which it is stored in the basement of the Ad
ministration Building.
When the new tower is completed, all this
valuable matter will be available to scholars for
the first time.
Yesterday came word from Europe that the
Hoover Library will contain not only a complete
collection of data on the first World War, but
on the second one as well. Sent abroad this
summer to round out the original collection,
Professor Ralph H. Lutz has succeeded in ob
taining the co-operation of both belligerent and
neutral governments in collecting material on
the current conflict.
This new information, which will be added to
the archives at the close of the present struggle,
will make it the world's most complete library
on the world wars of the twentieth century.
Undoubtedly it will become a mecca for schol
ars and practical research men in a hundred
connected fields.
And to Stanford it will add not just 274 feet
of concrete cutting the skyline. But the honor
and prestige of academic achievement.
