### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
APOLOGIES TO CARL SANDBURG
TTAMMF/RS! Mechanical thunder! Ten million ma
chine guns attacking a regiment of tin-cans!
The great steel skeleton roars. The naked skyscraper
rattles and rumbles. Rivets! Rivets! Rivets!
Landslides of dinning noise, and not on little cat
feet.
Shell-shock. Shrapnel. Bombers. And not on the
Western Fi'ont.
Rat-a-tat-tat! Rat-a-tat-tat! And overhead the
drone of an English-corner lecture, not a squadron of
airplanes.
Hammers! Rivets! Jack-hammers! Benny Good
man!
Oh, God, we don't like to complain. We know that
a classroom is a comfortable dugout. We know that our
army is winning yards of territory from, the defenses
of the sky. But give us a shovelful of silence. One
little parcel of peace.
Rivets! The screech of tracer-shells! Die Walkure!
The riveters are pirates. They are scuttling our
ears. Banging our heads. Pounding our temples.

HPHE soldiers on the Siegfried Line are fraternizing
with the defenders of the Maginot Line. Their
trenches are muddy. But they're quiet every now and
then.
Rivets! Hammers! Soup-suckers!
I came from a peaceful little country home, friends.
Where did you come from? I'll get the birds are singing
there now, and the little streamlets murmuring over
the quiet shepherd land. But don't think about that.
It doesn't do any good to think about that now. This
is riveting. A man can't be sentimental and stand riv
eting. What if I do eat aspirin-tablets for dope? Do
you think I like to send those young boys out there
to their deafness any better than you do? This is
riveting.
Hammers! Rivets! Jack-hammers!
Doesn't that infernal monster ever get tired of
roaring?
He's grinding with iron and steel.
My ears on an emery wheel.
May all enemies of the Republic take classes in the
Art Gallery.
May God make a quiet refuge in heaven for me, in
some relatively quiet spot, like a celestial boiler
factory.
Rivets! Hammers! Rivets!
