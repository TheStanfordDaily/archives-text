## HOW DARE YOU, MR. BULL SESSION? 
### 
r J<HE EDITOR, SIR:
A.M.D.G. has written an intelligent, analytical
letter in this morning's Daily criticizing Bull Session's
stand on the subject of killing members of our 'so
ciety who are so unfortunate as to have been born
without the mental equipment necessary in our highly
•complex society.
I would like to add my voice 1o A.M.D.G.'s in ex
coriating Bull Session's sacrilegious stand. Bull Ses
sion represents the anti-Christ, the anti- of everything
that is fine and good in our community, and, lest his
perfidious ideas infect the minds of some amongst us,
There are just causes for killing certain errants in
There arc just causes for killing certani errants in
the community. Sane murderers must not be saved;
they must be judged by a Higher Tribunal than any
earthly court, for there is no earthly cure for their
affliction.
But idiots do not fall into this category. God, to
measure our Christian kindness, has put them on earth
in our charge. Aren't we smug? If He had no purpose
in putting them on earth, we would have no idiots
among us. It is not for us to judge whether or not these
unfortunates should live. They were put here to test
our Christian qualities. They will always be with us
for that purpose, and we can not escape responsibility
for them by killing them.

W/E HAVE in the course of time worked out the best
method of demonstrating kindness toward them.
Of course, we cannot have them roving the streets for
that would be unfair to both them and the rest of
the community. For reasons given in the above para
graph, we must not kill them. So we incarcerate them
in institutions where they are given every considera
tion, short of a cure—which psychologists have discov
ered is impossible.
These unfortunates are permitted the company of
others who differ among themselves only in degree of
idiocy. They are fed and clothed like normal people,
and those who cannot eat in a normal way are fed by
their attendants. They are permitted to see their fam
ilies. even when they can't recognize them. And always
these idiots are subject to inspection bv students, one
of whom may someday discover a cure for them. We
should not begrudge the few thousand dollars we
spend annually to buy these poor humans happiness.
After all, they differ from us only slightly.
Mr. Bull Session, do you dare to suggest that your
homicidal solution is a better one?
P.C.
