# 'La Traviata' Well-Staged, Satisfactory
## 
### 
That Verdi's "La Traviata" lacked
the possibilities for dramatic stag
ing and memorable individual per
formances with which this season's
opera repertoire has abounded was
no insurmountable obstacle to the
San Francisco Opera Company.
At moments very nearly spectac
ular, their performance Monday
night was at all times satisfactory
and workman-like.
What the vehicle lacked in poten
tial emotional force was adequately
balanced by lavish costuming and
scenery. The spirit of Verdi's music
and the atmosphere of Paris in the
1800's inspired the technical staff to
a performance which was really first
i-ate.
As might well be expected, Law
rence Tibbett, as the strait-laced
father with a conscience, sang his
role for all it was worth and emerged
as the real star before the curfain
was down on the second act. Un
able to reach the heights of his
"Rigoletto" which had brought the
audience to its feet the day before,
he none the less stood up to his
position as one of the finest actors,
as well as truly great singers on the
American operatic stage.
NOVOTNA PLEASES
Violetta, the lady with a past and
present, fared well in the capable
though uninspired hands of Jarmila
Novotna. The lady is as clever an
actress and as lovely to look at as
anyone could ask; and her voice,
though it scarcely rivals Pons,
Sayao, and their ilk, was sweet and
expx-essive.
Nino Martini in his San Francisco
debut is difficult to classify. It all
depends on whether one belongs to
the large fraternity which consid
ers Mr. Martini a great singer or
the equally large group who don't.
However, it can't be disputed that
he really looked the part, and in a
production in which the accent was
on the visual impression anyway,
that carries a good deal of weight.
CONDUCTOR PRAISED
Gaetano Merola did his usual mas
terful job of conducting. By spon
taneous agreement between audience
and cast, he was called to the stage
for his deserved share of applause
at the end of the third act. That
act, by the way, was in many re
spects as impressive an exhibition of
perfect integration as has been seen
this year.
An orchid or two should go to
the San Francisco Opera Ballet for
their handling of the gypsy dance,
a colorful and well-applauded in
terlude. —Pat Smith

That Verdi's "La Traviata" lacked
the possibilities for dramatic stag
ing and memorable individual per
formances with which this season's
opera repertoire has abounded was
no insurmountable obstacle to the
San Francisco Opera Company.
At moments very nearly spectac
ular, their performance Monday
night was at all times satisfactory
and workman-like.
What the vehicle lacked in poten
tial emotional force was adequately
balanced by lavish costuming and
scenery. The spirit of Verdi's music
and the atmosphere of Paris in the
1800's inspired the technical staff to
a performance which was really first
i-ate.
As might well be expected, Law
rence Tibbett, as the strait-laced
father with a conscience, sang his
role for all it was worth and emerged
as the real star before the curfain
was down on the second act. Un
able to reach the heights of his
"Rigoletto" which had brought the
audience to its feet the day before,
he none the less stood up to his
position as one of the finest actors,
as well as truly great singers on the
American operatic stage.
NOVOTNA PLEASES
Violetta, the lady with a past and
present, fared well in the capable
though uninspired hands of Jarmila
Novotna. The lady is as clever an
actress and as lovely to look at as
anyone could ask; and her voice,
though it scarcely rivals Pons,
Sayao, and their ilk, was sweet and
expx-essive.
Nino Martini in his San Francisco
debut is difficult to classify. It all
depends on whether one belongs to
the large fraternity which consid
ers Mr. Martini a great singer or
the equally large group who don't.
However, it can't be disputed that
he really looked the part, and in a
production in which the accent was
on the visual impression anyway,
that carries a good deal of weight.
CONDUCTOR PRAISED
Gaetano Merola did his usual mas
terful job of conducting. By spon
taneous agreement between audience
and cast, he was called to the stage
for his deserved share of applause
at the end of the third act. That
act, by the way, was in many re
spects as impressive an exhibition of
perfect integration as has been seen
this year.
An orchid or two should go to
the San Francisco Opera Ballet for
their handling of the gypsy dance,
a colorful and well-applauded in
terlude. —Pat Smith
