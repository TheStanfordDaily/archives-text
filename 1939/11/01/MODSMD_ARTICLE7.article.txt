### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
If there is a student on the Stanford campus who believes that he
holds any kind of a record for time spent in the Library this quarter, let
him be now informed that he has had strong, but unpretentious competi
tion from Professor Gaetano Salvemini.
Professor Salvemini, who will speak before Luncheon Club today on

been at Stanford since the begin- :
ning of the quarter doing research 1
work in the Hoover War Library j
for a book he is planning on Italian j
diplomacy during World War 1. j
During his stay here, he has usu- j
| ally crossed the Libe threshold with j
the first arrivals and been among j
the assiduous number who leave it j
i last
JUST LIKE ITALY'
His brief, substantial form bent
j over a back volume of La Popolo
| d'ltalia, as Stanford's October sun
| streamed in the Libe windows, Pro
-1 fessor Salvemini remarked yester
day that "being here was just like
being in Italy as far as climate goes
â€”same sun, same skies ... Is it
always like this?" he asked.
As he spoke of a constant factor j
| in the Italy which has changed so !
I much since he left it in 1925, Pro- |
fessor Salvemini , sounded vaguely j
reminiscent and prompted a query i
as to whether he would want, to re
turn there now.
His reply was emphatic: "No, . . .
there is no room for me there. . . .
I was one of the first to leave. Un
compromisingly, frankly I am op
posed to conditions as they are now
in Italy."
After he left Italy, Professor Sal
vemini stayed in Europe, in England
and France, for about three years
and then came to America where he
I settled down in Cambridge, Mass.,
I as a professor at Harvard.
TO RETURN NEXT YEAR
Although he must leave Stanford
at the end of November, he feels
that the War Libe affords him such
a wealth of material that he will
return next year for a longer stay,
perhaps four or five months.
Regarding his impressions of
Stanford as compared with Harvard.
Professor Salvemini said that from
the rare opportunities he has had to
| observe student lite closely he has
| the impression of a "free atmos-
I phere. At Harvard I see only flocks
) of boys; here 1 see a mixture and it
is a very pleasant variation."
