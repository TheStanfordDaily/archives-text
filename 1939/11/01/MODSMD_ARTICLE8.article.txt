# Biology School Holds Top Rank
## Marine, Insect Study Among Best in U.S. 
### BUD AMES 
Stantora s rsioiogy uepartment is
strong—one of the strongest in the
United States. And such it has been
since its founding in 1891 by the
Farm's first President, David Starr
Jordan, noted zoologist who, they
say, could name any fish on sight.
''In past years, our department
has been particularly noted for its
research work in fishery biology,"
said Associate Professor of Biology
Willis Johnson yesterday afternoon.
"A large number of our graduates
have gone into governmental fishery
research."
EMPHASIS SHIFTS
To further advance such marine
work, the Hopkins Marine Labora
tory at Pacific Grove came into be
ing, also in '91.
Seconding marine work in the past
has been Stanford's entomological
research—that is, the study of in
sects and insect control—a very
practical field in view of America's
numerous pests.
"Today, however, the emphasis
has changed in the Biology Depart
ment," continued Professor Johnson.
"Research Is no longer as pointed in
particular fields, but now covers
many fields of active investigation.
STUDY FIELDS VARY
Very generally speaking, today in
vestigation is going on in the fol
lowing varied and yet interrelated
fields: plant distribution, marine
biology, genetics, general physiology,
entomology, general protozoology,
experimental embryology, and pho
tobiology.
Such investigation requires a
vast, efficient working plant. The
biology building is just that—from
its catacombed white-washed cellar
to its crammed fourth floor. Few
