### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
communications from
independent powers are beauti
ful specimens of polite, vague rhe
toric. Usually the long, complex
phrases attempt .successfully to say
practically nothing. An English A
instructor, with a sharp red pencil
and an eye for the inevitable "unity,
coherence, and emphasis," might ac
complish a lot to clarify diplomatic
prose.
The press had a taste of "white pa
pers on parade" yesterday. Surpris
ingly enough, the two official docu
ments released were rather blunt,
reasonably definite and lucid â€” at
least in official parlance.
President Roosevelt, unwilling to
take it on the chin from Russia
without some retaliation, slapped
back at Foreign Commissar Viache
slav Molotov's criticism of United
States foreign policy by making pub
lic an exchange of messages that oc
curred last April. Russian President
Kalinin sympathized then, appar
ently, with Roosevelt's appeal to
Adolf Hitler for preservation of
world peace.
The messages shuttled back and
forth across the world last spring,
just ten days after Roosevelt's his
toric appeal to Hitler to guarantee
at least 10 years of peace in Europe.
Kalinin's telegram said:
* * *
"11/fR. PRESIDENT, I consider it
my pleasant duty to convey
to you my cordial congratulations
and an expression of profound
sympathy with the noble appeal
which you have addressed to the
governments of Germany and
Italy. You may rest assured that
your initiative finds most ardent
response in the hearts of the peo
ples of the Soviet Socialist Union.
Sincerely desirous of preservation
of universal peace. Kalinin."
To this cablegram, gracious Presi
dent Roosevelt replied, like a south
ern gentleman:
"I have x-eceived your friendly
message and am glad to learn that
your views with regard to my ef
fort on behalf of world peace are
similar to those expressed to me by
the heads of numerous other states.
Franklin D, Roosevelt."

r was last April. Today
things are different. Not only
did Molotov's speech before the Rus
sian parliament bring fire from the
White House, but it prodded the
House of Representatives into de
manding that America recall its am
bassador to Moscow.
Molotov simply said that repeal
of the arms embargo, approved
by (he Senate and pending in the
House, "would intensify, aggra
vate, and protract" the European
war. He was none too compli
mentary to Roosevelt, either, for
lending this country's "moral
support" to Finland in her quar
rel with Big Brother Soviet. In
an angry speech during House de
bate on the neutrality revision,
Rep. McCorniack of Massachusetts
accused Molotov of flagrant viola
tion of international law by seek
ing to influence opinion of Amer
icans 011 a vital issue.
* * >J:
It was fairly obvious, too, that
Molotov had something else in mind
besides the "moral support" of Fin
land. Secretary Stephen T. Eirly
wondered, in an official statement
yesterday, "why he chose a time
when the House was to make an
important vote." The possibility that
the Russian premier's speech might
influence the balloting was belittled
by both Isolationist and Democratic
leaders. The Administration men
believed it might help swing some
"doubtful" congressmen who bear a
hate for Communism behind the
President's program.
And, last night, the House went,
into a night session on the neutral
ity law, with less than 20 Congress
men in their seats at the last count.
