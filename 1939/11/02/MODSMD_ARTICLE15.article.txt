# Former Olympic Springboard Coach Tutors Farm Divers
## 
### BUD AMES 
"You've got to learn muscular control like the ballet dancers. Suppose
a ballet dancer came running in and spread his feet all over the place.
It would look like Hell, wouldn't it?"
For the first time in the afternoon, Ernie Brandsten. the man who
teaches Farm divers the ways and whys of the springboard, had raised his

- accented voice above its
usual caltn.
Ernie was tutoring a trio of as
piring divers. His official title is
Advisory Director of the 8.A.C.,
but he takes time every afternoon
from 12:30 to about 4 o'clock to
train springboard aspirants.
"I first began diving as a kid, in
the Stockholm, Sweden, Swimming
Club," Ernie explained. "Then in
1912 a became the Swedish high div
ing champion, which ended with my
! competing in the 1912 Olympic
games. I also was Olympic diving
coach in 1924, '28, '32, and '36. '
Emie was —he finally admitted—
first connected with Cal university.
That was in 1913 to 1915 and from
there he moved into the Stanford
B.A.C. Today his big interest is
running Searsville Lake, which he
leases from the University, but his
daily haunt is the Eneina pools.
"And Howie Adams is my idea of
the perfect diver," Ernie continued
without a break. "He has the proper
height —somewhere around 5 feet 7
—and he has perfect muscular con
trol with plenty of flex under the
shoulder blades. In reality, diving is
nothing but acrobatics over water.
And it takes much more training to
become a diver than it does to be
come an acrobat."
Ernie's pride is his internationally
accepted springboard with adjust
able fulcrum. This board has been
the only one used in national meets
around the world since 1920. "You
! can find 'em in South Africa and
even on the Persian Gull, he added
with much pride and without the
slightest trace of egotism.
"Each diver must have, due to
different weight, a different board
pitch for best performance," Ernie
explained. "With this adjustable
fulcrum, the one board can give any
desired pitch for every different
diver.
"Yes, and I'm pretty proud of the
Olympic divers I have trained here
at Stanford. There was Clarence
Pinkston in 1920, Albert White and
Dave Fall in 1924, and of course
Pete Desjardins in the 1928 Olym
pics.
"Am I married? Yes. I married
Greta Johanson, who was the
Olympic champion diver in 1912,
and who later became a swimming
teacher here at Stanford irom 1917
to 1926.
Ernie's whole life seems to be cen
tered around the springboard.

was a classic example of poor run

"You've got to learn muscular control like the ballet dancers. Suppose
a ballet dancer came running in and spread his feet all over the place.
It would look like Hell, wouldn't it?"
For the first time in the afternoon, Ernie Brandsten. the man who
teaches Farm divers the ways and whys of the springboard, had raised his

- accented voice above its
usual caltn.
Ernie was tutoring a trio of as
piring divers. His official title is
Advisory Director of the 8.A.C.,
but he takes time every afternoon
from 12:30 to about 4 o'clock to
train springboard aspirants.
"I first began diving as a kid, in
the Stockholm, Sweden, Swimming
Club," Ernie explained. "Then in
1912 a became the Swedish high div
ing champion, which ended with my
! competing in the 1912 Olympic
games. I also was Olympic diving
coach in 1924, '28, '32, and '36. '
Emie was —he finally admitted—
first connected with Cal university.
That was in 1913 to 1915 and from
there he moved into the Stanford
B.A.C. Today his big interest is
running Searsville Lake, which he
leases from the University, but his
daily haunt is the Eneina pools.
"And Howie Adams is my idea of
the perfect diver," Ernie continued
without a break. "He has the proper
height —somewhere around 5 feet 7
—and he has perfect muscular con
trol with plenty of flex under the
shoulder blades. In reality, diving is
nothing but acrobatics over water.
And it takes much more training to
become a diver than it does to be
come an acrobat."
Ernie's pride is his internationally
accepted springboard with adjust
able fulcrum. This board has been
the only one used in national meets
around the world since 1920. "You
! can find 'em in South Africa and
even on the Persian Gull, he added
with much pride and without the
slightest trace of egotism.
"Each diver must have, due to
different weight, a different board
pitch for best performance," Ernie
explained. "With this adjustable
fulcrum, the one board can give any
desired pitch for every different
diver.
"Yes, and I'm pretty proud of the
Olympic divers I have trained here
at Stanford. There was Clarence
Pinkston in 1920, Albert White and
Dave Fall in 1924, and of course
Pete Desjardins in the 1928 Olym
pics.
"Am I married? Yes. I married
Greta Johanson, who was the
Olympic champion diver in 1912,
and who later became a swimming
teacher here at Stanford irom 1917
to 1926.
