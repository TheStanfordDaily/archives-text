# Tickets Will Be Checked At Card-Trojan Grid Tilt, Affirms B.A.C. Manager
## Students Must Arrive at Stadium 45 Minutes Early to Assure Seats In L.A. Coliseum Rooting Section 
### AUDREY STEELE 
"Any Stanford student arriving 45 minutes before the kick-off of tho
Stanford-U.S.C. football game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on
Nov. 11. is assured of obtaining a seat in the rooters' section before the
game begins," affirm A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthbertson and Alfred R.
Masters, general manager of the Hoard of Athletic Control.

A strict validation of tickets will
be made adds Cuthbertson, and any
misuse of tickets and student body
cards will be treated as a violation
of tho Honor Code and will be pun
ished by either the Men's or Wom
en's Councils.
CHECKERS TO BE POSTED
Reliable student checkers will be
posted at all points open to Stanford
entrance, and any suspicious ticket
holder will be checked and investi
gated. Ridiculous questions such as
naming the captain of the Stanford
baseball team will not be used, how
ever. as a method of investigation.
The ticket-validation problem is
illustrated by the tie-up last year in
the South, when one-third of the
Stanford rooters were kept from
seeing the first quarter of the U. C.
L. A. game, through faulty check
ing methods.
However, the B.A.C. reports that
500 seats in the Card rooting section
were not occupied at any time, al
though tickets for those seats had
previously been sold, indicating the
prevalent fear of being caught with
someone else's student body card.
CARDS ALREADY TAKEN
The obvious need according to
Masters of some kind of ticket check
is evidenced by the report that from
20 to 50 student body cards have
been confiscated at every home game
this season from illegal users. These
cards are only returnable to owners
after the payment of a $2 fine.
Seriously concerned with a pos
sible tie-up, Ex Committee Tuesday
night suggested that there be no
check-up at all. In the event that a
check is necessary, the group sug
gested that the ticket-holder's sig
nature be compared with the signa
ture on the student body card. As
a future validation method it was
also suggested that pictures be
clamped on the student card, using
the pictorial check-up system.
