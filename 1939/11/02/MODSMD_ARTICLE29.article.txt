# Italian Decries Fascist States
## Professor Salvemini Says Duce to Lose 
### 
Professor Gaetano Salvemini cli
maxed his address before Luncheon
i Club yesterday with a dramatic plea
i "not to try a dictatorship of any
kind in your country" after he had
' reviewed Italy's neutrality dilemma
| and the general war-time situation
| in Europe.
Stating that Italy stood to lose no
matter which way she jumped, Pro
j lessor Salvemini said that if Mus
j solini went along with Hitler, as he
: inevitably must because of treaties
! and obligations, and it that combi-
I nation won the war, Mussolini could
' expect little or nothing from Hitler
j in the way of spoils.
On the other hand, if Hitler and
, Mussolini come out on the short end
of hostilities, the Italian dictator will
I be expected to share the losses and
! penalties.
Speaking of England and France,
| Professor Salvemini said that "they
are used to being generous where
| other people's territories are con
cerned."
