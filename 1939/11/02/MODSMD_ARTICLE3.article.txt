HELSINGFORS, Nov. 1 (UP). —
Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko an
nounced tonight that Finland, al
ready on a war basis, will "firmly
resist" Russia's demands for defense
bases on Finnish territory and de
militarization of the frontier.
Erkko spoke to an audience of
2500 persons, including President
Kyosti Kallio, at a national defense
fund meeting,
FINNS READY TO FIGHT
His strong indication that Finland
is resolved to fight, if necessary,
came as a Finnish mission neared
Moscow for a showdown on the Rus
sian demands as set forth last night
by Soviet Premier and Foreign
Commissar Viacheslav M. Molotov
in a speech before the Supreme So
viet.
The demands, involving military
and territorial concessions, were de
scribed in Helsingfors as "completely
unacceptable."
Molotov's alleged violation of a
secrecy agreement in prematurely
revealing the details of the negotia
tions was said by Erkko to have
"easily produced a strained and pe
culiar atmosphere."
SEEK NAVAL BASE
Russia, according to Molotov,
seeks a naval base on Finland's
coast to the northern entrance to
the Gulf of Finland—supposedly at
Hango—as well as revision of the
Carelian Isthmus frontier and de
militarization of the Finnish border.
"Finland has the right to defend
herself and this right must not be
infringed upon," Erkko said.
"It is important that we know, in
our hour of need, what forces can
preserve our freedom and neu
trality."
