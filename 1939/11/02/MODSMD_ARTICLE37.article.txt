# Thornhill Drills Cards On Aerial Defense As Santa Clara Came Nears
## Pete Kmetovic Sees First Siring Action on Offense, Moon Mullin Works Defense; Stand lee Stars 
### 
A pass scrimmage against a simulated Santa Clara aerial attack this
uilcrnoo?) will be the last contact work the Indian gridders will have before
meeting the rampaging Bronocs Saturday.
Tiny Thornhill sent the Indians through a rocking scrimmage in prac
tice last night, trying various combinations in an attempt to determine his

starting lineup. The varsity lowered,
the boom on both offense and de
fense, but seemed to' be having
trouble covering up on passes
pitched by Cookie South from Bron
co formations.
I'ASS SCRIMMAGE SET
After the workout Tiny announced
the pu.ss scrimmage for earlier this
afternoon, in order to give the .squad
a chance to see the Bronco passes in
daylight.
Moon Mullins worked with the
first string on defense last night, but
Pete Kmetovic saw action during the
offensive period.
Norm Standlee was in top form
during the workout, smashing
through the line for good gains and
firing passes to Hugh Gallarneau
and Gene Coldiron.
I'OOL AT QUARTER
Hump Pool worked at quarter in
the first string baekfield for about
ten minutes, and was opening some
nice holes for Kmetovic and Bob
Templeton to streak through.
The left guard situation is still up
in the air. Steve Keusseff and
Claude Purkitt, the latter shifted
from fourth string tackle at the start
of the week.
Another experiment was the use
ol Pete Kmetovic calling signals. The
scrum wasg't under game conditions,
but Kniet called most of the plays
during the half-hour period that the
first string had the ball.
NO BRONX SCRIMMAGES
Down> in Santa Clara Buck Shaw
has been handling his Broncos care
fully, no scrimmages being slated all
week.
Johnny Schiechl, standout center,
is suffering from a sore back that
was aggravated some by the Purdue
game, but Is expected to be ready to
play Saturday. Schiechl starred in
last year's Card-Bronco game, and
has been a mainstay of Shaw's, team
in their games this year.
STARTS SLOWLY
Santa Clara started slowly for a
change this season, but upset vic
tories over Slip Madigan's St. Mary's
Gaels and the Purdue Boilermakers
on successive week-ends will send
them into the Stadium favorites by
2-1 odds.
Jimmy Johnson, Jack Roche, and
Kenny Casanega are the top Santa
Clara baekfield threats. Johnson is
a tricky runner, an accurate passer,
and a sensational kicker.
Kenny Casanega, a sophomore, is
being hailed as one of the best pros
pects on the coast. Casanega has
been especially impressive flipping
passes.
