## 
### 
Coach Sherm Lockwood will have
his first opportunity to size up var
sity and frosh tennis prospects to
morrow afternoon when he sends a
tentative varsity team against the
best yearlings in a practice match.
According to Lockwood, his frosh
team will be the strongest in many
years. Among the top prospects at
present are Harper fnk, Emery Neal,
Charles Hutchinson, Hal Lamb, Tom
Krueger, Jim Frolich, and Jim Wade.
Wade is the third quarter frosh who
is expected to snatch a varsity spot
before the season is over.
Larry Dee. last year's frosh lead
er, is the probable number one man
for the varsity, with Bob Low in
the second position. Other return
ing lettermen are Captain Dave
Brock. Jim Seaver, Myron Folsom,
and Stan Owen.
