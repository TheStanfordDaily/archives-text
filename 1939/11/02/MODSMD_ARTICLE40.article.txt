ABOUT THINGS
IN GENERAL
There's a funny little tale about
Bill Trout, Stanford's massive right
tackle, in that debacle with Wash
ington last Saturday. It seems that
the Cardinals were taking a tre
mendous physical beating from the
rough-tough Huskies. With four
minutes left to go in the first half
Corky Donahue, first-string right
tackle, was removed from the game
with blood streaming from his eye
and his side badly stove in.
Coach Tiny Thornhill sent Trout
in to substitute for Donahue with
orders to rough things up in order
to install a little extra drive into
the Indian team.
Two plays later Trout was helped
from the game.
A couple of headlines in last
Monday's U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin
amused us. The Bruins, although
out-first-dovvned by a 16-5 mar
gin, managed to trim Oregon last
week-end. The banner on the
sports page read: "ROBINSON,
SOMMERS. HORSESHOE BEAT
DUCKS. 16-6."
Another headline reads: "CARD
BABES EKE OUT 40-0 WIN
OVER CUBS." It was close, but
the Papooses finally nosed the
Brubabes out.
Incidentally, when Jackie Rob
inson galloped 82 yards to a
touchdown against Oregon, it was
his first score of the season, al
though his sensational ball-car
rying has practically made the
U.C.L.A. team this year.

PICKING UP LOOSE

Last Friday Slants warned sports
enthusiasts that they would be miss
ing a gas-district rough-and-tumble
brawl if they passed up the U.S.C.-
Stanford water polo match.
But not even Slants knew that
the game would turn out to be the
embroglio it was. The stands were
hollering almost constantly at the
rough-house tactics of the Trojans.
For instance, Mickey Frary,
U.S.C. captain, was climbing all
over our Dave Nottage. riding his
shoulders and slipping him the
elbow. Then Jim Sellars tried to
kick Bob Plate's head off while the
latter was swimming behind him.
For the latter offense, Referee
Jim Smith, whose Fullerton J. C.
team played the preliminary against
the Indian junior varsity, ordered
Sellars out of the pool. The strange
thing about it all was that Sellars
had played under Smith for nine
years while at Fullerton High
School and Jaysee.
Incidentally, Stanford rooters need
not be ashamed of their own team.
The Indians were very cutely
roughing things up a bit too, al
though few teams could possibly ap
proach the Trojans in this respect.
I guess U.S.C. has been doing it too
long.

Although it is extremely doubt
ful (masterpiece of understate
ment) whether Stanford will rol
lick on the Rose Bowl turf this
New Year's day, at least one In
dian gridder has known the feel
ing of playing mi the Pasadena
greensward. He's John McDon
ough, reserve tackle, who played
IS games in the Rose Bowl while
at Pasadena Jaysee.
GRUT FROM THE
OTHER COLLEGES
California has a "Vow Boy" water
polo outfit, the Bears having sworn
not to shave until they win a con
ference game . It looks like Ihe
Bears might be straining their soup
through their beards before they
achieve their end.
Rayhurn Chase, sophomore full
hack at Marquette, is the father of
two children. Which reminds us
that there are two married men
on Stanford's football roster this
year.
Clint Evans, Cal's frosh grid
mentor, has had his teams lose only
17 games in 27 years of coaching.

Last Friday Slants warned sports
enthusiasts that they would be miss
ing a gas-district rough-and-tumble
brawl if they passed up the U.S.C.-
Stanford water polo match.
But not even Slants knew that
the game would turn out to be the
embroglio it was. The stands were
hollering almost constantly at the
rough-house tactics of the Trojans.
For instance, Mickey Frary,
U.S.C. captain, was climbing all
over our Dave Nottage. riding his
shoulders and slipping him the
elbow. Then Jim Sellars tried to
kick Bob Plate's head off while the
latter was swimming behind him.
For the latter offense, Referee
Jim Smith, whose Fullerton J. C.
team played the preliminary against
the Indian junior varsity, ordered
Sellars out of the pool. The strange
thing about it all was that Sellars
had played under Smith for nine
years while at Fullerton High
School and Jaysee.
Incidentally, Stanford rooters need
not be ashamed of their own team.
The Indians were very cutely
roughing things up a bit too, al
though few teams could possibly ap
proach the Trojans in this respect.
I guess U.S.C. has been doing it too
long.

Although it is extremely doubt
ful (masterpiece of understate
ment) whether Stanford will rol
lick on the Rose Bowl turf this
New Year's day, at least one In
dian gridder has known the feel
ing of playing mi the Pasadena
greensward. He's John McDon
ough, reserve tackle, who played
IS games in the Rose Bowl while
at Pasadena Jaysee.
GRUT FROM THE
OTHER COLLEGES
California has a "Vow Boy" water
polo outfit, the Bears having sworn
not to shave until they win a con
ference game . It looks like Ihe
Bears might be straining their soup
through their beards before they
achieve their end.
Rayhurn Chase, sophomore full
hack at Marquette, is the father of
two children. Which reminds us
that there are two married men
on Stanford's football roster this
year.
Clint Evans, Cal's frosh grid
mentor, has had his teams lose only
17 games in 27 years of coaching.
ABOUT THINGS
IN GENERAL
There's a funny little tale about
Bill Trout, Stanford's massive right
tackle, in that debacle with Wash
ington last Saturday. It seems that
the Cardinals were taking a tre
mendous physical beating from the
rough-tough Huskies. With four
minutes left to go in the first half
Corky Donahue, first-string right
tackle, was removed from the game
with blood streaming from his eye
and his side badly stove in.
Coach Tiny Thornhill sent Trout
in to substitute for Donahue with
orders to rough things up in order
to install a little extra drive into
the Indian team.
Two plays later Trout was helped
from the game.
A couple of headlines in last
Monday's U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin
amused us. The Bruins, although
out-first-dovvned by a 16-5 mar
gin, managed to trim Oregon last
week-end. The banner on the
sports page read: "ROBINSON,
