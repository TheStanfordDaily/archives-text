# Papooses Drill for Cal Game
## 
### 
Coach Harry Shipkey will have
one more chance to look at his team's
arch rivals, California's freshmen,
before that all important game on
Nov. 11. The opportunity will come
next Saturday afternoon when the
Bear Cubs meet Long Beach Junior
College in Berkeley.
"I only hope Long Beach presses
Cal's freshmen," hoped Mr. Shipkey,
"for I want to see what Cal really
has."
The Card yearlings are working
hard this week on their offense. Yes
terday the second string meet the
first stringers in an intensive drill.
There will be a lighter workout to
day and then the week will end
with a bang-up intersquad scrim
mage.
The squad will be split into two
teams which will, stage a lull 60 min

i ute game for the benefit of the public
on the frosh practice field tomorrow
I at 4 o'clock.
After Shipkey gets a look at. the
transbay rivals, he will have the in
formation necessary to drill his men
against Cal's plays. So he has set
j aside next week for the defensive
: work.
