# Booters Win 3 to 1 Victory Over Menlo J.C.
## Coach Maloney Sees Improvement in Win; Prepares for U.S.F. 
### 
Snapping out of a one-game slump, i
the Farm's varsity soccer team
whipped a tough Menlo Junior Col- j
lege eleven, 3-1, yesterday.
It marked Stanford's fourth con
ference victory against one set-back
â€”that against San Jose State, 2-1, j
last week. Saturday morning at 10
o'clock Coach Harry Malrmey will |
send the club against the University
of San Francisco, which .should pro
vide all the thrills that the Spartan-
Card tilt did as well as help straight
en out the conference standings.
MENLO HELPS INDIANS
The Indian soccermen scored with ;
the help of Menlo itself for the first
point. In the first quarter the ball !
was booted into the net vrfien the ;
Card /forwards were pressing the j
Menlo backs and an attempted kick- :
out backlield.
Chris Sontum, the club's high ;
scoring forward, connected for two j
out of three attempted penalty kicks j
in the second and third periods, i
Menlo scored in the fourth quarter.
CARDS IMPROVE
Decided improvement all along
the way marked Stanford's play, j
The forwards were beating their op- |
ponents to the ball, passing accu- j
rately, and playing a generally good 1
game.
With unlimited substitution, just
about everything on the Stanford:
bench saw action.
More work will be in store for I
the team this afternoon and tomor
row before Maloney will be satis- j
fied that his men are set for the !
U.S.F. game.
