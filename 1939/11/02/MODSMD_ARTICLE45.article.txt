# Track Team Guns For 1940 Season
## 
### 
Under the watchful eye of Bill
Ellington, the "scanty-clads" out at
Angel 1 Field continue to work on
their respective track and field
events in preparation for the 1940
season.
Yesterday Ellington had several
runners timed in the 350, the old
conditioning distance which has been
a favorite with Stanford coaches.
Simpson turned in the best time,
being clocked in 40.1.
Ohio State Universily coeds have
organized a personal appearance
clinic to teach correct dress and
make-up.
