was broken today when the Water
front Employers Association an
nounced resumption of contract, dis
cussions with the International
Longshoremen's and Warehouse
men's Union tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
Negotiations broke off last Wed
nesday when a CIO-AFL jurisdic

ham, Wash., and longshoremen re
fused to pass a picket line around
the steamer Point Ancha. Work was
resumed there this morning.
The waterfront, bargaining since
contracts expired Sept. 1 under a
mutual truce has produced a one
year contract with the Sailors Un
ion of the Pacific and a two-year
contract with marine firemen.
