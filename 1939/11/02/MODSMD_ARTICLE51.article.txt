# Honor Among Thieves
## 
### 
FIVE hundred seats were vacant. Five hun
dred students who had purchased tickets
for the U.C.L.A. game last year failed to use
them.
The B.A.C. could draw only this conclusion:
413 people had been frightened away by the
announcement that all rooters' tickets would be
validated at the gate, and 87 had been refused
admission because they were using student
body cards that did not belong to them. An
unknown number of non-Stanford students had
gotten in without being detected.
With such figures carved deep in the record
of experience, General Manager A1 Masters
does not feel justified in abolishing check-ups
this year in favor of an honor system. Even
at local games between 20 and 50 student body
cards have been confiscated every Saturday
this season. And the two-dollar fines levied
against the offenders do not seem to remedy the
evil.
Last year, after an outraged one-third of the
rooting section had spent the first quarter of the
game waiting in line outside of the Los Ange
les Coliseum, Ex Committee recommended that
identification photographs be attached to every
student body card. However, no action was
taken on this suggestion.
Today the B.A.C. again is faced with the same
problem.
In the light of bitter past experience, it feels
that validation of rooters' tickets is neither un
fair nor improper—as long as any student who
arrives at the stadium 45 minutes before the
game starts, gets to his seat in time for the
kick-off.
But, at best, this is only a temporary answer
to the question.
Any system of validation is completely at
odds with the principles of the Honor Code and
student government as they have been suc
cessfully put into practice at Stanford. The
Board of Athletic Control is an integral part of
the University, not an independent corporation.
And any of its functions that involve the student
body should be governed by Honor Code stand
ards.
It is the duty of Ex Committee and Men's and
Women's Councils to devise a system by which
the lpnding of student body cards can be
stopped without validation. Perhaps stringent
punishment of violators of the "non-transfer
able" rule would do the trick.
There is no reason why the Honor Code
should stop working merely because a little
money is involved.

Were their potential occupants lined up out
side of the stadium trying to remember the
name of the baseball captain?

of experience, General Manager A1 Masters
does not feel justified in abolishing check-ups
this year in favor of an honor system. Even
at local games between 20 and 50 student body
cards have been confiscated every Saturday
this season. And the two-dollar fines levied
against the offenders do not seem to remedy the
evil.
Last year, after an outraged one-third of the
rooting section had spent the first quarter of the
game waiting in line outside of the Los Ange
les Coliseum, Ex Committee recommended that
identification photographs be attached to every
student body card. However, no action was
taken on this suggestion.
Today the B.A.C. again is faced with the same
problem.
In the light of bitter past experience, it feels
that validation of rooters' tickets is neither un
fair nor improper—as long as any student who
arrives at the stadium 45 minutes before the
game starts, gets to his seat in time for the
kick-off.
But, at best, this is only a temporary answer
to the question.
Any system of validation is completely at
odds with the principles of the Honor Code and
student government as they have been suc
cessfully put into practice at Stanford. The
Board of Athletic Control is an integral part of
the University, not an independent corporation.
And any of its functions that involve the student
body should be governed by Honor Code stand
ards.
It is the duty of Ex Committee and Men's and
Women's Councils to devise a system by which
the lpnding of student body cards can be
stopped without validation. Perhaps stringent
punishment of violators of the "non-transfer
able" rule would do the trick.
There is no reason why the Honor Code
should stop working merely because a little
money is involved.
Five hundred seats were vacant.
Were their potential occupants lined up out
side of the stadium trying to remember the
name of the baseball captain?
FIVE hundred seats were vacant. Five hun
dred students who had purchased tickets
for the U.C.L.A. game last year failed to use
them.
The B.A.C. could draw only this conclusion:
413 people had been frightened away by the
announcement that all rooters' tickets would be
validated at the gate, and 87 had been refused
admission because they were using student
body cards that did not belong to them. An
unknown number of non-Stanford students had
gotten in without being detected.
With such figures carved deep in the record
of experience, General Manager A1 Masters
