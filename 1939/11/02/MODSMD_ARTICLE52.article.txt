# War Drums

### 
CONSCIOUUSLY or unconsciously, Ameri
ca's war drums are beginning to pound a
slow, steady beat. The American press is be
ginning to run a little yellow.
It is probably unpremeditated at this time
and there is not one chance in a hundred that
anything will come of it. But the habit is dan
gerous.
It was unthought of back in the '90's, until
it was developed by Messrs. Hearst and Pu
litzer. There was a war going on at the time
between Spain and her colonies. It was a war,
that is, after Hearst and Pulitzer took it in hand.
First they made this country vividly aware
that there was trouble in the world, and then,
that the trouble was very close to home, and
then, that home was in danger.
It was all talk in two New York newspapers,
but it got the United States into the Spanish-
American War. '
It was 1916 before the newspapers got any
place telling the American people that their
rights were being damaged. There was an
other war going on. Sure, war made good copy
and sold papers, but give your stories a local
angle, boys, something that will interest every
man, woman, and child in the nation.
So the headlines screamed that the Lusitania
had been sunk. It took several months, the
bosses were getting a little worried—but we
did end up in the war.
And the newspapers could say, "We did our I
part."
In the 1920'5, the old technique failed. Mr. !
Hearst looked at his circulation figures: they j

could be better. He looked around from his
home in San Simeon. What, he asked, worried
him that he might be able to get people in
general to worry about? There were three
things:
(1) An earthquake might come and ruin San
Simeon—and miniature San Simeons all over
the state of California.
(2) The Japanese might mobilize their war
machine and send it against the United States.
(3) The men from Mars might descend in a
mighty horde on this planet.
The business about the Japanese was obvi
ously the best copy for the longest period of
time. He took it and worked it for all it was
worth—but he failed. No war.
And now today.
There has been a British steamer sunk in
mid-Atlantic. It is a fair second-page story. It
is being played on the front pages of America's
newspapers, sometimes in the best spot on
those pages.
You see, most of the countries in the Western
Hemisphere held a conference recently down
in Panama. They decided there what the bound
aries of neutrality on these two continents
would be.
Now people think that this ship may have
been sunk inside these boundaries. The story
isn't that a British freighter has been sunk, or
that perhaps the Germans have sunk it.
The story is that it has been sunk inside our
neutral boundaries. That, by God, is serious.
And the newspapers begin a slow, steady
beat.—D. J.
