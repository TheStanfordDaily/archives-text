### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
IGNORING THE APPLE
I INCOLN STEFFENS, America's keenest journalist
up until the day he died, made a very profound
analysis of sin. "Some people blame the evils of the
world on Adam," he said. "Some blame Eve, and some
blame the serpent. But 1 blame the apple."
Behind Steffens' parable is the most civilized, tol
erant element in almost every religion: Judge not; all
men alike are products of circumstance. Apples of
temptation are always with us. Different people yield
to varying extents, depending upon the people and
the conditions. Only saints are perfectly resistant.
And everyone has his own definition of the world's
omnipresent apple.
For Julius Caesar the apple was power. For Mark
Antony it was self-indulgence. Senator George Norris'
apple is public-betrayal, and he has never taken a
bite.
One apple that is usually covered with a lot of
foliage, and one that most of us bloat ourselves on, is
forgetting how many bites we ourselves have taken.
And because we forget so readily, we always find a
serpent to blame. We seldom have the understanding
to blame other people's faults 011 their particularly
beloved apples.
* * * #
/ I OLLEGE life may have its special kinds of tempta-
J tions. The normal ones of us all fall heir to
those. But one weakness that the outside observer
might imagine us to be fairly free of is corruption.
There isn't much money or the unsatisfied need of it
to serve as apples. But there is a weakening influence
here, as there would be in the most moneyless so
ciety: the pressure of friendship and loyalties.
All of us can think of instances in which student
officers wouldn't "do their duty" because they can't
overlook doing a "favor" for a friend. Most of the
friendship-bound frailties of character do not involve
great transgressions. They are not important in the
absolute quantity of corruption involved. The occur
rence is infrequent. The quantity is practically negli
gible. But they are interesting in that they should
convince us of th< difficulty of overcoming graft when
the applies are bigger, redder, and more numerous.
It is therefore encouraging to note that. Interfra
ternity Council's head made the following answer
when asked if he would let off personal friends for
infraction of rushing rules: "No matter who they are,
we'll prosecute them."
Most people cling to the platitude that the old are
corrupt, and youth is honest. But even youthful
idealism, raised in a hot-house, is rare.

Most people cling to the platitude that the old are
corrupt, and youth is honest. But even youthful
idealism, raised in a hot-house, is rare.
IGNORING THE APPLE
I INCOLN STEFFENS, America's keenest journalist
up until the day he died, made a very profound
analysis of sin. "Some people blame the evils of the
world on Adam," he said. "Some blame Eve, and some
blame the serpent. But 1 blame the apple."
Behind Steffens' parable is the most civilized, tol
erant element in almost every religion: Judge not; all
men alike are products of circumstance. Apples of
temptation are always with us. Different people yield
to varying extents, depending upon the people and
the conditions. Only saints are perfectly resistant.
And everyone has his own definition of the world's
omnipresent apple.
For Julius Caesar the apple was power. For Mark
Antony it was self-indulgence. Senator George Norris'
apple is public-betrayal, and he has never taken a
bite.
One apple that is usually covered with a lot of
foliage, and one that most of us bloat ourselves on, is
forgetting how many bites we ourselves have taken.
And because we forget so readily, we always find a
serpent to blame. We seldom have the understanding
to blame other people's faults 011 their particularly
beloved apples.

/ I OLLEGE life may have its special kinds of tempta-
J tions. The normal ones of us all fall heir to
those. But one weakness that the outside observer
might imagine us to be fairly free of is corruption.
There isn't much money or the unsatisfied need of it
to serve as apples. But there is a weakening influence
here, as there would be in the most moneyless so
ciety: the pressure of friendship and loyalties.
All of us can think of instances in which student
officers wouldn't "do their duty" because they can't
overlook doing a "favor" for a friend. Most of the
friendship-bound frailties of character do not involve
great transgressions. They are not important in the
absolute quantity of corruption involved. The occur
rence is infrequent. The quantity is practically negli
gible. But they are interesting in that they should
convince us of th< difficulty of overcoming graft when
the applies are bigger, redder, and more numerous.
