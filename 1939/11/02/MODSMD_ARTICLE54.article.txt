# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						SPIRIT OF BROTHERLY LOVE 
### 
r pHE EDITOR. SIR:
I have a confession to make. I have been taken
in by the subversive propaganda in the column of
your treacherous Mr. MellinkofT. If it hadn't been for
A.M.D.G., I dare say I would never have realized that
I was being exposed to un-American, Communistic,
Fascistic principles.
I blush to admit that in Mr. MellinkofFs article of
October 24, entitled, "Thou Shalt Not Kill," I was so
naive as to see a commentary on the queer contradic
tion that leads us to give helpless, hopeless idiots the
best of care, while we send our useful citizens off to
be destroyed at war. I am grateful to A.M.D.G. for
explaining that apparent paradox. Of course, as he
says, this is the state's recognition that it has no
right to take the life of its members without just
cause.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
M.D.G.'s spirit of brotherly love really shows Mr.
* MellinkofT in his true colors, too. Contrast the
selfish spirit of one who rails at i\ relatively small
outlay of taxes that keeps human monstrosities se
cluded from our sight (Mr. M.), and the fine spirit of
one who would go about exercising charity and learn
ing brotherly love by his personal contacts with "these
so-called idiots" he defends in his letter.
I only hope Mr. MellinkofT can profit by the com
parison. He might even stop fussing about the war,
and devote his energy to developing brotherly love
(for idiots), as A.M.D.G. suggested, in pointing out that
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" is an im
portant. commandment, too.
A.M.D.G,, accept this expression of gratitude from
one whose misguided footsteps you have redirected
to American, non-Communistic, non-Fascistic ideals
of righteousness and truth!
Thankfully yours,
M. D.

M.D.G.'s spirit of brotherly love really shows Mr.

selfish spirit of one who rails at i\ relatively small
outlay of taxes that keeps human monstrosities se

one who would go about exercising charity and learn
ing brotherly love by his personal contacts with "these
so-called idiots" he defends in his letter.
I only hope Mr. MellinkofT can profit by the com
parison. He might even stop fussing about the war,
and devote his energy to developing brotherly love
(for idiots), as A.M.D.G. suggested, in pointing out that
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" is an im
portant. commandment, too.
A.M.D.G,, accept this expression of gratitude from
one whose misguided footsteps you have redirected
to American, non-Communistic, non-Fascistic ideals
of righteousness and truth!
Thankfully yours,
M. D.

r pHE EDITOR. SIR:
I have a confession to make. I have been taken
in by the subversive propaganda in the column of
your treacherous Mr. MellinkofT. If it hadn't been for
A.M.D.G., I dare say I would never have realized that
I was being exposed to un-American, Communistic,
Fascistic principles.
I blush to admit that in Mr. MellinkofFs article of
October 24, entitled, "Thou Shalt Not Kill," I was so
naive as to see a commentary on the queer contradic
tion that leads us to give helpless, hopeless idiots the
best of care, while we send our useful citizens off to
be destroyed at war. I am grateful to A.M.D.G. for
explaining that apparent paradox. Of course, as he
says, this is the state's recognition that it has no
right to take the life of its members without just
cause.
