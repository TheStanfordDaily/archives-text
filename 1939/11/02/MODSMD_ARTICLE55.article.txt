# Caustic Study Exposes Work Of Lobbyists

"The Pressure Boys"—Kenneth G.
Crawford; on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore.
This book, says Mr. Crawford, "is |
the unrepressed personal bias of a
professionally impartial observer
with no political affiliations and no
doctrinaire axes to grind."
That may very well be, and a nice
piece of understatement it is, too.
Mr. C.. in reality, lets go with all six
chambers of his trusty .45 at almost ]
every American phenomenon you
can think of—Will Hays, the movies,
the sugar industry, the labor unions,
the DuPonts, clear down to that per
petual sideshow, the Dies committee.
Based on his observations as a
Washington correspondent for an
unnamed paper, but which may be
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the book
deals mainly with the activities of
the Washington lobbyists and their
staunch defense of the property in- >
terests at the expense of democracy
and the general welfare.
WRITES SMOOTHLY
Written in a very smoothly inte
grated style, with a blistering apt
ness of simile and metaphor, Mr.
Crawford's book presents an as- j
founding array of damning evidence.'
He shows that the public has been '
and is now being kicked around by j
the pressure boys to the tune of the I
greatest good for the smallest num
ber.
King of the lobbyists, Mr. Craw- '
ford asserts, is the redoubtable Don- j
aid R. Richberg, whose clients in- j
elude, among other big guns, Henry j
Ford, the Standard Oil Company, j
and the Giannini interest.
FINDS MANY THINGS
Mr. Crawford found out lots of
things during his membership in the j
Washington press corps. For in- ■
stance, in this book are one man's |
answers to what happened to the |
government's mercantile marine sub- j
sidies, why you get nine bad movies i
to every good one, who's back of |
the pro-Fascist American Liberty
League and the Associated Farmers, !
why we joined World War 1, and
what caused the Dies committee to
"drag Shirley Temple into the Com- :
munists by her curls." In fact, Mr. |
Crawford answers everything but
who threw the overalls in Mrs.
Murphy's chowder.
Seriously though, Mr. Crawford,
for all his glib denunciations and
generalizations, comes to some pretty
sensible conclusions. He holds that j
democracy is still the most satisfac- |
tory in spite of its precarious and i
embattled position and its constant 1
perversion by selfish minorities such j
as lobbyists and propagandists.
The things that will help most to !
strengthen its position, he believes, i
are the growth of both white-collar
unions and an intelligent labor press.
"We must all realize," he concludes, ,
"that prosperity flows up from the :
roots, not down from the leaves."—
