### 
CRISTOBAL, C.Z., Nov. 1 (UP).â€”
It was reliably reported here to
night the German tanker Emmy
Fiiederich, with 40,000 barrels of
Mexican oil aboard, was sunk by
its own crew in the Caribbean Sea
on Oct. 24 to prevent capture of the
vessel and its cargo by the British
cruiser Despatch.
Sun Beau is the leading money
winning horse of all time.
