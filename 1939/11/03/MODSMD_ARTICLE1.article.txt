will be no blackout of
peace in America."
That's what President Roosevelt
told the United States two months
ago; yesterday the American Con
gress, sitting in special session, re
pealed the arms embargo, moved to
accomplish what their leader said
would be the best way to prevent
that blackout of peace.
As the world expected, Germany
was quick in retaliation. As soon
as news of the bill's passage reached
Berlin, a Nazi propaganda spokes
man accused the United States of
giving "outright support" to Great
Britain and France. Warning that
German U-boats probably will in
tensify their activities in the Atlan
tic in an effort to sink as many
arms-carrying ships as possible, the
Nazis charged that repeal of the
arms ban threatens "to drag the
United States into war."
While the revision, with its cash
and carry clause, may open the
way for large British arms and
munitions purchases, most ob
servers have overlooked the ob
vious fact that it will lead to
rather drastic curtailment of Brit
ish imports- of U.S. industrial and
agricultural products.

QNE authoritative source esti
mates British imports may fall as
much as $150,000,000 a year. Im
porters in England said that Brit
ain's anticipated heavy purchases of"
war supplies from the United States
would be offset "to a substantial de
gree" by curtailment of imports of
"non-essential" industrial and agri
cultural products. And it is these
same "non-essentials" that, in nor
mal years, yield millions of dollars
to American exporters, industrial
ists, farmers.
Whether or not he realizes it,
Roosevelt will have to tackle a
knotty problem if Allied curtail
ment of buying reaches large pro
portions. It's not going to he as
smooth sailing as the Adminis
tration anticipated.
Even since the outbreak of the
war, exportation of tobacco, auto
mobiles, women's apparel, shoes,
hosiery, dried fruits and California
barley have been reduced drastic
ally. And, relentlessly, the curtail -
ment will continue in order to pro
tect exchange and permit unlimited
purchases of arms and munitions
lrom the United States.

r J A IIE effect of this reduction of
imports from the United States
will he no local affair. Undoubt
edly it will be felt keenly over
widespread areas â€” New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, the
grain belt of the Middle West, the
tobacco districts of the South, and
the fruit zones of Florida and
California.
Look at the situation. Already
imports in England of American au
tomobiles, usually amounting to
about $12,000,000 a year, virtually
has ceased. America's $85,000,000 to
bacco business is dwindling as rap
idly as an A.S.S.U. dance commit
tee's budget. And, although cotton
imports probably won't be affected,
canned vegetables and fruits already
have been restricted. Absolutely no
grapes are arriving in England from
the United Sattes. American grains
are leaving the country in extreme
ly small amounts. The $6,000,000 a
year Pacific Coast barley business
is expected to be hard hit.
And. no matter how much the
war harons may cry with glee at
the repeal of America's manda
tory arms embargo, the rest of the
country should realize it's not go
ing to be all crushed pineapple on
a silver platter.
