# Roth Declaims Fear of Coast Shipping Tieup
## 
### 
Current fears that a Pacific Coast
waterfront labor tie-up is imminent
were derided by Almon E. Roth,
president of the San Francisco Em
ployers' Council, in an informal talk
before a labor problems class yes
terday.
In his position as key man in the
shipping owners' organization, the
former Stanford comptroller said he
has repeatedly advised San Fran- j
cisco merchants that shipping will
proceed normally and that there is
no reason to fear that Christmas or
ders from the East will be tied up
in the port.
"Present contracts between the j
Employers' Council and the United j
Longshore Workers will be renewed
without any major discord sufficient
to close the port," he said.
Heart of current waterfront labor
dispute on the Pacific Coast is the
persistent ignoring of contracts by
the unions, he commented. One
hundred and eighty "quickie" or
"job action" strikes in the last 18 j
months have been caused by long- I
shoremen's demands in excess of ex- !
isting contracts. He said he knew of ;
not one such strike which could be j
traced to an employer violation of J
contract.
"We've given San Francisco's |
4000 union-registered longshoremen
a six-hour day with a wage which
averages $200 per month," Roth de
clared. "The contracts were signed
on this basis, and attempts to get
more by pulling 'quickies' on the
job in direct violation of contract
must stop.
"We don't care how hard the
longshoremen fight for high wages
before contracts are signed, but if
they persist in agitating after the
contracts are on paper we will have
to close the port temporarily in re
taliation."
He pointed out that such closures
of the port constitute a weapon of
the employers to be used just as the
labor interests use strikes.
"Collective bargaining, the heart
of labor-employer relations, has al
ways been to the advantage of la
bor," he commented. "Such organi
zations as the Employers' Council
gives to employers an equal strength
in collective bargaining with labor.
When both sides respect the strength
of the other, labor relations im
prove."

Medicine had 2,000 applications for
110 vacancies in its freshman class.
