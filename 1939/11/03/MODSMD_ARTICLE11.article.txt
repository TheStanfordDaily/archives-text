# Sophs' Gayway Opens Tonight
## Music by Sterling Young to Be Featured 
### 
"Go Gayway with the Sophs."
Expectations will turn to realities
at 9 o'clock tonight when the doors
of a transformed Women's Gym open
on the annual Sophomore Cotillion.
With Sterling Young providing his
"sterling music for young dancers"
and Bobby Ennis, the petite "South
ern songstress" from Mississippi,
supplying the vocals, the Class of '42
has aimed to please the majority
with the best in smooth musical
background for the Gayway dancers.
The members of Bob Snoddy's
decoration committee have been out
doing themselves to truly recreate
many of the famous Treasure Isle
concession—in Stanford prototype.
Bids, as designed by Jack Hurt,
will still be on sale in all fraternity
houses, eating clubs, and men's halls
by sophomore representatives on Jim
Haugh's ticket committee.
Adopting the policy of not raising
the Cotillion bid price, no matter
how big the name band, $2.50 re
mains the charge for bids, which
may also still be purchased at the
A.S.S.U. office and at the door.
Dress will follow the dictates of
Cotillion tradition and be semi-for
mal.
