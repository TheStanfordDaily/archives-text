# Dr. Angell Dies; Farm Mourns Loss of Savant
## First Indian Track Coach Passes at 82 After Brief Illness 
### 
Stanford lost one of the remaining
members of its pioneer faculty with
the sudden passing of Emeritus Pro
fessor Frank Angell at his Palo Alto
home early yesterday morning.
Dr. Angell, who was 82 years old,
had been in poor health for some
time but was not considered seri
ously ill until Wednesday night.
Head of the Stanford Psychology
Department from 1892 until his re
tirement in 1922, Dr. Angell was ac
tive on the campus during the years
of the University's early develop
ment. He came to the Farm origi
nally at the request of President
David Starr Jordan, who had become
interested in his experimental work
at Cornell.
PIONEER TRACK COACII
However, Dr. Angell is best loved
by Stanford students and alumni
alike for his undying interest in the
development of track and field
events on the Pacific Coast. He was
the first Indian track coach and one
of the men most responsible for
popularization of the sport among
Western schools.
As chairman of the faculty com
mittee on athletics, he took an ac
tive interest in Stanford sports long
after he had given up coaching, and
until his death was a familiar figure
during most Card track practices
and meets. His great service to the
sport was recognized by the Uni
versity with the naming of Angell
Field in his honor.
LEADER IN ALL FIELDS
President Ray Lyman Wilbur said
of Dr. Angell yesterday:
"Frank Angell had real dynamic
force which he exercised not only in
his chosen subject of psychology but
in the general field of athletics. He
had a keen appreciation of excel
lence and of competition but at the
same time was interested in those
who struggled for third and fourth
places. This led him to accept re
sponsibility for leadership in ath
letics in the early days of Stanford.
"He always stood for sport in its
best sense and had the highest per
sonal ideas of conduct on the ath
letic field. I think that his influence
had more to do than that of any
other man in the development, of
widespread wholesome sports among
the colleges of the Pacific slope."
WORKED WITH HOOVER
In addition to his academic and
athletic activities, Dr. Angell dis
tinguished himself for his work with
Herbert Hoover on the Belgian Relief
Commission during the World War.
For this service he was made a Che
valier de l'Ordrc de la Couronnc by
by the King of Belgium in 1919.
He is survived by two sons, Thom
as Angell of Palo Alto and Charles
Angell of Berkeley, and a daugh
ter, Mrs. Mabel Patton of Palo Alto,
all former Stanford students.
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, emeritus
chaplain of the University and a
friend of many years' standing, will
conduct the funeral services which
will be held from the family resi
dence at 2 o'clock Sunday afternoon.
