# Bronc Team Favored 2-1 In Grid Clash Tomorrow; Stanford Lineup in Doubt
## Tiny Rehearses Razzle-Dazzle Plays For Tough Santa Clara Defense; Norm Standlee Set in Passing Role 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Four long years ago, way back in the fall of '35, Monk Moscrip hooted
a field goal in the closing minutes of play to give the Vowing Sophs a 9-G
victory over Buck Shaw's Broncos.
Since then the Santa Clarans have won three straight games from Indian
teams. Tomorrow Tiny Thornhill will send his Card varsity, 2-1 under-

(dogs, into the stadium to try and
end the three-year drought.
NEW PLAYS SECRET
In secret practice this week Coach
Thornhill has been drilling the squad
in new plays designed to give the
Broncs a very busy afternoon.
Wednesday's scrimmage saw Tiny
shuffling his players in an effort to
find the right combination. The Card
starting line-up will remain in
doubt until the kick-off tomorrow
afternoon.
LEFT HALF UNCERTAIN
Left halfback is the most uncer
tain spot on the Indian eleven. Moon
Mullin appeal's the most likely
starter now because of his fine
showing against the Washington
Huskies last week. Pete Kmetovic
may get the call, however, because
of his deceptive running style.
Frankie Albert, most publicized
sophomore on the Coast l>efore the
season started, has been demoted to
the third-string job.
BRONCS TIED UTAH
In their opening game the Broncs
traveled to Salt Lake City, and it
took everything Ihey had to gain a
tic with the University of Utah
eleven. Later the Shawmen drop
ped a close one to the tough Texas
Aggies and were tied by U.S.F.,
13-13.
A sudden reversal of form gave
the Broncos a 7-0 win over St.
Mary's, and last Saturday they upset
a favored Purdue eleven up in
Kezar Stadium, 13-G.
KEUSSEFF LEFT GUARD
Steve Kcussoff seems to have won
himself the left guard post vacated
by Johnny Kerman, though big
Claude Purkitt has been working
well on defense during the week.
Dave Patterson has done a good job
of taking over the other guard spot,
since the shake-up before the Bruin
game, and will probably start.
Andy Stojkovich turned in his
best game of the year against the
Broncs in last year's 22-0 disaster,
and will be in there at his regular
right end post. Stan Graff will take
care of the other flank.
TACKLES ALL SET
The tackles appear setâ€”Stan An
derson and Corky Donahue. Big
Andy has been a GO-minute bul
wark in the forward wall since his
great performance in the Oregon
tilt.
Jim Verdiek is a fixture at center.
Playing his first year in a Card uni
form, Verdiek has proved himself
an accurate passer and a steady
defensive player. Backing up the
line, Verdiek is one of the best men
on pass defense that the Indians
have.
STANDI,EE TO START
Norm Standlee will start at full
back, fire or flood notwithstanding.
In addition to wrecking op
ponents' lines, Standlee does most of
the Indian punting, and throws an
occasional pass. If Kmetovic starttf
at the left wingback spot, Norm will
probably be the main Card aerial
threat.
Gene Coldiron still has the first
string quarter assignment, but Hamp
Pool has improved rapidly in prac
tice. Either Jim Groves or Hugh
Gallarneau will open at right half.
The Indians, in their new silver
football pants, will line up for the
kick-off at 2 o'clock. There will be
no freshman game.
