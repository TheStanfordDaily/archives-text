Broad shoulders — silver - fringed ;

lighted an entranced audience when j
Don Blanding, the wandering poet, !
chatted of vagabondia with more
than 200 delighted listeners yester- |
day afternoon in the Women's Club
house lounge.
The Oklahoma - bred Hawaiian j
verse writer, as he terms himself, |
sketched a fascinating picture of a
capricious career, interspersing his |
comments with bits of poetry.
Casting his audience under a spell j
of mystery, Blanding only turned i
about to read a few lines of sheer j
comedy. With his "Vagabond's |
House" that is " —just a dream-house
anyway," he received his most ap
preciative applause.
Questioned about his writing, the
wanderlust poet grinned that "I draw
all the illustrations and the front
and the tail covers of the book, and
then when I absolutely have to, I !
actually get down to writing the j
verses, because I'm in the mood for j
them then."
Reading from "Drifter's Gold," his '
latest book, he presented what he
called his only poem with a moral, !
when he wishes there was a junk '
man to take away "old woes" instead i
of old clothes.
