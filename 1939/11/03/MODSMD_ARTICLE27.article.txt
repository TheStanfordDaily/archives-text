# THIS BRONCO CAN TACKLE, TOO

JIM JOHNSON, usually considered the outstanding offensive threat of
the Santa Clara eleven, shows he can do a good secondary defensive
work as he tackles Jack Crainpton' in the St. Mary's game which the
Broncos won, 7-0. Purdue was the next victim of Buck Shaw's men,
and the Indians hope they won't fall into the same category tomorrow.
