# Spoolers to Hit Comeback Trail In U.S.F. Battle
## Card Soccer Eleven Primed For Tough Tilt With Dons Tomorrow 
### 
Take it from Coach Harry Ma
loney that the Farm's soccer varsity
should be ready for its best game of
the season against the University of
San Francisco here tomorrow at 10
o'clock.
The Cards started out the year
with the title of Maloney's best team
in years, and proceeded to live up to
all advance notices with three com
paratively easy conference victories.
They were all set for a "best"' game
against San Jose State College last
week, but the Cards' actually supe
rior team was outplayed â€” but it
wasn't due to overconfidence.
INDIANS CAUGHT OFF-GUARD
What the Indians were really ca
pable of didn't come out in that game,
but the Spartans took advantage of
all the breaks and won the game on
superior play in just about every
department. Since then Maloney
has had the Cards mulling over old
assignments, and they figure to be
better versed in every task tomor
row.
It will be the initial meeting of
the two elevens this season. They
play two games in conference play,
the next being scheduled for the
City, Dec. 6.
TITO STILL INJURED
The Indians will be minus the
services of back Bill Edwards and
Goalie Tito Sanz-Agero against
U.S.F.'s highly touted eleven, but
Cam Pierce will be back at his for
ward spot after missing the Menlo
J.C. tilt Wednesday with a bad shin.
Sanz-Agero has a bunged-up
shoulder and Edwards may see action
although a cold will keep him from
starting. Sanz-Agero should be back
in uniform in time for next Wed
nesday's battle at San Jose, Maloney
declared.
U.S.F. IS TOUGH
As an indication of the caliber of
San Francisco, they nipped San Jose
this season, 2-1. Maloney said to
morrow's contest should be one of
the season's toughest.
Starting for the Cards will be:
Rudy Munzer, goalie; Captain Bill
Hamilton and Cam Pierce, forwards;
Grayson Bryant, Wilson Clark, and
Ken Cuthbertson, halves; and Bill
Arrasmith, George Dole, Francis
Morgan, A1 Pellas, and Chris Son
tum, forwards.
