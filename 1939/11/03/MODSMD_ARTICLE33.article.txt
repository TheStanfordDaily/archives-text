### ART OLSEN 
(Sideline Slants is taken over
today by Art Olsen. sports editor
of The Santa Clara, who gives a
few pertinent comments anent to
morrow's game.)

Sports Editor, The Santa Clara
A Santa Clara team which found
itself in the St. Mary's and Purdue
games will atempt to register its
fourth consecutive win over Stan
ford tomorrow.
"Buck" Shaw's boys, harried by in
experience and a suicide schedule,
got off to the poorest start of a sea
son that Santa Clara has ever ex
perienced under the Shaw regime,
but the St. Mary's victory seemed to
mark the emergence of the Broncos
from the potential stage to the status
of a first-ryte football team.
In that game the latent running
alack worked as it lias not since
the Stanford game in 1!)!»8. and
Jimmy Johnson's passing made the
Santa Clara aerial attack as dan
gerous as any on the Pacific Coast.
Perhaps the most important thing
that occurred in the St. Mary's game
was the arrival ol' the Bronco line as
a powerful unit, and of
fensively. The previously indifferent
Bronco line outcharged the St. Mary's
line, called the best on the Coast of
fensively, and the Gaels wound up
with minus 17 yards as their ol
fensive record.
Improvement in the reserve
strength of Santa Clara is the best
news heard in months down at the
Mission school, for it was feared
last spring (and became an actu
ality in September) that that very
weakness might ruin the Bronco
season.
Getting to the first team: Jimmy
Johnson, tall, good-looking left half,
seems well on his way to All-Coast
halfback honors as a result of his
consistently fine play in every game.
He is a loping, deceptive runner, one
of the best passers on the Coast, and
the best kicker at Santa Clara since
Diamond Joe Paglia.
A sophomore lad who shone in
the Gael game was Kenny Casanega,
called by some experts the next Bay
Region All-American back as a l'rosh.
Casanega was introduced to top
flight competition slowly by "Buck"
Shaw, but in his first chance to show
anything, he looked great.
Casanega is a passer de luxe as
evidenced by the tiO-yard pass he
flipped into the waiting arms of
Harry Sanders in the Gael end
/one. Everything was perfect about
the pass except that Sanders
dropped it.
The Bronco players watched
Stanford against Oregon State and
against U.C.L.A. a fortnight later,
and they were surprised and im
pressed by the improvement of the
Cards. They know they will have
to play their best game to date to
ring up the coveted fourth straight.
The team gives Norm Standlee the
highest praise they can offer when

they call him the toughest fullback
they have seen since Johnny Kim
brough of Texas A. & M. mauled
them all over Seals Stadium a month
ago. That is equivalent to calling
Standlee a combination of a loco
motive and a threshing machine.-

a powerful unit, and of
fensively. The previously indifferent
Bronco line outcharged the St. Mary's
line, called the best on the Coast of
fensively, and the Gaels wound up
with minus 17 yards as their ol
fensive record.
Improvement in the reserve
strength of Santa Clara is the best
news heard in months down at the
Mission school, for it was feared
last spring (and became an actu
ality in September) that that very
weakness might ruin the Bronco
season.
Getting to the first team: Jimmy
Johnson, tall, good-looking left half,
seems well on his way to All-Coast
halfback honors as a result of his
consistently fine play in every game.
He is a loping, deceptive runner, one
of the best passers on the Coast, and
the best kicker at Santa Clara since
Diamond Joe Paglia.
A sophomore lad who shone in
the Gael game was Kenny Casanega,
called by some experts the next Bay
Region All-American back as a l'rosh.
Casanega was introduced to top
flight competition slowly by "Buck"
Shaw, but in his first chance to show
anything, he looked great.
Casanega is a passer de luxe as
evidenced by the tiO-yard pass he
flipped into the waiting arms of
Harry Sanders in the Gael end
/one. Everything was perfect about
the pass except that Sanders
dropped it.
The Bronco players watched
Stanford against Oregon State and
against U.C.L.A. a fortnight later,
and they were surprised and im
pressed by the improvement of the
Cards. They know they will have
to play their best game to date to
ring up the coveted fourth straight.
The team gives Norm Standlee the
highest praise they can offer when

they call him the toughest fullback
they have seen since Johnny Kim
brough of Texas A. & M. mauled
them all over Seals Stadium a month
ago. That is equivalent to calling
Standlee a combination of a loco
motive and a threshing machine.-

fourth consecutive win over Stan
