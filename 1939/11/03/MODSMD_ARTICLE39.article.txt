IT is sometimes very difficult to tell what the
B.A.C. is thinking. But, when it announced
that rooters' tickets will be validated at the
U.S.C. game, it was fairly clear what it had in
the back of its mind.
Its thought, perhaps correct, perhaps not, was
that where the lending of student body cards is
concerned, Stanford men and women are not
to be trusted.
Assuming the B.A.C.'s supposition to be un
just, its Los Angeles Coliseum check-up system
is an insult to the Associated Students and a
slap in the face to the Honor Code.
Assuming the suspicion to be justified, the
source of the trouble must be brought to the
surface and something done about it.
Perhaps the past secretive actions of the
B.A.C. and its apparent lack of interest in under
graduate opinion have made the students feel
that it is not a real part of the University—and
therefore unworthy of their respect and con
sideration. It is not easy to apply the standards
that govern the Stanford community to what one
believes to be an outside business interest.
The A.S.S.U. has three representatives on the
Board, but, to quote an Ex Committee member,
"only about one-tenth of the campus know who
they are." Students who are not members of
varsity teams rarely, if ever, express their views
to these men, nor are their opinions asked for.
Most Stanford students consider the B.A.C.
an alien force—and a large percentage of them
feel that it is an enemy.
The sources of such opinion lie in little things.
In many undergraduates the feeling of antipa
thy toward the Board of Athletic Control grows
out of the fact they are forced to pay admission
to the outstanding games on the Stanford foot
ball schedule. They resent being admitted free
to the Saturday circuses only when the demand
curve is low.
Whatever the cause, it is a certainty that little
love is lost between the student body and the
B.A.C.
And it is equally certain that a showdown
is not far off.
