AND today it begins.
Five hundred frosh will wander up the
Row, each trying to figure which of the colonial
exteriors belongs to the house whose invitation
he accepted, trying to peek behind the masks
of smiling faces and hearty handshakes to find
what the brothers really are.
On any campus with fraternities, rushing is
a necessary evil. It is hard on the rushees, but
harder on the rushers.
However, Stanford men should give thanks
that here rushing is, at least, on a civilized
plane. At most colleges the house that can
hustle the most arriving freshmen off the train
—and lock them up for a few days in a hotel
room—gets the biggest pledge class. Here at
Stanford the frosh have until lanuary to make
up their minds, and no pledge is binding until
that time.
This year Interfraternity Council has made
rushing even a little more practical. Instead of
the traditional lunches and dinners, the first
period consists of open-houses, with the fresh
men given the privilege of visiting any frater
nities they wish.
Another innovation, and an extremely logical
one, puts equal blame—and punishment—on
the frosh and the house involved in dirty rush
ing.
The machinery is in order. The fraternities
have only to use it with due regard to rushing
rules and the promises they have made to Inter
fraternity Council.
Five week-ends this quarter and next, five
week-ends of budget-straining meals and back
slapping and pep talks will make Encina men
decide on Hall or Row.
The season is open. ~
