# BULL SESSION
## HORTENSE AND THE ROUGHS 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
lIORTENSE is of! the fairway again, driving as mean
" a screwball as ever terrorized a gallery. This
time she's down on, as well as in, the rough. She,
with her customary abrasive femininity, decries the
Stanford man's being "dress unconscious." With Hol
lywood-Parisian passion in her quavering breath, and
her nostrils dilated and eyelashes flashing, she asks,
"Where are the Cal, U.C.L.A., and U.S.C. men—hand
some, well-groomed creatures whom the girls can
call their own?"
Obviously, with our cords sensationally dirty so as
to steal attention from features above the neck, we
are personally flabbergasted. But with a Figgins
softened heart and an eye to Stanford's rugged race
of too-slowly vanishing roughs, which seems to
offend the Farm woman, we wish to plead with
Hortense for an ever-so-dainty class of Stanford
glamour-boys.
Why should Stanford's men continue to dress com
fortably and frill-lessly while Cal and Trojan dandies
are attired like modern Chesterfields? Why should we
refuse to be clothes-snobs? Simplicity is simply not
the thing.

lIORTENSE, with your own inimitable astuteness
and vinegar-like sweetness you have hit my thumb
right on the head. No more jeans. No more cords.
No more moleskins. Gabardines are really too un
dressy, too. Let's have dark suits for quad wear, tuxes
for football games, and tails for jolly-ups. Nothing—
absolutely nothing could be quite so delightful. In
its own way.
And as long as we are capitulating to the preda
tory glamour girl, let's be clothes-horses inside and
out. Fine silk undies and step-ins for the Stanford
gentleman—and sheer hose with silk-ribbon garters.
Canes, of course, should bo worn on Sunday, and
marcels should grace the Stanford man's head. The
Greeks had a word for it —Adonis or Narcissus. Take
your pick, men.
But still, I feel a little inadequate to direct the
swing to male ruffles. Hortense, you are hereby nomi
nated for the position of Stanford's male-vogue au
thority. Why don't you start a little shoppe in the art
gallery, catering to masculine glamour? I can see the
neon sign flashing of a Friday night now: STANFORD
STYLES FOR STANFORD LOVELIES—By Figgins.
Farewell, dear cords! Adieu, my jeans! Ring out
the old, and swing in the new. Hortense says, "Clothes
make the man." The Indian will be demure. Ugh, ugh!
