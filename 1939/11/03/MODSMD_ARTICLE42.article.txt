SHE'S lIEIIE AGAIN!
EDITOR, SIR:
Dear Chum: After your being so kind to me I
feel that I can perhaps take the liberty of addressing
you a little more informally. The reason why I have
not written for so long is that I feared the girls would
think that I was getting a little bold. However, after
those two childishly stupid exercises in tautology,
written by you know who I mean, one about fashions,
and the other concerning gum chewing, I simply
couldn't remain quiet another instant.
Complaining about the noise we girls make when
we chew in classes, such tommy-rot. And even if it
were true, what business has he sitting beside girls,
anyway? Just probably trying to make some sort of
a pass at them, I'll bet. I know his type and Mother
told me what to beware of. And furthermore, it is
certainly a lot better occasionally to click one's gum
than to come to class with a morning-after breath like
some people I have had to sit next to. I hope that he
will just mind his business a little more, the old
debauche.

HPHE other thing was all that inane spouting that
our mutual friend(?), whom I cannot help calling
"clam-face," did about women's fashions. To read
that drivel simply made me writhe. I cannot recall
his exact words for I was so furious that I simply tore
the paper in shreds, and, while I am sorry for it now,
for I realize that it is really no fault of yours, and you
probably dislike him as much as anybody, I refused
to read The Daily for three whole days. So you see
what I think of him. It was really just like heaping
red hot coals on me, for it has always been my con
tention that with some notable and gratifying excep
tions, this group of students is really disgracefully
dress-unconscious.
VE7HERE he could lead a crusade against masculine
dowdincss, whereof this farm is rife, he diddles
away line after line about the girls' clothes, which,
heaven knows, are so far superior to those of the jazzy
jean class, that one wonders what the men of Stanford
are coming to. There are some men who know how
to dress properly and unostentatiously, like the presi
dent of Pan-Hellenic, Bob Moulton, who was pointed
out to me the other day. He is the sort a girl could
go for. My sister, Anastasia, used to come to Stan
ford when the men cared.
Please do not get me wrong, it is not a lot of glam
our boys that I am looking for like Cuthbertson, but
Moulton's type that could be a glamour boy, but
simply doesn't choose to. U.S.C. and Cal can both
have men that the girls can be proud to call their
own. why can't Stanford? Did you see those handsome
creatures that came up from U.C.L.A.? Men that
cared. Why must we, the girls, be denied this little
thing?
In all perplexity,
Hortense Figgins

THE CLUB MEN'S ANGLE
r JpHE EDITOR, SIR:
We feel, as club men, that, the editorial by
"J. 8." in The Daily of November 1 requires explana
tion, for it may have been misleading to some who
are not familiar with the organization of the eating
clubs. In particular, his statement that "the new
rules are designed to prevent the shock which eating
clubs have felt in the past upon picking up The
Daily and discovering that one or two prize members
have left for the Row" needs clarification.
It is not true that club members are merely mark
ing time until asked to pledge a fraternity. Although
the bond of a club man to his club is less formal
than that of a fraternity man to his house, there is
none the less the same spirit of loyalty and comrade
ship in both.
* * * *
we do not feel that the competi
tion between eating clubs and fraternities has
been "cut-throat," but feel rather that it has been on
the basis of a friendly rivalry. Both fraternities and
clubs have their advantages, and it is a matter of
individual choice on the part of the rushee as to which
type of organization he wishes to join.
We heartily approve of the proposals formulated at
the meeting of Interfraternity Council Monday night.
We hope that this will clear up some of the ques
tions which may have arisen in the minds of those
who read the editorial and felt, as we did, that it was
not quite fair to the eating clubs.
