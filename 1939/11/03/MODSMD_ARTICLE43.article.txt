# 'Old Maid' Proves Bette Davis Still Rates 'Oscar'
## 
### 
"THE OLD MAID," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
It would save a lot of confusion and excitement in Hollywood if the
Academy just earmarked an Oscar for Bette Davis, each year and let it
go at that.
The young lady not only turns in a finished characterization of every

role she attempts, but, and perhaps <
this is more to the point, the roles
she attempts are consistently meaty
—she demands and gets the best.
HOPKINS STARS TOO
No deviation is "The Old Maid"
in which Miss Davis plays the title
role as Charlotte to Miriam Hop
kins' Delia. Both actresses give ex
cellent performances, but the role
of Delia does not carry with it the
depth of character or acting oppor
tunities that the role of Charlotte
does.
Delia starts out as a hypocrite and
schemes her way charmingly through
the whole story, deceitful and un
derhanded at every turn. Charlotte
on the other hand is a frustrated
character of varying emotions. Un
der these circumstances every move
of Delia's can be forecast, while
Charlotte is the unknown quantity,
emotionally.
BRENT'S LOVE DISCAItDER
George Brent, as Clem Spender, is
seen only in the first half of the pic
ture as the man Delia throws over l
for the president of the local First I
National Bank. When she later finds
out that Charlotte has had a child
by Spender, she spends the rest of
her life trying to win the child away
from the unhappy mother.
In the supporting cast are such
notables as Donald Crisp as Dr.
Lanskell, Cecilia Loftus as Granny,
and Jane Bryan as Charlotte's
daughter. Each with his performance
adds to the excellence of the film
which is well worth the trip to Paly.
