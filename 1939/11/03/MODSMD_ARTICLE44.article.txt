# Gaieties Seeks Backstage Crew
## 
### 
If you can't act, can't sing, and
don't dance, but you want to work
in the Big Game Gaieties of 1939,
there's a place for you, according to
Charlie Bulotti, director. Tryouts
for the technical crew of the Gaie
ties will be conducted by Chet John
son, technical director, in the lobby
of the main theater from 2 to 4
o'clock.
No previous experience is neces
sary to work backstage oh the
crew. Anyone who can pound a
hammer or sling a paint brush will
be welcome, according to Johnson.
Backstage crews will be divided
into props, make-up, lighting, and
points earned on the Gaieties will
go toward Ram's Head membership.
