# Allies Jubilant as F.D.R.'s Neutrality Revision Passes
## Angered Germany Warns U.S. Its Action May Become Road to War 
### United Press 
President Roosevelt emerged as the victor Thursday in his long struggle
to lift the arms embargo and prevent what he called a "blackout of
peace" in the United States.
Great Britain and France, jubilant that the vast American storehouse
of arms and munitions is to be thrown open lo them, hailed it as a major

turning point in the war to
Hitlerism" which thus far has pro- j
duced nothing resembling crushing
blows.
Germany, realizing the United
States' decision to sell arms on a
cash-and-carry basis is a heavy
blow to her, angrily accused the
United States of giving "outright
support" to the Allies and warned
that the American people might pay
the price of being dragged into the
war.
ADVANTAGE—ALLIES
The lifting of the arms embargo
works all to the advantage of the
Allies because Germany, with an
acute shortage of foreign exchange,
cannot lay the cash on the line and,
even if she bought arms, would face I
an almost impossible task in moving !
them to Germany.
On the other side of the world,
beyond the European fighting fronts,
the situation in the Balkans and
Turkey became sharply more acute.
German authorities, bitter over
Turkey's shift to the side of Great
Britain and France, ordered all Ger
man nationals to be x-eady to leave
Turkey "as soon as possible" and j
many Germans already were quit- ■
ting the country.
NAZIS BEAR DOWN
Most probable explanation for j
Germany's sudden move was thai j
the Nazis arc attempting to bring ■
pressure on the Turks in an effort
to prevent them from going over
completely to Britain and France.
Germany's warning to the Balkan
states was made more ominous by
its timing —at a moment when
strong evidence was cropping out
that. Premier Benito Mussolini is
striving to set up a Balkan bloc un- j
der Italian leadership to preserve
peace in that part of Europe.
Mussolini seemed to have moved
a step nearer such a goal Thursday
when it was announced that Italy
and Greece have exchanged pledges i
of non-aggression as "a factor for
peace in the eastern Mediterranean."
If a Balkan bloc is set up, after
elimination of the many quarrels
among the Balkan states themselves,
it appears that Hungary will be left i
out.

duced nothing resembling crushing
blows.
Germany, realizing the United
States' decision to sell arms on a
cash-and-carry basis is a heavy
blow to her, angrily accused the
United States of giving "outright
support" to the Allies and warned
that the American people might pay
the price of being dragged into the
war.
ADVANTAGE—ALLIES
The lifting of the arms embargo
works all to the advantage of the
Allies because Germany, with an
acute shortage of foreign exchange,
cannot lay the cash on the line and,
even if she bought arms, would face I
an almost impossible task in moving !
them to Germany.
On the other side of the world,
beyond the European fighting fronts,
the situation in the Balkans and
Turkey became sharply more acute.
German authorities, bitter over
Turkey's shift to the side of Great
Britain and France, ordered all Ger
man nationals to be x-eady to leave
Turkey "as soon as possible" and j
many Germans already were quit- ■
ting the country.
NAZIS BEAR DOWN
Most probable explanation for j
Germany's sudden move was thai j
the Nazis arc attempting to bring ■
pressure on the Turks in an effort
to prevent them from going over
completely to Britain and France.
Germany's warning to the Balkan
states was made more ominous by
its timing —at a moment when
strong evidence was cropping out
that. Premier Benito Mussolini is
striving to set up a Balkan bloc un- j
der Italian leadership to preserve
peace in that part of Europe.
Mussolini seemed to have moved
a step nearer such a goal Thursday
when it was announced that Italy
and Greece have exchanged pledges i
of non-aggression as "a factor for
peace in the eastern Mediterranean."
If a Balkan bloc is set up, after
elimination of the many quarrels
among the Balkan states themselves,
it appears that Hungary will be left i
out.
President Roosevelt emerged as the victor Thursday in his long struggle
to lift the arms embargo and prevent what he called a "blackout of
peace" in the United States.
Great Britain and France, jubilant that the vast American storehouse
of arms and munitions is to be thrown open lo them, hailed it as a major

turning point in the war to
Hitlerism" which thus far has pro- j
duced nothing resembling crushing
blows.
