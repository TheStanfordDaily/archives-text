### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
r pUE American freighter City of .
Flint, travel-worn and headline
begrimed, is still sailing around on
her weird odyssey.
Last night, after kicking around
the Atlantic and North Sea for 26
days, she was poised for a dash
home to escape being snared in any
new incident of the war on the high
seas. Instead of leaving the Nor
wegian port of Bergen and heading
for the British Isles, at the risk of
being captured again by the German
navy and perhaps sunk, the ship
may dispose of her cargo in Norway
and return empty to the United
States.
m# # •
The lifting of the United States
arms embargo, President Roose
velt's creation of a "combat zone"
around the British Isles and Ger
many's bitter reaction to the Nor
wegian government's liberation of
the U. S. vessel all combine to
make a rather doubtful situation.
In fact circumstances may prevent
the City of Flint from proceeding
to her original ports of destination
—in England—with a cargo which
admittedly includes contraband of
war. If tractors, cereals, and oil
can be called contraband, the City
of Flint is carrying them. And,
with America's new policy, it will
be absolutely impossible for her to
steam into the port of a belligerent
nation and discharge these war
materials.
What's the City of Flint going to
do?
* * *
A BOUT the only solution seems to
bo selling the ship's cargo—at
lesat that part of it that is out-and
out contraband — at some neutral
port, probably in Norway. Thus, on
the high seas headed for home, the
ship couldn't be halted as a cai'rier
of contraband as she was on Oct. 9
by the German pocket battleship
Deutschland, which gave the Amer
icans a clear-cut choice of surren
dering or having their ship sunk.
When the City of Flint heads home
ward, running the maze of the At
lantic like one of the psych depart
ment's rats, she'll be legally, morally
okay.
The Norwegian government, whose
surprise decision to intern the Ger
man prize crew at Haugesund freed
the American freighter, last night
rejected Germany's protest which
had demanded return of the ship
and release of the interned Nazi
crew. Of course the Norwegian gov
ernment contended that it acted le
gally in defense of Norway's neutral
ity under the 1907 Hague Conven
tion. The German crew had attempt
ed a ruse, apparently by trying to
put into Haugesund on the pretext
that, a crew member was seriously
ill. The Germans were angrier than
ever at Norway's forthright rejec
tion of the Reich's protest, asserting
that Norway had created an "acute
situation" which might compel Ger- j
many to adopt "new tactics" of I
some sort.
=H * *
THE British and French press,
remembering that Norway
helped Germany to defeat the
British blockade for a long time
in the World War, were joyous at
what they called "Norway's defi
ance of Germany" and gesture of
friendship toward the United
States. The German foreign of
fice continued to blast at President
Roosevelt because of his about -
face on neutrality. They averred,
as usual, that he is playing into
the hands of the arms-makers and
profiteers "who want profits from
• the blood and prosperity of other
nations."
And, from the western front, a
French garison was isolated by
German fire in the center of a
salient extending deep into the Ger
man lines and threatening the se
curity of industrial Saarbruecken.
