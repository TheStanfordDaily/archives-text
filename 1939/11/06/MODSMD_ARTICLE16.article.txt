# Picketing of Daily Exposed As Work of Local Agitators
## 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Fears that publication of The Daily would be impaired through labor
troubles and sabotage activities were quelled forever late yesterday when
it was learned from an unimpeachable source that an extremely sun
burned picket line that marched outside the paper's sanctorum last Thurs
day afternoon was hired, squired, and fired by two local school-boys,

► Bud McDufYie and Larry O'Brien.
Identification of the two labor agi
tators and students, who incidentally
are not connected with any outside
union groups, preferring to work
with their own sinister methods, was
made almost definite last night by
Editor Larry Livingston, innocent
I victim of the dastardly and embar
rassing plot.
NOT IN BAWLOUT
Livingston, backed by experts in
the field of criminal libel, earlier in
the week had refused to run a letter
; in his paper's Campus Opinion col
umns because the purported writer
of the damaging article was not re
corded in the University's official
directory.
Livingston, remembering the fate
of less alert publicists, apparently
| had no intention of getting mixed up
j either legally or extra-legally with
j the persons accused in the irate
I missile.
j The dusky pickets carried placards
and sandwich-boards harassing The
Daily for refusing to print "the let
ter of Bill Grimes," but Livingston
calmly sat in his office and watched
the then unidentified culprits, who
were directing the Ethiopian brigade
from a nearby running board.
PI PIH'S CONFESS
Most convincing evidence against
' McDufTie and O'Brien was that
brought to the editor early yester
[ day by two attractive, yet visibly
confused, daughters of the sister
hood of Pi Beta Phi.
i The sorority, it was disclosed, re
cently "threw" a dinner to which
; they invited some dozens of young
j men, something in the ratio of the
j normal Stanford three-to-one. The
J affair was no more nor less than an
'' attempt to pay back en masse past
I favors from a group of the more
j j eligible of the Farm's bachelors.
McDuffie and O'Brien, through
similar past favors, drew bids to the
celebration and anticipated the usual
after-dinner date with certain of
the sorority's cast. The three-to-one
rush left them with nothing to do
but to write letters to their local
newspaper in an attempt at belated
revenge.
Livingston still refuses to publish
the spurious letter and only last
night said, "The Pi Phis and Grimes
and McDuffie and O'Brien may be
nice people, but what do I care if
the Pi Phis like their dates four or
five at a time. I'm running a news-
paper, not a date bureau. The Daily
has and always will print letters of
such campus agitators whenever
those agitators are willing to divulge
their true identity. Grimes is a no-
body."
CHAPARRAL INVOLVED
The dusky picketers, obviously
working for wages instead of prin-
ciples, looked long and often at their
short-term bosses. One of them in-
sisted he was a cousin of Kenny
Washington but would issue no
other official statement, although he
freely pointed out his employer to
the then dubious newspapermen as
sembled.
Others dragged into the stinging
scandal were John Elliott, Chap-
arral staff member, who is said to
have drawn the decorative posters,
and Herb Ivey, Alpha Delt, who also
sat on the running board.
Elliott and McDuffie live together
at 830 Escondido Road, the address
proffered on the now debunked
Grimes missile of sarcasm and rid-
icule.

body."
CHAPARRAL INVOLVED
The dusky picketers, obviously
working for wages instead of prin-
ciples, looked long and often at their
short-term bosses. One of them in-
sisted he was a cousin of Kenny
Washington but would issue no
other official statement, although he
freely pointed out his employer to
the then dubious newspapermen as
sembled.
Others dragged into the stinging
scandal were John Elliott, Chap-
arral staff member, who is said to
have drawn the decorative posters,
and Herb Ivey, Alpha Delt, who also
sat on the running board.
Elliott and McDuffie live together
at 830 Escondido Road, the address
proffered on the now debunked
Grimes missile of sarcasm and rid-
icule.
Fears that publication of The Daily would be impaired through labor
troubles and sabotage activities were quelled forever late yesterday when
it was learned from an unimpeachable source that an extremely sun
burned picket line that marched outside the paper's sanctorum last Thurs
day afternoon was hired, squired, and fired by two local school-boys,

► Bud McDufYie and Larry O'Brien.
Identification of the two labor agi
tators and students, who incidentally
are not connected with any outside
union groups, preferring to work
with their own sinister methods, was
made almost definite last night by
Editor Larry Livingston, innocent
I victim of the dastardly and embar
rassing plot.
NOT IN BAWLOUT
Livingston, backed by experts in
the field of criminal libel, earlier in
the week had refused to run a letter
; in his paper's Campus Opinion col
umns because the purported writer
of the damaging article was not re
corded in the University's official
directory.
Livingston, remembering the fate
of less alert publicists, apparently
| had no intention of getting mixed up
j either legally or extra-legally with
j the persons accused in the irate
I missile.
j The dusky pickets carried placards
and sandwich-boards harassing The
Daily for refusing to print "the let
ter of Bill Grimes," but Livingston
calmly sat in his office and watched
the then unidentified culprits, who
were directing the Ethiopian brigade
from a nearby running board.
PI PIH'S CONFESS
Most convincing evidence against
' McDufTie and O'Brien was that
brought to the editor early yester
[ day by two attractive, yet visibly
confused, daughters of the sister
hood of Pi Beta Phi.
i The sorority, it was disclosed, re
cently "threw" a dinner to which
; they invited some dozens of young
j men, something in the ratio of the
j normal Stanford three-to-one. The
J affair was no more nor less than an
'' attempt to pay back en masse past
I favors from a group of the more
j j eligible of the Farm's bachelors.
McDuffie and O'Brien, through
similar past favors, drew bids to the
celebration and anticipated the usual
after-dinner date with certain of
the sorority's cast. The three-to-one
rush left them with nothing to do
but to write letters to their local
newspaper in an attempt at belated
revenge.
Livingston still refuses to publish
the spurious letter and only last
night said, "The Pi Phis and Grimes
and McDuffie and O'Brien may be
nice people, but what do I care if
the Pi Phis like their dates four or
five at a time. I'm running a news-
paper, not a date bureau. The Daily
has and always will print letters of
such campus agitators whenever
those agitators are willing to divulge
their true identity. Grimes is a no-
body."
