# Picketing of Daily Exposed As Work of Local Agitators
## 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Fears that publication of The Daily would be impaired through labor
troubles and sabotage activities were quelled forever late yesterday when
it was learned from an unimpeachable source that an extremely sun
burned picket line that marched outside the paper's sanctorum last Thurs
day afternoon was hired, squired, and fired by two local school-boys,

► Bud McDufYie and Larry O'Brien.
Identification of the two labor agi
tators and students, who incidentally
are not connected with any outside
union groups, preferring to work
with their own sinister methods, was
made almost definite last night by
Editor Larry Livingston, innocent
I victim of the dastardly and embar
rassing plot.
NOT IN BAWLOUT
Livingston, backed by experts in
the field of criminal libel, earlier in
the week had refused to run a letter
; in his paper's Campus Opinion col
umns because the purported writer
of the damaging article was not re
corded in the University's official
directory.
Livingston, remembering the fate
of less alert publicists, apparently
| had no intention of getting mixed up
j either legally or extra-legally with
j the persons accused in the irate
I missile.
j The dusky pickets carried placards
and sandwich-boards harassing The
Daily for refusing to print "the let
ter of Bill Grimes," but Livingston
calmly sat in his office and watched
the then unidentified culprits, who
were directing the Ethiopian brigade
from a nearby running board.
PI PIH'S CONFESS
Most convincing evidence against
' McDufTie and O'Brien was that
brought to the editor early yester
[ day by two attractive, yet visibly
confused, daughters of the sister
hood of Pi Beta Phi.
i The sorority, it was disclosed, re
cently "threw" a dinner to which
; they invited some dozens of young
j men, something in the ratio of the
j normal Stanford three-to-one. The
J affair was no more nor less than an
'' attempt to pay back en masse past
I favors from a group of the more
j j eligible of the Farm's bachelors.
