# Carroll Drama Will Be Given This Week-end
## Shadow, Substance Based on Struggle Of Modern Ireland 
### 
Paul Vincent Carroll, author of
"Shadow and Substance," to be giv
en on Friday and Saturday nights
in Memorial Hall, based his play on
the "currents and cross-currents of
the mental struggles going on in the
hidden Ireland."
The Ganon, played by Richard
Glyer, is an aristocratic and learned
interpreter of Catholicism. The
schoolmaster is an atheist who hates
the slovenly Irish system of educa
tion, and he writes a bitter con
demnation of the system.
EQUALLY HATED
Both men are equally hated by
the ignorant Irish peasants of the
community, and they have respect
only for Brigid, played by Milhe
Green, who is the Canon's servant.
It is Brigid, with her blind, tran
scendent faith in God, who sym
bolizes Ireland, and the two men,
one a Catholic dogmatist, and the
other, a over-modern Atheist, com
bine to crush her.
RUNS ENTIRE SEASON
Carroll's play ran for the whole
of the '36-'37 season on Broadway,
and his "White Steer" was a last
season's hit. George Jean Nathan
was particularly loud in his praise
of the two plays and it was he who
was responsible for the American
production of "Shadow and Sub
stance."
Carroll was an unknown teacher
in a Glasgow slum school when his
first play was discovered. Of himself
he says, "I'm as Irish as a terrier
and with as sharp a bite. And in
case you think I'm a heretic and an
infidel, I'm a good Catholic."
Tickets are 50 cents and may be
reserved by telephoning the Secre
tary of the Division of Speech and
Drama at P.A. 9411, Local 951.
