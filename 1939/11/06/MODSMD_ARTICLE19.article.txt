# Authorities Say Prices Will Rise

WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 (UP). â€” |
Government forecasters tonight told i
the nation's farmers that they may I
expect higher prices for their prod- i
ucts next year, but warned private
industry that its activities will fluc
tuate sharply because of uncertain
ties arising from the European war.
Basing its forecast on the assump
tion that the war will last at least
another year, the Bureau of Agri
cultural economics said that 1940
demands for farm products will be
much larger this year. It added that
there is bound to be a readjustment
period causing prices to decline con
siderably from the peak of the cur
rent upswing.
Industrial fluctuations will arise
not only from uncertainties, the
bureau reported, but also from ad
justments following the inventory
accumulation that began shorlly
after the outbreak of the war. The
buying wave then occasioned, the
bureau said, had caused production
to "run ahead of actual consumption
and exports."
