# Two Million May Vote On Pension
## Odds 4 to 1 Against Ham and Eggs; L.A. To Support Measure 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5 (UP).—
Ham and Eggs, the once-beaten pen
sion plan which would give 30 one
dollar warrants every Thursday to
retired citizens over 50, tonight was
expected to attract one of the
largest votes in California's history
at a special election Tuesday.
Betting houses quoted odds of 4
to 1 that "$3O-Every-Thursday"
would be defeated at the polls, but
opponents of the measure said these
odds were "far out of line" and
warned against "over-confidence."
With fair, mild weather predicted
for election day, it was estimated
that approximately 80 per cent of
the state's 3,606,907 registered voters
would go to the polls, or approxi-

mately 2,885,000. California's record
turnout was a, 93 per cent vote in
the 1936 presidential election.
Observers anticipated the greatest
support of Ham and Eggs would
come from Southern California, es
pecially the heavily-populated Los
Angeles area, where most of the
"vote yes" campaign money was
spent. Proponents expected a pre
dominantly "no" vote in Northern
California.
In warning against "over-confi
dence," opponents pointed out that
when the proposition was first voted
on in 1938, Ham and Eggs polled
1,143,670 votes, while 1,398,999 voted
against it. This margin, opponents
said, was "too close for comfort."
CAMPAIGN IS BITTER
The campaign has been a spirited,
and sometimes bitter one.
Promoters of Ham and Eggs, cam
paigning chiefly among the state's
"senior citizens" who could receive
the warrants, have asserted the turn
over of warrants would increase
production and consumption, elimi
nate unemployment, assure a com
fortable income for old people and
usher in an era of prosperity.
Opponents of Ham and Eggs, led
by businessmen, merchants, bank
ers, and industry, charge that within
a month the measure would bank
rupt California and result in finan
cial and social chaos from which the
state would not recover for two I
years.
HAS LABOR O.K.
Ham and Eggs has an official en
dorsement from labor's non-partisan
league because pension advocates in
1938 helped an anti-labor initiative.
Several labor unions and the Cali
fornia State Communist Party have
endorsed the plan, which is officially
sponsored by the California Life
J Retirement Payments Association.
President Roosevelt, former Presi
dent Herbert Hoover, U. S. Senator
Hiram Johnson, Dr. Francis Town
send, Gov. Culbert. Olson arc among
the public figures who have spoken
against the pension plan.
Opponents of Ham and Eggs point
ed out that only six counties regis
tered slim majority votes tor the
plan in 1938. They said an expected
negative vote in northern counties
would more than offset lhe admit
tedly close contest in Los Angeles
County.

when the proposition was first voted
on in 1938, Ham and Eggs polled
1,143,670 votes, while 1,398,999 voted
against it. This margin, opponents
said, was "too close for comfort."
CAMPAIGN IS BITTER
The campaign has been a spirited,
and sometimes bitter one.
Promoters of Ham and Eggs, cam
paigning chiefly among the state's
"senior citizens" who could receive
the warrants, have asserted the turn
over of warrants would increase
production and consumption, elimi
nate unemployment, assure a com
fortable income for old people and
usher in an era of prosperity.
Opponents of Ham and Eggs, led
by businessmen, merchants, bank
ers, and industry, charge that within
a month the measure would bank
rupt California and result in finan
cial and social chaos from which the
state would not recover for two I
years.
HAS LABOR O.K.
Ham and Eggs has an official en
dorsement from labor's non-partisan
league because pension advocates in
1938 helped an anti-labor initiative.
Several labor unions and the Cali
fornia State Communist Party have
endorsed the plan, which is officially
sponsored by the California Life
J Retirement Payments Association.
President Roosevelt, former Presi
dent Herbert Hoover, U. S. Senator
Hiram Johnson, Dr. Francis Town
send, Gov. Culbert. Olson arc among
the public figures who have spoken
against the pension plan.
Opponents of Ham and Eggs point
ed out that only six counties regis
tered slim majority votes tor the
plan in 1938. They said an expected
negative vote in northern counties
would more than offset lhe admit
tedly close contest in Los Angeles
County.
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5 (UP).—
Ham and Eggs, the once-beaten pen
sion plan which would give 30 one
dollar warrants every Thursday to
retired citizens over 50, tonight was
expected to attract one of the
largest votes in California's history
at a special election Tuesday.
Betting houses quoted odds of 4
to 1 that "$3O-Every-Thursday"
would be defeated at the polls, but
opponents of the measure said these
odds were "far out of line" and
warned against "over-confidence."
With fair, mild weather predicted
for election day, it was estimated
that approximately 80 per cent of
the state's 3,606,907 registered voters
would go to the polls, or approxi-

mately 2,885,000. California's record
turnout was a, 93 per cent vote in
the 1936 presidential election.
Observers anticipated the greatest
support of Ham and Eggs would
come from Southern California, es
pecially the heavily-populated Los
Angeles area, where most of the
"vote yes" campaign money was
spent. Proponents expected a pre
dominantly "no" vote in Northern
California.
In warning against "over-confi
dence," opponents pointed out that
when the proposition was first voted
on in 1938, Ham and Eggs polled
1,143,670 votes, while 1,398,999 voted
