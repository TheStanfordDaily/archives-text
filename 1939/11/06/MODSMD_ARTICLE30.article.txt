# Farm Psychologists To Repeat Interest Tests for Juniors
## 
### 
Do a college man's basic attitudes (
and interests shift during his first !
two years in the University?
This is the question lhat Stanford's
Department of Psychology will at
tempt to answer this week when
the men and women of '41 file into
Room 100, take out pens and pencils,
and answer the carefully worded
exam lhat the Farm's psychologists
have prepared.
During their first quarter at Stan- |
ford, members of the class of '41 |
replied to these same questions, i
Those results were classified; now j
the Farm's psychologists are inter- j
ested in determining attitude-inter- i
est changes after the juniors' two- '
year exposure to college life.
Since the first testing two years
ago approximately 30 per cent of the
men and 40 per cent of the women j
who entered with the class of '41 |
have left the University. Those who |
remain will become, for a half hour j
this week, human guinea-pigs for i
the important research problem.
All men who entered in autumn, ;
1937, are requested to come to Room ;
100 between 7 and 9:30 o'clock on
either Tuesday evening, Nov. 7, or i
Thursday evening, Nov. 9.
Similarly, all women who were j
members of the original junior j
class, entering Stanford in 1937, are I

asked to come to Room 100 on either j
tonight, Nov. (i, or Wednesday, Nov. J
8, between 7 and 9:30 p.m.
