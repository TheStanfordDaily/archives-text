### 
WINSLOW, Ariz., Nov. 5 (UP).— |
Seven-year-old Bruce Crozier wig- j
gled his toes in the luxury of his
own bed tonight and grinned as they j
asked him about the six days he ;
spent wandering aimlessly in the j
mountainous Mogollon Rim coun- j
try.
Bruce, who precipitated one of the |
lai'gest man-hunts in Northern Ari
zona history when he strolled away
from his parents' camp exactly a
week ago, brought the search to a I
close himself last night when he j
stumbled into a deer hunter's camp
in Wildcat Canyon.
The camp where Bruce turned up |
was 32 miles airline from the spot
where he disappeared last Sunday. |
All along his zigzag course he had 1
left his bootprints, easily distin- !
guished by the design of a star on 1
the heel.
