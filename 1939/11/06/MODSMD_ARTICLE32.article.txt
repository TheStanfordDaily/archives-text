Nation of Nations." Mr. Adamic, j
with the help of two of this coun- |
try's educational foundations, has
issued more than 100.000 question

lation of immigrants and Americans.
From the returns of these question
naires Mr. Adamic will draw mate
rial for his lecture.
The title for Mr. Adamic's lecture
and book were chosen from a line
of Walt Whitman: "Here (in Amer
ica) is not a nation, but a teeming
nation of nations."
Mr. Adamic is a native of Slo
venia in what is now Yugoslavia.
He came to the United States in 1913
and since that time he estimates that
he has traveled some 100.000 miles.
Within the next year Mr. Adamic
expects to travel that much again to
gather further material for his com
ing book.
