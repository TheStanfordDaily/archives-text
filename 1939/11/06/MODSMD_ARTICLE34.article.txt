# Albert's Passing Attack Only Stanford High Spot As Broncos Do It Again
## Santa Clara Runs Up 27 Points As 'Poor Cardinal' Scores Once; 40,000 Spectators Witness Game 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
A spectacular left-handed aerial onslaught in the second half provided
most of the thrills for a crowd of 40,00(1 that turned out to watch Tiny
ThornhiH's downtrodden Indians take a 27-7 licking from Santa Clara
in the Stadium Saturday.
Fran kie Albert, the hard-luck kid from GI end ale, entered the game in
A U . 4 t_. .11 . * 1 â€¢ r*

the third quarter to sling live spec-<
tacular passes that netted a touch- ,
down and gained 172 yards before a I
lreak interception smashed the!
Cardinal hopes for victory.
Entering the game after the Broncs j
had carved out two scores in a i
.slow first half, Albert started the fire- I
works with a pass to Groves from i
the Card end zone that was good for
29 yards. On the next play he muffed |
the pass from center, recovered and j
pitched to Stan GrafT, who streaked j
to a first down on the Bronco 31.
INDIANS BOG DOWN
The Indian attack bogged down j
there, but a few minutes later, with !
the ball on the Card 21, Frankie 1
faded back to throw again. Run- !
ning to the right, he paused on his
own 7 and fired a. long spiral to i
Hugh Gallarneau, who took it on the j
Santa Clara 43 and eluded two
Broncos in a race for the goal.
After the next kickoff Jim Ver- i
dieck intercepted a pass and Albert I
completed two more passes that i
brought the Cards to Santa Clara's I
28-yard line. Fading to his left for |
another toss, he was rushed by a I
horde of Santa Clara linemen. Bill j
Anahu, Bronco end, deflected the |
ball as it left Albert's hand, and \
Braun caught the ball in the air and j
went 55 yards to the score that iced !
the game.
ALBERT LEAVES BLOCKERS
In the dressing room after the |
game, Thornhill said that Albert ran j
away from the protection of his
blockers on the play.
The Indians didn't get any place
on the ground. Norm Standlee was
effectively stopped by the Bronco
lorward wall. It was the first time
this ye;ir that "The Chief" didn't j
compile a good ground gaining av- I
erage.
There were just too many blue
shirts on the for Standlee.
Santa Clarans repeatedly broke [
through to nail the big Indian full- j
back behind the line.
VERDIECK STARS
Jim Verdieck at center was more i
impressive than Buck Shaw's highly j
touted Johnny Scheiehl, although ;
the latter played a steady game.
Verdieck was in on almost every j
tackle, and intercepted two Santa |
Clara passes, almost getting away '
for a touchdown with one in the !
fourth quarter.
The score was the highest that !
has been run up against a Stanford j
varsity since the Vowing Sophs were !
walloped by Alabama in the Rose
Bowl in 1935.
DONAHUE CARRIED OFF
Corky Donahue, big first team |
right tackle who was carried from !
the Held in the second quarter, will j
not play against U.S.C. Donahue re- I
ceived a knee injury similar to the
one that put Bill Willard on the !
sidelines, but may be able to play in j
the Big Game.
Bill Trout, who took Donahue's j
place, was the only other Indian i
hurt. The big 240-pounder lost \
three teeth in a pile-up.
