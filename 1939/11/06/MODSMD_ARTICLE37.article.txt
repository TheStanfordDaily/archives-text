I and Stanford, opponents in Los An-

| opposite ends of the Pacific Coast
| Conference standings as the result
1 of last week-end's games.
Stanford, in being snuffed out 27-7
j by Santa Clara, didn't lose any groun
by Santa Clara, didn't lose any
ground in the conference standings,
but on the other hand the Indians
didn't have any ground to lose—they
already were sole occupants of the
I cellar position.
TROJANS WIN l!»-7
; The Trojans battered their way
another notch closer to the Rose
I Bowl by swamping a previously un
' beaten, untied Oregon State eleven,
i 19-7. thereby moving into a tie for
, the loop lead with U.C.L.A.
The Bruins let Jackie Robinson
i languish on the bench nursing an
j injured ankle last Saturday, but
j another brilliant colored player,
' Kenny Washington, carried on in
| such fashion that Robinson wasn't
1 even missed as the Westwooders
' walloped California, 20-7.
All Washington did to the Bears
! was to throw two touchdown pastes,
and run 35 yards to personally chalk
iup the other marker. If any team
j has a chance to stop the Trojans'
headlong dash toward the Rose
Bowl, U.C.L.A. is that utfit.
W.S.C. LOSES 38-0
Oregon, with the best forward
i wall in the conference next to U.S.C.,
' massacred a hapless Washington
i State squad, 38-0. Bob Smith, hard
running halfback, alone picked up
better than a third of Oregon's 275
j yards gained from scrimmage.
I Washington, picking up steam after
J a poor early-season record, defeated
i a touch Montana outfit, 9-0. Berg,
! an umph-string quarterback, kicked
I a second-quarter field goal, while a
I shovel pass from Jones to Younglove
i netted 14 yards and a fourth-quarter
I touchdown for the Huskies.
