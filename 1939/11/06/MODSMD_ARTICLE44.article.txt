# Card Soccer Team Loses, 1-0, to U.S.F.
## Indians Play Uclan Booters in L.A. Saturday Morning 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team has
decided that one or more of its
members just don't live right.
Scoring early in the first quarter,
the University of San Francisco club
staved off numerous Card thrusts at
the goal to upset Coach Harry Ma
loney's eleven, 1-0, Saturday morn
ing.
With no less than 10 shots at the
goal, the Indians had the best chance
to score, but the Dons who only had
three shots all morning made one of
them good to take the nod.
KICKS BOUNCE OUT
George Dole kicked three which
bounced off the top of the goal or
off the side posts—the closet any of
the Indians came to scoring. Other
attempts were picked up by the
Don goalie who kicked out of
danger.
Stanford's chances of taking the
conference championship were dim
med considerably by the defeat.
However, both San Jose State and
U.S.F., conquerors' of Stanford by
one-point margins, must meet Ma
loney's club once again.
Both U.S.F. and San Jose State
have split their pair of games and
along with Cal are riding atop the
league. Cal meets the Cards the
week-ends of the W.S.C. and Cali
fornia games.
SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT
His team only slightly improved
over previous performances, Ma
loney will probably continue to shift
his men around in an effort to strike
a happy medium with a combina
tion which will score some points.
The forwards appeared none too
strong, although they showed to bet
ter advantage in beating their op
ponents to the ball. The backs stop
ped lots of U.S.F. boots and were by
far the scrappiest. Cam Pierce, Bill
Hamilton, and Ken Cuthbertson were
particularly effective.
