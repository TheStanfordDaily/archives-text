TOMORROW the state of California will de
cide:
Whether it wants to amend its constitution
to provide for the weekly issuing of warrants
as payments under an old age pension plan,
probably in violation of the legal tender clause
of the federal Constitution.
Whether it wants to burden its citizens with
a three per cent gross income tax, canceling
neither the Retail Sales Tax nor Use Tax, but
to be used to finance the plan in case the courts
declare the warrants worthless.
Whether it wants to take the chance that
merchants may not accept the warrants, that
they may fall in value, and that a period of wild
speculation may ensue.
Whether it will pass this measure in spite
of the fact that it will have no leveling effect
on income groups, but probably will provide
the wealthy with an opportunity to pay their
taxes in depreciated paper, which the state
will be forced to accept.
Whether it wants to ignore the complete
failure of a similar experiment, the "Prosperity
Certificates" plan, in Alberta, Canada, in 1936.
Whether it wants to ruin California's inter
state commerce by issuing warrants which will
be valueless in other states.
Whether it wants to place complete control
of the financial system of the state in the hands
of a single administrator, vested with dictatorial
and incontestible powers.
Whether it wants to pass an amendment
which directly contravenes the system of
checks and balances, the basis of American
constitutional government.
Tomorrow the registered voters in Stanford
University must decide:
Whether the danger that these evils may be
realized is worth a trip to Palo Alto to vote.
