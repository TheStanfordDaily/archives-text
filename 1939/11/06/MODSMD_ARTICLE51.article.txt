# It's Knocking Now

ALTHOUGH Stanford students often have
been accused of indifference, anyone who
has sat in the rooting section on Saturday or
has mixed with the crowd leaving a play in
Memorial Hall will realize that they have a
decided penchant for criticism.
When the students do not like the way the
football team is playing, there is very little
they can do about it except to yell louder. But,
when they do not approve of the plays that
are being presented in their theater, they can
take steps more effective than Bronx cheers.
They can—if the coach is willing to listen to
them.
Today the head of the Division of Speech and
Drama is doing more than opening his ears to
the student body. He actually is soliciting its
opinion.
In order to determine what plays the cam
pus wants to see, the Division has spent the
past week accepting suggestions, checking
them, and eliminating those that offer too great
technical difficulties or are too expensive to
stage. Today it is submitting the 10 most ap
propriate plays to a student vote.
Since they chip in an extra dollar every guar
ter and turn over the Union profits to pay for
Memorial Hall, it is only just that the students
should have a part in selecting their entertain
ment.
However, there is only one way in which
they can obtain dividends from their $600,000
investment. And that is by filling out the ballots
printed in today's Daily, and dropping them at
English Corner.
If all those people who were bored by "Mur
der in the Cathedral," who were insulted by
"The Governor's Wife," and who were irritated
by "The Shoemaker's Holiday" will vote —
something is bound to happen.
