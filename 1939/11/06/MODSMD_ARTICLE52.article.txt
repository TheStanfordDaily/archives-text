IN a nation-wide war poll recently conducted
by the U.C.L.A. Daily Bruin among college
students, the fact that 97.1 per cent of the total
number of persons questioned did not think this
country, under present conditions, should enter
the war in Europe as an active fighting agent
may be misleading.
It is obvious that no one in this country wants
to go over to Europe to fight, not of his own
volition. That is really all this question meas
ures. But it is framed in such a way that it can
be looked at objectively; it can be considered
without any emotional connotations influencing
an answer. From it an obvious, humane deci
sion can be given.
But when the poll moves down to the other
four questions, you can see emotion coming in
and affecting the answers. You find that at
least one-third of America's college students are
afraid:
(1) That no matter who wins the war, the

spread of the totalitarian form of government
will not be prevented.
(2) That France and Great Britain may be
defeated by Germany.
(3) That any way you look at it this country
does not have extensive enough armaments and
armed forces at the present time. Not nearly
enough.
The point is that when you ask a student
simply whether he wants to go to war or not,
he answers that he does not. But when you
gualify your question in any way, when you
bring in any of the ideologies which he has
been conditioned against, his answer begins to
change.
And this would seem to be as typical of the
nation at large as of college students alone. An
Associated Press newspaper man who was on
the campus last Thursday spoke of the same
thing.
He asked a great many people at a recent
state fair whether they favored this country's
getting into the war.
To a man they answered that they did not —
but that they thought we would.—D. J.
