### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THE ACTIVITIES TRAP
EDUCATION must have been rather dull in the
good old days, when reading, writing, and 'rithme
tic circumscribed the youthful scholar's horizon. I
don't see how they could have been "dear old golden
rule days" when the most romantic device was a
"slate," and English literature was considered a frivo
lous and unnecessary deviation from fundamentals.
Along with "The Internationale" and "She'll Be Ridin'
Six White Horses When She Comes," "School Days"
must be a highly deceiving bit of musical propaganda.
But since those drab days when rally committees
were as unheard-of as clipper ships, education has
become permeated with a heterogeneous mass of
social-lures known technically as "activities." From
pre-reg barbecue to the Senior Ball every nbrmal stu
dent not suspected of having secretly enraged the Dies
Commttiee is expected to become an activities-man
or an activities-woman. If the person does not fall
into one of the above classifications he is immediately
analyzed as not normal, complex-ridden, and prob
ably a chronic hater of mankind.

T EST the very typewriter I am pounding with two
fingers be called hypocritical, beholden as it is to
the activity known as The Stanford Daily, let me
hasten to pay reserved homage to extra-curricular
education. Hardly anyone denies that many activities
are valuable as diversion and as social responsibility
training.
But the extreme emphasis that is put on becoming
an "activities man" really satirizes the whole noble ef- v
fort. Many a hapless chap becomes so inextricably
enmeshed in committees that he loses his individuality.
He no longer thinks in terms of his own attitudes.
Sometimes he doesn't think at all. His habits of mind
are so camouflaged with good-will that his identity
melts into the environment. His anxious endeavors to
"become influential" and to "fit in" have succeeded in
completely destroying his influence, and he has lit in
so well that he can't talk unless he is pretty sure the
statement won't be a solo, but a chorus.
This deadening aspect of the activities trap is sel
dom admitted by a full-fledged activities-man. It
isn't considered the iolly thing to do. It might be very
constructive for Ex Committee to appoint a Committee
to Satirize Committees. We've got a Committee on
Committees to see that Stanford's activities don't con
flict with one another. The Satire Committee could see
that activities don't conflict with thinking. But we
will need some efficient men for that. It will be quite
a job.

completely destroying his influence, and he has lit in
so well that he can't talk unless he is pretty sure the
statement won't be a solo, but a chorus.
This deadening aspect of the activities trap is sel
dom admitted by a full-fledged activities-man. It
isn't considered the iolly thing to do. It might be very
constructive for Ex Committee to appoint a Committee
to Satirize Committees. We've got a Committee on
Committees to see that Stanford's activities don't con
flict with one another. The Satire Committee could see
that activities don't conflict with thinking. But we
will need some efficient men for that. It will be quite
a job.
THE ACTIVITIES TRAP
EDUCATION must have been rather dull in the
good old days, when reading, writing, and 'rithme
tic circumscribed the youthful scholar's horizon. I
don't see how they could have been "dear old golden
rule days" when the most romantic device was a
"slate," and English literature was considered a frivo
lous and unnecessary deviation from fundamentals.
Along with "The Internationale" and "She'll Be Ridin'
Six White Horses When She Comes," "School Days"
must be a highly deceiving bit of musical propaganda.
But since those drab days when rally committees
were as unheard-of as clipper ships, education has
become permeated with a heterogeneous mass of
social-lures known technically as "activities." From
pre-reg barbecue to the Senior Ball every nbrmal stu
dent not suspected of having secretly enraged the Dies
Commttiee is expected to become an activities-man
or an activities-woman. If the person does not fall
into one of the above classifications he is immediately
analyzed as not normal, complex-ridden, and prob
ably a chronic hater of mankind.

T EST the very typewriter I am pounding with two
fingers be called hypocritical, beholden as it is to
the activity known as The Stanford Daily, let me
hasten to pay reserved homage to extra-curricular
education. Hardly anyone denies that many activities
are valuable as diversion and as social responsibility
training.
But the extreme emphasis that is put on becoming
an "activities man" really satirizes the whole noble ef- v
fort. Many a hapless chap becomes so inextricably
enmeshed in committees that he loses his individuality.
He no longer thinks in terms of his own attitudes.
Sometimes he doesn't think at all. His habits of mind
are so camouflaged with good-will that his identity
melts into the environment. His anxious endeavors to
"become influential" and to "fit in" have succeeded in
completely destroying his influence, and he has lit in
so well that he can't talk unless he is pretty sure the
statement won't be a solo, but a chorus.
