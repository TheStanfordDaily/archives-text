## ECSTACY IN THE EATING CLUBS 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
Your editorial, "Impure Competition," in Wednes
day's paper came as a pronounced but. pleasant sur
prise to some of us eating club men. It was a distinct
relief to us to learn that our brothers on the row had,
all unbeknownst to us, suggested that "fraternities
notify an eating club before rushing any men belong
ing to that club" and that "not until 30 days after this
notification can a fraternity pledge a former club
man."
Indeed, even the most sympathetic fraternity man,
bound as he is to his brothers by unbreakable ties,
cannot fully realize how relieved we are to know that
Member Murgatroyd who sat next to us at lunch today
will be sitting there for 30 more days.

JN FACT, lest, the Interfraternity Council think us
unappreciative of their kindness, a few of us,
appreciative of their kindness, in an unofficial
capacity, of course, hasten to assure them of
our co-operation. In the future, we for our part will
be glad to give the fraternities notice of our intention
to rush their members and shall be glad to let any
amount of time lapse before pledging them.
In addition we shall be pleased to compile an
"Open Season List" of our men who, because of their
second-hand cars or their ability to eat with a fork,
might be acceptable to the fraternities as paying
members.
So great, in fact, is our enthusiasm for this type
of mutual assistance pact that we should be glad to
make it all embracing by entering into similar pacts
with any or all sororities or the Firehouse.
Very truly yours,
Some Club Men
