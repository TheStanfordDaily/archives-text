# VALIDATION INVALID

r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
Quoting Mr. Cuthbertson as staled in Thurs
day's issue in regard to ticket validation at the U.S.C.
game:
"A strict validation of tickets will bo made," add.s
Cuthbertson, "and any misuse of tickets and student
body cards will be treated as a violation of the Honor
Code ..."
Might I say, that I hardly see how ihc posting of
"reliable student checkers ... at all points open to
Stanford entrance . . ." will be any less of a viola
tion of the Honor Code than the loaning of the tickets
in the first pliice. The code is a two-way contract.
