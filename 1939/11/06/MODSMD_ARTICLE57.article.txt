# Kids Brighten Old Plot In 'Babes in Arms' Movie
## 
### 
"Babes in Anns" now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
Laughter and high comedy pre
vailed last night night at the Stan
ford Theater when the Farm, and
possibly a few brave members of
the Paly citizenry, saw M.G.M.'s pro
duction of the Broadway hit "Babes
in Arms."
A few carping characters will, no
doubt, complain that the original
"Babes in Arms" had a pretty good
plot all by itself, but M.G.M. saw
fit to substitute Stock Situation 22-b
(good for all back-stage pictures—
puts no strain on the scenarist) and
the result was the old story of the
beautiful blonde angel who puts her
money into the show, with the stipu
lation that she play the lead, and of
the honest understudy who steps
into the breach at the last moment.
HELP OLD FOLKS
However, there was this differ
ence: Mickey Rooney was the har
ried producer: Judy Garland was the
forsaken understudy; and an ex-
Shirley Temple on the come-back
trail was the blonde menace.
The plot concerned a group of chil
dren—sons and daughters of old
time vaudeville stars —who decide to
put on a show to help out the old
folks. Incidentally, they are all in
danger of being put in a work-house
because the welfare agency, per
sonified by Margaret Hamilton,
thinks they are not getting proper
care.
On this tattered plot hang some
songs, dances, and comedy lines
which are excellent. The young
sters really put their hearts into
those routines and the results were
fresh and satisfying. A good time
seemed to be being had by all con
cerned.
KISSES GIRLS
Mickey Rooney had a field day.
He got a chance to tug at the heart
strings in pathetic scenes with his
father, Charles Winninger; he kissed
two pretty girls; he imitated Clark
Gable, Lionel Barrymore, President
Roosevelt, and Eddie Cantor (in
black-face); he danced and sang;

and made his peculiar brand of faces
through every scene. The show was
written for him, and he didn't miss
a trick.
Four old songs, two of them from
the stage play, turned up in the pic
ture, and all were received with
nostalgic cries of glee from the
audience. First of these was "Babes
in Arms," sung by Douglas Mac-
Phail and the rest of the 'teen-age
cast.
NEW SONGS PALE
"Where or When" was sung twice
by MacPhail and Betty Jaynes,
prodigy from the Chicago Civic Op
era, and the two billed and cooed in
proper adolescent movie fashion.
"I'm Just Wild About Harry" ai d "I
Cried for You" were bot.'i put over
in a rousing style that made the
show's new songs seem rather pale
in comparison.
The finale, unfortunately, was a
Busby Berkeley special, replete with
the whole fagade of the national
Capitol, drum majorettes, and peo
ple singing about "God's Country."
At that point Judy Garland and
Rooney might just as well have been
Kate Smith. As the bus-driver com
mented afterward:
"Dere's been too much of dat kind
of t'ing."—Nowell

in Arms," sung by Douglas Mac-
Phail and the rest of the 'teen-age
cast.
NEW SONGS PALE
"Where or When" was sung twice
by MacPhail and Betty Jaynes,
prodigy from the Chicago Civic Op
era, and the two billed and cooed in
proper adolescent movie fashion.
"I'm Just Wild About Harry" ai d "I
Cried for You" were bot.'i put over
in a rousing style that made the
show's new songs seem rather pale
in comparison.
The finale, unfortunately, was a
Busby Berkeley special, replete with
the whole fagade of the national
Capitol, drum majorettes, and peo
ple singing about "God's Country."
At that point Judy Garland and
Rooney might just as well have been
Kate Smith. As the bus-driver com
mented afterward:
"Dere's been too much of dat kind
of t'ing."—Nowell
"Babes in Anns" now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
Laughter and high comedy pre
vailed last night night at the Stan
ford Theater when the Farm, and
possibly a few brave members of
the Paly citizenry, saw M.G.M.'s pro
duction of the Broadway hit "Babes
in Arms."
A few carping characters will, no
doubt, complain that the original
"Babes in Arms" had a pretty good
plot all by itself, but M.G.M. saw
fit to substitute Stock Situation 22-b
(good for all back-stage pictures—
puts no strain on the scenarist) and
the result was the old story of the
beautiful blonde angel who puts her
money into the show, with the stipu
lation that she play the lead, and of
the honest understudy who steps
into the breach at the last moment.
HELP OLD FOLKS
However, there was this differ
ence: Mickey Rooney was the har
ried producer: Judy Garland was the
forsaken understudy; and an ex-
Shirley Temple on the come-back
trail was the blonde menace.
The plot concerned a group of chil
dren—sons and daughters of old
time vaudeville stars —who decide to
put on a show to help out the old
folks. Incidentally, they are all in
danger of being put in a work-house
because the welfare agency, per
sonified by Margaret Hamilton,
thinks they are not getting proper
care.
On this tattered plot hang some
songs, dances, and comedy lines
which are excellent. The young
sters really put their hearts into
those routines and the results were
fresh and satisfying. A good time
seemed to be being had by all con
cerned.
KISSES GIRLS
Mickey Rooney had a field day.
He got a chance to tug at the heart
strings in pathetic scenes with his
father, Charles Winninger; he kissed
two pretty girls; he imitated Clark
Gable, Lionel Barrymore, President
Roosevelt, and Eddie Cantor (in
black-face); he danced and sang;

and made his peculiar brand of faces
through every scene. The show was
written for him, and he didn't miss
a trick.
Four old songs, two of them from
the stage play, turned up in the pic
ture, and all were received with
nostalgic cries of glee from the
audience. First of these was "Babes
in Arms," sung by Douglas Mac-
Phail and the rest of the 'teen-age
cast.
