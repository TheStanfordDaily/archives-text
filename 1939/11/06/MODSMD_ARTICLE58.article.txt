J Six long-term convicts escaped from
i Southern Michigan prison during a

I killed an inspector of guards in a
futile flight.
j Three of the convicts, sliding down
! a rope on the front wall of the ad
ministration building, seized an au
j tomobile and drove three miles
! northward in a running gun battle
| before being captured. Two others
; who tied down the lope were caught
I in the parking lot and one who re
i mained on the roof was captured
' later.
