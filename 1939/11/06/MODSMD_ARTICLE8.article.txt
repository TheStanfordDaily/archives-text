# Row Continues Rushing Season
## Wednesday Lunches Start Second Period 
### 
Still doubtful as to whether or
not they have fully recovered from
their first week-end's experience as
fraternity rushees, new lower divi
sion men today and tomorrow are
receiving rushing cards for the sec
ond rush period of the season, to be
in the form of lunches and dinners
on Wednesday and Thursday.
First rush period of the fall
quarter was an open house period
Firday and Saturday nights, at
which times rushees had their first
opportunity to meet fraternity men,
formally, and to be escorted through
what seemed an endless chain of
corridors and rooms as they traveled
from house to house along the Row.
LUNCHES, DINNERS
Following the initial get-together,
selection of rushees will be nar
rowed by fraternities to proportions
suitable to dining rom facilities for
this week's rush affairs.
Lunches will be held Wednesday
and Thursday from 11:30 to 2
o'clock, and dinners on these days
will last from 6 to 8 o'clock. Pur
pose of the affairs scheduled for
this week is to narrow selection of
rushees and to afford closer con
tact, according to Interfraternity
Council officers.
RUSHEES ESCORTED
Officers state that rushees wish
ing to decline invitations to any of
these or following affairs custo
marily write "sorry" on the rushing
cards, sign their names, and return
them. Upon x-eceipt of cards, rush
ees are requested to return them
promptly, and to keep all engage
ments.
Saturday found many fraternity
men escorting rushees to the Santa
Clara game in the Stanford stadium,
but rushing will not be permitted
during the S.C. game week-end this
Friday, Saturday and Sunday. This
is due to the fact that no off-campus
rushing is permitted, except during
vacations, by the rushing regula
tions.
Last Friday and Saturday nights
rushees were busy with the tradi
tional hand-shaking, house tours,
and other conventionalities. In
formal "bull sessions," singing, re
freshments and other get-acquainted
activities prevailed during the first
rush period.
