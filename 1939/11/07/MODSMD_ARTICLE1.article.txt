### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r pODAY the voters of the sover
eign state of California will go
to the polls to register their opinion
on one of the most absurd questions
that has ever faced a populace.
Personally, I'm staying with the
odds—that it will bo defeated. I al
ways try to play the percentages.
However, a friend of mine who's an
Econ major came out of a lecture
tho other morning with a light-bulb
idea. He explained to me carefully
how I could make a lot of money if
the Ham and Eggs proposition passes
today.
As soon as the warrants are issued,
he said, borrow a lot of them at their
face value of $1 apiece. Before they
begin to depreciate 'in value, trade
them in for a comparable amount of
money. Then sit tight and wait for
the inevitable drop that will follow.
When the warrants are worth about
half their face value on the open
market, buy back the number that
you borrowe'd originally. Repay
your debt. Pocket the difference in
actual cash.
I refuse to entertain any objections
to the scheme, however, even though
the loopholes are as numerous and
obvious as the errors in my last
midquarter.
r to a more serious
view, though, it's apparent
that proponent* of the Retirement
Life Payments Act are proposing
their measure as a panacea to an
economic system that functions,
they say, very badly. The amend
ment they propose creates a new
agency of government, independ
ent of our present state system
and endowed with dangerously
extensive powers.
The Administrator, through his
control of the new Credit Clearings
Bank, would completely manage,
without any supervision from the
State Banking Department, the
monetary and banking system of
California. According to Section 37
of the proposed issue, "No injunction
or writ of mandate or other legal or
equitable process shall ever issue to
interfere with the administration of
this article or to prevent or enjoin
any provision of this article from
going into effect." If this means
anything, it indicates that the Ad
ministrator is to be the sole judge
of the fairness and legality of his
own acts.
$ $ >:«
/YF COURSE, federal constitu
tionality of the warrant issue is
questionable, too. If the warrant
provision is declared unconstitu
tional, other sections of the plan
will be destroyed, too. The amend
ment fixes the Retail Sales Tax Act
of 1933 definitely in the Constitu
tion. This is a serious error, but it's
accentuated by the omission of any
mention of the amendments exempt
ing food products that have been
added since 1933.
The question of interstate trade
and commerce will be a tough one
to handle, if the act passes. War
rants can be a means of payment
only in the State of California.
Hence, out-of-state products must
be purchased in legal money. As a
result of rising prices, costs, and
warrant, incomes in the state, au
thorities think the money value of
imports may increase; the money
exports will probably decrease.
The Credit Clearings Bank will
be established to facilitate ex
change, hut it will spend its law
ful money and out-of-state bal
ances so rapidly that equilibrium
will be impossible of attainment.
The only solution will be devalua
tion of warrants in terms of law
ful money until a balance is finally
reached between California and
the other states.
So, when the voters of California
place that little black ink X in the
square today, let them put it in the
proper square. At least let them
think of the Red Thursdays to come
if they place it in the wrong square.

However, a friend of mine who's an
Econ major came out of a lecture
tho other morning with a light-bulb
idea. He explained to me carefully
how I could make a lot of money if
the Ham and Eggs proposition passes
today.
As soon as the warrants are issued,
he said, borrow a lot of them at their
face value of $1 apiece. Before they
begin to depreciate 'in value, trade
them in for a comparable amount of
money. Then sit tight and wait for
the inevitable drop that will follow.
When the warrants are worth about
half their face value on the open
market, buy back the number that
you borrowe'd originally. Repay
your debt. Pocket the difference in
actual cash.
I refuse to entertain any objections
to the scheme, however, even though
the loopholes are as numerous and
obvious as the errors in my last
midquarter.
r to a more serious
view, though, it's apparent
that proponent* of the Retirement
Life Payments Act are proposing
their measure as a panacea to an
economic system that functions,
they say, very badly. The amend
ment they propose creates a new
agency of government, independ
ent of our present state system
and endowed with dangerously
extensive powers.
The Administrator, through his
control of the new Credit Clearings
Bank, would completely manage,
without any supervision from the
State Banking Department, the
monetary and banking system of
California. According to Section 37
of the proposed issue, "No injunction
or writ of mandate or other legal or
equitable process shall ever issue to
interfere with the administration of
this article or to prevent or enjoin
any provision of this article from
going into effect." If this means
anything, it indicates that the Ad
ministrator is to be the sole judge
of the fairness and legality of his
own acts.
