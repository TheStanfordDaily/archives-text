# Five Women Take Farm Air Course
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Adding still greater confusion to
, the question of where woman's place
I is these days, five Stanford women
are attending the University's air
training school.
Until now the class has been
studying theory of flight, waiting
anxiously for final details 1o be
cleared up so they can begin their
actual air training in planes.
It was announced last night that
actual air instruction will begin on
schedule Monday morning. Con
tracts from the federal government
are en route from Washington, D.C.,
according to the Palo Alto Airport.
These five—Carlotta Haines, Mar
tha Nordling, Lyn Croft, Helen
Ford, and Pat Hall—arc all the
women allowed in the class, since
the Civil Aeronautics Authority pro
vides that only 10 per cent of Stan
ford's Class of 50 can be women.
TESTS GIVEN
Professor David L. Webster, who
conducts the course from 7 to 8
o'clock in the evening, gave the
quarter's second examination last
night.
Results of ihe first test, released
last week, showed class average to
be 88 per cent —unusually high in
Stanford examinations. Of the 640
men and women in northern Cali
fornia who are taking the .student
aviation course, the Stanford class
is furthest ahead in ground instruc
tion, according to one of the in
structors.
Another conclusion reached from
results of the first test is that stu
dents can be successful in the avia
tion course without previous train
ing in geometry, algebra, or physics.
! SOPII TOO SHORT
Many of Ihe 50 are economics and
| social science majors, and the in
| structors say that these are capable
of mastering technical details of
flight theory.
Government physical qualifications
; for the flying lessons claimed a num
' ber of the applicants. One of the
j five women now taking the ground
! training—Pat Hall, sophomore from
Kalamazoo—was caught by the stiff
i requirements. She was found to be
| one inch too short.
