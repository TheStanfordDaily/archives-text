### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 7 (UP).â€”
Voters here today go to the polls
for a special state election as well
as the election of mayor and regular
city officials. A lively battle is ex
pod cd in the election for mayor in
which Mayor Rossi bids for a third
four-year term.
Among Rossi's opponents is Frank
R. Havenner, Democratic Fourth
District congressional representative
and former San Francisco county
supervisor. The other mayoralty
candidates include James B. Mc-
Sheey, Adloph E. Schmidt and
Adolph Uhl, all members of the
Board of Supervisors in San Fran
cisco's combined city and county
government.
Supporters of Rossi appealed to
the 343,405 registered voters with the
claim that he has maintained a con
servative policy and has held down
the tax rate. Since 1911 the San
Francisco voters have never refused
their chief executive's request for a
third term.
