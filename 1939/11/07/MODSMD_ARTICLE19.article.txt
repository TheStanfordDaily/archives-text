# Ham-Eggs Bandwagon To Sound Off Today; Will We Hear It Pass?
## Fair Weather, Record Turnout Predicted Today 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nuv. 6 (UP).
—Ham and Eggs, popular name of
the California Retirement Life Pay
ments Plan, comes before 3,006,000
California voters tomorrow (Tues
day) for a decision.
The plan calls for retirement of
all persons over 50 under a pension
plan which would give them the
equivalent of $30 in stamp-supported
state warrants every Thursday for
life.
It. was estimated there were 1,-
300,000 persons over 50 eligible to
participate in such pensions.
The issue was expected to produce
the largest vote ever cast in a Cali
fornia special election. Secretary of
State Frank Jordan estimated 80 per
cent of those qualified would vote.
FAIR WEATHER FORECAST
Fair and mild weather was fore
cast for most of the state. The con
ditions brought cheer to the busi
ness, industrial, governmental and
professional interests fighting the
plan sponsored by the California
Life Retirement Payments Associa
tion.
Betting odds rose to 5 to 1 Ham
and Eggs would be beaten tomorrow.
Observers believed it would fall by
between 300,000 and 400,000 votes.
It lost by 250,000 last year.
The forces lighting Ham and Eggs
knew nothing short of a hurricane
or a flood would keep zealous sen
ior citizens, certain they were vot
ing themselves lives of ease and
plenty, from the polls. Tbey had
feared, however, rain or cold
weather would keep away those per
sons likely to vote against the meas
ure but not enthusiastic enough to
discomfort, themselves to ballot.
COUNTY OUTLAWS NO. 1
It remained for one of the state's
smallest counties to fire the last gun
of the campaign against Ham and
Eggs. The Board of Supervisors of
Siskiyou County, Northern Califor
nia County with 14,677 voters, an
nounced they would move county
funds across the state line to an
Oregon bank if the plan was adopted
tomorrow.
"We will not turn over one penny
of public money to that gang from
Los Angeles," said W. T. Davidson,
chairman of the supervisors.
Both sides made final pleas in the
campaigns of "education" they had
conducted.
ALLEN ISROS. BLOW HORN
Ham and Eg«s leaders, including
the Allen brothers, Willis and Law
rence, and the two men who will be
eligible to be administrators if thr
act goes through, Will Kindig and
Roy Owens, urged a "yes" vote as
paving the way for unparalleled
prosperity.
Opponents, including Governor
Olson, President Roosevelt, former
President Hoover, Upton Sinclair,
and Dr. Francis E. Townsend, called
for a "no" vote on the grounds the
plan w;J.s a short-cut to Utopia, cer
tain to failure, and certain to bank
rupt not only the? state and political
subdivisions but the citizens as well.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nuv. 6 (UP).
—Ham and Eggs, popular name of
the California Retirement Life Pay
ments Plan, comes before 3,006,000
California voters tomorrow (Tues
day) for a decision.
The plan calls for retirement of
all persons over 50 under a pension
plan which would give them the
equivalent of $30 in stamp-supported
state warrants every Thursday for
life.
It. was estimated there were 1,-
300,000 persons over 50 eligible to
participate in such pensions.
The issue was expected to produce
the largest vote ever cast in a Cali
fornia special election. Secretary of
State Frank Jordan estimated 80 per
cent of those qualified would vote.
FAIR WEATHER FORECAST
Fair and mild weather was fore
cast for most of the state. The con
ditions brought cheer to the busi
ness, industrial, governmental and
professional interests fighting the
plan sponsored by the California
Life Retirement Payments Associa
tion.
Betting odds rose to 5 to 1 Ham
and Eggs would be beaten tomorrow.
Observers believed it would fall by
between 300,000 and 400,000 votes.
It lost by 250,000 last year.
The forces lighting Ham and Eggs
knew nothing short of a hurricane
or a flood would keep zealous sen
ior citizens, certain they were vot
ing themselves lives of ease and
plenty, from the polls. Tbey had
feared, however, rain or cold
weather would keep away those per
sons likely to vote against the meas
ure but not enthusiastic enough to
discomfort, themselves to ballot.
COUNTY OUTLAWS NO. 1
It remained for one of the state's
smallest counties to fire the last gun
of the campaign against Ham and
Eggs. The Board of Supervisors of
Siskiyou County, Northern Califor
nia County with 14,677 voters, an
nounced they would move county
funds across the state line to an
Oregon bank if the plan was adopted
tomorrow.
"We will not turn over one penny
of public money to that gang from
Los Angeles," said W. T. Davidson,
chairman of the supervisors.
Both sides made final pleas in the
campaigns of "education" they had
conducted.
