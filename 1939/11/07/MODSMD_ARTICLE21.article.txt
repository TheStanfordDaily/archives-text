When the present Ram's Head
came into being, it x-evived the cus

considered; however, varying sizes

Several years ago it was the an
nual habit of a campus drama group
named Ram's Head, now reorgan
ized, to award two plaques—one to
a man, one to a woman—for con
tributing most to the Big Game
Gaieties.
When the present Ram's Head
came into being, it x-evived the cus
tom, altering it so that the plaque
should go to the living groups mak
ing most valuable contributions to
the production of the show. The
Ram's Head plaque was not to be
lound. However, after diligent
search it turned up in possession of
a certain Mr. Gene Krupa, who
obligingly returned it to the cam
pus.
AWARD PLANNED AGAIN
This year for the second running
since the plaque's repossession,
Ram's. Head, producers of the Big
Game Gaieties, is conducting a Gaie
ties contest. Two living groups, a
men's and a women's, contributing
most to making this Big Game
Gaieties "'the biggest show on earth"
will be awarded their measure of
praise and appreciation by having
their names engraved on the two
plaques.
Stage work, set construction, writ
ing skits and songs, publicity, mu
sical arranging (Myron Birnbaum is
still looking' for someone to help
him do musical copying), script
copying, make-up, lighting, or par
ticipation in skits or musical num
bers or any activity which in the
estimation of the judges will con
tribute to the Gaieties will be good
for points for the living groups rep
resented. Charles Bulotti, the Gaie
ties production staff, and Dana
Winters, Ram's Head president, will
act as judges.
WORKERS STILL NEEDED
Although the cast and songs
have already been selected, anyone
interested in working can still get
in touch with Director Charles Bu
lotti with a good chance of being
used on the crew or in the cast.
Here's how the Gaieties contest
works:
Members of any campus living
group will be cordially received, but
ihey must declare who they are
working for.
They will be given the once-over
from time to time by Director Bu
lotti and his production staff. Num
bers of the contestants will be
considered; however, varying sizes
ot residence groups will be allowed
lor. All salaried Ram's Head big
