# Rushees Await Second Period
## Row Offers Lunch, Dinner Engagements 
### 
With the maximum number of en
gagements set at four for this week's
fraternity rushing period, freshmen
and soph transfers,are this week in
the midst of their annual dilemma,
the question of which houses to
choose in narrowing their selection
to the limited four.
This week's period will be in the
form of rush affairs at fraternity
houses with lunches and dinners on
Wednesday and Thursday. Rushing
cards were being received by rush
ees yesterday, and will be in the
mails again today.
A statement on rush cards by the
Interfraternity Board of Control ad
vises that rushees are not to accept
more than two engagements with the
same fraternity during this week's
rush period. Luncheon - engage
ments Wednesday and Thursday will
last from 11:30 to 2 o'clock, and din
ner engagements will take place
from G to 8 o'clock.
Freshmen and soph transfers are
also reminded that they must keep
out of fraternity houses except dur
ing regular rush periods, in accord
ance with rule two of the rushing
regulations. Also, rushees are ad
vised that no pledge is binding until
pledge day.
The next official rushing period
date following this week's activities,
as released by the Interfraternity
Board of Control, will be Friday and
Saturday, Nov. 17 and 18, in the
form of a regular week-end rush
period. This will be the last on
campus period until January, al
though informal rushing will be
permitted off - campus during
Thanksgiving and Christmas vaca
tions.

The University of Illinois is con
structing new campus buildings at
a cost of $3,400,000."
