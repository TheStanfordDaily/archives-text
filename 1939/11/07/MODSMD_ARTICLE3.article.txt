rior's Husband."
Over 400 students, voting yester
day in the Division of Speech and
Drama's poll to determine what
plays the Farm would like to see
presented in Memorial Hall, tallied
IG3 votes for the Julian Thomson
farce.
Second, with 125 votes, was Noel
Coward's "Private Lives," and "Yes,
My Darling Daughter" by Mark Reed
ranked third with 120.
CHOICE GOOD
Expressing himself as "highly
gratified" by the students' choice,
Hubert Helfner, head of the Division
of Speech and Drama, said last night,
"I think this send-off will help to
establish the kind of drama depart
ment Stanford deserves — that is, a
great department for a great Uni
versity."
According to HefTner, scripts will
be ordered immediately, and try
outs will start as soon as these
scripts are available. The play will
be presented as the Division's first
production for winter quarter.
"It's a hilarious play, and I prom
ise you a rip-roaring production,"
he added.
PLAYS LISTED
Voters were asked to indicate
three choices on the ballot, but not
all of them did so, and the total vote
for all the plays tallied 942, though
414 ballots were cast. Polls, located
on the English Corner, were in
charge of Dana Winters, president of
