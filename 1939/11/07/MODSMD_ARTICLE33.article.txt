ROSE BOWL OPPONENT
WORRIES SOUTHLAND
Fully confident, that one of the
two Los Angeles football teams —
Southern California or U.C.L.A. —
will represent the Pacific Coast Con
ference in the annual Rose Bowl
game, southern scribes are already
casting about looking for a possible
opponent for either the Trojans or
Bruins come Jan. 1, 1940.
Tennessee is generally consid
ered the finest piece of football
machinery in the country, but
Southern California is getting a
little tired of watching Dixie teams
perform in the Tournament of
Roses game.
"Tennessee is too tough for the
Rose Bowl." asserts Grantland
Rice, famous grid authority, in
ferring that either the Bruins or
the Trojans would rather look
about for someone they had a bet
ter chance of beating.
Perhaps the best suggestion comes
from a writer who suggests that
Cornell be invited just to hear the
eastern team's rooters sing the most
beautiful of college songs, "High
Above Cayuga's Waters."

ROSE BOWL OPPONENT
WORRIES SOUTHLAND
Fully confident, that one of the
two Los Angeles football teams —
Southern California or U.C.L.A. —
will represent the Pacific Coast Con
ference in the annual Rose Bowl
game, southern scribes are already
casting about looking for a possible
opponent for either the Trojans or
Bruins come Jan. 1, 1940.
Tennessee is generally consid
ered the finest piece of football
machinery in the country, but
Southern California is getting a
little tired of watching Dixie teams
perform in the Tournament of
Roses game.
"Tennessee is too tough for the
Rose Bowl." asserts Grantland
Rice, famous grid authority, in
ferring that either the Bruins or
the Trojans would rather look
about for someone they had a bet
ter chance of beating.
Perhaps the best suggestion comes
from a writer who suggests that
Cornell be invited just to hear the
eastern team's rooters sing the most
beautiful of college songs, "High
Above Cayuga's Waters."
