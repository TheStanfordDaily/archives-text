# Indians Will Play Crazy Football as Team Stands With Back Against Wall
## Thornhill to Employ 'Everything In Book' as Cards Prepare for Last Stand with Strong Trojan Eleven 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
The last time El Trojan really knocked our Indians around was back
in 1931.
Unfortunately for Stanford's gridders. who have had three years of ups
and a couple of downs since that time, the prospect of a worse defeat
looms Saturday, But. quoth Tiny Thornhill, if the Cards are to be the

lamb led to the Trojan slaughter this,
week-end, his team is going to go
down to defeat leaving an impres
sion in Los Angeles with the Trojans
and fans of what crazy football can
be.
Everything points to at least a
three-touchdown victory for Howard
Jones. No one has any idea though
what the? Indians are going to do in
the way of scoringâ€”if they do any at
all. But what Tiny promises in the
way of crazy football may produce a
surprise score or two.
With Norm Standlee in the hospi
tal with a cold, Corky Donahue defi
nitely out for this week's game and
possibly the entire season with a
battered knee, and Fred Meyer fa
voring a reinjured ankle, the In
dians lined up at no time last night
in the order they probably will take
the field Saturday.
KMETOVIC USABLE
Frankie Albert, who everybody
hopes will perform satisfactorily
Saturday, was at left half, and Gene
Coldiron occupied quarter. Tiny did
run little Pete Kmetovic in at right
half but had Jim Groves and Hugh
Gallarneau in there most of the
time. Bobby Templeton and John
Casey spelled each other in Stand
lee's absence.
With Kmetovic as a possible
threat at catching passes, running
the ball on reverses, and taking a
turn at. throwing, the Indians may
have their dafTiest team yet to take
the lieid. After last Saturday's
great clean-up by Stanford through
the air lanes, it wouldn't take a
great deal of luck to push the three
ply Trojans back on their haunches.
