# Frosh Gridders Polish Defense
## Shipkey Anticipates Season's Best Line-up 
### 
Facing a schedule of heavy de
j tensive scrimmage against California
plays plus several afternoons of pol
| ishing up on their own offense,
! Stanford's freshmen swing into
, their last and most important week
j of practice.
Coach Harry Shipkey learned
plenty about Cal's freshmen in their
14-12 win over Long Beach Junior
! College last Saturday. Forced to play
! their first string for quite some time
! and come from behind to win, the
! Bears kept few of their secrets of
! offense from (he discerning eyes of
; Shipkey.
News that Bob Greening will
1 probably not be ready for action
against California hit Shipkey last
Friday. Milt Vucinich bruised his
J knee late last week but was back
, in the pink yesterday.
This means that, for the first time
; since Hank Norberg was hurt five
| minutes after the beginning of the
, first game of the season, the irosh
i will be fielding what Shipkey thinks
| their best team.
During the 1938-39 school year,
| 200 colleges created some 300 schol
arships fo: foreign refugees.
