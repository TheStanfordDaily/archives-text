TWO-THIRDS of the way up Palm Drive, Stan
ford did not look very different. It was not
until you reached the end of the road that you
saw that the lawn in front of the Quad was
brown and withered, covered with weeds.
The silent sandstone cloisters were deserted,
and the rows of dirt-covered windows looked
like the eyes of blind old men. The hours
passed, but the bell in the old clock tower made
no sound.
Covered with wooden scaffolding, the half
completed tower of the Hoover Library stood
like a sentinel in armor, staring at the empty
buildings.
Yes, Stanford had closed its doors.
With bitter regret the students had left their
halls and houses for the last time, had assem
bled in the Inner Quad to hear the President
speak and to sing the Hymn. Then they had
returned to their homes.
Now most of them were looking for work,
trying t<3 help support their families. But jobs
were scarce, and salaries were low. A great
many students had transferred to the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley and to U.C.L.A.,
where they sometimes met by chance in small
groups and talked about the old days on the
Farm.
However, they were not to get a chance to
complete their education. The state appropria
tion for the support of its universities was paid
in warrants, and after eight months of struggling
and deferring salaries, they too were forced to
close.
As a horde of bankrupt farmers advanced on
California to spend their old age in ease, they
met another army pushing in the opposite di
rection. Middle-income families were packing
into their Buicks and La §alles and heading for
other states.
Thousands of young men and women, feel
ing the hopelessness of home, were traveling
to the Atlantic Coast.
Butter in California was selling for $1.50 per
pound, in warrants, the public schols were
closing one by one, and state hospitals, prisons,
and institutions for the insane were faced with
the prospect of not being able to feed their in
mates.
But every man and woman over 50 years of
age was receiving $30 every week for life.
