# We Want to Be Amused
## 
### 
THIS country, and especially the State of
California, is suffering from a plethora of
elections. In all of his spare moments, at all
of his amusements, the citizen is urged by sky
writing, billboards, radio blurbs to vote, and
vote, and vote.
Commendable indeed it is then that Stanford's
student body, already pressed on all sides to
exercise this sovereign privilege, -voted 414-
strong yesterday when the Division of Speech
and Drama put future theater production up
to the masses.
A turnout as large as that is democratically
indicative of what the Stanford community
wants to see on the stage of Memorial Hall.
And, better yet, the size of the vote almost as
sures success to the winning production.
If everyone who voted attends and brings a
date, there's your first-night audience. If the
first-nighters like the play, which is almost
bound to be the result, they will tell the rest
of their friends—and there's your second-night
audience. The production might even be held
over by popular demand—an almost unprece
dented move in local theater.
But perhaps this is too conjectural.
Certain it is from the poll that the Farm likes
to be amused, has a fairly good idea of what
will amuse it. Of the ten plays, five were come
dies; of the first five in voting were four of
those comedies.

Notably down on the list were problem dra
mas, tragedies, and hits-of-the-moment of a few
seasons back. Stanford students want their
theater smart and modem, light and humorous,
perhaps a little raucous. The order will not be
easy for the drama department to fill—but it
will not be impossible either.
It is reasonable to assume that the first five
plays in the voting would all be successful on
the Stanford stage, furnishing material for at
least one season. Surely the department itself
is up to staging any one of them.
Putting this matter of entertainment up to
the public without simply charging admission
seems like a step in the direction of a popular,
prosperous theater. Broadway, of course, can
not do it —but Stanford has done it, and the
results so far are all that could be desired.—J. B.

is up to staging any one of them.
Putting this matter of entertainment up to
the public without simply charging admission
seems like a step in the direction of a popular,
prosperous theater. Broadway, of course, can
not do it —but Stanford has done it, and the
results so far are all that could be desired.—J. B.
THIS country, and especially the State of
California, is suffering from a plethora of
elections. In all of his spare moments, at all
of his amusements, the citizen is urged by sky
writing, billboards, radio blurbs to vote, and
vote, and vote.
Commendable indeed it is then that Stanford's
student body, already pressed on all sides to
exercise this sovereign privilege, -voted 414-
strong yesterday when the Division of Speech
and Drama put future theater production up
to the masses.
A turnout as large as that is democratically
indicative of what the Stanford community
wants to see on the stage of Memorial Hall.
And, better yet, the size of the vote almost as
sures success to the winning production.
If everyone who voted attends and brings a
date, there's your first-night audience. If the
first-nighters like the play, which is almost
bound to be the result, they will tell the rest
of their friends—and there's your second-night
audience. The production might even be held
over by popular demand—an almost unprece
dented move in local theater.
But perhaps this is too conjectural.
Certain it is from the poll that the Farm likes
to be amused, has a fairly good idea of what
will amuse it. Of the ten plays, five were come
dies; of the first five in voting were four of
those comedies.

Notably down on the list were problem dra
mas, tragedies, and hits-of-the-moment of a few
seasons back. Stanford students want their
theater smart and modem, light and humorous,
perhaps a little raucous. The order will not be
easy for the drama department to fill—but it
will not be impossible either.
It is reasonable to assume that the first five
plays in the voting would all be successful on
the Stanford stage, furnishing material for at
least one season. Surely the department itself
is up to staging any one of them.
