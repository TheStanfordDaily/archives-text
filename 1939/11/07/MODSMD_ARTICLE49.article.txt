IN THE VERNACULAR
r pHE CASUAL OUTSIDER may falsely imagine that
walking across the Quad is a feat requiring very
little skill. Blissfully ignorant of the verbal perils
involved in saying ' hello," the uninitiated person may
reason that most people learn to walk at the age of
one year, that Stanford students are well over 17 and
that 16 years of practice should be enough to master
the art of strolling. Such surface analysts are wrong.
The ordinarily simple procedure of walking is made
complex by a complicated system of greeting. One is
apt to be accosted, for instance, with, "What's new,
boy?" This immediately places a burden upon one.
One is faced with the following alternatives: (1) enu
merating what one knows, an obviously prohibitive
task; (2) selecting some one outstanding fact with
which one may be acquainted, a job demanding light
ning judgment; or (3) coming through with some
snappy retort in the local vernacular like, "Not much,
kid. Keepin' ya' busy?" Number three is the logical
choice. But thereby hangs the tale.
"Keepin' ya' busy?" inevitably involves the party
of the first part in a crisis similar to that in which he
has placed the party of the second part. The result
is usually a self-perpetuating chain of quickies that
approaches but never reaches a clean-cut ending.
The termination is usually a sheepish smile of defeat
from one of the conversation-victims. By this time, of
course, both greetee and greeter are mentally squirm
ing. The more artful greeter, in fact, may have started
to walk very fast at the opening gun. In such cases
distance and deliberately - restrains hearing ability
may be factors in bringing the forced whimsy to a
relieving conclusion.

COURSE, the man who has been somewhat hard
ened by bitter experience may have mastered an
exceptionally long list of expressions. He may, for ex
ample, be prepared to conjure up any of the following
on a moment's notice—"Been workin' hard?" "How
ya' doin', fella?" "What a ya' say, chum?" "How's
things?" "Hows your love life?" "Don't do anything I
wouldn't do." Or "Don't study too hard." The latter
little fragment of cheery advice is particularly objec
tionable to the man who is already not studying hard
on his own initiative, or to the man who has an ex
the following morning.
The neuroses-breeding complexities of twentieth
century life are being attacked vigorously by modem
psychologists. The local problem of specialized greet
ings, it seems to me, demands the immediate atten
tion of the psych department. Otherwise functional
deafness and mutism will flourish as it never did on
the noisiest sector of the Western Front.
Well, anyhow, don't take any wooden nickels!
