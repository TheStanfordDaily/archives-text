## MERCY KILLINGS: PRO 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
We should like to counteract the flood of vindic
tive pouring upon Mr. Mellinkoffs not-too-defenseless
head by applauding his recent Bull Session advocat
ing the "mercy-killing" of hopeless mental defec
tives . . .
We cannot agree that there is any purpose whatever
connected with the existence of an idiot. There are
surely enough poor, crippled, helpless individuals on
earth who comprehend their condition, who may con
ceivably add to our present store of knowledge, to
fully "test our Christian qualities." Surely we have
enough excuses for exercising charity without lavish
ing it on those who cannot be helped by it—who can
not even realize it or desire it . . .
Perhaps we would not begrudge "a few thousand
dollars" to "buy these poor humans happiness" (al
though they are incapable of such feeling); but at
Sonoma State Home alone, 133 hopeless defectives
are maintained at a yearly cost of $290 apiece. And in
the past six months $1,600,000 has been spent at Sonoma
for housing these and other less helpless—but still
hopeless—defectives. Multiply this by other institu
tions in the state and country—by the amounts spent
on these people in prisons and poor-farms—and you
reach a staggering total. How'much better to spend
these wasted millions on education for our normal
population who are capable of using it to the ultimate
benefit of humanity.
