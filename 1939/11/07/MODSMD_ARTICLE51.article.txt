# THE 						EDITOR. SIR:

. . . P. C. says that sane murderers must not be
saved: they must be judged by a higher tribunal
than any earthly court, for there is no earthly cure
for their affliction. If we are not to judge in the case
of an idiot, if only higher tribunals are to judge, why
does an earthly court, have the right to judge errants
who CAN be and should be cured? Is 1 his "Thou
shalt not kill" commandment just a flexible support
for any prejudice or notion one wishes to support? . . .
I hope that some day there will come a point in
the evolution of intellect at which the understanding
of truth will be based upon independent thinking free
from the yoke and influence of hit-or-miss, shot-in
the-dark notions of predecessors whose world was a
dark mystery to them . . .
