... I don't mean to suggest that all insane or
mentally deficient persons should be put to death and
I know that "Bull Session" didn't intend to be in
terpreted that way. I will agree, too, that one would
hardly know where to draw the line in determining
who should live and who should die and that we mor
tals are hardly fitted to be judges but in some extreme
cases where the person in question is merely flesh with
practically no intelligence whatsoever, it seems to me
we could safely say they would be better off dead . ..
