# French Report Victory in Air
## American-built Planes Are Decisive Factor 
### United Press 
The Allies' jubilant claims that tho
lifting of the United States arms
embargo may become a decisive fac
tor in the war found a measure of
support Monday when the French
high command announced Ameri
can-made warplanes had won the
biggest air battle thus far on the
western front.
Great Britain and France hope to
obtain hundreds more of these same
planes—sleek Curtiss fighters—now
that the door has been opened to
cash-and-carry war purchases in
the United States.
The French high command an
nounced nine of the Cuiiiss pursuit
planes, outnumbered three to one
by German planes, had shot down
nine of the Nazi ships in a spectacu
lar battle over the fighting lines and
had returned without loss of a single
plane.
The battle, the French said, proved
"definitely" the superiority of the
American-made planes over Ger
many's.
The German high command made
no mention of the air battle, merely
stating in its communique a German
pursuit ship shot down a French
plane near Saarburg.
The U.S. Army and Navy foresaw
wholesale shipments of American
warplanes to the Allies and took
steps to control them in protection
of the United States' own security.
Measures were imposed to prevent
American plane manufacturers from
carelessly betraying any U. S. mili
tary secrets or delaying this nation's
own air expansion for the sake of
European profits.
