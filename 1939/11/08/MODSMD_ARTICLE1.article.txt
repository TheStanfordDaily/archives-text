### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
IF THE Administration thought all
its problems were solved when it
passed the Neutrality Revision-Bill
that provides for cash-and-carry
shipment of war materials to bel
ligerents, it had its hopes blasted
yesterday.
Already internal dissention has
reared its capitalistic head with the
news that the U. S. Lines proposes
to transfer eight company vessels to
the Panama flag in an attempt to
escape the revised law. John Frank
lin, president of the corporation,
said there is no "subterfuge" in his
action, and that the move is defend
ed by President Roosevelt as legal
under the aqt. On the other hand,
Secretary of State Cordell Hull,
strongest member of the official
family, condemned the proposal
strongly. He said it violated the
spirit of the law.
Whether or not Roosevelt was
influenced by Hull's definite stand
011 (lie matter isn't known, but the
President announced, at least, that
a "delay" order has been issued to
halt Ihe transfer of the vessels.
Meanwhile, Franklin, the presi
dent of the company, met with
newshawks in a hotel in Wash
ington in an effort to dispel con
fusion centering around his pro
posal.

is not a subterfuge,"
Franklin said. "We are moti
vated solely by our desire to con
tinue to serve American shippers."
He pointed out that disruption of the
U. S. Lines' north Atlantic service
might jeopardize the company's
plans to operate new ships in these
routes after the end of the Euro
pean war.
"The British are likely to get the
business if America loses out," he
said.
On the surface, U. S. Lines'
move hits all the earmarks of a
slightly disreputable act to avoid
adherence to the government's
neutrality program. If it's not di
rectly illegal, it seems to violate,
as Secretary of State Hull believes,
the spirit of the law. But the case
isn't as cut-and-dried as it ap
pears. There are, as Wodehouse is
fond of saying, "wheels within
wheels."

There is, actually, no question
about the legality of the transfer of
flags under the Neutrality Act. The
United States and its citizens have
cvevy right -to sell property to a
neutral nation or to transfer title to
neutrals. Furthermore, as the trans
fer is proposed, it would involve no
danger to American lives, because,
once the registry has been assigned
to Panama, the Neutrality Act would
prevent Americans serving as offi
cers or crew aboard the vessels.
Should the vessels be sunk while
flying the Panamanian flag there
could be no international episode as
to ship, crew, or cargo.

IF THE transfer of flags inter
fered in any way with national
defense, the issue would be con
siderably altered. If the Maritime
Commission felt there was any
danger of involvement in war, or
if a specific vessel in question was
Iniilt on Navy specifications and
was important for national pro
tection, the Commission would re
ject the suggestion.

Of course, even in peace time, the
Maritime Commission can turn down
transferance of American vessels.
President Roosevelt pointed this out,
mentioning, as an instance, the hy
pothetical possibility under which a
foreign power — Germany, Britain,
Italy—might offer high prices for
American flag ships in order to end
competition on some Latin-American
run. Such an offer, he said, would
be refused by the Maritime Com
mission.
At any rate, the Maritime Com
mission is still undecided. The
President has been kept closely in
formed on the latest developments.
And the decision will probably be
known today. But. until the trouble
is ironed out, Washington's official
family is at swords' points over a
matter of international ethics.
