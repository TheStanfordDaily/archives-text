# Dr. Bailey Willis Expresses Own Definite Political Views
## 
### BUD AMES 
Bailey Willis, professor emeritus of geology, is definite to his toes —as
definite as his white bushy heard, his curt telephone conversation and his
expressed political opinions.
\ Not so definite however was his obscure entrance into the field of
geology. "I became a geologist because a Japanese student got a 100 in a

test which we took at the
Columbia School of Mines back in
1877," he confessed with a half
hidden smile.
"I tried for eight months to prove
myself as good as that Japanese. I

exploration which led far into the
interior, following in the track of the
explorer Raphael Pumpelly, the
founder of China's geology, he re
turned to write a monologue on re
search in China in co-operation with
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder.
On the move again, he journeyed
next to Argentina in search of pre
historic man.
"And I didn't find him," he
chuckled.
PATAGONIA NEXT
Patagonia was the next land of
call. The bearded little professor
explored the Andes for their water
and economic resources. He even
went so far as to plan a great city in
those mountains, but all those plans
went "boom" with the war.
So the professor came home, and
took over the reins of Stanford's
geology department from Dr. Bran
ner. That was in 1914 and in 1918
he began a study of conditions under
