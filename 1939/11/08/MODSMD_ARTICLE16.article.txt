# Dr. Bailey Willis Expresses Own Definite Political Views
## 
### BUD AMES 
Bailey Willis, professor emeritus of geology, is definite to his toes —as
definite as his white bushy heard, his curt telephone conversation and his
expressed political opinions.
\ Not so definite however was his obscure entrance into the field of
geology. "I became a geologist because a Japanese student got a 100 in a

test which we took at the
Columbia School of Mines back in
1877," he confessed with a half
hidden smile.
"I tried for eight months to prove
myself as good as that Japanese. I
got geology but I never got a 100."
BAILEY'S LIFE STORY
Sounding much like pages from a
fairy story, Professor Willis' geolog
ical life story opened in 1881 when
he explored, a pack on his back, the
northwest territory to ascertain the
freight resources for the Northern
Pacific railroad. He tramped all
through Oregon, Washington, and
Idaho in search of coal.
The United States couldn't hold
Professor Willis, off he sailed to
China in 1903 for the Carnegie Insti
tute of Washington. After a year of
exploration which led far into the
interior, following in the track of the
explorer Raphael Pumpelly, the
founder of China's geology, he re
turned to write a monologue on re
search in China in co-operation with
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder.
On the move again, he journeyed
next to Argentina in search of pre
historic man.
"And I didn't find him," he
chuckled.
PATAGONIA NEXT
Patagonia was the next land of
call. The bearded little professor
explored the Andes for their water
and economic resources. He even
went so far as to plan a great city in
those mountains, but all those plans
went "boom" with the war.
So the professor came home, and
took over the reins of Stanford's
geology department from Dr. Bran
ner. That was in 1914 and in 1918
he began a study of conditions under
which earthquakes occur—and he is
still at it.
"Nobody can predict when an
earthquake will occur," he stated
with extreme definiteness in retalia
tion to accusation that he had pre
dicted an earthquake for last Sun
day. "I can only predict where
earthquakes are likely to occur
sometime—and San Andreas is one
oi those spots."
ALSO KNOWS POLITICS
Professor Willis knows his geology
and he knows his politics. And he
definitely—definitely—is opposed to
question 5 which went to the vote
yesterday.
"I worked under Theodore Roose
velt in developing the conservation
policy which has given us our for
est reserve in national parks," he
explained. "I support the conserva
tion of natural resources and firmly
believe that large financial interests
developing resources should be un
der the control of a governmental
commission."
COMMENTS FURTHER
"The Atkinson Oil Bill, number 5,
puts its success on the impartiality
of the commission. But I can find no
reason in the history of politics in
California or in the character of
the electorate which will choose our
future politicians, to believe that a
commission appointed by the polit
ical administration will be compe
tent to handle the great oil in
dustry."
Firey stuff—it's true. But Profes
sor Willis is definite on the subject
—and a nickel to a nickelodeon says
he's right, to his toes.

explored the Andes for their water
and economic resources. He even
went so far as to plan a great city in
those mountains, but all those plans
went "boom" with the war.
So the professor came home, and
took over the reins of Stanford's
geology department from Dr. Bran
ner. That was in 1914 and in 1918
he began a study of conditions under
which earthquakes occur—and he is
still at it.
"Nobody can predict when an
earthquake will occur," he stated
with extreme definiteness in retalia
tion to accusation that he had pre
dicted an earthquake for last Sun
day. "I can only predict where
earthquakes are likely to occur
sometime—and San Andreas is one
oi those spots."
ALSO KNOWS POLITICS
Professor Willis knows his geology
and he knows his politics. And he
definitely—definitely—is opposed to
question 5 which went to the vote
yesterday.
"I worked under Theodore Roose
velt in developing the conservation
policy which has given us our for
est reserve in national parks," he
explained. "I support the conserva
tion of natural resources and firmly
believe that large financial interests
developing resources should be un
der the control of a governmental
commission."
COMMENTS FURTHER
"The Atkinson Oil Bill, number 5,
puts its success on the impartiality
of the commission. But I can find no
reason in the history of politics in
California or in the character of
the electorate which will choose our
future politicians, to believe that a
commission appointed by the polit
ical administration will be compe
tent to handle the great oil in
dustry."
Firey stuff—it's true. But Profes
sor Willis is definite on the subject
—and a nickel to a nickelodeon says
he's right, to his toes.
Bailey Willis, professor emeritus of geology, is definite to his toes —as
definite as his white bushy heard, his curt telephone conversation and his
expressed political opinions.
\ Not so definite however was his obscure entrance into the field of
geology. "I became a geologist because a Japanese student got a 100 in a

test which we took at the
Columbia School of Mines back in
1877," he confessed with a half
hidden smile.
"I tried for eight months to prove
myself as good as that Japanese. I
got geology but I never got a 100."
BAILEY'S LIFE STORY
Sounding much like pages from a
fairy story, Professor Willis' geolog
ical life story opened in 1881 when
he explored, a pack on his back, the
northwest territory to ascertain the
freight resources for the Northern
Pacific railroad. He tramped all
through Oregon, Washington, and
Idaho in search of coal.
The United States couldn't hold
Professor Willis, off he sailed to
China in 1903 for the Carnegie Insti
tute of Washington. After a year of
exploration which led far into the
interior, following in the track of the
explorer Raphael Pumpelly, the
founder of China's geology, he re
turned to write a monologue on re
search in China in co-operation with
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder.
On the move again, he journeyed
next to Argentina in search of pre
historic man.
"And I didn't find him," he
chuckled.
PATAGONIA NEXT
Patagonia was the next land of
call. The bearded little professor
explored the Andes for their water
and economic resources. He even
went so far as to plan a great city in
those mountains, but all those plans
went "boom" with the war.
