# Ham and Eggs Issues Threat To Recall Olson
## Los Angeles Defeats Proposal in Surprise Vote of 100,000 'No's' 
### United Press 
Leaders of the California Life Re
tirement Payments Association, pro
moters of the $30 Every Thursday
pension, conceded defeat within
four hours after the polls closed. At
the same time they issued a threat
to circulate petitions for the recall
of Governor Culbert Olson, who
opposed the proposal.
While still buried under the ava
lanche of ballots, election officials
estimated one of the largest votes
ever cast in California had been
recorded. Fair weather and intense
interest in the propositions brought
out a majority of the state's 3,606,000
qualified electors.
WINS BY MARGIN
When more than half the precincts
of the slate were heard from, it was
apparent the Ham and Eggs plan
would be beaten by a margin larger
than the 255,000 votes with which
it was sent back to the kitchen in
the 1938 election.
Los Angeles turned in a surpris
ing vote. The state's most populous
county, which in 1938 defeated the
same proposal by 72.000 votes,
showed a lead of more than 100,000
against it this time on the basis of
current returns.
S.F. 2-1 AGAINST
San Francisco, which turned it
down last year by 40,000, established
a lead of 187,812 to 84,076 against
the initiative which proposed to re
tire all citizens over 50—there are
1,300,000 in California — and pay
them the equivalent of $30 in state
warrants every Thursday for life.
Even in San Diego, one of the six
counties which voted yes a year
ago, the proposal trailed this time.
OIL BILL SUPPORTED
Second in intei-est. to the pension
plan was the Atkinson Oil Bill, cre
ating a state system of control of
petroleum production. It was backed
by President Roosevelt, Secretary of
Interior Harold Ickes, the Navy, Gov
ernor Culbert Olson, large produc
ers and the CIO. Small independent
producers and the AFL opposed it.
San Francisco returns showed ap
proval of the bill but the Los An
geles vote was heavily against it.
The Ham and Eggs newspaper urged
pension followers to vote no on the
plan. The bill trailed badly in the
state.
