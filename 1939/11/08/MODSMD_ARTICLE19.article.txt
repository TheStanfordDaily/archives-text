# Ohioans Squelch $50 Pension Plan
## 
### 
Ohio voters turned down an old
age pension plan by a heavy majority
lute returns indicated Tuesday night.
The vole was running about three to
one aganist the plan, which would
have paid $50 a month to persons
over 60.
New York State's only statewide
issue was constitutional amendment
to permit pari-mutuel betting on
horse races. It was winning by about
2 to 1 with more than half the elec
tion districts counted.
Early returns gave New Jersey's
$21,000,000 bond issue for relief a
head start, but the returns were al
most all from Mayor Frank Hague's
stronghold in Jersey City and Ho
boken, where the Democratic ma
chine also is extremely powerful.
As an example of what opponents
had to contend with, returns from
'ill of Jersey City's 'M'.i districts
were: yes, 67,470; no, 4,721.
