# 'Keep Out Of Balkans' Says Duce
## Italy Fells Russia That Fascist Army Is 'Peace Guardian' 
### 
ROME, Nov. 7 (UP).â€”ltaly blunt
ly warned Russia today to stay out
of the Balkans and the Danube Basin
because the European powers have
acknowledged Premier Benito Mus
solini's mission as "guardian of
peace" there.
The warning was served by the
journalist Virginia Gayda, frequent
ly mouthpiece for Mussolini, in the
Giornale d'ltalia and constituted the
sharpest pronouncement thus far on
Italy's attitude toward Russia and
the new Soviet - German working
agreement.
GAYDA COMMENTS
Referring to yesterday's manifesto
of the Communist Internationale, on
the 22nd anniversary of the Russian
revolution, Gayda said:
"This manifesto proves that there
is no direct accord between Moscow
and Berlin < and that Communism,
with its destructive plan, dominates
the Soviet government."
He referred to the manifesto's
statement that "Germany as well as
England and France is fighting for
world hegemony" in an imperialist
war.
STRIKES SAVAGELY
The Giornale d'ltalia struck sav
agely at the manifesto's attack on
Italian neutrality and allegation that
"the Italian boui'geoisie is awaiting
the propitious moment to hurl itself
against the loser and claim its share
of the victor's spoils,"
"The Comintern's appeal assigns
to Russia that candid mission as
guardian of peace in the Danube re
gion and the Balkans and affirms
that its action has impeded the
transformation of the European con
flict into a world war," Gayda wrote.
"Mussolini's Italy and not Com
munist Russia assumed this mis
sion. Everybody in Europe has ac
knowledged this."
ITALY'S PEACE POLICY
"Italy's clear policy of peace and
collaboration which for some time
has been applied to the Danubian
and Balkan countries preserves
peace in these countries which al
ready sense agitations caused by ap
proaching Russian pressure."
Gayda's statements, accusing Rus
sia of adopting a dangerous policy of
aggrandizement and of working for
20 years to bring about a Commu
nist world revolution, lent weight to
indications that Mussolini is playing
a major role in efforts to create a
Balkan peace bloc, built on the foun
dations of the Balkan Entente.
