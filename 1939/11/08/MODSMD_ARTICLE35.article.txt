# Kerman, Donahue Out; Pool Goes To Guard
## Tiny Scrambles Linemen, After 'Strongest Line' 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Tiny Thomhill for the nth time j
this season has found his strongest
line— strongest only in the face of
two major injuries to key linemen.
At least the starting line which ,
challenges the might of the beefy
Trojan forwards Saturday afternoon
will be the best under (he circum- (
•stances.
What has put teeth into the Indian 1
forward wall was yesterday's mov
ing of Hump Pool back to his old
haunt at leit guard. Two weeks ago
'
Stan Andersen, senior tackle, !
was elected permanent captain of
Stanford's football team last night.
Heretofore, an acting loader was
chosen before each game.
when Tiny was well satisfied that j
John Kerman could fill the bill — j
which he adequately did—Pool was i
given a fling at quarter.
lv HUMAN OUT
Even though Kerman's injury j
definitely put him on the shelf for
the rest of the season, Tiny decided
to take his chances with Bill Bra- i
heny and Steve Keuseff. That posi- |
tion was turned into a thorough- j
(fare for the pounding Broncos last i
week.
Now Pool is back at his old guard j
job "just in ease," but he'll probably i
start there against the Trojan War
horse.
Corky Donahue, who tore some
ligaments in his right knee against 1
the Broncs, is out for at least the
S.C. and W.S.C. games. His chances
for getting into the Big Game and
making the trip to New York for
Dartmouth hang in balance.
Mcdonough at tackle
John McDonough since Monday
has been at right tackle but Bill
Trout still spells him and may get
the nod. McDonough has come up
from the obscurity of the third team
and is a 190-pounder.
Bill Greer, second string wing and
Stan Graff's sub, was put out of
commission yesterday when he
wrenched his knee in a line scrim
mage. That puts both sub wingmen
under the weather since Fred Meyer
is in the hospital with a bad ankle.
I'ETERSON INJURED
Thor Peterson was definitely put
on the season's casualty list when it
was learned that he won't don an
other uniform this season.
With all these injuries and half
injuries which has been hexing the
Indians, Thornhill has decidcd to
call oft any scrimmage between now
and Saturday. However, a pass
scrimmage may be called this after
noon.

What has put teeth into the Indian 1
forward wall was yesterday's mov

haunt at leit guard. Two weeks ago

Stan Andersen, senior tackle, !
was elected permanent captain of
Stanford's football team last night.
Heretofore, an acting loader was
chosen before each game.
when Tiny was well satisfied that j
John Kerman could fill the bill — j
which he adequately did—Pool was i
given a fling at quarter.
lv HUMAN OUT
Even though Kerman's injury j
definitely put him on the shelf for
the rest of the season, Tiny decided
to take his chances with Bill Bra- i
heny and Steve Keuseff. That posi- |
tion was turned into a thorough- j
(fare for the pounding Broncos last i
week.
Now Pool is back at his old guard j
job "just in ease," but he'll probably i
start there against the Trojan War
horse.
Corky Donahue, who tore some
ligaments in his right knee against 1
the Broncs, is out for at least the
S.C. and W.S.C. games. His chances
for getting into the Big Game and
making the trip to New York for
Dartmouth hang in balance.
Mcdonough at tackle
John McDonough since Monday
has been at right tackle but Bill
Trout still spells him and may get
the nod. McDonough has come up
from the obscurity of the third team
and is a 190-pounder.
Bill Greer, second string wing and
Stan Graff's sub, was put out of
commission yesterday when he
wrenched his knee in a line scrim
mage. That puts both sub wingmen
under the weather since Fred Meyer
is in the hospital with a bad ankle.
I'ETERSON INJURED
Thor Peterson was definitely put
on the season's casualty list when it
was learned that he won't don an
other uniform this season.
With all these injuries and half
injuries which has been hexing the
Indians, Thornhill has decidcd to
call oft any scrimmage between now
and Saturday. However, a pass
scrimmage may be called this after
noon.
Tiny Thomhill for the nth time j
this season has found his strongest
line— strongest only in the face of
two major injuries to key linemen.
