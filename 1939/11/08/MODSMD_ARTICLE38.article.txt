# Waterdogs Leave Tomorrow For Week-end U.C.L.A. Tilt
## 
### 
Usually blue waters of Encina pool have taken on a musty mist of late
under the glare of Coach Nort Thornton.
With the team scheduled to leave for Los Angeles tomorrow, things
aren't up to usual. In the first place, the varsity men Monday underwent
1 a scrimmage with the junior varsity. They won. t! to 1. Hut, if you
' haven't heard the story,

how:
FIRST HALF SCORES
They scored all six of their goals
in the first half—with a substitute
goalie in the net. In the second
half, with first-stringer Frank
Dowling working against them, the
Indians were outscored by one goal
as the jayvee collected its lone tally.
Of course, this doesn't mean defeat
for the locals when they travel South
this week-end. Coach Thornton
thinks they may beat U.C.L.A. their
recent conquerors—if they can just
maneuver their passing successfully.
Trouble in that department caused
the Indians' downfall in the first
game.
DEFEAT HANGS HEAVY
But still there is that defeat by
the Olympic Club last Friday night
hanging over the Cards' heads. The
Winged-0 seven is national junior
champion—but the licking was the
worst ever handed a Stanford team.
The Olympians won by a seven
point margin, 10 to 3.
So it's just everything put together
that has Coach Nort wondering. As
for the trip South, however, there
is definitely a chance that Stanford
may take both games. The local
mentor is more worried about the
U.S.C. game than the one with the
Bruins, who are leading the con
ference.
