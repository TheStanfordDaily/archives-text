# Refugee to Talk At Luncheon Club
## 
### 
A refugee with two tons of booksâ€”
that is an apt description of Dr.
I David Baumgardt., former German
i philosophy professor, who will speak
| before Luncheon Club today on
| "Why I Came to America."
When he left Germany for Eng
land three years ago. Dr. Baum
gardt found it absolutely necessary
to his work to have his library with
him. It took time and no little ef
fort to get the complete collection
out of the country. Now he is faced
with a similar difficulty in getting
the books from England to America.
Luncheon Club will convene at
12:10 o'clock in the Nitery. The af
fair is under the management of a
student steering committee with
Jane Roth as chairman.
