# Sequoia to Meet Frosh Paddlers
## 
### 
The "scoreless wonders," better
I known as the frosh water polo team,
, will meet Sequoia High School at
4:15 o'clock this afternoon in En
| cina Pool. The last time the two
teams met, the frosh took the short
| end of the score. The Papooses lost
to the San Jose State frosh squad
11-4 last Wednesday.
