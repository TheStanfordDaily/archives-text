# Card Booters Seek Revenge Over San Jose
## Soccermen Need Win Today to Keep Shot At Conference Title 
### 
Card booters will have their last
j chance to get back into the running
i for the conference soccer champion
i ship when they meet S;m Jose State
I on the Spartan field this afternoon.
The Spartans handed Harry Ma
j loney's crew a 2-1 licking on an
I overtime game just two weeks ago
jon the Card field. It was the first
j defeat for the Farm eleven, but last
Saturday they dropped a 1-0 deci
| sion to U.S.F. in San Francisco.
| MALONEY HOPES FOR BEST
i Maloney was disappointed by thÂ£
team's showing against the Dons,
but hopes that they will be able to
profit by the mistakes made in that
encounter.
Tito Sanz-Agero, ace Stanford
J goalie, is still suffering from a bad
I shoulder, and will probably not see
action today. Rudy Munzer took his
place against the Dons, and turned
in a good game.
DOLE HAS TOUGH LUCK
The Indian defense has been
strong all season, but the forwards
haven't been able to score consist
ently.
I George Dole was the hard-luck
j kid of the U.S.F. game. A powerful
; kicker, Dole had three of his tries
| for goal hit the upright and bounce
l the wrong way, and one shot hit
| the crossbar and bounded over the
| net.
Thursday, 16 Indian booters will
| leave for Los Angeles to play
I U.C.L.A. Saturday morning.
