## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Injured Frosh GRidders In Line-up for Cal Game Shipkeymen Hold Offensive Drill: Attack Features Weak Side Plays 
### 
Haivk Norberg almost ruined Coach Harry Shipkey's hopes of having
a completely intact freshman eleven ready to hurl against Cat's yearlings
by turning up in the hospital with a broken blood vessel that has failed 1
to heal sufficiently since last Friday's scrimmage.
However, Shipkey expects the towering (tankman to he ready for the

Cubs even though he may not be at<
lop efficiency. Another former first
stringer who is on the mend is Eric
. Armstrong. It finally seems that
, little Eric can't be counted on for
those flashy runs he turned in early
in the season. His tricky knee just
hasn't cleared up, but Eric is bound
to see some action.
GRIDDERS HOLD DRILL
The Card yearlings went through
some more of their offensive drill
i today. The renovated Papoose at
tack featured weak side plays. To
morrow Shipkey will instruct his
â€¢ reserves on the intricacies of Cal's
attack and then throw some Cub
, plays at the Cards' first and second
; stringers.
I California's freshman eleven is
undisputedly a powerful one and
can well be feared by Shipkeymen.
To date they boast a seasonal rec
' ord of 4 victories and one tie.
BEAT LONG BEACH
They opened their season slowly
with a 14-0 win over San Francisco
Junior College, and then gathered
momentum to roll through Santa Ana
Junior College 26-0 and U.C.L.A.'s
frosh 41-14. They were truly lucky
to tie U.S.C.'s powerful freshman
; outfit, which beat the Card year
j lings 13-12, at 7 points apiece.
Their least victory was a 14-12
win over Long Beach Junior College
! in which they were forced to come
j from behind to win. Shipkey picked
] up some mighty helpful points con
! ceming the Bear offense at this tilt.
Greater London spreads over 693
' miles.
