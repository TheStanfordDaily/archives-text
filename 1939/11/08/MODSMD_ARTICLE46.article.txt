# Card Malleteers Defeated Twice
## 
### 
The opponents of Stanford's polo i
team seem to have an affection for j
the number 14. Last Saturday, the !
Monterey Presidio trounced the In
dians 14-2, and yesterday the Tevi.s
Four downed them again by a 14-8
score.
It was an improved Card outfit
that took the field yesterday, but
they were unable to cope with the
fine playing of Captain Tevis, who
accounted for 8 goals. Seven Farm
riders saw action in the contest with
Gale Medlicott and Art La Prade
leading the parade with two tallies
apiece.
Declaring that the Indians' faults
are none that experience won't cure,
Major Smith has scheduled a home

game this Friday with the Pogonip
Club before the team entrains for
Los Angeles where they will en
gage the Riviera C. C. Sunday. Joe
Smith, Art LaPrade, Gail Medlicott,
Len Weisenburg, and Stan Glikbarg
have been named* to make the trip.
