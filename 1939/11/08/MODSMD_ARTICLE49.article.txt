# Not to Die in Vain

IT did not pass.
No, despite the votes of the lowa-bred citi
zens of Southern California and the "things
can't-be-any-worse" faction, the Retirement Life
Payments Plan did not go through in yester
day's election.
Yet, over 500,000 citizens of the state voted
for it. And that is something to think about.
Most of them did not favor "Ham and Eggs"
because they were convinced that it would
prove the answer to all of California's economic
problems or that it would give them something
for nothing.
They voted for it because they were gaining
nothing from the present system, and they felt
that no matter what the effects of "$3O Every
Thursday" might be, the situation, for them,
could not be any worse.
Obviously, this is not the proper way to
remedy matters. But something inside of a
drowning man makes him grab for the first
plank he sees, even if it has rusty nails in it.
In any state where over 500,000 people are
willing to approve a plan, chiefly because it
abolishes the present set-up, something is
wrong. The democratic system of political and
economic control is not working correctly.
Almost every vote for "Ham and Eggs"
proves that this must be the case in California.
The election of November, 1939, cannot be
laughed off as the death of a screw-ball idea.
It is a definite sign of illness within the body
corporate, as valid a symptom as possibly could
be displayed.
The state cannot cure its disease with patent
medicines like "S3O Every Thursday," dis
pensed by guacks like Willis Allen. It needs to
have a scientific diagnosis made by experts â€”
and to adopt the remedy they prescribe.
The rottenness that lies in those 500,000 votes
must be cured.
