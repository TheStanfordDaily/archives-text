# Guinea Pigs with Grace
## 
### 
THERE are two things that anyone who has
taken Psych 51 will remember definitely: (1)
That psychology is not an exact science; (2)
That not a week goes by in which some psy
chological experiment does not take place here
at Stanford.
They remember the first because the fact that
psychology is still in rather a formative stage
is constantly drummed into them. They re
member the second because they all have to
take the part of the much maligned guinea pig
in at least three experiments.
This week the psychology department is
holding a large experiment which may at the
same time be one of its more important under
takings. It is testing the entire junior class for
possible indications of basic shifts in attitudes
and interests of students after two years in
college.
The class of '41 was tested when it first en
tered the University, and those early tests will
be used to offset those being taken this week.
From this experiment possible aid may be
gained in planning posterity's early college
training period, and, incidentally, it will give
the psychologists another clue, another insight
into man in general.
These tests will be one more step toward
eliminating the first of the two things students
are certain to remember about psychology.
Unfortunately for the student, they will, in all
probability, only spur on the current tendency
psychologists have of making guinea pigs of
their pupils.â€”D. T.
