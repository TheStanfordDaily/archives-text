# Night Before Wednesday

THREE years ago a young Bull Sessioner
aptly classified the Tuesday Evening Series
as "a gift to Palo Alto's latter-day saints with a
partiality for self-mortification." And his criti
cism was quite just.

Presented at that time in the drafty confines
of the old little theater, Room iOO, the subject
of the lecture seldom was anything more fasci
nating than "The Intracellular Habits of the
Paramecium" or "Fauna of Northern New
Guinea That I Have Known."
The young Bull Sessioner suggested that
when the Tuesday Series (and all 10 members
of its audience) were moved to the new Memo
rial Hall, the guality of the entertainment should
change as radically as had its setting.
And the Committee on Public Exercises took
his advice.
First-class lecturers, speaking on topics of
general interest, have been engaged. And with
the new facilities, motion pictures, dancers,
singers, and musicians have been added to the
list of events.
Abbe Dimnet, William Rose Benet, Leonard
Q. Ross, Kermit Roosevelt, and Roy Howard are
among the distinguished men who spoke here
last year. And Percy Grainger, Andre Marchal,
and the Roth Quartet, great names in the field
of music, performed.
Last night Louis Adamic, one of the country's
most brilliant authors, spoke to a large, in
tensely interested crowd in Memorial Hall.
Three years ago this would have come as a
thunderbolt. But now it is only an outstanding
lecture in a uniformly worth-while series.
