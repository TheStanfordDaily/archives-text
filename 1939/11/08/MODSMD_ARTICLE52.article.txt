### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
A WORD FOR INTOLERANCE
IT HAS become a great social pastime to criticize the
critic. Gangsters, hit-and-run drivers, and Hearst
are periodically the nation's favorite hates. But there
is always an open season on the chronic individualist.
"Why," some solid citizens are always asking, "do
awful people like George Bernard Shaw always have
nasty things to say when we live in such a great,
wide, beautiful world?" Crabbing, complaining, tear
ing down, and more popular words to describe the
same thing are among the words in the English lan
guage connoting a maximum amount of shame and
villainy.
Novelist-psychologists call this mass disaffection
for the man who stands alone "the gregarious instinct.
Voltaire called it stupidity. But whatever it is, it
gets pretty boring.
Granted, until a person commits suicide the world
holds more good than ill. Granted, the bees are usually
making honey, and birds have never been known to
declare a moratorium on singing. Granted, there is
much "constructive" work to be done. Human beings
still have to face quite a few ridiculous things in this
"great, wide, beautiful world." Degrading as it is to
our great, wide, beautiful egos, our institutions are not
perfect.

|>UT MOST of us hate to have our imperfections
dwelt upon. Our short-comings are as irritating as
shaving with a dull razor and cold water. Besides, it
usually takes too much effort to join critics. So,
obviously, the simple thing to do is just to call the
man with enough courage to criticize the popular
idea "destructive." It saves us a great deal of thinking
and gives us a goat to whom we can feel superior.
"Look at that unpatriotic Senator Norris," we could
say in 1917. "He doesn't want us to go to war." The
fact that Senator Norris held views different from ours
obviously implied that we were fine fellows.
Of course, twenty or thirty years after the pioneer
critic has succeeded in accomplishing something, then
it's all right if we join him. But preferably, before
we agree with him, he should be dead. That makes it
much safer.
W. S. Gilbert, Sullivan's critical lyricist, was not
knighted until many years after his bitter prime, not
so much beciiuse he happened to notice that the Cap
tain of the Queen's Navy was a stuffed uniform. Every
one noticed that. It was just that he was so indis
creet to tell everyone about it. Frankness is a crime,
radicalism, and offensive to the Dies Committee. If
the Russian Revolution had taken place long enough
before Gilbert's time, he unquestionably would have
been "an agent of Moscow."
Honest critics are really pretty valuable, even
when they're living.
