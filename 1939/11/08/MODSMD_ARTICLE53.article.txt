TP HE EDITOR, SIR:
. . . Men possess certain inalienable rights which
may not be taken from them. These rights are not
given to men by any state—lhey never have been
and never will be. The rights of which I speak are
man's because of his very nature —he is more than just
an animal, he is possessed with a principle which gives
him the power of reason and free choice. In the case
of idiots, this same principle is present but due to
physical impediments, the full potentialities do not
become active as in the instance of a normal person.
But to take the life of a man without a just cause
would be an infringement of such rights by the state,
As has been emphasized before, just causes do exist,
i.e., the taking of the life of one found guilty of mur
der by a jury. Thus, there must exist a just cause or
the life of an individual may not be taken. Therefore,
the extermination of idiots who have committed no
act against society is intrinsically unjust . . .

IN STATING that the extermination of idiots was
representative of Communistic and Fascistic
thought, I did not intend to imply that such practices
had their origin in those countries as you have so
readily assumed I have meant.
Rather do I contend that these forms of govern
ment fail to recognize the natural rights possessed by
persons living under them, and in exterminating idiots
who have committed no act against society, certain
of these rights are violated by the state.
If you do deny the existence of such rights as pos
sessed by human beings and also deny that there is a
principle which combined with our physical nature
gives us the use of reason and free choice (the founda
tion for our inalienable rights)—then, Mr. Mellinkoff,
the.reasonableness of your suggestions are logical.

r |"<HE EDITOR, SIR:
I think that there are quite a few of the readers
of Tin- Stanford Daily who will agree with P. C. in
his communication in The Stanford Daily of November
1 that "Bull Session" represents tho anti-Christ, the
anti- of everything that is good and fine in our com
munity."
Very truly yours,
Dorsey A. Lyon
