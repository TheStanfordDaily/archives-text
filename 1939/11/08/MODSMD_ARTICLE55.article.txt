## 
### 
Louis Adamic, author of "My
America" and "A Native's Return,"
last night addressed 1000 people in
Memorial Hal! on "America, Na
tion of Nations." His talk was based
on much of the research he is doing
for his new book, "Nation of Na
tions."
His address was prefaced with a
discussion of the population make
up of the country, pointing out the
different type of immigrant which
came as a result of the Industrial
Revolution. According to Mr. Ada
mic, one half of the present, popu
lation is of immigrant stock, who
are not familiar with the spiritual
life which is based on the American
traditions of the older Anglo-Saxon
settlers, nor of the protestant relig
ion.
"There is entirely too much
prejudice and intolerance between
these groups. It is growing, and it
is bad for America," said Mr. Adamic.
"America is not a finished or per
fect product; it is a process. Amer
icans include all of us regardless of
our name. Americans have always
liked variety. There is future unity
in this diversity," he said. "Let's
make America sale for differences."
Last night's lecture is to be print
ed in a pamphlet, and Mr. Adamic
told the audience that upon receipt
of a letter requesting the booklet
enclosing the name and address, he
would be glad to send each one of
them a copy. Mr. Adamic may be
reached for a short time by writing
him in care of Hotel Clark, Los
Angeles.

first school to broadcast a football
game in 1921.
