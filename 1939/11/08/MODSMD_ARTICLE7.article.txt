# Model Plane Club Plans Announced
## 
### 
Plans for the formation of a Stan
ford model airplane club were re
vealed yesterday by Robert Peter
son, freshman from Johannesburg,
South Africa.
Peterson expressed the hope that
enough students would be interested
to make possible the formation of a
local chapter of the Junior National
Aeronautics Association, an organi
zation devoted chiefly to model air
plane research.
Time and place of the first meet
ing will be announced in the Daily
Bulletin Board early next week, ac
cording to Peterson. All students
interested are urged to attend.
