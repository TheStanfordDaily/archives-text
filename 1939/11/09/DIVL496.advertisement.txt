f This is one you've just pot to have—
unless you're a bookish fellow given
to staying indoors. The watch-case top
on this pipe keeps the wind from tearing
! into the pipe-bowl and 'emptying it.
Protects the briar (and that new tweed
i outfit of yours) from burning.
j The slotted grill controls the draft
' perfectly, and slides back sideways for
! filling and emptying. The whole pipe is
trim as a watch and tight as a < lam—
| makes all other covered pipes look like
| the Gay Nineties. It's the smartest thing
! that's come through our doors in many
I years—you'll agree as soon as you see
I one. Shown above, No. 33.
