r PHE words "Group I" now may
mean nothing more to you than
the rating you didn't achieve in the
Aptitude Test.
But, on the day that the United
States declares war those words will
assume a vast and awesome im
portance for nearly every Stanford
man. For, whether or not he knows
it, if he's between the ages of 21
and 30, free, healthy, an American,
unhampered by dependent restric
tions, there is no reason why he will
not be inducted into the military
service of the nation. He will be a
part of the cream of America's
fighting forces—Class I. And he'll
make a Class I corpse, too.

When the United States went into
the last World War to rescue the
world from the forces of evil and
make it safe for an enlightened
democracy, the nation was totally
unprepared for military and indus
trial mobilization. This catastrophe
will not occur again.
The 1917 conscription procedure
was the work of a young cavalry
captain who retailed his inspiration
to his overlings in those crowded,
confused spring days. Hugh S. John
son was his name. He came back in
another crisis situation to author
and administer a different type of
mobilization 17 years later.
*{l * Wmr ~
| T TOOK America two months in
1917 to register its first men.
Today, in less than 30 days the first
privates will not only be regis
tered; they will be in uniform.
The explanation of this tremen
dous quickening of pace lies in the
fact that all preparations have
been made in advance.

In the nation's capital, while the
representatives of the people at
tempt to keep America out of war,
three groups of busy officials are
greasing the skids of mobilization,
should America be drawn into war.
With the arrvial of M-day—the term
that, military theorists use for mo
bilization day—these three boards
will swing into immediate action.
You won't know it; your next-door
neighbor won't realize it. But the
minute that America declares war,
the preparations of these men will
cease to be static, will become in
tensely dynamic.

r pilE Public Relations Board will
begin to convince American
manhood that "only a coward is
drafted; the patriot registers at
once." Subtly the board's propa
ganda will color news stories, creep
into the airlanes. Beneath the sur
face of every publicity release will
Ik- the vague, indistinct threaten
ing tone of punishments that will
clog those who refuse to register.
The Uniied States' burning pa
triotic appeal in 1917 drew 80,000
men in the first month. World
War I needed an army of 3,500,000.
No repetition of this will occur.

The actual work of conscription
will fall to the second of the three
government boards—the Joint Army
and Navy Selective Service Commit
tee. They can whip an army into
shape in less time than you can
ever imagine. In their files is an al
ready prepared bill to conscript ten
million men. Immediately after vot
ing to enter war, Congress will pass
the Selective Service Act, the basis
lor all'ensuing activity.
The third in the triumvirate of
committees is the War Resources
Board. Its purpose will be to con
script and regulate American in
dustry, agriculture, commerce.
When Class I goes to war there'll
be no time for indecision or doubt.
America is prepared!
