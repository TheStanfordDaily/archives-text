CONCERNS IKISII
The story concerns an intellectual,
unemotional canon whose unrelent
ing classicism is hated by his emo
tional Irish flock, and the parish
schoolmaster, sick of the corrupt
school system, who writes an athe
istic pamphlet.
These two misfit men have only
one thing in commonâ€”their respect
for Brigid, the canon's naive, com
pletely religious servant. It is
through her death that both men
return to fundamental faith.
The play's single set, designed by
Waldemar Johansen, depicts an
EJnglish-type country house fur
nished in substantial Elizabethan
style. The department salvaged a
small tree, cut down yesterday, to
put in the garden which is seen
through the windows.
MADE HIT IN N Y.
Paul Vincent Carroll, the author,
was working as a teacher in a Glas
gow settlement school, when his play
was discovered by George Jean Na
than, the New York critic. It was
produced in New York during the
1937-38 season, and was considered
one of the hits of the year.
Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Julie
| Haydon had the lead roles in the
1 Broadway production. Carroll's
j "The White Steed" was produced
j last year with equal success. Everett
j Glass is directing the Stanford pro
j duction.
