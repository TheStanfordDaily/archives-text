# Speakers Clarify Russ-German Pact at Student Union Meet
## Professor Finds Agreement "Frees' Soviet to Promote World Socialism 
### 
"The Soviet Union is now free Jet propagate a general movement of
Socialism the world over, as a result of lite Rosso-German pact.
This observation was the keynote of a discussion made by Dr. John
Horowitz, psychology professor of San Francisco Junior College, in which
he defended the pact and its implications last night at the quarter's first

open meeting of the Stanford
ter of the American Student Union. '
Scheduled to challenge the pact
was Dr. Harold Fisher of the Stan
lord history department, although in
reality Dr. Fisher clarified and in
terpreted the treaty in his discus- i
sion of the subject treated by both
speakers, "The Pro and Con of the
Russo-German Pact."
In expounding his theories, Dr.
Horowitz stated that the pact pre- j
serves freedom of maneuver in the
Soviet's international affairs, and
thus is a proponent of eventual
world socialism, and of eventual j
peace. He predicted that Germany I
herself is next in line for social
revolution, and that if the present J
war continues Germany will be the
first to collapse, and consequently i
the Soviet Union is in an advan
tageous position to move forward.
Interpreting popular theories in
relation to the pact, Dr. Fisher dis
credited the idea that the Soviet
double-crossed the Western Allies,
since "a great deal of diplomacy is
double-crossing, anyway."
Dr. Horowitz pointed out that the
economic forces have been more im- i
portant than the political develop- j
ments of the last 20 years in the I
eventual consummation of the
treaty. He advised that the pact has
broken the Fascist triangle of Ber
lin, Rome, and the Japanese. He in
terpreted this as unfortunate for J
the British and the Japanese.
ft has enabled the Soviet Union to
drive out the outposts of Fascism
and imperialism in the Baltic states,
which were potential dangers to the
Union, he added.
