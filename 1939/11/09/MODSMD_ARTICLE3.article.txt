# Beer Cellar Bomb Misses Der Fuehrer
## Six Veteran Nazis Killed after Hitler Speech in Munich 
### 
BERLIN, Thursday, Nov. 9 (UP).
—Adolf Hitler last night escaped by
only 15 minutes an "attempted as
sassination" at the birthplace of
Nazism in Munich, and a $200,000
government reward for information
as to identity of the "foreign insti
gators" blamed for the plot was of
fered immediately.
Six veteran Nazis who faced bul
lets with Hitler 16 years ago today
in the abortive Munich "beer cellar
putsch" were killed and (>0 persons
were wounded in an explosion that
shattered the Buergerbraeu beer hall
shortly after the Chancellor had
finished an anniversary speech to
his comrades. Hitler had left be
fore the explosion.
A time-bomb placed in an empty
attic above the crowded beer hall
caused the explosion, a guard at
the place told the Uniied Press by
telephone from Munich.
CEILING CRASHES DOWN
The blast, 30 minutes after the
end of Hitler's speech and 15 minutes
after his departure, sent the heavy
ceiling of the beer hall crashing on
the Nazis, he said.
Munich's wartime blackout was
lifted to facilitate rescue work and
wrecking crews began clearing away
the debris of the Nazi shrine.
Among the injured were four
women, presumably from the fami
lies of the 19 dead of the 1923 putsch
who each year are honored guests
at the beer cellar ceremonies.
The blast, ascribed officially to an
"explosive body," which might mean
a bomb, occurred at 9:35 p.m. (3:35
p.m.) yesterday. Hitler had ad
dressed a picked audience of about
500, including veterans of the 1923
putsch, high government leaders,
party leaders and officers of the
armed forces.
FOREIGNERS BLAMED
"The attempted assassination
seems traceable to foreign instiga
tors," the Propaganda Ministry an
nounced early today.
Today's announcement revealed
had it not been for the pressure of
war consultations and other duties
in Berlin, Hitler might have lingered
in the beer cellar after his 57-minute
speech long enough to have been
there when the bUist shattered the
place.
It was disclosed Hitler left the
beer cellar, to joyous "heils" of his
old comrades, only 15 minutes be
fore the explosion turned the place
into a shambles.

A time-bomb placed in an empty
attic above the crowded beer hall
caused the explosion, a guard at
the place told the Uniied Press by
telephone from Munich.
CEILING CRASHES DOWN
The blast, 30 minutes after the
end of Hitler's speech and 15 minutes
after his departure, sent the heavy
ceiling of the beer hall crashing on
the Nazis, he said.
Munich's wartime blackout was
lifted to facilitate rescue work and
wrecking crews began clearing away
the debris of the Nazi shrine.
Among the injured were four
women, presumably from the fami
lies of the 19 dead of the 1923 putsch
who each year are honored guests
at the beer cellar ceremonies.
The blast, ascribed officially to an
"explosive body," which might mean
a bomb, occurred at 9:35 p.m. (3:35
p.m.) yesterday. Hitler had ad
dressed a picked audience of about
500, including veterans of the 1923
putsch, high government leaders,
party leaders and officers of the
armed forces.
FOREIGNERS BLAMED
"The attempted assassination
seems traceable to foreign instiga
tors," the Propaganda Ministry an
nounced early today.
Today's announcement revealed
had it not been for the pressure of
war consultations and other duties
in Berlin, Hitler might have lingered
in the beer cellar after his 57-minute
speech long enough to have been
there when the bUist shattered the
place.
It was disclosed Hitler left the
beer cellar, to joyous "heils" of his
old comrades, only 15 minutes be
fore the explosion turned the place
into a shambles.
