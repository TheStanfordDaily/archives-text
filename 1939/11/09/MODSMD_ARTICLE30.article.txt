# Artist Predicts Cultural Advance
## 
### 
Since most of the pioneer sections j
in this country have completed their |
constructive periods, it Ls only nat- ;
ural that they should turn their at
tention to cultural attainments, ac- j
cording to Pedro de Lemos, director [
of the Stanford Museum and Art
Gallery, who spoke on the regular i
Stanford Hour over KGO last night.
He concluded with an explana
tion of his subject, "The Danger
Line in American Art," saying that
applause of the art of the ugly in
life and the undesirable accent upon
morbid or debased subjects creates j
an unfortunate trend for both the j
present and the future.
