AN OI'EN LETTER TO THE STAN- |
FORI) FOOTBALL TEAM:
Today you fellows entrain for Los >
Angeles to play a game with U.S.C.
which not one person in a thousand
gives you a chance of winning. In i
the Southland, 1 understand, the bet
ting gentry is giving away as many I
as 18 points, plus substantial odds.
The reason for the Trojans being
favored is obvious —their outfit i
hasn't lost a game, you fellows have
n't won one. The nearest S.C. has j
come to a defeat is a tie, and the !
nearest you have come to victory |
is also a tie.
There are a lot of Stanford stu- |
dents who are looking askance at i
you. They didn't mind you losing I
to Santa Clara, a much better team,
but they don't think you should j
have been so badly overwhelmed
by the Broncos. A lot of these
Cardinal rooters don't think you
should have lost a couple of the
other games.
I've talked to a lot of you fel- |
lows, and it seems that your per- j
sonal opinions mirror those ex- j
pressed above. You have almost
unanimously admitted that you j
should have won a few of those
games, and that Santa Clara should
never have beaten us, 27-7.
Most of these critics seem to forget I
the U.C.L.A. game—another one in I
which you weren't given a chance, j
But that day you fellows were in j
the mood to play great football, and j
you did play great football. These |
critics don't know that you fellows
are getting sore, and are about to
repeat your U.C.L.A. performance.
They haven't seen you out at
practice the last couple of nights as
I have—tackling so viciously and
blocking so much harder than usual
that it i.s hard to recognize the team.
You fellows are getting sore, and
that's what makes a good football
team.
Football has never been a game
for promoting international friend
ships. and the madder you are—
especially against a team like
U.S.C.—the better you are going to

he. It doesn't make any differ
ence who you are sore at—whether j
it's yourselves or the Trojans, jnst
so you see those angry red fangs
you're going to play good ball.
If for no other reason you should
be. disgruntled because of the crit
icism Tiny is coming in for. "lie
doesn't teach them to tackle low,
<ii* block. He doesn't teach them
good plays." You hear this on all I
sides.
But you fellows know that that
isn't the coach's fault. Why, just last
j summer I saw a bunch of 12-year
old kids in a sandlot grid game tack- ;
j ling low. and even blocking very j
! well. Any American kid who got
i his training in the sandlots knows j
j innately how to tackle correctly.
And. as for the plays Tiny gives 1
you. it doesn't take deception to \
make a play work—it is just a ques- 1
tion of good, old-fashioned knock
'em-DOWN blocking.
I wouldn't be writing this if I
J didn't know that you fellows know
j how to do all these things, and that
' you have done them, as in that |
I U.C.L.A. game.
They don't give you a chance
against the Trojans. And I'll ad
mit I myself don't see how you're
: going to win. But I know, and I
think that they are going to find
| out, that Stanford can field a
pretty darn good football club,
j You are going to take a physical
! heating such as you've never
t-9 »
dreamed of, but I have a hunch
that the smug men of Troy are
; going to get one helluva beating
back from you.
All we here ask of you is this:
Don't repeat your performance of
i last Saturday. We don't care how
badly U.S.C. beats you, but if you
fellows put everything you've got
into the game, we'll be proud of
you. And if you stay in there pitch
ing and crashing to the very end,
you yourselves are going to feel a
lot better than you have of late.
And, by golly, you might win.
Yours sincerely,
JERRY MAYER

AN OI'EN LETTER TO THE STAN- |
FORI) FOOTBALL TEAM:
Today you fellows entrain for Los >
Angeles to play a game with U.S.C.
which not one person in a thousand
gives you a chance of winning. In i
the Southland, 1 understand, the bet
ting gentry is giving away as many I
as 18 points, plus substantial odds.
The reason for the Trojans being
favored is obvious —their outfit i
hasn't lost a game, you fellows have
n't won one. The nearest S.C. has j
come to a defeat is a tie, and the !
nearest you have come to victory |
is also a tie.
There are a lot of Stanford stu- |
dents who are looking askance at i
you. They didn't mind you losing I
to Santa Clara, a much better team,
but they don't think you should j
have been so badly overwhelmed
by the Broncos. A lot of these
Cardinal rooters don't think you
should have lost a couple of the
other games.
I've talked to a lot of you fel- |
lows, and it seems that your per- j
sonal opinions mirror those ex- j
pressed above. You have almost
unanimously admitted that you j
should have won a few of those
games, and that Santa Clara should
never have beaten us, 27-7.
Most of these critics seem to forget I
the U.C.L.A. game—another one in I
which you weren't given a chance, j
But that day you fellows were in j
the mood to play great football, and j
you did play great football. These |
critics don't know that you fellows
are getting sore, and are about to
repeat your U.C.L.A. performance.
They haven't seen you out at
practice the last couple of nights as
I have—tackling so viciously and
blocking so much harder than usual
that it i.s hard to recognize the team.
You fellows are getting sore, and
that's what makes a good football
team.
Football has never been a game
for promoting international friend
ships. and the madder you are—
especially against a team like
U.S.C.—the better you are going to

he. It doesn't make any differ
ence who you are sore at—whether j
it's yourselves or the Trojans, jnst
so you see those angry red fangs
you're going to play good ball.
If for no other reason you should
be. disgruntled because of the crit
icism Tiny is coming in for. "lie
doesn't teach them to tackle low,
<ii* block. He doesn't teach them
good plays." You hear this on all I
sides.
But you fellows know that that
isn't the coach's fault. Why, just last
j summer I saw a bunch of 12-year
old kids in a sandlot grid game tack- ;
j ling low. and even blocking very j
! well. Any American kid who got
i his training in the sandlots knows j
j innately how to tackle correctly.
And. as for the plays Tiny gives 1
you. it doesn't take deception to \
make a play work—it is just a ques- 1
tion of good, old-fashioned knock
'em-DOWN blocking.
I wouldn't be writing this if I
J didn't know that you fellows know
j how to do all these things, and that
' you have done them, as in that |
I U.C.L.A. game.
They don't give you a chance
against the Trojans. And I'll ad
mit I myself don't see how you're
: going to win. But I know, and I
think that they are going to find
| out, that Stanford can field a
pretty darn good football club,
j You are going to take a physical
! heating such as you've never
t-9 »
dreamed of, but I have a hunch
that the smug men of Troy are
; going to get one helluva beating
back from you.
All we here ask of you is this:
Don't repeat your performance of
i last Saturday. We don't care how
badly U.S.C. beats you, but if you
fellows put everything you've got
into the game, we'll be proud of
you. And if you stay in there pitch
ing and crashing to the very end,
you yourselves are going to feel a
lot better than you have of late.
And, by golly, you might win.

AN OI'EN LETTER TO THE STAN- |
FORI) FOOTBALL TEAM:
Today you fellows entrain for Los >
Angeles to play a game with U.S.C.
which not one person in a thousand
gives you a chance of winning. In i
the Southland, 1 understand, the bet
ting gentry is giving away as many I
as 18 points, plus substantial odds.
The reason for the Trojans being
favored is obvious —their outfit i
hasn't lost a game, you fellows have
n't won one. The nearest S.C. has j
come to a defeat is a tie, and the !
nearest you have come to victory |
is also a tie.
There are a lot of Stanford stu- |
dents who are looking askance at i
you. They didn't mind you losing I
to Santa Clara, a much better team,
but they don't think you should j
have been so badly overwhelmed
by the Broncos. A lot of these
Cardinal rooters don't think you
should have lost a couple of the
other games.
I've talked to a lot of you fel- |
lows, and it seems that your per- j
sonal opinions mirror those ex- j
pressed above. You have almost
unanimously admitted that you j
should have won a few of those
games, and that Santa Clara should
never have beaten us, 27-7.
Most of these critics seem to forget I
the U.C.L.A. game—another one in I
which you weren't given a chance, j
But that day you fellows were in j
the mood to play great football, and j
you did play great football. These |
critics don't know that you fellows
are getting sore, and are about to
repeat your U.C.L.A. performance.
They haven't seen you out at
practice the last couple of nights as
I have—tackling so viciously and
blocking so much harder than usual
that it i.s hard to recognize the team.
You fellows are getting sore, and
that's what makes a good football
team.
Football has never been a game
for promoting international friend
ships. and the madder you are—
especially against a team like
U.S.C.—the better you are going to

he. It doesn't make any differ
ence who you are sore at—whether j
it's yourselves or the Trojans, jnst
so you see those angry red fangs
you're going to play good ball.
If for no other reason you should
be. disgruntled because of the crit
icism Tiny is coming in for. "lie
doesn't teach them to tackle low,
<ii* block. He doesn't teach them
good plays." You hear this on all I
sides.
But you fellows know that that
isn't the coach's fault. Why, just last
j summer I saw a bunch of 12-year
old kids in a sandlot grid game tack- ;
j ling low. and even blocking very j
! well. Any American kid who got
i his training in the sandlots knows j
j innately how to tackle correctly.
And. as for the plays Tiny gives 1
you. it doesn't take deception to \
make a play work—it is just a ques- 1
tion of good, old-fashioned knock
'em-DOWN blocking.
I wouldn't be writing this if I
J didn't know that you fellows know
j how to do all these things, and that
' you have done them, as in that |
I U.C.L.A. game.
They don't give you a chance
against the Trojans. And I'll ad
mit I myself don't see how you're
: going to win. But I know, and I
think that they are going to find
| out, that Stanford can field a
pretty darn good football club,
j You are going to take a physical
! heating such as you've never
t-9 »
dreamed of, but I have a hunch
that the smug men of Troy are
; going to get one helluva beating
back from you.
All we here ask of you is this:
Don't repeat your performance of
i last Saturday. We don't care how
badly U.S.C. beats you, but if you
fellows put everything you've got
into the game, we'll be proud of
you. And if you stay in there pitch
ing and crashing to the very end,
you yourselves are going to feel a
lot better than you have of late.
And, by golly, you might win.
