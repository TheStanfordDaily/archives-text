# Frosh Gridders Srimmage For California Cub Tricks
## Shipkey Plans Defense for Twin Cub Threat, Jurkovich-Pickett 
### 
Coach Harry Shipkey gave bis freshman footballers a heavy dose of
California's offense in yesterday's practice session. He sent his reserves
against the first and second stringers, loaded with all sorts (if Bear Cub
trickery.
California's ofTcnse is built mainly around two crackerjack backs. Jim
Jurkovich and Gene Pickett. The former is a powerful plunging fullback

as well as a talented punter. At one,
halfback Pickett is dangerous for
his accurate southpaw passing as
well as his heavy running.
Frank Porto and Dan Watters, a
couple of speed merchants, alternate
at the halfback position, while hard
blocking Walt Gordon, a quarter
back, will probably get in the Pa
pooses' hair before the day is over.
Paced by Ernie Gentner, a strong
defensive center, Clint Evans' line
is a mighty powerful one. Twice
they stopped Troy's great freshman
team v/ithin the 10-yard line and
only yielded one touchdown to the
high-scoring Trobabes.
PAPOOSES MATCH CUBS
But the Papooses can match the
Cubs in every department of the
game. For plunging they have Milt
Vucinich, whose similarity to the
great Bobby Grayson goes beyond
the number 22 he carries on his back.
For deadly passing Shipkey has
little A1 Cole who has pitched two
touchdown passes in every game this
year except against U.C.L.A. when
he was injured. A1 also handles
punts from the safety position as well
as getting off a couple of hefty boots
himself per game.
For speed and deception there will
be Eric Armstrong and Red Robin
son on hand. Though Eric may only
be at half steam he is sure to be
effective.
Chuck Taylor Handles the rock
and sock blocking assignments as
well as packing the ball on quick
opening plays through center.
And that line is one that can take
care of itself. They have been scored
on only twice this season and both
times by those undeniable Trojans.
But one of the most important
factors in Saturday's battle with Cal
will be the revised Card attack.
Look for new plays galore and plenty
of razzle dazzle to be mixed in with
the smooth pass attack and straight
ahead power plays.
