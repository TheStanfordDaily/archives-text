# Indians Entrain for South To Face Trojans, 3-1 Odds
## Standlee Misses Final Scrimmage; Card Backs Toss Bull's-eye Passes 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Battering his receivers with bull's-eye passes. Frankie Albert led Stan
ford's varsity yesterday in a final scrimmage before the Southern California
| game Saturday. '
The Indian delegation—3o players, coaches, trainers, and managers—

leaves tonight at 9 o'clock.
Odds against Stanford winning
game are now 3-1, but odds have
been against Tiny's gang before on
jaunts to Los Angeles, and besides,
isn't this the underdog's year?
Although no one gives Stanford an
outside chance of slipping up on the
three-ply Trojans, there seems to |
be an air of doubt around the prac
tice field where sideline quarter- !
backs have watched the Card backs I
groove the air with passes.
TEAM TAKES IT EASY
With the ranks of the injured or i
hospitalized players totaling six, j
Tiny has held no scrimmage of any j
great proportions this week, fear- |
ing that he would have a squad of j
semi-cripples for Troy. For the third j
consecutive workout, Norm Stand- |
lee was absent from the fullback j
post. Whether he'll be recovered j
sufficiently from a cold to play a j
full game against the bone-crushing '
Trojan Herd is doubtful.
Pass scrimmages have been the j
bill for the past two nights. That I
itself is nothing new, since Thorn
hill has decided to capitalize on
Frankie Albert's throwing as a scor
ing threat. When Albert is not in
there he may have a new pitcher, i
Cookie South, who has yet to see
, action this season. South was moved
from right to left half this week.
SOUTH GETS HOT
South's ability to throw strikes has
1 been apparent in the two pass scrim
mages. Yesterday he was taking
over Granny Lansdell's quarterback
post when Husky Hunt put the third
j stringers against Tiny's varsity.
South's greatest forte is his decep
tion as to where he's going to pass
j the pigskin.
How far the Indians will go in re
| sorting to razzle-dazzle football —
which Tiny spoke of at the start of
j this week's practices—is not certain,
i However, if the Indians' signal-caller
; finds his ace plunger, Standlee,
i stopped, there'll be plenty of ball
| tossing — backward as well as for
! ward.
The travelling squad will be an
| nounced this morning. A light work
out will be held this afternoon, and a
j testing of the Coliseum turf will be
; on tap some time Friday.
