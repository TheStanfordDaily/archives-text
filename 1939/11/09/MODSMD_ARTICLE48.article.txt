Facing this proposition, the In
dians left today for the Southland
! to play the Bruins at 4 o'clock Friday
j afternoon, and the Trojans Saturday
| at 11 o'clock.
The situation was made more cru
-1 eial for the Indians by a pair of
I "doubtiuls." Coach Nort Thornton
\ has been forced to place Dave Not- >
tare on the second string due to a
cold.
The absence will cause a shift in
the line-up which places Bob Allen
in Nottage's forward spot, and steps
up Duncan Patty into Allen's cen
j terback post.
Nottage will make the trip, how
| ever. But Bill Burns, second-string
| goalie, may be kept out because of
a case of poison oak.
j Captain Bob Plate, Diek Hoover,
Ted Moreno, Frank Dowling, Bruce
' Jessup, Fred Manwaring, or Hadley
Bacon, and Allen, Bleecker and Patty
! will make the trip.

j goose of the locals, unless the Bruins
I in turn should be upset.
