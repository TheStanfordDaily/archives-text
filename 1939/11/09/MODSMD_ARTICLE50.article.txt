# The 						Annunciation

LIFE is a funny thing —especially if you are
the type that trusts people. You always
have to keep your guard up.
Take this fuss about ticket validation at the
U.S.C. game for example:
Remembering the trouble at the Los Angeles
Coliseum last year and its embarrassing after
math, Ex Committee two weeks ago asked the
B.A.C. what it intended to do about checking
student body cards next Saturday. And at the
same time it recommended that the Honor Code,
rather than inquisition methods, be used to
control the situation.
However, the B.A.C. cited facts and figures
which proved not only that a great many non-
Stanford students with borrowed cards tried to
crash the gates last year, but also that a huge
number, for whom tickets had been purchased,
did not attempt to use them when they learned
that a check-up would be made. Armed with
these statistics, the General Manager felt justi
fied in announcing that rooters' ducats would
be validated again this Saturday.
Then, out of the blue, yesterday came the
announcement that no check-up would be made
—and that the B.A.C. would depend on the
honor system.
This startling about-face will bear a little ex
amination:
No one could be credulous enough to believe
that an angel with a fiery sword dropped into
the B.A.C. bringing a message of revelation:
"The Honor Code is thrice blessed, and valida
tions are blessed scarcely at all."
No, that is hardly probable.
Perhaps, when the rooters' ticket window
closed with sales 300 below last year's figures,
the B.A.C. decided that the threat of a student
body card check-up had done its work. Maybe
it concluded that this year students had not
purchased tickets to send, along with A.S.S.U.
cards, to Los Angeles friends.
Possibly this was its decision.
Or perhaps it decided that working mainly
in the interests of the student body was the best
policy after all.
You guess.
