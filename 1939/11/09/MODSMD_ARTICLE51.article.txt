# Sans-Culottes at Stanford
## 
### 
A FEW years ago, the U.S.C. game meant a
sojourn in the Palo Alto jail for two fresh
men, the discomfort of tear gas and billy clubs
to others. To Palo Alto itself, and to the movie
houses, it meant an expensive riot, frayed
nerves, a blemished opinion of the University
across the tracks. And to Stanford it brought
nationwide publicity.
The damage to Stanford's reputation was out
of all proportion to the damage caused by the
riot itself. Actually, the disturbance was almost
farcical, the worst results being broken win
dows and tomato-smeared buildings. But the
police were called out, and the newspapers
loved it. They sensationalized the results of
unleashed enthusiasm, and the University, not
the freshmen, suffered.
Tonight the whole first and second acts of
this show will be given their annual repetition.
Pajamaed freshmen will parade down the Row
behind the fire department's shiniest equip
ment. They will gather in the Pavilion to
work themselves up to a frenzy of yelling and
singing, fitting prelude to the U.S.C. game.
They will march on Roble en masse and remain
to serenade the frosh women.
But they will not storm any theaters, or tear
any cop's trousers.
Instead, as it has each year since the riot,

the management of the theater, which was
damaged to the extent of $300 in 1936, will admit
the frosh to a free show, with a cordial welcome.
No storming, no riot in the streets, no sore
heads tomorrow. Is this the death of an old
tradition?
The rah-rah school of collegiana would be
wail the loss of a colorful activity, but they
would mourn alone. As has gone the frosh
soph mud fight, so also have disappeared the
costly Hallowe'enish aspects of the U.S.C. rally.
Mob action is no longer popular. A crowd of
unruly frosh bears too close a resemblance to
a gang of vigilante lynchers, a bunch of Fueh
rer-led sheep, to be even amusing.
Tonight's rally will not be dead because of
this restrictive attitude. On the contrary, it will
be fired up by the necessary imagination which
must be called upon to substitute intelligent en
thusiasm for former aimless destruction.
Five hundred freshmen in pajamas ought to
be raw material enough for a terrific spree.â€”
