JUMBO JUNIOR

'T'HERE is nothing intrinsically wrong with being a
Republican. It's a little outmoded in this day and
age perhaps, anywhere outside of Maine, Vermont,
and Palo Alto. But every American citizen has a
right to cherish the political ideals that he believes in,
even if it involves recognizing Alf Landon, the Kansas
Sunflower, as a standard bearer.
Ex Committee is setting a dangerous precedent in
allowing the Republicans to organize on the Stanford
Campus. Their action may pave the way for an
archists, nihilists, and moral rearmers to follow the
Republican lead. But Ex Committee is probably think
ing of political freedom, and so perhaps they are right.
Even the Republicans have their rights these days.
But some of us are hoping that the new-born Stan
ford Landonites will do nothing more injurious than
disseminating "the tenets of Republicanism." In order
to do this, however, our local anti-Democrats will
have to be superior to their state organization. Not
satisfied with "developing a conservative philosophy
among college students" the Young Republicans of
California are vowing to "commence a concerted drive
to eliminate radical and subversive influences in our
colleges."
* * # *
|Y / |Y mercy-killings friends and Hortense will no doubt
claim that I oppose the Republican drive as a
matter of self-defense. I hasten to assure them that
I have installed a lightning rod on my typewriter and
feel comparatively secure. Neither do I object to the
Republican opposition to subversive activities. But I
do wonder if their "concerted drive" is going to be
characterized by the ridiculous red-herring attitude
assumed by that all-American clown, Martin Dies.
Too often in the past "a drive against subversive
elements" has merely presaged an irrelevant cam
paign of abuse directed against anyone and anybody
who stands to the left of the Daughters of the Amer
ican Revolution, a position which can be very much
to the right indeed.
Previous anti-subversive attacks have been directed
at the President of the United States, Albert Einstein,
Frederick March, and Marion Anderson. Stanford has
been called a hot-bed of communism by the Hearst
press, a situation almost as funny as a Kiwanis Club
in Moscow. And of course all this has the delightful
effect of taking everyone's attention oft the important
issues of the times.
It is quite tx*ue that this charming form of polit
ical sleight-of-hand is not peculiar to Republicans,
Democrats, or to any other group. And very prob
ably Stanford's Republicans have no intention of in
vestigating non-existent revolutionary meetings in the
Union Cellar or mythical time-bombs in the Hoover
War Libe. But the Southern California Young Repub
licans sound very much as though the Dies Committee
were inspiring them with political hallucinations.
Their state paper is called the "Jumbo Junior." Let's
hope it hits something more profound to offer than
peanuts.

|Y / |Y mercy-killings friends and Hortense will no doubt
claim that I oppose the Republican drive as a
matter of self-defense. I hasten to assure them that
I have installed a lightning rod on my typewriter and
feel comparatively secure. Neither do I object to the
Republican opposition to subversive activities. But I
do wonder if their "concerted drive" is going to be
characterized by the ridiculous red-herring attitude
assumed by that all-American clown, Martin Dies.
Too often in the past "a drive against subversive
elements" has merely presaged an irrelevant cam
paign of abuse directed against anyone and anybody
who stands to the left of the Daughters of the Amer
ican Revolution, a position which can be very much
to the right indeed.
Previous anti-subversive attacks have been directed
at the President of the United States, Albert Einstein,
Frederick March, and Marion Anderson. Stanford has
been called a hot-bed of communism by the Hearst
press, a situation almost as funny as a Kiwanis Club
in Moscow. And of course all this has the delightful
effect of taking everyone's attention oft the important
issues of the times.
It is quite tx*ue that this charming form of polit
ical sleight-of-hand is not peculiar to Republicans,
Democrats, or to any other group. And very prob
ably Stanford's Republicans have no intention of in
vestigating non-existent revolutionary meetings in the
Union Cellar or mythical time-bombs in the Hoover
War Libe. But the Southern California Young Repub
licans sound very much as though the Dies Committee
were inspiring them with political hallucinations.
Their state paper is called the "Jumbo Junior." Let's
hope it hits something more profound to offer than
peanuts.

'T'HERE is nothing intrinsically wrong with being a
Republican. It's a little outmoded in this day and
age perhaps, anywhere outside of Maine, Vermont,
and Palo Alto. But every American citizen has a
right to cherish the political ideals that he believes in,
even if it involves recognizing Alf Landon, the Kansas
Sunflower, as a standard bearer.
Ex Committee is setting a dangerous precedent in
allowing the Republicans to organize on the Stanford
Campus. Their action may pave the way for an
archists, nihilists, and moral rearmers to follow the
Republican lead. But Ex Committee is probably think
ing of political freedom, and so perhaps they are right.
Even the Republicans have their rights these days.
But some of us are hoping that the new-born Stan
ford Landonites will do nothing more injurious than
disseminating "the tenets of Republicanism." In order
to do this, however, our local anti-Democrats will
have to be superior to their state organization. Not
satisfied with "developing a conservative philosophy
among college students" the Young Republicans of
California are vowing to "commence a concerted drive
to eliminate radical and subversive influences in our
colleges."
