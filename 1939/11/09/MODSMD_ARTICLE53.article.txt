TIIE SPHINX SPEAKS
EDITOR, SIR:
In re letters in yesterday's Daily answering my
comments concerning mercy killings, there must be a
lot of people in this school who don't understand
KRAZY KAT.
Pessimistically yours,

DONT GIVE IT A SECOND THOUGHT
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
If "Some Club Men" (authors of Monday's Cam
pus Opinion) would make the effort to look at the
copy of the Fraternity-Club Rushing Regulations they
would find at the bottom the signatures "Interclub
Council" and "Intcrfraternity Board of Control."
Their magnanimous desire to co-operate is super
fluous. No doubt they will be expected by Interclub
Council as well as by Intcrfraternity Council to ad
here to commitments already made through their own
representatives.

WARRIOR'S HUSBANDS?
TP HE EDITOR, SIR:
After sitting for three hours next to a null and
void men's rooting section, we are rather disgusted
with the Stanford lounge-lizai'ds. If ever there was a
"fair-weather" section, we have it. Perhaps the men
would prefer to wave pom-pons, and to let the women
do the yelling.
Let them exert their energies in constructive en
couragement rather than destructive criticism of the
team. We're tired of an entirely soprano rooting
section.

OUT OF THE CELLAR
'T'HE EDITOR. SIR:
We, the Sequoia Get-Out-of-the-Cellar Com
mittee, move that the official Sequoia song, "Power,"
be adopted for use by the rooting section to be sung
to the accompaniment of the band. We feel that this
is the only way to attain victory as evidenced by the
following:
A group of Sequoia rooters sitting together at the
Santa Clara game used the song. The first trial resulted
immediately in Standlee's 70-yard kick. Tine second
time was followed immediately by Albert's touchdown
pass.
We submit this motion as the only sure way to end
our losing streak
