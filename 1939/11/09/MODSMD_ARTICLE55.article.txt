# Marxian Invasion Provokes National Laugh Riot
## 
### 
"AT THE CIRCUS," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
If you arc a devotee of the Mainboucher-splitting type of humor, then
don't pass up this one, even if you do have an ex the next a.m.
In fact, even if you aren't accustomed to laughing yourself into a had
case of bends, see this latest bit of Marxian madhouse. It's high time you

learned to guffaw, while there's still*
something funny left in this world.
-Chico is there, playing the piano
(Beer Barrel Polka). Harpo makes
his harp- a living thing, filling the
theater with singing melody. And
Groucho—well, he deserves a para
graph of his own.
GROUCIIO AT THE BAR
The Groucho - croucho walk i
(mighty useful going down a steep j
hill), is demonstrated at its best. |
And Groucho's ofT-stage remarks to j
the audience are the prize gags of j
the picture. This time, he's a lawyer |
—"The Legal-Eagle"—and his she- j
nanigans as a member of the bar re- I
mind one of similar antics by mem- (
bers of another type of bar. He's j
terrific, especially when he walks on I
the ceiling.
All three of the Marxmen do a j
right fine job, although it must be I
admitted that the ". . . Circus" isn't j
up to those two killer - dillers j
". . . Opera," and "... Races."
PLOT IGNORED
The plot? What good is a plot !
when the Terrific Three are around?
In "Room Service," they were sub- !
jugated to plot, and the picture was
somewhat of a lemon, to put it
mildly. Yes, there's a wee bit of a
plot, but let's not worry about it, eh?
The boys are aided by Kenny
Baker and Florence Rice, who fur
nish the songs and the romance;
Margaret Dumont, an old Marx j
stand-by; Nat Pendleton, who is a
strong man, as usual; and a circus,
which isn't bad at all.

Also showing, "Television Spy.'
We havn't seen it, but we can guess
