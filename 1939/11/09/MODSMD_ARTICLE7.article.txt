SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8 (UP).—
The turmoil created in California by
a Ham and Eggs pension plan sub
sided only slightly tonight in spite
of the smashing defeat the $30 Ev
ery Thursday proposal suffered at
the polls.
With returns indicating the ini
tiative was turned down by approxi
mately one million votes, pension
seekers, disappointed for the second
straight year, planned two new
campaigns.
The most immediate was a move
ment to recall Governor Culbert
Olson, once considered the Ham
and-Eggers best friend and now
classed among their enemies because
he fought the proposal this year.
The second was to circulate other
petitions seeking to place the plan
on the ballot again in 1940 under the
initiative and referendum act.
With returns in from 11,002 of the
state's 11,209 precincts, the vote
stood at 972,307 for Ham and Eggs,
1,877,832 against it;.
Four other propositions were on
the ballot. The vote on these in
11,002 precincts was:
No. 2, Chiropractors Initiative:
yes, 706,138; no, 1,831,482.
No. 3, Small Loans: yes, 1,795,88;
no. 722,324.
No. 4, Small Loans: yes, 1,802,208;
no, 707,900.
No. 5, Petroleum: yes, 1,073,195;
no, 1,716,936.
There were reports recall petitions
were started in circulation during
the day by leaders of the California
Life Retirement. Payments Associa
tion. sponsors of the pain on which
California voted in record numbers
yesterday.
The organization must obtain 318,-
176 signatures —12 per cent of the
vote cast in the last, general election
for governor—to force an election on
the recall of Olson and the selection
of a successor.
