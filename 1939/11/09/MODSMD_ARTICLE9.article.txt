# Food Economy Researchers Pile Statistics

### BUD AMES 
1 Food Research Institute — yes,
Stanford has one of those too, but
j you probably missed it tucked away
i in the southeast corner of the inner
quad. And there isn't a carbohydrate
I of food in the department; nothing
but piles and files and files of peri
j odicals.
"Our research is not concerned
with nutrition," Merrill K. Bennett,
i secretary of the department, ex
! plained yesterday. "This is not an
experimental laboratory. The train
i ing of our staff members is in eco-
I nomics and we are concerned pri
marily with research on economics
j of foodstuffs and on agriculture, par-
I ticularly the international aspects.
EMPHASIZES ECONOMY
1 In the proverbial nutshell, the
1 Institute is tiling and compiling a
j comprehensive body of significant
knowledge concerning food produc
j tion, trade, consumption, and prices,
i with the chief emphasis laid on eco
' nomic aspects of food problems.
And what do they use those filed
j periodicals for? For research ob
i viously. Mr. Bennett can produce
| fifteen crammed typewritten pages
!of periodicals which are received
j regularly by the Institute. These
periodicals are stored away in their
! proper corner for future use. Hence
I the piles.
ESTABLISHED IN 1!>2I
On the historic side, it can be said
that the Institute was established on
I the Farm in 1921 jointly by the
Trustees of the University and the
; Carnegie Corporation of New York.
1 It is an integral part of the Univer
-1 sity, devoted primarily to research
but also providing some instruction
as well as research guidance for ad
vanced students.
Yes, the Institute gives a few
courses to both graduates and un
dergraduates, but the emphasis is
on the graduate work. The Institute
is affiliated with the School of So
cial Sciences, and gives instruction
to about 50 students during an aca
demic year.
Nucleus of the Institute is a staff
of six men and women, headed by
Director Joseph,.S. Davis. Backing
this staff are nine secretaries, sta
tistical assistants and draftsmen who
assist in the seeking and peeking
into thise periodicals in search of
facts.
Research must lead to some con
clusion, and the fruits of the Insti
tute's quests into the economic world
blossom forth every year in the
form of five different types of pub
lications:
(1) Eight Wheat Studies a year,
(2) Edible Fats and Oils Studies, (3)
Grain Economics Series, (4) Miscel
laneous Series, and (5) a great deal
of work for professional journals.
"A large part of our work here is
preparing and giving papers for pro

fessional meetings. These papers ai*'
usually later published," Mr. Ben
nett explained, pushing across the
de.sk a printed pamphlet listing about
125 contributions by the Institute to
books and professional journals.
CONCERNS WHEAT
"You may wonder why so much of
our work is concerned with wheat,"
Mr. Bennett went on. "Well, we are
just using wheat as a focus of in
terest through which to look at the
general economic situation. Wheat
is the most important foodstuff of the
Western world.
"It's in a dynamic situation. No
sooner does it do one thing than it
does another. Hence the number of
publications on wheat."
He swept his arm around the
room, taking in the files and piles of
publications and periodicals.

ESTABLISHED IN 1!>2I
On the historic side, it can be said
that the Institute was established on
I the Farm in 1921 jointly by the
Trustees of the University and the
; Carnegie Corporation of New York.
1 It is an integral part of the Univer
-1 sity, devoted primarily to research
but also providing some instruction
as well as research guidance for ad
vanced students.
Yes, the Institute gives a few
courses to both graduates and un
dergraduates, but the emphasis is
on the graduate work. The Institute
is affiliated with the School of So
cial Sciences, and gives instruction
to about 50 students during an aca
demic year.
Nucleus of the Institute is a staff
of six men and women, headed by
Director Joseph,.S. Davis. Backing
this staff are nine secretaries, sta
tistical assistants and draftsmen who
assist in the seeking and peeking
into thise periodicals in search of
facts.
Research must lead to some con
clusion, and the fruits of the Insti
tute's quests into the economic world
blossom forth every year in the
form of five different types of pub
lications:
(1) Eight Wheat Studies a year,
(2) Edible Fats and Oils Studies, (3)
Grain Economics Series, (4) Miscel
laneous Series, and (5) a great deal
of work for professional journals.
"A large part of our work here is
preparing and giving papers for pro

fessional meetings. These papers ai*'
usually later published," Mr. Ben
nett explained, pushing across the
de.sk a printed pamphlet listing about
125 contributions by the Institute to
books and professional journals.
CONCERNS WHEAT
"You may wonder why so much of
our work is concerned with wheat,"
Mr. Bennett went on. "Well, we are
just using wheat as a focus of in
terest through which to look at the
general economic situation. Wheat
is the most important foodstuff of the
Western world.
"It's in a dynamic situation. No
sooner does it do one thing than it
does another. Hence the number of
publications on wheat."
He swept his arm around the
room, taking in the files and piles of
publications and periodicals.
