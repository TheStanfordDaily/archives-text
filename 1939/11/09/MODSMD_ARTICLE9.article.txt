# Food Economy Researchers Pile Statistics

### BUD AMES 
1 Food Research Institute — yes,
Stanford has one of those too, but
j you probably missed it tucked away
i in the southeast corner of the inner
quad. And there isn't a carbohydrate
I of food in the department; nothing
but piles and files and files of peri
j odicals.
"Our research is not concerned
with nutrition," Merrill K. Bennett,
i secretary of the department, ex
! plained yesterday. "This is not an
experimental laboratory. The train
i ing of our staff members is in eco-
I nomics and we are concerned pri
marily with research on economics
j of foodstuffs and on agriculture, par-
I ticularly the international aspects.
EMPHASIZES ECONOMY
1 In the proverbial nutshell, the
1 Institute is tiling and compiling a
j comprehensive body of significant
knowledge concerning food produc
j tion, trade, consumption, and prices,
i with the chief emphasis laid on eco
' nomic aspects of food problems.
And what do they use those filed
j periodicals for? For research ob
i viously. Mr. Bennett can produce
| fifteen crammed typewritten pages
!of periodicals which are received
j regularly by the Institute. These
periodicals are stored away in their
! proper corner for future use. Hence
I the piles.
ESTABLISHED IN 1!>2I
On the historic side, it can be said
that the Institute was established on
I the Farm in 1921 jointly by the
Trustees of the University and the
; Carnegie Corporation of New York.
1 It is an integral part of the Univer
-1 sity, devoted primarily to research
but also providing some instruction
as well as research guidance for ad
vanced students.
