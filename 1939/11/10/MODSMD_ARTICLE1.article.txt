### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
IF THE key to European peace lies
in the hands of Adolf Hitler, the
key to cessation of labor hostilities
in America lies in the hands of
C.1.0. President John L. Lewis.
President Roosevelt's latest move
for labor peace came yesterday when
|he summoned Lewis and A.F.L,
President William Green to the
White House for separate confer
ences today. The scene was vaguely
reminiscent of last April, for it was
the first time Roosevelt has brought
the full prestige of his office to bear
for the goal of working men's unity
since last spring.

And, while the nations of Eu
rope shagged shells and bullets at
each other across their steel and
barbwire back fences, the labor
chieftains of America refused to
behave like polite children.
While President Roosevelt was in
tent on forming a solid, peaceful
labor front in America, a rift-free
basis against any possible "even
tuality" in Europe, Lewis was un
compromising.
Green answered that the A.F.L.
peace committee was ready and
willing to resume talks whenever
the C.1.0. committee is ready. And,
apparently, the C.1.0. is far from
ready to do any definite negotiat
ing. At any rate, Lewis refused to
tell reporters what answer, if any,
he had given Mr. Roosevelt. He
said any statement must come from
the White House.

A LTHOUGH Lewis smiled broad
ly—as Lewis can so well—and
parried quips with newsmen when
he left the White House yesterday,
he cut them short when they told
him Green had revealed Mr. Roose
velt's bid for renewal of peace con
ferences.
"That's characteristic of Mr.
Green to talk like that," he
snapped.
Asked if there was likelihood the
C.1.0. peace committee, composed of
himself and Vice-President Philip
Murray and Sidney Hillman, would
meet in the next few days, Lewis
replied:
"Don't bet your money on that."
He did say, however, that no defi
nite date had been set for resum
ing the peace talks. That did not
necessarily mean that talks might
not be resumed soon.
* * #
pROSPECTS for resumption of
the deliberations were buoyed
by the reluctance both sides have
shown in the past to court public
disfavor by allowing themselves to
be placed in a position of refusing
to compromise the dispute.
Both organizations have peace
committees which are empowered to
act by resolution of their conventions
last month. The A.F.L. committee
consists of Vice-Presidents Harry
Bates, Matthew Woll, Daniel J.
Tobin and Thomas A. Riekert.

Mr. Roosevelt sent messages to
both the A.F.L. and C.1.0. in Oc
tober asking them to continue ne
gotiations begun last March and
suspended in April, and congratu
lating them upon "the substantial
progress made."
The A.F.L. responded wtih an ex
pression of willingness to continue
the negotiations which were broken
off because Lewis and Murray were
engaged in coal contract negotia
tions in New York and because of
Congressional hearings on proposed
Wagner Act amendments, a question
on which the two groups are di
vided.
The C.1.0.'s public response was a
brief resolution by its San Francisco
convention which continued the
peace committee and authorized it
"to exercise its discretion in any fu
ture negotiations."
