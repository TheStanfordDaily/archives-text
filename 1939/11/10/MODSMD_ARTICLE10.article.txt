# Poor Direction Causes Carroll Drama to Miss
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Three things are necessary for a
hit show:
A good play, good actors, and good
direction. It is possible to get away
with a bad play if the acting and
direction are good enough to hide it.
Or, a good play and good direction
can sometimes hide the fact lhat the
actors are only adequate. But, no
matter how good the players and
play are, they cannot succeed with
out direction.
It was the direction that was lack
ing in yesterday's matinee produc
tion of "Shadow and Substance,"
given for the Stanford Mothers'
Club. And no doubt this will be
remedied before tonight's perform
ance.
FAITII ENDS CONFLICT
There were several excellent per
formances in the play, and certainly
there's no question about the worth
of Paul Vincent Carroll's "Shadow
and Substance." What these two
need in the Farm's production, is in
tegration, timing, and polish to make
the whole thing a thoroughly satis
factory show.
Basically the plot of "Shadow and
Substance" is simple—tlie story of a
cold intellectual Canon and a rad
ical school master, who are brought
back to fundamental religion by the
burning faith of a simple servant
girl. It is in brilliant dialogue and
thought-provoking overtones that
the play's power lies.
ACTING WELL DONE
In the role of Canon Skerrit,
Richard Glyer had a field day. The
Canon Ls in every scene, and there
are few scenes he cannot dominate.
Because the part is so good, there
may be a tendency for the actor
playing it to overshadow the rest of
the characters.
Glyer was guilty of this in sev
eral scenes. There is no doubt that
he was good, but he did not help

\
he play as a whole.
Mildred Green brought everything
necessary to the part of Brigid and
.t was a difficult thing lo do. She
was fragile, yet intense, and her
scenes with Glyer got the tribute of
absolute and breathless silence from
the audience.
Third member of the starring trio
was Philip Harris, who played the
.schoolmaster with fire and under
standing. He was a perfect comple
ment to Glyer's Canon, and his
tender scenes with Brigid were han
dled skillfully.
Robert Ridgeway did well with
the obsequious schoolmaster's part,
and Jean Pennington was outstand
ing in her bit as the full-blown pub
lican's wile.
As a matter of fact, there were no
bad performances, and many good
ones. As seen yesterday, the play
was potentially excellent. With
chances for two more rehearsals be
tween now and tonight's and Sat
urday's performances, it has a
chance to be actually excellent.
Whether or not it is rests with Di
rector Everett Glass.

back to fundamental religion by the
burning faith of a simple servant
girl. It is in brilliant dialogue and
thought-provoking overtones that
the play's power lies.
ACTING WELL DONE
In the role of Canon Skerrit,
Richard Glyer had a field day. The
Canon Ls in every scene, and there
are few scenes he cannot dominate.
Because the part is so good, there
may be a tendency for the actor
playing it to overshadow the rest of
the characters.
Glyer was guilty of this in sev
eral scenes. There is no doubt that
he was good, but he did not help

\
he play as a whole.
Mildred Green brought everything
necessary to the part of Brigid and
.t was a difficult thing lo do. She
was fragile, yet intense, and her
scenes with Glyer got the tribute of
absolute and breathless silence from
the audience.
Third member of the starring trio
was Philip Harris, who played the
.schoolmaster with fire and under
standing. He was a perfect comple
ment to Glyer's Canon, and his
tender scenes with Brigid were han
dled skillfully.
Robert Ridgeway did well with
the obsequious schoolmaster's part,
and Jean Pennington was outstand
ing in her bit as the full-blown pub
lican's wile.
As a matter of fact, there were no
bad performances, and many good
ones. As seen yesterday, the play
was potentially excellent. With
chances for two more rehearsals be
tween now and tonight's and Sat
urday's performances, it has a
chance to be actually excellent.
Whether or not it is rests with Di
rector Everett Glass.
Three things are necessary for a
hit show:
A good play, good actors, and good
direction. It is possible to get away
with a bad play if the acting and
direction are good enough to hide it.
Or, a good play and good direction
can sometimes hide the fact lhat the
actors are only adequate. But, no
matter how good the players and
play are, they cannot succeed with
out direction.
It was the direction that was lack
ing in yesterday's matinee produc
tion of "Shadow and Substance,"
given for the Stanford Mothers'
Club. And no doubt this will be
remedied before tonight's perform
ance.
FAITII ENDS CONFLICT
There were several excellent per
formances in the play, and certainly
there's no question about the worth
of Paul Vincent Carroll's "Shadow
and Substance." What these two
need in the Farm's production, is in
tegration, timing, and polish to make
the whole thing a thoroughly satis
factory show.
Basically the plot of "Shadow and
Substance" is simple—tlie story of a
cold intellectual Canon and a rad
ical school master, who are brought
back to fundamental religion by the
burning faith of a simple servant
girl. It is in brilliant dialogue and
thought-provoking overtones that
the play's power lies.
