# Rooters Desert Farm for Southland
## Special Trains to Leave Paly for South Tonight As 900 Plan to See Game Score-Hungry Gridders Seek Trojan Upset 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
If there are to be any major foot
ball upsets tomorrow, it might be a
good idea to look for Stanford's
name in the win column.
Down in Los Angeles for the an
nual Trojan grid battle, 40 Indian
footballers are poking around the
Coliseum turf today looking for the
four-leaf clover which might make
them the luckiest eleven in the
nation.
About 1000 Stanford students and
50,000 fans are expected to watch
one of the long-standing Pacific
Coast Conference grudge battles at 2
o'clock tomorrow.
ODDS FAVOR TROY
There may be something in the
four-leaf clover idea. Not since 1931,
when El Trojan beat Stanford, 19-0,
has the Farm taken a licking from a
Howard Jones team in the Coli
seum. The Vowing Sophs won in
1933 and 1935 —the latter on a field
goal by Monk Moscrip. In 1937 iho
underdog Indians played the touted
Trojans to a standstill and won, 7-6.
If Stanford has any idea about
winning its first game of the season
tomorrow, they've picked the team
to do it against. Odds favor the
Thundering Herd by 3-1 or better.
Troy in four games has the best, of
fensive record on Ihe Coast with 79
points. Its powerful line has been
scored against but twice.
FARM HAS POOR RECORD
Stanford has a non-too-auspicious
looking record what with four de
feats and a tie. While scoring 26
points, our Indians' opponents have
filtered through the Stanford for
ward wall and through the air lanes
to run up 71 points —27 by Santa
Clara last week.
Upon the shoulders of just about
11 men will hinge the chances of the
Cardinal band to topple Southern
California. Hardly more than one
full team can be counted upon to
hold off the three-deep Trojans.
It will mainly be the pitting of
Norm "Big Chief" Standlee and
Frankie Albert against Granny Lans
dell and Bobby Peoples. The chances
of the two Indian mainstays to do any
amount of damage rests upon how
well their line blocks and charges
for them.
Troy, not weighted down by a lack
of capable subs, has a line stackcd
knee-deep in replacements. Against
Stanford's Graff, Andersen, Pool,
Verdieck, Patterson, Trout, and
Stojkovich, Coach Howard Jones
has Winslow, Gaspar, Sohn, Demp
soy, Smith. Stoecker, and Fi.sk. Be
sides those behemoths the Head Man
has Stonebraker, Thomassin, Phil
lips, Atanasofl, Kalinich, LeLauer,
and Krueger to run in as First Team
No. 2.
PASSES MAY CLICK
It" those lines stymie our Indians,
it will he left to Albert's left-handed
slants to wing the locals to the
Trojan goal. Albert completed a 60-
yard beauty to Hugh Gallarneau for
a touchdown against Santa Clai'a
and another to Stan Graff tor 35
yards.
If things really come to worse lor
Standlee and C< mpany, and if the
Indians get their hands on the ball
long enough at a time, there may be
a considerable bit of that "crazy"
football which struck the football
camp this week in practice. That'll
mean laterals both behind scrim
mage and downfield.
Titiy's starting backfield with Al
bert and Standlee will be Gene Cold
iron, now No. 1 quarterback in his
own right with Pool back in the line,
and probably Jim Groves. However,
it'll be a pony backfield of no mean
proportions if Pete Kmotovic gets
in there a) right half and Albert
starts throwing strikes at the little
speedster.
GRAFF, STOJKOVICII SET
Graff and Stojkovich still have a
monopoly on the flanks, but the
chances of their getting much help
from Bill Greer and Fred Meyer is
nil — both sporting injured knees
and ankles.
Stan Andersen will be acting cap
tain and left tackle at whom the
Herd will throw most of their power
plays. With Hamp Pool back at left
guard, he should form quite a bul
wark in trying to stop Lansdell,
Peoples, Nave, Schindler, and subs.
Jim Verdieck will play center and
back up the line. Dave Patterson
and Eiil Trout or John McDonough
at riht guard and tackle have the
thankless job of hooking up with
All-American guard Harry Smith.
