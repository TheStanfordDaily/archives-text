# Rooters Desert Farm for Southland
## Special Trains to Leave Paly for South Tonight As 900 Plan to See Game Score-Hungry Gridders Seek Trojan Upset 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
If there are to be any major foot
ball upsets tomorrow, it might be a
good idea to look for Stanford's
name in the win column.
Down in Los Angeles for the an
nual Trojan grid battle, 40 Indian
footballers are poking around the
Coliseum turf today looking for the
four-leaf clover which might make
them the luckiest eleven in the
nation.
About 1000 Stanford students and
50,000 fans are expected to watch
one of the long-standing Pacific
Coast Conference grudge battles at 2
o'clock tomorrow.
ODDS FAVOR TROY
There may be something in the
four-leaf clover idea. Not since 1931,
when El Trojan beat Stanford, 19-0,
has the Farm taken a licking from a
Howard Jones team in the Coli
seum. The Vowing Sophs won in
1933 and 1935 —the latter on a field
goal by Monk Moscrip. In 1937 iho
underdog Indians played the touted
Trojans to a standstill and won, 7-6.
If Stanford has any idea about
winning its first game of the season
tomorrow, they've picked the team
to do it against. Odds favor the
Thundering Herd by 3-1 or better.
Troy in four games has the best, of
fensive record on Ihe Coast with 79
points. Its powerful line has been
scored against but twice.
FARM HAS POOR RECORD
Stanford has a non-too-auspicious
looking record what with four de
feats and a tie. While scoring 26
points, our Indians' opponents have
filtered through the Stanford for
ward wall and through the air lanes
to run up 71 points —27 by Santa
Clara last week.
Upon the shoulders of just about
11 men will hinge the chances of the
Cardinal band to topple Southern
California. Hardly more than one
full team can be counted upon to
hold off the three-deep Trojans.
It will mainly be the pitting of
Norm "Big Chief" Standlee and
Frankie Albert against Granny Lans
dell and Bobby Peoples. The chances
of the two Indian mainstays to do any
amount of damage rests upon how
well their line blocks and charges
for them.
Troy, not weighted down by a lack
of capable subs, has a line stackcd
knee-deep in replacements. Against
Stanford's Graff, Andersen, Pool,
Verdieck, Patterson, Trout, and
Stojkovich, Coach Howard Jones
has Winslow, Gaspar, Sohn, Demp
