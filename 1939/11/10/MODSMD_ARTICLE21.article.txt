# Hitler Wants To Stop War; Says Rowell
## Chronicle Columnist Likes Neutrality Bill; Hints Allies Will Win 
### 
"It's a crazy world, and the only j
explanation of what goes on in it
is Mi. t 'they are crazy'," Chester j
Rowell, former editor of the San
IV. uei.Mjo Chronicle, told the Inter
national Relations Society at a meet
in.'. in the Education auditorium last |
night.
i :plaining that the world is mov
it <> last that any subject is out- ,
dat (i it' announced even a day ahead
ol time, Rowell said he would speak j
on "The World as it Is November 9'
and even then he wasn't sure. |
Hitler would now pay any price, j
Rowell believes, to get out of the '
war which he never expected to j
light -except the only price he can!
pay, either righting the wrongs he i
has done or submitting to an all- j
Ell ropean conference.
Congress has recently declared a J
policy relinquishing international
lights over which it has fought two ;
wars previously, Rowell said. He '
himself heartily supported the adop- j
lion of the Neutrality Bill because |
he believed it the best possible !
compromise under the circumstances.
NOT REAL ANSWER
However, he feels that for us, the j
most powerful neutral nation in the ;
world, to renounce our rights on the I
high seas to anyone who orders us
off, will never tend to the eventual
establishment of a sensible policy!
<ii international commerce.
We cannot forever adhere to the |
! rotection of a Chinese wall, he j
declared. The Chinese are now tear- i
it down the walls around their
cities, he explained, since these do
not resist Japanese artillery. The
Japanese blow a hole in the walls,
march in, repair the walls, and then
the Chinese cannot get them out !
aMa n. We will" only learn the futility i
of a Chinese wall policy, Rowell de- :
d 'd, by tragic experience.
Before the recent beer-hall bomb- I
ing he had not foreseen any possi- j
bility of a conservative revolution in
C rmany. He feels there is a slight j
chance now, in which event Europe ]
mi ht find solution in some sort of a I
commonwealth of states.
AMERICA PREJUDICED
II the present war continues until i
Germany's inevitable exhaustion,
■■■ell's contention is that a radical j
rev >!ution will follow, in which case I
<i' i many's relation to Russia's "state j
capitalism" can be only speculated )
upon.
in the world chaos which would j
M bl\ follow, Rowell wonders
whether or not America has grown '
ten rich, lazy and frozen with preju- \
nice (which were truths in the 18th j
and 19th centuries but mean nothing j
now) to keep its head.
tn case of a European common- !
v t'alth of states, Rowell said, the
t S. must either participate or it j
will have done its part to bring about j
inevitable world anarchy. America I
n. iv desire isolation, he declared, |
iml "What we want has nothing to j
do with the case, and although it |
m have more to do with what we I
do. u won't alter the consequences." j
