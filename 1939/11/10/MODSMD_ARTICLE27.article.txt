### 
HUH LIN, Friday, Nov. 10 (UP). —The bomb-wrecked lJuergerbraeu j
beer cellar in Munich where Adolf Hitler escaped an assassination attempt {
by 1!( minutes Wednesday night has yielded "most important clues" tend- j
ing id link the plot with a foreign country, according to an olliclal an j
nounrcnunt earlj today.
£'ii! -i , own newspaper, the Voelkischer Beobachter. accused British
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of paving the way for the plotters to

arr. ngc for the bomb
which took the lives of seven per-J
sons ;.nd injured 63 in the shrine
and birthplace of Naziism.
"NOW WE KNOW . . ."
"Now we understand the real sig
nificance of the Prime Minister's
words when he said in Parliament at j
the win's beginning, 'I hope to live j
to see the day on which Hitler will !
be destroyed'," said the Chancellor's
paper. "These words . . . revealed
Ihe final purpose of the bomb in the I
Munich Buei berbraeu.
"Those are the British methods —
but God Almighty is against them!"
A nation-wide round-up of sus
pects was under way and the Nazi
press, in high wrath, threatened a
purge of "criminals and agents of
foreign countries.'
The reward for information lead
ing to solution of the crime rose to
$360,000 when the government of
fered an additional $120,000 in for
eign exchange to any person abroad
who could put it. on the trail of the
actual bomb plotters.
REICH'S JEWS FEARFUL
The Greater Reich's 700,000 Jews
were fearful they might suffer from
Nazi wrath over the attempt on Hit
ler's life because some sections of
the press blamed the plot on "Jewish
instigators." Jews in Vienna sought
poiice protection.
There were no indications, how- j
ever, Jews had been singled out for |
arrest.
It was a year ago this morning—
about 2 a.m.—that Germany's worst
anti-Semitic campaign of violence
was unleashed in reprisal for the
slaying of Ernst Vom Rath, young
German diplomat, by a 17-year-old
Polish Jew, Iferschel V. Grynszpan.
Today the Jews still are struggling
to pay a $400,000,000 fine levied
against, them for that assassination.
HIMMI.ER FOLLOWS TRAIL
Ifeinrich Himmler, chief of the
Nazi secret police, announced the
trail to the origin of the plot "leads
to a foreign country" and a second
announcement shortly after mid
night told of clues obtained in Mu
nich. win re several hundred sus
pects have been taken into cus
tody.
The official news agency said the
.duuich clues established a median- I
ieal time bomb wrecked the place at
the moment when Hitler, had he ad- I
lie red to his usual schedule, would '
have been in Ihe midst of his speech j
io ti io old L;uard Nazis of his abortive '
1923 putsch.

the high-ranking Nazis who accom-I
panied him escaped the assassina- I
