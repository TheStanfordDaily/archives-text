# Netherlands Set Defense For invasion
## Dutch Fear German Attack after Border Clash Kills Citizen 
### United Press 
A shooting affray in which a Dutch
citizen was killed and several Dutch- i
men were "kidnaped" and dragged
into Germany occurred Thursday
along the Dutch-German frontier,
and the Netherlands government
prepared to resist possible invasions l
by the Nazi war machine.
There were fast-developing indi
cations that the lowland nation of
Queen Wilhelmina, which succeeded
in keeping out of the World War,
might be dragged into this one.
The border clash occurred near the
medieval fortress town of Venlo
within sight of Germany's west wall
fortifications and was reminiscent of
the frontier clashes in the days pre
ceding Germany's mop-ups of Cze
choslovakia and Poland.
CANCEL FURLOUGHS
Shortly after the clash involving
German and Dutch civilians and
frontier guards, all Netherlands
army furloughs were canceled and
soldiers on leave were ordered to be
back at their garrisons this morning.
The Netherlands throughout the
night struggled for an amicable set
tlement of the clash, as was shown
by the fact that Dutch newspapers
were instructed to publish no do
tails of the incident.
Belgium too was taking urgent
military measures. The nation of
King Leopold 111 had 600,000 men
under arms last nightâ€”more than
Britain had under arms when the
war broke out.
FEAR ATTACK
Both Belgium and the Nether
lands have realized the day might
come when Adolf Hitler would send
his motorized armies smashing
across their lowlands to strike a
flanking blow at France's $500,000
Maginot Line somewhere near the
English Channel coast.
They have laid plans to open their
dykes and flood the lowlands, built
tank traps and other barriers and
placed their frontier zones under
state of siege.
Large forces of German troops
and mobile units were reported
massing along the Netherlands bor
der. London reported Nazi cavalry
moving up to the Dutch border.
Paris told of shock troops massing
in the area.
HITLER THREAT RUMORED
Reports persisted that Hitler had
seived a threat or an ultimatum on
the two small countries, particularly
Holland, in order to obtain a spring
board for cither a land attack on
the western front or full-force air
raids against the British Isles. Ger
many, like the Netherlands, denied
any threat had been made.
Germany has formally pledged her
respect for the neutrality of Belgium
and the Netherlands, as have Brit
ain and France, but in recent days
the Reich charged the Dutch with
jeopardizing neutrality themselves
by "submitting'' to Britain's naval
blockade of the Reich.
On the western front itself the
Germans continued a series of "feeler
thrusts" which French military ex
perts believed might be the prelude
to a major attack, perhaps a swift
assault by German divisions which
probably would produce at least
temporary gains.
