It took newly elected Captain Stan
| Andersen to really resurrect the
true Stanford spirit when he started

Andersen continued his speech
pointing to his teammates and said
that it was the finest team he had
j ever played with and the "finest
i bunch of fellows." "We haven"t
been able to click yet this season,
■ but in Saturday's game we hope to

Former A.S.S.U. President H. B.
I (Beebs) Lee gave the main address
of the evening and emphasized the
