## Card Yearlings Plan Land and Air Attack On cal in Little Big Game; Al Cole Back in Indians' Line-up 
### CHUCK SMITH 
1 lie zero for about -J.'! conscientious Stanford freshman football squad
members is almost at hand. That kickofY tomorrow at 3 o'clock against'
I alilorn;:i s Irosh grid team is a moment for which these hoys have been
waiting and working hard toward since early in September.
And now (hat it is almost hce, just what does it mean to these «i-i»l
-dels.' in the (irsl place it will be the winning of numeral awards for

the second place it means (it) minute.'
of rough and tough football against a
mighty good team.
The Card yearlings can and should
make three in a row for Shipkey
coached teams by turning back the
Cubs tomorrow. Last year it was the
Mill potent passing arm of Frankie
Albert which brought the Card
yearlings through to victory. The
year before that the hard running
oi Norm Standlee and Thor Peter
son ended a 13-year famine for the
Stanford yearlings with a 13-0 win
over Cal.
COACH EXPECTS VICTORY
Tomorrow Shipkey will depend
Upon the combined best features of
these teafns of the past a deadly
passing arm and a couple of hard
running backs—for a victory.
A1 Cole will be the Frankie Al
bert of this year's team. A1 has
already winged eight touchdown
passes this year and is tlie main
reason for the success of Shipkey's
smooth passing attack. Tomorrow
lie II he back in there pitching alter
a slight injury and will throw
plenty ol scare passes down the
middle and into the flat.
The hard-running backs who will
make yardage through the middle
when Cole's passing arm is resting
are Milt Vucinich and Red Robin
son. Milt, from his l'uliback position,
has run up hundreds of yards this
year on his delayed bucks into the
line a la Grayson. Milt fakes a pass,
drifts a few yards to either the right
or leit, and then lowers the old
boom for yardage.
ROBINSON AT HALF
Robinson will operate tit right half i
in place of the injured Eric Arm
strong. Double reverses are his
strongest play and the former team 1
mate of Ucia s great Jack Robinson !
will do his share of mail carrying
tomorrow.
Chuck Taylor, the fourth member
ol the baek'ield, is a line backer and
blocker de luxe and occasionally !
Carrii on quarterback sneaks.
Towering Bill Mannon will help
Taylor back up the line from his
center position and will be depended j
upon to slap down Cal's ace ball !
earners, Jurkovich and Pickett,!
should they happen to poke their .
noses through the Card line.
( VuJ) Gl \KI)S STRONG
But a couple of guards from Okla
homa will have to be reckoned with
before any Cal back gets through
that lines. Ihey are Cd McCain,
who leads the interference on of- ,
fense, and rugged Dick Palmer.
Most ol Cal's power plays are di
rected of! tackle but the ball packers
will find an efficient welcoming 1
committee at this position also. The
.starting tackles will be 200-pound
13runo Banducci and Roger Laverty, '
who has fought his way into the first -
.string lineup.
The two starting ends, Dill Symcs i
and Ed Stamm, are all that good
ends should be—-rugged to stop end
sweeps, fast for punt coverage and
tall lor pass snagging. Shipkey will
sorely miss Hank Norberg, a truly
great end. who definitely will not '
be able to play because of a lee '

injury.
KKSKKYKS STRONG
One of the outstandingly strong
features of Shipkoy'.s team this year
ha; been its depth. At each position
are talented and experienced men
ready to step in. In the line are ends
Phi! Wolle and Jack Tellefsen; at
tackles, George Robinson and Bob
Millington; at guards, Jack McDon
ald and Don Dotters; at center, Tony
v ledved. While subs for the back-
Held will be Dill Hanlon, a quarter
back; the hampered Armstrong,
John Chii lenti, Ray Ilammett, and
Ren Morrison at the halfback posts;
and fullbacks Don Sclby and Bud
Sherman.
Fans are going to see a much re
vised Papoose attack tomorrow.
Shipkey has injected plenty of de
ception and razzle dazzle into the
offense, not only for the benefit of
the spectators but also in order to
run yardagt against those Cubs.
