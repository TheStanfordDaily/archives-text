## 
### 
Because of the number of activi
ties going on last night the semifinal
volleyball game between Phi Kappa
Sigma and El Toro was postponed
until Monday.
This will set the finals, which will
be played between Alpha Delt and
the winner of Monday night's battle,
back to Tuesday or Wednesday, ac
cording to volleyball manager Leon
Lafaille.
The intramural football game be
tween Sigma Nu and Delta Tau
Delta, which has no bearing on
league standings, was postponed un
til next week.
The play-offs in football will start
with a bang next Monday and will
run through Thursday, on which
day the final game for the intra
mural grid crown will be played.
Just a tip: don't bo surprised if the
Zetcs, big and tough, meet the Fire
house boys, fast and clever, in the
final game.
