# Troy Fears Possible Upset,
## 
### JACK GILLEAN 
Sports Editor. S. C. Daily Trojan
They say that the Stanford footballers haven't a chance against the
Trojans in the Coliseum. That Coach Howard Jones' eleven will walk
through the Indians like it did Washington State. Illinois, California, and
Oregon State.
Despite the predictions of "those in the know." the headman and his

Rose Bowl-bound gridders are
ing this game seriously. They can't
afford to be overconfident, as one j
slip and the trip to Pasadena is of!, j
L'.S.C. STILL UNBEATEN
But it is a powerful gang that
Coach Tiny Thornhill and his In
dians must face Saturday. Any team
that can go this far in the Pacific
Coast Conference without a setback
has to be strong. The S.C. record
speaks for itself.
On the other hand, reports have
come in from the north to the effect
that the once-powerful Reds have
fallen apart. This is just what Jones
fears. It makes no difference how
many games Stanford has lost, it
always puts up a struggle with the
Trojans.
TROY IN GOOD SHAPE
Fresh from a triumphant trip to
Portland, Southern California will
be in good physical shape for the
Indians. That highly-publicized in
jury to "Granny" Lansdell seemed
to have healed on the train ride
home. With the possible exception
of Captain Joe Shell, the Cardinal
and Gold men will be at full
strength.
Shell's loss will not be felt so
much, as Bob Hoffman has started
every game at blocking halfback.
With Lansdell, Doyie Nave, or Amby
Sehindler at quarterback; Bob Peo
ples, Jack Banta, or Bill Sangster at
fullback; and Bob Robertson or Jim
Slatter at halfback, S. C. will be
out after its fourth conference win.
Southern California has two equal
ly strong lines to throw at the

"weak" Reds. Four good ends—Bill
Fisk, Bob Winslow, A1 Krueger, and i
Johnny Stonebraker will all see lots :
of action. Then there are four j
tackles — Howard Stoecker, Johnny
Thomassin, Phil Gaspar, and Bob
de Lauer that will stand watching.
With Ail-American Marry Smith
as the standout, Jones has Ben Sohn,
Floyd Phillips, and Pete Kalinich to
handle the guards. Ed Dempsey has
been taking care of the center spot
in fine style, but Alex Atanasoff and
Chuck Morrill can go in at any
time.
TROJANS EXPECT TROUBLE
Just what plan of attack the
Headman intends to use is hard to
say. Everyone expected him to run
Oregon State ragged and save the
passes for later in the game. In
stead, the: Trojans had to take to
the air from the very start to win.
The Trojans should win tomorrow.
They should have won last year
against Washington, but they didn't.
The Indians may have the weakest
| team in years, but the Trojans and
(ho Headman expect trouble. If they
don't, then why do they practice un
til dark every night behind locked
gates?
