## Cardinals Must Cop Matches to Retain Conference Standing

Stanford's varsity water polo team

I Coast's "toughie," to keep from be

j dunking picture this week-end as
I they travel to Los Angeles for a two
j game series.
With the Bruins totin' a two-game
lead and a previous victory over the
I'lndians, Coach Norton Thornton's
chances of pushing his men into a
I victory are shining, but the local
j mentor recalls the way in which the
j Cards' "presented" the Uclans with
| their first win.

, The Bruins went into an early
j two-point lead and Stanford's des
! perate fling to even up the count
resulted in a series of faulty passes
that exploded in Stanford's face.
TROJANS FEARED
Thornton believes that circum
j stances had a lot to do with the
1 victory, and more fears the U.S.C.
i Trojans whom the Indians face to-
I morrow.
Against the Troy seven, Stanford
could only put across the tieing and
winning scores when rival players,
in a tough mood all afternoon,
roughed their way out of the water,
leaving Stanford with one man free.
STILL TITLE CHANCE
"Flaying U.S.C. in their own pool,"
I Thornton said, "won't be any pic
i nic. They may be tougher than
U.C.L.A. and then some."
If Stanford beats U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C., it has a chance to tie with
the Bruins for the title, unless the
Bruins should in turn be upset by
i U.S.C. In that case the Cards would
get a single room in the champion
ship department.
