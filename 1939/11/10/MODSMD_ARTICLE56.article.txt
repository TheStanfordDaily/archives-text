## 
### 
Rally Committee last night de
j clared that Stanford rooters will
J sing this story-in-verse tomorrow:
THE TROJAN HORSE
In the days of long ago the mighty
Trojan host
Held that they were the warriors
supreme;
But a little wooden horse upset
their haughty boast.
And their glory was only a dream.
Now the Trojans have a namesake
down at Southern Cal,
And they're boastful as boastful
can he;
But they're goin' to meet their
master, for the Cardinal
Will play the horse with old U.S.C.
