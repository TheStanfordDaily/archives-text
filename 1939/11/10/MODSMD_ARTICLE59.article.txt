NINE hundred Stanford students are going
south for the U.S.C. game. And of these
900, almost 500 are traveling in automobiles.
There is good reason to hope that by Monday
morning every one of them will have returned
to the campus alive and whole.
In past years a number, far too high a num
ber, of students have been involved in motor
accidents on the way down to and back from
Los Angeles. The hilarious spirit of the week
end has made them push the throttle a little
closer to the floorboard, look for a few extra
thrills, and take a lot of needless chances.
Not until a roommate, a close friend, or the
fellow in the next seat in your 10 o'clock class
has been killed or seriously injured does the
stupidity of reckless driving become fully ap
parent. Not until it is too late.
That realization must not come to Stanford
next week.
To that end, let every student driving to the
game resolve to exercise intelligence and care.
Let hirn remember that he does not own the
road, and that it is dangerous to race with the
damn fool who thinks he does.
Even if it takes an extra hour between Palm
Drive and Wilshire Boulevard, let every stu
dent behind a steering wheel remember that it
is his duty to bring Stanford back alive.
