# Stanford Men

### 
THE captain of the football team was speak
ing from the platform at the rally last night:
"This game means more to me than any other
I've played."
Led by the pajama-clad frosh on the floor,
the raucous crowd waved and cheered and
booed for five minutes. And when the racket
had subsided, he continued, "I sort of hoped
it meant that much to you."
There was silence.
And in that silence suddenly a thought struck
most of the Stanford rooters for the first time
this year. In that noiseless moment they real
ized that a football team, whether it wins or
it loses, is not a machine, but a group of men.
For the first time they seemed to appreciate
how much the men on the varsity want to win
the games they play, how dissatisfied they are
when they lose them. They began to under
stand how much more each Saturday means to
the players than it does to rooters who see fit
to sneer at the team and to criticize the coach.
In those silent seconds when the captain
stopped speaking the student body sensed
something of what it is like to fight—and to
lose the battle.
It knew how tough it is.
And it resolved to give complete support to
a team which needs that tomorrow more than
anything else.
