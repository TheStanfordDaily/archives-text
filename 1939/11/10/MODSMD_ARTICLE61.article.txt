# A 						Real Armistice
## 
### 
r T~ , OMORROW is Armistice Day.
-L It is the beginning of real Armistice Days,
or it is the last Armistice Day.
For nearly 21 years this country naturally
supposed the first Armistice was Nov. 11, 1918.
They could not know that the day began merely
a postponement of the war, not an end of it.
For Europe, that old, that laughable Armistice
Day is gone, completely gone. Sometime in the
future they will make another armistice, and
hope that it will hold, that the things the govern
ments of their countries say on the surface will
be what they mean underneath. Rut it will be

"sometime in the future." It won't happen to
morrow.
Here in the United States it can happen to
morrow. Tomorrow isn't just an ordinary day.
It isn't merely a holiday. It is a day packed with
emotion. Surrounding it are two of America's
primary ideologies, independence and peace.
Tomorrow America can decide whether she
wants to remain independent and at peace. Her
Armistice hasn't been broken. She hasn't lost
faith with herself. She can decide to keep faith.
America can't decide this by watching pa
rades and listening to speeches. She can decide
by thinking first, and then wanting, wanting to
stay out of war.
Tomorrow, Armistice Day, is the day to de
cide this. Tomorrow Americans may remem
ber that they haven't declared war yet, they
aren't trapped yet. They will think of the last
war and what this country lost by it, what they
themselves lost by it; and they can laugh at
what we gained by it.
A whole country will be thinking of this,
feeling this. And if that country does not want
another war, if she can convince herself that
she does not want another war, she will give
herself her biggest chance to remain at peace.
There will be no public announcement, no
declaration that America has decided not to
go to war. It simply will be something that
the American people believe. Something that
the Americans, individually, themselves know.
They will need no Hitler telling them in print
that this is the way it is, so bow down and fol
low.—D. J.

rades and listening to speeches. She can decide
by thinking first, and then wanting, wanting to
stay out of war.
Tomorrow, Armistice Day, is the day to de
cide this. Tomorrow Americans may remem
ber that they haven't declared war yet, they
aren't trapped yet. They will think of the last
war and what this country lost by it, what they
themselves lost by it; and they can laugh at
what we gained by it.
A whole country will be thinking of this,
feeling this. And if that country does not want
another war, if she can convince herself that
she does not want another war, she will give
herself her biggest chance to remain at peace.
There will be no public announcement, no
declaration that America has decided not to
go to war. It simply will be something that
the American people believe. Something that
the Americans, individually, themselves know.
They will need no Hitler telling them in print
that this is the way it is, so bow down and fol
low.—D. J.
r T~ , OMORROW is Armistice Day.
-L It is the beginning of real Armistice Days,
or it is the last Armistice Day.
For nearly 21 years this country naturally
supposed the first Armistice was Nov. 11, 1918.
They could not know that the day began merely
a postponement of the war, not an end of it.
For Europe, that old, that laughable Armistice
Day is gone, completely gone. Sometime in the
future they will make another armistice, and
hope that it will hold, that the things the govern
ments of their countries say on the surface will
be what they mean underneath. Rut it will be

"sometime in the future." It won't happen to
morrow.
Here in the United States it can happen to
morrow. Tomorrow isn't just an ordinary day.
It isn't merely a holiday. It is a day packed with
emotion. Surrounding it are two of America's
primary ideologies, independence and peace.
Tomorrow America can decide whether she
wants to remain independent and at peace. Her
Armistice hasn't been broken. She hasn't lost
faith with herself. She can decide to keep faith.
America can't decide this by watching pa
rades and listening to speeches. She can decide
by thinking first, and then wanting, wanting to
stay out of war.
