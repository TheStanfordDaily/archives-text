RAII RAII RAII
441 ME," a middle-aged lady wtih pince-nez
remarked at last year's Big Game, "isn't it posi
tively savage the way those mobs of students scream
and shoul!" She probably reads very sensual poetry
and Freud in her boudoir and is coldly cruel to small
children.
Yes, madam, screaming and shouting is savage, as
savage as you are ashamed to be. But it is natural,
wholesome, and a hell of a lot. of fun. Wc rather enjoy
it. The rooting section doesn't dull one's appreciation
of Wagner or even Beethoven, and everyone who sings
"Sons of the Stanford Red" is not a potential storm
trooper.
On the other hand, the formalized advocate of
"school spirit" who puts on a solemn, duty-dispensing
face is not much closer to the frank facts when he tells
us with righteousness ringing in his voice, "It's our
duty to get out there and support the team. Don't
be a slacker." The conception of dutv, it seems to
mo, has no bearing whatever on the sort of school
spirit that is evidenced by the raucous-pleasures of
yelling at a football game. Most of us yell because we
like to yell. Most of us watch the football games be
cause we like to watch football games. And most of
us exhibit what the inhibited lady with pince-nez
called "savagery" because we are part savage.
* * *
HPHOSE who condemn the rah-rah activities with a
hyper-sophisticated glance down their noses miss
the point. Everyone likes excitement, color, and. con
flict. But the chap who thinks the obligation to have
school spirit was sent by a special Rally-Cornmitteeman
in Heaven, wearing a great red and white rooters hat
and a pure white shirt, has gone just as badly awry.
It adds to the excitement and the thrill to have rallies
and bon-fires—big bonfires. It adds to the excitement
and the fun to have a blaring band, three yell leaders,
and a majorette—an attractive majorette. Bui it con
tributes nothing whatever to the enjoyment of root
ing to have a bunch of long-faced campfire boys tell
ing us about our "sacred obligations to have school
spirit." In fact, it rather contributes to premature
laryngitis, if not nausea.
School spirit should be fun. Whenever it, ceases to
be fun and becomes a duty, it is no longer school
spirit. It is drudgery, and also a little ridiculous.
Obligation is for armies. Spontaneity is for rooting
sections. We are emotionally asked, not sourly com
manded, to "Come Join the Band."

duty to get out there and support the team. Don't
be a slacker." The conception of dutv, it seems to
mo, has no bearing whatever on the sort of school
spirit that is evidenced by the raucous-pleasures of
yelling at a football game. Most of us yell because we
like to yell. Most of us watch the football games be
cause we like to watch football games. And most of
us exhibit what the inhibited lady with pince-nez
called "savagery" because we are part savage.

HPHOSE who condemn the rah-rah activities with a
hyper-sophisticated glance down their noses miss
the point. Everyone likes excitement, color, and. con
flict. But the chap who thinks the obligation to have
school spirit was sent by a special Rally-Cornmitteeman
in Heaven, wearing a great red and white rooters hat
and a pure white shirt, has gone just as badly awry.
It adds to the excitement and the thrill to have rallies
and bon-fires—big bonfires. It adds to the excitement
and the fun to have a blaring band, three yell leaders,
and a majorette—an attractive majorette. Bui it con
tributes nothing whatever to the enjoyment of root
ing to have a bunch of long-faced campfire boys tell
ing us about our "sacred obligations to have school
spirit." In fact, it rather contributes to premature
laryngitis, if not nausea.
School spirit should be fun. Whenever it, ceases to
be fun and becomes a duty, it is no longer school
spirit. It is drudgery, and also a little ridiculous.
Obligation is for armies. Spontaneity is for rooting
sections. We are emotionally asked, not sourly com
manded, to "Come Join the Band."

441 ME," a middle-aged lady wtih pince-nez
remarked at last year's Big Game, "isn't it posi
tively savage the way those mobs of students scream
and shoul!" She probably reads very sensual poetry
and Freud in her boudoir and is coldly cruel to small
children.
Yes, madam, screaming and shouting is savage, as
savage as you are ashamed to be. But it is natural,
wholesome, and a hell of a lot. of fun. Wc rather enjoy
it. The rooting section doesn't dull one's appreciation
of Wagner or even Beethoven, and everyone who sings
"Sons of the Stanford Red" is not a potential storm
trooper.
On the other hand, the formalized advocate of
"school spirit" who puts on a solemn, duty-dispensing
face is not much closer to the frank facts when he tells
us with righteousness ringing in his voice, "It's our
duty to get out there and support the team. Don't
