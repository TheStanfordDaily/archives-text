## OUR MYSTERY GIRL 
### 
r JpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Several weeks ago I became extremely inter
ested in one Horten.se Figgins, and to make matters
worse, I then proceeded to thumb through the pages
of the "Directory of Stanford Students." Gullible to do
such a deed, yes, yet she had become such ail irresist
ible passion that my nights and days were spent in
dreaming of my sorrow.
But alas, no Hortense Figgins was listed between
the golden covers, no home town, no grade-point aver
age, no telephone number, no nothing. After all she
said about the "Bawlout," she was not. using her
right name. This caused me to become extremely sad,
and even now I am crying in my beer, which I turned
to in order to forget. Hortense, but to no avail.
# * * *
MAY I appeal to Hortense, to vou Mr. Editor,
and to God to bring her out from behind her mask
of anonymity so that the fellows of Stanford may
know who she really is? For here must be a girl of
charm and grace, a woman that must be beautiful
and glamorous. Now I ask you, could any other sort
of person write such heavenly gems and use so many
effective metaphors? By her words and sentences it
is easy to see that her ideals must be truly irreproach
able. Yea, verily.
So please, dear Hortense, make yourself known since
your alias has been your only wrong-doing. Please
do, lest I spend all of my next month's allowance to
hire detectives to solve the mystery. I realize that I am
risking much in signing my name, and yet what else
can I do after all I have said?
In all sincerity,
