r PHE EDITOR. SIR:
After long cogitation, I am forced to open my
mouth for the purpose of putting my foot in it. I am
in the mood to condemn Mr. MellinkofT on his "Rough"
Bull Session on these grounds: There ain't no more
Roughs; they are practically extinct animals around
Stanford these days. There are too many of these Holly
wood cowboys, not the too few complained of bv our
dear Hortense. Somebody ought to take them out and
drown them.
Yours for a return to the "good old days,"
Junius Carv, Routih
