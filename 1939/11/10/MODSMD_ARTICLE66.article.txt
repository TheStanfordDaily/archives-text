## Government Administrator Warns Nation Not to Be Over-optimistic 
###

Works Administrator John M. Carmody said tonight.
Speaking on (he Town Hall of the Air program through the facilities
of the National Broadcasting Company, he warned the nation not to he

over - optimistic regarding potential,
benefits to American industry as a
result of the European conflict.
WAR BAI) FOR JOBS
If history repeats itself, he said,
the current war eventually will add
to the number of American unem
ployed and increase the urgency of
ihe unemployment problem.
Total production and employment
in the United States, he continued,
has about reached the level of the
boom year 1929, despite persistent
unemployment in the last decade.
POPULATION GROWING
"The reason," he said, "is that the
population is still growing. There are
about (500,000 more workers every
year. To get back to 1929 is not
good enough, because we have
about (>,000,000 more people looking
for jobs. In order to take up this
extra 0,000,000 we have to expand all
along the line."
Relief costs, he added, do not de
crease automatically each time busi
ness improves because of the 9,-
000,000 unemployed, only 2,000,000
are on WPA rolls. An additional
million, he said, are idle in families
having one worker on WPA, and an
other million employable workers
are on direct relief.
