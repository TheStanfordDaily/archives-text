about Cigarette Tobaccos
rr\
There are four types
I of tobaccos found in the more popular
cigarettes, namely... Bright, Maryland,
Hurley and Turkish.
ALL THESE TOBACCOS except Turkish (which is
bought direct from the planters in Turkey and Greece)
and Maryland (which is bought through sealed bids
under government supervision) are bought at public
auction, just like any other auction where you might
have bought in a table or a chair.
At THE AUCTION SALE the tobacco is piled in
baskets weighing from about 100 to 500 pounds and
each purchaser buys all of his tobaccos by competitive
bidding for the particular piles he wants.
Tllli CHESTERFIELD BUYERS buy the best of
these mild ripe tobaccos for (he Chesterfield blend.
And it is Chesterfield's Combination.. .the right amounts
of Burley and Bright. . . just enough Maryland .. . and
just enough Turkish—that makes the big difference
between Chesterfield and other cigarettes.
It IS BECAUSE of this combination
that Chesterfields are COOLER, have
a MUTER TASTE and are DEFINITELY
MILDER, They are made of the world's
best cigarette tobaccos. You can't buy
a better cigarette. \
