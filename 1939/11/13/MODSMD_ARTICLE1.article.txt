### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
HPHE CEASELESS bickering that
has characterized Soviet-Baltic
relations in the last month continued
unabated last night.
The Soviet press warned Russia's
latest victim, Finland, that she will
find "ways and means of obtaining
whatever we need" for improving
the defense of Leningrad despite
Finland's rejection of the Soviet
military and territorial demands. And j
Finnish Foreign Minister Eljas Erk- j
ko declared that Finland has reached
the limit of her concessions to the
Soviets and will call the Finnish
negotiators home from Moscow
within a day or two unless some
formula is found immediately to
break the deadlock.
St! * *
And so, with the negotiations on
Russia's military and territorial
demands at a critical impasse,
Finland seems determined not to
bo intimidated by Soviet accusa
tions of an "irreconcilable atti
tude." The Finnish cabinet will
probably reach a decision tomor
row on whether to recall its Mos
cow delegates, headed by Juhu K.
Paasikivi and Finance Minister j
V. A. Tanner. Recall of the mis
sion will create a grave situation,
undoubtedly will stir the Soviets
to fresh outbursts of anger.

put the Finnish case
rather eloquently. He compared
the question of Finland's security
with that of New York City, for ex
ample.
"Near New York is a place
called Sandy Hook," he said.
"Would America like to turn that
over to some other power?"
What he obviously referred to was
Russia's demand for a naval base on
Hango peninsula, dominating the
north side of the entrance to the
Gulf of Finland.
When the issue is described so
graphically, when the comparison
is so clear, it's easy for any Amer
ican to understand small Finland's
difficult spot. The Soviets contin
ued, too, to attack the United
States and President Roosevelt,
with charges that "the lackeys of
British and American capital" are
guilty of supporting Finland's
dangerous game of preparing for
war against the Soviet Union.
1 [NTIL now Russia has made four
proposals to Finland which are
"indispensible for the northwestern
naval frontiers of the Soviet Union"
and also, they say, for the defense of
Finland.
These demands include a naval
base on Hango peninsula, closing
the entrance of the Gulf of Finland
to all but Soviet ships. Russia is
eager, too, to protect her naval base
of Kronstadt by fortifying some
islands in the eastern part of the
gtilf. Then she would like to grab
two strategic peninsulas that jut
into the Norwegian fjord of Varan
ger. The demand for the two north
em peninsulas, which would mean
revision of the Finnish-Soviet fron
tier on the Arctic, is based on the
Soviet contention that they are a
menace to the security of Murmansk
on Kola Bay, Russia's only ice-free
port in the Arctic. Americans will
remember Kola Bay because it was
the spot where the much-publicized
American freighter City of Flint
was finally discovered.
Leningrad, with a population al
most as large as all Finland, is the
center of Russian shipbuilding and
mechanical industries and is now
under constant threat from air,
naval, and artillery attack. And.
situated just 20 miles from the
present Finnish border, Leningrad,
to the Soviets, is a key city. It
must be protected at all costs.
Molotov and Stalin realize its im
portance; and, in accordance with
their buffer policy, they're trying
to insure its security by shifting
the boundary to Russia's advan
tagc.

the question of Finland's security
with that of New York City, for ex

"Near New York is a place
called Sandy Hook," he said.
"Would America like to turn that
over to some other power?"
What he obviously referred to was
Russia's demand for a naval base on
Hango peninsula, dominating the
north side of the entrance to the
Gulf of Finland.
When the issue is described so
graphically, when the comparison
is so clear, it's easy for any Amer
ican to understand small Finland's
difficult spot. The Soviets contin
ued, too, to attack the United
States and President Roosevelt,
with charges that "the lackeys of
British and American capital" are
guilty of supporting Finland's
dangerous game of preparing for
war against the Soviet Union.
1 [NTIL now Russia has made four
proposals to Finland which are
"indispensible for the northwestern
naval frontiers of the Soviet Union"
and also, they say, for the defense of
Finland.
These demands include a naval
base on Hango peninsula, closing
the entrance of the Gulf of Finland
to all but Soviet ships. Russia is
eager, too, to protect her naval base
of Kronstadt by fortifying some
islands in the eastern part of the
gtilf. Then she would like to grab
two strategic peninsulas that jut
into the Norwegian fjord of Varan
ger. The demand for the two north
em peninsulas, which would mean
revision of the Finnish-Soviet fron
tier on the Arctic, is based on the
Soviet contention that they are a
menace to the security of Murmansk
on Kola Bay, Russia's only ice-free
