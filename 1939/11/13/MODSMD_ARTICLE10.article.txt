# 'Stanford Men Slow About Big Game Date'—The Women
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
"Stanford men arc slow."
Such was the opinion expressed yesterday afternoon by campus women
when an unofficial but authoritative survey of Farm sororities, Roblc,
Lagunita, Union, and other women's living groups revealed that only one
out of every three Stanford women is dated for Big Game niijlit.

y The "It's Dated" slogan of one na
] tionally advertised product does not
! apply to the Farm, where from the
♦op of Sorority Row to Roble, more
than 700 Stanford women find them
; selves without escoi*ts for Big Game
! evening.
DAILY TAKES POLL
The poll, taken by The Daily, re
| vealed that out of 1200 women reg
; istered in the University, approxi
, mately 500 are dated for Saturday,
' Nov. 25, the night of the Stanford
j California gridiron classic.
"Stanford men claim that campus
women have to be dated months in
: advance," wailed one of the 1200.
| "Now what can they say?"
ROW BETTER OFF
Least hard hit of all women groups
is the Row, with only one out of five
women still lacking a date for Big
Game evening.
Largest campus woman's living
group, with approximately 450 wom
en in residence, showed a ratio of
1 only one woman out of every four
' who is sure of a Stanford man in
i attendance on Big Game evening.
Point of view of the Stanford male
was summarized by the opinion that
J three main sources of entertainment
were available for Big Game night:
Del Monte, San Francisco in gen
eral, the A.S.S.U. - sponsored Big
Game Dance at Millbrae Country
Club.
"Big Game night is an institution
in itself," said one representative of
the sterner sex, "but there are 3000
men on the campus. Aren't the
women all dated by this time?"
GRIER IS SOLUTION
Consensus was that Jimmy Grier's
orchestra at the Big Game Dance at
Millbrae was the best solution to the
Big Game night problem.
But the Big Game night problem
looms just as large to two out of
three of Stanford's 1200.
"Stanford men are slow!"

when an unofficial but authoritative survey of Farm sororities, Roblc,
Lagunita, Union, and other women's living groups revealed that only one
out of every three Stanford women is dated for Big Game niijlit.

y The "It's Dated" slogan of one na
] tionally advertised product does not
! apply to the Farm, where from the
♦op of Sorority Row to Roble, more
than 700 Stanford women find them
; selves without escoi*ts for Big Game
! evening.
DAILY TAKES POLL
The poll, taken by The Daily, re
| vealed that out of 1200 women reg
; istered in the University, approxi
, mately 500 are dated for Saturday,
' Nov. 25, the night of the Stanford
j California gridiron classic.
"Stanford men claim that campus
women have to be dated months in
: advance," wailed one of the 1200.
| "Now what can they say?"
ROW BETTER OFF
Least hard hit of all women groups
is the Row, with only one out of five
women still lacking a date for Big
Game evening.
Largest campus woman's living
group, with approximately 450 wom
en in residence, showed a ratio of
1 only one woman out of every four
' who is sure of a Stanford man in
i attendance on Big Game evening.
Point of view of the Stanford male
was summarized by the opinion that
J three main sources of entertainment
were available for Big Game night:
Del Monte, San Francisco in gen
eral, the A.S.S.U. - sponsored Big
Game Dance at Millbrae Country
Club.
"Big Game night is an institution
in itself," said one representative of
the sterner sex, "but there are 3000
men on the campus. Aren't the
women all dated by this time?"
GRIER IS SOLUTION
Consensus was that Jimmy Grier's
orchestra at the Big Game Dance at
Millbrae was the best solution to the
Big Game night problem.
But the Big Game night problem
looms just as large to two out of
three of Stanford's 1200.
"Stanford men are slow!"
"Stanford men arc slow."
Such was the opinion expressed yesterday afternoon by campus women
