# Great Trojan Eleven Swamps Fighing Cards In Rough-Tough Battle
## Farm Rooters Happy Despite Decisive Loss 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON Editor, The Stanford Daily 
According to the scoreboard at the
Los Angeles Coliseum, it was
Gloomy Saturday for the 900 rooters
who had traveled south for the
U.S.C. game. But, a fighting spirit,
as hearty and determined as any i
that was to be seen on the playing
field, made the Stanford section
almost jubilant in defeat.
As the score piled high, the In
dians and Trojans in the stands put.
on a display of sportsmanship before
approximately 50,000 spectators such
as seldom seen at an intercollegiate
athletic event. A sincere, unsneer
ing S.C. section broke the weary
monotony of a one-sided penalty
filled second half by giving a yell
for the Stanford rooters early in
the fourth quarter.
ROOTERS REPLY
Stanford responded with a lusty,
"thank you," and then followed in
machine-gun succession, "you're
welcome," "don't mention it," and
finally, "well all right"—to which
the appropriate "chop-chops" and
"hoy-hoys" were added. A few min
utes later the two cheering sections
were giving yells for each other's
coaches, singing each other's songs,
and admonishing each other to "beat j
Cal" and to "beat the Bruins."
It was getting dark in the stadium
and the Troymen chanted "turn on
the lights." The request was imme
diately fulfilled, and the last half
of the fourth quarter was played in
the glare of arc lights. The brilliant
uniforms of the players and the
rooting sections, bright with pom
pons and rooters' caps, made the
Coliseum look like a scene from the
"Wizard of Oz."
SING TOGETHER
At the sound of the final gun the
U.S.C. rooters streamed across the
field to join with the Stanford visi
tors in singing songs of both schools
in the half-darkened stadium. And
Ihose who glanced in the direction of
the players' tunnel saw that the men
of the two varsities were leaving the
field arm in arm.
Five hundred Stanford rooters
drove south in automobiles, and the
other 400 traveled on two Southern
Pacific special trains. Hilarity and
good fellowship were prevalent on
trainboard, with the lounge, danc
ing, and dining cars enjoying a
lively patronage throughout the
evening.
Following the game most Stanford
men and women were seen dancing
to big-name orchestras at popular
Los Angeles niteries. The members
of the team were guests of the alumni
at, the Biltmore Hotel.

and admonishing each other to "beat j
Cal" and to "beat the Bruins."
It was getting dark in the stadium
and the Troymen chanted "turn on
the lights." The request was imme
diately fulfilled, and the last half
of the fourth quarter was played in
the glare of arc lights. The brilliant
uniforms of the players and the
rooting sections, bright with pom
pons and rooters' caps, made the
Coliseum look like a scene from the
"Wizard of Oz."
SING TOGETHER
At the sound of the final gun the
U.S.C. rooters streamed across the
field to join with the Stanford visi
tors in singing songs of both schools
in the half-darkened stadium. And
Ihose who glanced in the direction of
the players' tunnel saw that the men
of the two varsities were leaving the
field arm in arm.
Five hundred Stanford rooters
drove south in automobiles, and the
other 400 traveled on two Southern
Pacific special trains. Hilarity and
good fellowship were prevalent on
trainboard, with the lounge, danc
ing, and dining cars enjoying a
lively patronage throughout the
evening.
Following the game most Stanford
men and women were seen dancing
to big-name orchestras at popular
Los Angeles niteries. The members
of the team were guests of the alumni
at, the Biltmore Hotel.
According to the scoreboard at the
Los Angeles Coliseum, it was
Gloomy Saturday for the 900 rooters
who had traveled south for the
U.S.C. game. But, a fighting spirit,
as hearty and determined as any i
that was to be seen on the playing
field, made the Stanford section
almost jubilant in defeat.
As the score piled high, the In
dians and Trojans in the stands put.
on a display of sportsmanship before
approximately 50,000 spectators such
as seldom seen at an intercollegiate
athletic event. A sincere, unsneer
ing S.C. section broke the weary
monotony of a one-sided penalty
filled second half by giving a yell
for the Stanford rooters early in
the fourth quarter.
ROOTERS REPLY
Stanford responded with a lusty,
"thank you," and then followed in
machine-gun succession, "you're
welcome," "don't mention it," and
finally, "well all right"—to which
the appropriate "chop-chops" and
"hoy-hoys" were added. A few min
utes later the two cheering sections
were giving yells for each other's
coaches, singing each other's songs,
and admonishing each other to "beat j
Cal" and to "beat the Bruins."
