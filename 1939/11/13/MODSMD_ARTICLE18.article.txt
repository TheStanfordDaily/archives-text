TRADITIONAL DATE
It may seem a bit superfluous to
announce that the Big Game Gaie
ties arc presented annually on the
night before the Big Game. This
year's Gaieties will be a stream
lined production, shorter, gayer, and
with a definite campus tie-in. Nine
songs and two dance numbers, spe
cialty acts, and a cast including 75
or 80 people, according to Bulotti,
is "only the beginning."
BIRNBAUM DOES SCORE
Myron Birnbaum, musical direc
tor, is working day and night, on the
musical score over in the Ram's Head
room. Orchestrations for the over
ture, which will swing into a mam
moth staircase number, and the
finale have already been concluded.
Art McCue and his band, who fur
nished the music for last year's
i Gaieties and Spring Show, have
been secured to play again this year.
Arrangements for several Gaieties
performers to appear in the City
with Carl Ravazza and his band are
under way. A group of Gaieties
singers will do several of the show
numbers at the Sir Francis Drake
and may appear on the radio pro
gram some time this week, accord
ing to Bulotti.

j added to the Gaieties roster: Mickey
I Smith's "Why Don't You Leave Me
j Alone?" and Nancy Behlkes "I Can't
