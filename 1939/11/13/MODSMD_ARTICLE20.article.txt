# Indians' Spirit Willing, Brawn Just Too Weak
## 
### JERRY MAYER Sports Editor, Stanford Daily 
Stanford just doesn't have it..
A massive, precise University of
Southern California team Saturday
completely dispelled the theory that
the Indians were a great team that,
couldn't find the spark to ignite
them.
Saturday Stanford found the
spark it had long sought as the pana
cea to its ills, only to find in a 33-0
drubbing from the Trojans that the
talent wasn't equal to the inspira
tion. This, incidentally, Ls the big
gest winning margin ever registered
in a series that goes back to 1908.
Right up to the final gun, the In
dians fought tooth and nail to turn
back the never-ending horde of
Trojans, but they didn't have a
chance. Not a team that ever played
football would have had a chance
against U.S.C. in that game. There
are not enough superlatives to de
scribe the Howard Jonesmen of Sat
urday.
BET ON TROY
Just tuck away a tip in the back
of your mind—take S.C. against any
team in the country. In fact, you
can give 12 points and two-to-one
odds on the Trojans against the
cream of the nation—and I'll cover
your bet.
But Stanford Saturday wasn't
without its heroes.
A gent named Norm Standlee
cracked the tackles, rail the end. 1 .,
crunched through the guards,
banged past center. Southern Cali
fornia will have to wait a long while
before seeing another performance
such as Standlee gave. He was a
one-man personification of the
U.S.C. team, and he really gave the
fans a show for their money.
And Stan Andersen, captain and
left tackle, completely proved that
he meant what he said at last
Thursday's Pajamarino when he
told the students lhat "this game
means more to me than any game
that I have ever played in."
ANDERSEN SHINES
Andersen was, along with U.S.C.'s
all-American guard, Harry Smith,
easily the outstanding lineman on
the field. The Trojans tried a
couple of tentative pokes at his side
of the line early in the game, and
then switched their attack to the
other side of the line and to the
airlanes.
Once,, and only once, during the
entire game did Stanford approach
the S.C. goal. That was in the first,
quarter just after S.C. had marched
73 yards in four plays to post, a 7-0
lead.
After Lansdell's 21-yard punt
rolled out of bounds on S.C.'s 38,
the Indians made their concerted
drive. Frank Albert started the
brief rally by hurling a 5-yard pass
i to Jim Groves. Harry Smith broke
I through to spill Standlee for a two-
I yard loss, but the mightiest Indian
j of them all reared right back to pile
i off l ight tackle for 20 yards before
j Smith hauled him down from be
hind.

That made it a first down on the
