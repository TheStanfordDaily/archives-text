# Indians' Spirit Willing, Brawn Just Too Weak
## 
### JERRY MAYER Sports Editor, Stanford Daily 
Stanford just doesn't have it..
A massive, precise University of
Southern California team Saturday
completely dispelled the theory that
the Indians were a great team that,
couldn't find the spark to ignite
them.
Saturday Stanford found the
spark it had long sought as the pana
cea to its ills, only to find in a 33-0
drubbing from the Trojans that the
talent wasn't equal to the inspira
tion. This, incidentally, Ls the big
gest winning margin ever registered
in a series that goes back to 1908.
Right up to the final gun, the In
dians fought tooth and nail to turn
back the never-ending horde of
Trojans, but they didn't have a
chance. Not a team that ever played
football would have had a chance
against U.S.C. in that game. There
are not enough superlatives to de
scribe the Howard Jonesmen of Sat
urday.
BET ON TROY
Just tuck away a tip in the back
of your mind—take S.C. against any
team in the country. In fact, you
can give 12 points and two-to-one
odds on the Trojans against the
cream of the nation—and I'll cover
your bet.
But Stanford Saturday wasn't
without its heroes.
A gent named Norm Standlee
cracked the tackles, rail the end. 1 .,
crunched through the guards,
banged past center. Southern Cali
fornia will have to wait a long while
before seeing another performance
such as Standlee gave. He was a
one-man personification of the
U.S.C. team, and he really gave the
fans a show for their money.
And Stan Andersen, captain and
left tackle, completely proved that
he meant what he said at last
Thursday's Pajamarino when he
told the students lhat "this game
means more to me than any game
that I have ever played in."
ANDERSEN SHINES
Andersen was, along with U.S.C.'s
all-American guard, Harry Smith,
easily the outstanding lineman on
the field. The Trojans tried a
couple of tentative pokes at his side
of the line early in the game, and
then switched their attack to the
other side of the line and to the
airlanes.
Once,, and only once, during the
entire game did Stanford approach
the S.C. goal. That was in the first,
quarter just after S.C. had marched
73 yards in four plays to post, a 7-0
lead.
After Lansdell's 21-yard punt
rolled out of bounds on S.C.'s 38,
the Indians made their concerted
drive. Frank Albert started the
brief rally by hurling a 5-yard pass
i to Jim Groves. Harry Smith broke
I through to spill Standlee for a two-
I yard loss, but the mightiest Indian
j of them all reared right back to pile
i off l ight tackle for 20 yards before
j Smith hauled him down from be
hind.
| ATTACK BOGS DOWN
That made it a first down on the
I 13-yard line. Albert picked up a
I yard at left tackle — and Stanford
was all through. Albert fumbled a
bad pass from center and was set.
for an 8-yard loss. Twice more Al
bert was downed lor losses, each
time while trying to pick out an
open receiver on pass plays, and S.C. ]
| took over the ball on their own 31-
yard line. '
j Undoubtedly the Trojans could j
have beaten the Indians easily any I
way they tried. They tried the air- !
lanes and their success was phe- J
nomenal. Their success on the j
ground might have been as phe- j
nomenal if they had clung to that
line of attack.
The Indians played a game cal- j
I culated to choke the heart of the
J most biased Stanford hater. Trail -
] ing 27-0 at. the half, the Indians j
, fought £>ack to hold their powerful J
opponents to a mere six digits in the
j second half. They didn't stop trying
' once, and at the end they were still
blocking and tackling as if they had
a chance to win—except, of course,
for the fact that the tremendous Tro
jan reserve strength had slowed the
smaller Indians down to a walk.
To make a long story short, here
are how the Trojan touchdowns
were scored:
First touchdown, first quarter —
! Taking the ball on their own 27 after
| a quick-kick by Albert, the Trojans
i scored in four plays. Lansdell picked
I up 5 yards, and then 10 more. Peo
ples got away on a 43-yard jaunt,
and then Lansdell galloped 15 yards
for the score.

Second touchdown, second quar
ter—Schindler passed to Jim Slatter
from the Stanford four-yard lino into
the Hat for the tally after the In
dians' one scoring threat bogged
down on the Trojan 12-yard line.
Third touchdown, second quarter
—Nave passed successfully to Sang
ster and then to Engle, putting the
ball on the one-yard line, from
when? he himself rolled over the
goal-line.
Fourth touchdown, second quar
tet* —Nave threw the pay-off pass
again, this time to Duboski, a sev
enth or eighth-string Trojan un
known, from the Indian 10. A clip
ping penalty on Stanford aided the
S.C. cause no end.
Fifth and linal touchdown, third
quarter-Lansdell went around right
end for this one a few seconds after
Hugh Gallarneau ljad staved off a
drive by recovering a Trojan fumble
in the end zone.
Stanford gained 224 yards from
j passes and scrimmage, usually
j enough to beat an ordinary team
but the Trojan horde, with 13 backs
carrying gained 417. and split them
almost evenly in the air and on the
ground. Stanford's nine first downs
evidenced their will to fight but the
Southern Catapult grossed 20.

ANDERSEN SHINES
Andersen was, along with U.S.C.'s
all-American guard, Harry Smith,
easily the outstanding lineman on
the field. The Trojans tried a
couple of tentative pokes at his side
of the line early in the game, and
then switched their attack to the
other side of the line and to the
airlanes.
Once,, and only once, during the
entire game did Stanford approach
the S.C. goal. That was in the first,
quarter just after S.C. had marched
73 yards in four plays to post, a 7-0
lead.
After Lansdell's 21-yard punt
rolled out of bounds on S.C.'s 38,
the Indians made their concerted
drive. Frank Albert started the
brief rally by hurling a 5-yard pass
i to Jim Groves. Harry Smith broke
I through to spill Standlee for a two-
I yard loss, but the mightiest Indian
j of them all reared right back to pile
i off l ight tackle for 20 yards before
j Smith hauled him down from be
hind.
| ATTACK BOGS DOWN
That made it a first down on the
I 13-yard line. Albert picked up a
I yard at left tackle — and Stanford
was all through. Albert fumbled a
bad pass from center and was set.
for an 8-yard loss. Twice more Al
bert was downed lor losses, each
time while trying to pick out an
open receiver on pass plays, and S.C. ]
| took over the ball on their own 31-
yard line. '
j Undoubtedly the Trojans could j
have beaten the Indians easily any I
way they tried. They tried the air- !
lanes and their success was phe- J
nomenal. Their success on the j
ground might have been as phe- j
nomenal if they had clung to that
line of attack.
The Indians played a game cal- j
I culated to choke the heart of the
J most biased Stanford hater. Trail -
] ing 27-0 at. the half, the Indians j
, fought £>ack to hold their powerful J
opponents to a mere six digits in the
j second half. They didn't stop trying
' once, and at the end they were still
blocking and tackling as if they had
a chance to win—except, of course,
for the fact that the tremendous Tro
jan reserve strength had slowed the
smaller Indians down to a walk.
To make a long story short, here
are how the Trojan touchdowns
were scored:
First touchdown, first quarter —
! Taking the ball on their own 27 after
| a quick-kick by Albert, the Trojans
i scored in four plays. Lansdell picked
I up 5 yards, and then 10 more. Peo
ples got away on a 43-yard jaunt,
and then Lansdell galloped 15 yards
for the score.

Second touchdown, second quar
ter—Schindler passed to Jim Slatter
from the Stanford four-yard lino into
the Hat for the tally after the In
dians' one scoring threat bogged
down on the Trojan 12-yard line.
Third touchdown, second quarter
—Nave passed successfully to Sang
ster and then to Engle, putting the
ball on the one-yard line, from
when? he himself rolled over the
goal-line.
Fourth touchdown, second quar
tet* —Nave threw the pay-off pass
again, this time to Duboski, a sev
enth or eighth-string Trojan un
known, from the Indian 10. A clip
ping penalty on Stanford aided the
S.C. cause no end.
Fifth and linal touchdown, third
quarter-Lansdell went around right
end for this one a few seconds after
Hugh Gallarneau ljad staved off a
drive by recovering a Trojan fumble
in the end zone.
Stanford gained 224 yards from
j passes and scrimmage, usually
j enough to beat an ordinary team
but the Trojan horde, with 13 backs
carrying gained 417. and split them
almost evenly in the air and on the
ground. Stanford's nine first downs
evidenced their will to fight but the
Southern Catapult grossed 20.

To make a long story short, here
are how the Trojan touchdowns
were scored:
First touchdown, first quarter —
! Taking the ball on their own 27 after

i scored in four plays. Lansdell picked
I up 5 yards, and then 10 more. Peo
ples got away on a 43-yard jaunt,
and then Lansdell galloped 15 yards
for the score.

Second touchdown, second quar
ter—Schindler passed to Jim Slatter
from the Stanford four-yard lino into
the Hat for the tally after the In
dians' one scoring threat bogged
down on the Trojan 12-yard line.
Third touchdown, second quarter
—Nave passed successfully to Sang
ster and then to Engle, putting the
ball on the one-yard line, from
when? he himself rolled over the
goal-line.
Fourth touchdown, second quar
tet* —Nave threw the pay-off pass
again, this time to Duboski, a sev
enth or eighth-string Trojan un
known, from the Indian 10. A clip
ping penalty on Stanford aided the
S.C. cause no end.
Fifth and linal touchdown, third
quarter-Lansdell went around right
end for this one a few seconds after
Hugh Gallarneau ljad staved off a
drive by recovering a Trojan fumble
in the end zone.
Stanford gained 224 yards from
j passes and scrimmage, usually
j enough to beat an ordinary team
but the Trojan horde, with 13 backs
carrying gained 417. and split them
almost evenly in the air and on the
ground. Stanford's nine first downs
evidenced their will to fight but the
Southern Catapult grossed 20.

j second half. They didn't stop trying
' once, and at the end they were still
blocking and tackling as if they had
a chance to win—except, of course,
for the fact that the tremendous Tro
jan reserve strength had slowed the
smaller Indians down to a walk.
To make a long story short, here
are how the Trojan touchdowns
were scored:
First touchdown, first quarter —
! Taking the ball on their own 27 after
| a quick-kick by Albert, the Trojans
i scored in four plays. Lansdell picked
I up 5 yards, and then 10 more. Peo
ples got away on a 43-yard jaunt,
and then Lansdell galloped 15 yards
for the score.

Second touchdown, second quar
ter—Schindler passed to Jim Slatter
from the Stanford four-yard lino into
the Hat for the tally after the In
dians' one scoring threat bogged
down on the Trojan 12-yard line.
Third touchdown, second quarter
—Nave passed successfully to Sang
ster and then to Engle, putting the
ball on the one-yard line, from
when? he himself rolled over the
goal-line.
Fourth touchdown, second quar
tet* —Nave threw the pay-off pass
again, this time to Duboski, a sev
enth or eighth-string Trojan un
known, from the Indian 10. A clip
ping penalty on Stanford aided the
S.C. cause no end.
Fifth and linal touchdown, third
quarter-Lansdell went around right
end for this one a few seconds after
Hugh Gallarneau ljad staved off a
drive by recovering a Trojan fumble
in the end zone.
Stanford gained 224 yards from
j passes and scrimmage, usually
j enough to beat an ordinary team
but the Trojan horde, with 13 backs
carrying gained 417. and split them
almost evenly in the air and on the
ground. Stanford's nine first downs
evidenced their will to fight but the
Southern Catapult grossed 20.
