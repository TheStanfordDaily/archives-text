# Geneticist Shows Alteration In Vinegar Flies' Eyes
## When Bugs' Eyes Changed Color Biologists Sat Up and Took Notice 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
No one hut a geneticist fools around with the eyes of vinegar flies nowa- I
days, willingly, that is. But, on the other hand, no one hut a geneticist can ;
make any sense out of them.
Take I)r. Edward Iâ€ž. 'latum, research associate in the School of Biology,
for instance. Not long ago when one of his white-eyed vinegar flies sud-

denly developed distinctly brown
eyes, lie knew just what to think.
As result, it is now known that bac- j
term can "artificially" manufacture a
lmrmond which will cause the larvae i
of white-eyed vinegar Hies to de
velop brown eyes.
TESTING TRYPTOPHANE
Dr. Tatum, working on a project
financed by the Rockefeller Founda
tion, has proved definitely that in- '
.sects are not the only organisms j
able to manufacture the eye-color- !
changing hormone. When the dis
covery was made he was conducting >
an experiment to test, the effect of j
tryptophane, an amino-acid, on eye J
pigment developments in vinegar !
fly larvae.
By mistake one culture became j
contaminated with aerobic bacillus. >
The larvae feeding on the contami- !
nated culture developed a marked
change of eye-color. Although they j
were the offspring of a white-eyed j
strain of fly, the flies at full devel- |
opment had brown eyes.
EVIDENCE CONCLUSIVE
Dr. Tatum has announaed that the
evidence is conclusive that the eye
color change from white to brown is |
due to the ingestion by the larvae of
a specific substance, with hormonal \
activity, which is produced by the i
unknown bacillus only in the pres
ence of tryptophane. Further investi
gation, he adds, may add important
new clues to fuller understanding of
the mechanism of pigmentation.
