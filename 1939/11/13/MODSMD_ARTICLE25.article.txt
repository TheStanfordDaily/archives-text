# Stanford, Cal Doctors Find New Cure for Gas-Gangrene
## 
### 
Dr. Homer V. Hartzell, Stanford 1
physician, and Dr. A. Justin Wil
liams of the University of California
j have successfully carried out experi
] ments proving the possibility of us
[ ing X-rays in the diagnosis, preven-
I tion, and cure of gas-gangrene, it
| was announced in San Francisco last
| Friday.
The two physicians, in a report is
sued from the San Francisco County
Hospital, stated that in a group of
victims to which no X-rays were
administered, the mortality rate was
GO per cent; while in a similar
group treated with the rays, the
mortality rate dropped to 8 per cent.,
In another group there were seven
who had not yet developed the
disease, but were expected to do so
j shortly. None of those who had
i been treated with X-rays contracted
i gangrene, the report said. The re
! port was careful to say that the evi
| dence from this last group was not
conclusive. "We wonder, however, i
about the possibility of preventative
treatment in such cases," it stated.
The doctors made clear in their
report that this treatment was ef
| fective only in the cases of gas-
I gangrene, and that other types of j
| gangrene, such as that developing

from knife or gunshot wounds, could
not be cured by it.
The explanation of the phenomena j
is found in the fact that the gas gan- i
grene microbe cannot live in the !
presence of air, and is exterminated j
by oxygen or oxygen-yielding chem
icals such as hydrogen peroxide.
That hydrogen peroxide is pro
duced by X-rays has already been j
proved by a group of Stanford sei- !
entists headed by Professor C. V.
Taylor of the biology department.
