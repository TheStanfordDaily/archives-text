# Churchill Speech Dims Peace Hope
## Admiralty Lord Sees No Armistice Until Nazi Ideals Purged 
### United Press 
Any flickering hopes of peace or
mediation in Europe's 10-weeks-old
war appeared to have been shattered
irrevocably Sunday night by Win
ston Churchill, British First Lord of
the Admiralty and the man whom
the Nazis hate most.
Churchill, in a radio speech so
filled with bitterness and hate that
even the British government felt
constrained to tone d°wn parts of
it before delivery, challenged Adolf
Hitler to unleash the merciless war
which the Nazis have been threat
ening. He called Hitler a "cornered
maniac," a "monstrous apparition"
and that "evil man over there" and
went back to the hatreds of 1914-
1918 to revive the invective name
"Hun" for the Germans.
There can be no peace until Hit
ler, the Nazi regime and Nazi meth- j
ods of force and aggression are
crushed and destroyed, Churchill
said.
SEES C.S. ALONE'
If Great Britain and France fail
to accomplish this task and are
themselves crushed by the German
war machine, he said, then the world
will be enslaved and "the United
States will be left single-handed to
guard the rights of man."
The United States already is a
moral ally of Britain and France, he
said, and is giving them great sup
port.
Churchill's speech followed by a
few hours the replies of Great Brit
ain and France to last Tuesday's
peace appeal and mediation offers
of Queen Wilhelmina of the Nether
lands and King Leopold 111 of the
Belgians.
BRITAIN WANTS PEACE'
Britain's answer, sent by King
George VI, said that of course Brit
ain wants peace, but Britain's terms
already have been laid down and
that if any new peace proposals are
made they must come from Hitler
and must satisfy Britain's an
nounced war aims—the end of Hit
ler's methods of force and the libera
tion of Poland and Czechoslovakia.
President Albert Lebrun of France
replied in the same manner. Hitler
has merely promised to give "thor
ough study" to the peace appeal.
Thus, the peace move of the two
little lowland nations on the rim of
the war appeared to have been
doomed.
BELGIUM, HOLLAND MENACED
Churchill said in his speech that
the menace of a German invasion of
Holland or Belgium was no figment
of imagination or propaganda but a
real and grave thi'eat.
The Foreign Ministers of the
Netherlands and Belgium met in a
surprise conference Sunday night in
the historic town of Bredna near
their frontier, discussing the situa
tion in the light of the replies to the
Dutch-Belgian peace appeal. Some
quarters reported that the Foreign
Ministers were discussing joint Bel
gian-Dutch action in event of an
emergency.
There were unconfirmed reports in
London diplomatic quarters that
Queen Wilhelmina and King Leo
pold had signed a protocol agree
ing that any German invasion of
either country would automatically
become a violation of the other's se
curity.

and must satisfy Britain's an
nounced war aims—the end of Hit
ler's methods of force and the libera
tion of Poland and Czechoslovakia.
President Albert Lebrun of France
replied in the same manner. Hitler
has merely promised to give "thor
ough study" to the peace appeal.
Thus, the peace move of the two
little lowland nations on the rim of
the war appeared to have been
doomed.
BELGIUM, HOLLAND MENACED
Churchill said in his speech that
the menace of a German invasion of
Holland or Belgium was no figment
of imagination or propaganda but a
real and grave thi'eat.
The Foreign Ministers of the
Netherlands and Belgium met in a
surprise conference Sunday night in
the historic town of Bredna near
their frontier, discussing the situa
tion in the light of the replies to the
Dutch-Belgian peace appeal. Some
quarters reported that the Foreign
Ministers were discussing joint Bel
gian-Dutch action in event of an
emergency.
There were unconfirmed reports in
London diplomatic quarters that
Queen Wilhelmina and King Leo
pold had signed a protocol agree
ing that any German invasion of
either country would automatically
become a violation of the other's se
curity.
Any flickering hopes of peace or
mediation in Europe's 10-weeks-old
war appeared to have been shattered
irrevocably Sunday night by Win
ston Churchill, British First Lord of
the Admiralty and the man whom
the Nazis hate most.
Churchill, in a radio speech so
filled with bitterness and hate that
even the British government felt
constrained to tone d°wn parts of
it before delivery, challenged Adolf
Hitler to unleash the merciless war
which the Nazis have been threat
ening. He called Hitler a "cornered
maniac," a "monstrous apparition"
and that "evil man over there" and
went back to the hatreds of 1914-
1918 to revive the invective name
"Hun" for the Germans.
There can be no peace until Hit
ler, the Nazi regime and Nazi meth- j
ods of force and aggression are
crushed and destroyed, Churchill
said.
SEES C.S. ALONE'
If Great Britain and France fail
to accomplish this task and are
themselves crushed by the German
war machine, he said, then the world
will be enslaved and "the United
States will be left single-handed to
guard the rights of man."
The United States already is a
moral ally of Britain and France, he
said, and is giving them great sup
port.
Churchill's speech followed by a
few hours the replies of Great Brit
ain and France to last Tuesday's
peace appeal and mediation offers
of Queen Wilhelmina of the Nether
lands and King Leopold 111 of the
Belgians.
BRITAIN WANTS PEACE'
Britain's answer, sent by King
George VI, said that of course Brit
ain wants peace, but Britain's terms
already have been laid down and
that if any new peace proposals are
made they must come from Hitler
and must satisfy Britain's an
nounced war aims—the end of Hit
ler's methods of force and the libera
tion of Poland and Czechoslovakia.
President Albert Lebrun of France
replied in the same manner. Hitler
