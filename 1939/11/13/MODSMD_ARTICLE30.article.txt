With a simplicity that amounted
to eloquence, Dr. J. W. Mcßain, pro
fessor of chemistry, told those who
gathered in the Memorial Church
yesterday, to commemorate the 1918
Armistice that, in consideration of a
seemingly imminent chaos, mankind
wquld do well to recall two basic
principles: the fatherhood of God,
and the brotherhood of man.
Comparing these religious funda
mentals to the mainsprings of sci
entific investigation, the two thermo
dynamic laws, Dr. Mcßain asserted
that there were really two things
worth living and dying for, science
and religion.
In his address, Dr. D. Elton True
blood, Stanford chaplain, remarked
that in spite of all claims to the con
trary, he did not believe that the
last war to end war had been fought
totally in vain. He pointed to the
"terrible objection" to war which
Americans are now raising.
