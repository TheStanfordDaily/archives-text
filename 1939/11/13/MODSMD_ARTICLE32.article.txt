# Papooses Climax Season With Win Over Cal, 13-6
## Cole Stars As Redmen Scalp Rivals Card Aerial Attack Spells Cubs' Doom; Hanlon Kicks Goal 
### 
A powerful Stanford freshman j
football team which featured the j
passing and running of a mighty j
midget halfback, "A1 Cole, and the J
defensive strength of a five-man
line turned back its arch rivals, the
California fresh, 13-6.
Coach Harry Shipkey's team cli
maxed its highly successful season
with a flurry of passes in the final
quarter to break up a tie ball game I
and go on to win.
The Cardinal yearlings struck in >
the first seven minutes of the ball j
game. Alter having two potential j
touchdown marches nipped in the
bud by holding penalties, Coach |
Harry Shipkey's men settled down j
to point getting in real earnest.
COLE GOES STRONG
Cole wheeled back 12 yards with |
a California punt to midfield to set |
up a goalward drive which rolled j
those 40 yards in five plays. On first
down little A1 pitched sharply to 1
lowering Ed Stamm on the Cal 40. â– 
Slamm moved 10 yards and then j
lateraled to his running mate, Bill j
Symes who got to the Cub 19.
Cole swept his own right end for :
5 yards, and then Chuck Taylor |
sneaked through left guard for 8 to j
the Cal 7 for another first down, j
Cole tried tackle for no gain and I
then rifled another of his short ]
deadly passes to Symes, who fell I
into scoring territory. On the at- J
tempted conversion the snap from '
center was fumbled by Cole and the |
ball was downed by the Bear Cubs. I
PENETRATE TO 28
Once the Cubs penetrated to the ]
Card 28, but there Shipkey's five- i
man line, ably backed by Taylor, i
Bill Mannon, and Red Laverty, j
reared up to halt the invaders. Man- j
non especially was all over the field j
intercepting two passes and making j
stop after stop. But those persistent I
Bears came right back with a 25- J
yard pass from Pickett to Jim Fer- '
guson which carried way down to ;
the Card 12.
It was Cole who halted this in- :
vasion with an interception on the I
5-yard line which he returned to i
Ihe 12. Then AI punted out of dan- i
ger and the half ended soon after
wards.
FERGUSON RECOVERS
However, those Bears couldn't be |
denied in the second half. Ferguson !
recovered an onside kick-ofi on the j
Papooses to put the Cards in a hole.
After being stopped once again the j
Bears finally tallied on a beautiful
long pass from Pickett to Ferguson |
which gained 42 yards and G points, i
Gordon's conversion went wide.
But in the final quarter the Cards j
came through to bust up the tie and j
win the game which was rightfully j
theirs.
And they did it the hard way,!
moving 63 yards to the Bear goal |
(in three running plays and three |
passes.
Cole, from the Card 27, tossed into
the flat to Tellefsen for 5. Then he j
threw again to Tellefsen on a !
sleeper play which did not click.
Again little A1 was pitching and this I
time it was to Milt Vucinich, who 1
carried a couple of Cal backs down i
to their own 36 before they pulled
him down. j
CLIMAXING RUN
Then came the climaxing run of ,
the game. Cole faded to pass again,!
saw no receiver and scooted away
from a swarm of onrushing Cal i
linemen down the sidelines, reversed i
his field with his pursuers still right i
on his heels, and spun on down to j
the Cal 5.
It took big Milt Vucinich just two j
plays to crunch those 5 yards to the !
winning touchdown and Bill Han
lon, sub quarterback, converted.
The whole Card line was a power j
on defense. Ed McCain and Dick
Palmer knifed through several times 1
to spill the Cal backs before they j
even got started. And Bruno B;in- 1
ducci, Symes and Stamm stopped
most of those vaunted Cal end runs I
and ofl'-tackle slants.
Red Robinson got off towering I
punts just when they were needed as
well as rolling up yardage on re- j
verses to the weak side.
Shipkey admitted that he was
worried for a while but was well 1
pleased with how the Papooses came I
through their crucial battle.
