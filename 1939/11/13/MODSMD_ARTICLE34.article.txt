# Waterdogs Bow To Troy, Bruins
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity water poloists
were definitely put out of the con
ference championship race this
week-end as they bowed to both
U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.
The U.C.L.A. team, which took the
waterdogs to the tune of 5 to 1, re
mained undefeated and took a firmer
hold on first place in the conference
as a result of their victory over the
Cards. Only the Trojans now stand
between them and the championship.
U.S.C., which literally gave away
their last tilt with the Indians by
unwarranted rough playing, this
time managed to keep themselves in
the pool enough to beat decisively
the Cards, 4-1.
