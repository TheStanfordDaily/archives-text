# Card Soccermen Upset Bruins, 9-1
## 
### 
Stanford soccermen were victo
rious for the first time this season
Saturday as they took U.C.L.A., 9
to 1. The Bruins, who have lost only
one game this year, were rated over
the Card team, but the Indians,
smarting under losses to U.S.F. and
San Jose State, took a strong lead
over the Uclans, keeping it to the
end.
U.C.L.A., however, is a non-con
ference team, so the Cards are still
in the league cellar. They meet both
U.S.F. and San Jose State again this
season.
At the end of the 1934 fiscal year,
the cost of the World War to the
United States had reached nearly
42 billion dollars.
