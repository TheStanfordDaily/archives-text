With such luminaries as "Cootie" j
; Thompson in the pass tossing spot, !
! and Howard Hiekingbotham and |
: Bill Hawkins in the front line, the i
i Zetes present a trio of offensive tal- j
! ent that promises to send them
i through to the finals.
! The Sequoia boys, on the other
hand, while perhaps not as out
standing as their opponents, cer
tainly didn't land their position in
i the play-offs on their reputation.
! They play football —good football,
too —and the Zetes will know that
they've had a battle when and il'
they top Sequoia.
The other Monday game is a hard
one to figure, for although Phi Psi
looks like the stronger team, the En
cina gang is the best in all Encina
Hall and won their last game by a
26-to-6 score. However, Sparling
and Boone give the Phi Psis the
' edge in offensive punch.
j The other half of the first round
Ito be played tomorrow will bring
! together El Toro and Delta Chi, and
S Kappa Sigma and the Firehouse.
j The semi-final game in the volley
j ball play-offs between Phi Kappa
| Sigma and El Toro will be played
I tonight at 8 o'clock in Encina Gym.
i The victor will meet Alpha Delta
Phi, defending champs, for the in
tramural volleyball championship of
the university on Tuesday or Wed
inesday.
