Indian sports fans were saved
from a complete shut-out at the
hands of U.S.C. this week-end when
the flying club out-maneuvered
U.S.C.'s flyers 28 to 16 in an air meet
at Los Angeles yesterday.
The Stanford pilots were high in
supply dropping, paper strafing,
and spot-landing contests. Frank
Martin, as president of the flying
club, headed the Stanford entrants.
