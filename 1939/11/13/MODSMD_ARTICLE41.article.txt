# Huskies Rate Cal Over Cards
## 
### 
The Washington Huskies turned
' out to be the first team that both
! Stanford and Cal have met, giving
' a little inside dope as to the relative
; strength of the Big Game rivals.
Coach Jimmy Phelan's eleven,
which tromped on the Bears, 13-7,
| yesterday and barely eked out an
' 8-5 decision over the Indians two
j weeks ago is just about unanimous
' that Cal is tougher than our In
\ dians.
They called Lee Artoe about the
best lineman on the Coast, but must
have forgotten about Stan Andersen,
j who is a whale of a tackle. Cal out-
I gained Washington in scrimmage
I plays, but were out-gained 2-1 in
! passes. Our Indians did just as well
| and were on foreign grounds to boot.
Cal won its first and only confer
' ence game from the Cougars three
j weeks ago. Saturday Cal faces
i Oregon State, losers only to El Troje
and victors over their arch state
rivals, Oregon's Webfoots, 19-14,
i this week-end.
Both Lon Stiner's and Tex Oliver's
outfits were even on touchdowns
j with two apiece, but a field goal and
j safety provided the winning margin.
