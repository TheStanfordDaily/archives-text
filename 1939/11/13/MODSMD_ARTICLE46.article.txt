# Big Man on the Block
## 
### 
EVENTS of the last week-end have brought
to a head more forcefully than ever the
strained relationships in Stanford football
circles.
Probably the first campus evidences of a
break-down in morale came at the U.S.C. rally
Thursday when a former high student official,
keynoting the assembly in the absence of the
student body president, mumbled a few inco
herent words about the fact that we were
doomed anyway, so let's just lie down and die
like brave little soldiers before it's too late.
It was the first time in four long years that
any student or guest speaker had spoken of
anything but victory, upset wins, and the brav
ery of the Big Red Machine. It was the first sign
in four years of a general let-down in student
opinion.
On Saturday morning and early afternoon,
several well-known Bay area writers who had
seldom spoken anything but kind words about
Tiny Thornhill released "authoritative" stories
in which they indicated that the big, personally
popular mentor was through as head coach.
One of these stories was supposed to have
come from one of Thornhill's own players.
All this adverse publicity, moreover, was in
the hands of readers several hours before the
now immortal Jones Offensive in the Southland.
The most logical statement was one in which
a morning sports editor, himself a loyal yet
not too rabid Stanford booster, predicted that
the smiling veteran could not continue in the
face of overwhelming alumni opposition unless
an equally strong array of students and players
united to fight the raiders from the outside
world.
Current campus comment, despite a total
absence of derogatory material in The Daily,
plus false enthusiasm such as the former high
official displayed last Thursday, would seem 'to
indicate that the students don't care to back
Thornhill. This feeling, too, was created long
before the latest debacle. It has been no one
game in four years that has ired the students
who have respected Thornhill for the true
and decent fellow that he is. Anything they
hold against his coaching now is a culmination
of all the lean Saturdays since 1935.
Of course Tiny is a swell guy, they have said,
but we've got to have big time coaching to stay
in a big time league, don't we?
These comments, too, are not relative to the
current massacre. U.S.C. can be kept out of the
present conversation if for no other reason than
that no degree of coaching or inspiration could
have enabled the slim Stanford squad to lick
the might of Troy.
But there are those experts who will tell you
that no Stanford team ever looked any worse
than the one which bowed so easily to a not-too
great Santa Clara eleven. It took a team like
that to make Bowl material out of a run-of-the
mill Santa Clara eleven.
Player support? Well, probably less than
half a dozen of the whole squad would not fight
for Tiny as a man if any issue ever arose. But
don't ask them too many questions about his
coaching technique. A good majority of them
draw the line there.
Of course, Tiny is an easy-going leader. He
never forces his edicts or sets rigid training
rules. Some of his men like the leisurely rou
tine, hence ihey play and train at spasmodic
intervals.
All this may or may not be Thornhill's fault.
Time alone will prove that. But we can't deny
that the big man has a helluva fight on his
hands, what with the great, accumulated snow
ball of opinion threatening to break down his
front door any day now.
And it will take somebody far more powerful
and influential a mere campus newspaper
to work out the solution.
But the problem is there.—A. J.

never forces his edicts or sets rigid training
rules. Some of his men like the leisurely rou
tine, hence ihey play and train at spasmodic
intervals.
All this may or may not be Thornhill's fault.
Time alone will prove that. But we can't deny
that the big man has a helluva fight on his
hands, what with the great, accumulated snow
ball of opinion threatening to break down his
front door any day now.
And it will take somebody far more powerful
and influential a mere campus newspaper
to work out the solution.
But the problem is there.—A. J.
EVENTS of the last week-end have brought
to a head more forcefully than ever the
strained relationships in Stanford football
circles.
Probably the first campus evidences of a
break-down in morale came at the U.S.C. rally
Thursday when a former high student official,
keynoting the assembly in the absence of the
student body president, mumbled a few inco
herent words about the fact that we were
doomed anyway, so let's just lie down and die
like brave little soldiers before it's too late.
It was the first time in four long years that
any student or guest speaker had spoken of
anything but victory, upset wins, and the brav
ery of the Big Red Machine. It was the first sign
in four years of a general let-down in student
opinion.
On Saturday morning and early afternoon,
several well-known Bay area writers who had
seldom spoken anything but kind words about
Tiny Thornhill released "authoritative" stories
in which they indicated that the big, personally
popular mentor was through as head coach.
One of these stories was supposed to have
come from one of Thornhill's own players.
All this adverse publicity, moreover, was in
the hands of readers several hours before the
now immortal Jones Offensive in the Southland.
The most logical statement was one in which
a morning sports editor, himself a loyal yet
not too rabid Stanford booster, predicted that
the smiling veteran could not continue in the
face of overwhelming alumni opposition unless
an equally strong array of students and players
united to fight the raiders from the outside
world.
Current campus comment, despite a total
absence of derogatory material in The Daily,
plus false enthusiasm such as the former high
official displayed last Thursday, would seem 'to
indicate that the students don't care to back
Thornhill. This feeling, too, was created long
before the latest debacle. It has been no one
game in four years that has ired the students
who have respected Thornhill for the true
and decent fellow that he is. Anything they
hold against his coaching now is a culmination
of all the lean Saturdays since 1935.
Of course Tiny is a swell guy, they have said,
but we've got to have big time coaching to stay
in a big time league, don't we?
These comments, too, are not relative to the
current massacre. U.S.C. can be kept out of the
present conversation if for no other reason than
that no degree of coaching or inspiration could
have enabled the slim Stanford squad to lick
the might of Troy.
But there are those experts who will tell you
that no Stanford team ever looked any worse
than the one which bowed so easily to a not-too
great Santa Clara eleven. It took a team like
that to make Bowl material out of a run-of-the
mill Santa Clara eleven.
Player support? Well, probably less than
half a dozen of the whole squad would not fight
for Tiny as a man if any issue ever arose. But
don't ask them too many questions about his
coaching technique. A good majority of them
draw the line there.
Of course, Tiny is an easy-going leader. He
never forces his edicts or sets rigid training
rules. Some of his men like the leisurely rou
tine, hence ihey play and train at spasmodic
intervals.
All this may or may not be Thornhill's fault.
