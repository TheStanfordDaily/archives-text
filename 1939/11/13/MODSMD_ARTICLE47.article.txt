# Down to the Last 700

ANY way you look at it, at least 700 Stanford
women at this point do not have dates for
Big Game night.
That may prove either: (1) Stanford men right
from the beginning are afraid of the old 3-1
ratio; or (2) Stanford men are being cagey this
year.

But one thing is clear. There are very few
Stanford men who do not want to go out Big
Game night. That the Big Game decides the
conference cellar title makes no difference at
all. It will be a good game, a game Stanford
should win. It will be played here on the Farm,
and it will attract a Stadium-filling crowd. Only
a congenital celibate can remain aloof from
the inevitable holiday spirit to the point of
simply going home and to bed.
And at this point at least 700 Stanford women
do not have dates.
The brief Daily survey shows a few rather
interesting things about these women; or rather,
about Stanford women in general. In the first
place, from here it looks as if this year's frosh
class will not take the traditional sophomore
slump: it hasn't risen high enough to be able
to slump. There are 250 women in Roble. Be
tween 75 and 100 of them have dates Big Game
night.
Not too good when you realize that approxi
mately 202 of 261 sorority women are dated—
and all sorority women are not juniors and
seniors.
Of course a higher percentage of Row women
have dates than Hall women. That is traditional.
Sociology professors might call it the Stanford
man's tendency toward the sheep instinct.
Nevertheless, the old ratio gag (or intrinsic
cageyness) has scared the mob away from one
of the reputedly more popular sororities. At
this point that house has 13 have-nots.
But Roble is the only female living group
with less than one-third of its members dated.
Poor '43.
In spite of the fact that a list of figures is rare
meat to anyone at all inclined to draw Con
clusions from Statistics, this Daily survey has
proved one interesting fact:
There are plenty of dates left on the campus
for anyone wanting to go out that night —and
you will need a date to get into the Millbrae
Country Club Big Game night.—D. J.

for anyone wanting to go out that night —and
you will need a date to get into the Millbrae
Country Club Big Game night.—D. J.
ANY way you look at it, at least 700 Stanford
women at this point do not have dates for
Big Game night.
That may prove either: (1) Stanford men right
from the beginning are afraid of the old 3-1
ratio; or (2) Stanford men are being cagey this
year.

But one thing is clear. There are very few
Stanford men who do not want to go out Big
Game night. That the Big Game decides the
conference cellar title makes no difference at
all. It will be a good game, a game Stanford
should win. It will be played here on the Farm,
and it will attract a Stadium-filling crowd. Only
a congenital celibate can remain aloof from
the inevitable holiday spirit to the point of
simply going home and to bed.
And at this point at least 700 Stanford women
do not have dates.
The brief Daily survey shows a few rather
interesting things about these women; or rather,
about Stanford women in general. In the first
place, from here it looks as if this year's frosh
class will not take the traditional sophomore
slump: it hasn't risen high enough to be able
to slump. There are 250 women in Roble. Be
tween 75 and 100 of them have dates Big Game
night.
Not too good when you realize that approxi
mately 202 of 261 sorority women are dated—
and all sorority women are not juniors and
seniors.
Of course a higher percentage of Row women
have dates than Hall women. That is traditional.
Sociology professors might call it the Stanford
man's tendency toward the sheep instinct.
Nevertheless, the old ratio gag (or intrinsic
cageyness) has scared the mob away from one
of the reputedly more popular sororities. At
this point that house has 13 have-nots.
But Roble is the only female living group
with less than one-third of its members dated.
Poor '43.
In spite of the fact that a list of figures is rare
meat to anyone at all inclined to draw Con
clusions from Statistics, this Daily survey has
proved one interesting fact:
There are plenty of dates left on the campus
for anyone wanting to go out that night —and
you will need a date to get into the Millbrae
Country Club Big Game night.—D. J.
