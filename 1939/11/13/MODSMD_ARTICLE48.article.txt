TRICKY DICK
A CHILD very often will say something fantastic or
go into an acted hysteria to attract attention. One
is not amazed by such actions, appropriate as they are'
to puberty. But when a chronologically mature writer
uses such infantilisms, the effect is rather more annoy
ing. Dick Hyland's sports column, "Behind the Line,"
is a case in point. Apparently afflicted with an ego
deflating lack of attention, Stanford's self-banished
halfback succeeded in stirring comment by writing
one of the most insipid, childish criticisms of his Alma
Mater ever to be conceived by a bilious brain.
It isn't alone that Stanford football teams have
been losing. I'm-a-great-guy Hyland observes, as he
sentimentally recalls the days when he used to cavort
in a football suit. It's because the whole school has
lost the great spirit it used to have, he goes on, catch
ing "a lump in his throat as big as a football."
The specific criticisms that Tricky Dick (as he was
called) levels at the school which "he no longer
claims as his" are almost as ludicrous as the self
martyring capers he cuts in general: (.1) Stanford spent
time to get a new boathouse. (2) The Daily conducted
a poll investigating student opinion on willingness to
fight in case of invasion. (3) A column appeared in
the Daily on what the well dressed man will wear
to teas.
* * * #
|F IT were not the fact that stupidity is sometimes
as infuriating as it is ridiculous. Tricky Dick's com
ments would not even be worth answering. Had he
read beyond his apparent capacity—that is, beyond the
leadlines —he would have found (1) that the old boat
louse literally decayed under our feet and fell into
Ihe lake before we replaced it; (2) that the Daily war
poll, conducted in conjunction with similar ones in
all large American colleges, was doing a job in the
interests of intelligent peace; and (3) that the fashions
column, of which Tricky Dick apparently read the
title, was a satire that could not be missed by anyone,
even one who inhabits Hollywood and wears the gay
casual outfits of a Los Angeles sports writer.
The degeneracy of Stanford spirit, it seems, is in
the publicity-hungry head of one of its graduates, not
in the minds of Stanford men. There is a plausible
story about Tricky Dick when he played the football
to which he devotes a large part of his column. It
seems that he used to bow to the stands as he tripped
past the rooting section. Obviously, he has never re
covered from this peculiar habit.
We haven't won football games recently, like your
newly adopted Trojans, Dick. But we can't work up
much grief over having lost you. The Stanford name
and spirit are far above your head and the muscular
necks of U.S.C.'s lone claim to fame.
And yet, it's a little sad to see a man earn his living
in the Trojan camp by villifying his Alma Mater.
Thirty pieces of silver for Tricky Dick. But he's being
overpaid.

column, of which Tricky Dick apparently read the
title, was a satire that could not be missed by anyone,
even one who inhabits Hollywood and wears the gay
casual outfits of a Los Angeles sports writer.
The degeneracy of Stanford spirit, it seems, is in
the publicity-hungry head of one of its graduates, not
in the minds of Stanford men. There is a plausible
story about Tricky Dick when he played the football
to which he devotes a large part of his column. It
seems that he used to bow to the stands as he tripped
past the rooting section. Obviously, he has never re
covered from this peculiar habit.
We haven't won football games recently, like your
newly adopted Trojans, Dick. But we can't work up
much grief over having lost you. The Stanford name
and spirit are far above your head and the muscular
necks of U.S.C.'s lone claim to fame.
And yet, it's a little sad to see a man earn his living
in the Trojan camp by villifying his Alma Mater.
Thirty pieces of silver for Tricky Dick. But he's being
overpaid.
TRICKY DICK
A CHILD very often will say something fantastic or
go into an acted hysteria to attract attention. One
is not amazed by such actions, appropriate as they are'
to puberty. But when a chronologically mature writer
uses such infantilisms, the effect is rather more annoy
ing. Dick Hyland's sports column, "Behind the Line,"
is a case in point. Apparently afflicted with an ego
deflating lack of attention, Stanford's self-banished
halfback succeeded in stirring comment by writing
one of the most insipid, childish criticisms of his Alma
Mater ever to be conceived by a bilious brain.
It isn't alone that Stanford football teams have
been losing. I'm-a-great-guy Hyland observes, as he
sentimentally recalls the days when he used to cavort
in a football suit. It's because the whole school has
lost the great spirit it used to have, he goes on, catch
ing "a lump in his throat as big as a football."
The specific criticisms that Tricky Dick (as he was
called) levels at the school which "he no longer
claims as his" are almost as ludicrous as the self
martyring capers he cuts in general: (.1) Stanford spent
time to get a new boathouse. (2) The Daily conducted
a poll investigating student opinion on willingness to
fight in case of invasion. (3) A column appeared in
the Daily on what the well dressed man will wear
to teas.

|F IT were not the fact that stupidity is sometimes
as infuriating as it is ridiculous. Tricky Dick's com
ments would not even be worth answering. Had he
read beyond his apparent capacity—that is, beyond the
leadlines —he would have found (1) that the old boat
louse literally decayed under our feet and fell into
Ihe lake before we replaced it; (2) that the Daily war
poll, conducted in conjunction with similar ones in
all large American colleges, was doing a job in the
