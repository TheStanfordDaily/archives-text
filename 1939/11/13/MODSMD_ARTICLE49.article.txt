MORONS THROW EGGS

HP HE EDITOR, SIR:
So they call this Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity! Ha! Ha! Ha! What a laugh. After witnessing
the exhibition of the tomato and egg throwers during
the parade and pep rally in the Pavilion, I'm con
vinced that the name of this institution should be
changed to Leland Stanford Junior High School to
make these supposedly Stanford men feel at home.
It's quite evident that they don't possess the mental
capacity of a college student becaues no one but a
moron would attempt to start a riot, even if the cause
was justified, when he is outnumbered approximately
a hundred-fold. However, my admiration is with the
frosh for obeying the upperclassmen when they quieted
their attempt at a return engagement, though I would
have liked to have seen the boys of '43 get their re
venge on this "stinking 1 per cent" (Frosh Bible,
page 43).
Don't let the above mislead you into believing that
I'm a dead beat, a dry ball, or lacking in school spirit.
The fellows in my corridor will readily verify that I
can make as much, if not more, noise and show just
as much spirit as the most energetic College Humor or
Holly wood freshman.
