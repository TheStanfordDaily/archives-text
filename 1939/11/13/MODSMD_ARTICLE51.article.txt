SACRAMENTO, Nov. 12 (UP).â€”

economic distress of old people, to
night proposed a uniform federal
old age pension of $50 to $00 monthly
to needy citizens over GO.
In a statewide radio broadcast,
Olson announced he will recommend
passage of a bill in the state Legis
lature providing for the payment of
California's share of this proposed
pension.
