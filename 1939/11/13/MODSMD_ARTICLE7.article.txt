'"The Dream Play'' lay August
Strinburg will be presented in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
nights. Those performances are
studio productions given by the
technique of acting class.
Strinburg's "Dream Play" is an
attempt to imitate the disconnected,
but seemingly logical form of the
dream. On an insignificant back
ground the imagination weaves novel
and strange patterns. And the whole
is a conglomeration of memories,
experiences, free fancies, absurdities
and improvisations.
LARGE CAST
Over 30 different persons appear at
one time or another in the play, and
10 more off-stage voices are used.
The dance interlude, which is in
terpolated into action, is under the
direction of Margaret Jewell.
One consciousness reigns over the |
whole play â€” that of the dreamer.}
Before it, there are no secrets, no
incongruities, no scruples, no laws.
DREAMER SYMBOLIZED
A character called the "Daughter I
of Indra" symbolizes the dreamer.
The daughter of the great god Indra,
she descends to earth during a
dream, to discover why men arc
always complaining and always un
happy. In the play there is no judg
ment or exoneration, merely nar
ration.
Tickets for all performances an 1 :
50 cents. Holders of script books
will be admitted free of charge.
