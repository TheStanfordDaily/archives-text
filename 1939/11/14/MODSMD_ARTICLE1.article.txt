### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
WINTER anna silent leges"â€”as the
battle begins the laws become
silent.
Such was the pragmatic rule by
which nations once conducted their
international affairs. In fact, the
powers still follow, very largely, the
adages of their imperialistic Roman
predecessors. Once in a while,
though, some master move in the
bitter game of,diplomacy revives a
flagging belief that idealism still has
a place outside a Boy Scout camp
or a church.
Neutrality of independent nations,
though it has come in for a lot of
buffeting, still holds a faint claim to
the respect of the dictators. Ger
many last night reaffirmed her
pledge to observe the neutrality of
Holland and Belgium "so long as
Britain and France respect this neu
trality" and said the low countries
have nothing to fear from the Reich
if they maintain an impartial stand.
* * *
JHE reaffirmed pledge, in the
form of an officially-inspired
statement handed to the foreign
press, followed by a few hours the
radio speech of Dutch Premier
Dirk Jan DeGeer who said the
Netherlands has full faith in the
promises of all the belligerents re
garding Holland's inviolability of
her frontiers.
Nazi leaders lost no time in wel
coming DeGeer's speech and pinning
all the blame for the "false rumors"
of German invasion on England. The
statement was merely a polite word
of caution to the low countries to
refrain from any support of Britain's
naval blockade of Germany, the re
sults of which must already be caus
ing the Nazis some concern. The
German press and spokesman of Hit
ler during the last ten days have
accused the Dutch and Belgians of
"submitting" to the British blockade
measures in a manner jeopardizing
their neutral status. Precisely what
the two small neutral powers could
do besides "submit" to the European
blockade, the NazLs didn't say. They
simply reiterated their cry that the
Allied war aim is to "create in
creased uneasiness in Europe."
In crushing opposition to any re
spect of "ardent neutrality" was the
curt United Press dispatch from
Moscow that negotiations on Rus
sia's military and territorial de
mands against neutral Finland came
to a "definite end" yesterday when
(he Finnish mission left, for Helsinki
and the Soviet press warned Finland
is "on the brink of ruin."

r jpHE breakdown of the month-long
dickering, due to Finland's stub
born refusal to cede military bases
to Russia, brought relations between
the two countries to a critical stage.
But, so far, Russia has given no in
dication that the Soviet bear will
resort to military action. There was
no poising of troops along the Finn
ish border, no midnight meetings
between Molotov, Stalin, and special
envoys from the threatened nation,
no "eleventh-hour ultimatums."
For Russia realizes too well that
the iron-bound, strong-arm tac
tics that forced the small, inde
pendent nations of Latvia, Lith
uania, and Esthonia to rubber
stamp all Soviet demands, won't
work in the case of Finland. In
short, Finland is a tough nut to
crack.

Because she pays her war debts
faithfully, like a good, middle-class
clerk mailing his tax check to the
government, the United States likes
Finland. Stubbornly, sincerely, she
has gone ahead with plans to hold
the 1910 Olympics in Helsinki. The
United States has always admired
"the stiff upper lip in the face of
trouble." No war is going to down
us, Finland says. In the Greek era
they used to stop wars for the
Olympics. They can do it again, she
thinks.
And so, with the sympathy of the
civilized world and the tacit verbal
backing of the world's strongest
neutral nation, the Finns are holding
out against odds that even Stanford's
battered Indian eleven hasn't faced
yet.
