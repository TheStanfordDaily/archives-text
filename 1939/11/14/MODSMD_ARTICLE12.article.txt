# Play Will Have Dream Setting
## Studio Drama Opens Season Tomorrow 
### 
Strindberg's "Dream Play," which
will be presented tomorrow, Thurs
day, and Friday nights in the Little
Theater of Memorial Hall, presents
enormous technical problems to the
director.
Director Waldemar Johansen has
planned to use a little-known De
bussy composition to provide a mel
ancholy background theme for the
unhappy spirit of the play.
The dreamer, called "Daughter of
Indra" is the only character who is
in every scene. Played by Serena
Frankel, the dreamer is the daughter
of a god who descends to earth to
discover why men are always un
happy.
Two other characters appear from
time to time throughout, the action.
These are the Poet, played by Bucky
Henshaw, and the Officer, played by
Tom O'Leary. The other 18 charac
ters appear at intervals throughout
the play, but their entrances and ex
its have the lack of motivation char
acteristic of a dream.
Tickets for any performance are
50 cents. Script, book holders will be
admitted free. According to Walde
mar Johansen, all students coming
in a party of five or more, will get a
special rate of 25 cents.
