# Rushing Teas To Be Given By Sororities
## New Women Receive Bids Today; Quad Clothes Are Vogue 
### 
Freshman and transfer women will
receive invitations today for teas this
Friday and Sunday from 3 to 5:30
o'clock, and for dessert parties this
Saturday from 7 to 9:30 o'clock at
the Row's nine sorority houses, ac
cording 1o Jeanne Cutler, president
of the Panhellenic Council.
An innovation this year, the des
sert affairs have been planned in
stead of the usual Saturday tea in
order that women may attend the
Washington State football game that
afternoon, she explained.
TAGS TO BE WORN
Name tags will be worn, also for
the first time this year, and each
woman is responsible for making
out her own. In line with this year's
keynote of informality, quad clothes
will be worn to all functions, includ
ing the Saturday evening dessert
parties.
All invitations should be answered
and must be returned to sponsors by
noon tomorrow, Miss Cutler stressed.
Women may visit as many houses as
they receive invitations for each day,
she added.
SPONSORS WILL ADVISE
New women are advised to see
their sponsors for any further in
formation or for answers to any
questions which arise. Those receiv
ing invitations who do not live in
university residences should contact
Alice James, off-campus sponsor.
The teas and dessert parties are
the only affairs to be held for new
women by the sororities prior to the
regular rush period early next,
quarter.
