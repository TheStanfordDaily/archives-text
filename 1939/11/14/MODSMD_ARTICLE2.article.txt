# Nazi Planes Raid Britain, Scout Paris
## Goering Ships Inflict Slight Damage, Act As Warning to Allies 
### United Press 
Field Marshal Hermann Goering's
Nazi aii' force lifted the war out of
the doldrums Monday with a bomb
ing raid on the British Isles and
daring reconnaissance flights over
Paris. Although damage was in
significant the increased German
aerial activity might indicate that
Goering is preparing to carry out
his recent threat to "rain down"
destruction on the Allies because of
their rejection of Adolf Hitler's Oct.
6 peace bid.
The war on the high seas also came
back to life, with both the Allies and
Germany suffering losses.
Two German merchant ships were
sunk by British warships, a British
merchantman went down between
England and Spain, and the 7,745-
ton British passenger liner Sirdhana
sank off Singapore, supposedly after
striking an "escaped" mine guarding
the entrance to the vital British naval
base in the Far East. Twenty per
sons, including 11 passengers, lost
their lives at Singapore.
BOMB SHETLAND ISLANDS
German bombers swept north
westward across the North Sea in
two flights Monday and bombed the
desolate Shetland Islands 150 miles
off the northern tip of Scotland. It
was the third actual bombing of the
British Isles in 10 weeks of war.
The Nazi air force also put in an
appearance off the east coast of
England where British and German
planes battled and a wing was re
ported to have been shot off a Ger
man flying boat. The Nazi pilot
dove into the clouds and disappeared.
The Nazi planes which flew twice
over Paris and its suburbs during
the day were on reconnaissance
rather than bombing missions but
their appearance resulted in casual
ties—three civilians wounded by
fragments of anti-aircraft shells.
SINK FOUR SHIPS
The sinking of British and Ger
man merchant ships was followed by
a Nazi warning early today that
British and French passenger and
merchant ships are known to be
armed and will be "treated as enemy
warships" if the German navy en
counters them at sea.
The widespread fears and rumors
of an impending Nazi invasion of
Holland abated considerably Mon
day, but Finland's troubles with
Russia became sharply more acute.
Germany last night reaffirmed Hit
ler's pledge to respect the neutrality
of both Holland and Belgium and
accused British and French propa
ganda of building up a "Nazi scare"
where none existed.
A month of stubborn negotiations
in Moscow on the Soviets' demands
for military and territorial conces
sions from Finland—the same sort
of concessions which Russia ob
tained almost overnight from Esto
nia, Latvia and Lithuania—came to
a complete deadlock Monday night.
The Finnish mission of negotiators
left Moscow.
