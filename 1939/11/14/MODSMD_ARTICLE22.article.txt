# Continental War to Be Series Topic
## Farm Professors To Conduct Tuesday Evening Symposium 
### 
Graham Stuart, professor of po
litical science, Karl Brandt, econ
omist and professor of agricultural
economics, and David Harris, asso
ciate professor of history, will con
duct a symposium on "The Euro
pean War" at the regular Tuesday
Evening Lecture tonight at 7:30
o'clock in Memorial Hall.
"The present war is being fought
more fiercely by the diplomats than
by the generals. Since the quick
and overwhelming destruction of
Poland, there has been practically a
stalemate on land, on sea, and in the
air, but from Murmansk to the Dar
danelles the struggle for allies and
benevolent neutrals has been un
ceasing and bitterly contested," said
Professor Stuart in explaining the
subject he is to cover. He will out
line the cburse of politics and diplo
macy since Sept. 1.
TRACES TREATY
Professor Harris will outline the
immediate historical background of
the war. He will trace the Treaty of
Versailles as the starting point for
modern developments, the failure of
the victorious powers to enforce it,
the rise of Germany, the attitudes of
the French and British, the aliena
tion of British sympathy by Hitler
followed by the British attempts to
halt German expansion.
A discussion of the commitment to
Poland, the failure of Anglo-Rus
sian negotiations, and the diplomacy
of the late summer will bring the
review to the point where Professor
Stuart's discussion begins.
RESOURCES DISCUSSED
Professor Brandt will discuss the
economic resources of the present
belligerents. He will point out that
the economic issues are not clear
cut, may change under changing
circumstances, and that there is little
promise of a short war by virtue of
economic necessity alone.
The Committee on Public Exer
cises has announced that the public
address system which failed at last
Tuesday's lecture has been re
adjusted.
