### 
Conducting a survey in Palo Alto on John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of
Wrath," the Palo Alto Times announced yesterday that 22 per cent of
residents over 21 years of age have read it, and that of this number only 17
per cent believe the author exaggerated social conditions appreciably.
Opinions of many persons interviewed who had read only portions of

the book were not counted in the,
survey. Explaining "it's hard to get,"
scores of others stated they wanted
to read it. According to the Times,
the survey indicates that within a
tew weeks as many as two persons
in five will have read the hook.
CHARACTERS COLORED?
It, was found in Redwood City,
where a similar survey was made
for the Redwood City Tribune, that
only 13 per cent of the people over
21 years had read the book.
To the question, "Do you think the
things said and done by characters
in thus book are true to life 01
colored?" Forty per cent of the read
ers answered "true to life,' 20 pet
cent replied "slightly colored," anc
40 per cent, "colored.'
"Do you think the author portrayec
a true social condition, or did he ex
aggerate?" was another question, to
which 41 per cent replied "true to
life," 41 per cent, "slightly exag
gerated," and 17 per cent "exagger
ated."
SURVEY MADE
The survey was made for the
Times by Dan E. Clark, as part of a
project of study he is doing as a
journalism fellow at Stanford.
Clark said that on an independent
survey in which he was trying to
find whether most people read
library copies of the hook or copies
they themselves had bought, he
found that more people bought the
book than took it from the library.
The Stanford Bookstore led all Palo
Alto stores in the number of books
sold.
