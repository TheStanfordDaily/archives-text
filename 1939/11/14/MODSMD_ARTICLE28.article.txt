## 
### 
1 WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (UP).â€”
Two candidates for the 1940 Repub
lican Presidential nomination pre
pared a new invasion of the West
today, while a third G.O.P. leader
warned the party it would encourage
third-term agitation by playing poli
tics with President Roosevelt's for
eign policies.
The quest for western delegates
will be begun this week by Senators
Robert A. Taft of Ohio and H. Styles
Bridges of New Hampshire. Both
hurried back to the capital from the
Pacific Coast when the President
called Congress in special session.
