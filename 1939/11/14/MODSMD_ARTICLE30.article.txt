# Ross Continues Psych Exams
## Juniors Must Finish Quizzes This Week 
### 
Unless every member of the junior
class who took the attitude-interest
test as a freshman retakes the exam
ination now, the value of two years'
research will be lost according to
Dr. Robert T. Ross, assistant profes
sor of psychology.
Because of this fact Dr. Ross has
arranged for the 50 per cent of the
class of '41 not tested last week to
complete the 40-minute quiz any
day this week in room 398 from 9
to 4 o'clock.
Dr. Ross, in collaboration with Dr.
L. M. Terman, noted psychologist of
the Stanford department, is seeking
to determine the stability of various
types of test questions to facilitate
greater accuracy in that field as well
as to prove the variation of the col
lege student's attitudes during un
dergraduate life.
In using the test results of only
those students who co-operated in
appearing for the examination last
week, an exclusive type of person
ality will be obtained.
So that two hours of tabulation
required for each of the 1937 tests
will not be wasted, Dr. Ross an
nounced that he plans to contact
every junior student yet to be tested.
