## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Tiny Shifts Line-up Again As Indians Resume Drill For Battle with Cougars Cards Lose Coldiron, Templeton; Verdieck Goes to Quarterback As In juries Hit Stanford Varsity 
### 
Everyone but Tiny ThornhHl's gang lias been throwing passes in the
Pacific Coast Conference dice game.
The dealer's luck in staving oil repeated thrusts by our Indians who 1
are tlying to salvage a victory can't last. It just isn't in the cards for them
to keep on losing.
The law of averages has it that the Indians are overdue. And when
they start throwing passes on the table themselves, then they're hound
lo have their share of the —

winnings. t
CAL TAKES COURAGE
Stanford starts out on this new j
theory Saturday afternoon, shaking j
the dice with the Washington State j
Cougars. Coach Babe Hollingbery's 1
eleven had its lucky break against ,
Washington's Huskies three weeks
ago. Cal, the only other team which
has come through with a "seven,' :
took the Cougars. Now it's Stan- i
ford's turn to clean the Northerners.
Passes usually come in twos —that
means W.S.C., then Cal, and if all is
gambled it may mean the Ivy (
League's pride, Dartmouth.
Dadly bruised and battered, the
Indians took to the practice field yes
terday, but did little more than run !
through old plays.
CAUSES GRIEF
The Trojan debacle produced two ,
major causes for grief in the Stan- j
lord camp—knee injuries to both j
quarterbacks, Gene Coldiron and i
Bobby Templeton, who are out of
the Cougar tilt. Corky Donahue still j
hasn't a chance to see action until
the Big Game.
Tiny took one of his best linemen j
yesterday to play quarter. He's Jim j
Verdieck, the center. Verdieck al- j
ready backs up the line and will be j
familiar with that job, but he had ;
lots of help yesterday learning the j
blocking assignments from Tiny and j
Bones Hamilton. Doug Stahle and <
Colin McClintock worked in place !
of Verdieck. Bob Crane and Chet I
Patton were also at quarter.
