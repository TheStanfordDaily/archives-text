# Soccermen Drill For Hear Game
## 
### 
Fresh from a smashing 9-1 tri- |
umph over U.C.L.A., Card soccer- j
men will continue their conference j
season this week with games sched- ;
nled against San Francisco Junior J
College and the California Bears. j
Wilson Clark seems to be the fac- I
tor that was needed to give the I
Indians a potent forward wall. The
defense has been strong all season,
but the hooters have been having |
trouble scoring against the better I
teams of the league.
Saturday the Cards will cross the |
bay for their first game against the |
high-flying California Bears. Cal |
hooters are Undefeated in conference |
play, although they have been tied by j
San Jose State and U.S.C.
