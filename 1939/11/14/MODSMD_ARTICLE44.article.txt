REFLECTIONS ON
LAST WEEK-END
The game ... To say that U.S-C
has the finest team in the country is
a misleading statement. What the
Trojans have in reality is the finesl
series of teams â€”three of them, anc
one as good as the other. . .. Coach
Howard Jones' men do NOT have
an impenetrable defense (as evi
denced by Stanford's over 200 yards
gained from scrimmage) but no teair
in the country can hold up against
their wealth of reserves . . .
Ken Robesky, who played over twe
quarters at right guard, relates thai
he had four different men face him
"and the third string man was bet
ter than the regular." Robesky felt
elated at one point of the game
when he had a man his own size op
posite him whom he was gradually
wearing down. "Then just as I was
ready to go to town, - ' says Ken, "they
put in another man who outweighed
me by 30 pounds." . . .
Harry Smith, U.S.C.'s all-Ameri
can guard, is, I daresay, one of the
fastest linemen in the country for
pulling out and running interfer
ence. It's almost phenomenal the
way that boy gets out ahead of
the ball-carrier. ... On one par
ticular play, Stanford's C-12. the
Indians were making ground con
sistently over Smith, who was
playing wide on defense and leav
ing a bole in the center of the line.
The Indians sent Norm Standlec
through the hole for 6 yards on one
play, and immediately started kid
ding the husky Trojan. Smith dug
in. waiting to murder the next
play, hut the Indians nonchalant
ly repeated the C-12 signal, and
Stand lee went past the fuming
Smith for 1 more yards . . .

Incidentally, the Trojans unani
mously admitted that Standlee was
the hardest hitting backfield man
that any of them had ever run up
against in their respective careers,
while the Indians have a wholesome
respect for Bob Hoffman.
One tragic aspect of the trip was
Corky Donahue, injured right tackle,
visiting his brother Burch, who until
stricken with infantile paralysis a
few weeks ago was first-string quar
terback at Loyola. Burch may pos
sibly be crippled for several years,
at least . . .
MEANDERING ABOUT
THE SOCIAL RIALTO
Colin McClintock knocking off
Marlcne Dietrich's boot - shaped
hat while dancing at the Beverly-
Wilshire. and her uncombed hair
tumbling down, causing her no end
of embarrassment. . . . Corky
Donahue, hobbling on his crutches
through car after car of the foot
ball players' train to get Ginger
Rogers' autograph on his baggage
check. . . Stanford's football
players ogling Iledy Lamarr at the
Biltmorc Bowl . . .
