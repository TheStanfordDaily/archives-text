tNCLUDED in ex-Stanford Man Dick Hyland's
1 column disowning his alma mater and de
nouncing her football team in the Los Angeles
Times last week was the remark that anyone
who asks in a campus peace poll, "Would you
fight in case the territorial United States was
invaded?" should be either punched silly or
ignored as a neophyte going through a fra
ternity initiation.
Although completely unintelligent, this atti
tude is a not-unusual product of college life in
the crazy decade between the War and the
Depression. In those years of bathtub gin and
"it" and flaming youth, it was considered cor
rect to ignore the world's problems and to for
get its troubles.
The present university generation has a dif
ferent attitude. Having lived its pre-adolescent
years in the 'twenties, it ran into a great finan
cial depression as soon as it began to learn
what life was about. It graduated from high
school facing the greatest unemployment prob
lem the country has ever known. And it en
tered college amid the uncertain rumblings of
threatening war.
Now that the young people who were born
between 1917 and 1922 are ready to start their
careers, they find that the war has become
reality and that it actually is menacing their
lives.
And yet a few men who cannot release their
pathetic grasps on the days when college life
was collegiate see fit to condemn the serious
attitude of the current generation. They think
it outrageous that undergraduates spend as
much time discussing world wars as world's
records.
Tonight three authorities on the Stanford fac
ulty are going to discuss three major aspects of
the current European conflict, and they are
certain to draw an unusually large student at
tendance. Twelve years ago such a symposium
would have met with sophomoric sneers rather
than lively interest. The college men of that
time were enjoying a false sense of security.
Dick Hyland may not approve of Stanford's
interest in keeping the United States out of
war. He may not understand why there are
times when students are more interested in
whether they are going to the trenches than
in intercollegiate athletics.
But the world moves on, and Stanford moves
with it, no matter what soured old football men
may say.

threatening war.
Now that the young people who were born
between 1917 and 1922 are ready to start their
careers, they find that the war has become
reality and that it actually is menacing their
lives.
And yet a few men who cannot release their
pathetic grasps on the days when college life
was collegiate see fit to condemn the serious
attitude of the current generation. They think
it outrageous that undergraduates spend as
much time discussing world wars as world's
records.
Tonight three authorities on the Stanford fac
ulty are going to discuss three major aspects of
the current European conflict, and they are
certain to draw an unusually large student at
tendance. Twelve years ago such a symposium
would have met with sophomoric sneers rather
than lively interest. The college men of that
time were enjoying a false sense of security.
Dick Hyland may not approve of Stanford's
interest in keeping the United States out of
war. He may not understand why there are
times when students are more interested in
whether they are going to the trenches than
in intercollegiate athletics.
But the world moves on, and Stanford moves
with it, no matter what soured old football men
may say.
tNCLUDED in ex-Stanford Man Dick Hyland's
1 column disowning his alma mater and de
nouncing her football team in the Los Angeles
Times last week was the remark that anyone
who asks in a campus peace poll, "Would you
fight in case the territorial United States was
invaded?" should be either punched silly or
ignored as a neophyte going through a fra
ternity initiation.
Although completely unintelligent, this atti
tude is a not-unusual product of college life in
the crazy decade between the War and the
Depression. In those years of bathtub gin and
"it" and flaming youth, it was considered cor
rect to ignore the world's problems and to for
get its troubles.
The present university generation has a dif
ferent attitude. Having lived its pre-adolescent
years in the 'twenties, it ran into a great finan
cial depression as soon as it began to learn
what life was about. It graduated from high
school facing the greatest unemployment prob
lem the country has ever known. And it en
tered college amid the uncertain rumblings of
threatening war.
Now that the young people who were born
between 1917 and 1922 are ready to start their
careers, they find that the war has become
reality and that it actually is menacing their
lives.
