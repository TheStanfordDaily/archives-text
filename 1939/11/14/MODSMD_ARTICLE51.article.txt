THE Stanford boys and -girls are placing
their bets on the Indians again this week.
What suckers, the world outside says. What
fools. Won't they ever learn their lesson?
Yes, they, the bettors, have learned their les
son; they learned it last Saturday. They learned
it from the football team and from the rooters.
It wasn't finding out that Stanford can be
smeared all over the gridiron 33-0 that they
learned; what they learned was that this Stan
ford football team coached by Tiny Thornhill
and captained by Stan Andersen does not
give up.
And those who were rooters at the game and
those who have talked to the rooters learned
that Stanford students supporting a Stanford
football game don't give up.
Late in the fourth guarter down at U.S.C. last
week-end, with the Trojans leading 33-0, the
Stanford students were still as solidly back of
the team was responding with all it had to
utes before that first prophetic touchdown, and
the team was responding with all they had to
this support. It was a sincere, strong example
of good sportsmanship.
And that spirit did not die as the final gun j
sounded Saturday; it did not float away from j

Stanford students' drowning their sorrows. It
is alive here today. You can feel it on the
campus.
Stanford is going into the Stadium Saturday
and win a football game from Washington State.
That's what it says. Simply, like that, with
out flourishes but with meaning.
No, Stanford doesn't think that it could go
back to U.S.C. and come home with a victory,
or even with a close score. The spirit which is
on the campus this week, in a way it has not
been here all year, is not simply wishful
thinking. It is cool self-confidence backed by
knowledge.
Judging purely from the records, Stanford
should win the Washington State gameâ€”but a
team demoralized by U.S.C. couldn't do that.
That is why Stanford knows its football team
is going to win Saturday. It is not demoralized.
It went down fighting, and it will come up fight
ing Saturday.
And that is why Stanford "suckers" are bet
ting once again on the red Indians. D. J.
