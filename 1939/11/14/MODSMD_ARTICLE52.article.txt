### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THE IMPORTANCE OF EATING
LIN YUTANG is lecturing at the San Francisco
Opera House, once again on the favored topic of
clubwomen: The Importance of Living. The eminent
Chinese scholar is no doubt a man of great intellectual
ability, and a very good business man as well. Per
haps, too, he has an insight into the problems of our
industrialized, unemployed age. II so, however, he
artfully conceals his real knowledge under a well
paid barrage of advice which idle society, ladies call
philosophy.
Lin Yutang's popular book, "The Importance of
Living," tells us all about the enjoyment of life. Re
lax, he says; the key to an enjoyable life is enjoying it.
Eat well and smoke if you want to. Enjoy life. That
is unquestionably a happy morsel of wisdom for people
with rich uncles, an interest in the U.S.C. football team,
or a majority of the Chase National Bank's stock. It
may even be a beautiful guide for day-dreaming in
front of the fire. But as a great twentieth-century phi
losophy it. has about as much value to most of the
world as ping-pong does to the Polish Army.
»!« >|( I|c
r |" , IME and again our so-called nervous generation is
told by arm-chair philosophers that we are too
anxious to make a living. For many of us, that is un
doubtedly true. Certainly college students admit the
value of non-material pleasures, and the hollowness
of a living to make money, rather than making money
to live.
But there are a good many things in a machine
society more powerful than our wish to relax, and
more influential than lectures on enjoying life. We
can't just junk stuffy cities like New York and om
nipotent factories. We can't "just decide" to be care
free shepherds and artists and devotees of culture. The
world's present backbone is machine-made. It's nerves
are wireless-bound, and all is finance-brained. Cul
ture and art and Lin Yutang rest upon and do not
direct the tough, powerful economic basis of society.
If people are to live more soulfully or more artis
tically we must remove the strain by directing the
machines to that end. Simply deciding that people
whose lives are directly or indirectly dependent upon
an industrialized economy should "just relax" is like
asking zebras to forget how to run in a lion-infested
section of Africa. When the zebras don't feel like
living any longer, they will forget how to run. But
living is a peculiar desire that is rather paramount
among men as well as among zebras.
Lin Yutang's lectures will no doubi make fine parlor
topics. They may even assume widespread practical
importance in that happy day when economic and mili
tary savagery will be relegated to history books—in
that far-off Utopia where our Hitlers will be in quiet
homes for megalomaniacs.
Until then, the unpleasant truth is that we can't
forget the importance of eating.
