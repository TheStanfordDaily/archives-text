# CAMPUS OPINION
## CROWDED HOURS 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
It seems to me that. during the last few days
there's been a lot of poor planning in connection with
freshmen activities.
First of all, couldn't rushing lunches have been held
some week-end? If a fellow had an 11 o'clock and a
1 o'clock lab it was hard to squeeze a lunch date in
between. And if he did accept an evening date he
couldn't go to the Roble Jolly-up, or else had to
leave early to go put on his pajamas.
All these may have been and probably were made
unavoidable by a crowded schedule, and so they, may
be, can be overlooked. But Thursday morning in The
Daily we were all surprised to see a list of fellows
who'd been nominated for class president. I, for one,
didn't even know until then that the nominations had
been held, and from what I hear around the hall,
neither did most of the others.
It's not very fair to thrust a list of candidates on a
class, most of whose members hadn't been sufficiently
informed about the election. Everyone in the hall had
been contacted Tuesday about a rally Wednesday.
They should have been told about the nominations, too.
Because of this slip-up somewhere along the line,
couldn't the nominations be thrown open for another
dav? Norman Ross
