HPHE EDITOR, SI I?:
"Stanford men are slow" . . . which translated
from the foreign feminine tongue means that Stanford
men are at last showing a semblance of native intel
ligence. Can it he possible that after all these months
of being able to say, "Sorry, I have a date" or "I'm
not sure yet, will you call later," that the self-conceded
feminine dreams find that the Farm male has turned
to a more natural and less pseudo-sophisticated type of
girl? Stout fellas. â€¢
Do you women want to know why you haven't
the dates that you have come to regard as your just
desserts? It's because the men are afraid to ask you
for a date. Even Encina men have enough of a sense
of pride that they won't keep going back for the same
stereotyped excuses time after time. A dog can be
trained not to cat poisoned meat, and it appears that a
Stanford man can be trained, too. In fact, he really
isn't trying any more. He just says. "Aw hell, she's
already got a date," and forgets the whole thing.
You've brought this on yourselves, girls.
I feel sorry for you, though, really I do, hut above
all, I feel sorry for the few girls that won't have dales
because they are suffering for the far-famed Stanford
co-ed attitude.
Yes. 1 tried to get a date, too
