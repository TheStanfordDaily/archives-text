"We who are about to live salute you!" If Sain Goldwyn had given his
new blood and thunder epic another title, these words, uttered thankfully
and finally by the peaceful padre, would have been it.
After viewing two hours of pictorial wholesale manslaughter, the

audience is allowed to breathe <14
sigh of relief when the Philippine '
natives finally conquer their ancient 1
enemies, the Moros.
COOPER I»LAYS DOCTOR
In this entertaining, fast-moving !
tropic version of the three muske- !
teers' theme, Gary Cooper as Phil j
Canovan, the army doctor, is the I
stellar member of the trio, and de- 1
livers his usual lackadaisically lik- |
able performance plus a new degree I
of vigorous virility. The other mus- !
keteers, who don't come clear
through to the end alive, are David !
Niven, as McCool, and Broderick J
Crawford as Swede Larson, an or
chid fancier who is killed and buried J
in an ant hill.
Dedicated to the Philippine Con- j
stabulary, the motion picture con- j
cerns the account of adversities that 1
beset a handful of U. S. Army offi
cers who are assigned the task of
teaching the Philippine natives how ,
to defend themselves with guns
against the spear - slashing Moro |
tribe.
LIVE HAPPILY
Tlie love interest is sweetly and ,
charmingly supplied by Andrea !
Leeds, alias Linda, the daughter of >
Reginald Owen, the post commander, |
Miss Leeds naturally survives the j
whole picture and she and Gary sail
home together to live happily ever |
afterward.

The audience is gaspingly T'ata
pulted through several near-mas
sacres, death traps in a typical hor
ror jungle, and cholera plague, a
few cold-blooded murders, and the
damming of a river by pirates. The
climax comes in the final dramatic
slaying of Alipang, Moro headsman
leader, practically single-handed by
Hero Cooper.
LAD MURDERED
Kay Johnson, wife of one of the
army officers, presents a convincing
grief-stricken spouse after the min
der of her husband, and turns in a
good bit part. Miguel, special boy
pal of Gary Cooper's, gives one of
the best characterizations in the
film and the fan is really sorry that
the lad is finally killed by the mur
derous Moros.
Technically speaking, the film is
weak and cluttered in Ihe mass ac
tion shots, but superb in the tear
jerking scenes and in times of tense
drama. The background music is ef
fective and adds to the general ex
citement.—Steele

leader, practically single-handed by
Hero Cooper.
LAD MURDERED
Kay Johnson, wife of one of the
army officers, presents a convincing
grief-stricken spouse after the min
der of her husband, and turns in a
good bit part. Miguel, special boy
pal of Gary Cooper's, gives one of
the best characterizations in the
film and the fan is really sorry that
the lad is finally killed by the mur
derous Moros.
Technically speaking, the film is
weak and cluttered in Ihe mass ac
tion shots, but superb in the tear
jerking scenes and in times of tense
drama. The background music is ef
fective and adds to the general ex
citement.—Steele

"We who are about to live salute you!" If Sain Goldwyn had given his
new blood and thunder epic another title, these words, uttered thankfully
and finally by the peaceful padre, would have been it.
After viewing two hours of pictorial wholesale manslaughter, the

audience is allowed to breathe <14
sigh of relief when the Philippine '
natives finally conquer their ancient 1
enemies, the Moros.
COOPER I»LAYS DOCTOR
In this entertaining, fast-moving !
tropic version of the three muske- !
teers' theme, Gary Cooper as Phil j
Canovan, the army doctor, is the I
stellar member of the trio, and de- 1
livers his usual lackadaisically lik- |
able performance plus a new degree I
of vigorous virility. The other mus- !
keteers, who don't come clear
through to the end alive, are David !
Niven, as McCool, and Broderick J
Crawford as Swede Larson, an or
chid fancier who is killed and buried J
in an ant hill.
Dedicated to the Philippine Con- j
stabulary, the motion picture con- j
cerns the account of adversities that 1
beset a handful of U. S. Army offi
cers who are assigned the task of
teaching the Philippine natives how ,
to defend themselves with guns
against the spear - slashing Moro |
tribe.
LIVE HAPPILY
Tlie love interest is sweetly and ,
charmingly supplied by Andrea !
Leeds, alias Linda, the daughter of >
Reginald Owen, the post commander, |
Miss Leeds naturally survives the j
whole picture and she and Gary sail
home together to live happily ever |
afterward.

The audience is gaspingly T'ata
pulted through several near-mas
sacres, death traps in a typical hor
ror jungle, and cholera plague, a
few cold-blooded murders, and the
damming of a river by pirates. The
climax comes in the final dramatic
slaying of Alipang, Moro headsman
leader, practically single-handed by
Hero Cooper.
