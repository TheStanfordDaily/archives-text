# 'Madhouse Characterizes Costume Designers Work
## 
### BUD AMES 
That costume department—it's a madhouse with all the trimmings.
Every closet is crowded with meek-looking women running around stitch
ing Huffy ballet costumes, and bleak-looking hams who blow in all after
noon "just to try on that snappy satin turban again."
And leading the merry mob through the yards of taffeta and satirt i;l
Helen Green, a slight, perpetually smiling woman whose technical title is

Costume Director. It is her task to
direct her student assistants in the
hurry - scurry preparation of the
costumes — hundreds every year —
used in the Farm's theatrical efforts.
The department, now a part, of the
Division of Speech and Drama—came
into being in 19.37, but previous to
this time a few courses had been
given in costume designing and mak
ing. Today, with courses open to
all undergraduates, approximately 50
students take some costuming in
struction during a school year.
"A certain psychological feeling
can be expressed in costumes
through the use of color and line of
cut," Mrs. Green chatted informa
tively on. "Grayed colors, whose
tone value has been reduced, are
used to express tragedy, while bril
liant-hued, clear-pigmented colors
are used to express a feeling of
comedy.
"In the same vein, authentic lines
of cut express tragedy; obviously
exaggerated lines express comedy."
Scene of actual costume produc
tion is a thin, long room hidden
away in the back corner of the Me
morial Hall. Nerve center of this
room is Mrs. Green's six-by-five-foot
cubby hole—her "office"—whose ev
ery inch is littered with sketches,
water colors, buttons, and more of
those meek-looking women.
Working equipment consists of
five sewing machines, a few irons,
mirrors, and tables, and a damp dye
room.
"We make everything from a
priest's cloak to a circus hat," Mrs.
Green said with obvious pride. "In
this dye room we do all our own
color work with salt dyes, alcohol
dyes, oil dyes, and a hundred others.
The department also has a wash
ing machine.
"Oh, that! Well, we do our own
washing and ironing, too," she
laughed.
