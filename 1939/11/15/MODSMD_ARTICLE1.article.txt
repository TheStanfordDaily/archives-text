### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
IN ROOSEVELT'S official family,
all was sweetness and light last
night.
There were no disagreements to
mar the placid surface of Adminis
tration waters. President Roosevelt
and his right-hand man, Cordell
Hull, seemed to be in complete ac
cord about a problem that arose to
dog the United States after its pas
sage of the Neutrality Revision Bill.
That problem was the proposal
made last week by the U. S. Lines
to transfer eight of its trans-Atlantic
vessels to the Panama flag in an
effort to circumvent the Act provi
sion that banned American ships
from European war zones. And, al
though President Roosevelt had
originally indicated he thought the
move by U. S. Lines was perfectly
legal, he last night changed his views.
At least he intimated that Cordell
Hull, who has been opposed to the
transference since the beginning,
was actually correct in stating that
it was a violation of the spirit, if
not the letter, of the Neutrality Act.
* * *
IN ADDITION, Roosevelt be
lieves that the United States
shouldn't place a sister American
republic in a neutrality position
different from its own. This was
another indication of the strong
bond of "working neutrality" that
hinds together the western world.
On the other hand, Roosevelt
wouldn't say whether he would veto
the U. S. Lines plan, but he re
marked that most people can see in
which direction the wind is blowing.
The proposal has been before the
Maritime Commission, the official
government body that handles such
matters, for a long time. The Com
mission once approved the shift
conditionally, but Mr. Roosevelt
made the agency withhold its deci
sion pending further study.
* * #
As a sharp reminder that Amer
ican ships are better off on their
own side of the ocean was the news
that ten vessels, plus a British de
stroyer, were sunk in the last 72
hours with a toll of at least 33 dead
and many critically injured among
the survivors. The intensified war
fare coincided with an unoflieial
Nazi threat to torpedo all British
ships "on the assumption they are
armed" and a statement in the
House of Commons that Britain
may order submarine chasers from
the United States to cope with the
U-boat menace if British ship
building yards should prove in
capable of keeping abreast of the
challenge.
♦ * *
OESIDES the destroyer, the only
other ships identified were a
Norwegian tanker and a British
freighter—both shelled and sunk by
the Nazi U-boats without warning,
according to survivors.
+ * *
The continued mining of Swedish
territorial waters led to a suspen
sion of German-Swedish trade ne
gotiations yesterday, too. For weeks
the Swedish press has been com
plaining bitterly against the laying
of German mines off Falsterbo, in
southwest Sweden. Until now the
Swedes have been cagey. They've
concentrated their activities at
Gothenburg, on the west coast op
posite the entrance to the North Sea.
That way they've been able to
avoid German contraband control
over shipments destined for Brit
ain and to avoid the German mine
fields further south, guarding the
entrance to the Baltic against Al
lied warships.

the Swedish press has been com
plaining bitterly against the laying
of German mines off Falsterbo, in
southwest Sweden. Until now the
Swedes have been cagey. They've
concentrated their activities at
Gothenburg, on the west coast op
posite the entrance to the North Sea.
That way they've been able to
avoid German contraband control
over shipments destined for Brit
ain and to avoid the German mine
fields further south, guarding the
entrance to the Baltic against Al
lied warships.
IN ROOSEVELT'S official family,
all was sweetness and light last
night.
There were no disagreements to
mar the placid surface of Adminis
tration waters. President Roosevelt
and his right-hand man, Cordell
Hull, seemed to be in complete ac
cord about a problem that arose to
dog the United States after its pas
sage of the Neutrality Revision Bill.
That problem was the proposal
made last week by the U. S. Lines
to transfer eight of its trans-Atlantic
vessels to the Panama flag in an
effort to circumvent the Act provi
sion that banned American ships
from European war zones. And, al
though President Roosevelt had
originally indicated he thought the
move by U. S. Lines was perfectly
legal, he last night changed his views.
At least he intimated that Cordell
Hull, who has been opposed to the
transference since the beginning,
was actually correct in stating that
it was a violation of the spirit, if
not the letter, of the Neutrality Act.
* * *
IN ADDITION, Roosevelt be
lieves that the United States
shouldn't place a sister American
republic in a neutrality position
different from its own. This was
another indication of the strong
bond of "working neutrality" that
hinds together the western world.
On the other hand, Roosevelt
wouldn't say whether he would veto
the U. S. Lines plan, but he re
marked that most people can see in
which direction the wind is blowing.
The proposal has been before the
Maritime Commission, the official
government body that handles such
matters, for a long time. The Com
mission once approved the shift
conditionally, but Mr. Roosevelt
made the agency withhold its deci
sion pending further study.

As a sharp reminder that Amer
ican ships are better off on their
own side of the ocean was the news
that ten vessels, plus a British de
stroyer, were sunk in the last 72
hours with a toll of at least 33 dead
and many critically injured among
the survivors. The intensified war
fare coincided with an unoflieial
Nazi threat to torpedo all British
ships "on the assumption they are
armed" and a statement in the
House of Commons that Britain
may order submarine chasers from
the United States to cope with the
U-boat menace if British ship
building yards should prove in
capable of keeping abreast of the
challenge.

the Nazi U-boats without warning,
