# Excom Sets Closed Date For Drama
## 'Warrior's Husband' Slated for Feb. 1, 2, 3; Bonfire Heads Named 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Supporting the current democracy
in-dramatics campaign, Ex Commit
tee last night voted unanimously to
set aside as closed dates the three
nights on which is scheduled "The
Warrior's Husband," the play se
lected through a student poll l.ist j
week. •
Slated as the first offering by the
Division of Speech and Drama during
winter quarter, the play will lie
produced Feb. 1, 2, and 3, 1940.
Some opposition to granting the j
closed dates was voiced at the first,
of the discussion, on grounds many
groups would be planning dances
during that part.of the quarter. It
was felt, however, that other plans
could be made if groups were noti
fied this far in advance.
Nods of approval followed Coline
Upshaw's contention that "there
shouldn't be much beef this far
ahead." Members voted unanimous
ly in approval of the motion, which
was introduced by Mollie West.
Other business of last night's
meeting follows:

BONFIRE EXPENSE: Since no
money was budgeted last year for
the Big Game Bonfire, Ex Commit
tee last night appropriated $125 for
that purpose. It was explained that
no money had been set aside before
| because there was some doubt the
Bonfire would be held this year.
SUGGESTION BOX: So student
representation on the Board of
Athletic Control can be more re
flective of student opinion, a sug
gestion box is to be placed some
where on the campus—probably out
side the A.S.S.U. office—for the bene
fit of the three student representa
tives on the board, Hamp Pool, Stan
Hiserman, and Ken Cuthbertson.
LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE: How
J to arouse more interest in the an
nual spring quarter training period

by the committee. Appointed to a
