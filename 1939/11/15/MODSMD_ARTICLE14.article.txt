# Bailey's Conversation Vital; Activities Varied

### BUD AMES 
"1 wouldn't want to criticize the
j football team; no more than 1 would
want Tiny Thornhill to sit in the
: back of my American History class
j and criticize my method of teaching,
i In a sense we are both specialists,
| and we should stick to our own
l specialty."
Such is typical of History Profes
j sor T. A. Bailey's objective line of
! thought. His conversation is to the
! point, always objective, and sprin
i kled with such pithy remarks as
j "ferry boat coach" (another name
I for bleacher quarterbacks) and
| "knife and fork clubs" (those eating
lecture clubs which he dreads).
He is 36; and he has covered a lot
jof ground in those 36 years. Aca
i demically, he graduated from the
I Farm in 1927, and then moved to
Hawaii to teach until 1930. when he
; was recalled as a member of the
Stanford history staff. Hawaii bites
even history professors, and it was
in that land of palms and pineapples
that he met and married his wife.
Incidentally, in addition to Stan
ford work, he did spend a year, 1925,
of study and teaching sections at the
University of California.
i

"They fooled me up there," he
chuckled. "I actually found they
were human on the California
campus."
This December comes that long
awaited vacation when the busy
professor will be absent from cam
pus, with headquarters at Princeton,
on sabbatical leave until next Sep
tember. Well, it will be a kind of
vacation because he will still be
gathering material for a book en
titled "American Belligerency and
Neutral Rights, 1917-19."
This will be his third book. The
first, "Roosevelt, in the Japanese-
American Crises" left the presses in
1934. and his second, an 800-page
"A Diplomatic History of the
American People" will be published
as a college texlbook this December.
You can also ring up to his credit
about 20 articles contributed to his
torical reviews. Most appealing ar
ticles were those concerning the
Log of the U-20. the submarine
which sank the Lusitania in 1915.
Exploding the legend that the U-20
had lain in wait for the Lusitania,
Professor Bailey proved that the
meeting of the sub and liner had
been quite accidental.

It all looks pretty technical, but
Professor Bailey i.s as human a guy
as ever lecturcd to seven different
classes of history students.
"I don't garden any more than I
have to," he admitted. "I've a dogâ€”
but that's mostly my wife's idea.
And I once saw Babe Ruth hit a
home run."
A pretty well balanced life.
