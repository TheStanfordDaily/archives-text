# Frosh Leave To Paint 'C'
## 
### 
Watch for nodding heads, for
hands smeared with red paint in
lectures today. The frosh have gone
on their annual expedition to paint
Cal's Big "C."
They left last night at 11 o'clock,
after a day of hurried planning,
equipped with two and one-half
gallons of red paint, quantities of
thinner, and an assortment of brooms
and brushes.
With the Big Game still a week
and a half away, the frosh were op
timistic about their chances of suc
cess, since they thought Berkeleyites
would not yet have posted guards at
the big cement monument.
It was impossible last night to de
termine how many of the freshmen
made the transbay trip, since plan
ning was confused and details were
handled as secretly as possible.
By 9 o'clock last night, things were
rolling. Organizers were moving
quietly from room to room, signing
up raiders and collecting 25 cents
from each as his share of the paint,
thinner, and brushes.
Dressed in their jeans and sweat
shirts and packed four or five to an
automobile, the frosh met at the
players' entrance of the Stanford
Stadium at 10:45 o'clock for final
instructions.
Then they started moving, break
ing into groups that headed for
Berkeley, some by Dumbarton
Bridge, some by the San Mateo
Bridge, and some by San Francisco,
to avoid arousing suspicion.
And that is as much as had hap
pened when The Daily went to bed.
