All invitations to sorority leas and
dessert parties this week-end, which
new women received last night,
should be answered and returned to
sponsors by noon loday, according
to Jeanne Cutler, president of Pan
hellenic Council.
Teas will be from 3 to 5:30 o'clock
Friday and Sunday and dessert par
ties will be from 7 to 9:30 o'clock
Saturday evening in the Row's nine
sorority houses. Quad clothes will
be worn to all affairs, and women
may visit as many houses as they
receive invitations for each day.
Sponsors will answer any ques
tions which may arise. Miss Cutler
stated, and women not living in
University residences should contact
Alice James, off-campus sponsor.
