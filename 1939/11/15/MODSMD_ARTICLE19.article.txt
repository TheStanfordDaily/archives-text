# Interfraternity Council Recommends Elimination Of Pre-Initiation Ordeal
## Council President Bob Moulton Urges Rule Change for Use In Next Year's Ceremonies 
### 
Figuratively "putting teeth" in fraternity initiation regulations, hazing
and "quests" were outlawed and the traditional initiation period was
nominally shortened for next year by the Interfraternity Council at a
dinner conclave at the Theta Delt house last night.
The rules still must be approved by Interfraternity Board of Control.

Changes in initiation rules were
caused by complaints registered with
University authorities as a result of
this season's initiation activities. In
almost every instance the newly rec
ommended initiation rules, as drawn
up by Bob 'Moulton, Interfraternity
Council president, met with the
unanimous consent and approval of
the council, and will bo presented
for approval tonight to the Interfra
ternity Board of Control.
A letter from President Ray Ly
man Wilbur to members of the ad
ministration and to Moulton, re
ceived following this season's ini
tiation period, accused the fraterni
ties of abusing certain privileges of
the University.
Originally recommended by Moul
ton, abolishment of the use of the
paddle at Stanford was not passed
by Ihc Council.
The proposed rules for 1940-41 are
as follows:
1. That this period, in all its pub
licity and use, be known as Initia
tion Period.
2. That the various fraternities
shall, during this period, design their
programs in a constructive pattern to
add to initiates' knowledge concern
ing fraternities, their organization,
and their problems. (Local and na
tional.)
3. That whichever week bo chosen
for the Initiation Period in 1940-41
shall last only from Thursday
through Saturday, inclusive.
4. The initiation activities shall be
restricted to the house and grounds
of the local chapter house. Under no
circumstances will quests be per
mitted.
5. Adequate measures must bo
taken to safeguard the health of the
initiates. This includes reasonable
food, six hours of sleep in every
24, and no unreasonable physical
treatment.
6. Adequate measures must be
taken to safeguard the scholarship
of the initiates. Study periods shall
be provided of not less than two
hours per day.
7. There shall be no hazing of
neophytes. Hazing is considered "the
harrassment of an individual in or
der to make him look ridiculous in
the public eye."
8. The activities should not inter
fere with the peace and quiet of any
other person or group of persons.
!>. Each fraternity shall report, in
advance to the offices of the Inter
fraternity Council the details of its-
Initiation Period program.
10. An Initiation Period Commit
tee shall again administer, in co
operation with the Interfraternity
Council president, the details of the
program. The fraternity system shall
establish its own on-campus inspec
tion committee to enforce these reg
ulations. And finally as a penalty
for the violation of these regulations
violating fraternities will Im; liable,
upon the judgment, of the Interfra
ternity Board of Control, of a maxi
mum fine of $100.
