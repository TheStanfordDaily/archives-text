WAR IS NO PHONEY
In discussing the possibility of an
immediate peace, Professor Brandt
pointed out the inability of econ
omists to make accurate predictions.
"The so-called economic laws apply
rather badly to war because war
reverses all the underlying prin
ciples," he explained, and contin
ued, "In the meantime this will be
no phoney war. The Allies will have
to light l'or their lives."
Professor Harris traced the his
tory of the present conflict from the
Treaty of Versailles to the diplomatic
situation of Sept.. 1. He blamed the
.situation upon the existence of the
sovereign state which is never a
moral institution. He pointed out
that Hitler is after all only a per
sonification of the state.
NAZIS PREPARED
Germany is better prepared than
she was in 15)14 but the Allies have
a great advantage in their control of
the high seas, Professor Brandt
pointed out in his review of the eco
nomic position of the belligerents.
Professor Stuart said that the
Turkish alliance was the greatest
victory so far in the war. He ex
plained the apparent stalling of the
war, "They want to save men, and
I hey want to starve Germany."
