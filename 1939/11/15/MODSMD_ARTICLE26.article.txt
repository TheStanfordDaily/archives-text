# Farm Historian To Talk Today
## Professor Robinson To Be Lunch Speaker 
### 
"What does America offer Stanford I
men and women?" is the question ,
Professor Edgar E. Robinson will '
discuss today before Luncheon Club !
when that group meets at 12:10!
o'clock in the Nitery.
Out of his experience in teaching ,
and "living"' American history, stud- !
ying and observing America and I
Americans, and his observation of
Stanford students in particular, Mr. !
Robinson will interpret the unique I
advantages he believes are inherent j
in the "American way of life."
Of Americans who in their careers j
have illustrated this American way i
of life, he has chosen to speak, from i
personal recollection, of Louis Loch- j
ner, chief of the Associated Press in >
Berlin; of Walter Lippman, formerly |
editor of the New York World;!
Henry Luce, editor of Time, For- j
tune, and Life; William Leiserson,
chairman of the National Labor Re- i
lations Board; and J. Earl Baker,j
head of the Red Cross Famine Re- j
lief in China.
Professor Robinson is familiar to i
Stanford students through his ]
courses in Westward Movement,
American Democracy, and American
History. He has also lived or trav- I
eled in every section of the United j
States, having served as a visitingJ
member on the faculties of many j
universities all over the country.
