# Finns Stand Firm Against Russ Might
## Incidents on Border Indicate Beginning Of 'War of Nerves' 
### United Press 
Finland's defiance of Soviet Rus
sia's demands Wednesday carried
her into a "war of nerves" such as
proceeded the wiping out of Austria,
Czechoslovakia and Poland but the
Finns appeared to be standing their
ground, calmly and grimly.
Finnish officials reported a series
of warlike "incidents" on land and
in the air along the eastern frontier
with Russia and it was reported, al
though not verified, a Soviet war
plane had been shot down.
Russian infantrymen were reported
to have "charged" with fixed bay
onets toward Finnish barbed wire
barricades, shooting into the air.
NEGOTIATIONS FAIL
The border incidents occurred only
24 hours after breakdown of the
Soviet-Finnish talks in Moscow and
angry accusations by the official
Soviet press that Finland is "plot
ting war against the Soviet Union."
In addition to the border unrest,
there were strong indications Rus
sia soon may exert strong economic
pressure in an effort to force the
Finns to follow Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania in capitulating to Stalin's
ambitions for complete domination
of the eastern Baltic.
Some Scandinavian reports indi
cated Finland, which holds a warm
spot in American hearts because of
prompt payment of war debt install
ments, might seek an American
loan to bolster resistance to Russian
demands.
WAR SPEEDED UP
The war in Europe was stepped
up on land and sea Tuesday.
The German high command an
nounced Nazi troops of the Westwall
had repulsed "repeated assaults" by
French infantry, artillery and low
flying planes near Pirmasens. Each
successive French attempt to recap
ture strategic hills of the Saar
Basin sector was hurled back, the
Nazis said.
The French high command admit
ted "great activity by patrols" east
of the Saar but made no mention of
offensive operations by the French
forces.
Gunfire which sounded like anti
aircraft batteries was heard in the
west end of Berlin late in the after
noon, but no explanation was forth
coming and officials said they doubt
ed any British planes had appeared.
BRITISH lA)SE DESTROYER
At sea the British navy lost its
sixth warship in ten weeks. A Brit
ish destroyer was sunk shortly be
fore dawn, with a loss of perhaps six
lives, when it struck a German mine
off the English coast.
In 72 hours, ten merchant ships
were sunk—seven British, two Ger
man and one Norwegian—in the in
tensified war on the high seas.
Germany's reply to last week's
peace appeal and mediation offer by
Queen Wilhelmina of the Nether
lands and King Leopold 111 of the
Belgians was ready Tuesday night,
but it. was an unpfomising answer
and the Dutch-Belgian appeal seem
ed ready for shelving.
