(A ('(tuple of {fenerations ago
when (he present inhabitant of the
Sideline Slants column was editor
of his high school paper, there was
a girl writing on his stall who
showed tremendous journalistic
possibilities. Today that young
lady is writing a column entitled,
"Just Among Us (iirls" for a Los
Angele.-. sports weekly, and she
gave Sideline Slants permission to
reprint the following. — Jerry

COACH STMT). FTBLL. TIM.
DEAR MR. 1 HORN HILL
I've been reading discouraging
things in the papers. The boys say
that already you've got that "after
GO" look and that your hair is turn
ing washerwoman's , gray from
worry . . .
Gee whiz, Tiny, I don't like them
to pick on you! Even if I am tired of
seeing our Alma Mater entered as
"second class matter" in the Coast
Conference . . .
It's particularly hard on us co
eds, to have to it there in the
stands and listen to some grand
stand quarter who doesn't know as
much about calling signals as a
cop, holler out that our hacks
ought to belong to the Alfalfa Delts
fraternity because they spend so
much time grazing in the backlield.
You and I know they weren't
grazing idly, Tiny. They were
looking for four-leaf clovers . . . j
'WEAK-END TRIP'
SARCASM CRITICIZED
And then the ends! Maybe the
lads didn't appear to have as much !
life in them as a pair of BOOK- '
ENDS, but you kinda hate to hear I
the other side sarcastically refer to,
"going on a weak-end trip."
But I've been doing a lot of think- j
ing! I 'member a few years back 1
when the Vow Boys made every j
game a lour-act tragedy for oppo
nents . . .
Geo, Tiny, in those days the other I
teams used to be so scared their hair
was always standing on end so high;
they couldn't put their helmets on'
and it was a cinch to scalp them: j
A clear case of fright-phobia, Tiny. I
FRANKENSTEIN RIGS
SUGGESTED FOR TEAM
So maybe you can work on the !
fear - complex this year. too. |
Course, you can't play the "men
tal" fear-phobia because everyone j
knows that this year it's a matter \
of keeping up with the Joneses, I
but I'll bet you could scare any |
team if you outfitted the boys in !
gas-masks with Boris Karloff
faces painted on them, and equip
ped them with discarded Franken- !
stein suits that Universal used in •
(lit- last picture.
Then you could camouflage the
football, tear up the gridiron, and !
put air-raid shelters behind the
.'5O-yard line, and stick barhed
wire fences around the goal posts!
Only trouble is, once the boys got
a look at each other in those Frank
enstein outfits, they might be more i
scared than their opponents!
BRING EARL CARROLL
GIRLS FOR INSPIRATION
Gee, I dunno, Tiny. Maybe the 1
boys need an inspiration. You!
know, blonde and blue-eyed. ... I
I hear the quota of girls is one to j
every two boys (Ed.'s note: Statistics '
inaccurate—one to four), and it's I
kinda tough on a team when they J
have to SHARE inspirations! Maybe i
you could arrange it for the Earl |
Carroll girls to come up and hold
their rehearsals at the practice field. I
. . . Well, anyway, Tiny, I hope for |
your sake the boys come through, j
'Cause I always did like the name i
"Tiny"!
Sincerely.
Your cor-despondent,
PRUNELLA PIPSQUEAK j
