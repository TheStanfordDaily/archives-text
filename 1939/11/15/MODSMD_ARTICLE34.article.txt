# Dr. Roth Advises Jim Groves to Quit Gridiron
## Injury-Shot Cards Face W.S.C. Team Fear of Aggravating Shoulder Hurt May Force Groves Out 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Football, which probably means a
lot more to Jim Groves than one i
can realize, may be all over for Stan- |
ford's veteran right halfback.
"I advised him to drop football on
the way back from the S.C.. game,"
Dr. Fritz Roth, team physician, told J
The Daily last night. "It's up to
him."
Groves, who has not been in uni
form the past two practice sessions
for the Washington State game Sat
urday, has been asked by one of his
sponsors, Irving Cummings, a Hol
lywood motion picture director, to
give up the sport. He feared that a
shoulder injury which kept him out
of action during 1938 would be fur
ther aggravated if he continued to
play.
STATUS IN DOUBT
The lirst string halfback would no) '
commit himself yesterday, referring !
the situation to Tiny Thornhill.
Tiny said that it depended upon \
what Dr. Roth said but that he is |

"definitely out of the Washington
State game.
"To all intents and purposes
Groves is out for the season." Don
Liebendorfer, B.A.C. publicity di
rector, stated.
The possible loss of Groves for
the season further depletes an al
ready injury - ridden Stanford foot
ball squad which has suffered nu
merous casualties ever since Johnny
Kerman went out with a mutilated
knee in the Washington Husky
game. Hugh Gallarneau and Pete
Kmetovic have been the only other
varsity men to see action at right
half, but there may be a new ace in
Glenn "Cookie South who has been
alternating between the two halfback
posts.
SHOULDER GETS WORSE
Groves has been taking punish
ment all season from his shoulder,
Dr. Roth said. Instead of getting
better it has been getting worse.
While troubles continued to haunt
the Stanfords, Tiny continued to
work on the positions which are al
ready down to the bone in replace
ments—the ends, guards, and half
backs.
POOL AT QUARTER
Hamp Pool, who once before this
year was groomed for quarter, was
that job last night and will be a
probably start. Saturday against the
Cougars. Gene Coldiron and Bobby
Templeton, No. 1 and 2 quarters,
got knee injuries against Southern
California and are definitely the
week.

Kerman went out with a mutilated
knee in the Washington Husky
game. Hugh Gallarneau and Pete
Kmetovic have been the only other
varsity men to see action at right
half, but there may be a new ace in
Glenn "Cookie South who has been
alternating between the two halfback
posts.
SHOULDER GETS WORSE
Groves has been taking punish
ment all season from his shoulder,
Dr. Roth said. Instead of getting
better it has been getting worse.
While troubles continued to haunt
the Stanfords, Tiny continued to
work on the positions which are al
ready down to the bone in replace
ments—the ends, guards, and half
backs.
POOL AT QUARTER
Hamp Pool, who once before this
year was groomed for quarter, was
that job last night and will be a
probably start. Saturday against the
Cougars. Gene Coldiron and Bobby
Templeton, No. 1 and 2 quarters,
got knee injuries against Southern
California and are definitely the
week.


JDI GROVES
Football, which probably means a
lot more to Jim Groves than one i
can realize, may be all over for Stan- |
ford's veteran right halfback.
"I advised him to drop football on
the way back from the S.C.. game,"
Dr. Fritz Roth, team physician, told J
The Daily last night. "It's up to
him."
Groves, who has not been in uni
form the past two practice sessions
for the Washington State game Sat
urday, has been asked by one of his
sponsors, Irving Cummings, a Hol
lywood motion picture director, to
give up the sport. He feared that a
shoulder injury which kept him out
of action during 1938 would be fur
ther aggravated if he continued to
play.
STATUS IN DOUBT
The lirst string halfback would no) '
commit himself yesterday, referring !
the situation to Tiny Thornhill.
Tiny said that it depended upon \
what Dr. Roth said but that he is |

"definitely out of the Washington
State game.
"To all intents and purposes
Groves is out for the season." Don
Liebendorfer, B.A.C. publicity di
rector, stated.
The possible loss of Groves for
the season further depletes an al
ready injury - ridden Stanford foot
ball squad which has suffered nu
merous casualties ever since Johnny
Kerman went out with a mutilated
knee in the Washington Husky
game. Hugh Gallarneau and Pete
Kmetovic have been the only other
