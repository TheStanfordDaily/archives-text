PARIS. France, Nov. 14 (UP). â€”A
four-week campaign to reopen
French race courses which were
closed under the war ban on as
semblies was successful today when
the government announced a two
week trotting season would be held
in early December.
If the first meet is successful it is
believed regular racing sessions will
be rescheduled throughout the
country.
In France bicycles have the right
of way over automobiles.
