# Card Waterbabes To Face Cal Cubs
## 
### 
] Battling to put a winning climax
I on a disastrous season, the frosh
! water polo team will meet the Cal
I waterbabes in the first of a twn
j game series Friday afternoon at En
j cina Pool.
Coach Harvey Rothschild's Pap
j ooses will enter the contest as un
; derdogs due to their record of four
losses in five games, but that single
; win was hung up in their last start
j at the expense of a Sequoia High
I team that had previously trounced
the Frosh !) to 1.
The Cards' greatest fault has
> been that of inexperience. Only one
I man on the squad, Johnny Haur
-1 wass, former Los Angeles High
| star, played the game before en
tering Stanford. The victory over
Sequoia would indicate, however,
that the Papoose team has at last
. found itself and may surprise the
! Cubs.
In 1889 John L. Sullivan went 75
rounds with Kilrain.
