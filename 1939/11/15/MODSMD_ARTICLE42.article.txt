# Card Splashers Will Face Cal
## 
### 
An interesting situation today was
shifting the odds of the "big game" j
; of water polo Friday between Stan
ford and California.
Earlier in the season, the Indians
went into the favorite's role be- j
i cause of a 7 to 2 victory over San 1
Jose State. California, it seems, had !
lost to the same outfit by a close I
margin.
But Stanford again played the
Spartans, in the latter's pool, and j
this time were upset. The different j
pools and conditions were blamed t
for the turnabout.
In the meantime, the Golden Bears j
1 came back with a 6 to 1 victory 1
i over San Jose Stateâ€”in California's i
pool. , n>
The situation leaves odds-seekers
at a loss. If they were to base their
I odds on conference games, Stanford
would hold an advantage because
of a 3 to 2 victory over U.S.C. But 1
the Indians were trounced in a sec- !
J ond meeting with Troy.
California lost a close opener to ;
I U.S.C., but was beaten badly for a :
I second time in the number two to
j gether.
