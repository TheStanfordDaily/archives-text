# The 						Jaws of Hell
## 
### 
HAZING is the most childish, the most brutal
tradition connected with American college
life. For many years freshmen at all major uni
versities were forced to submit to being beaten
by upper classmen and to making fools of
themselves on the main street of the college
town.
Recently most institutions, Stanford included,
have progressed far enough to outlaw hazing
on a class-wide scale. The last vestige of such
activities disappeared from the Farm when the
Frosh-Soph Mud Fight was abolished three
years ago.
However, although the hazing of freshmen
is no longer tolerated, the fraternity pre-initia
tion period, popularly and accurately known as
Hell Week, has been allowed to continue.
Each year, with varying success, Interfrater
nity Council has attempted to control the situa
tion, but no period has gone by without sopho
mores' health and grades suffering and outside
parties complaining to the University about
disturbances.
Experience has proved that half-way meas
ures, with polite exceptions being made where
rules interfere with national fraternity regula
tions or local traditions, will never be effective.
Interfraternity Council has been waiting a good
many years for a president strong enough and
sensible enough to remedy the situation.
This year it has one. And tonight he will pre
sent to Interfraternity Board of Control a list of
proposed rulings designed to take the stupidity,
the brutality, the "Hell" out of Hell Week. His
suggestions are revolutionary in the extreme.
Quests, public exhibitions, and lack of sleep,
all standard items in the fraternity catalog, are
to be unequivocally outlawed. Pre-initiation
periods are to be planned to acquaint pledges
with the history, traditions, and spirit of the
fraternity, not to make them flunk exes, create
public spectacles, and spend the next week in
the Rest Home.
Those small-minded men who find satisfaction
in brow-beating sophomores to compensate for
their own shortcomings probably will disap
prove of the reform and will grumble a great
deal about weaklings and men who can't take
it. But those men who really are intelligent and
strong realize that Hell Week destroys a great
deal more than it creates.
Tonight Interfraternity Board of Control will
hand down its decision on the proposed remedy
for the worst ill in the Stanford fraternity sys
tem. It cannot afford to withhold the cure any
longer.
