# Toward Smoother Relations

COLLEGIATE athletics being the highly or
ganized business that it is, it is necessary
for universities to set up all-powerful boards of
management, to negotiate strict contracts with
other universities, to run athletics in as efficient
a manner as possible.
Lost somewhere in this shuffle is the fact that
sports in a university are still primarily for the
benefit of the students—or should be. It is the
students who participate, and the whole ath
letics program was originally designed to pro
vide healthy exercise and a safety-valve to un
dergraduate enthusiasm.
It seems then that some of the sense of pro
portionate values has been lost when manage
ment of athletics is taken far from student opin
ion, and relegated to an office far across the
campus where the only connection students
may have with sports is that they must go there
to buy tickets to watch them.
Some relief to this situation, a situation made
necessary by the complicated organization
that intercollegiate sports has become, is af
forded in the presence of three voting members
representing the A.S.S.U. on the Board of Ath
letic Control. That is fair and it is democratic.
The only difficulty is that the three student
members of the B.A.C. are little more likely than
alumni members or the business heads of the
B.A.C. itself to know the trend of student
opinion.
Two of the three members are nearly always
athletes and not at all active in other student
affairs. The third member, who is a member
automatically, is the A.S.S.U. President.
Last night Ex Committee took notice of this
shortcoming, decided to help close the wide
gap between the University's students and its
athletics. A box will be set up within a short
time at some yet unannounced place wherein
students may deposit their suggestions as to
how varsity athletics should be managed.
The student members of the 8.A.C., it is
planned, will compile these suggestions into
a sort of campus opinion, put the aggregate

collection before the B.A.C. This latter organi
zation may not act accordingly, but at least it
will know.
Just why Ex Committee did not set the time
and place for the establishment of the sugges
tion box was not explained. They should have
done it last night, while the idea was still hot.
Instead they put it off "until the next few days."
But when the box is set up, some additional
element of democracy will enter into the rela
tions of Stanford with its B.A.C. Perhaps those
relations will be more open, the summary de
cisions of the office across the campus a little
more understandable. —J. B.

The only difficulty is that the three student
members of the B.A.C. are little more likely than
alumni members or the business heads of the
B.A.C. itself to know the trend of student
opinion.
Two of the three members are nearly always
athletes and not at all active in other student
affairs. The third member, who is a member
automatically, is the A.S.S.U. President.
Last night Ex Committee took notice of this
shortcoming, decided to help close the wide
gap between the University's students and its
athletics. A box will be set up within a short
time at some yet unannounced place wherein
students may deposit their suggestions as to
how varsity athletics should be managed.
The student members of the 8.A.C., it is
planned, will compile these suggestions into
a sort of campus opinion, put the aggregate

collection before the B.A.C. This latter organi
zation may not act accordingly, but at least it
will know.
Just why Ex Committee did not set the time
and place for the establishment of the sugges
tion box was not explained. They should have
done it last night, while the idea was still hot.
Instead they put it off "until the next few days."
But when the box is set up, some additional
element of democracy will enter into the rela
tions of Stanford with its B.A.C. Perhaps those
relations will be more open, the summary de
cisions of the office across the campus a little
more understandable. —J. B.
COLLEGIATE athletics being the highly or
ganized business that it is, it is necessary
for universities to set up all-powerful boards of
management, to negotiate strict contracts with
other universities, to run athletics in as efficient
a manner as possible.
Lost somewhere in this shuffle is the fact that
sports in a university are still primarily for the
benefit of the students—or should be. It is the
students who participate, and the whole ath
letics program was originally designed to pro
vide healthy exercise and a safety-valve to un
dergraduate enthusiasm.
It seems then that some of the sense of pro
portionate values has been lost when manage
ment of athletics is taken far from student opin
ion, and relegated to an office far across the
campus where the only connection students
may have with sports is that they must go there
to buy tickets to watch them.
Some relief to this situation, a situation made
necessary by the complicated organization
that intercollegiate sports has become, is af
forded in the presence of three voting members
representing the A.S.S.U. on the Board of Ath
letic Control. That is fair and it is democratic.
