### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
ONE FOR AESOP
r was once a little Indian boy named After-
Wampum, who came from a nice, wholesome tepee,
and who was anxious to learn much at the big rah-rah
tepee where there were many wise men. After-
Wampum was an impressionable Indian and listened
carefully to everything he was told, because he felt a
little smaller than the other Indians who said "How!"
with innumerable inflections and knew all about the
world.
And After-Wampum was told many things.
He was told by other little Indians all about squaws,
and he liked very much to listen. At first After-
Wampum wondered what his home Tepee would say
about the things he heard. But he was broad-minded.
Then many big Indians with smooth buckskin
clothes and fast pinto ponies with white side-walls
descended on After-Wampum to teach him how to be
a smooth brave. They showed him how to wear his
war-bonnet, how to say "How!" in a variety of cheer
ful ways, and told him about all the things the smooth
est braves did and how to court squaws at the Ugh-
Ugh Tepee, which was the best Squaw Temple on the
hunting-grounds.

[yiEANWHILE the wise men were telling After-
Wampum all kinds of things that shattered all the
legends his Uncle Chief Horse-trader had told him.
The wise men weren't practical people like Horse
trader, but they seemed to have more reasonable ex
planations of the wars between After-Wampum's na
tion and the Chippewas. Still, he didn't know whether
to believe them or not. He wasn't completely broad
minded.
The braves with white-walled pinto ponies occu
pied a lot of After-Wampum's time, and besides he
was put on many councils having to do with the
generation of rah-rah and the control of making other
little Indians into smooth braves who know how to
say "How!" in various cheerful ways. After-Wampum
was not sure that he knew what was most important
in the big tepee full of rah-rah and wise men. But
he had many different things to do. Squaws, rah-rah,
and learning how wrong his Uncle Chief Horse-trader
was. He was getting to be a much more confident
brave. And he supposed that was a good sign.
But pretty soon After-Wampum was so full of dif
ferent new ideas that he wasn't quite sure just what
the Opposite-of-Happy-Hunting-Ground he believed
himself. And he just went along like that, getting on
more councils, knowing more squaws at the Ugh-Ugh
Teepee, learning how to say "How!" and still wonder
ing how far he ought to go on believing the theories
of the wise men.
And that is all the farther After-Wampum got in
the Big Tepee. When he left he didn't know what he
believed. So he decided to go through life getting on
Councils and generating rah-rah. But more smoothly
than his Uncle Horse-trader had done.
And After-Wampum founded the Kiwanis Club.
