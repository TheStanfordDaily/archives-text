# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						RETURN OF A NATIVE 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In Monday's editorial I was referred to as the
former high student official who keynoted the S. C.
Game Rally last Thursday by admitting our doom and
implying that we might just as well "lie down and die
like brave little soldiers before it's too late." I am
sorry that my accuser gathered this thought from my
mumblings. It wasn't intended, it wasn't said, and I
do not believe it was inferred.
I was invited to speak as a last-minute substitute
for Ken Cuthbertson, so what few words I had to say
were the product of but slight preparation, but a deep
and sincere feeling for Stanford and its football team.
Since it seems that my intentions were grasped but by
a few and misunderstood by many, I should like to
take this opportunity to make clear the thoughts I
had in my mind last Thursday evening.
# * * *
J N BRIEF, as 1 recall, the essence of my stream of
"incoherency" was built around the oft-quoted
statement that "Stanford had everything to win and
nothing to lose," with which I disagreed. Admitting
that we did have everything to win, I believed we had
a great deal to lose. This last contention was founded
upon the possibility of a team and rooting section let
down, for the moment we gave up, not only Stanford
football, but everything Stanford stands for, would
suffer.
It seems that the general public's judgment of a
university is based largely on how its football team
performs. Either by actually witnessing the game, lis
tening to it over the radio, or by reading about it in
the papers, these people form a definite opinion of
the university that team represents.
Therefore, it seems to me that the Stanford sup
porters had no right to expect a victory in the face
of gigantic odds, but they did have the right to expect
the best and hardest play that our gang had in them.
If this could be expected then we should have no fear
of Stanford's losing any friends; and regardless of the
score, there would be no Stanford rooter who would
not be proud that ho was a Stanford man.
Brave little soldiers do not lie down and die.

In Monday's editorial I was referred to as the
former high student official who keynoted the S. C.
Game Rally last Thursday by admitting our doom and
implying that we might just as well "lie down and die
like brave little soldiers before it's too late." I am
sorry that my accuser gathered this thought from my
mumblings. It wasn't intended, it wasn't said, and I
do not believe it was inferred.
I was invited to speak as a last-minute substitute
for Ken Cuthbertson, so what few words I had to say
were the product of but slight preparation, but a deep
and sincere feeling for Stanford and its football team.
Since it seems that my intentions were grasped but by
a few and misunderstood by many, I should like to
take this opportunity to make clear the thoughts I
had in my mind last Thursday evening.

J N BRIEF, as 1 recall, the essence of my stream of
"incoherency" was built around the oft-quoted
statement that "Stanford had everything to win and
nothing to lose," with which I disagreed. Admitting
that we did have everything to win, I believed we had
a great deal to lose. This last contention was founded
upon the possibility of a team and rooting section let
down, for the moment we gave up, not only Stanford
football, but everything Stanford stands for, would
suffer.
It seems that the general public's judgment of a
university is based largely on how its football team
performs. Either by actually witnessing the game, lis
tening to it over the radio, or by reading about it in
the papers, these people form a definite opinion of
the university that team represents.
Therefore, it seems to me that the Stanford sup
porters had no right to expect a victory in the face
of gigantic odds, but they did have the right to expect
the best and hardest play that our gang had in them.
If this could be expected then we should have no fear
of Stanford's losing any friends; and regardless of the
score, there would be no Stanford rooter who would
not be proud that ho was a Stanford man.
Brave little soldiers do not lie down and die.
H. B. Lee
