pus Opinion as a communication to the student
body.
HTHE Students of Stanford University,
Dear Indians:
I have no doubt that I speak for the whole student
body of Southern California when I say we admire
the good sportsmanship you showed at the game last
Saturday.
We like your rooting section and we like your
spirit (well, all light!). Thank you for a lot of fun.
We are very sorry you did not score, but we are
sincere in wishing you better luck with your other
opponents.
Hoping that you, like we, are looking forward to
next year's game, I am.
With a chug-chug,
A Trojan Rooter J
