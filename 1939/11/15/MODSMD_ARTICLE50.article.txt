# Bemelmans' Zany Humor Gambols in 'Small Beer'
## 
### 
'"SMALL BKEIJ," by Ludwig Bemelmans, on salt' at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Here's a swell collection of Bcmclmans' short stories, reprinted from the
New Yorker, Vogue, and other topflight magazines. They're hung 011
pretty slim plot pegs, admittedly, and the only thing that saves them from

becoming pure drivel is the
Bemelmans humor, which jumps at
you unexpectedly like a playful i
puppy.
Of the stories themselves, the only
thing common to them all is the \
name of the author. The scenes
range from quiet little Austrian
lakes to the jungles of Ecuador, and
from 40th Street in New York to the
Place de la Concorde in Paris.
PLOT SAMPLE
It isn't really fair to the author
to divorce his plots from his intrigu
ing literary personality, but here's
an idea of what to expect. In
"Fancy Green" for instance, the
author turns up in Riobamba, Eeua- |
dor, all set to jump off into the ;
impenetrable jungles to get away !
from it all. Miles off in the hinter- 1
lands, he comes to a tiny village,
consisting of "a church, four houses,
and a magazine kiosk."
He buys a copy of the Saturday
Evening Post, comes across a rath
er salacious fragment, and wonders i
out loud, "How did that get by I
George Horace Lorimer?" The reply I
comes back almost immediately, !
"They have a new one now—Wesley |
Stout!" Whereat Mr. B. gives up j
and returns to civilization.
Or, on the other hand, "Putzi" j
reaches the heights of the bizarre
and elfin. It's a story about an Aus
trian concert master, who has trouble
forecasting the weather in order to
tell whether his orchestra should
play inside or outside. So, he has
his still-born son pickled in alcohol
and set in a jar on the mantlepiece. j
Makes the finest barometer you ever |
saw.
JABS NAZI REGIME
The Nazi regime comes in for a j
few jabs in the ribs in "Dog Story" !
and "Sacre Du Printemps," and are j
about the only yarns in the book in \
which those old friends of ours, j
character delineation and satire, are j
discernible.
The stories mentioned are not
necessarily the best or the funniest—
Ihat would be a matter up to the in
dividual reader's opinion. They.'re
all good. Illustrations are by Bemel- i
mans, too, and resemble Thurber !
with a hangover. But that's no j
blemish—the whole volume is de
signed for laughing.—Littleboy.

'"SMALL BKEIJ," by Ludwig Bemelmans, on salt' at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Here's a swell collection of Bcmclmans' short stories, reprinted from the
New Yorker, Vogue, and other topflight magazines. They're hung 011
pretty slim plot pegs, admittedly, and the only thing that saves them from

becoming pure drivel is the
Bemelmans humor, which jumps at
you unexpectedly like a playful i
puppy.
Of the stories themselves, the only
thing common to them all is the \
name of the author. The scenes
range from quiet little Austrian
lakes to the jungles of Ecuador, and
from 40th Street in New York to the
Place de la Concorde in Paris.
PLOT SAMPLE
It isn't really fair to the author
to divorce his plots from his intrigu
ing literary personality, but here's
an idea of what to expect. In
"Fancy Green" for instance, the
author turns up in Riobamba, Eeua- |
dor, all set to jump off into the ;
impenetrable jungles to get away !
from it all. Miles off in the hinter- 1
lands, he comes to a tiny village,
consisting of "a church, four houses,
and a magazine kiosk."
He buys a copy of the Saturday
Evening Post, comes across a rath
er salacious fragment, and wonders i
out loud, "How did that get by I
George Horace Lorimer?" The reply I
comes back almost immediately, !
"They have a new one now—Wesley |
Stout!" Whereat Mr. B. gives up j
and returns to civilization.
Or, on the other hand, "Putzi" j
reaches the heights of the bizarre
and elfin. It's a story about an Aus
trian concert master, who has trouble
forecasting the weather in order to
tell whether his orchestra should
play inside or outside. So, he has
his still-born son pickled in alcohol
and set in a jar on the mantlepiece. j
Makes the finest barometer you ever |
saw.
JABS NAZI REGIME
The Nazi regime comes in for a j
few jabs in the ribs in "Dog Story" !
and "Sacre Du Printemps," and are j
about the only yarns in the book in \
which those old friends of ours, j
character delineation and satire, are j
discernible.
The stories mentioned are not
necessarily the best or the funniest—
Ihat would be a matter up to the in
dividual reader's opinion. They.'re
all good. Illustrations are by Bemel- i
mans, too, and resemble Thurber !
with a hangover. But that's no j
blemish—the whole volume is de
signed for laughing.—Littleboy.
