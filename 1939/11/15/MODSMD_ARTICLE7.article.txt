# Strindberg Drama Will Open Little Theater Run Tonight
## 
### 
August Strindberg's "Dream Play" will begin its three-night run on
the Farm tonight at 8:15 o'clock in the Little Theater of Memorial Hall.
In tills play, Strindberg attempts to duplicate the swift illogical events
of a dream. To the dreamer, these happenbigs seem perfectly sane, and
normal, and she makes no attempt at judgment, merely trying to under-

stand and narrate. <
The first act of the play has seven
different scenes, and the curtains
never close at any time during the
act. With the aid of a projector, <he
settings become, in turn, a holly
hock forest, a humble room, a sun
lit space, a lawyer's office, a church,
a lawyer's home, and a quarantine
station.
FOUR SETS USED
Only four sets are used in the
second act. These include a casino
garden, the Mediterranean shore,
Fingal's cave, and an opera house
passageway. These are projected in
the same manner.
The prologue shows the Daughter
of India, played by Serena FrankeL,
standing on a cloud, awaiting her
dream-descent to earth. In this
scene she is admonished by the voice
of her father to discover why men
are always complaining and always
unhappy.
As the play goes on, she meets
many different types of men, all of
whom are unhappy, who are always
seeking, and who are always suf
fering the pangs of conscience.
These scene's and events are ka
leidoscoped together in a crazy, yet
seemingly logical manner, but the
whole plot sustains a mood of sad
ness.
