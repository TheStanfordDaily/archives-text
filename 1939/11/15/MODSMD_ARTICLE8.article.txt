# Gaieties Stars Plan Preview
## San Francisco Show To Present Singers 
### 
The Stanford Gaieties, 1939 style,
will make its preview bow tonight
when seven of the show's performers
and four of its featured songs are
introduced to a San Francisco au

The Gaieties representatives will
be starred in a floor show, though
it is not definitely known whether
the show will be released over the
air channels. Ray Stahl, Brad Young,
Pat Bernard, Micky Smith, and Bob
Stevens will sing several of the
Gaieties tunes and Dana Winters,
Ram's Plead president, will per
form.
Among the songs which are slated
to have their first public audition
are "Don't. Ever Forget," sung by
Ray Stahl; "So the Story Goes,"
chanted by Pat Bernard; and "Why
Don't You Leave Me Alone?" writ
ten and sung by Mickey Smith. Hob
Stevens will sing Bob Staver's "So
Long Ago." Aubrey Austin, campus
comic, will m.c. the show.
Gordy Weber, dramatic manager,
disclosed last night that seats for
the evening performance of the Gai
eties in Memorial Hall are nearly
sold out. Good seats are still avail
able for the afternoon show, he said.
The evening performance will be
gin at 8:15 o'clock on Friday night,
Nov. 24, and the matinee curtain will
