### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
|T LOOKS tough for the Germans.
If the United States was uncer
tain about what effects its revised
neutrality law, with complete ship
ping restrictions, would have in Eu
rope, that uncertainty was definitely
removed yesterday.
Belgium, it seems, is already feel
ing the pinch of the American arms
restrictions. She joined with Ireland
yesterday to urge the Administration
to lessen the pressure. If Belgium
notices the tightening in the steady
flow of supplies from American,
"un-neutral" neutrality law is tak
ing effect.
Both Ireland and Belgium are
neutrals in the current European
war, but because of their prox
imity to belligerents are trapped
in danger zones into which Amer
ican mcrchantincnt may not enter.
And they feel the hard, unyielding
grip of America's new arms meas

CO, yesterday Belgium's ambassa
k dor to the United States confer
red with Acting Secretary of State
Sumner Welles to determine the ac
tual scope of the government's neu
trality policy. His visit was prob
ably inspired by President Roose
velt's indication the government
would not approve the proposed
transfer of eight ships of the U. S.
Lines to the Panamanian flag.
Roosevelt seems to feel that it
wouldn't be right to place any of
our Latin-American neighbors in a
neutrality x-ole different than the one
under which the United States was
operating. And so he included all
21 American nations ir. his objec
tions.
Whether this ban might be ex
tended to include European neu
trals was one object of the Belgian
ambassador's visit with Welles yes
terday. It would be an interesting
move to have Roosevelt consider,
seriously, preventing transference
of registry to European nations.
He's already joked about the
problem with Washington news
hawks, but the time may come
when it will become a grave mat
ter for consideration.
Chances are that the Belgian am
bassador would like to obtain some
of the American vessels which will
Ixi reached under the law. Though
there's no way of determining
whether or not the Belgian economic
mission that has been in the United
States for several weeks is really
dickering for the outright purchase
of American ships, it's safe to as
sume that it's one of the issues
they're considering.
Jfc * t j
Vt/ELLES said that he had referred
the Belgian minister to the
Maritime Commission which would
have authority over sale or charter
ing of American vessels if the own
ers of these ships were indebted fin
ancially to the United States.
Meanwhile, representatives of
the 21 Latin-American nations
met in Washington yesterday in
an attempt to solve the problems
created for each by the European
conflict and to consider means of
stimulating commerce between
the various states. If the European
balance takes a decided nose-dive
after passage of the new neutral
ity law, something must be done
to bolster the trade with South
America.
Welles pledged the support of the
United States and added, signifi
cantly, that "the entire world knows
that they (the American republics)
are as one in their determination to
safeguard their security and to pre
serve the peace of the western hem
isphere."
Certain trade barriers that are
"excessive," he said, can be modified
—and reciprocal trade treaties are
"highly desirable."

Roosevelt seems to feel that it
wouldn't be right to place any of
our Latin-American neighbors in a
neutrality x-ole different than the one
under which the United States was
operating. And so he included all
21 American nations ir. his objec
tions.
Whether this ban might be ex
tended to include European neu
trals was one object of the Belgian
ambassador's visit with Welles yes
terday. It would be an interesting
move to have Roosevelt consider,
seriously, preventing transference
of registry to European nations.
He's already joked about the
problem with Washington news
hawks, but the time may come
when it will become a grave mat
ter for consideration.
Chances are that the Belgian am
bassador would like to obtain some
of the American vessels which will
Ixi reached under the law. Though
there's no way of determining
whether or not the Belgian economic
mission that has been in the United
States for several weeks is really
dickering for the outright purchase
of American ships, it's safe to as
sume that it's one of the issues
they're considering.

Vt/ELLES said that he had referred
the Belgian minister to the
Maritime Commission which would
have authority over sale or charter
ing of American vessels if the own
ers of these ships were indebted fin
ancially to the United States.
Meanwhile, representatives of
the 21 Latin-American nations
met in Washington yesterday in
an attempt to solve the problems
created for each by the European
conflict and to consider means of
stimulating commerce between
the various states. If the European
balance takes a decided nose-dive
after passage of the new neutral
ity law, something must be done
to bolster the trade with South
America.
Welles pledged the support of the
United States and added, signifi
cantly, that "the entire world knows
that they (the American republics)
are as one in their determination to
safeguard their security and to pre
serve the peace of the western hem
isphere."
Certain trade barriers that are
"excessive," he said, can be modified
—and reciprocal trade treaties are
"highly desirable."
|T LOOKS tough for the Germans.
If the United States was uncer
tain about what effects its revised
neutrality law, with complete ship
ping restrictions, would have in Eu
rope, that uncertainty was definitely
removed yesterday.
Belgium, it seems, is already feel
ing the pinch of the American arms
restrictions. She joined with Ireland
yesterday to urge the Administration
to lessen the pressure. If Belgium
notices the tightening in the steady
flow of supplies from American,
"un-neutral" neutrality law is tak
ing effect.
Both Ireland and Belgium are
neutrals in the current European
war, but because of their prox
imity to belligerents are trapped
in danger zones into which Amer
ican mcrchantincnt may not enter.
