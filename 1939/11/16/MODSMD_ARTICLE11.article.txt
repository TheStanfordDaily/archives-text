You don't need a car to go to the
Big Game Dance.
Auto-less Stanford students plan
ning to attend the A.S.S.U. spon
sored big game celebration will not
be inconvenienced by a seax-ch for
transportation, according to plans
announced yesterday by A.S.S.U.
President. Ken Cuthbertson.
Buses, with capacity for 18 couples,
will be provided Big Game evening
to take party-goers to and from Mill -
brae Country Club, where the dance
will be staged.
TICKETS TO BE $1
Reservations will be taken at the
A.S.S.U. office, Cuthbertson said.
Price will be $1 per couple.
With slightly more than one week
for reservations at, the Big Game
Dance, ticket sales are progressing
at "a highly satisfactory rate," Ned
Pugh, ticket sales chairman said.
Purchases seem split about 50-50
between upper and lower classmen,"
Pugh revealed. "Upper classmen
have perhaps bought most of the
tickets, probably because they know
just what a Big Game night can run
into."
MILLBRAE KATES BEST
The orchestra of Jimmy Grier,
"musical host of the coast," is the
main Big Game Dance drawing
card. Consensus is that the combi
nation Grier and Millbrae Country
Club for $5 is the best of the Big
Game night possibilities.
"We expect to limit the ticket
sales so as not to crowd the club
beyond capacity," Dance Chairman
Gordy Nicoll said. "If sales continue
at their present rate through next
week we may not have any door
sales."
