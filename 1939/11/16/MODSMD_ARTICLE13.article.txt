# Flyers' Club 'Blops' Sacks For Practice
## 
### BUD AMES 
Bombing of the Palo Alto Airport
is expected in the near future. Oh,
my goodness no, lady, they're only
little paper sacks, filled with sand,
which the eagle-eyed lads and las
sies of the Farm's Flying Club blop
—or try to—into a 50-foot circle for
practice.
Led by Frank Martin, president
of the club, 14 licensed members and
about 15 other associated members
are meeting and eating together at
intervals all in the interest of power
dives, propellers, and pancakes.
CLUB BORN IN 1936
1936—that's the birthday of the
club. Since then, in 1838, and '39,
its members have twice won the
Loening Trophy which is awarded
annually in March to the best inter
collegiate flying club in the United
States. Selection is made on the
basis of flying hours, type of air
planes flown, finances of the club,
and social functions.
Those social functions include
regular meetings and at least a
couple of banquets every year in
San Francisco hotels. And inciden
tally, lady, it's at these feed fests
that the club awards its intraclub
high-point trophy, a few medals and
the famed "bonehead" awards — a
fur-lined receptacle and an old bone
—which goes to the pilot pulling the
greatest, number of "butches" during
a given year.
Real activities of the club center
around its meets with Pacific Coast
College flying clubs, such as Cali
fornia, U.C.L.A., S.C., and San
Diego. Points in a series of events
spot landings, bull's eye landings,
I paper strafing and sand bomb drop
j ping, lady- are totaled to determine
each meet winner. During the last
| three years the Farm flyers have
J thrice trounced S.C., and this year
; took the California Roos Bros. Tro
phy from University of California
fledgelings.
Big meet of the year, the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Flying Meet, is
scheduled for the Palo Alto Airport
I probably about next April. Also fu
| ture telegraphic meets are being
1 planned with such eastern colleges
! as Purdue, Harvard, and Yale.
The airplanes oh yes, lady—the
airplanes. Well, they are Taylor
Cubs and Fleets, popping at about
DO and 100 horsepower, respectively.
Cruising speeds range between 70
and 85.
"No, No, lady! The Palo Alto Air
port is not going to be bombed.
. Get it?"
