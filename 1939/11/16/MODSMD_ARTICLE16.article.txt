# Plan to Control B.A.C. Started
## A.S.S.U. to Sound Student Preference 
### 
In a democratic move to bring the
Board of Athletic Control under the
hand of the A.S.S.U., in view of
three major issues which are due for
a reckoning at a near date, a "sug
gestion box" will be put up today in
the lobby of the old Union.
Designed to give the students more
part in deciding the major issues, the
board will take into consideration
any written suggestion which is
signed by the student. Names will
be checked in the student directory.
PROBLEMS LISTED
The move was taken in anticipa
tion of the following problems:
(1) Selection of a new track and
field coach, forced on the Board by
the resignation of R. L. (Dink) Tem
pleton this fall.
(2) Possible consideration of the
â–º fate of Claude E. (Tiny) Thornhill,
openly known to be under fire by
Several groups.
(3) Building of bleachers at An
! gell Field, scene of most of Stan
i ford's track and field meets.
I OPINION BOX POSTED
How the wind blows in these and
any other issues will be sought
through the "information box."
Members of the Board who will
decide upon current vital issues are
Dr. Thomas Storey, A1 Masters, J. P.
Mitchell, and William B. Owens,
faculty members; Stan Hiserman,
Hampton Pool, Ken Cuthbertson and
I Larry Livingston, student members;
j and Judge Weinmann of Oakland,
j Walter Ames of San Jose, and Chair
man Wesley Howell, alumni mem
| bers.
! NEED TO SWAY ALUMNI
As the "big three" issues come
| closer to a judgment day, students
j will be largely in the dark about the
way the group will send its votes,
| unless the suggestion box pi'oves
I feasible.
! Through the "information box,"
student leaders hope to influence the
votes of the alumni, who they feel
in turn can sway B.A.C. opinion al
most as they please.
Members Livingston, editor of The
Daily, and Masters, manager of the
I 8.A.C., do not have votes.
