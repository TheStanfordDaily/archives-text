Cedric Wright of Berkeley is
showing a group of photographs at
the Art Gallery during this month.
Both landscapes and portraits .ire in
the collection.
Scenes taken in the high Sierras
include distant shots of mountains,
studies of trees, bits of nature de- [
tails, and rock studies. The photo- j
graphs are notable for their fine i
sense of design and precision of !
detail, according to Pedro de Lemos,
gallery director.
