# Anti-Hazing Plans Tabled By Row Board
## Hoard Moves to Await Action of University Before Taking Steps 
### 
Definite action on the proposed
outlawing of fraternity hazing,
quests, and the shortening of ini
tiation period was tabled indefi
nitely by the Interfratemity Board
of Control last night.
The recommendations as advanced
to the Board by the Interfratemity
Council will not be reconsidered un
til University rules in regard to
hazing are clarified, according to
Council President Bob Moulton.
ACTION POSTPONED
"We have postponed action be
cause the status of the provisions
are not clear, and also due to the
fact that the board was not in full
attendance at tonight's meeting, 8
out of 11 members being present,"
stated Moulton last night.
The 10 proposed initiation period
rules for the season of 1940-41, as
submitted by Moulton and approved
by the council, were precipitated by
violations of certain privileges of
the University during this fall's ini
tiation ordeals. These recommenda
tions still must be approved by the
Interfratemity Board of Control,
which body has the duty of final
recognition, and of enforcement next
year if adopted.
