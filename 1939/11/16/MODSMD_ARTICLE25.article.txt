## Robinson Holds U.S. Land of Opportunity 
### 
Professor Edgar E. Robinson, head
of the history department, main
tained before Luncheon Club yes
terday that no other country in the
world presents the opportunities that
America does to college graduates in
particular, young people in general.
This statement heTnade in spite of
definite evidence to the contrary
concerning vocational advances made
by Stanford graduates.
After lightly ridiculing his source,
which asserted that only 1.27 per
cent of Stanford graduates have
made "Who's Who," Professor Rob
inson said, "It's clear, isn't it, that
Stanford is doing something more
than producing a few leaders?"
Professor Robinson advised his
listeners that they could best pre
serve the America which offers them
such great advantages by giving a
little serious thought to the follow
ing three fields: the lives and ideas
of radicals, people who would change
the present order; the great utter
ances and writings of eminent
Americans; and conditions under
which Americans have lived for the
past 150 years.
Concluding, he reviewed the ca
reers of several prominent Ameri
cans who have made great achieve
ments in fields they had not dreamed
of entering when he knew them as
college students. These cases he
cited as examples of the opportunity
and promise which America holds for
youth.
