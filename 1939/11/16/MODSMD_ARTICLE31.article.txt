# Cards Drill on Passes As Cellar Seattle Nears
## Cougar Mentor Expected to Give Exhibition of Sideline Gymnastics 
### 
When Washington State comes to town Saturday for the "cellar
clincher" with Stanford, the most jumpcty football coach in these parts,
Orin "Babe" Hollingbery, will perform on the sidelines.
It's too had (lint the smallest crowd of the season is going to see the
Cougar mentor, who alone of all the Coast Conference head men expresses

his inner emotions by jumping up
and down and kicking his hat like
a football.
This performance is bound to go
on, because like our Indians the
Cougars have kicked away lots of
points this season and it hurts (he
Babe every time.
'CELLAR CLINCHER'
The Indians and invaders will put
on the main show of the day when
they clash to stay out of the cellar.
From the start our Indians have
been occupying the lower rung,
while both the Cougars and Cal have
been just one step out. Cal has de
feated W.S.C., while W.S.C. beat the
Huskies.
Stanford victories against W.S.C.
and Cal would boost the locals well
out of the cellar. A loss would
practically clinch the cellar title.
For the second week, Tiny is tak
ing no chances of reinjuring his al
ready semi-cripples. There'll be no
scrimmages this week. Yesterday
was spent in a dummy defense
scrimmage against Hollingbery plays.
More passes filled the air, with Al
bert, South, and Mullin throwing
the ball around.
POOL TO PLAY GUARD
Although Hamp Pool went to
quarter Tuesday night, it was taken
just, for precaution by Tiny who said
that Pool would st'Mt at left guard
spelled by Braheny, Keusseff, and
Purkitt.
Bob Crane, the sophomore who
was moved from guard to quarter
last spring, will probably start Sat
urday in place of Gene Coldiron and
Bobby Templeton, both out with in
jured knees. Johnny Sturgeon was
also working there and may get a
second-string call. Crane also went
to fullback, but it was just another
shift in case things go wrong with
Standlee.
"Cookie" South has the distinction
of being the only player on the squad
who won't know until he's sent in as
to what position he'll play. Tiny told
him that he might play anywhere—
that means either right or left half
back.
Jim Groves' decision to quit, the
gridiron for the rest of the season
makes South's chances of getting into
the game at right half especially

"Cookie" South has the distinction
of being the only player on the squad
who won't know until he's sent in as
to what position he'll play. Tiny told
him that he might play anywhere—
that means either right or left half
back.
Jim Groves' decision to quit, the
gridiron for the rest of the season
makes South's chances of getting into
the game at right half especially
When Washington State comes to town Saturday for the "cellar
clincher" with Stanford, the most jumpcty football coach in these parts,
Orin "Babe" Hollingbery, will perform on the sidelines.
It's too had (lint the smallest crowd of the season is going to see the
Cougar mentor, who alone of all the Coast Conference head men expresses

his inner emotions by jumping up
and down and kicking his hat like
a football.
This performance is bound to go
on, because like our Indians the
Cougars have kicked away lots of
points this season and it hurts (he
Babe every time.
'CELLAR CLINCHER'
The Indians and invaders will put
on the main show of the day when
they clash to stay out of the cellar.
From the start our Indians have
been occupying the lower rung,
while both the Cougars and Cal have
been just one step out. Cal has de
feated W.S.C., while W.S.C. beat the
Huskies.
Stanford victories against W.S.C.
and Cal would boost the locals well
out of the cellar. A loss would
practically clinch the cellar title.
For the second week, Tiny is tak
ing no chances of reinjuring his al
ready semi-cripples. There'll be no
scrimmages this week. Yesterday
was spent in a dummy defense
scrimmage against Hollingbery plays.
More passes filled the air, with Al
bert, South, and Mullin throwing
the ball around.
POOL TO PLAY GUARD
Although Hamp Pool went to
quarter Tuesday night, it was taken
just, for precaution by Tiny who said
that Pool would st'Mt at left guard
spelled by Braheny, Keusseff, and
Purkitt.
Bob Crane, the sophomore who
was moved from guard to quarter
last spring, will probably start Sat
urday in place of Gene Coldiron and
Bobby Templeton, both out with in
jured knees. Johnny Sturgeon was
also working there and may get a
second-string call. Crane also went
to fullback, but it was just another
shift in case things go wrong with
Standlee.
