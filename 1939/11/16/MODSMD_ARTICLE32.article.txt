# Farm Poloists To Meet 'Utes'
## 
### 
Stanford will get its first look at
its polo team in action against col
legiate competition this afternoon
when the Farm riders engage the
Utah horsemen at 3 o'clock on the
Highway Field.
The Indians made a clean sweep
of their series with the Utes last
year, and they have come to the
Farm looking for revenge. The visi
tors will have three veterans in the
.starting line-up, but the strength
of the present aggregation is an un
known quantity, thus being their
first game of the season.
Major John Smith has indicated
that the Cards will take the field
with Bob Strom, upped from the
second string, playing number 2.
The rest ot the starters will be Joe
Smith at number 1, Gale Medlicott
as number 3, and Ken Weisenburg in
the back position.
The Ute four will consist of the
newcomer Jensen in the number 1
spot, followed by veterans Baker,
Fenton, and Pixton, playing in that
order.
The second game of the series will
be played Saturday morning at 10:30.
