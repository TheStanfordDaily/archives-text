# Injury Benches Star Merman
## Burns May Replace Dowling Against U.C. 
### 
Water Polo Goalie Frank Dowling,
I Stanford's kingpin in an ace defense,
' may miss the California "big game"
| tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock in
J Encina pool.
Suffering from a chipped bone in
his ankle, the big goal guard is on
crutches, but Coach Nort Thornton
j is holding hope that Dowling still
| may be able to play.
BURNS AVAILABLE
In case he is benched the situation
is cheered by the fact that Bill
Burns, second-string ace, is back in
the water after missing the U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. games because of poi
j son oak.
As practice continued today,
J Thornton was more than pleased with
j the offensive work of Duncan Patty,
big forward who has smashed his
way into a first-string berth with his
sensational shooting.
LITTLE BIG GAME
When the Stanford waterpups
meet the Cal frosh in the prclimi
j nary at 3 o'clock, the deciding factor
may be the six extra weeks of prac
| tice the Cubs put in before the Pap
ooses took to the water this fall.
The Cal team is strong defensively
: but slow pn offense and Coach Har
! vey Piothchild's charges will depend
on the .speed of their forward lineâ€”
I Don Dillon at sprint, and Jack
I'Bleecker and Johnny Hauerwaas as
j forwards, to overcome the heavier
i Cubs.
