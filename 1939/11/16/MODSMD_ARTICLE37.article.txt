A BUNCH OF THE BOYS
WERE WHOOPING IT UP
Tonight at 8 o'clock in the Pa
vilion, Circle S Society presents one
of the most exciting, spine-tingling,
thrilling shows the campus will see
this year, when 10 finalists in eight
divisions of the annual Novice Box
ing Tournament will attempt to out
slug each other for the right to wear
the little gold boxing glove that goes
to the winner.
These are boys who are inexpe
rienced, insofar as competition at
Stanford is concerned. No man may
compete who is a member of Stan
ford's regular boxing team, or who
has won a past novice tournament.
Green, willing, enthusiastic —
they always put on a great show,
and this year's series of bouts
should he more thrilling than ever
with several men entered who have
potent doses of lightning tucked
away in their brawny arms and
gloved lists.
However, those who shy away
from boxing because of expected
brutality need not worry on that
point, because Coach Clayton Frye
immediately stops any bout in
which one of his boxers is taking
a serious heating.
Tonight's fights will be fast and
exciting, but there will be no blood
shed. Frye doesn't believe in maim
ing college youths just to give a.
show to the customers.
One of the feature bouts will pit
Jimmy McCloud, finalist for the past
two years, against slugging James
Thurmond in the finals of the 155-
pound class. McCloud as a freshman
two years ago set himself the task
of making a present to his mother of
the gold glove that goes to the win
ner.
Tonight Jimmy is determined,
after being defeated in the finals
in '37 and '38, that he will achieve
his purpose. But he faces a rug
ged puncher in Thurmond, who.
while he has nothing against Mc-
Cloud's mother, would like to
carry home the booty himself.
Then there's the l(>s-pound bout
between Ken Rosengrcn and IVIel
Elicit that threatens to take on the
appearance of a dock braw l.
And, on the other hand, take that
bout between Blair Hyde, outstand
ing track man, and Frank Hewitt
for the novice championship of the
135-pound class. Hyde won one
light by a knockout and also has a
record of II straight victories at San
Mateo Junior College before trans
ferring to Stanford. Hewitt won
both his preliminary bouts by
kayoes. Draw your own conclu
sions on this fight.
And then there's the bout . . .
But why go on? They're all
equally good matches.
And for one worn quarter you can
see this "show of shows."
Dunno, but it seems to me that
it's highway robbery to get into this
spectacle for a mere quarter, when
it costs a couple of dollars to see
our football team play.

. . . According to the Southern
California Daily Troian, Dick Hy
land was all set to nominate Hamp
Pool for an all-American guard
position, but Tiny Thornhill, who
doesn't particularly like Hyland
anyway, changed Pool to quarter
back. Mebhe that's' the basis of
Hyland's intense dislike for Stan
ford this year. . . . When Stan
lord's horse polo team went south
to play the Riviera Country Club
last week-end. they expected that
the prosperous movie colony club
would outfit them with top-notch
horses. Imagine their surprise
when the Riviera trotted out some
riding academy horses for the Red
Riders of the Farm to mount.
