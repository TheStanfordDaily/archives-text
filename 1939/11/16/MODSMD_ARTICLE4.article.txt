# Freshmen Hock to Cal On Riotous Midnight Ride; Crimson Paint Fest Fails
## Berkeley Police Meet Marauders At Base of California Monument; Report No Damage by Stanfordites 
### VIC MINAHAN 
Informally charging the 125 Stanford freshmen who unsuccessfully at
tempted to paint the big cement "C" in the hills overlooking California's
Memorial Stadium last Tuesday night, James Keene, University of Cali
fornia student body president, yesterday claimed that several lawns of
Berkeley houses had been damaged by the raiders.
If any damage was done, the frosh violated the mutual pact pledge
taken by representatives of the two schools this year in which they prom-

ised not to damage each other's cam-,
puses prior to Big Game Week, said
Ken Cuthbertson, A.S.S.U. president.
EXPEDITION IS FAILURE
In accordance with the pact, the
Associated Students would pay for
the damage which was incurred
when Stanfordites attempted to burn
"S's" into the lawns.
However, a report from the Ber- I
keley police yesterday disclosed that j
they had no record of any Stanford |
student causing trouble Tuesday |
night.
The expedition itself was a failure, i
The big "C" remained unpainted, and |
all that the freshmen had to show
for their efforts were a few shaved
heads and a large number of sore
muscles and bruised limbs received
at the hands of waiting California
students.
BERKELEY POLICE WARNED
In .spite of the preparations, the
expedition became disorganized soon
after it left the Farm, and finally
turned into a small riot. Original
plans were that the group should
divide and proceed to Berkeley by
a number of different routes, but it
turned out that a small number of
cars went by way of Dumbarton
Bridge, while the bulk of them went
through San Jose, around behind
Oakland, and then into Berkeley.
The Berkeley police, however, had
been warned of the impending inva
sion, and were waiting near the
monument, where they stopped the
Stanfordites and confiscated their
paint. In the meantime, other cars
were coming in from different routes,
and the resulting confusion and
hubbub brought out about 200 Cal
students from near-by fraternity
houses.
CARD FROSH DISCOURAGED
From then on the whole thing took
on the aspect of a general riot. Sev
eral Stanford men, caught separated
from their fellows, were taken into
the fraternity houses and given head
shaves. One frosh was locked up
in a second-story bathroom to await
his turn with the clippers, but he
escaped by leaping from the bath
room window.
The loss of the paint and the supe
rior numbers of the Bear students
discouraged the Stanfordites from
any further organized activities, and
by three o'clock most of them were
on their way home. There was
some talk of making a second try
yesterday, but* the general opinion j
was that the Berkeleyites would be j
on their guard and would prevent ■
any such attempt.

Bridge, while the bulk of them went
through San Jose, around behind
Oakland, and then into Berkeley.
The Berkeley police, however, had
been warned of the impending inva
sion, and were waiting near the
monument, where they stopped the
Stanfordites and confiscated their
paint. In the meantime, other cars
were coming in from different routes,
and the resulting confusion and
hubbub brought out about 200 Cal
students from near-by fraternity
houses.
CARD FROSH DISCOURAGED
From then on the whole thing took
on the aspect of a general riot. Sev
eral Stanford men, caught separated
from their fellows, were taken into
the fraternity houses and given head
shaves. One frosh was locked up
in a second-story bathroom to await
his turn with the clippers, but he
escaped by leaping from the bath
room window.
The loss of the paint and the supe
rior numbers of the Bear students
discouraged the Stanfordites from
any further organized activities, and
by three o'clock most of them were
on their way home. There was
some talk of making a second try
yesterday, but* the general opinion j
was that the Berkeleyites would be j
on their guard and would prevent ■
any such attempt.
Informally charging the 125 Stanford freshmen who unsuccessfully at
tempted to paint the big cement "C" in the hills overlooking California's
Memorial Stadium last Tuesday night, James Keene, University of Cali
fornia student body president, yesterday claimed that several lawns of
Berkeley houses had been damaged by the raiders.
If any damage was done, the frosh violated the mutual pact pledge
taken by representatives of the two schools this year in which they prom-

ised not to damage each other's cam-,
puses prior to Big Game Week, said
Ken Cuthbertson, A.S.S.U. president.
EXPEDITION IS FAILURE
In accordance with the pact, the
Associated Students would pay for
the damage which was incurred
when Stanfordites attempted to burn
"S's" into the lawns.
However, a report from the Ber- I
keley police yesterday disclosed that j
they had no record of any Stanford |
student causing trouble Tuesday |
night.
The expedition itself was a failure, i
The big "C" remained unpainted, and |
all that the freshmen had to show
for their efforts were a few shaved
heads and a large number of sore
muscles and bruised limbs received
at the hands of waiting California
students.
BERKELEY POLICE WARNED
In .spite of the preparations, the
expedition became disorganized soon
after it left the Farm, and finally
turned into a small riot. Original
plans were that the group should
divide and proceed to Berkeley by
a number of different routes, but it
turned out that a small number of
cars went by way of Dumbarton
Bridge, while the bulk of them went
through San Jose, around behind
Oakland, and then into Berkeley.
