# Wee Wildcats Square Off Tonight; Peanut Boxes Atom
## 
### TAT NOWELL 
Stanford's "pugilistic atom," Terry
Green, has an opponent! When the
novice boxers square off tonight in
Encina gym, Green will be facing the
"Piedmont Peanut," one Ted Doe
by name.
Considerable controversy, specu
lation, and what-have-you was
created in novice boxing quartersj
when the name Doe appeared on the j
entry list. Those in charge smelled
skullduggery.
Green was summoned.
"Say, just whoinell is this guy
Doe, anyway?" he demanded.
That question remained unan
swered for a while. Then, later, the
peaceful sobriety of Coach Clayton
Frye's office was disturbed by a
small bundle of ire who bounced in
waving a student body card, regis-

tration blanks, and the bawl-out.
Frye raised an eyebrow as the tiny
tempest said:
"What's'is I hear? B'gosh, I'm Ted
Doe—and this oughta prove it —and
this and this!" And he unfolded the
evidence.
Frye, with admirable calm, per
used the student body card, the reg
istration blanks, and the bawl-out,
then stated solemnly:
"My boy, the battle of the minute
men is on."
Doe nearly broke down.
"Gee—thanks, coach. I was afraid
I'd have a lot more trouble proving
who I am. I'm always having trouble
with that name. Sometimes I think
I'll go nuts ..."
Be that as it may, Stanford can
watch these wee wildcats tonight.
