### 
With Chris Sontum booting four
1 goals from his forward position, the
! Card soccermen trounced San Fran-j
! cisco Junior College 5-0 yesterday on
! the local field.
Sontum duplicated the perform- ;
anee he turned in the first time the,
teams met this season, when he also
scored ;i quartet of tallies. Spacing
his scoring kicks evenly, Sontum
hooted the ball into the net once in !
every quarter.
Wilson Clark, who started the
game at center forward, made the
. . 1
other Indian tally in the second
quarter on a short kick after a short
passing attack took the ball deep
into S.F.J.C. territory.
S.E.J.C. GOALIE STARTS
| . A twisted knee forced Greyson
| Bryan to quit the game early in the
j second quarter. Bryan, who started
j the game at right half, wrecked the
| knee battling a San Francisco for-
I ward lor the ball.
! Santum, Clark, George Dole, A1
j Pellas and Bill Arrasmith bombarded
] the junior college goal throughout
the game. The Card forwards took
' upwards of 20 shots, but stellar
| work by the San Francisco goalie
1 kept all but a few from hitting the
I nets.
ALL CARDS SEE ACTION
Captain Bill Hamilton and Cam j
Pierce broke up what few scoring
rushes came their way so well that.
Card netmen Rudy Mun/.er and Tito
j Sanz-Agero handled the ball only
' three times between them.
Coach Harry Maloney literally
played everyone but the manager.
Every member of the squad saw
i some action, although the managers
declined Harry's offer to put them
| in as goalies.
After the game Harry said that he '
; was confident that the team could I
| beat Cal Saturday if the forwards |
click as they did against U.C.L.A.
last week.
