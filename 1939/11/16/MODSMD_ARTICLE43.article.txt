# Zetes Conquer Phi Psis, 8-6
## 
### 
Little Elton Boone, Phi P.si brick
field ace, all but passed the big Zetes
dizzy yesterday in a semi-final in
tramural football game, but the
breaks were just against him and
the Zetes defeated the Phi M'i x
to ().
Early in the contest Hoone flipped
a nice pass just over a Zete secon
dary man's head and into the arms
of Denton who was in the end zone
when he caught the ball. The play
started from 18 yards out.
THOMPSON TOSSES
Right after the kick-off the Zetes
started marching down the field,
mostly on "Cootie" Thompson's
passes. On the Phi Psi 40-yard line
Thompson started on what looked
like a wide run around the Phi Psi
right end, but when he had just
about reached the sideline Thompson
whirled and threw a beautiful long
pass to Bill Hawkins who stood in
the opposite corner of the field, and
the latter went over untouched.
With the score tied at (i-6, the

Phi Psi center had one bad moment.
On a Phi Psi play from their own
ten-yard line the pass from center
went way over Sparling's head and
rolled the the goal line where Spar
] ling fell on it. giving the Zetes two
; points -the winning margin.
The victory assures the Zetes of a
j spot in the intramural football finals
which will be played Friday. Then
opponent will be the winner of the
Firehouse-El Toro tilt which is to
be played this afternoon at 4:30
o'clock. The Firehouse, with the
1 Pfyl brothers in the driver's seat,
I appears to have the edge in today's
| contest, but El Toro has Ray Dean,
j a threat in any man's league.
