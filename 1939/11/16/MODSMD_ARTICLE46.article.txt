IN doing nothing, Interfraternity Board of Con
trol did something extremely significant last
night.
Upon considering Interfraternity Council's
recommendations for eliminating the ordeal of
Hell Week, it deferred action until more exact
definitions have been set and more thorough
investigations have been made. Rather than
thinking that the proposals were too strong, the
Board probably did not consider that they were
stringent enough.
Despite apparently revolutionary reforms
such as the abolition of guests and hazing and
the institution of six hours' sleep per day and
study periods, careful study proves that the
regulations do away only with activities which
are annoying or obvious to the public. They are
not designed to make life any easier for the
men who are going through the pre-initiation
period.
The rules provide for six hours' sleep in every
24 for sophomores, but there is nothing to pre
vent fraternity inquisitors from allowing one
hour sleeping periods at two-hour intervals.
They reguire study periods which can be ex
quisite mental torture under the proper condi
tions. They limit activities to the insides of
houses, but any group that wants to torture its
neophytes can make their life just as much a
Hell inside as out.
It also is significant that Interfraternity Coun
cil refused to recommend the abolition of the
paddle, the instrument that symbolizes the in
humanity, the brutality, and the stupidity of
the pre-initiation period. This action proves
that fraternities still believe that the physical
ordeal is the only way to transform a pledge
into a true member of the brotherhood.
It is obvious that the more mature minds of
the Board of Control, five of whose members
are faculty and alumni sponsors, do not agree
entirely with this contention. And it is possible
that it believes that Hell Week needs more radi
cal treatment than the Council has suggested.
At any rate, Interfraternity Board of Control
withheld its action last night.
And the shadow of its doubt is a significant
one.
