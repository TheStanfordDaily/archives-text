YESTERDAY a sport lor pugs. Today a sport
for gentlemen.
No other athletic event has risen so quickly
in the public's estimation as amateur boxing.
Formerly considered merely an appropriate
pastime for Ihe brass-knuckles boys with cauli
flower-ears, today it is only the seventh most
dangerous collegiate activity—and it stands at
the top of the roll for sportsmanship.
There are reasons for this, more reasons than
the facts that boxing is good exercise and good
fun.
First, it is unexcelled in building emotional
control, keen judgment, and organic reserves
for the body. Second, under intercollegiate rul
ings the sport has become as clean and fair as
any. Third, the men who have associated
themselves with amateur boxing have been the
type who would lend prestige to any field they
entered.
At Stanford its heartiest supporter is Harry
Maloney, who personifies the spirit of sports
manship, and its coach is Clayton Frye, one of
the most clean-cut and popular young men on
the fampus.
Here also the Gene Tunney awards are pre
sented annually not to the champion of each
weight class, but to the men who display the
most improvement, the best scholarship records,
the most ability and, most important of all, the
men who fight for *he fun of the game.

The entire student body will have a chance
to see this spirit of sportsmanship in action
tonight. Nothing exemplifies it better than the
annual novice boxing tournament.
Sixteen men will climb under the ropes in
the Encina Pavilion tonight to put on eight rous
ing bouts.
But more important, 16 men tonight will give
convincing exhibitions of good, clean sport.
