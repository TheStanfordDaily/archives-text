EMPTY GIRDERS IN TIIE OLD LI BE-LOT
now, as the great steel Gargantua
" usurps the virgin air, people are gazing up and
wondering. Some of them are just wondering what it
feels like to be up there in the sky swinging with
brawny arms and shoulders a l(i-pound sledge-ham
mer, or pressuring a lightning-pounding rivet-machine
against a 40-foot girder. But some of the crane-necked
watchers are wondering just how many books it will
take to fill the damned thing.
The more imaginative ones, chaps who probably
did a lot of day-dreaming in their formative years,
are conceiving all kinds of fascinating, other-worldly
uses to which various parts of the Hoover War Libe
could be put. Not the least practical of these is a
lookout tower to scout plays in the Cal stadium, from
a comfortable, glass-enclosed room on the very tip
of the tower. This comfortable scheme, however, may
be subtle propaganda emanating from Stanford's foot
ball scouts. Besides, there is a definite conflict be
tween this athletic venture and another, more patriotic
suggestion that has fairly captivated any number of
thoughtful R.O.T.C. men: a mighty dirigible hook on
the pinacle of this huge sky-scraping erection.

T>UT more humane innovators, refusing to see jingo
ism invade a university, have asked that the en
tire top floor be made into a giant aviary, as a refuge
for homeless, southbound ducks. Intriguing as such a
friendly move may seem, there is an even more
practical consideration. Why not use the fourtheenth
story as a substitute for pre-reg campus tours. All
important features of the Farm could be pointed out
with a minimum of effort. And during the rest of the
year a permanent guide could be maintained to point
out the Hoover home for the edification of all in
quirers.
But the gayer set at Stanford, energized by the Big
Game Gaieties directors, have an ingenious plan to
top all ingenious plans. And when they say "top,"
that's just what they mean. The Empire Hotel has its
sky-room. The Mark Hopkins has its "Top of the
Mark." What is more reasonable, then, than Stan
ford's outdoing them all with the very latest thing in
scenic and lively entertainment? The "Top of the Libe"
would make Stanford the night-life center of the West.
And in addition, it would ruin the Union Cellar.
Everyone is aware that the War Libe Tower will
outdo Berkeley's Campanile by four feet. But the
possibility of outdoing the Sky Room and the Top of
the Mark at one fell ascent is even more inspiring.
It is only to be hoped that scientists will not pull
a fast one on us and build right up to the point which
will make the thing a stratosphere test-station. As it
grows from day to day, it rather looks as though that
is just what will happen.
