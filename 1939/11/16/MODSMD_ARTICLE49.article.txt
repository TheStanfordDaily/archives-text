## HELL WEEK ON THE CARPET 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
"Hell Week" is a thing of the past; it is as
decadent as the mustache cup. The reforms initiated
by Interfraternity Council President Bob Moulton are
one of the few hopeful actions taken by (he frater
nity system in several years. The ordeal of initiation
is tribalistic. The Indians "ran the gauntlet"—we have
initiation. Few collegians would fail to protest against
having a medicine-man instead of a doctor, yet this one
feature of primitive life is preserved and glorified as
a necessity of becoming "one of the brothers."
The fraternity man squares his unselfconfident
shoulders and says, "Initiation makes a man out of
'em and anyhow—we had to go through it." If you
accept his premise, his logic is inescapable. Initiation
makes a man of one. I was initiated. Therefore, I am
a man. However, true manhood was never brought
to life by a paddle. The only justification I can see for
initiation is that, it nourishes the collegians' anemic
ego and gives an outlet for his adolescent sadistic im
pulses. How is the neophyte benefitted?
I do not intend to condemn the formal part of
initiation. That is certainly harmless and necessary. It
is only the public ridicule, paddling, and other forms
of physical and mental torture that appear "school
boyish" and anomalous in college life.
After you read the inevitable impressive and pro
found reply of the opposition, ask yourself—"is that
the attitude of a mature, educated, and enlightened
group of 1939?"
