r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
Speaking as only a few of a large group that feel
similarly, we object strenuously to Monday's article
contending that "Stanford Men Are Slow." If the poll
mentioned had been taken to find out how many Stan
ford men had dates for the Big Game Dance instead
of how many women, we'll wager the results would
have been somewhat different.
After all, this will be one of the big dances of the
year, and very few fellows are going to be satisfied to
take "just anybody." They'll want someone that is both
nice looking and a lot of fun. Setting only these points
as standards, we believe Stanford women should feel
complimented to find that as many as one-third of
their number has been asked. We think it's high time
the Farm women ask themselves who is to blame
before blindly criticizing the male population.
There are, naturally, a certain percentage of women
that fulfill the above-mentioned standards, and will, no
doubt, attend the dance. It is not these that we are
speaking of, but those that Will sit at home Big Game
Night calling Stanford men fools, and never realizing
that it is they are not the men who are to blame for
their predicament.
Sincerely yours,
E.R.H., D.E.S., F.W.L., H.H., T.C., J.H., C.C.
