# Familiarity Flashes Through Eeriness of 'Dream Play'
## 
### 
There are people who will sud
denly look up when they are in the
midst of a perfectly common-place
experience and say, "I dreamed this.
I knew that it was going to happen."
It's an eerie experience, this this
sudfden flash of recognition—recog
nition of an event which couldn't
possibly have been foretold, and it
is exactly this sensation that Strind
berg's "Dream Play" arouses in an
audience.
ILLOGICAL EVENTS
Tilings happen without apparent
reason; yet, all through the play,
there are flashes which bring the
spectator straight up in his seat with
the startled thought that he himself
has had he same experience in some
dream.
This presentation "of the Dream
Play" was a laboratory play given
by the students in the technique of
acting class and directed by Walde
mar Johansen. All credit should go
to both students and director, for
the production was finished in every
respect.

Through the use of revolving
stages, a projector, and mood music,
the feeling of swiftly paced events
and logical unreality was sustained
and held.
GOOD PERFORMANCES
Each performance was good,
though four, possibly because of
the opportunities offered, were out
standing. These four were the
j Daughter, played by Serena Frankel,
I the Lawyer, played by J. Edwin
! Arnold, the Poet, played by Bucky
| Henshaw, and the Teacher, played
jby Ruth Martin. Repeat perform-
I ances will be given tonight and to-
I morrow.
Philosophy is a hard thing to put
j over well, but Strindbci'g achieved
1 his point gracefully and beautifully.
Conclusively, and without ham his
trionics, he proves that "men are
to be pitied."—Nowell.
