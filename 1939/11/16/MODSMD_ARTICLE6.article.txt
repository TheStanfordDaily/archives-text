Un the otantora radio hour last
night. Dr. Harold M. Bacon, assist
ant professor of mathematics, dis
cussed the value of the art of cal
culation in logical thinking training
and it.s speculative interest.
Using the cases of several child
wizards as examples. Dr. Bacon ex
ploded the theory that the ability to
make huge calculations quickly and
accurately is the mark of a mathe
matical genius.
A man who can perform almost
unbelievable feats of calculation,
claimed Dr. Bacon, may be a mathe
