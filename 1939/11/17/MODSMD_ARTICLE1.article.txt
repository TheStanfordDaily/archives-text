641V0T Peace but a Sword" is
what Vincent Sheean calls his
latest book on a Europe poised for
war.
The Netherlands and Belgium
looked for peace. They were two of
those nations that sought bravely to
halt a continent's whirlpool plunge
into savage fightbig. They didn't be
lieve in war; they wanted peace—
and not a sword.
But., last, night, peace hopes blast
ed by Hitler's threat of a "war to
the knockout" against England, the
Netherlands announced, somewhat
sadly, that it had completed plans
for the evacuation of nearly two
million women and children from
lowlands areas. Slowly, reluctantly
preparing for any "eventuality"
that might invade its prized neu
trality, Holland closed the famous
Wielingen ship passages on the
southwestern coast, the dredged
channels of the Schelde river used
by both Dutch and Belgian ship
ping.

Belgian shippers were disturbed
hy the closing of the Wielingen
passages, forcing their vessels to
use the more difficult Costgate
channel into the North Sea, and
mild protests were raised during
the day in the Belgian parliament
at Brussels.

r PHE DUTCH laid extensive mines
in the passage, obliging Ant
werp-bound ships to use the other
channels. Of course the defense
measures were a sure sign that, in
the event of invasion of Holland,
Belgium would hardly be able to
remain neutral because of both
military and economic reasons. An
invasion of Holland would leave
Belgium literally and figuratively
"high and dry," since the ports of
Ostend, Ghent, Zeebrugge, and
Antwerp would be paralyzed.
Under these conditions, Belgium
would he deprived of about 80 per
cent of her imports of raw mate
rials and other necessary goods.
All plans for the flooding and
evacuation of the low areas and
lists were ready for release to the
burgomasters in the affected re
gions, indicating in minute detail
the course of action for removal
of all civilian populations in event
of an emergency.
Military authorities would imme
diately take over all hospitals. And,
in a precautionary measure, a par
liamentary bill provides for moving
the boards of companies in Holland
and the Netherlands colonies with
out consent of shareholders in case
of emergency.

r pifE huge evacuation, affecting
nearly two million persons,
would he one of the greatest of
mass migrations the world has
ever seen. The only mass move
ment that could top it—at least
in recent times—was Great Brit
ain's removal of three million ci
vilians from London and other
English cities just before the out
break of the war.
Grimly, supericiliously the Ger
mans rejected any further prospects
of a negotiated peace or mediation
efforts with a determined and de
fiant proclamation that Hitler will
discuss peace terms "only when the
war has ended victoriously for us."
That left lots of room for discus
sion. At. the same time, the Ger
mans announced thf.t they will
speed up the war on land and in
the air, in spite of the approaching
winter weather and the "off-sca
son" for war.

Great Britain and France, in
quick retaliation to the sea-raiding
German pocket battleships that
have taken such a tremendous toll
in Allied shipping, said they have
pooled their biggest and fastest
fighting ships in a determined effort
to track down the rovers. There
have been persistent reports that
one of the Nazi pocket, vessels has
been operating off the eoast of Af
rica after slipping into the south
ern Pacific from the Atlantic. Either
the Deutschland or the Admiral
Scheer sank a British tanker some
where near Madagascar.
